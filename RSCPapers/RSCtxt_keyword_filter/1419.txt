    , Accepted 9th August 2020First published on 10th August 2020AbstractOrganic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long diffusion length, and tunable direct bandgap, and their excellent efficiency was boosted to a certified 25.2% efficiency in 2019. However, due to the presence of a high-density of charge traps in perovskite films, plenty of charge recombination occurs at grain boundaries and defects caused by precursor compositions, the process of preparation and crystal growth, thereby restricting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). At present, interfacial modifications by using additives play an important role in various breakthroughs of PSCs. Herein, the effects of various additives with the main types of functional groups, length and spatial configuration of molecules on interfacial modifications in PSCs are reviewed, and their influences on perovskite crystallization and film formation, defect passivation in the bulk and/or at the surface, stabilities of PSCs, and adjusting the interface of structures and energy levels for device performances are also described and summarized. Finally, an outlook of interfacial modifications is provided on the selection and design of efficient additives with respect to the fabrication and development of highly efficient and stable PSCs.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskites, with the formula ABX3 where A = methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), cesium (Cs+), or rubidium (Rb+); B = lead (Pb2+) or tin (Sn2+) and X = halogen anion, including chlorine (Cl−), bromine (Br−), or iodine (I−), have been demonstrated to be excellent semiconductors for optoelectronic devices due to their tunable bandgap, small exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length, and strong light absorption coefficient.1 Their excellent efficiency was boosted to a certified 25.2% efficiency in 2019,2 attributed to the properties of perovskite materials and the structures and fabrication methods of devices, as shown in Fig. 1a. There are three types of PSC structures: mesoporous n-i-p, and planar n-i-p and p-i-n, as shown in Fig. 1b, which consist of a transparent conducting oxide layer, electron-transporting layer (ETL), perovskite active layer, hole-transporting layer (HTL) and metal electrode. The ETL contains titanium dioxide (TiO2), tin(IV) oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and so on. The perovskite includes MAPbI3, FAPbI3, MAPbBr3, FA1−xMAxPbI3, CsFAPb(IxBr1−x)3, CsPbI2Br and so on. The HTL consists of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, (spiro-OMeTAD), nickel oxide (NiOx), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), poly(4-butylphenyldiphenylamine), and so on, and the metal electrode contains Au, Ag, Al, Cu and so on.3 However, a variety of materials for fabricating PSCs inevitably lead to interface problems, such as interfacial defects on the surface or grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite crystals, vacancies (VMA, FA, VPb, Vx: I, Cl, Br), interfacial wettability and so on,4–6 resulting in the enhancement of non-radiative recombination losses and the formation of deep levels as additional recombination centres7 to decrease the PCE of PSCs.

With the progress in research of PSCs, interfacial modification has been used to improve perovskite thin-film quality and interfacial properties. Diverse available additives with functional groups (amino, carboxyl, thio, cyano, hydroxyl groups and so on) are widely used through coordination to avoid the above-mentioned interface problems, and they play an important role in various breakthroughs of PSCs. Besides, the additives will be removed or still remain in the PSCs after the fabrication process of PSCs. Therefore, the principles of screening functional materials with functional groups are more important to interfacial modifications. At present, the coordination of MA+ or Pb2+ and functional groups could efficiently regulate the formation of perovskite grains or directly reduce the defects on the grain surface or at interfaces or at GBs. In addition, the functional groups can also reduce the oxygen vacancies on the ETL surface through coordination, reduce the accumulation and recombination of charges at the interface, accelerate the electron–hole separation, and enhance the PCE and stabilities of PSCs.
Herein, we review the interfacial modification by diverse additives with functional groups for efficient PSCs and summarize the main roles of interfacial modifications by the effect of the functional groups of additives on the properties of PSCs depending on the coordination, configuration and length of the molecules, including adjusting the work function for the efficient transport of carriers, regulating the formation process and morphology of perovskite grains for large grain size and the high quality of perovskite films, reducing the vacancies, passivating the defects in the bulk and/or at the surface or interface for avoiding hysteresis and unnecessary recombination losses, and enhancing the PCE and stabilities of PSCs.
2 Interfacial modification by the additives with functional groups
Usually, the additives with functional groups are introduced into the perovskite films for fabricating PSCs with interfacial modification following three forms: (1) dissolving in the precursor solution for the one-step method; (2) dissolving in the single lead or the organic source solutions for the two-step method; and (3) dissolving in the anti-solvent (such as toluene, chlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and so on). Therefore, solvent polarity and the solubility, coordination, configuration and length of molecules as additives with functional groups have been mainly studied. According to the frequency of use to fabricate PSCs, the summarized functional groups follow the sequence of amino, carbonyl, thio, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and cyano groups, as shown in Fig. 2. Besides, we discuss the detailed effects of different functional groups on the properties of work function, defects and vacancies of films, substrate wettability, formation and morphology of perovskites, recombination and transmission of carriers in PSCs in each part. At present, characterization techniques for the interface modification include Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, energy dispersive spectrometry, and so on. The related defect characterization methods include that the transient phase of perovskites during the crystallization process can be recorded by the dynamic changes in the characteristic peaks through in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. For characterization of surface defects, Kelvin probe force microscopy can also be applied under dark and light conditions to detect the surface potential difference that is associated with the relative work function. The mobility of electrons or holes and the density of trap states can be measured with different constructions of PSC devices, which are carried out using the space charge limited current method or admittance measurements. The improved crystallization of the perovskite film with large grain size and low nonradiative defect density can be measured by steady-state photoluminescence spectra and Kelvin probe measurements, and a prolonged carrier lifetime, obtained from time-resolved PL spectra and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. To further identify defect species, density functional theory calculations, transient absorption spectroscopy and deep-level transient spectroscopy are also adopted to confirm that the defect is responsible for crystal quality optimization.8–10

2.1 Amino groups
The additives with amino groups (–NH2) are beneficial to the charge transport layer and the perovskite layer (summarized in Table 1), because they can promote the growth of large-sized grains, reduce the interface barrier, improve the efficiency of carrier extraction, and reduce interface defects and recombination. In Fig. 3a, Wang et al. use (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (–NH2) as the hydrophobic material to construct hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas by micro-contact printing via a commercial optical disc (CD-R), causing the perovskite precursor to enrich on the hydrophilic areas rather than on the hydrophobic area due to the hydrophilic–hydrophobic surface tension confinement, which achieves the perovskite competitive growth. The bond of –NH2 and Pb2+ on the hydrophobic area leads to quick nucleation and growth of the grain in the hydrophilic area, whereas the grain nucleates but grows less in the hydrophobic area. Therefore, the PCE of PSCs is up to 20.08% with free defects and large grain size.11 Hydrophobic octadecylamine functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (ODA-SWCNTs) have been modified on the surface of the perovskite layer, which can enhance the short-circuit current density of the perovskite solar cells and almost eliminates hysteresis. Meanwhile, the perovskite solar cells with ODA-SWCNTs obtain good stability with a performance retention of 80% after 45 day stability testing under a high humidity (60–90%) environment.12 In Fig. 3b, dopamine has been used to passivate the TiO2 surface via the chelating effect, reducing the oxygen vacancies and suppressing the deep trap states of TiO2 as the ETL. Meanwhile, due to the strong electron donating ability, dopamine can assist in charge transfer and avoid charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Besides, the amino group in dopamine can also passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ and decrease the Pb–I/Br antisite defects on the perovskite interface. Therefore, TiO2 with dopamine obtains the 20.93% efficiency of PSCs with negligible hysteresis and good stability after 1200 h of continuous full-sun illumination without any UV filters.13 Phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) as an organic halide salt on the perovskite surface achieves the surface defect passivation of perovskite films (the iodine vacancies on the surface, as shown in Fig. 3c), resulting in highly efficient PSCs. PEAI is the key to increasing Voc to as high as 1.18 V, which is 94.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit Voc (1.25 V). As a result, planar perovskite solar cells with a certified efficiency of 23.32% (quasi-steady state) are obtained.14 Besides, the long-chain additives, such as AALs,23 have been assembled on the perovskite grains, which restrict the grains’ tilt during the process of perovskite growth and eventually obtain a (100)-orientation-dominant film with low defect density compared to the randomly oriented film. Meanwhile, during the grain growth, the long-chain additive is expelled to the perovskite film surface, which obtains a high contact angle for improving the stability of PSCs.

Besides, some small molecules with functional groups have been used to form low-dimensional (1D or 2D) perovskites/3D perovskites and enhance the efficiency and stability of the PSCs against moisture degradation of the 3D perovskite. Pyrrolidine15 has been employed to treat a preformed 3D MAPbI3 film to form 1D pyrrolidinium lead iodide (PyPbI3), which shows improvement in both device performance and stability. It is attributed to 1D PyPbI3 with moisture-resistant effect and a wide bandgap and deep work function serving as a tunneling contact between 3D MAPbI3 and the hole transport layer to reduce charge recombination. In addition, ethylene-amine ligands16 (such as ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylenetriamine (DETA) and triethylenetetramine (TETA)) and n-propylammonium iodide17 assist in the transformation of 3D perovskites into 2D/3D perovskites, which reduce uncoordinated ions and surface trap states, suppress penetration of oxygen and exhibit excellent hydrophobic properties with high contact angle to avoid moisture getting into the perovskite material. Therefore, device performance and stability against moisture are simultaneously improved in the PSCs.
2.2 Carbonyl groups
The carbonyl additives as Lewis bases can donate electron pairs from the CO bond to the under-coordinated lead atoms in the perovskite, achieving larger perovskite grains and grain boundary regulation, passivating the uncoordinated lead ions in the grain boundaries of perovskites, obtaining the good perovskite film quality, low defect density and carrier recombination. Consequently, the modified PSCs have excellent efficiency and stability. The carbonyl additives include modified inorganic materials (CQDs),27 small molecules (2-(6-bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)ethan-1-ammonium iodide (2-NAM), theophylline, caffeine, and theobromine) and long-chain polymers ((poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),28 polycaprolactone (PCL),29 poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA),30 and polyurethane (PU)),34 which are summarized in Table 2.

In Fig. 4a, 2-(6-bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)ethan-1-ammonium iodide (2-NAM) with a high level of molecular planarity, strong intermolecular aromatic–aromatic interactions and Lewis base (CO groups) has been used to regulate the perovskite grain size by the second grain growth process of perovskites. It can increase the average perovskite grain size without influencing on the absorption edge and the phase of the perovskite film, while the passivation effect of 2-NAM on the reduced defect density is obvious. Finally, the devices with FA0.83MA0.17PbI2.51Br0.49 obtain efficiencies of 20.0% and 17.6% with active areas of 0.1 and 1.0 cm2, respectively.31 Besides, the electrical conductivity and the transport energy levels are precisely adjusted by controlling the density and chemistry of the radical sites at the macromolecular backbone. Poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate)-co-(4-benzoylphenyl methacrylate) (PTMA-BP) has a low-lying transport energy level of −5.1 eV, which has been utilized to increase Voc of the PSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS/PTMA-BP by reducing the energy barrier with the HOMO energy of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV). PEDOT:PSS after modifying PTMA-BP can efficiently overcome the energy barrier at the interface and achieve better energy matching, suppressing the interfacial recombination by the passivation effect of PTMA-BP, and efficient extraction and transportation of the charges are achieved, as shown in Fig. 4b.32 The same functional groups with different configurations of molecules also obviously influence the passivation effectiveness. In Fig. 4c, the carbonyl additives with theophylline, caffeine, and theobromine having the optimal molecule configuration, the conjugated structures and the dipoles induced by the hetero atoms can increase the intermolecular interaction. However, the hydrogen bond between N–H and I can assist the primary CO binding with the anti-site Pb defect to achieve the max surface-defect passivation. After comparing the formation energies of the selected native defects on the perovskite surface by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, theophylline with optimal molecule configuration (interaction energy: −1.7 eV) achieves the Voc enhancement due to surface passivation by theophylline through the Lewis base–acid interaction between the CO group and the anti-site Pb, resulting in a PCE of 23.48% (stabilized 22.64%) for the PSCs. In addition, the increased intermolecular interaction is a key to suppress the defects in perovskite films and improve long-term stability of the devices.33

2.3 Thio groups
A thio group is a complex functional group for the additives and consists of –SH, CS, SO, –S–, –SCN and inorganic sulfur source and so on. As is known, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a common Lewis base that coordinates Pb2+ is most widely used in the fabrication of perovskite precursors, such as (a) for the one-step method, DMSO is involved in the MAPbI3 precursor to fabricate the MAPbI3 PSCs;35 (b) for the two-step method, the DMSO molecule can also react with PbI2 to form PbI2(DMSO) or PbI2(DMSO)2;36 (c) for solvent annealing, DMSO vapor can efficiently increase the crystallinity and grain size of the perovskite film due to the recrystallization process caused by the DMSO vapor that aids in the formation of a liquid or a quasi-liquid phase.37
In Fig. 5a, there are four para-substituted benzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments, including the four functional groups: –CN, –NO2, –SCH3 and –OCH3 as Lewis bases. The adjustable work function and vacuum-level shift have been achieved by the interfacial dipole moment for assisting charge extraction, suppressing carrier recombination, facilitating charge extraction, and reducing charge accumulation at the perovskite interface. These effects enable the improvement of the PCE of PSCs from 19.0 to 20.2% and from 18.5 to 19.6% under 1 sun AM 1.5G irradiation with 0.16 and 1.00 cm2, respectively. Benzenethiol-modified perovskite solar cells retain high stability of devices, more than 80% of the initial performance after 185 h continuous operation at 50% – 50 °C relative humidity and temperatures under 1 sun irradiation.38 In addition, thiourea can also promote grain growth, enlarge grain size and reduce the grain boundary of the perovskite film, assisting in the effective transfer of electrons and holes at the interface, as shown in Fig. 5b.39–41 An oriented crystal growth was conducive to the formation of micrometer-sized perovskite grains because thiourea impacts the perovskite crystallinity and morphology by forming the intermediate phase MAI-PbI2-SC (NH2)2. In Fig. 5c, Cu(thiourea)I [Cu(Tu)I] with the thio group that can effectively reduce the trap state energy level of perovskites from 0.35–0.45 eV to 0.25–0.35 eV is beneficial to passivate the traps of perovskites by interacting with the under-coordinated Pb cations and halide anions at the perovskite interface, and eliminate the potential pin-holes. Meanwhile, it can accelerate hole transport and reduce charge carrier recombination by assisting in the construction of perovskite p-i bulk heterojunctions to increase the depletion width from 126 to 265 nm. After optimization, a high efficiency of 19.9% has been obtained in the PSCs with Cu(Tu)I (Table 3).42

2.4 Carboxyl groups
The function of a carboxyl group (–COOH) is to interact with Pb and/or I ions in the perovskite film for inhibiting the migration of ions, passivating the trap states at the GBs derived from the under-coordinated Pb and I ions, adjusting the band alignment of the transfer materials, improving the conductivity of the ETL/perovskite with high electronic mobility, and assisting the PSCs to obtain small hysteresis and good moisture stability by increasing the alkyl chains as a hydrophobic part of molecules. In Fig. 6a, the carboxyl groups at the end of the C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) chain can coordinate with Sn on the surface of the SnO2 layer by chemical reactions. The introduced CPTA decreases the energy loss during the process of electron transfer across the SnO2/MAPbI3 interface, and improves the carrier selectivity to electrons. It obtains a high PCE of 18.36% for the perovskite solar cells under 1 sun AM1.5 sunlight. Moreover, the flexible perovskite devices based on SnO2-CPTA as the ETL also show excellent ambient stability and mechanical durability.46 In Fig. 6b, 2-aminoterephthalic acid as a cross-linking agent, consisting of a benzene ring, an ammonium group (–NH2) and two carboxyl groups (–COOH), has been used to modify the exposed perovskite grain boundaries, which inhibits the migration of ions and passivates the trap states at the GBs. In addition, 2-aminoterephthalic acid efficiently enlarges the perovskite grain size and improves the hydrophobicity of perovskite films. Thereby, the optimal device achieved a remarkable PCE of 21.09% and good stability.47 Similarly, aminocaproic acid H2NCH2(CH2)4COOH (AmCA) along with caproic acid CH3(CH2)4COOH (CA) has been used to modify the mesoporous TiO2/perovskite interface, as shown in Fig. 6c. After modification, it accelerates the interfacial electron transfer and further improves the efficiency of PSCs because carboxyl groups bind very well onto the surface of TiO2. By tuning the molar ratios, the best efficiency of PSC devices reached 18.21%. Besides, the PSC maintains 70% of its initial efficiency after 30 days of storage in air at 50 ± 5% relative humidity, which is attributing to resist the moisture with alkyl chains from CA.48

2.5 Hydroxyl groups
In the hydroxyl group (–OH), not only could oxygen atoms coordinate with Pb2+, but the hydrogen atoms could also coordinate with the anion in the perovskite by hydrogen bonds (O–H⋯I−). In Fig. 7a, the advantages of phenol as an effective additive have been used to fabricate PSCs. The O atom in phenol can coordinate with Pb2+ to promote the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite and effectively decrease the density of defect states. In addition, phenol with low boiling point can be easily removed by thermal annealing under vacuum, ensuring negligible residues in the perovskite film. Therefore, the addition of phenol leads to larger average grain sizes, less grain boundaries, and decreased concentration of trap states, resulting in improving Voc, Jsc and FF due to less non-radiative recombination. It achieves a better PCE of 17.0% than the pristine device (14.2%).56 Due to the excellent electronic properties and non-wettability of fullerene and its derivatives, fullerene derivative pyrrolidinofullerene C60-substituted phenol (NPC60-OH) with the hydroxyl group has been utilized to modify SnO2 as the ETL in PSCs, suppressing heterogeneous nucleation and enhancing perovskite grain size. Importantly, the charge transporting property of SnO2 as the ETL has been improved from 2.64 × 10–4 mS cm−1 to 1.05 × 10−3 mS cm−1; the trap-state density of the perovskite film has also been decreased by ∼22%, as shown in Fig. 7b. The device based on SnO2/NPC60-OH obtains an enhanced PCE of 21.39% with less hysteresis and higher stability than the pristine one (19.04%).57 Furthermore, the bond dissociation energy of the phenolic hydrogen in dibutylhydroxytoluene (BHT) is low, which inhibits the intermediate decay channels of the degraded perovskite, as shown in Fig. 7c. The BHT can efficiently improve the stability performance of PSCs by modulating the chemical environment due to form intermediate complexes, and suppressing photo oxidation in perovskite degradation due to quench generated free radical species by donating its freely available hydrogen attached to its hydroxyl site. This easily extractable hydrogen can effectively terminate the degradation reaction by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and therefore preventing iodide oxidation and deprotonation of ammonium ions. Based on the above, the device obtains a high PCE of 18.1% and high stability performance.58 Other additives have the same functions for enhancing the crystallinity and morphology and effectively decreasing the density of defect states, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),59 polyethylene glycol (PEG)60 and so on with the hydroxyl group can form the O–H⋯I− hydrogen bonding interactions can improve the stability of PSCs under high humidity by the function of –OH and MA+. In Fig. 7d, PEG molecules have been anchored on the surface of perovskite grains by hydrogen bonding to achieve strong self-healing or water resistant effect under vapor spray, exhibiting excellent performance in the stability test in a highly humid environment (70% relative humidity) and enduring the moisture for over 300 h. It ascribes to the hygroscopicity of the PEG and their strong hydrogen bond with the perovskite. The hydroxyl group helps the PEG molecule restrain water penetrating into the film by forming a compact moisture barrier around perovskite crystal grains, and anchors MAI molecules on the nearby PEG molecules rather than escaping away under water, resulting in the regenerated perovskite MAPbI3 phase after being kept away from water vapor.

Besides, hydroxyl additives have been introduced into the PSCs for slowing down the crystal growth, directing the crystal orientation, reducing the trap states, suppressing the migration of the iodide ions, passivating the surface of perovskites and improving the stability of devices. The details are listed in Table 5.

2.6 Cyano groups
The cyano group (CN) has strong electron-withdrawing properties, assisting in the transfer of electrons and the reduction of electron–hole recombination in perovskite films. Besides, it has been used to control the perovskite formation kinetics, and the incorporation of cyano-based small molecules into perovskite precursor solution can realize the densely packed perovskite films with low trap states based on the Lewis acid and base.
In Fig. 8a, the π-conjugated Lewis base (IDIC) has been added into PSCs as an interlayer between the perovskite and the cathode. Due to the excellent n-type semiconducting properties of IDIC, it can easily extract electrons from the perovskite layer, meanwhile the Lewis base end groups of IDIC can passivate the uncoordinated Pb of MAPbI3 through coordination between the Lewis acid and base, MAPbI3/IDIC. The PSCs yield a 45% PCE enhancement relative to the pristine device without IDIC.64 However, another cyano-based small molecule 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis (4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno [1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) also has a similar function for controlling the formation of high quality perovskite films (good morphology and low defect concentrations), as shown in Fig. 8b. ITIC with the cyano group makes the perovskite film avoid the high density of defect states during the low-temperature process and achieves a more compact morphology and a larger grain size.65

KGaA, Weinheim. (b) Schematic illustration of defect formation in the perovskite crystal via a cyano-based small molecule assisted strategy.

(c) Schematic illustrations of spontaneous grain polymerization in MAPbI3-E2CA films, and the moisture and thermal stability of PSCs. Reproduced with permission from ref. 66 Copyright 2019, Elsevier Ltd. 
For the moisture and thermal stability of PSCs, the polymerizable additive ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (E2CA) with the cyano group has been anchored to the grain boundaries owing to the coordination of –CN and –CO groups with PbI2, as shown in Fig. 8c. When the perovskite film with E2CA is exposed in moisture air, E2CA will undergo spontaneous polymerization to form hydrophobic polymer around the grain boundary, achieving the blocked channel of moisture penetration, resulting in the enhanced moisture-resisting properties of perovskite films (relative humidity: 40–60%), retaining ∼90% of the maximum efficiency after aging over 1000 h. Meanwhile, the PSC devices with E2CA still show good stability even at high temperature (85 °C) in a humid environment, retaining over 90% of the efficiency after aging 200 h.66
Besides, there are some useful materials with the cyano group, such as 3-aminopropionitrile (3-APN),67 organic terminal groups (OTGs),68 2-amino-5-cyanopyridine (ACP)69 and so on, and the details are listed in Table 6. The main functions of the cyano group are reflected in the following aspects: (1) bonding with the Pb–I framework of the perovskite lattice as an anchor; (2) controlling the perovskite formation kinetics to realize the densely packed perovskite films and enlarge the grain size; (3) passivating the defects at the grain boundary and surface of perovskite films; and (4) suppressing the lattice distortion triggered by moisture or polar solvents.

3 Conclusions
In this review, we have summarized the interfacial modification with different strategies and efforts using the diverse available additives with functional groups in PSCs, which have been used to adjust the work function for the efficient transport of carriers, reduce the defects at the perovskite surface and interfaces for avoiding unnecessary recombination losses, passivate the traps for reducing hysteresis, regulate the formation of perovskite grains for enlarging grain size, and provide high quality perovskite films for improved performance and stability of photovoltaics.
Despite the remarkable progress that has been made on the stability and efficiency of interfacial modifications with functional groups, the following aspects remain to be explored further to guide the interface modification by the selection and design of efficient additives:
Firstly, for the selection of functional groups, the formation, morphology, quality and interfacial transmission of perovskite films depend primarily on the physical and chemical properties of the functional groups, such as polarity, work function, coordination ability, species, number of groups, etc. An optimized combination of functional groups for the interfacial modification can be achieved by selecting the species and remarkable properties of the groups with different functional groups.
Secondly, for the selection of additives, the molecular weight, molecular chain length, and molecular spatial configuration of the additives with the properties of hydrophobicity for moisture insulation, thermal stability, light resistance, flexibility, etc. have an obvious influence on the passivation and regulation of perovskite films and the stability and efficiency of the PSCs.
Finally, for exploration and breakthrough of interfacial modification with functional groups, in order to further improve the performance of PSCs, designing and tailoring new functional additives based on molecular engineering can be explored to effectively passivate the defects in perovskite films and interfacial traps and immensely improve the capability of interface modification. Breakthroughs in performances and stabilities of PSCs are expected to be achieved by carefully selecting materials and optimizing devices.
In a word, the interfacial modification can make remarkable contributions to the future progress in PSCs. However, there is still a long way to go to optimize the performance of perovskite photovoltaics. The advances in additives with functional groups will benefit the development of highly efficient devices to promote the commercial development of PSCs.
