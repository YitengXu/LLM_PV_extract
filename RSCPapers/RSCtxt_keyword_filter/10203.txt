    , Accepted 6th April 2018First published on 10th April 2018AbstractTwo small molecules denoted as BD-pPor and BD-tPor composed of a central BODIPY core surrounded with two DPP and two porphyrin units have been designed and synthesized. In BD-pPor and BD-tPor, porphyrins are linked to the central BODIPY by phenyl and thiophene bridges, respectively. The optical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated in order to employ them as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. After the optimization of the active layer, the organic solar cells based on BD-pPor and BD-tPor exhibit overall power conversion efficiencies of 6.67% and 8.98% with an energy loss of 0.63 eV and 0.50 eV. The low value of energy loss for BD-tPor may be related to the low LUMO offset between the BD-tPor and PC71BM (0.31 eV) as compared to that between BD-pPor and PC71BM (0.36 eV). The low energy loss also leads to a higher value of open-circuit voltage for the BD-tPor based OSC than its BD-pPor counterpart, despite the slightly deeper HOMO energy level of BD-pPor. The enhanced values of Jsc and FF of the BD-tPor based OSCs may be related to the better exciton dissociation and charge transport, as confirmed from the PL spectra and charge carrier mobility. These results indicate that the combination of BODIPY, DPP and porphyrin in the same conjugate is very promising for small molecule organic solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, taking the growing energy crisis into account, intensive research has focused on the development of clean and renewable energy sources – solar cells – as an alternative to widely used fossil fuels. Although silicon solar cells are commercially predominant photovoltaic technologies, organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit advantages such as low cost, low weight, manufacturability and the ability to manufacture large-area devices, which makes them promising candidates for next generation renewable energy convertors.1,2 At present, high-performance OSCs are usually made on the basis of mixed donor (polymer) and acceptor (fullerene and non-fullerene) materials with the formation of bi-continuous interpenetrating networks with large inter-phase regions that provide effective dissociation of excitons. Over the past decade, the effectiveness of OSCs based on conjugated polymers as donors has made significant progress, demonstrating an efficiency of more than 13%,3–5 which represents a huge step towards the successful commercialization of OSCs. Although OSCs made from polymers are very promising, they suffer from batch-to-batch variation, such as chain-length polydispersity and structural defects, and possible difficulties in purification. On the other hand, their small molecule (SM) analogues have several advantages such as well-defined chemical structures, compared to a mixture of different length polymer chains, less batch-to-batch variation, easier purification and characterization, or better structural organization at the molecular scale.6 The PCEs of SM OSCs are steadily catching up with high-performance polymer-based OSCs, reaching values in the range of 10–12%.7–9 However, there is a great need for new ideal small molecule materials to further improve the PCEs and device durability, which are crucial for the commercialization of this technology.10 Among all the conjugated patterns used for organic electronics and photovoltaics, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) may be the most widespread.11 This electron poor unit, which exhibits intense absorption, a high fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) and good thermo- and photo-stability, has been employed to design many donor materials,12–14 leading to PCEs as high as 9% for both polymer and SM OSCs.15,16 Porphyrin, even if mostly studied for dye-sensitized solar cells in the past, has gained high interest for application in OSCs since the last few years. Its outstanding optical and electrochemical properties, such as the ability to transfer electrons to the PCBM acceptor, have led to the development of many efficient electron donor materials.17,18
For example, the combination of porphyrin with DPP units has been extensively studied as SMs,19,20 resulting in promising PCEs over 9%,15 whereas their polymer counterparts reach ∼6% PCE.21 On the other side, BODIPY-based materials have been less studied than the chromophores presented hereinabove, and previously afforded moderate PCEs of about 2% when mixed with PCBM for polymers,22 and 5% for SMs.23,24 But recently, interesting PCE values of 5.8% with a SM based on a BODIPY–triazatruxene scaffold25 and up to 8.8% for polymers have been reported.26,27 Except for these last couple of examples, the trend was the same for both porphyrin and BODIPY with, very often, better results obtained with SMs28–30 compared to polymers. More generally, a lot of efforts have been put into molecular design of SMs in order to tune their electronic properties and the morphology of BHJ in order to improve photovoltaic efficiencies.
In this work, we report the design of two new electron donor SMs, BD-pPor and BD-tPor (see Chart 1), gathering, for the first time, porphyrin, BODIPY and DPP all-together in the same molecular structure. These assemblies are composed of a central BODIPY core, surrounded with two DPP and two porphyrin side units. The complementary absorption properties of these three chromophores were expected to afford materials being able to widely harvest solar photons over a broad energy range, thus acting like very efficient “light antennas”. These absorbers were also chosen for their compatibility in order to generate energy transfer (EnT) processes. Indeed, a strong spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption is an important prerequisite to be suitable EnT partners. In BD-pPor and BD-tPor, excitation energy from DPPs and porphyrins is expected to converge toward the lowest energy absorber, which is the BODIPY moiety. The latter should also exhibit the closest LUMO level to the electron acceptor LUMO (PC71BM) and should consequently be responsible for the final electron transfer step. Numerous examples from the literature report efficient porphyrin → BODIPY31 or DPP → BODIPY32 EnT phenomena.
 Chart 1  Structures of BD-pPor and BD-tPor SMs. 
The two structures only differ from each other in the aromatic bridge between BODIPY and porphyrins. Phenylene and thienyl were used for BD-pPor (“p” for phenyl) and BD-tPor (“t” for thiophene), respectively. The optical and electrochemical properties of each SM, such as frontier orbitals and transition energies, are compared to study the influence of the spacer. The electrochemical properties (HOMO and LUMO energy levels) of these SMs indicate that they can be potentially used as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor for SM OSC application. After the optimization of active layers (donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent vapor annealing treatment), OSCs showed overall power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.67% (energy loss = 0.63 eV) and 8.98% (energy loss = 0.50 eV), for BD-pPor and BD-tPor respectively. These values of PCE are among the highest values so far reported for these types of small molecules to the best of our knowledge.15
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The structures of BD-pPor and BD-tPor are composed of three different building blocks corresponding to well-known chromophores: BODIPY, porphyrin and DPP. Each of them is able to strongly absorb photons in different energy ranges, and their combination was expected to cover the solar spectrum from near-UV to near-IR. In this work, BODIPY has been chosen as a central platform because it allows convenient, selective and efficient functionalization from several positions all around its core. Except for the meso-position, each of the reactive positions is doubled, making the elaboration of symmetrical assemblies quite simple. The synthetic pathway is presented in Scheme 1. The chosen 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-BODIPY bears at the 8 position a sterically hindered mesityl group which is orthogonal to the BODIPY core, promoting the solubility of BODIPY as well as high fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF = 0.76 (ref. 33)–0.97 (ref. 34) reported in the literature, versus 0.36 (ref. 35) for phenyl analogue).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of BD-pPor and BD-tPor. 
The structure of 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-BODIPY 1 has already been described in the past.33 It consists of a two-step synthesis including, firstly, the condensation between pyrrole and mesitaldehyde under acidic conditions and secondly, the iodination reaction of free β-positions using N-iodosuccinimide. The first step afterwards was a Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the 3- and 5-position methyl groups of the BODIPY and an aldehyde. Two different formyl-porphyrins were synthesized in order to play the aldehyde role and bind porphyrins to the BODIPY following a strategy developed by our groups.26 The synthesis of porphyrin 2 has been reported in early publications,26,36 whereas porphyrin 3 has been obtained from the corresponding bromothienylporphyrin, the latter being already described in the literature.37 This reaction involved a halogen–metal exchange between bromine and lithium using n-butyllithium followed by addition of dry DMF.38 The difference between porphyrin 2 and porphyrin 3 is the aromatic linker between the porphyrin core and the aldehyde function, which is either a phenyl or a thiophene group, respectively. Both 2 and 3 have been involved with BODIPY 1 in the Knoevenagel condensation to obtain compounds 4 and 5, respectively, with quite high yields (54% and 71%). The BODIPY moiety within 4 bears two styryl arms from 3 and 5 positions whereas 5 is a bis-extended BODIPY with two vinyl-thiophene moieties. The structures were further confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S10 and S13†) with shows, among other signals, the apparition of two new doublets in the 7.5–9.0 ppm region associated with large proton–proton coupling constants (J ∼ 16.5 Hz). These signals corresponding to the four vinylic protons are indicative of E configuration for the double bonds. The presence of iodine atoms at 2 and 6 positions of the BODIPY is of utmost importance in this step, because the electron withdrawing character of these groups exacerbates the acidity of methyl protons on 3 and 5 positions. Indeed, we did not notice any trace of products for this reaction when these positions were free. BD-pPor and BD-tPor were obtained from compounds 4 and 5, respectively, by a double Sonogashira coupling reaction involving readily available iodine atoms on BODIPY and two mono-ethynyl DPP 6 units.39 The use of triple bond spacers allows the decrease of bulk hindrance and promotion of a planar and conjugated structure between central BODIPY and peripheral DPP units. Expected structures for BD-pPor and BD-tPor were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S16 and S19†) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S17 and S20†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of BD-pPor and BD-tPor are readily understandable by comparison with starting compounds 4, 5 and 6 (Fig. 1). Firstly, compounds 4 and 5 which both include one BODIPY and two porphyrins feature classic absorption bands associated with zinc porphyrin, i.e. a narrow and intense S0 → S2 transition at 425 nm, commonly named the Soret band, and two Q bands (S0 → S1 transitions) at 560 nm and 600 nm. From the comparison of 4 and 5 with original porphyrins 2 and 3 shown in Fig. S2,† it is noticed that the positions of these bands are not affected by the substitution on the BODIPY. This obviously means that the electronic properties of porphyrin macrocycles are not changed and there is almost no conjugation between porphyrins and BODIPY moieties. On the other hand, 4 and 5 absorption spectra exhibit characteristic bands of extended BODIPY (S0 → S1 transition) at 662 nm and 714 nm, respectively. This corresponds to bathochromic shifts of about 130 nm and 180 nm compared to starting diiodo-BODIPY 1 (λmax = 535 nm). If the value is typical of common styryl-BODIPY such as in compound 4 (∼65 nm shift per styryl),40 it is worth noting that the use of the vinyl-thiophene bridge in compound 5 allows further displacement toward the lowest energies (∼90 nm shift per vinyl-thiophene). The addition of two DPP units from 4 to BD-pPor and 5 to BD-tPor results in the increase of absorption intensity in the 500–650 nm range because of the overlapped absorptions of porphyrin Q bands and usual DPP absorption. More interestingly, absorption bands corresponding to BODIPY are further shifted to 720 nm for BD-pPor and 752 nm for BD-tPor because of the extension of the conjugation pathway induced by ethynyl spacers between BODIPY and DPPs.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of compounds 4 and 5, DPP 6, BD-pPor and BD-tPor in 2-MeTHF solutions at 298 K. 
The absorption profiles of BD-pPor and BD-tPor in thin films were broadened compared to those in solution (Fig. 2). This combination of porphyrins, DPPs and BODIPY finally resulted in materials which absorb intensely from 400 nm up to 818 nm and 861 nm for BD-pPor and BD-tPor respectively. The higher energy shoulder in the BODIPY absorption at 680 nm and 700 nm for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively, appeared to be more intense in thin films. This may originate from the aggregation of the dyes driven by π-stacking interactions at the solid state.
 Fig. 2  Absorption (solid lines) and emission (dashed lines) spectra of BD-pPor (black traces) and BD-tPor (red traces) in thin films cast from CHCl3 solutions. 
The SMs both exhibited strong near-infrared fluorescence emission (Fig. 2). The fluorescence properties of BD-pPor and BD-tPor are more extensively presented in Fig. S3a–d.† In solution (Fig. S3a and b†), the selective excitation of porphyrin or DPP moieties in BD-pPor and BD-tPor at 425 nm resulted in an intense emission band at 740 nm and 790 nm, respectively, which was attributed to the BODIPY central unit. Although a residue of porphyrin and DPP emissions was also noticed at 600 nm and 650 nm, this phenomenon was good evidence of efficient EnTs taking place within the materials. This is even more supported by the very good match between excitation and absorption spectra when the emission observation window was fixed in the BODIPY fluorescence. Indeed, the excitation spectra of BD-pPor and BD-tPor featured porphyrin, DPP and BODIPY transitions with well-proportioned intensities. In thin films, only BODIPY fluorescence was visible for each SM, meaning that EnT efficiencies are even exacerbated at the solid state (Fig. S3c and d†). It is noteworthy that emission spectra are not excitation wavelength-dependent. Indeed, selective excitation of porphyrin (λex = 425 nm), simultaneous excitation of DPP and porphyrin (λex = 555 nm), and excitation of BODIPY (λex = 685 nm) all lead to superimposable emission spectra.
Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine frontier orbital energy levels. Electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1 and voltammograms are shown in Fig. S4† (solid state) and Fig. S5† (in solution studies). According to the absorption spectra (Fig. 1), the lowest transition energy is attributed to the BODIPY, so information about its HOMO and LUMO levels is thus needed. A first reduction wave corresponding to extended BODIPY moieties was noticed at −1.06 eV and −1.01 eV for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, which corresponds to the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) of −3.74 eV and −3.79 eV, respectively. Unfortunately, the oxidation process corresponding to BODIPY is overlapped with porphyrin and DPP oxidation waves so the corresponding potential could not be determined from the CV curves. For this reason, we have derived the values of E0–0 from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra in thin films which are about 1.65 eV and 1.57 eV for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively. The corrected HOMO energy level ECorrHOMO was estimated from the expression: ECorrHOMO = ELUMO − E0–0 and the values of ECorrHOMO are −5.39 eV and −5.36 eV for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively.

We have theoretically studied the BD-pPor and BD-tPor structures within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). For both DFT and TD-DFT computations, we employed the gradient corrected functional PBE,41 the hybrid functional B3LYP,42,43 and the meta-hybrid functional M06.44 Technical details on the computations are provided in the ESI (Tables S1 and S2†).
The structures consist of a central BODIPY that is symmetrically linked to two DPP moieties, and two porphyrins. The BODIPY and DPP groups are highly planar but with the mesityl group of BODIPY lying on a perpendicular plane. The porphyrins are linked to the main structures via phenyl and thiophene groups for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively. The plane of the porphyrins' mesityl groups is perpendicular to that of their respective porphyrins. The porphyrins form dihedral angles between 63 and 72° with the plane of the main structure (BODIPY and DPP).
The energy gaps calculated using the hybrid B3LYP functional are underestimated compared to the values obtained using the meta-hybrid M06 functional. For the HOMO–LUMO (HL) gap the values computed using B3LYP are lower by ∼0.32 eV and for the optical gaps by up to ∼0.16 eV. In Table 2 we also provide the character of the first allowed excitations only for contributions larger than 4%. The first excitation, as calculated by each of the functionals, clearly exhibits a single-configuration character. In Fig. 3 we have plotted the isosurfaces of the HOMO and LUMO of BD-pPor and BD-tPor. The HOMO of both structures extends mainly over the BODIPY and DPP moieties, and specifically for BD-tPor over the thiophene linker and slightly over the porphyrins. The LUMO is more highly localized over the BODIPY and slightly over the phenyl and thiophene linker groups for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively. The near HOMO levels from HOMO-2 down to HOMO-5, for BD-pPor, that are dominated by contributions from the porphyrins are involved in moderate to strong excitations of the UV/visible spectra. For BD-tPor these states correspond to HOMO-3 down to HOMO-4, as well as HOMO-2 and HOMO-5, which however are not dominated by contributions from the porphyrins.

The computed UV/visual absorbance spectra of BD-pPor and BD-tPor structures are calculated at the TD-DFT/M06 (see Fig. S23†) and the B3LYP level of theory. The spectra from the latter as well as technical details on the computations are provided in the ESI (Tables S1 and S2†). The spectra obtained from the two functionals are found to be in excellent agreement in terms of the form and range and are found to exhibit three prominent peaks for BD-pPor and four in the case of BD-tPor. The prominent peaks are located at about 445 nm, 643 nm and 775 nm for BD-pPor, and at 455 nm, 600 nm, 665 nm and 825 nm for BD-tPor. The positions of the peaks computed using the B3LYP functional are slightly redshifted, by ∼10–18 nm in the short wavelength region, and by ∼55 nm in the long wavelength region.
Both the theoretical and experimental values of HOMO and LUMO energy levels indicate that when each of the two donors are blended with PC71BM, there is a sufficient HOMO and LUMO offset between the electron donor and acceptor which provides the driving force for exciton dissociation and charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor and vice versa. The small values of the LUMO offset (0.36 eV and 0.31 eV for BD-pPor:PC71BM and BD-tPor:PC71BM) also cause a low voltage loss, which is the prerequisite for efficient OSCs and will be discussed in the later part of the manuscript.
As the LUMO offset in the donor and acceptor is quite low but more than the threshold value of 0.3 eV, in order to get information about the exciton dissociation and charge transfer at D/A interfaces in the active layer, we have recorded the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine donors and their blend with PC71BM thin films and shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from this figure that the PL intensity of the pristine donor (BD-pPor and BD-tPor) is significantly quenched when mixed with PC71BM, indicating an efficient photo-induced charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor and vice versa. It was observed that the PL quenching is slightly higher in the BD-tPor:PC71BM blend, which may be responsible for the higher values of Jsc in this device.

Photovoltaic properties
The OSCs were designed using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BD-pPor or BD-tPor:PC71BM/PFN/Al arrangement with an active layer thickness of 95 ± 5 nm, as described in the Experimental section. Both were optimized with respect to the weight ratio between the donor and PC71BM cast from THF solvent and found that the optimum weight ratio for donor:PC71BM is 1:1.5 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The OSC based on the as-cast BD-pPor:PC71BM (1:1.5) active layer showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.32% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 8.81 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.41. However, the BD-tPor:PC71BM (1:1.5) counterpart device showed a PCE of 4.73% with a Jsc of 10.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.97 V and an FF of 0.45. After the optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio in the blend active layer, we have adopted a solvent additive (small trace of diiodooctane) for the deposition of the active layer, but it did not improve the PCE of the OSCs. Therefore, in order to improve PCE further, we have adopted solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of the active layer using CS2 as reported in the literature.45Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 100 mW cm−2 illumination intensity of the OSCs based on SVA treated active layers and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The OSC based on BD-pPor:PC71BM exhibits a PCE of 6.67% along with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 12.43 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.61, whereas the BD-tPor:PC71BM based counterpart showed enhanced values of Jsc (14.32 mA cm−2), Voc (0.95 V), and FF (0.67) and a PCE value of 8.98%. The incident photons to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 5b. The IPCE spectra of the OSCs closely resemble the optical absorption spectra of the active layers as shown in Fig. S24† and show two bands, indicating that both PC71BM and small molecule donors contribute to the photocurrent generation. It can be seen from Fig. 5b that the IPCE values in the whole wavelength region are higher for BD-tPor:PC71BM OSCs than their BD-pPor:PC71BM counterpart and the photoresponse also extended towards the longer wavelength region which is in agreement with the higher value of Jsc. As a result of this, the value of Jsc for the BD-tPor:PC71BM based OSCs is higher than that for their BD-pPor:PC71BM counterpart. The values of Jsc estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra of BD-pPor:PC71BM and BD-tPor:PC71BM OSCs are about 12.32 mA cm−2 and 14.21 mA cm−2, respectively, and are very close to the values observed in the J–V characteristics of the OSCs. Although the HOMO energy level of BD-pPor is slightly deeper than that of BD-tPor, the Voc of the OSCs based on BD-tPor is higher than that for their BD-pPor based counterpart. This may be related to the low energy loss as will be discussed in the later part of the manuscript.

 Fig. 5  (a) Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination and (b) IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on optimized active layers using BD-pPor or BD-tPor as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor. 
In order to get information about the charge generation, recombination and extraction properties in the OSCs, the variation of photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) was measured and analyzed and is shown in Fig. 6. The Jph is given by Jph = JL−JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is the difference between Vo and Va, where Vo is defined as the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. It can be seen that Jph increases rapidly at low voltages and shows a plateau when Veff is around 0.41 V and 0.56 V for BD-tPor and BD-pPor, respectively and saturates at high Veff, indicating that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and the internal electric field plays a minor role during the charge extraction and the charge carriers are effectively extracted by the electrodes.
 Fig. 6  Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for OSCs based on optimized active layers using BD-pPor and BD-tPor as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor. 
The values of the exciton dissociation and charge collection probability (PC) in the OSCs can be estimated from Jph/Jphsat, where Jphsat is the saturation photocurrent density. PC values under short circuit and maximum power point conditions are 0.91 and 0.68 for the BD-pPor:PC71BM based OSC and 0.96 and 0.71 for its BD-tPor:PC71BM counterpart. The higher values of PC indicate that the BD-tPor:PC71BM based OSC exhibits higher exciton dissociation and more efficient charge collection efficiency compared to the BD-pPor:PC71BM based OSC. The more efficient exciton dissociation in BD-tPor:PC71BM than BD-pPor:PC71BM is also confirmed from the PL quenching (Fig. 4). The value of Jph saturates at lower values of Veff for BD-tPor:PC71BM than that for BD-pPor:PC71BM, which indicates that a lower value of the internal effective electric field is needed for charge extraction for the device based on BD-tPor:PC71BM than that for BD-pPor:PC71BM. It was observed that the as-cast devices do not show this saturation region even at the highest value of Veff and Jph keeps on increasing with Veff. At high Veff, the value of Jph for the as-cast devices is almost the same as that for their SVA counterpart, indicating that the small value of Jsc observed for the as-cast devices does not originate from the charge generation issues, but from a poor extraction of charge carriers at the electrodes. The strong electric field is not sufficient for charge extraction, and the charges recombine before reaching the electrode due to the poor nanoscale morphologies.
The charge transport characteristics were investigated using a space charge limited current model to measure the hole and electron mobilities in the blend films. The J–V characteristics of the hole only and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. The estimated hole and electron mobilities are displayed in Table 4. In BD-tPor:PC71BM both hole and electron mobilities are higher than those for BD-pPor:PC71BM. The ratio of electron to hole mobility (μe/μh) for BD-tPor:PC71BM (1.53) is smaller than that for BD-pPor:PC71BM (2.14). Therefore, a more balanced charge carrier transport in the BD-tPor:PC71BM blend may be one of the reasons for the higher FF.

We have also investigated the charge recombination behavior by measuring the variation of Jsc and Voc with illumination intensity (Pin) and shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. The variation of Jsc with Pin can be described as Jsc ∝ P∝in. If all the charge carriers are swept out and collected by the electrodes proceeding to recombination, then the value of α approaches unity, whereas the smaller value of α indicates a competition between the recombination and charge carrier recombination and also represents the level of bimolecular recombination.46 The value of α estimated from Fig. 8a for the optimized OSCs based on BD-pPor and BD-tPor is 0.91 and 0.95, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular recombination in the latter device is more efficiently suppressed, which might be one of the reasons for the superior value of FF in the BD-tPor based OSC. The observed values of α for the as-cast devices are 0.81 and 0.84 for BD-pPor and BD-tPor, respectively, indicating substantial bimolecular recombination losses.
 Fig. 8  Variation of Jsc and Voc with illumination intensity for the OSCs based on optimized active layers using BD-pPor and BD-tPor as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor. 
The variation of Voc with Pin is shown in Fig. 8b in semi-log plots. In an ideal case, the slope of Vocversus Pin should be equal to kT/q, if bimolecular recombination is dominant. If Voc is strongly dependent on Pin then the slope would be greater than kT/q as implied by extra interfacial trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) theory.47,48 We observed that the slope for the BD-pPor and BD-tPor based OSCs is 1.34 kT/q and 1.18 kT/q, respectively, suggesting that using BD-tPor as a donor reduces the mono-molecular SRH recombination and resulted in an improvement in Jsc, FF and overall PCE.
It is well established that the morphology of the active layer plays an important role in the performance of the OSCs, which affects the exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination. Therefore, the morphology of the active layers was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. 9. Compared to the BD-pPor:PC71BM blend, the BD-tPor:PC71BM blend showed clear nano-fibril and phase separation within the whole film, which is favorable for charge transport. As a result of this, the BD-tPor:PC71BM based OSC showed higher PCE as compared to its BD-pPor:PC71BM counterpart.

The optimized active layers were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen from this figure that both the blends showed the same diffraction peak located at 2θ = 4.61° which was attributed to the lamellar stacking with a d spacing of 2.04 nm. The intensity of this peak is stronger for BD-tPor:PC71BM than BD-pPor:PC71BM which indicates that the BD-tPor:PC71BM active layer shows higher crystallinity than BD-pPor:PC71BM. A wider diffraction peak was observed at 2θ = 22.54° and 22.98° for BD-pPor:PC71BM and BD-tPor:PC71BM, respectively, and was attributed to the π–π stacking with a distance of 45 nm and 41 nm, respectively. In addition to these two peaks, a weak and broad diffraction peak was observed around 2θ = 18.22° in both the active layers, corresponding to PC71BM. The stronger lamellar peak and lower π–π stacking distance in BD-tPor:PC71BM may lead to higher hole mobility than that for BD-pPor:PC71BM, which would be expected to give rise to higher Jsc and FF values in the resulting OSCs. These results are consistent with higher values of Jsc and FF for the OSC based on the BD-tPor:PC71BM active layer.

It is well known that the Voc of OSCs is directly proportional to the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor employed in the BHJ active layer.49 The energy loss (ΔEloss) in the OSCs is very important for high efficiency OSCs and expresses the lower limit of the energy loss per photon, when converting its energy into electrical energy. The Eloss is expressed as ΔEloss = Eoptg − qVoc, where Eoptg is the optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor material employed in the active layer, whichever is smaller and q is the elementary charge.50–52 For the OSC based on optimized BD-pPor:PC71BM, the Voc is 0.88 V and Eoptg refers to the optical band gap of BD-pPor (1.52 eV); therefore the Eloss is 0.64 eV. In contrast for BD-tPor:PC71BM based OSCs, a Voc of 0.95 was obtained indicating a much lower Eloss of 0.50 eV. It can be seen that the Eloss value for the BD-tPor:PC71BM blend is the lowest among those for the OSCs based on small molecules as donors with a high PCE approaching 9%. This value of Eloss is close to the values for perovskites53,54 and OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors.55 Such unexpected small Eloss observed for BD-tPor:PC71BM based OSCs may be in part due to the small LUMO offset between BD-tPor and PC71BM (0.31 eV). This small LUMO offset, i.e. driving force, may enhance the IPCE value and reduce the Eloss by decreasing the non-radiative recombination loss.56
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two novel SMs consisting of a BODIPY central core surrounded by two DPP and two porphyrin units. Both SMs have similar chemical structures except that the porphyrin units are linked to the BODIPY unit through phenyl (BD-pPor) and thiophene (BD-tPor). After the investigation of their optical properties, we found that efficient energy transfer processes were taking place within these materials from both porphyrins and DPPs toward the central BODIPY unit, and electrochemical studies further confirmed that the two SMs were suitable as donors along with a PC71BM acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction OSCs. After the optimization of the active layers, i.e. the weight ratio between donor SMs and PC71BM and SVA treatment conditions, the OSCs based on BD-pPor and BD-tPor exhibited overall PCEs of 6.67% and 8.98% with an energy loss of 0.63 eV and 0.50 eV. To the best of our knowledge, these results are among the highest efficiencies recorded for donor materials based on one or a combination of two of these dyes (i.e., BODIPY, DPP and porphyrin). The low value of energy loss for BD-tPor may be related to the low value of the LUMO offset between the BD-tPor and PC71BM (0.31 eV) as compared to that between BD-pPor and PC71BM (0.36 eV). The low energy loss also leads to a higher value of open circuit voltage for the BD-tPor based OSC than its BD-pPor counterpart, despite the slightly deeper HOMO energy level of BD-pPor. The enhanced values of Jsc and FF of the BD-tPor based OSCs may be related to the better exciton dissociation and charge transport, as confirmed form the PL spectra and charge carrier mobility. We believe that these results highlight that SM scaffolds based on BODIPY, DPP and porphyrin are very promising for the development of new efficient donor materials. The most straightforward and simple synthetic routes should be considered to design structures which combine two or three of these chromophores, while preserving the full potential of the dyes, whether through the complementarity of their absorption properties or by using them as efficient energy transfer partners.

Electrochemistry

BD-pPor and BD-tPor were drop-cast (3 μL) on a 2 mm diameter platinum disk electrode from chloroform solution (5 mg mL−1) to form thin films. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a three-electrode cell against a saturated calomel reference electrode in a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 1 V s−1 and using a platinum wire as the counter electrode. All voltammograms were calibrated afterwards against the Fc+/Fc redox couple recorded in a MeCN solution following the same experimental parameters. Cyclic voltammograms and differential pulse voltammetry curves of BD-pPor and BD-tPor were recorded in CH2Cl2 0.1 M TBAPF6 at ν = 100 mV s−1 and 10 mV s−1 respectively with a 1 mm diameter platinum working electrode (WE), a platinum wire and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). Under these conditions, ferrocene was oxidized at 0.46 V/SCE.
Calculations
The initial geometry optimization calculations were performed employing the gradient corrected functional PBE of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof.41 The def-SVP basis set was used for all of the calculations.57 At this stage of the calculations, to increase the computational efficiency (without loss in accuracy), the resolution of the identity method was used for the treatment of the two-electron integrals.58 Subsequent geometry optimizations were further performed using the hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP,42,43 as well as Truhlar's meta-hybrid exchange-correlation functional M06,44 and the same basis set. Tight convergence criteria were placed for the SCF energy (up to 10−7 Eh) and the one-electron density (rms of the density matrix up to 10−8) as well as for the norm of the Cartesian gradient (residual forces both average and maximum smaller than 1.5 × 10−5 a.u.) and residual displacements (both average and maximum smaller than 6 × 10−5 a.u.). Solvent effects were included for chloroform (CF) using the integral equation formalism variant of the Polarizable Continuum Model (IEFPCM), as implemented in the Gaussian package.59 TD-DFT excited state calculations were performed to calculate the optical gaps of BD-pPor and BD-tPor using the same functional and basis set on the corresponding ground state structures. The UV/vis spectra were calculated using the M06 functional. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with HWHM = 0.14 eV centered at the excitation wavenumbers. The M06 meta-hybrid functional was chosen since it provides leveled performance over transition types.60,61 We provide results using all three functionals, which can additionally be used for comparison with the literature. The first round of geometry optimizations was performed using the Turbomole package.62 All of the follow up calculations were performed using the Gaussian package.59 The first round of calculations was the geometry optimizations of the BD-pPor and BD-tPor structures. To increase the computational efficiency, the alkyl groups were truncated to ethyl groups. Vibrational analysis on all of the optimized structures did not reveal any vibrational modes with imaginary eigenfrequencies, i.e. the final optimized structure is a true local (if not global) minimum.
Device fabrication and characterization
The solution-processed OSCs were fabricated using the conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were first cleaned inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with acetone, followed by deionized water and isopropanol, and finally dried in an oven at 40 °C for 2 h. After drying, a 40 nm-thin PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P AI4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and dried by baking in a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight. The active layers, that is, donor:PC71BM in different weight ratios, were deposited onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by casting from the THF solution and dried under ambient conditions. The solvent vapour annealing (SVA) treatment was performed as follows: the optimized donor:PC71BM (1:1.5) active layer was placed in a glass Petri dish containing 1 mL of CS2 for 30 s. Then, a poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) solution in methanol, containing a small trace of acetic acid, was spin-coated on the top of the active layer to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm. Finally, a thin aluminium (Al) layer with a thickness of 90 nm was thermally evaporated with a shadow mask at a low pressure of ∼10−6 Torr. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined the active area, which was measured to be 16 mm2. The fabrication of the devices was performed at room temperature. A Keithley Source Meter was used to measure the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells under ambient conditions and under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices through a monochromated light source (wavelength range 300–900 nm). The resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions. To measure the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers, a “hole and electron” only device (i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al, respectively) was built, and the current–voltage characteristics in the dark were measured.
