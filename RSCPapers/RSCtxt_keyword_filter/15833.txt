, Accepted 14th July 2014First published on 14th July 2014AbstractA voltammetric technique was used to produce a thin coating of polyaniline nanofibers (PANINFs) on ITO-coated glass substrates. Thereafter, bismuth sulfide nanoparticles (Bi2S3NPs) were chemically deposited on the PANINFs layer. The composite films were firmly adhered to the substrate and uniformly distributed. The films were characterized by optical, electron microscopic and electrochemical techniques to identify their possible applications in liquid junction solar cells. The functional properties of the bare Bi2S3NPs were increased considerably by using PANINFs as the support materials in the composite matrix. The study of the electrochemical polarization of the synthesized films and subsequent anodic stripping voltammetry enabled the extent of the degradation of the films during polarization to be determined. Electrochemical studies revealed the n-type character of the composite film, which exhibited a substantially higher photo-conversion efficiency than the pure Bi2S3NPs film.
1. Introduction
Compound semiconductor films comprising group V–VI elements such as Bi2S3 are attracting intense interest, because of their excellent photosensitive and thermoelectric properties1–3 that arise from the narrow band gap energy, which is tuned to the solar energy conversion spectrum. Such films can be fabricated by various techniques, including chemical bath deposition, thermal techniques, spray pyrolysis, solvothermal processes, and electrodeposition.1–9 On the other hand, the physicochemical properties of polyaniline (PANI) has been the subject of intense study for more than a decade, because of its technological importance as a support material in solar energy conversion, sensors, rechargeable batteries and other applications,10–17 as well as for its anti-degradation properties.18,19 Electrochemical oxidative techniques have become popular for controlled synthesis of PANI nanostructures. The formation of PANI is strongly affected by the removal of unreacted oxidized species,20 which may undergo hydrolysis leading to polymer degradation.
In the present study, periodic voltammetry was used to grow high-quality PANI films because it offers a short exposure time at the anodic potential and enables the reduction of the unreacted oxidized species during the cathodic scan. In view of the various advantages of using PANI as a support material for energy conversion materials and the photo-characteristics of Bi2S3, we aimed to develop composite PANI/Bi2S3 films containing different amounts of PANI. PANI thin films were prepared under variable voltammetric cycles and Bi2S3 was deposited chemically on the polymeric films. The synthesized conducting polymer-semiconductor (CP/SC) composite films were subjected to various characterization techniques to determine their structural, morphological, optical and electrochemical features. In order to ascertain the stability of the composite materials to anodic disintegration, the films were initially subjected to anodic polarization by a potentiodynamic technique and the electrochemical corrosion parameters were evaluated through Tafel analysis. Subsequently, the amount of metal ions dissolved during the oxidation processes was estimated by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) of the electrolytic solutions. Finally, the photoelectrochemical characteristics of the films were obtained from the current–potential measurements under illumination.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of PANI–Bi2S3 composite films
Polymer films were grown on indium-doped SnO2 (ITO)-coated glass slides from an electrochemical bath containing 0.2 M H2SO4, 0.1 M aniline and 0.5% TX-100 by voltammetry within a potential window of 0–1.0 V under controlled multiple scans (250–1500) at a scan rate of 0.5 V s−1. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a three-electrode assembly cell comprising a conducting glass substrate as the working electrode, aqueous saturated calomel electrode (SCE (W)) as the reference electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode. All measurements were recorded with an AUTOLAB 12 PG Stat Ecochemie BV (Netherlands).
Thereafter, the Bi2S3NPs were chemically deposited on the PANI films by immersing the PANI-coated slides in solution containing 0.02 M Bi(NO3)3, 0.01 M TEA, 0.02 M Na2S2O3 and HNO3 and the solution was stirred by a magnetic stirrer for 1 h while maintaining the bath temperature at 100–110 °C. The thickness of the composite film was monitored gravimetrically and the conductivity at room temperature was also evaluated by four-probe measurements.
2.2. Spectroscopic measurement, structural analysis, surface morphology, and photo-luminescence study
The band gap of each of the films was determined through UV spectroscopy. The transmittance spectrum covered the range 400 to 1100 nm for each of the as-deposited films during measurements in a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Japan). The molecular structure of PANI films grown during the voltammetric cycles were measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, with a JASCO FT/IR-460 Plaus spectrophotometer operated with 4 cm−1 resolution in the range 2000 to 600 cm−1.
The morphology of the films was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a JEOL JSM-6700F FESEM microscope. A Philips PW 1710 X-ray diffractometer was used to study the crystallinity of the film matrix by using CuKα radiation with a wavelength of 1.542 Å. The X-ray machine was operated at 25 kV and 20 mA within a range of 2θ angles between 20° to 90° and a 2θ increment of 0.02°. The photoluminescence spectra of the PANINFs and PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composites were taken with an excitonic wavelength of 375 nm, using a Horiba FL 322 Jobinyvon spectrofluorometer with a Xe lamp source.
2.3. Study of the inherent stability of the composite films
In order to ascertain the resistive power of the films towards anodic dissolution in an aqueous environment, potentiodynamic polarization studies were carried out with an AUTOLAB 12 PG-stat, Eco-Chemie BV (Netherlands). A standard three-electrode one-compartment cell was used with the SC film-coated glass substrate as the working electrode with an exposed surface area of 1 cm2, a SCE (W) reference electrode and a large area platinum foil counter electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded for the working solutions containing 0.1 M NaClO4 as a supporting electrolyte in the potential range of −1.0 to +1.0 V vs. SCE (W) with a slow scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The corresponding Tafel plots were analyzed to evaluate the anodic corrosion parameters, such as the corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (Icorr) and corrosion rate (Rcorr) for each of the films.21
The working solutions from the electrolytic bath were subjected to anodic stripping voltammetry to estimate the amount of Bi3+ dissolved in the medium.5,21,22 Voltammetric–amperometric (VA) measurements were carried out with a Metrohm Ltd. 663 VA Trace Analyzer (Switzerland) combined with an AUTOLAB 30 PG-stat by the standard addition procedure using a hanging mercury drop (drop size 0.20 mm2) electrode (HMDE) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl [3 M KCl] as the reference electrode and a large area glassy carbon counter electrode in an inert atmosphere by purging with XL grade N2.
2.4. Characterization of electrode–solution interface
In order to obtain information on the interfacial characteristics of the films, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were carried out at room temperature with AUTOLAB 12 PG-stat, Eco-Chemie BV (Netherlands) combined with a frequency response analyzer (FRA). A standard three-electrode cell with the configuration (ITO) PANI-Bi2S3/S2−–Sx2−, 0.5 M/Pt and a SCE reference electrode were used. The impedance spectra at the respective open circuit potentials in 0.5 M Na2Sx electrolyte were recorded while applying a sinusoidal perturbation with an amplitude of 5 mV at the working electrode (SC) over a frequency range of 0.1 to 10 MHz and under 50 mW cm−2 illumination. The corresponding Nyquist plots were analyzed to evaluate the equivalent circuit (EC) parameters. Capacitance measurements of the semiconductor electrode in contact with the 0.5 M aqueous S2−–Sx2− electrolyte were performed using the same experimental set up with an oscillator frequency of 1 kHz in dark conditions. The semiconductor characteristics and donor densities were determined from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots.
2.5. Transient photoresponse and current–voltage characteristics
The photoresponse of the films was recorded in terms of the rise and decay curves of the short-circuit current (Isc) with a similar cell setup to that used during EIS measurements under an illumination of 50 mW cm−2 using a 1 kW tungsten filament light source. The photo-conversion efficiency was derived from the current–voltage (I–V) measurements taken under the same light intensity in a typical photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell containing electroplated SC-CP films as the anode and Pt as the cathode in 0.5 M Na2Sx.
3. Results and discussion
Electrochemical polymerization of aniline occurs with the simultaneous insertion of HSO4− anions (dopant) into the CP matrix from the electrolytic solution by the following reaction.(PANI)n + nyHSO4− → [PANIy+(HSO4−)]n + nye−where ‘y’ is the doping degree, which is the ratio between the number of charges in the polymer and the number of monomer units.23 Fig. 1 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the polyaniline deposition where the first well defined anodic peak (A) at a potential of 0.2 V (SCE) indicates the transition of the leucoemeraldine form of polyaniline to the emeraldine salt. The second anodic peak, B at 0.5 V (SCE) has been attributed either to the presence of ortho-coupled polymers or to the degradation of PANI to soluble species, such as benzoquinone and hydroquinone.24 The oxidation peak C at the highest potential at 0.7 V (vs. SCE) corresponds to the further oxidation of PANI, from emeraldine to nigraniline. Two subsequent steps involved in the electrochemical polymerization of aniline are the formation of the polyaniline nuclei and their growth. Once the nucleation starts, continuous growth proceeds through autocatalytic oxidation of aniline25,26 and the film growth increases with the increasing number of periodic scans, as shown in the thickness profile in Fig. 2. Periodic voltammetry provides a better way of producing more conductive, thicker films, because the retention of hydrolysis products in the PANI deposits can be avoided during the reverse scan. The conductivity of the CP/SC composite films was decreased compared with pure PANI films, due to the incorporation of low conducting Bi2S3 into the matrix. The conductivity was also found to depend on the number of scans and the optimum value was obtained at 500 cycles. It was also observed that the oxidation current increases with the periodic scan and the anodic peak potentials were gradually shifted to positive values with increasing cycle number.27

In the present heterogeneous system of PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composites, the loading of Bi2S3NPs in the matrix has been taken into consideration. Bare ITO has a loading of 0.14 mg cm−2 of NPs, which is increased almost four times (0.57 mg cm−2) when the NPs are grown on a PANI surface deposited over 250 periodic cycles. The most obvious explanation is that the surface area and the number of active sites increases on the PANI surface. The narrow distribution of NPs became more favorable when PANI was deposited with continuous chain formation for less than 500 cycles and the loading was increased to 0.98 mg cm−2. Beyond this range of periodic voltammetry the loading remains almost invariant up to 1500 cycles. This may be because further active sites are not created by the lateral growth (branching) of the matrix, as the SEM studies show (discussed below). For 500 cycles, both a narrow NP distribution and the maximum conductivity of the NFs are achieved, as shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 3i shows the typical transmittance (%T) spectrum of the film grown on a TCO-coated glass substrate. For pure Bi2S3 films the absorption peak occurs at around 683 nm (Eg = 1.81 eV) and for the composite PANI/SC film the band gap showed a maximum blue shift at Eg = 2.43 eV, attributed to the presence of high energy PANI material (inset, Fig. 3i). Thus, the composite matrix can be tuned to the desired band gap region by optimizing the PANI/Bi2S3 blending ratio.

Fig. 3ii displays the FTIR transmission spectra of the pure Bi2S3 and PANI/Bi2S3 composite films and the data are summarized in Table 1. The band observed at 770 cm−1 in pure Bi2S3 film is assigned to the metal (Bi)–sulphur (S) interaction,28 which is present in the PANI/Bi2S3 composite films regime. Similarly, the resonance interactions between vibrational modes of sulphur ions29 are visible around 947–990 cm−1 for the entire set of films. The band occurring at 1273 cm−1 in the pure Bi2S3 film, corresponding to charge delocalization, is shifted to 1250 cm−1 for PANI/Bi2S3 films,30 whereas the bands at 1500 and 1585 cm−1 are attributed to the C–N stretching of the benzenoid and quinoid ring of PANI, respectively. The ratio of the quinoid to benzenoid absorption peaks was used to derive the extent of the oxidation of the polymer (Fig. 2). The extent of oxidation remains almost unchanged across the PANI film regime and does not affect the conductivity of the PANI film. The observed changes in the FTIR spectra of PANI/Bi2S3 films mostly centre around the C–N stretching frequency, thereby suggesting strong coupling and interactions of the Bi2S3 crystallites with the imine nitrogen in the conducting polymer.30

Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure Bi2S3, PANI and PANI/Bi2S3NPs composites. The Bragg's diffraction peaks of 2θ ∼ 25.15° and ∼45.30° can be found in the polyaniline as well as in the PANI/Bi2S3 composite matrix.31,32 The peaks at 27.11° (021), 37.97° (041) and 39.93° (141) indicate the formation of Bi2S3 on the PANI matrix.33 The XRD patterns of the composite films do not show any change in peak position and shape compared with the pure Bi2S3 films, which indicates that the PANI support material does not affect the lattice structure of Bi2S3. By using the intense peak indexed at 2θ = 27.11, which corresponds to Bi2S3, the size of the crystallites was calculated using Scherer's equation,34 and was found to be 3–5 nm.

Typical SEM images of the Bi2S3 film and PANI are presented in Fig. 5. The pure Bi2S3 (Fig. 5e) film maintains a homogeneous compact microcrystalline structure and is composed of spherically shaped agglomerates with grain sizes of 15–30 nm. The polyaniline films are composed of interwoven nano-fibers (NFs), with diameters of 60–200 nm (Fig. 5a–d). The size of the PANINFs can be controlled by the number of periodic scans and the average diameter of the PANINFs (Fig. 5b) is 80 nm at 500 cycles. However, at low numbers of periodic scans, the density of the PANINFs is much lower, as shown in Fig. 5a. Polyaniline catalyzes the oxidation of its monomer,25,26 and the polymer chain grows longitudinally with close packing with the increase in the number of periodic scans, leading to the increase in film thickness. Thus, when the cycle number increases from 250 to 500, the continuity of the polymeric chain increases the surface area and the effect of conjugation, facilitating electron transport throughout the entire fiber membrane, which results in higher conductivity. At cycle numbers greater than 500, the lateral growth of nanofibers occurs through extensive branching of the fiber chains, ultimately hampering the continuity of the fiber matrix (Fig. 5c and d). Therefore, the degree of conjugation is reduced and the conductivity decreases (Fig. 2). Fig. 5f shows that spherical Bi2S3NPs are grown in clusters on the porous PANINFs.

Photoluminescence (PL) emissions mainly result from the recombination of free carriers, thus PL spectra are useful for measuring the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers in a semiconductor,35,36 The higher the PL intensity, the greater the probability of charge carrier recombination.37 A comparison of the PL spectra (excited at 375 nm) of bare PANINFs and the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composite at room temperature is shown in Fig. 6. The PL spectrum contains one strong peak at 629 nm that can be assigned to a high-level transition in Bi2S3NP semiconductor crystallites. It was found that the PL emission intensity of the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composite was dramatically weakened compared with that of bare Bi2S3NPs, clearly demonstrating that the recombination process can be effectively controlled in the composite matrix. Furthermore, the emission peak at 475 nm for PANI is red-shifted to a lower energy and its intensity decreases in the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composite matrix. Therefore, the coupling of PANINFs and Bi2S3NPs is helpful for separating the photogenerated charge carriers, which in effect triggers the charge transfer process at a faster rate on a set of the selected composite matrix. This is discussed in full during the analysis of the EIS parameters.

Tafel plots derived from the potentiodynamic polarization studies of the SC films in aqueous medium are shown in Fig. 7a and were used to evaluate the corrosion parameters. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2, along with the corrosion rates obtained in terms of the extent of the mass loss, (kg cm−2 s−1 (w/t)) arrived at using Faraday's laws.4 The intersection of the tangents to the cathodic and anodic branches of the curves yielded the corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (Icorr), as observed in Fig. 7a (inset). In order to ascertain the stability of the SC materials towards electrochemical degradation, without the interference of extraneous redox processes, the anodic polarization of the films was carried out in pure water in the absence of a redox system. The effect of PANINFs on the Bi2S3 nanoparticles (NPs) is clearly visible in Fig. 7a. Fabrication of the PANI matrix for a moderate number of periodic scans imparts reasonable stability to the films. This can be attributed to the strong interaction between Bi2S3NPs and the high conductivity of PANINFs (identified in the IR spectrum). The corrosion rates (Rcorr) were reduced by 3.4 times, from 2.993 × 10−8 to 0.889 × 10−8 kg cm−2 s−1 for the PANI film deposited by 500 periodic scans. For a greater number of scans, the conductivity of the PANINFs decreased and the corrosion rate increased. The Tafel plots reflect the typical transpassive character of the films, wherein a distinct passive region could be identified, presumably because of the formation of insoluble Bi oxides and hydroxides in an aqueous environment.

Fig. 7b shows a typical I–V plot derived from the anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) performed with the working solution immediately after the polarization study. Well-defined peaks corresponding to the oxidation Bi0 → Bi3+ were obtained at −0.04 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl. Fig. 7c shows a typical current–concentration plot derived from the ASV and the amount of Bi3+ produced during anodic polarization was evaluated using equation. 
ip = 2.69 × 105 × A × D1/2 × C0 × n3/2 × v1/2
(1)where ip is the peak current, A is the surface area of the Hg drop (mm2), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), C0 is the bulk concentration of the analyte (mol L−1), n is the number of electron transfers during the charge transfer process and v is the scan rate (V s−1).21 The amounts of Bi3+ estimated from the anodic polarization studies of the SC films are summarized in Table 2. Previous studies have shown that the conductivity of the PANINFs films increases with the number of periodic scan and approaches a maximum in between 250 and 500 cycles. Therefore, the PANINF–Bi2S3NP interaction increases (as discussed in the IR study) in this range and prevents Bi from leaching out of the matrix. This was also confirmed by the ASV data. However, a further increase in the number of multiple scans increased the amount of Bi again in the working electrolyte, indicating a weak interaction between the PANINFs and Bi2S3NPs.
The M–S plots for different films were obtained by impedance spectroscopy using a typical PEC cell configured as [ITO glass/PANINFs–Bi2S3NPs/S2−–Sx2−/Pt] at a frequency of 1 kHz. The M–S equation4 was used to derive useful information regarding the carrier concentration (ND), the type of the conductivity and the other characteristic properties of the SC–electrolyte junction of the PEC cell. The M–S parameters are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 8 represents the M–S plots where the positive slopes confirmed the n-type semiconductivity of the films. The variation in the slopes of the M–S plots for different films indicates different barrier heights for the PEC anode. Furthermore, it is predicted that the nonlinearity in the plots reflects the formation of a graded junction at the electrode–electrolyte interface because of the combination of various factors, such as the band edge effect, a nonplanar interface, specific adsorption, surface roughness and uneven doping. The maximum population density (ND) of the carrier species is attained for the film deposited with 500 periodic scans. It may be predicted that, in this particular film, the carrier concentration partially contributes to the optimized space-charge properties and also enhances the conductivity of the material, as reflected in the higher electrical performance. The flat band potential of a semiconductor (SC) material makes a significant contribution to explaining the ease of interfacial charge transfer across the interface of a liquid junction solar cell, which, in effect, equates to the extent of band bending. For an n-type semiconductor, in particular, this potential may be taken as the onset potential of the anodic oxidation of a redox species across the SC–electrolyte interface. Therefore, during polarization, the increase in the negative value of the flat band indicates the lowering of the overpotential for the oxidation reaction. Of the films in this study, the maximum negative shift in the flat band potential was observed for the Bi2S3NPs material prepared on PANINFs deposited for 500 cycles. Therefore, this material is expected to exhibit better photocharacteristics, which was further demonstrated through the Nyquist and I–V measurements.

The double layer characteristics developed across the SC/0.5 M Na2Sx electrolyte interface were also shown by the Nyquist plots (Fig. 9) recorded during the impedance measurements. The impedance data were analyzed based upon the simple EC model consisting of several circuit components (inset Fig. 9). The circuit included solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer impedance (Rct) and a constant phase element (CPE) which approximates the double layer capacitance for the SC–redox electrolyte interface. CPE, in fact, represents a non-ideal capacitor and takes into account the effect of the heterogeneous nature of the SC surface, and the diffusion process associated with charge transfer reactions and specific adsorption of different species on the SC films.38,39 It is expected that a material with a lower Rct and moderate capacitance would be suitable for use as a photoanode in PEC cells, because of its ability to transport charges through carriers and store the requisite amount of charge in the space charge region.1,38 The EC parameters of the SC films are summarized in Table 3. In fact, SC films with low values of Rct and high values of CPE are generally considered suitable as light absorbing materials in PEC cells because of their ability to conduct charge carriers and store charges in the space charge region.1 However, as the concentration of PANINFs on the Bi2S3NPs matrix increases, the charge transfer resistance decreases and approaches the lowest Rct value for PANINFs(500)/Bi2S3NPs, and also shows a moderately high capacitance value compared with the other films.

In Fig. 10a, an instantaneous photo response is shown for the rise and decay curves of the photocurrent (Isc) during successive exposures of the films to illuminated and dark conditions. Variation of Isc with time found to obey the equation. 
Isc(t) = Isc(0)t−b
(2)where Isc(t) and Isc(0) are the short-circuit current at time t and 0 s, respectively, and b is the decay constant. The short circuit current output is also found to exhibit higher values of Isc for the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs film obtained after 500 periodic scans, in comparison to the Isc values of the other films. The long-term stability of the films in the PEC cell system was ascertained from the current density profile (Fig. 10, inset) under dark and illuminated conditions for the PANINFs(500)/Bi2S3NPs composite matrix. The curves clearly display a much higher current density under exposure to light than in the dark. There is no significant change in current density even after 300 s under illumination. This further confirms the superior stability of the photoanode material prepared with 500 periodic scans.

The inset shows the current density profile under dark and illuminated conditions for the PANINFs (500)/Bi2S3NPs composite matrix. 
The performance of the photo-conversion efficiency of the SC films was tested by I–V measurements under a light intensity of 50 mW cm−2. The power output characteristics of typical PEC cells containing the deposited films as the anode component were demonstrated by the I–V curves (Fig. 11), which simultaneously recorded the open circuit potentials (Voc) and short circuit currents (Isc). The power conversion efficiency (η%) and fill factor (%FF) derived from these plots are summarized in Table 3. Pure Bi2S3 shows a photo-conversion efficiency of 1.04%, which increases with the amount of the PANI support. The considerable value of Isc (5.94 mA cm−2) for the composite films deposited over 500 cycles corresponded to a fill factor of 33.60% and a conversion efficiency of 2.33%, which is more than twice the value obtained without the PANINFs support. The synergy between the photosensitivity of the NPs and the electron transport through the polymeric chain occurs for the film deposited over 500 cycles, which shows the optimum photo-conversion efficiency. The inset in Fig. 11 shows the power density curves of pure Bi2S3NPs and PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs photocatalyst films, in which the superior power output features of the film appeared at 500 cycles. The curves corroborate all the PEC characteristics of these films determined by the other experimental techniques.

In Fig. 12 the potential performance of the PANI-supported film obtained in the scan range of 500–1000 cycles was demonstrated by several characteristic features of the electrode and electrode–solution interface, such as charge transfer resistance, flat band potential of the composite matrix, short circuit current and efficiency of the PEC cell containing the composite matrix as a photoanode. Fig. 13 shows that Isc is a linear function of the incident light intensity for all the films. It is also evident that at a particular light intensity, the PANINFs(500)/Bi2S3NPs matrix shows much higher Isc than all the other films studied. The slope derived from this intensity-modulated plot is important for the kinetics of the charge transfer reaction occurring at the SC/electrolyte interface under illuminated conditions. The higher slope values for the composite containing PANI deposited for 500–1000 cycles translates to the higher photocatalytic activity of these materials for the PEC performance. It implies that for the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs composite materials the rapid charge separation of the electron hole pair is immediately followed by the redox process without a great probability of recombination.

4. Summary and conclusion
PANINFs were obtained electrochemically without the need for any templates, simply by controlling the polymerization kinetics through periodic voltammetric scans. Subsequently, nanocrystallites of n-type Bi2S3 semiconductors were grown on the PANI matrix through the chemical bath deposition technique. All the synthesized composite films containing different amounts of PANI had low band gap energies of 1.81–2.43 eV, and are attractive candidates for solar energy conversion materials. It was found that the photo-conversion efficiency of the PANINFs/Bi2S3NPs film is twice that of the bare Bi2S3 film matrix. The electrochemical characterizations and I–V measurements suggest that the optimal PEC characteristics are obtained for the composite containing a PANI matrix deposited over 500–1000 periodic cycles. The films had superior electrical performance, moderate ND values, low charge transfer resistance and an appreciable photo-conversion efficiency.
