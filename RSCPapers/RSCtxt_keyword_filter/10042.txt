    , Accepted 9th February 2019First published on 11th February 2019AbstractA polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) was synthesized from a small-molecule one (MIL, the monomer), and they were used as cathode interlayers in organic solar cells. Compared with the MIL, the PIL can form a more uniform film for full coverage of an active layer and efficient cathode modification, resulting in higher device efficiency and reproducibility.
Since cathode interlayer (CIL) materials play a critical role in the performance improvement of organic solar cells (OSCs), great effort has been made for the development of such materials.1–11 Among various CIL materials reported so far, ionic liquids (ILs) have proved effective owing to their unique physicochemical properties to form interfacial dipoles at the cathode interface.12–14 For instance, imidazolium and pyridinium-based ILs with variable anions have been reported as CIL materials in both conventional and inverted OSCs with improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).15–18 They can also be used to modify the electron transport layers such as ZnO and SnO2 layers in inverted devices to increase the PCE.19,20 Nevertheless, these small-molecule ILs suffer from an intrinsic drawback of poor film-forming ability. During the solution-processing, such ILs tend to aggregate owing to their small molecular sizes and strong electrostatic interactions,21 forming non-uniform films with pin-holes, which result in the inferior coverage on the active layer in devices. Accordingly, the repeatability of the device is usually poor, meaning that enhanced efficiencies of devices with ILs as the CIL over the reference devices can only be obtained in occasional cases.
To overcome this problem, one can employ polymeric ILs as alternatives to small-molecule ones because they, in principle, have better film-forming properties than the latter while maintaining essential properties of ILs. Compared to conjugated polyelectrolytes,22 such as PFN-Br, PFP-X, and PFB,23–27 which as the CIL materials can improve the performance of OSCs, the non-conjugated polymeric ILs are easier to synthesize and also capable of playing the same role in modifying the cathode interlayer. Although a polymeric IL with a polystyrene-co-polyethylene backbone was studied as the CIL in an inverted OSC with a PCE of 7.55%,28 the applications of polymeric ILs in conventional devices remain unexplored and especially their advantages over small-molecule counterparts have never been experimentally witnessed.
In this work, by directly comparing a polymeric ionic liquid (PIL, Fig. 1a) with its monomer of 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium bromide (MIL), we demonstrate that being a CIL material the PIL can form a more homogenous film than the MIL, thus providing higher device efficiency, in particular, greater device reproducibility. Upon using the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend as the active layer, the PIL-based devices can exhibit a PCE of over 9%, much higher than that (6.90%) of the MIL-based ones. More importantly, the PIL-based devices present a narrower distribution of PCEs (8.4–9.04%) compared with that of the MIL-based counterparts (6.04–6.92%), attributed to the formation of more uniform films than the former. These results indicate that the polymeric IL is a more appropriate candidate as the CIL material with better device efficiency and reproducibility than the small-molecule IL.

(c) Diagram of the formation of an interfacial dipole layer. (d) Illustration of the preparation of MIL and PIL films during the spin-coating process. 
The PIL was synthesized from the MIL by a radical polymerization using AIBN as the initiator (Fig. 1a, see details in the ESI†). The molecular weight of the PIL was determined by the GPC method using DMF as the eluent with Mn = 34.8 kDa and PDI = 1.91 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement revealed the decomposition temperature of about 260 °C at a weight loss of 5% for the PIL (Fig. S2, ESI†). Both MIL and PIL were then used as the cathode interlayers to fabricate OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MIL or PIL/Al (Fig. 1b). Before detecting photovoltaic behaviors of the devices, the morphological properties of MIL and PIL films spin-coated from a methanol solution on top of the active layer were studied. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film shows a flawless surface as depicted by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 2a and b). After spin-coating the MIL, aggregates appear on the active layer (Fig. 2c), which look more obvious in an enlarged image (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the PIL can form a flat and uniform film, fully covering the active layer (Fig. 2e and f), indicating its excellent film-forming ability compared to that of the MIL which, as a matter of fact, presents its poor coverage (illustrated in Fig. 1d). Similar observations are also made from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 3a–c). These results suggest that the PIL film with the full coverage on the active layer can more effectively modify the cathode interlayer and thus potentially provide better device performance relative to the MIL.

The surface potential of the MIL and PIL films on the active layer was measured by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM, Fig. 3d–f). While the deposition of MIL on the active layer leads to a subtle increase in the average surface potential from 0.416 V for the pristine PTB7-Th:PC71BM film to 0.426 V, the incorporation of the PIL film can obviously enhance the average surface potential to 0.569 V. This also reflects that the MIL is unable to supply an intact film to overlay the active layer. The work function was then calculated from the corresponding surface potentials calibrated against HOPG. The values of 4.63 eV, 4.64 eV, and 4.53 eV were obtained for the pristine, MIL-coated, and PIL-coated active layers, respectively, suggesting that the interfacial dipole can be more effectively established when the PIL is adopted as the interlayer compared to the MIL.29,30 The formed interfacial dipole can decrease the Schottky barrier, increase the internal electric field, and lead to better energy level alignment.31,32 It can thus be expected that the improved charge extraction and collection as well as higher device performances can be obtained from the PIL-based OSCs.33
Device performances were then investigated and the results are presented in Fig. 4a and Table 1. The PIL solutions in methanol at different concentrations were used to fabricate the CIL. It is found that the device efficiency is sensitive to the film thickness and the PIL film prepared from a solution with a concentration of 0.3 mg mL−1 (a film thickness of ca. 2–3 nm) exhibits the best device efficiency (Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). The devices without and with the MIL as the CIL exhibit PCEs of 6.44% and 6.90%, respectively, indicating that the introduction of MIL can only slightly enhance the device efficiency. In contrast, the PIL-based device shows a champion PCE of 9.04%, much higher than that of the MIL-based counterpart. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 4b) was also measured, which corresponds well with the results of the J–V curves.

Notably, the higher PCE of the PIL-based device than that of the MIL one is contributed by the improved short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). In order to gain insight into such improvements, the J–V curves in the dark and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were analysed. From Fig. 4c and d, it is seen that compared to the MIL-based device the PIL-based one shows similar output currents in the forward direction and clearly reduced currents in the reverse direction, leading to a larger rectification ratio. This indicates that the charge extraction is enhanced and higher photocurrents can be expected.23,34 The higher rectification characteristics can further explain the increased FF.35 The EIS data (Fig. 4d) obtained under the open-circuit voltage conditions indicate that the series resistance (Rs) of the MIL-based device (4.68 Ω cm2) is higher than that of the PIL-based one (3.68 Ω cm2), which shows a similar trend to those obtained from the J–V measurements (Table 1). These results together with the higher shunt resistance of the PIL-based device are also responsible for the increased FF.36 On the other hand, the electron and hole mobilities of the PIL-based device are slightly lower than those of the device with the MIL (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†). Since the charge mobility is proportional to the conductivity, such results are in agreement with the decreased ionic conductivity of polymeric ionic liquids relative to the monomeric ones, due to the confinement of ionic migration after polymerization, as previously reported.37 In spite of this, it is believed to impact the device performance to a small extent because of the very thin cathode interlayer adopted. Overall, the lower series resistance and reduced work function in the case of PIL, induced by its excellent film-forming property as stated above, facilitate the improvement of the JSC and thus of the PCE.38–40
More significantly, it is found that with respect to the MIL ones the PIL-based cells can provide higher efficiencies and a narrower distribution of PCEs in multiple batches of devices (Fig. 5), showing greater reproducibility of the device performance. In the case of MIL, the relatively high PCE can only be obtained by chance owing to the uncontrollable surface coverage of the MIL on the active layer. When the Al electrode is deposited on the area where the MIL is present, the PCE is good; otherwise, the PCE is low, which actually occurs under most circumstances. In contrast, the high PCEs achieved by the PIL-based devices are mostly repeated, originating from the full and uniform coverage of the PIL film on the active layer, which evidences the high reliability of the device when the PIL is used as the CIL.

In conclusion, we have presented a direct comparison between a polymeric ionic liquid and its monomer as the cathode interlayers in conventional OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system. The PIL-based devices exhibit higher PCEs and better reproducibility of the device results than those based on the MIL. This is attributed to the improved interface contact and the reduced work function, originating from the formation of high-quality films of the polymer compared to the small molecule for the modification of the cathode interlayer. This work demonstrates that when selecting an ionic liquid as the cathode interlayer in OSCs, a polymer candidate is more efficient and reliable than a small-molecule analogue.
