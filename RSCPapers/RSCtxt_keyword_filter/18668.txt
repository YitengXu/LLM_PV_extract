High throughput screening combined with the first principles method can accurately and effectively screen out promising perovskites. Herein, we select two lead-free all-inorganic halide double perovskite materials Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) from 1026 compounds with the criteria including appropriate structure factors, positive decomposition energies, and suitable direct bandgaps. We investigated the thermal and mechanical stability, geometric and electronic structures, photoelectric properties, and defect formation energies for both perovskites Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In). They can exhibit excellent structural formability and stability through the analysis of structure factors, elastic constants, and stable chemical potential regions. In addition, we investigate the defect effects of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) on the photovoltaic performance by evaluating the defect formation energies and transition energy levels. Based on the HSE06 functional, we calculated the energy band structures of these two compounds and demonstrate the direct bandgaps of 1.69 eV (HSE06) and 2.16 eV (HSE06) for Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6, respectively. Moreover, we predicted excellent spectroscopic limited maximum efficiencies (SLMEs) of these two perovskites with high light absorption coefficients (around 105 cm−1), for instance, the SLME of Cs2KGaI6 can reach as high as 28.39%.
1. Introduction
In recent years, perovskite materials, which feature high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost manufacturability, deserve intensive attention as the next-generation solar cells.1–3 Based on their superior photoelectric properties, the reported PCE of perovskite solar cells has reached as high as 25.7%.2,4 However, the structural instability of hybrid perovskite materials seriously retards their practical applications in photoelectric devices.5 It is desired to develop novel all-inorganic perovskites with excellent thermal stability and photoelectric properties (such as ideal direct bandgaps, large absorption coefficients, and high carrier mobilities).6–8
Various designing strategies for all-inorganic perovskites have been proposed recently. For instance, it is routine to replace the Pb2+ cations with bivalent cations such as Ge2+ and Sn2+. Compared with the lead cation, other bivalent cations can be easily oxidized to tetravalent ones in perovskites.9,10 The trivalent or tetravalent metal cations (such as Bi3+, Sb3+, Sn4+, and Ti4+) can also be employed as the substitutes, while those generated compounds have the general formula Cs3M(III)2X9 or Cs2M(IV)X6 (M(III)/M(IV) represents trivalent or tetravalent metal cations, and X denotes the halogen atom) to maintain the charge neutrality.11,12 However, these trivalent or tetravalent cation-based compounds often display inferior photoelectric properties due to the isolated network of metal halide octahedral units.13 The heterovalent two-metal substitution is another usually-used strategy, in which two Pb2+ cations in perovskites can be replaced by a pair of monovalent and trivalent cations.14 With the general formula A2M(I)M(III)X6, the double perovskites have been regarded as stable and environment-friendly compounds, such as the Bi and Ag-based lead-free double perovskites.15,16 Some of these double perovskites have intrinsic indirect or large band gaps, which are unfavorable for thin film photovoltaics.17,18 Therefore, the screening of novel double perovskite materials with outstanding optoelectronic performance and structural stability can accelerate their applications in the next-generation photovoltaic technologies.
In this work, we aimed to screen lead-free perovskites with good thermal stability and promising performance from as many as 1026 compounds based on the high-throughput screening,19 where the criteria included appropriate octahedral structure factors and suitable direct bandgaps. Two double perovskites Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6 were selected and theoretically investigated based on the first-principles methods with different functionals (e.g. PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE06, and HSE06 + SOC).20,21 We evaluated the structural stability of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In), by calculating the structure factors (tolerance factor and octahedral factor),22 elastic constants, and stable chemical potential regions.23 Furthermore, we calculated the defect formation energies and transition energy levels to investigate the performance dependence of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) on defect effects.24 Finally, we can demonstrate the outstanding optoelectronic performance of these two perovskites by analyzing the electronic structures, light absorption coefficients, and spectroscopic limited maximum efficiencies.18
2. Computational methods
Our simulations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT)20 with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).23 The initial crystal structures of 1026 perovskites with the space group Fmm17,25–29 were derived from the Materials Project database.30 Based on the high-throughput screening, we selected two perovskites Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) and adopted the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)20 functional in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)31 to optimize their geometrical structures. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was set to 3 × 3 × 3 for the geometric optimization and 6 × 6 × 6 for the self-consistent calculations.32 The convergence threshold of self-consistent field iteration was set to 10−6 eV, and the residual force on the atoms was set to less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The projector augmented wave (PAW)33 pseudo-potential was employed with the cut-off energy of 520 eV. Considering the usually underestimated bandgaps with the PBE31 functional, we adopted the PBE + SOC (spin–orbit coupling),31 Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06), and HSE06 + SOC21 functional to calculate the band structures in our investigations. Moreover, we systematically studied the defects of perovskite Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) based on the 2 × 1 × 1 supercell by using the PBE-GGA31 method.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, we generated totally 1026 A2M(I)M(III)X6 compounds, by combining 4 different A-site cations (Cs+, K+, Na+, Rb+), 10 M(I)-site monovalent cations (Ag+, Au+, Cu+, In+, K+, Li+, Na+, Rb+, Tl+, and Cs+), 9 M(III)-site trivalent cations (Al3+, As3+, Au3+, Bi3+, Ga3+, In3+, Sb3+, Sc3+, and Y3+), 4 X-site anions (X = F, Cl, Br, I). In this work, all the inorganic lead-free double perovskites with good structural stability and suitable direct bandgaps among 1026 compounds were evaluated by the high-throughput screening and DFT calculations.34 The screening process for the inorganic lead-free double perovskite materials is shown in Fig. 1(c).

First of all, the structural factors (e.g. tolerance factor and octahedral factor22) are appropriate screening criteria to access the formability of stable perovskite structures.35 As shown in Fig. 1(a), the A2M(I)M(III)X6 double perovskites are composed of alternating M(I)X6 and M(III)X6 octahedra, whose structural stability and formability are related to the radii of constituent ions.36 The Goldsmith tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (μ) are usually used as empirical parameters to evaluate the stability of materials, and can be derived using the following formulas:22 (1) (2)where RA, RMeff, and RX refer to the Shannon radius37 of the A-site cation, the average radius of M(I)- and M(III)-site cations, and the radius of X-site anion, respectively, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).38 The t–μ diagrams of 1026 initial compounds are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Generally, the ranges of t and μ corresponding to stable perovskite structures are 0.813 < t < 1.107 and 0.377 < μ < 0.895.38 To further assess the stability of perovskite structures, a modified tolerance factor Tf is defined as follows:39 (3)where nA is the oxidation state of A (e.g. nA is 1 for monovalent cations). For stable perovskite structures, Tf is usually less than 4.2.39 Therefore, we can obtain 532 structures that meet the stability requirements of the structural factors. Secondly, we can select 23 compounds with direct band structures and appropriate bandgaps (0.65–1.50 eV)19,39,40 by analyzing parameters provided by the Materials Project database,30 as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
In addition, we predict the atomic packing fraction η and decomposition energy ΔHPD as the new screening criteria as follows:38 (4) ΔHPD = −1.987 + 1.660 × (μ + tη)(5)VA, VM(I), VM(III), and VX represent the volumes of corresponding atoms in the rigid sphere model (can be calculated with atom radius); a refers to the lattice parameter. A stable structure corresponds to positive ΔHPD.38 As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), there are 21 structures with positive decomposition energies, while 13 compounds of them have not been synthesized experimentally and their photoelectric properties have not been systematically studied, see Fig. S3 (ESI†). By further excluding compounds with toxic elements (e.g., Tl and As), we screened 8 candidates, including Cs2KGaI6, Cs2KInI6, Cs2RbGaI6, Rb2AuAlCl6, K2AuAlCl6, K2AgGaCl6, K2AgInCl6, and Rb2AgInCl6. Finally, we systematically investigated the thermal stability, electronic structures, photoelectric properties, and defect properties of Cs–K-based perovskites, Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6 with first-principles methods. The calculated structure factors and predicted decomposition energies of Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6 are listed in Table 1.

We performed the structure optimization for Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6 with the DFT methods, and the different structural parameters are listed in Table 1. As shown in previous investigations,41–43 we can analyze three independent elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44) to illustrate the mechanical stability of compounds. According to the Born–Huang stability criterion,44 the structure is mechanically stable when the following conditions are satisfied: C11 > 0, C44 > 0, C11 − C12 > 0, and C11 + 2C12 > 0.44 The calculated elastic constants of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) are shown in Table S3 (ESI†) and demonstrate that they are mechanically stable with satisfied Born–Huang stability conditions. Moreover, the calculated Pugh's ratio (B/G) and Poisson's ratio (v) of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) are larger than 1.75 and 0.26 respectively. This indicates that they are ductile materials with great application potential in foldable photovoltaic materials.45
To further evaluate the thermal stability of perovskites, we calculated the phase stability diagram46,47 based on the first-principles methods. To maintain the structure stabilities of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) during the growth process, the following conditions should be satisfied according to the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions:46 2μCs + μK + μM + 6μI = ΔHCs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In)(6)where μCs, μK, μM, and μI represent the chemical potentials of the constituent elements, Cs, K, M (M = Ga, In), and I, respectively, in the corresponding single crystals. To avoid the coexistence of elemental phases, the following conditions should be satisfied: μCs < 0, μK < 0, μM < 0 and μI < 0.46 ΔHCs2KMI6 is the formation energy of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In).46 The calculated formation energy of Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6 are −13.54 eV and −13.82 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the corresponding values (−13.5 eV and −13.0 eV) in the Materials Project database.30
Furthermore, we analyzed all experimentally synthesized binary and ternary compounds corresponding to perovskites Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In), and calculated the stable chemical potential regions with these phases. In our calculations, the binary and ternary phases included CsI (Fmm), KI (Fmm), CsK2 (P63/mmc), GaI3 (P21/c), Ga2I3 (P21/c), CsGa3 (Im2), CsGa7 (Rm), and KGaI4 (P21/c) for Cs2KGaI6. The extra phases for Cs2KInI6 included InI (Cmcm), InI2 (Pnna), InI3 (P21/c), CsIn3 (Im2), and Cs2In3 (Im2). For perovskite Cs2KMX6 (M = Ga, In), the following thermodynamic conditions should be satisfied:46 aμCs + bμK + cμM + dμI < ΔHCsaKbMcId (M = Ga, In; a, b, c, d = 0, 1, 2,…)(7)
Based on the DFT calculations, the formation energies ΔHCsaKbMcId of these binary and ternary phases were calculated, as shown in Table S4 (ESI†). We plotted the thermodynamic phase diagrams of perovskites Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In), as shown in Fig. 2. These existing thermodynamic phase diagrams can be employed to analyze the thermal stabilities of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In). Narrow 2D polyhedral regions (as shown in Fig. 2) implied that the thermodynamic synthesis conditions should be carefully controlled to obtain high-quality Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) and avoid the generation of the impurity phases.48
 Fig. 2  Calculated thermodynamic phase diagrams of the stable chemical potential regions with possible competitive phases for (a and b) Cs2KgaI6 and (c and d) Cs2KinI6. MM = −0.5 eV (M = Ga, In) indicates Cs-, K- and M-poor/I-rich chemical conditions, while μM = 0 eV (M = Ga, In) indicates Cs-, K- and M-rich/I-poor chemical conditions.46 Gray areas represent their thermodynamic stability conditions. 
The defects and stability-related characteristics of perovskites are critical for their applications in photovoltaic absorbers.46 It is desirable to synthesize these compounds in controlled chemical conditions to avoid performance-limiting defects. Totally, we took into account 20 different types of inherent point defects, including 4 vacancies (VCs, VK, VM, and VI), 4 interstitials (Csi, Ki, Mi, and Ii), 6 cation-on-cation antisites (CsK, CsM, KCs, KM, MCs, and MK), 3 anion-on-cation antisites (CsI, KI, and MI) and 3 anion-on-cation antisites (ICs, IK and IM).49
Based on the calculated thermodynamic stability phase diagram, we select two representative chemical conditions corresponding to the points A/C (Ga/In-rich, I-poor) and B/D (Ga/In-poor, I-rich), as shown in Fig. 2, respectively. The calculated enthalpies of defect formation (ΔHD,q) are plotted as the function of the Fermi energy level (EF) in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and can be calculated as:49 (8)

E
D,q is the total energy of the supercell with the defect D and charge state q, while Eperfect is the total energy of a crystal without defects. ni denotes the number of atoms being removed from (ni < 0) or added into (ni > 0) the supercell, and μi is the corresponding chemical potential. εVBM and EF are the energy levels corresponding to the valence band maximum (VBM) in the band structures and the Fermi level measured from the VBM, respectively. To correct the finite size effects in the calculations, qΔV is defined as the potential alignment correction term, which can be calculated with the difference between the core energy levels of atoms far from the defect site in the defective cells to ones of the pristine crystals:49
In eqn (8), ΔHD,q is linearly dependent on the Fermi energy level (EF), and the slope corresponds to the charge state q. As shown in Fig. S4(a–d) (ESI†), when the charge state q = 0, corresponding to the neutral defects, ΔHD,q is unchanged with EF. When the charge state q > 0 is with the positive defect centers, the defect formation energy will increase with the Fermi level. In contrast, when the charge state q < 0 is with the negative defect centers, the defect formation energy will decrease with the Fermi level.46 In general, the defects with higher formation energies imply their low formability. Therefore, in the following discussions, we focus on the defects with low defect formation energies, which have a great influence on the crystal growth and photoelectric properties of compounds.46
In different chemical conditions corresponding to the points A/C (Ga/In-rich, I-poor) and B/D (Ga/In-poor, I-rich) in Fig. 2, there are various dominant donor-type and acceptor-type defects for these two compounds. For Cs2KgaI6, the dominant donor-type defects include Gai, Ki, and Csi, while the acceptor-type defects are CsGa, Ii, IGa, KGa, and VCs in the Ga-rich and I-poor environment, as shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†). In the Ga-poor and I-rich environment, the dominant donor-type defects include Gai, KI, and KCs, while the acceptor-type defects are CsGa, KGa, Ii, VK, and VCs, as shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). For Cs2KInI6, in the In-rich and I-poor environment, the dominant donor-type defects include Ini, Csi, and Ki, while the acceptor-type defects are IIn, CsIn, ICs, Ii, and IK, as shown in Fig. S4(c) (ESI†). In the Ga-poor and I-rich environments, the dominant donor-type defects include KCs, KI, Ini, and Csi, while the acceptor-type defects are KIn, VK, IIn, CsIn, and Ii, as shown in Fig. S4(d) (ESI†).46
In addition, we find that there exist some types of defects for both compounds. For instance, in either M-rich or M-poor chemical conditions, the donor-type defects include interstitial defects Mi and Csi, while the accepter-type defects include substitution defects involving the M element such as CsM, IM, and KM. The formation of defects can be controlled by tuning chemical conditions. For instance, when the chemical condition changed from the Ga-rich and I-poor environment to Ga-poor and I-rich ones, the formation energies of Ki and Csi can be obviously increased.
The transition energy levels of the defects are of great significance to the photoelectric properties of materials. In general, the donor-type levels far from the CBM and the acceptor-type levels far from the VBM can be defined as deep-level defects. As is well known, the defects with deep transition levels easily become charge traps or recombination centers, resulting in device performance degradation.46,49,50 The charge transition energy level can be evaluated as:49 (9)
Fig. S4(e–f) (ESI†) shows the charge transition level of typical defects in Cs2KGaI6 and Cs2KInI6. We conclude that the potential deep-level defects for Cs2KGaI6 include Gai, Csi, CsGa, Ii, and KGa (Fig. S4(e), ESI†), while ones for Cs2KInI6 include Csi, KCs, and ICs (Fig. S4(f), ESI†). The types and concentrations of deep-level defects can be tuned by controlling the chemical conditions.49
As is well known, electronic structures are closely related to the photovoltaic properties of semiconductor materials.47 We calculated the bandgaps of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) by using the PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE06, and HSE06 + SOC functional21,31 as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3, and demonstrate the direct band structures for both compounds. The PBE bandgaps are consistent with the database.30 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, the band structures based on the HSE06 functional are close to ones with the HSE06 + SOC functional. The SOC effects are usually proposed to be evaluated to analyze the properties of 5d transition metal compounds,51 for instance, the electronic properties of compounds containing heavy elements such as Pb and Bi.48,49 Therefore, by taking into account the relatively light elements contained in Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In),48,49 and calculated similar band structures by HSE06 and HSE06 + SOC functionals (Fig. 3), we mainly discuss the HSE06 electronic structures in the following calculations to balance the accuracy and efficiency.

 Fig. 3  Band structures of (a) Cs2KGaI6 and (b) Cs2KInI6. The calculations are based on the HSE06 and HSE06 + SOC functionals. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the valence and conduction band edges (corresponding to the Γ point) are dispersive, which possibly leads to relatively small effective masses and large carrier mobilities.52 When the element changes from Ga to In, the conduction band shifts upward,45 thus resulting in the bandgap increase. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, perovskite materials with bandgaps of 0.8–2.2 eV are widely used in the photovoltaic conversion field.45 As a comparison, the previously reported perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibits larger and indirect bandgap (e.g. 2.21 eV with the HSE06 functional), and its calculated electron effective masses (L–Γ: 0.58 m0 and L–W: 0.34 m0) are larger than ones of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In).48
Furthermore, we evaluate the corresponding density of states (DOS), as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), it can be used to analyze the contribution of valence electrons near the Fermi surface to the hybridization and interband transitions.45 Our calculations show that the VBMs are mainly contributed by I-p orbits, while the CBMs are occupied by the M-s (M = Ga, In) and I-p orbits.46
The effective masses of perovskites Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In), along different K-point paths, were calculated by the HSE06 functional21 (see Table 2), which can affect the carrier mobilities, resistivity, and optical response of free carriers greatly. The effective masses are related to the band structure as follows:53 (10)According to our calculations, the effective masses of Cs2KGaI6 along different K-point paths are similar to the ones of Cs2KInI6, and the effective masses of the electron in these compounds are smaller than those of the hole.54 In general, small effective masses result in large charge mobilities and thus are beneficial to the transport of photogenerated charges in optoelectronic devices.52,55 In addition, the effective state densities of the conduction and valence bands (Nc, Nv) can be evaluated (as listed in Table 2) based on the effective masses as follows:56 (11) (12)where  and  represent the effective masses of electrons and holes, respectively. kB is the Boltzmann constant, and h is the Planck constant.56T is the temperature. Generally, lower conduction and valence band states are beneficial to improve the performance of the perovskite solar cells.56
To further study the interatomic bonding and charge transfer, we performed the electron localization function (ELF) analysis for the [110] crystallographic plane of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) (see Fig. 4).57,58 Based on a second-order Taylor expansion of sphere average pair density,59 ELF can be used to visualize atomic shell structures, the distribution of bond pairs and electron lone pairs in molecules, and thus to monitor the change in electron distribution during the formation and breaking of the bonds.60 The smaller ELF value (∼0) implies that the electron has an ultra-low density between two atoms with a typical ionic bond character.57 In contrast, when the ELF approaches 1, the electrons are localized between two atoms at a high density, which indicates the existence of an ideal covalent bond.52,57
 Fig. 4  Electron localization function contour plots and Bader charge values based on the HSE06 functional in the [110] crystallographic plane of (a) Cs2KGaI6 (b) Cs2KInI6 with the cube (Fmm) phase, e is the elementary charge. 
Our ELF calculations can show the bonding properties between the metal cations (e.g., Cs+, K+, and M3+) and the I− clearly.61 As shown in Fig. 4, the electron sharing behavior between M and I ion centers indicates the more covalent bond between them.61 The lower ELF values between K+, Cs+, and other ions indicate ionic interactions between K, Cs, and other ions, similar to the ones between Cs, K, and [MI6] units.58 These convinced us that Cs and K atoms generally act as charge donors. The coupling between M and I ions is obviously stronger than between K and I ions, which resulted in larger K–I bond lengths, as shown in Table 1.62
In addition, we also performed the Bader charge analysis60,62 as shown in Fig. 4. Positive Bader charges indicate atoms donate charges in the charge transfer, while the negative charge indicates atoms accept charges.57 This further proves that Cs and K atoms act as charge donors. Previous investigations demonstrated that the enhanced charge transfer in perovskites implies good stability. Therefore, the Bader charges in the charge transfer of Cs2KInI6 are slightly larger than the ones of the other compound, which indicates slightly better stability of Cs2KInI6. These conclusions are consistent with our calculations of the formation energies, as shown in Table S4 (ESI†).62
Efficient light absorption is of great significance in optoelectronic applications63 and is determined by the interaction between light and materials.64,65 We calculated the light absorption coefficients of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) by the HSE06 functional (see Fig. 5(a)), and analyzed the absorption performance of these perovskites in the visible light region. Based on the Kramers–Kronig transformation, the absorption coefficient I can be calculated as follows:66 (13)Here, ω is the photon frequency. ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary parts of dielectric functions for materials, respectively.66 The absorption coefficients of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) are as high as 105 cm−1 in the visible region.

The SLME18,67,68 is a commonly-used tool to assess the performance of photovoltaic devices. Compared with the Shockley–Queisser limit,69,70 the SLME takes into account not only the energy band structures but also the active film thicknesses and absorption coefficients.18 As shown in Fig. 5(b), the SLME of these compounds can achieve 28.39% (with a film thickness of 530 nm) for Cs2KGaI6 and 19.05% (480 nm) for Cs2KInI6, respectively.
4. Conclusions
From 1026 compounds, we delicately selected perovskite Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) based on the criteria including appropriate structure factors, positive decomposition energies, and suitable direct bandgaps. Furthermore, we theoretically studied the thermal stability, photoelectric properties, and defect effects of these two unexplored perovskites by using the first-principles methods. We assessed the structural stability of these compounds based on the calculations of structure factors, decomposition energies, and stable chemical potential regions. With the HSE06 functional, we calculated the electronic structures and light absorption rates and show that the direct bandgaps of Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) are 1.69 eV and 2.16 eV, respectively. The light absorption rates of these compounds can approach as high as around 105 cm−1, while the SLME of Cs2KGaI6 can achieve 28.39% with a film thickness of around 530 nm. By comprehensively analyzing the electronic and optical properties, we can propose that Cs2KMI6 (M = Ga, In) can exhibit superior photovoltaic performance with proper bandgaps, large light absorption rates, and high theoretical efficiencies. Based on the ELF and Bader charge analysis, we conclude that the K–I bond exhibits a covalent character, while M–halogen and Cs–I bonds are ionic. In addition, the calculated effective masses of these compounds are relatively small and thus facilitate charge carrier transport. These optoelectronic properties based on the first-principles methods can be integrated into the numerical models to predict the current–voltage curves in the future.71,72 In addition, we predict different types of deep-level defects, which can lead to traps and recombination centers, resulting in device performance degradation. These theoretical results can contribute to the development and design of new lead-free double perovskites for highly efficient optoelectronic devices, and the defect engineering to tune their optoelectronic performance.
