    , Accepted 10th March 2019First published on 11th March 2019AbstractThe development of high-performance photocatalytic fuel cells (PFCs) is seriously hampered by poor light utilization rates and low charge carrier transfer efficiency. Herein, we have experimentally obtained plasmonic Ag modified Cr-BiOCl (Cr-BOC/Ag) with high visible light photocatalytic activity and provided direct evidence for the substantially enhanced catalytic activity in metal–semiconductor photocatalysts. The experimental results revealed that the Cr doping and Ag modification could not only extend the photo absorption of BiOCl from the UV to the visible light region but could also greatly increase the generation and transfer rate of charge carriers because of its narrowed band gap and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of metallic Ag. Under visible light irradiation, the Cr-BOC/Ag showed a remarkable enhancement in the PFC performance when the optimum contents of Cr doping and Ag loading was 14.4% and 4%, respectively. The trapping experiments and multiple characterizations demonstrated that the advantageous combination of the Cr doping effect and SPR effect induced by the Ag nanoparticles is responsible for the high generation rate of oxidative species and effective charge carrier transfer. By using RhB as fuel, approximately 75.1% color removal efficiency and 8.38% coulombic efficiency were obtained under visible light irradiation for 240 min, which are higher than those of MO and TC. In addition, the Jsc and Voc of the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode were measured to be 0.0073 mA cm−2 and 0.543 V.
1. Introduction
A photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) is a device that can directly convert organic pollutants into electricity and has attracted widespread attention.1–4 In addition to possessing a free and unlimited supply of solar energy, the fascination also comes from its huge application potential for linking and dealing with environmental and energy problems. Recently, bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) with a 2D sheet structure has been proven to exhibit an outstanding performance in PFC applications.5,6 Benefiting from its unique layered structure, an internal static electric field will be formed along the [001] facets direction, resulting in a great enhancement in the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.7,8 Moreover, compared to the traditional TiO2 based PFC, the higher valence band energy of BiOCl endows the photogenerated holes with a strong oxidation capacity, which can achieve superior photocatalytic degradation and cell performance.9 Unfortunately, the poor absorption of BiOCl for visible light unavoidably results in its low utilization efficiency in the full solar spectrum, which is not beneficial for its wide application.10 Therefore, it is urgently desired to design and synthesize a BiOCl photocatalyst with high visible light harvesting.
To date, tremendous efforts have been devoted to broadening the light response of BiOCl photocatalysts. Our previous work demonstrated that controlling the growth of BiOCl with a large {010} facet is an effective way of enhancing the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl for RhB degradation under visible light irradiation via a photosensitization pathway.11 Moreover, introduction of surface defects, coupling with other photocatalysts and tailoring the size and morphology have also been attempted to design and construct BiOCl with a visible light response.12–17 However, tailoring morphology and crystal structure cannot obviously change the intrinsic light absorption performance of BiOCl, while introducing surface oxygen vacancies will bring with it the undesirable thermal instability. Recent theoretical and experimental results have proved that band-structure engineering via foreign metal element doping is an effective strategy to change the physical properties of BiOCl, because it can not only broaden the photo response from the UV to the visible light region, but can also maintain the redox reactivity of the parent BiOCl at as high a level as possible.12 For instance, the doping of Fe3+ could significantly enhance the visible light absorption ability of BiOCl by forming the localized Fe dopant level in its band gap.18 Moreover, it was reported that the doped Co could expand the light absorption region and enhance the charge separation efficiency of BiOCl for the improvement of the BPA degradation.19
In addition, metallic Ag NPs have attracted considerable interest and are often used as a cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the wide-band-gap semiconductor in the past decade, which can markedly boost the visible light harvesting ability, enhance hot electrons injection and promote charge transfer via the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects.20,21 Owing to the effective scattering of resonant photons by Ag NPs, the optical path lengths for photons are prolonged, which will result in an increase of the rate of charge carriers’ formation in the semiconductor. Besides, the intense SPR-induced near-field electromagnetic fields can promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes from the photoexcited metal to the semiconductor, yielding a higher generation rate of excited charge carriers. Furthermore, the formed Schottky junction between metallic Ag NPs and the semiconductor can effectively accelerate the separation of the photoinduced charge carriers.22 For example, the Ag modified N-TiO2 photocatalysts exhibited the obvious visible light photocatalytic activity enhancement compared with the semiconductor alone owing to the SPR effects of the Ag nanostructure.23 Moreover, Yu et al. demonstrated that selective deposition of Ag on BiOCl{001} facets can significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl under visible light irradiation.24 Therefore, we have reasons to believe that, the combination of metal doped BiOCl with Ag nanoparticles modification can create a high-performance visible-light-driven photocatalytic fuel cell system. However, few studies have explored the influence of the synergistic effect between metal doping and Ag modification on the photocatalytic performance of BiOCl, and a deep investigation into the enhancement mechanism and PFC application is also lacking.
Against this background, in this work, novel visible-light-driven BiOCl photocatalysts (Cr-BOC/Ag) were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method combined with a photoreduction procedure. The photocatalytic performance of Cr-BOC/Ag was evaluated by the degradation of RhB, MO and TC under visible light irradiation. The experimental results showed that the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl was substantially enhanced by Cr doping and metallic Ag modification, which was attributed to its enhanced visible light absorption, increased rate of charge carrier generation and effective charge transfer. The effects of Cr doping and Ag modification on the photocatalytic activity of Cr-BOC/Ag were investigated in detail and the photocatalytic reaction mechanism was systematically analyzed. 3D EEMs analysis and total organic carbon (TOC) assays were carried out to assess the mineralization ability of the prepared photocatalysts. Eventually, a photo fuel cell (PFC) system assembled with Cr-BOC/Ag photoanodes was constructed and the photocatalytic degradation and electricity generation properties of the PFC were also studied.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), mannitol (C6H14O6), PVP-30 K, chromium chloride hexahydrate (CrCl3·6H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO), tetracycline (TC), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. All chemicals were analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of Cr-doped BiOCl (Cr-BOC)
The Cr-doped BiOCl was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction process. In a typical procedure, 0.4851 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solids and 0.4 g PVP were dispersed in 25 mL of 0.1 M mannitol solution. A clear solution was obtained by continuous ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. Then, a certain amount of CrCl3·6H2O was added into the above solution. Finally, 5 mL saturated sodium chloride solution was slowly added. After continuously stirring for 10 min, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a reaction time of 3 h at 160 °C. When the reaction finished, the resulting blue products were collected and washed with ethanol and water by centrifugation to remove residual ions. The Cr-BOC samples were acquired after drying at 80 °C overnight. The as-prepared samples with different Cr doping were denoted as (x)Cr-BOC, where x expresses the Cr doping mass ratio calculated from the experimental dosage of CrCl3·6H2O solids with 48 mg, 96 mg, 192 mg and 288 mg, respectively, as shown in Table S1.† For comparison, pure BiOCl samples were obtained under the same conditions without the addition of CrCl3·6H2O solids.
2.3 Preparation of Ag modified Cr-doped BiOCl (Cr-BOC/Ag)
The Cr-BOC/Ag nanocomposite was obtained via a photoreduction procedure. In a typical procedure, 50 mg of the prepared Cr-BOC solids was dispersed with continuous ultrasonic in 100 mL ethanol solution (containing 50 mL ethanol). Subsequently, a certain amount of AgNO3 was added and the mixture solution was treated under visible light irradiation for 1 h by using a 300 W Xe lamp. After that, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Finally, the Cr-BOC/Ag sample was obtained after drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The prepared samples were denoted as Cr-BOC/Ag x (x represents the mass ratio of Ag to the Cr-BOC calculated from the experimental dosage of AgNO3, as shown in Table S1†). For comparison, the BOC/Ag (4%) photocatalysts were also synthesized by the same process using BOC nanosheets.
2.4 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern measurements of the prepared samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα = 0.15406 nm) and measured within a 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The architectural features of the samples were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM Hitachi S-4800). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on Tecnai G2 F20 operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the prepared samples were determined with an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectroscope system by using Al Kα radiation. UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) of the obtained samples were obtained on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100) from 200 to 800 nm by using pure BaSO4 as the reflectance standard material. Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals were recorded on a Bruker A300 spectrometer with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) in water. A photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix fluorescence spectra (3D EMMs) were collected on a FluoroMax-4 Spectrofluorometer (HORIBA) with an excitation wavelength range of λex = 200–600 nm and an emission wavelength range of λem = 250–600 nm.
2.5 Photocatalytic performance analysis
The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was evaluated by RhB (rhodamine B), MO (methylene blue), and TC (tetracycline) degradation under visible light irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing) equipped with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). During the degradation of RhB and MO, 25 mg catalysts were dispersed into 50 mL RhB solution (20 mg L−1) and MO solution (10 mg L−1), respectively. Prior to irradiation, the suspension solution was kept stirring in the dark for 30 min to ensure a desorption–adsorption equilibrium. Under visible light irradiation, 4 mL of the mixture solution was sampled at specific time intervals, and a clear solution was collected by centrifugation. The concentration of RhB and MO at different reaction times was monitored by measuring the characteristic absorption peaks at 554 nm and 446 nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2550, Japan), respectively. Similar to the process of RhB degradation, 50 mg catalysts were added into 50 mL of TC solution (20 mg L−1). In addition, the concentration of TC at different reaction times was monitored by measuring the characteristic absorption peak at 357 nm. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the treatment solution was detected by a total carbon analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan).
2.6 Photoelectric performance measurements
The photocurrent responses (I–T), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), current density–voltage (J–V) and current–power (JV–V) were obtained on a CHI660E workstation with a conventional three-electrode model. Typically, 100 mg of as-prepared powder was suspended in 2 mL ethanol by magnetic stirring, subsequently, 0.86 mL terpineol and 1.0 mL ethyl cellulose in ethanol (10 wt%) were added into the mixture followed by stirring and sonication. 200 μL of the resulting paste was applied onto FTO substrates with an available surface area of 1.0 cm2 by a spin coating method. Finally, the electrodes were annealed at 450 °C in air for 30 min. 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte in the photoelectrochemical test system. A 300 W Xe arc lamp with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was utilized as the visible light source. 40 mL samples of 5 mg L−1 RhB, MO, and TC solution were used as the fuels during investigation. The initial pH of the solution was adjusted to 2.0 by adding 1 M H2SO4. Prior to irradiation, the photoanode was vertically inserted in the electrolyte solution with continuous stirring in the dark for 30 min to ensure a desorption–adsorption equilibrium. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PFC was collected using wavelengths of 365, 578, 630 and 940 nm band-pass filters. The light intensity of the incident light was detected by an irradiatometer (PL-MW2000).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared BOC, Cr-BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag samples with the optimal contents of Cr doping and Ag loading. As can be seen, the main diffraction peaks of the BOC sample agree well with the (001), (101), (110), (102), (112), (200), (104), and (212) crystal planes, belonging to the tetragonal crystals BiOCl (JCPDS no.: 06-0249).7 No diffraction peaks of other impurities are observed. There is no obvious difference in the intensity and width of the XRD peaks after doping of chromium, even when increasing the Cr concentration, indicating the good dispersion of Cr ions in the BiOCl crystal structure (Fig. S1(a)†). A quite small peak located at 38.11°, as the (111) crystal plane of cubic crystals of Ag (JCPDS no.: 04-0783),25 is detected in the resulting Cr-BOC/Ag sample, revealing the presence of nanosized Ag particles. In addition, the intensities of the Ag characteristic peak were enhanced with an increase of the AgNO3 addition, indicating the increase of the Ag loading (Fig. S1(b)†). Notably, the high specific value of (001) over (110) for all samples manifests the oriented growth of BiOCl along the [001] orientation (c axis).26 The XRD result demonstrates that high crystallinity BiOCl products are obtained and the pristine crystal structure of BiOCl cannot be changed during the doping and coating process of the Cr element and Ag particles.

The morphology of the semiconductor materials is crucial for their photocatalytic performance.27 As depicted in Fig. 2, all samples exhibit a tetragonal structure with a diameter in the range of 30–100 nm and a thickness of about 3.51 nm. The TEM images of the BOC (Fig. 2(a)) and Cr-BOC (Fig. 2(b)) samples show little morphological difference in the appearance of the formed nanosheet structure, indicating that the Cr doping will not affect the growth of BiOCl crystal. Their corresponding HRTEM images reveal that clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.274 nm are observed, which matches well with the (110) atomic planes (Fig. 2(d) and (e)). However, compared with the continuous lattice fringe of the BOC sample, a lattice disordered area can be observed in the HRTEM image of the Cr-BOC samples, which is attributed to the inserted Cr. After modifying with Ag NPs, it can be seen that the BiOCl nanosheets become closer, and numerous dark and ultra-small particles appear in the surface (Fig. 2(c)), which are tightly connected with BiOCl nanosheets. The HRTEM analysis shows that the diameter of the formed Ag NPs is about 5 nm. Moreover, two adjacent lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.236 and 0.274 nm are observed, which can be assigned to the d spacing of the fcc Ag (111) and tetragonal BiOCl (110) plane (Fig. 2(f)). The results demonstrate that Cr-BOC nanosheets coated in Ag NPs are successfully obtained via the photoreduction procedure. In addition, SEM-mapping and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) images were provided to better describe the element distribution of the Cr-BOC/Ag sample. As shown in Fig. 3(a–f), the Bi, Cl, O, Ag, Cr elements are detected and distributed throughout the whole specific areas of sample at the nanoscale, indicating the good distribution and homogenous coverage of Cr and Ag on the BiOCl surface. Moreover, the result of the EDS analysis (Fig. S2†) further confirms the presence of a trace amount of Cr and Ag elements in the Cr-BOC/Ag sample.

3.2 Surface chemical composition analysis
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the binding states and the chemical compositions of the obtained BOC, Cr-BOC, and Cr-BOC/Ag samples. The survey spectra reveal that the main elements of the prepared samples are Bi, O, and Cl (Fig. S3†). Compared with the BOC and Cr-BOC, a weak Ag signal is detected in Cr-BOC/Ag, indicating the presence of Ag. The Cr element is not observed in the survey spectra of Cr-BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag, which may be ascribed to its low content. Fig. 4(a–d) show the high resolution spectra of Bi 4f, O 1s, Cr 2p, and Ag 3d. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 4(a), two strong individual peaks at the binding energies of ∼158.98 eV and ∼164.28 eV are observed in the three samples, belonging to the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, which indicates the Bi3+ state in the BiOCl nanosheets.28Fig. 4(b) shows the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s. For the BOC sample, the main peak of O 1s can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 529.66 eV and 531.08 eV, respectively. The former can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the [Bi2O2] units, and the latter is assigned to the O species in the hydroxyl groups absorbed on the sample surface, which is associated with the produced surface oxygen vacancies,29 while, the O 1s spectra of the Cr-BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag samples shows three peaks located at 529.87, 531.18, and ∼532.58 eV. The first two peaks are in accordance with those of O 1s in the BOC samples. In addition, the third peak at ∼532.58 eV can be ascribed to the O species in the Cr–O chemical bonds of the BiOCl lattice.30 The presence of the oxygen vacancy of the prepared samples could be further proved by the low temperature ESR spectroscopy. As presented in Fig. S4,† the characteristic signals of the oxygen vacancy at g = 2.001 are detected in all samples.31 In addition, the signal intensity increases after loading Ag NPs on the BiOCl surface, which can be ascribed to the plasmonic enhancement effect from Ag NPs.32 The presence of the oxygen vacancy can not only provide more active sites for photocatalytic reaction, but can also act as capture centers for accelerating photogenerated electrons transfer, consequently, enhancing the separation of the electron–hole pairs.33 As displayed in Fig. 4(c), the high-resolution Cr 2p spectrum for the Cr-BOC/Ag sample is detected and can be divided into one spin–orbit doublet and a shakeup satellite (identified as “Sat.”). The two peaks at the binding energies of 572.48 eV and 581.78 eV are attributed to Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2, respectively.34 Also, the splitting energy difference between the two peaks is 9.3 eV, indicating that the chemical state of Cr in Cr-BOC/Ag is trivalent.35 In the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ag 3d presented in Fig. 4(d), the two peaks with the splitting energy Δ = 6.0 eV can be ascribed to the Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, indicating that metal Ag is the predominant species.36 The results of the XPS manifest that Cr is successfully introduced in the interior structure of BOC via forming of Cr–O chemical bonds and the formed Ag NPs are tightly combined with BiOCl.

3.3 Optical properties
The diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorbance spectra (DRS) were measured to investigate the optical absorption property of the prepared samples. As can be clearly seen from Fig. 5(a), the absorption edge of the BOC sample is located at about 400 nm and shows a tail extending to 800 nm, suggesting the weak visible light absorption ability. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the surface oxygen vacancy which can introduce a gap state in BiOCl, and accordingly boosts its visible light response.37 Compared with the BOC sample, owing to the Cr3+ → Bi3+ charge-transfer transition, the light absorption intensity of the Cr-BOC sample is much higher and its absorption band shifts to the visible light region. Besides, a new broad absorption band centered at around 600 nm can be clearly observed in the spectrum of Cr-BOC, which is assigned to the Cr3+ d–d transition.38 Combination with the result of the XPS, the Cr doping will result in forming a new impurity level in BiOCl. Therefore, the absorption ability of Cr-BOC for visible light is significantly enhanced and the absorption band exhibits a red-shift. Furthermore, it can be seen that the absorption edge of Cr-BOC/Ag is red shifted to 445 nm and it has strong visible light absorption nearly in the entire visible light spectrum. Meanwhile, a new broad absorption band located at 450 nm is detected. This marked absorption in the visible light region should be ascribed to the LSPR effect of the Ag NPs.39 The impacts of the LSPR effect of Ag NPs on light absorption among the prepared Cr-BOC/Ag composites are mainly reflected by the following three aspects: (i) making the absorption edge red shift; (ii) enhancing the light scattering effect; and (iii) facilitating visible light absorption and transferring the photon energy from the metallic Ag to the semiconductor. The strong visible light absorption is crucial to achieving the high photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. Fig. 5(b) displays the bandgap energies of the prepared samples. Based on the following formula:40 αhv = A(hv − Eg)1/2(1)where α, h, v, and Eg are the absorption constant, Planck constant, light frequency and band gap, respectively. The apparent band gap of Cr-BOC/Ag is estimated to be 2.77 eV, which is smaller than that of BOC (2.98 eV) and Cr-BOC (2.87 eV). The decrease of the apparent band gap of the whole composite can be attributed to the introduction of the impurity level by Cr doping and the LSPR effect of the Ag NPs, which results in enhancing the visible light absorption ability and broadening the light response scope.41

3.4 Charge transfer kinetics
Effective charge separation and transfer is vital to obtain superior photocatalytic activity. Fig. 6(a) shows the transient photocurrent responses of the prepared photocatalysts. It can be seen that the BOC electrode has a small photocurrent signal under visible light irradiation, which can be attributed to the presence of the surface oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the photocurrent intensity of the Cr-BOC/Ag electrode is higher than that of the BOC/Ag electrode (2 times), Cr-BOC electrode (5 times) and BOC electrode (10 times), indicating the higher photoelectron generation and effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers in the Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalyst. Due to the narrowed band gap, the Cr-BOC/Ag can absorb more visible light to produce photoelectrons. Moreover, a large number of hot electrons will be generated on the surface of the Ag NPs and injected into the conduction band of BiOCl via plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer. Therefore, the advantageous combination of the plasmonic effect induced by metallic Ag and Cr-doping effect is responsible for the high photocurrent generation. The strong photocurrent signal implies that more active species can be generated for pollutant degradation.42 Furthermore, the greatly enhanced charge transfer efficiency of the photocatalysts can be revealed by their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the prepared samples shows that the Cr-BOC/Ag electrode possesses a minimum arc radius in all samples, suggesting the fast photogenerated charge separation and interfacial transfer. The enhanced migration efficiency of the photogenerated charge can be ascribed to the following reasons. On the one hand, the oxygen vacancy and doped Cr can serve as trapping centers to facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer.43,44 On the other hand, metallic Ag can further speed up the charge movement owing to its excellent electron conductivity.45 Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is also employed to describe the charge separation of the prepared photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6(c), it can be clearly seen that the PL intensity is in the order BOC > Cr-BOC > BOC/Ag > Cr-BOC/Ag under the excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Generally speaking, the lower the PL intensity, the higher the charge separation efficiency.46,47 Therefore, the results further demonstrate that the recombination rate of BOC is efficiently suppressed by the Cr doping and Ag modification. The shift of the PL peak of BOC/Ag and Cr-BOC/Ag is due to the interaction between BOC and the Ag NPs. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra can provide more accurate information about the charge carrier kinetics of the photocatalysts (Fig. 6(d)). The average fluorescence lifetime (τm) is commonly used to evaluate the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and is calculated according to the formula .48 According to the experimental decay profiles of the prepared samples listed in Table S2,† the Cr-BOC/Ag sample exhibits a longer average fluorescence lifetime (τm = 0.67 ns) than that of BOC (τm = 0.18 ns), Cr-BOC (τm = 0.32 ns) and BOC/Ag (τm = 0.51 ns), suggesting the long-lived photoinduced electrons in the Cr-BOC/Ag nanosheets. We think that the intense SPR-induced electromagnetic fields are strong enough to facilitate the transfer of the plasmon energy to the BiOCl semiconductor, resulting in a dramatic increase of the value of τm. The results of the above analysis confirm that the Cr doping and Ag modification can significantly promote the photogenerated electrons transfer and decrease the charge recombination rate of BiOCl, which is beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic activity.

3.5 Photocatalytic activity for pollutant degradation
In order to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the prepared photocatalysts, experiments toward RhB, MO, and TC degradation under visible light irradiation were carried out. First, the effects of the content of Cr doping and Ag loading on the photocatalytic activity of the Cr-BOC/Ag were investigated. The results shown in Fig. S5† demonstrate that a proper amount of Cr and Ag NPs can enhance the photocatalytic activity of the Cr-BOC/Ag on TC degradation. On the one hand, Cr doping will introduce an impurity level, resulting in reducing the band gap of Cr-BOC/Ag and improving the light absorption efficiency. On the other hand, owing to the LSPR effect of Ag NPs, light-harvesting will be further improved and more hot electrons can be provided for the formation of active species. Meanwhile, the interaction between BiOCl and the adjacent Ag NPs will result in increasing the generation rates of electron–hole pairs because of the presence of intense SPR-induced electromagnetic fields.49,50 As a result, the photocatalytic activity of Cr-BOC/Ag is enhanced with the increase in the amount of Ag NPs. However, excess Cr and metallic Ag will become the electron–hole recombination centers and reduce the contact area between pollutants and photocatalysts, leading to decreased photocatalytic activity (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the optimum mass ratios of Cr doping and Ag modification are ca. 14.4% and 4%, respectively.
As can be seen from Fig. 7(a), the RhB molecules can be removed completely within 30 min by all samples, which can be attributed to the dye photosensitization performance of BiOCl. In the process of dye photosensitization degradation, the BiOCl is served only as an electron-transfer mediator, therefore, high removal efficiencies are obtained in all samples.8,11 Different from the RhB photosensitive degradation process, Cr-BOC/Ag and Cr-BOC exhibit higher removal efficiencies of MO than that of the BOC, indicating that the direct semiconductor photoexcitation degradation process is prominent (Fig. 7(b)). According to the result of the DRS analysis, the Cr doping and Ag NPs modification reduces the band gap of BOC and significantly enhances the absorption ability of visible light. As a result, more active species can be generated for MO degradation. The BOC/Ag has a higher removal efficiency of MO than that of the Cr-BOC, indicating the great contribution of plasmon effect to the photocatalytic process. Besides, 6.3% of MO removal efficiency is obtained by using the BOC, which may be ascribed to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies. A similar phenomenon can also be observed during the TC degradation process (Fig. 7(c)). It is well known that TC is a colorless organic compound and can hardly be degraded by photosensitization degradation processes. Therefore, the excellent photocatalytic activity of TC degradation further demonstrates that the Cr doping and Ag modification markedly enhance the visible light photocatalytic activity of the Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalyst. Moreover, the photoactivity enhancement factors (kUV/kVS) and TOC removal enhancement factors (TOCUV/TOCVS) also prove that the overall improved photocatalytic activity of Cr-BOC/Ag is attributed to its self-generated electrons and holes, not dye sensitization during RhB and MO photodegradation51 (Fig. S7 and S8†). In order to accurately describe the photocatalytic performance, the initial reaction rate normalized by the catalyst dosage on the pollutants degradation was investigated. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 7(d), the reaction rates (k) on the degradation of RhB have no obvious difference for all samples, while, for the MO and TC degradation, the k of Cr-BOC/Ag is much higher than that of the BOC. Moreover, the degradation rates of the three pollutants are all arranged in the order Cr-BOC/Ag > BOC/Ag > Cr-BOC > BOC. This result strongly confirms that the plasmonic effect induced by Ag modification can cooperate with the Cr doping effect to enhance photocatalytic activity.

3.6 3D EEMs analysis and mineralization ability
3D EEMs technology was employed to deeply investigate the TC degradation process based on the Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts. As shown in the Fig. 8(a), a very weak fluorescence signal of the initial TC solution is detected, which belongs to the electron-withdrawing groups in the TC molecules, such as the carbonyl group.52 Under visible light irradiation for 20 min, it can be clearly observed that there are two new fluorescence centers at Ex/Em = 330–360/490–510 nm (peak A) and Ex/Em = 330–365/500–520 nm (peak B), which can be referred to the humic acid-like fluorescence regions (Fig. 8(b)).53 The result indicates that the large TC molecules are decomposed gradually into small molecules. Moreover, with the extension of reaction time, the intensity of fluorescence significantly enhances and the location of the fluorescence center is blue shifted (Fig. 8(c)). According to previous reports, this phenomenon is primarily ascribed to the intermediate-accumulation during the photo-degradation process.54 However, as shown in Fig. 8(d), when the reaction time is prolonged to 60 min, the intensity of the fluorescent peak is weakened to some extent, indicating that these generated intermediate products are further decomposed and mineralized. In order to better evaluate the mineralization ability of the photocatalysts, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies on the TC degradation during different reaction times were collected in this study. As can be seen from Fig. S9(a),† the mineralization efficiency for Cr-BOC/Ag can reach up to 54.37% under visible light irradiation for 120 min, which is higher than that of the BOC (7.12%), Cr-BOC (22.42%) and BOC/Ag (43.53%). The enhanced TOC removal efficiency indicates that the prepared Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts possess excellent photocatalytic oxidation ability, which can be a huge advantage in their wide application.

3.7 Photocatalyst stability and recyclability
Four repetitive reaction processes toward TC degradation were carried out under visible light irradiation to study the stability performance of the prepared Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts. As a result, as depicted in Fig. S9(b),† the photocatalytic activity of the Cr-BOC/Ag does not undergo deterioration even after four cycling experiments and 78.6% of TC can still be degraded, indicating the superior photocatalytic performance and stability of the obtained photocatalyst. More information on the phase structure and composition were provided to further investigate the change of the Cr-BOC/Ag before and after light irradiation. From Fig. S10(a), (b) and Table S3,† it can be clearly seen that there are no obvious changes appearing in the XRD pattern, XPS spectra and ion leakage of the photocatalysts after four photocatalytic reaction processes, demonstrating its good structural stability during the reaction. Moreover, the high resolution XPS spectrum of Ag 3d in the recovered composite shows that no evident shift in their characteristic peak position can be observed (Fig. S10(c)†). The above results elucidate that the prepared Cr-BOC/Ag possesses excellent photostability and can be a promising photocatalyst used for environmental treatment.
3.8 Photocatalytic reaction mechanism
In order to clearly identify the contributions of several active species and gain insight into the effect of Cr doping and the plasmonic effect on the TC photocatalytic degradation, a series of active species trapping experiments based on the prepared Cr-BOC, BOC/Ag and Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts were carried out. Three typical scavengers, TEMPOL, EDTA-2Na and IPA are used to capture the superoxide radical (˙O2−), hole (h+) and hydroxyl radical (˙OH), respectively.55 As shown in Fig. 9, the removal efficiency of TC significantly decreases when Na2C2O4 is added to trap the h+ for all catalytic systems, whereas, it is hardly inhibited by the addition of isopropanol (IPA, hydroxyl radical scavenger), revealing that the photogenerated h+ is the main active species involved in the TC degradation. Besides, the addition of TEMPOL (˙O2− scavenger) results in marked suppression effects on TC photodegradation, indicating that ˙O2− makes an essential contribution to the photocatalytic process. Notably, the inhibiting action on the TC degradation of adding different scavengers on Cr-BOC/Ag is more significant than that of Cr-BOC and BOC/Ag, implying that more active species can be produced in the Cr-BOC/Ag system. Moreover, the removal efficiency of TC decreases more on BOC/Ag than that of Cr-BOC, which confirms the leading role of the plasmonic effects on the photocatalytic process. In situ ESR characterization with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was performed to further determine the generation of active radicals. As depicted in Fig. S11(a),† the characteristic peaks of DMPO-˙O2− with g = 2.0032 are detected under visible light irradiation, whereas, no signal can be observed in darkness, suggesting the formation of ˙O2− during the photocatalytic reaction process.56 Meanwhile, obvious signals of the DMPO-˙OH adduct are also detected, which indicates that ˙OH is produced (Fig. S11(b)†). The results of trapping experiments and ESR analysis demonstrate that h+, ˙O2− and ˙OH can be yielded by Cr-BOC/Ag under visible light irradiation in the photocatalytic reaction and the photogenerated h+ makes a great contribution for the degradation of TC.

In addition, the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst (ηpc) has a positive correlation with the light absorption (ηabs), charge separation (ηsep) and injection efficiency (ηinj), which can be described as the following equation:10 ηpc = ηabs × ηsep × ηinj(2)where ηpc is the photocurrent density under visible light irradiation. When e− scavenger K2S2O8 is added to the reaction solution, the charge injection efficiency will be eliminated (ηinj = 1).57 Thus, the photocurrent density of samples in an electrolyte solution containing K2S2O8 becomes ηkospc = ηabs × ηsep(3)
The following equations can be derived from eqn (2) and (3): ηsep = Ikospc/ηabs(4) ηinj = Ipc/Ikospc(5)
Combining the result of the photocurrent collected in K2S2O8 solution (Fig. S12†),  is estimated to be 10, while,  is estimated to be 3.4. Therefore, the specific value of ηCr-BOC/Aginj and ηBOCinj is 2.94, indicating that a higher charge density is injected into Cr-BOC/Ag compared with the BOC photocatalysts. This change mainly comes from the formed hot electrons produced by the Ag NPs and self-generated electron–hole pairs resulting from the narrowed band gap. Besides, since the light absorption (ηabs) is definite for the same sample under the same irradiation condition, the charge separation (ηsep) of BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag is positively correlated with Ikospc. As shown in Fig. S12,† the photocurrent intensity of Cr-BOC/Ag is much higher than that of BOC, demonstrating the effective charge separation of Cr-BOC/Ag. The high charge injection efficiency and effective charge separation result in significantly enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Cr-BOC/Ag.
Based on the above-present analysis, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity for the Cr-BOC/Ag visible light-based photocatalytic reaction system is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 1. In the photocatalytic reaction process, the Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts are excited under visible light to produce electron–hole pairs owing to the narrowed band gap (Eg = 2.77 eV). The photogenerated electrons will quickly transfer to the Cr impurity level because of the surface oxygen vacancies, Cr active sites and modified Ag NPs, resulting in the effective charge separation. Besides, the Ag NPs can absorb photons to generate hot electrons because of the LSPR effect. Subsequently, the formed hot electrons and photogenerated charge carriers will inject into the CB of Cr-BOC/Ag via the intense plasmon-induced electromagnetic fields and BiOCl self-induced internal electric field. Therefore, a large number of photogenerated electrons will be provided to react with dissolved O2 for the formation of ˙O2−. Due to the strong oxidization ability, partial superoxide radicals directly participate in TC degradation, and a part of them are converted to ˙OH (˙O2− + H2O → ˙OOH + OH−, ˙OOH + H2O → ˙OH + 2OH−).58 Meanwhile, a great deal of h+ will remain and accumulate in the VB of Cr-BOC/Ag for TC decomposition because of its high oxidation potential (Fig. S13†). At last, the highly efficient removal of TC is achieved under the endeavor of the formed ˙O2−, ˙OH and h+ active species.

3.9 Application of PFC
A high-performance visible-light-driven photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) was constructed by using Cr-BOC/Ag as the anode, Pt as the cathode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. In the PFC system, the photoanode absorbs light energy to generate photoelectrons and holes. Owing to the presence of an electric potential difference between electrodes, the photogenerated electrons will transport spontaneously from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit to generate electricity. Meanwhile, the remaining holes can directly degrade pollutants and the electrons arriving at the cathode can react with O2 to form ˙O2− for pollutant removal, which achieves the energy conversion and contaminant degradation.5,59 The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are important indicators used to estimate the performance of PFC. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of BOC, Cr-BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag photoandoes with different fuels are shown in Fig. 10. The fill factor can be expressed as the following equation:60 (6)where JVmax is the maximum power of the PFC. All parameters are listed in Table 1. The current–voltage curves of PFC show that the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode exhibits the highest Jsc in all samples, indicating a greater number of photoelectrons were generated and transferred onto the Cr-BOC/Ag surface. This result is ascribed to the enhanced visible light absorption, increase rate of charge carrier formation and high charge transfer efficiency of Cr-BOC/Ag. In addition, the Jsc value of PFC in RhB solution is higher than that of MO and TC. Because the photogenerated electrons come from the catalysts themselves and the sensitized RhB molecules when RhB is used as fuel, this results in the higher electricity generation. However, when MO or TC is used, the electrons can only be produced from the catalysts themselves, thus, the PFC performance obviously reduces. Compared with the BOC photoanode, a relatively high photocurrent signal can be detected on the Cr-BOC and Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode and the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode exhibits the best cell performance in all the samples, which indicates the marked enhancement of visible light absorption and charge separation by Cr doping and Ag modification. This result also can be proved by the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PFC with the different photoanode (Fig. S14†). In addition, the effects of pH and temperature on PFC performance were investigated. As shown in Fig. S15(a),† the Jsc and JVmax of PFC decrease with the increase of the pH value when RhB solution is used as fuel. The reason can be attributed to the fact that the high concentration [H+] is beneficial for the electron transfer.61 Furthermore, the pH can influence the adsorption ability of the photoanode for RhB, which is demonstrated in our previous work.11,62 Commonly, under low pH conditions, the BOC has a strong RhB adsorption capability. Therefore, a high PFC performance is obtained under pH 2.0. Fig. S15(b)† shows the effect of the reaction temperature on PFC performance. It can be clearly seen that the electrochemical performances of the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode increase with the increase of temperature. This may be because high temperature can enhance the electron transport efficiency, chemical reaction rate and pollutants adsorption capacity.63 In conclusion, the PFC performance can be markedly enhanced by decreasing the pH value and increasing the reaction temperature.

Pollutant removal is another parameter to reveal the PFC performance. As shown in Fig. 11, about 75.1% of RhB (evaluated by color) can be removed with the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode in 240 min under visible light irradiation, which is higher than that of MO (30.1%) and TC (51%). Besides, compared with the BOC and Cr-BOC photoanode, the pollutant removal efficiency of the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode is higher, revealing its excellent PFC performance (Fig. S16†). The improved visible light absorption and LSPR effect of the Ag NPs are responsible for the significant enhancement on the pollutant removal efficiency. The above results confirm that the high-performance visible-light-driven PFC is achieved by using Cr-BOC/Ag nanosheets.

In order to assess the conversion efficiency between chemical energy and electrical energy in a PFC system more accurately, the coulombic efficiency, Ec, is proposed, expressing the ratio of actually transferred total coulombs to the maximum possible Coulomb if all substrate removal produced current. The Ec for the PFC can be calculated as the following equation:5,64 (7)where F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1); M is the molar mass of oxygen (32 g mol−1);  expresses the integrated current over experiment time; b is the number of electrons exchanged per mole of oxygen and equals 4; V is the volume of the reaction system; and ΔCOD is the change of chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration during reaction time, which can better describe how much of the available fuel is converted to electrical current than using color removal for organic wastewater. Combination with the result of current–time shown in Fig. 12(a), the actually transferred total Coulombs of PFC assembled with the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode by using RhB, MO and TC as fuels are calculated to be 0.443 C, 0.0259 C and 0.173 C, respectively. Fig. 12(b) shows the COD values of RhB, MO and TC before and after light reaction. Therefore, the resulting Ec values are calculated to be 8.38%, 1.53% and 5.6%, respectively. Obviously, when RhB is used as fuel, the best photoelectric conversion performance of PFC can be achieved. This result is primarily attributed to the significant enhancement of the RhB degradation efficiency via the synergistic effect of the indirect dye photosensitization pathway and direct semiconductor photoexcited pathway. The Ec values of PFC assembled with BOC and Cr-BOC photoanodes are also calculated and all listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanode has the highest conversion efficiency among all of the samples by using different fuels, indicating the enhancement of the photoelectric performance by Cr doping and Ag NPs modification. Practically, Ec can be further increased by enhancing the light absorption capacity of the photoanode, increasing the interfacial contact area between the electrode and fuel and speeding up the photogenerated charge carrier transfer. We will further study in our future work.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully created a novel visible-light-driven photocatalytic fuel cell system based on Cr doped and Ag modified BiOCl photocatalysts and demonstrated that the advantageous combination of the LSPR effect induced by metallic Ag nanoparticles and Cr doping effect contribute to the enhanced visible light harvesting, increased ratio of charge carrier generation and fast charge transfer of Cr-BOC/Ag, resulting in the substantial enhancement of visible light photocatalytic activity and photoelectric conversion efficiency. Electrochemical characterization and photoluminescence spectroscopy analysis revealed the acceleration effect of the Cr doping and SPR-induced localized electric fields on the electron transfer, responsible for the efficient charge separation. Free radical trapping experiments and ESR results confirmed that h+, ˙O2− and ˙OH participated in the photocatalytic degradation process. Also, more oxidative species could be produced in the Cr-BOC/Ag photocatalysts owing to the narrowed band gap and greater number of hot electrons injected. As a result, about 75.1% color removal efficiency and 8.38% coulombic efficiency were obtained on the Cr-BOC/Ag photoanodes by using RhB as fuel under visible light irradiation for 240 min, which are higher than that of MO (30.1%, 1.53%) and TC (51.1%, 5.6%). Our work expects to provide a new idea on the design and construction of highly efficient visible light photocatalytic fuel cells.
