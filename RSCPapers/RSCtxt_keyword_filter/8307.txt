    , Accepted 15th August 2011First published on 1st September 2011AbstractA systematic approach was followed to develop a new counter-electrode consisting of a highly reflective polymer substrate and a highly conductive polymer for use in dye-sensitized solar cells. The reflection of the incident light from the substrate allows more solar light to be harvested by the dye. We compared the photovoltaic performance of the TCO- and Pt-less counter-electrodes based on the reflective and pristine polymer substrates. The optimal DSSC composed of the TCO- and Pt-less counter-electrode exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 6.15% when measured using an AM1.5G solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 light illumination.

Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) offer considerable promise for future commercialization due to their low production cost and moderate conversion efficiency.1–3 The working principle of DSSCs is based on efficient electron injection from a photo-excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles and subsequent dye regeneration and hole transportation to the counter-electrode.4 Typical rigid-type DSSCs are composed of a mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal electrode on a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, sensitizers on the TiO2 nanocrystals, platinum (Pt) on the FTO substrate as a counter-electrode, and iodine/iodide electrolytes between the two transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates.
Recently, flexible systems, employing conductive-plastic-film substrates, have been considered for the commercialization of DSSCs, because they enable the fabrication of lightweight, thin, and low-cost DSSCs through roll-to-roll mass production.5 Underlying the development of flexible systems, plastic substrates have been used because of their low cost and high flexibility. In most cases, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) or poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) substrates were used as a support film for the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO), because of their low cost and high transparency.6,7 Until now, the substrate itself did not have play any role in improving the cell efficiency, since the polymer film employed in these systems plays no direct role in incrementing the light harvest efficiency.
Small sized TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) with a high specific surface area have generally been employed to make conventional nanocrystalline TiO2 films. Unfortunately, because of their poor light scattering characteristics, another scattering layer has been applied to the nanocrystalline film in simulations and some experimental studies to increase the light harvesting by the increasing the optical path in the TiO2 layer.8–10 In the case of a flexible substrate based DSSC, however, this conventional structure is not acceptable, because it is not possible to prepare a relatively thick double layered film without using high-temperature annealing. In addition, when plastic-based DSSCs are bent, there is some possibility of the thick dye-coated TiO2 electrode and Pt electrode coming into contact with each other, resulting in an internal short.
There have been significant efforts to maximize the utilization of the incident solar light by controlling the photoanode structure, while little attention has been paid to manage the light path from controlling the counter-electrode.11–13 Multilayer polymer films, which can increase the amount of light reflected, constitute one possible method of managing the light path. Multilayer consisting of alternating nano-scale polymer films with different refractive index exhibits perfect reflection as well as flexibility that provide a potential optical material for managing the light path.14,15 In our previous results, we reported that a reflective film applied on the exterior of the counter-electrode of DSSCs can increase the power conversion efficiency.16
In this study, a multilayer polymer mirror was chosen as the substrate for the counter-electrode. To achieve a Pt- and TCO-free counter-electrode, as our group recently reported,17 a highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) polymer exhibiting high catalytic ability was coated on (directly synthesized onto) the mirror substrate and used simultaneously as a catalyst for I3−reduction and for charge transport. The approach described herein has several advantages over previous counter-electrodes, viz. simultaneously: (1) the mirror polymer film and conducting polymer are flexible and light-weight. (2) The substrate has a high reflectance and, hence, the incident light can be reflected by the film which acts as a scattering layer. (3) The PEDOT that is applied has high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, thus enabling a TCO and Pt free counter-electrode to be made. In this manuscript, we describe the positive effects of polymeric 1D photonic crystals with broadband high reflection when used as the substrate for the Pt- and TCO-less counter-electrode in a DSSC. A schematic diagram of the DSSC prepared with the PEDOT coated mirror polymer film counter-electrode is shown in Fig. 1. In general, light absorption for thin-film solar cells is proportional to its thickness and increases in the optical path can significantly enhance the efficiency.18 Because general photoanode composed of dye and nanocrystalline TiO2 film cannot absorb all the incident solar light as can be seen in Fig. S1†, the light scattering at the polymer substrate increases the path length of the incident light, as can be seen in Fig. 1.

The total reflectance of the polymeric mirror film was almost the same as its specular reflectance. Then, highly conductive PEDOT thin films were prepared on the substrate via vapor-phase polymerization with the addition of imidazole based derivatives (see ESI†).19
The PEDOT films were prepared by vapor-phase polymerization. The 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomers were directly polymerized on the ferric p-toluenesulfonate (FTS) coated polymeric mirror film. 40 wt% solutions of FTS or FTS/weak base in 1-butanol were prepared as oxidants. First, after coating the oxidant solution on it (oxidant solutions are cast onto the substrate followed by prebaking for 15 min at 80 °C to remove solvent), the polymeric mirror film was transferred to a vapor-phase polymerization chamber. After the polymerization process for 10 min at 80 °C, the PEDOT film on the mirror substrate was immersed in distilled water to remove any unreacted oxidant and then thoroughly dried in air.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show photographs of the neat and PEDOT coated mirror films, respectively. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b), the thickness of the PEDOT film used was about 1.33 μm. The surface morphologies of the neat (c and e) and PEDOT coated mirror (d and f) films were investigated by SEM and AFM. In the SEM images, very smooth film morphologies were observed in both cases. The SEM images reveal that the PEDOT polymer is almost uniformly coated on the substrate. To investigate the film morphology in detail, the RMS roughnesses of the surface of the PEDOT coated and neat mirror films were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f), the neat mirror film has a fairly flat surface with a root mean square roughness of about 1.96 nm, whereas that of the PEDOT coated mirror film is about 4.57 nm.

The reflection behaviors (total: Fig. 3(a), specular: Fig. 3(b), diffuse: Fig. 3(c)) of the substrate were measured using a Cary 600i UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Varian). The total reflection of the polymeric mirror film was almost the same as its specular reflection. No diffuse reflection was observed, as can be seen in Fig. 3(c), demonstrating that the reflection is fully specular. After depositing the PEDOT layer on the mirror film, the counter-electrode still exhibits reflective characteristics and all of the reflection is specular in origin. Wavelength of the reflection by the PEDOT coated substrate well corresponds to pale blue appearance of the PEDOT coated surface. Based on these data, it is expected that the incident light can be reflected by the counter-electrode, resulting in the re-use of the transmitted solar light.

The performances of the DSSCs with the different substrates for the TCO and Pt-free counter-electrodes were directly compared by fixing the other parameters, such as the (thickness of the) TiO2 layer, dye, electrolyte, and conditions of cell assembly. A commercialized TiO2 paste was used to make a 13 μm-thick single-layer TiO2 nanocrystalline films on the FTO substrate. After heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min, the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 dye solution. The dye-adsorbed photoanode and PEDOT only coated flat PES film or polymeric mirror film were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot melt of polymer film (Surlyn, Dupont 1702). As an electrolyte, 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine were prepared in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15). Then, one drop of the electrolyte solution was introduced into a hole drilled in the counter-electrode of the assembled cell, followed by sealing the holes using a microcover glass and Surlyn. The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs with an active area of ∼0.15 cm2 were measured using simulated solar light at AM 1.5.

Fig. 4(a) represents the J–V characteristics of the devices with the two different TCO and Pt free PEDOT based counter-electrodes having different substrates. For comparison, the J–V characteristics of the devices with Pt/FTO counter-electrode are also shown in Fig. S2†. When the counter-electrode was prepared from PEDOT/PES (polyethersulfone) as the reflectance system, the DSSC exhibited a Jsc of 11.44 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62, and an overall conversion efficiency of 4.86%. On the other hand, the performances of the DSSCs based on the PEDOT/polymeric mirror substrate based counter-electrode showed an FF of 0.62, a Jsc of 14.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.69 V, and a conversion efficiency of 6.15%. It was confirmed from the I–V curves that the increase in the Jsc value is mainly caused by the light reflection due to the polymeric mirror substrate. This implies that the enhancement of the light absorption by light scattering can be achieved by simply using a light reflective polymer substrate.

(b) IPCE spectra of the DSSCs with counter-electrodes based on two different substrates. (c) The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs with the various counter-electrode substrates. 

Fig. 4(b) shows the enhancement of the Jsc when the mirror polymeric substrate is used for the counter-electrode. The maximum value of the IPCE for the DSSC occurs at around 550 nm, which corresponds to the absorption peak for N719. In the case of the DSSC with the mirror polymeric substrate, the IPCE is increased over the range of the visible region. However, a more noticeable enhancement is observed between 400 nm and 500 nm. This behavior is well matched with Fig. 3. As can be seen in Fig. 3, incident light with relatively short wavelengths showed greater reflection from the PEDOT coated polymeric mirror film.

Fig. 4(c) shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs, prepared with counter-electrodes made with the different polymeric substrates. The frequency range was 10−1–106 Hz. Two distinct semicircles are observed for both DSSCs. The semicircles in the higher frequency region (∼kHz range) are associated with charge-transfer at the counter-electrode and/or the electrical contact between FTO/TiO2 or TiO2 particles and those in a 10–100 Hz range are related to a charge-transfer process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. There is no noticeable difference in the impedance spectra of the two DSSCs. In addition, the impedance behavior of the PEDOT coated glass substrate based DSSC was comparable to that of the plastic substrate based one. From Fig. 4(c), we can conclude that the polymeric mirror substrate employed herein did not affect the cell resistance.
In this study, we described the preparation of the first highly efficient DSSC with Pt- and TCO-less counter-electrode. The investigation of the cell performance by measuring the J–V curve and IPCE shows that the reflective polymer films have good potential to be used in flexible Pt- and TCO-less counter-electrodes. The fabricated DSSC with Pt- and TCO-less counter-electrode based on the polymeric mirror substrate has high Jsc, Voc, FF and IPCE values of 14.2 mA cm−2, 0.69 V, 0.62 and 6.15%, respectively. Since the smart optic materials are expected to provide a breakthrough for the current limitation of solar cells, it is anticipated that this simple strategy can stimulate the use of a unique type of substrate that has some positive effects on the cell performance.
