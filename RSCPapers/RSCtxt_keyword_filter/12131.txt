    , Accepted 12th April 2011First published on 16th May 2011AbstractNine kinds of carbon materials were introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) system as counter electrodes (CEs). We also compared the electrochemical catalytic activity of these carbon materials with Pt for the reduction of triiodide to iodide by measuring cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization curve. The nine kinds of carbon materials in this work included synthesized well-ordered mesoporous carbon (Com), activated carbon (Ca), carbon black (Cb), conductive carbon (Cc), carbon dye (Cd), carbon fiber (Cf), carbon nanotube (Cn), discarded toner of a printer (Cp) and fullerene (C60). All carbon materials showed electrochemical catalytic activity for triiodide reduction in the DSCs system. In particular, the synthesized Com showed excellent electrochemical catalytic activity which can be comparable to the performance of Pt. After optimizing the proportion of TiO2 added into the carbon paste and the spray time of the carbon paste, the DSCs based on these carbon CEs achieved energy conversion efficiencies of 2.8–7.5%. The results demonstrate that carbon material is a promising substitute for the expensive Pt CE for low-cost DSCs.

Broader context
To solve the increasingly serious energy issue, much attention has been focused on solar energy. To date, photovoltaic devices are the most powerful tools for converting solar energy to electrical energy. Amongst various photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) stand out as the third generation solar cell. As a crucial component of DSCs, the counter electrode (CE) is Pt loaded on the conductive glass as a catalyst for reduction of triiodide. However, the high price and limited reserve of Pt restrict DSCs development seriously. Herein, to overcome this issue, well-ordered mesoporous carbon (Com) was synthesized and introduced into DSCs system as the CE. The as-prepared Com CE is comparable to the performance of the conventional Pt CE. Furthermore, we also investigated the electrochemical catalytic activity of 9 kinds of carbon materials. The results show that carbon material is a promising alternative to the expensive and scarce Pt for low-cost DSCs. This may open up a new way for the industrialization of DSCs.

1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high energy conversion efficiency, low cost, environment-friendliness, simple fabricating procedure, and better plasticity.1,2 Commonly, a DSC is composed of a photoanode sensitized by a dye, an electrolyte containing a redox couple (triiodide/iodide), and a counter electrode (CE), usually made of Pt. However, the mass production of DSCs is restricted due to high costs and poor stability. To solve these problems, Pt-free CE materials, new sensitizers, novel fabrication processes, quasi-solid and all-solid state DSCs have been investigated.3–9 In our previous research, Pt was deposited onto several substrates as CEs in DSCs and the impact of the Pt film thickness on the performance of the DSCs was also evaluated.10–12Pt CE shows high electrochemical catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. However, Pt is scarce and expensive. It is therefore urgent to explore substitutes for Pt to make DSCs more competitive among various photovoltaic devices. One approach is to use non-Pt catalysts that contain precious metals with limited abundance or limited world distribution. Another approach is to replace Pt with abundant, non-precious materials not susceptible to price inflation during high demand.13 The second approach is better in reducing the cost of DSCs.
So far, several kinds of non-Pt materials have been proposed as CEs in DSCs, such as carbon materials, conductive organic polymers, and inorganic materials.5,6,14–23Carbon materials attracted much attention due to their high electrochemical catalytic activity, low cost, and excellent corrosion resistance against the redox couple. And these carbon materials included activated carbon (Ca), carbon black (Cb), carbon nanotube (Cn), and nanocarbon.14–17,24–27 However, there is no through comparison for the electrochemical catalytic activities of various carbon materials as CE in DSCs system under the same conditions.
In this paper, we developed several kinds of carbon materials used as CEs in DSCs system and compared their performance with the traditional Pt CE under the same conditions. The carbon materials included Ca, Cb, conductive carbon (Cc), carbon dye (Cd), carbon fiber (Cf), Cn, synthesized well-ordered mesoporous carbon (Com), discarded toner of a printer (Cp), and fullerene (C60). In addition, to improve the bonding strength between the carbon materials and the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate, we added TiO2 particle (P25) to the paste of Cc and optimized the adding amount of P25. Further, we investigated the impact of spray time of Cc paste on the performance of Cc CEs. Based on the optimum conditions, the energy conversion efficiencies of the DSCs based on the nine carbon CEs were 6.6%, 6.3%, 6.7%, 7.5%, 6.7%, 7.0%, 7.5%, 4.3% and 2.8%, which were in the order of Ca, Cb, Cc, Cd, Cf, Cn, Com, Cp, and C60 CEs, respectively. We conclude that Com and Cd CEs show excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for triiodide reduction among the nine kinds of carbon materials, which can match the performance of Pt CE.
2. Experiments

        Com is synthesized with a simple modified one-pot chemical method.28,29 Add 2.5 g polyethylene-polypropylene glycol (F127) to a solution containing 10 mL water and 10 mL ethanol, stir for 30 min. Then add 1.6 g resorcinol and 0.2 g HCl (37 wt%) to the solution. Stir for 1 h until the solution became light yellow color. Next, add 2.4 g formaldehyde (37 wt%) to the solution and let the solution stand in the dark for five days until it separated into two layers. After discarding the upper layer, the under layer was cured at 90 °C for three days until it turned into an ivory gel. Then, the ivory gel was thermally decomposed at 800 °C in N2 for 3 h, and a well-ordered mesoporous carbon was obtained. Cp is the discarded toner of a printer. Ca, Cb, Cc, Cd, Cf, Cn, and C60 used in this work were purchased.
The nine kinds of carbon electrodes were prepared with a similar method described as follows. As an example, the preparation of Cc electrode is shown here. A mixture of 100 mg Cc and 10 g zirconium dioxide pearl was dispersed with 10 mL of isopropanol in an agate pot. The mixture was milled for 4 h with a star ball mill (QM-QX04, Nanjing NanDa Instrument Plant). Then, different amounts of TiO2 particle (10, 20, 50, 100, 200 mg) were added to the carbon paste, and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, resulting in Cc paste. The prepared paste was sprayed onto FTO glass (Asahi Glass, type-U, 14 Ω/□, Japan) with an air brush (TD-128, Tiandi Co., Ltd.) connected a mini compressor (TC-118, Aihui Co., Ltd.). Then, the FTO glass coated with carbon paste was sintered in a tube furnace in N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min, after which the Cc CEs were fabricated. Pt electrode was prepared according to our previous research.10–12 A TiO2 film loaded on the FTO glass with a doctor-blading technique was used as the photoanode. An 8 μm thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles (Degussa, Germany) was sintered at 500 °C and cooling to 80 °C. The nanocrystalline TiO2 film was immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (v:v = 1:1) for 12 h. The DSCs were fabricated with a photoanode, a CE, and an electrolyte containing 0.06 M of LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The DSCs with active area of 0.2 cm2 were used for photovoltaic performance test. The symmetrical dummy cell was assembled by two identical electrodes filling the electrolyte similar to the one used in fabricating DSCs. The active area of the dummy cell was 0.25 cm2. The symmetrical dummy cells were used in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments and Tafel-polarization test.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment was conducted using an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, RIGAKU). Nitrogen sorption measurement was carried out with an Antosorb-1 Apparatus (Antosorb-1, Quantachrome, USA), and the surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The surface morphology of the carbon materials was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using FEI Hitachi S-4800 and KYKY 2800 and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with Tecnai G2 Spirit. EIS experiment was carried out using a computer-controlled potentiostat (Zenium Zahner, Germany). The measured frequency ranged from 100 m Hz to 1 M Hz, while the AC amplitude was set at 10 mV.The bias of all EIS meaments was set at −0.75 V. The EIS spectra were fitted by Zview software. Tafel-polarization curve was measured with an electrochemical workstation system (LK-9805, Tian Jin Lanli Inc.). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. Photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was conducted in simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, Solar Light Co., INC., USA) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution, which was contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BAS 100B/W electrochemical analyzer. Pt worked as a CE, and Ag/Ag+ worked as a reference electrode.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the Com and the diffraction peaks at 23.62° and 42.96° correspond to amorphous carbon. The broad diffraction peaks demonstrate that Com exists as amorphism phase with very small size.28 The surface area of the Com is 659 m2 g−1 calculated by BET method.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM and TEM images of the Com powder. Fig. 2a is the surface mophology of the Com powder which is piled up with carbon blocks. The carbon block is built by rows of well-ordered carbon walls with width of about 10 nm. And the carbon walls are accumulated with carbon nanoparticle with small size as Fig. 2b shown. Fig. 2c shows the cross-section of the well-ordered carbon walls presenting a mesoporous structure and this configuration is beneficial to the redox couple diffusion in the electrolyte.

Subsequently, we compared the properties of nine kinds of carbon materials (Ca, Cb, Cc, Cd, Cf, Cn, Com, Cp, and C60) at the same conditions. Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of the nine carbon materials. Ca, Cb and Cc are all built with carbon blocks with a size from 50 nm-2 μm. Cd and Cp are built with uniform particles with a diameter of 20∼30 nm. It can be clearly seen that the diameter of the Cf is 10 μm, and each fiber is built with several finer fiber with a diameter of 1 μm. Cn shows its typical morphology with a diameter of 20∼40 nm. C60 is piled up with irregular blocks and the size is 100 nm∼3μm. The BET surface area of the nine kinds of carbon materials are summarized in Table 1.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activities of the nine carbon materials to reduce triiodide at the same conditions. Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of iodide species for 10 electrodes (nine carbon electrodes and a Pt electrode). Two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks were observed for Pt, Cb, Cc, Cd, Cn, and Cp electrodes. The relative negative pair was assigned to the redox reaction eqn (1) and the positive one was assigned to the redox reaction eqn (2) according to the literature.30 Ca, Cf, Com, and C60 electrodes exhibit one pair of redox peak assigned to the reaction eqn (1). Com electrode exhibits a large current density demonstrating a large electrode active surface area, which leads to a high electrochemical catalytic activity.31 The profile and peak location of the CV for the Cd electrode is similar to Pt electrode. Besides, the Cd electrode holds a large current density compared with Pt electrode indicating a high electrochemical catalytic activity. The two reduction current peaks of the Cp electrode are overlapped may due to the additives in Cp. The nine kinds of carbon materials show different electrochemical catalytic activities for triiodide reduction which affect the performance of the DSCs using these carbon materials as CEs strongly. I−3 + 2e− ⇄ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ⇄ 2I−3(2)

          Cyclic voltammograms of iodide species for various electrodes. The electrolyte solution is composed of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile. The scan rate is 100 mV s−1. Pt electrode is used as CE and Ag/Ag+ works as reference electrode. 
Subsequently, nine kinds of DSCs were fabricated with the nine carbon CEs. To make a comparative research, a DSC with Pt CE was also assembled. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent density-photovoltage (I–V) curves of the DSCs above mentioned and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.The DSCs using Com and Cd CEs reach energy conversion efficiency of 7.5%. These can match the performance of the DSC using Pt CE. In the case of Cd, it is a low-cost carbon material abstracted from the products of incomplete combustion of coal tar and it can be reproduced in mass. As shown in Fig. 3, Cd has a small size and a large surface area ensuring it an excellent electrochenmical catalytic activity resulting in the high photovoltaic performance. The DSCs using Ca, Cb, Cc, Cf, and Cn CEs show relatively high energy conversion efficiencies of 6.6%, 6.3%, 6.7%, 6.7%, and 7.0%, respectively. The Cp electrode also shows a decent electrochemical catalytic activity, and the DSC using this CE gives an efficiency of 4.3%. This could be called waste reutilization. The DSCs using C60 CE achieves an efficiency of 2.8% and the reason for the lower efficiency was disscussed below (EIS and Tafel-polariztion measurements).
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent density-photovoltage (I–V) curves for DSCs using nine kinds of carbon CEs and a Pt CE. 
To evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of the nine carbon electrodes, EIS was measured with the symmetrical dummy cells comprising two identical electrodes as reported in the literature.32,33 In previous studies, internal resistance had a negative effect on the performance of DSCs.34,35Fig. 6a displays the typical Nyquist plots of the dummy cells. The high-frequency (around 100 K Hz) intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The semicircle at the high frequency (100–10 K Hz) region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding chemical capacitance (CPE) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the other one at the low frequency (around 100 Hz) region refers to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the triiodide/iodide redox couple in the electrolyte. The EIS parameters were obtained by fitting EIS plots using an equivalent circuit as Fig. 6b shown. According to Fig. 6a and Table 1, Pt electrode has the smallest Rs, which reflects a good bonding strength between Pt and the substrate. Except for Cp and C60, the other seven carbon electrodes have small Rs in the range of 17.34 to 19.05 Ω. This demonstrates that these carbon materials exhibit a high electrical conductivity and bond with the substrate firmly. The Rct of Cd, Cf, Cn, and Com electrodes are all less than 2 Ω, which means a fast charge transfer velocity in the interface of electrode/electrolyte as compared to Pt. The ZN of the four carbon materials are 5.6, 8.8, 4.0 and 6.4 Ω. Among the nine kinds of carbon materials, the Cd, Cf, Cn, and Com have large CPE of 25.15, 20.25, 36.83, and 35.81 μF indicating a large active surface area due to the porosity of the carbon electrode, which is in conformity with the BET surface area measurements.6 And the impact of the porosity on the catalytic activity has been investigated in previous work.36 The overall impedance of the four carbon materials above mentioned is the major reason for the high photovoltaic performance of the DSC using these carbon CEs. In the case of Ca, Cb and Cc, the Rct are 2.29, 3.42 and 2.89 Ω, respetively. While Cc has a smaller ZN indicating a rapid diffusion velosity of the redox couple in the electrolyte as compared to Ca and Cb. And this is in agreement with the photovoltaic performance of DSCs using Ca, Cb and Cc CEs. As for Cp and C60 electrodes, they have relatively large Rct and ZN because they may contain unidentified impurities that influence the electrical conductivity and the electrochemical catalytic activity inducing a lower photovoltaic performance of the DSCs using the two carbon CEs. To determine the the chemical compositon of the impurities and the subsequent effect on the catalytic activity is a hard work.

To confirm the electrochemical catalytic activities of the nine kinds of carbon electrodes, Tafel-polarization measurements were also carried out in a dummy cell similar to the one used in EIS measurements. Fig. 7 shows the Tafel curves of the dummy cells based on 10 electrodes. It shows the logarithmic current density (Log J) as a function of the voltage (U). As with a literature, at a low sweep rate, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide species in the electrolyte.5,37 Except for Cp and C60 electrodes, the Jlim values of the other 8 electrodes are of the same magnitude according to eqn (3). This illustrates that there is a slight difference of diffusion coefficients among these electrodes. (3)
 Fig. 7  Tafel curves of the symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with various electrodes. 
Where D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, F is Faraday's constant and C is the concentration of triiodide.
The cathodic and anodic branches of the Tafel curves exhibit a large slope for the Cc, Cd, Cn, Cf and Com electrodes, demonstrating a higher exchange current density (J0) on the surface of the five carbon electrodes. This shows these carbon electrodes can catalyze the reduction of triiodide to iodide as effectively as the Pt electrode. Ca, and Cb electrodes also show considerable eletrochemical catalytic activities. While, the curves of Cp and C60 have gentle slopes, indicating they cannot behave as well as the other seven carbon materials in catalyzing triiodide reduction. Besides, J0 is in inverse proportion to Rct based on eqn (4). Combined with EIS results, the change tendency of Rct is in agreement with Tafel-polarization measurements on the whole. Briefly, the EIS results and Tafel-polarization well explain the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs based on the nine kinds of carbon CEs. (4) where R is the gas constant, and Rct, T, n and F have their usual meaning.
In this work, we found that the disadvantage of carbon CEs was the poor bonding strength between carbon materials and the substrate (FTO glass) which strongly affected the performance of the electrodes. To overcome this disadvantage, TiO2 particle (P25) was added into the carbon paste to improve the bonding strength as a binder.17,38 We tried to add 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg P25 into 100 mg Cc paste, and found out the optimum addition amount of P25. Fig. 8a presents the I–V curves of the DSCs based on various Cc CEs containing different amounts of P25. In Table 2, as the added amount of P25 increases, the energy conversion efficiency increases first and then decreases. The short current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) show the same change tendency. The DSC using the Cc CE containing 100 mg P25 reaches an efficiency of 6.7%, which is an improvement of 28.0% compared with the DSC using the CE without P25. However, when we added over 100 mg of P25, the electrochemical catalytic activities of the CEs can deteriorate. For instance, the DSC using the CE containing 400 mg P25 yields a low energy conversion efficiency of 4.2%.

 Fig. 8  (a) I–V curves for DSCs using Cc CEs containing various amounts of P25; (b) Nyquist plots of the symmetrical dummy cells based on Cc electrodes containing various amounts of P25. 
To investigate how P25 can affect the performance of Cc CEs, EIS experiments were carried out with a dummy cell assembled by two identical Cc CEs containing different amounts of P25. According to previous work, the major impact of internal resistance is reducing the power output capability of DSCs represented by the FF, which has a close relationship with the Rs and Rct.39,40Fig. 8b and Table 2 show that the Rs decreases gradually with every increase in P25 from 0 to 50 mg. By adding 50 mg P25, the Rs decreases from 20.65 to 17.60 Ω. This can be attributed to the improved bonding strength between the carbon material and the substrate which makes electrons transmit across the carbon film/substrate interface easily. In addition, adding proper amount of P25 can prevent the aggregation of the carbon particle. This can increase the catalytic active surface area of the CEs inducing a large CPE and a small Rct. The Rct decreases from 5.96 to 2.89 Ω while the CPE increases from 13.97 to 18.84 μF by adding 0 mg to 100 mg P25. ZN shows the same change trend by adding P25. In the other hand, adding more than 200 mg P25 into the carbon paste, the Rs, Rct and ZN increase rapidly due to the poor conductivity of P25.
According to our previous studies, the thickness of the Pt film strongly affects the performance of Pt electrode.41 In this paper, the impact of Cc film thickness on the performance of Cc electrodes was also evaluated and the thickness of the Cc film was controlled by the spray time of carbon paste. We fabricated Cc CEs by different spray time, specifically, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 s. The corresponding thicknesses of these carbon films were in the range of 9 to 70 μm as Table 3 shown. Fig. 9a shows the I–V curves of the DSCs using Cc CEs with different spray time. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The spray time has no significant influence on the open circuit voltage (Voc). While the Jsc increases from 11.51 to 12.41 mA cm−2 as the spray time increases from 10 s to 30 s, which can be ascribed to the increasing catalytic active surface area of the CEs with the increased thickness. The emphasis here is spray time holds a negative effect on the FF of DSCs. It decreases from 67.4% to 55.8% as spray time increases. To achieve high energy conversion efficiency, spraying carbon paste on FTO glass substrate for 30 s is appropriate. Grätzel group also reported the impact of Cb film thickness on the performance of the DSCs. In their work, the thickness of Cb layers was 0.9 to 14.5 μm. The Jsc and Voc changed a little while FF increased as the thickness of the carbon films increased. Their results and our results both demonstrate the thickness of the carbon films affects FF strongly and our result is a good supplement to theirs.25

To determine the charge transfer characteristics of the Cc CEs with different spray time, EIS experiments were carried out. Fig. 9b shows that Rs becomes larger as spray time increases because of the worsening bonding strength between the carbon material and the substrate caused by the increasing interfacial stress. In this work, when the spray time was long enough, we observed that the carbon film cracked and detached from the substrate because of the interfacial stress between the carbon material and the substrate, as well as the internal stress of the carbon film body itself. As spray time increases, the catalytic active area becomes larger represented by the increasing CPE. The value of the Rct decreases from 3.90 to 2.89 Ω as the spray time increases from 10 s to 30 s. If the spray time is more than 60 s, the carbon films may crack slightly. This could lessen the bonding strength and reduce the active area of the carbon film leading to a large Rs, Rct and ZN. Based on the performance of DSCs using Cc CEs with different spray time, we deduce that the decreasing FF could be attributed to the increasing Rs, while the increasing Jsc could be attributed to the decreasing Rct and ZN and the increasing CPE. The above experiments optimize the conditions of preparing carbon electrodes containing optimum amount of P25, as well as the optimal film thickness.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully synthesized well-ordered mesoporous carbon used as CE in a DSC system. The DSC using this carbon CE achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 7.5% which can match the performance of the DSC using Pt CE. We compared the performance of nine kinds of carbon materials as CEs in the DSC system under the same conditions with conventional Pt CE. The Com and Cd electrodes are effective in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide. The traditional carbon materials, such as Ca, Cb, Cc, Cf and Cn aslo exhibit relatively higher electrochemical catalytic activity. The DSC with Cp electrode achived an energy conversion efficiency of 4.3%. It is an economical and environmental method to treat the discard toner (Cp) of the printer. These results demonstrate that carbon is a promising material to replace the expensive Pt as a CE for low-cost DSCs. In addition, we optimized the carbon paste by adding P25 to improve bonding strength between the carbon film and the substrate and obtained the optimum adding amount of P25. Further, we investigated the effect of spray time on the electrochemical catalytic activity for the carbon material and concluded that spraying carbon paste on FTO glass substrate for 30 s was appropriate in achieving a well-performed carbon electrode.

Broader context
To solve the increasingly serious energy issue, much attention has been focused on solar energy. To date, photovoltaic devices are the most powerful tools for converting solar energy to electrical energy. Amongst various photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) stand out as the third generation solar cell. As a crucial component of DSCs, the counter electrode (CE) is Pt loaded on the conductive glass as a catalyst for reduction of triiodide. However, the high price and limited reserve of Pt restrict DSCs development seriously. Herein, to overcome this issue, well-ordered mesoporous carbon (Com) was synthesized and introduced into DSCs system as the CE. The as-prepared Com CE is comparable to the performance of the conventional Pt CE. Furthermore, we also investigated the electrochemical catalytic activity of 9 kinds of carbon materials. The results show that carbon material is a promising alternative to the expensive and scarce Pt for low-cost DSCs. This may open up a new way for the industrialization of DSCs.
