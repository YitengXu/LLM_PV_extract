    , Accepted 12th December 2012First published on 13th December 2012AbstractA high work function anode interfacial layer has been developed via a mild temperature thermal decomposition of fluorinated fullerene (C60F36) on ITO at 120 °C. As revealed by in situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, after the interfacial modification, the ITO electrode work function can be as high as ∼5.62 eV. It also possesses very good air stability even after the exposure to air for more than one day. The thermal annealing induced carbon–fluorine bond breaking was confirmed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The residual F atoms are chemically bonded onto the ITO surface. Taking advantage of such a high work function anode interfacial layer on ITO, enhanced performance of a chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc)/fullerene (C60) planar heterojunction based organic solar cell was observed. The performance enhancement is attributed to the higher anode WF together with the optimal nanoscale morphology, and hence better hole collection efficiency.
Introduction
Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used transparent conductive oxide in optoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).1–5 It is well recognized that the properties at the photoactive layer and the ITO electrode interface are of great importance in determining the device performance.6–12 In an idea case, the Fermi level of ITO should align with energy levels of the active organic material so as to form Ohmic contacts. However, the work function (WF) of the ITO electrode is usually around 5.0 eV even after O2 plasma treatments.13 Hence, the Fermi level of ITO is not deep enough to align with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the active organic materials used in these devices.14–16 The charge (hole) injection or collection is efficient unless the WF of ITO has been further increased to compensate for this large energy level mismatch. Various interface engineering approaches have been developed to achieve the energy level matching at the interface, including O2, Ar, CF4, and SF6 plasma treatments,17–20 UV–ozone treatments,21 self-assembled monolayers,22,23 and additional interfacial layers.24 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used interfacial layer. It helps to reduce the hole injection barrier at the interface between the electrode and the active layer of OLEDs.25 In addition, previous results have demonstrated that transition metal oxides (MoO3, WO3, and V2O5),26,27 tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ),28,29 hexa-azatriphenylene-hexanitrile (HATCN),30,31 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCDA),32 and graphene related materials33,34 were also effective interfacial layers.
The device performance is dramatically improved via this interface engineering, however, adding such an interfacial layer can affect device stability,35 such as the etching of the ITO electrode due to the strong acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS,36 or the air exposure induced significant reduction of the WF of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) by more than 1.0 eV,37–39 and so on. Recently, Helander et al. reported a novel method to chlorinate the ITO electrode using o-dichlorobenzene and UV radiation. Without any additional interfacial layer, the WF of chlorinated ITO was as high as 6.1 eV, resulting in good matching between the energy levels of ITO and the active light-emitting materials.40
In this work, we demonstrate a high WF anode interfacial layer via a mild temperature thermal decomposition of fluorinated fullerene (C60F36) on ITO at 120 °C. As revealed by in situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, the WF of ITO increases to 5.62 eV upon the modification. Moreover, the modified ITO electrode exhibits good air stability. There is no apparent WF change after the exposure to air for more than one day. Using such a high WF interfacial layer, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc)/fullerene (C60) planar heterojunction based organic solar cell increases from 0.70% to 1.49%. The improved device performance is attributed to the enhanced hole collection efficiency at the ClAlPc/ITO interface.
Experimental section

In situ UPS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in our customer-built ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system with a base pressure better than 1 × 10−10 mbar.41 UPS measurements were performed with He I (21.2 eV) as the excitation source. Vacuum level shifts were measured from the linear extrapolation of the low kinetic energy part of the UPS spectra with a −10 V sample bias. The sample WF (φ) was obtained through the equation of φ = hν − W, where W is the energy difference between the substrate Fermi level and the low kinetic energy cutoff.42 The XPS measurements were performed with an Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The binding energies of all UPS and XPS spectra were calibrated and referenced to the Fermi level of a sputtered clean silver sample. All the UPS and XPS measurements were performed at room temperature (RT). Unless otherwise stated, all C60F36 thin films were in situ annealed in the growth chamber for UPS and XPS measurements. Vacuum sublimation purified C60F36, ClAlPc, and C60 molecules were thermally evaporated onto the ITO substrate at RT from separate commercial Knudsen cells (Creaphys, Germany) in the growth chamber. Deposition rates, calibrated by a quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM), of 0.1 nm min−1 for C60F36, 0.2 nm min−1 for ClAlPc, and 0.3 nm min−1 for C60 were chosen in our UPS and XPS measurements.
Solar cell devices were prepared on patterned ITO glass substrates (Rs < 20 Ω □−1), which were cleaned by successive sonication in a detergent (Hellmanex), deionized water, acetone, isopropanol and blow-dried under N2. The substrates were annealed in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h before being loaded into the device growth chamber. For C60F36 modified ITO substrates, they were annealed in an oven at 120 °C for 1 h before being loaded into the device growth chamber. The ClAlPc, C60, and Al layers were sequentially thermally evaporated (1.2 nm min−1 for organic molecules and 6.0 nm min−1 for Al) in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of ∼10−7 mbar. The active area of the device was 0.09 mm2. The thickness of the films was measured by QCM and further calibrated by a surface profiler. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out in an N2 atmosphere (Braun glovebox) under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) conditions using a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in tapping mode under ambient conditions, and the collected data were analyzed using the Nanoscope VI program.
Results and discussion
Previous results have demonstrated that C60F36 is an efficient p-dopant in polymer and diamond due to the high electron affinity (∼5.0 eV).43–45 The deposition of C60F36 on an ITO electrode can induce significant interfacial charge transfer involving the electron transferring from ITO to the C60F36 overlayer, hence raising the WF of the ITO electrode from 4.80 to 5.34 eV, as revealed by our in situ UPS measurements shown in Fig. 1a. After annealing the C60F36 thin film at 120 °C in the growth chamber for 1 hour, the secondary electron cutoff shifted to the higher kinetic energy part, indicating an increase of the sample WF to 5.62 eV. Such a mild temperature thermally treated C60F36 thin film possesses very good air stability. This is essential for device long-term stability of organic electronics. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, there was nearly no apparent change in both the WF and valence band structure for the C60F36 modified ITO electrode before and after the exposure to air for one hour, and one day, respectively.

(c) Schematic diagram showing the effect of polar In–F bonds on the substrate WF. 
To explore the reason of the WF increase after the thermal annealing at 120 °C, we performed temperature dependent in situ XPS measurements on a 5.0 nm C60F36 covered ITO sample. Fig. 2a shows the evolution of F 1s core level spectra for 5.0 nm C60F36 on ITO annealing at 200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C for 1 hour, respectively. In the pristine C60F36 thin film, F 1s was dominated by a single component located at 686.9 eV [peak (i)], which can be assigned to the F atoms in the C–F bonds of C60F36 molecules. After annealing at 200 °C for 1 hour, a new component [peak (ii)] appeared at a lower binding energy of 683.5 eV. Further annealing at higher temperature led to an intensity increase of peak (ii) along with a gradual attenuation of peak (i). Previous results have shown that this new peak at the lower binding energy part can be assigned to F atoms in the metal fluoride.20,46–49 It has been reported that tin fluoride can be immediately hydrolyzed upon exposure to air.50,51 In our case, due to the good air stability, the F is more likely to be chemically bonded to indium rather than tin onto the ITO surface. However, we cannot resolve a separate peak in the In 3d core level for the In–F bond, as shown in Fig. 2c, because the binding energies between In–O and In–F are nearly the same.40

For the C 1s spectrum of the pristine C60F36 thin film, the C–F bond related C 1s component (peak A) was located at a binding energy of 288.2 eV; the lower binding energy shoulder located at 285.7 eV (peak B) is attributed to the C atoms in the C–C bonds;52,53 peak C at 284.4 eV is due to the residue carbon contaminations on the ITO substrate. Upon increasing the annealing temperature, an intensity decrease in peak A was observed, indicating the breaking of C–F bonds within C60F36 molecules. When we increased the annealing temperature to 300 °C, C 1s was dominated by the peak located at a binding energy of 284.3 eV, which is essentially identical (peak position) compared to that of bare ITO except for the higher peak intensity. The thermally decomposed C60F36 molecules can lead to the formation of carbon fragments with a structure similar to the residue carbon contamination on bare ITO, hence resulting in the appearance of the C 1s peak at 284.3 eV with higher peak intensity. Meanwhile, the F 1s peak located at a binding energy of 684.2 eV can still be observed. This suggests that the F atoms are not in the form of fluoro carbon fragments but chemically bonded to the ITO surface. As shown in Fig. S1,† with further increasing the annealing temperature to 430 °C, nearly no F 1s signal can be detected, indicating the desorption of F atoms at the higher temperature. The changes in the WF of the 5 nm C60F36 thin film on ITO as a function of annealing temperature are shown in Fig. 3. It is found that the annealing at temperatures higher than 120 °C leads to the decreased WF of the modified ITO electrode.

Our XPS results reveal that F is bond to In at the ITO surface. This can explain the increased WF of C60F36 thin films after annealing. Because of the large difference in electronegativity between In and F (i.e., 1.78 compared to 3.98),54 the In–F bonds at the surface are polar, and hence introduces a surface dipole layer, thereby resulting in the high substrate WF. The schematic illustration of the increased sample WF after annealing is shown in Fig. 1c.
In addition to the thermal annealing in vacuum, such a high WF anode interfacial layer on ITO can also be obtained via annealing of the C60F36 thin films in an oven under atmosphere conditions. This can largely simplify the device fabrication process. Fig. 4a and b show the evolution of the XPS spectra of F 1s and C 1s core levels for C60F36 thin films annealing in an oven at different temperatures. Similar to the in situ annealing C60F36 thin films under vacuum, a new F 1s component emerged at the lower binding energy part (∼684.1 eV), which can be assigned to the F atoms in the metal fluoride. The breaking of C–F bonds after annealing were also confirmed due to the attenuation of C 1s peak intensity located at the high binding energy part (∼288.1 eV). In addition, the sample WF increased from 5.26 to 5.58 eV after annealing in the oven at 120 °C (shown in Fig. 4c), consistent with that via annealing under vacuum.

Such high WF (∼5.62 eV), mild temperature thermal decomposition of C60F36 thin films is beneficial to the energy level matching at the active layer/electrode interface, and hence improves the device performance. Using in situ UPS measurements, we first evaluate the energy level alignment at the ClAlPc/C60 heterojunction interface in a typical small molecule planar heterojunction based organic solar cell. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the thickness dependent UPS spectra of ClAlPc/C60 on the C60F36 (120 °C annealing for 1 hour) modified ITO electrode. For the 1.0 nm C60F36 thin film after annealing at 120 °C for 1 hour, the WF increased from 5.34 eV to 5.62 eV. During the deposition of the 10 nm ClAlPc thin film, a progressively downward vacuum level shift (∼0.66 eV) was observed. The WF decreased from 5.62 eV to 4.98 eV. For the 10 nm ClAlPc covered C60F36 modified ITO electrode, the valence band was dominated by ClAlPc related features with the HOMO leading edge at 0.50 eV below the Fermi level.

As shown in Fig. 5a, upon further deposition of 10 nm C60 on the ClAlPc thin film, the vacuum level was almost aligned at the ClAlPc/C60 interface, indicating a negligible charge transfer at the interface. At the same time, the C60 HOMO leading edge was located at 1.50 eV below the Fermi level. The schematic energy level diagram at the ClAlPc/C60 is displayed in Fig. 6a.

To demonstrate the enhanced device performance using mild temperature thermal decomposition of C60F36 as the anode interfacial layer, we fabricated organic solar cell devices based on ClAlPc/C60 planar heterojunction. The device J–V characteristics under simulated AM 1.5G light irradiation are shown in Fig. 6c. The device results are summarized in Table 1. Compared to that without any interfacial layer, the device using 120 °C annealing a 1.0 nm C60F36 thin film as an interfacial layer has a higher PCE (∼1.49%), demonstrating that mild temperature thermal decomposition of a C60F36 thin film is an effective interfacial layer. Compared to the control device using PEDOT:PSS as an interfacial layer, a larger short circuit current density was observed (4.20 compared to 3.47 mA cm−2).

The film morphology could have a direct impact on JSC,22,24 and hence AFM measurements were used to investigate the film morphology changes after the introduction of thermal decomposition C60F36 thin films as the anode interfacial layer. Fig. 7 shows the AFM images of a 20 nm ClAlPc thin film on an ITO substrate with and without surface modification. ClAlPc forms larger grains (∼100 nm) on C60F36 modified ITO compared to that on untreated ITO (∼50 nm), possibly arising from the better compatibility of the ClAlPc layer with the modified anode. Moreover, such morphology can help to form percolating paths along which the photogenerated carriers can be readily transported to their respective electrodes, and hence the better hole collection efficiency.55 The observed JSC enhancement may also arise from the more favorable energy level alignment at the ITO/ClAlPc interface. The C60F36 modified ITO anode has a higher WF (∼5.62 eV) compared to that of PEDOT:PSS (∼4.96 eV) or the bare ITO (∼4.8 eV) as shown in Fig. 8b and c. As a result, a reduction of the energy offset between the Fermi level of the ITO anode and the HOMO of ClAlPc was observed. This energy offset decreased from 0.90 to 0.50 eV after C60F36 modification (shown in Fig. 8a). A smaller energy offset between the Fermi level of the ITO anode and the HOMO of ClAlPc can reduce the possible energy loss during the hole-extraction process. It is also noteworthy that the series resistance is still high even for the optimal cell. This is attributed to the relatively high contact resistance between the mild annealing C60F36 thin film and the ITO anode, further improvement is thus needed.

Conclusions
By using in situ UPS and XPS measurements, we performed a systematic investigation of the thermal decomposition of C60F36 thin films on ITO. It was found that F atoms are chemically bonded onto the ITO surface after annealing, introducing a surface dipole layer, thereby resulting in a higher substrate WF of ∼5.62 eV. By using this high WF C60F36 modified ITO electrode, an enhanced device performance for ClAlPc/C60 heterojunction based organic solar cells was observed. The use of the high work function anode interfacial layer together with the optimal nanoscale morphology after surface modification leads to the better hole collection efficiency, and hence the enhanced PCE.
