1. Introduction
The development of efficient, thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers based on earth-abundant materials is critical for enabling terawatt-scale adoption of solar electricty.1 Currently, high-efficiency crystalline Si technologies dominate the PV landscape.2,3 Although metallurgical-grade Si is inexpensive and earth abundant, the high production costs of monocrystalline and polycrystalline wafer-based cells constraints use.2,3 Alternatively, thin-film cells offer a route to substantially reduced costs. The modest PV efficiencies of representative technologies, e.g., CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS),3,4 however, coupled with the toxicity of Cd and the high costs of rare In and Te, have also limited large-scale deployment. Although recent progress has been made in the development of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) as a new absorber,5 deep trap states created by the substitution of Sn(II) on Zn(II) sites may well limit ultimate device efficiency and use.6
To achieve widespread use of solar energy, a diversity of new absorber materials comprising earth-abundant elements and offering the potential for high efficiencies must be identified and developed. The magnitude of the absorption coefficient, shape of the absorption curve, and band gap are critical criteria for selecting such materials. In a recent report,7 we demonstrated with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional method that the absorption of the material Cu3PSe4 is comparable to that of CuInSe2 (CIS). From analysis via the method of spectroscopic-limited maximum efficiency (SLME),8 CIS is reported to be among the top thin film solar absorbers in terms of theoretical cell efficiency (>23%). The SLME for Cu3PSe4 has recently been reported to be 24%;9 it also exhibits a faster rise in absorption coefficient above threshold relative to CIS, offering an opportunity to examine the use of much thinner films in a cell. To enrich our understanding of this material and its derivatives, we have investigated the solid-solution series Cu3PS4−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) as a means to tune band gaps and absorption properties. At the same time, we have assessed electrical properties relevant to the development of solar absorbers. We demonstrate here that these materials exhibit a unique combination of optical and electrical properties of interest for both single and multijunction PV10 as well as for solar-fuel generation.11
2. Experimental
2.1. Powder synthesis and crystal growth
Powder samples of Cu3PS4−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) were prepared by mixing and grinding stoichiometric amounts of the elemental powders Cu (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), P (99.999+%, Materion Advanced Chemicals), S (99.999%, Cerac), and Se (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) under an Ar(g) atmosphere. The samples were then sealed in evacuated fused silica tubes and heated at 480–600 °C for 24 h followed by an additional grinding and heating for 24 h at the same temperature. Pressed pellets were made by cold pressing 12.5 mm diameter disks at 2.5 to 3 tons, and then sintering at the synthesis temperature for 3 h under 10000 psi of Ar gas in a hot isostatic press (American Isostatic Presses, Inc AIP6-30H). Final pellet densities were approximately 70% of theoretical values.
Single crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) with NH4Br (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) as the transport agent. The sample tubes, containing mixed elemental powders and the transport agent (1.5 mg cm−3 for Cu3PSe4 and 5 mg cm−3 for Cu3PS4−xSex), were uniformly heated in a three-zone ATS series 3210 split tube furnace at 500 °C for 12 h. Then, a temperature gradient was applied by setting temperatures to 550 °C (zone 1), 600 °C (zone 2), and 700 °C (zone 3) for 3 days before cooling at a rate of 5 °C h−1 to 400 °C (zone 1), 450 °C (zone 2) and 500 °C (zone 3). The furnace power was then turned off and allowed to cool to room temperature. Black needle-shaped crystals were found at the cold zone of each tube.
2.2. Chemical analysis
Data for compositional analyses of the single crystals were acquired on an electron microprobe (Cameca SX-50) equipped with four tunable wavelength dispersive spectrometers. Operating conditions comprised a 40° takeoff angle and 18 keV beam energy at a current of 20 nA and a spot size of 10 μm diameter.
2.3. X-ray characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer by using Cu Kα radiation. Lattice parameters of powder samples were refined by the use of PDXL software.12 X-ray diffraction data for single crystals were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer at 293 K using Mo Kα radiation. The structures were solved using direct methods and completed by subsequent difference Fourier syntheses and refinement by full matrix least-squares procedures on F2. Absorption corrections were applied by using the computer program SADABS.13 All atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The software for solution and refinement and sources of scattering factors are contained in the SHELXTL 6.10 package.14 Details of the data collection and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1. Positional, equivalent isotropic displacement parameters, and occupancy factors are listed in Table 2.

2.4. Optical and electrical measurements
Optical band gaps were determined from diffuse-reflectance measurements on pressed pellets. Light was directed onto the sample from a DH-2000-BAL deuterium/tungsten halogen source and detected with an Ocean Optics HR4000 UV-VIS spectrometer; MgO powder (99.95%, Cerac) was used as a white reference. The same pellets were used to measure room-temperature resistivity and Hall mobility in the van der Pauw geometry with a LakeShore 7504 measurement system. Majority-carrier type was determined from Seebeck measurements on an custom-built system by applying a 3 °C temperature gradient to the sample.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement
Cu3PSe4 single crystals were prepared as electrodes by first embedding the crystals in mounting wax and forming a back contact by evaporating a 20 nm thick film of Au (99.99%, gold coin). The contacted crystals were attached to tinned copper wire using silver epoxy (Epotech H20C). The wax was then melted and the crystals were removed and washed with acetone. Electrodes were completed by threading the wires through glass tubes and sealing the edges of the sample to the tube with non-conductive epoxy. Electrode surface areas ranged from 0.1 mm2 to 0.8 mm2, depending on the size of the crystal. The area of the electrode was measured from digitally scanned images with the ImageJ analysis package. Solution contacts were made by immersing the fabricated electrode into an electrolyte consisting of 1 mM cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate (98%, Strem chemicals), 0.2 mM cobaltocene in dry acetonitrile, and 0.25 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (>99%, Fluka, electrochemical grade).15 Cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate was recrystallized from acetonitrile/diethyl ether and dried in vacuum overnight before use. Cobaltocene was generated inside the cell by electrochemical reduction of cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate using Pt as the cathode and Pt behind a 4 mm Vycor frit as the anode. Acetonitrile (100%, Mallinckrodt Chemicals) was taken from a solvent purification system and stored over 3 Å molecular sieves. All chemicals were stored in an inert atmosphere glovebox. Measurements were made inside the box using a standard three-electrode cell configuration. The Cu3PSe4 working electrode potential was referenced to a Pt wire poised at the solution potential and separated from the working electrode by ∼2 mm. Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode. All electrochemical measurements were performed using a Biologic SP-200 potentiostat. 100 mW cm−2 of 660 nm light was provided by an LED (Thor Labs LEDD1B, M660L2) that was chopped using a function generator. The light intensity was calibrated by measuring the current produced under illumination of a silicon photodiode (UDT Sensors, Inc. UV-005) of known spectral responsivity that was placed in the cell at the same location as the photoelectrode. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) was determined from the difference between the photoelectrode potential in the dark and under illumination in the absence of current flow. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was determined from the difference between the current density measured under illumination and the current density measured in the dark with the semiconductor working electrode potential held at 0 V vs. the solution potential measured at the Pt reference electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for Cu3PS4−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) are shown in Fig. 1. The experimental Cu3PS4 and Cu3PSe4 patterns are similar to those calculated from previously reported crystal structures.16,17 Intermediate compositions exhibit peak positions between those of Cu3PS4 and Cu3PSe4. They are shifted to smaller 2θ angles as x increases, which is consistent with the substitution of Se for S and an expansion of the unit cell (Fig. 2).

Unit-cell parameters increase linearly across the solid-solution series. Cell parameters are readily calculated from the following relationships:a = (0.102x + 7.293) Åb = (0.082x + 6.334) Åc = (0.076x + 6.069) Å
3.2. Crystal structure of Cu3PS1.89Se2.11 and Cu3PS0.71Se3.29
The crystal structure of Cu3PSe4 was first reported by Garin and Parthé,18 and later refined and corrected.17,19 It adopts the enargite structure, space group Pmn21, similar to Cu3PS4 and Cu3AsS4.16 The structure may be considered to be a derivative of wurtzite with Cu and P ordered across tetrahedral interstices within the distorted close packing of S(Se) atoms (Fig. 3). The structure has been confirmed to be adopted by the two compositions Cu3PS1.89Se2.11 and Cu3PS0.71Se3.29.
 Fig. 3  (a) Crystal structure of Cu3P(S,Se)4, and (b) the distorted tetrahedral coordination of Cu1, Cu2 and P (Q = S, Se). 
Crystallographically, the structure is defined by two distinct Cu sites, one P site, and three Q = S, Se sites. Considering the occupation factors in Table 2, the S and Se atoms are not randomly distributed across the three Q sites. In both structures Se prefers occupation of the 4b site. The bond lengths Cu–Q and P–Q (Q = S, Se) in the solid solutions fall between those of Cu3PS4 and Cu3PSe4, cf., Table 3. The angular distortions of the CuQ4 and PQ4 tetrahedra are rather modest, i.e., Q–Cu–Q ranges from 103.50(4) to 114.39(5)° and Q–P–Q ranges from 108.17 to 112.22(10)°. The increase of Cu–Q and P–Q distances from Cu3PS4 to Cu3PSe4 does not significantly affect the Q–Cu–Q and Q–P–Q bond angles.

3.3. Optical characterization
Optical band gaps obtained from diffuse reflectance measurements for the Cu3PS4−xSex series are shown in Fig. 4. The band gaps of Cu3PSe4 and Cu3PS4 are found to be 1.35 eV and 2.36 eV, respectively. Intermediate compositions with x = 1, 2, 3 exhibit absorption onsets near 1.5, 1.7, and 1.95 eV, respectively, demonstrating optical band gaps can be continuously tuned across the series. Our results are in good agreement with the experimental values for Cu3PS4 (2.38 eV) and Cu3PS3Se (2.06 eV) reported by Marzik and co-workers.20 The observed trend of a decreasing band gap with increasing Se content is commonly observed, e.g., CuInS2 (1.5 eV) and CuInSe2 (1.04 eV). In particular, electronic structure calculations7 establish P 4s – S, Se np antibonding character near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and Cu 3d – S, Se np antibonding character near the valence band maximum (VBM) in Cu3PS4−xSex. The higher absolute energy of the Se 4p states compared to the S 3p states raises the energy of the VBM, while the modest splitting of bonding and antibonding states for the Cu–Se and P–Se interactions vs. Cu–S and P–S interactions, respectively, leads to a lower energy CBM. The net effect is an overall narrowing of the energy gap in the materials with increasing Se concentration.

3.4. Electrical characterization
Resistivity, Hall, and Seebeck data from measurements on pressed pellets are summarized in Table 4. All samples exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients consistent with p-type semiconductor behavior and the prevalence of Cu vacancies within a matrix of d10 Cu1+. Hole carrier concentrations derived from Hall coefficients fall in the range 1016–1017 cm−3, consistent with the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficients. A decrease in resistivity is observed with increasing Se content. This enhanced conductivity is accompanied by a notable increase in hole mobility. This result is consistent with the high covalency of Cu–Se bonding and band broadening, which facilitate delocalization of charge carriers. Typically, Hall mobility is difficult to measure on pressed bulk pellets because of grain-boundary-inhibited transport associated with a polycrystalline microstructure.21 Limited densification can exacerbate issues in making meaningful electrical measurements. Hence, with pellet densities near only 70% of theoretical values, it is somewhat surprising that mobilities were easily measured. The measured Hall mobility, 13 cm2 V−1 s−1, of polycrystalline bulk Cu3PSe4 is comparable to the value, 20 cm2 V−1 s−1, reported for single crystals.22 Clearly, the scattering of charged carriers is low within grains and on grain boundaries – a notable feature for identifying candidate polycrystalline photovoltaic absorbers. Similar hole mobilities (3–22 cm2 V−1 s−1) have been reported for polycrystalline films of Cu(In,Ga)Se2.23

The observed hole concentrations in the Cu3P(S,Se)4 materials are relatively low compared with many other Cu-based chalcogenides (typically >1018 cm−3), e.g., LaCuOS,24 BaCu2S2,25 BaCuSeF,26 BaCuTeF,26 and Cu3TaS4.26 Each of these materials contains an electropositive element, e.g., La, Ba, Ta, with a relatively small atomic solid-state energy.27 The ionic character of the bonding of these elements with S and Se is expected to push the absolute energy of the VBM closer to the vacuum level in comparison with the VBMs of Cu3P(S,Se)4. This energy positioning will favor low formation energies for Cu vacancies, giving rise to high hole concentrations. In compounds such as Cu3PS4−xSex, enhanced covalency arises from the P–S and P–Se interactions, contributing to deeper VBMs and higher Cu vacancy formation energies. These characteristics are expected to lead to reduced hole concentrations and also higher mobilities because of reduced ionized impurity scattering.
3.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
A photoelectrochemical (PEC) test cell with a Cu3PSe4 single crystal was used to assess initial PV device parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Fig. 5 and 6b show the open circuit photovoltage and short circuit photocurrent generated with chopped illumination. The differences between the light and dark response yielded Voc ∼ 0.12 V and Jsc ∼ 0.25 mA cm−2; the p-type character was also confirmed on the basis of the sign of the photoresponse. The non-vertical portions of the Jsc curve as well as the hysteresis in the current density–potential (J–E) response suggest that surface redox processes, likely associated with Cu, occur upon potential cycling. It is possibly associated with anodic discharge by migration of Cu ions through the semiconductor–liquid interface.28 A non-chopped J–E curve in Fig. 6a was measured to estimate the overall energy conversion efficiency (η) ∼ 0.02% and fill factor (ff) ∼ 0.25. Jsc and Voc values were similar to those obtained under chopped illumination (Fig. 5 and 6b).
 Fig. 5  PEC measurement of a Cu3PSe4 single crystal under 100 mW cm−2 a chopped 660 nm light source: (a) Working electrode potential measured under open-circuit (the difference between the dark and light electrode potential is the Voc). (b) Current density at 0 V vs. Esol (analogous to a Jsc measurement for a solid-state device). The small dark current measured at 0 V vs. Esol is attributed to surface electrochemical reactions. 
 Fig. 6  Current density–potential (J–E) curves collected using a Cu3PSe4 single-crystal electrode. (a) Dark and light (100 mW cm−2 660 nm) steady-state measurements collected at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) Data collected using chopped light under similar conditions, sweeping from negative to positive potentials. 
Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, Table 5) shows that the Cu3PSe4 single crystals used as photoelectrodes contained small amounts of O and Br, likely from the crystal-growth process. Oxidation of surfaces could act as barriers at the Cu3PSe4 single crystal surface. Halogen substitution on anion sites from the bromide flux during CVT growth could act as compensating n-type dopants that would decrease the hole concentration and mobility. These effects may play an important role in limiting the observed PEC response. The small size (<1 mm) of the single crystals prevented their further characterization by Hall or resistivity measurements. The pressed polycrystalline pellets also showed p-type photoresponse during PEC evaluation, although with much smaller magnitude than the single crystals and with a larger hysteresis. This may be related to the porosity of the pressed pellets or to grain boundaries. Further studies to control the doping as well as treatments to control surface chemistry are needed to improve the response.

4. Conclusions
The materials Cu3PS4−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) comprise a solid-solution series of p-type semiconductors containing earth-abundant elements. They are found to exhibit continuously tunable band gaps ranging from 2.36 eV (x = 0) to 1.35 eV (x = 4). Hole concentrations are relatively low ∼1016 to 1017 cm−3, and hole mobilities, 1–13 cm2 V−1 s−1, are relatively high. Initial photoelectrochemical studies on single crystals of Cu3PSe4 demonstrated photovoltages of 0.12 V and short-circuit currents of 0.25 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 of 660 nm illumination. The observation of promising semiconductor properties and photoelectrochemical response in these materials provides an important first-step toward their development as PV absorbers. Their tunable band gaps provide unique opportunities for addressing needs in single and multijunction cells for PV with a single absorber materials set. These Cu3PS4−xSex p-type photocathodes could also be integrated with larger band-gap n-type oxide photoanodes, such as Fe2O3 or WO3, to fabricate tandem photoelectrodes with applications in visible-light photoelectrochemical water splitting.11
