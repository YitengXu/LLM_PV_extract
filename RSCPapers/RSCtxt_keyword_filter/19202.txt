    , Accepted 19th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractAll-thin film perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar modules, combining a semi-transparent perovskite top solar module stacked on a CIGS bottom solar module, are a promising route to surpass the efficiency limits of single-junction thin-film solar modules. In this work, we present a scalable thin-film perovskite/CIGS photovoltaic module with an area of 3.76 cm2 and a power conversion efficiency of 17.8%. Our prototype outperforms both the record single-junction perovskite solar module of the same area as well as the reference CIGS solar module. The presented perovskite/CIGS thin-film multijunction solar module makes use of the “4-terminal architecture”, which stacks the perovskite solar module in superstrate configuration on top of the CIGS solar module in substrate configuration. Both submodules apply a scalable interconnection scheme that can accommodate scale-up towards square meter scale thin-film multijunction solar modules. In order to identify the future potential of the presented stacked perovskite/CIGS thin-film solar module, we quantify the various losses in the presented prototype and identify the key challenges of this technology towards very high power conversion efficiencies.
Introduction
The rise of perovskite thin-film solar cells in recent years has opened up an exciting route to advance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of established photovoltaic (PV) technologies.1–3 For the first time, a wide bandgap thin-film PV technology is available at low cost that can be combined with established low bandgap semiconductors, such as crystalline silicon (Si) and copper indium gallium diselenide Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar modules, in a multijunction module architecture with the potential of surpassing PCEs of 30%.4–6 Considering that the current world record PCE of the market-dominant single-junction crystalline silicon solar cells is 26.6%,7 perovskite/Si multijunction solar modules and perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar modules offer great promise for a disruptive change in the PV market.
The key advantage of such a multijunction solar module lies in the efficient exploitation of the solar spectrum. The high energy photons are harvested in the perovskite top solar module with a wide bandgap, consequently resulting in lower thermalization losses of charge carriers, while the low energy photons are harvested in the low bandgap bottom PV module. According to the detailed balance limit, the optimal bandgaps for maximal PCE are around 1.7–1.8 eV for the perovskite top solar cell and around 1.0–1.1 eV for the bottom solar cell. For the bottom solar cell, both (CIGS) and crystalline Si with bandgaps of around 1.0 eV and 1.1 eV are excellent candidates. The commonly used and highly efficient organometallic halide perovskite, methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) has a bandgap of ∼1.6 eV, which is close to the optimum. Moreover, the bandgap of these perovskite materials can be tuned by stoichiometric variations, giving rise to an extensive field of research investigating new perovskite materials that might offer similar high PCEs with an even better suited bandgap.8–10
In general, there exist two types of multijunction solar module architectures, the 2-terminal and 4-terminal. In the 2-terminal architecture, the top and bottom solar cells are monolithically connected such that the power of the entire device can be harvested conveniently via a top and bottom contact. Since the devices are connected in series, it follows that current generation within both the top and bottom solar cells must be equal – a constraint known as current matching. In contrast, the 4-terminal architecture requires individual contact layers and connections for the top and bottom solar cell, but offers the opportunity to harvest the power from each solar cell at its individual maximum power point.
In the past two years, significant progress has been reported on the fabrication and prototyping of perovskite/Si solar cells11–17 and, to a lesser extent, also for perovskite/CIGS13,18,19 solar cells reaching up to 22.1%.20 For 2-terminal perovskite/Si solar cells, PCEs of up to 22% on small scale devices and 19.8% on >1 cm2 aperture areas have been reported.11,17 For perovskite/Si solar cells in the 4-terminal architecture, most publications to date have only report calculated PCEs, where the aperture area of the top and bottom solar cell are not identical, however various reports with values up to 24.5% clearly indicate the enormous potential of perovskite/Si and perovskite/CIGS photovoltaics.21 Recently, the first perovskite/Si multijunction solar module in 4-terminal architecture with a PCE of 20.1% on an area of 4 cm2 was reported.22 The difference in PCE of the solar module and solar cell for perovskite/Si multijunction devices brings to light the challenges in scaling up this technology to large areas.
In this work, we report on a scalable perovskite/CIGS solar module in the 4-terminal architecture. A semi-transparent perovskite top solar module is stacked on a CIGS bottom solar module as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1a. Both solar modules are thin-film technologies that have previously demonstrated compatibility with flexible polymer and metal substrates.23–26 For several applications that require light-weight, flexible and/or curved PV modules, this is a key advantage compared with competing technologies such as perovskite/Si multijunction solar modules. The demonstrated prototype employs the perovskite absorber material CH3NH3PbI3 that ideally absorbs all photons of the solar spectrum with energy higher than its bandgap (1.6 eV) as shown in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, in an ideal device all photons of energies lower than the bandgap of the perovskite should be transmitted to the CIGS solar module to be harvested, which has a bandgap around 1.15 eV. In this work, we describe in detail the architecture of our prototype perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module as well as the thin-film interconnection schemes of the perovskite top solar module and the CIGS bottom solar module. We compare the performance of the perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module with the reference stand-alone perovskite and CIGS solar modules. We further analyze the losses present and discuss the future potential and challenges of this technology.

Prototype perovskite/CIGS solar module
The prototype perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module presented in this work consists of a semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 top solar module in superstrate configuration and a CIGS bottom solar module in substrate configuration. Both submodules were processed separately and subsequently stacked with an air gap in between as shown in the photograph in Fig. 1c. In view of the final product, this architecture offers a straightforward route towards glass–glass solar module encapsulation, but is not limited to the latter as both submodules can also be processed on alternative substrates. The submodules each exhibit a scalable thin-film solar module interconnection scheme, using cell stripes of 7 × 2.86 mm (CH3NH3PbI3 top solar module) and 4 × 4.7 mm (CIGS bottom solar module) each at least 20 mm long. Stacked on top of each other at an orthogonal orientation of the interconnection lines, the combined 4-terminal perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module has a precisely defined aperture area of 1.88 cm × 2 cm (3.76 cm2). Under air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination, our perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module with aperture area of 3.76 cm2 yields an overall PCE of 17.8% (see Fig. 1d), which is the sum of the PCE of 12% measured for the semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 top solar module and the PCE of 5.8% measured for the CIGS bottom solar module (filtered by the CH3NH3PbI3 top module). To our knowledge, this is the highest reported PCE for a perovskite/CIGS solar module so far. Our CH3NH3PbI3 top solar module exhibits very little hysteresis, with the PCE varying only between 11.7–12.0% depending on the measurement direction (details measurement protocol in the method section) as well as a high PCE of 11.9% and almost no decrease in PCE after 10 min of power tracking (see Fig. 2b). Most importantly, with a PCE of 17.8% our prototype significantly surpasses the PCE of reference opaque perovskite solar module (15.3%) as well as the PCE of the reference CIGS solar module (15.7%) (see Table 1). It should be noted, that the considered reference CH3NH3PbI3 module is the champion module fabricated so far on this area with a PCE of 15.3–14.8%, depending on the measurement direction, but also very good stability after 10 min of power tracking.27 It features the same device architecture as the transparent solar module, but uses thermally evaporated Au layer as rear electrode. Also, the state-of-the-art CIGS solar module is fabricated with a scalable and industrially relevant fabrication process and demonstrates a high PCE.28 For these reasons, we remark that the presented prototype perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module demonstrates that the stacked perovskite/CIGS concept can lead to industrially relevant, scalable, and highly efficient solar module technologies.

The development of an efficient semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 top solar module was of uppermost importance for our stacked perovskite/CIGS solar module technology. In Fig. 2a, the detailed schematic of our semi-transparent perovskite solar module is shown. The layer stack consists of a glass substrate with front indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, e-beam deposited titanium dioxide (TiO2), spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3, spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene), and rear electrode. For opaque solar modules this architecture was successfully employed in previous work,29 but here sputtered ITO is used as transparent rear electrode. The interconnection of individual cell stripes is achieved by a combination of laser and mechanical scribing resulting in a module of 4 cm2 aperture area with 7 cell stripes connected in series. As shown in Fig. 2a, the dead area between individual cell stripes, which results from the interconnection scribes, is between 200 μm and 300 μm. The optimal width of the subcells is influenced by a combination of effects of the sheet resistances of the ITO electrodes and the losses in short circuit current density (JSC) incurred via the dead area generated by the interconnection scheme. The detailed analysis of how the module design, width of the cell stripes, and the thickness of the rear ITO electrode were optimized for the given architecture to achieve high performance of the semi-transparent perovskite solar module is described in previous work.22 The optimal width of the cell stripes in our module design was calculated to be around 2.6 mm to 3 mm, which resulted in 7 × 2.86 mm cell stripes on an aperture area of 2 cm × 2 cm in our device configuration (see Fig. 2a). The geometrical fill factor – the ratio between the active area and the aperture area – is 90%, while the transparency for the low energy photons that can be harvested in the CIGS bottom solar module varies around 70–80% for wavelengths between 800 nm and 1100 nm (see Fig. 2c). The CIGS bottom solar module used in this work is fabricated by entirely industrially relevant methods. In fact, the small area module (1.88 cm × 2 cm) used for the prototyping of the perovskite/CIGS solar module is a cut-out from a larger module of 10 cm × 10 cm. The layer stack consists of a glass substrate, sputtered molybdenum back electrode, co-evaporated CIGS absorber layer, sputtered zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, and sputtered aluminium-doped ZnO front electrode. More details on the fabrication of this architecture can be found in ref. 28. The typical monolithic module interconnection is realized by a combination of laser and mechanical scribes similar to the perovskite solar module.28 The width of the interconnection scribes (dead area) between individual cells stripes in this case is around 235 μm and the optimum width of the cell stripes is 4.7 mm, resulting in an overall geometrical fill factor of around 95% (see Fig. 3a). The PCE of the stand-alone CIGS solar module measured over an aperture area of 3.76 cm2 is 15.7%. In the 4-terminal architecture, less light reaches the CIGS bottom solar module since high energy photons with energy above the bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 are harvested in the top solar module and the transmission of the low energy photons is limited due to reflection and parasitic absorption losses.13,24,30 As a consequence, the PCE of the CIGS bottom solar module decreases from 15.7% to 5.8%. This decrease in PCE is mainly caused by a significant decrease in short-circuit current (ISC) from 29.2 mA to 11.5 mA, which is also evidenced by a decrease in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) as indicated in Fig. 3b and c. The open circuit voltage (VOC) of the CIGS bottom solar module also shows a small decrease, since with decreasing light intensity the shunt resistance of the device becomes increasingly important and, in turn, the fractional power loss due to shunt resistance in the devices increases.31

Outlook on the perspectives of perovskite/CIGS solar modules
In order to outline the route towards further improvements in the performance of perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar modules, we analyze the losses affecting the PCE in each submodule (see Fig. 4) and discuss strategies to compensate them. We then provide guidelines to achieve high performance perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar modules by avoiding the various apparent losses as discriminated in detail in the following. Assuming that the presented strategies to avoid these losses are successfully employed and, furthermore, perovskite photovoltaics and CIGS photovoltaics with higher efficiencies are employed, power conversion significantly above 28% are within reach. As a reference of upper performance, we select the experimental solar cell data of opaque small scale (>0.5 cm2 area) CH3NH3PbI3 and CIGS solar cells that were fabricated under the same conditions as the solar modules.

The small scale reference perovskite solar cell achieves a PCE around 16.4%.29 When scaling this technology from an opaque solar cell level to opaque solar module level and finally a semi-transparent solar module, the following losses are apparent and shown in Fig. 4a:
1 Active area loss of perovskite solar modules
The PCE of the perovskite solar module is given for the aperture area. Due to the monolithic interconnection scheme of the perovskite modules (see Fig. 2a), the aperture area encompasses also the inactive areas of the interconnection scheme. For the perovskite solar modules presented in this work, the width of the interconnection region is 200–300 μm, given by the sum of the three interconnection lines and the spacing between these lines. Considering the opaque solar module with 5 mm wide cell stripes, the active area loss accounts for 4–6% relative loss in PCE. In future, the active area loss can be reduced below 3%,27 by reducing further the width of the interconnection lines and reducing the spacing between the interconnection lines. Of key importance in this regard will be the development of laser scribed interconnection lines which typically can be fabricated at lower width and higher accuracy.27 The development of laser scribing moreover, alternative interconnection schemes that allow for advanced geometries can also be explored for better performance.32 It shall be noted that the interconnection region of the perovskite solar module does not induce an optical loss for the underlying CIGS solar module as the interconnection lines remain (semi-) transparent.
2 Upscaling loss of layer deposition on larger areas
By scaling up the area of the device from 0.13 cm2 of the small scale perovskite solar cell to 3.76 cm2 of the perovskite solar module, a certain loss in performance is observed that is attributed to inhomogeneity in fabrication processes and the resultant quality of the layers. Considering that the area of the devices is increased by a factor of 28 in this work, the observed upscaling loss of only 3% is remarkably low and hence the potential for loss minimization here remains limited.
However, if the area will be increased further, alternative deposition techniques for the perovskite absorber layer, the charge transport layers and electrodes need to be advanced. Regarding the perovskite absorber layer, in last two years promising progress based on blade coated,33,34 slot-die coated,35,36 spray coated,37,38 and inkjet printed39,40 perovskite solar cells have been reported already, but yet for areas >10 cm2 large scaling losses are reported. A very high uniformity on larger areas was reported with a novel and highly innovative fabrication method called “soft-cover deposition”.41 The certified record power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar modules on areas of 36 cm2 is 12.1%.42
3 Resistive loss at interconnects (RIC) semi-transparent perovskite solar modules
When replacing the highly conductive rear metal electrode of an opaque perovskite solar module with a sputtered semi-transparent ITO electrode, the module design needs to be adapted to the lower conductivity of the transparent rear electrode. Moreover, the trade-off between electrical conductivity and optical transparency of the ITO electrode needs to be addressed. For the presented multijunction architecture, a cell stripe width around 2.86 mm is optimal for maximal overall performance.22 For this semi-transparent module, an additional area loss is induced compared to the opaque module with a cell stripe width of 5 mm. The increased number of cell stripes in the semi-transparent module also leads to an increase in the interconnection resistance between the ITO electrodes as compared to the opaque solar module. For our semi-transparent perovskite solar modules, the overall resistive losses account for a relative decrease of around 3% in PCE. It is estimated that via implementing a more conductive ITO these losses could be reduced to around 1%. However, the increase in conductivity needs to be carefully balanced against decreased transparency of the semi-transparent perovskite top solar module.
4 Loss in JSC of the semi-transparent perovskite solar modules
For wavelengths longer than 500 nm and shorter than 800 nm, an increasing fraction of incident light is not absorbed by the perovskite top solar module although the energy of these photons is larger than the bandgap of the perovskite (see Fig. 2c). This originates from the decrease in absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 for those wavelengths. As a consequence, the current generation of the semi-transparent top solar module decreases compared to the opaque solar module (see Table 1). This loss in the JSC accounts for a relative decrease of 6% compared to the PCE of the small scale reference solar cell. It should also be noted that despite the partial transmission and harvesting of these photons in the CIGS submodule, a further loss is incurred due to the lower operating voltage of the CIGS solar module. Strategies to overcome this loss factor are employing perovskite absorber layers of increased thickness and a so-called intermediate reflector.43–45 The latter is designed like an optical band pass filter that transmits light of energies smaller than the bandgap of the perovskite and reflects light of energies above the bandgap of the perovskite. Examples of intermediate reflectors based on dielectric thin-film stacks can be found in previous works on tandem thin-film amorphous Si solar cells.43–45
5 Increase in series resistance RS of the perovskite top solar module
As explained above, the ITO rear electrode imposes a trade-off between transparency and conductivity. For the investigated semi-transparent perovskite solar module an optimum was identified for a 200 nm thick ITO rear electrode that exhibits a peak transparency above 85% for wavelengths longer than 800 nm and a sheet resistance of around 65 Ω □−1. Since the sheet resistance is still significantly higher than the ITO front electrode (around 25 Ω □−1), an additional series resistance is induced which lowers the fill factor of the semi-transparent solar module compared to the opaque solar module (see Table 1). The resultant overall relative loss in PCE is around 11%. Strategies to circumvent this loss factor mostly target the development of an improved rear electrode,14,46,47 for example by improving the deposition regimes such that a higher ITO quality, comparable to the front ITO, can be achieved. Alternatively, other transparent conductive materials48,49 that are currently being researched can be implemented or metal (nano-) grids can be employed to replace the transparent conducting oxide conductive oxides.50
The small scale reference CIGS solar cell that was fabricated under the same conditions as the CIGS solar module exhibits a PCE of around 16.6%. When scaling this technology from an opaque solar cell level to opaque PV module level and finally stacking it below a semi-transparent perovskite solar module, the following losses are apparent and shown in Fig. 4b:
6 Active area loss of the CIGS solar modules
The interconnection scheme of the CIGS solar module is already optimized and processed by laser patterning and mechanical scribing. The width of the dead area is around 235 μm that, for the given width of the cell stripes of 4.7 mm, induces an area loss of around 5% in PCE. However, as the width of the cell stripes was optimized for the opaque CIGS solar module, it is expected that much wider cell stripes are beneficent for the CIGS bottom solar module as in a stacked architecture less light reaches the CIGS solar module and lower current densities are generated.
7 Current generation loss of CIGS bottom solar modules
In the stacked architecture, less photons reach the CIGS bottom solar module, which results in a decreased JSC that directly translates to a 58% decrease in PCE of CIGS solar module (see Table 1). To some degree, this decrease is desirable in the stacked architecture, since the high energy photons shall be harvested in the perovskite top solar module and only the low energy photons should reach the CIGS bottom solar module. However, a significant loss originates from the decreased transmittance of the low energy photons below the bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 into the CIGS bottom solar module. This loss accounts roughly for around 10% relative decrease in the PCE of the bottom solar module. It can be reduced by decreasing the parasitic absorption losses of the transmitted light in the transparent electrodes and charge transport layers of the perovskite top solar module as well as using optical layers that reduce parasitic light reflection of incident light. Moreover, index matching layers and advanced optical concepts can be exploited to enhance the transmission of the low energy photons into the CIGS bottom solar module.
8 Voltage losses of CIGS bottom solar module
The decrease in PCE of the CIGS solar module in the stacked architecture is mostly due to a decrease in current generation (see (7) in Fig. 4), but also the VOC of the CIGS bottom solar module shows a small loss since with decreasing light intensity the fraction of charge carriers that recombine non-radiatively increases.31,51 In our prototype this inherent loss due to the stacked solar module architecture accounts for a relative loss in the PCE of around 2%.
Having discriminated the various losses of the stacked perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module, it becomes apparent that most losses of the perovskite top solar module apart from the area losses can eventually be tackled with further advancement of implemented materials like the TCOs as well as the incorporation of new optical light management concepts like the intermediate reflector. Thus, PCEs of the semi-transparent perovskite top solar module around 15–16% are feasible to reach. Considering the further continuous advancement of the baseline technology of perovskite PV, reaching 22.1% in PCE in 2016,7 it is feasible that semi-transparent perovskite solar modules could achieve PCEs of more than 19–20% in the future. For the CIGS bottom solar model, the potential for improvement in PCE is somewhat lower due to this being a more mature PV technology and some losses like the majority of the JSC loss and the VOC are inherent in the stacked 4T architecture. Nevertheless, the optimization of the cell stripes (dead area < 3%), the increase in the transmission of the low energy photons (>85%), and the implementation of record CIGS solar modules is also possible to increase the PCE from 5.8% to around 8%. Altogether, for the scalable perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module technology in focus of this work, high PCEs around 28% are within reach, considering further developments and improvements that tackle the losses discussed here.
Conclusions
In summary, in this work we presented a stacked perovskite/CIGS thin-film multijunction solar module in 4-terminal architecture which shows a PCE of 17.8% on a relevant area of 3.76 cm2. The prototype surpasses the PCE of both, the record single junction perovskite solar module on this scale as well as the reference CIGS solar module. In addition, the stacked module implements a scalable device concept, implementing a monolithic interconnection scheme for both modules and scalable device architectures. In order to show the route towards even higher power conversion efficiencies, a detailed loss analyses is provided that discriminates the various losses in performance between single junction solar cells and the stacked perovskite/CIGS multijunction solar module prototype.
Methods
1 Fabrication of semi-transparent perovskite solar module
Glass sheets with pre-deposited front ITO were purchased from Thin Film Devices Inc. and laser-patterned (P1) to aperture dimensions of 2 cm × 2 cm comprising seven subcells. They were cleaned in ultrasonic baths of detergent, de-ionised water, acetone and isopropanol successively for 10 minutes in each bath. TiO2 pellets supplied by Prof. Feierabend GmbH were then evaporated on the cleaned substrates in an Angstrom Engineering electron-beam evaporation system. More details on the fabrication of TiO2 layer are provided elsewhere.26 The thickness of the TiO2 layer was optimized to around 10–20 nm for the given perovskite precursor system (see also Fig. S3†). The perovskite precursor solution was made by dissolving Pb(CH3CO2)2·3H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), PbCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and CH3NH3I (Lumtec) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma). The concentration of lead in the solution was 0.8 M while the concentration of CH3NH3I was 2.4 M (Pb:CH3NH3I: 1:3). The precursor solution was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s onto the glass/ITO/TiO2 layer stacks. The spin coated films were then annealed on a hot plate inside a nitrogen (N2) glovebox at 130 °C for 10 minutes as described in previous work.29 On top of the annealed perovskite films, a solution of spiro-OMeTAD (80 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) doped with 17.5 μL lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylepyridine was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The perovskite films coated with Spiro-OMeTAD were then kept out in air overnight for oxygen exposure. Before depositing the rear electrode the films were patterned by mechanical scribing (P2) for interconnection of subcells. To complete the layer stack, the rear ITO electrode was deposited by DC magnetron sputtering using a Nimbus 310 sputtering tool. Sputtering at high power has been reported to compromise the underlying Spiro-OMeTAD layer. For this reason, we optimized our sputtering parameters such as power (1000 W), O2 flow rate (6 sccm), Ar flow rate (200 sccm), and base pressure (5 × 10−6 Torr). For the reference opaque perovskite solar, the same device architecture was used, but a thermally evaporated Au layer of 80 thickness replaces the transparent ITO rear electrode. In a previous work, the fabrication of the opaque device architecture has be discussed in much detail.29 A final patterning by mechanical scribing (P3) was done after deposition of rear electrode to create solar modules with seven serially interconnected subcells. More details on the module interconnection can be found in previous work.27 The aperture area of all solar modules was 4 cm2.
2 Fabrication of CIGS bottom solar module
On 1.3 mm thick alkali-aluminosilicate glass an approximately 550 nm thick molybdenum layer is deposited by sputtering. After a laser patterning process, resulting in a linewidth of ∼60 μm for P1, the CIGS absorber is deposited by co-evaporation in an inline deposition system,52 with a thickness of around 2600 nm. After the preparation of a 40–50 nm thick cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer by chemical bath deposition, a 50 nm thick undoped ZnO layer is deposited by sputtering. The mechanical patterning of the P2 line is followed by the sputter deposition of Al-doped ZnO (thickness around 750 nm). Mechanical scribing of the final P3-line of the monolithic interconnection and edge deletion complete the module preparation. P1 and P2 lines are about 100 μm apart and P2 and P3 about 75 μm, resulting in a total dead area of ∼235 μm width.
3 Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar modules were measured in an inert N2 glovebox with a Keithley 2602A Source-Measure Unit and an Abet solar simulator producing 1000 W m−2 simulating AM1.5G solar irradiance. The solar simulator was calibrated with a KG5 band pass and equipped with a calibrated Si photodiode from Fraunhofer ISE. The J–V measurement scans of the perovskite solar modules were made at a rate of 4.9 V s−1 with a step size of 50 mV per step. The maximum power point tracking was done using a perturb-and-observe method under continuous AM1.5G illumination. The J–V characteristics of the CIGS solar module – both stand-alone and in 4-terminal architecture – were measured in air with a Wacom solar simulator producing 1000 W m−2 simulating AM1.5G irradiance calibrated by measurement of a reference crystalline Si solar cell that has been certified by Fraunhofer ISE. The scan rate was 0.25 V s−1 with a step size of 2.7 mV per step. During measurement of the CIGS bottom solar module in 4-terminal architecture, the semi-transparent perovskite top solar module was in short-circuit configuration. An aperture mask with dimensions of 1.88 cm × 2 cm was used for all J–V measurements. Combined with the interconnection scheme this allowed to have a very precise definition of the area. Both the transmittance of the semi-transparent solar modules as well as EQE were measured using an integrating sphere in Bentham PVE300 spectral response setup. Since a large area illumination for the EQE measurement of the semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 solar modules was not available, the EQE of a small-area (0.13 cm2) semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell is shown representative of the large-area module. The EQE of one cell stripe of the CIGS bottom solar module was measured when connecting separately only one cell stripe of the solar module. Both the perovskite and CIGS modules were at zero bias voltage during the EQE measurements.
