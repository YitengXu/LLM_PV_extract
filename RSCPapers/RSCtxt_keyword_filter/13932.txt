    , Accepted 7th January 2015First published on 8th January 2015AbstractScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a powerful technique for quantitative and qualitative investigation of interfacial charge transfer processes. This work presents an SECM investigation on the regeneration kinetics of an organo-metal halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) sensitized onto various semiconductor oxide nanocrystals, including n-type titanium dioxide and p-type nickel oxide. We found for the first time that the regeneration rate constant, and absorption cross section of CH3NH3PbI3 are significantly higher than the conventional sensitizers.
Introduction
Over the last decades, mesoporous dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted growing interests due to their high indoor power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost.1,2 The photo-sensitizer is one of the most important components of DSSCs, which is responsible for light harvesting and charge injection. So far, DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes have achieved PCE of over 10% under standard testing conditions and the highest value being 11.5%.3 Recently, a new benchmark in DSSCs with an overall PCE of 13.0% was achieved by a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) porphyrin (SM315) with a cobalt complex redox couple.4 The use of inorganic semiconductors such as quantum dots as sensitizers in DSSCs in place of metal complexes or organic dyes is advantageous due to their excellent optical properties, high extinction coefficients, and large intrinsic dipole moments.5 According to current research and news reports, the PCE of quantum dots-sensitized solar cells has been improved to exceed 6% and the most widely used materials include CdS, and CuInSexS2−x.6–8 More recently, semiconductors with the perovskite structure (ABX3) have become popular materials for solar cell applications. Particularly, organo-metal halide perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbX3, abbreviated as MA+ and MA ion hereafter, X = I, Br, and Cl) with good intrinsic optoelectronic properties have been synthesized and intensively investigated for optoelectronic applications. The MAPbI3 shows relatively high light-harvesting ability in the near-IR region up to 800 nm, which can enhance the photocurrent under full spectrum solar flux for solar cells. However, when MAPbX3 was used as sensitizer in the conventional DSSC structure, the stability of such cells was found to be very poor, particularly in the presence of I−/I−3 electrolyte.9,10 An overall PCE of about 6.5% was obtained when a liquid electrolyte was used.10 Therefore, organic hole-transport materials (HTMs) have been intensively investigated together with solvent-free polymer electrolytes as potential substitutes for liquid electrolytes.11–13 More recently, efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC) were reported to have a further milestone with an overall efficiency of 16.7% by using meso-superstructured MAPbI3 associated with an organic HTM (spiro-OMeTAD).14
Under illumination, the excitation of the MAPbI3 active layer results in the generation of electron–hole pairs with a low exciton binding energy (being about 20 meV).15,16 The ambipolar charge transport properties as well as long carrier lifetime of MAPbX3 allow the direct transport of photo generated electron and hole charge carriers to the respective charge collective contacts.17,18 It enables MAPbI3 to act as both n- and p-type semiconductors, depending on the type of selective contacts formed with neighbouring semiconductors. As a consequence, PSC devices may have different working principles in comparison with their most immediate predecessors, i.e., DSSCs. Mesoporous TiO2 was first used as scaffold for the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs, which has been well-documented in the literature.19 Recently, NiO has also been introduced into PSCs as an electron blocking layer, because of its higher conduction band energy level compared to MAPbI3 (being about −1.8 eV and −3.93 eV versus a vacuum, respectively).20–23 Photo-induced absorption spectra and photoluminescence measurements have shown that NiO can act as a hole conductor.21–23 Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the regeneration of MAPbI3 onto different selective contacts after photoexcition.
Previous studies have analyzed the effect of electrolytes on dye regeneration, because it is highly related to the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices.24–27 In the past few decades, a detailed investigation on the dye regeneration mechanism in DSSCs has been performed with nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, which provides valuable information on individual electrodes or completed cells.28 Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a technique based on the faradic current changes when an ultra-micro electrode (UME) moves across the surface of a sample. SECM has grown to be a powerful technique for probing a wide range of interfacial processes with high spatial and temporal resolution, including molecular transport across membranes,29 activity of living biological cells,30 and heterogeneous electron transfer reactions.31 Recently, SECM has been used to investigate the dye-regeneration kinetics between redox couples and photo-excited dye molecules, demonstrating the viability of this method for understanding DSSCs.32
This study presents an experimental investigation on the regeneration kinetics of MAPbI3 by using SECM on two types of semiconductor oxides (i.e., p-type NiO and n-type TiO2) in combination with the organic electrolyte 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiolate (T−) and its dimer (T2) electrolyte. The approach curves in the SECM feedback mode are used to analyse the effective rate constant of the regeneration process. This paper also compares the regeneration kinetics of MAPbI3 with conventional sensitizers, such as the organic D–π–A dye P1 and ruthenium complex Z907 dye.33 Even though this is an investigation on liquid based perovskite solar cells, the dynamics of regeneration in perovskite with varied type materials might provide information, which is crucial for an understanding of the best device architecture.23
Experimental section
Chemicals
Terpineol, ethyl cellulose, and NiO were purchased from Aldrich. Organic redox couple T− and its dimer T2, organic dye P1, dye Z907 were synthesized according to reported literature.28,33–37
Film preparation
NiO nanoparticles (particle size ∼ 20 nm) were ground in ethanol with a few drops of acetic acid. Ethyl cellulose (added from highly concentrated ethanol solutions) and terpineol were added into the above colloidal solution. The mixture was sonicated and stirred to obtain a fine dispersion. A paste was made by evaporating ethanol from the mixture with a rotary evaporator. FTO glass Nippon sheets (15 Ω per square) were first coated with nickel acetate in ethanol (0.05 M) by dip coating, and subsequently dried at 80 °C. Then, the substrates were screen-printed with the NiO paste. The NiO electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min with a ramping time of 30 min from room temperature to 450 °C, and then post-treated at 550 °C for 15 min. The TiO2 electrodes were fabricated similarly. After cooling down to room temperature, these films (TiO2 or NiO) were kept in a dye bath (Z907 or P1) for 17–18 h to obtain Z907/TiO2 and P1/NiO electrodes. MAPbI3/NiO, MAPbI3/TiO2 electrodes were prepared by the deposition of MAPbI3 (in DMF) on the top of NiO or TiO2 films and sintering at 100 °C for 5 min.
SECM measurements
SECM experiments were performed on a CHI 920C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Shanghai). A homemade Teflon cell (with volume of 2 mL) was used to hold the Pt wire counter electrode, and the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The MAPbI3 sensitized TiO2 film (coded as MAPbI3/TiO2), dye Z907 sensitized TiO2 film (coded as Z907/TiO2), MAPbI3 sensitized NiO film (coded as MAPbI3/NiO), and dye P1 sensitized NiO film (coded as P1/NiO) electrodes were placed at the bottom of the cell and short-circuited by a Pt wire to the electrolyte. LEDs were placed close to the cell from the back and focused on the film electrodes by an objective lens with the photo-illuminated spot area of 0.0785 cm2. A 25 μm diameter Pt wire (Good fellow, Cambridge, UK) was sealed into a 5 cm glass capillary prepared by a Vertical pull pin instrument (PC-10, Japan). The ultra-microelectrode (UME) was polished by a grinding instrument (EG-400, Japan) and micro-polishing cloth with 1.0, 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina powder. Then, the UME was sharpened conically to an RG of 10, where RG is the ratio between the diameters of the glass sheath and the Pt disk. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Results and discussion
In this study, SECM measurements with the feedback mode were performed on the MAPbI3-, Z907-, and P1-sensitized TiO2 and NiO films. Fig. 1 presents the SECM images of the top view of the NiO, TiO2, MAPbI3/NiO, and MAPbI3/TiO2 films, which show that the MAPbI3 layer is nicely deposited. The mean particle diameters are about 20 nm and 30 nm for the NiO and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively.

Fig. 2 illustrates the basic arrangement for the SECM investigation on the heterogeneous reactions for the MAPbI3/NiO film in an electrolyte containing only T− under illumination. Other substrates, including MAPbI3/TiO2, P1/NiO, and Z907/TiO2 are presented in Fig. S1.† Fig. S2† shows the information about the SECM setup and the UME. In this study, a 25 μm diameter Pt wire was sealed into a 5 cm glass capillary (Fig. S2a†) and the UME was further finely polished (Fig. S2b†). Fig. S2c and S2d† compare the cyclic voltammograms of a conventional Pt electrode (d = 3 mm) and a Pt UME (d = 25 μm) in a 0.5 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 electrolyte with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, showing that not only the magnitude of the current of the latter is much less due to the smaller electrode area, but also that the current goes to a steady-state value and is not peak-shaped. Fig. S3† presents the cyclic voltammogram of a Pt UME in 1 mM T− electrolyte. The radius rT of a UME can be calculated using the formula: i∞ = 4nFDCrT, where i∞ is the limited current on the UME, and D is the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple.

The current approach curves were collected with a CHI 920C scanning electrochemical microscopy workstation with bipotentionstat and data acquisition. The LED light source was set close to the substrate. 
The conversion of light to electricity depends on the electronic structure of solar cells with active materials (i.e., MAPbI3, Z907, and P1 in this study) that can absorb photons. The photons raise the energy levels of the electrons in the semiconductor, exciting some to jump from the lower energy valence band to the higher energy conduction band. The electrons in the conduction band and the holes left behind in the valence band are both mobile and can be induced to move by a voltage. It is noted that the electronic flux is different for the NiO and TiO2 substrates, i.e., holes transfer from the MAPbI3 to NiO and electrons transfer from the MAPbI3 to TiO2. After charge injection from the MAPbI3 to the oxides, there is a coupled reaction between the light harvester and the redox species, which is produced on the UME. The electron motion and the movement of holes in the opposite direction constitutes an electric current. For example, in the case of the MAPbI3/NiO film, the photo-excitation generates electron–hole pairs in the perovskite film. Because the binding energy for the exciton is low (about 2–20 meV), the bonded electron/hole pair can be effectively dissociated at room temperature. This leads to hole injection into the valance band (VB) of NiO and electron transfer to the electrolyte solution as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2. Previous studies on dye-sensitized NiO electrodes under illumination have revealed clear photo-electrochemical reactions at the NiO electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, we suggest that the corresponding reactions for T− and electrons on the UME (eqn (1a)) as well as those for T2 and the absorber S− on the nanocrystalline oxide substrate (eqn (1b)) can be expressed with the following equation. On the UME: 2T− − 2e− → T2(1a) On the substrate: 2S− + T2 → 2S + 2T−(1b)
In order to verify the influence of light intensity on the regeneration kinetics, the SECM measurements were first performed with a fixed mediator concentration, but varying irradiation intensities. Fig. 3 presents the normalized approach curves of UME towards the (a) MAPbI3/NiO and (b) MAPbI3/TiO2 substrates under blue illumination (curves 1–6). The other approach curves for the P1/NiO and Z907/TiO2 films are presented in Fig. S4 and S5.† The normalized tip current IT (IT = iT/iT,∞) is related to the tip current iT and the steady-state current iT,∞ (iT,∞ = gnFDCrT), in which n is the number of transferred electrons per molecule, F being the Faraday constant, D being the ionic diffusion coefficient, C being the concentration of the redox couple, and g being the geometry-dependent factor at semi-infinite height. Compared to the IinsT (solid line at the bottom, the current recorded with an inert insulating surface), the normalized tip current IconT (the scatter symbols, the current recorded with an illuminated MAPbI3-sensitized film) shows much higher values. The increase of current on the UME can be attributed to the high diffusion flux of T− at the UME according to eqn (1a). The shape of the approach curve is indicative of the electro-activity of the substrates.

The normalized rate constants κ for the first order kinetics of mediator cycling and the corresponding effective rate constant keff are listed in Table 1. (b) The MAPbI3/TiO2 film in the electrolyte with [T2] = 1 mM. The normalized rate constants κ for the first order kinetics of mediator cycling and the corresponding effective rate constant keff are listed in Table 2. 
The normalized heterogeneous rate constants κ can be extracted by fitting the approaching curves to an analytical approximation (see ESI†). The details are given in eqn (S1),† where eqn (S1b)† represents the diffusion current from the electrolyte to the UME, and eqn (S1c)† describes the current that results from the regeneration reaction on the sensitized semiconductor oxide film, and α(RG) and β(RG) are the constants, respectively. Based on the κ values, the effective heterogeneous rate constant keff (in cm s−1) can be evaluated with the equation of keff = κD/rT. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the obtained κ and keff for the MAPbI3/NiO and MAPbI3/TiO2 films in combination with the organic electrolyte T−/T2 under blue and red LED illumination. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between (a) keff and Jhv for the MAPbI3/NiO and P1/NiO films in the presence of 1 mM T− electrolyte, and (b) between keff and Jhv for the MAPbI3/TiO2 and Z907/TiO2 films in 1 mM T2 electrolyte under illumination with blue LED (wavelength centred at 474 nm).

 Fig. 4  Plots of experimental values of keffvs. Jhv: the lines represent the fitting of keff according to eqn (2) in the text with kred and ϕhv as adjustable parameters for the (a) CH3NH3PbI3/NiO (Δ) and P1/NiO (○) films, and according to eqn (3) in the text with kox and ϕhv as adjustable parameters for the (b) CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 (Δ) and Z907/TiO2 (○) films under illumination with blue LED. 
The relationship between keff and Jhv for these substrates under red LED illumination (wavelength centred at 647 nm) is illustrated in Fig. 5. It is noted that the first-order rate constant keff increases with the photon flux density. As the photon flux density (Jhv) of the blue illumination changes from 2.2 × 10−9 to 22.4 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1, the effective constant keff increases from 3.02 × 10−3 to 8.96 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the MAPbI3/NiO film and from 4.21 × 10−3 to 6.91 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the MAPbI3/TiO2 film (see Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, at a given Jhv the value of keff for the MAPbI3/NiO film is slightly higher than that of the MAPbI3/TiO2 film. The variation of keff with different photon flux intensities confirms the impact of light intensities on the regeneration kinetics. As the photon flux density Jhv of the red illumination changes from 4.19 × 10−9 to 14.6 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1, the value of keff increases from 7.91 × 10−3 to 14.33 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the MAPbI3/NiO film and from 5.99 × 10−3 to 10.66 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the MAPbI3/TiO2 film (see Tables 1 and 2). It is noticed that at an identical photon flux density, the keff obtained with red LED illumination for the MAPbI3 films is about two times higher than that of blue illumination. More importantly, under red LED illumination, the keff for the MAPbI3/NiO film is about two times higher than that of the P1/NiO film. When the photon density with red LED increases from 4.19 × 10−9 to 14.68 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1, the value of keff for the P1/NiO film increases from 4.44 × 10−3 to 8.01 × 10−3 cm s−1 and from 7.9 × 10−3 to 14.5 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the MAPbI3/NiO films in the T− electrolyte (see Fig. 5). These experimental results agree well with the photon absorbance of both of the sensitized oxide films. The MAPbI3/NiO film exhibits the maximum photon absorption in the range of 560 nm to 800 nm in the visible region; however, the P1/NiO film only presents maximum photon absorption at around 490 nm. Thus, the apparent heterogeneous rate constants kred for the regeneration of the reduced dye by the oxidized state of the redox shuttle after the injection of holes into the valance band of the semiconductor at a given incident light intensity can be obtained from eqn (2), where L is the film thickness, [T−] is the concentration of the reduced state of redox couple, D is the concentration of the sensitizer on the film, Jhv is the incident photon flux, and ϕhv is the excitation cross-section.38–40 (2)
 Fig. 5  Plot of experimental values of keffvs. Jhv: the lines represent the fitting of keff according to eqn (2) in the text with kred and ϕhv as adjustable parameters for the (a) CH3NH3PbI3/NiO (Δ) and P1/NiO (○) films, and according to eqn (3) in the text with kox and ϕhv as adjustable parameters for the (b) CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 (Δ) and Z907/TiO2 (○) films under red LED illumination. 
Therefore, the kinetic constant kred and excitation cross section ϕhv for the MAPbI3/NiO film were evaluated to be kred = 6.65 × 105 mol−1 cm3 s−1, ϕhv = 7.96 × 105 mol−1 cm2 in blue LED illumination, and ϕhv = 1.91 × 106 mol−1 cm2 in red LED illumination (Table 3).34,35 The parameters for the P1/NiO film were evaluated to be kred = 3.46 × 105 mol−1 cm3 s−1, ϕhv = 1.06 × 105 mol−1 cm2 in blue LED illumination, and ϕhv = 9.91 × 105 mol−1 cm2 in red LED illumination. The apparent heterogeneous rate constants kred of the MAPbI3/NiO film was more than two times higher than that of the P1/NiO in blue LED illumination. The excitation cross section of the MAPbI3/NiO film was about nine times bigger than P1/NiO. In red illumination, the excitation cross section of the MAPbI3/NiO film was more than ten times higher than that of P1/NiO (Table 3).

For the MAPbI3/TiO2 and Z907/TiO2 films, the oxidization rate constant kox can be obtained for the regeneration reaction between the sensitizers and T2 electrolyte by fitting the experimental keff values as a function of Jhv according to eqn (3).34–36 (3)
The results are listed in Table 3. For the MAPbI3/TiO2 film, the effective rate constant kox and the excitation cross section ϕhv were estimated to be 8.38 × 105 mol−1 cm3 s−1 and 7.71 × 105 mol−1 cm2 under blue LED illumination. The kox remains constant while the ϕhv increases to 8.49 × 106 mol−1 cm2 when red LED is used. The MAPbI3/NiO film shows similar values of kox and ϕhv to those of the MAPbI3/TiO2 film when blue LED light is used. However, it is noted that the kox and ϕhv for the MAPbI3/NiO film are lower than those of the MAPbI3/TiO2 film with red LED light. This result indicates that the regeneration process for MAPbI3 is not determined by the energy of each photon, and it is inversely related to the wavelength of the radiation. It is worthy to point out that the excitation cross section of MAPbI3 is approximately ten times higher than that of organic dyes, including P1 and Z907. This result confirms that the absorption coefficient of MAPbI3 in the visible region is much higher than conventional dyes.41,42 The knowledge of the MAPbI3 excitation cross section is necessary for many scientific studies and is very useful for MAPbI3 applications such as solar cells.

Fig. 6 shows the relevant energy levels for FTO, NiO, TiO2, MAPbI3, P1, Z907, and redox electrolyte T−/T2, which may affect the regeneration kinetics rate. Upon light absorption, exactions are generated in the sensitizers (i.e., MAPbI3, Z907, and P1 in this study) followed by hole transfer to NiO (in the case of P1/NiO and MAPbI3/NiO), or electron transfer to TiO2 (in the case of Z907/TiO2 and MAPbI3/TiO2). The free energy (ΔG) for regeneration can be calculated (eqn (4a)) for p-type (NiO) and (eqn (4b)) for n-type TiO2.25–27,41 ΔGreg = e[E(S/S+) − E(T2/T−)](4a) ΔGreg = e[E(T2/T−) − E(S/S−)](4b)where E(T2/T−) is the reduction or oxidation potential of the redox mediator, E(S/S−) is the LUMO or conduction of the sensitizer when an n-type semiconductor is used and the HOMO or valance band of the sensitizer when a p-type semiconductor is used.

The reduction potential/oxidation potential of the redox mediator E (T2/T− = −5.51 eV) must be different from that of the sensitizer E (S/S−) to provide a significant driving force for the regeneration reaction. For example, E(T2/T−) is more negative than the valence band potential of MAPbI3 (in the case of NiO), and more positive than the conduction band potential of MAPbI3 (in the case of TiO2). The free energy (ΔG) was evaluated to be −0.21 eV for MAPbI3/TiO2, 0.50 eV for Z907/TiO2, 1.76 eV for MAPbI3/NiO, and 1.58 eV for P1/NiO, respectively. Clearly, though the corresponding driving force for the regeneration of MAPbI3 is smaller than the P1 or Z907 dye when NiO or TiO2 is used, the interfacial charge transfer reaction is very efficient for this material. The enhanced reaction process might be attributed to the suitable surface properties of the well-crystallized MAPbI3 material.
Conclusions
SECM has been shown to be a successful approach for the investigation of the regeneration kinetics of organo metallic perovskite sensitizers by organic redox electrolytes. Approach curves showed that kinetics of regeneration depends on the wavelength of incident light, photon flux density, and optical properties of sensitizers. The effective regeneration rate constant and absorption cross section of MAPbI3 sensitized oxides are significantly higher than conventional sensitizers. The SECM with a feedback model is a new method for the characterization of regeneration kinetics processes in new generation photovoltaics. This allows the straight forward testing of high efficient sensitizers to harvest light in a broad absorption spectral range.
