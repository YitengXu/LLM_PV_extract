    , Accepted 9th August 2017First published on 9th August 2017AbstractWe present here a carbon quantum dot (CQD) tailored counter electrode (CE) for a bifacial dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Arising from wide spectral absorption, high optical transmission and the electron-enriched surface of the CE, the final bifacial DSSC device yields front and rear efficiencies of 9.08% and 7.01%, respectively.
Photovoltaic conversion is a promising electricity generation technique with zero emissions.1–3 Among several solar cell alternatives, bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) harvesting solar energy from both sides4,5 have attracted tremendous scientific interest because of maximal solar utilization and therefore maximal photoelectric power output without increasing the fabrication cost. Upon shining with sunlight, the organic dyes will absorb the photons penetrating the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate or counter electrode (CE) and electrolyte. In this fashion, the optical transmission of the CE is a prerequisite to yield high rear solar cell efficiency, however, the transparency of the preferred Pt electrode is generally lower than 40%, yielding an efficiency as low as 3–4% in final solar cell devices.6 A common strategy is to develop semi-transparent CEs from conducting polymers7 or carbonaceous materials.8–10 A remaining problem is the poor electron-collecting ability and durability of the conducting polymer electrodes as well as the low catalytic performances of carbonaceous species. To address these issues, our group has previously built a category of transparent metal selenide alloy CE to harvest more visible light for electricity conversion. For example, Ru–Se alloy CEs with a tunable Ru/Se ratio were made by a facile solution method,11 showing an optical transparency as high as 80% and extraordinary catalytic behaviour. The optimized bifacial DSSC yields a front efficiency of 8.76% and a rear efficiency of 5.90%, which is the highest recorded in the bifacial DSSC field. Although many attempts have been carried out, the maximal rear efficiency is still lower than 6% because of the maximized electron distribution density at the CE surface.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs)12,13 are graphene materials with a lateral size ≤20 nm, size-dependent absorption, tunable fluorescence properties, and multiple exciton generation effect. Moreover, CQDs suffer from surface passivation14 or doped elements,15 exhibiting broad spectral wavelengths, up-conversion properties and suitable bands. These excellent performances allow CQDs to become good light absorbers by sole or co-sensitization in widening solar spectral absorption and extracting charges.16,17 Using the photoexcitation behaviour of CQDs, it is desirable to study interfacial engineering of transparent CEs by setting robust CQDs at the CE/electrolyte interface, acting as light absorption and electron donors to facilitate the reduction of the oxidation state electrolyte (I3−) under illumination. In this work, polyethylene glycol modified CQDs with down- and up-conversion capacities under excitation of both ultraviolet and near infrared light are used to tailor the transparent CoSe (CQDs-CoSe) electrode, generating a substantial increase for both front and rear efficiencies in the DSSC device.

Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of the DSSC, comprising a transparent CQD-CoSe CE, an I−/I3− redox electrolyte and a mesoscopic dye–TiO2 photoanode. The operation principle and charge-transfer process are shown in Fig. 1b. Upon irradiation from the front side, the photons penetrating the FTO glass are absorbed by organic N719 dye molecules in order to release electrons to TiO2. After reducing the excited dyes to their ground state, the I− ions in the electrolyte convert into I3− ions and diffuse to the CE/electrolyte interface. The catalytic CE collects electrons from an external circuit and reduces I3− back to I−. When suffering rear-side irradiation, the sunlight penetrates the transparent CE and liquid electrolyte layer to excite the dyes according to the same principle. In this process, the CQDs are excited by the solar spectra of 350–490 nm and 725–925 nm light (confirmed by PL spectra, Fig. S1d and e, ESI†), producing photon-generated electrons, which can be excited to donate electrons to CoSe. The electron-enriched CoSe surface is beneficial to enhanced catalytic performances. The corresponding characterizations of the CQDs are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 2a) shows a loose structure for the CoSe electrode, which provides a large interface and channels for CQD deposition. Subsequently, this CoSe electrode undergoes cyclic voltammetry in CQD aqueous solution for 10 cycles (see ESI† for concrete experimental details). As shown in Fig. 2b, there are no PL peaks for the CQD-free CoSe electrode, while an emission peak centered at 445 nm is detected under 370 nm excitation, which is similar to the PL peak of CQDs (Fig. S1d, ESI†). This phenomenon demonstrates that the CQDs have been successfully deposited on the CoSe electrode.

The function of a CE is to collect electrons and to catalyze the I3− + 2e− → 3I− reduction reaction, therefore the electron density at the CE surface depends on the reaction kinetics of the total catalytic process. As has been mentioned above, the photoexcitation behaviour makes CQDs produce photogenerated electrons under illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel plots, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) characterizations are performed to evaluate catalytic activity towards the liquid electrolyte, having I−/I3− redox couples. Fig. 3a and b show the CV curves of CQD-free and CQDs-CoSe CEs, respectively, for I−/I3− redox couples recorded at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 in the light and under darkness. All of the curves have two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks from −0.6 to 1.2 V. The pair on the left (noted as Ox1 and Red1) is the redox reaction of I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−, and the right pair (noted as Ox2 and Red2) is the redox reaction of 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−.18 The peak current density of Red1 (JRed1) and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red1 and Ox1 can be employed to evaluate the catalytic performance,19 and corresponding values are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). JRed1 and Epp are the parameters for evaluating the catalytic kinetics and reflecting overpotential loss of the CEs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, the two CV curves are almost completely identical under light and dark conditions for the CoSe-only CE, suggesting that the catalytic activity is unchanged with or without illumination. Upon illumination, there are increased JRed1 and reduced Epp values for the CQDs-CoSe CE (Fig. 3b). These results demonstrate that the combination of fluorescent CQDs with CoSe can maximize the catalytic activity of a CE. Additionally, the CV curve of the CQDs-CoSe electrode in the light shows maximal JRed1 and minimal Epp values, indicating that the CQDs-CoSe CE presents superior catalytic activity under illumination and is expected to elevate the rear efficiency of a bifacial DSSC device.

(c) Nyquist EIS plots and (d) Tafel polarization curves of CoSe and CQDs-CoSe CEs under light and dark environments through the symmetric dummy cells from two identical CEs. 
Nyquist EIS plots and Tafel polarization curves were carried out on a symmetric dummy cell fabricated with two identical CEs, to cross-check the enhancement of catalytic activities under illumination.20–23Rct presents the intrinsic inter-facial charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. As shown in Fig. 3c, the Rct value for the CoSe-only CE remains unchanged with or without light illumination, however the Rct value (Rct = 9.543 Ω cm2) of the CQDs-CoSe electrode under light irradiation is much smaller than that in the dark, meaning that the CQDs-CoSe CE displays an enhanced charge-transfer ability under light. Moreover, a larger slope of anodic or cathodic branches in the Tafel polarization curves represents a larger exchange current density (J0). J0 is inversely proportional to Rct:24J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance. Furthermore, limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) is a parameter that is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the I−/I3− redox couple at the CE/electrolyte interface.25Dn is directly proportional to Jred1, described by the Randles–Sevcik theory,26 where Jred1 represents the peak current density of Red1. Therefore, our results show that the CV, Nyquist EIS and Tafel measurements are in good agreement, indicating the better catalytic activity of the CQDs-CoSe CE under illumination.
The high optical transmission is crucial to yield increased rear efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4a, both CQDs-CoSe and CoSe-only CEs have excellent optical transparencies (>60%) at 400–1000 nm, and the incorporation of CQDs does not reduce transmission. Fig. 4b shows J–V curves of solar cell devices under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) or in the dark, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. A front efficiency of 8.06% and a rear efficiency of 5.18% are determined for the CoSe tailored solar cell, which are both at a high level for bifacial DSSCs. By using the CQDs-CoSe CE, the front and rear efficiencies are increased to 9.08% and 7.01%, respectively. The front efficiency enhancement may be attributed to the re-absorption of unabsorbed visible light across the photoanode and electrolyte by the CQDs, maximizing electron concentration at the CoSe electrode. Notably, the rear efficiency of the optimized bifacial DSSC is increased by about 35%, arising from the superior catalytic activity of the CQDs-CoSe CE. Moreover, the Jsc values are enhanced using the CQDs-CoSe CE in the DSSC, arising from the accelerated conversion process of I3− to I− species for dye regeneration, and therefore electron excitation at the photoanode. In addition, the forward recombination reactions between photogenerated electrons and electrolytes have been the major limitation for Voc ouput. Using the CQDs-CoSe CE for solar cell application, the high potential drop at the photoanode promotes electrons to transfer along percolating TiO2 pathways, therefore increasing the Voc values. All of the rear Voc values are lower than the front Voc values, because of increased recombination processes.11 To be applied in practice, solar cells should have the performance of multiple on–off behaviors.27 To realize these objectives, we have recorded the on–off switching by alternatively irradiating and darkening the DSSCs from the front or rear side (Fig. 4c). There is an abrupt increase in photocurrent upon irradiation from either the front or rear side, indicating that the solar cell has no delay when starting under illumination.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the integration of CQDs with transparent CoSe is an effective strategy to maximize the catalytic activity of a CE and rear efficiency of a corresponding bifacial DSSC. The photogenerated electrons from CQDs under illumination help the CoSe catalyst increase electron density and therefore promote the reduction reaction of I3− to I−. The rear efficiency is increased to 7.01%, which is now the highest recorded efficiency for bifacial DSSCs.
