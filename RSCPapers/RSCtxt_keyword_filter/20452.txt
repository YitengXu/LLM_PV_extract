    , Accepted 7th November 2017First published on 7th November 2017AbstractA hysteresis-free and high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cell was developed using a solution-processed SnO2 electron-transporting layer (ETL). Tin(IV) isopropoxide dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) was spin-coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate in a nitrogen atmosphere. The effects of annealing temperature and precursor concentration on the photovoltaic performance were systematically investigated. The annealing temperature was scanned from 100 °C to 500 °C, whereby the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 film demonstrated the best performance along with negligible current–voltage hysteresis. The SnO2 film annealed at 250 °C was X-ray amorphous, while it was observed to be nanocrystallite from SnO2 annealed at 500 °C. The faster stabilization of the photocurrent and lower interfacial capacitance for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 than for the 500 °C-annealed one were responsible for the markedly reduced hysteresis. The photovoltaic performance and hysteresis were influenced by the precursor concentration, where a concentration of 0.1 M showed hysteresis-free higher performance among the concentrations investigated ranging from 0.05 M to 0.2 M owing to a larger and faster photoluminescence quenching. The planar (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite that was formed on the 40 nm-thick, 0.1 M-based and 250 °C-annealed SnO2 thin film delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.17% averaged out from the forward scan PCE of 19.40% and the reverse scan PCE of 18.93%.
Introduction
An all-solid-state perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and 500 h stability was reported in 2012,1 following two pioneering studies on perovskite-sensitized liquid junction solar cells in 2009 (ref. 2) and 2011 (ref. 3) and triggered perovskite photovoltaics. Swift progress in perovskite photovoltaics led to later the achievement of a certified PCE of 22.1%.4–6 Perovskite solar cells can be constructed either with a normal structure (TCO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/metal) or inverted structure (TCO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/metal), where TCO, ETL, and HTL stand for the transparent conductive oxide, electron-transporting layer, and hole-transporting layer, respectively. The normal structure can be divided into mesoscopic and planar types depending on the mesoporous ETL. Although perovskite solar cells work in the absence of an ETL7,8 or HTL,9–12 their photovoltaic performances were reported to be inferior to those of the devices employing both an ETL and HTL. This indicates that the role of ETL and HTL is not negligible in terms of the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell.13 Among the studied ETLs, TiO2 has been widely used and indeed, a mesoscopic structure employing a mesoporous TiO2 layer has demonstrated the highest PCE by far. However, severe current–voltage hysteresis is a key drawback for TiO2-based perovskite solar cells. For instance, in the normal mesoscopic structure with TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD as the ETL and HTL respectively, charge accumulation at the interfaces between selective contacts and the perovskite was reported to result in a considerable mismatch of the forward scan and reverse scan current–voltage (I–V) curves, i.e., hysteresis, and it was also reported that the TiO2/perovskite interface plays a more critical role in originating the hysteresis.14–22 In order to solve the problematic hysteresis, fullerene and its derivatives were introduced at the interface and a significant reduction in hysteresis was observed due to the improvement in electron transfer.23,24 The triblock fullerene derivative coded as PCBB–2CN–2C8 was found to improve the photovoltaic performance and reduce hysteresis because of the removal of trap states in the TiO2 surface.25 The C60 pyrrolidine derivative coded as CPTA was introduced to an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate, and was found to suppress hysteresis in a flexible PSC with an n–i–p structure.26 Metal oxides and chalcogenides, such as ZnO, In2O3, SnO2, ZnS, and CdS, were proposed as alternatives to TiO2,27–31 where SnO2 is regarded as one of most promising candidates because of having a two orders of magnitude higher electron mobility and wider bandgap than TiO2. SnO2 has been also used as a photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells, but the SnO2-based solar cell performance was found to be inferior to the TiO2-based one mainly because of the much lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) associated with the conduction band position.32–37 For the case of dye-sensitized solar cells, the conduction band position of the nanocrystalline oxide layer is critical because Voc is influenced by the Fermi level of oxides in the open-circuit condition. In this regard, SnO2 was not used for perovskite solar cells in the early days. Since the report that the working principle of perovskite solar cells might be different from sensitized solar cells,38 SnO2 has been positively considered as an ETL for perovskite solar cells. SnO2 was applied to a perovskite solar cell in 2015,39 in which, however, the thin SnO2 layer was used as a blocking layer because a mesoporous TiO2 layer was overcoated on the SnO2 layer. The thin SnO2 layer was directly used as an ETL in a normal planar structured perovskite solar cell,40 which demonstrated an average PCE of 16.02% along with a Voc of 1.11 V. A reduced but noticeable hysteresis was also demonstrated. Various deposition methods have been applied to make thin SnO2 layers suitable for an ETL, including solution processes,41–54 atomic layer deposition (ALD),55–57 and chemical bath deposition (CBD).58,59 A commercially available aqueous SnO2 colloidal solution showed a certified PCE of 19.9%.50 A PCE of over 20% and a Voc higher than 1.2 V were recently reported from a CBD SnO2-based planar perovskite solar cell,59 which indicated that Voc is mainly governed by the Fermi level of the perovskite rather than that of an oxide ETL. For better charge collection, metal ion doping into SnO2 was attempted and was reported to show better performance than undoped SnO2.60–64 SnO2 has been proven to be one of the most promising ETL materials, not as the alternative to TiO2, for perovskite solar cells. Nevertheless, according to the reported data, the photovoltaic performance and hysteric behavior are strongly dependent on the preparation method and conditions, which motivated us to study more in detail the effects of the precursor chemicals, solution concentration, and annealing temperature on the photovoltaic performance and hysteresis.
We report here a hysteresis-free high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells based on a SnO2 ETL prepared by tin(IV) isopropoxide (Sn(OCH(CH3)2)4). Tin isopropoxide is known to be a good starting material for sol–gel-derived SnO2.65–68 The effects of the precursor concentration and annealing temperature were investigated in order to find the hysteresis-free condition and best performance as well. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), impedance spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured to explain the basis for the removal of hysteresis and the changes in the photovoltaic parameters depending on the preparation condition. From the detailed investigations carried out in this work, we propose the optimal condition for a hysteresis-free perovskite solar cell with an average PCE of 19.2%, where the amorphous SnO2 obtained at 250 °C was found to be better than the crystalline SnO2 annealed at 500 °C in terms of its energy band alignment and electrical property.
Experimental
Material synthesis
Formamidinium iodide HC(NH2)2I (FAI) was synthesized by reacting 30 mL hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) with 15 g of formamidinium acetate (99%, Aldrich) at 0 °C. After stirring for 2 h, a dark yellow precipitate was recovered by evaporating the solvent at 60 °C using a rotary evaporator. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and then recrystallized from ethanol. The white precipitate was dried under vacuum for 24 h and stored in a glove box filled with Ar. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated in ambient conditions, in which the relative humidity was not controlled. FTO glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, and acetone, followed by sonicating with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. Ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) was treated for 15 min prior to use. The precursor solutions for the SnO2 ETL were prepared by dissolving tin(IV) isopropoxide (Alfa Aesar, 10% w/v in isopropanol (IPA), 99%) in IPA, where the solution concentration was varied from 0.05 M to 0.20 M. The precursor solution was spin-coated on FTO glass in a glove box filled with N2 at a spinning rate of 5000 rpm for 20 s, which was dried at 65 °C on a hotplate for 1 min. The pre-dried SnO2 films were heated further in the furnace at ambient conditions at different temperatures of 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C, 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C for 30 min. To improve the adhesion of SnO2 layers on FTO, bare FTO glasses were treated with UV ozone for 20 min before and after coating the SnO2 precursor solution. After cooling to room temperature, the substrate coated with SnO2 film was exposed to UVO for 20 min prior to coating the perovskite film. For the perovskite composition, we considered efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to SnO2. Better charge extraction was proposed for the mixed cation perovskite rather than pure CH3NH3PbI3.55 We designed a composition of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 that was prepared for a SnO2-based planar perovskite solar cell. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.1504 g of FAI, 0.4034 g of PbI2, 0.0459 g of PbBr2, and 0.0266 mg of CsBr in DMF based on the ratio of (PbI2 + PbBr):DMSO:(FAI + CsBr) = 1:1:1. The solution concentration was 54 wt%. The completely dissolved solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 film at 4000 rpm for 20 s, in which 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped on the rotating substrate to induce an intermediate for preparation of the adduct.69 The perovskite films were formed after heating at 145 °C for 40 min. Spiro-MeOTAD was used as the HTL and formed on top of the perovskite layer. The 20 μL of spiro-MeOTAD solution, which consisted of 50.6 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 20.16 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and 12.25 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg LiTSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 0.7 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the Au electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a constant evaporation rate of 0.05 nm s−1.
Characterizations
The current density–voltage (J–V) and current density–time (J–t) curves were measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol, 3A class) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. One sun light intensity was adjusted using the NREL-calibrated Si solar cell having a KG-5 filter. The device was covered with a metal aperture with an active area of 0.125 cm2 during the measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.), in which a monochromatic beam was generated from a 75 W xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan). EQE data were collected in the DC mode without light bias. Absorption and transmittance spectra of the SnO2 films were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Agilent 8453). Plane-view and cross-sectional morphologies were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM7000F, JEOL). The thicknesses of SnO2 films were measured by SEM. X-ray diffraction (HD-powder XRD-D8 Advance, Bruker) was used to study the crystal structure of the SnO2 films, in which Cu Kα radiation was used (λ = 1.5406 Å) and the scan rate was 5° min−1. The binding energy and oxidation state were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo UK) with monochromatic Al Kα generating a 1486.7 eV X-ray source. The electron take-off angle was fixed at 0° and the vacuum pressure was below 1 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energy scale was calibrated using the hydrocarbon contamination on the surface based on the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The work function was investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo UK) using the He I (21.22 eV) emission line. Time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) were measured by a Quantaurus-Tau compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, Hamamatsu). The film samples were excited with a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, model M12488-33, peak power of 231 mW and pulse duration of 53 ps, Hamamatsu) pulsed at a repetition frequency of 10 MHz for time-integrated and 2 MHz for time-resolved PL. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were carried out using a PGSTAT 128N device (Autolab, Eco-Chemie) with a small perturbation AC 20 mV sinusoidal signal on the DC voltage from 0 V to 0.8 V and frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The measured Nyquist plots were fitted using Z-View software using an equivalent circuit composed of series resistance (Rs) and two R–C components (resistance and capacitance in parallel) in series. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) was used to study the surface conductivity of the deposited SnO2 films. A commercial atomic force microscopy system (SPA-400, SII, Japan) was employed using Pt/Ir-coated Si tips (CONTPt, Nanoworld, Switzerland) with a typical resonant frequency of 13 kHz and a spring constant of 0.2 N m−1. All the images were acquired with a contact force of −1.5 nN, and bias voltages of 0.1–0.5 V at a scan rate of 1.0 Hz. Negative biases were applied to the substrate, while the tip was grounded. The current and topographic images were obtained under ambient conditions, simultaneously.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the schematic procedure for fabricating perovskite solar cells with SnO2-based planar structures, where the SnO2 ETL layers were prepared using tin(IV) isopropoxide. To find the optimal preparation condition, the concentration of the precursor solution and annealing temperature of the deposited SnO2 film were varied. The thickness of the SnO2 film was expected to be changed by the concentration and crystallinity, while the electrical property was anticipated to be changed by the annealing temperature. We found that the precursor solution deposition step was critical and sensitive to the environment. Spin-coating of the SnO2 precursor solution under ambient atmosphere was found to lead to non-reproducible results due to the hygroscopic nature of tin(IV) isopropoxide. Thus, the initial spin-coating should be carried out in a N2-filled glove box. After drying the as-deposited SnOx films at 65 °C for 1 min in the glove box, further annealing at higher temperature was performed at ambient atmosphere. We first investigated the effect of the annealing temperature ranging from 100 °C to 500 °C at the given concentration of 0.1 M and then the effect of concentration (0.05 M–0.2 M at 0.05 M increment) on the photovoltaic performance was investigated at the given optimal annealing temperature. All the other processes were conducted after ambient atmosphere after first annealing the 65 °C-heated SnOx films at higher temperature.

Fig. 2 displays the J–V curves depending on the annealing temperature. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The PCE obtained from the reverse scan increases with increasing the temperature from 100 °C to 250 °C, while the PCE drops again at temperatures higher than 250 °C. It is noted that there was almost no mismatch between the reverse and forward scan J–V curves, so-called hysteresis, for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 compared to a large hysteresis being observed for all the other temperatures. The first attempt of forming a 250 °C-annealed SnO2 thin layer from tin(IV) isopropoxide led to an average PCE of 16.08% from the reverse scan PCE of 16.80% (Jsc of 21.26 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 V, and FF of 0.74) and the forward scan PCE of 15.34% (Jsc of 21.32 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.04 V, and FF of 0.69).

Fig. 3 shows the statistical data for the reverse and forward scan photovoltaic parameters. Little difference in Jsc between the reverse and forward scans was observed regardless of the annealing temperature. However, Voc is affected by the scan direction, where the difference in Voc between the reverse and forward scans is relatively larger for temperatures higher than 300 °C than for the temperatures lower than 200 °C. The gap between the reverse and forward scan FFs decreases as the temperature increases from 150 °C to 250 °C, minimized at 250 °C, and then increases again as the temperature increases from 300 °C to 500 °C. As a result, except for 250 °C, a large mismatch in PCE between the reverse and forward scans was observed for all other temperatures. When considering the same perovskite film and hole-transporting material used for all devices, the annealing temperature-dependent hysteric behavior seems to correlate with the morphological and/or electronic properties of SnO2.

It is known that the selective contacts play an important role in the hysteresis, while TiO2 in a normal mesoscopic layout modulates significantly the capacitive current due to the reaction with iodide ions.70 The capacitive current induced by the interfacial capacitance is thus expected to be minimized at 250 °C, while relatively large capacitive currents are anticipated for annealing temperatures lower and higher than 250 °C. It has been reported for the perovskite solar cell that the low-frequency capacitance depends on the selective contacts under illumination, suggesting that the electrode polarization occurs due to accumulating electronic and ionic charges at the interface.71–73 The interface charge accumulation was suggested to be responsible for the hysteresis.74,75 In Fig. 4a, the Nyquist plots with two semicircles are shown along with the equivalent circuit. The semicircle at high frequency was attributed to the transport resistance at selective contacts, whereas the semicircle at low frequency or intermediate frequency was related to the recombination process of the perovskite solar cell. The capacitance at low frequency, corresponding to electrode polarization, was lower for 250 °C than for 500 °C (Fig. 4b), which was associated with the reduced hysteresis. To compare the carrier behavior of the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 and 500 °C-annealed SnO2, the transport resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec) were estimated from the Nyquist plots obtained under illumination and bias voltage ranging from 0.1 V to 0.8 V (see Fig. 4c and d). The annealing temperature seemed to have an influence on both Rtr and Rrec. In Fig. 4c, Rtr is higher for the 250 °C than for the 500 °C sample, which indicated that carrier transport in the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 was not easier than that in the 500 °C-annealed one. However, as compared to the almost constant Rrec of up to ∼0.6 V for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 (Fig. 4d), the continuous decrease in Rrec for the 500 °C-annealed one indicated that the carriers tend to be readily recombined in the 500 °C SnO2. Therefore, the recombination loss was probably related to the inferior photovoltaic performance of the 500 °C-annealed SnO2.

(c) Transport resistance and (d) recombination resistance calculated from the Nyquist plot obtained from the bias voltage ranging from 0.1 V to 0.8 V under illumination. 
The morphology and crystal structure were investigated for the SnO2 samples annealed at 250 °C and 500 °C. The cross-sectional and plane-view SEM images confirmed that FTO was conformably covered by SnO2 FTO at 250 °C, while FTO was not fully covered at 500 °C (Fig. 5a–d). The incomplete coverage at the higher annealing temperature of 500 °C was attributed to volume shrinkage by the crystallization, as evidenced by the XRD patterns (Fig. 5e). SnO2 annealed at 250 °C shows an amorphous nature,76 while the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 was crystallized with nanocrystallites, as seen from the broad peak width. All the XRD peaks of the SnO2 film annealed at 500 °C were assigned as tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS Card no.: 41-1445). It is noted that our XRD pattern and peak width for the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 film were almost identical with those observed for the SnO2 film prepared from commercial SnO2 colloids (3–4 nm) and at an annealing temperature of 150 °C.50 However, despite the similar XRD features, the photovoltaic performance of the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 was lower than that of the colloidal SnO2,50 which was due to the incomplete coverage with the SnO2 layer annealed at 500 °C.

(e) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of SnO2 films annealed at 250 °C and 500 °C. The samples for XRD were prepared by the same procedure as for the SEM measurements, except for the glass substrate. 
Time-integrated photoluminescence (PL) analysis showed a decrease in the PL intensity in the presence of the SnO2 layer (Fig. 6a), which indicated that the photoexcited electrons are injected into SnO2. Little difference in the degree of PL quenching was observed between the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 and 500 °C-annealed SnO2, which was indicative of their little difference in charge separation ability. However, the average Jsc was slightly higher for the SnO2 annealed at 250 °C than for the 500 °C-annealed SnO2, as shown in Fig. 3a. When considering the Jsc results from not only a charge injection efficiency viewpoint but also in terms of charge collection efficiency, the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 layer was probably better in charge collection than the 500 °C-annealed one. The thin SnO2 layer can be regarded as a hole-blocking layer, in which a pinhole in the hole-blocking layer allows charge recombination, leading to a low Jsc.76 Thus, the uncovered FTO annealed at 500 °C was responsible for the relatively low Jsc as compared to the fully covered one with 250 °C-annealed SnO2. The charge separation kinetics were evaluated from the time-resolved PL (Fig. 6b) based on a biexponential decay equation.23 Herein, the similar decay time constants of the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 (1.08 ns) and the 500 °C-annealed one (1.10 ns) indicate that the charge separation kinetics do not seem to rely on the crystallinity of SnO2.

Deposition of the thin SnO2 film improves the transmittance regardless of the annealing temperature, as can be seen in Fig. 7a, where transmittance of the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 is almost identical with that of the 500 °C-annealed one. Thus, the difference in Jsc is not related to light absorbance but rather to charge collection due to differences in the surface coverage. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was higher for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 than for the 500 °C-annealed one (Fig. 7b). The integrated Jsc from the EQE data was 20.4 mA cm−2 and 19.7 mA cm−2 for the SnO2 films annealed at 250 °C and 500 °C, respectively, which agrees well with the Jsc values observed from the solar simulator. We also prepared a perovskite solar cell without a SnO2 layer. As expected, its EQE values were much lower than those for the devices with a SnO2 layer due to charge recombination, as mentioned previously. It was noted that spectral feature of the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 was similar to that of bare FTO case, particularly in the UV region of 300–400 nm, which was attributed to the uncovered FTO.

For evaluating the stabilized PCE, the steady-state PCE and photocurrent density were measured as a function of time, while holding the devices at the voltage at maximum power point (VMP).77Fig. 8a and b compare the steady-state PCE and photocurrent density for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 and 500 °C-annealed SnO2, where VMP values of 0.858 V (250 °C) and 0.809 V (500 °C) were held. A stabilized PCE of 16.88% and photocurrent density of 19.67 mA cm−2 were obtained for the SnO2 annealed at 250 °C (Fig. 8a), while a lower PCE of 10.84% and photocurrent density of 13.41 mA cm−2 were observed for the SnO2 annealed at 500 °C (Fig. 8b). As compared to the 500 °C-annealed SnO2, the time for stabilization was much faster for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2, which is indicative of a lower capacitive current and is well consistent with negligible hysteresis and lower capacitance, as observed in Fig. 2 and 4. We also compared the steady-state Jsc as a function of time, see Fig. 8c, because the stabilization kinetics from Jsc–t data was reported to correlate with the degree of hysteresis.19Jsc for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 was quickly stabilized within a few seconds, whereas Jsc did not seem to be stabilized even in 100 s for the 500 °C-annealed SnO2. The much faster stabilization of Jsc for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 was responsible for the significantly reduced hysteresis.

The effects of the annealing temperature on the oxidation state of SnO2 were investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Sn 3d core level spectra of the SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 9a and b. The Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 peaks appear at binding energies of 487.13 eV and 495.53 eV for the 250 °C-annealed SnO2. Similar binding energies of 486.93 eV and 495.43 eV were detected for the 500 °C-annealed SnO2. The binding energies correspond to Sn4+ in the SnO2 films.40,53,78,79 In Fig. 9c and d, the oxygen 1s peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks, where the lower binding energy peak is related to (Sn–O) bonds and the higher one originates from (O–H) bonds (or oxygen vacancies).40,78,79 The relatively more intense (O–H) binding peak in Fig. 9c is related to the amorphous characteristics of the 250 °C-annealed SnO2. From the XPS analysis, the deposited tin oxide was confirmed to be SnO2 for both the 250 °C and 500 °C annealing temperatures.
 Fig. 9  (a, b) The Sn 3d and (c, d) O 1s XPS spectra for the SnO2 films annealed at 250 °C and 500 °C. The samples for the XPS measurements were prepared on a silicon substrate. 
Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was performed to examine the topographical charge conductance of the SnO2 films annealed at different temperatures (Fig. 10). Measurements were carried out at bias voltages ranging from 0.1 V to 0.5 V in the dark and under an ambient atmosphere. In Fig. 10a–c, bare FTO shows a high conductance due to the electrical conducting property of FTO. The conductance seems to be proportional to the bias voltage. Contrary to bare FTO, the FTO deposited with the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 showed no current flow, regardless of changes in the bias voltage (Fig. 10d–f), which indicated that the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 was an insulator. On the other hand, the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 on FTO showed insulating behavior at a low bias voltage of 0.1 V, but the conductance increased as the bias voltage increased (Fig. 10g–i). Since the c-AFM image at 0.5 V for the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 (Fig. 10i) was different from that for the bare FTO (Fig. 10c), the current flow in Fig. 10i is related to the 500 °C-annealed SnO2. The unclear but nanocrystallite SnO2 grown at 500 °C may increase the defects compared to the SnO2 annealed at a relatively lower temperature,80 which traps charges and is responsible for the c-AFM conductance in Fig. 10i. Since the oxygen defect of SnO2 is expected to increase as the annealing temperature increases, oxygen defects formed at 500 °C might act as electron traps, as observed from the c-AFM. The trap states of the 500 °C-annealed SnO2 were also associated with recombination, as confirmed by the EIS results in Fig. 4. Thus, the pronounced hysteresis for the SnO2 annealed at 500 °C is attributed to the defects. In addition, the uncovered FTO in Fig. 10i will provide a pathway for current leakage, leading to a decrease in shunt resistance, which in part contributes to hysteresis.81

The valence band maximum (EVB), conduction band minimum (ECB) and bandgap (Eg) of SnO2 films, depending on the annealing temperature, were investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-VIS data (Fig. 11). The Fermi levels (EF) for the 250 °C and 500 °C cases were estimated to be 5.14 eV and 5.16 eV, respectively, from EF = Ecut-off (cut-off binding energy) − 21.2 eV (emission energy from He irradiation). Ecut-off was 16.06 eV for 250 °C and 16.04 eV for 500 °C (Fig. 11b). In Fig. 11c, EVB was determined to be 8.81 eV and 8.76 eV for 250 °C and 500 °C, respectively, which were calculated from EVB = EF − EF,edge (Fermi edge). Eg was obtained from the Tauc plot in Fig. 11d and e, which were 3.92 eV and 3.91 eV for the 250 °C and 500 °C samples, respectively. In Fig. 11f, the band alignment is schematically presented, where the ECB values determined from Eg and EVB were 4.90 eV and 4.85 eV for the 250 °C and 500 °C samples, respectively. The deeper ECB facilitates more effective electron transport.50,61 The UV-ozone-treated FTO changes ECB to ∼5.0 eV, which makes it suitable for charge extraction.82 The UPS results showed that the 250 °C-annealed SnO2 was better in terms of ohmic contact.

Based on detailed investigations on the effects of the annealing temperature, amorphous SnO2 prepared at 250 °C with 0.1 M tin(IV) isopropoxide solution was found to be the optimal condition. However, we need further study on the effects of the thickness of the 250 °C-annealed SnO2. For this purpose, we varied the concentration of the precursor solution because the thickness can be tuned by changing the concentration in the spin-coating process. Fig. 12a–e show the dependence of the photovoltaic performance and hysteresis on the precursor concentration. The reverse and forward scan photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Compared to the device without a SnO2 thin layer, the photovoltaic performance was better and hysteresis significantly reduced for the devices with SnO2 thin layers. The reverse scan PCE increased from 15.31% to 16.66% as the concentration was increased from 0.05 M to 0.1 M, whereas the PCE declined again for higher concentrations of 0.15 M (PCE = 15.20%) and 0.2 M (PCE = 15.71%). Since the thickness of the SnO2 film prepared from 0.1 M was ∼40 nm, as measured by SEM, SnO2 films thinner and thicker than 40 nm were expected for the concentrations lower and higher than 0.1 M, respectively. When considering the very low FF of 0.33 for the forward scan device without a SnO2 layer (Fig. 12a), the lowest FF of 0.6 for the 0.05 M among the studied concentrations in the forward scan data was related to poor coverage of FTO with SnO2 due to the very thin layer. On the other hand, the slightly lower Vocs for the higher concentrations could probably be attributed to an increase in the series resistance due to the thicker film formation. The average PCE of 15.91% for the 0.1 M-based SnO2 was higher than the values for other concentrations (average PCE = 14.21% (0.05 M), 14.72% (0.15 M), and 14.94% (0.2 M)), which was likely due to the different degree of hysteresis. In terms of the PCE and hysteresis, the optimal condition for the SnO2 layer on the FTO substrate was found to be precursor concentration of 0.1 M and the annealing temperature of 250 °C.

In Fig. 13, the statistical data are presented depending on the precursor concentration. The solid lines and dashed lines represent the reverse scan data and forward scan data, respectively. As observed in Fig. 12, a similar tendency can be observed. Little differences in the Jsc and Voc values between the reverse and forward scan data can be observed regardless of the concentration, while FF is better for the concentrations equal to and higher than 0.1 M compared to 0.05 M. As a result, the highest average PCE was observed for the 0.1 M condition.

Solid lines and dashed lines represent the reverse scan data and forward scan data, respectively, measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. Voltage settling time (scanning rate) was 200 ms. 
To study the charge separation efficiency depending on the precursor concentration, time-integrated and time-resolved PL were measured (Fig. 14). PL quenching was significantly influenced by the precursor concentration (Fig. 14a), whereby the largest PL quenching was observed for the 0.1 M concentration, being indicative of the most efficient charge separation among the investigated concentrations. This was in part responsible for the better photovoltaic performance. The time constants for the charge separation calculated from biexponential decay calculations were 1.24 ns, 1.08 ns, 1.29 ns and 1.43 ns for the 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.015 M and 0.2 M concentrations, respectively (Fig. 14b). The fastest charge separation kinetics of the 0.1 M-based SnO2 correlate with negligible hysteresis.

Impedance spectroscopy was performed to elucidate the disappearance of hysteresis in the presence of the 0.10 M-based SnO2 film. We tried to measure the impedance spectroscopy for all the precursor concentrations, except for the 0.10 M concentration, and we failed to obtain reliable data for the other concentrations due to their instability under illumination and bias conditions. The capacitance of the SnO2-based device of FTO/SnO2 (0.10 M, 250 °C)/(FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125/spiro-MeOTAD/Au was obtained from the Nyquist plots in Fig. 15a and b and is compared with that of the device without (bare) SnO2, under illumination (Fig. 15c) and in the dark (Fig. 15d). In Fig. 15a, two semicircles could be observed under illumination, where the low-frequency semicircle (second semicircle) is related to electrode polarization due to ionic and electronic accumulation at the interface.52,60 This low-frequency semicircle is much larger for the 0.1 M-induced SnO2 than for bare FTO (w/o SnO2), which indicates that charge accumulation is suppressed by SnO2, which is well consistent with the lower capacitance at low frequency in the capacitance–frequency data, as shown in Fig. 15c. The inductive loop in the Nyquist plots for the SnO2 is indicative of reduced charge accumulation because this unusual shape was reported to be observed in the absence of charge accumulation.52 The impedance results in the dark in Fig. 15b correlate with ion accumulation because of the absence of photogenerated carriers. As compared to a single semicircle appearing at relatively low resistance for the bare FTO (w/o SnO2), there are two distinct semicircles with higher resistances for SnO2. This is indicative of the suppression of ion accumulation in the presence of SnO2, which is well consistent with the plateau nature displayed in Fig. 15d. Thus, charge accumulation suppressed by SnO2 can explain the markedly reduced hysteresis in the presence of the 0.1 M-based and 250 °C-annealed SnO2 thin layer in the planar perovskite solar cell.

Inset in (b) shows a semicircle for the bare FTO (w/o SnO2). Capacitance–frequency data extracted from the Nyquist plots: (c) under illumination and (d) in the dark. All the data were detected under a short-circuit condition. 
A further improvement in PCE was achieved by the doping of a potassium ion in the perovskite lattice. Based on the 0.1 M-based and 250 °C-annealed SnO2 thin film, average photovoltaic parameters of Jsc = 22.64 mA.cm2, Voc = 1.144 V and FF = 0.74 were obtained from the planar perovskite solar cell (Fig. 16a) having a 40 nm-thick SnO2 thin layer deposited conformally on the FTO substrate (Fig. 16b). This results in an average PCE of 19.17% (reverse scan PCE = 19.40%, forward scan PCE = 18.93%). The basis for the improved photovoltaic performance by potassium ion doping is related to defect engineering. The presence of energetically favorable Frenkel defects via iodide displacement was confirmed by computational simulation, which could be protected by potassium ion doping in the octahedral interstices. Potassium ion doping has been found to be a universal approach toward achieving hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells, and this approach is described in detail in the manuscript submitted to the journal separately.

Conclusion
We developed an efficient SnO2 thin film for use as an ETL layer in planar perovskite solar cells. A tin(IV) isopropoxide-based precursor solution was used to deposit a thin SnO2 film on an FTO glass substrate. The annealing temperature and precursor concentration were found to be critical in terms of the photovoltaic performance and hysteresis. SnO2 with an amorphous nature and thickness of about 40 nm was found to be optimal for hysteresis-free high photovoltaic performance. A PCE of 19.17% was averaged out from the reverse and forward scan data, which is one of highest efficiencies reported among the reported values for planar perovskite solar cells based on a SnO2 ETL layer. Consequently, solution-processed SnO2 is believed to be one of the most promising ETL layers for hysteresis-free and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
