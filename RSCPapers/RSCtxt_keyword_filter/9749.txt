dyes containing a carboxyl group and a long alkyl chain, in particular 
3-carboxymethyl-5-[2-(3-alkyl-2-benzothiazoli- 
nyldene)ethylidene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone, showed remarkably 
high solar–energy efficiency (4.2%, AM-1.5, 100 mW 
cm−2).Since Grätzel et al. reported a highly efficient 
solar cell (incident solar light–power conversion efficiency, 
ηsun = 10%) based on a nanocrystalline 
TiO2 semiconductor electrode sensitized by a Ru complex,1,2 the studies on dye sensitization of porous 
oxide semiconductors have been actively investigated. Most papers on the 
Grätzel type solar cell so far have focused on metal complex dyes such 
as bipyridyl and porphyrin derivatives, and little attention has been shown 
to the use of organic dyes as photosensitizers. There are some early works 
on the spectral sensitization of non-porous semiconductors using organic 
dyes,3 however, the efficiencies were quite 
low. It is worthwhile to develop highly efficient organic dye sensitizers 
from the standpoint of low cost, saving of limited precious metal resources 
and the easy handling for cell recycling without removal of metal, however, 
the efficiencies of Grätzel type cells sensitized by organic dyes were 
relatively low (ηsun < 1.3%).4–10 Here we 
investigated various kinds of merocyanine organic dyes containing a 
carboxyl group as an anchor to attach the dye on the semiconductor surface. 
Merocyanine dyes have been studied on dye multi-layer photovoltaic cells 
based on a Shottky-type barrier at the metal/dye film contact,11–13 but have been rarely 
investigated on Grätzel cells. We report here, for the first time, 
that some merocyanine dyes show excellent efficiencies up to 
ηsun = 4.2% on porous TiO2 semiconductor 
electrodes, and also investigate the relationship between solar cell 
efficiency and the structure of the dyes.All dyes were synthesized by Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc. 
The preparation of the porous TiO2 film electrode on a 
conducting glass support (F-SnO2,10 Ω 
sq−1) was via the published procedure.2 TiO2 powder (Nihon Aerosil, P-25) was 
mainly used in order to prepare a TiO2 paste for coating. 
Adsorption of a dye on the TiO2 surface was carried out by 
soaking the TiO2 electrode in a 220 mg dm−3 dry 
ethanol solution of the dye at 80 °C for 1 h, and the electrode was 
washed with ethanol. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was 
incorporated into a thin-layer sandwich-type solar cell with a 
Pt/conducting glass as counter electrode and electrolyte solution. To 
investigate the efficiency of dyes (Table 
1), an Xe lamp with suitable band pass filters (3–4 mW 
cm−2) and UV cut off filter was used as the light source. 
The incident solar light–electric energy conversion efficiency 
(ηsun) was measured with a solar simulator (AM-1.5, 
WACOM Co.).

type [Ma, X = C(CH2)2] and benzothiazole type (Mb, X 
= S) merocyanines, a widely used merocyanine dye, as shown in Scheme 1. Both Ma(2)-N and Mb(2)-N dyes containing 
a carboxyl group adsorbed strongly on the TiO2 surface, and 
showed significantly high efficiencies. On the other hand, the Mb(2)′ 
dye containing no carboxyl group scarcely adsorbed on TiO2 and 
the cell efficiency was negligible, suggesting that the presence of 
anchoring groups to adsorb on the semiconductor surface is essential for 
efficient dye-sensitization. In the studies of solid photovoltaic cells 
using dye multi-layer electrodes without semiconductors,11,13 various kinds of merocyanine dyes 
including Ma and Mb dyes were examined, and the carboxyl group was not 
essential in contrast to the dye-sensitized semiconductor cells studied 
here. The incident photon–current efficiencies (IPCE) of the 
dye-sensitized semiconductor cells in our study were superior to those of 
solid photovoltaic cells (IPCE <22%).11–13 Scheme 1  Structure of merocyanine dyes; for the identity of X, Y and Z see 
Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the light absorption spectra 
of Mb(2)-N in ethanol solution (a) and Mb(2)-N on a TiO2 
electrode (b), in addition to the IPCE action spectrum of the 
Mb(2)-N/TiO2 cell (c). The absorption peak maximum 
(λmax) and the absorption threshold 
(λthreshold) of various dyes in ethanol and on 
TiO2 are also shown in Table 
1. All merocyanine dyes had a narrow absorption band in ethanol 
solution, and the peak at around 500 nm was assigned to the monomer.12 By adsorbing the dye on the TiO2 
electrode, a broadening of the absorption spectrum and a large red shift of 
the absorption threshold were observed in all electrodes. The IPCE action 
spectrum was as broad as the absorption spectrum on TiO2. 
Similar broadening and red shifts have been reported on several merocyanine 
multi-layer electrodes without semiconductors.11,12 Therefore, it is suggested that the interaction 
between neighboring dyes causes the red shift and the broadening of the 
absorption. The changes of absorption on the merocyanine multilayer 
electrode are explained on the basis of exciton phenomena, calculated from 
the molecular packing structure of the dye aggregate and the coupling of 
transition dipoles.11 It was reported that 
a J-aggregate of Mb(2)-N, which showed a large red shift and a sharp 
absorption peak at 610 nm, was formed in the TiO2 mesoporous 
network after aqueous solution treatment.14 
In our experiments, while a large red shift of the absorption was observed, 
no sharp absorption peak at ca. 610 nm was observed. Therefore, we 
speculate that small J-like aggregates were formed on the TiO2, 
and that chemical anchoring on the TiO2 surface restricted the 
formation of large and highly oriented J-aggregates. Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of Mb(2)-N in ethanol solution (a), Mb(2)-N on 
TiO2 electrode (b) and IPCE action spectrum of the 
Mb(2)-N/TiO2 cell (c). The TiO2 electrode and the 
electrolyte were same as indicated in Table 
1. We investigated the merocyanines [Mb(m)-N] with long straight 
alkyl chains (carbon number: m = 2, 5, 10 and 18) in detail, since 
it has been reported that the formation of J-aggregates is more facile with 
increasing length of alkyl chain in the study of dye multi-layer 
electrodes.12,13 The peak maximum and 
threshold of absorption for Mb(m)-N on TiO2 were 
slightly shifted to the longer wavelength with an increase in m 
(Table 1). In addition the rise of 
absorption at the threshold became sharp with increasing m. The 
IPCE of Mb(m)-N/TiO2 cells at ca. 520 nm 
increased with an increase of m, and these electrodes had the same 
values of light harvesting efficiency at 520 nm. Therefore, it is suggested 
that the intrinsic sensitization efficiency, i.e. quantum 
efficiency, increased with the length of alkyl chain.In discussing the relationship between the sensitization efficiency and 
the presence of long alkyl chains the electron injection process from the 
excited state of the dye to the TiO2 generally competes with 
other undesirable processes, and photo-isomerization is one of the major 
decay pathways for merocyanine.10 The 
presence of long alkyl chains and aggregate formation probably prevents 
isomerization by the restriction of rotation around the methine chain. 
Moreover, in the J-aggregate crystal structure of Mb(2)-N sodium salt 
octahydrate,14 the alkyl chain is located 
at the opposite side of the carboxyl group, and the formation of single 
isomers and uniform orientation of the dye seem to be important factors for 
good J-aggregation. It is speculated that the repulsion between long alkyl 
chains and the TiO2 surface might help form the predominant 
isomer, in which the alkyl chain lies far apart from the carboxyl group 
anchoring on the TiO2 surface. Mb(2)-M, which has a carboxyl 
group at another position Z instead of position Y, showed almost same 
efficiency as Mb(2)-N. On the other hand, the photocurrent of Ma(2)-NM 
containing two carboxyl groups was very low compared with that of Ma(2)-N 
containing one carboxyl group. The configuration and aggregation of 
Ma(2)-NM on TiO2 were very restricted by two anchors, and this 
might affect the photocurrent. From all the results, it is concluded that 
the control of configuration and aggregation of the merocyanine dye are 
very important factors in improving the solar cell efficiency.Finally, we improved the efficiency of the Mb(18)-N/TiO2 
solar cell using thicker TiO2 films (ca. 13 μm 
thickness) prepared by the alkoxide method using a different electrolyte 
solution consisting of a mixture of LiI (0.1 M), 
1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M), iodine (0.05 M), 
4-tert-butylpyridine (1 M) and methoxyacetonitrile as 
solvent.2,15 The maximum 
ηsun value under solar simulated light (100 mW 
cm−2, AM-1.5, 0.25 cm2) was ca. 4.2% 
(Isc: 9.7 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.62 V, ff: 69%), the best value 
among organic dye systems reported so far.3–10 The stability of these dyes 
in a sealed solar cell is now under investigation.Notes and referencesB. O’Regan and M. Grätzel, Nature, 1991, 353, 737 CrossRef CAS .M. Nazeeruddin, A. Kay, I. Rodicio, R. Humphry-Baker, E.
