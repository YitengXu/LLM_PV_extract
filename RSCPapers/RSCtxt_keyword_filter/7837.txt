    , Accepted 3rd July 2013First published on 3rd July 2013AbstractAn innovative biopolymer composite electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), obtained by quasi-solidifying an indigenous liquid electrolyte containing supporting salts and I3−/I− redox couple with a mixture of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC) is proposed. This is the first ever report indicating the useful aspects of CMC as a component in the electrolyte of a photovoltaic device and the requisite parameters are thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the performances of the lab scale quasi-solid devices are presented by means of a combined photovoltaic-chemometric approach, definitely innovative for the study of polymer based electrolytes for DSSCs. We also present the durability of the devices inherited by different PEO:CMC ratios as well as the response of the cells to various wavelengths and irradiation intensities. The intriguing photovoltaic-chemometric approach allows developing a device with efficiencies up to 5.18% under 1 sun irradiation (∼7% under 0.4 sun). The cumulative effect by the strategic components employed in the gel-polymer electrolyte demonstrates an outstanding durability with an excellent efficiency as high as 98% even after 250 h of extreme aging conditions.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been under intense investigation since the first report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1 The possibility to fabricate these devices at low cost and their relatively high sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency, reaching more than 12%,2 make such cells promising alternatives to the classical silicon-based photovoltaic panels.3 However, the presence of liquid electrolytes in such devices may result in some practical limitations of sealing and durability.4 Thus, several attempts were made to quasi-solidify the liquid electrolyte by using gelling agents,5 ionic liquids,6 nanoparticles,7 oligomers,8 or replacing the electrolyte with p-type semiconductors,9 polymer membranes,10 or conductive organic materials.11
A liquid electrolyte encompassed in a polymer matrix has proven to be an effective strategy to ensure good performance, non-volatility, chemical and electrochemical stability.12 In particular, polyethylene oxide (PEO,13), poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP,14), polyvinyl chloride (PVC,15) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA,16) can provide a polymer matrix capable of guaranteeing good and durable sunlight conversion efficiencies to the corresponding DSSCs. Bio-polymer matrices such as agarose,17 chitosan,18 acrylic-grafted cellulose,19 and cyanoethylated hydroxypropyl cellulose20 have also been used for quasi-solidifying liquid electrolytes. In general, it has been observed that the traditional synthetic polymers are capable to ensure good device durability, while the biopolymers have the peculiarity to act effectively on particular photovoltaic parameters, thus increasing the sunlight conversion efficiency.
In this study, we propose the quasi-solidification of a liquid electrolyte by means of a combined system consisting of PEO and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC). Although PEO is well known in this field for its good performance, non-toxicity and low cost, to the best of our knowledge CMC has never been used for the preparation of electrolytes for photovoltaic devices. CMC is an anionic polysaccharide obtained by the modification of cellulose with monochloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide. Each unit contains carboxyl and hydroxyl groups which enable hydrogen bonding. The average number of carboxymethyl groups per anhydroglucose unit is theoretically 3, but in commercially available samples it usually varies from 0.5 to 1.5.21 Due to its low cost, biocompatibility and edibility (used in food additives, toothpastes, diet pills),22 CMC has recently been introduced in the field of energy harvesting and conversion as biomass in enzymatic biofuel cells23 and as binding agents for nanocrystalline anodes in lithium-ion batteries.24 In this work, the performances of different PEO:CMC systems are evaluated by means of a combined photovoltaic-chemometric approach which gives the possibility to study the photoelectrochemical activity on a large experimental domain. The presently developed approach is innovative in the study of gelled electrolytes for DSSCs. We also present the effect on the durability of the devices caused by different PEO:CMC ratios, as well as the response of the cells to different radiation intensities and wavelengths.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Polyethylene oxide (PEO, average Mw: 400000), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC, average Mw: 250000), acetonitrile (CH3CN), sodium iodide (NaI), 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Conducting glass plates (FTO glass, Fluorine doped Tin Oxide over-layer, sheet resistance 7 Ω/sq, purchased from Solaronix) were cut into 2 × 2 cm2 sheets and used as substrate for both the deposition of a TiO2 porous thin layer from a paste (DSL 18NR-AO, Dyesol) and the fabrication of platinized counter-electrodes. Sensitizing dye cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Ruthenizer 535 bis-TBA) was purchased from Solaronix.
2.2 Preparation of gel-polymer electrolytes
A homogeneous liquid electrolyte solution was prepared by thoroughly mixing 0.3 M NaI, 0.03 M I2, 0.2 M MPII and 0.35 M TBP with acetonitrile. The quasi-solidification of this liquid electrolyte was carried out by adding different amounts of PEO and CMC (in various ratios), as detailed in paragraph 2.4. The system was kept under constant stirring for 2 h at 40 °C, until a homogeneous mixing was obtained.
2.3 Assembly and characterization of DSSCs
Concerning the photoanode preparation, FTO covered glasses were rinsed with acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. Then, all traces of solvents were removed by flash evaporation on a hotplate at 500 °C. The DSL 18NR-AO active opaque titania paste, which consists of active anatase particles (∼20 nm) and larger anatase scatter particles (up to 450 nm), was deposited on FTO by doctor-blade technique and successively dried at 100 °C for 10 min on a hotplate. A sintering process at 525 °C for 30 min allowed the formation of a nanoporous TiO2 layer having an average thickness of 8 ± 0.2 μm, measured by a profilometer (P.10 KLA-Tencor Profiler). The sensitization of the photoelectrodes was performed by soaking to a 0.4 mM N719 dye solution in ethanol overnight at ambient temperature, followed by washing in ethanol to remove the unadsorbed dye.
After cleaning, FTO-glass platinized counter electrodes were coated with a 5 nm Pt thin film deposited by thermal evaporation.
Quasi-solid state DSSCs were assembled by spreading with a spatula the different PEO:CMC gel electrolytes over the sensitized photoanode surface. Then, photoanode and cathode were clamped together, and kept at a distance of 70 μm by means of a layer of inert tape. A cyanoacrylate based glue was used for the final sealing. The slight pressure applied in this sealing step was also useful to facilitate the penetration of the gel into the layer of sensitized semiconductor, assuring homogeneous wetting of the active material.
The active area of the cell was 0.78 cm2 and the photovoltaic measurements were performed with a 0.22 cm2 rigid black mask. I–V electrical characterizations under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) were carried out using a class A solar simulator (91195A, Newport) and a Keithley 2440 source measure unit. The photoelectric performances (i.e. fill factor FF and light-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency η) were calculated by the following equations: (1) (2)where Voc is the open-circuit potential (V), Jsc the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Pin the incident light power density (mW cm−2), Vmax (V) and Jmax (mA cm−2) are the potential and the current density in the J–V curves, respectively, at the point of maximum power output.25I–V measurements were also performed at light intensities in the range of 0.4–1 sun, by using neutral density filters.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a 100-W QTH lamp (Newport) as light source and a 150-mm Czerny Turner monochromator (Omni-l 150, Lot-Oriel).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a CH Instruments 760D electrochemical workstation in the frequency range between 10 mHz and 20 kHz.
2.4 Design of experiments (DoE)
Chemometrics is the process by which data are converted into useful information for decision-making in science.26 In the modern era, a strong imbalance between the technical ability to generate a large number of excellent experimental data and the human ability to interpret them all is known and worrying. Holding a large amount of data does not mean possessing a great number of information. In this context, design of experiments (DoE) has the goal of planning the type and number of experiments required to obtain the maximum possible information from the system under investigation.
The first step entails the selection of the variables to be investigated and their relative experimental domain. For our purposes, the experimental variables were the CMC:PEO ratio (x1) and the amount of liquid electrolyte in the gel (x2). The rank of values associated with the variables: x1 was between 0 and 0.27, x2 ranged between 50 and 60 wt%. This experimental domain was chosen according to preliminary tests useful to identify the most appropriate conditions to obtain a uniform and stable gel-polymer electrolyte. In order to carry out a multivariate experimental design, we adopted the software MODDE, (version 7.0.0.1, Umetrics), widely used in chemistry27 and materials science.28
According to different mathematical criteria and boundary conditions, many chemometric models have been proposed. For our purposes, a D-Optimal design was selected. D-Optimal's goal is that of maximizing the information in the selected set of experimental runs with respect to a stated model. In other words, for a specified regression model, such as: y = X·β + ε(3)where y is a (N × 1) vector of observed responses (i.e., DSSC efficiency values), X is a (N × p) extended design matrix, containing the n experimental runs extended with additional columns for p terms of the model (i.e., constant term, interaction terms, square terms,…), β is a (p × 1) vector of unknown coefficients to be determined by fitting the model to the observed responses, ε is a (N × 1) vector of residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values of the response y), the D-Optimal design maximizes the determinant of the X′X matrix, which is an overall measure of the information in X.29
D-Optimal designs are constructed by selecting N runs from a candidate set, which is the discrete set of “all potential good runs” present in the experimental domain defined by the experimenter. Then, depending on a selected statistical criterion and a given number of design runs, the best design is created by a selection process. We selected G-efficiency as statistical criterion, defined by the following equation: (4)where p is number of terms in the model, n is number of runs in the design, and d is the maximum relative prediction variance over the candidate set. The higher the value of Geff, the higher is the possibility to obtain the maximum amount of information from the experiments that will be performed. In our case, the highest Geff was obtained for a D-Optimal design with 14 experiments, which will be detailed in the following paragraphs. A thorough discussion of the mathematical and statistical basis behind the DoE we have chosen can also be found elsewhere.30,31
The two variables (x1 and x2) were codified in 4 and 3 levels, respectively. In fact, in addition to choosing the experimental range, the experimenter can also choose in how many levels the investigated domain can be divided. For example, the variable x1 will be studied on 4 levels (CMC:PEO weight ratio = 0, 0.09, 0.18, 0.27), which can also be normalized (uncoded levels: −1, −0.3, +0.3, +1).

Table 1 presents the experimental matrix generated by the software. The experimental response (y) we decided to evaluate was the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) under 1 sun. In order to evaluate the experimental reproducibility, three replicates (N5, N13, N14) of the central point were carried out. In fact, the DoE reproducibility was initially evaluated on the experimental point with all the variables at their intermediate value. However, since the study of the reproducibility on a single experiment might seem insufficient, a second step of validation of the chemometric model will be carried out in the following sections.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Gel-polymer electrolyte preparation and optimization
The quasi-solidification of the NaI/I2/MPII/TBP/CH3CN-based liquid electrolyte with PEO and CMC was carried out. The stirring assured a complete mixing of all the components, and a homogeneous gel was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1. The gel was dense, translucent/transparent, no flowing and in easily deformable viscous state; moreover, it could stay stable for long time even in horizontal line and it did not sag or droop when keeping the bottle bottom up.
 Fig. 1  Preparation procedure and aspect of a homogeneous PEO:CMC gelled electrolyte (in an overturned vessel and on a spatula), and the assembled quasi-solid DSSC. 
The composition of the gel-polymer electrolyte and the resulting performances of lab-scale DSSCs were investigated by means of a chemometric approach. This mathematical multivariate analysis method is a powerful tool to optimize functional materials, simultaneously determining variables as others are modified. With this mathematical technique, the operational variables (i.e., amount of PEO, amount of CMC and amount of liquid electrolyte) can be simultaneously changed in order to identify the weight of each one and the relation between them, indicating synergies and antagonisms. Most of the research in DSSCs consists in monovariate analysis, even when this procedure leads to error when interactions between the variables occur. Thus, an experimental design that simultaneously studies different variables is necessary to obtain an empirical mathematical equation for factors, as well as a response map that considers the influence of parameters.
The results of the quadratic model for the sunlight to energy conversion efficiencies obtained are shown in Table 1. Multiple linear regression (MLR) interpolation parameters were R2 = 0.94 and Q2 = 0.77. Here, R2 represents the fraction of the variation of the response explained by the model and Q2 is the fraction of the variation of the response that can be predicted by the model. More generally, R2 and Q2 provide the summary of the fit of the model: R2 is an overestimated and Q2 an underestimated measure of the goodness of the fitting of the model. Both of these values are close to 1, which means that the regression model provides an excellent description of the relationship between the independent variables and the response. Additional statistical parameters useful for evaluating the goodness of the chemometric model are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI.†
The set of experiments allowed us to achieve a maximum light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 5.18% (short circuit current density Jsc = 10.03 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage Voc = 0.75 V, fill factor FF = 0.69) for the gel-polymer electrolyte obtained using a CMC:PEO ratio of 0.09, and an amount of liquid electrolyte equal to 55 wt%.

Fig. 2 shows the influence of each variable on the response, with 95% confidence. This coefficient plot is useful to develop the modelling equation, an empirical relationship between the response and the variables expressed in polynomial form. Due to statistical analysis, it is left out the following equation: y (%) = 4.43(±0.12) + 0.2(±0.035)x1 + 0.14(±0.025)x2 − 0.31(±0.046)x1x1 − 0.22(±0.034)x2x2 + 0.11(±0.02)x1x2(5)where y (%): light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, x1: CMC:PEO weight ratio, x2: wt% of liquid electrolyte in the gel. The coefficients indicate the importance of each factor in the equation. It is interesting to note that the coefficients of x1 and x2 are positive, while those of the quadratic effects are negative. This means that a slight increase in x1 and x2 leads to an increase in DSSC efficiency, but high values of these factors lead to a decrease in the performance of the device. Lastly, the interaction term x1·x2 is positive, which indicates the presence of a synergistic effect between the two considered variables.

The response surface of the quadratic matrix of 14 experiments is reported in Fig. 3, where the maximum response zone for sunlight conversion efficiency is observed at x1 = 0.09 and x2 = 55. To validate the experimental model, two hypotheses were analyzed:
- H0: dependency between the variables does not exist.
- H1: dependency between the variables exists.

The Student's t-test was applied using the quadratic differences between the results and their average, giving a probability of 5% for H0 and a probability of 95% for H1, corroborating H1: dependency between the variables exists.
To further corroborate the statistical model, a cross-validation process (i.e., a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a chemometric model will generalize to an independent data set) was carried out. In practical terms, the software generated some new experiments to be done, and also predicted the result to be obtained experimentally. Validation of the model is achieved if the obtained experimental results for these further runs are – with 95% confidence – adherent to the predicted result. In our case, the obtained results were closely co-related with the predicted data, meaning that the chemometric model we present here is valid and robust.
3.2 Photovoltaic parameters

I–V electrical characterization under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) was carried out on the 14 quasi-solid DSSCs of Table 1. Fig. 4 represents the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) resulting from the light illumination.
 Fig. 4  Dependence of the photovoltaic parameters (A = Jsc, B = Voc, C = FF, D = η) on x1 and x2 variables. 
As shown in Fig. 4A, Jsc values are strongly influenced by the quantity of liquid electrolyte present in the gel: when the latter increases, Jsc values grow up. Thus, it can be reasonably argued that the decrease of Jsc values in the presence of low amounts of liquid electrolyte is due to the increase in viscosity of the gel-polymer electrolyte, which hinders the ion transport and leads to low ionic conductivity.32 Furthermore, in all cases it is observed that the presence of CMC in the gel does not act in favor of Jsc values. Overall, from this first analysis it seems that the presence of CMC in the electrolytes lowers the performance of the photovoltaic devices.
Also Voc values, the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of electrolyte, noticeably change in the investigated experimental domain (Fig. 4B). First of all, it is known that oxygen atoms in the ethylene oxide moieties of PEO shift the flat band potential of TiO2 to negative values due to their Lewis base nature, contributing to the Voc increase observed in the presence of increasing amounts of polymer with respect to the liquid component.33 Furthermore, it can be observed that Voc values grow in the presence of small amounts of CMC (CMC:PEO = 0.09), and then begin to decline. The increase in Voc is most likely due to a synergistic effect of both TBP and CMC. It's known that the ability of TBP of covering the TiO2 surface leads to an increase of Voc values, attributed to a combined effect of the shift of the CB of TiO2 towards a negative direction (with respect to the unbound vacuum state) as well as longer electron lifetimes in the CB.34 Furthermore, the interaction of carboxyl group of CMC on the electrode surfaces may lead to an increased Voc as well. In fact, CMC, with its –CH2COO− moieties, can attach to the surface of the TiO2 electrode and reduce the interaction between the electrons and I3− ions, thereby decreasing the rate of recombination. In this way, the trap states of the TiO2 electrode will be further shielded, thus leading to an increased recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, as observed in preliminary studies of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S3 in ESI†). In our opinion, due to its higher hydrophilic nature as well as higher charged surface with respect to TBP, CMC could play a major role in the Voc increase, but the final hypothesis can be derived only after intense study and work is in progress in this direction. However, in the presence of higher amounts of CMC (CMC:PEO ≥ 0.18), Voc values begin to decrease. This fact seems ascribable to the marked decrease in Jsc values (and correspondingly the ionic conductivity) showed in Fig. 4A.35 In fact, the lower electrolyte conductivity would favor charge recombination losses arising from electrons in the TiO2 CB/trap states and the electrolyte acceptors, thus decreasing Voc. Clear evidence for this behavior may be provided by J–V curves measured under dark condition (Fig. S4 in ESI†), since DSSCs based on the gel-polymer electrolyte with high CMC content exhibit higher dark current values.
The trend of FF values (Fig. 4C) is a logical overlay of those of Jsc and Voc. On the one hand, the ability of DSSCs to retain high FF values is due to the suppression of the charge recombination at high voltages; on the other hand, when the conductivity decreases, the ionic mobility and the diffusion coefficient of I−/I3− of course decreases. This reduces the supply of I3− ions to the Pt counter electrode, causing a depletion of I3− at its surface, thus decreasing the FF of the cell.36

Fig. 4D shows the effect of the parameters above described on the sunlight conversion efficiency of the quasi-solid DSSCs. It can be observed that the best performances were obtained in the presence of gel containing 55 wt% of liquid electrolyte and low CMC:PEO ratios. In particular, it must be stressed the Voc = 0.75 V for N5 cell of Table 1: in addition of being itself already a great value, this is one of the highest values ever achieved in the field of bio-based electrolyte for DSSCs.19 From the above results, it was demonstrated that the quantity of each component incorporated in the gel-polymer electrolyte played a crucial role in the cell performance, and the role of the DoE in achieving this goal was crucial.
3.3 Further photovoltaic characterizations
One interesting observation in this study was the decrease in Jsc values when increasing the CMC content. This fact can be confirmed by IPCE measurements, which represents the conversion efficiency of incident photon to current. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the broad IPCE curves, covering almost the entire visible spectrum from 370 to 800 nm, exhibit maximum values of about 50% for the cell without CMC, and about 46% for the cell with a CMC:PEO ratio equal to 0.09. These values are well in agreement with the Jsc values of the cells reported in Table 1.
 Fig. 5  Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs assembled with different CMC:PEO weight ratio, for gels containing 55 wt% of liquid electrolyte. 
The effect of different light intensities on the photovoltaic performance of the best DSSC (i.e., N5 in Table 1) was investigated. For this purpose, we implemented a set of I–V measurements with incident light intensity ranging from 0.4 to 1 sun. As shown in Fig. 6, under the illumination of different light intensities, Jsc value varies from 6.50 to 10.03 mA cm−2 and the open circuit potential slightly decreases. The DSSC demonstrates 6.98% light-to-electricity conversion efficiency under the illumination of 40 mW cm−2, thus showing excellent performances even under conditions of not optimal lighting (which can occur in real outdoor applications). Moreover, a good linear dependence of Jsc on the light intensity up to 1 sun is observed, indicating that neither the I−/I3− transportation nor electron transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface represent the rate-determining step.37 As reported elsewhere, this behavior can be related to the average collection efficiency in the wavelength range of interest.38

3.4 Stability test
The variation in the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs reported in Table 1 was investigated over 250 h. For this purpose, we present here a new chemometric approach, adopting the same D-optimal DoE previously described. However, this time the selected experimental response (y) is the efficient retention after 250 h of aging at 60 °C in dark condition. This experimental response is calculated using the following equation: (6)where ηt=0 and ηt=250h represent the sunlight conversion efficiencies of each cell after 0 and 250 h from the assembly, respectively. For this DoE, the obtained MLR interpolation parameters were R2 = 0.99 and Q2 = 0.83, indicating that the regression model provides again an excellent description of the relationship between the independent variables and the response.
As can be seen in Fig. 7, after 250 h the DSSCs based on the CMC:PEO gel-polymer electrolyte retained the 82–98% of the initial efficiency value, indicating that the cells exhibited a remarkable long term stability. Furthermore, in the initial 75 h of ageing, a slight increase in efficiency was observed: this was due to the achievement of the optimum filling of the gel into the mesoporous structure of the photoanode. From the graph, it can be also noted that the durability of the devices increased with the amount of CMC present in the gel-polymer electrolyte. This shows that the CMC, in addition to having a positive effect on the Voc of the device, acts favorably also on its durability. Furthermore, it is evident that the smaller the quantity of liquid electrolyte present in the gel, the greater the durability of the device. All this implies that DSSCs containing medium-high quantity of CMC and low amounts of liquid are capable of retaining, after 250 h, an efficiency in some cases approaching 98% of the initial value (see Fig. 8), which – if further extended, would be truly impressive, especially with respect to real-world applications.

Due to their remarkable and stable performances, our proposed indigenous DSSCs can be considered promising candidates to be potentially pursued for the next generation of sustainable bio-based DSSCs, being also easily fine-tunable depending on the application needs. Except some of the classical major ingredients, all the other proposed materials are biodegradable, biocompatible and, moreover, widely available and low cost. All these characteristics are particularly important when one consider the futuristic of any kind of nano-scale to mega-scale application of our gel (or even solid) polymer electrolyte.
4. Conclusions
A new bio-composite gel-polymer electrolyte has been prepared by quasi-solidifying an indigenously made I−/I3−-based liquid solution with proper PEO:CMC ratios and tested in quasi-solid DSSCs configuration. This is the first report on the use of CMC in third generation photovoltaic devices, in which, moreover, its efficiency in increasing the open circuit voltage and the durability of the devices is successfully demonstrated.
By means of a combined photovoltaic-chemometric approach, DSSCs assembled with the CMC:PEO gelled electrolyte achieved an efficiency of 5.18% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, with very good performance retention even after 250 h of aging at 60 °C. Quasi-solid cells showed excellent performance even in the presence of different radiation intensities, reaching almost 7% under 40 mW cm−2 illumination, which normally occurs in real outdoor application, and IPCE curves covered the entire visible spectrum.
The proposed gelled biopolymer electrolyte exhibits some attractive advantages, such as low cost, environmentally friendly, good light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, remarkable stability and ease of fabrication, thus demonstrating interesting prospects for further detailed analysis to be pursued in view of their possible implementation in the next generation of sustainable quasi-solid dye-sensitized solar cells.
