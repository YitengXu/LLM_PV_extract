    , Accepted 27th January 2021First published on 29th January 2021AbstractElectronic defects at grain boundaries and surfaces of perovskite crystals impair the photovoltaic performance and stability of solar devices. In this work, we report the compensation of photovoltage losses in blade-coated methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) devices via passivation with natural amino acid (NAA) molecules. We found that the optoelectronic properties of NAA-passivated perovskite films and the corresponding device performances are closely correlated with the molecular interaction strength. A side-by-side comparative study of four typical NAAs reveals that arginine (Arg) functionalized with a guanidine end group exhibits optimum passivation effects owing to the strongest coordinative bonding with the uncoordinated Pb2+, which markedly suppresses the detrimental antisite PbI deep level defects. As a result, nonradiative charge recombination is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantially increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.17 V and a high efficiency of 20.49%. A solar module with an active area of 10.08 cm2 is also fabricated, yielding an efficiency of 15.65% with negligible VOC losses. In parallel, the Arg-passivated solar devices exhibit enhanced operational stability due to the formation of a hydrophilic Arg protective layer which encapsulates the perovskite crystals.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention owing to their fast rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE), which already exceeds that of conventional vacuum-processed thin film photovoltaics such as cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide.1–3 Nevertheless, despite the impressive advance in device efficiency in recent years, the large efficiency losses associated with upscaling the devices and the inferior long-term stability are considered as the two major bottlenecks for commercializing the technology. Due to the fact that polycrystalline perovskite thin films are deposited by low-temperature nucleation and growth during solvent evaporation, a large number of defects can be formed at grain boundaries and at the surfaces during film formation.4,5 These defects not only serve as nonradiative recombination centers resulting in energy loss, but provide channels for fast oxygen and moisture invasion, thereby deteriorating the long-term stability of the devices.6–9 In this context, enhancing the efficiency as well as the stability of scalable printed PSCs by passivating uncoordinated surface states is highly demanded to realize practical application of PSCs.10–12
Several strategies have been actively pursued to increase the efficiency and stability of PSCs, such as composition engineering, interfacial modification and passivation with molecules/polymers.13–15 Among them, the customized design of additives has received much attention due to its manifold functionalities such as modulating morphology, healing defects and stabilizing the perovskite phase.6,16–19 Recently, introducing organic materials functionalized with amine (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups into the perovskite precursor solution or depositing on top of the surface has shown great progress in passivating the defects of perovskites.20–23 For instance, incorporating amino acid based organics into perovskite precursors is able to build 2D/3D heterostructures, leading to enhanced photovoltaic performance and improved stability.20,23,24 In 2019, Huang and coauthors reported that aromatic rings in amino acids can heal the neutral iodine defects, whereas the –NH2 and –COOH groups could suppress the charged defects.25
Previous studies have shown that small molecules containing –NH2 and –COOH moieties offer a viable approach to positively influence the efficiency and stability of perovskite devices. However, the molecular interaction between the amino acid molecules and the perovskite crystal lattice as well as the associated passivation mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we explore natural amino acids (NAAs) as effective passivation agents for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells by a combined experimental and theoretical study. It is found that the electronic quality of NAA-modified methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) films and their photovoltaic performance are directly related to the different molecular interaction strength. Arginine (Arg) functionalized with a guanidine end group exhibits the optimum passivation effect due to the strongest coordination with the uncoordinated Pb2+, which significantly reduces the antisite PbI deep level defects. As a result, the Arg-passivated PSCs prepared by blade-coating deliver a high PCE of 20.49% with a VOC of 1.17 V, which is about 100 mV higher than the one for pristine devices. A large-area solar module (10.08 cm2) underlined the relevance of our findings by demonstrating a representative high efficiency of 15.65% with negligible VOC losses.
2. Results and discussion
In this work, we select glycine (Gly), glutamic acid (Glu), proline (Pro), and arginine (Arg) as four prototype materials and study their passivation effect on MAPbI3, mainly considering their different coordination capabilities with Pb2+. Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the four NAAs, which are differentiated by the attached functional groups. Gly is the simplest amino acid with the amino and carboxyl connected with a carbon atom, whereas the Glu, Pro, and Arg are attached with a –COOH, pyrrolidine ring and guanidine end group, respectively. We expect that the lone electron pairs at the nitrogen atom in the NAAs can interact with the empty 6p orbitals of Pb2+and subsequently form bonds with different bonding strengths. In order to investigate the interaction forces between these NAAs and Pb2+, we first examined their solubility in DMF. As shown in Fig. S1,† the four NAAs alone are poorly soluble in DMF without addition of PbI2, even at a low concentration of 1 mg mL−1. With the introduction of PbI2, all the NAAs can be easily dissolved in DMF (1 mg mL−1), suggesting the formation of the PbI2–NAA adduct between the NAAs and PbI2. On further increasing the concentration of NAAs to 5 mg mL−1, only the Arg powder can be completely dissolved, resulting in a clear solution (Fig. S1†). This observation indicates that the coordination between Arg and Pb2+ is much stronger than those of the other three NAAs.

The concentrations of these NAAs are 1 mg mL−1. The scale bars are 1 μm. (g) The corresponding grain size distribution of these films. 
In view of their solubility behaviors, we fabricated perovskite thin films by incorporating the four NAA molecules with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 into a MAPbI3 precursor solution. Vacuum-assisted blade-coating was employed to prepare the NAA-modified perovskite films, which was recently developed in our laboratories as a reliable and scalable manufacturing process for highly qualitative perovskite layers (see ESI†).23,26 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed to examine the impact of NAAs on the morphology of the prepared perovskite films. It can be discerned from Fig. 1b–f that the NAAs have an obvious effect on the crystal morphology of the perovskite films. Compared with the pristine film, the NAA-modified perovskite layers exhibit a more compact surface morphology. In addition, the grain size of the NAA-modified perovskite crystals is increased (Fig. 1g), which can be attributed to the reduced crystallization rate and decreased nucleation number as a result of the strong coordination interaction between PbI2 and NAAs.10 It is further observed that the grain sizes can also be effectively modulated by introducing different dosages of NAAs. Larger crystal grains are obtained with higher levels of Arg (Fig. S2†). However, if the concentration is too high, the resulting film exhibits an inferior morphology with incomplete surface coverage (Fig. S2†). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to obtain deep insights into the surface morphology difference of the prepared films. As shown in Fig. S3,† all the NAA-modified perovskite films exhibit smaller surface root-mean-square roughness (10.98–14.12 nm) compared to the pristine film (17.54 nm).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the influence of NAAs on the crystallographic structures of the prepared perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2a, two distinct diffraction peaks located at around 14.1° and 28.5° are indexed to the (110) and (220) planes, which indicates the typical cubic structure of the MAPbI3 crystal.23,27 With the addition of NAAs, no shift in (110) diffraction peaks is observed (Fig. S4†), which implies that the NAAs do not impact the MAPbI3 crystal structure. The absence of a diffraction peak at a 2θ angle lower than 10° suggests that these NAA-modified MAPbI3 films are exclusively comprised of a 3D phase.2,28 Moreover, we found that the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak increases (Fig. 2a), and simultaneously the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak decreases upon NAA addition (Fig. S4†). These results indicate enhanced crystallinity of the NAA-modified perovskite films which is in excellent agreement with the enlarged grain sizes observed in SEM images. The light absorption capability of the NAA-modified perovskite films was investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. It is seen that the Arg-modified perovskite film shows slightly enhanced light absorption, which is probably due to its higher crystallinity and larger crystal size. The optical bandgaps extracted from the Tauc plot show negligible variations for the pristine and NAA-modified films with values between 1.57 and 1.58 eV respectively (Fig. S5†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to assess the coordination interactions between NAAs and the Pb2+ ions. As shown in Fig. 3c, the two peaks located at 138.1, and 142.9 eV for the pristine perovskite film are assigned to the binding energies of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively.29,30 With the introduction of NAAs, both the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 signals obviously shift to higher binding energies except for the Gly-modified film. The shift trends of I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2 peaks are in accordance with that of the Pb 4f peaks (Fig. S6a†). Considering that simple physical mixing could not bring the change of the chemical state, we ascribe the binding shifts to the formation of coordination bonds within the NAA-modified perovskite films. Moreover, the extent of the binding shift implies the different bonding strengths between the NAAs and Pb2+. The distinct Pb 4f shift of ∼0.5 eV to higher binding energies observed in the Arg-modified perovskite film suggests the stronger coordination interaction between the Arg and the Pb2+ ions than those of the other three NAAs. This observation is in good accordance with their solubility behaviors (Fig. S1†). The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of the pristine perovskite thin film shows two major peaks at 284.8 and 285.9 eV (Fig. S6b†), which can be assigned to C–C and C–N, respectively.31,32 In contrast, the emerging peak in the Arg-modified perovskite film at 288.8 eV is attributed to the C=O bonding from the carboxyl functional group of Arg, which suggests the existence of Arg in the modified perovskite films.

We continue to elucidate the coordination mechanism between the Arg and Pb2+ ions by carrying out attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) measurements. As shown in Fig. S6,† for Arg powder, two absorption peaks at 1184 and 1134 cm−1 are assigned to the NH3+ rocking and NH2 wagging vibrations, respectively.33 The peaks at 1419 and 772 cm−1 are attributed to COO− symmetric bending and its scissioning modes, respectively.34 These vibration peaks appearing in the spectrum of modified thin films indicate the presence of Arg in the perovskite even after annealing. Furthermore, the NH3+ vibrations of the Arg-modified perovskite shift by a few tens of wavenumbers, demonstrating the strong coordination bond with the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+ of MAPbI3 and the lone electron pair on the N atom of Arg. Combining the ATR-FTIR and XPS results, we conclude that the Arg molecules can favorably adsorb on the MAPbI3 crystals, and their strong coordinative bonding with the uncoordinated Pb2+ is expected to passivate the detrimental defects,21,24,35 thereby contributing to enhanced device performance.
To evaluate the impact of NAAs on the photovoltaic performance of solar cells, we fabricated planar inverted devices with a structure of “ITO/PTAA/perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag”. The cross-sectional SEM image of an Arg-modified device is demonstrated in Fig. S8.†Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion devices with or without NAA modification, with their photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. The PCEs of the Gly-, Glu-, Pro- and Arg-modified devices increase from 17.91% of the pristine device to 18.99%, 19.57%, 20.41%, and 20.49%, respectively, which is mainly contributed from an obvious increase in VOC. In particular, compared with the pristine device which exhibits a decent VOC of 1.07 V, the VOCs of the Glu-, Pro- and Arg-modified devices are noticeably enhanced to 1.16, 1.16 and 1.17 V respectively, which are among the highest VOC values for MAPbI3 solar devices (see Table S1†).36–38 The enhancement of VOC can be ascribed to the suppressed nonradiative recombination by effective defect passivation, which will be discussed later. Moreover, we found that the VOC values of NAA-modified devices are positively correlated with the interaction strength between the NAA molecules and uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, which was revealed by the XPS results as we discussed above. This finding suggests that these NAA molecules exhibiting strong interaction strength with perovskites are beneficial for defect passivation, which is consistent with the recent report.39 The statistic distributions of the device parameters are displayed in Fig. 3b and S9,† which illustrate the excellent reproducibility of the perovskites processed by one-step blade coating. The statistic histogram of the PCEs plotted in Fig. 3d shows an average value of 19.32% for the Arg-modified devices, which is much higher than that of the pristine device (16.55%).

The integration of EQE curves with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum yields current densities of 21.12 and 21.54 mA cm−2 for the pristine and Arg-modified devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the J–V measurement (Fig. 3e). Steady-state power output tracking exhibits a stabilized PCE of 16.19% and 20.05% for the pristine and Arg-modified devices, respectively, both showing a negligible decline after operating for 300 seconds (Fig. S10†). We note that all the solar devices exhibit a very small hysteresis (Fig. 3c and S11†).40 Besides, the influence of Arg concentration on the device performance was also studied. As illustrated in Fig. S12,† the PCE climbs gradually with addition of Arg at low concentrations and reaches a maximum at 1 mg mL−1. The low efficiency of the device processed with 5 mg mL−1 Arg mainly results from the reduction in FF (Table S2†), which is likely due to the inferior film morphology with poor surface coverage (Fig. S2†).
To demonstrate the scalability of the blade-coated perovskite thin films, we further fabricated a 4 × 4 cm2 module with four subcells monolithically interconnected in series.23 The active area of each subcell is 0.7 × 3.6 cm2, giving rise to a total active area of 10.08 cm2. Fig. 3f displays the J–V curves of the best-performing module based on Arg-modified perovskite, which yields a high active area efficiency of 15.65% from the reverse scan, with a JSC, VOC, and FF of 5.12 mA cm−2, 4.62 V, and 0.662, respectively. The PCE loss mainly comes from the lower FF due to the enhanced series resistance, which is more related to the patterning procedure than to the quality of the perovskite layer. Significantly, the negligible VOC losses of 15 mV for each subcell validate the viability of the one-step blade-coating for the preparation of high-quality perovskite thin films over large-areas.
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were recorded to analyze the impact of NAA addition on the passivation effect.41 As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the Gly-, Glu-, Pro- and Arg-modified perovskite films show intensive PL emission peaks, which are 2, 5, 5, and 16 times higher than that of the pristine MAPbI3 film respectively, suggesting that nonradiative recombination is largely suppressed in the NAA-modified perovskites.25,42 In particular, the remarkably enhanced PL emission of the Arg-modified perovskite film validates the optimum passivation effect of the Arg molecule among the four NAAs. In addition, compared to the pristine and Gly-modified films, small blue shifts of the emission peaks from 765 to 760 nm are observed for the Glu-, Pro- and Arg-modified perovskites, which can be ascribed to the alleviated energetic disorder as a result of removing tail states by defect passivation.8,43 The commensurate TRPL spectra of the perovskite films are displayed in Fig. 4b. The average PL decay time (τavg) of the pristine thin film is 298.6 ns, as derived by bi-exponential fitting. The acquired τavg values for the Gly-, Glu-, Pro- and Arg-modified thin films were calculated to be 325.3, 406.8, 397.6, and 513.4 ns, respectively (see Table S3†). The increase in carrier lifetimes is consistent with the measured VOC values, which again confirms the effective trap-state passivation in these NAA-modified perovskite thin films.

(c) Calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) profiles of Gly, Glu, Pro and Arg. (d) Charge density distribution of the MAPbI3 (001) surface with no defects. The electronic configurations of MAPbI3 (001) surfaces with antisite PbI defects are calculated and the trap state passivated by the –NH2 of (e) Gly and (f) Arg respectively. 
To unravel the passivation mechanism of different NAA molecules further, we employed the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electrostatic potential (ESP) and electronic structures were calculated to clarify the passivation effect on the Gly/MAPbI3 and Arg/MAPbI3 interfaces. To visualize the spatial distribution of electron potential, we performed the ESP analysis using the Gaussian 09 program. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the electron-deficient end group of –COOH is located at the electron-donor part (positive blue area). On the other hand, the electron-withdrawing area (negative red area) is located mainly around N and O atoms, providing a favorable condition for coordination with the surface defect. This dipolar charge distribution is much more obvious in the case of Arg, which could further enhance the interaction between Arg molecules and the uncoordinated ionic defects. These results are in good agreement with the XPS results and demonstrate the optimal passivation effect of Arg. The HOMO–LUMO electron distributions were also calculated to prove the dipolar electron density distribution (Fig. S13†).
We continue to evaluate the strong interaction between Arg and the periodic perovskite structure by carrying out VASP calculations. The results show that the bonding length between –NH2 of Arg and Pb is 2.44 Å, which is obviously smaller than that of Gly and Pb (2.66 Å). Compared with Gly/MAPbI3, the Arg/MAPbI3 system possesses a smaller adsorption energy with more efficient charge transfer (Table S4†), which indicates a more stable system and a better passivation effect. Furthermore, the charge densities of a pristine MAPbI3 (001) surface and of a defective surface passivated with –NH2 of either Gly or Arg molecules were calculated and are depicted in Fig. 4d–f. After absorbing Gly and Arg on the MAPbI3 surface with the presence of antisite PbI defects, we found that the charge distribution becomes uniform, analogous to the pure perovskite surface, due to the localized charges around defects being effectively passivated by Gly and Arg. Overall, both the experimental analysis and theoretical calculation indicate that the NAA molecules could form coordination bonding with the uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite and passivate the antisite PbI deep level defects.44,45 Furthermore, the passivation capability of the NAA molecules is positively correlated with their bonding strength with the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions.
In order to quantitatively determine the effect of introduction of Arg on the electronic quality of perovskite films, we fabricated hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PTAA/Ag. The corresponding J–V curves measured in the dark are presented in Fig. S14,† and the trap-state density (Ntrap) can be calculated according to the following equation:  where e is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, VTFL (trap-filled limit region) is the applied voltage at the kink point, and ε and ε0 represent the relative dielectric constant (∼35) and vacuum permittivity, respectively.45,46 The Ntrap calculated for the Arg-modified perovskite film is 1.72 × 1016 cm−3, which is lower than that of the pristine film (2.39 × 1016 cm−3). The reduction in trap density suggests higher electronic quality of the perovskite film, which can be ascribed to the passivation at the grain boundary by strong coordination bonding between the Arg molecule and the uncoordinated Pb2+ as above theoretically calculated.
To better understand the charge transfer and recombination dynamics in pristine and the Arg-modified devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. Fig. S15† shows the Nyquist plots of pristine and Arg-modified devices measured with a bias voltage in the dark over the frequency range from 100 mHz to 4 MHz. The obtained charge recombination resistance (Rrec) for the pristine and the Arg-modified devices is 3381.9 and 8723.6 Ω respectively. This result demonstrates that the charge recombination is greatly suppressed in the Arg-modified device.47,48 To probe the carrier lifetime in complete solar cells, we carried out transient photo-voltage (TPV) decay measurements with the devices operated under open circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. S16,† the carrier lifetime increases from 0.56 to 1.51 ms after the introduction of 1 mg mL−1 Arg. The significantly enhanced carrier lifetime suggests suppressed charge recombination in the Arg-modified device as a result of the reduced density of trapstates, and is thus responsible for the improved VOC.49,50
To investigate the effects of the Arg molecules on the shelf stability of PSCs, we stored the unencapsulated devices in a N2-filled glovebox under room-temperature (22–26 °C). It is found that the Arg-modified cell maintains 94.9% of its original efficiency after storage for one month (Fig. 5a), which is higher than the pristine device with 83.4% of the initial value preserved. The stability of the perovskite films was also evaluated under ambient conditions (relative humidity of 50% ± 10%, room-temperature). As shown in Fig. S17,† the pristine MAPbI3 film is mostly converted to yellow PbI2 after storage for one week, whereas the Arg-modified film retains its black color and perovskite phase with considerably reduced decomposition. The moisture stability of the solar devices was recorded under the same conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, the Arg-modified device retains 83.6% of its initial PCEs after 30 days of storage, whereas the PCE of the pristine device drops dramatically to 40.5% after two weeks. We further examined the light-soaking stability of the unencapsulated devices, which were stored in a glovebox (room-temperature) under continuous illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. After light soaking for 400 h, the Arg-modified device maintains over 80% of its initial PCE, whereas the pristine device undergoes a pronounced efficiency decline with only 36.4% efficiency preserved (Fig. 5c).

To elucidate the enhanced operational stability of the Arg-modified perovskite solar cells, we firstly examined the surface wettability of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 5d, the Arg incorporated perovskite film shows a higher contact angle of 70.5° compared with the pristine thin film (52.3°), demonstrating the decreased surface energy.23 From a macroscopic perspective, the improved hydrophobic properties of the modified surfaces are beneficial for inhibiting moisture and oxygen invasion. To gain further insight into the enhanced resistance toward moisture, we take a closer look at the microstructure of the Arg-modified MAPbI3 film. Fig. 5f shows the high-magnitude transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image taken from the selective area of a perovskite crystal presented in Fig. 5e. It is found that the spacing between the lattice fringes of the crystalline region is ∼0.31 nm, corresponding to the (004) plane of a typical MAPbI3 crystal.51 Significantly, it is observed that an amorphous thin layer with a thickness of ∼3 nm wraps around the crystalline perovskite crystal. The formation of such a hydrophilic Arg layer can serve as a protecting barrier for moisture penetration and possible ion migration, thus contributing to improved stability.52 We note that such a thin insulating layer does not negatively impact the solar cell performance as efficient charge transport can be realized by the quantum tunneling effect.53 On the other hand, the defect sites located at the film surface and grain boundaries can be energetically attacked by moisture and oxygen, which deteriorated the stability of devices.54,55 Therefore, the reduction of trap states endowed by Arg passivation is also responsible for the enhanced operational stability of solar cell devices.
Finally, to demonstrate the universal application of NAAs for efficient defect passivation, we randomly selected another six NAAs (lysine, histidine, serine, threonine, phenylalanine and aspartic acid) and evaluated their photovoltaic performance in blade-coated MAPbI3-based PSCs. The J–V curves of the best-performing devices modified with the six NAAs are shown in Fig. S18,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S5.† Compared with the pristine device, all the NAA-modified solar cells exhibit enhanced VOC values (exceeding 1.12 V) and improved PCEs (over 19%). These results attest to the universality of NAAs in passivating MAPbI3 for the construction of highly efficient PSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have discovered that NAAs are effective passivation agents to enhance the optoelectronic quality of scalable-coated MAPbI3 films. A combined experimental and theoretical study suggests that the passivation capability of NAAs is closely correlated with their molecular interaction strength with perovskites. The strong bonding strength between NAAs and uncoordinated Pb2+ is favorable for passivating the antisite PbI deep level defects. Arg bearing a guanidine end group exhibits the optimum passivation effect, which results in significantly suppressed nonradiative recombinations. As a result, the Arg-modified PSCs deliver a high PCE of 20.49% with a markedly enhanced VOC of 1.17 V, which is ∼100 mV higher than that of the pristine device. Importantly, benefiting from the reduction of trap states and the formation of a hydrophilic Arg protective layer, the prepared perovskite films and solar devices exhibit enhanced operational stability. In view of the merits of environmental friendliness, cheap cost and abundance of NAAs in combination with their superior passivation effect, this work sheds light on selecting and designing novel passivation agents for improving the optoelectronic properties of perovskites for diverse applications.
