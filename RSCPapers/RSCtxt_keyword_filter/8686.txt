, Accepted 3rd September 2015First published on 3rd September 2015AbstractTiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 core/shell/shell (CSS) nanorods (NRs) electrodes were synthesized by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method and applied as the photoelectrodes for high performance in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, wherein the narrow bandgap non-toxic materials, CuInS2 and Bi2S3, were selected to expand the light absorption range to the near-infrared region. The uniform Bi2S3 layer was directly covered on the previously coated CuInS2 layer on TiO2 NRs to prevent the polysulfide electrolytes' corrosion of CuInS2. The morphology, crystal structure, optical properties and PEC performance of plain TiO2, single TiO2/CuInS2 core/shell (CS) and TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS NRs were investigated in detail. The deposition cycles of CuInS2 and Bi2S3 on TiO2 NRs were optimized to enhance the PEC performance of TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS composites electrodes. The results show that TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS obtained enhanced photoconversion efficiency (6 times higher than that of plain TiO2 and 1.5 times than TiO2/CuInS2 CS). Therefore, the construction of CSS nanostructured composites electrodes through coupling single core/shell nanostructures with another narrow gap semiconductor shell suggests a promising design for improving the absorption efficiency and PEC performance of photoelectrodes.
1. Introduction
Single-crystalline TiO2 nanostructures of one dimensional order, including nanorods (NRs), nanotubes (NTs) and nanowires (NWs), are important n-type semiconductor materials that have drawn considerable attention in photocatalysis and solar cells because of their unique optical and electronic characteristics, which accordingly lead to accept and transport electrons to the counter electrodes materials.1–3 Moreover, compared with the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle thin films, single-crystalline TiO2 nanorod arrays provide a direct channel for carrier transmission and can efficiently ensure the separation and collection of photoexcited electrons.4 However, TiO2 is a wide-bandgap semiconductor (Eg = 3.2 eV), which can only absorb the short ultraviolet wavelengths in the solar spectrum, resulting in its high recombination rate of photogenerated electron and hole.5 Researchers have adopted many methods to expand the TiO2 spectral range and improve the energy conversion efficiency such as dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)6,7 and semiconductor sensitized solar cell (SSSC).8,9 Due to the disadvantages of high cost and unstable performances for DSSC, considerable attention has been transferred to the inorganic narrow bandgap semiconductor sensitized solar cells, because the sensitizers enable the production of highly efficient multiple charge carriers, and their optical properties can be tailored by simply changing their size.10
Various narrow bandgap materials, including CdS,11,12 CdSe,13 PbS,14 Bi2S3,15,16 and CuInS2,17 have been synthesized as sensitizers deposited on the wide-bandgap semiconductor by controlling the particle size to improve the absorption. Among these sensitizers, toxicity is a problem worth considering. Compared with CdS and PbS, Bi2S3 (BS) and CuInS2 (CIS) are almost non-toxic materials and both have a high absorption coefficient of α (∼105 cm−1), direct bandgap energy (1.3 eV and 1.51 eV),18–20 which can promote the absorption extending to the visible region and even to the near-infrared light area, exhibiting improved performance in light harvesting. In addition, comparing with TiO2, both Bi2S3 and CuInS2 have a higher conduction band edge,21,22 which can increase the possibility of electron injection from the conduction band of the sensitizers to the one dimensional TiO2. The new nanostructure of two different types of band energy co-sensitization to form core/shell/shell (CSS) have emerged to construct light energy harvesting assemblies.23 The CSS nanostructure not only can achieve extraordinary performance because of the outer shell serves as a potential barrier, which confines the charge carriers in the region, but also can suppress the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and protect the core material from chemical erosion.24,25 To date, although the studies on CSS NRs structure are rare, they would attract more attention because of its excellent PEC performance of CSS NRs structure. Recently, Ai et al. reported a Bi2S3-coated TiO2 core/shell structure by the SILAR method.26 The hetero-structured TiO2/Bi2S3 exhibited an enhanced photocurrent density compared with that of pristine TiO2. Song et al. deposited a uniform PbS nanoparticle on ZnO nanorods turning into core/shell structure, and the power conversion efficiency of ZnO/PbS CEs increased tremendously compared to that with planar Pt and bare PbS CE.27 Guo et al. synthesized TiO2/CIS core/shell nanoarrays via a simple SILAR technique and polyol reduction routes.28 Wang et al. reported a hierarchical double-shell TiO2/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable arrays and obtained the power conversion efficiency of up to 1.33% through optimization of the thickness of the ZnSe layer.3 Han et al. synthesized the ZnO/ZnS/MxS CSS nanorods by a versatile chemical conversion method based on the ion-by-ion growth mechanism, and the hydrogen generation efficiency is up to 15.92%.29
In general, two major methods, ex situ and in situ, have been applied to deposit metal sulfide quantum dots on the substrates.30,31 The ex situ method has been reported with low power conversion efficiency due to the long carbon chain organic ligands existence and low coverage of quantum dots on the electrode surface. The in situ synthesis techniques, such as chemical bath deposition (CBD) and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), are the most widely used methods, which can result in a high surface coverage of QDs on the electrode surfaces.32 In the present study, we fabricated the TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS nanorods by the SILAR method. The Bi2S3 layer was directly covered on the previously coated CuInS2 layer on TiO2 NRs to prevent the polysulfide electrolytes' corrosion of CuInS2. The deposition cycles of CuInS2 and Bi2S3 on TiO2 NRs were optimized to enhance the PEC performance of TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS electrodes. The optical properties and PEC performances of TiO2/CIS single layer core/shell (CS) nanorods were also investigated for comparing with the double layer CSS structure electrode. It is expected to exploit the CSS structure for the potential application of a sensitized solar cell.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanorods
The TiO2 NR arrays were directly grown on a transparent FTO glass using the hydrothermal synthesis method similar to Li's report.33 In the typical synthesis process, the FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned for 30 min in a mixed solution of deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol with volume ratios of 1:1:1 and finally dried under N2 flow. 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5%–38% by weight) under magnetic stirring for 5 min, 0.2 mL titanium tetrachloride was added, and the solution was stirred for another 5 min. Furthermore, the FTO substrates were placed in a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave with the conducting side facing down. The precursor solution was added and the reaction was maintained at 180 °C for 2 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature under flowing water, and the FTO substrates were rinsed with deionized water several times and then dried in ambient air.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2/CIS core/shell nanorods
The TiO2/CIS core–shell NR arrays were prepared via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method similar to the literature.34 Briefly, the TiO2 NR electrodes were successively immersed in three different precursor solutions, containing InCl3·4H2O (5 mM), CuCl2·2H2O (5 mM) and Na2S·9H2O (50 mM), for about 20 s each. After each dipping in the precursor solution, the samples were rinsed in deionized water to remove the extra ions that were not adsorbed. After several cycles, the deposited samples were annealed in the tube furnace at 370 °C for 30 min under nitrogen protection and were labeled as TiO2/CIS(x) core/shell NR, where x refers to the number of CIS SILAR cycles.
2.3 Fabrication of TiO2/CIS/BS CSS nanorods
A four beaker system is used for Bi2S3 nanoparticles coating (refer to the literature).5 First, the TiO2/CIS core/shell nanostructure electrode was immersed in the 2 mM precursor acetone solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O for 60 s. Then, the electrode was rinsed in acetone for 30 s to remove the loosely bound ions. Furthermore, the electrode sample was soaked in the anionic precursor, which contains 0.13 M Na2S·9H2O aqueous solution for 60 s for the adsorption of sulfur ions to react with bismuth ions. After immersing, the sample was rinsed in deionized water for 30 s. Finally, the samples were treated in a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h and were labeled as TiO2/CIS(x)/BS(y), where y refers to the number of Bi2S3 SILAR cycles.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology of the sample was observed by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TF20) and high resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM). The crystal structure of the sample was detected by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2400, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) in the 2θ range of 20°–80° and at a scanning speed of 10° min−1. The chemical composition of the sample was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5702). The optical properties were obtained by a LabTech (China) spectrophotometer within the wavelength range of 200–1000 nm.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC measurements were performed by a standard three-electrode system, which was composed of an electrolytic cell carrying a quartz window linked with the electrochemical workstation (CH instruments, model CHI660d). The TiO2/CIS/BS CSS nanorods electrodes were used as the working electrode, platinum mesh as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The electrolytes were 0.05 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.95 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The illumination source was a xenon lamp, which can produce an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in the sample surface, and the photocurrent of the working electrode was obtained by a bias of from −1.0 V to 0.9 V.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure characterization
Fig. 1a and b show the top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of bare TiO2 nanorods arrays. It can be seen that the TiO2 NRs vertically grow on the FTO substrate and appear as a smooth surface. The individual NR is tetragonal in shape with square top facets, which is consistent with Liu's work.1 The average length of NRs is approximately 1.9 μm and about 110 nm in diameter. Fig. 1c and d show that the surfaces of the TiO2 nanorods become rough after 5 cycles of CIS deposition. The nanoparticles are uniformly arranged on the surface of TiO2 NRs without aggregation. When the TiO2/CIS(5) electrode is immersed in precursor solutions of Bi3+ and S2−, the number of nanoparticles increases significantly (Fig. 1e and f), which implies that the BS nanocrystals deposited on the surface of the CIS layer form a core/shell structure based on the core of TiO2/CIS. Therefore, a double sheath of TiO2/CSS/BS CSS NRs arrays was deposited on the FTO substrate.
 Fig. 1  Top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of the bare TiO2 nanorods array (a) and (b), TiO2/CIS(5) core/shell structure (c) and (d), and TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) CSS structure (e) and (f). The inset show the enlarged view of the corresponding top-view FESEM image. 
Fig. 2a and b show typical TEM and HRTEM images of TiO2/CIS(5) core/shell NRs. It can be seen that the CIS nanoparticles with a size ranging from 5 nm to 8 nm were uniformly covered on the TiO2 nanorods, and the nanoparticles were connected to each other and form into a layered thin film. Distinguishable lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 2b) verified the high crystallinity of the CIS nanoparticles. The distance between lattice fringes is 0.327 nm and 0.305 nm, corresponding to the (112) and (103) planes of chalcopyrite phase CIS [JCPDS file no. 85-1575]. The thickness of the CIS shell increased with increasing SILAR cycles, and the TiO2 NR is decorated by a layer of 10–12 nm film when SILAR cycles of CuInS2 is up to 7 times (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2d and e show TEM and HRTEM images of TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) CSS NRs, respectively. The surfaces of the NRs become rougher than that of TiO2/CIS(5) in Fig. 2a, and the Bi2S3 particles with a size of 5–8 nm continuously arranged outside of the CIS layer. The lattice distances correspond well with the (221) plane of bismuthinite Bi2S3 [JCPDS file no. 06-0333] and (112) plane of chalcopyrite phase CuInS2 [JCPDS file no. 85-1575] (Fig. 2e). The elemental distribution maps (Fig. 2f) carried out across the NR in the white square in Fig. 2d illuminates that the Cu, In, S and Bi elements distribute almost uniformly over the whole TiO2 NR. Consequently, the TiO2/CIS/BS CSS NR arrays can be successfully prepared by the SILAR method.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 NRs, TiO2/CIS core/shell NRs and TiO2/CIS/BS CSS NRs. For TiO2, except the FTO substrate, all the diffraction peaks are consistent with the standard tetragonal rutile phase TiO2 (SG, P42/nm, JCPDS no. 75-1748, a = b = 0.4594 nm and c = 0.2959 nm) (curve a). In curve b, the diffraction peaks located at the diffraction angles of 27.8°, 46.3°, and 55° correspond to the crystal planes (112), (220)/(204) and (312)/(116) of the chalcopyrite phase (JCPDS no. 85-1575, a = b = 0.5523 nm and c = 1.1133 nm). The relatively weak diffraction peaks may be attributed the thin layer of CIS on TiO2 NRs. Moreover, the diffraction peaks at 25.2° and 28.6° can be indexed to the crystal planes of (111) and (230) of bismuthinite Bi2S3 (JCPDS no. 06-0333, a = 1.115 nm, b = 1.13 nm, c = 0.3981 nm) without other impurities (curve c). The XRD results suggest that the CuInS2 and Bi2S3 nanocrystals have been successfully coated on the surfaces of the TiO2 NRs.

To further investigate the valence states of elements and composition in the TiO2/CIS/BS CSS nanorods, XPS analysis was conducted, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the main components of the sample are Ti, O, Cu, In, S, and Bi. The elements' binding energy of high revolution spectrum was revised in reference to the binding energy of C 1s (284.8 eV). Fig. 4a shows the high-resolution spectrum of Ti 2p; the peaks of binding energies at 458.8 eV and 464.8 eV were assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2. These two peaks are separated by 6.0 eV, which indicates Ti4+ existing in rutile phase TiO2.35 The binding energies of O 1s at 529.9 eV and 531.8 eV were attributed to the crystal lattice oxygen (Ti–O) and different types of physically absorbed oxygen (H–O) in the film (Fig. 4b).36 Moreover, the strong and sharp peaks of Ti and O reveal that they exist as chemistry states. The Cu 2p core split into 2p3/2 (932.1 eV) and 2p1/2 (952.1 eV) and can be assigned to Cu(I) according to the literature19 (Fig. 4c). In addition, the binding energy of Cu 2p indicates that CIS was deposited successfully on TiO2 NRs without Cu(II) (942 eV). The binding energies of In 3d are 444.8 eV (In 3d5/2) and 452.4 eV (In 3d3/2), suggesting that In3+ existed in CIS nanocrystals (Fig. 4d).37 The S core binding energy displayed in Fig. 4e contains two peaks. The peaks of binding energy at 161.9 eV and 163.2 eV are assigned to Cu–S and In–S bond structure in CIS, which are not symmetric peaks owing to the responses of Cu–S and In–S, consistent with that of CuInS2.38 The Bi 4f peaks of the sample are located at 158.5 eV (Bi 4f7/2) and 163.8 eV (Bi 4f5/2), which are in agreement with that of Bi2S3 in literature.39 Combined with the XRD analysis, it can be corroborated that the CIS and BS nanoparticles are successfully deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanorods, and there are no obvious impurities existing in the as-obtained TiO2/CIS/BS CSS nanorods.

3.2 Optical and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2/CIS/BS CSS NRs
Fig. 5a gives the UV-vis absorption spectra of TiO2 NRs and TiO2/CIS core/shell NRs with different SILAR cycles of CIS. An increased optical absorption is observed for the TiO2/CIS films compared with that of the plain TiO2 nanorods. The absorption edge of plain TiO2 is only 410 nm, whereas it enlarges to 600–800 nm after CuInS2 deposition, which confirms that CuInS2 can effectively improve the light absorption of the TiO2 nanorods. Moreover, the light absorption intensity was gradually improved with the increase of SILAR cycles of CIS and caused a red shift. The photocurrent response of TiO2 NRs and TiO2/CIS NRs under a 0.2 V bias vs. the SCE reference electrode is shown in Fig. 5b. It can be observed that the plain TiO2 NRs and TiO2/CIS NRs exhibited a stable light current and low dark current under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight, which indicates that the electrodes of plain TiO2 and TiO2/CIS have fewer defects and exhibit excellent crystallinity. Moreover, the photocurrent densities of TiO2/CIS electrodes present the tendency of first increasing then decreasing with increasing CIS SILAR cycles. The maximum current density, about 0.32 mA cm−2, of TiO2/CIS was obtained at the 5 SILAR cycles of CIS. Compared with plain TiO2 NR (0.05 mA cm−2), the obvious improvement of photocurrent density for TiO2/CIS NRs illustrates that the excited electrons of CIS can smoothly inject into the TiO2 conduction band through a one-dimensional TiO2 channel.

Fig. 6 reveals the UV-vis absorption spectra and photocurrent responses of TiO2/CIS(5)/BS CSS NRs. It can be noted that the optical absorption of CSS NRs extends to the near-infrared light region, and the absorption edges enlarge to 800–900 nm with increasing BS SILAR cycles (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the light absorption intensities of TiO2/CIS(5)/BS CSS continuously increased with increasing BS SILAR cycles when compared to the TiO2/CIS single shell. Fig. 6b displays the photocurrent responses of TiO2/CIS(5)/BS CSS NRs with different SILAR cycles of BS. It was found that the photocurrent densities decreased with increasing Bi2S3 SILAR cycles and the TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) CSS NRs holds the highest photocurrent density, about 0.42 mA cm−2. The possible reason is that the increased SILAR cycles of Bi2S3 results in the thicker outer shell, which will increase the internal recombination ratio of the charge carriers, and the thicker outer shell will also restrain the electrolyte from penetrating into it.24 It can also be deduced that the CSS structures are able to show improved photoelectronic performance through adjusting the shell thickness.

Fig. 7 presents the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) Nyquist plots of TiO2 NRs, TiO2/CIS(5) NRs and TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) NRs electrodes, which were investigated in 0.05 M Na2S and 0.95 M Na2SO3 aqueous solutions in dark and under visible light irradiation. Only one circular arc appears in the Nyquist plots, and it reflects the interface impedance between electrode and electrolyte.40 The results suggest that the EIS of TiO2 NRs electrodes in dark and under visible light are almost two straight lines because plain TiO2 has almost no response to visible light. However, the composite electrodes of TiO2/CIS(5) show smaller resistance-circles than plain TiO2 whether in dark or visible light. This can be attributed to the efficient separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pair and the high rate of electron injection between the interfaces of heterojunction and electrolyte for the composite electrodes.41 After the deposition of BS, the resistance-circle of TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) is higher than that of TiO2/CIS(5), which is due to the larger resistance of Bi2S3 itself than CuInS2. The charge transfer resistance in the interface gradually decreases in the following order: TiO2, TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1), TiO2/CIS(5), implying a greater conductivity of TiO2/CIS(5) electrode and a faster charge transfer rate in its surface. Moreover, it can be seen that the resistance for each electrode under visible light is less than that in dark, which indicates that light enables the reduction of the charge transfer resistance in the interface of the electrode/electrolyte.
 Fig. 7  The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) Nyquist plots of TiO2, TiO2/CIS(5) and TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) electrodes in dark and under visible light. 
Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent density versus potential curves with TiO2, TiO2/CIS(5) CS and TiO2/CIS(5)/BS(1) CSS NRs electrodes in dark and under the visible-light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The dark currents of three electrodes are almost close to zero, whereas under visible light, the photocurrent density of each electrode is enhanced with the bias moving in a positive direction. The TiO2/CIS/BS electrode obtains a higher saturated photocurrent density (0.62 mA cm−2) than that of the other electrodes under the bias potential range from −1.0 to 0.9 V. Fig. 8b shows the corresponding photoconversion efficiency (η) of three electrodes according to the following equation:42  where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), E0rev is the standard state-reversible potential, which is 1.23 V (vs. NHE), and the applied potential is Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. SCE) of the working electrode and Eaoc is the open circuit electrode potential (vs. SCE) of the same working electrode under the same illumination and in the same electrolyte. It can be concluded that the construction of CSS structure is an effective way to enhance the photoconversion efficiency so that the maximum photoconversion efficiency of TiO2/CIS/BS CSS electrode is 0.44%, whereas those of the plain TiO2 NRs electrode and TiO2/CIS CS electrode are 0.07% and 0.28%, respectively. Apparently, the photoelectric performance of the TiO2/CIS/BS electrodes has been enhanced significantly by the Bi2S3 layer. This phenomenon can be understood as follows: first, the deposition of the Bi2S3 layer greatly increased the absorbance intensity of the TiO2/CIS/BS electrodes and enlarged the optical absorption area to the near infrared spectrum, which led to an increased photocurrent density. Second, the TiO2/CIS/BS electrodes may have reduced the recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes by possibly forming a band energy cascade structure in the CSS nanostructure (Fig. 9). In this energy gap structure, the TiO2 nanorods and CIS and BS undergo photoexcitation simultaneously through producing electrons and holes in their own conduction and valence bands. Moreover, the excited electrons can transfer through the conduction band from Bi2S3 to CuInS2 then to TiO2, and the excited holes pass in the opposite direction. Due to the cascade structure, the injection ability of excited electrons is enhanced. Moreover, combining with the EIS Nyquist plots in Fig. 7, the efficient separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pair and high rate of electron injection between the interfaces of the heterojunction and electrolyte for the composite electrodes could enhance the photoelectrochemical performance as well. Therefore, the cascade band structure built in the TiO2/CIS/BS electrode is advantageous to electron injection and hole recovery even though the photoelectrons in Bi2S3 transfer to TiO2 through the conductor band of CIS to cause higher resistance for electrons backing to the electrolyte.5

4. Conclusions
In summary, the TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 core/shell/shell (CSS) nanorods (NRs) structured composites electrodes were successfully built by the SILAR method. The deposition cycles of CuInS2 and Bi2S3 on TiO2 NRs have been optimized to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2/CuInS2/Bi2S3 CSS composites electrodes, and the efficiency of the composite electrode is up to 6 times higher than that of plain TiO2 NRs electrode and 1.5 times higher than TiO2/CuInS2 CS NRs electrode. The architecture leads to a stronger light-harvesting ability and creates a higher rate of electron delivery channel when compared to the single shell TiO2/CuInS2 electrodes, which would promote the photoexcited electrons to efficiently transfer to TiO2 from the outer shell of Bi2S3 through the CuInS2 layer. In addition, the TiO2 nanorods provide an exact electron pathway over the large surface area. However, the efficiency of TiO2/CIS/BS CSS is still lower than that of others; the main reason is that the bandgap value difference between CIS and BS is too small. Moreover, searching more appropriate components to improve the PEC performance of the CSS nanostructure remains a further subject of investigation in the succeeding research.
