    , Accepted 24th April 2017First published on 24th April 2017AbstractWe manipulate layer-controllable XL-MoS2 (X = 1, 2, 3, F, where F = 4–6 layers) along the axial direction of vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays on conducting substrates to form a coaxial, ordered and quasi-one-dimensional structure, introducing an electron transport highway and electrolyte diffusion channels to improve electrocatalysis from triiodide to iodide.
Two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te), have intriguing potential applications in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry.1–6 The single- or few-layered MoS2 exhibits amazing properties distinct from those of bulk MoS2, due to its bandgap ranging from an indirect bandgap of 1.3 eV to a direct bandgap of 1.9 eV with decreasing MoS2 thickness to a few layers or a single layer.7 Generally, the optimization of MoS2 catalytic properties depends on regulating its electronic structure. For instance, the electrochemical Li-ion intercalation to MoS2 molecular layers can give a continuous electronic structure and layer spacing, thus tuning the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity.8–10 Besides considering the electronic structure, the orientation of MoS2 layers on the substrate is also an important aspect so that the vertically aligned MoS2 can maximize exposure of active edge sites.11,12 The above two aspects of enhancing the catalytic process can be summarized as follows. (1) Disorder engineering: the disordered structure can provide abundant unsaturated sulfur atoms as active S-edge sites for the HER, due to the cracking of the basal planes by incorporating oxygen13 or the transition metal atoms (Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu).14 From the viewpoint of electronic modulation, heteroatomic incorporation can effectively regulate the bandgap and thus enhance the intrinsic conductivity of the MoS2 catalyst. (2) Orientation on a substrate: there are two kinds of arrangement between MoS2 and substrates, horizontal and vertical to the substrate. The horizontal growth prefers to occur along MoS2 basal planes on the substrate surface to minimize surface energy. The parallel-stacked configuration limits the exposure of the active edge sites and causes a much higher electron resistance between layers. To maximize the exposure of active edge sites, MoS2 films grow standing upright on substrates rather than forming a lying-down nanostructure. The two typical arrangement modes on the substrate are illustrated in Fig. 1a and b.

(b) Vertical stack: few-layered MoS2 vertically aligned on flat substrates. (c) Coaxial cable: a patchwork of layer-controllable few-layered MoS2 nanofragments along the axial surface orientation. 
As is well-known, electron transport and electrolyte diffusion have crucial effects on the electrocatalytic process on electrode surfaces. The coaxial and quasi-one-dimensional configurations of carbon fibers,15 carbon nanotubes,16 titanium nitride nanotubes,17 titanium dioxide nanobelts,18 and organic framework-derived titanium dioxide19 have been investigated in order to use the materials as highly effective electrocatalysts, because the coaxial structure favors fast and controllable electron transport along the long axis. Note that the properties of most two-dimensional materials (MoS2, SnS2, graphene, phosphorene etc.), such as electrocatalytic properties,20 charge transport,21 optical properties,22 vibration,23 workfunction24etc., are closely related to the number of layers. The cracks on a MoS2 nanofilm surface can be considered as effective diffusion channels.25 Herein, we suppose that the long-range coaxial configuration consists of layer-tunable MoS2 nanofragments as a coating and vertically aligned TNAs on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates as a supporting skeleton (Fig. 1c). The basic features of the coaxial structure include the following aspects: (1) the long-range ordered TNAs as a coaxial cable MoS2 carrier can be conducive to electron transport along the axis; (2) the multi-layered MoS2 nanospecies can provide electrolyte diffusion channels and speed up the electron transfer between electrodes and electroactive species. An advantage of our design is that the dense and long axis nanoarrays can be loaded with a large number of FL-MoS2 nanofragments, providing more efficient electron transfer and more channels for liquid electrolyte transport in the electrocatalytic process.
Our approach to the coaxial structure relies on a two-step route of dip-coating/chemical vapor deposition (Fig. S1, ESI†). The ultrathin film with 1 to 6 layers on the surface of the TNAs can be intuitively and clearly observed by TEM imaging (Fig. 2). We can easily obtain the few-layered (4–6) decorated TNAs (TNAs@FL-MoS2) by the above method. Furthermore, the procedure is also suitable for the preparation of single, double and triple layers by washing the precursor of ammonium molybdate-infiltrated TNAs with deionized water before sulfurization, resulting in TNAs@1L-MoS2, TNAs@2L-MoS2, and TNAs@3L-MoS2 washing 3 times, 2 times, and 1 time, respectively. Compared with the pre-deposited Mo film using the sputtering technique7 or e-beam evaporation,26 TNAs were dipped into the aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate and then rinsed 0–3 times with deionized water. The dip-coating process is simpler and more convenient for controlling the number of MoS2 layers. The basal plane-oriented MoS2 nanofragments with the exposed active edge sites were synthesized via rapid sulfurization of the Mo-precursor coating, suggesting the growth of large-scale and high quality MoS2 nanofragments onto the TNAs. The crystalline structures of TNAs@XL-MoS2 (X = 1, 2, 3, F, T) were confirmed from the XRD patterns (Fig. S2, ESI†), in which the characteristic peaks of FTO, TNAs and MoS2 can be seen. The morphology and element mapping of TNAs@FL-MoS2 are given to confirm the chemical construction and appearance characteristics (Fig. S3, ESI†). The mass percent of MoS2:TiO2 was estimated to be 26.5% according to EDS analysis (Table S1, ESI†). Furthermore, XPS was also used to examine the chemical nature and bonding state of TNAs@FL-MoS2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Before and after coating, the orientation and number of TNAs with an average diameter of ∼80 nm and length of ∼800 nm remained the same, indicating that there were approximately 60 TNAs@FL-MoS2 cells vertically aligned on the FTO substrate within one square micron. Furthermore, the number of MoS2 layers was estimated by Raman spectroscopy accurately up to seven layers.27 Raman spectra of the single, double, triple and few (4–6) layers show two characteristic peaks located around 378.6 and 403.6 cm−1, which are assigned to the E12g and A1g mode of MoS2, besides the rutile TiO2 Raman response of the two-phonon scattering (251.0 cm−1), Eg (457.4 cm−1), and A1g (620.2 cm−1) modes. The peak differences of the various MoS2 layers were 19.1, 22.2, 23.2 and 25.0 cm−1, respectively, and the layer-dependent Raman shift is indicated by the arrow lines (Fig. 3). To evaluate the effect of layers and order degree on the electrocatalytic properties, the thick-layered MoS2 covering TNAs (TNAs@TL-MoS2) was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The thick-layered (6–12 layers) and disordered MoS2 film covers the TNA surface (Fig. S5, ESI†).

TNAs@FL-MoS2 decorated on a FTO substrate can be expected to be a highly efficient counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), superior to those based on MoS2 in previous reports.28–32 We explore the performance of a DSSC based on different MoS2 layers decorated on TNAs/FTO as a CE. The cyclic voltammograms of the above CEs in iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) liquid electrolyte are compared with that of a Pt CE (Fig. S6, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that TNAs@FL-MoS2 and Pt CEs have a similar reduction potential and separation of redox peak potentials, suggesting that the redox reaction rate of TNAs@FL-MoS2 was very close to that of Pt. Moreover, the TNAs@FL-MoS2 CE shows a higher current density of 3.5 mA cm−2 at the I3− reduction peak than that of the Pt CE (2.6 mA cm−2). The reduction peak current increased on increasing the number of MoS2 layers. No peaks appeared on the bare TNAs. The result indicates that FL-MoS2 had enough multilayer space to fully accommodate the liquid electrolytes. In other words, the partial cracking of the 4–6-layered MoS2 film can not only lead to exposure of additional active edge sites, but also provides a convenient channel for electrolyte diffusion. Too few layers can cause a lack of active sites, such as in TNAs@1L-, 2L- and 3L-MoS2. The ordinary structure of thin (>6) layers will cover the top and side of the TNAs without the advantage of a coaxial structure for electron transport, resulting in the reduction peak current density of 1.9 mA cm−2. Compared with the few-layered MoS2, the electrocatalytic activity of the thin-, triple-, double- and single-layered MoS2 became lower. EIS curves can offer more impedance information about the interfacial electron transfer (Fig. S7, ESI†). In particular, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and series resistance (Rs) are closely related to the catalytic activity of the reduction of I3− to I− and the contact resistance between electrocatalysts and substrates, respectively, as listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The Rs change is very small in the range of 4.21 to 4.84 Ω cm2, indicating the firm bonding between the active layer and the substrate. The Rct(TNAs@FL-MoS2) value of 10.09 Ω cm2 is close to the Rct(Pt) value of 6.75 Ω cm2, suggesting that a lower Rct helps achieve a higher electrocatalytic activity at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The photovoltaic performance from the I–V curves (Fig. 4) of DSSCs based on different CEs, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η), is summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The one-dimensional skeleton of the TNAs can support MoS2 nanospecies, but it can not act as a catalyst for the reduction reaction due to the inefficient DSSC assembled by the TNAs (η = 0.04%). The efficiency of the TNAs@FL-MoS2-DSSC (7.16%) was comparable to that of the Pt-DSSC (7.17%), which was much higher than that of the device with the other different MoS2 layers.

I–V curves of DSSCs based on Pt, TNAs, and TNAs@XL-MoS2 (X = 1, 2, 3, F, T) counter electrodes. 
We also investigated the stability performance based on TNAs@FL-MoS2 CEs (Fig. S8, ESI†). The monitoring performance data are presented in Table S4 (ESI†), indicating the excellent stability of the device. Additionally, the ordered and quasi-one-dimensional TNAs@FL-MoS2 has compared very favorably with other MoS2-based structures as mentioned previously (Table S5, ESI†). The convenient electron and diffusion channels help to achieve a high conversion efficiency of DSSCs due to enough regeneration of I− ions from I3− reduction.
In summary, we present a new concept for the design and preparation of a coaxial structure to increase electrolyte diffusion channels, enhance electron transport, and expose additional active edge sites. The few (4–6), triple, double and single layers of MoS2 can be conveniently controlled by washing 0–3 times with deionized water. For the electrocatalytic reduction from I3− to I− on the electrode surface, TNAs@FL-MoS2 can replace Pt as a catalyst for a low-cost and high performance DSSC. We have no doubt that the coaxial heterostructure of layer-controlled active films will be widely used to integrate a series of photoelectrochemical devices.
