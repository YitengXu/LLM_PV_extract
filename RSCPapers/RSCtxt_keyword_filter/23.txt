    , Accepted 11th January 2020First published on 13th January 2020AbstractInorganic CsPbI2Br halide perovskite has received extensive attention due to its excellent thermal stability and suitable bandgap for high-performance solar cells. However, CsPbI2Br can easily transform from the perovskite phase to the non-perovskite phase due to a water vapour-induced phase transition under ambient conditions, leading to a rapid degradation of device performance. Herein, we introduced lanthanum (La3+) ions into the lattice to stabilize the perovskite phase in CsPbI2Br-based all-inorganic solar cells. A power conversion efficiency of 8.03% was obtained at an optimized La3+-doping level of 2%, leading to a 27% efficiency improvement. Moreover, the La3+-doped solar cell retained 90% of its efficiency in ambient air for 400 h, showing a significantly enhanced moisture stability compared to that of the pristine (undoped) device. Detailed analysis indicates that La3+-ions can induce lattice shrinking and thus inhibit the formation of a non-perovskite phase, and enhance the charge carrier lifetime, which contribute to the improved moisture stability and efficiency. Our results indicate that highly stable all-inorganic solar cells can be produced in an air atmosphere, showing great potential for future commercialization.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have advanced rapidly in the past ten years with an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) boost from an initial 3.8% to the current 25.2%.1,2 However, the realization of long-term moisture- and temperature-resistive PSCs remains limited, which hinders their large-scale commercialization.3–6 All-inorganic PSCs can solve the high-temperature stability issue by replacing the organic cations in hybrid perovskites with inorganic cations, for example, CsPbX3 (X = I, Br and Cl).7–11 CsPbBr3 has excellent long-term moisture and high-temperature stability, but it can only absorb light with wavelengths below 550 nm due to its large bandgap of 2.3 eV, limiting the realization of a high PCE.12 Perovskite-phase CsPbI3 has a narrow bandgap of 1.73 eV that lies within the suitable bandgap region for high-efficiency solar cells, but it shows an undesirable phase transition from the perovskite phase to a thermodynamically stable non-perovskite phase at room temperature, and this process can be facilitated by moisture under ambient conditions.13–16 The temperature- and moisture-related phase instability may be due to the fact that the iodide-ion radius is slightly larger than that of the bromide ion, which makes it difficult for the caesium ions to accommodate the PbI6 octahedra.17 Therefore, the mixed-halide perovskite CsPbI3−xBrx (x = 0–3) in which some of the I− ions are replaced with Br− ions is regarded as a compromise to ensure both a suitable bandgap and phase stability.13,18 CsPbI2Br has a bandgap of 1.91 eV with a highest PCE of approximately 16% for a regular n–i–p configuration and 10% for carbon-based hole transport material (HTM)-free all-inorganic solar cells.13,19–21 It is a good candidate for the commercialization of PSCs, but its phase stability in ambient air still needs improvement.22
Component engineering of the perovskite active layer is an effective way to improve thin film quality and thermal and moisture stability. It has been reported that Nb5+, In3+ and Ge2+ ions can act as B-site dopants to enhance the stability of the perovskite phase (α-CsPbI2Br phase).23–25 Specifically, Nb5+ doping substitutes the Pb2+ position, which stabilizes the CsPbI2Br perovskite phase. It thereby improves the stability of PSCs; meanwhile, it reduces the charge recombination in the perovskite and finally increases the voltage value.23 InCl3 can also be incorporated into the perovskite lattice, which helps to inhibit the formation of the non-perovskite phase (δ-phase), and improves the overall space symmetry by forming a closely packed atom arrangement.24 The introduction of Ge2+ ions also improves the stability of the cubic perovskite phase, so that the preparation process can be performed in air.25 Recently, rare-earth elements have begun to be applied to the field of PSCs and reconstruction of the perovskite crystal lattice has become a new way to further improve the stability of narrow-bandgap PSCs.26–29 For example, Eu3+ has been widely reported as an additive for the perovskite absorber layer. The introduction of Eu ions not only stabilizes the perovskite phase at room temperature,27,28 but they can also act as a Eu3+–Eu2+ ion pair to oxidize Pb0 and reduce I0 to significantly enhance the perovskite stability.29 However, the influence of doping other rare-earth elements on the stability of the perovskite layer has not been reported, especially under humid conditions.
In this work, we chose a common lanthanum (La3+) ion and controlled the concentration of doping in a CsPbI2Br precursor solution to improve the perovskite phase stability and device performance. It was found that the solar cell efficiency reached a maximum of 8.03% after doping with 2% La3+-ions compared to an efficiency of 6.31% for the pristine device. Moreover, the stability after 2% La3+-doping also showed a significant improvement; the device maintained 90% of its initial efficiency after 400 h in air. Subsequent synchrotron-based grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements indicate that the La3+-doping shrinks the perovskite lattice and inhibits the transition from the perovskite to non-perovskite phase. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization shows that the grain size decreases after La3+-doping and that the surface coverage is improved by reducing the number of pinholes due to the presence of water vapour. Optical characterizations indicate that La3+-doping prolongs charge carrier lifetime, reduces non-radiative recombination and enhances light absorption. Finally, as all device preparation procedures were carried out in an ambient atmosphere of 20–30% relative humidity (RH), such a HTM-free and carbon-based all-inorganic PSC structure shows great potential for large-scale low-cost production.
Experimental
Materials
Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%), caesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%) and lanthanum chloride (LaCl3, 99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
All procedures were carried out at approximately 20–30% RH at room temperature and in ambient air. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and alcohol under sonication, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was prepared on an FTO substrate by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 20 s and then sintering for 30 min at 500 °C. The mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) film was then deposited by spin-coating diluted TiO2 paste (Greatcell Solar, 30 NR-D with an average particle size of 30 nm) at 4000 rpm for 20 s and annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min. The 0.8 M CsPbI2Br precursor was prepared by mixing CsI, PbBr2 and PbI2 with a molar ratio of 2:1:1 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 7:3). Afterwards, the solution was stirred at 70 °C overnight to form a clear mixture. To obtain the CsPb1−xLaxI2Br (x = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03) perovskite precursors, 1 M LaCl3 in DMF and DMSO (volume ratio: 4:1) was added into the CsPbI2Br precursor solution in the corresponding proportions. Then, 50 μl of precursor solution was spin-coated onto the m-TiO2 layer at 2500 rpm for 40 s; subsequently, the thin film was first annealed at 50 °C for 60 s and then at 260 °C for 10 min. Finally, commercial carbon paste was painted onto the perovskite layer by the doctor-blade method followed by heating at 100 °C for 10 min to form the carbon electrode.
Characterization
The GIXRD measurements were performed at the BL14B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using X-rays with a wavelength of 1.24 Å. 2D-GIXRD spectra were acquired by a vertical MarCCD with a sample distance of ∼361 mm, exposure time of 10 s and grazing incidence angle of 0.3°. The in situ GIXRD characterization was performed by controlling the exposure time for the thin film samples in air (55% RH, 25 °C). The 2D-GIXRD spectra were analysed using FIT2D software and displayed using scattering vector q coordinates. Surface morphology and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy mapping were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (NOVA NANOSEM 450). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument. The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured using a SHIMADZU UV-3600 spectrophotometer over a wavelength range between 400 and 800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were measured using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 steady-state/transient fluorescence spectrometer. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) measurements were performed using our home-built TAS setup. The frequency-doubled 520 nm output from a Spectra Physics Spirit laser (350 fs, 1 kHz, and 40 μJ per pulse) is used for the pump beam, while a fraction is used for WLC generation using a sapphire crystal. The pump beam is chopped at 500 Hz, and the WLC probe signals are collected using an ultrafast fiber optic spectrometer. The time window of transient absorption measurement is 2 ns. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve for the perovskite solar cells was measured using a solar simulator (ORIEL, Sol3A, Newport) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination (scan rate of 200 mV s−1). Photovoltaic measurements for devices were carried out in ambient air (20–30% RH, and 25 °C). The active area is 0.09 cm2 defined by a black metal mask.
Results and discussion
To understand the modification of CsPbI2Br perovskite after La3+-ion doping, we first studied the evolution of the crystal structure. Synchrotron-based GIXRD measurements for the CsPb1−xLaxI2Br (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) thin films were carried out at the diffraction beamline (BL14B1) of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). As shown in Fig. 1a, all the GIXRD spectra showed three main peaks at 10.223 nm−1, 14.415 nm−1 and 20.427 nm−1. The Q-space coordinates were converted to 2-theta by the formula q = 4πsinθ/λ. The diffraction peaks were calculated to be at 2-theta values of 14.410°, 20.374° and 29.029° (λ = 1.5418 Å), respectively, corresponding to the (100), (110) and (200) crystal planes.30,31 No PbX2 (X = I or Br) or other impurity phase appeared, indicating that La3+-ion doping did not change the perovskite phase. It is noted that traces of (002) and (012) planes for the CsPbI2Br non-perovskite phase were found in the diffraction pattern for the pristine CsPbI2Br but they did not appear in the patterns for the La3+-doped samples, indicating that the formation of the non-perovskite phase is inhibited after doping. Fig. 1b and c shows the magnified GIXRD patterns for the (100) plane and the evolution of the corresponding lattice constant; a maximum peak shift and minimum lattice constant (6.121 Å) at x = 0.02 are observed, which result from shrinkage of the perovskite crystal lattice due to the smaller La3+ (1.032 Å) partially substituting for the larger Pb2+ (1.190 Å). The shrinkage of the lattice volume may be beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite phase.32 However, when the doping concentration is 0.03 M (x = 0.03), the peak of the (100) plane is broadened and weakened and shifts to a lower angle. This corresponds to the lattice constant expansion to 6.174 Å, which is even larger than that found in the pristine CsPbI2Br (6.146 Å), indicating that excess La3+ destroys the perovskite crystal lattice.33 The detailed parameters of the (100) peak lattice constant are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1d shows a schematic representation of the host CsPbI2Br lattice after partial La3+-ion substitution of Pb2+ ions. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the EDX mapping images of the CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br thin films illustrate that the elements are uniformly distributed in the perovskite films.

The effect of La3+-ions on the structure of the perovskite is derived from the lattice volume change and redistributed electron density.34 XPS characterization was performed to study the chemical interactions between ions. We calibrated each peak based on C 1s (284.6 eV). The XPS spectra of La 3d can be detected (see Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating the existence of La3+-ions. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), it is obvious that the XPS peaks of Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d are shifted to higher binding energies, indicating that La3+ was successfully incorporated into the host perovskite lattice.35–37 In detail, the radius of La3+-ions is smaller than that of Pb2+ ions, leading to the volume contraction of BX6 (B = Pb or La; X = I or Br) octahedra and the binding energy shift.38 When an excess amount of La3+ is introduced, La has a stronger bonding interaction with halide than Pb, which results in an increase in the electron density around Pb2+ due to the lower electron contribution from Pb to Br or I, so the BX6 octahedral volume expands further. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the peak of Pb 4f with 3% La3+-doping is shifted to a lower binding energy position compared to that of undoped CsPbI2Br, which is opposite to the peak shift to a higher binding energy with 2% La3+-doping.34 It is worth noting that the intrinsic point defects within halide perovskite are nearly all shallow acceptors or donors other than the deep defect levels (recombination centers), as demonstrated by first-principles computation.39,40 Compared with the pristine Pb2+ ions, the introduction of heterovalent La3+-ions leads to charge imbalance, so extra halide ions are needed as compensation.18,34 It has been reported that Br− and strong metallic cations such as Al3+ can accumulate on the surface or grain boundaries of the perovskite film.34,41,42 Similarly, we believe that most La3+-ions could enter the host perovskite lattice, while redundant La3+-ions play a role of defect passivation at the perovskite boundary or surface and improve the optoelectronic properties of La3+-doped CsPbI2Br thin films.43,44
The evolution of diffraction peaks of the perovskite film in an ambient environment with a relatively high humidity (55% RH, 25 °C) was recorded by in situ GIXRD measurement to check the moisture stability before and after doping. Fig. 2a and c shows the 2D-GIXRD data for the fresh CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br films, while Fig. 2b and d shows the data for the two films placed in 55% RH air for 20 min and 40 min, respectively. It is found that the diffraction rings of the perovskite phase disappeared at 20 min, leaving only the diffraction rings of the non-perovskite phase, while for the La3+-doped CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film, we can still observe the (100), (110) and (200) perovskite diffraction rings at 40 min with the presence of only a weak set of rings for the non-perovskite phase. More detailed in situ phase evolutions of the thin films were shown by the 1D-GIXRD patterns (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The pristine CsPbI2Br film showed traces of non-perovskite phase peaks at 0 min and 10 min, and the perovskite phase peaks almost disappeared at 20 min, leaving only the non-perovskite phase. In contrast, the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film showed only weak non-perovskite phase peaks at 20 min, and still maintained the majority perovskite phase at 40 min. The above information indicates that La3+-doping significantly inhibits the transition of the perovskite phase to the non-perovskite phase and improves the moisture stability of the film, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. The metastable perovskite phase without doping exhibits poor stability under humid conditions and it can be easily transformed to the non-perovskite phase. After doping with an appropriate concentration of La3+-ions, the shrinkage of the lattice volume greatly enhances the phase stability, and the perovskite phase is maintained in a moisture environment.

(e) Schematic diagram of the pristine CsPbI2Br and La3+-doped CsPb1−xLaxI2Br perovskite phase stability in a moisture environment. 
Furthermore, the change in the colour appearance and surface morphology of the perovskite films in air moisture was also observed. As shown in Fig. 3a, we deposited CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br films on m-TiO2 and stored them under 55% RH for accelerated ageing measurements. The CsPbI2Br film almost completely turns into a yellow colour within 30 min, but the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film still maintains a brown perovskite phase colour over a large area. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the SEM images of the newly prepared CsPb1−xLaxI2Br perovskite films. It can be found that the pristine CsPbI2Br film has a good surface morphology; however, obvious surface pinholes formed in the films after La3+-doping. Surprisingly, after storage in 20% RH air for 20 h, the moisture induces opposite changes in the surface morphology of films with or without doping, as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(e). The morphology of the pristine CsPbI2Br film changed to an island shape, resulting in a poor surface coverage. The coverage of the 1% La3+-doped film is improved, but still a lot of holes exist. For the perovskite films doped with 2% and 3% La3+, the grain size is significantly reduced, showing a compact film morphology with full surface coverage. The above phenomena indicate the following: (1) the moisture stability of the film after La3+-doping is indeed improved, stabilizing it in the perovskite phase; (2) a low-humidity air environment is beneficial for improving the film morphology if it is phase stable. Yang et al. have also reported that a small amount of water can enter the perovskite bulk to promote grain boundary movement and make the crystals coincide.45

Optical characterizations of the La3+-doped mixed-halide perovskites were also carried out. Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis absorbance and PL spectra for the pristine and the La3+-doped perovskite films. In the UV-vis measurement, the thickness of the perovskite films was carefully controlled to be the same. The absorbance of the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film is greater than that of the CsPbI2Br film; meanwhile, the film also shows the highest absorbance among all doping concentrations (see Fig. S7a, ESI†). This phenomenon is due to the increased film surface coverage after doping/moisture effect. The optical bandgap Eg was estimated from the Tauc plots, as shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. S7b (ESI†). The results indicate that the bandgap becomes slightly larger as the La3+-doping concentration increases. For example, the calculated bandgap for the pristine CsPbI2Br is 1.906 eV, while the bandgap for CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br is slightly increased to 1.919 eV. The normalized PL peaks show a gradual blueshift with increasing concentrations of La3+-doping and the emission peaks are narrowed after doping (Fig. 4a and Fig. S7c, ESI†). The blueshift phenomenon observed in the PL spectra is consistent with the above bandgap change after La3+-doping.46 TRPL decay measurements were used to characterize the carrier lifetime in perovskite films with various La3+-doping concentrations, as shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. S7d, and Table S2 (ESI†). The decay curves were fitted using a biexponential function,47 and the average carrier lifetime (τave) for CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br was calculated to be 20.57 ns and 48.73 ns, respectively. The carrier lifetime at 2% La3+-doping was twice that of the pristine thin film, indicating that the film defects are greatly passivated after La3+-doping, which reduces the non-radiative recombination.48 However, with a further increase of La3+-doping concentration to 3%, the carrier lifetime is sharply reduced, which may be due to the introduction of defects by excess La3+-ions.

(f) Normalized bleaching kinetics probed at 1.97 ± 0.01 eV. The inset is the original relaxation kinetics of the GSB probed at 1.97 ± 0.01 eV. 
The photocarrier dynamics were further studied by using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Fig. 4d and e show a false color two-dimensional TA mapping of CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br thin films after excitation at 2.38 eV obtained at a fluence of 177 μJ cm−2. The high-order carrier recombination processes, such as exciton–exciton annihilation, are avoided under low density excitation conditions (see Fig. S8, ESI†).49 The broad negative feature centered at 1.97 eV commonly results from the ground-state bleach (GSB), which is well consistent with the absorption edge present in the linear absorption spectrum that is assigned to excitonic transition. The positive differential absorption signal between 1.84 and 1.94 eV around 1 ps is assigned to the newly created optical transitions due to bandgap renormalization. The high-energy tail above 2.03 eV, which exhibits a subpicosecond lifetime, can be caused by a population of hot carriers.50,51 By probing at the GSB peak, the TA delay kinetics were investigated following three exponential function fitting analyses, as shown in Fig. 4f. The first process is thermalization of photocarriers, which then relax to the bottom of the conduction and valence bands. Then, the second process is charge carrier trapping at defect sites such as perovskite film grain boundaries.52,53 The final process is the radiation recombination of electrons and holes. Under the light excitation of the same intensity, there are more hot carriers in CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br than in CsPbI2Br that lead to a stronger “hot-phonon bottleneck” effect, even a carrier-screening effect,51,54 which makes the lifetime of relaxation of hot carriers to the bottom of the conduction band longer. Since the defect states of the perovskite film were passivated by La3+-doping, the lifetime τ2 of the process of defect-assisted nonradiative recombination and the lifetime τ3 of radiative recombination are longer (see Table S3, ESI†).55 Therefore, the enhanced radiation recombination makes the steady-state fluorescence intensity of CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br stronger than that of CsPbI2Br.

Fig. 5a and b shows the structure of the carbon-based all-inorganic PSCs with a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/carbon configuration, wherein c/m-TiO2 (∼300 nm thick) acts as an electron-transport layer (ETL); CsPb1−xLaxI2Br is an active layer (∼250 nm thick) that absorbs light energy and converts it into hole–electron pairs; the carbon electrode is an anode in the PSCs. This structure eliminates the use of expensive organic-HTMs to form a promising HTM-free all-inorganic PSC structure.56 Perovskite films with various La3+-doping levels were used as the active layers of the PSCs to evaluate the photovoltaic performances. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding performance parameters are shown in Table S5 (ESI†). The J–V curves of PSCs at other doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The PCE of a pristine CsPbI2Br-based PSC was found to be 6.31%. With increasing La3+-doping concentrations, the PCE reached the highest value of 8.03% for 2% La3+-doped CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.66 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 61.24%, reaching a 27% PCE improvement as compared with the pristine device. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows forward and reverse scan J–V curves for a CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSC, indicating that the La3+-doped PSC device still shows a hysteresis behaviour. Fig. 5d–g shows the statistical distribution of the performance parameters for CsPbI2Br and CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSCs after a period of storage in air. The 2% La3+-doped PSCs have a narrower distribution of PCEs with respect to the reference group, indicating their excellent reproducibility.

The Voc of the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based device increased significantly from 0.98 V to 1.12 V compared with the pristine device. The significant increase in voltage can be related to the following reasons: first, the introduction of 2% La3+-ions extends the carrier lifetime, and photogenerated electrons tend to accumulate in the perovskite film, which causes the Fermi level to shift to a negative potential, thereby increasing the theoretical voltage value.57 Secondly, the passivation of surface defects could reduce non-radiative recombination and also increase the photovoltage.58 Moreover, the FF for the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based device was also improved compared with the pristine CsPbI2Br devices, resulting from the full surface coverage of the film by La3+. However, the excess La3+-doping with concentrations above 3% can lead to a significant drop in the final PCE output due to the destruction of the perovskite lattice and severe recombination.59
We then studied the stability of working devices under 20–30% RH air conditions (see Fig. 5h). The PCE for the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based device increased significantly within the first 50 h and retained 90% of the initial value after 400 h storage in air. For comparison, the PCE for the pristine CsPbI2Br-based device increased only slightly at the initial stage and decreased to 20% of the initial value within 50 h under the same condition. The above results indicate that La3+-doping can greatly improve the stability of PSCs in air. This is consistent with the enhancement in stability of the perovskite film after La3+-doping, as described above, mainly due to the shrinkage of the perovskite lattice. One interesting phenomenon is that the PCE of the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based device increased significantly at the initial stage in the presence of moisture, while a PCE increase of the pristine device is not obvious. This phenomenon can be attributed to the effect of water vapor on the perovskite layer in PSC devices. For the La3+-doped film, the fusion of the grain boundaries and the improvement of the surface coverage induced by moisture contribute to the PCE enhancement. In contrast, since the stability of the CsPbI2Br film is far behind that of the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film, the thin films changed from the perovskite phase to the non-perovskite phase triggered by moisture within a very short period, and the surface coverage of the pristine CsPbI2Br film was also greatly reduced. In other words, the damage of the CsPbI2Br film due to moisture is much greater than the favourable side. The J–V curves and photovoltaic performance parameters of freshly prepared PSCs with different La3+-doping concentrations are also shown in Fig. S11 and Table S4 (ESI†). The PCE of the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSCs (5.43%) is slightly lower than that of the undoped one (5.92%), which can be attributed to the existence of pinholes on the surface of the newly prepared CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film (see Fig. S6, ESI†). However, after storage in humid air for a period of time, the efficiency of the 2% La3+-doped PSCs was significantly improved compared to that of the undoped PSCs (See Table S5, ESI†). Notably, the fill factor of the newly prepared CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSCs is only 46.94%, but it rises to 61.24% after being stored in air while the fill factor of the undoped PSCs hardly changed. The reason behind these phenomena is that water vapor can promote the surface coverage of the 2% La3+-doped films, but it has a certain destructive effect on the undoped CsPbI2Br films.60
Conclusions
In summary, CsPb1−xLaxI2Br (x = 0–0.03) perovskite films with various La3+-doping concentrations were successfully prepared in ambient air at 20–30% RH. GIXRD measurements confirmed that La3+-doping caused shrinkage of the perovskite lattice and inhibited the appearance of a non-perovskite phase, which greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite against moisture. Moreover, unlike the pristine film for which a humid environment was found to damage the film surface coverage, the moisture can promote grain boundary fusion, reduce the number of pinholes and improve the surface coverage of the La3+-doped perovskite films. Detailed optical characterizations indicated that the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br film with 2% La3+-doping showed enhanced light absorption, passivated defects and reduced non-radiative recombination, leading to a high PCE of 8.03% for the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSC, which was 27% higher than that obtained for the pristine device. Moreover, the CsPb0.98La0.02I2Br-based PSC device maintained 90% of the initial PCE in air (20–30% RH and 25 °C) for 400 h, showing greatly enhanced moisture stability as compared with the pristine device. This research provides a new way for the preparation of stable and highly efficient all-inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs in ambient air.
