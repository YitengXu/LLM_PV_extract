    , Accepted 19th November 2012First published on 4th December 2012AbstractWe demonstrate that a carbon-bridged phenylenevinylene (CPV)-linked dye serves as a novel and efficient sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells. The cells show IPCE values of greater than 90%, PCEs of up to 7.12%, and high open circuit voltages reaching close to 0.8 V based on the iodide/triiodide electrolyte.
Although ruthenium-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11–12%,2 there has been rapidly growing interest in the use of metal-free organic dyes as an alternative that circumvents the potential cost and toxicity problems of the metal-based devices. These organic sensitizers typically consist of an electron donor (D) and an acceptor (A) connected by a π-conjugated organic linker group and offer wide possibilities for structural modification. We have been interested in the creation of new planar π-conjugated systems,3inter alia, carbon-bridged phenylenevinylene (CPV) compounds4 that are unique in several respects among popular systems based on thiophene5 and phenylenevinylene (PV) units.6 We report here a new class of DSSC dyes based on the shortest CPV (Dye-1 to Dye-3, Fig. 1), with which we obtained 22% to 43% higher PCEs than when using an equivalent PV linker (Ref-1 to Ref-3), and achieved a very promising PCE value of 7.12% for Dye-3. Importantly, Dye-3 exhibits a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of close to 0.8 V, an outstanding value for organic dyes used in conjunction with iodide/triiodide-based7 electrolytes. Using a Co(II/III)(bipy)3-based electrolyte, an even higher Voc value of 0.9 V was obtained without making substantial sacrifices in the photocurrent, increasing the PCE to 7.54%. The structural features of the new linker include the planarity and rigidity of the π-conjugated system8 and the bulky 4-octylphenyl groups, both of which will contribute to increasing the DSSC performance. The former enhances the electronic communication9 between the D and A units, and the latter allows the polar molecules to stand upright on the TiO2 surface while being separated from each other (Fig. 2b). The molecular dipole can most efficiently shift the conduction band position at the TiO2 when the dipole is perpendicular to the surface,10 and Dye-3, which has the largest dipole moment among the three dyes tested and hence should cause the largest upward band edge displacement.

We synthesized three dyes that feature the CPV linker connecting the standard cyanoacrylic acid acceptor and an archetypal donor, the diphenylamino group (Dye-1), di-p-tolylamino group (Dye-2) and di-p-anisylamino group (Dye-3). The synthesis (Scheme S1, ESI†) starts with desymmetrization of a tetracyclic dibromide prepared by the previously reported route11 followed by palladium-catalyzed amination.12 The Knoevenagel reaction with cyanoacetic acid furnished dyes in good overall yield as dark-red solids.
The physical properties of the new dyes are listed in Table 1. The absorption maximum of Dye-1 is longer in wavelength by 22 nm than that of Ref-1 in THF,6b and the absorption coefficient of 4.07 × 104 L mol−1 cm is larger than that of Ref-1 (2.69 × 104 L mol−1 cm). Among the new dyes, Dye-3 absorbs at the longest wavelength (λmaxabs = 510 nm) and its optical band gap is 2.04 eV. The fluorescence quantum yield of Dye-3 is very low (1.8%), which will contribute to minimizing the loss of excitation energy by the radiative process. The cyclic voltammograms of Dye-1 to Dye-3 were recorded in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate with a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate and calibrated against ferrocene. Dye-3 showed two reversible oxidation waves at 0.17 V (0.80 V vs. NHE) and 0.81 V (1.44 V vs. NHE), which were assigned to the oxidation of the amino group and the CPV bridge, respectively. The first oxidation wave was shifted toward a negative potential from 0.35 V (Dye-1) to 0.17 V (Dye-3), which agrees with the higher electron-donating ability of the donor in Dye-3.

The energy level diagram constructed based on these measurements is presented in Fig. 2a. The oxidation potential of Dye-3 is more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple by 0.4 V, which secures efficient dye regeneration in the DSSC device. The molecular structure of Dye-3 was optimized using B3LYP/6-31G** calculations, and the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were found to be located over the CPV bridge. Note that the CPV skeleton inhibits the photoinduced trans/cis isomerization around the olefinic bond that would result in the loss of the excitation energy, and that the planarity guarantees efficient electronic coupling through the sensitizer molecule. Upon photoexcitation, the electron will be transferred from the diarylamino unit to the cyanoacrylic acid and further to the conduction band of crystalline TiO2, resulting in efficient charge separation.
DSSC experiments revealed an enhanced performance of the cells using CPV-based dyes (hereinafter CPV cells) compared with that using PV reference dyes (PV cells). The PCE of the device using Dye-3 was found to be one of the highest among the reported PV-type organic dyes.6Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic performance of the D–π–A dyes endowed with a CPV π-conducting group. Fig. 3a presents the photocurrent action spectra for the three sensitizers showing the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of excitation wavelength. The IPCE values are high for all dyes, especially with Dye-3 between 475 nm and 565 nm where it exceeds 90%, which may be ascribed partly to the stronger absorbance of this dye. Fig. 3b is a plot of the photocurrent density (J) as a function of voltage (V) for the three sensitizers. Both the Voc and the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) values increase as the electron-donating ability of the donor part increases in order from Dye-1 to Dye-3.

(b) Photocurrent density (J) as a function of voltage (V) for the three sensitizers measured under standard air mass 1.5 and simulated sunlight at 1000 W m−2 intensity. 
As a result of the increase in Voc and Jsc (Table 2), the PCE values increased progressively from 5.51% (Dye-1), to 6.18% (Dye-2) and to 7.12% (Dye-3), which are 22%, 36% and 43% higher than those obtained for the PV cells. PV cells, in contrast, are rather insensitive to the nature of the donor (4.51%, 4.55% and 4.98% for Ref-1, Ref-2 and Ref-3, respectively).6bDye-3 gave the highest Jsc value of 11.60 mA cm−2, whereas Dye-1 and Dye-2 afforded 9.84 mA cm−2 and 10.78 mA cm−2, respectively. This order is in good agreement with that of the absorption maxima (see ESI†).

The Voc values for Dye-1, -2 and -3 systematically increased from 0.745 V (Dye-1), to 0.778 (Dye-2) and to 0.791 (Dye-3), while this is not the case for the reference dyes. As a result, the Voc value for Dye-3 is higher than that for Ref-3 by 0.11 V. The Voc value of 0.791 V is remarkably high, given the fact that it is limited by the difference between the oxidation potential of iodide/triiodide and the Fermi level of TiO2, which is approximately 0.9 V. In addition, the fill factor (ff) of the cells with Dye-1 to Dye-3 changes from 0.742, to 0.741 and to 0.763, respectively, values that are much higher than those of 0.68 to 0.70 for the PV cells (Table 2).
The systematic increase in the Voc value with the molecular dipole moment indicates a shift of the electron Fermi level in the TiO2.13 This could be caused either by a reduction of the interfacial charge recombination rate or a displacement of the conduction band edge towards the vacuum level. The dipole moments of the sensitizer molecules covering the mesoscopic TiO2 film affect the surface potential and hence the conduction band edge position.14 For the CPV sensitizers the dipole is oriented with the negative side attached to the surface and the positive side to the electrolyte, which would indeed explain the observed shift. Note that the increase in Voc value from 0.745 V (Dye-1), to 0.778 V (Dye-2) and to 0.791 V (Dye-3) correlates with the increase in the dipole moments of the dyes, i.e. 3.25 (Dye-1), 3.79 (Dye-2) and 3.97 Debye (Dye-3). The effect is largest when the molecules stand upright on the surface,10 which is expected for Dye-1 to Dye-3 (Fig. 2b). However, apart from the dipole moment and the orientation of the sensitizer, the potential shift is proportional to the surface concentration. A careful comparison including charge extraction measurements for the three sensitizers was carried out in order to gain further insight into this interesting effect.
Transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay measurements were carried out on the devices made with Dye-3 to compare the recombination rate of the electrons from the TiO2 conduction band to the redox mediator. The electron lifetime as a function of the charge density is plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The lifetime is 4 to 10 times longer compared to that of the D35 dye used as a reference, the difference becoming larger with increasing charge density. It is clear that the specific molecular structure of Dye-3 with the laterally protruding 4-octylphenyl side chains effectively reduces the charge recombination compared to that of the D35 dye.
We also consider that the bulky groups in the new dyes may contribute to the larger ff values (0.74 to 0.76) than in the PV cells. As seen in Fig. 2b top view, the 4-octylphenyl groups would have prevented both the aggregation and the side-on attachment of the dyes, and hence effectively suppressed the recombination processes.
An even higher Voc value of 0.9 V was obtained by replacing the iodide/triiodide with a Co(II/III)(bipy)3-based electrolyte,15 thereby raising the PCE to 7.54%.
In summary, we have shown that the rigid, planar and bulky CPV molecule serves as an efficient linker that connects the donor and the acceptor moieties. This robust and bulky linker helps to reduce the recombination, which resulted in the high Voc values. The octyl side chains protruding laterally from the sensitizer hampers contact between the donor moiety and the TiO2 surface and suppresses the charge recombination to achieve high ff values. It would also protect the TiO2 surface, preventing access of the electrolytes to the interface and retarding the back electron transfer. The rigidity inhibits side paths that quench the excited states and probably increases the lifetime of the dyes as compared with the flexible and heteroatom-containing conventional linkers. The new CPV dyes will hence open up new opportunities in the design of high-performance organic sensitizers.
