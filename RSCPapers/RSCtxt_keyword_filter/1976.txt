    First published on 7th March 2011AbstractAfter the historical development from the insoluble polyacetylene film to soluble and processible aromatic polymers, donor–acceptor-type aromatic polymers have recently emerged as a new class of semiconducting polymers. The polymer energy levels and band gaps can be tuned by the appropriate selection of the donor and acceptor moieties, and some of these polymers showed good optoelectronic or photovoltaic performances. The conventional synthetic method for achieving donor–acceptor-type aromatic polymers is based on the metal-catalyzed polycondensation between donor-type monomers and acceptor-type co-monomers. In this tutorial review, a new methodology for introducing donor–acceptor chromophores into semiconducting polymers is described. The donor–acceptor structures are constructed in the main chains and side chains of semiconducting polymers using a polymer reaction based on high-yielding addition reactions between the electron-rich alkynes and strong acceptor molecules, such as tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Considering the p-type doping features of TCNE and TCNQ, the experimental procedure is the same as the conventional doping technique for semiconducting polymers. However, the resulting donor–acceptor type polymers are chemically stable due to the absence of unstable unpaired electrons (polarons). The donor–acceptor alternating polymers were achieved in one step from the precursor poly(aryleneethynylene)s and poly(arylenebutadiynylene)s. When the side chain alkynes were post-functionalized, the polymer energy levels were controlled by the species and amount of the employed acceptor molecules. These atom-economic acceptor additions satisfy most of the requirements of the “click chemistry” concept. In contrast to the conventional click chemistry reactions, the reactions between electron-rich alkynes and acceptor molecules provide a wide variety of polymers with promising optoelectronic applications.

1. Introduction
Since the metallic conductivity (105 S cm−1) of polyacetylene was discovered by the serendipitous preparation of a thin film followed by its chemical doping with I2 in 1970s, the doping technique has been an important method of enhancing various properties of organic and polymeric materials (Fig. 1).1 Polyacetylene is indeed the simplest conjugated polymer structure and the conductivity change in terms of the doping process has been comprehensively investigated.2 The doping process of conjugated polymers is mainly based on chemical or electrochemical redox reactions, and they are classified as p-type and n-type dopings. The p-type doping corresponds to the electron removal from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the π-bands, yielding cationic radicals and bications. In contrast, n-type doping giving additional electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) produces anionic radicals and bianions. Due to the difficulties in controlling the doping level and the significant instability of organic anionic radicals under ambient conditions, n-type doping is rarely attempted as compared to p-type doping. However, in the case of polyacetylene, the limited chemical stability in the p-doped state and the difficult processing problem have hindered its practical applications.
 Fig. 1  A historical summary of polymer doping techniques and click chemistry. 
According to Heeger's classification,3 soluble and processible conjugated polymers are the second generation semiconducting polymers, which are composed of single component aromatic rings possessing solubilizing alkyl or oligo(alkyloxy) substituents. This class of aromatic polymers generally shows higher chemical stabilities in the doped states than polyacetylene, and the specific polymer properties can be controlled by the precise molecular design. For example, a p-phenylene spacer between readily dopable aromatic units is a key to developing high conductivities. A very high electrical conductivity has been pursued by the doping of numerous aromatic polymers with a p-phenylene spacer, but none of them showed conductivities higher than that of the initially reported polyacetylene.4 In contrast, a m-phenylene spacer between the dopable aromatic units results in a localization of the radical ions generated through the doping, and ferromagnetic interactions between them produce magnetic polymers. Based on this molecular design, the synthesis of polymer-based organic magnets has been attempted by many groups in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.5,6 Remarkably, a very large magnetic ordering was finally achieved for conjugated polymer gels containing triarylmethine-based carbon radicals.7 However, the carbon-centered radical species can survive only at low temperatures and any practical applications under ambient conditions were extremely difficult.
Recently, the development of high performance devices using organic semiconducting materials and polymers is highly expected. In order to achieve a reliable device performance, a high chemical stability in the doped states is required. It is known that some polymer structures, such as polythiophene derivatives8 and aromatic polyamines,9 show stable and repeated redox activities at ambient temperature, and accordingly, their excellent electrochromic behaviors with a multi-coloration and a high contrast change were reported. On the other hand, some scientists proposed a new and unique concept based on the use of more chemically stable open-shell polymers, namely persistent poly(nitroxide radical)s.10 The electrochemical p-type and n-type dopings of such polyradicals produce chemically stable polycations and polyanions, respectively. Thus, reliable and fast redox behaviors were successfully applied to secondary batteries and organic nonvolatile memory devices.11
One of the most rapid advances so far seen in this century is probably the development of organic photovoltaic devices12 as well as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). In particular, concentrated efforts by polymer scientists have been made to produce bulk heterojunction organic solar cells composed of a p-type semiconducting polymer and an n-type semiconducting fullerene derivative. This is because the tuning of the p-type semiconducting polymer structures directly contributes to the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The best PCE reported so far exceeded 7% when donor–acceptor alternating conjugated polymers were employed as a p-type semiconductor.13–15 The linear donor–acceptor alternating polymer structures, classified as the third generation semiconducting polymers by Heeger,3 have mainly been synthesized by the metal (Pd, Ni, etc.)-catalyzed polycondensation between donor-type bifunctional monomers and acceptor-type bifunctional co-monomers.16 As compared to the second generation semiconducting polymers, the chemical structures of the repeat unit are more complex. Furthermore, due to the intramolecular donor–acceptor interactions, the electronic charge-transfer (CT) transitions result in a broad and low energy absorption, which facilitates the efficient photo-energy conversion of solar light.
The doping technique has been employed even in organic electronic devices. For example, Leo et al. demonstrated that the addition of a small amount of strong π-electron acceptors, such as dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), to hole transport layers significantly lowers the resistance and a better OLED performance with the sufficient device stability was obtained.17 The same doping method could also be applied to organic p-i-n solar cells for improvement of their photocurrent.
In addition to the accumulated knowledge on semiconductor doping techniques, it should be noted that the cyano-containing organic π-acceptors serve not only as conventional p-type doping reagents, but also as chemical reactants in many organic reactions. This fact led to a new project on the postfunctionalization of aromatic or conjugated polymers directed towards organic device applications. In other words, the conventional doping technique was adapted to perform polymer reactions. If the reactions are highly efficient and satisfy the “click chemistry” requirements, they are categorized as click postfunctionalization.18,19 This idea occurred to me when the small organic π-electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), was studied. TCNE was developed in the 1950s with the initial objective being the preparation of the corresponding polymer.20 Unfortunately, TCNE did not polymerize under any conditions, but its rich chemistry including its fascinating reactivities and metal coordination abilities was very soon realized. One of the key reactions in this tutorial review is the high-yielding [2+2] cycloadditions with alkynes activated by electron-donating groups, followed by cycloreversion, yielding donor-substituted 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) chromophores. This reaction was, to our knowledge, first reported for the metal–acetylide complexes in 1981 by Bruce et al.,21 and the extensive synthetic studies of the small donor–acceptor molecules using this class of reactions were recently performed by Diederich et al.22 Their systematic studies revealed that acceptor molecules applicable to this reaction are not limited to TCNE, but expand to DDQ, TCNQ, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-TCNQ (F4TCNQ), and 1,1-dicyanovinyl derivatives. Furthermore, it was also suggested that the substituents of the alkyne molecules significantly affect the reactivities or reaction yields. Some combinations of the electron-donating groups and acceptor molecules successfully provide the corresponding donor–acceptor products in almost quantitative yields under very mild conditions. The advantages of yielding no byproducts and of gaining intramolecular CT bands strongly suggest the application possibilities of these reactions to the click postfunctionalization of aromatic polymers.23
The aim of this tutorial review is to describe the general background of click chemistry and discuss the potentials of the new click postfunctionalization using the alkyne–acceptor addition reactions. The conventional click chemistry reactions could not emphasize the advantages of applying them to aromatic or conjugated polymers. In contrast, the new click chemistry reactions, namely acceptor additions to electron-rich alkynes, dramatically change the energy levels of polymers and materials, as can the redox-associated dopings. However, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between the conventional doping technique (redox reactions) and click postfunctionalization (chemical reactions). Therefore, to focus on click chemistry, this tutorial review will begin with a brief introduction of click chemistry history. This will be followed by the development of the new alkyne–acceptor click chemistry reactions. The application to click postfunctionalization is divided into three sections highlighted by recent examples. Finally, a brief summary and future prospects will be described.
2. Conventional click chemistry
2.1 
          Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
The concept of “click chemistry” was proposed at the beginning of this century by Sharpless et al.24 The main criteria of this chemistry or the actual reaction include a high efficiency, atom economy, mild reaction conditions, little or no byproducts, and easy purification. Tolerance to other functional groups, i.e., orthogonality, is another important point to design and construct more complex molecular architectures. At the moment, the most well-studied “click chemistry” reaction is the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) yielding 1,4-triazole products. The original reaction, a thermal 1,3-diploar cycloaddition between azides and alkynes, was initially investigated by Huisgen in the 1950s–1970s. In this case, the reaction yields are generally low due to the high activation barrier and a mixture of regioisomeric 1,4- and 1,5-triazoles is obtained (Scheme 1A). Sharpless et al.25 and Meldal et al.26 independently reported the high efficiency of the Cu(I) catalysts for improving the reaction yield and the regioisomeric 1,4-triazole content (Scheme 1B). The method is now recognized as CuAAC and the efficiency is known to be a factor of 107 greater than the thermal addition without catalysts. Fokin et al. also found that the Cp*Ru(PPh3)2 complexes can catalyze the reaction, selectively yielding the 1,5-triazole isomer (Scheme 1C).27 With these findings, the concept of “click chemistry” was finally established and is rapidly expanding to many research fields.28 In particular, it was found that this method is very useful for synthetic polymer scientists, because almost quantitative yields of each bond-forming reaction are required for achieving high molecular weight polymers from polymer syntheses. Also, undesired moieties caused by side reactions should be minimized in polymer reactions.
 Scheme 1  (A) Thermal cycloaddition reaction between terminal alkynes and azides and the catalyst-induced regioregularity control of the products: (B) 1,4-triazoles by Cu(I) catalysts and (C) 1,5-triazoles by Ru catalysts. 
Based on the versatility of CuAAC to polymer science, both the click polymerization and click postfunctionalization were examined for various chemical structures by many groups.29–31 Linear, hyperbranched, dendritic, and macrocyclic poly(triazole)s were successfully synthesized by the polyaddition, and the postfunctional modification of precursor polymers readily endows various additional functions in one step.32 However, several limitations regarding CuAAC were simultaneously pointed out. For example, metal catalysts are generally required for achieving high addition yields and regioselectivity control. A small amount of metal contamination hinders any biological applications. Moreover, as some azide substances are explosive, large scale reactions are never recommended. Furthermore, 1,4-substituted triazole rings do not efficiently communicate π-electrons between both substituents. For example, the fluorene-based aromatic polymer 3, prepared by polyaddition using CuAAC between 1 and 2, shows the longest wavelength absorption λmax in the UV region at 340 nm despite the high molecular weight of >105 (Scheme 2A).33 This is also the case for the postfunctionalization of aromatic or conjugated polymers. The desired side chain functionalities can be introduced into a polythiophene derivative 4, but the energy level of the polythiophene main chain of 5 was hardly affected due to the sp3 atoms in the triazole-containing spacer (Scheme 2B).34 These limitations have separated click chemistry from the research field of aromatic or conjugated polymers.

2.2 Other click chemistry reactions
In order to solve the limitations of CuAAC, many other click chemistry reactions have been developed. Due to the limited space, four representative examples will be described in this section. Interested readers are referred to the recent review articles and references therein.35
With the aim of biological applications, Jewett and Bertozzi developed a Cu-free azide–alkyne cycloaddition using cyclooctyne derivatives as the alkyne group. The highly distorted sp-hybridized carbons of 6 are very close to the transition state of the cycloaddition with azides, and thus no metal catalysts are required to allow the reaction to proceed in high yields at room temperature (Scheme 3A).36 Another approach to activate alkynes is to substitute with electron-deficient groups. For example, aroylacetylenes smoothly react with azide moieties at 100 °C, yielding aroyltriazole derivatives with high regioregularity.37 Apart from the use of azide substances, combinations of other functional groups have been investigated. Diels–Alder reactions are recently being reevaluated as a reaction that satisfies some click chemistry criteria, and they were indeed employed for the postfunctionalization of common polymers, such as the anthracene-appended polyacrylate 8 (Scheme 3B).38 Taking advantage of the reversible feature based on retro-additions, recycled or self-healing plastics can also be designed.39 Recently, it was also shown that a hetero-Diels–Alder reaction is an efficient method for achieving block copolymers.40Thiol–ene or thiol–yne addition reactions currently occupy the second position of the often employed click chemistry reactions.41 These reactions have been applied to the syntheses of a vast range of macromolecular architectures, such as a dendritic structure 11 (Scheme 3C).42 Very recently, a new click chemistry reaction based on the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of in situ generated nitrile oxides to terminal alkene, alkyne, and cyano groups was employed to prepare a linear polymer 14 as well as supramolecular components, e.g., rotaxanes (Scheme 3D).43–47
 Scheme 3  “Click chemistry”-reactions without using metal catalysts or azides: (A) azide–alkyne cycloaddition applicable in chemical biology,36 (B) postfunctionalization using Diels–Alder reactions,38 (C) dendrimer synthesis using thiol–ene addition reactions,42 and (D) addition polymerization using addition reactions between nitrile-N-oxides and alkenes.43 
The latter three reactions are actually both metal catalyst and azide-free click chemistry reactions, and accordingly, most limitations of the CuAAC were successfully overcome. However, none of them, including a Cu-free azide–alkyne cycloaddition, can alleviate the last limitation. In other words, the electronic HOMO–LUMO energy levels of aromatic or conjugated polymers are not significantly modified by these reactions.
3. 
        Alkyne–acceptor click chemistry
3.1 
          Addition reactions between electron-rich alkynes and acceptor molecules
The thermal addition reaction between electron-rich alkynes and cyano-based strong π-acceptors, namely alkyne–acceptor click chemistry, is also classified as a metal catalyst-free and azide-free reaction. The general reaction mechanism based on a [2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes activated by electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-deficient ethene moieties of acceptor molecules, followed by ring opening of the initially formed cyclobutenes, is shown in Scheme 4. In contrast to the conventional click chemistry reactions, this reaction has an additional benefit of applying it to aromatic or conjugated polymers. This is because an acceptor addition to π-systems dramatically lowers the HOMO and LUMO levels of the parent molecules by the formation of donor–acceptor chromophores. The energy level tuning of organic molecules is one of the most important factors in improving the performances of the next generation of organic-based photonic and electronic devices. For example, it is well-known that donor–acceptor chromophores display excellent second-order and third-order optical nonlinearities and structure–property relationship studies revealed that optimization of the donor–acceptor strength is the key to enhancement of the desired properties.48,49

3.2 Donor–acceptor monomers and oligomers
As described in the Introduction, Diederich's group and others have recently performed systematic studies on the reactivities of various alkynes and several acceptor molecules. Thanks to them, the essential combinations of EDGs and acceptors suitable for claiming “click chemistry” reactions were determined and are summarized in Scheme 4.
Diederich et al. initially demonstrated that when N,N-dialkylanilino groups are employed as an EDG of alkyne components, the reaction with TCNE smoothly proceeds in quantitative yields at ambient temperature. For example, N,N-dimethylanilino-substituted TCBD 15 was obtained from the corresponding alkyne and TCNE in 97% yield, ensuring a click chemistry reaction (Fig. 2).50 This successful result was followed by the reactions with more stronger π-acceptors. The reaction with TCNQ provided the corresponding donor–acceptor molecules 16 in a quantitative yield at ambient temperature.51 The TCNQ-adducts display more bathochromically shifted CT absorption bands and lower first reduction potentials than the corresponding TCNE-adducts, suggesting the stronger electron-accepting ability. It was recently shown that other stronger acceptors, such as DDQ and F4TCNQ, undergo addition reactions with N,N-dialkylanilino-substituted alkynes, but the reactivities are lower than those of TCNE and TCNQ.52,53 Thus, no optimized conditions quantitatively yielding the desired addition products were determined, although harsher conditions were attempted. In the same period, other promising EDGs have been pursued. Diederich et al. investigated the potentials of weaker donors, such as anisole, thiophene, and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives. These weaker donors require harsher reaction conditions for the reaction with TCNE, such as higher temperatures and longer times, and the reaction progress competed with the partial decomposition of the products.54 Therefore, the application possibilities of these EDGs to polymer reactions are limited. Shoji et al. found that the appropriately designed azulene derivative serves as a strong EDG for activation of various alkynes. An azulene-substituted ethynylbenzene derivative reacted with TCNE at 20 °C and with TCNQ upon mild heating, e.g., in refluxing ethylacetate, yielding the corresponding donor–acceptor molecules, e.g., 17 (with TCNE), in almost quantitative yields.55 Since the initial report on the Ru–acetylide complex by Bruce et al.,21 organometallic substances have been the target for this series of reactions. Although the moderate reactivities of the ferrocene-substituted alkynes toward TCNE were reported,56,57 they were carefully reexamined using the newly prepared 1,1′-bis(phenylethynyl)ferrocene. The reaction with 1 equiv. of TCNE quantitatively proceeded at ambient temperature, yielding 18.58 However, the addition of the second TCNE to 18 was significantly hindered due to the reduced electron-donating power of the ferrocene moiety. The notable features of these reported donor–acceptor molecules include the significant non-planarity of the acceptor moieties, well-defined CT absorptions, and low first reduction potentials. Some molecules possess a high thermal stability, allowing for the preparation of high-optical-quality amorphous thin films by a vapor deposition method.59,60
 Fig. 2  Examples of donor–acceptor chromophores obtained by the addition reaction between electron-rich alkynes and acceptor molecules in almost quantitative yields. 
Diederich et al. further studied the larger oligoacetylenic molecules. The combination of N,N-dialkylanilino donors and the compact TCNE acceptor almost always provided the desired TCNE-adducts 19–21 in very high yields.61 It is noteworthy that the opposite combination of electron-deficient alkynes and the strong π-donor, TTF, also undergoes the addition reaction through a similar mechanism.62 Thus, the three alkynes substituted by the electron-withdrawing TCBD moieties in 21 were reactive toward TTF. However, the isolated yield of the corresponding tri-TTF-adduct by column chromatography was 47%, suggesting its unsuitability for the click chemistry concept.63
4. Postfunctionalization
4.1 Donor–acceptor type polymers from main chain alkyne polymers
A comprehensive study on the small molecule-based alkyne reactivities towards TCNE revealed that aromatic amines, as represented by N,N-dialkylaniline derivatives, ferrocene, and azulene derivatives are good activators of alkyne moieties suitable for the click postfunctionalization. In order to perform the postfunctionalization of polymers, it is practically important to select the reactions that do not accompany any undesired side reactions.64 Low yields or remaining unreacted moieties are rather accepted.
At first, the postfunctionalization of conjugated polymers containing electron-rich alkynes in the main chain was attempted using the TCNE addition, which provided donor–acceptor type aromatic polymers. As mentioned in the Introduction, there is a growing interest in the development of new donor–acceptor alternating polymers for many applications. The alkyne-containing conjugated polymers, such as poly(aryleneethynylene)s and poly(arylenebutadiynylene)s, are originally an important class of organic materials with fascinating optical and electrical properties. These precursor polymers can be readily prepared by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction or acetylenic oxidative reaction of diethynylarene derivatives. As carbazole is known to be a planar aromatic amine with strong electron-donating features at the 3,6-positions, the 3,6-carbazole-based poly(arylenebutadiynylene) 22 was prepared by the acetylenic oxidative coupling of the corresponding diethynylcarbazole monomer. Introduction of plural cyano groups into polymers generally results in a solubility problem. Therefore, longer alkyl chains were introduced into the repeat unit of 22. Surprisingly, in contrast to the high reactivities of the monomeric 3-ethynylcarbazole derivatives, heating was necessary to start the reaction of 22 with TCNE (Scheme 5A).65 Based on the thermogravimetric analyses of both the precursor and produced polymers, the reaction conditions of 100 °C for 48 h in 1,2-dichlorobenzene were optimized so as not to induce any decomposition. The monitoring of the UV-Vis spectral change suggested the continuous increase in the CT band at 515 nm up to 0.8 equiv. of TCNE addition relative to the monomer repeat unit. The common identification techniques, such as NMR, IR and elemental analysis, confirmed the chemical structure and the addition amount of 23. The ferrocene-containing poly(aryleneethynylene) 24 was also subjected to the postfunctional modification with TCNE (Scheme 5B).58 The optimized reaction conditions (120 °C for 3 h in 1,2-dichlorobenzene) afforded the donor–acceptor polymer 25 with the TCNE addition amount of 75%. Although these reactions were not quantitative, the excess TCNE did not produce any undesired side reactions. As the unreacted TCNE could readily be removed by sublimation using a laboratory pump, no further difficult purifications were necessary. Thus, the reaction yields or the amount of the added TCNE could simply be determined by the weight increase. In contrast to TCNE, the TCNQ addition did not proceed under the same conditions. It was recently found that microwave irradiation can assist with the addition reaction of TCNE and TCNQ for the poorly activated alkynes.66

Shown are the end absorption in CHCl3 for 22 and 23 and in 1,2-dichloroethane for 24 and 25.58,65 
The efficient intramolecular CT interactions were confirmed by the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra and redox potentials. Similar to the monomeric donor-substituted TCBDs, the TCNE-adducted polymers 23 and 25 displayed relatively weak but well-defined CT bands. The ESR measurements of 23 and 25 revealed the absence of any unpaired electrons, suggesting that the new low energy bands are not polaron bands. This result was further supported by the high thermal stabilities of the TCNE-adducted polymers, as indicated by the slightly enhanced decomposition temperature (Td) of 23 (348 °C → 353 °C) and glass transition temperature (Tg) of 25 (32 °C → 38 °C). The optical band gaps, determined from the end absorption λend, clearly showed the dramatic change due to the postfunctionalization. The band gap narrowing exceeded 1.1 eV [from 22: λend 494 nm (2.51 eV) to 23: λend 950 nm (1.31 eV) and from 24: λend 481 nm (2.58 eV) to 25: λend 850 nm (1.46 eV)]. The optical band gaps were almost consistent with the electrochemical band gaps, determined from the difference between the first oxidation potential Eox,1 and the first reduction potential Ered,1 measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M (nC4H9)4NClO4. Although the precursor polymers did not display any reduction peaks in the measurement range, the TCNE-adducted polymers showed the irreversible Ered,1 at −0.8 to −0.9 V (vs.Fc+/Fc). Combined with the Eox,1 ascribed to the redox of the carbazole or ferrocene moieties, the electrochemical band gaps were ca. 1.2 V.
4.2 Donor–acceptor type polymers from side chain alkyne polymers
Optimization of the polymer energy levels is essential for achieving the high performance activities of photonic and electronic devices. For example, Leclerc et al. recently scrutinized the relationship between the electronic HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices using donor–acceptor alternating conjugated copolymers.67 The desired polymer energy levels could be finally acquired by the repeated copolymerization between the 2,7-carbazole-based donor monomer and the counter acceptor comonomers. This is actually an excellent achievement, but it is time-consuming to perform the polymerization and purification processes many times.
Click postfunctionalization using alkyne–acceptor addition reactions was applied to the aromatic or conjugated polymers substituted by the electron-rich alkyne side chains. The precursor aromatic polyamine 26 and regio-random polythiophene 28 were prepared by the Pd-catalyzed amination and Suzuki polycondensation, respectively. The stepwise addition of TCNE to a 1,2-dichloroethane solution of 26 gradually changed the absorption spectra up to 1.0 equiv. of TCNE at ambient temperature (Fig. 3).68 In contrast to the main chain alkynes, the reaction of the side chain alkynes definitely proceeded in a click chemistry fashion. The appearance of a new CT band centered at ca. 470 nm suggests the formation of donor–acceptor chromophores in the side chains. The presence of an isosbestic point at 428 nm and the MALDI-TOF MS spectra strongly supported the quantitative reaction without any undesired side reactions. Similar to the polyamine, the polythiophene derivative 28 underwent the quantitative TCNE addition at ambient temperature (Fig. 4).69 It was also found that these polymers were quantitatively reactive towards TCNQ, but heating to 160 °C in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was required for the addition completion.
 Fig. 3  Click postfunctionalization of the aromatic polyamine by the TCNE addition to the side chain alkynes and the UV-Vis spectral change in 1,2-dichloroethane at 20 °C. Shown are the electronic HOMO and LUMO energy levels determined by the Eox,1 and Ered,1 values, respectively, as well as the glass transition temperatures (Tgs) and the 5% decomposition temperatures (Td5%s).68 
 Fig. 4  Click postfunctionalization of the polythiophene derivative by the TCNE and TCNQ addition to the side chain alkynes, and the electronic HOMO and LUMO levels of (a) 29 and (b) 30 with different acceptor amounts, determined by the Eox,1 and Ered,1 values, respectively.69 
Electrochemical studies disclosed remarkable energy level changes controlled by the acceptors. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were estimated from the Eox,1 and Ered,1 values, respectively, based on the assumption that Fc+/Fc = −4.8 eV. Since the acceptor addition was quantitative, the postfunctionalized polymers with the desired amount of the acceptors were readily prepared without any purification processes. For example, the precursor polyamine 26 was a typical p-type polymer with the HOMO level of −4.9 eV and LUMO level of −2.1 eV. A small amount of TCNE addition dramatically lowered the energy level, in particular the LUMO level. Thus, the fully TCNE-adducted polyamine 27 displayed the HOMO level of −5.8 eV and LUMO of −4.2 eV (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the latter energy level is rather close to that of the n-type fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM; HOMO: −6.1 eV, LUMO: −4.2 eV).70 In contrast to the polyamine with the sp3nitrogen atoms in the main chain, fully conjugated polythiophene derivatives showed a smoother change in the energy levels upon the TCNE addition. The TCNE-adducted polythiophenes 29 revealed a gradual decrease in both the HOMO and LUMO levels with an increase in the TCNE addition (Fig. 4a). The extent of the LUMO level decrease was greater than that of the HOMO level decrease. Accordingly, the polymer band gap became narrow from 2.73 eV for 28 to 1.69 eV for 29 (x = 1). The LUMO decrease upon the TCNQ addition was a more sudden change (Fig. 4b). The band gap of a partial TCNQ-adduct 30 (x = 0.33) was 0.63 eV, which was almost constant upon further TCNQ addition. All these results indicated that the energy levels of semiconducting polymers can be fine-tuned from p-type to n-type levels by the click postfunctionalization using different species and the amount of the acceptor molecules. This method is much simpler and easier than the conventional repeated polymerization method by varying the monomer combinations.
Another noticeable feature of this postfunctionalization is the enhancement of the thermal stabilities. Both Tg and Td of the aromatic polyamine 26 were increased by 27 °C (125 °C → 152 °C) and 118 °C (291 °C → 409 °C), respectively, when it was converted into 27. These thermal improvements were probably due to the strong dipolar- or multipolar-type interactions between the electronically stabilized cyano groups.
In addition to these successful results, other application possibilities of this click postfunctionalization were explored. One of the unsolved problems in polymer chemistry is the exact quantification of the specific alkynes in polymers. For example, it is known that poly(aryleneethynylene)s prepared by the Sonogashira polycondensation contain a small amount of butadiynylene units caused by the side reaction.71 However, the butadiynylene amount cannot be elucidated by common techniques; elemental analysis does not offer a reliable solution in the case of polymers. As already described, although the internal alkynes of poly(aryleneethynylene)s cannot be fully postfunctionalized, the terminal alkynes activated by the suitable EDGs are more reactive towards TCNE. Based on this fact, a ladder-type conjugated polymer, a fused poly(benzopentalene) derivative 31, was newly designed and synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed self-polycondensation of the 1,4-dibromo-2,5-diethynylbenzene derivative (Fig. 5).72 The molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) determined by GPC were 11000 and 1.23, respectively. The titration experiment of 31 with a TCNE solution suggested the intensity increase in the longer wavelength due to the formation of donor–acceptor chromophores at the polymer terminals (Fig. 5a). Plots of the added TCNE amount vs. intensity increase at 670 nm revealed the amount of the terminal alkynes from the peak saturation, which allowed for the molecular weight calculation (Fig. 5b). The calculated molecular weight was 13700 g mol−1, showing a good agreement with that determined by GPC. Thus, click postfunctionalization using the alkyne–acceptor addition will be an easy and reliable method for estimating the amount of electron-rich alkynes in polymers.

4.3 Double click postfunctionalization
To enhance the advantages of alkyne–acceptor click chemistry, it is important to demonstrate its compatibility with other click chemistry reactions. Double click postfunctionalization is a convenient method for preparing more complex functional polymers from a readily available precursor polymer in a controlled manner. This approach necessitates the inertness of a pair of functional groups during the reaction of the other pair of reactive sites. The combinations of various click chemistry reactions, i.e., CuAAC, Diels–Alder reactions, and thiol–ene/thiol–yne reactions, have been demonstrated to work well, and many complex macromolecular architectures have been successfully synthesized.73–75
Although this topic is not directly associated with the postfunctionalization of aromatic or conjugated polymers, it was in fact shown that the alkyne–acceptor click chemistry can be combined with the conventional CuAAC.76 The azide-functionalized polystyrene 33 was subjected to a reaction with 34 under the typical CuAAC conditions (Fig. 6). The terminal alkyne of 34 selectively and quantitatively underwent a cycloaddition with azide groups, yielding a yellow-colored polystyrene 35 with a λmax of 356 nm. The use of DMF as a solvent induced the deposition of the only desired product in a fairly good yield of 84%. The total yield combined with the DMF soluble fraction reprecipitated into a water–methanol mixture amounted to 98%. Since 35 possesses internal alkynes activated by the N,N-dialkylanilino group, the second click postfunctionalization was accomplished with the TCNE or TCNQ addition in quantitative yields. The TCNE addition quickly proceeded in CHCl3 at ambient temperature, yielding a red-colored polystyrene 36 with a λmax of 480 nm, whereas heating to 160 °C in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was necessitated to construct a green-colored TCNQ-adducted polystyrene 37 with a λmax of 710 nm. This double click postfunctionalization using CuAAC followed by the alkyne–acceptor click chemistry creates various colorful polymers through only a purification process by simple filtration. Additionally, the donor–acceptor chromophores are generally the source of high nonlinear optical effects. The polystyrenes bearing donor–acceptor chromophores displayed much better second-order optical nonlinearities, e.g., d33 of 5.3 pm V−1 for the 36 thin film after electrical poling, than the precursor polymers.77

Shown are the longest wavelength absorption (λmax) values in CHCl3 for 35 and 36 and in 1,2-dichlorobenzene for 37 as well as their solution colors.77 
5. Conclusions
The fields of organic semiconducting polymers and click chemistry have seen an independent growth over the past decade. The key technique that combined these two research fields is the old semiconducting polymer doping methods using organic π-acceptors, TCNE and TCNQ. A simple changing the way of thinking from redox reactions to chemical reactions brought about new types of click postfunctionalization applicable to aromatic or conjugated polymers.
The one-step synthesis of donor–acceptor type polymers from carbazole- or ferrocene-containing poly(aryleneethynylene)s or poly(arylenebutadiynylene)s is a completely new synthetic method for achieving the so-called third generation semiconducting polymers. The resulting polymer structures are not obtainable by other synthetic methods. Although an efficient conjugation between adjacent monomer repeat units was disrupted in the sense of the formal cross-conjugation of acceptor moieties, well-defined low-energy CT bands ascribed to the intramolecular donor–acceptor interactions appeared in the UV-Vis-NIR region and their positions can be tuned by the donor–acceptor strength. In the case of the side chain postfunctionalization of aromatic polyamine and polythiophene derivatives, fine tuning of the energy levels was more straightforward. As more and stronger π-acceptor molecules were added, both the HOMO and LUMO levels more significantly decreased to typical n-type semiconductor levels and the polymer band gaps simultaneously became narrower. In other words, the semiconducting polymer energy levels are tunable by the species and amount of the employed π-acceptor molecules. Thus, it is extremely important to diversify the applicable efficient donors activating alkynes as well as acceptor molecules. Although there are many candidates of electron-donating groups and π-acceptor molecules suggested from the systematic studies of small molecules, the number of donor–acceptor combinations available for postfunctionalization is limited. When pursuing such chemical structures, “click chemistry” criteria will be the most important indication of their reliability, as demonstrated by the sequential double click postfunctionalization. Furthermore, applications of the postfunctionalized donor–acceptor polymers to the next-generation organic photonic and electronic devices are highly expected. In particular, organic photovoltaic devices are the current application example of the third generation semiconducting polymers. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that this new class of click postfunctionalization and the products will find suitable practical applications in the future.
