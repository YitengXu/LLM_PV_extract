    , Accepted 17th July 2017First published on 18th July 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells have drawn much attention and achieved efficiencies over 22%, but relatively little is known about the long-term stability under photovoltaic operation. So far, stability studies have reported about the importance of degradation of each layer, but little to no consideration has been given to the whole device architecture. We investigated the stability of perovskite solar cells in order to fundamentally understand the mechanism behind efficiency improvement/degradation during device operation. We found that during operation the interfaces of the perovskite and the electron-transport layer (ETL), meso-porous TiO2, further intermix with each other, which leads to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) during the initial operation of these solar cells. The operation-induced structural changes are examined directly by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with in situ low-energy Ar+ sputtering and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) with C60 sputtering. In addition, this study describes that the primary cause of irreversible degradation during operation is due to the expansion of TiO2 and ion migration throughout the perovskite solar cell.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, metal–halide compounds (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Br and Cl) have drawn much attention as light-harvesting materials for solar cells and their certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have increased from 3.81% to over 22%.1–5 One of the major advantages of these organic–inorganic materials is that these perovskite absorbers can be solution-processed in an ambient atmosphere and harvest light broadly across the solar spectrum.6 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have evolved from liquid electrolyte-based configurations towards solid-state devices with FTO/TiO2 as the cathode substrate.7 The meso-porous structure of a metal-oxide scaffold (TiO2) of high surface area was also used and led to efficient perovskite solar cells with low recombination constants and long charge carrier diffusion lengths.4,8 However, the meso-porous structure of TiO2 causes instability of the PCE due to morphology change in the perovskite film.9,10 To control the morphology of the perovskite film for better reproducibility of the device performance, two-step deposition and dual-source vapour deposition methods were developed.4,11,12 To date, there are only a few investigations that are focused on the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).4,13–18 Leijtens et al. demonstrated the UV induced instability of PSC with a meso-porous Al2O3 scaffold.19 Noh et al. found that CH3NH3PbI3 began to decompose at relatively high humidity (>55%), displaying a color change from dark brown to yellow.17,18 Li et al. demonstrated that perovskite could be corroded by 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP), which is an important additive of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) that is generally used as a hole transport material (HTM).
The studies highlighted above investigated the instability of individual layers in perovskite solar cells. Other studies highlighted the environmental effects on solar cells. For example, some groups reported that perovskite reacts with water from the atmosphere.13,18,20 Han et al. demonstrated the stability of encapsulated PSCs at elevated temperature (55 °C) and high humidity (R.H. 80%).13 Frost et al. proposed a reversible reaction to explain the decomposition pathway when MAPbI3 is exposed to water.20 Our group proposed a proton exchange process to explain the degradation mechanism of perovskite films upon exposure to moisture.18 Recently, it was noted that a correct measurement technique of the PCE may lead to higher performance of PSCs.21,22 Dualeh and Snaith et al. suggested to control the voltage sweep rate for obtaining an optimal current–voltage curve.21,23 Tress et al. investigated the rate-dependent J–V hysteresis of PSCs under an electric field.24 The hysteresis phenomenon became more obvious with increasing number of measurement cycles. Kim et al. discovered that the J–V hysteresis depends on the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 and meso-porous TiO2 film.25 It was found that the hysteresis could be alleviated as the crystal size of perovskite increases. Other explanations for the degradation mechanism have been proposed including environmental conditions, light-induced degradation,26,27 slow trapping and de-trapping of charges, ferroelectric behaviour of perovskite,27,28 slow ion migration,29 or chemical changes in the materials.26 The above-mentioned studies greatly helped to understand the intrinsic properties of this particular material. An interesting and unusual phenomenon of the PSCs that has been reported is that the efficiency of the device was found to boost in the initial PV operations without reasoning.30–32 To our knowledge, the effect of cycling repeatedly the voltage bias and device operation on the photovoltaic (PV) performance has not been studied, yet.
In addition, the investigation of degradation processes during the operation of solar cells is crucial to fabricate an optimum device and commercialize the PSCs. Therefore, this study goes beyond a qualitative report of the degradation mechanism of PSCs under working conditions.
Several techniques were used to characterize the degradation of PSCs, such as photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA),33 lens-free heterodyne transient grating (LF-HD-TG)34 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).21 Nevertheless, the depth profile of the PSCs obtained by both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has not yet been reported. XPS and ToF-SIMS are one of the most powerful techniques for studying the surface of materials due to their high sensitivity and the added elemental and molecular information.35 In addition, the depth distribution of materials can also be profiled with nanometer resolution with in situ ion sputtering.36 Monoatomic argon sputtering and C60+ are the most generally used techniques for removing surface contaminants and acquiring depth profiles within a sample.37 Recently, it was shown that XPS depth profiling can provide accurate information for the degradation and chemical structure changes in organic solar cells (OSCs)38–40 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).38,41,42
In this study, we investigate the improvement of PSCs through operation-induced interpenetration of CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2, as well as degradation based on expansion of these two layers via depth profiling perovskite solar cells at different levels of use. The improvement of PSCs indicates the efficiency boost during the initial operation of the photovoltaic, which has been shown in several literatures.30–32 The degradation triggered by electrical measurement can be divided into three phases: pristine (fresh device before J–V measurement), lightly-operated (∼10 J–V measurement cycles) and heavily-operated (>30 J–V measurement cycles and the PCE dropped to 0%) devices. During medium level of PV operation, it was found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases along with the number of J–V measurements (Fig. 1a). The PCE got boosted from ∼8–10% to 12–14% (inset, Fig. 1b) and further degraded after cycled 10 times for J–V measurements as shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the normalized performance parameters at the initial stage of PV operations. These unique electrical properties of PSCs are completely different from the electrical behavior of conventional thin film solar cells, such as organic photovoltaics. However, although this phenomenon has been observed in several literatures,30–32 there is no adequate evidence in the literature to explain this unusual observation. We established that the analytical techniques of XPS and ToF-SIMS can clearly indicate the elemental/molecular distribution in freshly prepared perovskite solar cells (Ag/spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/meso-TiO2/compact TiO2/FTO). Devices with different operation times are subjected to this profiling technique for studying the change of material distribution. In addition to some of the known degradation mechanisms, it was observed that perovskite has a longer diffusion length towards the TiO2 layer after the device was operated for a few cycles and is responsible for the ∼50% increase in PCE at the initial stages of J–V curve measurements.

2. Experimental
2.1. Device fabrication and electrical characterization
A fluorine-doped transparent conducting SnO2-coated glass substrate (FTO) was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 25 wt% HCl solution for 5 minutes. The patterned FTO substrate was then cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min each. Subsequently, the substrates were cleaned with UV ozone plasma for 20 min before being coated with the compact TiO2 layer. The pre-cleaned substrates were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h for the formation of the compact TiO2 layer. A thick meso-porous TiO2 layer composed of particles of 20 nm in ethanol solution (1:4) was then deposited by spin coating and was again annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The meso-porous TiO2 films were infiltrated with PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) by spin-coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg ml−1) that was kept at 70 °C. The substrates were then heated at 70 °C on a hotplate for removing the residual solvent. After drying, the samples were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I (synthesized according to previous publication43) in 2-propanol for 40 s and dried on a hotplate at 100 °C for 15 min. The hole transport material (HTM) was deposited by spin-coating a solution of spiro-OMeTAD, 4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in chlorobenzene. An overnight oxidation process is necessary for the HTM layer to increase its conductivity. Silver (100 nm) was then thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact. The device area is 0.1 cm2. J–V characteristics of photovoltaic cells were taken using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum in a nitrogen-filled glove box. With an Oriel 9600 solar simulator, the light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. To study the degradation of the perovskite solar cells caused by electrical operation, the devices were operated for different times and subjected to depth profiling. The voltage sweeping in this study shows the forward scan data (50 data points per sweep) with 100 ms sampling time per data point on the PV devices. The PCE in Fig. 1b is averaged (with standard deviation) based on 9 samples and the other PV parameters were averaged and normalized to the first J–V measurement as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
2.2. XPS measurements
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan) XPS system. A micro-focused Al Kα X-ray source (25 W, 100 μm) and an analyzer were rastered on an area of 300 × 300 μm2. The take-off angle of the photoelectron was fixed at 45°. A dual beam charge neutralizer (7 V Ar+ and 1 V flooding electron beam) was used for charge compensation. The Ar+ sputter source was operated at 0.5 kV, 600 nA with an incident angle of 45°. The Ar ion beam was rastered over an area of 2 × 2 mm2 at the same time. The beam currents were measured with the target current on an Au foil and were stable for at least two weeks of continuous operation. Devices were made from the same batch with identical fabrication parameters.
2.3. ToF-SIMS measurements
The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) experiments44 were performed using a PHI TRIFT V ToF-SIMS system for depth profiling perovskite solar cells at different stages of electrical operation. The pulsed (∼8300 Hz, 6 ns length) primary ion source was C60+, operated at 20 kV (1 nA DC) with 50 μm × 50 μm rastering area at an incident angle of 35°. During spectrum acquisition, flooding electrons (10 V) and Ar+ ions (10 V) were used for charge compensation and additional 30 s charge compensation was also performed before each acquisition. In the sputtering cycle, the same C60+ gun operated in the DC mode was rastered on an area of 200 μm × 200 μm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Interface analysis using XPS depth profiling

Elemental depth profile of a pristine device. 

Fig. 2A illustrates the elemental depth profile of a pristine perovskite solar cell device using in situ Ar+ sputtering in the XPS. At the top-most surface, Ag is observed in the first 50 min of sputtering, which is known to act as an air-stable electrode of PSCs. There is no oxidized Ag found throughout the metal layer (Fig. 2B); only little surface contamination is observed (Fig. 2C). Below the metal layer, carbon (C) is observed from 50 min of sputter time as the representative signal of hole transport materials (HTM) of spiro-OMeTAD. It is noteworthy that although the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD is thinner than that of the Ag layer, the time required to remove the organic layer is longer. The apparent slower sputtering rate of the organic layer may be attributed to ion-induced cross-linking of the organic molecule.7 It is noted that the atomic concentration of C starts to drop at ∼300 min, indicating the end of the HTM layer and the beginning of the perovskite layer which has less C. At this region, I 3d5 and Pb 4f peaks were also start to appear (∼300 min), indicating the presence of the perovskite layer. Due to the characteristic of the meso-porous structure TiO2 that allowed the infiltration of perovskite, Ti arises from 350 min, overlapping with the perovskite layer until it intersects with the Sn curve at ∼570 min. The oxygen (O) curve also arises from 350 min and becomes the highest atomic concentration element after 400 min due to its abundant content in both the TiO2 layer and FTO substrate. Compared to other element of profiles in the device, the Pb and I curves have relative flat dropping slope, indicating the infiltration of the perovskite layer into the TiO2 layer. The infiltration of the active layer is evolved from a dye-sensitized solar cell, resulting in a broad interface between perovskite and TiO2 (380–520 min). Therefore, the intermixed interface between the perovskite and TiO2 obtained from the XPS depth profile is consistent with the two-step fabrication process of the perovskite layer. Finally, below the TiO2, the FTO substrate was observed as Sn intersects with Ti at 570 min. In summary, the XPS depth profile in Fig. 2A reflects the multilayer structure of the freshly prepared perovskite solar cell. Such a profiling technique is suitable for investigating the structural information and chemical distribution inside perovskite solar cells. We will use this technique to study the changes in layer-by-layer composition upon voltage cycling the device.

Elemental depth profile of a lightly-operated device. 
To study the changes in the perovskite solar cell, the as-prepared devices were operated via J–V curve testing for several cycles until they were completely degraded and 0% PCE was observed. The device is profiled for examination of the possible changes in the device structure. We observed that between a pristine and a fully degraded sample, there is an intermediate status during the device operations for ∼10 cycles where the PCE increased to its maximum value before it started to drop as shown in Fig. 1. The structure of this best performing device has been investigated carefully. Fig. 3A illustrates the depth profiles of the device operated for ∼10 cycles. The curves of Ag and C (spiro-OMeTAD) show similar sputter times compared to that of the fresh sample (see Fig. S2, ESI†), which indicates that the metal and HTM layers remain unchanged during device operation. Fig. 3C–E illustrates the elemental depth profiles of Pb, I and Ti at different stages of voltage sweep cycle. It is obvious that both profiles (dash red curves) are more diffuse than that of the reference device (solid black curves); thus it is evident that the interface of the perovskite and the TiO2 has changed by the electrical current. The enhanced intermixing of Pb and I ratios in the TiO2 region indicates that the perovskite infiltrates into the ETL (350–750 min), which leads to a higher contact surface of the active layer on the meso-porous TiO2 ETL (Fig. 3A). As a result, the interface change between perovskite and TiO2 as well as the electrically induced intermixing between perovskite and ETL could explain the increased PCE at the initial stages.

Elemental depth profile of a heavily-operated device. 
On the other hand, for the device operated for >30 cycles, it is observed that Ag slightly diffuses into the HTM layer (Fig. S2, ESI†). In the perovskite layer, the Pb and I curves show deeper traces toward the TiO2 layer and the Ti curve becomes broader in shape, which indicates that the interface between perovskite and TiO2 (350–1100 min) expanded due to the electrical operation (Fig. 3B). The dramatic change of the perovskite/TiO2 interface leads to the degradation of the perovskite solar cell (0% in PCE) because the layer structure is altered. The elemental depth profiles (dash blue curves) in Fig. 3C and D illustrate that the Pb and I are more diffuse than that of the lightly operated device (dash red curves). By examining the elemental profile of Ti from the TiO2 layer, it is clear that inter-diffusion occurred between the ETL and the perovskite layers (Fig. 3E). Among the samples, the intensity of Ti stays relatively consistent in the perovskite region indicating a bulky physical change of the TiO2 layer. The over expansion of TiO2 and the long elemental migration of perovskite both contribute to the degradation of the solar cells, eventually. The long sputter time on the heavily operated device will be elaborated in the following section.

3.2. Interface analysis using ToF-SIMS depth profiling

Fig. 4 presents the ToF-SIMS depth profiles of the devices (using in situ C60+ sputtering) at different stages of electrical operation. The molecular depth profiles in Fig. 4A represent a pristine perovskite solar cell as a reference. The molecular fragment, [C5]+, was used to represent the existence of HTM, Spiro-OMeTAD, and was found below the top-most Ag layer (50–250 min). It is observed that the Li+ ions, an additive salt in HTM, aggregate at the Ag–HTM interface. Similar aggregation of Li+ was observed at the bottom of the TiO2 layer. The highly non-uniform distribution of Li+ can be attributed to the metallic ion migration between interfaces during the overnight oxidation process of the spiro-OMeTAD. Below the spiro-OMeTAD layer, the representative [CH3NH3]+ ion of MAI appears first then the Pb+ increases. The weak signal of the I+ was detected and magnified by factor 10× in order to visually compare with the [CH3NH3]+ and Pb+ in the figure. The Ti+ curve rises next to the perovskite curve and forms an overlapped region (300–600 min), which indicates the infiltration of perovskite into the meso-porous TiO2 layer. This is the reason for the initial improvement. Finally, below the TiO2 layer, the FTO and the glass substrate are observed. It can be summarized that the ToF-SIMS depth profile correctly reflects the multilayer structure of the referencing perovskite solar cell and is consistent with the depth profile, observed by XPS. Similarly, the intermixed region between perovskite and TiO2 was slightly broadened (300–650 min) by the electrical operations and an enhanced PCE was observed (Fig. 4B). The slight diffusion of [CH3NH3]+ and Pb+ into the TiO2 layer could form more contact areas between the perovskite and TiO2 and leads to better carrier extraction and enhanced PV performance. The overlapping region was expanded dramatically after extensive J–V operations when 0% PCE was observed (Fig. 4C). It is noteworthy that the Li+ distributes similarly between the devices compared to the devices in Fig. 4A and B, which indicates that the Li+ ion migrates efficiently through the pores between molecules and crystals of the multilayer structure.

3.3. SEM cross-section imaging

Fig. 5A shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the fresh PSCs fabricated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. It is composed of a typical stack of compact TiO2 followed by the active layer (meso-porous TiO2 and perovskite). The device consists of a perovskite-filled meso-porous TiO2 scaffold layer of ∼300 nm. A 200 nm layer of spiro-OMeTAD (HTM) sits atop the perovskite and finally, a silver top electrode is deposited to contact the device. The aging experiments were operated via J–V measurements in a nitrogen atmosphere under 1 Sun equivalent white LED illumination until 0% in PCE was obtained. Fig. 5B shows the SEM image of a heavily-operated device with swelling of the active layer to 600 nm. It is observed that the thickness and interface of the perovskite and TiO2 increase substantially due to the electric current and heat applied in local areas of the sample. The result is consistent with the XPS and ToF-SIMS depth profiles on the heavily-operated device, both with longer sputter times. The swelling process could very well be the reason for obtaining the increased PCE at the initial stages of the electrical operations. During the initial operation stage, Voc and FF increase while Jsc decreases along with the J–V cycles (Fig. S1, ESI†). The electrically induced diffusion between perovskite and TiO2 at this stage results in efficiency boosts; however, the slight change in thickness causes also a little loss in current density. After the initial stage, all the PV parameters drop gradually with increased J–V cycles. In addition, it is reported that the non-uniform distribution of [CH3NH3]+ and Pb+ ions in perovskite forms the top layer of the MAI-rich region and the bottom layer of the PbI2-rich region, respectively, via the two-step deposition method.18 The infiltration triggered by the electrical current helps to balance the non-uniformity issue and results in better transformation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal.
 Fig. 5  SEM cross-section images of (A) the fresh meso-porous structure perovskite device and (B) the perovskite device degraded by J–V operations (0% in PCE). The thickness of the fresh perovskite/TiO2 layer was ∼300 nm, and was expanded twice in thickness due to the electrical measurements. 
4. Conclusions
We investigated the stability of perovskite devices with a stepwise enhancement in PCEs from 8–10% to 12–14%. We showed that operating devices undergo irreversible changes in thickness, which initially leads to boost the PCEs and eventually can result in a dramatic performance loss. By means of elemental analysis on aged devices, we observe that diffusion between perovskite and TiO2 is due to physical expansion of the meso-porous TiO2 layer. By ToF-SIMS analysis, we observe that a small amount of Ag from the electrode diffuses into the HTM. We further show that considerable amounts of Li+ were also observed to diffuse across the active layer and ETL into the FTO and toward the Ag layer. The non-uniform distribution of Li+ ions can be alleviated by electrical operations, which implies that the Li can migrate efficiently across the device layers. Our study creates an understanding of the stability and durability of PSCs by taking into consideration both perovskite and TiO2 inter-diffusion as well as Ag+ and Li+ ion migration. Therefore, it is crucial for this field to investigate interlayer materials adequately that can optimize the ion diffusion length and hinder the thickness expansion to avoid severe degradation.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) The evolution of current–voltage characteristics of a single meso-porous structure TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD solar cell under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 irradiation. (b) The evolution of the power conversion efficiencies with increasing cycles of voltage sweeps (the standard deviation error bar is based on 9 devices measured).	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) XPS elemental depth profiles of a fresh reference perovskite device. (B) Ag spectrum extracted from the 0–40 min sputtering range. (C) O spectrum extracted from the 0–40 min sputtering range in (A).	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) XPS elemental depth profiles of a perovskite solar cell cycled 10 times for J–V measurements. (B) XPS elemental depth profiles of a perovskite solar cell cycled more than 30 times for J–V measurements. (C) Pb, (D) iodine, and (E) Ti distribution before operation (solid line) and after 10 (red dash line), 30+ (blue dash line) J–V measurement cycles.	 

 	Fig. 4  Normalized depth profiles of (A) a fresh perovskite solar cell, (B) device with ∼10 times J–V measurements and (C) device with >30 times J–V measurements. All molecules were normalized to the total counts obtained from each measurement.	 

 	Fig. 5  SEM cross-section images of (A) the fresh meso-porous structure perovskite device and (B) the perovskite device degraded by J–V operations (0% in PCE). The thickness of the fresh perovskite/TiO2 layer was ∼300 nm, and was expanded twice in thickness due to the electrical measurements.
