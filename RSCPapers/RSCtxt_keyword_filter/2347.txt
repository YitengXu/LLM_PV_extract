1. Introduction
The convergent strategies for assembling building units via covalent bonds have long been applied in the total synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.1 This is exemplified by Robinson's work in 1917 of the total synthesis of tropinone from succindialdehyde, methylamine, and acetone in one step.2 The unprecedented application of organic synthetic strategies in constructing 1D disordered macromolecules resulted in the blossoming of polymer science since the 1920s.3,4 The first resins containing these properties were obtained by D'Aleleio in 1944 based on the copolymerization of styrene and divinylbenzene. Synthesized via the covalent polymerization of small building units (e.g., alkenes, amines, and acids), synthetic organic polymers, such as polyethylene, nylon, and polystyrene, have found wide applications in daily life.5,6
An important development recently made in porous materials7 is the construction of porous organic polymers (POPs),8,9 also referred to as, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),10,11 hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs),12 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs),13,14 Schiff base networks (SNWs),15 porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs),16 porous polymer frameworks (PPFs),17 porous polymer networks (PPNs),18–20 microporous polymer networks (MPNs),21 polymeric organic frameworks (POFs),22 pyrene-derived benzimidazole-linked polymers (BILPs),23,24 azo-linked polymers (ALPs),25,26 element organic frameworks (EOFs),27 porous electron-rich covalent organonitridic frameworks (PECONFs),28 covalent organic polymers (COPs),29,30 and anionic microporous polymer networks (ABNs).31–33 In these cases, construction of persistent porous structures via covalent bonds becomes the main concern for advanced applications. From a synthetic perspective, chemical reactions for synthesizing linear conjugated polymers, such as the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, Yamamoto reaction, Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction, oxidative coupling, Schiff-base reaction, cyclotrimerization, phenazine ring fusion reaction, and Friedel–Crafts arylation, are effective for the preparation of POPs.8,9,14 The diversity of building blocks, coupled with the wide availability of different link approaches, make POPs an invaluable platform for developing new organic porous materials (Fig. 1).

As an emerging class of highly amorphous porous materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) with various potential applications have become a new research hotspot in chemistry and materials science during the last few decades, which is mainly attributed to their exceptionally high surface area, and tunable pores, as well as intriguing functionalities. Design and construction of porous architectures that mimic structures found in nature in synthesized materials, down to the micro- and nanoscale ranges, have long been an important research topic. The key strategy for this purpose is the use of rigid building units with multiple connectivities.34 This new field has found increased progress in the last decade, and excellent reviews on the synthesis and applications of these porous organic polymers have appeared recently.8,9,14,34–41
Despite these rapid advances, a long-term goal for the preparation of porous polymers remains: the development of procedures that provide a rational design of tailor-made pore structures and incorporation of customized functionalities, while retaining sufficient framework stability. Another longstanding challenge is to understand the implications of the structural organization, even at the molecular level. In addition, from an application point of view, development of simple and scalable procedures for construction of porous polymers with hierarchical structures at different organization levels is particularly appealing in many cases, since hierarchical pores are expected to synergistically exhibit the advantages of each class of pores.42–44 Another approach is to merge concepts and tools from different methodologies to develop well-defined hierarchical porous structures with innovative properties targeting selected applications.45–48
In this review, we focus on amorphous porous organic polymers; however, there are other classes of porous organic materials of which the reader should be aware, including metal–organic frameworks,49–65 covalent organic frameworks,66–72 noncovalent organic supramolecular structures,73,74 coordination supramolecular structures,75–85 and porous organic cages.86–89 Although all of these materials have their advantages and disadvantages, porous organic polymers are particularly appealing as they combine the processability and mechanical properties of polymers with the molecular control afforded by organic synthesis.90
2. Functional exploration and applications
POPs are unique in that they are nanoporous and π-conjugated, wherein their structures can be designed at the molecular level and synthetically controlled. By virtue of their high surface areas and microporous characteristics, POPs have emerged as a new class of porous material for gas adsorption and storage applications. The pores provide open space and are accessible to various guest molecules and metal ions, allowing for the construction of supramolecular structures and organic–inorganic hybrids. Most importantly, POPs allow the complementary utilization of π-conjugated skeletons and nanopores for functional exploration. They have shown great potential for challenging energy and environmental issues, as exemplified by their excellent performance in applications such as gas adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, light emitting, light harvesting, and energy conversion.
2.1 Gas separation and storage
As seen in Table 1, POPs have been widely explored for the adsorption and storage of gases such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. In addition to the control over porosity provided by synthetic methods, the pore environment can be modified by introducing functional units to the wall surface. This surface functionalization is an important and effective way to enhance the capacity and selectivity of a specific gas.

2.1.1 Hydrogen. 
Hydrogen (H2) has long been considered an ideal clean energy carrier because of its ubiquitous merits. It is carbon free, and oxidation of hydrogen in an engine or fuel cell releases only water as a byproduct thus generating “zero emission”. In addition, it has an almost inexhaustible resource of water. Moreover, hydrogen has a high energy density, which is nearly triple that of gasoline per mass unit, and the performance of fuel cells is more than twice as efficient as that of internal combustion engines.140
The widespread use of hydrogen as a fuel is limited presently by the lack of a convenient, safe, and cost-effective method of H2 storage. The 2010 Department of Energy (DOE) gravimetric and volumetric storage targets for H2 are 6.0 wt% and 45 g H2/L, respectively. These targets are exceptionally challenging, particularly because they are system targets; that is, calculations of storage capacity should include pressure containment, valves, cooling systems, etc. As such, gravimetric capacities significantly greater than 6.0 wt%, solely on the basis of the storage material, would likely be required. The use of elevated pressures (and the necessary containment technology) or low temperatures (with the associated cooling systems) will generally increase system weights and exacerbate this problem. Moreover, there is an important distinction between storage capacity and delivery capacity, the latter of which is by definition lower.
For hydrogen storage of porous materials, it has been found that a high surface area could benefit the uptake capacity of materials. Therefore, porous organic polymers with high surface areas possess a number of potential advantages such as sorbents for H2 storage, as shown in Table 1. The first advantage is that polymers can be composed solely of light elements. Second, there exist a large number of synthetic routes by which a wide range of functionalities can be introduced, for example, moieties that could enhance H2 binding affinities. Third, polymers are a scalable technology and there are already examples of systems (e.g., macroporous polymer resins for separations) that are produced commercially on a large scale. A less obvious advantage is that porous organic polymers can be produced in a molded “monolithic” form. This may avoid volumetric storage issues relating to the packing of porous particulate materials. On the other hand, a significant drawback is the limited number of routes to produce predominantly microporous organic polymers with high specific surface areas (>1000 m2 g−1).
To further increase the hydrogen uptake of POP materials, more efforts have been made to increase the heat of adsorption, which is more important for practical applications. For instance, metal doping of the materials could be an efficient way to increase hydrogen performances. Coordinatively unsaturated metal centers (Ni, Mn, and Li) could be offered by metalation of POP materials.39


2.1.2 Carbon dioxide. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) discharge into the atmosphere has risen with increasing consumption of fossil fuels, adversely affecting the fight against global warming. CO2 scrubbing by ethanolic aqueous amines has yet to be tested as a practical solution, despite the claims that numerous porous solids have better physicochemical properties and lower energy penalties.141,142 In order to avoid energy-intensive CO2 capture, it is better to resort to physisorptive processes (enthalpy of adsorption, Q < 40 kJ mol−1) rather than chemisorptive ones (Q > 40 kJ mol−1).143 Physisorption, however, brings new challenges. First, there is a lack of CO2 selectivity, as there is no chemical bond being formed. Second, when the functional groups are tuned in order to enhance selectivity, CO2 uptakes are hindered. Third, no structure has been identified that rejects N2, a crucial but missing link in boosting CO2 selectivity under post-combustion conditions.
Among various techniques for capturing CO2, adsorption using porous materials is energetically efficient and technically feasible. A number of POPs have been reported for the adsorption of CO2 under conditions relevant to either post- or pre-combustion capture. POPs are quite promising due to their high porosity as well as high tunability of their pore surface functionality, which is important in enhancing interactions with CO2. The CO2 uptake by various POPs reported to date is summarized in Table 1.
Among the reported materials, polymers synthesized by Hani M. El-Kaderi show high capacity and selectivity for CO2 capture. They can be part of the solution and inspire researchers in this field to adopt similar material design strategies for mitigating climate change (Fig. 2).26 The materials can be tailor-made using cheap catalysts, such as copper, to specifically trap harmful gases, and they are environmentally friendly because of their metal-free nature. Yavuz and Coskun have also reported a series of azo-bridged nanoporous covalent organic polymers, which exhibit an unprecedented increase in CO2/N2 selectivity with increasing temperature.109

Recently, an in situ doping strategy has been developed by the Dai group for the generation of a novel family of hexaazatriphenylene-based conjugated triazine frameworks (CTFs) for efficient CO2 capture (Fig. 3).127 The resulting task-specific materials exhibit an exceptionally high CO2 uptake capacity (up to 4.8 mmol g−1 at 297 K and 1 bar). The synergistic effects of ultra-nanoporosity and rich N/O co-doped CO2-philic sites bestow the framework with the highest CO2 adsorption capacity among known porous organic polymers (POPs). This innovative approach not only enables researchers to achieve an exceptionally high CO2 uptake but also provides a means to control the surface features of POPs and may open up new possibilities for the rational design and synthesis of new nanoporous materials for carbon capture.

2.1.3 Methane. 
Methane gas, the primary component of natural gas, is an abundant energy resource. The target value for methane storage set by the DOE is 180 cm3 (STP) at 35 bar and 298 K. Compared with other gases, less attention has been given to the exploration of POPs for CH4 adsorption. The isosteric sorption heats for methane in carbonaceous materials fall within the appropriate range for storage near ambient temperature; hence, organic porous materials are highly promising. In 2008, Cooper and co-workers studied the methane storage capacity for a series of hypercrosslinked polymers synthesized by Friedel–Crafts self-condensation of 50 bischloromethyl monomers such as dichloroxylene (DCX), and 4,4′-bis(chloromethyl)-1,10-biphenyl (BCMBP).144 Among the reported materials, the BCMBP based sample shows both the highest CH4 uptake (5.2 mmol g−1, 116 cm3 g−1) at 20 bar/298 K as well as the highest apparent BET surface area (1904 m2 g−1). After that, PPN-4 was demonstrated to have the highest methane uptake in (microporous organic polymer) MOPs.145 The uptake could achieve 21.5 wt% at 35 bar and 28.0 wt% at 55 bar. Recently, PPN-13 shows an exceptionally high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 3420 m2 g−1.146 The total hydrogen uptake is 52 mg g−1 at 40 bar and 77 K, and the total methane uptake is 179 mg g−1 at 65 bar and 298 K.


2.1.4 Hydrocarbon separations. 
Ethylene, one of the most widely used feedstock molecules in the petrochemical industry, is usually obtained via steam cracking and thermal decomposition of ethane. The similar molecular sizes and volatilities make the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures one of the most challenging large scale chemical separations.147 Current technology uses cryogenic distillation performed under the conditions of high pressure (23 bar) and low temperature (−25 °C), resulting in an extremely high cost and energy intensive process.148 Extensive efforts to develop low energy approaches for efficient ethylene/ethane separation at higher temperature and normal atmospheric pressure have focused on membrane separation, organic solvent-based sorbents, and porous solid adsorbents.149,150 Among these approaches, porous solid adsorbents attract particular interest because of their great potential to afford much lower cost and energy consumption.
POPs, despite the amorphous nature of most of them, feature robust covalent frameworks, showing high water, moisture, and chemical stability; they could also be readily scaled up using one-pot reactions. However, the lack of preferential binding sites for ethylene molecules leads to poor ethylene/ethane adsorption selectivity. A recently reported copper (catecholate) decorated POP demonstrates enhanced ethylene/ethane selectivity;128,149,151 nevertheless, the absolute selectivity remains low, presumably due to the moderate interactions between open Cu(II) sites and ethylene molecules. Therefore, in order to achieve high ethylene/ethane selectivity in POPs, stronger binding sites for ethylene molecules are desired.
It has been well documented that Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions can form π-complexation with the carbon–carbon double bonds of olefin molecules in solutions,152 and these systems have been employed for absorptive separations of olefins from paraffins, which remain inefficient because of the poor contact between the hydrocarbons and the liquid absorbents.153 We postulate that if such kinds of π-complexation can be introduced into POPs, the π-complexation will afford strong interactions between the ethylene molecules and the framework, whereas the porous structure of the POP can maximize the contact between the ethylene molecules and the framework, thereby resulting in high ethylene/ethane selectivity (Fig. 4).149 Therefore, our group introduced π-complexation into POPs, as illustrated in the context of functionalizing the highly porous PAF, PAF-1 with Ag(I) ions. The resultant PAF-1–SO3Ag not only exhibited significant enhancement of ethylene uptake capacity compared to the parent PAF-1, but also demonstrated exceptional ethylene/ethane adsorption selectivity, far surpassing benchmark zeolites and any other MOFs and POPs reported thus far. The formation of π-complexation between ethylene molecules and Ag(I) ions in PAF-1–SO3Ag was proven by heat of adsorption analysis and in situ IR spectroscopic studies.

2.1.5 Membrane separation. 
Gas separation membranes are designed to permeate target gases selectively to ensure efficient separation.154 However, the major drawback with these membranes is the trade-off between gas permeability and selectivity as described by Robeson in 2008.155 In addition, many membranes suffer from low stability and cost efficiency. Recent research has identified polymeric membranes such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polyethylene glycols, polyimide polymers, etc. as having promising gas transport properties as well as low material cost compared to inorganic membranes.156 To improve gas transport properties, a common strategy is to blend polymeric materials with inorganic porous particles into a composite known as a mixed matrix membrane (MMM).157 However, many MMMs have a common problem of exhibiting voids at the polymer–particle interface, which can reduce the gas selectivity. Interfacial voids have been partially mitigated by post-synthetic modification of filler particles to provide for better interaction with the polymeric material. Accordingly, porous organic polymers (POPs) are promising candidates to mitigate this problem. POPs offer similar advantages as MOFs such as a high surface area, adjustable textural properties, and a tunable chemical structure.8 In contrast with MOFs, POPs are constructed from covalently bonded building blocks and exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability, which is desirable for practical gas separation processes.122 Recently, the El-Kaderi group developed a new POP named BILP-101, which was prepared using simple, commercial monomers via cost efficient Schiff based polymerization.158 High porosity and imidazole functionalities present in BILP-101 contribute to its high CO2 adsorption capacity compared to other sorbents, while the purely organic framework improves compatibility with a polymeric matrix.
More recently, the fabrication of the SNW-1/PSF POF membrane has been reported. This was demonstrated by introducing nano-sized SNW-1 particles with intrinsically small micropores into a PSF matrix via spin-coating its suspension onto a porous support.159 Gas sorption measurements as well as IAST calculations have demonstrated that SNW-1 exhibits high sorption capacity and affinity toward CO2, owing to its high micro-porosity and functional amino groups. An as-prepared membrane was further applied for CO2 separation. Gas separation results reveal that the SNW-1/PSF membrane shows an excellent separation performance, with high separation factors (34 and 40 for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2) and enhanced CO2 permeability (22.4 barrer). Furthermore, with the use of TG analysis, repetitive uses at high temperatures, and long-time tests prove that the SNW-1/PSF membrane is stable and robust; showing its potential in the practical application of CO2 capture.
Anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) contain fixed positively charged groups within the polymer matrix, which allows the selective transport of hydrated anions such as OH−, Cl−, and HCO3− across the membrane.160,161 They are an important component in many electrochemical and diffusion processes that require selective anion transport and high conduction combined with chemical stability. Their use is ubiquitous in industrial processes such as electrodialysis, diffusion dialysis, removal or recovery of metal ions from process streams,162 and electrolysis.163 Additionally, in the energy storage and generation field, there has been renewed interest in developing chemically stable and highly conductive AEMs for redox (AEMFC),164 the latter being of interest primarily because the high pH operating conditions allow cost reductions through the use of non-precious metal catalysts. Advantages also include faster electrode reaction kinetics and flexible fuel choices.165 However, the development of suitable AEMs for fuel cells remains a particularly demanding challenge for materials science, as AEMs must combine high anionic conductivity with mechanical stability towards swelling in aqueous media and long-term chemical stability at high pH values. To date, many polymers have been investigated, mostly based on quaternized amines, with the aim of providing a high concentration of cationic sites. A recent cooperative study reported that an unprecedented hydroxide conductivity of 164.4 mS cm−1 was obtained at a relatively low ion-exchange capacity of 0.82 mmol g−1 under optimal operating conditions.161 The exceptional anion conductivity appears related to the intrinsic microporosity of the charged polymer matrix, which facilitates rapid anion transport.


2.1.6 Application in GC/LC columns. 
Through a feasible ion exchange method, a family of positively charged quaternary pyridinium-type PAFs (X-PAF-50, X = F, Cl, Br, I) have been prepared by the Zhu group and their pores can be tuned systematically at the angstrom scale from 3.4 to 7 Å (Fig. 5).166 To validate the sieving effect of the PAF-50 materials, gas-chromatographic (GC) separation at room temperature was employed, which showed the differences in the diffusion rates of different components. The activated PAFs were packed into columns (50 cm long × 2 mm internal diameter) as the stationary phase for GC separation and examined by using several light gas mixtures in detail at room temperature using Ar as the mobile phase. In the GC separation experiments, F-PAF-50 exhibited a great ability in separating CO2, whose retention time was 6.44 min, from the mixture of other gases (H2, O2, N2 and CH4) with shorter retention times from 2 to 4 min. In contrast, commercial activated carbon, with a pore size around 1 nm and a BET surface area of 840 m2 g−1, is unable to separate the gas mixture with a broad retention time from 2 to 6 min. The pore size of F-PAF-50 is 7.0 Å, which is large enough for the five gases to pass through, but the unique selectivity can be attributed to the dipole–quadrupole interactions between CO2 and the framework, which enhances the affinity and prolongs the retention time. As for Cl-PAF-50 and Br-PAF-50, the retention time of Br-PAF-50 for CH4 is longer than that of Cl-PAF-50, which might demonstrate that the size-exclusive effect will become more evident as the pore size becomes closer to the kinetic diameter of CH4. With regard to 2I-PAF-50, the nature of size exclusion is especially obvious. The selectivity is most likely caused by the size-exclusive effect between pores and gases. The kinetic diameter of H2 is smaller than the pore diameter of 2I-PAF-50, whereas the other four gases are close to its pore diameter. Thus, H2 preferentially passes through the channels. These PAFs exhibit a distinctive molecular sieving effect to separate multi-component gas mixtures. The results of this research have important significance on the practical design and preparation of porous materials for gas separations. Moreover, by combining their specific separation merits, the total five-component gas mixture can be separated completely by turns. The great ease of operation and technical flexibility of PAFs hold immense promise in practical and commercial applications as polymeric sieves.

2.2 Catalysis
Catalysis is one important application field of POPs. POPs are characterized by their capabilities of integrating various functionalities into their skeletons. Introduction of catalytic sites into the skeletons endows POPs with built-in catalytic sites. Due to their 3D open frameworks, POPs constitute a new type of nanoreactor that allows the complementary utilization of skeletons and pores. In the following section, the catalytic properties of POPs and their functionalized derivatives are discussed based on different types of POPs: porous metal–organic polymer, metal-free porous organic polymer, chiral porous organic polymer, porous organic polymer supported nano-particles, and photoactive porous organic polymer.

2.2.1 Porous metal–organic polymer. 
Molecules with organic functionalities, such as catechol, amine, and pyridine groups, have high affinity for metal ions. Porous organic polymers built with a high density of organic contents in the framework would have high potential for the uptake of metal ions. Such features and their resulting applications for heterogeneous catalysis are the main driving force behind the design and synthesis of porous organic polymers with high functional contents.
2.2.1.1 Porphyrin based polymer. 
Metalloporphyrins and their related compounds facilitate many important biological processes, which have promoted intensive research on porphyrins and similar structures in catalysis. Due to the unique macrocyclic structure of porphyrin, they can be easily incorporated into an organic framework by forming inter-links with rigid units and forming porous organic polymers. The macrocycles in the framework can then bind various metal ions to form heterogeneous metalloporphyrin catalysts.36,167–174
Budd and McKeown's group first developed the synthesis of spiro-linked phthalocyanine network and spiro-linked porphyrin network polymers.175 Jiang's group developed a new protocol to synthesize metalloporphyrin polymers with a large pore size and higher surface area. The metalloporphyrin polymer was synthesized by the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling polycondensation of iron(III) tetrakis(40-bromophenyl)porphyrin derivative 4-1 and 1,4-phenyldiboronic acid in the presence of a Pd(0) catalyst.168 It is the first example of CMP-based catalytic systems, which employed metalloporphyrin units as active sites. Metalloporphyrin functionalities are gained, as the units serve as the knots in a tetragonal skeleton. The FeP-CMP consists of dense catalytic sites and has a high surface area of 1270 m2 g−1. The micropores are accessible to substrates and reactants, thus allowing for the generation of a heterogeneous catalytic system. The FeP-CMP displays high catalytic activity in the oxidation of sulfide with a turnover number (TON) as high as 97320 and a conversion reaching 97%. The FeP-CMP is highly active with a broad range of substrates, including alkyl, aromatic, and cyclic sulfides. The oxidation is highly chemoselective to oxidize sulfide units and forms sulfoxide. The FeP-CMP catalyst is insoluble, enabling facile separation from the reaction mixture by simple filtration. The FeP-CMP can be cycled repeatedly without a significant decrease in catalytic activity. The catalyst can be further developed for the oxidation of stronger CQC bonds. The FeP-CMP exhibits high efficiency (99%) and high activity (TON > 107) in the epoxidation of olefins. Indeed, The FeP-CMP is effective for the epoxidation of a variety of olefins, including alkyl, aromatic, and cyclic types.
A cooperative study from Farha, Hupp, and Nguyen has demonstrated that catalytically active Al(porphyrin) moieties can be integrated into an all-organic porous network for use in the methanolytic degradation of a nerve agent simulant (Fig. 6).172 While the presence of a large axial ligand on the Al(porphyrin) monomer can afford Al-PPOPs with larger micropores that are more accessible to substrates in catalysis, the best catalysts are obtained after supercritical CO2 processing. In contrast to the conventional activation method of heating the samples under vacuum, supercritical CO2 processing affords POPs with much larger pores and total pore volumes, thus significantly enhancing substrate accessibility and catalytic rates. Supercritical CO2 processing is also quite important in maintaining catalytic activity during the recycling. Together, these results indicate that supercritical processing can be an effective strategy to generate highly active reusable POP-based catalysts and suggest that it can be usefully deployed with other applications beyond catalysis where low-density, porous materials with very high total pore volumes are desired.

Although the active centers of many metalloenzymes have been well studied, the ability of chemists to imitate the iron porphyrin heme found in these enzymes remains a challenge. Our group reported a water/chemical-stable nanoporous covalent heme framework (CHF-1) that can be synthesized via the Yamamoto homocoupling reaction (Fig. 7).171 Unlike other artificial enzymes, CHF-1 neatly arranges the heme centers to form a graphene-like two-dimensional framework bearing a high surface area (1620 m2 g−1) and high density of active sites. Neatly arranging heme centers into 2D covalent organic frameworks improves the density of the active centers because the active centers are preloaded for specific biocatalytic reactions. Biomimetic catalytic reactions show that the CHF-1 catalyst is an effective heterogeneous catalyst with exceptionally high binding affinities and high catalytic efficiency approaching that of natural heme-based enzymes.

Recently, the preparation of a foam-supporting CMP composite with interconnective micropores and macropores and elastic properties was reported by the Guo group (Fig. 8).167 Metalloporphyrin-based CMP organogels are synthesized within the melamine foam by a room-temperature oxidative homocoupling reaction of terminal alkynes. Upon drying, the CMP-based xerogels tightly wrap the framework skeletons of the foam, while the foam cells are still open to allow for the preservation of elasticity and macroporosity. Such a hierarchical structure is efficient for acyl transfer, facilitates substrate diffusion within interpenetrative macropores and micropores, and could be used to intensify catalytic processes.

2.2.1.2 Other porous organic polymers with a coordinated metal site. 
Cooper and coworkers have developed a metal–organic conjugated microporous polymer with coordinated Ir sites that catalyzes a reductive amination reaction. CMP-CpIr-3 exhibits high catalytic activity, with 90% yield, and is efficient for a series of alkyl, aromatic, and cyclic substrates.176 Schüch and coworkers have developed a triazine-based porous Pt-CTF catalyst that bears coordinated Pt sites.177 The Pt-CTF sample exhibits stable catalytic activity with a TON value of 250 for the oxidation of methane to methanol. This catalytic activity is similar to that of the homogeneous analog; however, Pt-CTF is recyclable by simple separation.
The Deng group reported a class of cobalt/aluminium-coordinated conjugated microporous polymers that exhibit outstanding CO2 capture and conversion performance at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (Fig. 9).178 These polymers can store CO2 with adsorption capacities comparable to metal–organic frameworks. The cobalt-coordinated conjugated microporous polymers can also simultaneously function as heterogeneous catalysts for the reaction of CO2 and propylene oxide at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, wherein the polymers demonstrate better efficiency than a homogeneous salen–cobalt catalyst. By combining the functions of gas storage and catalysts, this strategy provides a direction for cost-effective CO2 reduction processes. The polymers Co-CMP and Al-CMP, both of which have high BET surface areas, displayed excellent CO2 adsorption capacities. Furthermore, when co-catalyzed with a quaternary ammonium salt, TBAB, the Co-CMP and Al-CMP displayed exceptionally high catalytic activities in the conversion of PO and CO2 to PC at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. A single catalyst (Co-CMP) could be reused up to 22 times without a significant decrease in catalytic activity. These findings provide a new direction for the simultaneous capture and conversion of CO2.

Two robust catechol-functionalized POPs with different Td-directing nodes can be synthesized and metalated with LaIII ions to afford catalytically active materials for the solvolytic and hydrolytic degradation of toxic organophosphates (Fig. 10).179 Most notably, POP LaA2C1, with its higher accessible surface area, has significantly enhanced rates in the methanolytic decomposition of methanolysis of p-nitrophenyl dimethyl phosphate (PNPDMP) relative to the carbon-noded POP LaA2B1. Presumably, the higher specific surface area of the former increases its pore accessibility to the substrates and thus increases reaction rates. While there is minimal leaching of LaIII ions from the pores of POP LaA2C1, La(catecholate) degradation appears to be more significant in methanol; the significant decrease in the methanolysis rate of LaA2C1 after each recycling experiment can, in part, be attributed to this problem. In addition, the choice of reaction media is an important consideration in the decomposition of PNPDMP: when the external medium does not solvate this substrate and its products well, preferential sequestration of these species inside the pores can clog them and significantly reduce catalysis. Clearly, one needs to keep in mind parameters such as pore accessibility and reaction media in the design of new catalyst materials.

In 2016, a novel kind of mesoporous o-hydroxyazobenzene POP was developed, which had high surface areas, excellent dispersity in common solvents, and very high CO2/N2 selectivity (Fig. 11).180 The Liu group reported a template-free strategy for the synthesis of phenolic azo-polymers with hierarchical porous structures based on diazocoupling reactions in aqueous solution under mild conditions. The resultant polymers have surface areas up to 593 m2 g−1 with the mesopore ratio of >80%, and a good ability to complex with metal ions, such as Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+, achieving a metal loading up to 26.24 wt%. Moreover, the polymers complexed with Zn showed excellent performance for catalyzing the reaction of CO2 with epoxide, affording a TOF of 2570 h−1 in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (7.2 mol%). The polymer complexed with Cu could catalyze the oxidation of alcohol with high efficiency.

Recently, a series of ionic liquid (IL), zinc halide (ZnX2), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) integrated porous organic polymers (POPs) featuring multifunctional sites were afforded through solvothermal methods for cyclic carbonate synthesis, which utilizes epoxides and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Fig. 12).181 Owing to the cooperative effect of ionic liquid and homogeneously distributed Zn-PPh3 species, which is likely strengthened by the confined microporous structure and flexible frameworks, these POP catalysts exhibited high CO2 capture and conversion performance and provided the highest activity (initial turnover frequencies up to 5200 h−1) of heterogeneous catalysts reported to date within the context of cyclic carbonate formation. Even more surprising, very favorable turnover numbers (TONs) of 2120 and 720 were attained at 40 and 25 °C, respectively. The effect of reaction parameters (reaction time, temperature, and CO2 pressure) on the catalytic performance as well as other epoxide substrates were investigated in detail. Furthermore, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused five times without a significant loss of activity. These ionic liquid and Zn-PPh3 constructed porous polymers may provide an industrial opportunity for cyclic carbonate products.

2.2.2 Porous organic polymer for metal-free catalysis. 
Metallic nanoparticles are undoubtedly the most vibrant catalysts due to their excellent performance in a series of paramount chemical reactions in modern chemistry. However, their use on an industrial scale is restricted by limited reserves, high cost and low stability. In the drive towards green and sustainable chemistry, POPs without metal elements have been explored and studied extensively in catalysis.
Post-combustion CO2 capture and the conversion of captured CO2 into value added chemicals are an integral part of today's energy industry mainly due to their economic and environmental benefits arising from the direct utilization of CO2 as a sustainable source. Various catalytic systems such as metal-centered porphyrins, phthalocyanines, salen, and Schiff base complexes along with metal-free N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based ionic liquids, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), organocatalysts, and quaternary ammonium salts have been developed for the production of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides. Sterically confined N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have played a significant role in organocatalysis due to their air stability, super basic nature, and strong ability to activate and convert CO2 gas. The Coskun group reported a new class of nanoporous polymers, incorporating sterically confined N-heterocyclic carbenes (NP-NHCs) that exhibit exceptional CO2 capture fixation efficiency of 97% at room temperature, which is the highest ever reported for carbene based materials measured in the solid state (Fig. 13).182 The NP-NHC can also function as a highly active, selective, and recyclable heterogeneous nanoporous organocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates at atmospheric pressure with excellent yields up to 98% along with 100% product selectivity through an atom economy reaction by using epoxides. The narrow pore size distribution of NP-NHC also allowed us to introduce a unique substrate selectivity based on size, just like enzymes, for the corresponding epoxides. This metal-free, two-in-one approach for the CO2 gas fixation/release and conversion provides a new direction for cost-effective, CO2 capture and conversion processes.

It has been well documented that the phenyl ring can be functionalized with different groups through various established organic reactions. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), a subclass of porous organic polymers that are constructed from phenyl ring-derived building blocks, feature a high surface area and robust structure with high water/chemical stability. These features make them a promising platform to afford bifunctionality for heterogeneous cascade catalysis. Our group has illustrated the incorporation of two antagonistic sites of strong acid and strong base into the high surface area and highly robust porous aromatic framework, PAF-1 (Fig. 14).183 The resulting bifunctional PAF-1–NHCH2CH2NH2–SO3H not only exhibits excellent performance in catalyzing a series of cascade reactions, but also demonstrates superior chemical stability to mesoporous silica and MOFs. Our studies therefore lay a solid foundation for dual functionalization of PAFs as a new platform for heterogeneous cascade catalysis. Ongoing work in our laboratory includes introducing various types of functional groups into PAF-1 and bifunctionalizing other PAFs for cascade catalysis.

The Schüch group recently reported a nanocasting design and spatially selective sulfonation of polystyrene-based polymer networks as solid acid catalysts.184 Nanocasting is a general and widely applied method in the generation of porous materials during which a sacrificial solid template is used as a mold at the nanoscale. Ideally, the resulting structure is the inverse of the template. However, replication is not always as direct as anticipated, so the influences of the degree of pore filling and of potential restructuring processes after removal of the template need to be considered. These apparent limitations give rise to opportunities in the synthesis of poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) (PSD) polymer networks of widely varying porosities (BET surface area = 63–562 m2 g−1; Vtot = 0.18–1.05 cm3 g−1) by applying a single synthesis methodology. In addition, spatially selective sulfonation at the nanoscale seems possible. Together, nanocasting and sulfonation enable rational catalyst design. The highly porous nanocast and predominantly surface-sulfonated PSD networks approach the activity of the corresponding molecular catalyst, para-toluenesulfonic acid, and exceed those of commercial ion-exchange polymers in the depolymerization of macromolecular inulin.


2.2.3 Chiral porous organic polymer. 
Over the past 30 years, asymmetric catalysis has appeared as one of the most significant frontiers in organic synthetic research. Remarkable progress has been made in the development of efficient chiral catalysts for numerous enantioselective reactions. However, only a handful of homogeneous asymmetric reactions have successfully been transferred into industrial applications. One of the main challenges is that most of the scaling-up processes suffer from the costly preparation of chiral catalysts/ligands and from the tedious separation of the reaction products. An effective solution to these problems is to prepare heterogeneous chiral catalysts that can be easily recycled and reused. In this context, chiral POP catalysts, if they can be constructed, meet these requirements and possess additional advantages by providing accessible catalytic sites and facilitating the mass transport.
Very few chiral POPs have been reported to date.185–192 For instance, Lin and coworkers have developed chiral cross-linked polymer networks based on 1,10-binaphthyl.193 Upon complexation with titanium ions, the networks exhibit good activity and modest enantioselectivity (55–81 ee%) for asymmetric diethylzinc addition to aldehydes. Towards the potential applications of chiral POP catalysts, further development is expected to meet the following criteria: (1) the synthesis of chiral POP catalysts should be concise and based on inexpensive and readily available chemicals; (2) the porous frameworks should be robust and embedded with highly accessible catalytic sites; (3) the catalysts should possess excellent catalytic performance in the stereoselectivity together with the reaction yield; (4) the catalysts should be reusable and easily recyclable. In addition, it would be highly desirable that the catalytic properties of the POP catalysts can be tuned upon the understanding of the structure–property–activity relationship.
According to the above-mentioned criteria, the Wang group exploited the “bottom-up” strategy to facilely synthesize an a,a,a′,a′-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol (TADDOL)-based chiral porous polymer (TADDOL-CPP) for highly efficient asymmetric catalysis (Fig. 15).194 Constructed through the covalent linkages among the three-dimensional rigid monomers, the TADDOL-CPP possesses a hierarchical porous structure, and high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, together with abundant and uniformly distributed chiral sites. In the presence of [Ti(OiPr)4], the TADDOL-CPP acts as a highly efficient and recyclable catalyst in the asymmetric addition of diethylzinc (Et2Zn) to aromatic aldehydes. Based on the direct observation of the key intermediates, the reaction mechanism has been revealed by solid-state 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. In combination with the catalytic testing results, characterization on the working catalyst provides further information for understanding the structure–activity relationship. They suggest that the catalytic activity of the TADDOL-CPP is largely affected by the structural rigidity, cooperative catalysis, local chiral environment, and hierarchical porous framework. The TADDOL-CPP can be reused for at least 11 iterative runs without an obvious loss of activity (yield from 86 to 77%; however, the ee value decreases from 91 to 76%) in the asymmetric addition of Et2Zn to benzaldehyde. They expect that the information obtained herein will benefit the designed synthesis of robust POP catalysts toward practical applications.

As shown in the X-ray single-crystal structure of the functional building block 4, the four benzene rings are positioned as butterfly wings, which could offer the steric shielding for asymmetric catalysis. To investigate the cooperative nature of the working catalyst for the asymmetric addition reaction of Et2Zn to aromatic aldehydes, the TADDOL-CPP was further treated with [Ti(OiPr)4] to afford the TADDOL-CPP/Ti (see the main text for details).

Cui, Liu and co-workers have prepared three chiral porous diene-based POFs via cross coupling polycondensation (Fig. 16).195 The diene groups, accessible via open pores of the framework, could be metalated with rhodium ions to give an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for asymmetric 1,4-addition of arylboronic acids to enones with up to 93% ee. For the first time, they demonstrated the utility of a porous POF as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) in the chromatographic separation of racemates based on their distinctive supramolecular interactions with the selector. The ready tenability of such a modular approach based on olefins promises to lead to a number of chiral organic solids with unique and practically useful enantioselective functions.

2.2.4 Polymer-supported nano-particle catalysts. 
The synthesis of supported catalytically active sites, especially metal nano-particles (NPs) for heterogeneous catalysis, has received great attention because of their unique catalytic properties and wide-ranging applicability. However, they still have a long way to go before they become a common tool for work on a preparatory scale in the synthetic organic chemist's laboratory. The bottom-up approach for the synthesis of porous organic polymers provides simple and direct heterogeneous catalyst synthesis, extremely high catalyst loading with a high surface area and potentially high catalytic efficiency. Coupled together with catalyst recyclability, porous organic polymers could potentially be the solution for the cost-issue associated with solid catalysts. The bottom-up approach also facilitates the tailoring of porous materials with a particular porous structure and surface chemistry, and provides the opportunity for the design of polymer frameworks with various functionalities for their use as catalysts or ligands. The high surface area, well-defined pore structure, and well-designed organic framework offer POPs a great potential in supported heterogeneous catalysis.196–208
Generally, a small particle size may result in a high surface-to-volume ratio and provide a large number of available active sites per unit area for reaction substrates. In this context, ultrafine metal NPs are thought to be more reactive in catalysis than their bulk metal counterparts. However, metal NPs with ultrafine size are prone to aggregate during catalytic reactions owing to their high surface energy, causing the loss of catalytic activity and recyclability. Recently, the fusion of POP and NP technology has been a fruitful area of interdisciplinary research. POPs with a high surface area and large pore volume can provide spatial confinement to prevent metal NPs from aggregating, and their channels may favor mass transfer, which are beneficial for efficient catalysis.
The Wang group reported the preparation of ultrafine palladium NPs with uniform distribution using two click-based POPs (CPP-1 and CPP-2) as supports (Fig. 17).205 CPP-1 was readily prepared by a click reaction of tetrakis-(4-ethynylphenyl)methane with 4,40-diazidobiphenyl in the presence of copper sulfate and sodium ascorbate, while the treatment of tetrakis(4-azidophenyl)-methane with 4,40-diethynylbiphenyl resulted in the formation of CPP-2. In CPP-1, the tetraphenylmethane group is at the C4 position of the 1,2,3-triazolyl ring, while it is at the N1 position in CPP-2. Pd@CPP-1 afforded full conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline within 45 min, while the use of Pd@CPP-2 under the same conditions gave rise to a complete conversion within 20 min. The higher activity of Pd@CPP-2 than Pd@CPP-1 likely results from the synergistic effects of relatively more negative charges and less steric hindrance of palladium NPs. In comparison with palladium NPs with dual distributions and palladium on charcoal, no obvious agglomeration and loss of catalytic activity were observed after recycling several times for ultrafine palladium NPs with a uniform distribution. This study not only provides a general and facile approach for the fabrication of ultrafine metal NPs with size- and location-control but also opens up a new avenue for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalytic systems by using POPs as supports of metal NPs.

The synthesis of ultra-small MNPs supported on POPs is a challenge to improve the activity because of the high surface area-to-volume ratio of the particles. Recently, the Cao group developed a facile method to prepare highly dispersible, stable, and ultra-small MNPs immobilized on soluble PCPs at high loadings (Fig. 18).202 Illustrating the catalytic applications, the soluble Pd@SPCP-3/1 (2.61 wt% Pd) exhibited superior catalytic performances in C–H activation and Suzuki reactions, demonstrating higher activity than the heterogeneous counterparts. Moreover, this soluble catalyst showed high stability and could be recovered and reused. With such unique properties of the porous soluble catalyst, the strategy may bring new inspiration to catalysis by combining the advantages of both homo- and heterogeneous catalysis.

Designed catalyst poisons can be deliberately added in various reactions for tuning chemoselectivity. In general, the poisons are ‘transient’ selectivity modifiers that are readily leached out during reactions and thus should be continuously fed to maintain the selectivity. Recently, the Choi group supported Pd catalysts on a thermochemically stable crosslinked polymer containing diphenyl sulfide linkages, which can simultaneously act as a catalyst support and a “permanent” selectivity modifier (Fig. 19).197 The entire surface of the Pd clusters was ligated (or poisoned) by sulfide groups of the polymer support. The sulfide groups capping the Pd surface behaved like a “molecular gate” that enabled exceptionally discriminative adsorption of alkynes over alkenes. H2/D2 isotope exchange revealed that the capped Pd surface alone is inactive for H2 (or D2) dissociation, but in the presence of co-flowing acetylene (alkyne), it becomes active for H2 dissociation as well as acetylene hydrogenation. The results indicated that acetylene adsorbs on the Pd surface and enables cooperative adsorption of H2. In contrast, ethylene (alkene) did not facilitate H2–D2 exchange, and hydrogenation of ethylene was not observed. The results indicated that alkynes can induce decapping of the sulfide groups from the Pd surface, while alkenes with weaker adsorption strength cannot. The discriminative adsorption of alkynes over alkenes led to highly chemoselective hydrogenation of various alkynes to alkenes with minimal over-hydrogenation and the conversion of side functional groups. The catalytic functions can be retained over a long reaction period due to the high thermochemical stability of the polymer.

Mesoporous poly(triphenylphosphine) with azo functionality (poly(PPh3)-azo) was reported, which was synthesized via oxidative polymerization of P(m-NH2Ph)3 under ambient conditions (Fig. 20).208 This kind of polymer could strongly coordinate with metal ions (e.g., Ru3+), and could in situ reduce Ag+ to its metallic form. The resultant metalated poly(PPh3)-azo (e.g., poly(PPh3)-azo-Ag or -Ru) was discovered to be a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 transformation. Poly(PPh3)-azo-Ag showed more than 400 times higher site-time-yield (STY) for the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic alcohols with CO2 at room temperature compared with the best heterogeneous catalyst reported. Poly(PPh3)-azo-Ru also exhibited good activity for the methylation of amines with CO2. It was demonstrated that the high performances of the catalysts originated from the cooperative effects between the polymer and the metal species. In addition, both catalysts showed good stability and easy recyclability, thus demonstrating promising potential for practical utilization of the cost-effective process for the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals.

Hydrolytic degradation has caused numerous efficient catalytic systems to suffer because in many cases it is impossible to fully exclude water from the reaction systems. Xiao, Ma, and co-workers demonstrated an effective strategy for stabilizing water-sensitive organic–ligand-based homogeneous catalysts by constructing them into a superhydrophobic porous framework, which renders them extraordinarily water resistant yet fully retaining their intrinsic catalytic activities under heterogeneous systems (Fig. 21).207 Representatively, after metalation of the superhydrophobic porous phosphite–ligand-based framework with Rh species, the resultant catalyst exhibits superior activities and dramatically enhanced durability in mimic continuous hydroformylation processes of the internal olefins in comparison with the homogeneous counterparts. In addition, because it is solid in nature, the catalyst can be readily recycled with negligible loss of performance. Given the modular nature and the broad scope of organic ligands, our work opens a new avenue for stabilizing water-sensitive homogeneous catalysts into highly water-tolerant heterogeneous catalysts.

2.2.5 Photocatalysis. 
Semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted tremendous attention for its promising potential to settle intractable environmental and energy issues using abundant solar energy. Conjugated porous organic polymers, if well “bred” (designed), are expected to inherit the beneficial characteristics of both monomers and their porous structure. For instance, they possess some advantages of “conventional” conjugated polymers, with extended π-systems where the electronic levels can be controlled rendering materials that are semi-conductive. Additionally, whenever an interface reaction contributes to the performance of a material (e.g. in adsorption or heterogeneous catalysis), porosity plays a primary role. Then, not only the micropore structure and the specific surface area, but also pore accessibility, pore percolation, and connectivity are mandatory to control. A possibly maximal surface area is required for applications such as gas storage, where the pore size is more important for creating molecular selectivity. In heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactions are carried out at the interface between the media and the porous materials, both the large surface area of the polymeric network for reaction transfer and accessibility to the interfaces for sufficient kinetics are of relevance. The latter is usually accomplished by implementation of a hierarchical pore structure. For “soft” materials such as porous polymer networks, the stability of the micropores is a critical issue, where a rigid structure in the dry state is preferred. In the past few years, significant improvements towards organic, stable, and metal-free photocatalysts have been observed.209–234
In 2009, it was reported that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) could function as a polymeric photocatalyst for hydrogen/oxygen evolution from water splitting in the presence of sacrificial reagents and degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation.224 In addition to its easy fabrication from the condensation of simple nitrogen-rich precursors (e.g., cyanamide or melamine), its low-cost and sustainable properties make g-C3N4 particularly attractive for solar-energy utilization. Moreover, the flexible structure of g-C3N4 allows for plentiful organic schemes to tailor its chemical structure for the enhancement of its photocatalytic performance.217,234 The bottom of the CB of g-C3N4 is located at about −1.3 V vs. the NHE (pH = 7) and is sufficient for water reduction to form hydrogen, whereas the top of the VB at about 1.4 V resulted in a small thermodynamic driving force for water and oxidation of organic pollutants. Of the two half-reactions in water splitting, water oxidation is considered a more complicated process that involves four-electron transfer and reaction. Accordingly, water oxidation to form oxygen represents a key half-reaction to ultimately achieve the goal of overall water splitting with a single chemical catalyst. In this regard, modulating the electronic band structure of g-C3N4 to decrease the VB position for the enhancement of photooxidation strength is highly desirable to improve the moderate performance of water oxidation and degradation of organic pollutants.209,216,235–237
For photocatalytic removal of nitric oxide (NO), two major issues need to be addressed: incomplete oxidation of NO and deactivation of the photocatalyst. The Wang group aimed to solve these two problems by constructing an all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction (PI-g-C3N4) consisting of a g-C3N4 surface modified with perylene imides (PI) (Fig. 22).231 PI-g-C3N4 exhibits significant enhancement in photocatalytic activity (in comparison to pristine g-C3N4) when examined for NO removal. More importantly, the Z-scheme charge separation within PI-g-C3N4 populates electrons and holes into the increased energy levels, thereby enabling direct reduction of O2 to H2O2 and direct oxidation of NO to NO2. H2O2 can further oxidize NO2 to NO3− ions at a different location (via diffusion), thus alleviating the deactivation of the catalyst. The results presented may shed light on the design of visible photocatalysts with tunable reactivity for application in solar energy conversion and environmental sustainability.

As is very well known, the BODIPY dyes have in general low probability to react with triplet oxygen (3O2) to give singlet oxygen (1O2) due to the low triplet state probability. Therefore, the most popular strategy employed to use BODIPY as a singlet oxygen sensitizer is chromophore functionalization with heavy atoms that quench fluorescence emission from the singlet state and increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state. Therefore, Liras and his co-workers reported the design and synthesis of a new conjugated microporous polymer based on a BODIPY dye (CMPBDP) which has shown excellent luminescence properties and efficient heterogeneous photocatalytic activity (Fig. 23).230 CMPBDP shows high thermal stability and high surface area with microporous size and efficiently catalyzes the selective oxidation of thioanisole into the corresponding sulfoxide via singlet oxygen under visible light (up to 500 nm). The photocatalytic rate of the heterogeneous materials is 4-fold faster than the corresponding soluble (used as reference) under the same reaction conditions and can be reused several times.

The optoelectronic properties of CMPs can be fine-tuned at the molecular level, thus allowing flexible design and structure–property correlation to be investigated.213,229 Nitrogen-containing π-conjugated microporous polymers (N-CMPs) derived from oxidative polymerization of triarylamines and their derivatives such as carbazoles have recently emerged as an important class of photoactive NCMPs.212 A carbazolic conjugated microporous polymer (CCMP) is obtained via straightforward carbazole-based oxidative coupling polymerization (Fig. 24).227 The C-CMP exhibits high porosity and a specific surface area of 1137 m2 g−1, and is thermally stable up to 600 °C in nitrogen. The C-CMP is shown to be a highly effective heterogeneous photocatalyst for a wide range of reactions, including oxidative coupling of primary amines, aerobic dehydrogenation of non-active secondary amine substrates, such as pharmaceutically relevant nitrogen heterocycles, and selective oxidation of sulfide using molecular oxygen and visible light. This work highlights the potential of developing photoactive N-containing CMPs as highly stable, molecularly tunable, reusable, and metal-free visible light photocatalysts for a wide variety of organic transformations.

Brominated organic compounds serve as very important intermediates in organic synthesis due to their versatile applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. From the perspective of the bromine source, many bromination reactions involve volatile, corrosive, and toxic reaction conditions under the utilization of elemental bromine. Another drawback is that only 50% of the bromine atoms can be used for the reaction with the equivalent amount of hydrogen bromide (HBr) as a byproduct. Recently, light, especially visible light, has been intensively used as an inexpensive, nonpolluting, abundant, and clean energy source to drive chemical transformation reactions. Pure organic, heterogeneous, metal-free, and visible light-active photocatalysts offer a more sustainable and environmental friendly alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts. Zhang and his colleagues reported a series of microporous organic polymers containing photoactive conjugated organic semiconductor units as heterogeneous photocatalysts for a visible-light-promoted, highly selective bromination reaction of electron-rich aromatic compounds using HBr as a bromine source and molecular oxygen as a clean oxidant (Fig. 25).225Via a simple Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction, the microporous organic polymers were obtained by cross-linking organic semiconductor compounds with defined valence and conduction band positions. The utilization of the simply prepared porous polymer-based photocatalytic systems opens new opportunities toward a sustainable and efficient material design for catalysis.

Developing highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting is one of the grand challenges in solar energy conversion. So far, there are only a handful of organic semiconductor systems disclosed in the literature. Significant increases in the rate of hydrogen production could be achieved by morphology control, donor–acceptor copolymerization, and doping processes.238–241 Recently, the Yu group reported a rational design and synthesis of porous conjugated polymers (PCPs) that photocatalytically generate hydrogen from water splitting.229 The design mimics natural photosynthetic systems with a conjugated polymer component to harvest photons and transition metal part to facilitate catalytic activities. A series of PCPs have been synthesized with different light harvesting chromophores and transition metal binding bipyridyl (bpy) sites. The photocatalytic activity of these bpy-containing PCPs can be greatly enhanced due to the improved light absorption, better wettability, local ordering structure, and the improved charge separation process. The PCP made of strong and fully conjugated donor chromophore DBD shows the highest hydrogen production rate at ∼33 μmol h−1. The results indicate that copolymerization between a strong electron donor and weak electron acceptor into the same polymer chain is a useful strategy for developing efficient photocatalysts. This study also reveals that the residual palladium in the PCP networks plays a key role in the catalytic performance. The hydrogen generation activity of PCP photocatalyst can be further enhanced to 164 μmol h−1 with an apparent quantum yield of 1.8% at 350 nm by loading 2 wt% of extra platinum co-catalyst.


2.2.6 Electrocatalysis. 
Electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water splitting has been attracting increased attention since the past few decades because of the high global demand for clean energy and the increasing awareness of environmental issues.242 Although tremendous efforts have been made, it is still a great challenge to construct a robust, low-cost, and highly efficient system for hydrogen production. Generally, two half-reactions take place during water splitting, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, also called water oxidation) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).243 The OER involves a four-electron transfer process coupled with four protons and is believed to be much more difficult and complicated than the HER.244–246 Therefore, the OER is considered to be the bottleneck in achieving highly efficient water splitting for hydrogen production.246 Although noble-metal oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2 have been used for water splitting, because of their great OER activity,247 large-scale application of these catalysts may suffer problems because of their scarcity and high cost.
Du and co-workers reported the synthesis of a multilayer covalent cobalt porphyrin framework on multi-walled carbon nanotubes ((CoP)n–MWCNTs) to produce a highly active electrocatalyst for water oxidation.248 A linear sweep voltammetry curve showed that a catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm2 can be achieved at a potential of only 1.52 V (vs. the RHE, corresponding to an overpotential of only 0.29 V) in alkaline solution at pH 13.6. Such an onset potential is much lower than that of the cobalt porphyrin monomer (CoP-TIPS) and pure MWCNTs. In addition, the chronopotentiometry data confirmed its excellent catalytic activity and suggested that the (CoP)n–MWCNT catalyst has good durability for water oxidation catalysis. A Tafel slope of 60.8 mV per decade was obtained by bulk electrolysis measurement, and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen production was >86%.
Recently, Du and co-workers reported a series of nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials incorporated with copper nanoparticles, derived from copper porphyrin conjugated mesoporous polymers, as active electrocatalysts for both the HER and the OER.249 These materials possess large active surface areas and unique tubular structures and can efficiently accelerate electrochemical processes. Under optimal conditions, the electrocatalyst exhibits a very low overpotential for the OER (350 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm2) and excellent current density (26 mA cm2 at an overpotential of 790 mV), which renders the present material among the best copper-based catalysts for the OER. In addition, a low overpotential can be achieved for the HER (190 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm2), as well as a high current density.
A series of cobalt porphyrin-based conjugated mesoporous polymers (CoP-nph-CMP, n = 2, 3, 4) were fabricated as catalyst precursors to generate bifunctional catalysts via pyrolysis (CoP-nph-CMP-800, n = 2, 3, 4) for both the OER and HER.250 Among these catalysts, CoP-2ph-CMP-800 exhibited the best catalytic activity with quite a low overpotential for both the OER (g = 370 mV for 10 mA cm2) and the HER (g = 360 mV for 10 mA cm2). Moreover, their excellent bifunctional catalytic performance was also explored in the overall water splitting test (g = 760 mV for 10 mA cm2).
Developing efficient, stable, and low-cost catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) is of great significance to many emerging technologies including fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Various ORR electrocatalysts containing non-precious metals (e.g. Fe and Cu) have been extensively investigated, including transition metal oxides,251,252 chalcogenides,253 and bio-inspired organometallic complexes. Promising results in terms of ORR activity were observed for catalysts containing metal complexes (M–N4) with N4–chelating ligands (e.g. porphyrins and phthalocyanines),254–256 and their polymeric derivatives,257–260 either as such or supported. One of the commonly encountered problems in ORR catalysis is the generation of H2O2 as the intermediate instead of directly producing H2O. It has been reported that polymeric metalated porphyrins with multiple interconnected catalytic centers can directly reduce oxygen to water with high efficiency through the 4e− pathway.257 The advantages of POPs include a large specific surface area, tunable pore size, and high physiochemical stability. It has been proposed that the introduction of catalytic centers into microporous polymers with tunable porosity improves the exposure of the inner active sites and facilitates electron transfer and mass transport.255
Liu, Zhang, and co-workers reported the development of a cobalt(II) porphyrin based porous organic polymer (CoPOP) and its pyrolyzed derivatives as highly active ORR catalysts.261 The as-synthesized CoPOP exhibits high porosity and excellent catalytic performance stability, retaining ∼100% constant ORR current over 50000 s in both alkaline and acidic media. Pyrolysis of the CoPOP at various temperatures (600 °C, 800 °C, and 1000 °C) yields the materials consisting of graphitic carbon layers and cobalt nanoparticles, which show greatly enhanced catalytic activity compared to the as-synthesized CoPOP. Among them, CoPOP-800/C pyrolyzed at 800 °C shows the highest specific surface area and ORR activity, displaying the most positive half-wave potential (0.825 V vs. the RHE) and the largest limited diffusion current density (5.35 mA cm2) in an alkaline medium, which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) (half-wave potential 0.829 V vs. the RHE, limited diffusion current density 5.10 mA cm2). RDE and RRDE experiments indicate that CoPOP-800/C directly reduces molecular oxygen to water through a 4e− pathway in both alkaline and acidic media. More importantly, CoPOP-800/C exhibits excellent durability and methanol-tolerance under acidic and alkaline conditions, which surpass those of the Pt/C (20 wt%) system.

2.3 Energy conversions
Organic energy-converting devices possess great economic potential and have a promising future in leading to a new generation of consumer devices that combine low cost, lightweight, and mechanical flexibility. Porous organic polymers (POPs) are a unique class of polymers that combine covalent π-networks with inherent porosity and show outstanding properties and functions in energy transfer.7,14,261–264 They are highly stable as a result of a cross-linked network structure, and can be synthesized using a variety of different π-units. However, POP-based carrier-selective transporting materials remain to be explored.
Jiang and his colleagues introduced a useful strategy based on electropolymerization for the preparation of π-conjugated microporous polymer films (Fig. 26).265 Thiophene-based molecular systems are high throughput and efficient for the synthesis of high quality large-area thin films and make it possible to control the film thickness. They tested the performance of solar cells fabricated using CMP:C60 films as photoactive layers. The cells with BTT-CMP:C60 photoactive layers exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.02% (open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.732 V, short-circuit current (JSC) = 10.05 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 0.682). To the best of our knowledge, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the CMP films are the highest reported among solar cells containing porous polymers as a photoactive layer. In principle, their strategy is widely extendable to other thiophene-based monomers for the preparation of various porous polythiophene films. The present film strategy is tolerated for the structural design of monomers; they anticipate that the CMP films may find a wide variety of applications, such as transistors, diodes, vapor sensors, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and energy storage.

Later, the Jiang group reported the development of π-electronic POPs as a platform for designing electrode interlayers that feature robust chemical stability, tunable work function, and outstanding performance for energy conversions. They designed a basic structure, that is, BC (borane appended with carbazoles), which bears a tris(2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl)borane (TPB) focal core with three N-substituted carbazole groups at the periphery as electroactive units (Fig. 27).266 The thin films offer an unprecedented example for electrode interlayers with robust chemical and thermal stabilities that are key to long-term performance. These thin films are compatible with various electrodes and offer outstanding functions in various types of devices, including solar cells and light-emitting diodes.

Polymerization of BC resulted in a low work function PBC film that possesses an extremely low HOMO level and serves as an electron-selective electrode.

2.4 Removal of contaminants
Removal and treatment of chemical waste is an issue of broad scientific interest, great technological importance, and increased public concern. Activated carbons are the most widespread adsorbent material used to remove organic pollutants from water but they have several deficiencies, including slow pollutant uptake (of the order of hours) and poor removal of many relatively hydrophilic micropollutants. Porous materials provide an advanced green approach to the removal of chemical wastes, particularly toxic chemicals, and are in many ways superior to traditional methods.14 In addition to catalysis, the pores of POPs are accessible to heavy metals, toxic chemicals, organic solvents, dyes, and fullerenes, expanding the encapsulation scope of POPs.267–271

2.4.1 Metal removal. 
Most heavy metal ions are toxic to humans and living organisms even at low concentrations. One of the toxic metal ions of particular concern is lead, which can damage the brain and nervous system, especially in children. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have tightened the regulatory standards on lead in drinking water from 50 ppb to 15 ppb and 10 ppb, respectively. Currently, cost-effective and selective adsorbents for toxic metal treatment remain in high demand, especially in developing countries where ground water is commonly used for consumption.
Various methods have been investigated and used for toxic heavy metal ion removal from water, including precipitation, adsorption, chelation, ion-exchange, and reverse osmosis. In industries, the removal of toxic metals from aqueous streams has generally been accomplished via precipitation. In general, this method needs long interaction time and high cost ingredients that are capable of forming insoluble compounds with dissolved metal for disposal. It is also difficult to reduce metal concentrations to very low levels by using precipitation. Reverse osmosis techniques have been successfully employed in certain applications to obtain deionized water. However, this method is costly, non-selective (all ions are removed), slow, and not suitable for large-scale water treatment. Conventional ion-exchange resins are not good candidates for toxic metal removal from water. This is because they indiscriminately adsorb non-hazardous ions that are abundant in water such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. Chelating ion-exchange resins or chelating polymers are modified with specific functional groups that can selectively bind only heavy metals. These adsorbents are capable of removing toxic metals from water rapidly. However, in general, they cannot be used to decrease toxic species to extremely low concentrations (below 1 ppb), and their high material cost limits large-scale application.272,273
Reaching such low lead concentration levels typically requires time-consuming precipitation reactions or expensive reverse osmosis systems that also remove essential minerals, such as calcium, from drinking water. A team led by Yugen Zhang and Jackie Y. Ying has now developed a technology that greatly improves purification efforts.273 They used a porous polymer that selectively binds to lead and other heavy metals in flowing water. Filtering water through porous substances, such as activated charcoal, is one of the oldest and most effective decontamination technologies. The material has a high surface area arising from a chemical structure composed of nitrogen-bearing aromatic rings that link into larger, nanoscale loops through hydrocarbon-amine units. Furthermore, the nitrogen atoms found in this POP (mesoporous poly-melamine-formaldehyde, namely mPMF) have a strong binding affinity for heavy metals. Remarkably, more than 99% of the toxic metal was removed within 5 seconds, reducing the lead levels to parts-per-trillion concentrations. Removal efficiencies were equally high under stationary and more challenging dynamic flow conditions. Additionally, the team could recover the lead ions and recycle the sorbent using simple dilute acid treatments. In-depth experiments revealed that mPMF's ultrafast adsorption behavior was due to an open porous structure that allows full access to nitrogen atom binding sites. These sites also removed heavy metals such as cadmium and palladium but had little affinity for calcium and potassium cations.
The weaknesses of existing ion-exchange materials necessitate the development of new robust alternatives that control swelling, provide readily accessible ion exchange sites, and possess a high ion exchange capacity and fast ion exchange kinetics. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, our group proposes a new model of ion exchange materials with the following features: (1) a rigid framework to prevent swelling; (2) a monolayer open pore wall to avoid entrainment; (3) a hydrophobic backbone to enhance the ion mobility in aqueous solution thus resulting in fast ion exchange kinetics; (4) a high density of ion exchange sites contributing to a high ion exchange capacity; (5) a strong irreversible covalent bond in order to obtain a high chemical stability. Such a new model of ion exchange materials can be realized via functionalizing porous organic polymers (POPs), which are ideal for the removal of various heavy metals from aqueous solutions because of their amenability of design and modular nature, high surface areas, adjustable pore sizes, functionalizable surfaces, and exceptional chemical stability.274–278
We speculate that if ion-exchange groups can be grafted onto the hydrophobic backbones of the highly porous robust POP framework, a high density of readily accessible ion-exchange sites that are arranged into a three-dimensional nanospace will be achieved (Fig. 28).274 This is anticipated to afford new ion-exchange materials with a high ion-exchange capacity and fast ion-exchange kinetics, together with controlled swelling and easily accessible ion exchange sites, as well as a high chemical stability. In addition, the well tailorable framework and controllable pore size of POPs provide an opportunity to tune the framework to selectively adsorb ion guest molecules via size-exclusion, a property conventional ion-exchange resins fail to provide. Our studies therefore not only lay a foundation for developing POPs as a new type of ion exchange material circumventing the issues of swelling and entanglement encountered in conventional ion exchange resins, but also advance POP-based ion exchange materials as a new platform for applications in ion selective separation and purification.

Copper is an essential nutrient for life, but at the same time, hyperaccumulation of this redox-active metal in biological fluids and tissues is a hallmark of pathologies such as Wilson's and Menkes diseases, various neurodegenerative diseases, and toxic environmental exposure. Diseases characterized by copper hyperaccumulation are currently challenging to identify due to costly diagnostic tools that involve extensive technical workup. Therefore, motivated to create simple yet highly selective and sensitive diagnostic tools, Long, Chang, and co-workers initiated a program to develop new materials that can enable monitoring of copper levels in biological fluid samples without complex and expensive instrumentation. Fig. 29 illustrates an example of the design, synthesis, and properties of PAF-1–SMe, a robust three-dimensional porous aromatic framework (PAF) densely functionalized with thioether groups for selective capture and concentration of copper from biofluids as well as aqueous samples.275 PAF-1–SMe exhibits a high selectivity for copper over other biologically relevant metals, with a saturation capacity reaching over 600 mg g−1. Moreover, the combination of PAF-1–SMe as a material for capture and concentration of copper from biological samples with 8-hydroxyquinoline as a colorimetric indicator affords a method for identifying aberrant elevations of copper in urine samples from mice with Wilson's disease and also tracing exogenously added copper in serum. This divide-and-conquer sensing strategy, where functional and robust porous materials serve as molecular recognition elements that can be used to capture and concentrate analytes in conjunction with molecular indicators for signal readouts, establishes a valuable starting point for the use of porous polymeric materials in noninvasive diagnostic applications.

Highly effective and highly efficient decontamination of mercury from aqueous media remains a serious task for public health and ecosystem protection. In 2014, our group reported that this task can be addressed by creating a mercury ‘nano-trap’ as illustrated by functionalizing a high surface area and robust porous organic polymer with a high density of strong mercury chelating groups (Fig. 30).279 The resultant porous organic polymer-based mercury ‘nano-trap’ exhibits a record-high saturation mercury uptake capacity of over 1000 mg g−1, and can effectively reduce the mercury(II) concentration from 10 ppm to the extremely low level of smaller than 0.4 ppb, well below the acceptable limits in drinking water (2 ppb), and can also efficiently remove >99.9% mercury(II) within a few minutes. Our work therefore presents a new benchmark for mercury adsorbent materials and provides a new perspective for removing mercury(II) along with other heavy metal ions from contaminated water for environmental remediation.

2.4.2 Encapsulation of organic pollutants in water/as vapor or gas. 
The global occurrence of organic pollutants in water resources, such as organic solvents, oils, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, has raised concerns about potential negative effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. Activated carbons are the most widespread adsorbent materials used to remove organic pollutants from water but they have several deficiencies, including slow pollutant uptake (in the order of hours) and poor removal of many relatively hydrophilic micro-pollutants. Furthermore, regenerating spent activated carbon is energy intensive (requiring heating to 500–900 °C) and does not fully restore performance. POPs have been widely explored for encapsulation of organic pollutants in water/as vapor or gas via various strategies.101,131,269,280–287 For instance, the introduction of a hydrophobic unit, such as fluorine, endows POPs with hydrophobic pores, whereas hydrophilic groups can enhance the hydrophilicity of the porous materials, which facilitates hydrophilic organic pollutants.
Cooper and coworkers demonstrated the above-mentioned strategy with a series of POPs synthesized by the Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction of 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene with dibromobenzenes bearing different substituents.288 When tested with a water-soluble methyl orange dye, these POPs exhibit completely different behaviors when dispersed in water. For example, only POPs with hydroxyl groups on the skeletons can absorb methyl orange, whereas POPs without hydrophilic groups cannot trap methyl orange. Deng and coworkers have reported that CMP via Pd(II)/Cu(I)-catalyzed homocoupling polymerization (HCMPs) are useful for the adsorption of organic solvents and oils.270 By virtue of superhydrophobicity, HCMPs can adsorb oils and organic solvents and allow for the efficient separation of oils and organic solvents from water. The adsorption capacities for 1,2-dichlorobenzene are as high as 1569 wt% for HCMP-1 and 2300 wt% for HCMP-2. These results are interesting, as they suggest possible molecular sponges based on POPs. Later, our group synthesized a highly hydrophobic porphyrin-based porous PCPF-1 (porous covalent porphyrin framework) via the Yamamoto reaction of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)-porphyrin, with a contact angle of 135°.269 PCPF-1, with a BET surface area of 1333 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.86 cm3 g−1, exhibits the highest capacities for saturated hydrocarbons and gasoline among sorbent materials reported to date. For example, the adsorbed amounts of n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane are 456, 623, 752, 737, 909, and 1030 mg g−1, respectively, at 298 K and at their individual saturation pressures. The PCPF-1 sample (1 g) can adsorb 14.7 g of n-pentane, 16.7 g of n-hexane, 22.5 g of n-heptane, 25.9 g of n-octane, 15.4 g of cyclopentane, 25.1 g of cyclohexane and 20.5 g of gasoline. PCPF-1 allows for the recovery of oil from water.
Additionally, the filters used in gas masks, which give protection against toxic industrial chemicals, are often large and cumbersome, being made from activated carbon that is impregnated with metal salts. In a search for alternatives, SonBinh Nguyen and colleagues investigated a series of porous organic polymers (POPs) bearing metal–catecholate groups.289 By changing the molecular components used in their synthesis, the materials have been tailored to hydrogen bond to, and consequently eliminate, specific toxic industrial chemicals, like ammonia. This synthetic versatility may ultimately result in polymer adsorbents that are better than the present state-of-the-art activated carbon materials, for specific target chemicals. The challenge now is to merge these highly desirable features together to generate robust, tunable materials that can be tailored for different applications.
Insoluble polymers of β-cyclodextrin, an inexpensive, sustainably produced macrocycle of glucose, are likewise of interest for removing micro-pollutants from water by means of adsorption. β-Cyclodextrin is known to encapsulate pollutants to form well-defined host–guest complexes, but until now cross-linked β-cyclodextrin polymers have had low surface areas and poor removal performance compared to conventional activated carbons. Dichtel and co-workers crosslinked β-cyclodextrin with rigid aromatic groups, providing a high surface area, mesoporous polymer of β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 31).284 It rapidly sequesters a variety of organic micro-pollutants with adsorption rate constants 15 to 200 times greater than those of activated carbons and non-porous β-cyclodextrin adsorbent materials. In addition, the polymer can be regenerated several times using a mild washing procedure with no loss in performance. Finally, the polymer outperformed a leading activated carbon for the rapid removal of a complex mixture of organic micro-pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate the promise of porous β-cyclodextrin-based polymers for rapid, flow-through water treatment.

2.4.3 Capture for nuclear energy and nuclear waste remediation. 
There are also environmental incentives for the capture and reuse of certain metals. For example, uranium is the main fuel source for nuclear energy, which can mitigate global warming since it emits far fewer greenhouse gases during electricity generation than coal or other traditional power plants. However, alternative methods are required for uranium extraction due to the limited terrestrial reserves. Thus, the exploration of uranium recovery from seawater, the largest known resource, has received continued attention from researchers. The hurdles associated with uranium extraction from seawater are mainly from the extremely low concentration of uranium (∼3.3 ppb) along with the large volume of seawater with high concentrations of competing ions. This leads to a need for adsorbents with rapid kinetics, high adsorption uptake capacities, and high selectivity.
To tackle these issues, Dai and colleagues synthesized a hierarchical microporous-mesoporous ATRP initiator (Fig. 32).290 The solvothermal polymerization of vinylbenzyl chloride and divinylbenzene, with controlled ratios for optimal performance, created an accessible framework and available chloride groups for the growth of polyacrylonitrile. This was then subsequently converted into polyamidoxime for uranium recovery from seawater. Preliminary work was done to screen adsorbents with varying degrees of grafting, with the best reaching 1.99 mg U (gAds)−1, much higher than that of irradiation-grafted nonwoven polyethylene fabric (0.75 mg U (gAds)−1). The material also showed rapid kinetics, with 90% of the removal within 10 days, reaching higher than most adsorbents obtain in 30 days.

On the other side, disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the Achilles' heel of the industry. The harmful effects of nuclear radiation on humans and the environment can be readily witnessed due to the extremely long half-lives of some radioactive wastes. Of particular concern is 129I (half-life of 15.7 million years), which remains radioactive after a few thousand years. Although radionuclide 131I is short-lived (half-life of 8.02 days), it is highly volatile and notable for causing mutations and death in the penetrated cells. Considering its negative effects and the normal biological need for iodine in medical sciences, it is urgent to explore effective adsorbents for their safe and long-term capture and storage.
In order to facilitate the development of nuclear energy, a new kind of nitrogen-rich triptycene-based porous polymer (NTP) with a high surface area of up to 1067 m2 g−1 was synthesized by a modified Yamamoto-type Ullmann cross-coupling reaction as an iodine sorbent for effective enrichment of radiological iodine (Fig. 33).280 Having structural features of expanded conjugated area and nitrogen atoms doping in polymer networks, the NTP displays an extraordinary gas storage ability and excellent iodine adsorption capability. NTP shows high adsorption capacities for iodine with a maximum uptake of 180 wt%.

Ding and Han reported a novel porous azo-bridged porphyrin–phthalocyanine network via a catalyst free coupling reaction between H2TPP(NO2)4 and NiPc(NH2)4 (Fig. 34).282 AzoPPN has a BET specific surface area of 400 m2 g−1 as well as permanent microporosity, and the abundant azo-linkages in the skeleton endow the polymer with high CO2/N2 selectivity. Moreover, this porous structure along with the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units in the network as effective sorption sites could greatly enhance the affinity for iodine both physically and chemically. Therefore, AzoPPN exhibits an excellent adsorption capacity of 290 wt% towards iodine vapor, which is among the highest loading amounts for iodine adsorbents. The porosity and the π-electron-enriched framework of AzoPPN make it a competing porous adsorbents for iodine capture in both vapor and solution. This type of adsorbents will bring new application possibilities for efficient iodine capture and storage.

2.5 Chemosensor
Conjugated POPs are fascinating materials with π-conjugation and light-emitting properties that allow for the detection of various chemicals.285,291–296 Specific sites that interact with target compounds can be introduced into conjugated chains to enhance the interaction interface and improve the signaling activity. Additionally, conjugated POPs are differentiated from most other porous solids because it is possible to tune their electronic and photo-physical properties, for example by modifying the optical band-gap, as for linear, nonporous conjugated polymers.297 In this context, conjugated POPs are attractive candidates because they possess large surface areas and provide a broad interface for analyte interaction.
Jiang and coworkers reported the first example of a chemosensing CMP (conjugated microporous polymer), which emits blue luminescence at 468 nm.298 The condensation of a carbazole derivative, TCB, leads to the synthesis of a conjugated microporous polymer (TCB-CMP) that exhibits blue luminescence and possesses a large surface area. Compared with a linear polymer analogue, the TCB-CMP showed enhanced detection sensitivity and allowed for the rapid detection of arenes upon exposure to their vapors. The TCB-CMP displayed prominent fluorescence enhancement in the presence of electron-rich arene vapors and drastic fluorescence quenching in the presence of electron-deficient arene vapors, and it could be reused without a loss of sensitivity and responsiveness.
Similarly, Jiang and coworkers developed a methodology using electropolymerization for the synthesis of thin CMP films (Fig. 35).299 The thickness of these films is synthetically controllable, ranging from nanometers to micrometers, and they are obtained on substrates or as freestanding films. The CMP films combine a number of striking physical properties, including high porosity, extended π conjugation, facilitated exciton delocalization, and high-rate electron transfer. The authors explored the CMP films as versatile platforms for highly sensitive and label-free chemo- and biosensing of electron-rich and electron-poor arenes, metal ions, dopamine, and hypochloroic acid, featuring rapid response, excellent selectivity, and robust reusability. For example, upon exposure to the vapor of benzonitrile (BN) for only 20 s, the fluorescence of the CMP films was significantly quenched. Interestingly, the fluorescence-off chemosensing was not specific to BN, but was widely applicable to other electron-deficient arenes. The CMP films exhibited an enhanced response to 1,2-dinitrobenzene (DNB) with 75% of the fluorescence quenched upon exposure for 20 s. Notably, 87% of the fluorescence was quenched upon exposure to hexafluorobenzene (HFB) for 20 s. The most explicit quenching of fluorescence was observed with 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ). A 20 s exposure resulted in a 92% loss of fluorescence. After 120 s exposure, the fluorescence of CMP films was completely quenched.

Fig. 36 illustrates that Liu and coworkers synthesized a luminescent conjugated microporous polymer through a carbon–carbon coupling reaction using triarylboron and triphenylamine as structural units.285 The new polymer framework has a high specific surface area (950 m2 g−1), large pore volume, and good stability. Subsequently, owing to the strong charge transfer from triphenylamine to triphenylboron moieties, the boron-based conjugated microporous polymer (BCMP-3) exhibits a strong luminescence phenomenon with high absolute quantum yield (18%) in the solid state under excitation. The combination of strong fluorescence emission, excellent porosity, and plentiful boron activated sites in the skeleton, the polymer framework can serve as a functional chemosensor for selectively detecting trace amounts of F− over other common anions. Particularly, the triphenylboron-based conjugated microporous framework exhibits excellent performance for F− removal based on Lewis acid–base interactions between boron and fluoride atoms. F− uptake was dependent on the initial concentration and adsorption temperature. The kinetic data conformed to the pseudo-second-order model and the equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir model. More importantly, the polymer framework also displays good recyclability and reusability for F− removal.

Rapid and selective detection of nitroaromatic explosives has become one of the most pressing issues, because nitroaromatic explosives are serious pollution sources of water and important chemical species in minefields, munitionary remediation sites, military, and security applications. Currently, nitroaromatic derivatives are being used world-wide to prepare different explosives. Among them, the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA) has become very popular as it is widely used in dyes, fireworks, glass, and leather industries. During commercial production and use, PA is released into the environment, leading to the contamination of soil and aquatic biosystems. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and reliable sensor for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives, especially for PA, owing to their serious pollution and potential threats to security.300
In this regard, Cao and coworkers synthesized two porous luminescent COPs by copolymerization (Fig. 37).293 The two COPs possess high thermal stability and good luminescence intensities. Moreover, the two COPs show fast response and high sensitivity for detection of nitroaromatic explosives, especially for PA. In particular, KSV[PA] of COP-301 and COP-401 for PA reaches 2.6 × 105 and 8.3 × 104, respectively. Furthermore, both COP-401 and COP-301 exhibit not only high sensitivity for PA at a low concentration of about 1 ppm, but also extremely high selectivity for PA, which suggests that the COPs are promising luminescent probes for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives, especially for PA.

Light-emitting, nanofibrous films have been successfully fabricated by electrospinning CMP/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) mixtures (Fig. 38).294 The resulting nanofibrous films show a high flexibility combined with high porosity and surface area-to-volume ratios. The CMP-based nanofibrous films have been used as sensitive sensors in the detection of nitroaromatic and benzoquinone vapors as well as oxidizing metal ions. Moreover, 4-iodophenyl-substituted graphene sheets were used as templates for growing CMP/graphene sandwiches. The graphene-based CMP (G-CMP) sandwiches are characterized by aspect ratios and high surface areas. Furthermore, hierarchically porous two-dimensional carbon nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of these carbon-rich G-CMP hybrids. Importantly, the resulting carbon nanomaterials show excellent supercapacitor behavior with a 48% increased capacitance if compared to porous carbons without the graphene template. The incorporated graphene scaffolds favor an effective inter/intralayer electron transport, resulting in an improved ion injection/extraction from or to the electrodes and an improved energy storage capacity.

In addition to the above mentioned work, Cooper and coworkers adopted an alternative doping strategy to vary photophysical properties by using just a small amount of a co-monomer dopant (Fig. 39).297 This allows the fluorescence of a native polyphenylene network to be controlled by introducing low loadings (0.1–5 mol%) of an acceptor co-monomer such as benzothiadiazole (BT), bisthiophenebenzothiadiazole (TBT), and perylenediimide (PDI). As expected, fluorescence quantum yields are around 10 times higher than those of analogous non-porous polymers because of avoidance of chain aggregation in the porous network. White emitting CMPs with high quantum yields are prepared using this approach. Different domain structures can be prepared by changing the addition sequence of the monomers, and this has a strong effect on the fluorescence properties. This preliminary demonstration regarding doped porous polymers can also be used as fluorescent sensors for volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

3. Conclusions
This review has focused on the considerable progress in the development of a wide range of applications for porous organic polymers, including gas storage/separation, catalysis, environmental remediation, and sensing, with emphasis on how to tailor the pore structures and to customize the functionalities inside the framework or on the pore surface.
The advantages of porous organic polymers are their high tailorability in terms of compositions, internal structures, and properties, making possible their rational design for any specific application. Future research, which will involve researchers of many different fields, will certainly expand the scope of properties and applications for porous organic polymers dependent on their use for practical applications.
A major challenge is then to develop porous organic polymers with highly dispersed active sites301 and better understand the existing ones to generate surface sites with a known coordination sphere, thus facilitating structure–activity relationship studies. An example of this issue is the surface organometallic chemistry that shows promise for fabricating and structuring these materials on surfaces. This strategy has not been widely explored. Meanwhile, continued effort should be made to develop procedures that permit scalable preparation of porous organic polymers using environmentally friendly and low cost methods, since large volume production is a prerequisite for many potential applications.
This field is becoming more interdisciplinary with contributions from scientists and researchers from different areas, such as chemistry, materials science, physics, and engineering, especially when the design of products for specific potential applications is involved. Such interactions will facilitate the further advancement of porous organic polymers. It is anticipated that this review will engender interest in acquiring a basic understanding of functional porous organic polymers and assist in the judicious design of porous polymers with tailor-made pore architectures and functionalities.

 	Fig. 15  “Bottom-up” construction of the TADDOL-embedded chiral porous polymer (TADDOL-CPP) through a concise three-step route. As shown in the X-ray single-crystal structure of the functional building block 4, the four benzene rings are positioned as butterfly wings, which could offer the steric shielding for asymmetric catalysis. To investigate the cooperative nature of the working catalyst for the asymmetric addition reaction of Et2Zn to aromatic aldehydes, the TADDOL-CPP was further treated with [Ti(OiPr)4] to afford the TADDOL-CPP/Ti (see the main text for details).
