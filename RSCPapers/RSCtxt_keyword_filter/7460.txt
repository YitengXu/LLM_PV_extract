, Accepted 8th June 2016First published on 16th June 2016AbstractZinc oxide (ZnO) has been demonstrated to be a superb electron selective contact material in photovoltaic devices for its high electron mobility and various accessible nanostructures. However, issues of severe charge recombination and thermal instability occurring at the perovskites/ZnO interface hinder its application on perovskite solar cells. Herein, we report a strategy of TiO2 passivation onto the surface of ZnO nanorods (NRs) using a wet-chemical method, where a device structure FTO/ZnO NRs/TiO2 passivation layer/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag is adopted. Based on the proposed strategy, an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.49% is achieved mainly due to the improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, shirt-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.69 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.64, which are much higher than those of bare ZnO NRs-based devices. Interestingly, TiO2 passivated samples show much better long-term device stability than those without passivation, where TiO2 acts as a buffer layer with improved thermal stability owning to reduced chemisorbed hydroxyl groups as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work on introducing organometallic halide perovskite materials into dye-sensitized solar cells done by Miyasaka et al., perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) boosts from preliminary 3.8% to 22.1% in early 2016.1,2 The superb performance of PSCs has been attributed to its striking electrical and optical properties such as extremely high absorption coefficient over visible spectrum,3 low nonradiative recombination rates,3,4 long-balanced carriers' diffusion lengths,4 and tunable optical bandgap.5 High-quality perovskite films can be achieved both by solution-processed and vacuum-processed methods,6–8 which have been employed on the planar heterojunction structure as well as the mesoscopic structure, and both lead to highly efficient PSCs devices.9–11
The electron selective contact (ESC) plays a significant role in suppressing charge recombination and enhancing electron extraction, consequently in determining PSCs device final performance.12 TiO2 has been demonstrated to be an efficient ESC material in both planar and mesoscopic PSCs.10,13 Nevertheless, ZnO remains to be a promising candidate for ESC materials in solar cells owning to its high electron mobility which is far superior to that of TiO2,14 and its application on PSCs has been investigated in the form of thin films15 and nanorods (NRs).16–18 Some efforts have been made to improve the performance of ZnO-based PSCs devices by doping19,20 or surface modification.17,21,22
It is noted that perovskite films tend to decompose into PbI2 upon annealing on the ZnO surface due to proton-transfer reactions accelerated by residual hydroxyl groups or acetate ligands.21,23 To improve the device stability, Tsang et al.21 adopted a polymeric buffer layer of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) to separate ZnO and perovskite films, and demonstrated thermal stable PSCs devices with a PCE over 10%. Wang et al.24 reported a CH3NH3PbBr3-based PSCs device exhibiting enhanced thermal stability by employing a ZnO/CdS core–shell nanoarray as the ESC layer.
Here we propose a layer by layer absorption and reaction (LBLAR) method25 to realize surface passivation of ZnO NRs photoanode by coating a thin TiO2 layer. A PCE of 13.49% is achieved by employing a ∼5 nm TiO2 passivation layer on the surface of ZnO NRs, which is much higher than that of unpassivated samples. Besides, devices based on TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs show tremendously improved Voc and FF, which are attributed to reduced back electron transfer and charge recombination. It is noteworthy that TiO2 passivation makes ZnO NRs based PSCs get rid of thermal instability during annealing to some extent, and behave enhanced device stability during aging test, which can be explained by the reduced residual hydroxyl groups on the photoanode due to TiO2 passivation as demonstrated by the XPS results.21
2. Experimental section
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, 99.5%), CH3NH3I (MAI, 95%) were purchased from Weihua-Solar. Other reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent.
Growth of ZnO NRs and TiO2 passivation
ZnO NRs were prepared on a ZnO seed layer by a liquid phase deposition method as reported in our previous work.25,26 FTO substrates were first coated with a ZnO seed layer via a sol–gel method,26 then immersed in the growth solution containing equal moles of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (0.05 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (0.05 M) in DI water at 95 °C for 80 min, where the FTO side was placed facedown. After that, the ZnO NRs films were rinsed with DI water and ethanol, then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. TiO2 passivation layer was deposited on the surface of the ZnO NRs using a LBLAR method.25 The as-prepared ZnO NRs film was successively immersed in TiO2 sol,25 ethanol and DI water for 45 s respectively, such a cycle was repeated for 10 times followed by a 30 min annealing process at 550 °C.
Solar cell fabrication
FTO substrates were patterned by etching with Zn powder and HCl aqueous solution. The as-etched substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in Hellmanex detergent diluted in DI water, DI water, acetone and ethanol, then subjected to a UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. A perovskite layer was deposited on the ZnO NRs with or without TiO2 passivation by a one-step spin-coating method according to our previous report.8 To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, equal moles of PbI2 (1 M) and CH3CH3I (1 M) were dissolved in a mixture of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a volume ratio of 3:7 at 70 °C by stirring overnight. The obtained solution was filtered with the PTFE filter (0.45 μm), and spin-coated on substrates at 1000 rpm for 5 s and at 3000 rpm for 30 s. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with 130 μl chlorobenzene drop-casting. Then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, a hole transport layer was coated on the perovskite layer by spin-coating a stock solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s, where 1 ml spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (72.3 mg ml−1) solution was added with 28.8 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 35 μl Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg ml−1) solution. Finally, a silver electrode was deposited on the top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The ZnO NRs/TiO2 core–shell nanostructure was observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL Inc., Japan). A field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta F250, JEOL Inc., Japan) was employed to observe morphological properties of the films and devices. Crystalline structures of the films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2400 X Series, Rigaku, Japan). The chemical compositions of ZnO NRs with and without TiO2 passivation were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher).
The measurement of current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics was performed on a PVIV-201V I-V Station (Newport Oriel), the light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun using a Si reference cell (91150V, Newport). The J–V curves were recorded by reverse scan (1.2 V → −0.3 V) at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The incident photo-to-electron efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded by a Qtest Station 1000ADX system (Growntech, Inc.) at AC mode, the excitation beam was chopped at approximately 180 Hz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai).
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of ZnO NRs, including length and diameter, can be controlled by the hydrothermal growth process. In consideration of extremely high absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films, the optimization of the length of ZnO NRs was conducted shorter than 1 μm. Fig. 1a and c show the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the optimized ZnO NRs, respectively. The optimized length of ZnO NRs for PSCs devices is approximately 700 nm, rendering enough light harvesting distance for perovskite films while restraining transport resistance as low as possible. Besides, it is accessible for perovskites materials to well fill nanorods due to its relative thin film. As shown in Fig. 1b, the average diameter of NRs increases from ∼48 nm to ∼57 nm after TiO2 passivation. TiO2 passivation also makes NRs surface rougher, which means increased surface area and better interfacial contact for perovskite films deposition, consequently, enhanced light harvesting is achieved.22

To investigate the nanostructure of TiO2 shell on ZnO NRs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are conducted, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. It is revealed from TEM image that a uniform TiO2 shell is fully coated on the ZnO NRs, indicating a decent separation of ZnO from deposited perovskite films, and avoiding their direct contact. As a result, improved thermal stability is demonstrated in PSCs devices based on TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs with respect to unpassivated samples considering that TiO2 is more stable than ZnO. Fig. 1f of HRTEM provides us a clear observation of TiO2 shell on NRs, with a thickness of about 5 nm. The edge of ZnO/TiO2 surface is marked by a yellow dashed line. As mentioned previously, after TiO2 passivation, surface of NRs becomes rough (Fig. 1b and e) in stark contrast to the quite smooth bare ZnO NRs, which can be clearly seen in Fig. S1† of its TEM image.
Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs. The major XRD peak is indexed to the (002) plane of ZnO, indicating an oriental growth along c-axis. The thickness of TiO2 is so thin that no XRD peak for it can be observed. The chemical compositions of TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs were investigated by using XPS. Fig. 3a shows the resolution of Zn 2p XPS spectra, with two peaks centered at 1021.3 eV and 1044.4 eV, which are ascribed to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, two main peaks located at 458.3 eV and 464.1 eV correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 level in TiO2,27,28 respectively, which confirm the existence of TiO2 on nanorods. To get insight of the impact of TiO2 passivation on surface properties of the photoanode, O 1s core level XPS spectra of TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs and annealed bare ZnO NRs were recorded and shown in Fig. 3c and d. Tsang et al. suggested that the ratio of O in metal oxide and O in hydroxide derived from XPS spectra can be used to quantify their amounts, and that the suppressed decomposition of perovskite films should be attributed to reduced chemisorbed hydroxyl groups derived from thermal annealing.21 It is obviously that TiO2 passivation further lower the ratio of chemisorbed hydroxyl groups with respect to thermal annealing, which should account for the improved thermal stability of perovskite films, as well as the enhanced device stability.

Here we compare the thermal stability of perovskites films on NRs photoanode with and without TiO2 passivation from both macroscopic and crystallography perspectives. As-deposited perovskites films with different photo-anodes were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min, and during this process the color of films changed, indicating a crystallization or decomposition transformation. Perovskites films on ZnO/TiO2 just turned dark brown after the annealing process, while the one on bare ZnO first turned brown, then changed toward partially yellow. As shown in Fig. 4, the XRD was also conducted to reveal what would happen to MAPbI3 films on different substrates when thermal annealing was carried out. Fig. 4a shows the XRD pattern of the perovskite film on as-prepared ZnO NRs (without anneal), a notable XRD peak at 12.7° is indexed to the (001) plane of PbI2, suggesting a severe decomposition of MAPbI3 films into PbI2, along with CH3NH2 and H2O vapor.21 However, it is revealed from Fig. 4b and c that both thermal annealing and TiO2 passivation take effect on suppressing decomposition of perovskite films, which is consistent with the results of XPS as mentioned previously.

Fig. 5a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a PSCs device. Sol–gel method-derived seed layers facilitate better oriental growth of ZnO NRs, and act as the hole-blocking layer as well. A one-step method was adopted to deposit MAPbI3 films on nanorods arrays. MAPbI3 precursor was first dropped on nanorods, then ahead of starting spin-coating program, a 30 s waiting process was employed to allow full infiltration of perovskites materials into nanorods films. Fig. S2† presents a cross-sectional SEM image with higher magnification. There is no obvious void between perovskites films and nanorods arrays, indicating good pore-infiltration of perovskites materials. The relative energy level alignment in the PSCs devices is illustrated in Fig. 5b.29 The conduction band of TiO2 is slightly higher than that of ZnO, which facilitates the electron injection to ZnO while hindering the back electron transfer process. From another perspective, considering that TiO2 is generally n-type doped and ZnO is more heavily doped, a n–n+ heterojunction is likely to be formed at ZnO/TiO2 interface,30 where a built-in electrical field vastly reduces the electron concentration near ZnO/TiO2 interface and retard interfacial recombination. As a result, increased Voc and FF are to be expected.22,31

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and incident photo-to-electron efficiency (IPCE) are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively, where the photovoltaic performance of PSCs devices based on ZnO NRs with and without TiO2 passivation are compared. Detailed parameters extracted from J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. Particularly, the device with TiO2 passivation layer yields significant increments in Voc, FF, and corresponding PCE, with Voc of 1.02 V, FF of 63.8%, Jsc of 20.69 mA cm−2 and PCE of 13.49%. On the contrary, a relative low PCE of 9.97% is achieved by the unpassivated sample due to its poor performance on Voc of 0.86 V, and on FF of 58.9%. In addition, an increased current density was observed and presented in Fig. 6a for TiO2 passivated samples, even though it is unobvious relative to the increase of Voc and FF. UV-vis transmittance spectra of ZnO and ZnO/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 7a, both of which demonstrate superior transmittance of visible light. As shown in Fig. 7b, perovskites films on ZnO/TiO2 behave better in light harvesting in consistent with above analysis. If considering light absorption only, larger interfacial area enhanced light-harvesting makes the main contribution to the increase of current density in this case. On the contrary, simply coating a TiO2 layer on ZnO has a trend to lower photocurrent considering that ZnO behaves more effective in charge collection compared with TiO2.16 Overall photo-current change is a joint product of enhanced light harvesting due to rougher surface and less effective charge collection process at TiO2/perovskites interface. A thorough consideration of advantages and disadvantages caused by coating TiO2 can help us understand the overall trend of current density changes. In this case, a slightly increased photocurrent can be obtained for TiO2 passivated samples. IPCE spectra are compared in Fig. 6b, samples with TiO2 passivation shows a slightly higher quantum efficiency in contrast to those without passivation.

Fig. 6a also presents the J–V characteristics of two kinds of PSCs under dark condition. TiO2 passivated samples show considerable lower dark current and higher onset voltage, indicating enhanced hole blocking ability and reduced electron back transfer,32,33 which generate a higher Voc.34 Light intensity dependence of J–V curves is shown in Fig. 6c, and the corresponding Jsc is plotted as a function of light intensities ranging from 10 to 100 mW cm−2 in the inset of Fig. 6c. It is demonstrated that Jsc is approximately proportional to light intensity, suggesting no considerable energy barrier35 and space charge build-up36 in devices. In other words, the mobility of electrons and holes is nearly balanced in this PSCs device structure.37
To further study the charge transfer and recombination process in PSCs devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at a forward bias of 0.5 V, ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, as shown in Fig. 8a. Detailed parameters of equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 8a) are summarized in Table 2. A slightly decrease of series resistance (Rs) is obtained for passivated samples, indicating a better contact between the perovskite film and the ESC layer.12 Most significant impact of TiO2 passivation is observed for recombination resistance (Rrec) corresponding to low-frequency region in Nyquist plot,38 which has a negative correlation with recombination rate.12,39 It can be inferred that the increased Voc and FF should be ascribed to an increase of Rrec due to TiO2 passivation.33,38

As mentioned previously, TiO2 passivation effectively improves the thermal stability of perovskite films. To investigate its effect on device stability, devices were stored in a desiccator for over one week without further encapsulation, where the humidity fluctuated ranging from 10% to 20%. Photovoltaic tests were performed once a day under ambient conditions, and the normalized PCEs are plotted as a function of aging time in Fig. 8b. It is noted that devices based on bare ZnO NRs, whether annealed or not, exhibit poor tolerance of test process. It is apparently that the PCE of the TiO2 passivated sample (with a maximum PCE of 13.40%) shows only a 12% decrease after 150 h, as opposed to that of the unpassivated sample (with a maximum PCE of 9.97%), which degrades to less than 50%. We ascribe this enhanced device stability to TiO2 passivation, which can act as a buffer layer to avoid direct contact of perovskite films with ZnO NRs as noted before.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the efficiency and stability of ZnO NRs based perovskite solar cells were improved by introducing a TiO2 passivation layer. A thin and uniform TiO2 passivation layer was deposited on ZnO NRs by a LBLAR method, for which rougher surface and substantially increased Rrec indicated by IS measurement gave rise to enhanced performance, with Voc = 1.02 V, Jsc = 20.69 mA cm−2, FF = 63.8%, and resulting PCE = 13.49%. The improved thermal stability of perovskite films was obtained by TiO2 passivation. It is also demonstrated that the device stability of TiO2 passivated ZnO NRs based PSCs, as revealed in aging test over one week, is far better than unpassivated samples owing to reduced chemisorbed hydroxyl groups confirmed by XPS results. We believe that appropriate surface passivation can be realized by other semiconducting metal oxides to further improve the long-term stability of ZnO NRs based perovskite solar cells while maintaining a decent efficiency.
