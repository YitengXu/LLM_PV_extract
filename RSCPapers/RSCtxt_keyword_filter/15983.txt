    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 17th January 2019AbstractAlthough low-temperature selenization technology offers several advantages in terms of production costs and beneficial composition profile controlling for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, excellent performance has not yet been achieved primarily due to the increased number of electronic disorders, smaller grain sizes, and more grain boundaries. In this study, a universal strategy for significantly increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of low-temperature processed CZTSSe solar cells through directly dissolving the fluxing agent antimony into the as-prepared precursor solution is demonstrated. The key feature of this approach is that Sb atoms actually act without entering into the lattice and leave almost no residue within the absorber after taking effect. By appropriately adjusting the antimony incorporation concentration, the grain size, fine-grain layer thickness, local defect chemistry environment, and hole carrier concentration can be simultaneously improved, especially at low temperatures. More importantly, a larger band bending around the grain boundary (GB) is also observed by increasing the potential value from 40 mV to 100 mV after antimony incorporation, which can facilitate the GB-dominated carrier separation process. Due to the antimony-assisted morphology and enhancement in the nanoscale electrical properties, the CZTSSe device could maintain its performance at a lower temperature of 80 °C and directly decrease the selenization temperature down to 470 °C. This systematic study presents a new aspect for overcoming the challenges encountered at low temperatures, and our findings further support the great feasibility for the future application of low-temperature-processed CZTSSe photovoltaic technology to meet the industrial-scale production standards.
1. Introduction
Following development over the past few years, thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies are becoming increasingly competitive with conventional crystalline silicon solar cells, both in terms of production cost and PV conversion efficiency. Since the price of commercial silicon modules is decreasing dramatically as low as 0.4 $ per Wp, low-cost and high throughput next-generation solar cells are critically desired.1–3 Under this impending situation, the identified kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising candidates with the potential to replace their well-developed predecessor Cu(In,Ga)Se2 due to the use of earth-abundant raw materials and their impressive photovoltaic performance.4–7 Although a state-of-the-art conversion efficiency of 12.6% has been achieved by the hydrazine solution-processed method,8 most of the reported high-efficiency CZTSSe devices were generally formed at annealing temperatures higher than 550 °C to merge the precursor particles into large grains under the existence of liquid phase Cu2–xSe.9 Such high annealing temperatures, however, can result in a strong thermal expansion mismatch between the CZTSSe film and Mo electrode,10 a thicker MoSe2 layer,11 uniform composition distribution, and high energy consumption.12 More importantly, SnS becomes volatile at high temperature, thereby inducing the crystalized CZTSSe to decompose backwards into the binary phases.13–15 The current annealing condition, thus, makes the future application of CZTSSe photovoltaic technology rather incompatible with industrial-scale production standards.
In theory, the formation of the quaternary kesterite phase is more energetically favorable at lower temperature.16 Nevertheless, in fact, a low selenization temperature (≤500 °C) will yield an increased number of electronic disorders, smaller grain sizes, and more grain boundaries, which can act as recombination centers for photogenerated carriers, leading to degradation of the device performance.17 To address these challenges encountered in low-temperature-processed CZTSSe PV devices, vigorous efforts have been devoted to forming low-melting-point chalcogenides during selenization, which can serve as a fluxing agent and promote the crystal growth of CZTSSe films. Here, alkali and metal cationic elements (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cd, and Ge) are usually added into the CZTSSe absorber to improve the grain growth and the relevant cell performance.18–24 However, most of these elements need to be incorporated into the crystal lattice to take effect, and this energetic requirement leads to the high-efficiency devices still being prepared around 550 °C. Previous reports have shown that the diffusion of Na and K into the CZTSSe absorber is highly diminished and the grain size is decreased under a low selenization temperature.25 Another method proposed by Prof. Yang's group consisted of co-sputtering a SnS2–ZnS–Cu precursor followed by a two-stage annealing process.26 In this approach, the precursor SnS2 aids readily forming the CZTSSe phase at low temperature, and this is followed by a short high-temperature annealing stage for grain growth and SnS secondary phase removal. Similarly, Prof. Pan reported a phase-separation strategy by controlling the Cu, Zn, and Sn precursor solution at +1, +2, and +2 ionic states to form a ternary Cu2S/ZnS/SnS hybrid thin film.27 Despite the above two strategies being able to facilitate the growth of CZTSSe large grains very well, neither of them could eliminate the need for the high-temperature annealing process and thus the volatilization of SnS is still hard to control. To the best of our knowledge, the incorporation of Ag is the only effective strategy to decrease the melting temperature and to reduce the structural defects of the CZTSSe absorber at the same time.28–30 In our previous work, a 11.2% conversion efficiency with a selenization temperature of 480 °C was demonstrated by adjusting the Ag gradient appropriately.29 However, the electrical conductivity of the CZTSSe film dropped dramatically after Ag substitution and a lower carrier concentration could not support the further performance improvement continuously. The search for a more efficient fluxing agent at low temperature is thus becoming more and more urgent.
Concerning the relative development of high-efficiency or low-temperature-processed Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices, the Sb-based compound is often incorporated to reduce the material melting point, to increase the ionic mobility, and to promote the diffusion-controlled crystallization.31,32 Unfortunately, its application has not received sufficient attention in CZTSSe solar cell research yet. The most outstanding work related to Sb-assisted crystal growth in CZTSSe devices was presented by Prof. Pan's group in 2015.33 While their work was mainly focused on the investigation of absorber morphology evolution, a physical effect mechanism for the associated electrical characteristics improvement was not proposed. Besides, by just inserting a thin Sb2S3 layer in the middle of the precursor films, the Sb diffusion is hard to control and cannot take effect very well.
Herein, the detailed physical origin of the antimony-assisted performance enhancement for CZTSSe PV technology was systematically investigated by directly dissolving Sb2O3 into an as-prepared precursor solution. Different antimony incorporation concentrations and selenization temperatures were tested to explore the optimum annealing condition. It turned out that the Sb atoms actually act without entering into the lattice, but with the effect of enhancing the crystallinity, reducing the fine-grain layer thickness, suppressing defects and secondary phase formation, and increasing the hole-carrier concentration simultaneously, especially at low temperature. More important, benefitting from the local defect chemistry environment improvement, we also found that the antimony incorporation could induce a larger band bending around the grain boundary (GB), which could thus facilitate the GB-dominated carrier separation. Consequently, the Sb-incorporated CZTSSe devices directly allowed decreasing the selenization temperature down to 470 °C, yet still exhibited a comparable photoelectricity conversion efficiency in comparison to that of the devices commonly fabricated at 550 °C. We believe that this work could draw much attention to the in-depth understanding of the effects of fluxing agents in CZTSSe PV technology, and the performance enhancement we achieved here has inspired us to believe that antimony incorporation is an effective project to pave the way for the future development of CZTSSe solar cells fabricated by low-temperature processing.
2. Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Cu (copper, 99.9%), Zn (zinc, 99.99%), S (sublimed sulfur, 99.95%), CdSO4·8/3H2O (cadmium sulfate, 99%), and NH2CSNH2 (thiourea, 99%) were purchased from Aladdin Co. Sn (tin, 99.8%), HSCH2CH2SH (1,2-ethanedithiol, 98+%), H2NCH2CH2NH2 (1,2-ethylenediamine, 99%), and Sb2O3 (antimony oxide, 99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Se (selenium, 99+%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Se particles (99.999%) were purchased from ZhongNuo Advanced Material Technology Co. NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide, 25–28%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used directly as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of the precursor solution
The CZTSSe precursor solution was prepared by a previously reported pure elements method.15,34 Typically, 1.09 mmol Cu, 0.76 mmol Zn, 0.76 mmol Sn, 2.6 mmol S, and 0.3 mmol Se were added simultaneously into a 30 mL sample bottle. Then, 0.5 mL 1,2-ethanedithiol and 5 mL 1,2-ethylenediamine were injected into the bottle. Next, the bottle was kept magnetically stirring at 70 °C in a heating jacket until the solids were completely dissolved. The above synthesis process of the precursor solution was done in a glovebox under nitrogen protection. To investigate the temperature-dependent Sb effect, different Sb incorporation amounts (1 mol%, 2 mol%, and 4 mol% relative to the moles of CZTSSe) were tested by adding Sb2O3 into the precursor solution. Note that the Sb addition amount was controlled below 4 mol%, because a strong thermal expansion mismatch would be induced between the absorber and Mo substrate at a higher Sb incorporation level.
Preparation of the thin films
The precursor solution was spin-coated on the soda lime glass, which was covered by a 600 nm molybdenum layer on top, at 3000 rpm for 20 s and then heated under 330 °C for 3 min to evaporate the organic residues. This procedure was repeated several times until the precursor film attained a 1.6 μm thickness. All the above operations were carried out in a glove box filled with an argon atmosphere, with an oxygen and water content below 1 ppm. Then, the precursor film and abundant Se particles were placed into a graphite box and next annealed in a rapid thermal processor (RTP) furnace. During this annealing process, the temperature was kept at 380 °C for 20 min, and then remained under the target temperature (550 °C, 510 °C, or 470 °C) for 15 min for selenization. This additional 380 °C holding stage was necessary to promote the incorporated Sb atoms taking effect and to obtain a better grain morphology. Also, it is to be noted that the CZTSSe films with and without Sb incorporation were selenized separately to eliminate the influence of the volatile Sb-based atmosphere on the untreated samples.
Solar cell device fabrication
The CZTSSe devices were generally fabricated based on the standard structure of Ag/ITO/i-ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe/Mo/glass. At first, the selenized absorber was rinsed with DI water and then put into NH4OH/CdSO4 solution at 65 °C for chemical bath deposition (CBD) until the CdS layer covered surface became bluish purple. Next, a 70 nm i-ZnO layer and 200 nm ITO layer were sequentially deposited on top by magnetron sputtering. A 100 nm Ag grid was thermally evaporated as the contact electrode. Finally, the fabricated sample was divided into nine small devices with an active area of 0.21 cm2.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Nova NanoSEM 450 field emission scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 15.4 Å). Raman measurements were conducted using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope using an excitation laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The valence states of Cu, Zn, and Sn were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), with the spectra recorded with a thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an Al Kα monochromatized source. Binding energies were shifted using the common C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were tested using a Xe-based light source solar simulator from Newport (with simulated AM 1.5G illumination) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed by an SPA400 atomic force microscopy (AFM) system purchased from Seiko Instruments Inc. The non-contact mode was applied under an AC voltage with the amplitude of 1.0 V and frequency of 75 kHz. The scanning area was 3 × 3 μm2 and the scanning rate was 0.7 Hz. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves were collected from −1 to 0 V using an HERA-DLTS system (Phys Tech).
3. Result and discussion
Since hydrazine is toxic and explosive, we used the ethanedithiol–ethylenediamine solution system with strong reducibility in this work. Fig. 1 presents the top-view SEM images for CZTSSe films with Sb incorporation amounts of 0 mol%, 1 mol%, 2 mol%, and 4 mol% prepared under different selenization temperatures (470 °C, 510 °C, and 550 °C). As previously reported, Sb chemical incorporation could decrease the ion diffusion energy and ultimately promote the diffusion-controlled crystallization process. It was clearly observed that the average grain size of CZTSSe absorber at 470 °C was markedly smaller than that prepared at 550 °C. This poor crystalline morphology is often accompanied with much more grain boundaries and inferior electrical properties. After Sb incorporation, the average grain size gradually increased with increasing the Sb concentration. At an appropriate addition amount, the low-temperature-processed CZTSSe absorber could also present a densely packed and crack-free surface topography as well as that of the 550 °C commonly selenized films. Also, as for the 550 °C processed absorber, with increasing the Sb content, the CZTSSe grains became larger but more sparsely packed. The existence of much more cracks can lead to a larger leakage current and degrade PV performance. That is, Sb incorporation is necessary and beneficial for the low-temperature-processed CZTSSe devices, but may have detrimental influences on high-temperature-processed CZTSSe devices.

To further identify the influence of Sb incorporation on morphology evolution and element distribution, the typical cross-section images and EDS profiles of 510 °C-selenized CZTSSe films with 0 mol% and 2 mol% Sb content are shown in Fig. 2. Due to the abnormal grain growth, which occurs when the asymmetry growth of a subset grains have some advantages over the neighboring ones, the obtained CZTSSe absorber generally exhibited an obvious tri-layer morphology with the sandwich structure of large-grain layer/fine-grain layer/large-grain layer.35 It is well known that the large-grain layer is the effective absorber and contributes the most to the photoresponse, while the undesirable fine-grain middle layer has little photoresponse and will degrade the PCEs of CZTSSe solar cells by increasing the series resistance and carrier recombination centers.36,37 As seen in Fig. S1,† the thickness of the small-grained middle layer is obviously reduced after Sb incorporation. Meanwhile, the cross-section images of the 550 °C-, 510 °C-, and 470 °C-selenized CZTSSe films with 2 mol% Sb content in Fig. S2† indicate that the thickness of MoSe2 layer was also reduced with decreasing the temperature, which would be beneficial to the fill factor enhancement at lower temperature.

The top and bottom large-grain layers are highlighted by blue, and the middle fine-grain layer is highlighted by pink, respectively. (c) Schematic of the Sb-incorporation mechanism during the selenization process. Scale bar, 1 μm. 
To explore the Sb incorporation mechanism, the EDS profiles of CZTSSe films before and after Sb incorporation are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b. It can be observed that the element distributions of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and Se are almost unchanged over the whole cross-section and that the fine-grain middle layer generally exhibits a selenium-enriched status accompanied with a small amount of incompletely reacted Cu, Zn, and Sn.37 Nevertheless, the intensity of line scanning for the Sb element profile is very weak, and thus EDS spot scanning was further performed to confirm its existence within the tri-layered CZTSSe films. As seen in Fig. S3,† the antimony atomic percentages were 0%, 0.33%, and 0% for the large-grained top layer, fine-grain middle layer, and large-grained bottom layer, respectively. This low degree level suggests that atomic antimony is almost non-existent within both the large-grained layers and only a small amount of residuals remained in the fine-grain middle layer. Different from other fluxing agents, this characteristic phenomenon would be a key advantage for Sb incorporation. Based on our experimental results and previous reports, the probable Sb-assisted crystal growth mechanism in CZTSSe absorber is proposed in Fig. 2c. Generally, the Sb species act as nucleation centers and form a quasi-liquid sintering flux to promote atomic diffusion mass transfer and the formation of large CZTSSe grains.31–33 During the selenization process, some Sb-based compounds are evaporated to the gaseous state, and the remaining Sb species gradually migrate toward the middle fine-grain layer in a quasi-liquid phase.38 The reduced thickness of the small-grain layer after Sb incorporation further justifies this inference.
The crystal structures of different-temperature-selenized CZTSSe films before and after Sb incorporation were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as shown in Fig. 3. Apart from the characteristic peak of the molybdenum substrate (40.51° and 73.65°), all the diffraction peaks could be indexed on the basis of the tetragonal kesterite phase with crystal planes of (112), (204), and (312).39 There were no peak shifts after Sb incorporation, indicating that the antimony atom generally acts without entering into the crystal lattice. According to Scherrer's equation, the average crystalline sizes could be calculated from the full width half maximum (FWHM) of each crystal plane:40  where D, K, γ, β, and θ stand for the average crystalline sizes, the Scherrer constant (∼0.9), X-ray wavelength (λCu-Kα = 1.54 Å), FWHM in radians, and Bragg peak angle, respectively. Fig. 3b presents the FWHM and average crystalline size variation as a function of the different Sb-incorporation amounts at different temperatures. The calculated average crystalline sizes were orderly expanded with increasing the Sb content as well as the SEM morphology evolution. It is noteworthy that the average crystalline size (18.7 nm) of the normally 470 °C-processed CZTSSe films was much smaller than that of the 550 °C-processed sample (40.9 nm), while a 4 mol% Sb-incorporation content could evidently eliminate this gap and expand the crystalline size up to 35.1 nm, implying the possibility to fabricate an efficient CZTSSe device at low temperature. Furthermore, Tiwari et al. proposed that this Sb-assisted crystallinity enhancement could also decrease the disorder in specific lattice positions of the CZTSSe unit cell.41

Fig. S4† illustrates the Raman spectra with the excitation wavelength of 532 nm to further support the XRD results and to help identify the purity of the selenized CZTSSe films. It was found that all the distinctive peaks agreed well with the vibrational characteristics of the kesterite CZTSSe phase and no obvious signal of binary impurity phases was detected.42 The strong vibration peak of selenium atoms at around 197 cm−1 and weak vibration peak of sulfur atoms at around 329 cm−1 demonstrated that the S/(S + Se) ratio was very low in our samples.
Moreover, to investigate the valence states and chemical environment transformation within the CZTSSe absorber, highly surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also performed. Fig. 4 shows the narrow scan of 510 °C-selenized CZTSSe samples before and after Sb incorporation. The peak positions of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, and Sn 3d correspond well to the +1, +2, and +4 ionic states, respectively.43 No obvious peak shift was observed for the Cu, Zn, and Sn elements, indicating that substitution between the introduced Sb atom and native cations is absent, which is in accordance with the XRD results. Immediately from the detected Sn 3d3/2 peak, a shoulder Zn L3M45M45 Auger peak could be clearly observed for the untreated CZTSSe sample, implying the existence of a Zn-based secondary phase or defects.21,43,44 However, this signal of microimpurity disappeared after the incorporation of Sb, which suggests it may be ascribed to the accelerated ionic migration and reduced formation chemical potential of the kesterite phase. The as-detected defect chemical environment improvement will further facilitate the Sb-incorporated device to achieve a high performance.

The CZTSSe devices were generally fabricated based on the standard structure of Ag/ITO/i-ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe/Mo/glass. To better evaluate the effect of antimony incorporation on cell performance and to explore the optimal antimony addition content, different antimony atom concentrations and selenization temperatures were tested. Fig. 5 and Table 1 summarize the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) performance of different-temperature-selenized CZTSSe solar cells before and after antimony incorporation. The statistical distributions of the photovoltaic parameters derived from 10 devices for each type are also provided in Fig. S5.† As expected, the PV performance for devices without Sb incorporation kept degrading with decreasing temperature due to the poor crystalline morphology and much higher number of grain boundaries at lower temperature. After Sb incorporation, the cell performance showed an opposite tendency for different selenization temperatures. Arising from the observed SEM surface morphology, the generated cracks at 550 °C led to the device performance becoming worse and worse with the increasing Sb content. While for the 510 °C- and 470 °C-prepared devices, all the performance parameters of Jsc, Voc, and FF were dramatically enhanced at an appropriate Sb-addition amount. Benefitting from the Sb-assisted performance enhancement, the CZTSSe solar cells contributed a slightly higher efficiency (9.02%) at a 40 °C lower temperature and could even maintain their performance (8.20%) at an 80 °C lower temperature in comparison to that of the 550 °C commonly fabricated devices (8.61%). This exploratory work may become the direction for future CZTSSe PV technology development, and could help us to further construct a beneficial composition profile gradient that will have great potential in saving production costs and extending the substrate species upon which the CZTSSe absorber can be integrated.

As for the origin of the Sb-assisted performance improvement at low temperature, in our experience, the electrical properties enhancement is far more essential than the morphology evolution. Different from the p–i–n structured crystalline silicon solar cells, for which a monocrystal device achieved the highest record efficiency, the p–n structured polycrystal device contributed the top efficiency for CIGS, CZTS, and CdTe thin film solar cells. In these types of solar cells, more and more research studies have demonstrated that the grain boundaries (GBs)-dominated carrier transport plays a significant role in charge collection as well as the space electric field.45 Based on classic GB theory, the minority carriers (electrons) are collected at GBs and the majority carriers (holes) are repelled toward grain internals (GIs), forming a positive potential difference from GB to GI.46 Consequently, GBs act as current flow channels until electrons and holes achieve their corresponding collection electrode.47 KPFM measurement is a useful electrical technology to evaluate the potential distribution around GBs within our fabricated CZTSSe devices. Herein, the typical 510 °C-selenized CZTSSe films with Sb contents of 0 mol% and 2 mol% were selected for further advanced characterization.
The detected spatial maps of topography and surface potential for CZTSSe films are presented in Fig. 6 and the extracted line profiles of the morphology and potential values are also provided. It can be observed that both the CZTSSe films before and after Sb incorporation demonstrate higher surface potentials at the GBs, consistent with previous studies of commonly vacuum-deposited CZTSSe or CIGSe films.45,48,49 The high positive potential at the GBs corresponds to a downward band-bending in the energy band diagram, as seen in Fig. 7, which facilitates minority-carrier attraction and hole repulsion. Sb incorporation almost increases the GB potential value from 40 mV to 100 mV, suggesting a more efficient carrier-separation process will be induced. Although the reasons for this Sb-induced GB potential enhancement is still unclear, something that could be confirmed is that this carrier-separation improvement mechanism is different from that of the lithium-dopant-induced electric field polarity inversion by forming a wide band gap compound near the GBs. As observed in the XRD and XPS measurements, this result could be more likely ascribed to the improved local defect chemical environment and the decreased disorder in specific lattice positions of the CZTS unit cell.

Finally, capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling gave more direct evidence for the Sb-induced electrical properties enhancement in terms of the quantified free carrier density (NC–V), as seen in Fig. 8. The 510 °C-prepared CZTSSe devices with different Sb contents were also selected for discussion due to their excellent performance. According to the following equation:50  where C, q, A, ε0, and εs stand for the measured capacitance, electron charge (∼1.602 × 10−19 C), active device area (0.21 cm2), vacuum dielectric constant (∼8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), and relative dielectric constant of CZTSSe (8.6), the free carrier density can be evaluated from the value of the y-axis at 0 V. The profiling position (ε0εA/C) at each bias was derived from the capacitance response of the main and back-contact junctions. With increasing Sb-incorporation content, the carrier density increased from 3.62 × 1016 cm−3 (0 mol%) to 1.98 × 1017 cm−3 (2 mol%), mainly benefitted from the crystallization enhancement. Accompanied with the improved GB potential, this magnitude of carrier density accords well with the efficient CZTSSe solar cells requirement and should be summarized as another issue responsible for the Sb-induced performance enhancement at low temperatures.
 Fig. 8  (a) C–V curves of CZTSSe solar cells with different Sb amounts selenized at 510 °C. (b) Space-charge density derived from C–V curves. These data were recorded under 0 to −1 V reverse bias at 300 K. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a significant increase in PCE for low-temperature-processed CZTSSe solar cells by direct dissolving an antimony fluxing agent into an as-prepared precursor solution. Systematic studies on the physical origins of performance enhancement were further performed by C–V and KPFM measurements. It turned out that the antimony-assisted grain growth, fine-grain layer thickness, and local defect chemistry environment improvement ultimately led to carrier density, cross-section electrical conduction, and GB potential enhancement. Finally, the 4% Sb-incorporated CZTSSe device exhibited a comparable photoelectricity conversion efficiency in comparison to those of the 550 °C-commonly-fabricated devices and directly decreased the selenization temperature down to 470 °C. This systematic study solved the difficulty in achieving device-quality CZTSSe grain structure at low temperature and represents tremendous potential in reducing production costs, constructing a beneficial composition profile gradient, and extending the substrate species upon which the CZTSSe absorber can be integrated.
