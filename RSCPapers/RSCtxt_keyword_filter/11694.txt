Here, we report efficient non-fullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (NF all-SMOSCs), using DR3TBDTT and O-IDTBR as the donor and acceptor, respectively. We obtain a high electroluminescence yield (EQEEL) value of up to ∼4 × 10−4 corresponding to a 0.21 eV non-radiative recombination loss, which is the smallest value for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs so far. As a result, a low Eloss of 0.54 eV and a considerably high Voc of 1.15 V are obtained for BHJ NF all-SMOSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as a very promising clean energy technology because of their light weight, flexibility, and the potential of roll-to-roll fabrication.1,2 After great efforts on the new materials design and synthesis3–6 and the device optimization,7–9 the current record highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction BHJ-OSCs is over 13%.10–12 However, the PCEs of BHJ-OSCs are still significantly lower than those of inorganic solar cells and perovskite solar cells (over 20%).13,14 One of the most important reasons that limits the PCEs of OSCs is the relatively large energy loss (Eloss) from the optical bandgap (Eg) of the absorber to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device, which is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc.15–18 The Eloss of inorganic crystalline and perovskite solar cells is normally between 0.30 and 0.55 eV.19,20 In contrast, the Eloss for fullerene-based OSCs with high PCEs is often observed to be between 0.6 and 1.0 eV.21–23 Such large Eloss in OSCs can be ascribed to two main reasons. One reason is the non-steep absorption onset due to the charge transfer (CT) within the band gap.20 Another is the large non-radiative recombination losses (typically, between 0.35 and 0.44 eV), identified by the very low electroluminescence yields (EQEEL), usually between 10−6 and 10−8.24,25 The non-radiative recombination losses often constitute a significant part of the total energy losses in BHJ-OSCs. Therefore, the most effective strategy to reduce the energy loss is to decrease the non-radiative recombination losses, which can improve the EQEEL of OSCs.
Very recently, a few reports have shown that the Eloss for non-fullerene (NF)-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) could be reduced to 0.4–0.6 eV with PCEs of over 10%,22,26–29 indicating that NF-solar cells can be an effective way for achieving low Eloss. Furthermore, non-fullerene acceptors present good light harvesting capability, finely tuned energy levels, and facile synthesis, which are beneficial to achieving high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc).30–32 In comparison with their polymeric counterparts, non-fullerene all-small-molecule OSCs (NF all-SMOSCs) should be more promising owing to their well-defined molecular structures, accurate molecular weights, and high purities without batch to batch variations.33–36 As we know, to date, there have been four reports which show that the PCEs of single-junction NF all-SMOSCs exceed 9%.37–40 However, all of their Voc values are less than 1.0 V, which are ascribed to the relatively large Eloss of 0.64–0.72 eV. Therefore, it is essential to develop OSCs with a low Eloss and high Voc, to further enhance the PCEs of OSCs.
In this work, we report efficient NF BHJ all-SMOSCs based on DR3TBDTT (donor) and O-IDTBR (acceptor) (Fig. 1). This device shows a high EQEEL of up to ∼4 × 10−4 corresponding to ∼0.21 eV non-radiative recombination energy loss, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest value reported for all BHJ-OSCs. Moreover, characterization of the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) spectrum clearly demonstrates that this device has a low additional radiative recombination loss. Consequently, a low Eloss of 0.54 eV and a considerably high Voc of 1.15 V are achieved for BHJ NF all-SMOSCs, which is the first report for SMOSCs. In addition, after optimizing the morphology of active layers by solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the PCE of the device is improved from 4.30% to 6.36%.

2. Experimental section
Electron donor DR3TBDTT and electron acceptor O-IDTBR were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. Organic solar cells were fabricated using indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass as the substrate with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min each. The cleaned substrates were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 12 h before use. The substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm with PVDF) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s onto the ITO surface, and the substrates were heated at 150 °C for 20 min before being moved into the glovebox. Subsequently, the photoactive layers were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of DR3TBDTT: O-IDTBR (0.8:1, weight ratio) in chloroform with a total concentration of 16 mg mL−1 in a N2-filled glovebox at 45 °C for 3 h. The thickness of the photoactive layers is around 90 nm, which is measured using a programmable surface profiler measuring system. Then, these substrates were placed in a glass Petri dish containing 1.5 mL dichloromethane for solvent vapor annealing. Afterwards, the substrates were transferred back to the high-vacuum chamber, where BCP (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation at pressures of less than 6 × 10−5 Pa with a rate of 0.20 Å s−1 and 2 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 1.5–5.0 Å s−1, respectively, resulting in final OSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/DR3TBDTT: O-IDTBR (90 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active area of organic solar cells is 9 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization was performed on a CEP-2000 integrated system manufactured by Bunkoukeiki Co. under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G light illumination. All of the measurements were carried out in ambient air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Material properties
As shown in Fig. 2a, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the DR3TBDTT film exhibits a strong and broad absorption in the region of 400–700 nm with a maximum absorption peak of 590 nm, complementary to that of the O-IDTBR film from 500 to 770 nm with a maximum absorption peak of 690 nm, which is beneficial to utilize the visible region of the sunlight. The absorption edges of DR3TBDTT and O-IDTBR at 720 and 765 nm correspond to the optical bandgap of 1.72 and 1.62 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the previous literature.41,42 Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 2b, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of O-IDTBR are obviously lower than those of DR3TBDTT (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), which can afford a sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation.44 Therefore, the combination of the two small molecular materials is very suitable for fabricating OSCs.

3.2 Photovoltaic properties
To study their photovoltaic properties, NF all-SMOSC devices are fabricated with a normal structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DR3TBDTT:O-IDTBR/BCP/Al. Chloroform is used as the solvent, and the blend films are optimized by carefully varying the weight ratio of the donor and acceptor (i.e. D/A, weight ratio), and by adjusting their thickness, their photovoltaic performances are summarized in Tables S2 and S3,† and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† The photovoltaic performances of the devices with the optimal D/A blend ratio (0.8:1) and thickness (∼90 nm) are further improved by adopting dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices with different SVA treatment times (40 s, 70 s and 100 s) are summarized in Table 1, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a. The as-cast device exhibits a PCE of 4.30%, it is obviously enhanced to 5.15% by 40 s of SVA treatment. After treatment for 70 s, the PCE was further increased to 6.36% with a Voc of 1.15 V, Jsc of 11.06 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.50, which is one of the highest values in BHJ NF all-SMOSCs. When the SVA time is further increased to 100 s, the FF value is slightly improved; however, the Voc and Jsc values are notably reduced, thereby resulting in a low PCE. Compared to the as-cast device, the distinctly enhanced PCE of the SVA treated devices is mainly attributed to their higher Jsc and FF.

J–V curves (a) and EQE curves (b) of DR3TBDTT: O-IDTBR-based NF all-SMOSCs. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are measured, and they are shown in Fig. 3b. The JEQEsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves, only with a 1–3% mismatch. The broad and efficient EQE spectra from 300 to 770 nm indicate that both the DR3TBDTT and O-IDTBR make contributions to the photo-current. Uniform increases of the whole spectral response are clearly observed for the devices with various SVA treatment times. In particular, the device with SVA treatment for 70 s, the EQE value is significantly enhanced with a maximum value of over 50%, which is rarely observed for OSCs with such low Eloss.22,45
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the DR3TBDTT: O-IDTBR blend films for various SVA treatment times are evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model.46 The hole mobility is measured by adopting a hole-only device structure of ITO/MoO3/DR3TBDTT:O-IDTBR/MoO3/Al, and the electron mobility is measured with an electron-only device structure of ITO/ZnO/DR3TBDTT:O-IDTBR/BCP/Al. The μh and μe values of blend films with various SVA treatment times are summarized in Table 2, and the corresponding dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4.† For the as-cast device, the μh is 8.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much lower than its μe (1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the unbalanced mobility can induce strong charge carrier recombination, resulting in low Jsc and FF. After SVA treatment, both the μh and μe of blend films are enhanced; for example, under the optimal condition (SVA for 70 s), the μh and μe of the blend film reach 2.21 × 10−4 and 3.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These high mobilities together with the balanced μh/μe, resulting in higher charge carrier extraction efficiency, and hence obviously improved Jsc and FF could be achieved in this device.47,48

To further understand the relationship between the evolution of the blend film morphology and the device performances, the surface morphology of the blend films with various SVA treatment times are investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4, a uniform and smooth surface morphology with a relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.16 nm is observed for the as-cast film. After SVA treatment, however, apparent aggregation features are observed with increased RMS values of 1.64, 1.89 and 3.20 nm corresponding to SVA times of 40, 70 and 100 s, respectively. These results indicate that SVA treatment induces the aggregation of DR3TBDTT and O-IDTBR in the blend films, which contributes to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, significantly enhanced Jsc and FF are achieved. Whereas upon SVA treatment for 100 s, the film possesses an excess nanoscale phase separation with the highest RMS value of 3.20 nm, which may account for the low Jsc. In addition, the rough surface could also leads to poor interfacial contact between the active layer and the hole blocking layer, resulting in low Voc.49

The following grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) measurements are performed to provide insight into the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the blend films with various SVA treatment times. The out-of-plane and in-plane cuts of GI-XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 5 and S5,† respectively. In the in-plane direction, no obvious peaks were observed. While all the blend films exhibit a similar peak at 4.50° in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to a lamellar structure (d = 19.6 Å), which comes from the pure DR3TBDTT film (Fig. S6 and S7†). These results indicate that the blend films are able to maintain a completely edge-on crystalline orientation relative to the substrates. Compared to the as-cast film, stronger diffraction intensities are present in the SVA treated films, and as the treatment times increase, the diffraction intensity improved gradually, indicating a higher degree of molecular ordering. Thus, the high crystalline characteristics of the blend films should promote intermolecular charge transport and reduce charge recombination, eventually resulting in the significantly enhanced Jsc and FF in this device.

3.3 Origins of low energy losses
The Eloss is determined by the difference between the Eg of the active layer and the Voc of the device. Most reports employ the onset position of absorption as Eg (1.62 eV in our case), thereby the Eloss is as low as 0.48 eV in this device. However, the definition from the absorption onset is not well defined, especially for the films without the linear region in the absorption edge or the films with significant light scattering in the absorption tail. In addition to obtaining the Eg from the absorption onset, the Eg can be obtained by taking the crossing point between the absorption and emission spectra of the active layer as well (1.69 eV in our case, Fig. S8†), corresponding to an Eloss of 0.55 eV.
The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit and variations thereof are helpful to gain insight into the energy losses. Based on the SQ limit model,20,50 the Eloss in solar cells can be divided into the three parts as shown in the following equations:Eloss = Eg − qVoc = (Eg − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc) = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3.where q is the elementary charge, VSQoc is the thermodynamic limit of the Voc in the SQ, and Vradoc is the radiative limit of Voc where the radiative recombination is assumed to be the sole recombination channel in the device. The details for calculating the VSQoc and Vradoc are given in ref. 50. The quantification results of our NF all-SMOSCs and some other typical solar cells are depicted in Table 3 and Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Histogram of the quantifying energy losses of several inorganic and organic solar cells. 
ΔE1 is the loss between Eg and VSQoc, which is determined by the Eg and temperature. ΔE2 is the loss between VSQoc and Vradoc, which is ascribed to non-steep absorption or the EQE curve of real-world devices. OSCs usually have relatively larger ΔE2, e.g. 0.20 eV for the PTB7: PC71BM blend film-based OSCs, which is due to the CT states within the band gap. As shown in Fig. S9 and S10,† we measured FTPS-EQE and EL spectra for blends and the pure acceptor, and found that no distinct and red-shifted absorption and emission related to CT states are visible in the spectra of blends. As a result, the ΔE2 is calculated to be as low as 0.06 eV in this device. ΔE3 is non-radiative recombination energy losses due to the non-radiative recombination under Voc conditions. The ΔE3 is determined by the EQEEL of the solar cells i.e.. For OSCs, this loss is much higher than those of crystalline silicon and perovskite solar cells due to the low EQEEL (usually 10−6 to 10−8) of CT states.24 While for P3TEA: SF-PDI2-based NF-PSCs, this loss can be reduced to 0.26 eV because the EQEEL value is improved to 5 × 10−5, thereby resulting in a relatively low Eloss of 0.61 eV. Remarkably, for the DR3TBDTT: O-IDTBR-based NF all-SMOSCs, a high EQEEL value of 4.0 × 10−4 is observed (Fig. S11†), even much higher than that of the pure film of O-IDTBR (2.4 × 10−6), which is the highest one in all BHJ-OSCs. It is indicated that this loss is as low as 0.21 eV, even lower than those of MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells (0.25 eV).20 This is, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest non-radiative recombination energy loss in OSCs so far.
4. Conclusion
In summary, NF BHJ all-SMOSCs are fabricated by using DR3TBDTT and O-IDTBR as the donor and acceptor, respectively, showing a minimal non-radiative recombination energy loss of 0.21 eV. Moreover, the steep FTPS-EQE spectrum tail demonstrates that this device has a low additional radiative recombination loss of 0.06 eV. As a result, a low Eloss of 0.54 eV with a considerably high Voc of 1.15 V is achieved for BHJ NF all-SMOSCs, which is very close to those of inorganic solar cells and perovskite solar cells. In addition, SVA plays a critical role in the photovoltaic performance of NF all-SMOSCs, which increases the crystallinity of the donor and acceptor, promotes the proper phase separation domain size, and improves charge transport. Consequently, the PCE of the device is enhanced from 4.30% to 6.36%, which is the highest one as reported in SMOSCs with such low Eloss and high Voc. This remarkable result exhibits great potential for the development of NF all-SMOSCs, and creates a path towards efficient OSCs with a low Eloss.
