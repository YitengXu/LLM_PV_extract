    , Accepted 9th June 2011First published on 21st July 2011AbstractFour organic dyes bearing the phenoxazine chromophore have been synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The effect of different dye structures on the performance of the DSCs was investigated systematically with photophysical, photovoltaic as well as photoelectrochemical methods. Due to the slow recombination process between injected electrons and electrolyte, the IB3 dye with two 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl units showed the best efficiency of 7.0% under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination in the liquid state-DSCs. Moreover, the phenoxazine dyes-based solid state-DSCs were fabricated for the first time. With the IB4 dye, a higher efficiency of 3.2% has been achieved under the same light intensity.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) provide a kind of more economical and effective method to carry out the energy conversion from solar light to electricity since O'Regan and Grätzel reported that in 1991.1 As one of the crucial components in DSCs, the photosensitizers have always attracted ever-increasing attention in the past decades. Due to the better cost-performance compared to metal-complex sensitizers,2–7 the organic dyes exhibit the more brilliant future in commercial application. The traditional design concept of the organic dyes is the donor–linker–acceptor structure, also named the D–π–A configuration. The electron can be facile to transfer from the donor to the acceptor part via the linker unit, and then finish the electron injecting process from the dye to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor. Up to now, many kinds of organic dyes based on coumarin,8–11perylene,12–15 triarylamine,16–25carbazole,26–29indoline30–32 and other chromophores33–40 as donating groups have been developed and have shown potential commercial application for DSCs. In addition, due to the strong electron donating ability and facile structure modification, tetrahydroquinoline41,42 and heteroanthracene (phenothiazine and phenoxazine)43–48 have also been successfully utilized for the application of DSCs. In order to absorb the sun light as much as possible, a broad absorption spectrum of the dye is desirable. Usually, extension of the π-conjugated system (introducing more π units) is a feasible strategy to complete the mission. However, the passive effect is that the large π-conjugated system leads to poor photovoltaic properties due to dye aggregation as well as electron recombination issues. To diminish the dye aggregation and the electron recombination, the alkyl chain was often introduced into linker or donor subunits; consequently, the efficiency can be greatly improved. In this paper, we further develop this concept to design the phenoxazine (POZ) dyes (IB1∼IB4, see Fig. 1) through simultaneously modifying both donor and linker units with the same aromatic groups and also investigate the effect of different substituents and linker positions on the photophysical, photochemical and photovoltaic properties.

Preparation of liquid-solar cells

          Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (Pilkington-TEC15) were cleaned in subsequent order of detergent solution, water and EtOH using an ultrasonic bath overnight. The conducting glass substrates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The screen-printing procedure was repeated (layer of 2 μm) with TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18 NR-T) to obtain a transparent nanocrystalline film of a thickness around 10 μm and an area of 0.25 cm2. Two scattering layers (∼4 μm, solaronix R/SP) were deposited on the top of a 10 μm transparent layer to form the 10 + 4 μm TiO2 film. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P330) in an ambient air atmosphere. The temperature gradient program used included two stationary plateaus at 325 °C (10 min), and 450 °C (30 min). After sintering the electrodes once again underwent, as described above, a post-TiCl4 treatment. A second and final sintering, at 450 °C for 30 min, was performed. When the temperature decreased to 30∼40 °C after the sintering the electrodes were immersed into 0.2 mM dye solutions with 2 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and kept for 16∼17 h in dark at room temperature. The mixture of EtOH (99.5%)/DCM (4:1; v/v) was used as solvent for all dyes. After the adsorption of the dyes, the electrode was further rinsed with the EtOH. The electrodes were assembled with a platinized counter electrode (∼8.6 μg cm−2)49 using a 25 μm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn, Solaronix). The redox electrolyte containing 0.04 M I2 (99.9%), 0.06 M LiI (99.9%), 0.4 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP, 99%), 0.6 M 3-hexyl-1,2-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMHII, 98%), in MeCN/valeronitrile (VN) (85:15; v/v) was introduced through a hole drilled in the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the hole was also sealed with the Surlyn film.
Preparation of solid state-solar cells
A compact TiO2 layer (TiO2 underlayer) was firstly deposited onto the FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis, and then TiO2 particles (Dyesol, 18 NR-T) were deposited by doctor-blading method to obtain a ∼2.2 μm thick mesoporous film including the TiO2 underlayer. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated in an oven at air atmosphere to two levels, at 250 °C (20 min) and 500 °C (30 min). After sintering, the electrodes were immersed into 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A second and final sintering, at 500 °C for 30 min, was performed. When the temperature decreased to 30∼40 °C after the sintering, the electrodes were immersed into 0.2 mM dye solutions with the addition of 2 mM co-adsorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in EtOH/DCM (4:1; v/v) and kept for 16∼17 h in dark at room temperature. After the adsorption of the dyes, the electrodes were rinsed with the same solvent. The hole transporting material (HTM) solution containing 120 mM Spiro-OMeTAD, 60 mM 4-TBP, and 15 mM LiN(CF3SO2)2 (Li-TFSI) in chlorobenzene was deposited onto the dye-coated TiO2 film and left stationary for 1 min in order to penetrate the HTM solution into TiO2 pores prior to spin coating. Then, the substrate was spun up to 1400 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 50 nm of Ag was thermally evaporated on top of the HTM as counter electrode to form our test cells.
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements
Prepared solar cells were characterized by current–voltage characteristics and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). Current–voltage characteristics were carried out with an AM 1.5G solar simulator, 300 W xenon (ozone free). The incident light intensity was 1000 W m−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. For the J–V curves of liquid DSCs, the active area is 0.25 cm2 and a black mask 0.64 cm2 (8 mm × 8 mm) was used in the subsequent photovoltaic studies. For solid state DSCs, the active area is determined to 0.16 cm2 (4 mm × 4 mm) with a back mask. IPCE measurements were carried out with a computerized set-up consisting of a xenon arc lamp (300 W Cermax, ILC Technology), followed by a 1/8 m monochromator (CVI Digikrom CM 110). The data collection was done with a Keithley 2400 source/meter, and a Newport 1830-C power meter with 818-UV detector head.
Photophysical measurements
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dye-loaded transparent film (2 μm, sensitized 30 min in dye bath) and the dye solution (0.02 mM, in EtOH/DCM (4:1, v/v) in a normal quartz sample cell (1 cm path length) were recorded on a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra of dye solution were recorded on Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using the same concentration as the UV-Vis measurement.
Adsorption amount of dyes on TiO2
The dye-loading on TiO2 film was estimated from the dye desorption in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) MeOH solution by means of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, two pieces TiO2 film with total 0.5 cm2 (0.25 cm2 per piece) were used for all dyes.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical experiments were performed with a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation (model 660A) using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. Measurements were obtained with 1 mM solution of dyes in DCM by using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte. A glass carbon disk was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire served as a counter electrode, a Ag/Ag+ electrode was utilized as a reference electrode, and the scan rate used was 50 mV s−1. All redox potentials were calibrated versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by the addition of ferrocene as an internal standard taking E(Fc/Fc+) = 630 mV vs.NHE.16

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out using an Autolab PGstat12 potentiostat with an impedance module in the frequency range 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz, using 20 mV AC amplitude, under dark conditions with an applied bias voltage −0.68 V potential.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Electron lifetimes for the solar cells were measured using a red-light-emitting diode (Luxeon, 1 W) as the light source. Voltage and current traces were recorded by a 16-bit resolution data acquisition board (DAQ National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research SR570). The relation between potential and charge was studied using a combined voltage decay/charge extraction method. Charge extraction measurements were carried out as follows: the solar cell was illuminated for 5 s under open-circuit conditions, and then the light was switched off and the voltage was let to decay to a voltage V. At a certain voltage V, the cell was short-circuited, and the current was measured under 10 s and then integrated to obtain Qoc (V). Electron lifetime was tested by monitoring transient photovoltage response after a small perturbation of light intensity.
Molecular orbital calculation
The structural and electronic properties of the dyes were calculated with the B3LYP hybrid functional at the 6-31G(d) level in gas phase using the Gaussian 03 program package.50 Long alkyl substituents, which have no significant impact on the frontier orbitals of the chromophores, were truncated to methyl groups to hasten the convergence of optimizations.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The detailed synthetic routes of IB1∼IB4dyes are depicted in Fig. 2. All of the dyes were synthesized according to the traditional methods: alkylation, bromination, Vilsmeyer–Haack formylation, Suzuki-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. The N-alkylation was performed in acetone with 1-bromooctane, NaOH as the base and palmityl trimethylammonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst. Formylation was accomplished by the Vilsmeyer–Haack reaction. Monobromination and dibromination were controlled by the amount of bromine added in the reaction. The dibromination products (compounds 5 and 11) are very easy to be purified compared with the mono-brominated product due to much lower polarity. The position of the Br atom in the dibrominated compounds was further proved by NOESY spectra. The final reaction for all dyes was the condensation of corresponding aldehyde with 2-cyanoacetic acid by the Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of piperidine. All the compounds were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The final dyes were also characterized by HR-MS.

Calculation study
In order to explain the experimental spectra and gain insights into the structural properties of the chromophores, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The optimized geometries and isodensity plots of the frontier orbitals of the chromophores are shown in Table 1. The isodensity plots were generated in Avogadro51 using an isovalue of 0.02.

A first insight gained from the calculations is that introducing a substituent on the thiophene in a position adjacent to the phenoxazine will disrupt the dihedral angle between the POZ and thiophene. As the dihedral angle between these two aromatic units in the chromophore grows from 20° in IB1 to 36–39° in IB2 and IB4, conjugation over the π-system is disrupted. This disruption of the conjugation is reflected in the experimental optical spectra of the chromophores in that IB1 has the strongest absorption.
Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of IB1∼IB4dyes in EtOH/DCM (4:1; v/v) solution and on TiO2 films are illustrated in Fig. 3. The corresponding photophysical data are collected in Table 2. IB2 and IB3dyes show slightly blue-shifted absorption peaks (λmax) and lower extinction coefficient comparing with IB1 due to the weak π-conjugated system caused by the increased twist angle between the POZ unit and the thiophene group, which has been proved with the DFT calculation. Interestingly, when the thiophene unit in IB2 was changed from right to left of the POZ unit to construct the IB4 dye, the absorption peak is red-shifted from 483 nm to 492 nm, but the absorption region was narrowed due to the change of the π-conjugated system of the structure. Compared with the absorption spectra of the dyes in solution, the absorption spectra of IB2 and IB3 on TiO2 films show almost no obvious change, probably due to the suppression of dye aggregation on TiO2 ascribed to the extra units in both the POZ and thiophene units. However, the IB1 and IB4dyes have the obvious blue-shifted absorption spectra on the TiO2 surface. The effect of different ratios of IB4/CDCA on the absorption spectra (see Fig. S1†) was performed to study if the aggregation causes the blue-shift phenomenon. However, no obvious red-shift of absorption spectrum was observed when the concentration of CDCA in the dye bath was increased. Therefore, we consider that the blue-shift of the IB4dye on TiO2 could be caused by different configurations of IB4 on the TiO2 surface from that in solution, not the aggregation. Noticeably, with the same thickness of the TiO2 film (2 μm) and the sensitized time (30 min) in the same concentration of dye-bath, the IB4 dye shows a stronger absorbance even than the IB1dyes (Fig. 3b). According to dye adsorption amount measurements (Table 3), one finds that IB4dyes show a much greater adsorption amount on TiO2 film, 2.5 ×10−8 mol cm−3 than IB1, 2.0 × 10−8 mol cm−3, although the CDCA has been added into the dye-bath to diminish the dye aggregation. Coincidentally, IB2 and IB3dyes display the same adsorption amount on TiO2, 1.8 × 10−8 mol cm−3, which is lower than that of the IB1dye on TiO2 due to the special molecular configuration. This result could imply that the IB4 dye has the fast sensitization rate as compared to other dyes.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of IB1∼IB4 are shown in Table 2. The oxidation potentials (Eox) of these dyes were measured by cyclic voltammetry. The first oxidation potential versusnormal hydrogen electrode (vs.NHE) calibrated by Fc/Fc+ (with 630 mV vs.NHE) corresponds to the HOMO level of the dye. The HOMO levels of all the dyes are more positive than the redox potential of I−/I3− (0.3∼0.4 V vs.NHE),52 which means that the oxidized dyes can be regenerated effectively. For IB2 and IB3dyes, the introduction of an extra electron donor in both POZ and thiophene makes the HOMO level more negative compared with IB1 due to the increase of electron donating ability. However, when the substituted thiophene was moved from the right side of the POZ (IB2) to the left side of the POZ (IB4), the HOMO level was significantly changed. IB4 shows more positive HOMO potential than IB2 due to the weaker π-conjugated system in molecular structure. The LUMO levels of these dyes were calculated by Eox − E0–0, where E0–0 is the zeroth–zeroth energy of the dyes estimated from the intersection between the absorption and emission spectra. As shown in Table 2, the LUMO potentials of these dyes are much more negative than the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 level (−0.5 V vs.NHE), which means that the electrons could be efficiently injected into the CB of TiO2 from the excited dyes. Furthermore, the large difference between the TiO2 CB and the LUMO levels of the dyes suggests that 4-tert-butylpyridine can be used in the electrolyte to move the CB negatively, yielding higher photovoltage (V) values.
Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSCs based on IB1∼IB4dyes performed under standard AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding photovoltaic data are collected in Table 4. The basic dye structure IB1dye gave an efficiency of 6.2% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.2 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.7 V and fill factor (ff) of 0.68. Featuring the TPA groups in the POZ and thiophene units, the IB2 dye rendered a higher Voc value, 0.76 V. However, replacing the TPA groups with 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl units to construct the IB3 dye, the Voc value was further improved to 0.8 V without decrease of photocurrent, hence yielding an ideal efficiency of 7.0% under same light illumination. The position of thiophene also significantly affects the photovoltaic properties. The IB4dye shows a lower photovoltage value, 0.74 V, and higher IPCE values, between 400 and 600 nm, than the IB2dye.

In order to gain further insight into the reasons for the increased photovoltage, the lifetime and charge extraction of these dyes based DSCs were measured. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the dyes show the same effect on charge extraction experiments, which means that the DSCs based on these dyes using the same electrolyte show the same effect on the CB of TiO2. However, the measurement of the injected electron lifetime (τe) of DSCs based on different IB dyes presents an interesting result. The τe values of DSCs based on IB dyes are in order of IB1 < IB4 < IB2 < IB3. The result implies that the introduction of 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl units can greatly suppress the electron recombination between the injected electron and the electrolyte or oxidized dye. Comparing IB2 and IB4dyes, when the TPA substituted thiophene unit is close to the anchor group, in other words, near to the TiO2 surface, the injected electron will be further protected to avoid the recombination process mentioned above, rendering the higher Voc.
 Fig. 5  The electron lifetime (a) and charge extraction (b) of DSCs based on IB dyes. 
In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also was employed to study the electron recombination and electrolyte reduction process in DSCs based on these IB1∼IB4dyes under −0.68 V bias applied voltage in the dark. The Nyquist and Bode plots are shown in Fig. 6. Some important parameters can be obtained by fitting the EIS spectra to an electrochemical model.53RS, Rrec and RCE represent the series resistances, charge-transfer resistances at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and counter electrode (CE), respectively. We can find the series resistance (RS) and electrolyte reduction resistance (RCE) corresponding to the first semicircle show almost same value in all dyes-based DSCs due to the same electrode material and same electrolyte. From the EIS measurements, the electron lifetime (τe) expressing the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2 may be extracted from the angular frequency (ωrec) at the mid frequency peak in the Bode phase plots using the relation τe = 1/ωrec. The IB1dye gives the lowest Rrec value, 60 Ω, and the shortest τe, 26 ms in TiO2, among these dyes. However, τe and Rrec of the IB3dye are 455 ms and 1560 Ω, respectively, which are much higher than that of the other dyes. The lifetime obtained by EIS is in order of IB1 < IB4 < IB2 < IB3. This trend is in accordance with the τevs. Voc results above. This result suggests that the electron recombination rate between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte is indeed suppressed by introduction of the extra electron donor groups on the POZ and thiophene units efficiently.
 Fig. 6  The Nyquist (a) and Bode plots (b) of DSCs based on IB dyes. 
We also adopted IB3 and IB4 to fabricate the solid state DSCs using the Spiro-OMeTAD54 as the hole conductor. The J–V curve and IPCE spectrum of IB4 based solid state DSCs are shown in Fig. 7. The IB4dye showed an efficiency of 3.2% with a Jsc of 6.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V and ff of 0.62 under standard light illumination. The maximum IPCE value obtained by the IB4 dye is 63% at 480 nm. However, under the same condition, the IB3dye in solid state DSCs gave an efficiency of just 1.6% with much lower Voc and ff values of 0.59 V and 0.34, respectively. According to the lifetime measurement (Fig. 8), interestingly, the IB3 dye shows a much shorter lifetime than IB4. The trend is totally different from that in liquid DSCs. The serious electron recombination between the injected electrons and oxidized dyes or Spiro-OMeTAD will result in the lower Voc value, probably as well as a low ff value, yielding a disappointing efficiency of DSCs based on the IB3dye. The potential of Spiro-OMeTAD is 0.8 V vs.NHE,55 which means that the regeneration of oxidized IB3dye could be difficult by this material. However, from experiment, the solid state DSCs based on the IB3dye also produced a high current of about 8.0 mA cm−2, which proved that the IB3dyes also can be regenerated by Spiro-OMeTAD in solid state DSCs. This result suggests that the redox potentials of IB3 and/or Spiro-OMeTAD in solid state DSCs are not exactly same as those in organic solvent.

Conclusion
Through modification of the basic dye structure (IB1) from both the linker and donor units, a series of phenoxazine dyes were designed and developed for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). An efficiency of 7.0% has been achieved under the standard light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) by the IB3 dye with 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl units. The detailed photoelectrochemical study discovers that the introduction of triphenylamine or 2,4-dibutoxyphenyl can decrease the recombination process between the injected electrons and electrolytes, yielding the high photovoltage in liquid state DSCs. Furthermore, the solid state DSCs based on phenoxazine dyes were reported for the first time. The IB4dye rendered an efficiency of 3.2% under the standard light illumination. This strategy of structural modification will pave a road to develop more efficient organic dyes in the future.
