    , Accepted 12th January 2023First published on 13th January 2023AbstractThere are much fewer n-type conjugated polymers than p-type counterparts because of the lack of strong electron-accepting building blocks. We report a novel strong electron-accepting unit based on a dicyanomethylene unit. The resulting polymers exhibit LUMO energy levels of as low as −4.04 eV and narrow optical gaps with an onset absorption wavelength of 1050 nm. Moreover, the polymers exhibit near-infrared light absorption with good photostability because of their low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels.
n-Type conjugated polymers have recently attracted great attention because they are key materials in organic opto-electronic devices, such as polymer solar cells (PSCs), organic photodetectors (OPDs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).1–10 n-Type conjugated polymers are either D–A type, consisting of alternating electron donating building blocks (D) and electron-accepting building blocks (A) or A–A type consisting of two alternating A building blocks. The development of n-type conjugated polymers lags behind that of p-type conjugated polymers in view of material diversity and device performance.11 This is due to the lack of strong A building blocks to construct n-type conjugated polymers.12–15 The general strategy to design A building blocks is to introduce electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), such as amide,16 imine,17 and cyano (CN) groups18 and boron–nitrogen coordination bonds,19–22 into the aromatic units. In the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to the molecular design and synthesis of A building blocks. A variety of A building blocks have been reported, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),23 isoindigo (IID),24 naphthalene diimide (NDI),25 benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,6-dicarbonitrile (CN-BT),6 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),26 double B ← N bridged bipyridine (BNBP),27 thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz),28 perylene diimide (PDI),29 naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz),30 benzodifurandione PPV (BDOPV),31 1,1′-biphenyl-2,2′-dicarboximide (BPI),32 bithiophene imide (BTI),19 fluorenone imide (FOI),33 dipyrromethene (BODIPY),34 dithienylbenzodiimide (TBDI),35 thiazolothiazole (TTz),36etc. However, the quantity of A building blocks is still limited. The development of a novel A building block is expected to greatly expand the scope of n-type conjugated polymers.
Near-infrared (NIR) light absorbing polymers are useful not only in solution-processed organic opto-electronic devices, such as semitransparent OPVs and NIR photodetectors, but also in biomedical applications, such as photoacoustic imaging (PA), and tissue imaging.37–41 NIR-absorbing polymers must have a small bandgap, i.e., the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Owing to the lack of strong A units to design conjugated polymers, it is difficult to develop conjugated polymers with low-lying LUMO energy levels. Therefore, to get a small bandgap, most of the NIR-absorbing polymers have high-lying HOMO energy levels.42 These conjugated polymers can be readily oxidized or p-doped by oxygen under ambient conditions, resulting in insufficient stability of NIR-absorbing conjugated polymers.43,44 n-Type conjugated polymers with low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels are potential candidates for ambient stable narrow bandgap polymers. However, n-type polymers with NIR absorption are rarely reported.
Dicyanomethylene possesses strong electron withdrawing capability and has been used to design n-type organic small molecules. For example, small molecular electron acceptors based on a dicyanomethylene moiety exhibit record-high power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells.45 However, dicyanomethylene has seldom been used to design building blocks to construct conjugated polymers. In this manuscript, we report a novel dicyanomethylene-based building block, 2-(2,5-dibromo-3,4-bis(2-butyloctyl)-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b’]dithiophen-7-ylidene)malononitrile (o-CC), which exhibits strong electron-withdrawing properties and can be used to design n-type ultra-small bandgap conjugated polymers. The chemical structure of the o-CC unit is shown in Fig. 1a. The two thiophene rings are bridged at the α-positions by a dicyanovinyl group to maximize the electron-withdrawing capability and π-conjugation extending tendency of the o-CC building block. The β-positions of the thiophene rings are functionalized with alkyl chains to ensure the solubility of the resulting conjugated polymers. As a result, the alternating copolymer of the o-CC unit with an ethylene unit exhibits an optical gap of as small as 1.18 eV with an onset absorption wavelength of >1000 nm (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the copolymer shows good photo-oxidative stability because of its low-lying LUMO energy levels (ELUMO)/HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of −5.68 eV/−4.04 eV (estimated by cyclic voltammetry). This work provides o-CC as a new building block to design n-type ultra-small bandgap conjugated polymers.

There are two methods to introduce a dicyanomethylene moiety to bithiophene for electron-accepting properties. One is to use dicyanomethylene to bridge the two thiophene rings at the α-positions, i.e., o-CC (Fig. 2a). The other one is to use dicyanomethylene to bridge the two thiophene rings at the β-positions, i.e., p-CC (Fig. 2a). To elucidate the electronic structure of the two isomers of dicyanomethylene-bridged bithiophene, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the model compounds. As shown in Fig. 2a, for both o-CC and p-CC, the molecular backbone and their calculated LUMO energy levels are similar. To study the conjugation extending tendency of the two isomers, we employed dimers of the o/p-CC unit and ethylene unit (o-CCV and p-CCV). The LUMO of the o-CCV is well delocalized on the whole molecular backbone, while there is little electron cloud distributed on the ethylene unit in p-CCV. With the ethylene unit linked on o-CC or p-CC, the calculated ELUMO of o-CCV decreased from −3.33 eV to −3.47 eV, while there is no obvious change of the ELUMO of p-CCV. This indicates that the o-CC shows stronger conjugation extending tendency with copolymerized units, which is coincident with the electron cloud distribution of the LUMO. In addition, we investigated the bond lengths of the thiophene rings and vinyl bond in the two model compounds by DFT calculations. The bond lengths are more uniform in the (o-CCV)2 than that in (p-CCV)2 (Fig. 2b), confirming the enhanced conjugation of the molecular backbone of (o-CCV)2. Therefore, compared to the p-CC unit, the o-CC unit, as an electron-accepting building block, possesses stronger electron-withdrawing ability and higher conjugation extending tendency, which is more suitable for constructing n-type narrow bandgap conjugated polymers.

The synthetic routes of the monomer and the polymers are shown in Fig. 3. The key intermediate, bis(3-bromo-4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)methanol (4) was synthesized in four steps starting from 3-bomothiophene following the literature methods.46 Then, 4 was oxidized by pyridinium chlorochromate to give the carbonyl product 5. The intramolecular Ullmann coupling of 5 afforded 6, which was then brominated with N-bromosuccinimide to give 7. The key monomer o-CC was readily synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation of 7 with malononitrile. The two polymers, P1 and P2, were prepared via Stille polymerization of o-CC with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and trans-1,2-bis (tributyltin) ethylene, respectively.

Regents and conditions: (i) R-MgBr, Ni(dppp)Cl2, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 0 °C to 60 °C; (ii) Br2, Fe, CHCl3, r.t.; (iii) n-butyl lithium, ethyl ether, −78 °C to 0 °C, then hydrochloric acid; (iv) lithium diisopropylamide, ethyl ether, −78 °C to 0 °C, then methyl formate; (v) pyridinium chlorochromate, CH2Cl2, 0 °C to r.t.; (vi) Cu, DMF, MW 300W, 145 °C; (vii) N-bromosuccinimide, CHCl3, 0 °C to r.t.; (viii) CH2(CN)2, acetic acid, pyridine, ethanol, 100 °C. 
The chemical structures of P1 and P2 are confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent at 150 °C, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity are 25 kg mol−1/2.4 for P1 and 22 kg mol−1/1.9 for P2. Both of the two polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).
DFT calculation was carried out employing the model compounds of two repeating units to study the structural geometries and molecular orbitals of the two polymers. As shown in Fig. 4a, the backbones of P1 and P2 both adopt wavy configurations. The dihedral angle between the o-CC and thienyl unit is 37° in P1 because of the steric hindrance of the methyl substituent. In comparison, the dihedral angle between the o-CC and ethylene units is 2.5° in P2. The improved planarity of P2 would facilitate effective conjugation of the polymer backbone and lead to decreased bandgap of the polymer. Fig. 4b shows the calculated Kohn–Sham LUMOs and HOMOs of the two model compounds. Both the LUMO and HOMO of the two model compounds of P2 are well delocalized on the backbone. In comparison, the HOMO of the model compound of P1 is well delocalized on the backbone, but the LUMO is disturbed in the thiophene linker. This is probably due to the twisted conformation of the linkage of the o-CC unit and thiophene unit, which decreases the effective conjugation of the polymer backbone. Fig. 4b shows the DFT calculated ELUMO and EHOMO of the model compounds. Compared to the model compound of P1, the model compound of P2 exhibits decreased ELUMO and increased EHOMO, leading to a smaller bandgap. This is consistent with the more effective conjugation with a coplanar conformation of the polymer backbone of P2.

We employed cyclic voltammetry in a thin film to estimate the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 5a. Both of the two polymers show good oxidation/reduction behaviours. According to the onset oxidation/reduction potentials, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are calculated to be −5.88 eV/−3.70 eV and −5.68 eV/−4.04 eV, respectively. The ELUMO/EHOMO of P2 is much lower than that of typical low bandgap conjugated polymers (Fig. S1, ESI†) and confirms the n-type property of the two polymers.

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in CHCl3 solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 5b. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. In thin film, P1 and P2 exhibit a long-wavelength absorption peak (λmax) at 723 nm and 935 nm, with the onset absorption wavelength of 905 nm and 1044 nm, respectively. Accordingly, the optical gaps of P1 and P2 are estimated to be 1.36 eV and 1.18 eV, respectively. The optical gap of P2 is narrower than that of P1 because of the more effective conjugation of P2. From in solution to in thin film, the absorption spectra change slightly, suggesting the weak intermolecular interaction of the polymer chains in thin film.

To study the photostability of the two polymers, we monitored the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the solutions and films of P1 and P2. Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent absorption decays of the two polymers at the corresponding maximum near-infrared absorptions during irradiation under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light. As shown in Fig. 6a, after illumination for 12 hours, the near-infrared absorbance of P1 and P2 in toluene solution remained 93.2% and 90.2% of their initial light absorption, respectively. In thin films, the absorbance of P1 almost remained unchanged and the near-infrared absorbance of P2 decreased by 5% after illumination for 12 hours (Fig. 6b). These results demonstrated the good photo-oxidative stability of the o-CC based polymers, which may benefit from the low-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels.

In conclusion, we have developed a strong electron-accepting unit o-CC based on a dicyanovinyl moiety to construct ultra-narrow bandgap conjugated polymers. The alternating copolymer of o-CC and vinyl unit, P2, exhibits a maximum absorption peak at 944 nm with a small optical gap as low as 1.18 eV together with the low-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels of −4.04 eV/−5.68 eV. Moreover, both P1 and P2 show good photo-oxidative stability probably because of the low-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels. These results suggest that o-CC is a promising building block to design ultra-narrow bandgap n-type conjugated polymers.
