    , Accepted 26th September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractBinary acceptor alloys based on two A′′–D′A′D′–A′′ small-molecule acceptors having the same core structures and side chains but different conjugation end groups, namely, BTPO-NF and BTPO-F were synthesized and blended with the polymer PM6 for forming ternary blends of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) displaying high open-circuit voltages (VOC), power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), and stability. Both BTPO-NF and BTPO-F possessed the same alkoxy chains, which increased the energies of their lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and mutual miscibility. After varying the amount of the two acceptor ratios in the ternary-blend system, we found that the optimum device performance could be achieved in the case of alloy acceptors with one major (BTPO-NF) and one minor (BTPO-F) acceptor component; the PM6:BTPO-NF:BTPO-F (1:1:0.2 wt) ternary-blend device provided the highest PCE of 18.0% with a high VOC of 0.97 V, with the PM6:BTPO-NF and PM6:BTPO-F (1:1.2 wt) devices displaying PCEs of 17.11% and 16.23, respectively. The enhancement in the PCE value of the PM6:BTPO-NF:BTPO-F (1:1:0.2 wt) ternary-blend device resulted from the increase in the photocurrent of the device with the optimized active layer morphology induced by the alloy acceptor structures as compared to that of the binary-blend devices. Thus, the strategy of molecular engineering of two acceptors with the same core and side chains for increasing their mutual miscibility but different degrees of conjugation for broadening the light absorption allowed the formation of binary acceptor alloys with disparite ratios, laying the foundation for the pursuit of OPVs with high values of VOC, high PCEs, and high stabilities.
Introduction
With the extensive exploration and great breakthroughs in the development of new materials, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs)1 have progressed toward realizing their potential as inexpensive, large-area, flexible, and lightweight solar energy conversion technologies. Since the advent of the use of conjugated polymers as electron donors2 and small molecules3 as electron acceptors, each incorporating various chemical building blocks, to form blended active layers, the OPV community has continued to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of such devices. The development of the state-of-art small-molecule acceptors began with the A–D–A concept, using 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F) as a fluorinated flanking electron-withdrawing moiety (A);4 the small molecules advanced to the A–DA′D–A series, including Y1 and Y6 derivatives, providing material scientists in the OPV community with all-sp2-hybridized planar skeletons to fine-tune or broaden the absorption spectrum.5 At the same time, it became apparent that the acceptor molecules required an appropriate packing orientation6 in the active layer to ensure good charge-transport properties.7 Since the advent of small-molecule acceptors having chemical structures that can be tuned to tailor their energy levels,8 absorption ranges,9 solubilities, and packing orientations for greater compatibility with the overall system, the highest PCEs of OPVs have reached 19%.10
Several molecular engineering methods have been developed as design strategies toward preparing suitable core units, side chains, and end groups. These methods involve: (i) fine-tuning suitable energy levels through the insertion of heteroatoms or the attachment of functional groups,11 (ii) extending the core conjugated structure through backbone modification,12 and (iii) side-chain engineering to provide moderate solubility and thereby suitable aggregation properties13 and preferred aggregated orientations.14 These structural variations can affect the photoelectronic properties of the materials as well as their aggregation in blends and thus, the morphologies of their active layers.15 At present, the PCEs, stabilities,16 and open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses17 of OPVs remain as critical issues that remain to be optimized.
Improving the open-circuit voltages of devices has drawn much attention because of their extended practical applications; for example, high-VOC devices could be applied in indoor devices for the internet-of-things (IoT)18 and as the front cells of tandem OPVs.19 One way to enhance the VOC values of devices is the use of side-chain engineering.20 For example, attaching a branched alkyl chain taking up more steric space,21 or a terminal alkoxyl chain, has an electron-withdrawing inductive effect of reducing the electron density of the molecular skeleton and thus raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), as shown in the DFT calculations, of a small-molecule acceptor;22 this in turn increases the VOC value of a device incorporating such molecules blended with a donor polymer.
Moreover, fabricating devices featuring a ternary-blend active layer23 comprising a donor and two acceptors, and processing them with additives, can also result in enhanced short-circuit current densities (JSC) and VOC values and regulated fill factors (FFs). In identifying a suitable second acceptor, it is necessary to simultaneously consider the energy level alignment, the surface energy of each material24 and its packing orientation.25 In particular, incorporating two similar acceptors26 with the same core units and side chains but different end groups in proper ratios to form well-mixed alloy structures and complementary properties seems to be an effective acceptors design strategy for achieving a high PCE and stability. Recently, a few studies have adopted binary acceptors that involve using the same core chemical structure but have substituted halogen atoms on the end-group unit to form two acceptors that have good miscibility.27 Additionally, a few other studies have indicated that the extended conjugation of the end-group unit can result in better absorption and stronger intermolecular interactions for enhancing the PCEs of the end devices that incorporate them.28 The design strategy utilizing the alloy-like two acceptors still remains an important research field for the OPV community to realize a high PCE, open-circuit voltage, and stable devices.
Here, we intended to simultaneously design a new binary alloy of two small-molecule acceptors possessing similar core structures and side chains but different conjugated end groups for forming a ternary-blend active layer with one polymer donor. We used two sequential approaches to produce binary alloy acceptors for enhancing the PCEs of the resulting ternary-blend OPVs. First, we synthesized BTPO-F, a small-molecule acceptor having a D′A′D′ core unit similar to that in Y6, but with different end-group moieties and also branched alkoxy chains at the β-positions of the outer thiophene units, thereby increasing the LUMO energy level and resulting in a higher open-circuit voltage, relative to that when using Y6, when blended with the polymer PM6.29 Second, we incorporated a benzene unit into BTPO-F to form BTPO-NF, which has a relatively lower band gap energy and, therefore, allows the absorption of a broader range of light. These two small molecules can experience substantial π-stacking with enhanced intermolecular interactions such that they can form alloy systems at proper weight ratios, and thus their ternary blend with PM6 resulted in devices displaying high VOC, JSC, and FF values. We measured their packing orientations to examine the characteristics responsible for the improved FFs and greater charge mobility.30 We also used dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene as a solid additive to fine-tune the aggregation domain more precisely.31
Because even slight composition variations might have disturbed the optimized active layer morphology, we used the same D/A weight ratio of the polymer PM6 and the as-synthesized small-molecule acceptors when fabricating our ternary-blend inverted devices. We developed the alloy model of the two acceptors at disparate weight ratios in the ternary-blend active layer based on the fact that the devices' open-circuit voltage values varied linearly with the binary alloy compositions and the merged melting point for the alloy, with the latter being lower than both the individual melting points of the two acceptors. This alloy structure in the active layer, therefore, could serve as an effective means to transport the carriers more efficiently to increase the VOC and FF values for the devices. After blending with the state-of-art polymer PM6, the device incorporating PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF delivered the highest PCE (18.0%) along with a high VOC value (0.97 V). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only device realizing a PCE over 18% with a high VOC of over 0.95 V. Thus, the synergistic effects of conjugation-extended end groups and branched alkoxy chains could be used to fine-tune the aggregation domain and to form a binary alloy acceptor structure, paving the way for the design and modification of A–D′A′D′–A alloy acceptors in pursuit of OPVs displaying high VOC and FF values, and high stability.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the chemical structures of the small-molecule Y6, the polymer PM6, and our newly synthesized A–D′A′D′–A small-molecule acceptors BTPO-F and BTPO-NF; while the ESI† provides our synthetic procedures for preparing BTPO-F and BTPO-NF [BT: benzothiadiazole; PO: alkoxy-dithieno pyrrole; F: IC2F; NF: naphthalene-ylidene malononitrile (IN2F)].

Fig. S2† reveals the thermal properties of the two small molecules; the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF were both over 300 °C, indicating their good thermal stability. Fig. 1b presents the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the acceptor materials, as obtained using cyclic voltammetry (CV; Fig. S3†); for BTPO-F, they were −3.76 and −5.71 eV, respectively, and for BTPO-NF they were −3.80 and −5.58 eV, respectively. The extended conjugation of the IN2F end group, relative to that of the IC2F group, decreased the LUMO energy slightly and increased the HOMO energy; the trend was similar in the case of the linear alkyl chain. On the other hand, the alkoxy side chains on both small molecules were designed to enhance their mixing while also increasing their LUMO energy levels, relative to the effects of the alkyl side chains in Y6.
Fig. S4† presents the energy levels of the frontier orbitals of the HOMO and LUMO distributions with the minimum-energy conformations of Y6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF, as calculated using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The methyl groups of the alkyl chains at the pyrrole were omitted, and the ethyl and methoxy group of the outer branched alkoxy chains at the β-positions of the outer thiophene units were omitted for Y6 and the synthesized BTPO-F and BTPO-NF molecules, respectively.
To verify whether BTPO-F and BTPO-NF could form an alloy-like structure, we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the changes in the melting behaviors. Fig. 1c presents the DSC curves of the three samples. The melting points of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF appeared at 195 °C and 211 °C, respectively, in the heating process. After mixing BTPO-NF with BTPO-F in the weight ratio of 5:1, a single melting point was noted, located at 185 °C, and this single melting point implied the two acceptors were not phase separated; therefore pointing to the high possibility of an alloy structure.
Fig. S5a† and 2b present the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the individual materials as solid films and as binary-blend solid films, respectively. The BTPO-F and BTPO-NF films absorbed broadly in the range from 550 to 850 nm; compared with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF in solution, with absorption maxima at 700 and 728 nm, respectively, whereby the spectra of the films featured their maximum peaks red-shifted to 760 nm [absorption coefficient (ε) = 7.31 × 104 cm−1] for BTPO-F and to 790 nm (7.56 × 104 cm−1) for BTPO-NF.

With the extended conjugation of the end group, owing to incorporation of a benzene ring, the absorption of the BTPO-NF film was slightly larger in the ranges of 300–650 nm and 780–860 nm relative to that of the BTPO-F film. In addition, the onset wavelength for the absorption of BTPO-NF (853 nm) was 25 nm longer than that of BTPO-F (828 nm). The optical band gaps of PM6, BTPO-NF, and BTPO-F, determined from the onsets of their absorption curves, were 1.88, 1.45, and 1.50 eV, respectively.
To elucidate the photovoltaic performances of the active layers incorporating blends of the two small-molecule acceptors (with modified side chains and conjugated end groups) and the polymer PM6, we fabricated OPV devices having the inverted device configuration of the ITO/ZnO/active layer [polymer donor:small-molecule acceptor(s)]/MoO3/Ag, where PM6 was the donor in the active layer. Details of the optimization parameters and fabrication conditions are provided in the ESI.†Fig. 3a and 3b display the J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, respectively, of the devices incorporating binary and ternary blends of PM6 with the two synthesized small molecules BTPO-F and BTPO-NF.

Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performances and parameters of OPVs prepared with various component weight ratios in their ternary-blend active layers. Notably, the PM6:BTPO-F and PM6:BTPO-NF (1:1.2 wt) devices with the optimized compositions provided averaged PCEs of 16.12% and 16.90%, respectively, with the latter greater because the short-current density (JSC) and FF were higher in the case of BTPO-NF than for BTPO-F, despite the former device having a higher VOC value. Moreover, the PM6:BTPO-F and PM6:BTPO-NF devices displayed best PCEs of 16.23% and 17.11%, respectively, with high open-circuit voltages of 0.96 and 0.99 V, respectively—a result of the higher LUMO energy levels of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF, compared to that of Y6, because the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptors and the HOMO energy level of PM6 determined the value of VOC.

The value of JSC and the FF of the PM6:BTPO-NF devices were slightly higher (by 4.8% and 2.9%, respectively) than those of the PM6:BTPO-F devices, indicating that the extended conjugation after incorporation of a benzene ring in the end group was effective at increasing the JSC value. Next, we formed ternary-blend devices by gradually replacing the BTPO-NF with BTPO-F in the PM6:BTPO-NF-based devices while keeping the total weight ratio constant, such that the thickness of the active layer was maintained in each case. The values of VOC and JSC and the FF increased upon increasing the weight percentage of BTPO-F in the ternary-blend system up to 20%; here, the optimized ternary-blend device incorporating PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF at a 1:0.2:1 weight ratio provided an averaged PCE of 17.80% and a best PCE of 18.0% (the FF reached almost 80% and the value of JSC increased to 23.3 mA cm−2). Moreover, the VOC values of the PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF devices having ternary-blend active layer ratios of 1:0:1.2, 1:0.1:1.1, 1:0.2:1, 1:0.3:0.9, 1:0.6:0.6, 1:0.9:0.3, and 1:1.2:0 were increased accordingly to 0.959, 0.962, 0.969, 0.973, 0.979, 0.982, and 0.986 V, respectively, with the total weight ratio (2.2) and active layer thickness remaining constant. This trend was consistent with the LUMO energy level of BTPO-F being higher than that of BTPO-NF, and with the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptors and the HOMO energy level of the donor PM6 giving the theoretical values of VOC for their binary-blend devices.

Fig. 3c displays the dependence of the value of VOC on the BTPO-F weight ratio in the ternary-blend active layer of the various devices; the deviations in the measured and calculated values of VOC, based on the linear relationship between VOC,BTPO-F and VOC,BTPO-NF, were less than 1%, suggesting a typical alloy acceptors model originating from the similar core structures in the BTPO-F and BTPO-NF acceptors, along with their identical alkoxy side chains. The short-circuit current density is another important parameter when evaluating the performance of devices containing active layers of different blends. For the PM6:BTPO-F and PM6:BTPO-NF devices, the value of JSC increased slightly from 21.26 to 23.29 mA cm−2. The measured JSC values of the devices and those calculated from the integrated EQE curves were quite consistent, showing deviations of less than 5%.
To understand the differences in the values of JSC for the devices incorporating the active layers of various compositions, we plotted the differences between the measured EQE curves for the devices and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of their films (Fig. 3d–f). Fig. 3d presents the differences in the EQE curves for all the PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF ternary-blend devices with respect to that of the control binary-blend PM6:BTPO-F (1:1.2) device. The largest differences in these EQE curves occurred in the ranges of 350–450 and 750–850 nm; larger differences in the EQE curves of the BTPO-NF cases, relative to the BTPO-F cases, occurred between 350 and 450 nm, owing to the higher absorption coefficient and superior aggregation properties of BTPO-NF. The higher absorption coefficient was also responsible for the higher EQEs in the curves from 750 to 850 nm. Fig. 3e reveals that the polymer PM6 exhibited PL peaks in the range from 700 to 850 nm when excited at the corresponding highest absorption peak wavelength. The PL emission peaks of PM6:BTPO-F at 760 nm and PM6:BTPO-NF at 820 nm displayed strong PL quenching (72.6% and 93.8%, respectively). Here, BTPO-NF, with its higher absorption coefficient and narrower band gap, could quench the PL signal more efficiently. In addition, the incorporation of BTPO-F resulted in a ternary blend that provided a slight increase in PL quenching, from 93.8% to 95.8%. To understand the optical property of these ternary blends, we measured the PL spectra of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF neat films and BTPO-F:BTPO-NF blend films at various weight ratios, and found an approximately linear relationship between the maximum PL intensity and the BTPO-NF content, indicating that no energy transfer or charge transfer occurred between BTPO-F and BTPO-NF.
We used the Mott–Gurney equation to model the measured hole and electron mobilities of the devices. Table 1 summarizes the hole and electron mobilities in the devices incorporating PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF. The ratio of the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF (1:1.0:0.2) was the best balanced, with a value of 1.15, resulting in a higher degree of charge transport. To distinguish the causes of these differences in VOC values, we estimated the energy losses as defined by Egedge/q − VOC, where Egedge = 1240/λedge, with the edge wavelength (λedge) determined by the value of the wavelength at the intersection point between the tangent line on the largest slope drop of the EQE onset curve at long wavelength and the horizontal tangent line at the point of the maximum EQE, as displayed in Fig. S8.† Based on calculations of the value of Egedge/q − VOC, we obtained energy losses for the devices containing the PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF (1:0:1.2, 1:0.1:1.1, 1:0.2:1, 1:0.3:0.9, 1:0.6:0.6, 1:0.9:0.3, and 1:1.2:0) of 0.622, 0.611, 0.606, 0.608, 0.616, 0.618, and 0.639 eV, respectively, as demonstrated in Fig. S8.† The relatively smaller energy losses of the optimized composition PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF (1:0.2:1) resulted from their higher maximum EQEs in the curves. A smaller energy loss indicates a higher driving force for charge separation in the active layer.
We carried out TGA and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for providing evidence that DTT is removed from the active layer after the thermal annealing. Fig. S9† shows the TGA analysis of the sample with the same composition as that of the optimized ternary-blend layer of PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF:DTT = 1:0.2:1:0.3 by weight, and found that the weight loss at 90 °C was 12% (100–88%). Since the active layer composition was PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF:DTT = 1:0.2:1:0.3 by weight, the total weight loss% for the sample should be 0.3/2.5 × 100% = 12% if the DTT is completely removed at 90 °C. Thus, the TGA result corresponded to a complete removal of DTT in the active layer under the annealing temperature of 90 °C for 1 h. Additionally, Fig. S10† displays the C 1s and S 2p XPS spectra of the pristine DTT; where we the peak of the S 2p XPS spectra is higher and more straightforward to trace than the C 1s peak. The S 2p signal region in the optimized ternary-blend layer showed a lower intensity after thermal annealing, indicating that the DTT was completely vaporized under the annealing temperature.
We used synchrotron two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to analyze the structures and orientations of our pristine and binary- and ternary-blend films.

Fig. 4 presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of PM6, BTPO-F, BTPO-NF, and their binary-blend films. Fig. 6a displays the corresponding one-dimensional (1D) in-plane and out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles of the PM6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF films and their binary-blend films that had been reduced along the qz and qxy directions from their respective 2D patterns. Fig. 4a reveals that PM6 featured mainly an edge-on packing orientation in its pristine state, as indicated by the apparent lamellar (100) peaks in the out-of-plane direction. Fig. 4b reveals that the pristine BTPO-F films possessed slightly random molecular orientations in their lamellar (100) planes, with the signal being slightly stronger in the qxy direction. Moreover, weak signals for the BTPO-F π–π (010) stacking appeared in the qz direction, suggesting the possibility of improved carrier transport. For the pristine BTPO-NF film, with its extended end groups, the sharp arc shape of the π–π (010) signal in the qz direction was further increased and the random lamellar (100) signal was slightly decreased, indicating that adding a benzene ring not only provided a higher absorption coefficient but also led to a more preferred and stronger π-stacking. For the pristine films, the spacings between the (100) planes of PM6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF were 19.0, 21.7, and 13.7 Å, respectively. We calculated the crystal coherence length (CCL) based on the Scherrer equation:CCL = 2πk/Δq

where k is the Scherrer constant (ca. 0.9) and Δq is the full-width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak pattern. The CCLs of PM6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF were 58.2, 102.0, and 79.3 Å, respectively. The larger (100) d-spacing and larger CCL of BTPO-F revealed that it could form larger domains. On the other hand, the smaller (100) d-spacing and larger CCL of BTPO-NF suggested that BTPO-NF could form a smaller, yet compact, domain that was governed by its side chains and orderly head-to-head (tail-to-tail) stacking.

Fig. 4d indicates that, although the packing orientation of pristine BTPO-F was random, in its blend with PM6 the BTPO-F phase featured a strong inner arc-shaped lamellar (100) peak in the out-of-plane direction with a packing spacing of 20.3 Å between the (100) planes and a CCL of 100.3 Å. In the binary-blend films, the intensities of the lamellar (100) peaks of the BTPO-F phase in the out-of-plane direction were not only enhanced but also revealed a more preferred orientation. For PM6, the crystallinity changed slightly after blending with the small molecules. The PM6 phase featured an arc-shaped lamellar (100) peak in the out-of-plane direction with a packing spacing of 16.1 Å between the (100) planes and a CCL of 106.8 Å. These results revealed that BTPO-F could form large aggregates that were not highly miscible with PM6. These peaks did not, however, appear in the patterns of the PM6:BTPO-NF blend films, indicating that the stronger aggregation of PM6 hindered the smaller, yet compact, BTPO-NF domains, possibly resulting from the better miscibility of PM6 and BTPO-NF.
To elucidate the packing differences in the films, we summarize the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the ternary-blend films in Fig. 5 and the corresponding 1D in-plane and out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles in Fig. 6b. In Fig. 5a–e, with the decreasing amount of BTPO-F in the ternary blend, the intensity of the arc peak of BTPO-F decreased gradually. In contrast, in the ternary blend in which BTPO-NF had been slightly replaced with BTPO-F, the PM6 signal was similar to that of the PM6:BTPO-NF film, indicating that a small amount of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF could form a miscible alloy acceptor in the ternary-blend films to optimize the PCE.

To elucidate the wider bandgaps of BTPO-NF and BTPO-F compared to Y6 caused by electronic effects of the alkoxy group in a single molecule or by planarity/stacking in the solid state, we compared the energy levels and bandgaps collected from different methods. From the DFT-calculated energy levels, we found that substituting the alkyl chain with the alkoxy chain raised BTPO-F and BTPO-NF's LUMOs and thus increased their bandgaps. To decipher whether the bandgaps were affected by a single molecule's electronic structure or the stacking of molecules in the solid state, we compared the solutions' and films' maximum absorption wavelength (λmax abs) in their UV-Vis spectra and the optical bandgaps in Table S3.† We found that the wavelength differences between the maximum absorption peaks for the solution and for the film state for Y6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF were at 100, 57, and 61 nm, respectively. The larger difference in the shifted wavelength of λmax abs from the solution to the solid state implied a stronger aggregation of molecules; thus, the aggregation of Y6 molecules was higher than that of BTPO-F and BTPO-NF in the solid state, and this could be explained by the fact that the linear alkyl side chains in Y6 exerted a lower steric effect, providing for more orderly head-to-head stacking of the molecules than for the alkoxy side chains in BTPO-F and BTPO-NF. Moreover, from the 2D GIWAXS out-of-plane pi–pi stacking comparisons, the Y6 film showed a much stronger packing than that for the cases of the BTPO-F and BTPO-NF films, as indicated in Fig. S11.†
The DFT-calculated bandgap differences between Y6 and the synthesized BTPO-F and BTPO-NF molecules were 0.19 (2.17–1.98) and 0.17 (2.15–1.98) eV, respectively, owing to the electronic effect of the different side chains. Whereas in the solid state, the optical bandgap differences between Y6 and the synthesized BTPO-F and BTPO-NF molecules were 0.17 and 0.12 eV, respectively, and in the CV, the bandgap differences between Y6 and the synthesized BTPO-F and BTPO-NF molecules were 0.40 and 0.30 eV, respectively, and were mostly dominated by the aggregated molecules.
Therefore, the comparison of the bandgap differences from a single molecule with the electronic effects from DFT with the optical bandgap and 2D GIWAXS results indicated BTPO-NF and BTPO-F had wider bandgaps compared to that of Y6 and were caused more by the electronic effects of the alkoxy side chains in a single molecule than by the molecule stacking effect.

Fig. 7 displays the transmission electron microscopy images of our seven blend films with different compositions. The morphologies of the PM6:BTPO-F (1:1.2) binary film in Fig. 7a (device PCE: 16.23%) and PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF (1:0.9:0.3) ternary-blend film (device PCE: 16.49%) in Fig. 7g showed small spot-like aggregates in the film, indicating the strong aggregation of BTPO-F. On the other hand, the PM6:BTPO-NF (1:1.2) binary-blend film in Fig. 7b (device PCE: 17.11%) appeared to have some kind of network structure, while the PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF ternary-blend films had more homogeneous network structures upon incorporating a small amount of BTPO-F up to the composition of 1:0.2:1, implying that miscible alloy acceptors allow tuning the morphology in the ternary-blend films. For example, in Fig. 7c–e, the cases of PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF at 1:0.1:1.1 (device PCE: 17.37%), at 1:0.2:1.0 (device PCE: 18.00%), and at 1:0.3:0.9 (device PCE: 17.26%) involved a network type of structure in the active layers and appeared to have more balanced device μh/μe ratios, as compared to other cases, as shown in Table 1, indicating the effectiveness of the alloy acceptors in the tuning of the morphology of the films. We also performed tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the surface morphologies of our seven blend films (Fig. S12†). The PM6:BTPO-NF film showed a smoother surface than that of PM6:BTPO-F.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of the blend films. 
To better understand the miscibility between PM6 and the two small-molecule acceptors, we measured the surface energies of the individual small molecules (Fig. S13†). The surface energies of PM6, BTPO-F, and BTPO-NF were 26.81, 33.24, and 31.31 mN m−1, respectively. Of the two small molecules, the surface energy of BTPO-NF was closer to that of BTPO-F; thereby resulting in BTPO-NF being more miscible with BTPO-F than with PM6, indicating the possibility for BTPO-NF and BTPO-F to form a binary alloy. Accordingly, modulating the miscibility of the two acceptor components in the active layer allowed us to form a more suitable BHJ morphology.

Fig. 8a shows that the normalized PCE values of the devices incorporating the PM6:BTPO-F:BTPO-NF blends at weight ratios of 1:1.2:0, 1:0.2:1, and 1:0:1.2 retained 86.8%, 92.4%, and 90.2% of their as-prepared devices' PCE values, respectively, after 720 h of storage; indicating that devices incorporating the alloy acceptors—BTPO-F and BTPO-NF—with PM6 in the active layer showed better photostability than the devices incorporating binary blends of either BTPO-NF or the BTPO-F acceptor with PM6. Fig. 8b–d show that after 360 h annealing at 65 °C without encapsulation, the devices incorporating the binary alloy acceptors—BTPO-F and BTPO-NF—and PM6 at weight ratios of 0.2:1:1 displayed a normalized PCE of 80.3%, as compared to 70.7% and 58.5% for BTPO-NF/PM6 and BTPO-F/PM6, respectively; indicating again that the device incorporating the alloy acceptors—BTPO-F and BTPO-NF—and PM6 had higher thermal stability than the devices incorporating either BTPO-NF or BTPO-F alone with PM6. We also found that the VOC and JSC values of the devices incorporating the alloy acceptors—BTPO-F and BTPO-NF—and PM6 showed only slight decreases when treating the devices at 65 °C in a N2-filled glove box without encapsulation after 360 h. In contrast, the JSC and FF of the devices incorporating BTPO-F was apparently more degraded. This result indicated that the BTPO-NF/BTPO-F alloy acceptors could improve the thermal stability of the ternary-blend devices. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, the stored and thermal stability results of our ternary-blend devices are among the best results among OPVs with a high PCE and high VOC values, which could further facilitate the practical applications of our ternary-blend devices.

Conclusions
We synthesized two similar A–D′A′D′–A small-molecule acceptors—BTPO-NF and BTPO-F—to form a binary alloy structure. These two BTPO-NF and BTPO-F small-molecule acceptors had the same core units and the same alkoxy side chains, which enhanced their mutual miscibility and allowed them to form alloy blends at proper weight ratios, but they possessed slightly different conjugations of their end groups, leading to slightly different bandgaps and degrees of light absorption. When we blended the BTPO-NF and BTPO-F alloy acceptors with the polymer PM6 to form ternary blends with a cascade in bandgap energies, we obtained OPVs that could provide high open-circuit voltages and high PCEs. The PM6:BTPO-NF:BTPO-F (1:1:0.2 wt) ternary-blend device displayed the best PCE of 18.0% with a high VOC of 0.97 V, while the PM6:BTPO-NF and PM6:BTPO-F (1:1.2 wt) devices provided PCEs of 17.11% (VOC = 0.96 V) and 16.23% (VOC = 0.99 V), respectively [cf. 15.7% (VOC = 0.83 V) for the PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 wt) device]. This enhancement in the PCE values allowed tuning of the aggregation of the acceptors, such that the short-circuit current density increased upon incorporation of the third component (BTPO-F) to the blend of PM6 and BTPO-NF. The ternary-blend devices incorporating binary acceptors alloys also displayed higher photo- and thermal stability than those of the binary-blend devices. This study indicates that the molecular engineering of two similar A–D′A′D′–A acceptors—having different end groups but the same side chains—allows the formation of binary acceptor alloys at disparate weigh ratios for OPVs and, therefore, lays a foundation for the design and modification of A–DA′D–A alloy acceptors in pursuit of OPVs that can provide high VOC values, high PCEs, and high stabilities.
