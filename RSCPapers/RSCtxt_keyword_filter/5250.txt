So far, the most commonly used redox mediator is iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), which has shown advantages such as desirable kinetic properties and high carrier collection efficiencies. However, it has several disadvantages including a low redox potential, corrosion toward metal materials and competitive blue light absorption. In this respect, the transition metal complex electrolytes represent valuable alternatives to replace traditional I−/I3− couples, and can overcome the drawbacks of the I−/I3− electrolyte. In recent years, the best efficiency of a DSSC was achieved with a porphyrin-sensitized solar cell with a transition metal complex-based redox electrolyte. In particular, in 2014, the Gratzel group published a record DSSC efficiency of 13% using a new porphyrin sensitizer with a Co-polypyridyl-based electrolyte. Here, we describe the engineering of the structure of a new transition metal complex electrolyte and the design of the molecular structure of a sensitizer at the same time. The main focus will be on the correlation between photophysical and electrochemical properties of the metal complex mediators and their DSSC performances. This review provides an in-depth investigation into exciting alternative electrolyte shuttles in DSSCs and the various advantages that they provide, including high conversion efficiency and non-corrosive properties.Babak Pashaei, Hahsem Shahroosvand and Parisa AbbasiBabak Pashaei (right) is a PhD. student (2014–present) in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Zanjan as a member of the Prof. Shahroosvand group.

1. Introduction
As a promising technology for the generation of new photovoltaic systems, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their low manufacturing costs, environmentally acceptable energy levels, high power conversion efficiency and the fact that they are renewable.1 The main components of a DSSC are a cathode, a sensitizer dye, a photoanode and an electrolyte solution containing a redox couple. The photoanode is a porous nanocrystalline semiconductor metal oxide such as TiO2 or ZnO layer coated with a monolayer of chemisorbed sensitizers, supported on a conductive glass substrate (SnO2:F). The ideal sensitizer has to meet several requirements that guide effective molecular engineering: (i) broad and strong absorption to absorb all incident lights below the near-IR wavelength; (ii) the presence of anchoring groups such as carboxylates or phosphonates to anchor onto the surface of the semiconductor; (iii) a sufficiently higher reduction potential for the sensitizer LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) than the semiconductor conduction band edge. This property minimizes the energetic potential losses during the electron transfer reaction; (vi) a sufficiently lower oxidation potential of the sensitizer HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) than the redox potential of the electron mediator species, in order to accept electron donation from an electrolyte or a hole conductive material; (v) 108 turnovers corresponding to 20 years exposure to sunlight without apparent degradation.2 The cathode, which usually consists of Pt-coated SnO2:F, is separated from the photoanode by a ∼20 μm thick gasket made of a polymer. The redox electrolyte solution is injected between the electrodes and penetrates the semiconductor layer pores, intimately contacting the dye monolayer.
In operation, the dye catches the photons from incoming light and uses their energy to excite the electrons, the same as chlorophyll in photosynthesis. The dye injects these excited electrons into the TiO2 and the electrons are conducted away by the nanocrystalline semiconductor. The electrons can be transported into the semiconductor film as conducting electrons. In addition, the counter electrode (CE) collects the electrons from the external circuit, and catalyzes the reduction of tri-iodide electrolyte ions (Fig. 1).3–5

Schematic illustration of the electron-transfer processes occurring at the dye-sensitized heterojunction: process 1, photoexcitation of the sensitizing dye; process 1, decay of excited sensitizer; process 2, electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor; process 3, dye regeneration by accepting electrons from the reduced state of the redox couple and producing the oxidized state of the redox couple in the electrolyte; process 4, dye regeneration via the hole transporting medium; process 5, back electron transfer to the oxidized dye; process 6, the recombination process between the injected electron and the oxidized species in the hole transporting medium. The indirect path of the oxidized redox shuttle is depicted, however, the actual path is more complicated and much longer. The green arrows indicate the positive processes and the red arrows indicate the deleterious processes. Right: comparison of I–V curves for the Y123 dye with [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+/3+ (Table 3) (red lines) and I−/I3− (black lines) electrolytes.24 
As one of the most critical functional components in DSSCs, the redox electrolyte has been demonstrated to be crucial in determining the photoelectric conversion efficiency and device stability of DSSCs.6,7 So far, the most commonly used redox mediator is the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) couple, which has been shown to be the best performing and most efficient electrolyte in DSSCs owing to its high carrier collection efficiency and desirable kinetic properties.1
However, the I−/I3− redox couple suffers from these intrinsic disadvantages: (a) it is very corrosive towards metals such as Ag, Au and Cu. So, the use of such materials as current collectors in DSSC modules that require long-term stability is excluded; (b) it absorbs visible light, reducing the photocurrent and competitive light absorption and consequently the power efficiency; and (c) the formation of the intermediate radical species I in the dye regeneration process, which exhibits a more negative redox potential than the corresponding standard redox potential of I−/I3−. This represents an additional energy activation barrier for dye regeneration. For example, for DSSCs based on the benchmark sensitizers, such as N719 (di-tetrabutylammonium-cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)), the difference between the redox potential of the dye, E(D/D+) (1.0–1.1 V), and the I−/I3− redox couple, E(I−/I3−) (E0 ranges from 0.35 V in acetonitrile to typically 0.4 V for electrolytes optimized for ruthenium sensitizer-based DSSCs), is in excess of 600 mV. For photons with an energy of 2 eV, this equates to more than 30% of the original photon, which limits the open circuit voltage (Voc) to 0.7–0.8 V. A 200 mV driving force is enough for efficient dye regeneration, which implies a loss of 0.5 V open circuit voltage.8,9
In the area of iodine-free redox couples for DSSCs, attempts to find alternatives to the I−/I3− redox shuttle have been limited to three series of redox couples, which include transition metal complexes, organic redox shuttles10–16 and hole transporting materials.17–23 However, one-electron outer sphere redox shuttles based on transition metal complexes have received the most attention.
Therefore, there is a requirement to optimize the cells and develop alternative electrolyte shuttles, to replace iodide with a material with lower mismatch between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox couple. In addition, these alternative redox couples should exhibit improved physical and chemical properties such as good solubility, high thermal stability, substantially optically clear at concentrations permitting good conductivity and finally be noncorrosive toward the components of the solar cell. For this reason, the development of alternative redox mediators should further improve the technology of DSSCs.
In 2010, a breakthrough paper by Feldt et al. reported that a DSSC employing a transition metal complex, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), as a redox shuttle could achieve an efficiency of 6.7% when combined with an organic dye.25 However, a large amount of the recent work on DSSCs is devoted to the substitution of the I−/I3− redox couple with alternative materials. Meanwhile, a great number of transition metal complexes, especially Co, Cu and Ni polypyridyl complexes, have been reported to overcome the disadvantages of traditional I−/I3−.26 One of the advantages of metal polypyridyl-based redox electrolytes is the lower absorption in the visible range compared to the triiodide species24,27 and that they show no corrosive behavior towards metal contacts. This characteristic is important for the durability of DSSC devices for commercial applications. Another attractive feature of metal complex electrolytes such as cobalt polypyridyl complexes is the facile tuning of their redox potential by varying the ligands with different electron withdrawing or donating groups. Depending on the HOMO level of the dye, the redox potential of the metal complex electrolyte can be tuned to the required range in order to generate a sufficient driving force for the dye regeneration to enable maximum open circuit voltages.9
Furthermore, the ligand properties can be tuned to modulate the relative activation energies for electron-transfer processes in metal complexes.28,29 Besides the Co(II/III) complexes as efficient redox mediators, several transition metal compounds have also been proposed. [VO(salen)]0/+ (salen = N,N′-ethylenebis(salicylideneiminate)(2−)),30 [Ni(dicarbollide)2]0/1−31 and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+)32 are some of these complexes.
As seen in Fig. 2, this field is growing fast and there is an exponential growth in both publications and citations dealing with the role of complex electrolytes in DSSCs.

This review concentrates on the employment of different metal complexes for the engineering of new electrolytes in DSSCs. It also systematically introduces several approaches to design transition metal complex electrolytes based on different chelated ligands. It covers not only the most frequently reported complexes, but also describes some conventional organic dyes that have led to promising results so far. Moreover, the review will survey an introduction to the exclusive position of organic and porphyrin dyes as optimized sensitizers, for the interest of readers in this field. The main idea is to inspire readers to explore new avenues in the design of novel transition metal complex electrolytes instead of the I−/I3− couple.
2. Co-based redox mediators
2.1 Co-bipyridine-based mediators
In 2002, Sapp and coworkers studied a series of cobalt complexes including terpyridine, bipyridine, and phenanthroline.33 DSSCs based on [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ (Table 1) and dye N3 electrolyte showed the best efficiency; 80% of that of a comparable I−/I3−-mediated DSSC. The electrochemical results indicated a dramatic surface dependence of the electron transfer kinetics, which empirical evidence suggests as a necessary attribute for an efficient mediator. In their next publication, the same group improved the characteristics of the [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ as an electrolyte, through adding a co-mediator (PZT = phenothiazine or ferrocene) with the ability of fast electron transfer.34 The I–V curve outcomes showed that using a PZT/Co(II) mixture as a mediator leads to more desirable performance compared to Co(II/III)-based systems. Furthermore, both the Voc and FF in the PZT/Co(II) cell remarkably increased with respect to I−/I3−-based cells. They also observed that the PZT/Co(II) system is more efficient than the Fc/Co(II) mixture system, because the interception of Fc+ by Co(II) is not fast enough to prevent recombination between Fe(II) and the electrons in the TiO2.

By employing electron transfer mediator systems such as [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+, it is feasible to investigate new options to address the distance between charge collecting substrates. This is a significant factor in a cell’s performance that is unavailable with the I−/I3− mediator system.35 By employing transparent conducting metal-oxide electrodes and operating two cells in optical tandem in [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+-mediated DSSCs, both the Isc and the overall cell efficiency can be increased.
Nakade et al. reported the roles of electrolytes in DSSCs on charge recombination using two different cobalt complex redox couples of CoII(abpn) (abpn = propylene-1,2-bis(o-iminobenzylideneaminato)) and [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+.36 It was found that an increase in CoII complex concentration leads to the density reduction of dye cations, which will improve the Isc value. Due to the slow charge-transfer kinetics and the cationic nature of the Co complex redox couples, they are more likely to experience recombination with photoelectrons from TiO2. Using Li+ as an electrolyte additive resulted in increasing of the electron lifetime for a specific Co(II/III) electrolyte, which was attributed to the decreased local concentration of Co(III) on the TiO2 surface. Additionally, TBP (tert-butyl pyridine) with Li+ increased Isc and the electron lifetime, since TBP facilitates the charge transfer from Co(II) to the dye cation by changing the reorganization energy between Co(II) and Co(III).
Nelson et al. studied the diffusion of [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ in DSSCs, which clearly proved that diffusion of [Co(dtb)3]3+ is dramatically slower than that of I3− under operating DSSC conditions.37 This difference may be attributed to the greater size and slower bulk diffusion of [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+, the greater viscosity of cobalt complex solutions, and a possible electrostatic surface interaction of [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ within the TiO2 film.
In order to minimize the recombination between photoinjected electrons and Co(III) species, a thin Al2O3 blocking layer was used over the mesoporous TiO2 surface.38 The overall efficiency increment is more than double, increasing from 0.94% (TiO2) to 2.48% (TiO2 + Al2O3) under 300 W m−2 AM 1.5 illumination. In addition, further investigation of [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+, [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ (Table 1), and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ mediators progressed with Al2O3-coated TiO2 films, which decreases the rate of recombination for all electrolytes investigated by Klahr and Hamann.39 In order to determine the reason for the remarkable variations between photovoltaic parameters, impedance measurements were performed on DSSCs based on these cobalt bipyridyl redox couples. The differences in the lifetimes (recombination kinetics) of cobalt redox couple DSSCs have a coherent correlation with the differences in IPCEs. The trend of IPCEs for DSSCs and the lifetimes at a given electrode potential was found to decrease in the order: [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ > [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. This order is strong evidence that the external quantum efficiencies of DSSCs with cobalt polypyridyl redox couples are limited by recombination.39 With the dye [Ru(bpy)2(4,4′-dicarboxy-bpy)](PF6)2, cobalt redox couples presented better dye regeneration abilities compared to I−/I3−, and this is an advantage of Co complex shuttles. These results indicate that the structures of the Co redox shuttles are also very important to the DSSCs. The tert-butyl units of the ligands in the complex can act as spacers, and so decrease the electronic coupling by a factor of 20 relative to methyl-substituted ones. Moreover, the [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ couple can generate a significant external quantum yield compared to [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+. Nevertheless, the photovoltaic performances of both are inhibited by mass transport of the oxidized species. In another study based on [Co(phen)3](ClO4)2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) and its derivatives, similar behavior was observed.40
Feldt et al. developed a suitable combination of cobalt polypyridine complexes and organic sensitizers (D35 and D29) to overcome the mass transport and recombination limitations associated with cobalt polypyridine redox electrolytes.25 Organic dyes have typically higher extinction coefficients than the standard ruthenium sensitizers, which use ionic liquids or solid-state hole conductors, since they allow good light harvesting efficiencies using thinner TiO2 films. In a thinner TiO2 film, the current is clearly limited by slow mass transport through the mesoporous TiO2 film, and the risk of recombination will be lost. Both of the cobalt polypyridine mediators and the organic dye structures showed significant effects on the efficiencies of DSSCs. An overall conversion efficiency of 6.7% was obtained with DSSC sensitized with D35 and employing a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based electrolyte, while the I−/I3− yields an efficiency of 5.5% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination. The high efficiency obtained with D35 was related to the efficient blocking of the recombination by the bulky alkoxy substituents on the dye. However, for D29 featuring with N,N-dimethylanilinyl units, the recombination process easily proceeds between electrons in TiO2 and Co(III) species in the electrolyte. In addition, the photocurrent and photovoltage of the device were improved by the cobalt redox system, with the highest diffusion coefficients and more suitable redox potentials. Also, DSSCs sensitized with organic dyes in the presence of cobalt-based mediators are promising candidates for indoor applications. This happens because the voltage and efficiency remain high under low light intensities.25 Additionally, the surface modification of TiO2 thin film electrodes by fluorine plasma treatment41 and utilization of different low cost carbon materials as counter electrodes42 were investigated by employing the Co(II/III) redox shuttle and the organic D35 sensitizer. Mesoporous TiO2 microbeads were also tested as a working electrode in DSSCs based on the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte, for which power conversion efficiencies up to 6.4% were obtained with D35.43
D35 only harvests sunlight below 620 nm, which limits the Isc to 10–11 mA cm−2. Tsao et al. achieved an impressive efficiency of 9.6% by modifying this sensitizer by introducing a cyclopentadithiophene bridging unit and improving its red absorption.27 Due to the higher redox potential, the lower light absorption and an unexpected broadening of the IPCE in the red region of the spectrum, the new Y123 dye achieves higher conversion efficiencies with the Co(II/III) redox couple rather than the analogous iodine-based electrolyte. Additionally, C243-sensitized solar cells with a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle attained an efficiency of 8.9%.44
In addition, two new organic D–π–A dyes including NT35 and G220 were synthesized, which comprise a BPTPA (N-(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-N-(4-bromophenyl)-2′,4′-bis(hexyloxyy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine) donor. Both dyes exhibited a greater IPCE response with cobalt-based redox shuttles, compared to the classical I−/I3− electrolyte.45 Among these dyes, G220 showed the best photovoltaic performance. The results proved that the organic dyes based on this bulky BPTPA donor are promising candidates for cobalt-based DSSCs, due to suppressing the electron recombination between the TiO2 surface and the redox oxide species.
Moreover, the effect of 4-TBP in triphenylamine-based organic DSSCs was examined using the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle.46 The higher amount of TBP in the mediator increases the viscosity of the electrolyte and hence slows down the diffusion of Co(III) species. This is a unique observation for a Co(II/III) electrolyte, which is not detected in the I−/I3− electrolyte. Increasing the TBP concentration improved the open-circuit potential, which could be attributed to the reduced interfacial recombination as well as a negative shift in the conduction band level of TiO2.
Another hypothesis in the application of Co complexes is to develop the mediator mixture, which proposes that the electrolyte could employ two or more redox couples to achieve the multistep electron transfer processes. Thus the electron recombination decreases to improve the electron-collection efficiency.47–50 An easily accessible homoleptic Ru complex containing dissymmetrical bipyridine in the presence of the mediator mixture of [Co(dtb)3]2+ and [Fe(dmb)3]2+ achieved the best results and offered an adequate balance between regeneration of the dye and back recombination with photoinjected electrons in TiO2.49 Despite a lower regeneration kinetic, the bulky effect of [Co(dtb)3]2+/[Fe(dmb)3]2+ led to slower recombination rates and better overall performance.49 Using these mediators, the related dye49 displayed interesting performance (65%), slightly lower than those obtained for bis-heteroleptic dyes48 (68 and 75% IPCE, respectively). Combination of the mediators based on cobalt complexes and adequate co-mediators based on iron complexes can be used to improve the electron-collection efficiency in Ru-thienyl tpy-sensitised solar cells.50 In combination with an Ru-based dye, the charge-collection efficiency was improved by efficient dye regeneration and retarded recombination losses. Additionally, chronocoulometry experiments demonstrated that the efficiency of the regeneration cascade is critically dependent on the ability of the Co(II) complex to intercept Fe(III) centers. The relatively low concentration of the Fe complex could be rapidly captured by the Co complex after dye regeneration, thus preventing the injected electrons in the semiconductor from recombining with the oxidized Fe complex. Maximum IPCEs of 65% and 20% were obtained with Co(dtb)/Fe(dmb) and I−/I3−, respectively.
DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.5% were fabricated using [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox electrolyte with the Z907 sensitizer.51 This better performance relative to benchmark sensitizer N719 was explained by near-IR transmittance measurements in conjunction with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the small-perturbation electron diffusion length (Ln) is significantly longer in Z907 cells in comparison with that in N719 cells, which explains the differences in performance. In addition, it is demonstrated that the longer Ln in Z907 cells is caused by inhibited recombination, as opposed to faster transport, and the possible reasons are discussed.
Moreover, applying of bulky substitutions in a new heteroleptic Ru(II)-based complex, TT-230, was investigated to obtain high open-circuit potentials in DSSCs with cobalt redox shuttles.52 The electrolytes based on cobalt complexes have revealed substantial advantages in terms of achievable Voc values compared to the standard I−/I3− redox mediators. These merits of the cobalt mediators were realized with a porphyrin dye, reaching a Voc greater than 1 V in a DSSC,53 which could not be attained with Ru(II) complexes due to the enhanced recombination. Anyway, the TT-230 dye provided an example of a bulky Ru(II) dye reaching a high Voc in a DSSC in combination with the Co(II/III) redox couple.52
However, the disadvantages of the cobalt-based electrolytes include the rapid recombination of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band with the oxidized Co(III) species, mass transport problems in the mesoporous TiO2 electrode and low diffusion coefficients. Thus, different TiO2 films are used to suppress the recombination and improve the redox transport. Kim et al. developed a facile approach to solve the mass transport problem in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte system by tuning the porosity of mesoporous TiO2 films. When increasing the porosity from 0.52 to 0.59, despite the decrease of 23% in dye loading, the photocurrent density was improved by nearly two times. An MK-2-sensitized solar cell showed an efficiency of 5.5% at 1 sun.54 In addition, [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ has been used, resulting in 2.4% efficiency with N719-sensitized 35 μm TiO2 nanotubes.55
Highly porous counter electrodes based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) displayed much better electrocatalytic activity for the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. Also, due to both charge-transfer resistance and stability, the GNP film was better than those of the traditional Pt-based electrode under prolonged potential cycling. Higher efficiencies obtained when PEDOT, a highly porous cathode based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), was employed as a catalyst on the counter electrode. It shows much lower charge transfer resistance for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox shuttles.56 The fabricated solar cell with this electrode, sensitized with dye Y123 and the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple indicated an excellent power conversion efficiency of 10.3%. However, different PEDOT-based counter electrodes in the presence of Co(II/III) polypyridine redox mediators were compared to Pt- and Al-coated electrodes in order to evaluate the potential use of PEDOT counter electrodes in DSSCs.57 Also, two different kinds of nanocomposites, TiC-PEDOT and TiN-PEDOT, utilizing a Co(II/III) polypyridyl redox mediator and MK2 dye, showed equivalent or higher photovoltaic conversion efficiencies compared to cells with pristine PEDOT or Pt-coated electrodes.58
Electron-transfer reactions from TiO2 nanoparticle films to [Co(dmb)3]3+ and [Ru(bpy)2(NMI)2]3+ (NMI = N-methylimidozole) redox shuttles through both measurements and modeling showed an excellent agreement between the modeled and measured lifetimes.59 The highly positive redox shuttle [Ru(bpy)2(NMI)2]2+/3+ was also used to probe the details of dark current density in DSSCs.60
Using the standard [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple and a newly designed donor–π-bridge–acceptor zinc porphyrin, YD2-o-C8, comprising two alkyl chains and four alkoxy chains on the ligand of the complex, an efficiency of 11.9% was achieved.53 The alkyl chains greatly retard the rate of interfacial back-electron transfer to the Co(III) mediator, which enables attainment of strikingly high photovoltages of 1 V. Remarkably, the co-sensitization of YD2-o-C8 with the organic D–π–A dye Y123 yielded an efficiency of 12.3% when used in conjunction with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based redox electrolyte.53 The improvement in photovoltaic performance over the devices containing an iodide redox mediator was due to an increase in Voc.78 This system generated a strikingly high photovoltage close to 1 volt and has an impressive photocurrent density, due to the specific molecular design of YD2-o-C8. This greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the TiO2 film to the Co(III) mediator. A study is currently focused in this direction to improve the performance of various sensitizers with cobalt-based redox electrolytes.78 In addition, transparent conductive oxide-less back contact DSSCs using the YD2-o-C8 dye employing a cobalt redox shuttle gave a power conversion efficiency of 4.89% under simulated solar irradiation, while that of the iodine-based electrolyte was found to be 3.05%.79
However, by modifying the YD2-o-C8 porphyrin core with the bulky bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine donor (SM371) and with incorporation of the proquinoidal benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit into SM371, the dye SM315 was afforded.72 Fig. 3 illustrates the I–V curve for the two devices measured under AM 1.5 G illumination (1000 W m−2 at 298 K). Fabrication of DSSCs utilizing the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple and SM315 showed a record of η = 13.0% at full sun illumination without the requirement of a co-sensitizer. The results showed that the SM315 is a very stable dye and not prone to degradation, even if exposed to intense sunlight for long illumination times. During the 500 h of light soaking, devices employing SM315 underwent over one million turnovers without showing any significant loss in stability.

Moreover, to understand the effect of the alkoxy groups on the zinc porphyrin dyes in conjunction with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple, two new dyes denoted Y350 and Y350-OC12, made by modifying the structure of YD2-o-C8. They were used in DSSCs and achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 12.0% under standard conditions.73
A combined experimental and computational investigation was reported by Mosconi et al. to understand the nature of the interactions between cobalt redox mediators and TiO2 surfaces sensitized by ruthenium and organic dyes. Also their impact on the performance of the corresponding DSSCs was investigated.61 Both N719- and Z907-based DSSCs exhibited an increased lifetime in iodine-based electrolyte compared to the cobalt-based redox shuttle. However the D21L6 and D25L6 organic dyes, endowed with long alkoxy chains, showed no significant change in their electron lifetime regardless of employed electrolyte, and delivered a high photovoltaic efficiency of 6.5% with a cobalt electrolyte. Additionally, a series of Co(II/III) complexes were investigated to gauge the impact of ligand substitution and metal coordination on the high spin/low spin energy difference as well as reorganization energies. The results allow tracing of the structure/property relationships required for further development of cobalt electrolyte DSSCs.61
Similar experimental and computational investigations were carried out to understand the nature of the interfaces between dye-sensitized TiO2 and cobalt-based electrolytes in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a surface co-adsorbent and additive, in combination with N719 and Z907 dyes.80 For both dyes, the concomitant use of CDCA in the dye bath and electrolyte solution led to a significant improvement, in agreement with that reported by Daeneke et al.8 for the related Fc/Fc+ redox couple.
A novel donor–π–acceptor organic dye (HIQ7) was used in DSSCs with a cobalt redox shuttle. HIQ7 comprises an electron-rich group for harvesting a broad spectrum of white light, a bulky group to suppress charge recombination and also an electron-donating group for facilitating the dye regeneration.62 The sensitized cells with HIQ7 along with a cobalt electrolyte indicated broad incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra, which cover the entire visible range with an overall conversion efficiency of 4.04%. This value was 1.65 times greater than the value observed with an iodine electrolyte.
Testing a series of metals including Al, Cu, Zn, Ni, stainless steel (StS) 304, StS 321, and Ti as a substrate for a counter electrode in DSSCs showed that some metals are a suitable choice for use with cobalt electrolytes.81 The results showed that stainless steels 304 and 321 as well as Ni and Ti are well suited to the counter electrodes in DSSCs with co-mediator. In these metals, both the lifetime and efficiency were similar to the reference cells on conducting glass substrates. In contrast, the cells with Al, Zn and Cu substrates suffered from both poor stability and low efficiency (Fig. 4), in which the SEM analysis revealed clear marks of corrosion for these three metals.

Ashbrook and Elliott demonstrated that bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) Cu(I)-based chromophores paired with [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ mediator can expertly function as dyes in DSSCs.63 These dyes have a number of photophysical similarities with trisbipyridine-Ru(II). The similarities include a strong MLCT absorption in the visible range, a relatively long excited-state lifetime, and a thermally equilibrated MLCT state that is a potent reductant. In addition, there are significant differences, including the lability of the Cu(I) dyes in solution and their long-term incompatibility with the most common mediator system, I−/I3−. [Cu(KbindDMP)(tmpDMP)]+ showed the best performance among these complexes (Isc = 0.54 mA cm−2, Voc = 570 mV, FF = 0.69).
Impedance spectroscopy was carried out over a range of temperatures to describe the electron storage, transport, and recombination in efficient DSSCs based on the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator. The corresponding mediator could contain either the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer Z907 or the state-of-the-art organic sensitizer Y123.82 The temperature dependency of the electron-transport resistance showed that the transport occurs via the states at energies lower than the commonly assumed level for the TiO2 conduction band edge. The results also showed that the nature of the sensitizing dye controls the predominant recombination route, via band gap states for Z907 and the conduction band for Y123. This could be the main reason for the superior performance of the dyes. Moreover, the DSSC devices based on new D–π–A porphyrin sensitizers LW5 and LW6 with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple showed efficiencies of 7.8% and 6.1%, respectively.71
A series of DSSCs were reported with two types of squaraines (SQs) including indole (SQ 8) and quinoline (SQ 12) as sensitizers and three different Co-based complexes with different oxidation potentials, including [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+. This study investigated the photodynamics of the different electron transfer reactions.64 The results showed that electron recombination with the oxidized redox species is faster with the Co-based complexes compared to the I−/I3− electrolytes for both SQs. This indicates that these SQs are not bulky enough to avoid the interaction between the Co(III) species and the electron in the TiO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, the regeneration rate constants and efficiencies are noticeably smaller for the cells with the different Co-based electrolytes relative to those with the I−/I3− pair. Consequently, the utilization of Co-based electrolytes in these two SQs is unfavorable for the overall efficiency of the cell, since −ΔGreg values of below 0.4 eV do not give complete regeneration efficiency.
To explore the potential mismatch between the complex mediators and N719 dye, some important cobalt redox couples with redox potentials ranging between 0.25 and 0.86 V vs. NHE, are shown in Fig. 5.

Two donor–acceptor- or push–pull-type organic dyes, Dye-O and Dye-S, were synthesized and tested in solar cell devices employing both I−/I3−-based and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediators.65 It was shown that the identity of the heteroatom can have a profound effect on dye regeneration, and in turn the Voc, as the S atoms increase the rate of the reaction between the oxidized dye and the redox mediator 25-fold with I−/I3− electrolytes, and 3-fold with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. Therefore, the careful design of molecular dyes can lead to optimization of interactions with the electrolytes, which causes further enhancement in dye regeneration.
With the aim of fabrication and characterization of Co(II/III) complex redox shuttle-based organic solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs, Xu et al. synthesized an imidazolium-functionalized Co-tris(bipyridyl) complex redox mediator ([Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+) (Table 1) with a high redox potential and good solubility in ionic liquid electrolyte, and applied it in ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs.66 The redox potential of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ is higher than both the [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− redox couples (Fig. 6). This is probably due to the substitution of imidazolium cations, which stabilize the HOMO of the complex more than the bipyridine ligand. As for Fig. 6b, the higher redox potential of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple reduces the excessive driving force for the dye regeneration reaction, due to the redox potential of 1.08 V of N719, and therefore it is beneficial for improving the Vocs of the devices. Using dye N719, overall power conversion efficiencies of 7.37% and 8.29% were attained at 100 and 50 mW cm−2 in a binary ionic liquid-based electrolyte under 1.5 solar spectrum illumination, respectively. These values are higher than those of the pure I−/I3− redox mediator under the same irradiation conditions. Moreover, after 800 h of testing, it was observed that the devices containing this new electrolyte retained around 76% of their initial conversion efficiency.

The relationship between the performance of DSSCs utilizing the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox system and the carbazole dye structure was investigated by varying the bulkiness of the donor and linker groups.67 The results showed that there is a constructive relationship between Voc and the number of n-hexylthiophene units, the bulkiness of the appendage group in the donor segment, and shortness of alkyl chains in the thiophene linker moiety. Retardation of charge recombination increased the Voc, indicating that longer and larger molecules have a better blocking function. Further, a series of efficient carbazole-based sensitizers, JM1–JM376 and JK318–JK320,77 were tested for DSSCs in the presence of Co-based redox mediators.
In addition, a one-dimensional ZnO nanowire (1D ZnO NW) and a metal-free, D–π–A-type, carbazole dye (SK1) sensitizer-based photovoltaic device with a power conversion efficiency of more than 5% have been demonstrated by employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as a redox shuttle.70 In contrast, the identical DSSC with traditional I−/I3− showed a η value of ∼4.7%. Recently, it was shown that 1D ZnO-based DSSCs using the homoleptic ruthenium(II) dipyridophenazine complex as a photosensitizer employ cobalt complexes as the redox mediators.83 The ZnO NW-based DSSCs afforded higher η values of ∼5.9% and ∼5.6% employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ complexes, respectively.
For the first time, Xiang and coworkers reported the application of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple in aqueous DSSC electrolytes in conjunction with a donor–π–acceptor dye.84 Adjusting the concentration of polyethylene glycol in the aqueous electrolyte causes an improvement in short circuit current. This can be attributed to the better diffusion of the redox mediator within the electrolyte. Additionally, replacement of platinum counter electrodes with ITO/Pt composite as counter electrodes increased energy conversion efficiency up to above 5%. Significantly, the photovoltaic parameters showed that [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based devices are more stable than [Fe(CN)6]4−/3−-based DSSCs85 under illumination. Their efficiencies drop by more than 50% within the first 10 minutes of the illumination. Most importantly, the cobalt aqueous electrolyte-based device efficiencies decrease by only 10% over the initial 30 days of testing and then remain relatively constant over the following 60 days (Fig. 7).84

N-doped hollow core–mesoporous shell carbon (N-HCMSC) capsules with high surface area were used as an efficient and alternative metal-free counter electrode for DSSCs. Applying Y123 dye and the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox system showed η and FF values up to 8.76 and 77.6%, respectively.86
A relatively simple series of cyclometalated ruthenium dyes were applied in DSSCs using [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ as a mediator, where an overall power conversion efficiency of over 3% was achieved.68
It was shown that the post treatment of the dyed photoanodes with commercially available short-chain tri-alkoxypropyl silanes bearing a positive charge may be a viable successful general strategy for improving the electron collection efficiency in cobalt-mediated DSSCs. This observation happened even without the use of highly sterically hindered dyes specifically designed to work in conjunction with kinetically fast metal-based mediators.87
To examine the relationship between donor type in an organic dye and the recombination in DSSCs, various organic dyes were investigated in conjugation with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couples.69 These dyes comprise donor moieties including carbazole (MK-1), coumarin (MK-31), triphenylamine (MK-88) and N-phenyl-carbazole (MK-90). The highest Voc and the longest electron lifetime were obtained with MK-88, which is attributed to the blocking effect by steric hindrance of the donor nonplanar structure. On the other hand, the lowest Voc and shortest electron lifetime were attained with MK-31, proposing that coumarin attracts the cobalt redox shuttles to the surface of the TiO2 layer. This leads to an increase in the concentration of the cobalt complex.
Cong et al. investigated a new TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy)–Co tandem redox system with TEMPO0/+ and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ for DSSCs.74 A large increase of 862 to 965 mV in Voc was detected in the new tandem redox system while the Isc was essentially maintained. Conversion efficiencies of 7.1% and 8.4% were obtained for cells containing the single [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple and the TEMPO–Co tandem redox system, respectively. LEG4 was used as a sensitizer in these cases. Improving Voc and the overall efficiency was ascribed to the partial regeneration of the sensitizing dye molecules by TEMPO. Using the new redox system, the problem of faster recombination of the single TEMPO redox couple was resolved and the mass transport of the metal-complex-based electrolyte was also improved. In addition, this TEMPO–Co tandem system has avoided the corrosive effects of iodine in the electrolyte as well as showing a much higher Voc and conversion efficiency. This result shows the better performance of the TEMPO–Co tandem system compared to the single redox electrolyte systems based on Co. As seen in Fig. 8, the electron transfer processes can be formalized in the form of two cycles of redox exchange reactions. The first one is the single-component Co2+/3+ redox cycle, and the second is the synergistic TEMPO0/+–Co(II/III) cycle. So, a hopeful future can be imagined for tandem systems instead of single redox shuttles in electrolytes for DSSCs.

YA422 is a typical organic sensitizer with an indoline-based Hagfeldt-type donor. As a matter of fact, “Hagfeldt”-type donors based on indoline and triphenylamine are widely used to construct D–π–A organic sensitizers for DSSCs with cobalt redox shuttles. Hence the overall efficiency of 10.65% was attained through dye YA422 with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox electrolyte based on a single organic sensitizer.75 In addition, two new pyrido[3,4-b]-pyrazine-based sensitizers with different cores of bulky donors including indoline for DT-1 and triphenylamine for DT-2, were investigated with cobalt electrolytes.1 The strongly electron-withdrawing pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine-based auxiliary acceptor was discovered to extend the absorption wavelength range, and an increased Isc of the DSSC compared to dye YA422 was seen. A photoelectric conversion efficiency of 8.57% was obtained with DSSCs based on DT-1 with a cobalt redox electrolyte under standard AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight.
More recently, a back-illuminated DSSC with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple and the organic dye MK-2 was considered as a replacement for the I−/I3− redox electrolyte and organic metallic dye N719.88 Using thin TiO2 films together with the naturally formed blocking layer at the outermost surface of the Ti substrate successfully alleviated the drawbacks of the cobalt mediator. By virtue of these simultaneous effects, it attained a highly promising power conversion efficiency of 7.12%. This suggests that the cobalt redox complex is a particularly promising alternative redox mediator for back-illuminated DSSCs.
The photovoltaic parameters and the corresponding dyes for DSSCs based on Co redox shuttles are summarized in Tables 1–3 to provide a clear overall sense of the literature.

2.2 Co-phenanthroline-based mediators
Due to the limited electron diffusion length found for the cobalt complexes, Wang’s group employed different organic sensitizers based on the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle in combination with relatively thin TiO2 films of about 6 to 7 μm. They attained overall power conversion efficiencies of 7.1%, 7.7%, 8.0% and 8.4% with C230,89 C233,89 T390 and C24591 dyes, respectively. Even higher efficiencies were achieved using C218 dye100 (9.3%)91 as well as C229 (9.4%), showing a significant red shift at the absorption edge.92
However, the optimization of DSSCs sensitized with M14 in combination with [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox electrolyte yielded a DSSC with an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.2% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).93 The hexapropyltruxene unit retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the TiO2 film to the oxidized electrolyte. This process enables the ability of high photovoltages approaching to 0.9 V. Further more, a better efficiency was obtained with a truxene-based organic dye (M16)-sensitized device and [Co(phen)3]2+/3+, which displays an efficiency of 7.6% at standard conditions. Additionally, studies of the recombination kinetics of Co(III) complexes at a titania/dye interface with D–π–A organic dyes including M36 and M37 showed that a Marcus inverted region can be reached for the charge recombination kinetics behavior of Co(III) species for M36-sensitized DSSCs.98 Benefiting from a Marcus inverted region behavior, the M36 dye displayed good compatibility with [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox couples.
Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP)-based triphenylamine sensitizers (XS54–XS57) with different hexyloxyphenyl (HOP) substituents were synthesized and applied in DSSCs along with the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle.95 XS54, featuring the 4-HOP-DTP spacer yielded a η of 8.14% in combination with the cobalt electrolyte. Additionally, the photovoltaic performances of the [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ redox couple were superior to those of the I−/I3− redox couple for TiO2 film DSSCs sensitized by XS51–XS52. This demonstrates that the rational design of sterically bulky organic dyes is needed for further progress of high-efficiency iodine-free devices.99
DSSCs constructed via a novel metal-free alkoxysilyl carbazole as a sensitizing dye and a Co(II/III) complex redox electrolyte showed an overall efficiency of over than 12% with a Voc higher than 1 V by applying a hierarchical multi-capping treatment to the photoanode.96 This dye was used with two Co-based mediators including [Co(Cl-phen)3]2+/3+ (Table 2) and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. A higher Voc value was obtained with the former, which has a redox potential of 0.72 V vs. NHE in the ADEKA-1-sensitized cell.
A mixture of [Co(phen)3]2+/3+ and [Co(EtPy)2]2+/3+ complexes was utilized as a redox mediator in DSSCs, where EtPy is a terpyridine ligand bearing a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) substituent.97 The [Co(EtPy)2]2+ complex acts as a co-mediator in the presence of [Co(phen)3]2+. The low solubility of this complex prevents its individual application. The addition of [Co(EtPy)2]2+ to [Co(phen)3]2+ provided an electron cascade that leads to an enhancement in cell efficiency. A synergy between the EDOT-functionalized cobalt complex and the PEDOT counter electrode is responsible for this effect, which favors electron transfer and reduces the recombination.
2.3 Other mediators of Co complexes
In 2001, for the first time, Nusbaumer et al. employed [Co(dbbip)2]2+ (dbbip = 2,6-bis(1′-butylbenzimidazol-2′-yl)pyridine) (Table 3) as a redox shuttle in DSSCs in order to explain the effects of a cobalt electrolyte on the recombination process.101 With this new one-electron redox shuttle, DSSCs sensitized by dye Z316 achieved an overall electrical power conversion efficiency of 2.2% under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The results showed that in the absence of the Co(II/III) redox couple, the absorption signal was decreased as a result of an increase in the dynamic recombination process between oxidized dye and the conduction band of the semiconductor.101 In addition, this group reported a series of cobalt complexes used as redox shuttles in DSSC electrolytes.102 Among the compounds investigated, [Co(dbbip)2]2+/3+ showed the highest efficiency of 4.2% together with a ruthenium-based dye, Z907. Through screening the redox couple, they demonstrated a relationship between the redox potential and Voc in a way where Voc increases with E1/2. Furthermore, their results showed the influence of the sensitizer structure on the behavior of the cobalt redox couple. An explanation for this observation is that when the dye is less sterically hindered, there is the possibility of forming an ion pair with the Co(III). This means a reduction in the diffusion rate of Co(III) that can affect the overall photocurrent negatively.102 The electrochemical properties of the redox mediator [Co(dbbip)2]2+/3+ were also studied in a mixed acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate solvent using a range of techniques in order to determine the rate constants for electron transfer and the diffusion coefficients of the Co(II) and Co(III) species.103
Wang and coworkers indicated that the electron diffusion length in DSSCs is substantially reduced when the conventional I−/I3− electrolyte is replaced with the [Co(dbbip)2]2+ redox shuttle complex.104
Nevertheless, optimization of the cell efficiencies also requires optimization of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Thus, in order to improve the efficiency, an FTO-supported graphene nanoplatelet cathode (GNP-FTO) was applied in DSSCs based on the Co-bipyridine-pyrazole redox couple. The exchange currents for the [Co(L)2]2+/3+ (L = 6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) couple on the GNP electrode scaled linearly with the GNP film’s optical absorbance, and they were 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than those for the I−/I3− couple on the same electrode. DSSCs with Y123 dye adsorbed on a TiO2 photoanode reached energy conversion efficiencies between 8 and 10% for both GNP- and Pt-based cathodes.105
Moreover, a [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+/3+ complex with tridentate ligands adsorbed on TiO2 acted as a redox mediator in combination with Y123 dye. This combination yielded a power conversion efficiency of over 10% at 100 mW cm−2.24 A device kept at ambient conditions showed no loss in the conversion efficiency after 1 month, which is a promising result. This result shows that the molecularly engineered cobalt redox couple is a legitimate alternative to the commonly used I−/I3− redox shuttle. Recently, a peak power conversion efficiency of 10.6% was achieved under full sunlight intensity through employing the same mediator and dye, and modifying fluorine-doped tin oxide using a thin and conformal TiO2 blocking layer by the ALD technique.106
A series of cobalt complexes with various polypyridyl ligands containing electron acceptor groups on pyridyl or pyrazole groups used as one-electron redox mediators in DSSCs together with a polymer-based cathode, resulting in an excellent performance.107 The performance of DSSCs using the molecularly engineered cobalt redox couple and a poly(3,4-alkylthiophene)-based cathode was better than the I−/I3− redox shuttle with a platinized cathode, and the efficiencies increased from 1.61 to 10.24% at 0.1 sun irradiation.
The application of a new class of redox mediators based on [Co(PY5Me2)(MeCN)]2+/3+ complex (Table 3) was reported by Kashif et al. (where PY5Me2 is the pentadentate ligand 2,6-bis(1,1-bis(2-pyridyl)ethyl)pyridine).108 By X-ray crystallography, it was shown that the MeCN ligand can be replaced with more strongly coordinating Lewis bases (B) to give complexes with the general formula of [Co(PY5Me2)(B)]2+/3+, where B = 4-TBP or N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI). Thus, applying a pentadentate ligand allows not only the potential for the Co(II/III) redox couple to be tuned through single-site coordination, but is also expected to result in a lower reorganizational energy for electron transfer in comparison to the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. I–V curves show the best performing DSSCs for each redox couple (Fig. 9). The lower Isc values for [Co(PY5Me2)(TBP)]2+/3+ could be a consequence of less efficient dye regeneration, and may arise from the lower driving force for this reaction (0.24 V). Also, for devices based on [Co(PY5Me2)(NMBI)]2+/3+, mass transport limitations compared to [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ were found. Employment of the electrolytes based on the [Co(PY5Me2)(NMBI)]2+/3+ complex in combination with a strongly absorbing organic dye, MK2, yielded devices with efficiencies of 9.2% and 8.4% at 0.1 and 1 sun irradiation, respectively. These values are higher than the analogous devices applying the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple. In addition, a Voc of almost 1.0 V at 100% sun was measured for devices fabricated with the TBP complex.108

Moreover, stable DSSC electrolytes based on Co(II/III) complexes of a hexadentate pyridine ligand (6,6′-bis(1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, bpyPY4) were reported by the same group.109 The devices fabricated with these mediators were found to outperform the prototypical [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator both in terms of the overall efficiency and stability under full sun irradiation conditions. An impressive efficiency of 8.3% was attained for the DSSCs based on this redox couple. DSSCs based on this electrolyte outperformed those assembled with the reference mediator Co-bpy, showing a > 20% performance increase over the first 24 h of continuous illumination (Fig. 10). With TFMP (p-trifluoromethylpyridine), the DSSCs based on [Co(bpyPY4)]2+/3+ presented a 20% increase in performance, which was maintained across the full 100 h testing period. In the case of NMBI, the DSSCs exhibited the same initial improvement in performance but there was a gradual decreasing in the stabilization at about 90% of the original value after 100 h testing.109
 Fig. 10  Normalized efficiencies of the devices in a full sun irradiation aging experiment are shown with a 400 nm UV cut off filter. Two Lewis bases, NMBI and TFMP, were alternatively used with 1a/1b and Co-bpy (4:1, MeCN:VN). Reproduced with permission from ref. 109. Copyright 2013, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. 
A new low-spin cobalt(II) complex, [Co(ttcn)2]2+/3+ (ttcn = trithiacyclononane), was investigated as a redox shuttle for use in DSSCs.26 This unique redox shuttle is stable, transparent and easy to synthesize from commercial ligands. It also has attractive energetic and kinetic features for use in DSSCs. Moreover, the formal potential of [Co(ttcn)2]2+/3+ is 0.69 V versus NHE, which is ∼60 mV more positive than [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. Therefore, it potentially permits greater photovoltages. Initial results showed that the overall performance of dye N719 is restricted by recombination, due to the more positive potential and larger self-exchange rate constant of [Co(ttcn)2]2+/3+ compared to that of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. However, a better performance was obtained with Z907 sensitizer and deposition of an ultrathin alumina coating on nanoparticle-based TiO2 DSSC photoanodes. The performance of MK-2 dye is significantly improved in comparison with DSSCs employing Z907, with an efficiency of over 2% achieved for the [Co(ttcn)2]2+/3+/MK-2 system.26
It was reported that p-type DSSCs with [Co(sep)]2+/3+ (Table 3), [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, and I−/I3− redox mediators benefit from multilayer Zn(II) tetraphenylporphyrin chromophores, which are assembled through copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC).110 This is the first use of [Co(sep)]2+/3+ as a redox mediator for DSSCs, and it provides an alternative cobalt-based redox mediator for p-type DSSCs with a more negative reduction potential than [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. However, the highest current densities were attained with I−/I3− as the redox mediator, while [Co(sep)]2+/3+ generated the highest potentials. For all three electrolytes, Isc was improved with the addition of porphyrin layers beyond a monolayer. The maximum power was achieved with a device containing three porphyrin layers and a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle, which resulted in an efficiency of 1.5 × 10−3%.
Nevertheless, the Isc value reached a maximum value at a point greater than one layer, after which it decreased. This is probably due to the exciton diffusion limitations and the insulating effects of the multilayer film.110
Applying tris(1,2-diaminoethane)cobalt(II/III) complexes ([Co(en)3]2+/3+) as redox mediators in p-DSSCs was reported with a redox potential about 340 mV more negative than that of typical I−/I3−-based p-DSSC electrolytes.111 This offers the dramatically increasing the Voc of p-DSSCs. The [Co(en)3]2+/3+ electrolytes are optically transparent, making them suitable for use in tandem solar cells. Photocathodes based on this mediator produced a highest Voc of 709 mV with an efficiency of 1.3%.
Moreover, cobalt-bis-2,2′,6′,2′′-terpyridine complexes allow systematic tuning of the redox potential by variation of the substituents on the terpyridine ligand. This ultimately improves the open circuit voltage and the efficiency of the device. Two cobalt terpyridine complexes including [Co(terpy)2](B(CN)4)2/3 and [Co(Cl-terpy)2](TFSI)2/3 as redox electrolytes highlighted the importance of the ligand substitution. This determines the dark current and Voc values of the device due to tuning of the electrolyte energy level. The redox potential of the [Co(Cl-terpy)2](TFSI)2 mediator is 130 mV more positive than the [Co(terpy)2](B(CN)4)2 mediator. The [Co(Cl-terpy)2](TFSI)2/3-based electrolyte in combination with Y123 dye yielded an overall η of 8.7% under standard conditions, with Voc values of over 900 mV.9
3. Fe-based redox mediators
Iron (Fe) is the most common and economic element in comparison with other metals on the earth. Table 4 shows the structures of Fe complexes as redox shuttles used in DSSCs together with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Among Fe compounds, the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple has great advantages as a redox system due to its remarkable electrochemical properties. However, one-electron redox couples also feature enhanced recombination with photoinjected electrons. Therefore, methods are needed to inhibit this recombination for functioning DSSCs, which eliminates the photovoltaic effect.112 A study of the interfacial recombination processes in DSSCs has been carried out by Gregg and coworkers, which introduces two techniques for passivating these interfaces in order to decrease the recombination loss rates.32 These methods lead to a marked decrease in the rate of interfacial charge recombination by creating an electrochemical overpotential for the recombination process. Therefore, they allow employment of kinetically fast redox shuttles in DSSCs.32 In 2010, Feldt et al. passivated dye-sensitized TiO2 surfaces by a CH3SiCl3 reaction in order to decrease the fast recombination rates when using the ferrocene redox couple.112 The insulating poly(methylsiloxane) film on the dye-sensitized TiO2 surface acts as an efficient barrier for interfacial electron-transfer processes (photoinjected electrons with ferrocenium). Thus, the efficiency of the DSSC will be improved. Significant efficiency was obtained after two cycles of silane treatment for both N719 (0.36%) and Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy) (0.51%) as sensitizers.112

Moreover, atomic layer deposition was used as a useful method to create conformal TiO2 blocking layers on FTO substrates in DSSCs, effectively eliminate shunting.113,114 These modified electrodes allow Fc/Fc+, an outer-sphere redox couple, to be used as an electrolyte. The results showed that the addition of a blocking layer can dramatically improve the photovoltaic performance. These counteractions have interesting effects on the DSSC efficiency, but the resulting devices did not show high efficiencies (η < 0.4%).
Energy conversion efficiencies of 7.5% for DSSCs combining the archetypal ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) single-electron redox couple with a novel metal-free organic donor–acceptor sensitizer (Carbz-PAHTDTT) were reported by Daeneke et al.8 Under the same conditions, these Fc/Fc+-based devices exceed the efficiency achieved for the I−/I3− electrolyte. This reveals the great potential of ferrocene-based mediators in future DSSC applications and more favorable matching of the redox potential with that of the dye. Moreover, they reported a series of ferrocene derivatives whose redox potentials cover a wide range (0.09–0.94 V vs. NHE) by virtue of simple alkylation and halogenation of the cyclopentadienyl ring (Br2Fc0/+, BrFc0/+, EtFc0/+, Et2Fc0/+ and Me10Fc0/+).115 Solar conversion efficiencies of 4.3–5.2% and also IPCE results were attained using Fc, Et2Fc and EtFc. The BrFc and Br2Fc displayed lower energy conversion efficiencies than Et2Fc, EtFc and Fc even with their more favorable redox potentials. In addition, the results indicated that Et2Fc, EtFc and Fc promote fast dye regeneration by providing driving forces of 35–46 kJ mol−1. However, this is not the case for BrFc and Br2Fc, in which the driving forces are ≤18 kJ mol−1. To improve the efficiency of Fc-based DSSCs, the ferrocene derivatives should also be matched to dyes with appropriate energy levels, such that ΔE = 0.36 V. Consequently, the halogen and alkylated ferrocene derivatives could be utilized in conjunction with dyes and panchromatic dyes showing higher and lower D/D+ potentials, respectively.115
A Fc/Fc+ redox couple was employed as a model electrolyte in quantum dot DSSCs.116 Furthermore, a similar redox couple of a prussian blue-type nickel hexacyanoferrate redox mediator, K4NiII[FeII(CN)6]/K3NiII[FeIII(CN)6], was used in solid-state DSSCs.117
The current consensus is that water is an undesirable contaminant in DSSC electrolytes as it causes to the formation of iodate, dye desorption, low device efficiencies and device instability. However, Daeneke et al. exhibited that the carbazole dye, MK2, performs exceptionally well in DSSCs constructed with aqueous electrolytes, and efficiencies of over 4% can be reached by applying the [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− redox couple.85 The devices were found to demonstrate an increased stability when short wavelength light (<480 nm) was omitted. This confirms the photocatalytic degradation of the redox couple as a cause of the reduced device stability under white light illumination. However, the cyanide ligands might be replaced with stronger binding ligands, improving the stability. Fig. 11 shows a negligible efficiency drop for a cobalt cell when it was left in ambient conditions for about three months.

In an interesting study, efficient p-type DSSCs based on the readily available and inexpensive coordination complex tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III)/(II) ([Fe(acac)3]0/1) as a redox mediator in conjunction with the PMI-6T-TPA sensitizer were reported.118 Despite a 170 mV more negative redox potential of [Fe(acac)3]0/1 compared to [Co(en)3]2+/3+, the Voc values of [Fe(acac)3]-p-DSSCs were lower than those measured for [Co(en)3]-p-DSSCs. Nonetheless, the [Fe(acac)3]-p-DSSCs displayed higher IPCEs (57%) than those based on [Co(en)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− (Fig. 12). Measurement of the kinetics of dye regeneration by the [Fe(acac)3]0/1 complex revealed that the process is diffusion-limited, quantitative (>99%), and about 50 times faster than the value related to [Co(en)3]3+. Devices containing [Fe(acac)3]0/1 and a NiO blocking layer together with chenodeoxycholic acid as an electrolyte additive attained an efficiency of 2.51%.

4. Cu-based redox mediators
For the first time, in 2005, a series of blue copper model complexes ([Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/−, [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ and [Cu(phen)2]2+/+) (Table 5) were examined for their effectiveness as redox shuttles in DSSCs by Yanagida and coworkers.119 They afford a maximum IPCE of 40%, which is thought to stem from slow regeneration of the N3 ruthenium photosensitizer owing to the large reorganization energies of copper(I/II) complexes.120 The resulting electron self-exchange rate constant decreases in the order of: [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ > [Cu(SP)(mmt)]0/− > [Cu(phen)2]2+/+. This is in agreement with the order of the smaller structural change between the copper(II) and copper(I) complexes, due to their distorted tetragonal geometry. Under weak solar light irradiation of 20 mW cm−2 intensity, a maximum η value was obtained as 2.2% for DSSCs using [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+. Whereas, a higher Voc of the cell was attained compared to that of the conventional I−/I3− couple.119 The [Cu(dmp)2]2+/+ redox shuttle was employed in combination with a bilayer titania thin film stained with a high-absorption-coefficient organic dye C218, which generates an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.0%.121 A broad 87% IPCE plateau of about 87% was observed in the spectral coverage from 460 to 580 nm for a typical cell with the iodine control electrolyte (Fig. 13). However, the copper redox shuttle displayed very low electron transfer rates on several noble metals, carbon black and conducting oxides, resulting in the poor fill factor.

A series of Cu(I/II) redox shuttles based on substituted bipyridines and pyridyl–quinoline complexes were used as electron transfer mediators in regenerative photoelectrochemical cells (Table 5).122 The best performing mediators attained maximum IPCEs of the order of 35–40%. Such low efficiencies could be explained by slow dye reduction, leading to modest Isc values, rather than by an efficient photoinjected electron/Cu(II) recombination, since both the Voc and the FF obtained with copper-mediated cells were higher than those for the corresponding I−/I3−-based DSSC.
Yuan et al. reported two polyoxometalate (Anderson-type heteropolyanion)-supported copper phenanthroline complexes, POM1-Cu-phen and POM2-Cu-phen, into DSSC electrolytes as redox shuttles, to achieve high solar energy conversion in DSSCs.123 The combination of Anderson-type heteropolyanions restrains the fast electron–hole recombination at the dyed TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, simplifies the electron transfer from Cu(I) to dye cation, and tunes the redox potential of [Cu(phen)2]+/2+ effectively. The Voc values of the cells with POM1-Cu-phen, POM2-Cu-phen, and Cu-phen are consistent with the redox potential values and in the order: POM1-Cu-phen (472 mV) > POM2-Cu-phen (466 mV) > Cu-phen (372). In addition, under the same potential bias, the dark current for POM1/POM2-Cu-phen redox couples was strikingly smaller than that for the Cu-phen redox couple. The DSSCs based on both POM1/POM2-Cu-phen redox couples displayed higher Isc and Voc values in comparison to the Cu-phen mediator, with the result that the performance of the Cu-phen redox couple DSSCs was improved about 4 times.
5. Ni-, V- and Os-based redox mediators
Nickel complexes of Ni(III/IV)bis(dicarbollide) were employed for the first time as one-electron outer sphere and non-corrosive redox shuttles in DSSCs.31,124 In comparison with Fc/Fc+ shuttles, the [Ni(carbollide)2]−/0 (Fig. 14) system has many favorable properties including fast dye regeneration, fast mass transport, and attractive electron transfer kinetics aspects. In Fig. 14, species no. 3 and 4 exhibit high thermal stability (up to 300 °C). An impressive improvement of the efficiency in DSSCs (1.5%) was observed through TiO2 surface passivation via conformal, Å-precise atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3. At the same concentration, the regeneration was actually found to be faster than that for I−, and recombination was shown to be 1000-fold slower than for ferrocene. This could be attributed to the activation barrier of reducing Ni(IV) to Ni(III), which induces a cis-to-trans conformation change, making this reaction less prohibitive.31

Additionally, the redox potentials of Ni complexes were systematically tuned through chemical functionalization of a Ni(III/IV)bis(dicarbollide) complex in the B(9/12) positions with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.124 The presence of electron withdrawing groups makes the redox potential more positive, leading to higher Vocs. Using Ni(III/IV) shuttles, device power conversion efficiencies were achieved in the range of 0.7–2.0%.
However, utilization of high-area photoanodes consisting of silica aerogels coated with atomic-layer-deposited TiO2 in DSSCs with a Ni(III/IV)bis(dicarbollide) redox shuttle resulted in more than 2-fold enhancement in photocurrent densities, in comparison to similar cells containing photoanodes constructed from TiO2 nanoparticles.125 This effect is attributed to a combination of improved electron transport, enhanced recombination resistance across the TiO2/mediator interface, and the higher light scattering within the aerogel films. Consequently, DSSC charge collection efficiencies with this comparatively fast exchanging outer-sphere redox shuttle are improved in the TiO2 aerogel templated photoanode. Applying the transmission line model to DSSCs utilizing the Ni(III)/(IV)bis(dicarbollide) redox shuttle, the overall recombination resistance Rrec was determined to be ∼102 times smaller for Ni(IV)bis(dicarbollide) than I3− (Fig. 15). As shown in Fig. 15b, the effective diffusion length, Ln, obtained in the presence of Ni(III)/(IV)bis(dicarbollide) is approximately half of the ratio achieved in the presence of I−/I3−, at potentials near their respective Voc values.

One of the important advantages of using transition metal complexes as redox shuttles in DSSCs is that their redox potentials can be tuned by modifying the ligands, which distinguishes them from the I−/I3− system. In 2013, the oxidovanadium(IV/V) couple ([VO(salen)]0/+) was introduced as a mediator in DSSCs.30 The redox potential of the [VO(salen)]0/+ couple is desirable as a mediator in order to increase the photovoltage, as it is ca. 0.3 V more positive than that of the conventional I−/I3− couple at 0.34 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as well as because of its suitability for regenerating or reducing the oxidized dye molecules. Due to the more positive potential of [VO(salen)]0/+ than that of the iodide, it attained a larger Voc. A photoconversion efficiency of η = 5.4% was attained with a cell composed of the 2.1 μm-thickness TiO2 layer co-adsorbed with D205/D131 (ref. 126) in conjugation with the [VO(salen)]0/+ redox couple.30 The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant ko value for [VO(salen)]0/+ was much larger than that of the iodide couple (5.3 × 10−3 cm s−1). A more important factor dominating the mediation process, the bimolecular exchange rate kex for [VO(salen)]0/+ was even larger than those of Fc0/+ in the order of 106 M−1 s−1, and was close to the very rapid reaction reported for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (1010 M−1 s−1).
Apostolopoulou reported the syntheses and physicochemical characterization of the square pyramidal oxidovanadium(IV/V) complexes (Ph4P)2[VIVO(hybeb)] and Ph4P[VVO(hybeb)], where hybeb4− is a tetradentatediamidodiphenolate(4−) ligand, as new redox mediators in DSSCs.127 The ideal properties of the complexes, comprising large electron exchange and transfer rates and a reversible redox process resulting from EPR and electrochemistry, render the vanadium complexes suitable as candidates for redox shuttles in DSSCs. Comparing oxidovanadium(IV/V) complexes [VO(hybeb)]2−/−, [VO(salen)]0/+, and I−/I3−-based electrolytes, it is found that the main difference between them is the E1/2 of the redox couple [VO(hybeb)]2−/−, which is 0.49 and 0.63 V less positive than the redox potentials of [VO(salen)]0/+ and I−/I3− respectively. A highest energy conversion efficiency of 2% was obtained with the commercial Ru-based sensitizer N719 absorbed on a TiO2 semiconducting film in the DSSC under simulated sunlight. However, theoretical studies revealed that the HOMO of [VO(hybeb)]2− is more positive than the HOMO of the N719 dye, but this energy difference is fairly small; thus, the driving force for dye regeneration is not optimal.127
Hamann et al. studied the self-exchange and interfacial electron transfer rate constants in two different osmium redox systems including [Os(dtb)3]2+/3+ and [Os(dmb)3]2+/3+.128 Their results indicated that by attaching the bulky tert-butyl to the bipyridyl ligand, both self-exchange and interfacial electron transfer reactions become slower than unsubstituted bpy by 50 and 100 times, respectively. This is mainly because the tert-butyl group can act as a spacer on an outer-sphere redox couple and meaningfully decrease the electronic coupling of the electron transfer reaction in both self-exchange and interfacial electron-transfer processes.
The structures of various alternate redox couples based on Ni, V and Os used in DSSCs, and also the composition of electrolytes and photovoltaic parameters, are tabulated in Table 6.

6. Conclusion
In the past five years, significant advances have been realized in the modification and application of iodine-free electrolyte-based DSSCs. Since Feldt and coworkers reported their revolutionary work in 2010 regarding the power conversion efficiency of 6.8% based on an organic dye with a Co(II/III) complex mediator, an increasing number of researchers have focused on new transition metal complex electrolytes alternative to the I−/I3− system. The first results were obtained by Gratzel and coworkers in 2011. They found that, they were able to improve the conversion efficiency by over 12% through adding a Co-polypyridyl shuttle mediator to a new porphyrin sensitizer. In 2014, a second breakthrough was achieved by coupling another push–pull porphyrin dye with a redox shuttle based on Co-bipyridyl derivates. This allowed a single device to reach the efficiency record of 13%. Therefore, the design and development of alternative redox electrolytes to traditional I−/I3− are crucial and preferred for future DSSC progress.
The efforts in introducing novel transition metal complex mediators has led to a deeper understanding of dye regeneration processes and also improved the control of the open circuit voltage. The improvement in control originates from the optimization of electron accepting in the reduced state of the redox couple and produces the oxidized state of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Moreover, the key issue for the improvement of the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs is developing a suitable photosensitizer to match the different redox couples. It is worth noting that one of the major advantages of using transition metal complexes as redox couples in DSSCs is the tunability of their redox potentials by modifying the ligands. As distinguished from the I−/I3− system, the redox couple medium must be in balance with the charge transporting ability as well as match with the HOMO energy level of the dye. This could be another interesting and attractive research topic in this field.
As a consequence, this review attempts to show the important progress achieved in the mediator research area of DSSCs, and to analyze the advantages as well as the disadvantages of these complex redox couples to speed up further development of transition metal complex electrolytes.

Babak Pashaei, Hahsem Shahroosvand and Parisa Abbasi	Babak Pashaei (right) is a PhD. student (2014–present) in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Zanjan as a member of the Prof. Shahroosvand group. He obtained his M.Sc. degree at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) with a thesis on “Manganese Oxides as Models for Water Oxidizing Complex in Photosystem II” under the supervision of Prof. Mohammad Mahdi Najafpour. He started his PhD. thesis on the “Synthesis of ruthenium molecular sensitizers based on phenanthroline derivatives for DSSCs”. Hashem Shahroosvand (middle) obtained his M.Sc. degree in Inorganic chemistry from the University of Sistan & Baluchestan (2004). He received a PhD. in Inorganic Chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Mozhgan Khorasani Motlagh. Then he conducted postdoctoral work in the group of Prof. Nasser Safari and Prof. Ezeddin Mohajerani, University of Shahid Beheshti (2008–2009). He then joined the University of Zanjan, where he is currently an Associate Professor in Inorganic Chemistry. His current research interests are in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications and the design of functionalized polypyridyl complexes for OLED and DSSC applications. Parisa Abbasi (left) obtained her M.Sc degree entitled “Synthesis and characterization of novel complexes sensitized solar cell based on the precursors of phendione and non-carboxylic acid” at the University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran, under the supervision of Prof. Hashem Shahroosvand. She joined Prof. Melanie Pilkington’s group at Brock University, ON, Canada (2015-present). Her PhD studies will be on “Dual property MRI contrast agents for medical diagnostics”.

 	Fig. 1  Left: operating principle of a nanocrystalline DSSC. Schematic illustration of the electron-transfer processes occurring at the dye-sensitized heterojunction: process 1, photoexcitation of the sensitizing dye; process 1, decay of excited sensitizer; process 2, electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor; process 3, dye regeneration by accepting electrons from the reduced state of the redox couple and producing the oxidized state of the redox couple in the electrolyte; process 4, dye regeneration via the hole transporting medium; process 5, back electron transfer to the oxidized dye; process 6, the recombination process between the injected electron and the oxidized species in the hole transporting medium. The indirect path of the oxidized redox shuttle is depicted, however, the actual path is more complicated and much longer. The green arrows indicate the positive processes and the red arrows indicate the deleterious processes. Right: comparison of I–V curves for the Y123 dye with [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+/3+ (Table 3) (red lines) and I−/I3− (black lines) electrolytes.24
