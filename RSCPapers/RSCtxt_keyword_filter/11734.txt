    , Accepted 30th March 2016First published on 30th March 2016AbstractSulfonated carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) act as secondary polymerization templates for in situ preparation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). It essentially reduces the content of insulating PSS, instead of pre- or post-solvent processing, for a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS:SCNT composite electrode. The PEDOT:PSS:SCNT was characterized with regard to its composition, conformation, stability, morphology, optoelectronic devices, and work function behavior. The PEDOT:PSS:SCNT films with a low work function (4.4 eV) and remarkable optoelectronic properties (over 3500 S cm−1, ∼83% transmittance at a 70 nm thickness film) were suitably integrated as a cathode in organic solar cells (OSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.91% and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a PCE of 13.31%.
1. Introduction
Conducting polymers are of significant interest and promising candidates for transparent electrodes in flexible organic-based optoelectronic devices such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), touch panel displays, and many other scientific applications in many areas.1–4 One of the most successful conducting polymers is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which is regarded as the most promising material to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in future electronic devices.5–7 The main advantages of PEDOT:PSS are its chemical and mechanical stability, water printability, low material cost, good conductivity, high transparency, and excellent modifiability.8–10
As mentioned in many previous studies, PEDOT is insoluble in most solvents but can be dispersed in water by incorporating PSS as a counterion. PSS also acts as a charge compensator, an excellent oxidizing agent, and a template for polymerization.11–13 Nevertheless, PEDOT:PSS suffers from two fatal drawbacks that limit its further application. Pristine PEDOT:PSS has a relatively low conductivity (less than 1 S cm−1), due to the natural insulation of PSS.6,14,15 Another is that the short and coiled PEDOT chains are surrounded by a thin PSS-rich surface layer.16 Over the past decade, one method to overcome these problems is as far as possible to remove insulating PSS on the film surface via post-treatment (approaching 5000 S cm−1)15,17 of methanol, ethylene glycol, sulfuric acid, deionized water, etc.18–20 Moreover, introducing some additives such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol and carbon nanomaterials (graphene and carbon nanotube) to change the structure and conformation of PEDOT chains is another important method for high conductivity.21
Recently, to substantially avoid too much addition of the insulating PSS template and radically enhance the conductivity, polymerizing the EDOT (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) monomers in situ to form a solid PEDOT film is proposed. The vapor phase polymerization method is employed for preparing PEDOT chains, resulting in a conductivity of over 3400 S cm−1, with sheet resistances as low as 45 Ω sq.−1 at ∼70 nm thickness and transmittance over 80% in the visible spectrum.22 Unfortunately, the addition of the Fe(Tos)3 oxidizing agent and poor film-forming ability hinder its application as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices.23 Moreover, carbon materials are explored to in situ synthesize hybrid PEDOT:PSS. The obtained hybrid PEDOT:PSS exhibits a conductivity of 637 S cm−1, after the introduction of graphene at 3 wt%.24 And a ternary PEDOT:PSS/graphene/CNT composite25 is applied for thermoelectric energy conversion devices with a conductivity of 548 S cm−1 and a Seebeck coefficient of 18.0 mV K−1. However, almost all of the hybrid PEDOT:PSS just merely physically introduce carbon materials into the in situ PEDOT:PSS composite, which is the main reason for low conductivity (even lower than that of simple solvent treatment).16
In our previous study, by mixing PEDOT:PSS Clevios PH1000 with acid CNTs, an evident π–π interaction between PEDOT chains and acid CNTs favored the improvement in electrode conductivity.26,27 Herein, we present a new approach to prepare in situ PEDOT chains for aqueous dispersions by replacing a portion of PSS with the sulfonated carbon nanotube (SCNT) template. The PEDOT:PSS:SCNT systems drastically reduced the component of PSS via introducing this novel dual template polymerization method. Furthermore, the composition, conformation, morphology and optoelectronic performance of the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT composite were characterized. The PEDOT:PSS:SCNT with low work function (4.4 eV) dispersions demonstrated remarkable printability, excellent optoelectronic properties (over 3500 S cm−1, ∼83% transmittance in a 70 nm thickness film) and were successfully integrated in organic solar cell (OSC) and perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices.
2. Results and discussion
The SCNTs were prepared by a simple two steps via acid treatment (the specific process is shown in ESI†). Its dispersion in aqueous solution is greatly increased, compared with the pristine carbon nanotubes. The detailed physical and chemical properties (Raman data, UV-Vis-NIR data and electron microscopy) of SCNTs have been reported in our previous work.27 In this work, we skillfully make use of the sulfonic acid group from SCNTs acting as a template to induced EDOT polymerization. The PEDOT:PSS:SCNT dispersions were obtained by oxidative polymerization of EDOT in water-soluble SCNT and PSS solution with excellent stability (see the Experimental section). Fig. 1a shows the schematic of the dual template polymerization method for PEDOT:PSS:SCNT. The content of SCNTs is changed from 3.4 wt% to 0.4 wt% by controlling the concentration of SCNT aqueous solution. For the sake of comparison, we introduced the home-made PEDOT:PSS dispersion, commercial PEDOT:PSS suspension (Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P VP AI 4083) and a physical mixture of SCNTs with PEDOT:PSS.

The electric properties of various hybrid PEDOT:PSS composites are shown in Table 1. It is clearly found that the conductivity of home-made PEDOT:PSS (550 S cm−1) is lower than that of Clevios PH1000, with almost the same appearance in Fig. S1.† After the reduction of the PSS content to the ratio of 1:1 with EDOT, the PEDOT:PSS composite presents a sol–gel state as shown in Fig. S1,† which is difficult for further application. Based on these findings, a conductive SCNT template was introduced to make up for the lack of the PSS. When the content of SCNT is 3.4 wt%, the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT composite also shows a sol–gel solution. After a centrifugation treatment, the solution presented a faint yellow state, as shown in Fig. 1b and c, which can be recognized as a EDOT monomer. That is to say, excess SCNTs could inhibit the polymerization reaction. As the content of the SCNT component is reduced, the hybrid PEDOT:PSS composite became a suspension state, with a relative suitable viscosity (50–100), which was favorable for roll-to-roll application. Delightfully, the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT composite demonstrated a conductivity of 1670 S cm−1 with 0.7 wt% SCNT. Moreover, the in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT suspension at the optimal proportion of SCNTs of 0.4 wt% exhibited 3580 S cm−1, which is higher than that of the mixture of PEDOT:PSS:SCNT (3250 S cm−1),26 even nearly comparable to that of ITO.14

After determining the content of SCNTs, the in situ PEDOT:PSS with 0.4 wt% SCNTs defined as PEDOT:PSS:SCNT was used in the following experiments and representation. To further explore the origin behind the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS:CNT the conformation and composition were investigated. The Raman spectra of home-made PEDOT:PSS, commercial PEDOT:PSS and in situ PEDOT:PSS with 3.4 wt% and 0.4 wt% SCNTs, respectively, are presented in Fig. 2a. The peaks at 1569, 1539, 1367, 1097, 991, 854, 701, 578 and 440 cm−1 are assigned to the PEDOT and the strong band between 1400 and 1500 corresponds to the stretching vibration of Cα = Cβ on the five-member ring of PEDOT.28,29 From the Raman spectra of home-made PEDOT:PSS and in situ PEDOT:PSS with 3.4 wt% SCNT, it is hard to find a clear sign of the PEDOT peak, which means that EDOT was partly polymerized. Nevertheless, the main PEDOT peak of PEDOT:PSS:0.4 wt% SCNT is red shifted compared with commercial PEDOT:PSS, which indicated that the clew benzenoid structure of PEDOT chains tended to form a linear quinoid structure in PEDOT:PSS:0.4 wt% SCNT due to the reduction of the PSS content.30,31 Further, the phenomena could proclaim that the negatively charged SCNT template interacts strongly with EDOT. In addition, the intense interactions between the SCNT and the conjugated thiophene chain from PEDOT32 also could be illustrated. It also confirmed that the strong π–π stacking existed between positively charged PEDOT and the rigidity of its quinoid backbone induced phase separation, which would be discussed in the following morphology results. To further explore the interaction, the absorption of electrodes in the near IR range is observed (Fig. S2†). The increase of absorption means the favorable swelling of polymer chains after the addition of DMSO.33 Specifically, the high intensity of the absorption spectrum of the film with SCNTs can also prove the Raman result.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Clevios PH1000, home-made PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:SCNT films are shown in Fig. 2b. The signal XPS band between 166 and 172 eV is associated to the S 2p1 band of the sulfur atoms in PSS, whereas two other bands between 162 and 166 eV with doublet peaks (S 2p and S 2p3) are assigned to the signal from sulfur atoms of PEDOT.11,13 The intensity of S 2p and S 2p3 peaks for Clevios PH1000 is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS, and the ratio of PEDOT-to-PSS increased from 1:15.1 to 1:3.7. Interestingly, the ratio of PEDOT-to-PSS significantly grew to 1:2.4 after SCNTs acted as the second polymerized template. This change essentially proved that the PSS content was decreased in the process of polymerization. Moreover, the dual templates actuating a decrease of the insulating PSS content from the surface can be verified from the dramatically straightforward phase separation of tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 2c and d). As seen from the AFM image of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2c), PEDOT (blue regions) and PSS (red regions) are independent of each other with indistinct microphase separation structures, due to the crystal phase separation of PEDOT chains.34 However, for the in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT film, the blue PEDOT domains become distinct while the red PSS domains shrink (Fig. 2d). The aggregation of PEDOT on the surface results from the assembly of straight PEDOT chains stretched by these SCNTs through π–π interaction during the polymerization process. This enrichment of PEDOT domains can serve as a better charge pathway and make great contribution to the high conductivity.35
To correlate the Raman spectrum and AFM morphology analysis, the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are shown in Fig. 3a–d. For the home-made PEDOT:PSS, compared with the Clevios PH1000 no characteristic morphology could be observed, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. And there is obvious phase separation and the crystalline region after the addition of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The main reason for these results is that PEDOT chains change to lamella stacking (Fig. 3c). This is the reason for poor film-forming ability during spin-coating experiments. However, as for the in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT (Fig. 3d), a regular and homogeneous morphology was observed. Intriguingly, highly oriented SCNTs arrange uniformly in the PEODT:PSS background, which is the same as the result obtained in mixture. The oriented CNTs can provide a fast pathway for charge transportation and collection in the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT electrode. In addition, the conformation change and tremendous enrichment of PEDOT chains on the electrode surface also render a great contribution to the conductivity enhancement.36

Transmittance is another determinative and vital factor for the performance of a transparent electrode. Fig. 4a shows the transmittance (T) spectra of ITO, PEDOT:PSS:SCNT and Clevios PH1000 films in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1200 nm. The transmittances of Clevios PH1000 and ITO films are both over 80% in the visible spectrum. The ITO film is more transparent in the infrared spectral range. However, the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT film also exhibits good transmittance of 83% at 550 nm, revealing that SCNTs just have a weak effect on the transparency of the PEDOT:PSS film. The optoelectronic properties of the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT electrode were determined by measuring the sheet resistance and transmittance. The features (optics and electricity) of transparent electrodes are calculated by the equation:37,38  where σOp(λ) is the optical conductivity and σDC is the direct current (DC) conductivity of the film. Here, the ratio of σDC/σOp can be regarded as a figure of merit. The high values indicate that the transparent conductive electrodes possess desirable properties. To allow a valid comparison of the electrodes, we compare the figure with the other relative reference results, as shown in Fig. 4b. It is clearly found that the in situ PEDOT:PSS film via the vapor phase polymerization method has a σDC/σOp of 35.5.22 And the polymerization with the Fe(Tos)3 oxidizing agent shows a low σDC/σOp of 12.9.23 After physically introducing the carbon materials, the PEDOT:PSS:graphene composite demonstrates a relatively high σDC/σOp of 28.2,24 while the PEDOT:PSS:graphene:CNT composite with four components only has a value of 9.4.25 Expectedly, the in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT film shows the highest σDC/σOp of 51.8, even much higher than the mixture of PEDOT:PSS and the SCNT composite.26

To determine the function of the charge collection capability of the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT electrodes, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure consisting of a substrate glass/(PEDOT:PSS:SCNT or ITO)/ZnO/PBDTTT-EFT39:PC70BM/molybdenum sub-oxide (MoOx)/Ag, as shown in Fig. 5a. The corresponding energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 5b. The work function of the electrode was measured by the Kelvin probe method. It was surprising to discover that the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT showed a low work function of 4.4 eV (Fig. S3†), which is far from the normal values of PEDOT:PSS. It is because of the sharp drop in the content of the high work function anionic PSS in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT composite. The low work function PEDOT:PSS:SCNT is more suitable to act as a cathode than ITO (4.7 eV), which forming more interfacial dipoles and creating favourable ohmic contacts with the ZnO upper layer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were measured under one standard sun using a solar simulator with an Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm2. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 5c, the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT-OSCs yield a high PCE of 9.91% with a short current density (Jsc) of 16.94 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 and fill factor (FF) of 0.73 V on glass. Surprisingly, this performance is even superior to that of conventional ITO-based OSCs, for which 8.92% PCE with a Jsc of 16.83 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, and FF of 0.71 was obtained. In Fig. 5d, both Jsc calculated from integration of the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum from 300 nm to 800 nm is in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve. An improved photocurrent response can explain an increase of Jsc. Indeed, considering the nearly identical Jsc of all of the devices, the high PCE of the OSCs with the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT cathode are primarily attributed to the increased Voc and FF. This confirms that the lower work function of the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT cathode is the main reason for the device performance and more interfacial dipole existed compared with the ITO electrode.

To assess the universality and superiority of the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT electrode, we also fabricated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT or ITO cathode based on the device structure illustrated in Fig. 6a (glass/cathode/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag). The related energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 6b. As shown in Fig. 6c and Table 2, the PSCs with ITO as the cathode showed the best PCE of 12.06% (Jsc: 19.15 mA cm−2, Voc: 1.03 V, and FF: 0.61), which corresponds with the literature report.40,41 Remarkably, after introducing the PEDOT:PSS:SCNT cathode, the best PCE surged to 13.31%, accompanying with enhanced Voc to 1.07 V and FF to 0.64. The corresponding IPCE spectrum is presented in Fig. 6d.

In conclusion, an in situ and conductive PEDOT:PSS:SCNT dispersion was synthesized by using a dual template polymerization method. The in situ PEDOT:PSS:SCNT films show a conductivity of up to 3580 S cm−1, which is comparable to the conductivity of the ITO electrode, and a figure of merit up to 51.8 which is nearly double the value found for the PEDOT:PSS:carbon material composite via physical interaction is obtained. The films exhibit a low work function of 4.4 eV due to the reduction of the PSS content, suitable for acting as a cathode. The films were successfully integrated as a cathode in OSC (PCE of 9.91%) and PSC devices (PCE of 12.51%). Their performance and befitting viscosity show the potential of PEDOT:PSS:SCNT for roll-to-roll processes.
3. Experimental section
3.1 Material preparation
Sulfonated carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) were synthesized by a simple method.27 Pristine carbon nanotubes (P-CNTs, OD: 8–15 nm, length: 0.5–2 μm, purity: >95% XFNANO) were first sonicated in a mixture of concentrated HNO3 (65%) and HCl (37%) (the volume ratio of HNO3 and HCl is 1:1) for 1 h, and then the obtained CNTs were filtered and washed four times, then dried at 120 °C in a vacuum overnight. After that 60 mg concentrated H2SO4 (98%) and 80 mg CNTs were mixed in a dry flask and then sonicated for 2 h, followed by heating to 280 °C with an electrical hand blender (Teflon) under a nitrogen atmosphere for over 24 h. After this treatment, the suspension was diluted by water and filtered. The product was washed to remove excess acid and frozen in a refrigerator, and then dried in a freeze-drying chamber to obtain SCNTs. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in (Fig. S4†) implies that the SCNTs have been prepared with good dispersibility. The in situ PEDOT:PSS was polymerized by adding an amount of EDOT monomer into PSS or PSS:SCNT aqueous solution. After magnetic stirring for two hours, 0.1 g ammonium persulfate initiator were added into the composite. Over 24 h magnetic stirring, the composite was centrifuged two times at 1200 rpm. The pristine commercial PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus Ltd. Poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′](dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl)] (PBDTTT-EFT, purchased from solarmer Inc.), spiro-OMeTAD, PbI2 and CH3NH3I (purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Corp) were used as received.
3.2 Electrode fabrication and characterization
The hybrid PEDOT:PSS layers were spun-coated on a cleaned glass substrate at 1600 rpm, where after, thermally annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The transparent electrode (thickness: ∼70 nm) was obtained. The thickness of the transparent electrode was measured by using a surface profilometer (AMBIOS TECHNOLOGY ltd. XP-2). As for the values of conductivity, it is calculated by the equation: σ = 1/(D × R). And sheet resistances of all samples were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400) which can provide more accurate data. The sheet resistance (R) is calculated by the equation: R = πV/Iln2 = 4.53V/I. Transmittance spectra were analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the composite were measured on a VEECO atomic force microscope Dimension 3100. The scan range of all the AFM images was 3 × 3 μm. XPS studies were performed on a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromated AlKα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All recorded peaks were corrected for electrostatic effects by setting the C–C component of the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV. The base pressure in the XPS analysis chamber was 2 × 10−9 mbar. Raman spectroscopy was performed using an InVia Raman Microscope system (Renishaw, Inc.), with an Ar+ ion laser operating at 613 nm and 1.2 mW. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope and an internal charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
3.3 Device fabrication and characterization
The OSCs were fabricated on a glass substrate with an ITO or PEDOT:PSS:SCNT cathode with the structure of glass substrate/cathode/ZnO42/PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag. The pre-cleaned ITO-coated substrates were treated with ultraviolet–ozone before device fabrication. The ITO and PEDOT:PSS:SCNT electrodes were transferred to a glovebox to spin-cast the PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM solution. The PBDTTT-EFT:PC70BM was spun-cast onto the electrodes at 1200 rpm for 120 s. Eventually, MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (90 nm) layers were deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 6 × 10−4 Torr to accomplish the device fabrication. The effective area of one cell was 0.08 cm2. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated on cathode/ZnO layers. In the following, the CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin-coated and annealed at 80 °C for 10 min to form a ∼300 nm perovskite layer. CH3NH3PbI3 solution was prepared by simply mixing the pristine PbI2 solution and CH3NH3I solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Lithium doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was deposited from the solution of chlorobenzene by spin-coating. Finally, the samples were transferred into a vacuum chamber to deposit 7 nm MoO3 and 110 nm Ag to finish the devices.43 The effective area of one cell was 0.08 cm2. The J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000) AM 1.5G light source (100 mW cm−2). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency spectrum (IPCE) were detected under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a monocrystalline silicon diode. To reduce the hysteresis effect the scan range of all the perovskite devices are from 1 V to 0 V and 6.7 mV for each step. All the J–V curves are based on 150 points.
