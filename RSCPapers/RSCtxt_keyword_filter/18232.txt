    , Accepted 25th March 2021First published on 26th March 2021AbstractVacuum deposition has been investigated for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the laboratory, but its efficiency is still significantly lower than using solution deposition. Herein, we report an efficient vacuum deposition approach that is compatible with large-area, high-throughput processing. Excellent uniform and high quality perovskite films have been made on glass (400 cm2) and flexible (300 cm2) substrates. In addition, an in-vacuum low-temperature annealing process is developed to fabricate high-density formamidine-based perovskite films. It is found that the performance of PSCs is severely affected by the in-vacuum annealing temperature. When the annealing temperature is optimized at 60 °C, the efficiency of the resulting PSC is increased to 21.32%, the highest value for a PSC fabricated using vacuum deposition. Thanks to the solvent-free and air-free environment, the PSCs fabricated using the vacuum deposition exhibit excellent long-term stability.

Broader context
Compared to solution coating techniques, vacuum deposition has been demonstrated as the most dominant technology in the thin film semiconductor industry because of its advantages in large-area, high-throughput, contamination-free, and solvent-free deposition, continuous-production compatibility, robustness, etc. In this work, we develop scalable vacuum deposition to fabricate large-area perovskite films using low temperature annealing under vacuum. It is found that the perovskite films deposited on glass (400 cm2) and flexible (300 cm2) substrates exhibit superior uniformity and excellent quality. The perovskite film annealed at a preferable temperature of 60 °C under vacuum shows large grain size, long carrier lifetime and low trap density. As a result, we obtain the highest efficiency of perovskite solar cells using vacuum deposition technology. Meanwhile, the high performance of the perovskite module is fabricated, demonstrating that the vacuum processed is indeed capable of practical applications.

Introduction
The efficiency of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) has skyrocketed to as high as 25.5% within only a few years after its invention,1–4 surpassing all other thin film solar cells. Unfortunately, all of the highest-efficiency cells have been made using non-scalable spin-coating processes. There are, indeed, quite a few developed solution-based printing processes, such as screen-printing, blade-coating, slot-die printing, spray coating and inkjet printing, with some of them having been demonstrated to be capable of large-area deposition.5–12 However, their scale-up is hindered by the misfortune that device efficiency shows a fast decline as the cell area is increased. The other well-known challenge for the solution processes is environmental contamination caused by the relatively volatile organic solvents, not to mention that they are very costly.13–16
In comparison, vacuum processes are widely used in commercial semiconductor fabrication. Unfortunately, they are rarely studied for the deposition of PSCs. In 2013, Snaith et al. reported the first use of a vapor deposition method to deposit a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer for planar PSCs with a PCE of 15.4%.17 In 2015, our group developed alternating vacuum deposition for highly stable perovskite films toward efficient solar cells.18 In 2016, Bolink et al. demonstrated fully vacuum-deposited planar PSCs with p–i–n (16.5%) and n–i–p (20%) architectures by depositing methylamine (MA)-based perovskite cells.19 In 2017, our group used a vacuum co-evaporation deposition method to fabricate CsMAPbI3 PSCs, and the efficiency reached 20.13% due to the reduced trap-state density and relaxed lattice strain.20 In the same year, Johnston et al. showed a scalable co-evaporation approach to make a formamidine (FA)-based perovskite device with a 14.2% PCE.21 In 2018, Bolink's group used an all-vacuum process to deposit mixed-halide MAPb(Br0.2I0.8)3 perovskite films with a bandgap of 1.87 eV, and the device efficiency was 15.9%.22 In 2019, they also used a vacuum deposition method to deposit narrow-bandgap FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3 (1.28 eV bandgap) films, and the PSC efficiency was 13.98%.23 At the beginning of this year, Johnston's group found that the substrate temperature directly affects the adsorption rate of MAPbI3 and obtained 18.2%-PCE devices.24
While there are a few groups who have studied vacuum deposition to prepare MA-based PSCs, only very limited work was on higher-efficiency, more-stable FA-based perovskites.25–29 Vapor based technology indeed shows an advantage in fabricating uniform perovskite films across a large area.30,31 Herein, we develop high-throughput, scalable, vacuum deposition to fabricate superior FA-based perovskite films using low temperature annealing under vacuum. Using in-vacuum annealing at 60 °C in high vacuum, the PSC efficiency is increased to 21.32%, the highest efficiency reported using vacuum deposition. We also employ N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) as the hole transfer layers (HTLs), which can be fabricated by vacuum deposition, to avoid disadvantages of Spiro-OMeTAD such as high cost and difficult preparation over a large area. Because high-quality perovskite thin films can be fabricated at a low temperature, we prepared very-large-area perovskite films on both rigid (400 cm2) and flexible (300 cm2) substrates, demonstrating that the vacuum processes are indeed capable of large-area, high-throughput applications.
Results and discussion
The multisource vacuum deposition process is designed for the deposition of uniform-large area FA-based perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 1a. Three different sources are used: PbI2, CsI and FAI. The deposition rates are individually monitored in situ using quartz crystal microbalances so that they may be accurately controlled by regulating the evaporation temperature. First, a PbI2 layer is deposited on the substrate, and it appears as a polycrystalline film (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Next FAI is evaporated onto both the PbI2 surface and the gaps between the PbI2 grains, and it also appears as a polycrystalline film (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that PbI2 displays a layered structure with small grains (Fig. S2a, ESI†) and obvious grain boundaries. Fig. S2b (ESI†) shows a layer of FAI deposited on the FTO glass surface, showing uniform distribution. Finally, a CsI layer is fabricated on the pre-crystallized film surface because CsI can improve the stability of perovskites by relaxing the lattice strain.20 Here, we adopt layer-by-layer deposition technology to easily realize the exact control of the amount of these components. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that a small amount of perovskite is formed without any annealing, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), which may be caused by the direct contact of hot precursor vapor. All the precursor layers reacted after annealing in the vacuum chamber for 30 min. A performance comparison of a series of films indicates that 60 °C is the best annealing temperature. As a result, the very-large-area, uniform, FA-based perovskite films are produced on rigid glass (400 cm2) and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (300 cm2) substrates, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. In addition, Fig. S4 (ESI†) presents a representative large area perovskite film with very good uniformity. SEM cross-sectional imaging shows that its thickness is about 560 nm. By using the advantage of multisource vacuum technology with low-temperature annealing, we have solved the big problems of realizing large-area and flexible perovskite cells, which are restricting commercialization.

The formation and crystallization of FA-based perovskite films are investigated using XRD. It is found that controlling the annealing temperature is the key part in the perovskite formation. To obtain high-quality perovskite films, a series of perovskite films were fabricated with different annealing temperatures in the vacuum chamber. All typical perovskite diffraction peaks are clearly identified regardless of the different annealing temperatures (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the perovskite films were successfully formed. Additionally, it is clear that the PbI2 peak intensities are decreasing and the perovskite peak intensities are increasing as the annealing temperature is raised from 0 °C to 60 °C, and the PbI2 peaks grow again as the temperature exceeds 60 °C. Representative films annealed at 45 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C are selected for investigation. Their morphologies, crystallinities and absorption curves were measured using SEM, XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2. It is apparent that the PbI2 peaks are clearly strong when the annealing temperature is 45 °C (Fig. 2d, blue line), revealing that PbI2 and FAI do not react completely. There is a small amount of excess PbI2 accumulating along large grain boundaries, as shown in the red circles in Fig. 2a. In addition, there is indeed unreacted PbI2 underneath the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It would form recombination centres that affect charge carrier transmission. When the annealing temperature is 60 °C, the perovskite grain size increases to 750 nm from 450 nm, and the perovskite films exhibit uniform surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2b. The red line in Fig. 2d shows that the PbI2 peaks are very weak, indicating a very small amount of PbI2, which can passivate grain boundaries to reduce charge recombination.32,33 When the annealing temperature increases to 80 °C, the perovskite film starts to break down to PbI2 (black line in Fig. 2d). Large cracks between perovskite grains and pin-holes appear, as shown in Fig. 2c (green circles), which is due to the rapid sublimation of excessive FAI.34 The cracks and pin-holes tend to cause severe leakage current, which reduces the performance of PSCs. Fig. 2e shows the absorption spectra of perovskite films fabricated at different annealing temperatures. It shows that the absorption edge gradually approaches 830 nm, which is the ideal value for FA-based perovskites, with improving quality of the perovskite films, in accordance with XRD and SEM results.

To provide insight into the crystallization process of the perovskite films, we propose a mechanism to explain this process, as shown in Fig. 3. When the annealing temperature is not high enough to provide the energy required for the formation of the perovskite structure, the reaction to perovskite is not complete, resulting in many grain boundaries caused by the exposed small grains of PbI2, as in process 1 (Fig. 3a to b to e). Fig. 3e gives the cross-sectional SEM image for the annealing temperature of 45 °C. The morphologies of the upper and lower portions of the film are different. The upper part shows relatively large grain size, which is produced by the reaction at a low temperature of 45 °C. The lower part of the film consists of small grains, which are formed of unreacted PbI2. It can be anticipated that FAI reacts firstly with the upper portion of the PbI2 layer, and there is not enough energy for the FAI to continuously react, leading to different crystal morphologies in the same film. In process 2 (Fig. 3a to c to f), the annealing temperature of 60 °C is appropriate to prompt all precursor layers to translate into dense perovskite films with large grain size owing to crystal inflation during the perovskite growth. Fig. 3f shows that the perovskite film has large grains, which reach from the electron transport layer (ETL) to the HTL, which is very conducive to carrier transport. For process 3 (Fig. 3a to d to g), the pre-layers are fully reacted in this model, but the excess heat at the surface and bulk due to the high annealing temperature of 80 °C would break down the perovskite film leaving large cracks and pin-holes, which are mainly located at the film surface and inside the film (Fig. 3g).

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were used to evaluate the charge transfer dynamics of FA-based perovskite films fabricated by this multi-source vacuum deposition.35Fig. 4a shows the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films deposited on glass substrates under different annealing temperatures. It should be noted that a 510 nm excitation beam irradiated the top side of the perovskite films because of its short penetration depth of ∼80 nm.20,36 When the annealing temperature is 60 °C, the PL intensity is significantly increased, and the PL peak is slightly blue-shifted. This blue-shift is attributed to the reduced defects due to optimized annealing.37,38 The strong PL intensity suggests a decreased non-radiative recombination, which is beneficial to improving the PSC performance. Fig. 4b shows TRPL spectra of the perovskite films formed at annealing temperatures of 45 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C. The TRPL spectra are fitted by a biexponential eqn (1):39 (1)where τ1 and τ2 are the slow and fast decay times, respectively, A1 and A2 are their corresponding decay amplitudes, and B is a constant. Usually, the slow and fast decay times reflect the trap recombination in the bulk and the charge quenching at the interfaces.8,39 The fitting parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The values of τ1 are 44.1 ns with A1 of 22.4%, 145.7 ns with A1 of 78.9%, and 121.2 ns with A1 of 39.2% for the annealing temperatures of 45 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively. The perovskite film based on 60 °C annealing has the longest delay time, indicating suppressed trap recombination, consistent with the above conclusion. Meanwhile, the values of the fast decay time τ2 are calculated as 3.3 ns with A2 of 77.6%, 5.6 ns with A2 of 21.1%, and 2.01 ns with A2 of 60.7% for annealing temperatures of 45 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively, demonstrating that 60 °C annealing gives the best perovskite film with minimum surface defects.

(d) Dark J–V curves of the electron-only devices with VTFL kink point. The inset shows the structure of the electron-only device. 
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to understand the charge transfer resistance in the perovskite devices. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plot of the perovskite cells with different annealing temperatures, and the inset gives the equivalent circuit model for the EIS measurement. The Nyquist plots of the devices were measured at 1.1 V bias voltage under dark conditions. The fitted equivalent circuit model is composed with Rrec (recombination resistance) assigned to the low-frequency arc.40 It is clear that Rrec is significantly changed from 536 Ω to 3715 Ω with increasing temperature, indicating that the carrier recombination would be suppressed in the device with the annealing temperature of 60 °C by reducing the trap density.41
In order to investigate the charge transfer dynamics, the electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the trap-state density of the perovskite films annealed at different temperatures. Fig. 4d shows the dark current–voltage (I–V) curves of the electron-only devices. The linear correlation (the first fitting) reveals an ohmic-type response at low bias voltage; when the bias voltage is above the kink point, which is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), the current increases nonlinearly (the second fitting), indicating that the trap-states are completely filled. The trap-state density (Nt) can be obtained using eqn (2) (2)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the film. The trap-state densities of the perovskite film with different temperatures are 6.9 × 1015 cm−3, 2.5 × 1015 cm−3, and 5.2 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The low trap-state density can reduce the charge recombination, which would increase the chemical capacitance corresponding to Rrec, in good agreement with the above analysis. In addition, the carrier mobility of perovskite films annealed at 60 °C was measured by Hall, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It is clear that the carrier mobility is as high as 1.33 × 10−2 m2 V−1 s−1, demonstrating a very good film quality.42,43 The low trap-state density and very high carrier mobility render the perovskite film based on 60 °C annealing with high device performance.
To realize an all-vacuum deposition process, the inexpensive and available organic material NPB is employed as the HTLs in the FA-based PSCs. NPB is a commonly used material in organic photovoltaics and organic light-emitting diodes, and its price is less than 1/10 that of Spiro-OMeTAD. First, perovskite films were formed on compact TiO2/FTO substrates by layer-by-layer multisource vacuum deposition using the in-vacuum annealing process. Then, a 10 nm-thick NPB HTL and a 5 nm-thick MoO3 buffer layer on the NPB layer were deposited on the perovskite film. Finally, Au was deposited as a back electrode. The illustration of the all-vacuum PSC structure is shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a complete device based on the annealing temperature of 60 °C. It is apparent that the large grains can span the entire thickness of the perovskite film. Fig. 5c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of FA-based PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mA cm−2, and the key parameters including current-circuit density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the PCEs of the devices are significantly affected by the annealing temperature. The efficiency of the devices first increases, and then decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The PCE is as high as 18.89% when the annealing temperature is 60 °C.

The J–V curves of the champion PSC measured along both the reverse and forward directions are shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). The device displays a PCE of 18.89% with Jsc of 23.35 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.074 V and FF of 75.4% under reverse scanning, whereas it shows an efficiency of 17.92% with Jsc of 23.49 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.045 V and FF of 72.9 under forward scanning. The noticeable hysteresis may be attributed to migration of iodide ions.44 Fig. S7b (ESI†) shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) with the photocurrent integrated against the AM1.5 spectrum. Jsc calculated using the quantum efficiency is 23.06 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the J–V measurement.
Moreover, a large area (nominally 10 cm2) module was interconnected using five cells, each of which measured 35 mm × 5.5 mm, and was made using all-vacuum deposition processes. Fig. S8a (ESI†) shows a photo of the module and Fig. S8b (ESI†) the I–V measurement with key J–V parameters. It is clear that both Jsc (23.78 mA cm−2) and Voc per cell (1.092 V) are quite commendable. Consequently, the PCE is 14.60%, among the best for large area modules of 10 cm2. As expected, the FF is reduced to 56.22% by the scaleup because the resistance of FTO is too high for the large-area module. When the annealing temperature is 80 °C, the efficiency is decreased because the significant amount of FAI is sublimated.
Fig. S9 (ESI†) displays a statistical distribution of key J–V parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of 10 individual devices based on all-evaporated films at 45, 60 and 80 °C, respectively. It is apparent that the distribution is fairly tight with small standard deviations as summarized. In order to confirm the reliability of the J–V measurement, the stable photocurrent density and PCE for the champion device were measured as a function of time while biased at Vmp (voltage at maximum power point). The steady PCE and current density stabilize at 18.74% and 23.15 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5d, which is extremely close to the J–V result.
In order to study light stability of the device, the perovskite solar cells were tested under continuous AM 1.5G illumination for 300 minutes. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), all device parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE change little during the test duration, indicating that the device is fairly stable under light soaking.
Perovskite devices fabricated by all-vacuum deposition show a relatively low performance. We speculate that the low efficiency is mainly restricted by the poor hole mobility of the NPB HTL. To further elucidate the advantages of evaporated perovskite films, we used Spiro-OMeTAD instead of NPB as the HTL, and the cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b gives J–V curves of the champion perovskite cell scanned in the reserve and forward directions. It exhibits a Jsc of 24.88 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.11 V and FF of 77.2%, yielding a PCE of 21.32% scanned in reverse. This is the highest efficiency for a FA-based PSC fabricated by vacuum deposition. Fig. 6c shows the IPCE of the device based on Spiro-OMeTAD, and the integrated photocurrent is 24.29 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the J–V test. Fig. S11 (ESI†) displays a statistical distribution of key J–V parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of 34 individual devices based on evaporated perovskite films. It is apparent that the test results of the FA-based PSCs show quite narrow distribution, as expected as the vacuum deposition method is known for its reproducibility. To further investigate the uniformity of the large area deposition, we fabricated 90 small area (0.09 cm2 shows in Fig. S12b, ESI†) solar cells at 9 different locations, as shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†). Fig. S12c (ESI†) shows that all devices give a respectable PCE in the range of 19.50–20.50% and there is no significant variation between locations, demonstrating that the large area perovskite film is very uniform.

(c) IPCE and integrated photocurrent density with the AM 1.5G photon flux for the champion device. (d) The long-term environmental stability of unencapsulated PSCs exposed to the atmospheric environment of 35% humidity in the dark. 
In addition, we have compared the long-term environmental stability of perovskite devices fabricated by all-vacuum deposition with solution-processed Spiro-OMeTAD HTLs, as shown in Fig. 6d. When an unencapsulated perovskite device using vacuum-processed NBP/MoO3 as the HTL was stored in air at a humidity of 35% for 189 days, the efficiency increased by 1% from the original value. In contrast, the device with solution-processed Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL retained only 56% of its initial efficiency after 90 days. We believe that the good stability of the device with all-vacuum deposition arises for the following three reasons: (i) without any solvent involved in the whole fabrication process, corrosion of the perovskite film in the solvent is avoided; (ii) the high quality of the perovskite film fabricated by vacuum deposition, such as dense layer, large grain size and good crystallinity; and (iii) the inorganic MoO3 buffer layer, which efficiently blocks the moisture permeation to play a key role in protecting the perovskite film.
Conclusion
We developed an effective in-vacuum annealing vacuum deposition approach to fabricate large-area perovskite films (400 cm2 for rigid substrate, 300 cm2 for flexible substrate) and high efficiency PSCs. FA-based perovskite devices using solution- and vacuum-processed HTLs exhibit efficiencies of 21.32% (the highest efficiency for a perovskite device fabricated by vacuum deposition) and 18.89%, respectively. The high efficiency originates from the superior quality of the perovskite film formed by vacuum deposition, including large grain size, good crystallinity, and reduced carrier recombination. The efficiency of a PSC prepared by the all-vacuum process increases by 1% from its initial value after storage in ambient in the dark for 189 days. The excellent long-term stability is caused by the high quality of the perovskite film, solvent-free processing and the inorganic protection layer on the HTL surface. We firmly believe that this great breakthrough will promote the commercialization of perovskites in optoelectronics.

Solar cell fabrication
In order to avoid uncontrollable thickness variation that is common in multisource co-evaporation, we developed a three-source layer-by-layer vacuum deposition method. The equipment includes a multi-source evaporation system developed in our laboratory. More specifically, PbI2, FAI and CsI were deposited separately layer-by-layer, and then the sample was annealed at ∼10 Pa with N2 at different annealing temperatures to form a perovskite film, and the perovskite formula can be described as Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3. The perovskite stoichiometry was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), and the calculated process is provided in the ESI.† The details are described below. In total, 500 mg PbI2, 50 mg CsI and 500 mg FAI were placed in three quartz crucibles. The fabrication process started at 3.5 × 10−4 Pa, and the thickness of each layer was monitored by the crystal oscillator. PbI2 began to melt when the evaporation temperature exceeded 300 °C. Similarly, when the temperature was 100 °C, FAI began to deposit on the PbI2 surface. Then, CsI was deposited on the FAI surface at 350 °C. After that, N2 was introduced into the chamber, and the pressure was controlled at ∼10 Pa during annealing of the films at different temperatures for 30 min. Next, 10 nm-thick NPB and 5 nm-thick MoO3 were deposited on the perovskite film by thermal evaporation. Finally, 100 nm-thick Au was deposited using the same method.
Characterization

J–V curves of the PSCs were measured on a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under ambient conditions at room temperature. The light source was a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport simulator) with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter to match AM1.5G. The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated against an NREL-traceable KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The active area of 0.09 cm2 was defined by a metal mask. The J–V curves for the PSCs were tested both in the forward scanning (−0.1 V to 2 V, step 0.01 V) and reverse scanning (2 V to −0.1 V, step 0.01 V) directions at a selected scan rate of 30 ms. The IPCE was obtained on the QE-R (QE-R3011, Enlitech, UCMC & US) system and the light source was a 150 W tungsten–halogen lamp whose intensity was calibrated with a reference silicon reference photodiode. SEM images were acquired on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020) under an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV. XRD patterns were measured on a Rigaku Smart Lab (X-ray Source: Cu Kα; λ = 1.54 Å).

Broader context
Compared to solution coating techniques, vacuum deposition has been demonstrated as the most dominant technology in the thin film semiconductor industry because of its advantages in large-area, high-throughput, contamination-free, and solvent-free deposition, continuous-production compatibility, robustness, etc. In this work, we develop scalable vacuum deposition to fabricate large-area perovskite films using low temperature annealing under vacuum. It is found that the perovskite films deposited on glass (400 cm2) and flexible (300 cm2) substrates exhibit superior uniformity and excellent quality. The perovskite film annealed at a preferable temperature of 60 °C under vacuum shows large grain size, long carrier lifetime and low trap density. As a result, we obtain the highest efficiency of perovskite solar cells using vacuum deposition technology. Meanwhile, the high performance of the perovskite module is fabricated, demonstrating that the vacuum processed is indeed capable of practical applications.
