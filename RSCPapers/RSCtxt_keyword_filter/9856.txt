    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractThe addition of fluorine atoms on the terminal group of nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSMAs) is generally considered an effective method to improve device efficiency. However, it is still unknown how the thermal stability of the device changes after the introduction of fluorine atom. In this study, the influence of terminal fluorine substitution on the thermal stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) was investigated by choosing ITIC and ITIC-4F as acceptors. Although the efficiency of the ITIC-4F-based device was improved after the introduction of fluorine atoms, the compatibility between ITIC-4F and the polymer donor was worse compared with ITIC. The poor compatibility between ITIC-4F and the polymer donor gave rise to the precipitation of ITIC-4F from the polymer network during thermal annealing, leading to the aggregation and crystallization of ITIC-4F, which destroyed the optimal morphology of the active layer. Therefore, the efficiency of the ITIC-4F-based device decreased by 34.8% after 24 h of thermal annealing at 150 °C, while for the ITIC-based device, the efficiency decreased by only 5.4% after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 24 h. These results showed that although the efficiency of the device could be improved by adding fluorine atoms to the end groups of ITIC, the thermal stability of the device would also be poor when PBTIBDTT was used as the donor.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are regarded as one of the most promising solar cell techniques for practical application in solar energy utilization due to their low-cost and solution-flexibility processing properties.1–5 Compared to inorganic solar cells, the OSCs give relatively low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Therefore, numerous studies focus on how to improve the PCEs of OSCs. Excitedly, the PCEs based on single junction OSCs have been more than 18% in recent years.6–9 These achievements are mainly attributed to the development of nonfullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSMAs)10–15 and corresponding device engineering.16–18
From ITIC to Y6, many molecular design strategies of NFSMAs have been proposed to adjust the photoelectric properties of NFSMAs, and thus elevated the PCEs of OSCs.19,20 These strategies can be roughly divided into three parts: the design of the central conjugate skeleton,21–24 the modification of terminal groups,25–27 and the adjustment of the alkyl side chain.28–32 Among these strategies, the modification of terminal groups is one of the most employed design strategies because the terminal groups provide important π–π stacking between NFSMAs.33 Hence, terminal fluorine substitution is the most common strategy in the modification of terminal groups.34–37 Because fluorine atom with the largest electronegativity value can endow NFSMAs with a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, narrow band gap, and strong intermolecular interaction;38–40 thus, terminal group substitution with fluorine is always used to adjust the energy levels and enhance the intermolecular interaction of NFSMAs and thus improve the PCEs of OSCs. From acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) to A–DA′D–A type NFSMAs, most NFSMAs with high PCEs possess fluorinated terminal groups.41–44
Although the PCE of OSCs is the key consideration in the design of NFSMAs, the thermal stability of the device also needs to be studied. As is known, the temperature of OSCs is gradually increased under the illumination of solar light during the operation of OSCs. When the temperature rises, the material in the active layer tends to gather more easily, which may lead to the deterioration of the morphology of OSCs, thus greatly reducing the PCE of OSCs.45–48 This phenomenon is common in most solar cells. Because the molecular structures of materials have a great influence on the thermal stability of OSCs, many research groups have studied the relationship between the thermal stability of OSCs and the structure of NFSMAs. Chen and coworkers reported an NFSMA (named DF-PCIC) with an unfused-ring central core. Although DF-PCIC showed a near coplanar structure due to the F⋯H noncovalent interaction, the coplanar structure was transformed into a twisted structure under the effect of high temperature thermal annealing. The twisted structure inhibited the aggregation of DF-PCIC, thereby improving the thermal stability of the DF-PCIC-based device.49 Kim and coworkers found that the terminal chlorine substitution of NFSMA could greatly increase the cold crystallization temperature, hinder the movement of molecules, and ultimately enhance the thermal stability of devices.50 Furthermore, Li and coworkers reported an asymmetrical noncovalently fused-ring acceptor IDST-4F. The S⋯S noncovalent interaction between the π-bridge and the central core could be decimated by high temperature, leading to a noncoplanar structure, which prevented further aggregation of IDST-4F and then enhanced the thermal stability.51 However, the influence of terminal fluorine substitution of NFSMAs on thermal stability of OSCs has not been systematically studied. More than that, the strong inter/intramolecular interaction (noncovalent interactions of F⋯H, O⋯F, and so on) caused by fluorine atoms may cause the severe aggregation of NFSMAs, thereby weakening the thermal stability of OSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of end group fluorine substitution on the thermal stability of OSCs.
In this work, the classic NFSMAs, ITIC and ITIC-4F, and wide band gap polymer PBTIBDTT were used to investigated the thermal stability of OSCs. The polymer PBTIBDTT has energy levels and absorption spectrum matching with ITIC and ITIC-4F. Thus, the initial optimal PCE of the ITIC-based device was 9.00%. Also, for ITIC-4F-based device, a higher PCE of 10.31% was obtained due to the introduction of the fluorine atom. After annealing for 24 h, the PCEs of both the devices based on ITIC and ITIC-4F decreased. The PCE of the device based on ITIC-4F was reduced by 34.8% compared with its original PCE. However, compared with the ITIC-4F-based device, the ITIC-based device gave an only 5.4% reduced PCE, indicating that the thermal stability of the ITIC-4F-based device was worse than that of the ITIC-based device. The results of the morphology of the blend film, crystallization behavior, and compatibility between donor and acceptors are investigated in detail. These findings showed that the compatibility between the donor and acceptor reduced after fluorine substitution of end groups. The poor compatibility made it easier for ITIC-4F to crystallize from the blend film, thus forming large-scale phase separation, which greatly reduced the PCE of the device. Our work demonstrated that although the terminal fluorine substitution of ITIC could improve the PCE of the device based on PBTIBDTT, it might also reduce the thermal stability of the corresponding device.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of polymer and acceptors are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry curves of the polymer and acceptors are given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The related energy levels and optical band gap are summarized in the ESI† Table S1. As expected, fluorinated ITIC-4F showed a redshifted absorption spectrum compared with ITIC, which is attributed to the enhanced π–π intermolecular interactions. The redshifted absorption spectrum could give the device a higher Jsc. In addition, the energy levels of ITIC-4F are lower than that of ITIC due to the electron withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom, which could reduce the Voc of the ITIC-4F-based device, as discussed below.

The OSC devices with the conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were prepared to study the photovoltaic properties and thermal stability of devices. First, we investigated the effect of D/A ratio on the device performance. The detailed photovoltaic data is given in Table S2 (ESI†). The optimal weight ratios of both the systems were 1:1. The PBTIBDTT:ITIC device showed a best PCE of 9.00%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 13.99 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.98 V, and an fill factor (FF) of 65.65%. As for the PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F device, a similar PCE of 9.35%, with a Jsc of 16.52 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V, and an FF of 65.78% was obtained. The decrease of the Voc was due to the introduction of fluorine atoms with strong electron-withdrawing property, which reduces the LUMO energy level of the ITIC-4F, thereby reducing the Voc of the device. Furthermore, the addition of additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) could effectively increase the PCE of the PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F device from 9.35% to 10.31%, which is due to the improved morphology, as discussed below. However, the PBTIBDTT:ITIC device was sensitive to DIO, resulting in a reduced PCE. On the whole, the optimal PCE of the ITIC-4F-based device was higher than that of the ITIC-based device, which was the same as expected. In addition, the EQE curves of optimal devices are given in Fig. 2b. Evidently, the ITIC-4F-based device showed a large redshift of 50 nm and higher EQE values in whole spectral range compared with the ITIC-based device, which interpreted the higher Jsc of the ITIC-4F-based device.

The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) relationship curves of the optimal devices based on ITIC and ITIC-4F were measured to investigate the behavior of exciton dissociation.52Jph can be obtained from the formula Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff can be calculated from the formula Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Jph of both devices reached saturation with the increase in Veff. The saturation photocurrent Jsat (Veff more than 2 V) was 14.7 mA cm−2 and 17.7 mA cm−2 for the ITIC and ITIC-4F-based devices, respectively. The higher Jsat for the ITIC-4F-based device meant that the ITIC-4F-based active layer could capture more photons, which explained the higher EQE value of the ITIC-4F-based device. The exciton dissociation probabilities Pdiss under short-circuit conditions can be obtained from the formula Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. The Pdiss of the ITIC- and ITIC-4F-based devices was calculated to be 95.2% and 96.4%, respectively. More effective exciton dissociation endowed the ITIC-4F-based device with higher FF and PCE.

Moreover, the relation curves between light intensity (P) and photocurrent Jsc were plotted to reveal the bimolecular recombination properties of the devices. As shown in Fig. 3b, the equation Jsc ∝ Pα can be used to establish the relationship between P and Jsc.53 The value of α is a parameter to describe the degree of bimolecular recombination. In detail, the closer the value of α is to 1, the more inapparent the bimolecular recombination. After linear fitting, the α of the ITIC-4F-based device was 93.6%, which was higher than that of the ITIC-based device (91.7%), showing that weak bimolecular recombination occurred in the ITIC-4F-based blend film, thus explaining its higher FF, Jsc, and PCE.
To study the effect of the fluorine substituted terminal group on the thermal stability of OSCs, the optimal device preparation conditions (as-cast for the PBTIBDTT:ITIC device and 0.5% DIO for the PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F device) were selected to prepare the thermally annealed devices. To quickly evaluate the thermal stability of the devices, an annealing temperature of 150 °C was applied. The devices were placed on a hot table in the glove box and then thermally annealed for a certain time. The detailed photovoltaic parameters after annealing for 5 h and 24 h are given in Table 1. The normalized photovoltaic parameters as a function of annealing time for OSCs are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PCEs of both the devices decreased with the increase in the annealing time. After annealing for 24 h, the PBTIBDTT:ITIC device exhibited a PCE of 8.51%, which was only 5.4% lower than the initial PCE. However, a low PCE of 6.72% was obtained for the PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F device after annealing for 24 h, which was 34.8% lower than the initial PCE. These results indicated that the thermal stability of the ITIC-4F-based device was worse than that of the ITIC-based device. According to the normalized photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 4a–c), the sharp drop in the FF and Jsc was the direct cause of the large reduction of PCE shown by the PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F device.

To understand the real reason of Jsc and FF decline of the ITIC-4F-based device after thermal annealing, the carrier mobilities of the blend film before and after annealing were measured by the space charge limited current method (SCLC). The SCLC curves are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the corresponding values of mobilities are summarized in Fig. 5. In the initial blend films, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the devices based on ITIC and ITIC-4F were 4.93 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1/2.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In comparison to the ITIC-based device, the ITIC-4F-based device exhibited higher μh and μe, explaining the higher FF, Jsc, and PCE obtained by the initial ITIC-4F-based device. With the extension of annealing time, both μh and μe of the ITIC-4F-based device declined quickly, and the μh and μe decreased one order of magnitude after 24 h of annealing (μh = 1.84 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 5.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), suggesting that the charge transport network of the active layer was destroyed by heat. The results of carrier mobilities explained that the Jsc and FF of the ITIC-4F-based device dropped sharply after 24 h annealing. In contrast, the μh and μe of the ITIC-based device decreased only slightly after 24 h of annealing, which implied that the charge transport network in the ITIC-based active layer was not seriously damaged. Therefore, the Jsc and FF of the ITIC-based device did not decrease rapidly with the increase in the annealing time.

The charge transport networks of OSCs are closely related to the active layer morphology. For this reason, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the morphology of the ITIC-based and ITIC-4F-based active layers before and after thermal annealing. As shown in Fig. 6, appropriate phase separation and continuous interpenetrating network were observed in both ITIC-based and ITIC-4F-based optimal active layers before thermal annealing. However, after thermal annealing, the morphologies of the two active layers showed different degrees of deterioration. In the ITIC-based active layer, no obvious change in the morphology was observed after annealing for 5 h, and only a small amount of aggregation of particles was observed after thermal annealing for 24 h, implying that the interpenetrating network of the ITIC-based active layer remained intact. However, aggregation particles appeared in the ITIC-4F based active layer after annealing for 5 h. With increasing thermal annealing time, several aggregation particles larger than 200 nm in size were observed, resulting in the damaged charge transfer network and reduced carrier mobility, which was consistent with the SCLC results. These results indicated that the active layer based on ITIC-4F easily forms large-scale phase separation under the effect of thermal annealing, which means that the morphological stability of the ITIC-4F-based device is worse than that of the ITIC-based device during thermal annealing.

The different crystallization ability of ITIC-4F and ITIC-4F under thermal annealing conditions may be an important reason for their different morphological stability. Therefore, 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) was utilized to characterize the crystallization behavior of the blend films. The 2D GIWAXS images are shown in Fig. 7 and the line-cut profiles of the blend films are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In the initial ITIC-based blend film, only an apparent (010) π–π peak (qz = 18.9 nm−1) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction was observed due to the overlapping of the π–π stacking peaks of ITIC and PBTIBDTT. With the extension of thermal annealing time, the (010) π–π signal peak gradually increased, attributed to the crystallization of PBTIBDTT and ITIC. Compared with ITIC, the ITIC-4F-based blend film gave stronger π–π diffraction peaks before thermal annealing, which is due to the strong intermolecular interaction caused by fluorine atoms. After 5 h of thermal annealing, a further enhancement of the π–π diffraction signal peak was observed, which was much stronger than that of the ITIC-based blend film. When the thermal annealing time was extended to 24 h, all diffraction peaks were greatly enhanced. Moreover, the original π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction split into two peaks. Among them, the peak located at qz = 19.9 nm belonged to ITIC-4F. The above results suggested that ITIC-4F was easier to crystallize under heat. Combined with the TEM results, it can be concluded that, under the thermal annealing condition, ITIC-4F precipitated from the uniform blend film and formed large scale phase separation, reducing the FF and Jsc of the ITIC-4F-based device, thus greatly reducing the device PCE.

The compatibility between the donor and acceptor could also impact the aggregation and crystallization of materials, and thus the morphology of the active layer. Therefore, contact angle experiments were conducted to assess the influence of terminal group fluorination on the compatibility between the donor and acceptor. As shown in Fig. 8, water and glycerol were used to measure the values of contact angle, and the corresponding data are given in Table 2. According to Wu's theory,54 the surface tension (γ) of pure films could be calculated to be 17.10 mN m−1 (ITIC), 24.43 mN m−1 (ITIC-4F), and 14.77 mN m−1 (PBTIBDTT). The higher surface tension of ITIC-4F indicated that terminal fluorination could promote the surface tension of the ITIC derivative. On the basis of the Flory–Huggins model, interaction parameters (χ) could be used to evaluate the miscibility of blend systems. The χ could be obtained by the formula .55 In this work, χPBTIBDTT,ITIC and χPBTIBDTT,ITIC-4F were obtained as  and , respectively. The higher χ for ITIC-4F suggested that the miscibility between ITIC-4F and PBTIBDTT was worse than the miscibility between ITIC and PBTIBDTT. The poor compatibility made it easier for ITIC-4F to precipitate and crystallize from the blend film under thermal annealing conditions, thus forming large-scale phase separation, reducing the FF and PCE of the device based on ITIC-4F.

Conclusion
In this work, we prepared the devices based on PBTIBDTT:ITIC and PBTIBDTT:ITIC-4F, and systematically studied the effect of terminal group fluorination on the thermal stability of OSCs. As expected, ITIC-4F showed deeper energy levels and redshift absorption spectrum compared with ITIC. After systematic optimization, a best PCE of 10.31% was obtained for the ITIC-4F-based device, which was higher than that of the ITIC-based device (9.00%) owing to the broadened absorption spectrum and higher electron mobility due to the introduction of fluorine atom. However, after thermal annealing for 24 h at 150 °C, the ITIC-4F-based device only retained 65.2% of its initial PCE, which was lower than that of the ITIC-based device (94.6%), implying that terminal group fluorination of ITIC could degrade the thermal stability of the device. A systematic study found that the fluorine substitution of terminal groups reduces the compatibility of ITIC-4F and PBTIBDTT. Fluorine-substituted ITIC-4F was easier to separate from the polymer network due to the reduced compatibility. Under this circumstance, when the ITIC-4F-based device was annealed, a large number of ITIC-4F molecules were separated from the polymer network and crystallized, thus forming large-scale phase separation. Consequently, the optimal active layer morphology of the ITIC-4F-based device was more easily damaged by heat compared with the ITIC-based device, leading to poor thermal stability of the ITIC-4F-based device.
