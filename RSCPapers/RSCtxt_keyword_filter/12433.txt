    , Accepted 13th August 2019First published on 21st August 2019AbstractEnergy level alignments at the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface in conventional polymer solar cells (c-PSCs) and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface in inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs) are systematically investigated via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and by using the integer charge transfer (ICT) model. The findings demonstrate that PFN as a cathode interlayer is able to effectively reduce the electron extraction barriers from 0.72 eV to 0.38 eV for the c-PSCs and from 0.58 eV to 0.36 eV for the i-PSCs, respectively. In the c-PSCs, the final modified electron extraction barrier matches the predicted value (∼0.4 eV) using the ICT model. In the i-PSCs, there exists an intermixing layer of PFN and the active layer above PFN because some PFN is dissolved by the organic solvent in the active layer solution, resulting in a special energy level alignment at the PFN/PC71BM interface. ITO/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm) in the i-PSCs actually forms such an interface as ITO/PFN/PFN:PC71BM with an energy level alignment like Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN (0.65 nm), which rationalizes a higher short circuit and fill factor in the i-PSCs than c-PSCs. Finally, a general model to simulate the intermixing layer between the organic cathode interlayer and the active layer has been proposed to describe the energy level alignment of the complicated interfaces in the i-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn tremendous attention due to their unique advantages of low cost, light weight and potential opportunity of fabricating flexible devices by solution processing. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15% has been achieved in the single-junction PSCs with good ambient stability.1–5 Inserting an interlayer between the active layer and electrode has been considered to be one of the most effective approaches for enhancing device performance.6–10 In particular, a great deal of effort has been invested in solution-processed organic cathode interlayers (CILs) based on π-conjugated polymeric/small-molecular electrolytes. Compared to inorganic CIL materials, the advantages of alcohol/water soluble organic small molecular or polymeric materials are apparent due to their simple, vacuum-free and environment-friendly procedure to form a film during the device fabrication.11–14 Because the alcohol/water solubility of the organic materials can avoid intermixing between the active layer and the interlayer, the molecules are promising CIL materials for all solution processed PSCs. Among various alcohol-soluble CIL materials, poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN) is a typical and successful example, which has been widely used and led to significant improvements of device performances in both conventional and inverted PSCs.11,12 The PSCs with the PFN film as a CIL have shown simultaneous enhancement in open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF). As a result, PCEs of the PSCs based on PTB7 (polymer thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene):PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) can reach 8.37% in normal architecture11 and even up to 9.26% in inverted architecture.12 The effects of PFN as a CIL on the enhanced device performance were elucidated as follows: (i) increasing built-in potentials within devices by the formation of interfacial dipoles, (ii) improving charge transport properties, (iii) preventing the build-up of space charge during device operation, and (iv) reducing charge recombination.15 Some investigations have been carried out to provide insights into the working mechanism of PFN as a CIL in the PSCs. It was found that the PFN effectively changed the work function of indium tin oxide (ITO) from 4.7 eV to 4.1 eV by forming permanent dipoles in the inverted PSCs (i-PSCs). He et al. speculated that incorporating PFN created a desirable Ohmic contact between PC71BM and the ITO electrode, thereby facilitating efficient electron transport/collection.12 Moreover Zhong et al. proposed that there was a significant electron transfer from the PFN modified ITO electrode to the acceptor material C60 through electron tunnelling. The resulting doping effect could move the Fermi level close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 and hence facilitated the formation of ohmic contact at the acceptor/cathode interface. The accumulated positive charges in ITO and negative charges in C60 due to the large degree of charge transfer also created an additional electric field to extract the electrons. The better electron extraction was confirmed by the electrical measurements of the electron-only devices with PFN as the interlayer, which was believed to contribute to the performance enhancement of organic solar cells based on PFN.16 Drift-diffusion simulations performed by Xia et al. were consistent with the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements of decreasing work function of ITO and pointed to a reduction in the recombination of holes at the cathode as the main cause for improving VOC when PFN was used as a CIL on ITO in the i-PSCs.17 Using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, van Reenen and co-workers observed the work function reduction of conducting substrates (ITO, Ag, Al etc.) covered by PFN due to the image-charge-induced double dipole step at the vacuum level at the substrate/PFN interface.18 Bao et al. used the so-called integer charge transfer (ICT) model to describe the energetics at the interfaces between PFN and the substrates and proposed equilibration of the Fermi level due to oxidation/reduction of π-delocalized backbone at the interface in combination with an additional interface dipole step induced by side chain electrostatic realignment.19,20 Unfortunately, all the above-mentioned interfacial investigations did not entirely consider the actual situations at the cathode interfaces modified by PFN in the two device architectures, where there exists a complicated active layer/5 nm PFN/metal (thermally deposited) interface for conventional PSCs (c-PSCs) and an ITO/10 nm PFN/active layer (spin-coated) interface for i-PSCs (Fig. 1a). For c-PSCs, metal cathodes such as Al and Ag were thermally evaporated on the PFN surface to form the PFN/metal interface while the reported interfacial investigations only described the metal/PFN interface obtained by spin-coating PFN on metals. Obviously the two kinds of interfaces are different. It is necessary to clarify whether the PFN/metal interface and the metal/PFN interface have similar energy level alignment. Hu et al. have reported that the work function of “peeled-off” ∼PFN/Al is smaller than that of Al/PFN in which PFN is directly spin-coated on the pre-deposited Al substrate using Kelvin probe measurements.21 However, their results obtained from the Kelvin probe and the ICT model demonstrated that it was hard to understand the better performance of the c-PSCs with PFN and the modification of PFN did not introduce any significant change to the devices from the perspective of energy level alignment.21 For i-PSCs, chlorobenzene, the solvent of the active layer, can dissolve PFN. It is possible that PFN entered into the active layer after the active layer was spin-coated on PFN so that there could be a PFN:PC71BM:polymer blend layer. Nian et al. have demonstrated that the PCE of the c-PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM doped by 550 ppm PFN decreased to half of the PCE of control devices without PFN.22 This means that PFN going into active layers such as P3HT:PC61BM is unfavourable for the device performance in the c-PSCs. Therefore, a simple work function decrease of ITO cannot fully explain such a complicated interface (ITO/PFN/PFN:active layer/active layer) at all. In addition, it should be noted that one of the main purposes of introducing a CIL is to reduce the electron extract barrier from the active layer to the cathode. It is necessary to measure and then compare the electron extraction barriers at cathode interfaces in the devices with and without PFN. However, the electron extraction barriers from the fullerenes to cathodes in the c-PSCs and i-PSCs have hardly been reported; so, the hypothesis of Ohmic contact (the electron extraction barrier is close to zero) due to the incorporation of PFN between PC71BM and the cathode has not yet been quantitatively confirmed by experiments. Therefore, the detailed working mechanisms of PFN as the CIL in c-PSCs and i-PSCs are still unclear and there even exists controversy at present.

In this contribution, the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface for c-PSCs and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface for i-PSCs have been investigated mainly using UPS and the ICT model in order to reveal the working mechanisms of PFN in the c-PSCs and i-PSCs. We used the “peel-off” method to obtain the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface and then studied the interface using UPS measurements. The UPS results demonstrated that the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface had similar energy level alignment with Ag/PFN/PC71BM. As a result, the electron extraction barrier between PC71BM and Ag was reduced from 0.72 eV to 0.38 eV due to the insertion of PFN as the CIL in the c-PSCs, which approached the predicted value (∼0.4 eV) using the ICT model. However, there exists an intermixing layer of PFN and the active layer above PFN because some PFN is dissolved by the chlorobenzene in the i-PSCs, as found in UPS and contact angle measurements. This results in a special energy level alignment at the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface and the electron extract barrier from PC71BM to ITO was reduced from 0.58 eV to 0.36 eV in the i-PSCs. Finally, a general model for an alcohol soluble organic CIL has been proposed to describe the energy level alignment of the complicated interfaces.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and film fabrication
PFN and PC71BM (Fig. 1b) were purchased from 1-Material (Canada) and American Dye Sources Inc., respectively. Chlorobenzene and methanol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. PFN and PC71BM films were spin-coated on various substrates from methanol and chlorobenzene in a nitrogen-filled glove box, respectively. In order to study the energy level alignment at the cathode interface in the actual c-PSCs, PC71BM/Ag or PFN/Ag was prepared by using the “peel-off” method shown in Fig. 1c as follows.23 First, the PC71BM or PFN film was spin-coated onto an ultra-flat and weakly adhering silicon wafer ultrasonically pre-cleaned using detergent, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Secondly, 100 nm Ag was deposited on the PC71BM or PFN film in a vacuum of 10−6 mbar. Thirdly, the as-prepared PC71BM/Ag two-layer or the PFN/Ag two-layer was “peeled-off” from the Si wafer using one side of two-faced copper conduction tape. Finally, the other side of the copper tape was pasted on the ITO surface. As a result, the PC71BM or PFN film was exposed to the top surface of the “peel-off” sample. Some conductive substrates were chosen to provide a broad range of work function values: Al/AlOx dipped with NH3·H2O solution (ϕ = 3.2–3.3 eV), Al/AlOx (ϕ = 3.6–3.9 eV), Si/SiOx (ϕ = 4.0–4.2 eV), Ag/AgOx (ϕ = 4.5–4.8 eV), ITO treated by UV ozone (ϕ = 4.5–4.8 eV), PEDOT:PSS (ϕ = 5.0–5.2 eV), and Au/AuOx treated by UV ozone (ϕ = 5.0–5.7 eV). Different thicknesses of the organic films were achieved by changing spin-coating speeds and solution concentrations. The thicknesses of films were measured via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).
2.2. Measurements and characterization
UPS and XPS experiments were carried out using an XPS/UPS system equipped with a VG Scienta R3000 analyzer in an ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of 1 × 10−10 mbar. A monochromatized He Iα irradiation from a discharged lamp supplies photons with 21.22 eV for UPS measurements. The work function (ϕ) was determined using the energetic position of the secondary electron cutoff (Ecutoff) of the UPS spectrum according to ϕ = 21.22 eV − Ecutoff. The vertical ionization potential was obtained from the frontier edge of the occupied density of states. A monochromatic Al (Kα) X-ray source provides photons with 1486.6 eV for XPS measurements. All measurements were calibrated by referencing to the Fermi level and the Au 4f7/2 peak position of gold foil cleaned by Argon ion sputtering. Static contact angles of the as-prepared surfaces were measured using a commercial contact angle system (Data Physics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature.
3. Results and discussion
The energetics of π-conjugated organic semiconductors at weakly metal/organic and organic/organic interfaces usually follows the trend predicted by the ICT model, which describes the relation between the Fermi level and the so-called pinning level (ICT+ or ICT−) of the organic semiconductor.24–27 In the ICT model, the energy of an ICT+ state, EICT+, is defined as the energy required to take away one electron from the organic semiconductor producing a fully relaxed state. The energy of an ICT− state, EICT−, is defined as the energy gained when one electron is added to the organic semiconductor producing a fully relaxed state. Energy level alignment in the ICT model can be described by three distinct regimes: (i) ϕSub < EICT−, namely Fermi level pinning to the ICT− state of the organic semiconductor; (ii) EICT− < ϕSub < EICT+, vacuum level alignment, namely ϕOrg/Sub is dependent on ϕSub (slope = 1); (iii) ϕSub > EICT+, namely Fermi level pinning to the ICT+ state of the organic semiconductor. In addition to the description of ϕ change by the ICT model, the “double dipole step” caused by ions of conjugated electrolytes should be considered. When the ions are located close to the interface, Ion+ and Ion− can interact with their respective induced image charge on the substrate. If Ion+ species are more mobile, these ions will move closer to the substrate, leading to up-shifting of the ϕ. If the Ion− species are more mobile, this results in down-shifting of the ϕ.18

Fig. 2a shows the dependences of ϕOrg/Sub on ϕSub for PFN and PC71BM spin-coated films. For PC71BM, three distinct regions are clearly observed, following the general ICT model behaviour. Region (i) S = 0, when ϕSub < ∼4.4 eV, the Fermi level is pinned to ∼4.4 eV. Region (ii) S = 1, when 4.4 eV < ϕSub< ∼5.4 eV, ϕOrg/Sub is equal to ϕSub. Region (iii) S = 0, when ϕSub > ∼5.4 eV, the Fermi level is pinned to ∼5.4 eV. For PFN, only two distinct regions are observed since the EICT− of PFN is too small to get enough experimental data. Region (ii) S = 1, when ϕSub < ∼5.2 eV, ϕOrg/Sub = (ϕSub − 0.5) eV. Region (iii) S = 0, when ϕSub > ∼5.2 eV, the Fermi level is pinned to ∼4.7 eV. For PFN, a shift of ∼−0.5 eV away from the ideal ICT curve is attributed to the “double dipole step”.18Fig. 2b presents ionization potential (IP) obtained from UPS measurements, electronic affinity (EA) obtained from IP and optical band gap (Eg), and EICT+ and EICT− derived from Fig. 2a for PFN and PC71BM films. IP, EA, EICT+ and EICT− of PC61BM are 6.1 eV, 3.9 eV, 5.4 eV and 4.4 eV, respectively. IP, EA and EICT+ of PFN are 5.9 eV, 3.0 eV and 4.7 eV, respectively. The influence of PFN thickness on the ϕ values of Ag and ITO substrates has been investigated using UPS (Fig. S1, ESI†). Evolution of the Fermi level versus the vacuum level (ϕ) and the HOMO level versus the Fermi level (EHOMO) with the variation in the thickness of PFN on Ag and ITO is also presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Obviously, there exists a band bending behaviour at the Ag/PFN interface and the ITO/PFN interface. It is found that the ϕ values of Ag and ITO decreased with the increase of PFN thickness and reached a steady value when PFN thickness exceeded 2 nm. Ultimately, the ϕ of Ag changed from 4.68 eV to 4.16 eV while the ϕ of ITO changed from 4.53 eV to 4.04 eV. Simultaneously, EHOMO of PFN increased with the increase of PFN thickness and reached a steady value when PFN thickness exceeded 2 nm. Accordingly, the thicknesses of all the PFN films in the following UPS and water contact angle characterizations are ≥2 nm, where the coverage of PFN films on the Ag or ITO substrate is uniform.

It is well known that there is a difference for cathode fabrication between c-PSCs and i-PSCs. In the c-PSCs, the PFN layer is deposited on the active layer by spin-coating, then the metal electrode is deposited on the PFN layer by thermal evaporation. In the i-PSCs, the PFN layer is deposited on the ITO electrode, and then the active layer is deposited on the PFN layer by spin-coating. It is possible that the PFN film is damaged or doped by hot metal atoms in the c-PSC or dissolved by organic solvent of the active layer in the i-PSCs. This complicates electronic structures at the active layer/PFN/metal interface in the c-PSCs and the ITO/PFN/active layer interlayer in the i-PSCs. Therefore, working mechanisms of PFN in the two device configurations may be different. In order to discover the real electronic structures at active layer/PFN/metal in the c-PSCs, the “peel-off” method is adopted to simulate the actual cathode interface, as shown in Fig. 1c. This allows us to investigate the actual energy level alignment at the cathode interface of the c-PSCs. The energy level alignment at two kinds of Ag/PFN interfaces and Ag/PC71BM interfaces prepared using spin-coating and “peel-off” methods have been investigated using UPS, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As a result, both of the two Ag/PFN samples and the two Ag/PC71BM samples showed the same UPS spectra. Table S1 (ESI†) presents detailed parameters derived from Fig. S2 (ESI†). IP values of PFN spin-coated on Ag and PFN thermally deposited on Ag are 5.91 eV and 5.92 eV, respectively. IP values of PC71BM spin-coated on Ag and PC71BM thermally deposited on Ag are 6.12 eV and 6.10 eV, respectively. This indicates that energy level alignment established from spin-coating samples can be applied to “peel-off” samples.
Energy level alignment at the cathode interface in the c-PSCs was first investigated. Fig. 3a shows the UPS spectra of Ag, Ag/PFN (2 nm), Ag/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm) and Ag/PC71BM (20 nm), which were obtained by using the “peel-off” method. UPS-derived diagrams for energy level alignment of the Ag/PC71BM interface and the Ag/PFN/PC71BM interface are presented in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. ϕ of the Ag modified by 2 nm PFN decreased from 4.68 eV to 4.16 eV. For the 20 nm PC71BM film on Ag/PFN, the ϕ increased from 4.16 eV to 4.31 eV and the valence band spectrum presents several typical features (A–D) of PC71BM (Fig. 3a). For comparison, we also carried out the UPS measurements of 20 nm PC71BM film on Ag and obtained the ϕ of 4.62 eV. This means that there exists a negligible interface dipole (Δ = 0.06 eV) for the Ag/PC71BM contact (Fig. 3b). Compared to Ag/PC71BM, all the electronic features (A–D) of Ag/PFN/PC71BM are uniformly shifted by 0.34 eV toward higher binding energy, as shown in Fig. 3a. The shift is an indication that adding PFN between PC71BM and Ag gives rise to a Fermi level shift away from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and toward the LUMO of PC71BM. As a result, the electron extraction barrier from PC71BM to Ag is reduced from 0.72 eV (Fig. 3b) to 0.38 eV (Fig. 3c). Therefore, incorporating the PFN layer could improve electron extraction efficiency from PC71BM to Ag by reducing the electron extraction barrier. In order to investigate the cathode interfaces in the i-PSCs, the UPS measurements of ITO, ITO/PFN (2 nm), ITO/PC71BM (20 nm) and ITO/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (2 nm, 8 nm and 20 nm) have been carried out and their UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3d. Fig. 3e and f present the UPS-derived diagrams for energy level alignment at the ITO/PC71BM interface and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface. When 2 nm PFN was spin-coated on the ITO substrate, ϕ of ITO decreased from 4.53 to 4.04 eV due to Δ = 0.49 eV. When the 20 nm PC71BM film was further spin-coated on ITO/PFN, the ϕ increased from 4.04 eV to 4.08 eV (Fig. 3f). However, the ϕ of 20 nm PC71BM on ITO is 4.48 eV due to Δ = 0.05 eV between ITO and PC71BM (Fig. 3e). Compared to ITO/PC71BM, all the electronic features (A–D) of ITO/PFN/PC71BM are uniformly shifted by 0.22 eV toward higher binding energy, as shown in Fig. 3d. As a result, the electron extraction barrier from PC71BM to ITO is reduced from 0.58 eV (Fig. 3e) to 0.36 eV (Fig. 3f). ϕ, HOMO level versus Fermi level (EHOMO) and HOMO level versus vacuum level (IP) of Ag and ITO covered with different organic films have been summarized in Table 1. Because ϕAg = 4.68 eV, which is in Region (ii) of PFN and PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2a, the ϕ values of Ag/PFN and Ag/PC71BM predicted by the ICT model should be 4.18 eV (ϕSub – 0.5 eV) and 4.68 eV, respectively, which are very close to the ϕ values of Ag/PFN (ϕ = 4.16 eV) and Ag/PC71BM (ϕ = 4.62 eV) in Table 1. For Ag/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM, the substrate is Ag/PFN, ϕAg/PFN = 4.16 eV, which is in Region (i) of PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2a. The ϕ of Ag/PFN/PC71BM predicted by the ICT model should be 4.4 eV, which is very close to the ϕ value of Ag/PFN/PC71BM (ϕ = 4.31 eV) in Table 1. The findings indicate that the ICT model perfectly matches the experiment results for energy level alignment at the cathode interface in the c-PSCs. For the cathode interface in the i-PSCs, because ϕITO = 4.53 eV, which is in Region (ii) of PFN and PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2a, the ϕ values of ITO/PFN and ITO/PC71BM predicted by the ICT model should be 4.03 eV (ϕSub – 0.5 eV) and 4.53 eV, respectively, which are very close to the ϕ values of ITO/PFN (ϕ = 4.04 eV) and ITO/PC71BM (ϕ = 4.48 eV) in Table 1. Therefore, the ICT model fits the experiment results for energy level alignments at ITO/PFN interfaces and ITO/PC71BM interfaces. However, the ICT model does not apply to the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface in the i-PSCs. Because ϕITO/PFN = 4.04 eV, which is in Region (i) of PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2a, the ϕ of ITO/PFN/PC71BM predicted by the ICT model should be 4.4 eV while the measured ϕ of Ag/PFN/PC71BM is 4.08 eV, as shown in Fig. 3f. Therefore, the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface does not follow the ICT model. In addition, unexpectedly, we found that IPs of PC71BM for Ag/PC71BM, ITO/PC71BM and Ag/PFN/PC71BM (“peel-off”) are ∼6.10 eV while the IPs of PC71BM for ITO/PFN/PC71BM (various thickness) are 5.87–5.92 eV, which are similar to the IP of PFN.

Herein, we try to provide a reasonable explanation for why energy level alignment at the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface in the i-PSCs does not obey the ICT model. Because PFN is soluble in chlorobenzene (CB), which is the solvent of PC71BM, it is possible that some of the PFN is dissolved in CB when the PC71BM solution is spin-coated on the ITO/PFN substrate. After the CB volatilizes, a mixed layer of PFN and PC71BM may be formed on the PFN layer and there may even exist some PFN molecules on the surface of PC71BM because of the different surface energy of the polymer and fullerene. In order to verify the assumption, water contact angle characterization was used as a tool to gain the surface polarity and calculate the surface components of the films.28,29 Measurements of the water contact angle (θ) were carried out on the ITO/PFN surface, the ITO/PC71BM surface and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM surface, as shown in Fig. 4. The contact angles of ITO/PFN and ITO/PC71BM are 72.87° and 82.06°, respectively, indicating that the PFN surface is more hydrophilic than PC71BM. Therefore, we can evaluate the surface components of ITO/PFN/PC71BM by water contact angle analysis. It is expected that a small amount of PFN on the top surface of ITO/PFN/PC71BM will decrease water contact angle and increase the hydrophilicity and surface energy of the ITO/PFN/PC71BM surface. The contact angle of ITO/PFN/PC71BM is 79.06°, which falls between θ = 72.87° for the ITO/PFN surface and θ = 82.06° for the ITO/PC71BM surface. To semi-quantify the content of PFN at the top surface, surface coverage fraction (f) of PFN on the surface of ITO/PFN/PC71BM was calculated by fitting the contact angle results to the Cassie–Baxter equation.30 cosθ = fcosθPFN + (1 − f)cosθPC71BM(1)where θPC71BM, θPFN and θ are the measured water contact angles of the ITO/PC71BM surface, the ITO/PFN surface and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM surface, respectively. Finally, the calculated f (surface coverage fraction) of PFN is 32.64% for ITO/PFN/PC71BM. Therefore, we conclude that many PFN molecules have arrived at the surface of ITO/PFN/PC71BM due to intermixing of PFN and PC71BM in CB.

A blend of PFN and PC71BM at the ITO/PFN/PC71BM surface makes the interfacial description complicated. In order to further clarify energy level alignment at the interface, we selectively investigated the energy level alignment of Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN (0.07–3.08 nm). Fig. 5a presents the UPS spectra of Al/LiF, Al/LiF/PC71BM and Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN. ϕ, EHOMO and IP of Al/LiF, Al/LiF/PC71BM and Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN (0.07–3.08 nm) derived from Fig. 5a are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Because ϕAl/LiF = 3.45 eV, which is in Region (i) of PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2a, the ϕ of Al/LiF/PC71BM predicted by the ICT model should be 4.4 eV, which is close to the measured ϕ of Al/LiF/PC71BM (ϕ = 4.32 eV), as shown in Fig. 5a. For Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN, an obvious band bending appears at the interface between PC71BM and PFN with the increase of PFN thickness, as shown in Fig. 5c. More interestingly, the UPS spectrum of Al/LiF/PC71BM (20 nm)/PFN (0.65 nm) is almost the same as the UPS spectrum of ITO/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm), shown in Fig. 5b, where they have same the ϕ values and HOMO onsets. Therefore, the complicated ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface in the i-PSCs can be described as follows. 2 nm PFN covering the ITO forms a low ϕ substrate just like Al/LiF. When PC71BM in CB solution was further spin-coated on the surface of PFN, a small amount of PFN in CB solution moved to the top surface of PC71BM because PFN as a polymer with a higher surface energy than PC71BM tends to accumulate at the top (air) surface while PC71BM correspondingly aggregates at the bottom interface.31 Therefore, ITO/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm) in the i-PSCs actually forms an interface like ITO/PFN/PFN:PC71BM, which has an energy level alignment like Al/LiF/PC71BM/PFN (0.65 nm).

Obviously, the mixed layer is advantageous to improve the interfacial contact between PC71BM and PFN and decrease the contact resistance at the interface, which improves electron transport and collection at the cathode, leading to a higher JSC and FF. In order to prove this, conductivity measurements of ITO/PC71BM (20 nm)/PFN (2 nm)/Al for the C-PSCs and ITO/PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm)/Al for the i-PSCs have been carried out, as shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), respectively. The conductivities of PC71BM (20 nm)/PFN (2 nm) and PFN (2 nm)/PC71BM (20 nm) are 1.13 × 10−6 S cm−1 and 2.25 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. In addition, we carried out XPS depth profiling analysis of the PTB7:PC71BM blend film as an active layer in ref. 11 and 12. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), PC71BM molecules enrich at the bottom of the active layer, indicating that PC71BM molecules have more chances to come in contact with ITO/PFN as a cathode in the i-PSCs than PFN/Al as a cathode in the c-PSCs. Therefore, this rationalizes the higher JSC and FF in the i-PSCs12 than in the c-PSCs.11
4. Conclusions
In summary, the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface for c-PSCs and the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface for i-PSCs have been investigated mainly using UPS and the ICT model in order to reveal the working mechanisms of PFN in the c-PSCs and i-PSCs. We used the “peel-off” method to obtain the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface and then studied the interface using UPS measurements. The UPS results demonstrated that the PC71BM/PFN/Ag interface had similar energy level alignment to Ag/PFN/PC71BM. As a result, the electron extraction barrier between PC71BM and Ag was reduced from 0.72 eV to 0.38 eV due to the insertion of PFN as the CIL in the c-PSCs, which approached the predicted value (∼0.4 eV) obtained by using the ICT model. However, there exists an intermixing layer of PFN and active layer above PFN because some PFN is dissolved by the organic solvent in the active layer solution of the i-PSCs, as confirmed by UPS and contact angle measurements. This results in a special energy level alignment at the ITO/PFN/PC71BM interface and the electron extraction barrier between PC71BM and ITO was reduced from 0.58 eV to 0.36 eV in the i-PSCs. Finally, a general model to simulate the intermixing interlayer between the alcohol-soluble organic CIL and the active layer has been proposed to describe the energy level alignment of the complicated interfaces.
