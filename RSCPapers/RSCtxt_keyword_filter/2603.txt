    , Accepted 17th March 2021First published on 18th March 2021AbstractFor semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the bombardment during the deposition of a transparent conductive oxide would inevitably damage the underlying soft materials, thereby inducing a high density of defects and creating an unfavorable band mismatch at the interface. Although interfacial buffer layers can be adopted to alleviate this bombardment damage, the device performance is still limited by the inferior fill factor (FF) due to the increased series resistance and the decreased carrier collection. In this work, a charge transfer induced 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP):Ag complex is employed to mediate the electrical contact between a C60 electron-transport layer and sputtered indium-zinc oxide (IZO) top electrode. We demonstrate that the multifunctional BCP:Ag complex can (1) reduce the electron extraction barrier by pulling up the Fermi level of BCP, (2) create beneficial gap states for electron transport, (3) serve as a hole blocking layer to suppress charge recombination, and (4) protect the C60 underlayer from the sputtering damage. As a result, the optimized electrical contact at the C60/BCP:Ag/IZO interface significantly recovered the FF of the inverted semi-transparent perovskite solar cell from 71.8% to 80.1%, yielding a device efficiency of 18.19%. By using a 23.19% efficient silicon solar cell, we also demonstrate a four-terminal tandem configuration with a total efficiency of 27.59%.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as a promising technology for large-area, flexible and low-cost power generation applications, have achieved impressive progress in just a few years with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) jumping from 3.8% to over 25%.1 Owing to the excellent optical characteristics, such as a large absorption coefficient, a steep absorption edge with no apparent presence of deep states, an adjustable bandgap over a wide range, etc., perovskite based devices can be designed to transmit light in a specific spectral range.2 Therefore, with an ideal combination of benefits that selectively converts high-energy photons into electricity while allowing low-energy photon transmission, semi-transparent perovskite solar cells hold great promise for applications in tandem solar cells, self-powered electronic device displays, and building-integrated photovoltaics.3
As opposed to conventional opaque perovskite solar cells, one of the main challenges of semi-transparent perovskite devices is the damage-free deposition of a transparent top electrode.4 In general, during the sputtering of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) top electrodes, the energetic bombardment, such as reflected neutrons, high energy electrons, and charged ions, will physically damage the surface of the underlying carrier transport layer (CTL) and transfer their high energies, leading to the degradation of the device performance.5 To address this concern, most groups endeavour to employ additional buffer layers, such as MoOx, SnOx, CuOx, zinc-tin-oxide (ZTO), etc., to prevent the damage from sputtering bombardment.6–9 Recently, we developed a promising strategy by combining the self-compensation of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) and the low-intensity sputtering of indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO) to achieve high performance semi-transparent PSCs with an inverted device structure.10 However, the fill factor (FF) of most reported semi-transparent devices is still lower than that of their opaque counterpart. This is mainly attributed to the extra bulk resistance associated with the additional buffer layer, and the energetic barrier induced by the energy level mismatch between TCO transparent top electrodes and CTLs, especially for inverted semi-transparent devices due to the lack of stable low-work-function TCO electrodes.11 Thus, it is urgently desirable to develop a physically robust, optically transparent and electrically lossless buffer layer to protect the underlying layers and simultaneously guarantee devices with high PCEs.
In this work, a multifunctional BCP:Ag complex is employed to mediate the electrical contact behaviour at the interface between a C60 electron-transport layer (ETL) and sputtered IZO top electrodes for efficient inverted semi-transparent perovskite solar cells. Due to the diffusion of Ag into the bulk of BCP and the subsequent charge transfer between BCP and Ag, the formation of a BCP:Ag complex is achieved by simply evaporating 1 nm Ag on the BCP. Our measurements reveal that the resultant BCP:Ag complex can not only reduce the electron extraction barrier by pushing the Fermi level (EF) of BCP to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) side, but also create beneficial gap states for electron transport. Consequently, in contrast to the conventional metal NP buffer layer/CTL contact with a bilayer structure, in which the metal is present at the CTL surface and acts as a cascade of energy levels for carrier transport through adjacent conduction levels, the BCP:Ag complex plays a significant role in extracting and transporting photogenerated electrons and simultaneously serves as a hole blocking layer to suppress charge recombination as well as a robust buffer layer to protect the organic underlayer from sputtering damage. As a result, the device PCE is improved from 16.14% to 18.19% without sacrificing any transparency. Strikingly, the device FF surges from 71.8% to 80.1%, which is the first time that the FF of semi-transparent PSCs exceeded 80% to the best of our knowledge (Table S1†). Combining our optimised semi-transparent PSC with a crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell, an integrated four-terminal (4T) tandem device with a total PCE of 27.59% is achieved.
Results and discussion
The schematic architecture and cross-sectional SEM image of the inverted planar PSC device are shown in Fig. 1a and b. In this inverted device structure, the triple cation-based CsFAMA perovskite absorber film (Cs, FA and MA denote cesium, formamidinium and methylammonium, respectively) was deposited by a one-step anti-solvent method as the active layer.12 The solution-processed MeO-2PACz ([2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid) acted as the hole-transport layer (HTL),13 covering on the ITO substrate, while the vacuum-deposited C60/BCP bilayer film was employed as the ETL at the top electrode side.14 For opaque PSCs, a 120 nm-thick Ag film was used as the top cathode. For semi-transparent PSCs, the top electrode was substituted by a 180 nm sputtered IZO transparent film with and without 1 nm thick Ag deposited at the interface between BCP and IZO. The detailed device fabrication process is also described in the Experimental section.

Fig. 1c shows the device performances of the two kinds of semi-transparent PSCs compared with the control opaque device measured without any encapsulation under the standard test conditions (1 sun, room temperature, and RH ∼ 60%). The semi-transparent devices were illuminated from the glass side to avoid some parasitic absorption from the ETL and top electrode. The J–V parameters of the three kinds of devices are collected in Table 1. For both semi-transparent devices, no apparent S-shaped J–V curve is observed, indicating that our thermal-evaporated C60/BCP ETL has high tolerance to the bombardment in IZO sputtering, agreeing well with our previous report.10 Compared with the current density (JSC, 22.92 mA cm−2) of the control opaque one, the JSC of the semi-transparent device without Ag was 20.95 mA cm−2, which can be ascribed to the decreased internal reflectance of near-bandgap light due to the lack of the Ag back reflector.15 It was improved to 21.14 mA cm−2 because of the interfacial modification of 1 nm Ag. All three JSC values obtained from J–V curves were verified by using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 1d. The comparison of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) between the semi-transparent devices (1.073 V and 1.076 V) and the control opaque one (1.081 V) further proves the high and equivalent quality of all the devices especially at the interfaces of the device, and the little differentia might be attributed to the energy level difference between the transparent IZO electrode and thick Ag electrode. Regarding the FF, the semi-transparent device without Ag lags far behind the control opaque one, which is generally observed in most semi-transparent PSCs and could be recognized as interfacial obstructions due to the process derived defect states as well as larger lateral resistance of metal oxide conductive films.16,17 Strikingly, the modification of 1 nm Ag at the interface between BCP and IZO pushes the FF from 71.8% to 80.1% remarkably, approaching 80.5% of that of the control opaque device. This effect also accounts for the little improvements in both VOC and JSC shown in Table 1. Benefited from that, the PCE also surges from 16.14% to 18.19%. The device parameter statistics of both semi-transparent PSCs are also compared (Fig. S1†) to prove the reliability of this effect. This device PCE (18.19%) is among the top PECs of semi-transparent PSCs based on an inverted planar device structure shown in the summary of semi-transparent devices collected in Table S1 and Fig. S2.†

In order to gain a better understanding of the effect of the Ag layer on the device performance, we first compare the quality of the IZO films deposited on quartz substrates with and without an Ag interlayer. Fig. S3a† shows the optical transmittance and absorptance of the IZO cathodes in the wavelength range 300–1200 nm with and without Ag. The transmittance of the Ag layer is also shown in Fig. S3b.† The bare IZO is highly transparent with ∼80–90% light transmission in the whole wavelength range, confirming it as a suitable TCO cathode candidate. While 1 nm evaporated Ag on glass also demonstrates excellent transparency, a combination of 1 nm Ag and IZO causes transmission in the visible region (400–700 nm) fall to ∼70–80%. This can be explained by the surface-plasmon polariton absorption of Ag NPs, as indicated by the appearance of absorption peaks at a wavelength around 430 nm.18 This absorption has, however, only a very limited effect on the performance of our top-illuminated ST devices and 4T tandem devices, as the perovskite active layer has absorbed all the light up to wavelengths of ≈550 nm.19 While in the near-infrared region (>800 nm), the Ag layer absorbs less light and is highly transparent. Thus, most of the photons are still available to pass through the ST devices, as indicated by the invariable transmittance in the wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm (Fig. S4†). Aside from optical considerations, the sputtered TCO is known to be sensitive to the subsurface. As such, the effect of the Ag buffer layer on the conductivity of IZO should also be examined. However, a relatively similar sheet resistance of around 40 Ω sq−1 can be observed for both IZO and Ag/IZO and may be due to the very thin Ag layer. As the sheet resistance measurements characterize the carrier transportation behaviour in the plane direction along the IZO, we speculate that the gains determining the PV performance occur almost entirely at the improved contact interface between the ETL and IZO cathode (charge transport and extraction in the out of plane direction).
To confirm our hypothesis, we perform a systematic study on the electron transport and extraction characteristics of BCP/Ag/IZO contact stacks. Fig. 2a shows the electron transport behaviour of the electron-only devices in configurations of ITO/SnOx/perovskite/C60/BCP/with and without Ag/IZO/thick Ag. At low bias voltage, the BCP/Ag based devices showed near ohmic transport and exhibit much higher current density than the device with only BCP. This behaviour indicates that the introduction of Ag enhances the electron transport at the C60/IZO interface. That is also confirmed by the obviously improved conductivity shown in Fig. 2b. At the end of the ohmic response (Fig. 2a), the appearance of a kink point represents the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) and the current surges nonlinearly, suggesting that the trap states are completely filled. The decrease in VTFL indicates a reduced electron trap-state density after the introduction of Ag, suggesting a well-protected perovskite surface from sputter bombardment. Thus, the more efficient electron transport is presumed as a combined result of the reduced surface traps of perovskite and the improved conductivity of BCP. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was also used to study the electron transport kinetics from the perovskite absorber to the different contacts. As shown in Fig. 2c and Table S3,† the stronger PL quenching and shorter lifetime indicate that the electron extraction is significantly enhanced by the introduction of Ag,20 in good agreement with the results of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. S5†).

(b) The contact resistivity of the structures (ITO/SnOx/C60/BCP/Ag/IZO/thick Ag) with and without an Ag interlayer measured by electrical J–V testing. The conductivity of the films before and after the introduction of Ag estimated by applying Ohm's law was 3.97 and 7.52 × 10−7 (Ω cm)−1, respectively. (c) PL decay dynamics of the glass/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag/IZO structure. 
To figure out the mechanism behind the enhanced electron extraction, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was performed to further analyse the impact of the Ag interlayer on the energy level of BCP. The contact potential difference (CPD) of each film was measured by using a Pt/Cr coated Si tip as the reference. A positive (negative) CPD value indicates a lower (higher) work function (WF) compared to that of the biased tip. Fig. 3a–c show the surface potential images obtained from BCP, BCP/IZO and BCP/Ag, respectively. The pristine BCP film showed a darker colour corresponding to its average CPD value of 828 mV (Fig. 3d). After the coating of IZO, the BCP surface potential image exhibited a brighter red colour (corresponding to a decreased average CPD value of 164 mV), resulting from a down shift of the energy level of vacuum (EVAC) at the surface due to the higher WF of IZO. Interestingly, after the deposition of Ag on BCP, the surface potential shifts to the positive direction (corresponding to an increased average CPD value of 868 mV), indicating an upper shift of EVAC.21 Thus, we can exclude the possibility that the Ag interlayer implemented between the low-WF BCP and the high-WF IZO can give rise to a cascade of energy levels, which probably facilitate the electron transfer at the interface.

To clarify the real changes in the energy band alignment that are responsible for the improvement in the carrier transport in the presence of the Ag layer, we carried out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements for the BCP/IZO interface. The full range of the normalized UPS spectra for the BCP film before and after the deposition of Ag are depicted in Fig. 3e. The sample of the IZO capping layer directly deposited on the BCP is also shown as a reference to mimic the device contact of BCP/IZO. Note that the thickness of the IZO over-layer was controlled to be ultrathin (∼2 nm) to let the buried interfaces accessible for measurements. The surface EF (or WF) can be determined by the intersection point of the two slopes of the UPS spectra in the secondary electron cut-off region (Fig. 3f), while the top of the HOMO (or valence band edge) can be determined by the first lowest point of the differential-treated UPS spectra in the HOMO region (Fig. 3g). The EF of the bare BCP film was 3.17 eV, and the top of the HOMO was initially 3.57 eV below the EF. The BCP spectrum consists of a series of well-defined peaks typical of molecular levels, reflecting mostly π orbitals at low binding energy and an increased σ-like character at higher binding energy.22 The deposition of IZO produced an abrupt upward shift of 0.53 eV in the position of the vacuum level, corresponding to the formation of an interface dipole pointing from BCP to IZO.23 Thus, a potential barrier for electron transfer from BCP to IZO is formed at this abrupt interface, consistent with the results of KPFM. The spectral features of BCP are completely quenched by the IZO over-layer, and the UPS spectrum of the BCP/IZO surface was characteristic of bulk IZO.24 However, the situation is quite different for the BCP/Ag sample, which did not form an abrupt interface. The exposure of the BCP surface to the Ag flux caused a 0.18 eV downward shift of the HOMO position with respect to the EF, accompanied by a 0.02 eV downward shift of the vacuum level. The dipole shift corresponds to a dipole vector pointing from the Ag towards the BCP, which is opposite to that observed at the BCP/IZO interface, and consequently reduces the electron-extraction barrier. The deposition of Ag attenuates the BCP features, but all the molecular peaks remain identifiable, indicating an incomplete coverage of Ag as a result of the strong interaction between Ag and BCP.25 In addition, no evidence of metallic Ag, like a Fermi edge or a spectrum line shape equivalent to that obtained for the thick Ag film (Fig. S6†), is obtained. These observations indicated that the Ag over-layer remains non-metallic at this thickness and does not accumulate at the BCP surface. The result is also confirmed by a much smoother surface for the BCP/Ag sample, as presented in Fig. S7,† in stark contrast to the island-like surface features of the rough Ag layer directly deposited on bare glass. It has been reported that Ag is highly mobile and tends to rapidly diffuse into the organic films on which it has been deposited.26 Here, the nitrogen atoms from pyridine groups in BCP (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. S8†) can interact with hot Ag atoms or cations (Ag+) during the deposition process, resulting in radical BCP ions and charge transfer complexes of BCP:Ag.27 To see the spectral changes induced by this diffusion and the concomitant charge transfer between Ag atoms and BCP molecules in more detail, we presented the magnified and normalized valence band spectra near the EF on a logarithmic scale after removing the secondary electron background (Fig. 3h).28 A sharp cut-off at the valence band maximum (VBM) and a negligible density of states for both BCP and BCP/IZO samples can be observed. In contrast, the BCP/Ag sample shows a less abrupt valence band edge and, more importantly, a density of filled states extending into the bandgap from the valence band maximum to EF, with two additional peaks located at about 0.75 (peak S1 in Fig. 3h) and 2.55 eV (peak S2) below the EF. Such states have been observed previously at interfaces like Mg, Ca or Li on Alq3.29 The existence of these gap states implies the presence of positive molecular ions in BCP, which are the result of electron transfer from the BCP molecules to the Ag.30 These ions create the region of net electric field near the interface, which is responsible for the offset of the vacuum level.
To elucidate the origin of gap states and disclose the chemical interaction between BCP and Ag, the internal chemical states of Ag and N in BCP:Ag are studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The appearance of an Ag signal in the XPS survey spectra confirms the presence of Ag element in the BCP:Ag sample. The fine XPS spectra of Ag 3d and N 1s for BCP:Ag are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. A negative binding energy shift (0.55 eV) of the Ag 3d peak for BCP:Ag is observed relative to that for Ag on bare glass. Here, the Ag atom is changed to its oxidized form (Ag+) when diffused into the BCP film, indicating an n-doping like process between Ag and BCP.31 Meanwhile the N 1s core level of BCP shifts by 0.45 eV to higher binding energy and broadens after the deposition of Ag. There is no change of binding energy for the C 1s peak (Fig. S9†). Thus, the more nucleophilic N atoms rather than C atoms in BCP are considered as the binding sites with Ag+. Since a negatively charged atom has a higher binding energy of electrons, these spectral shifts evidence the electron transfer from N of BCP to Ag.32 Hence, the BCP:Ag complexes are formed through the formation of coordinate covalent bonds between the Ag and N atoms of BCP during the deposition.

UV-Vis-IR spectroscopy provides another direct means to validate the existence of gap states and charge transfer complexes in the BCP:Ag system. The absorption spectrum of the pristine BCP film (deducted from the absorption of a bare quartz substrate) shows only absorption by π–π* transition below a wavelength of 350 nm which is consistent with the BCP energy gap (3.5 eV).33 However, when the Ag is deposited on top of the BCP film (deducted from the absorption of an Ag/quartz substrate), a new absorption peak appeared at about 510 nm, as indicated by a triangle in Fig. 4c. This is in contrast with the individual Ag layer, which is transparent in this wavelength region. This additional sub-bandgap absorption peak is generated at the expense of the π–π* transition of BCP (as evidenced by the reduced absorption at 350 nm), implying the formation of charge transfer complexes induced by the reaction between Ag metal and BCP.33 The BCP:Ag complexes show sub-bandgap absorption from 405 nm to 700 nm, and thus the distribution of calculated state energy levels in the BCP layer is from 1.77 eV to 3.06 eV which are based on the HOMO of BCP, and the highest density of states at 2.43 eV results from the absorption peak at 510 nm. However, for the direct contact of IZO and BCP, the condition is quite different. The absorption spectra of the BCP/IZO film (deducted from the absorption of an IZO/quartz substrate) show no charge transfer complex peak (Fig. 4d), demonstrating the absence of gap states at the BCP/IZO interface. Indeed, it has been reported that the charge transfer between BCP and metal is found to decrease with increasing metal WF.34 Here, the IZO, as a high WF TCO, does not react with the BCP and thus produce an abrupt interface when directly deposited on BCP. This finding is consistent with the formation of no gap states at the interface between BCP and Au, where the EF of Au is 5.2 eV.34
To determine the distribution of BCP:Ag complexes, we performed angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) measurements with different photoelectron take-off angles, that is, 90°, 60°, 30°, and 15°. The measured intensities of the Ag 3d and N 1s core levels as a function of photoelectron take-off angle are shown in Fig. 5a and S10.† The surface sensitivity of XPS increases at low photoelectron take-off angles because of a reduction in the photoelectron escape depth.30 Hence, the decrease in the signal intensity of the Ag 3d core level at low photoelectron take-off angles corroborates that the Ag atoms in BCP:Ag are diffused into the bulk rather than confined at the surface. In addition, the binding energy of the Ag 3d peak is almost invariant to the take-off angles, indicating the uniform distribution of Ag over the XPS sampling depth. This again provides evidence for the diffusion of Ag and the subsequent formation of BCP:Ag complexes in the bulk of BCP. Thus, we conclude that Ag initially diffuses deep into the BCP film during the deposition without appreciable surface accumulation. The resulting BCP/Ag interface is a thick and uniform intermixed BCP:Ag layer with a high density of states in the BCP gap region.

To further investigate the location of Ag element in the perovskite device, we also performed energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of the device cross section in a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode (Fig. 5b–h). Fig. 5c shows the C signal to identify the organic BCP and C60 layer, where the total thickness of the bilayer is ∼35 nm (Fig. S11†).10 As shown in Fig. 5d and S11,† although the thickness of the deposited Ag is only 1 nm, a conformal and homogeneous Ag layer with ca. 10 nm in thickness can be distinctly observed. The In and Zn elements contained in the IZO layer can be identified as shown in Fig. 5e and f. The typical mappings of Pb and I (Fig. 5g and h) demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of those elements in the perovskite active layer. It can be seen that the distribution of Ag element overlaps with that of C element, and the distribution depth of Ag is identical to the thickness of the BCP layer, both of which confirm that the Ag was mainly located in the BCP film rather than on the surface.
To explicitly demonstrate the effect of the charge transfer complex induced gap states on the electron extraction and transport at the contact, the energy level diagrams of the BCP/IZO and BCP:Ag/IZO interfaces are schematically depicted in Fig. 5i and j, respectively. The HOMO compiled from the UPS results are 6.74 eV for BCP and 6.8 eV for BCP:Ag, respectively. Depending on the optical bandgaps derived from the absorption edges, the LUMO can be determined to be 1.8 eV and 1.86 eV correspondingly, in agreement with reported values.32,35 The distribution of gap state energy levels in the BCP:Ag layer is deduced from the absorption spectrum (Fig. 4c). In a general view, BCP only acts as a dielectric layer to block the holes from flowing to cathodes and passivate the contact between the metal electrode and C60 ETL in the routine device structure.36 Now, in the device structure of semi-transparent PSCs, the thicker BCP layer with the function of anti-bombardment would cause the large energy level mismatch observed between the LUMO of BCP and the WF of IZO. This definitely limits the tunnelling probability and inhibits the interfacial carrier transport, thus resulting in undesired carrier accumulation and recombination at the contact.37 However, in the case of BCP:Ag, the HOMO level is a little deeper and the EF is a little shallower than those of BCP, which can be ascribed to the doping effect to push the EF to the LUMO side, thus decreasing the electron extraction barrier. In addition, the free electrons generated in the active layer can transport through the favourable transportation channels of gap states, which cover the energy level between the LUMO of C60 and the EF of IZO, therefore eliminating the charge accumulation and improving the FF of the devices. Therefore, we can conclude that both the reduction in the barrier height and the creation of BCP:Ag complex induced energy states in the BCP bandgap contribute to the enhancement of electron extraction and transport characteristics at the perovskite/IZO interface.
The stability of semi-transparent PSCs is one of the most important criteria for commercialization. The device stability test was performed with maximum power point (MPP) tracking under an ambient environment with 53% relative humidity without temperature control and encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 6a, our semi-transparent devices with the BCP:Ag complex lost only around 2% of their initial PCE after 12 h. This result indicates that the top IZO layers, which can effectively resist moisture ingress, can protect the underlying perovskite absorber film from the intrusion of hydromolecules.38

(b) J–V characteristic spectra of the semi-transparent PSCs and c-Si solar cells with and without a filter. (c) EQE spectra of the tandem device. The yellow curve is the sum of EQE from the top and bottom cells. 
We then applied our efficient semi-transparent PSCs as the top cells to construct a 4T tandem device, combined with a single crystalline silicon (c-Si) cell as the bottom one (Fig. 6b). The bottom c-Si cell consists of a diffused boron emitter at the front and a passivated n+ poly-Si/SiOx contact at the rear, which is often referred to as tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon).39 The performance of our integrated 4T tandem device was tested independently for each sub-cell. The J–V curves of the semi-transparent perovskite top cell and the filtered c-Si bottom cell (1 cm2) are shown in Fig. 6b, along with that of the unfiltered c-Si cell. As summarized in Table 2, the measured bottom cell PCE was 23.19% with a VOC of 0.739 V, a JSC of 38.45 mA cm−2 and a FF of 81.63%, respectively. After the spectrum filter, the significant decrease in JSC accounts for the drop in the PCE of the c-Si cell to 9.40%, which can also be examined in the corresponding EQE (Fig. 6c). Concomitantly, the decreased light spectrum also leads to a gentle reduction in the VOC of the c-Si cell. Combined with our optimized 18.19% semi-transparent perovskite, an overall PCE of 27.59% is obtained in this 4T tandem device configuration. This value beats the highest PCE of 4T inverted perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells reported to date (Fig. S12†), demonstrating the unique advantage of both high conversion-efficiency and high transparency of our semi-transparent PSC.

Experimental
Fabrication of semi-transparent PSCs
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned and sonicated with detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After that, the substrates were treated in an UV-ozone cleaner for 15 min for wettability enhancement and removal of any organic contamination. All subsequent procedures were done in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For the HTL deposition, MeO-PACz powder was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol at a concentration of 1 mmol l−1 and put into an ultrasonic bath for 15 min (30–40 °C), followed by spin coating on the cleaned substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, the CsFAMA-mixed perovskite layers (ca. 500 nm) were fabricated according to our previously reported one-step anti-solvent recipe. After perovskite film deposition, C60 (25 nm), BCP (10 nm) and Ag (1 nm) were sequentially deposited via thermal evaporation in a high vacuum. Identical devices that lack Ag were also fabricated as references. A 180 nm-thick indium zinc oxide (In/Zn ratio 90/10) window layer was deposited by sputtering, using a ø60 mm target at room temperature with a radiofrequency power of 80 W. It should be noted that the first 10 nm IZO film deposition was conducted with a lower power of 30 W to minimize damage to the underlayer. Finally, a silver U-shaped busbar (finger width 500 μm; finger distance 2.5 mm) was evaporated around the IZO pads.
Fabrication of TOPCon solar cells
The TOPCon solar cell was prepared using an n-type Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafer with a thickness of ∼180 μm and a resistivity of 1–3 Ω cm. The wafer was subjected to the standard KOH texturing and cleaning process of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) using deionized water, NH4OH, H2O2, and HCl. A p–n junction was formed by diffusing boron using BBr3 on the textured surface, and the tunnel oxide layer was grown on the wafer surface in H2O2 solution at 80 °C. Subsequently, phosphorus-doped polysilicon was deposited and subjected to a high-temperature annealing process. To improve the interfacial passivation characteristics of the cell structure, Al2O3 was deposited using ALD (atomic layer deposition), and SiNx, which served as an ARC (antireflection coating), was further deposited to absorb the light from the front side of the solar cell.
Characterization
The optical absorption, reflectance, and transmittance spectra were obtained by using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 mm-diameter integrating sphere. The absorption of the quartz substrate and Ag/quartz substrate is measured as a baseline for the BCP absorption measurement for the samples of BCP/quartz and Ag/BCP/quartz, respectively. The sheet resistance measurements were performed by using a four-point probe system (ST-2258A). The morphologies and surface potentials of the samples were measured with a scanning probe microscope (Veeco, Dimension 3100), while the morphology and the cross section of the samples were captured by SEM (Hitachi, S4800). TR-PL decay profiles were obtained at 800 nm with the 532 nm excitation of an optical parametric oscillator laser system (HORIBA FL3-111). The charge transport properties of the contact were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Solartron Analytical, 1470E). XPS and UPS were performed under ultrahigh vacuum with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (Kratos Axis Ultra Ltd.) using He–I excitation (21.22 eV). The ionization energy (IE) and WF were defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level and the top of the HOMO or the EF, respectively. The position of each interface state was determined by subtracting the background intensity. The J–V curves were recorded using a software-controlled source meter (Keithley 2400 Source Meter) under dark conditions and the simulated sunlight irradiation of 1 sun (AM1.5G; 100 mW cm2) using a solar simulator (EMS-35AAA, Ushio Spax Inc.) based on an Ushio Xe short arc lamp 500. The aperture for the measurement was 0.1 cm2. The EQE spectra were recorded with an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system (QE-R), and the light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Conclusions
In summary, a charge transfer induced BCP:Ag complex is employed to mediate the electrical contact behaviour at the interface between a C60 ETL and sputtered IZO top electrodes for efficient inverted semi-transparent perovskite solar cells. The multifunctional BCP:Ag complex plays a significant role in extracting and transporting free electrons and simultaneously serves as a hole blocking layer to suppress charge recombination as well as a robust buffer layer to protect the underlayers from sputtering damage. As a result, the device PCE is improved from 16.14% to 18.19% without deteriorating its transparency, comparable to the best value reported for inverted semi-transparent perovskite devices. Remarkably, the device FF surges from 71.8% to 80.1%, which represents the first time that the FF of semi-transparent PSCs exceeded 80%. By combining this optimised semi-transparent PSCs with an efficient TOPCon c-Si solar cell, we achieved a 4T tandem solar cell PCE of 27.59%, which is one of the best efficiencies for 4T inverted perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.
