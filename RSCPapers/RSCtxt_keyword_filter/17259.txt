The highly twisted conformations between an indeno[1,2-b]fluorene core and peripheral aryl substitutions endow these indeno[1,2-b]fluorene derivatives with good photostability for use as electron donors for vacuum-deposited photovoltaic devices. The optimized device based on a TAInF2 donor blended with C70 as an electron acceptor produces a high open-circuit voltage (>0.9 V) and a power conversion efficiency of 2.91%. This work demonstrates the first application of an indenofluorene derivative as an electron donor in organic solar cells.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) has attracted considerable interest for decades as a promising sustainable approach for transforming sunlight into electrical energy.1–4 The primary criterion of an organic molecule that can be utilized in OPV is efficient absorption of sun emission. In general, heteroarene-embedded polyaromatic molecules that exhibit strong visible light absorption and promising photostability could be highly potential for OPV applications.5–14 In addition, pure hydrocarbon polyaromatics with extended π-conjugated systems also show good absorption properties.15–21 However, only limited polycyclic aromatic chromophores with π-conjugated pure hydrocarbon cores have been reported as suitable electronic donors to give good efficiency OPVs.22–26 Among various pure hydrocarbon polyaromatic structures, indenofluorene (InF),27,28 a formally anti-aromatic system, which exhibits high visible-light absorbance owing to its ground state quinoidal structure,29 could be a good candidate for OPV application. However, some InFs are suspected to form biradicals, leading to low stability, which would impede their optoelectronic applications. Recently, independent reports by Haley30–34 and Yamashita29 indicated that 6,12-diarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes are stable. Particularly, indeno[1,2-b]fluorene derivatives with highly twisted aryl substitutions at C6 and C12 positions showed remarkable photostability, which is crucial for further application. In addition, the carrier transport characters of indeno[1,2-b]fluorene derivatives also suggest high potential for optoelectronic application.29,30 As reported, the introduced aryl substitutions can effectively govern structural stability and modulate the physical properties of indeno[1,2-b]fluorene derivatives.29–32 A key factor for the structural stability is the dihedral angle between the peripheral aryl group and coplanar indeno[1,2-b]fluorene core. We envisioned that additional aryl substitutions introduced at C5 and C11 of the indeno[1,2-b]fluorene core should significantly twist C6 and C12 aryl substituents, leading to more photostable indeno[1,2-b]fluorene derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis and properties of 5,6,11,12-tetraaryl-substituted indeno[1,2-b]fluorenes have not been reported. In this work, we report the synthesis, X-ray structure, and properties of three new 5,6,11,12-tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes (TAInF1–3, Scheme 1), and compare them to those of 6,12-diphenylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene to demonstrate the effects of C5 and C11 aryl substituents on structural features and physical characteristics. These new tetraaryl InF derivatives were further utilized as electron donors blended with C70 as an active layer in vacuum-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). The device employing TAInF2 as the electron donor exhibited the best performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 2.91%. Our results manifested the first example and potential of using indenofluorene as an electron donor in OPV applications.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of TAInF1–3. 

Scheme 1 depicts the synthesis of 5,6,11,12-tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes (TAInF). Following the protocols established by Haley and Yamashita,29,30 the nucleophilic addition of appropriate aryl lithium to an indenofluorenone (2), which was prepared according to the reported literature from the diester (1),35 produced the corresponding diol intermediates. The crude diols were reduced with SnCl2 in refluxing toluene to furnish the target molecules with low isolated yields because of the low solubility in organic solvents.
Single crystals of TAInF1–3, suitable for X-ray analysis, were obtained from a bilayer (CHCl3/MeOH) diffusion method. The crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1 and crystal data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The selected bond lengths of InF cores are listed in Fig. 1 (also Table S1 in the ESI†). The bond length alternations (BLAs) are observed in all cases, indicating a quinoidal core structure in the ground state. Interestingly, the external C1C2 bonds are slightly longer than the internal C9C10 bonds in 6,12-diphenyl and -ditolyl substituted InFs, TAInF1 and TAInF2, respectively, which are similar to the reported cases of 6,12-diarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes. Whereas, the external and internal CC bonds of the quinoidal core have the same length in thiophene-substituted InF (TAInF3). The dihedral angle between C5,C11-substituted phenyl rings and the central phenylene ring of InFs were calculated to be 73.2°–79.5° (Fig. 1). Apparently, the steric congestion from C5- and C11-substituted phenyl rings forces the C6 and C12 aryl substitutions to adopt highly twisted conformations with large dihedral angles ranging from 63.8° to 66.8°, which are larger than the case of 6,12-diphenylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene (43.4°) and close to those of analogous 6,12-diarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes (56.6–76.5°)29 showing higher photostability. This implies that the introduction of phenyl substitutions onto the central phenylene ring of InF imparts the ability to twist C6- and C12-substituted aryl groups, which is the crucial factor governing molecular stability.

It is generally accepted that molecular ordering has a pronounced effect on charge carrier transport behavior. The crystals of TAInF1 and TAInF3 adopted a brick wall-like packing motif mediated through evident π–π stacking interactions (Fig. 2). In contrast, a herringbone-type packing was observed in TAInF2 crystals. Clearly, the extra space demand of the methyl terminus in TAInF2 led to less-ordered packing in crystals. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that these new tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes exhibited relatively high thermal stability, with decomposition temperature (Td) (corresponding to 5% weight loss) higher than 318 °C (Table 1), producing sufficient stability for thermal deposition under a high vacuum.

The electronic absorption spectra of TAInF1–3 in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 3 and the data are summarized in Table 1. These compounds exhibited a broad absorption band with vibronic features and notably high extinction coefficients (3.5–4.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) in the visible wavelength region (450–600 nm). The λmax of thiophene-substituted TAInF3 was slightly red-shifted (∼40 nm) compared to those of TAInF1 and TAInF2. Interestingly, the λmax of 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene (TAInF1) was blue-shifted (∼20 nm) compared to that of 6,12-diphenylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene. DFT calculations were able to reproduce the molecular structures (Fig. 4), and orbital analysis indicated that HOMO and LUMO were localized on the InF core with limited contribution from C6 and C12 aryl substitutions and neglected the contribution from C5 and C11 phenyl groups. Hence, the highly twisted conformations decoupling the π-conjugations between the InF core and peripheral aryl substitutions account for larger optical energy gaps of tetraaryl-substituted InFs.

The electrochemical properties of TAInF1–3 were probed with cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves (Fig. 5) clearly reveal the reversibility of oxidation (in CH2Cl2) and reduction (in THF) scans, indicating the electrochemical stability of the corresponding ionic radicals. The oxidation potentials (∼0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of these 5,6,10,11-tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes were independent of the structural features of aryl substitutions, whereas the reduction potential of TAInF3 was surprisingly lower than those of diphenyl- and ditolyl-substituted counterparts (TAInF1 and TAInF2). Theoretical analysis showed that TAInF3 was also found to be 3–4 kcal mol−1 more favorable for reduction than TAInF1 or TAInF2, consistent with experimental observations. Evaluation of the singly occupied orbitals of three anion radicals (all similar to the electron density shared by the thiophene and phenyl groups in TAInF1–3, Fig. S1 in the ESI†) suggested that the difference may be due to the tendency of the thiophene and phenylene rings to be reduced. In all cases, no singlet biradical character was identified computationally or experimentally, suggesting that they all have closed-shell ground state structures. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TAInF1–3 were estimated from the HOMO (−4.8 eV) of ferrocene (Fc) as the Fc+/Fc redox couple served as the reference (Table 1). Clearly, the red-shifted λmax of TAInF3 was attributable to a lower LUMO than those of diphenyl- and ditolyl-substituted counterparts.

The thin films of TAInF1–3 exhibited red-shifted λmax and wide visible-light absorption covering from 400 to 700 nm (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), which can facilitate efficient sunlight harvesting. The ionization potential (IP) of the TAInF1–3 thin films was determined by AC-2 (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The low-lying IPs ∼5.6 eV, together with broad absorption, implies that these new tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes have potential applications as small molecule electron donors for vacuum-deposited OPVs.
Owing to the high crystalline feature, these new tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes were first employed as donor materials in vacuum-processed bilayer-type OPVs configured as ITO/MoO3 (15 nm)/TAInF1–3 (12 nm)/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (120 nm), where bathocuproine (BCP) was introduced as an electron-transporting and hole-blocking layer. Device performances are summarized in Fig. S4 and Table S2.† The PCE of these bilayer-type OPVs was only 0.31, 0.47, and 0.41% for TAInF1, TAInF2, and TAInF3-based devices, respectively. The low PCEs were attributed to limited donor/acceptor interfaces, where the relatively thick C60 layer was mainly responsible for absorbing visible light and generating the exciton. The obtained open-circuit voltage (Voc) values, TAInF1 (0.54 V), TAInF2 (0.63 V), and TAInF3 (0.62 V), were nonetheless significantly lower than the energy level differences between the IPs (TAInF1: 5.70 eV, TAInF2: 5.65 eV, and TAInF3: 5.60 eV) and the LUMO level of C60 (4.4 eV).26 Our previous work demonstrated that the Voc strongly depends on the electron donor's morphology and intermolecular interaction,36 implying that the structural features of tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes, in addition to different intermolecular interactions, may dramatically affect Voc. The pure TAInF1–3 films were then probed with an atomic force microscope (AFM) to explore the effects of molecular packing on surface morphology. Fig. 6 shows that the surface roughness of the herringbone-packing TAInF2 film was relatively smooth (rms = 0.525 nm). In contrast, TAInF3 (rms = 3.562 nm) and TAInF1 (rms = 15.12 nm), which adopted the brick wall-like packing motif in crystals, exhibited a rough surface morphology. The rough surface morphology of the TAInF1 film resulted in the lowest Voc among donors, because of strong intermolecular interactions or aggregations. This implies that suppressing the propensity of the intermolecular interactions or aggregations of crystalline tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes is crucial for improving OPV device characteristics. Thus, vacuum-deposited bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs with active layers of TAInF1–3:C70 blended films were fabricated with the device configured as ITO/MoO3 (15 nm)/active layer (1:1 by volume, 45 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (120 nm). Fig. 7 shows the JV characteristics of BHJ OPV devices. Device performance data are summarized in Table S3.† However, in spite of superior exciton dissociation in BHJ devices with the InF/C70 (1:1) blended active layer, the obtained Jsc and PCE were only slightly improved over those of bilayer-type devices (Table S2 in the ESI†). Nevertheless, the Voc of TAInF1:C70 (1:1) BHJ OPV (0.90 V) was much higher than that of TAInF1-based bilayer-type OPV (0.54 V). AFM analysis indicated the smooth surface roughness of the TAInF1–3:C70 thin films (Fig. S5 in ESI†), implying that the intermolecular interactions or aggregations of crystalline tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes were suppressed as they blended with C70, thereby reducing the reverse saturation current of the device, resulting in high Voc. The low device efficiency was possibly because, even with a 1:1 mixing ratio, the active layer could not provide greater charge balance/collection efficiency or sufficient absorption (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Tang reported that a bulk OPV active layer with a low donor concentration can achieve a high PCE owing to high absorption and charge collection capability of the C70 acceptor.37 Accordingly, BHJ OPV devices with a low tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene ratio were examined. The device based on TAInF2:C70 (1:10) as an active layer achieved a superior PCE of 2.91% with Voc of 0.94 V, Jsc of 8.62 mA cm−2, and FF of 35.9%, under standard AM 1.5 irradiation, whereas TAInF1- and TAInF3-based devices achieved 1.7% PCE (Fig. S6 and Table S3 in the ESI†). The improved performance was ascribed to the formation of well-separated donor/acceptor phases in the low-donor-concentration TAInF2:C70 active layer.

In summary, three new 5,6,11,12-tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes were synthesized and characterized. X-ray structural analyses indicated that the additional aryl substitutions introduced at C5 and C11 of the InF core significantly twisted C6 and C12 phenyl substituents, which is the crucial factor for molecular stability. The highly twisted conformations decoupled the π-conjugations between the InF core and peripheral aryl substitutions led to blue-shifted absorption, compared to that of 6,12-diphenylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene. Theoretical analyses also confirmed that both HOMO/LUMO orbitals were mainly localized on the InF core with limited contribution from C6 and C12 aryl substitutions, neglecting the contribution from C5 and C11 aryl groups. In all cases, no singlet biradical character was identified computationally or experimentally, suggesting that they all have closed-shell ground state structures. The low-lying IPs ∼5.6 eV, together with broad absorption, made these new tetraarylindeno[1,2-b]fluorenes suitable electron donors for vacuum-deposited OPVs. The superlative device adopted TAInF2 blended with C70 as a donor and an acceptor, respectively, in the active layer, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 2.91%. Our results manifest the effects of C5- and C11-aryl substitutions on the structural features and physical characteristics of InF derivatives and pioneer the use of indenofluorene as an electron donor in OPV applications.
