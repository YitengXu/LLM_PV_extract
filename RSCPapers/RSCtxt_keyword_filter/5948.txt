    , Accepted 22nd November 2013First published on 25th November 2013AbstractAimed at enhancing the liquid electrolyte loading, ionic conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity toward iodides, a freeze-dried microporous polyacrylate–poly(ethylene glycol) (PAA–PEG) matrix was employed to uptake conducting substances, such as graphene, graphene oxide, and graphite. A liquid electrolyte loading of 21.1 g per g and a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 11.60 mS cm−1 were obtained from the PAA–PEG/graphene conducting gel electrolyte. The conducting substances can form interconnected channels within the insulating microporous PAA–PEG matrix, therefore, the reduction reaction of triiodide ions in the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) can be extended from the Pt/gel electrolyte interface to both the interface and three-dimensional framework of the microporous conducting gel electrolyte. The resulting DSSCs made from PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, and PAA–PEG/graphite exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 7.74%, 6.49%, and 5.63%, respectively, which are much higher than 5.02% exhibited by a pure PAA–PEG-based DSSC. This new concept, along with ease of fabrication suggests that microporous conducting gel electrolytes could be good alternative electrolytes for use in efficient quasi-solid-state DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising solution to energy depletion, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. They are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy into electric energy possessing relatively high efficiency, low fabrication costs, environmentally friendly operation, and scalable components.1–6 As a core component, a liquid electrolyte composed of I−/I3− redox couples is a medium used to return excited dye molecules to their base state before being reduced by the counter electrode.7 Owing to the rapid ionic transfer kinetics and high conductivity of the liquid electrolyte, organic dyes can be quickly reduced and participate in another cycle. The main drawbacks of a liquid electrolyte are leakage and the evaporation of organic solvent.8,9 Generally, nitriles are employed to dissolve the liquid electrolyte, however, the ease of evaporation of the organic solvent results in a loss of the medium used for ionic transport. Therefore, the recovery of dye and iodides can be blocked due to a significantly increased electrical resistance. In contrast, full-solid-state electrolytes have good stability, but there is relatively low carrier transport in inorganic electrolytes (hole diffusion) or polymer electrolytes (movement of chain segments), which can not provide rapid redox kinetics.10,11 By addressing these issues, polymer gel electrolytes have been employed as replacements for liquid electrolytes.12–15
There are two approaches for designing gel electrolytes: (i) the gelation of polymer–polymer composite matrix in a liquid electrolyte,16 or (ii) imbibition of a liquid electrolyte with a three-dimensional (3D) amphiphilic gel matrix.17 Wu et al. previously reported the gelation of a polymer blend composed of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a liquid electrolyte,16 which led to the bonding of I2 in PVP and loading of I− in PEG. Recently, Chen and coworkers developed a new in situ gelation technique involving a high-temperature process and a gelator.18 Although the leakage of redox couples and the evaporation of organic solvent can be overcome, the main problem with gel electrolytes is the low redox couple loading in the matrices, which results in unsatisfactory power conversion efficiency (∼5%). The 3D gel matrices provide interconnected frameworks, in which the liquid electrolyte is sealed. The movement of the imbibed liquid electrolyte in the gel electrolyte is similar to that of the liquid electrolyte. Therefore, polymer gel electrolytes combine the rapid ionic transfer of liquid electrolytes and the relatively high stability of full-solid-state electrolytes. Polymer gel electrolytes composed of amphiphilic gel matrices have been demonstrated by Wu et al., yielding an overall power conversion efficiency of 3.5–5%.19,20 Compared to the Pt counter electrode/liquid electrolyte interface, the Pt counter electrode/gel electrolyte interface has an elevated resistance towards the electrocatalytic reaction of triiodide ions with refluxed electrons because of the poor contact between the polymer gel electrolyte and the solid-state Pt counter electrode. In our previous research,21–25 we developed the concept of extending the electrocatalytic reaction of triiodides from the electrolyte/counter electrode interface to both the interface and the 3D framework of the conducting gel electrolyte, in which the monomers of the conducting polymers (such as aniline and pyrrole) are imbibed and in situ polymerized in the matrix. The power conversion efficiency was significantly enhanced from ∼5.5% to ∼7.0%. For example, we recently designed a polyaniline integrated poly(hexamethylene diisocyanate tripolymer/polyethylene glycol) [poly(HDT/PEG)] gel electrolyte by imbibing aniline monomers into a 3D framework of poly(HDT/PEG), which was achieved due to the absorbing performance of the amphiphilic poly(HDT/PEG) toward aniline monomers.21 Using an initiator the aniline monomers were polymerized in situ into electrically conducting polyaniline. The polyaniline conducts refluxed electrons from the Pt counter electrode to the 3D framework of the polyaniline integrated poly(HDT/PEG), which leads to an extension of the electrocatalytic reaction of triiodides from the counter electrode/electrolyte interface to both the interface and the 3D framework of the conducting gel electrolyte. Considering that the electrocatalytic performance of carbon materials is better than conducting polymers, we aimed to further improve the photovoltaic performance of quasi-solid-state DSSCs by fabricating carbon material incorporated polymer gel electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the employment of conducting gel electrolytes containing carbon materials such as graphene, graphene oxide, and graphite for use in quasi-solid-state DSSCs.
It is well known that ionic conductivity is a key parameter effecting the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs and is highly dependent on the liquid electrolyte content of the matrix per unit volume. However, the loading of the liquid electrolyte in the 3D gel matrix is controlled by the osmotic pressure that is present across the gel matrix. Herein, we report the design of conducting gel electrolytes composed of graphene, graphene oxide or graphite incorporated microporous polyacrylate–poly(ethylene glycol) (PAA–PEG) and the employment of these electrolyte in efficient quasi-solid-state DSSCs. The loading of liquid electrolyte into PAA–PEG is primarily driven by the osmotic pressure present across the gel matrix and capillary diffusion from micropores, resulting in an enhanced liquid electrolyte loading. An efficiency of 7.74% was measured for the PAA–PEG/graphene-based DSSC due to the interconnected conducting channels, which benefit from the rearrangement of graphene. To the best of our knowledge, a conversion efficiency of 7.74% is the highest recorded for a DSSC using 3D polymer gel electrolytes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of PAA–PEG membranes
The PAA–PEG membranes were synthesized using an aqueous polymerization route. In detail, a solution of acrylic acid monomer (AA, 8 ml, analytical reagent grade) and PEG (Mw = 20000, 4.4 g, analytical reagent grade) was made by agitating in deionized water (15 ml) in a water-bath at 80 °C. A crosslinker, N,N′-(methylene)bisacrylamide (NMBA, 0.008 g), and initiator, ammonium persulfate (APS, 0.225 g), were subsequently added to the above mixture with vigorous agitation. As the polymerization proceeded the viscosity gradually increased. Once the viscosity of the PAA–PEG reached approximately 180 mPa s−1, the reaction mixture was poured into a Petri dish and cooled to room temperature, resulting in the formation of a transparent elastic gel. The PAA–PEG membranes were then molded into φ 2.5 cm die. After rinsing with deionized water, the membranes were dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h.
2.2. Preparation of conducting gel electrolytes
Microporous PAA–PEG membranes were prepared by immersing the dried PAA–PEG membranes in deionized water for 72 h so that they reached their swelling equilibrium. The membranes were subsequently freeze-dried under vacuum at −60 °C over 72 h. Next, the membranes were immersed in a liquid electrolyte composed of a redox electrolyte and either graphene, graphene oxide or graphite for 10 days until they reached absorption equilibrium. The carbon content of each conducting substance was 1.33 g L−1. The redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM of NaI, 100 mM of KI, 100 mM of LiI, 50 mM of I2, and 500 mM of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 ml acetonitrile.
2.3. Assembly of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs
A layer of TiO2 nanocrystal anode film with a thickness of 10 μm and active area of 0.09 cm2 was prepared by coating colloidal TiO2 using a screen printing technique, which was followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 film was soaked in a 0.5 mM N719 [cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate), purchased from Dyesol LTD, Australia] ethanol solution for 24 h in order to uptake N719 dye for the fabrication of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode. Quasi-solid-state DSSCs with PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide or PAA–PEG/graphite gel electrolyte at imbibition equilibrium were fabricated by sandwiching a 1 mm thick slice of the gel electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Pt counter electrode.
2.4. Characterization
The morphology of the gel electrolyte was determined with a Zeiss Ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). To observe the internal 3D microstructure, the swollen gel electrolyte was cut into a ultrathin film, then loaded into a chamber at freezing temperature and under a high vacuum in order to remove the solvent. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). The ionic conductivity of the gel-electrolyte was measured using a pocket conductivity meter (DSSJ-308A, LeiCi Instruments). The instrument was calibrated with 0.01 M KCl aqueous solution prior to taking measurements. Tafel polarization curves of symmetrical cells fabricated from the samples were measured using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. Symmetrical dummy cells were fabricated using two identical Pt electrodes (Pt electrode/gel electrolyte/Pt electrode). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation at a constant temperature of 20 °C with an ac signal amplitude of 20 mV in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz at 0 V dc bias in the dark. Cyclic voltammetry was also carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a N2-purged liquid electrolyte, where the gel electrolyte was used as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M LiClO4, whereas the redox couple used was 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2.
2.5. Photovoltaic measurements
Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled QS-DSSCs were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E) under irradiation with simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon–mercury arc lamp (CHF-XM-500 W, Beijing Trusttech Co., Ltd) under an ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was calibrated using a FZ-A type radiometer from the Beijing Normal University Photoelectric Instrument Factory in order to maintain it at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). Each DSSC device was measured five times in order to eliminate experimental error and a J–V curve with an average power conversion efficiency was employed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis
The synthesis of a PAA–PEG matrix is a simple process as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The polymerization reaction used to form PAA–PEG is an example of a free radical polymerization,26 in which each peroxide bond (–O–O–) in APS is cleaved into two SO4˙− radical anions. These radical anions react with H2O molecules to form hydroxyl radicals, which serve as the initiator for the reaction of AA and lead to a 3D PAA framework because of the macrobiradical nature of NMBA. The resultant PAA–PEG is believed to be a semi-interpenetrated polymer network (semi-IPN), constructed using H-bonding interactions. Generally, the molecular chains shrink in the dried state, whereas they stretch in the liquid electrolyte with expansion in the volume. Incorporation of PAA into PEG forms H-bonding interactions between CO (PAA) and –OH (PEG), and between –OH (PAA) and –O– (PEG), resulting in the a partial loss of hydrophilicity and the appearance of amphiphilicity.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the polymerization of the PAA–PEG matrix. 
The imbibition of the liquid electrolyte into the microporous PAA–PEG semi-IPN is primarily driven by both the osmotic pressure across the membrane and capillary forces in the micropores.27 The swelling of PAA–PEG semi-IPN in liquid electrolyte reaches equilibrium when the values of expansibility and contractility of PAA–PEG are equal (i.e., the osmotic pressure across the membrane is zero). Due to the nature of interconnected framework, nanoscale graphene, graphene oxide, or graphite can also diffuse into the PAA–PEG matrix, forming conducting gel electrolytes. A cross-sectional SEM image of the PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix is shown in Fig. 2, which suggests the formation of a highly interconnected and microporous framework capable of caging enormous amounts of liquid electrolyte in the microporous structure.
 Fig. 2  An SEM image of the microporous PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix. 
The FTIR spectra of PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, PAA–PEG/graphite, and the PAA–PEG matrix are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption bands at 1663, 1510, 1461, and 1106 cm−1 in the pure PAA–PEG matrix originate from the vibrations of CO (stretching, PAA), CO (bending, PAA), O–H (distorting, PAA), and C–O–C (stretching, PEG), respectively.28,29 However, these bands shift to 1692, 1504, 1443, and 1119 cm−1, respectively, in the conducting gel electrolytes. This change in the absorption bands suggest that there are H-bonding interactions between the PAA framework and PEG backbone.

3.2. Liquid electrolyte loading
The imbibition kinetics of the microporous PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix in various liquid electrolytes, shown in Fig. 4, mainly follow Flory’s theory and are due to the osmotic pressure across the membranes and capillary forces in the micropores. The liquid electrolyte loading increases with increasing imbibition time, which is an indication of the diffusion of the liquid electrolyte into the PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix. An absorption equilibrium is reached at a swelling time of around 30 h, and no further diffusion occurs under longer immersion times. In order to determine the extent of liquid electrolyte loading in PAA–PEG, the accumulative H3PO4 loading over time has been fitted using Fickian theory.30 (1)where Mt and M∞ are the mass of the imbibed liquid electrolyte at time t and at equilibrium, respectively. K is a characteristic rate constant relating to the properties of the PAA–PEG matrix, and n is a transport number characterizing the transport mechanism. A value of n ≤ 0.5 suggests a Fickian or case I transport behavior in which PAA–PEG relaxation is much faster than the diffusion; n = 1 indicates a non-Fickian or case II mode of transport, where the liquid electrolyte uptake is controlled by a diffusion process. A value of 0.5 < n < 1 refers to an anomalous or case III mode, in which the rate of structural relaxation is comparable to diffusion. By plotting log(Mt/M∞) vs. log(t), the n values could be recorded and are shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The n values obtained from the PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix swollen in various liquid electrolytes are higher than 0.5, indicating an anomalous mechanism mode in which the structural relaxation is comparable to the rate of diffusion. This result indicates that the loading of liquid electrolyte is mainly controlled by osmotic pressure. It is found that PAA–PEG/graphene has a liquid electrolyte loading of 21.1 g per g, which is much higher than 20.3, 14.7 and 12.7 g per g for PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, PAA–PEG/graphite, and PAA–PEG, respectively. A higher liquid electrolyte loading indicates a higher liquid electrolyte content per unit volume and enhanced ionic conductivity. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of PAA–PEG/graphene is 11.60 mS cm−1, which is the highest of the four gel electrolytes.

The insets show the imbibition kinetics of the various gel electrolytes. 
3.3. Ionic conductivity
Proton conductivity–temperature plots of the various gel electrolytes as well as the pure liquid electrolyte follow the Arrhenius relationship reasonably well, as shown in Fig. 5.31 It is worth mentioning that the activation energy (Ea) systematically decreases with the imbibition time of the liquid electrolyte. A low Ea value for a gel electrolyte indicates facile ionic transport along the conducting channels. It is reasonable to assume that the conducting channels will tend to be interconnected at higher aging times because of the gradual diffusion and rearrangement of the ionic liquid within the PAA–PEG semi-IPN matrix. Therefore, the interconnected pore structure of PAA–PEG semi-IPN provides a superhighway for efficient ion transport. Moreover, the Ea values obtained from PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, and PAA–PEG/graphite are much lower than that of the pure PAA–PEG gel electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5, the ionic conductivities of the different gel electrolytes at 60 °C are 16.85 mS cm−1 (PAA–PEG/graphene), 16.24 mS cm−1 (PAA–PEG/graphene oxide), 15.98 mS cm−1 (PAA–PEG/graphite), and 15.34 mS cm−1 (PAA–PEG). The decreased Ea and increased ionic conductivity are expected to significantly enhance the reaction kinetics of DSSCs.

3.4. Electrochemical characterization

Fig. 6 shows CV curves recorded using a gel electrolyte as the working electrode and a liquid electrolyte as the supporting electrolyte. No redox peaks are observed using the PAA–PEG gel electrolyte as the working electrode, indicating that PAA–PEG exhibits no electrocatalytic activity towards the I−/I3− couples. However, a pair of redox peaks are observed using the PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide and PAA–PEG/graphite gel electrolytes, suggesting that the conducting gel electrolytes have a similar electrocatalytic activity to the counter electrode.32,33 We can conclude that the integration of graphene, graphene oxide, and graphite has a promotional effect that enhances the electrocatalytic activity due to an increase in the quantity of active sites for the electroreduction reaction, when these materials are used as non-Pt counter electrodes. In order to reveal the interconnected conducting channels of graphene, graphene oxide, or graphite, a gel material incorporating sericite nanoparticles was synthesized and photographed using a polarizing microscope. As shown in inset of Fig. 6, the sericite nanoparticles form interconnected light channels within the gel framework. The incorporated graphene, graphene oxide, and graphite are also believed to form similar interconnected pathways, which can conduct refluxed electrons from the Pt counter electrode to the whole 3D conducting gel electrolyte. Therefore, the electrocatalytic reaction of iodides can be extended from the gel electrolyte/Pt interface to both the interface and the 3D conducting gel electrolyte.

EIS has been widely employed to test the electrocatalytic activity for the regeneration of a redox couple by assembling an asymmetric sandwich cell composed of a gel electrolyte between two FTO supported Pt glass electrodes. As shown in Fig. 7a, the charge transfer resistance values (Rct, the first semicircle) of the conducting gel electrolytes are much lower than that of PAA–PEG. A lower Rct indicates that the charge-transfer ability at the conducting gel electrolyte/Pt interface is higher than at the PAA–PEG/Pt interface. The rapid transport of refluxed electrons from the Pt counter electrode to the gel electrolyte is expected to accelerate the reduction reaction of iodides.33
 Fig. 7  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Tafel polarization curves of the PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, PAA–PEG/graphite, and PAA–PEG gel electrolytes. 
Tafel polarization plots were also recorded to determine the electrocatalytic activity of the gel electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 7b. These measurements were also performed using asymmetric cells similar to those used for the EIS measurements. A larger slope in the anodic or cathodic branch indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) and better electrocatalytic activity toward redox couples in the gel electrolytes. It is obvious that the J0 values are in the order PAA–PEG/graphene > PAA–PEG/graphene oxide > PAA–PEG/graphite > PAA–PEG, which is consistent with Rct in the EIS spectra.
3.5. Photovoltaic performance
The J–V characteristics of quasi-solid-state DSSCs made from PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide, PAA–PEG/graphite, and PAA–PEG gel electrolytes are presented in Fig. 8 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. An efficiency of 5.02% was recorded for the PAA–PEG gel electrolyte under solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, which is in the level commonly used in the literature.34,35 However, the efficiency was significantly enhanced by incorporating graphene, graphene oxide, or graphite into the PAA–PEG matrix, and an efficiency of 7.74% was recorded for the DSSC made using the PAA–PEG/graphene gel electrolyte. As mentioned above, the combination of graphene, graphene oxide, or graphite with PAA–PEG matrix is expected to accelerate the recovery of the redox couples and dyes, resulting in an elevation of the photocurrent. In addition, the electrocatalytic activity of the conducting gel electrolytes toward the I−/I3− redox couple in the 3D framework of the gel electrolyte decreases the overpotential and enhances Voc. Therefore, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs with the conducting gel electrolytes demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusions
Conducting gel electrolytes composed of PAA–PEG/graphene, PAA–PEG/graphene oxide and PAA–PEG/graphite have been synthesized using the microporous structure and imbibition capacity of the amphiphilic PAA–PEG matrix to contain various liquid electrolytes. The electrical and electrochemical characterization indicated that the ionic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity towards iodides have been both significantly enhanced. The electrocatalytic reaction of the iodides was also extended from the gel electrolyte/Pt interface to both the interface and 3D framework of the conducting gel electrolyte. The highest power conversion efficiency of 7.74% was obtained from the DSSC using the PAA–PEG/graphene gel electrolyte, while only 5.02% was obtained from pure PAA–PEG. This research opens a gateway to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs and highlights competitiveness of quasi-solid-state DSSCs among photovoltaic devices.
