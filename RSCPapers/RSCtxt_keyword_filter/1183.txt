    , Accepted 19th July 2014First published on 22nd July 2014AbstractThe purpose of this work is to study the impact of moiety sequence in the chemical structure of small molecular photovoltaic materials on their basic properties and photovoltaic performance. For this aim, two isomeric compounds, namely BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2, have been designed and synthesized by exchanging benzothiadiazole and thiophene positions with a structural variation. As compared with BDT(BTTh2)2, BDT(ThBTTh)2 possesses a lower melting point, a blue-shifted absorption spectrum in solution, and slightly lower-lying highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. More interestingly, the hole mobility of the BDT(ThBTTh)2 neat film is 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is three-orders of magnitude larger than that of BDT(BTTh2)2. Furthermore, these two compounds display significantly different photovoltaic performance, 4.53% for BDT(ThBTTh)2versus 1.58% for BDT(BTTh2)2 in terms of their power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention for their advantages of low cost, flexibility, light weight and easy fabrication.1 Conjugated polymers, especially the donor–acceptor (D–A) type, are one of the promising donor materials for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs.1,2 Recently, with the rapid development of high performance D–A conjugated polymers, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single module OSC device has exceeded 8%,3 while that of a tandem model is over 10%.4 However, because polymers are mixtures of homologues, they always have issues with average molecular weight and polydispersity. It has been demonstrated that molecular weight has a significant impact on the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers. Therefore, conjugated polymer photovoltaic materials generally suffer from property variations batch-by-batch. In addition to conjugated polymers, small molecular compounds with effective light harvesting in the visible and near infrared region have also been applied as donor materials for BHJ OSCs.5 Compared to polymers, small molecular materials can avoid batch-dependent problems because of their definite chemical structures and high purity achievable by several purification techniques. To date, a variety of solution-processable small molecules with different structures, including linear, star-like, and hyperbranched type, have been reported.5 However, only a few studies showed comparable photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers.6–8 These included a series of molecular photovoltaic compounds, developed by Chen and his coworkers.6 A PCE of up to 8.12% has been achieved with a compound using thienyl benzodithiophene (BDT) as a core and 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal group.6c Bazan and Heeger, et al. reported DTS(PTTh2)27 and DTS(FBTTh2)28 using dithienosilole (DTS) as a donor core with [1,2,5]-thiadiazolo-[3,4-c]-pyridine or fluorobenzothiadiazole as arms, both showing promising photovoltaic performance with a PCE of up to 9.02%.8b Although there are numerous studies trying to disclose the structure–property relationships for molecular photovoltaic materials,5 it is still difficult to answer how to design a compound that would achieve high performance. We observed that most studies endeavoured to investigate the impact of different optoelectronic moieties and their combination, as well as side chain engineering. Less attention was paid on the influence of moiety sequence. In this work, we report two isomeric compounds, BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 (Fig. 1). They are composed of one benzodithiophene (BDT), two benzothiadiazole (BT) and four thiophene (Th) units but have different moiety sequence. Interestingly, these two compounds exhibited completely different photovoltaic performance. A PCE of 4.5% was achieved for BDT(ThBTTh)2-based OSC devices, while those based on BDT(BTTh2)2 only displayed a PCE of 1.6%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The syntheses of BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 are outlined in Scheme 1. One of the key steps for both the compounds is the mono Suzuki coupling of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. For this reaction, an excess amount of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole was used to afford compound 3 in a yield of 70% and 48% for compound 5. Stille coupling was applied for the final step for both BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2. The molar ratio of the brominated starting material (compound 3 or 5) and 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexoxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′](dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bistrimethylstannane was 2.5:1. BDT(ThBTTh)2 was obtained in a yield of 58%, while BDT(BTTh2)2 was obtained in a yield of 91%. Because of their large rigid rod-like structures and small side chains, these two compounds did not display good solubility at room temperature with only limited solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, toluene, etc. However, their solubility could be increased over 15 mg mL−1 in slightly heated solutions, which ensured processing feasibility for both the compounds.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed good thermal stabilities for both the compounds with a 5%-weight loss temperature (Td) of 335.2 °C for BDT(ThBTTh)2 and 340.4 °C for BDT(BTTh2)2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile, BDT(ThBTTh)2 displayed a sharp endothermic peak at 202.5 °C and a sharp exothermic peak at 192.8 °C in the second heating–cooling cycle (Fig. S2, ESI†). These peaks are attributed to melting and crystallizing phase transitions, respectively, which was confirmed by polarized optical microscopy. In addition to these peaks, a pair of broad thermal transitions around 145 °C were also observed in the DSC profile of BDT(ThBTTh)2. These may originate from certain solid-to-solid transitions. In comparison, BDT(BTTh2)2 exhibited melting and crystallizing phase transition at 213.8 and 204.4 °C, both are higher than those of BDT(ThBTTh)2. This fact suggests that the isomer BDT(BTTh2)2 has stronger intermolecular interactions than BDT(ThBTTh)2.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2a displays the absorption spectra of these two compounds in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M, and the corresponding absorption peaks and molar extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 1. BDT(BTTh2)2 clearly showed two main absorption bands centred at 368 and 569 nm. The latter is assignable to the absorption band originating from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between electron-deficient BT units and electron-rich BDT and thiophene units, while the former may be due to local π–π* transition of the conjugated core. In comparison, the ICT absorption band of BDT(ThBTTh)2 appeared at 526 nm, which is 43 nm blue-shifted compared to that of BDT(BTTh2)2. The molar extinction coefficient of this band was estimated to be 6.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is slightly larger than that for BDT(BTTh2)2 (5.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1). In addition to the ICT band, the absorption spectrum of BDT(ThBTTh)2 displayed two additional peaks at 314 and 398 nm in the range of 300–650 nm. The nature of the latter would be the same as the peak at 368 nm in the BDT(BTTh2)2 spectrum; however, their maximum wavelengths have a difference of 30 nm. Obviously, all the abovementioned spectral differences in solution are because of the structural variations between BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2, in which BT and one thiophene unit exchanged their positions.

In the film state, the ICT band of BDT(ThBTTh)2 appeared at 596 nm, which is 70 nm red-shifted from that in the chlorobenzene solution (Fig. 2b). However, in the case of BDT(BTTh2)2 film, there were two apexes at 573 and 615 nm for this band, which were 4 and 46 nm red-shifted from its ICT peak in solution, respectively. Although they had different apexes, it should be noticed that these film ICT bands of both the compounds completely covered the same spectral region and had a superimposed shape, except for the apexes. The onset absorption sites for both the films were estimated to be 700 nm, giving an optical energy gap (Eg,opt) of 1.77 eV for both BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2.
The electrochemical properties of BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S3, ESI†) with film samples cast from their chlorobenzene solutions onto glassy carbon electrodes. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) vs. Ag/Ag+ were measured to be 0.52 V for BDT(ThBTTh)2 and 0.46 V for BDT(BTTh2)2 (Table 1). Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), which has a standard energy level of −4.8 eV from vacuum,9 was used as an internal reference and determined to be 0.15 V vs. Ag/Ag+ under the same conditions. Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level can be calculated by the equation of HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.65), giving −5.17 eV for BDT(ThBTTh)2 and −5.11 eV for BDT(BTTh2)2. The former is slightly lower than the latter, which may be good for its photovoltaic performance. Calculated from the HOMO value and Eg,opt, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated to be −3.40 eV for BDT(ThBTTh)2 and −3.34 eV for BDT(BTTh2)2.
Theoretical study
To gain insight into the fundamental structural and electronic properties of BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2, density functional theory (DFT) study was performed at B3LYP/6-311+G**//B3LYP/6-31G* level10 using the GAUSSIAN03 program package.11 To simplify the calculations, methyl groups were used to replace all the alkyl side chains in the model compounds. The optimized molecular geometries are displayed in Fig. 3. It is clear that the exchange of BT and thiophene units affords different molecular geometries. Compound BDT(BTTh2)2 possesses a long and straightforward linear central part, which is composed of one BDT and two BT units. The directions of two thienyl units at both the ends begin to deviate from the central line of the molecule. In contrast, the insertion of a thienyl unit between BT and BDT in BDT(ThBTTh)2 results in a more zigzag-like molecular shape. Although both the compounds exhibit a good planar structure for π-conjugation, there are subtle differences in dihedral angles among the moieties. For BDT(ThBTTh)2, three dihedral angles from central BDT to the end thienyl unit are 1.6, 1.4, and 0.2°, respectively, whereas these angles are 3.6, 1.5, and 10.0°, respectively, for BDT(BTTh2)2 and are larger than those of BDT(ThBTTh)2. Different molecular geometry and shape may affect molecular packing structure in the solid state, and then influence their properties.

Fig. 3 also shows the electron wave functions of the HOMO and LUMO. For the HOMO, electron clearly delocalizes throughout the entire molecular structure, suggesting a good π-electron conjugation for both the compounds. However for the LUMO, electron density mainly resides on the BT units, confirming that these two compounds are typical D–A type. In addition to the BT units, electron density of the LUMO is partially distributed on the central BDT unit for BDT(BTTh2)2. While in the case of BDT(ThBTTh)2, partial electron density of the LUMO is on thienyl units and not central BDT. This subtle difference may influence the LUMO energy level of the compound. Therefore, the calculated LUMO energy level is −3.078 eV for BDT(ThBTTh)2, which is slightly higher from that for BDT(BTTh2)2 (−3.144 eV). With the calculated HOMO energy level (BDT(ThBTTh)2: −5.169 eV, BDT(BTTh2)2: −5.171 eV), the theoretical energy gap is 2.03 eV for BDT(ThBTTh)2, while 2.09 eV for BDT(BTTh2)2.
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 was investigated using bulk heterojunction devices with a structural configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layer was fabricated by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution containing compound BDT(ThBTTh)2 or BDT(BTTh2)2, and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). For both the BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 devices, the weight ratio of the checked compound to PC61BM, the concentration of the processing solution, and annealing temperature were optimized and found to be 1/1, 30 mg L−1 and 120 °C, respectively. The current density–voltage curves of their best devices are displayed in Fig. 4a, while the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, the optimized BDT(ThBTTh)2-based device displayed a significantly better performance than that based on BDT(BTTh2)2. The former device showed an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.33 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.5%, giving a PCE of 4.53%. Whereas for the latter, these parameters changed to 0.82 V, 4.74 mA cm−2 and 40.5%, respectively, giving a PCE of 1.58%. Considering the fact that BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 are isomers with a structural variation only in the sequence of BT and thiophene units, the observed large difference in photovoltaic performance is amazing.

Obviously, the performance improvement for the BDT(ThBTTh)2 cell as referred to that based on BDT(BTTh2)2 mainly came from the enhancement in JSC and FF parameters. For JSC, the enhancement reached as high as 97%. To further understand this improvement, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectroscopy was performed on the abovementioned optimized cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE spectra reveals a completely similar photo-response spectral range from 300 to 700 nm for both the cells. This is well consistent with the observation in the film absorption spectroscopy, in which BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 displayed the same spectral coverage. However, EQE values in the range of 350–600 nm were 50–60% for BDT(ThBTTh)2 cell, which are significantly larger than those for BDT(BTTh2)2 cell (mostly in the range of 15–30%).
Hole mobility, film structure and morphology
To determine the origin of the observed photovoltaic performance differences between BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2, we carried out more detailed investigations on their charge mobility, structure and the morphology of their neat and blend films with PC61BM. Charge mobility is one of the main factors that determines the material photovoltaic performance, mainly in JSC and FF parameters.12 The hole mobilities of these two compounds in the neat film were measured by organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices with the structural configuration of a bottom gate top contact. The devices were fabricated on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified Si/SiO2 plates and using Au as source and drive electrodes. Both these compounds displayed typical p-channel charge transportation characteristics (Fig. S5, ESI†). Estimated from the saturated regime, the hole mobility was estimated to be 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDT(ThBTTh)2, while 2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDT(BTTh2)2 (Table 2). The former is almost three-orders of magnitude higher than the latter. Because OFETs with neat film samples cannot reflect real charge transportation for the OSC devices, the hole mobility in the blend films composed of the checked compound and PC61BM in 1/1 (w/w) ratio, which is similar to the active layer of the optimized OSC devices, was measured by a space charge-limited current method (SCLC) with a hole-only structural configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/Au under various film thicknesses (Fig. S6, ESI†). By this, the BDT(ThBTTh)2-based blend film gave a hole mobility of 4.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a thickness of 110 nm, while 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 95 nm thickness (Table 2). In comparison, the hole mobilities of BDT(BTTh2)2-based blend films were 0.69 × 10−4 and 0.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under the film thicknesses of 100 and 70 nm, respectively. These results indicate that the former possesses larger hole mobility than the latter. Therefore, there is no doubt that the higher charge mobility observed for BDT(ThBTTh)2 either in a neat or blend film is a key factor for its higher OSC performance.
In addition to charge mobility, film structure and morphology also have significant influences in device performance. In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments, the BDT(ThBTTh)2 pristine film displayed two sharp diffraction peaks at 4.6 and 6.1°, together with a couple of weak peaks around 8.6, 13.8, and 18.5° (Fig. 5). The d-spacings for these peaks, except for the one at 6.1°, are 1.92, 1.02, 0.64, and 0.48 nm assigned to the 001, 002, 003 and 004 diffraction from a lamellar structure, respectively. The d-spacing for the diffraction peak of 6.1° is 1.46 nm, which is half of its molecular length (ca. 3.0 nm estimated by DFT geometry optimization). This may suggest that the molecules of BDT(ThBTTh)2 adopts a half-interdigitated configuration along the molecular length direction. In comparison, the pristine film of BDT(BTTh2)2 also showed sharp diffraction peaks at 4.4, 4.7, 5.6 and 7.2° with the d-spacings of 2.01, 1.89, 1.56 and 1.23 nm, respectively. Because no higher diffraction peak was observed, the assigning of these peaks and the structure of the BDT(BTTh2)2 neat film are not clear at present. These observations clearly indicate that both BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 pristine films have an ordered crystalline structure but different lattice parameters. However, the situation changed when they were blended with PC61BM (1:1, w/w). In the case of the BDT(ThBTTh)2 blend film, the same series of diffraction peaks at 4.6, 6.1, 9.2, 13.9 and 18.5° were observed. This suggests that BDT(ThBTTh)2 retained the same crystalline structure even in the presence of PC61BM. In sharp contrast, no clear XRD peak was observed for the blend film composed of BDT(BTTh2)2 and PC61BM. This result indicates that BDT(BTTh2)2 changed to an amorphous structure, possibly due to the interference from PC61BM.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of BDT(ThBTTh)2 and BDT(BTTh2)2 in neat films and blend films with PC61BM (1:1, w/w). 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed a microphase separation morphology for both the blend films (Fig. 6). The domain size was estimated to be tens to hundreds of nm for the BDT(ThBTTh)2-based blend film, while it is several hundred nm for that based on BDT(BTTh2)2. Although both are not ideal, the observed domain size suggests that the former is more favourable for OSC applications than the latter. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was measured to be 2.3 nm for BDT(ThBTTh)2 blend film, while 2.0 nm for BDT(BTTh2)2 blend film. The roughness data are comparable and suggest it would not be an important contributor to their performance differences. It was reported that certain solvent additives, such as 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), improves the active layer morphology and thus enhances cell efficiency for either polymer- or small molecule-based OSCs.1,2,5 Therefore, we checked both DIO and PDMS as solvent additives with various concentrations but found no improvements in our cases (Table S1, ESI†).

Conclusions
In this study, we have revealed how large impacts on the basic properties and photovoltaic performance can be achieved by changing moiety sequence in the chemical structure of a small molecular photovoltaic material. As compared with the isomer BDT(BTTh2)2, BDT(ThBTTh)2 having a slightly structural variation in exchange of BT and thiophene positions displays a lower melting point, a blue-shifted absorption spectrum in solution, and a slightly low-lying HOMO. More importantly, BDT(ThBTTh)2 exhibits a significantly ordered crystalline structure, especially in the blend film with PC61BM, and possesses a considerably larger hole mobility. All these factors work together showing BDT(ThBTTh)2 a much better OSC performance. Throughout this study, one may understand the importance of moiety sequence to material photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the large performance difference between these two isomeric compounds proves a valid design strategy for high performance optoelectronic materials.

Synthesis

4-Bromo-7-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (compound 1). 
To a mixture of 2-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (529.2 mg, 1.8 mmol), 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (785.7 mg, 2.7 mmol), K2CO3 aqueous solution (2.0 M, 9.0 mL) and THF (36 mL), Pd(PPh3)4 (103.8 mg, 0.09 mmol) was added under Ar. After thoroughly degassing with three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 h under Ar.

Device fabrication and characterization. 
OSC device fabrication and characterization. 
The solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP. Al 4083) was spin-coated on the top of cleaned ITO glass at 6000 rpm and baked at 140 °C for 15 min, affording a thickness of 23 nm. Then, the substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove box. The active layer was spin-coated with warm chlorobenzene solutions containing the checked compounds and PC61BM (Lumitec LT-8905). If needed, the substrate was thermally annealed at desired temperature for 10 min. Finally, a layer of Ca (10 nm) and a layer of Al (100 nm) were subsequently deposited in vacuum at 10−5 mbar. The active area of all the devices was 7 mm2. Layer thickness was measured on a Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2420 source meter. Photocurrent was acquired upon irradiation using an AAA solar simulator (Oriel 94043A, 450 W) with AM 1.5G filter. Light intensity was adjusted to be 100 mW cm−2 using a NREL-certified standard silicon cell (Orial reference cell 91150). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was detected with a 75 W Xe lamp, an Oriel monochromator (74125), an optical chopper, a lock-in amplifier, and a NREL-calibrated crystalline silicon cell.
SCLC device fabrication and characterization. 
The hole mobility for the blended films of the checked compounds with PC61BM in a weight ratio of 1:1 was measured using hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The devices were fabricated following the same methods and conditions used for OSCs, except for the final metal layer. In these devices, a layer of Au (100 nm) deposited in vacuum of 10−5 mbar was applied as the top electrode. According to the Mott–Gurney law, the SCLC theory can be described as.  J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μh is the hole mobility, d is the thickness of active layer, Va is the applied voltage and Vbi is the built-in voltage.17
OFET device fabrication and characterization. 
For OFET devices, doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer of 300 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2 was used as the gate electrode and dielectric layer. Thin films were deposited on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating with the solutions of BDT(ThBTTh)2 (10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and BDT(BTTh2)2 (10 mg mL−1 in CHCl3). Then, gold source and drain contacts (50 nm in thickness) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the top of the active layer through a shadow mask, affording a bottom-gate top-contact device configuration. The ratio between channel length (L) and width (W) was 8.95. Electrical measurements of OFET devices were carried out at room temperature in air using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer. Field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the equation IDS = (μWCi/2L)(VG − VT)2, where IDS is the drain–source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, VG is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold voltage.
