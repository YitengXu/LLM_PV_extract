PEDOT films were synthesized in a three-electrode system with a direct-current power supply to control the polymerization process, leading to a simplification of the electrochemical polymerization procedure. The morphology of PEDOT can be represented as a micro-sphere with three-dimensional network-like structures aggregated with plenty of nanoparticles. The polymerization voltage, polymerization time and the concentration of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) exhibited a significant influence on the photovoltaic characteristics of PEDOT films. Impressively, the DSSCs with optimum PEDOT films as counter electrodes (CEs) reached the highest power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.401%, which was comparable to that of a cell with platinum (Pt) CEs (6.493%). After modification by reduced graphene oxide (rGO), DSSCs equipped with PEDOT/rGO CEs reached an η of 7.115%, with an enhancement of 9.58% compared to that of Pt CEs. Thus, the rGO-coated network-like PEDOT can be considered as an economical alternative component to expensive Pt electrodes.
1. Introduction
Since a great improvement in η of DSSCs in 1991,1 they have attracted much attention due to their remarkable lifetime, low-cost fabrication, relatively high energy conversion efficiency and environmental friendliness.2–4 As an indispensable component of DSSCs, CEs perform two crucial functions: collect and transport the electrons; and absorb and catalyze the redox couple. Therefore, outstanding CEs must meet prominent electrical conductivity and very good catalytic activity requirements simultaneously.5,6 Pt is a widely used CE material because of its superior electrocatalytic activity.7 However, scarcity and corrosion by I3−/I− redox couple electrolyte, as disadvantages of Pt, have hindered further development of DSSCs.5,8 In view of this, many promising alternatives to Pt have emerged in response to the development of DSSCs, such as carbon materials,9–12 metal oxides and metal sulfides,13–15 transition metal carbides and nitrides,16,17 conducting polymers,18,19etc. Among these materials, conducting polymers show promise as alternatives to Pt-free CEs in DSSCs for their high electronic transmission rate, outstanding catalytic activity and low-cost production.20
As a conducting polymer, PEDOT has attracted considerable attention due to its low cost, high electrochemical activity, environmental friendliness, and permanent stability.21,22 Accordingly, PEDOT films are much polymerized from EDOT monomers via oxidative polymerization or electrochemical polymerization methods. In the case of oxidative polymerization, EDOT monomers are polymerized to PEDOT films with various materials as oxidant, such as MoCl5 vapor,23 I2 vapor,21 (NH4)2S2O8,24 Fe(ClO4)3,25 and FeCl3.26 The conductivity of PEDOT films can be reduced by the reaction initiators and oxidants involved in the polymerization process.27 In the electrochemical polymerization technique, PEDOT films are produced under constant voltage22 or constant current conditions.28,29 The as-prepared PEDOT films have excellent photovoltaic properties which can be considered as alternative CEs to Pt electrodes. However, this technique depends on high-precision equipment, such as an electrochemical workstation, which increases the fabrication cost of PEDOT films.
Herein, we established a simple method to prepare PEDOT films via changing the polymerization voltage. PEDOT films with very good photovoltaic characteristics were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a direct-current power supply rather than an electrochemical workstation, making the polymerization process low cost and simple. The as-prepared PEDOT films were used as CEs for DSSCs, and photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on various PEDOT films prepared using different preparation parameters were explored in detail. Moreover, rGO was spun-coated on the PEDOT films to increase their conductivity, and the PEDOT/rGO film CE-based Pt-free DSSCs achieved an excellent η of 7.115% under 1 sun AM 1.5 G, which was even higher than that of DSSCs with standard Pt CEs (6.493%).
2. Experimental
Materials
EDOT (99%), titanium dioxide (TiO2, 99.8%), lithium perchlorate trihydrate (LiClO4·3H2O, 99.0%), iodine (I2, 99.8%), and lithium iodine (LiI, 99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin. Glacial acetic acid, acetonitrile, terpilenol, ethyl cellulose, acetone, and isopropanol were obtained from Sinopharm. cis-Diisothiocyanato-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) was obtained from Dyesol. liquid electrolyte containing LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.05 M), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 0.3 M), guanidinium isothiocyanate (GuSCN, 0.1 M), and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII, 0.80 M) was obtained from HeptaChroma. FTO (DHS-FTO22-15N-01-2.2 mm, 13 Ω sq−1) was obtained from NSG Japan. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from natural graphite by an improved Hummers' method and reduced to rGO by a hydrothermal method.
Fabrication of various CEs
Pt CEs were prepared by direct current sputtering of Pt thin film on an FTO substrate. PEDOT CEs were generated on FTO substrates which were cleaned by detergent solution, acetone, isopropanol, and absolute ethyl alcohol sequentially with ultrasonic-assisted extraction. The electrolyte containing 0.01 M EDOT was formulated with 0.0711 g EDOT, 0.8022 g LiClO4·3H2O and 50 mL acetonitrile. Afterwards, a three-electrode system was set up with PEDOT-coated FTO as working electrode, a Pt electrode as CE, an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode and a direct-current power supply. In the following step, a voltage of 1.1 V was first set for the system to trigger EDOT monomer to form EDOT dipolymer. After a period of time, the voltage was changed to polymerization voltage for different polymerization times, and then a sky-blue PEDOT thin film with high transmittance appeared on the FTO substrate. In the end, the PEDOT CE was obtained after a cleaning and drying procedure. rGO was spun-coated on a PEDOT film to form a PEDOT/rGO CE.
Preparation of DSSCs
Nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode was prepared using standard P25 paste, as was reported previously.30 Typically, the FTO substrate (1 × 1.5 cm) was washed using an ultrasonic bath in a detergent solution followed with distilled water and finally in absolute ethanol. The standard P25 paste was coated on the dried FTO by the doctor blade method, and then the FTO plate was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The treated photoanode was immersed into appropriate N719 dye solution (0.3 mM) for 24 h to absorb sufficient dye for light harvesting. The electrolyte solution was infiltrated between the sensitized photoanode and PEDOT CEs to assemble a sandwich-type DSSC device.
Characterization and measurement
The morphology of samples was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, SU8010). The crystalline structures were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS, D8 Focus). The polymer structures were investigated by μ-Raman spectroscopy using a 600 g mm−1 grating spectrometer (iHR550-Horiba Jobin Yvon). The electrocatalytic activity of the PEDOT films for the reduction of I3− was determined through cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., Shanghai, China) in an acetonitrile-based solution, with components of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4. In the three-electrode system, PEDOT films were used as the working electrodes, and a Pt slice and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the CEs and reference electrodes, respectively. The scanning rate for CV measurement was set at 10–50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation with an impedance analyzer (CHI660C Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., Shanghai, China) in a two-electrode configuration. Photovoltaic performance of the as-prepared DSSCs was determined by measuring photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves under a solar simulator (91160, Newport Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) at 100 mW cm−2 intensity. The J–V characteristic curves were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660C Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp., Shanghai, China) controlled by a computer. The active area of DSSCs was π × (0.5 cm)2.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology and the growth mechanism of the as-prepared PEDOT films are revealed in Fig. 1. A uniform PEDOT film consists of large amounts of sphere-like particles with almost the same size, as shown in Fig. 1a. The morphology of the particles is represented by three-dimension (3D) network-like structures (Fig. 1b) which were aggregated by large amounts of nanoparticles, suggesting sufficient electrochemical active areas. Fig. 1c reveals a cross-sectional image of a PEDOT film, which is located firmly on the surface of FTO with a thickness of about 2 μm. The growth mechanism of PEDOT films is shown in Fig. 1d. At the beginning, the EDOT monomers were absorbed on the surface of FTO and converted to EDOT+ with the polymerization voltage setting at 1.1 V. Then homogeneous EDOT dipolymer films formed on the surface of FTO after a certain period of polymerization time via coupling reaction. Afterwards, the polymerization voltage was changed to 20 V to supply enough driving force for the polymerization reaction. Induced by the voltage, the EDOT dipolymer lost an electron and formed cation radical. Finally, PEDOT films grew on the surface of FTO via radical polymerization.26,31

The XRD pattern of the PEDOT film is shown in Fig. S1a.† The broad diffraction peak at 25.6° can be assigned to the (020) reflection of the polymer backbone.26 Fig. S1b† shows the Raman spectrum of the PEDOT film. The absorption peak located at 1432 cm−1 possesses the highest intensity, which was attributed to the CC symmetric stretching vibration. The absorption peak at 1367 cm−1 is assigned to the Cα–Cα stretching vibration. Moreover, a band broadening attributed to CC reverse stretching vibration was also found at 1509 cm−1.
Film thickness of PEDOT CEs is one of the key factors for the photovoltaic efficiency, which is decided by polymerization voltage, polymerization time and the concentration of EDOT. Therefore, detailed work has been done concerning these parameters as described in the following. In Fig. 2, J–V curves of DSSCs with various PEDOT films prepared at different polymerization voltages as CEs are shown, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. When the polymerization voltage was set as 10 V, there was no current in the circuit and no PEDOT film appeared on the FTO surface, as no PEDOT macromolecule was formed at such a low voltage. The best performance (6.006%) was achieved for the device with PEDOT CEs prepared at 20 V, which had a Jsc of 14.086 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.711 V and a FF of 59.97%. However, as the polymerization voltage was increased further, the photocurrent trended to decrease. This is presumably because a higher polymerization voltage could promote the generation of PEDOT, and then a thick PEDOT film was formed, which led to an increase of the charge transfer resistance between the PEDOT film and the FTO substrate.

The influence of polymerization time on the photovoltaic properties of PEDOT films was also explored. The J–V curves of DSSCs coupled with various PEDOT CEs prepared using different polymerization times and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters were shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2 respectively. A great influence of polymerization time on the photovoltaic performance of PEDOT CEs can be clearly seen, especially for Jsc. The maximum performance was obtained for a polymerization time of 10 min, which resulted in a champion device exhibiting η of over 6%, Jsc of 14.086 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.711 V, and FF of 59.97% due to the optimized PEDOT film thickness.

As the constituent monomer of PEDOT, the concentration of EDOT is also one of the important impact factors for the photovoltaic performance of PEDOT films. The J–V curves of DSSCs based on PEDOT CEs prepared using different concentrations of EDOT are shown in Fig. 4, and the derived photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSSC based on PEDOT CE prepared using 0.005 M has a low efficiency of 1.31% (Jsc of 3.986 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.618 V, and FF of 53.26%). Notably, Jsc is improved obviously with an increase of the concentration of EDOT due to large number of catalytic sites and decreased conductive resistance. However, if the concentration was too high, too thick a film was formed and poor adhesion with FTO was induced, which resulted in high interface transfer resistance. As a result, the device gives the optimal η of 6.401% when the monomer concentration is 0.02 M.

After the optimization of polymerization voltage, polymerization time and the concentration of EDOT, a maximum η of 6.401% is achieved, which is comparable to that of cells based on Pt CEs. The very good conductivity and huge surface area of rGO make it a good candidate for the CEs of DSSCs. In order to further enhance the efficiency of devices based on PEDOT CEs, PEDOT/rGO hybrid films were prepared.
The detailed experimental procedures for PEDOT/rGO films are given in ESI.† FESEM images (Fig. S2†) of PEDOT/rGO hybrid films show that the semi-transparent rGO is firmly coated onto the as-prepared PEDOT film, indicating the strong interface connection between rGO and PEDOT.
The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with PEDOT prepared under the optimal parameters, PEDOT/rGO and Pt as CEs are shown in Fig. 5a. The DSSC with Pt CEs shows an η of 6.493%, which is similar to that with PEDOT CEs (6.401%). The cell with PEDOT/rGO CEs shows the best performance with η of 7.115%, Voc of 0.753 V, Jsc of 17.553 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.83% due to the synergistic effects of PEDOT and rGO. The optimized PEDOT films were aggregated by large amounts of nanoparticles and presented a 3D network-like structure, which can provide sufficient electrochemically active sites for the reduction of I3−. Moreover, as CEs of DSSCs, PEDOT films also play a key role for electron transmission. Meanwhile highly conductive rGO is expected to provide great conductivity to the composite films, providing fast electron transmission rate and low charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface.
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves of DSSCs with various CEs. The inset summarizes the photovoltaic parameters: Voc (V), Jsc (mA cm−2), FF (%), η (%). (b) IPCE curves of DSSCs with various CEs. 

Fig. 5b shows the incident photon-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with various films as CEs measured in the range of wavelengths of 400–800 nm. It is worth nothing that by replacing the conventional Pt CEs with PEDOT/rGO CEs, enhanced IPCE was observed in the whole visible light region, signifying a more efficient and inexpensive CE material. The maximum IPCE values of the DSSCs with PEDOT.
PEDOT/rGO and Pt CEs are 67.87%, 86.60% and 72.88% at 540 nm, respectively. Moreover, the short-circuit current density (Jsc-IPCE) under monochromic light illumination can be calculated from the IPCE curves by eqn (1), and the corresponding values for the devices with PEDOT, PEDOT/rGO and Pt CEs are 12.059 mA cm−2, 15.387 mA cm−2, and 12.949 mA cm−2, respectively. The obtained Jsc-IPCE values calculated from IPCE curves (monochromatic spectrum) are in good agreement with the Jsc values from J–V curves (sunlight spectrum). (1)where λ is the wavelength of incident monochromatic light and Pin is the intensity of the incident light.
Cyclic voltammograms were utilized to investigate the catalytic activity of the CEs for the reduction of I3−. In the case of CV analysis, the major redox reactions involve the oxidation of I− (eqn (2)) and the reduction of I3− (eqn (3)), which correspond to the anodic and cathodic peak current densities (Jpc), respectively. 3I− → I3− + 2e−(2) I3− + 2e− → 3I−(3)
Since CEs are mainly used to trigger the reduction of I3−, a higher value of Jpc directly reflects a better electrocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6a, CV curves of various films were measured with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. The value of Jpc shown for the PEDOT-based electrode (1.454 mA cm−2) is close to that of the Pt electrode (1.570 mA cm−2), indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared PEDOT electrode for I3− reduction is similar to that of the Pt electrode. When the PEDOT was spun-coated with rGO, the hybrid film achieves the highest Jpc of 2.293 mA cm−2, suggesting the PEDOT/rGO hybrid film has better electrocatalytic activity than standard Pt CEs. CV curves of various films for 100 cycles are shown in Fig. S3,† which indicate the good stability of the CE films.
 Fig. 6  (a) Cyclic voltammograms and (b) EIS curves of various films. 
The impedance properties of different CEs were confirmed by EIS. Fig. 6b shows fitting EIS diagram of DSSCs with various CEs. The inset is the equivalent circuit model. As is known, the semicircle in the high-frequency range (over 1 kHz) depends on the charge transportation at the CEs.29 The intercept of the high-frequency semicircle with the horizontal axis represents the series resistance (Rs), the diameter of the high-frequency semicircle refers to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at the CE/electrolyte interface, the diameter of the middle frequency semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and the diameter of the low-frequency semicircle corresponds to the Warburg diffusion coefficient (Zw) between photoanode and CEs.32 The differences in the conductivity of the CEs and the adhesion between CEs and FTO substrates were regarded as the reasons for the variation of the Rs values, and the Rs values of DSSCs with PEDOT, PEDOT/rGO, and Pt as CEs are 25.14 Ω, 22.07 Ω, and 24.24 Ω, respectively. PEDOT/rGO CE has the lowest Rs value, which is mainly attributed to the high conductivity of rGO and good adhesion at the PEDOT/rGO-FTO interface. In the case of Rct1, the Rct1 value of the DSSC coupled with PEDOT/rGO film (9.22 Ω) is lower than that for the PEDOT film (15.71 Ω) and the standard Pt film (9.67 Ω), revealing a low charge transfer resistance at the interface between electrolyte and PEDOT/rGO.
For the PEDOT/rGO hybrid film, the rGO provides an extremely large number of electro-active sites for the I3− reduction and a higher conductivity for electron transmission of the CE, leading to the best conductivity (lowest Rs and Rct1) and electrocatalytic activity (largest Jpc) of the PEDOT/rGO films. As a result, the DSSCs with PEDOT/rGO CEs reached the highest Jsc, and thereby the highest η due to both the fast charge transfer rate and large number of electro-active sites.
4. Conclusion
PEDOT films with excellent photovoltaic performance have been synthesized using a facile three-electrode system with a direct-current power supply to control the polymerization process. The as-prepared PEDOT films possess high catalytic activity toward I3− reduction and low charge transfer resistance. The influence of preparation parameters on the photovoltaic properties of PEDOT was explored in detail, and the optimized device prepared at polymerization voltage of 20 V, polymerization time of 10 min, and concentration of EDOT of 0.02 M has η of 6.401%, which was comparable to that of DSSCs based on Pt electrodes (6.493%). After modification, DSSCs with PEDOT/rGO composite films as CEs exhibited 7.115% power conversion efficiency, with an enhancement of 9.58% compared to Pt CEs. The superior performance indicates that the PEDOT/rGO film is a promising alternative to expensive Pt CEs in DSSCs.
