, Accepted 6th July 2023First published on 6th July 2023AbstractIt has been hypothesized that a thermodynamically feasible Ag2Se monolayer could be a potential candidate for photocatalytic water splitting. However, the present electronic structure knowledge is insufficient for forecasting and confirming the ultimate criterion of photocatalysis. Its wide band gap of around 2.70 eV is also non-ideal for photovoltaic conversion. These challenges are addressed herein using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically probe the photocatalytic potential, light absorption coefficient, carrier mobility and carrier utilization efficiency of Ag2Se. To ascertain the spontaneity of the solar-to-hydrogen conversion, significant efforts have been made to calculate the energy barriers for the surface hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fascinatingly, upon −6% compressive biaxial straining, the Ag2Se monolayer ingeniously combines all the desired characteristics for photocatalytic water-splitting activity, including a broader sunlight absorption region (∼105 cm−1), enhanced carrier mobility (∼105 cm2 V−1 s−1) and spontaneous catalytic pathways with relatively low triggering external potential, while retaining a direct band gap, good thermal stability and perfect band edge position. The corrected STH efficiency of ∼10% suggests commercial hydrogen production. This work provides valuable insights into the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms in the strain-modulated Ag2Se monolayer.
1.0 Introduction
Energy shortages and contamination in the natural world necessitate the exploration of alternative and renewable energy sources. Green hydrogen energy, generated via photocatalytic water splitting, is the cleanest fuel possible, sourced from solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen energy has been looked at as a possible replacement for traditional fossil fuels. Finding an effective photocatalyst to catalyze the reaction between solar energy and hydrogen has been the primary obstacle to implementing solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion. The large charge transport distance in traditional 3D photocatalysts inevitably leads to high levels of electron–hole recombination.1 The limited reactive sites and poor surface-to-volume ratio of 3D phases are further obstacles to improving performance in water splitting.2 Therefore, creating cutting-edge 2D photocatalysts is a significantly preferable strategy for dealing with the undesirable problems seen in 3D structures. One widely adopted method is to construct a heterostructure by stacking two different 2D materials that have a desirable band edge alignment for water splitting. However, the experimental realization of such approach remains a challenge. Thus, finding a single 2D material with photocatalytic ability that possesses good visible region absorption remains a priority.
In this context, the Ag2Se monolayer has emerged as a promising optoelectronic material due to its unique electronic and optical properties.3–5 It possesses a direct bandgap, which makes it suitable for applications in optoelectronics, such as solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. However, its photocatalytic properties are still not fully understood and require further investigation. While an earlier study by Liu et al.6 has reported on the possible photocatalytic activity for Ag2Se through its band edge analysis, there is no quantitative evidence yet for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) calculations, which are necessary for confirming the occurrence of photocatalytic water splitting ability. In addition, the relatively wide band gap measured for this material (∼2.70 eV) compromises the absorption within the visible light domain, and this issue has not been discussed. The most significant obstacle that must be overcome to successfully implement photocatalytic water splitting is the search for an appropriate photocatalyst that is able to make effective use of solar energy.
It is known that the photocatalytic activity of a material is influenced by various factors, such as its electronic structure, surface area and crystal structure. It has been found that when the surface area of two-dimensionally layered materials undergoes continuous change, certain unique phenomena will manifest themselves. These phenomena include the mutual conversion between the indirect band gap and the direct band gap, the expansion of the band gap and the matching of the band gap with the visible and near-infrared regions.7–10 In this work, a methodical investigation into the geometric structure, electronic properties, photocatalytic performance and optical properties of the Ag2Se monolayer under biaxial strain were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) computations. The current study found that the band arrangement of the Ag2Se monolayer straddles the HER and OER, and these barriers could be adjusted with strain. Applying a compressive biaxial strain resulted in a significantly smaller band gap, leading to more intense absorption in the visible light range. Analysis of the HER and OER reactions reveals that, under light conditions, both reactions can occur spontaneously and without any cocatalyst or sacrificial agent.
As a result, the study concludes that compressed Ag2Se has excellent potential for use in the photocatalytic decomposition of water. To the best of our knowledge, there are not many 2D photocatalysts capable of achieving total water splitting through spontaneous means. Importantly, we are hopeful that the Ag2Se monolayer will soon be available, owing to the rapid development of experimental techniques for synthesizing 2D materials in recent years. It has been proposed that it can be synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques,11,12 both of which have been widely used in the study of novel 2D materials like monolayer Cu2Se and Cu2Te.13,14
2.0 Computational methods
The Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)15,16 was utilized for the calculations discussed in this context, which relied on DFT and employed the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) under the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) scheme.17 During the calculations, a cutoff energy of 500 eV was set, and the convergence criteria for the total energy and atomic force components were set to 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. A Monkhorst pack grid of 7 × 7 × 1 k-mesh was utilized to sample the Brillouin zone, which was then expanded to 15 × 15 × 1 for the optical properties calculations. Valence electron configurations for Ag and Se were 4p65s14d10 and 4s24p4, respectively. To minimize interaction between the adjacent monolayers, a vacuum space of 20 Å was employed in the z-direction. Since the PBE functional is associated with an underestimation of the band gap, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional18 was applied to yield a more accurate result of the band gap. The thermal stability was examined using the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) approach at 300 K for 5 ps with a 1 fs time step regulated by a canonical ensemble (NVT) within the Nose–Hoover thermostat.19 The many-body effects were taken into account when calculating the optical absorption spectra by using the scissor shift method (difference between PBE and the HSE06 band gap) in conjunction with the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) technique.20 The calculational approach of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was based on the method proposed by Nørskov et al.,21 presented as follows: 
ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH
(1)where ΔE indicates the hydrogen binding energy. Here, ΔE = EH – E – (1/2)EH2. EH and E represent the binding energies with and without the adsorbed hydrogen atom, respectively. ΔEZPE is the difference in zero-point energies, which were determined by means of vibrational frequency calculations utilizing the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) as implemented in the VASP package, while TΔS is taken as 0.21 eV under standard conditions.22 The effect of the electrode potential on the reaction ΔGU is expressible as −eU. Lastly, the effect of the pH on ΔG can be calculated via −kBTln10 × pH.
3.0 Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic properties and stability of the strained Ag2Se monolayer
We started by constructing and optimizing the structure of the Ag2Se monolayer. The fully relaxed Ag2Se monolayer has a square lattice constant of 5.86 Å, which is in good accordance with the results of earlier studies.23,24 Structural information for the optimized structure is placed in ESI† S1. Fig. 1 shows the fully optimized Ag2Se monolayer structure. Its calculated band structure (see ESI† S2) indicates a direct band gap (Eg) feature at the Γ point, with a HSE06 computed Eg of 2.68 eV. The wide Eg restricts the capacity to efficiently harvest photons in the visible sunlight spectrum, including the near-infrared light region that accounts for more than half of the solar energy. As such, the biaxial strain was purposefully imposed to alter the electronic structure of the Ag2Se monolayer. For a realistic implementation and to ensure that the monolayer remains in the elastic range, Eg and the strain energy for Ag2Se under −6% (compressive) to 6% (tensile) biaxial strain were evaluated. Implementation of external strains was done according to (a − a0)/a0 × 100%, where a and a0 are the lattice constants of the strained and unstrained states, respectively. For the strain energy, this quantity is defined as the difference in total energies of the structure under strain and equilibrium, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Fully optimized atomic structure of the Ag2Se monolayer, as viewed from the (a) side and (b) top positions. Blue and red represent the Ag and Se atoms, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 2(a), the tensile and compressive strains are well within the elastic deformation range, as the energy profile is almost parabolic. Strain energy is defined as the energy gained from deforming a supercell and its ability to return to its natural shape as quickly as possible. The curve of the strain energy stays as a quadratic function, which means that all stresses have an elastic range and can be changed back and forth. As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), stress is proportional to strain in the studied range. The feature of a fracture or critical breaking stress is not observed. Fig. 2(c) illustrates that the Eg increases linearly with biaxial tensile strain, but decreases rapidly with biaxial compressive strain. The valence band edge is significantly raised by the latter, resulting in a decrease in the Eg trend. This suggests that applying tensile strain is not beneficial for water splitting using an Ag2Se monolayer. Another crucial feature is that its valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) remain at Γ point throughout the imposed strains, preserving the desirable direct Eg type. Owing to the larger Eg reduction, Ag2Se under −6% biaxial application is expected to yield better optical absorption characteristics. The reduced Eg can be explained by the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis in S2,† in which a broader hybridization range between the Se 4p and Ag 4d orbitals (from −6 to 0 eV under strain compared with −5 to 0 eV in unstrained state) raises the VBM closer to CBM, narrowing the gap.
 Fig. 2  Variation of the (a) strain energy, (b) stress–strain relationship, and (c) Eg as a function of the applied strain between −6 and 6%, computed at the PBE level. 
Fig. 3(a) depicts the results of the AIMD simulations at 300 K, demonstrating that the total energies oscillate around the asymptotic value. Comparison between the Ag2Se monolayer under −6% strain and its initial geometries in Fig. 1 implies sufficient thermal stability, as the structures before and after simulations do not change significantly, without any broken bond features noted. In addition to a suitable band gap, a material undergoing photocatalytic water splitting must also have a suitable band-edge position. The VB edge position (EVBM) and CB edge position (ECBM) with respect to the vacuum level can be calculated using the slab model, as follows: 
EVBM(CBM) = EHSEVBM(CBM) − Evac
(2)where EHSE and Evac are the energy of the HSE06 corrected highest/lowest orbital and vacuum level within a slab. It is clear that the VBM and CBM of the Ag2Se monolayer under −6% strain remain located below and above the oxidation level of water (−5.67 eV) and the reduction level of water (−4.44 eV), respectively.

As illustrated in Fig. 3(b), the band edge position indicates that both the unstrained and −6% strained states of the Ag2Se monolayer satisfy the requirements for photocatalytic water splitting. We further assessed the chemical stability of the Ag2Se monolayer using the surface work function. The physical significance is defined as the energy required to dislodge an electron from the Fermi level. A low work function indicates that electrons are loosely bound, which is beneficial for carrier transfer during the photocatalytic process, but detrimental for the chemical stability of the material.25 As depicted in S3,† the work function of the Ag2Se monolayer is 5.62 eV in the unstrained state and 5.26 eV in the −6% strained state, which are greater than that of black phosphorene (4.50 eV),26 suggesting exemplary chemical stability.
3.2 Optoelectronic properties
The distance that a given wavelength can penetrate a material before being absorbed is determined by the absorption coefficient α(ω). Therefore, photons are easily absorbed by materials having a high α(ω). In order for photocatalysts to efficiently split water, it is essential for them to be able to capture solar energy in both the visible and near-infrared regions. This requirement underscores the importance of the α(ω) of photocatalytic materials, which is explained by the following equation: 
(3)where ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary components of the dielectric constant, respectively, while ω is the angular frequency.
As shown in Fig. 3(b), when subjected to a compressive strain of −6%, the Eg of the Ag2Se monolayer decreases from 2.68 to 1.89 eV, indicating a 29% change. As a result, the absorption spectra undergo a redshift, displaying a steeper curve and increasing the effective absorption of global air mass 1.5 spectra (AM1.5G) light, which makes it favorable for photocatalytic performance (see Fig. 4(a) for details). The band gap reduction caused by the −6% strain also allows for the light absorption range to extend into the near-infrared region, enabling the better capture of low-powered photons. The α(ω) remains up to 105 cm−1 order, and the values are comparable to those previously reported for other 2D materials such as CdS,27 PtSSe (ref. 28) and Janus III-chalcogenides.29 As reported,30 approximately 52%, 43% and 5% of the energy in solar radiation is composed of infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, in that order. Therefore, compressive biaxial straining is an effective technique for achieving programmable modification of the optical characteristics and ensuring up to 50% solar energy absorption.
 Fig. 4  (a) Frequency-dependent absorption coefficient α(ω) for the Ag2Se monolayer with and without strain. An adequate number of empty bands were included in the computations, set to be five times that of valence bands. Note that the first three absorption peaks for the −6% strained state have been raised and broadened, clearly taking advantage of the Eg reduction. (b) Plot of PCE versus film thickness obtained with the SLME approach. 
This improvement is verified by the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) calculations (see ESI† S4 for calculation details), in which the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) at 0 to 100 μm absorber thickness range was increased by three folds, as indicated by Fig. 4(b). The SLME of 24% suggests that the −6% strained Ag2Se monolayer has a comparable light trapping ability to the more common lead halide perovskites.31 Moreover, the Eg of 1.89 eV matches well with the optimal band gap of the photocatalyst, which is 1.8 eV.32 In addition to an appropriate Eg and sufficiently large band edges, the carrier mobility (μ) is a crucial factor in the use of photocatalysts. The μ is an indication of the photogenerated carrier transfer efficiency and recombination ratio, which affect the semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency. This is because a high mobility enables the efficient movement of electron–hole pairs to the surface of the photocatalyst, which lowers the recombination rate and provides a high photocatalytic performance. Prior research has established a direct connection between a high carrier mobility and an enhanced photocatalytic activity.33 The μ can be calculated using the following equation:34 
(4)in which kB, T, m, m*, ED and C2D are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, effective mass of carriers, mean effective mass given by , deformation potential (DP) constant as indicated by the gradient of CBM or VBM plot (see ESI† S5) and elastic constant in the transport direction, respectively.
The calculated μ and other relevant aforementioned parameters are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the compressive biaxial strain has less impact on the mass of electrons (me) in the Ag2Se monolayer, but the value of the holes mass (mh) can be effectively altered, as its value has been substantially reduced at −6% strain. For both pristine and −6% strain states, the electron and hole mobilities are considerably different. Due to its significantly lower ED and m, the electron μ is ∼105 times larger than that of the hole, indicating highly efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. Electrons would have rapidly moved to the surface, while holes still remain in their original region.35 In particular, for both x and y directions, −6% state shows improved μ compared to those calculated for pristine state and nearing the highest reported 3.0 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PC6 and BiMP6 (M = Al, Ga, In).36,37 Recombination of electrons and holes is suppressed in photocatalytic water-splitting events due to the pronounced anisotropy between carrier mobilities in each direction. Nevertheless, the dispersal of transverse acoustic (TA) phonons is disregarded in the DP theory. Consequently, the actual mobility will be one-third or one-half of the value predicted by the DP theory. Controlling the quantity of impurities and defects in semiconductors is essential for the fabrication of future electronic devices. In short, the α(ω) and μ in the investigated monolayer are both positively affected by the strain. Typically, thermal expansion mismatch38 and bending flexible substrates39,40 can be used to achieve biaxial and homogenous strains in layered materials. In contrast, the latter is easier to implement and has strong repeatability and reversible regulation within a critical range. Therefore, the bending flexible substrates method should be applicable in accomplishing the strain effect discussed in this work.

3.3 Surface reaction properties
HER and OER are the two half-reactions that take place on the surface during the overall photocatalytic splitting of water. The former entails only two electron steps and an intermediate state H*, while the latter typically follows a conventional reaction mechanism with three intermediate states of OH*, O* and OOH*, as illustrated below: 
* + H+ + e− → H*
(5) 
H+ + e− + H* → H2 + *
(6) 
* + H2O → OH* + H+ + e−

Based on the combined results of the band gap, band-edge position and light absorption, we considered that the studied monolayer is optimal for the water-splitting reaction at −6% strain. Hence, the catalytic activity of the studied monolayer under −6% was explored. Values of ΔG for each step were calculated and then displayed with respect to the reaction coordinate. A three-state diagram can be used to evaluate the overall HER mechanism, which consists of an initial state (H+ + e−), an intermediate state (adsorbed H*) and a final state (0.5 H2). A more negative value of ΔG during the HER indicates that H* adsorption is stronger, whereas a positive value of ΔG indicates that hydrogen desorption is more favorable. Therefore, an ideal HER catalyst should have a ΔG close to zero, as this facilitates both hydrogen adsorption and release. As presented in Fig. 5(a), the ΔG for HER is endothermic. Nevertheless, the present ΔG is lower than those (0.4–1.5 eV) that have been experimentally recorded for Mo2CO2 and Mo2CO2@Co.41 The 0.36 V potential at pH = 0 provided by the photoexcited electrons at the CBM of the −6% strained Ag2Se monolayer is sufficient to surmount the overpotential and enable the realization of the HER, reducing the ΔG to a favorable level of 0.24 eV and abiding by the −0.3 ≤ ΔG ≤ 0.3 eV range proposed in earlier research.42,43
 Fig. 5  The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) as a function of the reaction coordinate under standard conditions for (a) HER and (b) OER on the surface of Ag2Se under −6% strain. 
In addition, earlier experimental and theoretical works have reported on the effective tuning of |ΔG| through vacancy defects and doping of the transition metal (TM) atom in the catalyst with other TM atoms, such as Mo, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Pt, Au and Ag.44–47 By tuning the adsorption behavior of the H atom, these procedures not only substantially reduce the |ΔG| of TM-based catalysts to around the zero mark, but they can also expose more active sites by introducing more unsaturated electrons. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the O2 evolution process on the Ag2Se surface with or without light irradiation. Since ΔG for adsorption of OH* in the OER process is positive, the monolayer OER cannot occur spontaneously. At the equilibrium potential (U = 0 V), the step during the formation of OH* has the largest difference in free energy (2.03 eV), and is thus the potential-determining step (pds). An undesirable uphill profile is observed at this point. The measured pds is still far less than the experimentally determined 3.83 eV for Co-modified Ni/N-doped carbon.48 Hence, the overall photocatalytic water splitting reactions powered by the strained Ag2Se monolayer are thermodynamically feasible. Notably, the generation of OH* is still endothermic at U = 1.23 V. The potential provided by the photoexcited holes applied to OER is 1.54 V, calculated as the difference between the standard H+/H2 potential and the VBM of the oxygen evolution catalyst.
Under an external potential of U = 2.10 V, it is evident that all free-energy profiles become negative and are going downhill, indicating that the OER is exothermic and can proceed with minimal kinetic hindrance to catalyze water oxidation in this condition from an energy standpoint. The selected U value is much lower than that of other 2D photocatalysts49–52 and requires only an overpotential of 0.56 V. It is worth noting that the required overpotential is comparable or much less than those reported for other 2D materials, such as g-C3N4 (0.43 V),53 the broadly studied catalyst γ(Ni, Fe)OOH (0.56 V),54 GaAs (1.39 V),55 C2N-based heterostructures (0.94–1.47 V),56 β-Te2X (X = S, Se) (1.30–2.01 V)57 and CuCl (1.53 V).58 Researchers have also found that materials with intrinsically low photocurrents can be induced to better exhibit a photocurrent by applying an external voltage.59 Furthermore, the estimated pds is close to 2.28 eV obtained for the g-C3N4 monolayer. According to earlier work,60 this value can be reduced to 0.59 eV with appropriate hole co-catalysts. Together with the aforesaid materials, the results presented here demonstrate that it is viable to have a single environmentally stable 2D material with concurrent good visible region absorption and photocatalytic water-splitting ability. In the future, finding an appropriate co-catalyst for the Ag2Se monolayer will boost its photocatalytic performance.
On the whole, the −6% strained Ag2Se monolayer shows promise as a photocatalytic material due to its favorable band alignments, red-shifted Eg and reduced external potentials. The ultimate goal of solar-powered photocatalytic water splitting is to increase energy conversion efficiency, which is denoted as solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) and varies according to overpotentials of HER and OER. Supporting Information S6 provides more detailed information on the calculations performed. The calculated STH for unstrained and −6% strained Ag2Se monolayers are 9.14% and 19.81%, respectively, demonstrating an increase by a factor of two upon application of compressive strain. The STH of the latter decreases to 9.91% when a factor of 0.5 was applied to account for a situation in which only half of the photogenerated carriers participate in catalytic processes. Nonetheless, this value is still relatively close to the 10% efficiency threshold that is required for the commercially viable production of hydrogen at a cost-effective price. Our results pique experimental curiosity for Ag2Se for a water splitting mechanism, and demonstrate that its activity can be modulated by external strain.
Conclusion
The strained Ag2Se monolayer was analyzed using comprehensive DFT calculations to investigate its structural, electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties. As the compressive strain increases, there is a noticeable red shift in the light absorption curves and the appearance of peaks. The research findings indicate that when subjected to compressive straining at −6%, the monolayer remains semiconducting, has a red-shifted direct band gap of 1.89 eV and is thermally stable (as confirmed by the AIMD simulations results) with appropriate band edge positions and redox abilities for photocatalytic water splitting. Stable geometrical structures and elastic deformations of the monolayer are indicated by the quadratic trend in the strain energy plot. The tunable band structure of the Ag2Se monolayer opens up several possible uses in the semiconductor sector. Under illumination, HER and OER can proceed spontaneously on the Ag2Se monolayer surface, with only minimal overpotentials required to initiate these processes. Additionally, the carrier mobility and light-harvesting performance of the monolayer have been significantly enhanced. These results suggest that the compressively strained Ag2Se monolayer has the potential to be a highly effective photocatalyst for water splitting, and can even be considered for future high-speed nanoelectronics application. Given the eloquent evidence from this work and advancements in 2D material fabrication, it is expected that the Ag2Se monolayer will be synthesized and employed for visible-light driven water splitting in the near future.
