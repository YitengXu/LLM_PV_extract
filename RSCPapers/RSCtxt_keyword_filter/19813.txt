    , Accepted 27th May 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractWater electrolysis is a key technology for future energy systems intended for the storage of fluctuating renewables and green industrial product upgrading. Under acidic electrolysis conditions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) predominantly causes the overpotential loss, which makes the elucidation of OER kinetics a task of key importance for future catalyst development. Herein, we design a methodology based on vapor-fed polymer electrolyte water electrolysis to fully characterize OER kinetics in the real environment of solid electrolytes and realize the controlled benchmarking of catalysts in the absence of gas passivation commonly observed in liquid-electrolyte half-cell configurations. Vapor-fed cells, allowing for distinct manipulation of water activity, sustain the essential degree of freedom to resolve and determine all four essential kinetic parameters. Thus, this work provides valuable insights into the OER mechanism, isolates the rate-determining step, and experimentally determines the reaction order of the state-of-the-art OER catalyst IrO2/TiO2 with respect to water. Through the combination of gas and liquid fed kinetic analysis, we elucidate the important missing link for formulating the generic governing relation for the OER overpotential and thereby providing a method for benchmarking of catalyst activities under technically representative conditions.

Broader context
The fluctuating nature of renewable (e.g., wind and solar) energy sources and their increasing market share necessitate the implementation of large and clean energy storage systems, which commonly employ the power-to-gas process, i.e., use electrolysis to convert excess electric energy to hydrogen for storage. Although polymer electrolyte water electrolysis complies with the essential requirements of dynamic operation and high power density, the techno-economic relevance of this technology is strongly bound to its electrochemical efficiency and high loadings of expensive Pt-group metal catalysts (e.g. Ir oxide) used to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which make electrolysis economically less viable. Thus, the selective tuning and optimization of OER catalyst properties are tasks of high practical significance, requiring knowledge of the underlying reaction mechanism and the rate determining step for successful realization. In polymer electrolyte fuel cell science, profound knowledge of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has guided the broad development of novel catalysts with extremely high activities. Conversely, the field of water electrolysis is characterized by a lack of in-depth and reliable characterization of OER catalysts such as Ir oxide, which hinders the further development of highly efficient novel catalysts.

Introduction
In order for the hydrogen-based economy to be viable,1–3 the efficiency and capital cost of polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (PEWE) have to be substantially improved.4–10 Hydrogen at a target cost of 2 $ per kgH211 will enable economically profitable production for road transport applications and green product upgrading. In PEWE, the electrochemical splitting of water into O2 and H2 involves two half-cell reactions, the fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode: OER: 2H2O → O2 + 4e− + 4H+(1) HER: 4H+ → 4e− + 2H2(2) Overall: 2H2O → O2 + 2H2(3)
The use of rare precious metal oxides such as Ir and Ru oxides12 as electrocatalysts is a substantial cost driver. Therefore, the development of highly active and durable catalysts aims to reduce both catalyst loading (lower Capex) and kinetic losses (lower Opex) to enable the development of techno-economically competitive PEWE systems. With respect to operating efficiency, the kinetic overpotential of the anode becomes the main loss when ohmic losses are reduced via the use of thin membranes.13–15 In turn, electro-kinetic losses are dominated by the sluggish OER half-cell reaction. Ir and Ru oxides are commonly used to promote the oxygen evolution reaction because of their high intrinsic catalytic activity in acidic environments,16–18 with the highly stable and active Ir oxide commonly preferred to the unstable Ru oxide.17,19,20
Despite the apparent simplicity of the OER reaction (eqn (1)), its mechanism and rate-determining step (RDS) are considered as the enigma in in the field of electro-catalysis in electrolysis.21–23 Moreover, neither OER intermediates nor the related active sites or mechanism have been clearly identified in acidic environments.24 Therefore, the elucidation of reaction intermediates will enable more rational catalyst layer designs which consequently lead to reduced kinetic overpotentials and lower Opex in industrial electrolysis through more efficient operation and lower power consumption.
The OER mechanism has been extensively studied, and numerous pathways and related intermediates of interest have been proposed.25–30 Tafel slope analysis and correlation to the RDS based on assumed symmetry factors have been widely performed,31–33 and density functional theory (DFT) analysis26,34,35 has been recently employed to elucidate the OER mechanism and intermediates. The identification of intermediate binding energies at active sites holds the key to RDS elucidation. Rossmeisl et al.26 and Valdés et al.35 highlighted the importance of oxygen binding energy for reaction propagation and postulated a novel mechanism involving the formation of an *OOH peroxide intermediate for metal oxides with high O* binding energies, such as IrO2. However, the proposed mechanism has not been clearly validated to date because of the fundamental lack of experimentally determined parameters such as reaction order with respect to water.
The key intrinsic kinetic parameters, essential for the understanding of electrocatalysis are (i) the kinetic reaction order, (ii) transfer coefficient, (iii) activation energy, and (iv) specific exchange current density. In contrast to the case of the ORR on Pt, extensively characterized in polymer electrolyte fuel cell studies,36 OER catalyst properties have been underexplored, largely because access to OER kinetic parameters is hindered by the use of rotating disk electrode (RDE) investigations that employ liquid electrolytes (mainly diluted HClO4) and thus preclude reactant activity variation.
To date, only the OER transfer coefficient and activation energy have been determined using liquid electrolyte-based electrochemical techniques (RDE),16,31,37,38 whereas the reaction order with respect to water and specific exchange current density have not been reported, largely because of the lack of appropriate methodologies. Although the apparent exchange current densities of catalysts are frequently reported,14,18,39 this parameter is not suitable for determining electrokinetic fundamentals. Further, catalyst activity depends on whether a liquid or a solid electrolyte is employed40,41 because of the corresponding differences in anion adsorption behavior, as revealed by fuel cell investigations. Finally, the use of half-cells with aqueous electrolytes for OER catalyst characterization is questionable if the experiments are not carefully performed, as the blockage of evolving oxygen on the catalyst layer surface may induce partial deactivation and thus bias data results in OER mass activity differences as large as 40%.42 Partial catalyst utilization was recently also reported by Kroschel et al.38 and Schuler et al.15 for half-cell RDE as well as technical cell measurements, respectively, where activity was shown to scale with porous transport layer surface properties.39,43
Therefore, this study aims to determine the four intrinsic kinetic parameters of the OER on Ir oxide in a solid electrolyte environment, employing vapor-fed polymer electrolyte water electrolysis (VF-PEWE) to enable water activity variation. The obtained experimental reaction order allow to probe previously proposed OER mechanisms as well as RDSs and identify a valid reaction mechanism. The determination of all four fundamental kinetic parameters allows the formulation of the governing relation of OER overpotential on Ir oxide, a key step that has been made for the ORR in fuel cells 13 years ago36 but is still missing in the field of PEWE. Gas and liquid fed kinetic analysis is conducted with identical materials, set up and operational parameters. The discrepancy between liquid and gas fed activities are analyzed. The novel insights enable the deduction of a generic formulation for the OER overpotential.
OER kinetics
To extract kinetic parameters from overall cell polarization data under realistic operation conditions, one needs to deconvolute the electrolysis cell voltage into the sum of the thermodynamic equilibrium voltage and the three overpotential terms associated with electric resistance ηΩ, fluid and ionic transport ηmtx and kinetic activation ηkin.
The characterization of kinetics requires purely kinetic cell voltages. Therefore, the iR-free and mtx-free voltage EiR&mtxfree [V] is determined as EiR&mtxfree = Ecell − ηΩ − ηmtx = E0p,T + ηkin(4)where Ecell [V] is the overall cell voltage and E0p,T [V] the equilibrium voltage at given pressure and temperature.
The ohmic overpotentials ηΩ [V] are determined from the high-frequency resistance (HFR), and mass transport is assumed to be negligible at the low current densities used to evaluate kinetics.
To deduce the kinetic overvoltage, the equilibrium voltage corrected for temperature and change in entropy under isobaric conditions needs to be determined according to the Nernst relation: (5)with (6)where R [J (mol K)−1] is the universal gas constant, F [C mol−1] is the Faraday constant, ai the activity of gas species i, and SR,T* [J (mol K)−1] is the standard reaction entropy. As the molar reaction heat capacity cp was assumed to be temperature-independent, the entropy change term was simplified to 0.9 × 10−3 (T − 298) with T [K].36,44
For vapor fed polymer electrolyte electrolysis (VF-PEWE), activity ai [−] can be expressed as the ratio of the specie's partial pressure pi [Pa] to the specie's total pressure at standard conditions pi* [Pa]. Standard conditions labeled with an asterisk (*). In the case of water, the saturation pressure  [Pa] is determined according to the Antoine equation for water vapor.45–47
In PEWE, the kinetic overpotential is mainly determined by OER kinetics because of the high reversibility of the HER and the HOR.48,49 Therefore, the HER electrode is considered as quasi non-polarizable, which allows ηkin [V] to be replaced with ηOER [V].
Intrinsic catalyst parameters
The kinetic properties of an electrocatalyst, as described by the Butler–Vollmer model and simplified to the Tafel relation, are described by the four intrinsic catalyst parameters (i) the transfer coefficient αi, (ii) the specific exchange current density i0,s (iii) the activation energy ΔE0a and (iv) the reaction order m, all of which can be determined from experimental data acquired upon variation of the temperature T and the partial pressure of water pH2O. In this chapter, the deduction of the above parameters from accessible electrochemical data is explained.
Generally, electrochemical kinetics can be described by the so-called Tafel model relating the kinetic overpotential ηOER to the apparent current density i [A cmgeo−2] according to eqn (7): (7) (8)where αa [−] is the anodic transfer coefficient, and i0 [A cmgeo−2] the apparent exchange current density. The pre-factor of 2.303RT/(αaF) is summarized in a characteristic kinetic parameter, the so-called Tafel slope b [V dec−1] (eqn (8)).
The first parameter of interest, namely the transfer coefficient αa can be extracted from the temperature dependence of the Tafel slope b as (9)
The second parameter of interest, namely the specific exchange current density i0,s [A cmcat−2] is the reaction rate at zero overpotential normalized to the electrochemically active catalyst surface area. In contrast to the apparent exchange current density i0 (normalized to the geometric area), the specific exchange current density cannot be directly accessed from electrochemical experiments and needs to be determined from eqn (10) (10)where ECSA [mcat2 g−1] is the electrochemically active surface area (active area per catalyst weight), lcat [mg cmgeo−2] the catalyst loading and the pre-factor of 10 accounts for unit conversion. The ECSA of Ir oxide catalysts can be determined either from known catalyst specifications or experimentally using mercury underpotential deposition50 or zinc adsorption,51 as these catalysts feature no characteristic hydrogen under potential deposition fingerprint, in contrast to Pt-based ones.52,53
The third intrinsic catalyst parameter, the activation energy ΔE0a [J mol−1], can be determined using the general formulation of the specific exchange current density i0,s at reversible cell voltage in analogy to the ORR in PEFCs36 (eqn (11)). (11)where T [K] is the temperature and γ [−] the reaction order at constant overpotential. The activity of water aH2O is expressed as the ratio of the water vapor pressure pH2O to the corresponding saturation pressure . The specific exchange current density i0,s is normalized with respect to a reference temperature T0. For the sake of comprehensibility, i0,s is normalized to T0 = 80 °C, as proposed by Neyerlin et al.36
The activation energy depends on cell voltage,36,54,55 as the temperature-dependent nature of the Tafel slope b results in differences in the extrapolation of apparent exchange current densities at iso-potentials. Therefore, for consistency, ΔE0a are reported at reversible cell voltage ΔE0p,T according to eqn (5).
Knowledge of the above two parameters allows to determine the two missing parameters (iii) ΔE0a and (iv) reaction order.
Activation energy at reversible cell voltage ΔE0a, the third intrinsic parameter, can be obtained for the determination of the apparent exchange current densities at reversible cell voltage. When temperature is varied, −ΔE0a can be calculated according to eqn (12): (12)
The fourth intrinsic parameter, the reaction order, is a fundamental kinetic descriptor characterizing the dependence of reaction rate on reactant concentration. The identification of the OER reaction order in acidic environments is essential for the determination of the kinetic overpotential and the RDS in proposed reaction mechanisms. The use of VF-PEWE allows water activity aH2O [−] to be varied through RH [−] control at constant total pressure and temperature, thereby enabling the determination of the reaction order with respect to water at constant cell voltage mH2O according to eqn (13): (13)
Three different definitions of reaction order are employed in the field of electrochemistry, namely reaction order at constant overpotential η, at constant cell voltage E, and at constant current density i. Therefore, one has to pay attention to these definitions when comparing literature values.
OER mechanisms
The OER is a complex multistep reaction. Numerous OER mechanisms have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of characterization methods, from Tafel slope analysis to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, four different intermediates of interest were identified, namely Oad, Oad−, OHad, and OOHad.
Five proposed mechanisms for the OER in acidic media are summarized in Fig. 1 (adapted from Matsumoto et al.,30 intermediates formed and adsorbed on the active surface sites of the catalyst are marked by Oad) and briefly described below.
 Fig. 1  Expanded overview of proposed reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction in acid environment, adapted from Matsumoto et al.30 
Several kinetic studies22,56–60 assumed the established three-step mechanisms with Oad and OHad as important intermediates, namely Bockris's oxide path (BOP) and Bockris's electrochemical oxide path (BEOP), both of which involve a primary charge transfer step to form adsorbed hydroxide. The second step of BOP involves the conversion of hydroxide to Oad and water, whereas in BEOP, a hydroxide discharge to Oad is considered. In the last step, O2 is formed through the chemical recombination of Oad.
The four-step Krasil'shchkov's path (KP) features the formation of an oxygen anion in step 2, the formation of Oad through discharge of Oad− in step 3, and the recombination of Oad to afford O2 in step 4.
Wade and Hackerman's path (WHP) represents an alternative reaction mechanism based on the formation of O* by discharge of water in the initial step followed by the electrochemical recombination of Oad and OHad− to oxygen and water.
Rossmeisl et al.26 performed DFT calculations for rutile-structured RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2, revealing that the associated four-step reaction mechanism is electrochemically dominant, involving a single charge transfer in each step. In contrast to BEOP, Rossmeisl's peroxide path (RPP) involves peroxide formation in the third step rather than the direct recombination of adsorbed Oad to O2, as the activation barriers for the latter step are predicted to be high.26,61
To date, no clear experimental proof, supporting any of the five reaction mechanisms has been provided for metal oxide catalysts used in PEWE.
Knowledge of the reaction order and the Tafel slope provides guidance for identifying the correct reaction mechanism and the associated RDS as well as the rate-determining intermediate adsorbing species.
The RDS is defined as the slowest reaction step in the elementary step sequence of the reaction mechanism and therefore determines the kinetic overpotential. Theoretical reaction orders can be determined for proposed reaction mechanisms, and comparison to experimentally determined reaction order values provides mechanistic insights and leads to the elucidation of the RDS.
In the derivation of theoretical reaction orders, quasi-steady-state kinetics are assumed for forward and backward reactions, and only the RDS is considered as irreversible. The equilibrium constant Ki of reaction step i is defined as a function of the rate constants ki for the forward (+) and backward (−) reactions according to eqn (14): (14)
The mechanistic analysis for RPP26 is shown in eqn (15)–(22). For each step, the first equation shows the quasi-equilibrium relation, and the second equation reflects the corresponding reaction rate. Other mechanisms listed in Table 1 are analyzed identically, with results reported in the ESI.†

Table 1 lists the reaction orders with respect to water (1 to 2) and H+ (−1 to −4) at constant voltage mi for all five reaction mechanisms, assuming θOH ≪ 1.
Results and discussion
This study aims to characterize the kinetics of the OER on Ir oxide in acidic environments, employing vapor fed PEWE (VF-PEWE) to enable the variation of water activity and provide a degree of freedom unavailable in the cases of conventional liquid-feed cells or RDE setups. Thus, VF-PEWE enables the determination of all four essential kinetic parameters, including the reaction order with respect to water. Analysis of VF-PEWE cell performance as a function of water activity at constant pressure and temperature is employed to elegantly determine the above reaction order and get insights into the RDS of the OER.
The values of αa, ΔE0a, and i0,s were also determined by the combined variation of catalyst loading and temperature. The experimentally determined parameters were compared to those reported previously, and the intrinsic OER overpotential relation was deduced for the investigated IrO2 supported on TiO2 catalyst. Finally by correlation of vapor and liquid fed PEWE kinetics a generic formulation of the OER losses is presented.
Fundamentals of VF-PEWE
VF-PEWE is a model system well suited for the electrokinetic characterization of anode catalysts, allowing the OER order with respect to water in acidic media to be simply determined by precisely controlled RH variation, in contrast to conventional liquid-fed PEWE or RDE setups. Furthermore, one expects no effects of catalyst ionomer swelling due to liquid water uptake, which can otherwise cause a distortion of the electric percolation network and thus change the utilization of the catalyst layer.15,62
In liquid-fed PEWE, membrane resistance is largely independent of current density for isothermal operation, whereas this is not the case for vapor-fed cells. To ensure no impact by mass transfer losses caused by local dehydration of the membrane or catalyst layer, a current density regime that features minimal changes in membrane resistance and is therefore valid for kinetic evaluation needs to be determined. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 2a, in which three governing current density domains are identified for a typical VF-PEWE polarization curve. The kinetic, transition, and mass transport limitation regimes are highlighted in white, faded red and red, respectively. The semi-logarithmic plot enables the determination of kinetic parameters according to the Tafel model, revealing a linear correlation between EiR&mtxfree and i for current densities of <10 mA cm−2. This threshold value is an order of magnitude lower than that observed for liquid-fed PEWE.39,63,64
 Fig. 2  Cell performance of vapour fed cell (a) polarization and iR-free polarization curve at 80 °C, 1.1 bar and 90% RH; (b) high frequency resistance at each current step. The three different characteristic domains for gas fed PEWE are highlighted in white (kinetic), faded red (transition) and red (mass transport limited). 
The transition regime comprises kinetic and mass transport (mtx) losses. Characteristic mass transport-limited behavior was obtained for voltages above 2 V (highlighted in red) with limiting current densities of <100 mA cm−2. VF-PEWE performance has also been investigated by Spurgeon et al.,65 who observed similar behavior with limiting current densities in the range of 20–40 mA cm−2 at ∼2 V.
The evolution of the HFR as a function of current density is shown in Fig. 2b. HFR was stable at low current densities, gradually increasing in the transition regime and exponentially rising in the mtx-limited regime, which is strongly indicative of membrane dehydration effects in the mtx limited regime. The cell voltage trend mimics the evolution of mass transport contributions. To ensure valid boundary conditions for kinetic evaluation, the maximum current density was defined by an HFR increase of <5% (referenced to 1 mA cm−2) rather than by a fixed current density. Galvanostatic criteria might lead to substantial misclassification because of the increasing mass transport contribution for lower RH at identical current densities.
Kinetic parameter and RDS determination
First, the underlying reaction mechanism and the RDS of the OER were elucidated. The OER order with respect to water was determined to identify valid reaction mechanisms and RDSs. Complementary to reaction order analysis, the transfer coefficient was experimentally extracted and the symmetry factor calculated to enable further exclusion of non-suitable reaction mechanisms.
The remaining kinetic parameters were characterized at variable temperature and catalyst loadings to determine activation energy. Based on the results of previous kinetic parameter analysis, the specific exchange current density of IrO2 for PEWE operation was subsequently calculated.

Reaction order m. 
The change in reaction rate, i.e., the change of current density as a function of reactant activity at constant voltage, allows to determine the reaction order at constant cell voltage m. Water activity was varied between 50 and 90% RH at 80 °C and 1.1 bar total pressure, with the corresponding polarization curves and HFR values given in Fig. 3. At high current densities, the expected mass transport limitation was observed, and limiting current densities decreased with decreasing reactant concentration. Hence, a shift of the transition regime toward lower current densities occurred.
 Fig. 3  (a) Polarization curves for varied anodic RH (50–90%) at 1.1 bar total pressure, 80 °C and a cathodic RH of 95%; (b) high frequency resistance HFR for same conditions. 
At constant current densities below ∼40 mA cm−2 the iR-free cell voltage increased with decreasing water activity, i.e., with decreasing RH; however, only a small current density domain with ΔHFR < 5% (highlighted in green in Fig. 3b) was valid for kinetic analysis.
Semi-logarithmic plots of the iR-free cell voltage at different water vapor activities are given in Fig. 4a, revealing Tafel slopes (56 ± 1 mV dec−1) close to the values of 55–65 mV dec−166–73 previously reported for IrO2 and IrO2/TiO239,67 as well as to the values of 60–64 mV dec−1 determined for nano and bulk metal Ir catalysts.19,74

The reaction order m at constant cell voltage for the OER on IrO2 in acidic media was determined using eqn (13) to be 2.07 ± 0.10. The iso-voltage line is plotted in Fig. 4b. The reaction order is determined in the voltage window between 1.35–1.5 V. The reaction order is considered to be constant. The standard deviation originates from slight differences in Tafel slopes.


Anodic transfer coefficient αa. 
The transfer coefficient αa, associated with a specific reaction mechanism and the number of transferred electrons, can be accessed by analysis of the temperature dependence of the Tafel slope b (see eqn (7)), with the corresponding experimental data for different catalyst loadings given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The average value of αa = 1.08 ± 0.02 obtained for different loadings is in agreement with previously reported values of 0.8414 (IrO2), 0.8216 (Ir), and 1.0616 (RuO2/TiO2) as well as with a model-predicted value of 0.92–1.0175 at 50–80 °C.
The knowledge of αa [−] enables the determination of the symmetry factor β [−] for reaction mechanisms with RDSs featuring mH2O = 2. For a multistep reaction mechanism, the relation between β and αa is given by eqn (23).76 (23)where n [−] is the number of electrons transferred in the overall reaction, r [−] is the number of electrons involved in the RDS, s [−] is the number of electrons involved before the RDS, and ν the stoichiometric number of the reaction mechanism.
For the OER, n and αa are considered to equal 4 and ∼1, respectively. Furthermore, solutions for β are restricted to 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 by parameter space definition.
When RPP steps 3 and 4 are considered as the RDS, β is obtained as ∼1 (s = 2, r = 1, ν = 1) and ∼0 (s = 3, r = 1, ν = 1), respectively. For the electrochemically driven BEOP step 2 the RDS requires an invalid β of ∼2 (s = 1, r = 1, ν = 1). Moreover, β is not defined for BOP steps 2 and 3 as well as for BEOP step 3, as they are purely chemically driven.
The results of the symmetry factor analysis are complementary to those of the reaction order analysis, supporting the hypothesis of RPP being the valid reaction mechanism and RPP step 3 being the RDS with β ≈ 1.


Activation energy ΔE0a at reversible cell voltage. 
The energy required to drive a reaction is specified by the catalyst activation energy ΔE0a which can be determined by temperature variation according to eqn (1). Hence, polarization curves were recorded for four CCM loadings of 1.0–3.0 mg cm−2 at 70 and 80 °C to determine the activation energy ΔE0a. The kinetic regime was analyzed based on the Tafel model in analogy to the procedure in section “Reaction order m”. Tafel slopes were extracted from semi-logarithmic plots of iR-free voltages at 70 and 80 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Tafel relation according to eqn (6) in combination with the definitions of the cell potential and Nernst voltage according to eqn (4) and (5) was used to determine the apparent exchange current density at reversible cell voltage.
A linear correlation was obtained for isotherms of apparent exchange current density vs. IrO2 loading in Fig. 5. The thus determined values are of the same order of magnitude as those reported in literature (10−7 to 10−8 A cm−2).16,38,74 From the isothermal slopes of Fig. 5, the activation energy at reversible cell potential for IrO2/TiO2 was calculated to be 42.5 ± 10 kJ mol−1 according to eqn (12), being ∼15 kJ mol−136 lower than the ORR activation energy of Pt/C catalysts.

Specific exchange current density i0,s. 
The specific exchange current density i0,s is considered to be the most important parameter describing catalyst activity, being essential for the transparent comparison of different catalysts. Electrocatalytic activity is normalized to the catalyst active surface area rather than to the geometric area, which is the underlying normalization parameter of apparent exchange current densities i0. Although apparent exchange current densities were frequently characterized,16,20,39,74 data for the specific exchange current density i0,s of OER catalysts have not been reported so far because of the lack of appropriate methodologies and kinetic parameters (particularly reaction order). With the knowledge of lcat and i0 (extracted from Fig. 5), the specific exchange current density was determined using eqn (11), where γ represents the reaction order at constant overpotential. Its relation to the reaction order m at constant voltage is deduced in the next chapter and given in eqn (27). Consequently, if m equals to 2.1 ± 0.1, the reaction order γ is given to be 1.6 ± 0.1. Given a reference temperature T* of 80 °C (353 K), an activation energy at reversible cell voltage of 55 kJ mol−1 (average of the value of 43 kJ mol−1 determined herein and the literature value of 67 kJ mol−114), an ECSA of 14 m2 gIr−1 (reported by Alia et al.18 for the same IrO2/TiO2 catalyst sourced from Umicore), the OER exchange current density was calculated as 0.6 ± 0.1 × 10−9 A cmIr−2. The sluggish kinetics of OER for IrO2/TiO2 can be set into perspective when compared to one order of magnitude higher ORR activity of Pt/C (0.1 to 2.5 × 10−8 A cmPt−2, 80 °C)36 and to the up to eight orders of magnitude higher HER activities of Ir/C (0.05 A cmIr−2, 40 °C) and Pt/C (0.2 A cmPt−2, 40 °C)48 catalysts.
Generally, the parameters for Tafel slope, transfer coefficient and activation energy determined experimentally by VP-PEWE are coherent to reported values from RDE and technical cell characterization. The parameters are summarized in Table 2. A distinct difference in apparent and specific exchange current density is expected due to variations in catalyst utilization e.g. caused by gas passivation effects in RDE and partial catalyst utilization in cell characterization, as discussed in the section “Relation between vapor and liquid fed OER kinetics”.

Deduction of kinetic loss relation for the OER
The kinetic parameters are summarized and compared to literature data (Table 2). The obtained Tafel slope is in good agreement with values reported for Ir metal- and oxide-based catalysts tested in liquid and solid electrolytes. Only few values for the transfer coefficient have been reported previously, and even a smaller number of activation energies have been determined for Ir-based catalysts. Both the transfer coefficient and activation energy determined herein are close to literature values. Importantly, neither an experimentally determined reaction order with respect to water nor a specific exchange current density at reversible cell voltage have been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge.

Analytic overvoltage determination. 
The parameters in Table 2 allow the kinetic overpotential of the OER on IrO2/TiO2 to be expressed as a function of temperature, water activity, and current density in analogy to the study of Neyerlin et al.36 for the oxygen reduction reaction. Identical reference values for the reference temperature, use of reversible voltage of the activation energy enable a direct comparison and promote the comparability for the scientific community. By combining eqn (5), (7) and (11), the iR- and mtx-free cell voltage defined in eqn (4), formulates as follows: (24)with (25)with all symbols having the definition as given in eqn (4)–(11) and χ [−] being a catalyst utilization factor accounting for partial catalyst utilization with 0 < χ ≤ 1.
In the field of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, it is common practice to express EiR&mtxfree as function of a defined reference voltage Eref(Tref,prefi) in the kinetic regime <100 mA cm−2, such as Eref = 0.9 V. This approach can be translated to the vapor fed OER model and mtx-free reference voltage Eref assuming αa = 1 and eqn (24) can be rewritten as: (26)with (27)and (28)where ΔEaEref [J mol−1] is the activation energy at the reference voltage Eref. The reference current density  [A cmgeo−2] is defined by the specific reference current density  [A cmcat−2], ECSA [mcat2 g−1], lIrO2 [mg cmgeo−2], χ [−] and a unit conversion factor of 10 according to eqn (28). The operational parameters used for the determination of  are the partial pressure of gases prefi, the water activity  and Tref the reference temperature. These symbols are labeled accordingly by ref.
The relation between the reaction order m at constant voltage and γ at constant overpotential can be extracted from eqn (24) and is given in eqn (27). Employing eqn (27) and a transfer coefficient α between 0.8–1.0, as reported in Table 2, a theoretical reaction order at constant overpotential of γ = 1.6 ± 0.1 is obtained. This formalism is validated by comparing measured and calculated iR- and mtx-free cell voltages in the kinetic regime according to eqn (26). For the calculation, kinetic parameters from Table 2 were used, while the exchange current density  at the reference potential of Eref = 1.444 V was obtained from Fig. 4a as 2.78 × 10−5 A cmcat−2 (RH = aH2O = 0.9, ptotal = 1.1 bar, T = Tref = 80 °C, ).
In Fig. 6 the correlations are given for three different reaction orders at constant voltage m between 1 to 3. From Fig. 6a it is quite obvious that a reaction order of 1 results in a significant mismatch with the measured voltages for different water activities. At a reaction order of two, a good fit for measured and calculated data is obtained (Fig. 6b), while a further increase in reaction order to 3 shows an overestimation of calculated voltages at low RH. These findings are in a good agreement with the experimentally determined reaction order at constant voltage of 2.1. ± 0.1.

Relation between vapor and liquid fed OER kinetics. 
Finally, the question arises if the developed OER relation for vapor fed PEWE can be applied to kinetic characterization of conventional liquid water fed PEWE. Therefore, measurements were conducted also with anode liquid feed, with identical materials, cell configuration and conditions. Polarization and iR-free voltage curves are shown in Fig. 7a and b for two different anode IrO2 loadings. As expected, lower cell voltages are observed for higher loading.
 Fig. 7  (a) Cell voltage, (b) iR-free cell voltage of cell operated with liquid water at 80 °C and 1 bar with anodic IrO2 loading of 2.5 and 3.0 mg cm−2, (c) correlation of measured iR-free cell voltage extracted from (b) and calculated voltage based on eqn (26) as well as corrected for partial catalyst layer utilization χ as indicated, for current densities of 10–100 mA cm−2. 
When correlating these liquid based experimental data with calculated iR- and mtx-free values in the range of 10–100 mA cm−2 an almost consistent offset in the correlation is observed (see Fig. 7c). Measured data points show higher voltage values than expected based on the vapor fed derived kinetic parameters. The observed discrepancy implies that there is a missing (constant) parameter responsible for the gap between experimental (liquid) and calculated (obtained from gas fed) kinetics. The shift of the curve implies, that the catalyst being ‘more active’ for the gas fed case.
The possible missing puzzle piece is found in recent publications focusing on characterization of the catalyst layer utilization in PEWE. Incomplete utilization was reported by a number of research groups based on investigation of the utilization with different techniques.15,38,79 Characterization using a modified RDE set up employing porous transport layers (PTLs) in a half-cell configuration,38 optical imaging79,80 of the PTL/CL showed partial catalyst utilization confined to the vicinity of PTL and CL interface. Schuler et al.15,39,43 correlated the structural properties of the interface between PTL and CL and catalyst utilization using X-ray tomographic microscopy. Analysis showed that ionomer swelling when in contact with liquid water causes a distortion of the electrical percolation network in the catalyst layer and thereby leading to partial catalyst layer utilization.
These findings clearly point to differences in apparent kinetic activity between vapor fed and liquid fed cells as observed in Fig. 7c. To account for the partial catalyst layer utilization in liquid water fed cells, the catalyst utilization factor χ, has to be determined.
Scaling of the calculated voltages in Fig. 7c with χ = 0.75 result in an almost perfect correlation with the experimental data. This again highlights the limitation of catalyst layer characterization in liquid electrolyte and points to the challenges for reliable benchmarking of OER catalyst activity. Vapor fed cells represent an advanced electrochemical tool to benchmark true kinetic activity in presence of solid electrolyte, unbiased by liquid water induced partial catalyst layer utilization by morphological changes or gas agglomeration in/on the catalyst layer.

Conclusions
A novel methodology to determine OER catalyst activity and characterize the corresponding reaction mechanism was developed based on vapor fed PEWE cells (VF-PEWE). With this, a methodology with clear boundary conditions for OER catalyst characterization is established and possible biases of the conventional liquid environment methods, used for OER catalyst characterization, are eliminated. Partial deactivation of catalyst layer domains42 by gas adsorption on the catalyst surface, or structural changes in catalyst layers in contact with liquid water by ionomer swelling are both excluded.
Kinetic analysis with VF-PEWE was performed at relevant temperatures of 70–80 °C. All four fundamental kinetic parameters of the OER, namely the transfer coefficient αi, the specific exchange current density i0,s, the activation energy ΔE0a at reversible cell voltage, and the reaction order were determined for IrO2/TiO2 as a state-of-the-art supported catalyst. The reaction order with respect to water at constant voltage m was determined as 2.1 ± 0.1 by variation of water activity and the reaction order γ at constant overpotential as 1.6 ± 0.1.
These experimental results support the recent DFT-based findings, postulating the formation of the OOHad intermediate as the rate determining step RDS for metal oxides with strong oxygen binding, e.g., RuO2 and IrO2. The reaction order validation provides confidence in the identification of the rate governing intermediates Oad and OOHad and relevant binding energies. The symmetry factor α was determined as ∼1 and the activation energy ΔE0a as 43 kJ mol−1, respectively. For the specific exchange current density i0,s at 80 °C a value of 0.6 × 10−9 A cmIrO2−2 was obtained, being roughly an order of magnitude lower than values obtained for the ORR on Pt/C catalysts36 and 8–9 orders of magnitude lower than values reported for the HER48 on Pt/C catalysts in acidic media.
Based on the novel insights, the OER overpotential relation for vapor fed PEWE was deduced and validated. To account for the differences between the OER kinetics obtained with gas and liquid feed, due to partial catalyst utilization in liquid water environment,15,38,39,79 the introduction of a catalyst utilization factor χ, scaling the apparent exchange current density is proposed. With this a consistent, generic relation for the OER overpotential, for both gas and liquid feed is established.
The VF-PEWE methodology is proven as robust method, complementary to conventional liquid based RDE measurements, and has shown the unique capability to reliably benchmark OER catalysts. This novel tool and the insights into the properties gas and liquid fed methods help guiding the way for the development of highly efficient, next generation OER catalysts.
Experimental
Setup
An in-house-developed differential cell with an active area of 2 × 2 cm2 was used for measurements. The parallel flow field design of anode and cathode sides had five channels with a length of 2 cm and a width of 0.2 cm. The width rib/channel ratio was chosen to equal unity. Integrated water loops on both cell sides enabled precise temperature control. A chiller (Huber Ministat CC3, Peter Huber Kältemaschinenbau GmbH, Germany) was used to control the water loop temperature. Cell temperature was controlled by thermocouples located in the bulk cell housing next to the anodic flow field. The surface in contact with deionized (DI) water was Au-coated to prevent contamination, and a spring configuration at the anode side provided a constant contact pressure of 2.5 MPa independent of nominal porous transport layer thickness variations.
The cell setup required precise control of water activity for the characterization of OER kinetics. Therefore, controlled evaporation mixers (Bronkhorst type W-102A-220-K, Bronkhorst AG, Switzerland), in which defined mass flows of water and dry nitrogen are homogenously mixed in a heated evaporation chamber, were used for vapor pressure setting. Gas lines were heated to 25 K above the set dew point to prevent condensation. Heated pressure sensors close to the cell outlet in combination with backpressure valves were used for pressure control. A constant volume flow of 1 ln min−1 was provided at both anode and cathode sides by mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850S, Brooks Instrument GmbH, Germany). A high over-stoichiometric flow of λ ≈ 100 (0.2 A cm−2, 80 °C) was chosen to suppress channel effects. Current densities in the mA range required precise current and voltage control, which was achieved using a potentiostat (Biologic SP-300, Bio-Logic Science Instruments SAS, France) with a current resolution of <100 nA and a voltage resolution of 1 μV. A LabVIEW-based program was used as an user interface.
Materials
Commercial, state-of-the-art catalysts were used on purpose for the preparation of catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs). The OER state-of-the-art catalyst was based on 75 wt% IrO2 supported on TiO2 (MA-292, Umicore®).
The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing the catalyst powder with a mixture of ultrapure water, 2-propanol, and 5 wt% Nafion dispersion (aliphatic alcohol/water, EW = 1100 g mol−1, DuPont). The Nafion ionomer content relative to the total weight of the electrode was adjusted to 11 wt%.13 The suspension was homogenized by 45 min ultrasonication.
Commercial Pt/C (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo) was used for the HER. The cathode catalyst ink was prepared by mixing Pt/C, Nafion ionomer, ultrapure water, and ethanol at an ionomer-to-carbon weight ratio of 0.7. The mixtures were finely dispersed by 30 min ultrasonication.
Nafion membranes (Nafion® 115, Chemours, USA) were boiled in MilliQ DI water (16 MΩ cm) for 1 h and then dried for 12 h in a controlled environment. Commercially available Ti powder sintered filters (SIKA T10, GKN Sinter Metals Filters GmbH, Germany) with a nominal thickness of 0.1 cm were used as porous transport layers for all measurements. PTLs were sonicated in an acetone/DI water (1:4, v/v) mixture for 30 min, further sonicated in DI water for 20 min (two times), and finally dried at room temperature.
Automated spray-coating
The dried pre-treated membranes were fixed in an in-house-designed membrane holder with an active area of 2 × 2 cm2. An automated programmable benchtop coating system (ExactaCoat, SONO TEC Corporation, USA) was used for CCM preparation, providing high consistency and reproducibility. Separate lines for IrO2/TiO2 and Pt/C inks were used to inhibit contamination. Between the spray-coating of different inks, the ultrasonic spray nozzle was cleaned by repetitive purging with DI water. Catalyst loading was monitored online by placing a reference check sheet with defined dry weight and active area next to the membrane. The actual CCM loading was determined based on the ink composition and the weight of the check sheet during spray coating. The Pt loading of the cathodic catalyst layer was fixed at 0.50 ± 0.05 mg cm−2 and realized by 16 spray-coating runs. The variable IrO2 loading of 1.0–3.0 mg cm−2 was realized by deposition of 10–30 sprayed layers. Subsequently, the CCMs were dried for 12 h under ambient conditions. The quality of the manufacturing process was evaluated by characterizing the relation between the number of sprayed layers and catalyst loading. The above analysis revealed linear spray coating rates of 0.03 mgPt run−1 and 0.1 mgIr run−1 for Pt/C and IrO2/TiO2 inks, respectively. Catalyst layer morphology as well as particle distribution and secondary agglomerate size were monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Topological and cross-sectional images showed a homogenous and porous percolation structure with agglomerate sizes of 200–600 nm (Fig. 8).

Test protocol
CCMs were conditioned in two steps. After assembly, the cell was flushed on the anode and cathode sides for 10 min with 1 ln min−1 nitrogen at 120% RH and 50 °C for inertization. Then, leak tests at pressures of up to 2 bar were performed before switching to the H2/N2 configuration. The second step involved a potential ramp from open-circuit voltage (OCV) to 2.6 V and back to OCV in potentiostatic mode using 0.1 V steps with a 3 min holding time at 50 °C and 1.1 bar. The above procedure was repeated twice. Subsequently, the cell was stabilized at 2.0 V for >12 h at 95% RH, 50 °C, and 1.1 bar in the symmetric RH configuration.
For kinetic analysis, polarization curves were recorded in galvanostatic mode at current densities of 1–10 mA cm−2 using 1 mA cm−2 steps. Every measurement step included three EIS measurements between 50 Hz and 100 kHz for HFR determination. The holding time of all measurement points was set to 3 min. Generally, the quasi-steady state was achieved within the first 2 min. The last minute of measurements was averaged for data and statistical analysis. Low current densities <0.01 A cm−2 and a high cathodic platinum loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 are employed to limit cathode polarization to values ≪5 mV48 (<∼1% of the total cell voltage), whereas high current densities of e.g. 500 mA cm2 would result in ∼50 mV.48 This enables accurate OER kinetic characterization.
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded at 1.1 bar in H2/N2 at a symmetric cell RH of 95%. In the beginning, the cell was conditioned with 15 cycles at 50 mV s−1 from 0.08 to 1.5 V. The final CV was recorded at a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1. To probe the correlation of loading and apparent exchange current density as well as CV double layer charge, several CCMs with loadings of 1.0–3.0 mg cm−2 were manufactured by automated spray-coating. CVs recorded for loadings of 1.0–3.0 mg cm−2 at 70 °C and 20 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 9. Characterization of the double layer at potentials of 0.4–1.2 V revealed a constant increase of specific oxidation and reduction charge with increasing loading, in line with spray-coating results.

Broader context
The fluctuating nature of renewable (e.g., wind and solar) energy sources and their increasing market share necessitate the implementation of large and clean energy storage systems, which commonly employ the power-to-gas process, i.e., use electrolysis to convert excess electric energy to hydrogen for storage. Although polymer electrolyte water electrolysis complies with the essential requirements of dynamic operation and high power density, the techno-economic relevance of this technology is strongly bound to its electrochemical efficiency and high loadings of expensive Pt-group metal catalysts (e.g. Ir oxide) used to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which make electrolysis economically less viable. Thus, the selective tuning and optimization of OER catalyst properties are tasks of high practical significance, requiring knowledge of the underlying reaction mechanism and the rate determining step for successful realization. In polymer electrolyte fuel cell science, profound knowledge of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has guided the broad development of novel catalysts with extremely high activities. Conversely, the field of water electrolysis is characterized by a lack of in-depth and reliable characterization of OER catalysts such as Ir oxide, which hinders the further development of highly efficient novel catalysts.
