    , Accepted 4th January 2023First published on 10th January 2023AbstractPhotosynthesis has been shown to be a highly efficient process for energy transfer in plants and bacteria. Like natural photosynthetic systems, the artificial light harvesting complex (LHC) BODIPY pillar[5]arene exhibits Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). However, extensive characterisation of the BODIPY pillar[5]arene LHC to determine its suitability as an artificial LHC has yet to occur. In this paper we experimentally and computationally investigate the photophysical properties of the LHC by comparing the light absorption of the BODIPY LHC to individual BODIPY chromophores. Our results show evidence for quantum coherence, with oscillation frequencies of 100 cm−1 and 600 cm−1, which are attributable to vibronic, or exciton–phonon type coupling. Computational analysis suggests strong couplings of the molecular orbitals of the LHC resulting from the stacking of neighbouring BODIPY chromophore units. Interestingly, we find a 40% reduction in the absorbance of light for the BODIPY LHC compared to the individual chromophores which we attribute to electronic interactions between the conjugated π-systems of the BODIPY chromophores and the pillar[5]arene backbone.
Introduction
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, recent research has focused on the development of artificial light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) to mimic the photosynthetic process of nature.1 Photosynthesis in natural systems uses Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for energy transport to the reaction centre.2 FRET is influenced by the distance between the chromophores, the spectral overlap between the fluorescence emission of the donor chromophore and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor chromophore, the lifetime of the excited state, and the relative geometric structure of the transition dipole moments of the chromophores.3 The potential for artificial LHCs to be utilised as solar cells has been explored by considering the photophysical properties of the chromophores.4,5 One such chromophore studied extensively is the BODIPY chromophore.6,7 Previous characterisation of the photophysical properties of the BODIPY chromophore have been determined using absorption, fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy.7,8 Further studies have involved linking BODIPY units together to increase the absorption range over the visible spectrum.7,9 BODIPY macrocycles have been proposed as an efficient artificial photosynthetic antenna with the properties of covalent and non-covalent forms characterised.10 A cyclic tri-BODIPY compound was shown to be a suitable artificial photosynthetic antenna due to the presence of exciton coupling between BODIPY subunits.11 BODIPY has also been shown to improve photon absorption in solar cells when included as a donor molecule. The power conversion efficiency of solar cells including BODIPY subunits as donors have improved from 1.7% in 2009 to, more recently, 7% in 2020.6,12,13 The energy transfer efficiency for LHCs consisting of 2 BODIPY molecules was found to be 76%. This efficiency increased to 94% upon the addition of 2 BODIPY molecules to the LHC.14 However, such studies utilised a small number of chromophores compared to those present in natural LHCs.
In natural photosynthetic systems, the presence of multiple chromophores increases the cross-section of molecules available for light-harvesting thus allowing efficient energy transfer to the reaction centre.15–17 It has been proposed that the presence of multiple chromophores in close proximity allows natural photosynthetic systems to exhibit quantum coherence.18 Purple bacteria are examples of natural photosynthetic units and therefore provide a model from which to construct an artificial light-harvesting complex.19,20 The LHCs of purple bacteria are often composed of two LHCs, LH1 and LH2. LH1 forms a ring-structure around the LH1-reaction centre complex while smaller-sized LH2 LHCs form a ring-like structure around the LH1-reaction centre complex.20,21 Purple bacteria have been shown to exhibit quantum coherence due to strong coupling between the chlorophyll molecules present within the LHCs.22
To resemble the structure of natural LHCs more closely, recent research into artificial LHCs has considered the use of dendrimers to funnel light from the chromophores located at the surface of the dendrimer to the core of the dendritic structure.7,20,23 The branching structure of dendrimers allows for the photon energy absorbed by the chromophores on the surface of the dendrimer to converge to the centre of the artificial LHC.24 This energy can then be transferred to a reaction centre. Pillararenes are examples of compounds for use as dendrimers which, in addition to providing a rigid electron rich centre core, also give the advantage of being symmetrical and easy to functionalise.25 Such properties allow for multiple chromophores to be bound to the benzene rings of the pillararenes.23,25 One such example is the BODIPY pillar[5]arene complex, composed of 10 BODIPY chromophores attached to a pillar[5]arene backbone, which like purple bacteria has been shown to exhibit FRET.22,23 However, unlike purple bacteria and from our knowledge to date, the presence of quantum coherence in an artificial photosynthetic system such as the BODIPY pillar[5]arene has yet to be established. As BODIPY is an effective chromophore as part of an artificial LHC due to its properties of absorption over the visible spectrum and energy transfer, we consider searching for quantum coherences in the BODIPY pillar[5]arene complex.8,23,26 In this paper we compare the light absorption properties of the BODIPY pillar[5]arene LHC to the individual BODIPY chromophores. In addition to performing absorption spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy, we perform broadband pump probe spectroscopy (BBPP) and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to compare the coherences present between the BODIPY chromophores and the LHC. Further analysis of our experimental results is performed by considering time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).
Methods
BODIPY – bearing pillar[5]arene synthesis
All 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the compounds were carried out on a Varian 400 instrument (standard trimethylsilane) at 298 K in CDCl3. The FT-IR spectra of the compounds were collected by a Bruker Fourier Transform Infrared (attenuated total reflection). The elemental analysis and the melting points were measured with Leco CHNS 932 and the Gallenkamp instruments, respectively. Target compounds were synthesised under an argon atmosphere and were prepared using a known literature procedure.5 The synthetic details and data are provided in the ESI.† In the synthesis of the chromophore (Fig. 1), dichloromethane dried with CaH2 was used. The completing processes of the reactions were tracked with Merck TLC plates (silica gel 60 on aluminum plate). Triethylamine, lithium bromide, carbon tetraiodide, boron trifluoride ethyl etherate, paraformaldehyde, triphenylphosphine, sodium azide, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and other solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, TCI Chemicals, Merck, and used without further purification.
Absorption spectroscopy
After performing a control experiment to show that the absorption spectra of two separate solutions can be summed to give the absorption spectra of the summed concentration (see ESI†), solutions of the LHC, chromophore and pillar, each in dichloromethane, were prepared at concentrations of 3 μM, 30 μM and 3 μM respectively. The chosen concentrations ensure the molar ratio of chromophore to pillar (10:1) is satisfied. Each solution was analysed in the Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption data were collected on a commercial spectrometer (Helios, Ultrafast Systems). The pump and probe laser pulses were sourced from the 800 nm output of a Ti–sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Pro XP 100F, Spectra Physics) with ∼150 fs pulse duration and a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The 400 nm pump was produced by frequency doubling in a BBO crystal, with pulse energy of 0.25 μJ and a spot size of ∼0.6 mm. No significant power-dependence of the transient absorption dynamics was observed at this excitation density. The white-light probe was generated by focussing a small portion of the amplifier output on to a 3 mm thick sapphire, with a spot size of ∼0.15 mm and a pulse energy ∼1000 times lower than the pump. The polarisation of the pump was rotated to the magic angle (54.7°) relative to the probe to negate effects of anisotropy. Samples were measured in a 2 mm path-length quartz cuvette (21-Q-2, Starna Cells), and diluted in acetone until the maximum absorbance was below 0.6. No photodegradation of the samples was observed over the duration of the experiments.
Broadband pump–probe spectroscopy
Broadband pump–probe (BBPP) experiments were conducted on a home-built 2-dimensional electronic spectrometer described in detail in a previous publication.27 Briefly, the 800 nm output of the Ti–sapphire regenerative amplifier was used to pump a home-built non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with its central wavelength tuned to ∼540 nm. The NOPA output was then compressed using a single-grating and single-prism compressor to give laser pulses close to the transform limit with bandwidth of 27 nm and a duration of 24 fs (ESI†). A diffractive optic element split the beam into the pump and probe. The pump and probe therefore had identical characteristics, except that the probe was then attenuated by 4 orders of magnitude using a neutral density filter. The pump arrival time was changed relative to the probe using a pair of rotating optical flats, which allowed for up to ∼800 fs of delay with sub-fs precision. The intensity of the probe was detected and spectrally resolved using a spectrograph (Shamrock SR303i, Andor) and CCD camera (Newton 970, Andor). The pump was modulated with a chopper wheel to provide data as the change in probe intensity, ΔI. Samples were measured in a 1 mm path-length cuvette (21-Q-1, Starna Cells) and diluted in acetone until the maximum absorbance was below 0.6.

Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy
The two-dimensional electronic spectrometer is described in detail in a previous publication.27 The laser source was the same Ti–sapphire-pumped non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) as used for the BBPP experiments, with the pulse characterisation shown in the ESI.† The three excitation beams and the local oscillator (LO) were arranged in the boxcars geometry, and the relative delays between the excitation pulses controlled using pairs of rotating optical flats. The pulse energy was 15 nJ per excitation pulse, and the local oscillator was further attenuated by four orders of magnitude. Spot sizes were 25 μm FWHM. The coherence time, τ, was stepped between −45 fs and +45 fs in 0.25 fs increments, where the negative or positive values provided the non-rephasing or rephasing parts of the data, respectively. The population time, T, was stepped between 0 fs and 450 fs in 10 fs increments. The signal was emitted collinear with the local oscillator and detected interferometrically using a spectrograph (Shamrock SR303i, Andor) and CCD camera (Newton 970, Andor). Following transformations, the 2D data was phased using the projection slice theorem using the BBPP data of the same sample.28
Computational methods
To better understand the lowered absorbance upon attaching the chromophore and pillar to the LHC centre, the UV-visible absorption behaviour of these components was probed using computational chemistry methods. Unless otherwise stated, all calculations were carried out using Q-Chem 5.2.29 The geometry of isolated fragment molecules as shown in Table 2 were first optimised using the ωB97X-D functional with the cc-pVDZ basis set.30 The effect of the solvent environment was included using the conductor-like polarisation continuum model (CPCM) with dielectric constant parameter for dichloromethane, ε = 8.93.31 A total of 30 vertical singlet–singlet excitation energies were determined using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the ωB97X-D functional and the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set, and the corresponding natural transition orbitals (NTOs) were plotted to provide a chemically intuitive picture of the electronic excitation.32
Results and discussion
Absorption spectroscopy
The results obtained from performing UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy are illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the pillar + chromophore spectrum shown in red is the sum of the pillar and chromophore absorption spectra. The spectra of the chromophore and LHC are normalised to the peak of the pillar + chromophore spectrum. The absorption peak location at 532 nm for the LHC and chromophore are equivalent to those obtained in a previous publication.23 An extra shoulder is present at ∼500 nm for both the LHC and chromophore. This extra shoulder is due to the presence of an extra vibrational quantum for the S0–S1 electronic transition. However, the shoulder is slightly more prominent in the LHC, but is not significant enough to conclude that there is any substantial aggregate formation. Fig. 2 also illustrates the presence of an absorption peak at ∼280 nm, which is attributable to the pillar moiety. The peak of the pillar is less prominent in the LHC absorption spectrum which is to be expected because the electronics of the pillar structure in the LHC are disrupted by the covalent attachment to the backbone and chromophore. The ESI† provides a comparison of the absorbance at 532 nm for the pillar + chromophore spectra and the LHC spectra. Interestingly, a 40% reduction in absorbance is evident for the LHC compared with the chromophore. The observed reduction in absorbance is more prominent than what was observed for the control experiment discussed in the ESI† warranting further investigation into the cause of this reduction.

Transient absorption spectroscopy

Fig. 3 shows the transient absorption kinetics of both the chromophore and LHC after 400 nm excitation. The 525 nm probe wavelength corresponds to the ground-state bleach band of the molecules, which monitors the depletion of the ground-state population due to the presence of excited or other species. Any ground-state optical excitation of the material to a higher energy state (Sn ← S0) is expected to rapidly relax down to S1, thus the 525 nm probe of this ground-state bleach is a good measure of the presence and lifetime of all excited species, even if higher-energy excitation wavelengths are used. The ground-state bleach kinetics shown in Fig. 3 were fitted to a multiexponential decay model with parameters given in Table 1. The longest time constant, τ2, is approximately 4 ns for both materials, which corresponds to ∼95% recovery after 12 ns. The kinetics of the two molecules are quite similar, dominated by a simple exponential decay. Interestingly, the peak magnitude of the bleach signal does not occur immediately after the initial excitation, but evolves in over ∼30 ps, and is more evident in the kinetics of the chromophore. This feature is unrelated to spectral evolution, such as red shifting of the absorption peak, as the spectral shape remaining effectively constant over the lifetime of the experiment (ESI†). This subtle change may be attributed to a solvation effect, where the solvent molecules rearrange due to the changed transition dipole moment of the excited species.33 The more crowded nature of the LHC configuration restrict access by solvent molecules to the individual chromophore units, which can explain the reduced effect in the LHC compared to the free chromophores in solution. Recovery from the ground-state bleaching is marginally faster in the LHC, and is consistent with the time-resolved fluorescence data shown in the ESI.† The faster decay can be explained by the complex having more non-radiative relaxation pathways, such as vibrational degrees of freedom.

Broadband pump–probe spectroscopy
BBPP data and frequency analysis for the LHC are presented in Fig. 4. In these experiments, the pump and probe laser pulses are identical, having both short (∼24 fs) duration and sufficient bandwidth to excite the molecules to superposition states (ESI†). The presence of superposition states is evidenced by oscillations in the signal as a function of time, with a frequency, ω, related to the difference in energy of the states by E = ħω.

Kinetic slices through the raw BBPP data for the chromophore and LHC are presented in the ESI,† where distinct oscillatory signals are observed. Frequency analysis was performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with respect to the pump–probe delay time to reveal oscillation frequencies as a function of detection wavelength, as shown in Fig. 4b. The frequency analysis of the chromophore and LHC are summarised and compared in Fig. 5. We note that analysis was also conducted on the neat acetone solvent (ESI†) to confirm that the signals observed at 800 cm−1 are due to the solvent and thus can be ignored.
 Fig. 5  Frequency analysis of the BBPP data for the chromophore, LHC and neat acetone solvent. The mean of the 528 nm to 555 nm wavelength range is used for each sample. 
The frequency analysis of the BBPP data shown in Fig. 5 reveals that both the chromophore and LHC exhibit coherences around 600 cm−1 and 100 cm−1, with no significant differences observed between the two samples. Given that the oscillations are present in the chromophore solution alone, the origin of these coherences can be isolated to the individual chromophore units, rather than interactions between the chromophore units in the LHC, or the chromophore and pillar. The 600 cm−1 frequency is consistent with a vibrational mode of the chromophore core, and is observed in the IR spectra presented in the ESI† for both the chromophore and LHC. The 100 cm−1 signal is too low in energy to be resolved with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, but is likely associated with its substituent groups.34 As the BBPP experiments were carried out at room temperature, any electronic coherences are expected to be very short-lived, and not persistent for the ps timescales observed in the data. The observed coherences can therefore be attributed to impulsive Raman scattering, revealing the presence of a vibrational mode which is coupled to the electronic transition of the chromophore. In these vibronic, or exciton–phonon type couplings, the vibrational modes of the molecule are associated with the geometry change between the molecule's ground and excited electronic states. It should be noted that very similar BBPP data between the chromophore and LHC were obtained, which suggests that the presence of electronic couplings between the chromophore units or the pillar cannot be distinguished. One reason for this is that the signals associated with these couplings may be outside the detection capabilities of the instrument. The frequency analysis by Fourier transform is limited in the low-frequency range by the available pump–probe delay range, and high-frequency range and resolutions is primarily limited by the duration of the laser pulses used. If additional couplings are present, the observed signals may be within the spectral detection capabilities of the instrument, but outside of the frequency range or resolution capabilities. The pump and probe laser bandwidth targets the low-energy electronic transitions of the chromophore, covering only the ground-state bleach and stimulated emission bands. The resolution of coherences is limited at high frequencies by the 24 fs laser pulse duration, and at low frequencies by the maximum available pump–probe delay time of ∼1 ps. In an attempt to better understand the nature of the oscillations, we performed 2DES experiments on the LHC.
Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy
The results from the two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) experiment on the LHC are presented as a ESI† Video file. A single time slice is presented in Fig. 6. The total-real panel is the sum of the real parts of the rephasing and non-rephasing parts of the data, and corresponds to the absorptive component of the data. The total-real peak shape is elongated vertically due to the presence of a ground-state bleach signal on the diagonal, and an off-diagonal stimulated emission signal at a lower detection energy.
 Fig. 6  2DES of the LHC at T = 150 fs. The left, central and right columns show the real parts, imaginary parts, and magnitude of the complex matrices, respectively. The central and bottom rows are the separate rephasing and non-rephasing components, with the top row showing their sum total. The upper-left panel is therefore the total real, and represents the absorptive signal from the sample. 
Oscillatory signals are present in both the rephasing and non-rephasing (and thus also the total) parts of the data with frequencies matching those observed in the BBPP data. Note that “collapsing” the total-real data by summation along the excitation wavelength axis should theoretically produce identical data to the BBPP experiment.28 As noted by Turner et al., the presence of oscillations in the non-rephasing parts of the data confirms there is some contribution from vibrational coherences, but the presence of electronic coherences cannot be confirmed nor ruled out.35
Computational methods
In order to gain further insight into the inter-chromophore interactions in the LHC, we turn to quantum chemical calculations. While the vibrational mode responsible for the quantum coherence in the LHC can be identified from theoretical calculations, such calculations assume optimised geometry. Without this optimisation, an offset in the modes can occur increasing the likelihood of incorrectly identifying a vibrational mode. As the BODIPY LHC is too large, theoretical calculations of the vibrational frequencies on this macromolecule has not been performed. The chromophore, pillar and LHC have been truncated to ease computational methods without significantly affecting their electronic properties. The results of the TD-DFT calculation for the isolated chromophore-T, pillar-T, and the chromophore–pillar adduct chromophore–pillar-T are shown in Table 2 (the -T suffix we employ refers to the truncated forms). We note that TD-DFT calculated vertical excitation energies for BODIPY dyes are usually overestimated compared to experimental values, however the more accurate SAC-CI and CASPT2 methods are overly demanding for the size of this molecule.36 Conventional generalised gradient approximated (GGA) density functionals yield lower mean absolute errors for vertical excitation energies but provide incorrect natural transition orbital (NTOs), thus the ωB97X-D range-separated hybrid density functional with empirical dispersion corrections was adopted. For chromophore-T, 12 harmonic vibrations within the 600 ± 100 cm−1 oscillation are observed (see ESI†). It is however not possible to determine which vibrational modes are responsible for the large vibronic coupling as the number of analyses required for each excited state is computationally demanding. It is worth noting that such calculations would not provide any information on whether the chromophore aggregation affects the absorption spectra.

The lowest energy excitation in chromophore–pillar-T was calculated to be at 418.5 nm, similar to that of the isolated chromophore-T. There is only one NTO pair for each excitation for chromophore–pillar-T, with an amplitude above 90%, which indicates little electronic coupling between chromophore-T and pillar-T when combined. The oscillator strengths for the 416.3 nm excitation in chromophore-T and the 418.5 nm excitation in chromophore–pillar-T are 0.8785 and 0.8680, respectively. Thus, the binding of the pillar to the chromophore moiety should have no effect on the absorbance.
The TD-DFT results for chromophore-T, pillar-T and chromophore–pillar-T suggest that the drop in absorbance is unrelated to the coupling of their excited states as the chromophore binds the pillar. We then considered the overall structure of the LHC macromolecule, to see what other effects could influence the non-additivity of UV-Vis absorbance in the chromophore. The overall LHC was constructed and optimised using the GFN2-xTB program, using a semi-empirical tight binding GFN2 Hamiltonian along with the analytical linearised Poisson–Boltzmann solvent model using parameters for dichloromethane as a solvent.37 From the optimised structure, four π-stacked dimeric chromophore moieties can be identified as labelled in Fig. 7.

The structure of dimer 4 was isolated for further TD-DFT analysis to understand the UV-Vis absorption of the LHC theoretically. Methyl groups were used to end-cap the phenoxyl end of the pillar in dimer 4, and the resultant structure is shown schematically in Fig. 8. The structure of dimer 4 was then optimised, and TD-DFT calculations carried out in the same manner as used for chromophore-T, pillar-T, and chromophore–pillar-T to determine the nature of the excitations from the ground state. Results of these calculations are presented in Table 3. It can be seen that the excited state is a delocalised state which qualitatively can be considered representative of the absorption observed in Fig. 2. A comparison of chromophore–pillar-T and dimer 4 excitations show that the 418.5 nm absorption for chromophore-T is split into two excitations at 420.8 nm and 411.1 nm for the dimer. The oscillator strengths per chromophore for these excitations decrease slightly from 0.8680 for chromophore–pillar-T to 0.0214 and 0.8360 in dimer 4. The 322.3 nm HOMO−2 → LUMO absorption for the chromophore corresponds to two excitations (Exc. 3, 4 in Table 3) in the dimer, with wavelengths of 324.9 nm and 323.2 nm. Oscillator strengths decrease significantly from 0.1361 for the chromophore to 0.0059 and 0.0060 for the dimer. The NTOs of these excitations show their charge transfer nature and thus can partially explain the lower absorbance observed experimentally. The MO contributions for these NTOs involve the strongly coupled HOMO of both chromophores, which are shown in Fig. 9 as a visual guide. Formation of π-stacked dimers in the overall LHC could result in charge transfer excited states with lowered oscillator strengths that should show up as lowered absorbance.

Conclusion and outlook
This work highlights some of the challenges involved with producing artificial LHCs analogous to those found in nature. In the case of the LHC studied in this work, the pillar structure required to place the chromophore units in close proximity resulted in a reduction in absorbance by approximately 40%, which was attributed to the formation of π-stacked dimers in the LHC. On the other hand, it is positive to note that other optical properties of the chromophore, such as the absorption spectrum and excited-state lifetime, were effectively unchanged due to the tethering to the pillar structure. This indicates that the properties of an artificial LHC can be engineered primarily through the selection of the chromophore units, with the linkages and backbone playing predominantly only a structural role.
