Nonetheless, an amorphous and coarse surface film is one of the main obstructions to the performance of these small molecule HTLs. Herein, a small molecule, namely, N,N′-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB) was doped with a polymer to overcome the formation of molecular aggregation in an HTL. This polymer doping strategy resulted in a very smooth surface, which improved the photo-physical and electrochemical properties at the HTL/perovskite interface. Consequently, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.80%, 32% higher than that of the control, i.e., the NPB-based device (13.57%), has been achieved. This study reveals the critical influence of molecular aggregations on the performance of perovskite solar cells, which impairs the development of an efficient device based on small molecule HTLs.
1. Introduction
During the last decade, metal halide based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been in the spotlight due to their promising photovoltaic properties in a variety of device structures.1–3 Till now, the best reported performance of PSCs has reached a certified power conversion efficiency(PCE) of over 25%.4 Nevertheless, the fabrication of mesoporous PSCs needs a high annealing temperature (≥500 °C), which retards the development of this emerging flexible module and PSC-based monolithic tandem devices.5 To overcome this issue, researchers have developed a planar PSC structure with a p-i-n and n-i-p (SnO2-based ETL) structure that requires low-temperature (typically ≤150 °C) solution-processed charge-selective layers.6–8 Nonetheless, the performance of these planar-structured devices is usually less than that of mesoporous devices.9,10 In this regard, numerous striking investigations have already been reported, including various manufacturing techniques11–13 and interface engineering techniques,7,10,14–16 for achieving better performance of the planar structured devices.
Large grain size, crystal orientation, and morphological defects of the perovskite layer, which are critically dependent on the under layer (HTL), are some of the key factors affecting the PSC performance.17,18 This confirms that the selection of HTLs (e.g. polymer and small molecule) in PSCs is an essential for realizing high performance devices. For example, Zheng et al. achieved 21% PCE by using a polymer HTL poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) along with interfacial modification in the p-i-n PSC.7 However, small molecule-based HTLs, rather than organic polymers, have well defined molecular weights, and are versatile with respect to the property tuning (hydrophobicity, film morphology, etc.) and demonstrate high batch-to-batch consistency in not only the synthesis and purification but also in device fabrication.19,20 Recently, phenylamine groups containing small molecules have attracted much attraction because of their high hole mobilities and easy dissolution in common organic solvents. For example, Wang et al. used 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl) benzenamine] (TAPC) as an HTL in the p-i-n PSCs with the highest PCE of 18.8%, thus exemplifying the high capacity of small molecule HTLs in PSCs.21 In addition, another phenylamine group containing the organic small molecule NPB22 has been widely used as an HTL in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with good hole mobility of about 1 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, Kim et al. for the first time used this small molecule HTL in PSCs through a thermal evaporation technique that greatly improved the device Voc, which led to the highest and average PCE values of 13.7% and 11.1%, respectively.23 This NPB HTL film can also be fabricated by spin coating,24,25 but a highly rough and non-uniform surface is formed after thermal annealing,26,27 which is a big hurdle in the way of better performance of NPB based PSC devices. Despite possessing all the above properties, PSCs based on small molecule HTLs still display lower performance in comparison with those based on polymer HTLs. The most common reason for the lower performance of organic small molecule HTLs is their amorphous film formation ability compared to polymer-based HTLs.19,28–30
We successfully resolved this issue by using a polymeric doping strategy for small molecule based HTLs, which led to improved overall PSC performance. This doping strategy was first used in organic thin-film transistors to improve the electronic properties and enhance the nanomorphology of the blend film.8,31 Recently, this doping strategy has been applied on TPAC as the small molecule HTL in PSCs, which improved the performance of the device to 21%.32 In this study, NPB was used as an HTL. This small molecule was doped with a polymer (PTAA), which efficiently overcame the molecular aggregations in the NPB HTL, thus leading to a very smooth surface and better energy level alignment with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite by a solution processing technique. As a result, the interfacial charge transfer ability at the NPB/CH3NH3PbI3 interface was greatly enhanced, which contributed to an increase in the PSC performance from 13.57% to 17.80%. This work opens up an effective way for producing solution-processed small molecule HTLs with desirable surface morphology in PSCs as well as in OLEDs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Working mechanism
Polymers are well known to form films of good quality using a solution processing technique owing to their extended chain formation abilities in dilute solutions. These extended chains entangle with each other as the solvent dries out during the spin coating process. Unlike polymers, small molecules show no entanglement because of the lack of extended chain formation ability in solution; only the packing density can be changed. Therefore, small molecules form very coarse surfaces after evaporation of the solvent. Fig. 1 shows the structural and graphical schematics of the NPB film formation processes with and without the PTAA dopant. Specifically, the dissolution of the small molecule was supported by the presence of phenyl and methyl groups in the polymer chain, which contribute to two types of molecular interactions.30 First is the π–π stacking interaction occurring between the phenyl/phenyl rings in NPB and PTAA, which helps to generate an extended chain length of the PTAA-doped NPB HTL. The second molecular interaction is C–H⋯π that exists between the methyl groups33 of PTAA and the phenyl rings of the neighbouring NPB. This C–H⋯π interaction thus interlaces with the π–π stacking chains, which results in a packing motif quite similar to the conformation of the polymer chains, thus suppressing the intermolecular aggregation and enhancing the carrier transport.30

2.2 Device optimization
 Fig. 2a and b represent the device configuration of the inverted planar heterojunction PSC used in this study. A 10 nm thin PTAA-doped NPB HTL was spin coated on top of an ITO glass, followed by a 360 nm thick CH3NH3PbI3 layer prepared by a simple 'one step' deposition process. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 40 nm) was used as the electron extraction layer atop the perovskite. Finally, a 100 nm thick aluminium (Al) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The detailed device fabrication is included in the Experimental section (ESI†).

To optimise the amount of PTAA doping, the devices were fabricated using different PTAA doping content in the NPB HTL solution. The characteristic current–voltage (J–V) curves for the full PSCs are displayed in Fig. 2c and their PV performance measured under AM1.5G condition are summarized in Table 1. The control device without PTAA doping showed a PCE of 13.58% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.62 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 70.31%. The device performance steadily improved on increasing the content of PTAA from 0 to 9%, while further addition of PTAA showed no performance boost. Fig. 2d shows the J–V curve of a champion device with 9% PTAA doping, with Voc of 1.06 V, Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2, FF of 80.72%, and an overall PCE of 17.80% measured in the reverse direction. The PCE decreased slightly to 17.08% in the forward direction with Voc, Jsc, and FF of 1.06 V, 20.62 mA cm−2, and 78.16%, respectively. The devices based on the PTAA HTL were also fabricated for comparison and the Voc is 1.06 V, Jsc is 21.00 mA cm−2, FF is 76%, and PCE is 16.89%. The lower performance of the PTAA based devices is ascribed to their lower FF, which might be due to their higher series resistance34 and unideal wettability as compared to the doped NPB small molecule HTL.

 Fig. 2e shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated current densities of the PSCs at 0 and 9% PTAA-doped NPB HTL. A notable improvement in the EQE values was observed throughout the UV-vis range with the corresponding integrated Jsc of 18.27 and 20.59 mA cm−2 at 0 and 9% doping ratio, respectively, which is in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve. Fig. 2f displays the statistical dependence of PCE of 20 PSC devices on NPB (0 and 9% PTAA doped) HTLs, thus unambiguously showing the appreciable improvement with the proper PTAA dopant. In order to investigate the effect of PTAA on the mixed HTL, a combination of morphological, structural, optical, and electrochemical characterization was conducted, which are discussed in the following sections.
2.2 Morphological characterizations
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the PTAA doped NPB HTL in a 5 × 5 μm2 field of view, as shown in Fig. 3. The root mean-square (RMS) value of the pure NPB HTL film was determined to be 12 nm. It decreased to 5, 2.5, 1.4, 0.49, and 0.43 nm after 3%, 5%, 7%, 9% and 11% PTAA doping, respectively. This considerable reduction in the RMS value strongly suggests that the PTAA molecules were well dispersed within the NPB small molecule matrix due to similar repeating unit structure of both the molecules and molecular aggregation was significantly reduced, which led to a flat and smooth surface. The smoothness of the surface continues to improve up to 9%, after which there is no significant change in the RMS value; for e.g., the RMS value was 0.49 nm and 0.43 nm for 9% and 11% PTAA doping, respectively, indicating that at 9% PTAA doping, the morphology reached almost its optimization value so that any further increase in the doping ratio had no obvious effect on the RMS value. Thus, these AFM results support the fact that doping of PTAA into the NPB small molecule efficiently enhances the film uniformity by overcoming the molecular aggregation of the NPB small molecule, which helps to create a better contact between the HTL and the perovskite by mitigating the surface trap states, which results in a better Voc and FF.35,36

To explore the wetting capability of the NPB HTLs, we measured the water contact angle (insets in Fig. 4). The water contact angle of pure NPB HTL was 69° but it increased with increasing PTAA doping content, e.g., it increased to 81° for 9% or 11% doping. The increment in the water contact angle after PTAA doping is possibly due to increasing length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain of the NPB small molecules, which results in the surface being more hydrophobic.37 Thus, the higher water contact angles induced by PTAA doping indicated a reduction in the nucleation sites, which ultimately resulted into larger grain size and improved perovskite layer quality.38,39

 Fig. 4 shows the top view of the SEM images of the perovskite films on NPB HTLs. It is clear that the perovskite films on the doped HTLs show a larger grain size than that of the control film. The average grain size of the perovskite on pure NPB HTL was 380 nm and it increased to 430, 442, 445, 467, and 466 nm after 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11% PTAA doping, respectively. The largest grain size for 9% PTAA doped NPB completely correlates with the best performance of 17.80% of our device. This entails that the carriers can effectively transport across the perovskite films and reach the corresponding electrode interfaces before the recombination occurs.40 The foregoing surface morphologies indicate that PTAA doping into the NPB small molecule can improve the HTL film smoothness and enhance the perovskite grain size as well, which are two important requirements for high performance of PSCs.
2.3 Structural and spectroscopic characterizations
To explore the influence of the PTAA doped small molecule HTL on perovskite crystallization, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) technique was applied. The scattering patterns of the films were collected by a 2D detector, in which the perovskite crystallite orientations are well characterized. Fig. S1 (ESI†) illustrates the GIWAX profiles of the perovskite films including the in-plane Qxy and out-of-plane Qz, where Q = 4πsinθ/λ, with θ as half of the scattering angle and X-ray wavelength λ = 0.124 nm. These strongly scattered pattern rings exhibit that the crystal domains are predominately polycrystalline as reported in the literature41,42 and such crystallographic orientations of the perovskite film remain intact during film fabrication on the control or the doped NPB HTL. Fig. 5a shows the scattering intensities integrated over the scattering vector q, which gives the 1D GIWAX patterns of the perovskite films. The position of the peaks at 1.0, 2.0, and 2.3 Å−1 can be attributed to the (110), (220), and (310) lattice planes, respectively, and are in the same positions for all the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, which confirms that all of the perovskite peaks have tetragonal crystal structures.43 However, the perovskite film coated on the doped HTLs exhibits sharper and stronger peaks as compared to the pure NPB HTL, thus indicating better crystallinity and highly ordered perovskite crystals with lower defects in the NPB doped perovskite films. Moreover, it was found that the perovskite thin films based on the doped NPB HTL show a larger crystal size as compared to the pure NPB film, as shown in Fig. 5b. Notably, PTAA doped at 9% shows comparatively stronger intensity around the (110) plane, indicating that the perovskite crystals’ formation on the surface has a higher orientation compared to the control and other PTAA doped NPB HTLs.

To investigate the effect of PTAA doping on the energy level of the NPB small molecule, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed. Fig. 5c and Fig. S2 (ESI†) show the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the mixed HTLs, which reveals that the energy levels of the NPB HTL after 0 to 11% PTAA doping change the HOMO of the NPB to 5.39, 5.40, 5.41, 5.44, 5.46, and 5.38 eV, respectively. The highest energy level offset obtained at 11% PTAA doping between the valence band of the perovskite and the HOMO level of the mixed HTL is the main cause of decrease in the performance beyond 9% PTAA doping. This variation in the HOMO levels of the mixed HTL suggests an orientation change of NPB, as it has already been proved that the energy level of the organic thin film is largely influenced by change in the molecular orientation.32,44 So, the 9% PTAA doped NPB energetically agrees well with the CH3NH3PbI3 film, demonstrating efficient charge transfer between the perovskite and the mixed NPB HTL. The similarity in the HOMO energy levels also helps to reduce energy losses at the interface contact, which leads to a higher Voc.45,46 Moreover, these UPS results completely support the dependence of Voc on the energy band alignment after PTAA doping into the NPB HTL.
In PSCs, the complete absorption of the solar irradiance is critical for high device performance. Herein, it was observed that the perovskite film morphological improvements induced appreciable enhancement in its UV-visible absorption spectrum. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the UV-visible absorbance spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 on the control and doped NPB films. All the PTAA doped NPB films exhibited better light absorption in the range of 400 to 800 nm as compared to the control NPB film.
The effect of PTAA doping on the hole mobility of the NPB small molecule was investigated by space charge limiting current (SCLC) technique. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the device structure and the J–V curves for SCLC. Herein, the linear part at high bias voltage of the curve represents the SCLC region. According to the Mott–Gurney law9J ∝ Va2, i.e., a larger slope means a higher mobility. We can see that the mobility of the control and 9% PTAA doped NPB samples is 1.56 × 10−3 and 3.62 × 10−3 cm2 s−1, respectively, suggesting that PTAA doping in NPB had a minor effect on the hole mobility.
Furthermore, the efficient charge carrier extraction ability was explored by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy.10 Herein, an ITO/HTL/perovskite structure was used to perform these characterizations. Fig. 6a displays the PL spectra of the perovskite films on pure and PTAA doped NPB HTLs, where a characteristic emission peak at 770 nm can be seen. Moreover, in each case, the PL emission is considerably weaker as compared to that from the pure NPB sample, indicating superior interfacial charge transfer. It is exciting that the PL quenching capability largely depends on the doping ratio, for e.g., the major PL quenching experienced was at 9% PTAA doping. Any further increase in the doping ratio beyond 9% will raise the intensity of the PL curve, which can be due to misalignment of the energy level.47 This obvious quenching exhibits a reduction in the charge recombination, resulting in an improved hole collection ability in the mixed HTLs. Next, the TRPL measurements were performed to further elaborate the lifetime of the charge carrier in pure and doped NPB HTL. The observed TRPL decays were fitted with a bi-exponential decay functionf(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)where τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay time, while A1 and A2 represent the decay amplitude of fast and slow recombination, respectively.48 The fast decay curve component is a result of the charge carriers being quenched by the charge extraction layer and the slow decay curve component originates from the radiative bimolecular recombination.49Fig. 6b displays that the lifetime of the fast decay component decreases from 8 ± 0.058 ns to 5.5 ± 0.091, 5.10 ± 0.061, 4.75 ± 0.089, 4.30 ± 0.06, and 5.18 ± 0.108 ns after 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11% PTAA doping, respectively. The above results advocate fast and efficient hole extraction at the HTL/perovskite interface after PTAA doping,50 which is mainly attributed to the better energy level alignment and also to the better mobility that has been achieved after better crystallization of the doped NPB HTL.51 The results obtained from the optical measurements are clearly dependent on the PTAA-doping ratio. The largest PL quenching as well as the fast decay lifetime observed at 9% doping ratio of PTAA supports the highest hole extraction efficiency. Moreover, the high FF and Jsc further prove the efficient charge transfer and extraction of such a planar p-i-n heterojunction PSCs.

For a detailed understanding of the photo excited charge carrier dynamics in the HTL/perovskite bilayers, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies were performed. Fig. 6c exhibits the pseudo-color TA plot of the differential transmission (ΔT/T) as a function of wavelength and time for the perovskite film. The main ΔT/T peak at ∼750 nm is attributed to the transient photo induced bleaching52–54 and similar peaks are observed in Fig. 6d when the perovskite film is excited at time delays from 0.1 ps to 10000 ps. Moreover, the kinetic decay traces of the photo bleaching features are presented in Fig. 6e, in which the slow rising phase in the TA signal could be the cooling process of hot excitons due to vibrational relaxation.55 The single fitted exponential function represents the comparison of perovskite spectra on pure and doped NPB HTL, which gives valuable information about the charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTLs. The fitted results of the pure NPB based perovskite film show the decay time constant τ = 196.35 ± 1.98 ps but after 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11% PTAA doping, it is efficiently reduced to 193.16 ± 1.62, 177.27 ± 1.01, 167.61 ± 1.12, 164.04 ± 1.26, and 182.08 ± 0.75 ps, respectively. The lowest decay time achieved after 9% PTAA doping suggests strongest electronic coupling between the perovskite and NPB after 9% PTAA doping, which leads to fastest charge transfer between the perovskite and the doped NPB HTL.
To further explore the charge carrier dynamics on the whole perovskite device, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were performed. This powerful technique is very helpful for the investigation of charge transportation properties within the materials and at the PSC interfaces.56–61 The impedance associated with the interfaces can be determined using EIS with a small AC voltage perturbation in the working device and a gradual frequency change from high to low. Fig. 6f shows the Nyquist plot of IS with an equivalent circuit model representing the inner series resistances of the device. Rsheet and Rtranport represent the sheet resistance of the cell and charge carrier transport resistance at the interfaces, respectively. The fitted values of Rsheet are evidently suppressed on PTAA doping from 3.9 (control) to 2.5 Kohm cm2 with 9% PTAA doping, which means that PTAA doping effectively improved the conductivity of the NPB small molecule.62 However, the reduction of Rtransport from 2029 (control) to 129 Kohm cm2 at 9% doping indicates that the PTAA doping strategy accelerates the charge carrier transport and is also helpful in the minimization of energy loss during the charge collection process.63,64 The lowest values of both Rsheet and Rtranport are achieved at 9% doping ratio, and any further increase in the doping ratio increases both the resistances, which is highly consistent with the other results.
2.4 Stability
Low stability is one of the biggest hurdles in PSCs commercialisation. It was noticed that the perovskite device stability on the PTAA doped NPB small molecule was better than that of the pure NPB devices. The stability of the perovskite devices based on the control and doped NPB HTLs was tested under relative humidity of 60% at room temperature for 150 h. The doped NPB HTL based PSCs maintained the initial performance of over 90%, whereas the PCSs using the pure NPB showed a decrease to less than 70%. The assessment of normalized Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the doped and undoped NPB based PSCs are presented in Fig. 7a–d, which shows that the doping of PTAA into NPB significantly improved the perovskite device stability. Compared with the control devices, the doped NPB perovskite solar cells presented better stability against degradation in ambient air after 20 days without encapsulations, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which demonstrates the adaptability of our approach for PSCs. One of the possible reasons for such outstanding ambient air stability could be ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the doped NPB layer.65 The large water contact angle suggests better moisture resistivity of the doped NPB compared to the control NPB. The hydrophobic characteristics of the doped NPB can prevent the penetration of moisture into the perovskite film, which leads to improved stability in ambient conditions.

3. Conclusion
To conclude, we have successfully developed a polymer-small molecule doping strategy to improve the dissolution of small molecules, leading to the prevention of molecular aggregation in its structure, which resulted into the formation of a uniform and smooth HTL with better crystallinity. This polymer doping strategy improves the energy level alignment between the small molecule HTL and the valence band of the perovskite. Therefore, superior charge transfer occurs at the HTL/perovskite interface with reduced charge transport resistance. As a result, a valuable upgradation was achieved for the device Jsc and FF. On increasing the PTAA doping content, the device performance increased up to 9% doping ratio and any further increase in the doping content caused a decline in the device performance. This drop in the performance was mainly due to the energy level offset between the HTL and the perovskite beyond 9% PTAA doping. This strategy enables us to obtain the highest performance of up to 17.80%. This study provides a simple and efficacious protocol to improve the performance of PSCs based on PTAA doped small molecule HTLs.
