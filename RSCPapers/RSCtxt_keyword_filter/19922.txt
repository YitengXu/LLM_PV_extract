    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have recently emerged as highly competitive light absorbing materials for low cost solution-processable photovoltaic devices. With the high efficiency already achieved, removing the toxicity, i.e., lead-free and stability are the key obstacles for perovskite solar cells. Here, we report the synthesis of an antimony (Sb)-based hybrid material having the composition of A3Sb2I9 [A = CH3NH3 (MA), Cs] and an investigation of its potential photovoltaic applications. Sb-based perovskite-like materials exhibited attractive absorbance properties, with the band gaps of MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 measured to be 1.95 and 2.0 eV, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the formation of stoichiometric perovskites from appropriate precursor molar ratios incorporated with hydroiodic acid (HI). Planar hybrid Sb-based solar cells exhibited negligible hysteresis and reproducible power output under working conditions. A power conversion efficiency of 2.04% was achieved by the MA3Sb2I9 perovskite-based device—the highest reported to date for a Sb-based perovskite solar cell.
Introduction
Today's energy demands should continue to rise with continuing population growth and industrialization. Renewable energy is one the best sources of alternative energy to fulfill current and future energy demands while, at the same time, preserving the global environment. Solar energy is the most promising form of available renewable energy. The recent development of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells has led to reports of record efficiencies of over 22%.1,2 The key materials in perovskite solar cells that have recently received so much attention are organometal halides having the structure ABX3 [A = CH3NH3, CH(NH2)2, Cs; B = Pb, Sn; X = I, Cl, Br, SCN].3–6 In particular, organo-lead triiodide (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) perovskites can provide very high charge carrier diffusion lengths (particularly for the mixed halide with Cl; up to >1 μm) and low exciton binding energies (<50 meV), while having very high absorption coefficients and charge carrier mobilities.6–12 Recently, the application of perovskite materials has been extended to light emitting diodes (LEDs),13–17 lasers,18–20 field-effect transistors (FETs),21,22 and photo-detectors,23,24 due to their simple methods of preparation.2,25–29 Nevertheless, one major disadvantage of APbX3 is the lead (Pb), which limits its commercialization because of high toxicity.
A particularly challenging task is to replace the toxic lead in perovskite structures with an alternative, less-toxic element. The most feasible replacements for Pb in MAPbI3 perovskite structures are metals in the same group 14 (e.g., Sn and Ge). Feng Hao et al. were the first to attempt to use a lead-free perovskite, methylammonium tin iodide (CH3NH3SnI3), as a light-absorbing material in the fabrication of solution-processed solid state photovoltaic devices; they achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.73% from a device having the structure FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3SnIBr2/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.30 Nakita K. Noel et al. also reported a lead-free perovskite solar cell based on CH3NH3SnI3 processed on a TiO2 scaffold, reaching a PCE of greater than 6% with a remarkably high open-circuit voltage (0.88 V).31 Other research groups have studied the partial replacement of lead with tin to extend the absorption spectrum up to the near-infrared region.32–35 Unfortunately, Sn2+ readily oxidizes to Sn4+, resulting in much more rapid degradation of tin perovskites than that of lead-based perovskites; the poor stability and reproducibility of tin perovskites limit their practicality.35 Recently, germanium (Ge)36 and copper (Cu)37 have been investigated as replacements for lead in perovskite structures, with reported PCEs of only 0.2 and 0.017%, respectively. Germanium is also a group 14 metal that has a 2+ oxidation state and readily oxidizes to Ge4+, which can act as a p-type dopant within the material. Therefore, the challenge remains to find other materials to form perovskite structures that are stable yet function in solar cells. It is rational to look for elements in the periodic table with similar electronic configuration as Pb2+, as the reason for the phenomenal performance of lead based perovskites is linked to the outermost s electrons in the metal cation. The immediate possibilities in the periodic table are the next group elements Bi and Sb that have the ability to form +3 ions with similar electronic configuration as Pb2+. Hybrid perovskites based on trivalent Sb and Bi should also exhibit semiconducting behavior38–47 while having band structures very similar to those of divalent Sn- and Pb-based compounds. A recent review on alternative solar absorbers for methylammonium lead iodide also discussed about Sb3+ as a possible replacement for Pb2+.44 The perovskites having the structure A3B2X9 display reasonable photovoltaic performance and stability when incorporating trivalent Bi.39 Sb has been used widely in photovoltaic applications with chalcogenides (Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3) to achieve PCEs as high as 6.6% (ref. 40) and recently a Sb-based perovskite based on methylammonium cations showed an efficiency of 0.49% (ref. 41) in planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, but failure of making a crystalline and pin hole free thin film resulted in very low values of short circuit current. Cesium cations were also used to make layered Cs3Sb2I9, which was found to be non-solution processable and requires high temperature for device fabrication.42 Rubidium was also investigated to form solution processable layered Rb3Sb2I9, but the layered form has a disadvantage of choosing orientation along the planes which are parallel to the layers of corner sharing octahedra.43 Such a preferential orientation can hinder the charge transport across the films as the effective masses are higher in the direction perpendicular to the layers.43 The zero dimensional nature of the dimer form of A3Sb2I9 needs to be investigated for use in a solar cell device.
In this paper we report Sb-based metal halide perovskite-like materials having the crystal structure of A3Sb2I9 for application in Pb-free planar perovskite solar cells. Here, we used methylammonium (MA+) and cesium (Cs+) as the cations in the perovskite structure. The perovskite active layer was prepared through a single-step spin-coating process for a conventional perovskite solar cell structure, with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer and PC71BM as the electron transport layer. We have investigated the thin film formation, its crystallization, and optoelectronic properties, and explored the potential of these materials in solar cell applications. The device based on (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 provided the highest PCE (2.04%) under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is the highest reported for a Sb-based perovskite solar cells to date.
Results and discussion
In the extensive family of A3M2X9 structures, the A and X atoms are closest packed and the M atoms occupy 2/3 of the octahedral X6 voids. The Weissenberg photographs explain that (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 crystallizes in the hexagonal system with Laue symmetry 6/mmm and the extinction rules suggest three possible space groups: P63mc, P62c, and P63/mmc.48 The A3Sb2I9 materials comprise bioctahedral anionic metal halide (Sb2I9)3– clusters surrounded by MA+ (or Cs+) cations; Fig. 1a presents the crystal structure of the A3Sb2I9 materials which were integrated into the planar photovoltaic device architecture as shown in Fig. 1b. We prepared mixed solutions of SbI3 and MAI (or CsI) precursors at various molar ratios and then prepared thin films of these materials for analysis through UV visible absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). Single precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrates; the perovskite was then formed upon heating. Full experimental details are provided in the ESI†. Fig. 1c and d present the absorption spectra of the Sb-based perovskite films with and without the HI additive; strong absorption occurred at wavelengths from 300 to 600 nm. An increase in the absorbance for both MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 films with HI has been observed in the visible wavelength regions above 400 nm.

The secondary-electron cut-off (left) and the valence band region (right) are included. 
The optical band gaps of SbI3, MA3Sb2I9, HI-MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 calculated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S1c, ESI†) were 2.60, 2.20, 1.95, 2.30 and 2 eV, respectively. The addition of HI reduced the bandgaps in both Sb-based perovskites due to phase purity and crystallinity which led to enhanced absorption towards higher wavelength regions. Photographs of MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 films with and without the HI additive were included for comparison in Fig. S1d, ESI.†
We used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to measure the valence band (VB) energy levels of the Sb-based perovskite compounds (Fig. 1e and f). The full UPS spectra using He I radiation are provided in Fig. S3a (ESI).† The measured values of the VB of SbI3, MA3Sb2I9, HI-MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 perovskites were 5.86, 5.50, 5.35, 5.60 and 5.40 eV, respectively; from the observed film thicknesses (Fig. S3c and d, ESI†) and optical band gaps, we calculated the energy levels of the conduction bands (CBs) to be 3.26, 3.30, 3.40, 3.30 eV and 3.40, respectively (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The addition of HI resulted in shift of the VB from 5.5 to 5.35 eV in MA3Sb2I9 perovskites which caused its energy level match well with that of PEDOT:PSS, thus enhancing the transport of holes to the electrodes. A similar trend was observed in the Cs3Sb2I9 perovskite as well. The energy band diagram suggests that it might be possible to enhance the device performance by manipulating hybrid donor–acceptor materials with different energy levels. The band gaps of these materials are suitable for their use in semitransparent solar cells, and suggest that they might also be good materials for other optoelectronic applications.
We used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study the fundamental properties of the Sb-based perovskites. Fig. 2a presents the XRD patterns of MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 films with and without the HI additive. The pattern obtained from the MAI-based perovskite film revealed the formation of a hexagonal structure, with the highest intensity peak at a 2θ value of 24.8° corresponding to the (003) plane, revealing preferred growth along the c-axis. The incorporation of the hydroiodic acid additive improved the crystallinity and phase purity to a greater extent which is evident from the higher peak intensities observed. The intensity increased with the increase in the volume of HI added (10 to 30 μl ml−1) but decreased for 40 μl ml−1 (Fig. S4a in the ESI†). It is also to be noted that the peaks have shifted to lower angles of 2θ with the addition of HI which could be due to the fact that dopant HI imparts more iodine ions with a larger ionic radius, thus creating strain on the unit cell dimensions. In the case of Cs3Sb2I9, the characteristic peak at 39.8° clearly increases in intensity with increasing the volume of HI in the perovskite precursor solution confirming better crystallinity and phase purity with the addition of HI. Thus, in both Sb-based perovskites, the crystallinity increases with the addition of HI, as is evident from the XRD spectra. Hence, the incorporation of HI is better than treatment with toluene41 as HI increases the crystallinity to a greater extent whereas toluene treatment led to the films becoming amorphous. Though the layer form of Cs3Sb2I9, which is formed at temperatures of 250–350 °C, is claimed to have better photovoltaic properties,42,49 we report the competitive photovoltaic properties of the dimer form of Cs3Sb2I9, which also has an advantage of low-temperature processability.

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with AlKα radiation to further investigate the perovskite thin films incorporating the HI additive. Fig. 2b presents the survey spectra of the perovskite films, with the corresponding peaks named for each film. Fig. S5 (ESI†) displays the core level peaks for the Sb, I, C, N, and Cs atoms of the perovskite samples. Table 1 presents the estimated I/Sb and Cs/Sb atomic ratios. The estimated I/Sb ratios for the MA3Sb2I9, HI-MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 materials were 4.01, 4.32, 4.14 and 4.67 respectively. The ratio of I/Sb for the HI added Sb-based perovskite is in good agreement with the values suggested by the stoichiometric ratio of 4.5. The Cs/Sb ratio for Cs3Sb2I9 was increased from 1.32 to 1.45 for HI-Cs3Sb2I9 which is closer to the stoichiometric ratio of 4.5. These results confirm the formation of stoichiometric MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9 crystal structures after the adding of an appropriate concentration of the HI additive.

As the perovskite morphology and surface coverage play critical roles in the performance of planar heterojunction solar cells, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the morphologies of the perovskite thin films prepared at various molar ratios (Fig. S6, ESI†) and various additive concentrations (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†); the corresponding explanations are provided in the ESI.† The topography of MA3Sb2I9 was that of a hexagonal thin sheet structure of uniform size with a moderate coverage on the PEDOT:PSS surface comprising of pinholes (Fig. 3a). The incorporation of HI (30 μl ml−1) made the hexagonal structure become indistinct and also reduced the grain size of rod-shaped structures. The uniformity and coverage became high compared to the film without the HI additive as the pinholes are reduced, which resulted in a great enhancement of the film quality (Fig. 3b). The Cs3Sb2I9 perovskite formed a non-continuous film with two different contrasts present on the surface, possibly because of the presence of unreacted CsI or SbI3 during the formation of the perovskite structure upon annealing (Fig. 3c). The formation of pores depends on the interaction energies of the perovskite film with the substrate and the processing conditions. When HI was added, the Cs3Sb2I9 films became less porous and the film quality was greatly enhanced (Fig. 3d). Thus the incorporation of HI played an important role in improving the surface morphology of our A3B2X9 perovskites, which is a critical parameter for achieving better photovoltaic performance.

We fabricated devices having the structure glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Sb-perovskite/PC71BM/C60/BCP/Al and investigated their PV performance. Here, we used PC71BM/C60, a double fullerene layer architecture, to minimize the trap densities. Fig. 4a and b display the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells prepared with and without the HI additive in MA3Sb2I9 and Cs3Sb2I9. Table 2 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The detailed device optimization conditions with different molar ratios of SbI3:MAI, SbI3:CsI and also for different HI additive concentrations are provided in the ESI (Fig. S9 and S10†); the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table S1 and S2 (ESI†). A molar ratio of 0.5:1 (SbI3:MAI) for MA3Sb2I9 without any additive yielded the best PCE of 1.11%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.64 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 45.52%. A lower molar ratio of 0.4:1 gave a PCE of 0.2%; a higher molar ratio of 0.6:1 has a PCE of 0.48%. The highest PCE was achieved at a molar ratio of 0.5:1 because of the better film coverage and the formation of a uniform hexagonal microplate perovskite structure (Fig. S6b1, ESI†). The other two molar ratios resulted in poorer film coverage and non-uniform crystal sizes, leading to poorer PCEs. Fig. S9b (ESI)† reveals the device performance in the case of the Cs3Sb2I9 perovskites prepared at various SbI3:CsI molar ratios. A molar ratio of 0.2:1 yielded the best PCE of 0.67%, with a Jsc of 2.34 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.62 V, and a FF of 46.18%. A lower molar ratio of 0.1:1 gave a PCE of 0.17%; a higher molar ratio of 0.3:1 gave a PCE of 0.21%. With the addition of HI, the device performance was boosted enormously achieving ∼84% improvement for MA3Sb2I9 devices and ∼25% improvement for Cs3Sb2I9 devices. Different volumes of HI (10, 20, 30, and 40 μl ml−1) were added to the perovskite precursor solution 1 hour before the perovskite film deposition. The HI (30 μl ml−1)-MA3Sb2I9 devices exhibited a superior performance achieving a champion efficiency of 2.04%, a Jsc of 5.41 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.62 V and a FF of 60.82%. Cs3Sb2I9 devices with a 5 μl ml−1 HI additive showed an improved performance with a champion efficiency of 0.84%, a Jsc of 2.91 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.60 V and a FF of 48.11%. For comparison, Table S3† provides a literature survey of the Sb-based perovskite materials that have been used previously in solar cells. These Sb-based perovskite materials exhibited negligible hysteresis (Fig. S11, ESI†), which would be beneficial when using them as light harvesting layers in photovoltaic applications. Voc is lower compared to a previous report41 because of the sub-bandgap states formed by the defects, which may arise from the presence of pinholes in the structure. However, our Jsc and FF are significantly higher compared to the previous report which can be attributed to the high crystallinity of our absorber layer. The performance of these Sb-based perovskite solar cells remains poor when compared to that of Pb-based perovskite solar cells. Further improvements should be possible for Sb-based perovskite solar cells through optimization of their device structures and morphology and incorporation of suitable additives. The EQE spectra and integrated Jsc of the MA3Sb2I9 (Fig. 4c) and Cs3Sb2I9 (Fig. 4d) for the HI incorporated devices clearly show improvement compared to devices without the additive. The integrated Jsc values from EQE spectra for MA3Sb2I9, HI-MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 based devices were 3.46, 4.87, 1.86, and 2.25 mA cm−2 respectively, which match well that of the Jsc values measured using a solar simulator. MA3Sb2I9 shows higher EQE in the 300–450 nm range whereas HI-MA3Sb2I9 shows higher EQE from 500 to 700 nm, which agree well with their respective absorbance data (Fig. 1). A similar trend complying well with the observed UV-absorbance spectra was identified for Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 devices. Thus, it can be inferred that the Sb-based perovskites act as primary contributors for the photocurrent and can act as good light absorbing materials. The histograms of MA3Sb2I9, HI-MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and HI-Cs3Sb2I9 showed an average PCE of 0.9%, 1.9%, 0.6 and 0.8%, respectively (Fig. 4e and f). The stability of perovskite solar cells is an important issue affecting their potential applications. Accordingly, we investigated the stability of our perovskite devices prepared with the various cations. We stored the unencapsulated devices inside a glovebox (O2: <20 ppm; H2O: <0.1 ppm) for 30 days and then tested their performance. Fig. S12† presents the time-dependent changes in the PCEs recorded over the 30 day interval. Severe degradation occurred for the perovskite devices based on the MA cations, resulting in steeply decreasing PCEs. In contrast, the Cs-based perovskite exhibited better stability, due to the inorganic cation and also the formation of a uniform and compact film. For the Cs3Sb2I9 device, only ca. 10% degradation occurred over 30 days when it was stored in the dark environment.

Conclusions
In summary, we have used a single-step method to prepare solution-processable Sb-based perovskite thin films. Stoichiometric perovskite films were obtained after careful optimization of the precursor molar ratios and HI additive concentrations; their crystalline phases were analyzed through XRD. The novel HI additive approach leads to significantly improved perovskite film quality. SEM images of the various Sb-based halide materials revealed that they had different morphologies, possibly explaining the differences in their light absorption and their device performances. As a result, planar device architecture solar cells based on these Pb-free perovskites achieved the highest PCE of 2.04% when using MA3Sb2I9 – ∼4 times higher than the formerly reported record (∼0.5% PCE by Hebig41et al. and Zuo et al.46), which is a significant step forward for this Pb-free perovskite solar cell system. Overall, our results suggest strong potential for Sb-based halide perovskite compounds in optoelectronic devices, especially for photovoltaic applications.
