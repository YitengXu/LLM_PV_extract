    , Accepted 1st March 2022First published on 1st March 2022AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has received immense interest as a promising strategy for renewable energy generation. However, the desired efficiency is often hindered by the poor charge separation and sluggish surface reaction kinetics of the native photoanode. To address these issues, we herein demonstrate the effective modulation of the electronic structure and interface engineering strategy to improve their overall PEC performance. The defect generation in Bi2S3 is realized by a post-annealing which could increase the carrier concentration to enhance charge transfer; and a p–n Co3O4/Bi2S3 heterojunction is further built by loading Co3O4 nanostructures on the defective Bi2S3, where the resultant interfacial internal electric field further facilitates interfacial charge transfer. The optimized photoanodes yield a high photocurrent density of 7.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under AM 1.5 G and an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of ∼85% (420 nm) with the highest charge separation (53%) and transfer efficiency (47%) for Bi2S3 to date. The incorporation of Co3O4 reduces the self-corrosion of the pristine Bi2S3 anode and thus slightly improves the stability, yet more studies are still necessary to further improve the current faradaic efficiency (67.5%) as well as the long-term service life. Overall, our contribution paves a route to boost the PEC performance of cheap native photocatalysts by using facile synergistic strategies and thus prompt the design and application of more efficient photoelectrodes for solar conversion.
1 Introduction
Solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most efficient approaches for the production and storage of future renewable clean energy.1,2 Generally, a PEC cell involves oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the photoanode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the photocathode. The anode materials have been considered particularly critical as the OER is usually the most energy-consuming part in the PEC system. Noble metal compounds such as RuO2 have been initially used as the ideal anodic photocatalysts because of their excellent OER activity but are still limited due to their ultrahigh production cost.3–5 The earth-abundant and non-precious metal oxides such as TiO2, WO3, α-Fe2O3, BiVO4, etc. are also widely studied for the anode materials.6–9 However, currently their large-scale practical application is still limited by their various shortcomings such as poor electrical conductivity, weak light absorption and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics. Thus, exploration of novel oxygen-evolution photoanode materials is still essential and urgent for the long-term practical achievement of solar-driven water splitting.
Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), a typical Bi-based semiconductor, is recently reported as a potential photoanode material. Bi2S3 has a reasonable band gap of 1.3–1.7 eV, extending the light absorption to near-infrared with a high absorption coefficient in the order of 105 cm−1.10 A Bi2S3 photoanode can have a theoretical photocurrent of ∼30 mA cm−2 when assuming a complete light absorption and 100% utilization of above-band-gap photons.11 Nevertheless, currently the poor charge transport ability and limited active sites in the bulk Bi2S3 phase severely restricted its potential to rival the state-of-the-art photocatalyst in solar-driven PEC cells. Besides the application in photocatalysis, Bi2S3 is also used in electrocatalysis, and various strategies have been explored to improve its electrocatalytic activity, including interface engineering, defect engineering, band-gap engineering, phase engineering and/or integration with conductive materials such as graphene, noble metals and so on.12–15 Among these strategies, defect engineering is usually realized via the creation of sulfur vacancies, incorporation of oxygen species, and introduction of other lattice disorders, which have all been demonstrated as an effective pathway to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Bi2S3 products. The main disadvantages of this approach are the deformation of the original morphology and structure of the Bi2S3 phase, leading to the inevitable reduction of the chemical stability for long-term usage. Besides defect engineering, the interfacing engineering strategies are also important in photoelectrode design to induce a built-in potential for direct power generation.16 For example, the functional FeOOH allows the transport of electrons from BiVO4 to the outer layer, resulting in an upward band bending.17 Another sort of materials, ferroelectric-semiconductors such as BaTiO3 can induce an outward vector of built-in electric field after positive polarization, which aids in increasing the photovoltage and accelerating holes' transfer.18 Even two different crystal planes exhibit different surface potentials and form a polarization electric field, which is redirected for aiding in positive and negative polarizations, and then boosting water reaction kinetics.19 The strategy of building effective heterojunctions between Bi2S3 and another semiconductor phase are also investigated. The resultant products such as Bi2S3/WO3,20 Bi2S3/BiOBr21 and Bi2O3/Bi2S3/MoS2 (ref. 22) are proved to not only enhance the charge transport ability due to the realignment of band structure at the interface, but also improve the chemical stability during the water splitting.23–26 Unfortunately, such interfacial engineering approaches have not been widely investigated for photoanode application in PEC cells.
With these considerations, in this paper, we propose a synergistic regulation strategy to improve the overall performance of Bi2S3 photoanode for PEC-based water splitting. The synergistic regulation is realized by creating a heterostructure of Bi2S3 and Co3O4via defect engineering and interfacial engineering to simultaneously manipulate the intrinsic sulfur vacancies and the heterojunction interface of the products. Co3O4 was chosen as the heterostructure component due to its unique advances, such as high oxygen-evolution efficiency under near-neutral pH conditions, environmental-friendly character, and the low cost of Co.27 The structural evolution and composition control of the final product, namely v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterostructure, is realized by adopting a morphology-inheritable multi-step thermal annealing approach. When used in a PEC cell, the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode presents a photocurrent of 7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under precisely simulated AM 1.5 G illumination, which likely stands for the state-of-the-art achievement of the recently reported non-precious photoanode materials. We believe such synergistic strategy of simultaneously tuning various factors that influence the catalytic performance can prompt future design and application of earth-abundant PEC catalyst.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of i-Bi2S3 photoanodes
i-Bi2S3 was synthesized by in situ sulfurization of hierarchical porous Bi2O3 nanoplates via a simple chemical bath deposition followed by annealing according to our previous report.28 All reagents used in the experiment were of analytical grade and used without further purification. FTO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent-added distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. 3 mL triethanolamine was added into 60 mL Bi(NO3)3 solution (0.1 M). After stirring for 15 minutes, the pH value was adjusted to 13.5 by adding KOH. The cleaned FTO glass substrates were vertically immersed in the above solution and maintained at 60 °C for 2 h. The as-deposited films were annealed in air at 350 °C for 60 min with heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. After that, the prepared Bi2O3 nanoplates were annealed at 350 °C in sulfur atmosphere (evaporation of solid sulfur) under negative pressure for certain minutes to obtain the i-Bi2S3.
2.2 Preparation of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanodes
The v-Bi2S3 synthesized from the above step were annealed in argon at 350 °C under negative pressure for certain minutes. Finally, Co3O4-nanoparticles were fabricated according to a previous report.7 The Co3O4 nanoparticles were loaded on the v-Bi2S3 by impregnation from 0.05 M Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 30 min and then dried. After that, the photoelectrode was heat treated in argon at 350 °C under negative pressure for 1 h to obtain v-Bi2S3/Co3O4.
2.3 Material characterization
The morphology and crystalline properties of the prepared films were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku3014) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F; accelerating voltage: 200 kV) and environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, FEI Quanta-200 at a 20 keV accelerating voltage). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained by using JEM 2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The chemical state of the as-prepared samples was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy through Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) on an ESCA MULTIPLEX-1600. The UPS measurements were performed using a He I (21.22 eV) excitation line, and the work function was determined from the UPS spectra by subtracting their width (that is, the energy difference between the analyser Fermi level and the high binding energy cut-off), from the He I excitation energy. The light harvesting performance was obtained by UV-visible spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Shimadzu, UV-2600, Japan). Raman spectra were obtained by Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution) using an excitation laser source of 532 nm. A Bruker model EMXplus spectrometer was used to investigate the electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of samples. The normalized Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) was converted from energy to k-space and weighted by k3. These data were then Fourier transformed to R-space.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out using a PARSTAT4000A in a standard three-electrode configuration with the samples used as photoanode, a Pt foil as counter electrode, and a Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The water splitting photocurrents were measured in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH ≈ 7) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Charge transfer efficiency was obtained by measuring light absorption and photocurrents in 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution, where Na2S was used as the sacrificial reagent to eliminate holes and protect the samples against oxidation. The PEC performance was measured under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 generated by a solar simulator (Newport 66902) with an AM 1.5G filter. Potentials of the working electrode were given on RHE scale to easily compare with other results through the following formula: VRHE = VSC + 0.059pH + 0.24(1)where VRHE is a potential versus a reversible hydrogen potential, VSC is a potential versus saturated calomel electrode, and pH is a pH value of the electrolyte. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was performed under monochromatic light using bandpass filters and calculated as follows, (2)where 1240 (V nm) is a multiplication of h (Planck's constant) and c (the speed of light), i (mA cm−2) is the photocurrent density, λ (nm) is the wavelength of incident photon, and Pλ (mW cm−2) is the light intensity at λ. Pλ was measured with a photometer. The photocurrent density, i, was determined by measuring current versus time curve at a constant potential (1.23 VRHE).
The H2O oxidation photocurrent is given by JH2O = Jmax × ηabs × ηsep × ηtrans, where the charge separation (ηsep) and surface transfer efficiencies (ηtrans) are determined by adding a fast hole scavenger (0.1 M Na2S, Fig. S7†) to the electrolyte, which could be assumed that the surface recombination of charges is eliminated and ηtrans (Na2S) ≈ 100%. The Na2S oxidation photocurrent is given by JNa2S ≈ Jmax × ηabs × ηsep, the charge separation and surface transfer efficiencies can be individually calculated as ηsep ≈ JNa2S/(Jmax × ηabs) and ηtrans ≈ JH2O/JNa2S, and the maximum water oxidation photocurrent (Jmax) of Bi2S3 nanoplates in our work according to the absorption property is calculated to 31.06 mA cm−2.29
2.5 Theoretical calculation
We use plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) for the energy calculations of all relaxed structures. Our DFT calculations are carried out with the PBE-GGA functional via the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), with the Projector Augmented-Wave pseudopotentials defined within VASP. For adsorbent on the surface structure optimizations, we create slabs with at least 15 Å vacuum spaces. For total energy calculations, the cutoff energy for all calculations was 500 eV. Energy minima were located via geometry optimization in which atoms were relaxed until the forces on all atoms were less than 0.03 eV Å−1. For each minimum, the molecular adsorption energy was defined by Eads = Etot − Eslab − Eg, where Etot and Eslab are the total energies of slabs with and without the adsorbed species present, and Eg is the total energy of molecular species in the gas phase. With this convention, negative adsorption energies define states that are energetically favourable relative to the gas phase molecule and the clean surface. For the dissociation and diffusion processes, a standard chain-of-states method such as the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method was applied to locate transition states and energy barriers.
3 Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, a morphology-inheritable multi-step thermal annealing approach was used to realize the successful preparation of our final heterostructure product (see the experimental details). Briefly, the nanoplate networks of Bi2O3 was first grown on clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate via a typical chemical bath deposition method as reported previously.28 This was followed by annealing the sample in a sulfur atmosphere to obtain the initial Bi2S3 nanoplates (i-Bi2S3). In the following, a second deep-annealing in the Ar atmosphere was further carried out to create sulfur vacancies in i- Bi2S3 (defect engineering step), leading to the formation of vacancy-rich Bi2S3 (v-Bi2S3). Finally, a third annealing step with the addition of cobalt precursor was conducted to obtain the final product (interfacial engineering step), namely v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterostructures. It is worth noting that although the sample preparation involves a multi-step thermal annealing process, these steps are highly compatible with the industrial vapor phase production platforms, and thus the heterostructure synthesis process is technically facile and cost-effective. By designing such a unique and feasible protocol, we successfully realized the concept of synergistic defect and interface engineering strategy for the initial Bi2S3 that proposed in this study (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the defect- and interface-controlled synthesis of Bi2S3-based heterostructure by introducing sulfur vacancies and creating heterojunction interface between Bi2S3 and Co3O4. 
The detailed morphology characterization is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The individual Bi2O3 nanoplates are usually with a lateral size of 300–500 nm and a thickness of 20–50 nm (Fig. S1a–c†). In the subsequent sulfurization annealing process, the colour of the network film turns from yellow to black. However, the morphology and structure of the i-Bi2S3 product precisely retain that of the pristine Bi2O3 (Fig. S1d–f†). After a further post-annealing, the Bi2S3 nanoplates become thicker and the thickness of network film reduces (Fig. S1g–i†). This is probably due to argon treatment, leading to the creation of abundant sulfur vacancies in the product (v-Bi2S3). The comparisons for the v-Bi2S3 photoanode with different post-annealing time are displayed in Fig. S2 and S3.† The morphology and structure of the v-Bi2S3 almost maintain the same until the time prolonged to 45 min, when the crystallinity slightly decreased and the morphology deteriorate remarkably. The PEC performance displays the photocurrent of v-Bi2S3 increase after the post-annealing before 45 min. Thus, the proper post-annealing time choose to 30 min.
The morphology of the final v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterostructures is shown in Fig. 2a–c. We observed an overall precise morphology inheritance to the original Bi2O3 except the change of surface colour and a slight increase of surface roughness. The high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2d indicates the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterostructures have a good crystalline quality. A lattice spacing of 0.38 nm is observed, in good agreement with the lattice spacing of (110) plane of the orthorhombic Bi2S3. This is further confirmed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) image in Fig. 2e. The TEM image in Fig. 2f further shows the morphology of Co3O4 nanocrystals, which have an average size of ∼5 nm and are well-dispersed in the v-Bi2S3 matrix. The measured lattice spacing of 0.25 nm corresponds to the (311) crystal plane of Co3O4, which is consistent with the nanostructures prepared with a similar method in previous report.30,31 In addition, EDS mapping results are also shown in Fig. 2g, illustrating the uniform dispersion of Bi and S elements, while the Co3O4 nanocrystals are mainly distributed on the edge of v-Bi2S3 nanoplates.

In order to confirm the crystal structure of Bi2S3, XRD patterns are collected for the i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, the prominent diffraction peaks of all the three samples are assigned to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2S3 according to JCPDS no. 65-2431, and this is consistent with above TEM demonstration. Compared with the i-Bi2S3, we observed an apparent negative shift of all diffraction peaks for the v-Bi2S3 after post-annealing. This indicates the slight expansion and distortion of Bi2S3 crystal lattice and has been proved by the high-resolution TEM image in Fig. 2d. Such lattice variation is attributed to creating defects such as sulfur vacancies and other incorporated atoms. After the decoration of Co3O4 nanocrystals, we further observed another slight negative shift of the diffraction peaks, which is probably due to corporation of oxygen interstitials during the formation Co3O4.
 Fig. 3  Spectroscopic characterizations. (a) XRD patterns for the initial Bi2S3 (i-Bi2S3), the vacancy-rich Bi2S3 (v-Bi2S3), and the final v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterostructure. (b) Magnitude of Fourier transform of Bi L3-edge EXAFS for the three samples. (c) XPS demonstration of the three samples: (c) survey spectra, (d) Bi 4f and S 2p spectra, and (e) Co 2p spectra. 
To understand the observations of lattice difference in the XRD patterns, a synchrotron radiation study was carried out for the same three samples. Fig. 3b shows the Fourier transformed L3-edge EXAFS spectra for i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4. A spectrum of Bi foil is also present as comparison. As we can see, the Fourier transform curves of the i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 samples exhibit two dominant peaks at 1.6–1.8 Å and 2.1–2.2 Å, assigned to Bi–O and Bi–S coordination respectively, and the Bi foil sample only exhibit one peak at 1.6–1.8 Å, assigned to Bi–O, which is due to the inevitable oxidation on the foil surface. The Bi–O peaks in the Fourier transform curves displays a noticeable low-R shift from 1.72 Å to 1.66 Å. The Bi–S peaks in the Fourier transform curves shows a decrease from i-Bi2S3 to v-Bi2S3, and then again decreased for v-Bi2S3/Co3O4, demonstrating the varied coordination environment of the Bi sites after different treatments.
Quantitatively, we carried out least-squares EXAFS curve-fitting analysis for the first coordination shell of Bi by considering two backscattering paths, including Bi–O and Bi–S (Fig. S4, ESI†), and fitting results are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). Comparing sample v-Bi2S3 with i-Bi2S3, we found that the Bi–S bond length increased, the Bi–O bond length decreased and disorder (ss) decreased. This indicates that after the post-annealing, sulfur vacancies are formed at the material surface and the crystallinity increases. After the loading of Co3O4, the Bi–S bond length decreases and the Bi–O bond length increases. This is probably because that the O element has been compensated for the S vacancy. From the coordination number (CN) obtained by fitting, after annealing and loading, CN first decreased and then increased, which is consistent with our above description.
The optical performance for all the samples were measured by UV-vis absorbance spectra as shown in Fig. S5a.† The spectra of i-Bi2S3 and v-Bi2S3 display the same shape and the absorption edge, and the higher light absorption of the v-Bi2S3 is caused by the rough surface owing to the post annealing process.32 After Co3O4 loading, the absorbance spectrum become quite different, which is an indirect clue for the existence of Co3O4. The Raman spectra (Fig. S5b†) also carried out to confirm the heterostructure. The obtained peaks at 235, 256, 422 cm−1 are corresponded with the Ag and B1g optical modes of Bi2S3.33 The red shift of Raman spectrum for v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 and the newly peak at 524 cm−1 indicate the existence of Co3O4 nanoparticles incorporation.34,35 In order to examine the surface state, the EPR spectroscopy is employed, as displayed in Fig. S5c.† A signal located at g = 2.003 is detected by i-Bi2S3 and v-Bi2S3, which is assigned to the sulfur vacancies.36 However, the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 shows no obvious signal of sulfur vacancies which means the Co3O4 loading compensates the sulfur vacancies.
XPS characterization was further carried out to confirm the feasibility of defect and interfacial engineering. The survey scans for the three samples, i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3/Co3O4, are presented in Fig. 3c, of which the elemental signals are overall consistent with above EDS study. The weak C 1s peaks are assigned to the inevitable absorption of CO2 and other dust from the atmosphere and are used as reference to standardize the binding energy of other elements. The Bi 4f and S 2p peaks of the three samples are shown in Fig. 3d. The two strong peaks located at 158.5 eV and 163.8 eV with a typical spin–orbit doublet splitting of 5.3 eV are assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively, matching well with the standard Bi3+ peaks in Bi2S3.20 The peaks located at 159.5 eV and 164.8 eV of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are assigned to Bi3+ peaks in Bi2O3.37 The Bi–O peaks are not observed for the i-Bi2S3, indicating its high purity after sulfurization. The emergence of Bi–O peaks on the v-Bi2S3 is probably due to the incorporation of some oxygen atoms in the sulfur vacancies. After the formation of Co3O4 nanocrystals, the Bi–O peaks are further increased, indicating the incorporation of more oxygen in the sulfur vacancies. This is well-consistent with our observations in the TEM and EXAFS demonstrations and further confirms feasibility of our defect engineering strategy.
The relatively small peaks at 161.4 eV and 162.6 eV are corresponding to S2−. It should be noted that the peaks for the S 2p orbits in v-Bi2S3 shifted to a lower binding energy slightly compared with that in i-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 shifted more than v-Bi2S3, which can be attributed to the variations of the chemical environment with the introduction of O and Co.38 In addition, the Co 2p and O 1s spectra for the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 are collected. As shown in Fig. 3e, in which the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are located at 780.9 and 796.7 eV, respectively, together with two satellite peaks cantered at 786.5 and 802.3 eV. The fitting peaks at 780.9 and 796.7 eV are assigned to the Co3+ cation,39 and the peaks located at 782.2 and 798 eV are ascribed to the Co2+ cation,40 implying the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+, which has been proved to be a confirmation for the presence of Co3O4 phase. In addition, it is worth noting that from the XPS analysis we found that the molar ratio of Bi and Co is 39.1:0.9, indicating the successful creation of abundant heterojunction interface of Bi2S3 and Co3O4. Fig. S5d† shows the O 1s XPS spectra of the samples. The high-resolution spectra of O 1s can be deconvoluted into three peaks: the peak located at around 530.8 eV (OI) represents the lattice O, the peak at around 531.7 eV (OII) can be assigned to the oxygen vacancy, and the peak at higher binding energy (∼532.5 eV, OIII) is attributed to the surface adsorbed water molecules.41 Only v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 has two different peaks indexing to the oxygen vacancy with a newly introduced lattice O, which demonstrates the Co3O4 is successfully loading on the surface of Bi2S3 and increase the oxygen vacancy.
The band structures of all the samples were characterized by Mott–Schottky analysis and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. S6a† shows the Mott–Schottky plots for all the Bi2S3 based photoanodes, and the Efb shifts cathodically remarkably after Co3O4 loading, which is consistent with the shift of the onset potential of the J–V curves observed in Fig. 4b. The cathodic shift in Efb is presumably due to the incorporation of Co3O4, resulting in a change in the band energetics.42 The same phenomenon came to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S6b†) which were employed to determine more accurately the band edge positions. The work functions of the i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 were determined by subtracting the cut-off energies (Ecutoff) for the secondary electrons from the He I excitation energy (21.2 eV; Fig. S6b†). The positions of the valence band maxima with respect to the Fermi levels were obtained from the onset of valence band photoemission on the low-binding-energy edges of UPS spectra, as shown in the inset of Fig. S6b.† The conduction band and valence band are found to shift negatively along the routine, which is consistent with the above results.

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performances of all the three different samples were characterized by using a three-electrode electrolysis cell equipped with an AM 1.5G solar irradiation source (see the experimental details). Fig. 4a schematically illustrates a view of the photoanode architecture and the overall reaction process. Upon light illumination, v-Bi2S3 and Co3O4 absorbed photons and produced electrons and holes. Holes were driven through the Co3O4 layer, oxidizing water to oxygen. Electrons were transported to the v-Bi2S3 and through FTO to the counter electrode to reduce protons to hydrogen. The typical photocurrent–potential curves of the three photoanodes are shown in Fig. 4b. There is negligible current in the dark for all the three samples, which means the current does come from the photoelectric response. It is shown that v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 produced the highest photocurrent density in Na2SO4 (JH2O) electrolyte among the three samples, indicating the best PEC performance of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4. At 1.23 vs. RHE under the simulated AM 1.5G illumination, the JH2O of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 (7.0 mA cm−2) is about ∼1.8 and ∼2.9 times higher than that of v-Bi2S3 (3.8 mA cm−2) and i-Bi2S3 (2.4 mA cm−2), which is the highest one for Bi2S3 based electrode up to date.43–47 In addition, the onset potential of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 is negatively shifted in Na2SO4 electrolyte, demonstrating the introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticle catalyst on the electrode surface decreases the kinetic barrier for charge transfer across the electrode–electrolyte interface, providing a more efficient transfer of holes in the PEC water oxidation.7 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is ∼85%, at 420 nm (Fig. 4c), which is about ∼1.3 times and ∼2 times higher than that of v-Bi2S3 (67%) and i-Bi2S3 (42%). The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the three samples calculated by using its J–V curve, assuming 100% faradaic efficiency, is plotted in Fig. 4d.48 The maximum ABPE of 0.5% achieved by the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 at ∼1.1 V vs. RHE is impressive because it is obtained by using Bi2S3 as a main photon absorber in Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the ABPE of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 in the lower potential range (0.2–0.9 V vs. RHE) is higher than that of v-Bi2S3 and i-Bi2S3, which means v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 is more favourable for assembling a tandem cell.49 For comparison, the IPCE values (1.23 V vs. RHE) of the Bi2S3 based photoanode in the wok and that reported in the literature20,50–57 are shown in Fig. 4e, v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 shows the highest PEC performance till date.
To better understand the interfacial properties between the Bi2S3-based electrode and the electrolyte, Nyquist plots of the electrodes were measured under illumination. The impedance spectra of (Fig. S8a†) the photoelectrodes were strongly affected by the different modification, and the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface is changed clearly. The Nyquist plots clearly show that the post annealing and incorporation of Co3O4 can pronouncedly decrease the charge transfer resistance to facilitate the surface reaction kinetics and thus improve the whole PEC performances. The relationship between PEC performance and the interfacial condition was also measured by the open circuit potential (OCP) behaviours of different Bi2S3-based photoelectrodes (Fig. S8b†). The measurements were conducted in ambient atmosphere using 1 M sodium sulphate electrolyte solution. The v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 showed the lowest OCP under irradiation and the highest OCP in dark at equilibrium, hence the largest open circuit voltage. Higher dark OCP usually indicates less effect of Fermi level pinning by surface states.58 In this case, v-Bi2S3 occupied the lowest dark OCP while that of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 is the largest. The Co3O4 is therefore considered to have benefits to conditioning of surface states, which is also supported by the cathodic shift of on-set potential. In contrast to that for dark OCP, the OCP under irradiation is quite different. As the decrease in OCP under irradiation for the v-Bi2S3, and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 is indicative of more photogenerated electrons, significantly improved charge separation property can then be deduced from this result, indicating efficient removal of detrimental defects that play as charge recombination centres. At last, the stability of all the samples were tested at 1.23 V versus RHE under simulated sunlight (Fig. S8c†). The photocurrent for all the three samples shows an inevitable decay, while the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 and v-Bi2S3 samples are relatively more stable within 300 s (remained ∼33% of the initial value) as compared with that for the i-Bi2S3. The poor stability of the Bi2S3-based photoelectrode is probably due to the self-corrosion, which is a common phenomenon in for the metal sulfide semiconductors during the PEC reaction. In order to confirm that the sustained photocurrent of the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode was derived from a steady oxygen evolution process, the oxygen evolved from the photoanode was quantified by gas chromatography (Fig. S8d†). The v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode was held at 1.23 V versus RHE under AM1.5G for 60 min. The oxygen was continuously detected, which demonstrates that the photocurrent of the photoanode is utilized for oxygen evolution. However, the low and decreased faradaic efficiency (67.5% in 30 min and 51.7% in 60 min) indicates that the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode still undergoes a self-corrosion process.
To further identify the catalytical active sites and determine the role of sulfur vacancies in the OER processes, we performed DFT computations to calculate the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of coordinate elementary steps. The OER based on the following 4e-mechanism proposed for water oxidation59 is presented in Fig. 5a, * + H2O → *OH + (H+ + e−)(3) *OH → *O + (H+ + e−)(4) *O + H2O → *OOH + (H+ + e−)(5) *OOH → * + O2 + (H+ + e−)(6)where * stands for the active sites in catalysts. The calculated ΔG values at different reaction steps are shown in Fig. 5b for the i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3 and Co3O4 (see the insets for their corresponding crystal structures). We find that the ΔG of v-Bi2S3 is larger than that of i-Bi2S3, while the Co3O4 shows the lowest ΔG values, suggesting the Co3O4 requires the lowest overpotential for OER reaction. This proves that the loading of Co3O4 in v-Bi2S3 would reduce the overpotential of water oxidation and thus improves its OER activity. The electronic structure is further examined to reveal the variation of band energy state. The Brillouin zone (BZ) corresponding to the specific lattice parameter of our base-cantered-orthorhombic Bi2S3 is depicted in Fig. 5c. The calculated band structures of i-Bi2S3 and oxygen-compensated v-Bi2S3 are presented in Fig. 5d and e, respectively, where the atomic fraction of oxygen and sulfur vacancies are estimated from our XPS demonstration. The i-Bi2S3 shows a direct band gap (Γ–Γ) of 1.25 eV (Fig. 5d), which is consistent with previous report.60 It is worth noting that the introduction of sulfur vacancies has a significant influence on the electronic structure. As shown in Fig. S8,† the v-Bi2S3 containing 10% sulfur vacancies shows an extra defect level appeared in the gap with a distance of 0.25 eV from the conduction band minimum (CBM).61,62 The band gap of v-Bi2S3 is almost the same as that of i-Bi2S3, while that of v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 exhibits a slightly narrowed band gap as compared with the initial i-Bi2S3 as shown in Fig. 5e, owing to the Co3O4 loading.63

According to the electronic structure calculation, a mechanism of charge separation for the v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 heterojunction is proposed in Fig. 5f. As suggested by the band alignment diagram, the photoelectrons from p-Co3O4 are in favour of migrating to v-Bi2S3, and the photogenerated holes on the valence band of v-Bi2S3 are prone to travel to Co3O4. Furthermore, the highly dispersed state of Co3O4 could suppress the formation of interfacial recombination centres.63 As a result, the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is significantly enhanced. To confirm the theoretically proposed photocarrier transfer mechanism, the charge separation efficiency (ηsep) and charge injection efficiency (ηinj) of the i-Bi2S3, v-Bi2S3 and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 were further experimentally estimated. As shown in Fig. 5g, ηsep of i-Bi2S3 is relatively poor, probably attributing to the severe recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons in bulk.64 After post-annealing and Co3O4 loading, the charge separation efficiencies of the v-Bi2S3 and v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 are remarkably enhanced, reaching 45% and 53% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, indicating that v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode is most favourable for the separation of photogenerated carriers, which is of excellent consistency with the band alignment mechanism proposed in Fig. 5f. In addition, it is worth noting that the ηinj curves in Fig. 5h display an opposite trend where the v-Bi2S3 shows decreased charge transfer ability compared with the i-Bi2S3. This is because the sulfur vacancies can create trap states on the surface, which will lead to serious interfacial charge recombination and decreased photovoltages.8 This is quite consistent with the result of OCP test. The above suggestion is well-consistent with the DFT calculation in Fig. S4† where a deep energy level which would act as trapping sites and recombination centres for photogenerated hole and electron in the gap is induced by sulfur vacancy.65 However, this deficiency can be effectively compensated by the Co3O4 loading step, where the incorporation of oxygen atoms in v-Bi2S3 passivate the sulfur vacancies in the surface62 and the Co3O4 could lower the energy barrier for OER,63 leading to significantly enhanced charge injection efficiency, which is also very consistent with our DFT calculations.
4 Conclusions
The critical advances of our heterostructure fabrication strategy are the combination of defect engineering and interface engineering to overcome the intrinsically poor charge transport properties of Bi2S3 without compromising light absorption. We found that the facile post-annealing of the native Bi2S3 can enhance charge transfer by suppressing the bulk electron–hole recombination by introducing defective sites in the interface which serve as the charge-trapping centres; meanwhile, the effective Co3O4 loading on the surface of Bi2S3 nanoplate network is capable to compensate the decrease of charge transfer efficiency caused by the surface defects and further improve the overall PEC activity. As a result, we obtain a IPCE of ∼85% and ABPE of 0.5% at 420 nm, and a photocurrent of 7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination for our final v-Bi2S3/Co3O4 photoanode, which might stand for the highest performance achieved to date in the Bi2S3 based photoanodes. We also observed an increase of anode stability after Co3O4 loading, however, all the three samples still show unsatisfactory service life, which is probably due to the inevitable self-corrosion of the Bi2S3, as indicated by the relatively low faradaic efficiency (67.5% in 30 min and 51.7% in 60 min). Further work about improving the stability of the photoanodes might be necessary. Overall, our study demonstrates a facile route to improve the overall PEC performance of native OER materials and likely holds broad potentials for designing and constructing efficient photoanodes in tandem PEC systems.
