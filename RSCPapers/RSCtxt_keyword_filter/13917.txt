Based on a single n-type ZnO MW and a p-type Si film, an ultraviolet (UV)-visible photodetector (PD) has been constructed from the p–n junction, which showed a high rectification ratio larger than 103 at ±3 V and an ideal factor of about 2. Under zero bias, the PD exhibited high photosensitivities of ∼2 × 104 and ∼5 × 103 for UV (325 nm) and visible (514 nm) light, respectively, with a fast response time of about 7.4 ms. Also, detailed characterizations indicated that the short-circuit current (Isc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) showed square root and logarithmical dependences on the light intensity, respectively. The results support that n-ZnO MW/p-Si film PDs have potential application in the field of UV-visible detection and might be used as elements for powering low-energy micro/nanosystems.
Introduction
As important II–VI-group semiconductors with a wide band-gap of 3.37 eV and large exciton binding energy of 60 meV, ZnO micro/nanowires have drawn much attention for their potential application in optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes,1 laser diodes,2 solar cells3 and PDs.4,5 ZnO micro/nanowires have a large surface-to-volume ratio and high-density hole-trap states, hence PDs based on them usually exhibit high internal gain.6 Also, monocrystalline ZnO micro/nanowires provide direct electrical pathways for charge carriers, leading to a faster response speed of the PDs.7 However, the traditional PDs require an external power source such as a battery. Photovoltaic detectors can operate at zero bias, in accordance with the energy saving trend in the 21st century. Due to the difficulties in the fabrication of high quality p–n ZnO homojunctions, n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions as an alternative approach have drawn the attention of researchers for their availability in the semiconductor industry and their low cost. For example, Mridha and Basak have fabricated a n-ZnO/p-Si film photodiode by a sol–gel technique and it took around 60 min for the photocurrent of the device to restore the original dark current value at a bias voltage of +1 V.8 Y. N. Hou et al. reported that the photocurrent of the n-MgZnO/p-Si ultraviolet-B photodetector could hardly reset (about 50 s) at −3 V bias, owing to the influence of the persistent photocurrent.9 In general, the response time of PDs based on n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions is longer than 1 s, and how to further increase the response speed is still a challenge. On the other hand, although there are many reports available on the studies of the photoresponse properties of the n-ZnO/p-Si PDs under external bias, detailed investigation on the photoresponse properties at zero bias is still lacking.
In this work, a UV-visible PD based on a single ZnO microwire/p-Si film heterojunction is constructed. At zero bias, the fabricated PD was found to have a fast response time of about 7.4 ms and a high sensitivity larger than 2 × 104 (5 × 103) for UV (visible) light. In order to gain insight into the physical mechanisms behind these photoresponse properties, the dependence of Isc and Voc on the incident power density (P) was investigated.
Experimental section
The ZnO MWs used in this work were synthesized via a simple CVD method detailed in a previous paper.10 To assess the electrical transport properties of the fabricated ZnO MWs, an Ag–ZnO–Ag metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) device was fabricated on the SiO2 (500 nm)/p-Si substrate (0.05 Ω cm) (inset in Fig. 1(c)). A single ZnO MW was placed on the silicon-on-insulator substrate by using a micromanipulator under an optical microscope, and the two ends of the MW were secured with high-purity silver conducting paint. To construct the n-ZnO MW/p-Si film heterojunction, a region of the p-Si (1–10 Ω cm) surface was first coated with a SiO2 film (450 nm) as the insulation layer via RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Then, a single ZnO MW was placed across the boundary between the SiO2 and p-Si, and the p–n junction was formed between the front-end of the n-ZnO and the p-Si substrate due to surface static interactions.11 After that, the ZnO MW on the SiO2 side was coated with a Ag electrode using high-purity silver conducting paint. The electrical properties of the MSM devices and PDs were measured at room temperature by using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS). A 325 nm He–Cd laser and a 514 nm Ar-ion laser were used as light sources and the laser power could be tuned by an attenuator. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the fabricated device was performed using the QTest Station 1000ADI system (CrownTech, INC.) with a 150 W tungsten lamp.

Results and discussions
A SEM image of the ZnO MWs grown on Si substrate is shown in Fig. 1(a), from which it can be found that the diameter of the MWs ranges from 1 μm to 3 μm. The ZnO MWs are regular hexagonal prisms with well-resolved edges and smooth surfaces as the inset shows. A sharp near band edge (NBE) emission peak centered at 377 nm and a weak green emission band are observed from Fig. 1(b). Compared with the NBE emission peak, the weak visible emission band that is related to the surface states, oxygen vacancies and some structural defects12 can be negligible, which indicates the formation of high quality crystalline ZnO MWs.
Fig. 1(c) depicts the typical I–V curve of the Ag–ZnO–Ag MSM device. The nearly linear curve indicates that weak Schottky barriers have formed between the ZnO MW and the Ag electrodes. The electrical parameters of the MW can be extracted from the I–V curve in the intermediate bias regime where the reverse-biased Schottky barrier dominates the total current I:13 
(1)where J is the current density through the contact, S is the contact area, Js is a slowly varying function of the applied bias, Eo = Eoocoth(qEoo/kT) with Eoo = h/4π[N/(m*nεsεo)]1/2, N is the electron concentration, m*n and εs are the effective mass of an electron and relative permittivity of the material, respectively, and εo is the permittivity of free space. The logarithmic plot of the current I as a function of the bias V gives approximately a straight line and the slope is q/(kT) − 1/Eo (Fig. 1(d)). Then N can be obtained via Eo and the electron mobility μ can be calculated using μ = 1/(Nqρ), with ρ being the resistivity of the MW. Finally the electron concentration and the electron mobility of the MW were estimated to be 1.06 × 1017 cm−3 and 1.68 cm2 V−1 s−1, in good agreement with those of usual ZnO materials.13,14
The as-grown ZnO MWs were used to fabricate ZnO MW/p-Si heterojunction PDs. A schematic diagram and a SEM image of the fabricated device are shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively. It can be found that the ZnO MW has a width of about 3 μm and a length of about 360 μm (about 190 μm on the p-Si surface and about 170 μm on the SiO2 surface). Fig. 2(c) depicts the I–V characteristics of the heterojunction in the dark, revealing an excellent rectification behavior with a turn-on voltage of ∼1 V and a rectification ratio larger than 103 at ±3 V. The ideal factor α for this heterojunction could be estimated to be about 2 from the intercept of the dV/lnI vs. I curve shown in Fig. 2(d), according to the equation:15 
(2)where Rs is the series resistance of the heterojunction.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show typical I–V curves of the heterojunction PDs measured in the dark and under illumination with 325 nm and 514 nm lasers with different incident light powers. It can be seen that the devices are highly responsive to both UV and visible light at reverse bias, while only responsive to UV light at forward bias. In addition, a prominent response has been observed under zero bias (insets in Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Upon 325 nm illumination (corresponding values under 514 nm illumination are shown in brackets) with a laser power of 7 W cm−2 (25 W cm−2), the Isc reached a maximum of −20.5 nA (−5.0 nA), and the corresponding Voc was 0.49 V (0.43 V). The maximum power point of the I–V curves was found at the voltage of 0.20 V (0.25 V) and the current of 8.6 nA (2.1 nA), so the maximum output power was 1.7 nW (0.5 nW). Given that the dark current at 0 V bias was less than 1 pA, the devices had an on–off ratio of about 2 × 104 for UV light and about 5 × 103 for visible light.

Insets in (a) and (b) show the enlarged I–V curves under illumination of UV light and visible light, respectively. The light-intensity-dependent (c) Isc and (d) Voc plots. 
To further study the optoelectronic properties of the heterojunction device, the light intensity dependence of the output properties was investigated. The short-circuit current versus light intensity can be expressed by a simple power law 
Isc = CPθ
(3)where C is a constant for a particular wavelength. Fitting the equation to the experimental data gives the following relationship: Isc = 7.47P0.53 for 325 nm light and Isc = 1.06P0.48 for 514 nm light (Fig. 3(c)), indicating a near square root dependence of the photocurrent on the incident light intensity, which agrees with the experimental data reported before.16,17 At low power intensities, Isc exhibits an almost linear dependence on the intensity because the photocurrent is proportional to the luminous flux and the carrier lifetime is constant.18 At high power intensities, bimolecular recombination dominates the relaxation process, significantly reducing the carrier lifetime, so Isc begins to saturate under higher power densities.19 Voc depends logarithmically on the light intensity (Fig. 3(d)) as expected for a diode structure.20 The relationship between Isc and Voc can be expressed as: 
ln(Isc) = (q/αkT)Voc + ln(Io)
(4)where Io is the saturation current. Isc increases linearly with the square root of the illumination intensity, so it follows from the equation that Voc will depend logarithmically on the intensity.21
The time response of the PDs under 0 V bias with switching illumination is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). One thing to note is that the photocurrent versus time curves under diverse laser power illumination being turned on and off was measured in the same process, and the off-state currents were identical without normalization processing, which indicates the PDs perform with excellent stability and reproducibility. In addition, the square-wave like curves indicate the PDs have rapid response speeds. To further investigate the response time, the rising and falling edges of the current response under 325 nm (7 W cm−2) and 514 nm (25 W cm−2) illumination were magnified as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The rise time (from 10% to 90% of the maximum photocurrent) and the decay time (from 90% to 10% of the maximum photocurrent) of the device are determined to be about 7.4 ms for both UV and visible exposure. The response time is faster than that of the Schottky junction type and p–n junction type PDs reported in the previous literature.22–24 Commonly, due to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the micro/nanowire surface,25 most photoconductive PDs based on ZnO micro/nanowires have long recovery times. The striking feature of these PDs is that the photocarrier relaxation process is composed of a very fast decay component, which arises from the fast carrier thermalization,6 and a persistent decay component, which is related to the readsorption of oxygen molecules to the surfaces of the ZnO micro/nanowires. The photocurrent decay process also follows a double-exponential relaxation function,26 while, in our case, the photocurrent of the p–n junction PDs grows and decays linearly as the time increases, indicating a much faster response speed than that of the photoconductive PDs. This is because the photoelectrical response of the heterojunction PDs at zero bias is dominated by two quick processes. One is that the photogenerated electrons and holes in the depletion region rapidly drift in opposite directions driven by the internal electric field. The fast drift process is determined by the transit time of carriers drifting across the depletion layer. The other process is that the photoexcited minority carriers in the diffusion regions at the edges of the depletion region, the electrons in the p-side diffusion region and the holes in the n-side diffusion region, diffuse into the depletion layer and then are swept to the other side by the built-in electric field. The slow diffusion process can last as long as the lifetime of the carriers.11,27 Therefore, the photogenerated carriers in the heterojunction PDs have a large velocity under the effect of the strong internal field and are not affected by the oxygen adsorption and desorption at the ZnO micro/nanowire surface.

In order to get a deeper insight into the aforementioned photoresponse behavior, the energy band diagram of the fabricated n-ZnO MW/p-Si film heterojunction derived from the Anderson model were performed (Fig. 5). The model shows a small conduction band offset (0.3 eV) and a large valence band offset (2.54 eV).28 Under zero bias (Fig. 5(a)), the absorption of visible photons takes place in the depleted p-Si region, and the photogenerated holes (PGHs) drift toward the charge-neutral p-region driven by the internal electric field, whereas the photogenerated electrons (PGEs) cannot reach the n-ZnO region because the thin SiO2 layer (∼3 nm)29 naturally formed at the ZnO MW/p-Si film interface blocks the movement of the PGEs. When the device is illuminated by UV light, the PGEs in the depleted n-ZnO region drift to the charged-neutral n-region, while the PGHs cannot pass through the junction area due to their low mobility and short lifetime as well as the blocking effect of the insulation layer. Besides, the UV photons will also be absorbed by the p-Si film, contributing to a larger Isc of the PD upon UV irradiation than that upon visible irradiation. Under forward bias (Fig. 5(b)), the visible PGHs are confined in the p-Si side by the large valence band offset, and the flow of the minority carriers (PGEs) dominates the photocurrent. Therefore, a weak photoelectric signal has been observed in this case. Upon UV illumination, PGEs in the space charge region of n-ZnO can tunnel through the transport barrier (the small conduction band offset and thin insulator) driven by the applied bias, and PGHs drift to the n-ZnO side, resulting in a much stronger photoelectric signal compared with that in the case of visible light. Under reverse bias (Fig. 5(c)), the photogenerated minority carriers (PGEs in the depleted p-Si region and PGHs in the depleted n-ZnO region) can pass through the insulator owing to the strong external electric field and so the photocurrent that is composed of the majority carrier flow and the minority carrier flow is larger than the photocurrent of the PD at forward bias. The IPCE curve of the n-ZnO MW/p-Si PDs at 0 V bias was measured and is shown in Fig. 5(d). It can be seen that a distinct spectral peak is formed near 371 nm, which corresponds to the band gap of ZnO (3.37 eV). Obviously, the quantum efficiency in the UV range is higher than that in the visible range, in line with the photoresponsive behavior mentioned above.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated a single ZnO MW/Si film heterostructure PD, which showed an ultrafast response time of ∼7.4 ms and a high sensitivity of ∼2 × 104 for UV light and ∼5 × 103 for visible light. The fabricated UV-visible PD was driven by the photovoltaic effect and could output a maximum power of ∼1.7 nW under 325 nm irradiation and ∼0.5 nW under 514 nm irradiation. The Isc and Voc showed square root and logarithmical dependences on the light intensity, respectively.
