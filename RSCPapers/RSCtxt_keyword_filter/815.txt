    , Accepted 1st November 2018First published on 9th November 2018AbstractCoupling ferroelectric materials with semiconductor materials can improve the performance of photovoltaic cells. The BaTiO3/TiO2(n) (B/T(n)) photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is composed of a BaTiO3 core, a high performance and frequently-used ferroelectric material, and TiO2 nanoparticles, a common semiconductor material. A hysteresis loop, 105 μC cm−2 remnant polarization and 7 kV cm−1 coercive field of the photoanode demonstrate its ferroelectricity. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the dye-sensitized photoanode after polarization (B/T(n)PD) is superior to that of unpolarized (B/T(n)D) by about 2 mA cm−2, regardless of the direction of polarization. The DSSC based on the B/T(4)PD photoanode exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.29% and a Jsc of 14.44 mA cm−2. Reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) are carried out to investigate the light absorption, charge injection and separation processes in B/T(n). Spontaneous polarization changes the adsorption state of the dye, which increases the light absorption efficiency, electron injection efficiency, incident light to photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) and Jsc. The discovery reported in this paper provides a method for modulating the interaction of adsorbed molecules with solids by means of electric field changes. This study deepens the understanding of the mechanism of charge transport and photovoltage generation in photovoltaic cells.
1 Introduction
Driven by the environmental and energy crisis, more and more attention has been paid to solar energy conversion. Extensive studies have been carried out on photovoltaic devices.1–7 At present, there are two main types of photovoltaic devices namely semiconductor photovoltaic devices (SMPVDs) and ferroelectric photovoltaic devices (FEPVDs). An efficient photovoltaic device must have a built-in electric field to separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs as well as facilitate their transport.8 In the SMPVDs, the built-in electric field is induced by the contact of different conduction types, p–n junction, or of different band gap materials, heterojunction.9–13 Hence, the maximum open-circuit voltage (Voc) is less than the band gap of the semiconductor material, generally 1 to 3 V. In FEPVDs, the built-in electric field results from spontaneous polarization of the ferroelectric materials. Therefore, FEPVDs can produce a Voc of 10 V, larger than the band gap of the semiconductor material and the Voc of SMPVDs.14 As for the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the narrow band gap of semiconductor materials makes SMPVDs absorb light in a wide range from ultraviolet to near infrared to obtain a high Jsc over 20 mA cm−2.15 In contrast, the Jsc for most FEPVDs is very low, generally on the order of nA cm−2 to μA cm−2. The low Jsc is usually ascribed to the wide band gap of ferroelectric materials, leading to a narrow light absorption range which is usually in the ultraviolet region and a poor light absorption coefficient. The low Jsc of FEPVDs greatly limits their photovoltaic performance and brings the power conversion efficiency (PCE) below 2%, which is inferior to that of most SMPVDs.2,16
Being attracted by the high Voc of FEPVDs and high Jsc of SMPVDs, researchers have coupled ferroelectric materials with semiconductor materials to enhance the performance of photovoltaic cells. For instance, Liu et al.17,18 fabricated a Si solar cell without a p–n junction and utilized the bound surface charges of BaTiO3 to separate charge carriers and observed a photovoltaic effect on the cell with positively polarized BaTiO3. Li et al.8 deposited a PbTiO3 thin film on a Si-based p–n junction to form a ferroelectric-p–n junction structure (PTO/p–n cell), which exhibited coupled photovoltaic properties. The photovoltaic properties of the PTO/p–n cell could be tuned by controlling the direction of the polarized voltage and were better with negative polarization. Yang et al.19 investigated the Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVDs) inserted in a P(VDF-TrFE) film, a kind of ferroelectric polymer material, and the performances of OPVDs were all enhanced irrespective of positive or negative polarization. Xiao et al.20 found that OPVDs with P(VDF-TrFE) nanoparticles had the best PCE of 6.64% after positive polarization, which was among the highest values reported for PCDTBT-based solar cells. In addition, NH3CH3PbI perovskite has both semiconductor and ferroelectric properties and its performance can be improved by ferroelectric polarization. Chen et al.21 identified that the performance of perovskite solar cells was affected by CH3NH3PbI3 ferroelectric polarization, which regulated the interface band structure of perovskite solar cells. They found that the photovoltaic efficiency of perovskite solar cells reduced after negative polarization and improved after positive polarization. Chen et al.2 also investigated the ferroelectric properties of the MAPbI3−xClx thin films and developed a new type of ferroelectric solar cell based on the TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure. The increase of PCE by 74 times and the increase of Jsc by 12 times after +2 V positive polarization suggested the absolutely dominant role of the polarization electric field in MAPbI3−xClx in enabling efficient charge separation and transport. On the other hand, the photovoltaic performance was greatly suppressed after −2 V negative polarization of the device. Feng et al.22 and Zhong et al.23 both used ferroelectric BaTiO3 to fabricate DSSCs. However, they didn't apply the ferroelectric polarization properties of BaTiO3.
In this work, we design and fabricate DSSCs coupling with a ferroelectric material. The photoanode of the photovoltaic device centers on the BaTiO3 core, a ferroelectric material, which is surrounded by TiO2 nanoparticles, a semiconductor material with dye molecules. Interior BaTiO3 affords ferroelectric polarization and exterior TiO2 accepts electrons from dye molecules excited by photons as well as providing pathways for electron transport.22,24,25 The preliminary results demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization has a strong effect on the performance of DSSCs. The improvement of the performance of DSSCs results from the enhancement of Jsc not Voc, which is ascribed to the changes of the adsorption state of dye molecules at the interface of TiO2 in the electric field induced by the ferroelectric polarization. Moreover, the enhancement of Jsc has nothing to do with the polarization direction (positive or negative polarization), due to the lack of a macroscopic electric field in DSSCs.
2 Results and discussion
BaTiO3 is a widely used ferroelectric material and its ferroelectricity arises from its tetragonal crystal structure.26–28 At room temperature, BaTiO3 exists in both the non-ferroelectric cubic phase and ferroelectric tetragonal phase.26,29 The cubic phase and the tetragonal phase can be distinguished by the peak splitting phenomenon near 45 degrees. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the BaTiO3 powder and the B/T(4) film. The peaks of BaTiO3 represented in asterisks (*) match well with the standard cubic phase of BaTiO3 (JCPDF no. 01-074-1964). The XRD pattern of the B/T(4) film confirms the anatase phase of TiO2 with three diffraction peaks centered at 25.207°, 37.772°, and 48.023° corresponding to the standard anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDF no. 00-021-1272). It is evident that TiO2 can be formed on BaTiO3 by TiCl4 treatment. Fig. 1b shows the HR-XRD patterns of the BaTiO3 powder, the BaTiO3 film and the B/T(4) film ranging from 44° to 46°. We can observe that the BaTiO3 powder reveals the cubic phase with one diffraction peak at 45.25° corresponding to the lattice plane of 200 (JCPDF no. 01-074-1964). The BaTiO3 film and the B/T(4) film show the tetragonal phase with diffraction peaks at 44.90° and 45.34°. The presence of the cubic phase may be related to no annealing process and a too small particle size. In contrast, the BaTiO3 film and the B/T(4) film with the tetragonal phase, confirmed by the two peaks at 44.90° and 45.34° matching with the lattice planes of 002 and 200 (JCPDF no. 00-005-0626), go through an annealing process at 450 °C which makes BaTiO3 particles crystallize better. We also employ XPS spectra to investigate the presence and chemical states of Ba, O and Ti in B/T(4). More detailed discussion can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of the BaTiO3 powder (1) and the B/T(4) film (2), and (b) HR-XRD patterns of the B/T(4) film (1), the BaTiO3 film (2) and the BaTiO3 powder (3). 
BaTiO3 and B/T(n) microstructures are investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2a reveals that the BaTiO3 particles in the film after annealing at 450 °C have an average size of about 50 nm. The surface of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles is smooth and irregular with no characteristic crystal plane. The BaTiO3 nanoparticles are closely linked together because of high temperature annealing. The particle morphology of the film with different cycles of TiCl4 treatment is recorded by TEM (Fig. 2b–f). There are small particles about 8–10 nm growing one by one around the big particles with a size of 50 nm. The amount of small particles increases, but the diameter of small particles does not increase with the increase of cycles of TiCl4 treatment. The lattice spacing measured for the crystalline plane in the big particle region and the small particle region is shown in Fig. 2g. The lattice spacing of big particles is 0.23 nm matching well with the (111) plane of cubic BaTiO3 (JCPDF no. 01-074-1964). And the lattice spacing of small particles is 0.35 nm matching well with the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDF no. 00-021-1272). These observations evidence that small anatase TiO2 particles obtained from TiCl4 hydrolysis can be deposited on big BaTiO3 particles. The thickness of the B/T(4) film is only 4 μm as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image of the B/T(4) film (Fig. 2h). The layer of TiO2 can't be seen obviously in Fig. 2h, i.e. modification of the BaTiO3 film by TiCl4 treatment has almost no influence on the thickness of the B/T(4) film in spite of 4 cycles of TiCl4 treatment. Fig. 2i and j display the surface SEM images of the BaTiO3 film and B/T(4) film, respectively. We observe that the surface of the BaTiO3 film and B/T(4) film is all porous. The particle size in B/T(4) becomes larger than that in BaTiO3, suggesting that the TiO2 particles grow and fill up the interspaces between BaTiO3 nanoparticles after the TiCl4 treatment.

B/T(4) is further studied using the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. Fig. 3 shows two sets of diffraction rings which are assigned to the (101) and (103) planes of anatase TiO2 and the (200) and (210) planes of cubic BaTiO3, respectively. These images confirmed the crystalline nature of the synthesized BaTiO3 and TiO2 by TiCl4 treatment.

Besides the crystal phase, the microstructure of the ferroelectric material can also affect its ferroelectric properties. We analyzed the ferroelectric properties of the films and investigated the influence of ferroelectric polarization on the photoelectric conversion performance of the device. The polarization–electric field (P–E) curves of the BaTiO3 film and the B/T(4) film are obtained at room temperature (Fig. 4a). The values of the remnant polarization Pr and coercive field Ec determined from Fig. 4a are presented in Table 1.

The ferroelectric polarization hysteresis loop of the BaTiO3 film is less obvious and the Pr is about 0. In contrast, the B/T(4) film possesses a typical ferroelectric polarization hysteresis loop and shows a higher Pr value of 105 μC cm−2, indicating that the B/T(4) film has better ferroelectric properties. The BaTiO3 film with the tetragonal phase having no ferroelectricity may be due to the small particle size, resulting in the ordered electrical domain which is not easy to maintain and the weak interaction between particles. However, the ordered domain would keep their direction with the help of TiO2 particles formed by TiCl4 treatment after the electric field disappeared.
In view of high efficiency of the preparation techniques, we compare the effect of the different layers of BaTiO3 and TiCl4 treatment times. It found that the monolayer BaTiO3 with four cycles of TiCl4 treatment (B/T(4)) has the best performance (Fig. S2 and S3†), and therefore the B/T(4) is adopted in the following experiments and discussions. To verify the ferroelectric polarization effect, the B/T(4) thin film electrode is polarized in different directions as the photoanode to assemble DSSCs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4b and the photoelectric conversion parameters are listed in Table 2. It can be observed that the Jsc of the B/T(4)P−D photoanode and the B/T(4)P+D photoanode increases obviously as shown in Fig. 4b. The Jsc values of B/T(4)D, B/T(4)P-D and B/T(4)P+D are 12.59 mA cm−2, 14.40 mA cm−2 and 14.44 mA cm−2, respectively. Compared to the B/T(4)D photoanode, the B/T(4)PD photoanode enhances the Jsc by about 2 mA cm−2. The FF shows no change and the Voc shows little change only employing the B/T(4)P+D photoanode with 20 mV enhancement. As a result, the DSSCs employing the B/T(4)PD photoanode achieve higher PCEs, which are 7.29% with the B/T(4)P+D photoanode and 7.11% with the B/T(4)P−D photoanode, respectively. After polarization, the improvement of PCE is about one percentage point compared to the B/T(4)D photoanode with a PCE of 6.22%. These results are much higher than those of the literature reports.30

According to recent reports, the Voc and Jsc can be adjusted by using the ferroelectric polarization effect.2,19–21,31 This is not in agreement with our results. Since the dramatic increase of Jsc is responsible for the efficiency enhancement, we analyze the influence of polarization on Jsc first.
IPCEs of B/T(4)PD and B/T(4)D shown in Fig. 4c have the same profile. They all have a peak at about 550 nm which is the position of MLCT (metal ligand charge transfer) absorption of the photosensitizing dye, and an absorption edge at 750 nm. The B/T(4)PD photoanode exhibits a higher IPCE in the whole spectral response region compared to the B/T(4)D photoanode. For example, at 550 nm, the IPCE value is 69%, 72%, and 73% for the photoanodes of B/T(4)D, B/T(4)P−D, and B/T(4)P+D, respectively.
The IPCE can be described as the product of the efficiency of three processes, IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ϕinjηcc,32 where LHE represents the light harvesting efficiency, ϕinj represents the electron injection efficiency, and ηcc represents the charge collection efficiency. The light harvesting efficiency represents the ratio of absorbed photons by the dye to incident photons, and can be measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The reflectance spectra of the B/T(4)PD and B/T(4)D photoanodes are measured as shown in Fig. 4d. The reflectivity of the B/T(4)PD is about 5% lower than that of the B/T(4)D. There is no obvious difference in light reflectance properties between the B/T(4)P+D photoanode and the B/T(4)P−D photoanode. This indicates that the dye molecules incorporated in the B/T(4)PD photoanode absorb much more incident light. However, the dye absorption amount shows almost no change (Table 2). Hence, the dye absorption amount is not the reason for light absorption enhancement.
The dye adsorption process occurs by the reaction of carboxyl groups with the surface of TiO2 to form an ester linkage () at a wavenumber of 1730 cm−1, a chelating linkage () and a bridging linkage () at wavenumbers of 1600 cm−1 and 1550 cm−1 to accelerate electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.33,34 As a result, the linkage reaction between the dye and the surface of TiO2 is important for the performance of the DSSCs. The FTIR spectra of N3 dye ([4,4′-(LL)]2Ru(NCS)2) anchored to the films of B/T(4)D, B/T(4)P+D and B/T(4)P−D are shown in Fig. 5 and the absorption bands of the three modes of interfacial binding are listed in Table 3. The absorption bands of the three modes all appear in the B/T(4)D film at wavenumbers of 1726 cm−1, 1610 cm−1 and 1550 cm−1, the B/T(4)P−D film at wavenumbers of 1723 cm−1, 1610 cm−1 and 1545 cm−1 and the B/T(4)P+D film at wavenumbers of 1721 cm−1, 1610 cm−1 and 1543 cm−1. After ferroelectric polarization, the absorption bands are shifted towards smaller wavenumbers slightly for the B/T(4)P−D film and the B/T(4)P+D film. Moreover, besides the peak at 1610 cm−1, the B/T(4)P+D film and the B/T(4)P−D film also have a new peak at 1650 cm−1 compared to the B/T(4)D film. We think that the peak at 1650 cm−1 is of the same vibration type as the peak at 1610 cm−1. Ferroelectric polarization makes the peak at 1610 cm−1 producing a large displacement leading to the appearance of the peak at 1650 cm−1. Zhang et al.34 reported that surface modification made the peak at 1623 cm−1 move towards the peak at 1632 cm−1 which led to the enhancement of the electron injection efficiency and the photoelectric performance. Ferroelectric polarization causes a greater displacement of 40 cm−1 from the peak at 1610 cm−1 to 1650 cm−1 which may be beneficial for the electron injection efficiency and the photoelectric performance. In a word, ferroelectric polarization changes the dye adsorption state on the TiO2 surface which induces infrared peak position displacement, especially the appearance of the peak at 1650 cm−1. Though the dye absorption amount is almost the same, the DSSCs employing the B/T(4)PD photoanode show a higher photocurrent compared to those employing the B/T(4)D photoanode. Thus, ferroelectric polarization of the photoanode before dye sensitization and the change of the dye absorption state induced by ferroelectric polarization are important factors for performance enhancement.

In order to obtain the electron collection efficiency, electron transport and recombination processes are analyzed by IMPS and IMVS methods. Fig. 6a and b show complex plane plots of the IMPS and IMVS spectrum of B/T(4)D, B/T(4)P+D and B/T(4)P−D, respectively. The electron transport time (τd) and the electron lifetime (τn) are listed in Table 4, which are calculated from the relationship τ = (2πfmin)−1, where fmin is the frequency of the minimum point of the semicircle in the IMPS and the IMVS plots, respectively. For the B/T(4)PD photoanode, the electron transport time constants (τd) decrease apparently, which means a faster electron transport rate. Both positive and negative polarisation increased the electron transport rate, which means that electron transport in the film is not driven by the electron field rather by the concentration gradient. The faster electron transport rate is favourable for enhancing the Jsc, which is also consistent with the data from Table 2. The electron lifetime constants (τn) of the B/T(4)PD photoanode show a little increase. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) is the percentage of photoinjected electrons that reach the electron collector without recombining with either the oxidized dye or the oxidized component in the redox electrolyte. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) can be calculated from the relationship: ηcc = 1 − (τd/τn). The obtained ηcc values for photoanodes of B/T(4)P+D, B/T(4)P−D and B/T(4) D are 99.8%, 99.7% and 99.0%, respectively. The B/T(4)PD photoanode has a higher electron transport rate and charge collection efficiency. This is another reason for the higher Jsc.

The electron lifetime constants (τn) of the B/T(4) photoanode measured by IMVS (Table 4) show a little increase after polarization. Little change of the electron lifetime constants (τn) has no evident effect on the recombination rate and photovoltage of the DSSCs employing the photoanodes of B/T(4)D, B/T(4)P+D and B/T(4)P−D. In addition, the values of electron lifetime constants (τn) as shown in Table 4 indicate fewer recombination sites existing in the photoanodes of B/T(4)D and B/T(4)PD. The slow recombination rates can result in good Voc values, which are 745 mV for the B/T(4)D photoanode, 745 mV for the B/T(4)P−D photoanode and 765 mV for the B/T(4)P+D photoanode, respectively.
3 Experimental
3.1 Materials
Titanium tetrachloride, barium chloride dihydrate, potassium hydroxide, acetic acid and Triton X-100 were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%, GC, Alfa), LiI (AR, Acros), I2 (AR, Acros), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, AR, Aldrich) were used as received without further purification. 3-Hexyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide (HMII) was synthesized according to the literature.35,36 N3 dye ([4,4′-(LL)]2Ru(NCS)2) was purchased from Suzhou Zhongsheng chemical Co., Ltd. FTO conductive glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, 14/sq, Wuhan Geao Science and Education instrument Co., Ltd.) was used as the working electrode substrate.
3.2 Synthesis of BaTiO3 and preparation of BaTiO3 paste
BaTiO3 was synthesized by using a hydrothermal method.23,37 Titanium tetrachloride (1 mL), barium chloride dihydrate (4.16 g), potassium hydroxide (16.83 g), and deionized water (54 g) were first mixed. After being stirred continuously for 1 h at ambient temperature, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave for the hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 10 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the solid product was washed with 0.1 M aqueous acetic acid solution and deionized water. Finally, centrifugation afforded a white BaTiO3 powder which was further dried at 105 °C overnight. The BaTiO3 paste was produced by mixing the BaTiO3 powder (0.8 g) with acetic acid (0.8 mL) and deionized water (4 mL).23 Meanwhile, Triton X-100 (0.2 mL) was added for adjusting the stability of the paste. The paste was mechanically stirred vigorously overnight for BaTiO3 powder dispersion.
3.3 Preparation of the photoanode
BaTiO3 films were fabricated on the FTO substrates using a doctor-blade method and the electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. The annealed electrodes were immersed into an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (0.05 M) for post-treatment at 70 °C for 60 min.23,38,39 The electrodes were flushed with deionized water, dried and annealed again at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiCl4 treatment may be repeated n times to obtain the BaTiO3/TiO2(n) (B/T(n)) film for a thicker TiO2 layer.
3.4 Cell fabrication
For the ferroelectric polarization experiments, the B/T(n) thin film was polarized with a DC voltage of 60 V for 4 min using FTO glass as the counter electrode in air to become “B/T(n)P+” or “B/T(n)P−” according to whether a “+” or “−” electrode is connected to B/T(n). The B/T(n) thin film and the counter electrode contacted each other closely without gap. The dye sensitization of B/T(n), B/T(n)P+ or B/T(n)P− thin film electrodes was preceded by immersing these electrodes in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of the N3 dye for 24 h to obtain B/T(n)D, B/T(n)P+D or B/T(n)P−D, respectively. Before that the B/T thin films were heat-treated at 100 °C for 40 min in order to eliminate the physisorbed water. The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M TBP, and 0.6 M HMII in MPN. The cell was fabricated by sandwiching the sensitized BaTiO3/TiO2 electrode and a platinum foil counter electrode with the electrolyte.
3.5 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by using a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku Co.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at a scan rate of 8° min−1. The particle morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, 15 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN, 200 kV). The polarization-electric (P–E) hysteresis loop was characterized using a ferroelectric test system (Precision Premier II, Radiant Technologies Inc., Alphareta, GA at 10 kHz). The photoelectric performance of DSSCs with an active area of 0.2 cm2 was measured using a Keithley 2611 Source Meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160–1000). The intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) measurements were carried out by using a Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system. In IMPS/IMVS measurements, a green light emitting diode (λmax = 520 nm) provided both the DC and AC components of the illumination. The optical reflectance spectra of the BaTiO3/TiO2 electrode were taken on a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) with an integrating sphere. The amount of dye adsorption on the BaTiO3/TiO2 electrode was also measured using a spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) with 0.1 M NaOH solution as the desorption solution. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were obtained with a Model Tensor 27 Bruker Spectrometer using KBr pellets.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated a ferroelectric/semiconductor (B/T(n)) composite structure as a photoanode and investigated the important effect of ferroelectric polarization on the performance of the cells. It was found that the presence of the polarization field could influence the dye adsorption state, enhance the adsorption interaction and improve the PCE. There was only a small influence of the polarization field on the electron transport, because in DSSCs, the electron transport depended on the concentration gradient rather than the migration under the electric field. Moreover, the Voc depends only on the conduction band position of the semiconductor and the redox level of the electrolyte and not on the barrier of the p–n junction in DSSCs. As a result, the polarization field didn't affect the Voc of the DSSCs. Spontaneous polarization and ferroelectric materials have a role in the photoelectric conversion system without the macroscopic electrical field like DSSCs. This may prompt an investigation on the utilization of ferroelectric materials in photoelectric conversion devices to improve their performance and deepen the understanding of the mechanism of charge transport and photovoltage generation. The discovery reported in this paper also provides a method for modulating the interaction of adsorbed molecules with solids by means of electric field changes.
