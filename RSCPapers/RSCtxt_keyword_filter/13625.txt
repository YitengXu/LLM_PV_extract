    AbstractThe synthesis of new soluble tetrasubstituted quater- and quinquethiophenesilanes and their application as donor materials in bulk heterojunction solar cells and photodetectors has been described. The solubility of these compounds is governed by their 3D molecular structure, solubilizing linear n-hexyl (for quaterthiophenesilane), and branched 2-ethylhexyl groups (for quinquethiophenesilane). It was demonstrated that oligothiophenesilanes blended with fullerene derivatives can be used as promising active layer materials in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. The maximum power conversion efficiency of the devices increased proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene units and reached 1.0% and 1.4% for quater- and quinquethiophenesilane respectively. Photodetectors based on the oligothiophenesilane/fullerene composites showed unusually high speeds of operation, which suggests another direction for the practical implementation of the three-dimensional organic semiconductor family designed herein.

Broader context
The manuscript describes the synthesis of tetrakis oligothienylsilanes and their application as donor materials in molecular bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and photodetectors. Molecular BHJ solar cells have recently emerged as an important research area in the field of energy and environmental science as an alternative energy source. They are capable of solving problems inherent to organic solar cells containing polymeric donor materials, such as the complicated purification of the polymers used, their low solubility, ordering ability, etc.Tetrakis(terthienylsilane) (1) was used as the donor in the very first prototype of molecular BHJ solar cells in 2006 but demonstrated only modest efficiency due to absorption in the short-wavelength range, whose overlap with the solar light spectrum is quite narrow. In this work the synthesis of longer systems of this family is reported for the first time, and results indicate that the lengthening of the oligothiophene branches leads to a significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency. The suggested strategy of synthesis based on the replacement of the trimethylsilyl end group by bromine is of particular interest for the preparation of novel 3D light-harvesting systems with longer conjugated chains.

Introduction
In recent years, a huge number of research papers have been devoted to organic macromolecular systems exhibiting conducting and semiconducting properties. Such systems are a potential alternative to inorganic semiconductors in the manufacturing of low-weight flexible optoelectronic devices such as thin-film transistors, photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, etc.1–3 Electronic devices based on inorganic conductors (e.g. metals) or semiconductors (e.g. silicon) are produced utilizing technologically sophisticated processes, frequently under high-vacuum and high-temperature conditions, which significantly influence the prime cost. At the same time, semiconducting and conducting organic macromolecular systems can be easily processed using high throughput roll-to-roll wet technologies relying on printing and coating techniques.
Derivatives of oligo- and polythiophenes are particularly interesting since they may exhibit a combination of high-charge carrier mobility, good solubility in organic solvents and advanced optical properties.4,5 The thiophene-based p-type semiconductors possessing molecular architectures ranging from linear to hyperbranched have been widely investigated.6 The most promising results have been reported for conjugated polymers. In particular, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most popular solution-processed p-type semiconductors and is widely utilized in organic field-effect transistors7,8 and organic solar cells.9 There is, however, one significant drawback of linear π-conjugated polymeric systems, which is the anisotropy of their optical and electrical properties, resulting in the necessity to control the molecular orientation during the production of electronic thin-film devices. This significantly complicates the preparation of their ordered films from solutions, i.e. by printing techniques. An alternative approach is the development of branched and hyperbranched semiconducting macromolecular systems with isotropic electronic and optical properties.10
Branched soluble oligothiophenes have been applied as electron-donor materials in photovoltaic cells11–16 and in field-effect transistors.17–19 Star-shaped silicon-containing molecules with three α,α′-bi- and terthienyl arms showed advanced photoluminescent characteristics.20,21 Although trisubstituted oligothiophenesilanes have been reported from bi- to quinquethiophenesilanes,18 the latter is poorly soluble. Bi- and terthienylsilanes are the only known examples of tetrasubstituted oligothiophenesilanes, and demonstrate higher solubility due to their 3D branched structure.11,22 Among them, terthienylsilane 1 (Fig. 1) has been investigated as an electron-donor material for photovoltaic cells, showing a power conversion efficiency of 0.29%.11 Taking into account the fact that terthiophenesilanes absorb light only in the short-wavelength range, this value might be considered as rather encouraging. Similar oligothiophenesilanes with higher conjugation length and absorption extending into the red and infrared spectral ranges might be considered as promising electron-donor materials for organic solar cells. In the present work we report the synthesis of new soluble tetrasubstituted quater- and quinquethiophenesilanes (compounds 2 and 3 in Fig. 1), investigation of their optical properties, and the evaluation of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells and photodetectors based on these compounds.

Experimental section

n-Butyllithium solutions (1.6 and 2.5 M) in hexane, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), 2-bromothiophene, 1,2-dibromoethane (Acros), tetrachlorosilane (Penta), 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) Pd(PPh3)4 and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene-palladium(II) dichloride dichloromethane complex Pd(dppf)Cl22·CH2Cl2  (Aldrich), 5-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene (8) and 5-bromo-5′-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (10) were obtained from H. C. Starck Clevios GmbH and used without further purification. THF, diethyl ether, toluene, and hexane used as the solvents were dried and purified according to the standard procedures.23 Trimethyl(2-thienyl)silane (4), 2,2-bithien-5-yl(trimethyl)silane (5) and 2-(5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithien-5-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (9) were prepared as described previously.17,24Tetrakis(5′′-hexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthien-5-yl)silane (1) was prepared according to the procedure reported in the literature.11 All reactions, unless stated otherwise, were carried out under an inert atmosphere using anhydrous solvents. The experimental details of the synthesis of all final and precursor compounds can be found in the supporting information.‡
Silica gel (40–60 mesh, Merck) was used for conventional column chromatography, while thin layer chromatography was performed using Sorbfil TLC plates (Sorbpolymer).

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker WP-250 SY spectrometer at 250.13 MHz using a signal of CDCl3 (δ = 7.25) as the internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer at 125.76 MHz, while 29Si NMR spectra were recorded on the same instrument at 99.36 MHz. The samples consisted of 5% solutions of the test substances in CDCl3.
GPC analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu GPC (Japan), equipped with an RID-10A refractometer and SPD-M10AVP diode array detectors. Phenomenex (USA) 7.8 × 300 mm and 19 × 250 mm columns filled with sorbent Phenogel with a pore size of 500 Å were used for analytic and preparative GPC chromatography. Elution was performed using freshly distilled THF.
Mass spectra (MALDI-MS) were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics Reflex-III mass spectrometer in the positive ion regime using the reflection mode with a target voltage of 20 kV. 2,4,9-Anthracenetriol was used as a matrix. The samples were prepared by dissolving the analyzed compounds in chloroform (10−4–10−6 M) and then mixing them with a matrix solution (20 mg mL−1) in chloroform in a 1:1 v/v ratio.
Preparation and characterization of solar cells
Compounds 1–3 (10 mg) and [70]PCBM (20 mg) were dissolved together in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The resulting blend solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter. ITO glass slides with a size of 15 mm × 15 mm were cleaned by successive steps of sonication in toluene, acetone and, finally, in isopropanol. On the clean ITO surface a PEDOT-PSS (Clevios PH) solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm. Then the PEDOT-PSS films were annealed at 175 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, the photoactive blends were spin-coated at 800–900 rpm in air. The spin-coated blend films were dried in vacuum (ca. 10−3 mbar) at ambient temperature for 1–2 h. In the next step, a top electrode comprising 0.8 nm of lithium fluoride followed by 100 nm of aluminium was deposited in high vacuum (∼10−6 mbar).
The I–V characteristics of the devices were obtained under darkroom conditions and under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 solar radiation provided by a KHS Steuernagel solar simulator. The intensity of the illumination was checked before every measurement using a calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response. Short circuit current density ISC values were not corrected for the mismatch between the solar simulator illumination and the AM1.5 spectrum. The incident photon to collected electron (IPCE) spectra were measured with a SRS 830 lock-in amplifier using monochromatic light from a 75 W Xe-lamp as a source of excitation.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed for ca. 10−3 M solutions of compounds 2 and 3 in rigorously dried 1,2-dichlorobenzene in a cell equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode (d = 2 mm2), a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and SCE as the reference electrode. The scan rate was 200 mV s−1. A 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte.
Results and discussion
The approaches used for the preparation of bi- and terthiophenesilanes were very similar: the lithiation of the appropriate oligothiophene fragment followed by treatment with the corresponding alkoxy- or chlorosilane.11,22 However, the use of this technique for the synthesis of quaterthiophenesilanes is impossible, because of too low solubility of the initial α-hexylquaterthiophene at the temperature of lithiation (0 °C and below). The same problem holds for the quinquethiophenesilanes. Therefore, in this work we have successfully designed and realized a substantially new synthetic route based on the Suzuki coupling of the corresponding bi- or terthienyl boronic esters to a novel bromobithienylsilane branching core (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of quater- and quinquethiophenesilanes 2 and 3. 
The synthesis of the tetrakis(5′-bromo-2,2′-bithien-5-yl)methylsilane branching core 7 itself featured a non-trivial task: the procedure elaborated earlier for a similar bromothienylsilane branching core25 based on the reaction of thienyllithium derivatives with alkoxy- or chlorosilane in the case of 5-bromo-2,2′-bithienyllithium led to very low yields of the target compound. Therefore, we applied an alternative technique developed recently for the synthesis of tris(5′-bromo-2,2′-bithien-5-yl)methylsilane.24 According to this scheme, trimethyl(2-thienyl)silane (4) was used as a starting reagent. Its lithiation with n-butyllithium followed by the lithium-magnesium bromide exchange stage resulted in the formation of [5-(trimethylsilyl)thiophen-2-yl]magnesium bromide. This was subsequently used in the Kumada coupling with 2-bromothiophene in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 as a catalyst, forming 2,2-bithien-5-yl(trimethyl)silane (5) with a yield of 89%.24 The lithiation of this compound followed by the reaction with tetrachlorosilane led to tetrakis(5′-trimethylsilyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)silane (6) with a reaction yield of 59% (according to GPC). The bromination of the latter with NBS in a DMF–toluene mixture led to the desired branching center 7 with a reaction yield of 76%. It is worth noting that the substitution of the trimethylsilyl groups in compound 6 with bromine broke the external Si–C bonds, while all internal Si–C bonds around the central tetrabithienyl-substituted silicon atom remained unaffected.
The key stage in the preparation of compounds 2 and 3 was a Suzuki coupling reaction between the branching core (7) obtained as described above and the corresponding bi- or terthienyl boronic esters: 2-(5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithien-5-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (9) or 2-[5′′-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthien-5-yl]-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (12), respectively. Compound 9 was obtained by the lithiation of 5-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene (8) followed by the reaction with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in 99% isolated yield.17 Compound 12 was prepared by a similar technique from 5′′-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (11) in 93% isolated yield. Compound 11 was synthesized by means of a Kumada coupling reaction from 5-bromo-5′-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (10) and freshly prepared 2-thienylmagnesium bromide with a reaction yield of 99%.
The final Suzuki reactions were carried out in toluene in the presence of the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst using 20% mol excess of the corresponding boronic ester. It was also found that the addition of small amounts of ethanol to the reaction medium increases the reaction rate and selectivity of the process. The reaction yields were in the range of 37–59%. Pure compounds 2 and 3 were obtained after purification by preparative GPC chromatography.
The optical properties of the tetrakis(oligothiophene)silanes 1–3 were studied by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy (Table 1). In order to exclude possible effects of self-absorption, the measurements were performed in THF with concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−5 M. The characteristic absorption and luminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 2. It might be observed that both absorption and luminescence maxima shift to longer wavelengths with increasing number of the thiophene units in the prepared series of compounds. At the same time, the increase in the molar extinction coefficient ε from 120000 L mol−1 cm−1 to 210000 L mol−1 cm−1 was observed along with the improvement of the photoluminescence quantum yield ΦF from 7 to 21%. These results indicate that increasing the conjugation length of the oligothiophene units improves light harvesting properties of these compounds and makes them more suitable for solar cell applications.

The electrochemical oxidation and reduction of new compounds 2 and 3 were investigated using the cyclic voltammetry technique. First, it was revealed that all compounds undergo irrreversible reductions in the potential range from 0 to −1.9 V with respect to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). At the same time, they are oxidized reversibly with half-wave potentials of +0.72 V (2) and +0.62 V (3). The next oxidation occurring at +1.20 V was revealed to be multielectronic and irreversible (shown for 2 in Fig. 3). Onsets of the first oxidation peaks in the CV curves for compounds 2 and 3 were detected at the potentials of +0.66 V and +0.58 V. Using known approaches,26 it is possible to estimate the HOMO level energies of compounds 2 and 3 as −5.12 eV and −5.04 eV, respectively. The investigation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT under the same conditions gives a HOMO energy of −4.9 eV, which corresponds to recently published data.27 Therefore, compounds 2 and 3 have HOMO level energies ca. 0.2 eV lower than the conventional semiconducting polymer material P3HT. It is known that the maximal achievable open circuit voltage (VOC) of organic solar cells corresponds to the size of the gap between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO levels.28 Taking this fact into account, we can expect that compounds 2 and 3 will generate a VOCca. 200 mV higher in bulk heterojunction solar cells than P3HT. Conventional devices comprising P3HT/PCBM blends usually yield a VOC of 620–640 mV. Therefore, a VOC of ∼800 mV could be expected for devices based on composites of compounds 2 or 3 with PCBM.

As compounds 2 and 3 absorb light efficiently only at short wavelengths (350–480 nm), it is necessary to combine them with an acceptor material which can harvest light in the red range of the visible spectrum. A conventional derivative of [70]fullerene called [70]PCBM ideally suits this purpose (Fig. 4). This material has significantly improved the performance of MDMO-PPV based organic solar cells.29

Our preliminary tests showed that the best device output parameters can be obtained using blends of compounds 2 and 3 with [70]PCBM in a 1:2 weight ratio. As follows from the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5, thin films of these composites demonstrate good photon harvesting in the whole visible range (up to 750 nm). This is a good prerequisite for achieving high short-circuit current (ISC) densities in the photovoltaic devices based on these material combinations. Indeed, bulk heterojunction organic solar cells comprising solution processed blends of compounds 2 and 3 with [70]PCBM as photoactive layer materials demonstrated clear photovoltaic effects as follows from the I–V curves shown in Fig. 6. The output parameters extracted from these curves are listed in Table 2.

We noted that a relatively high VOC of 750–800 mV obtained in the cells perfectly corresponds to the values estimated from the HOMO level energies of 2 and 3 deduced from the electrochemical measurements. At the same time, the fabricated photovoltaic devices yielded appreciably high short-circuit current densities of 5.0–6.0 mA cm−2. As may be seen from the I–V curves (Fig. 6) and the IPCE spectra (Fig. 7), devices comprising quinquethiophenesilane 3 generate higher photocurrent densities than analogous cells comprising quaterthiophenesilane 2.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra for devices comprising the 2/[70]PCBM (●) and 3/[70]PCBM blends (■) in the active layers. 
The most striking difference between the two studied material combinations was observed in the IPCE spectra in the range 350–500 nm. Note that pristine materials 2 and 3 have their absorption maxima lying exactly in this region. If we assume that the replacement of compound 2 with compound 3 in the blends and vice versa does not change the reflectance of the films dramatically, differences in the IPCE spectra should be attributed to the different contributions to the photocurrent generation from electron-donor quaterthiophenesilanes. Much higher IPCE values measured for 3/[70]PCBM devices at 350–500 nm suggest that in this case the donor quinquethiophenesilane contributes significantly to the photocurrent generation. On the contrary, much lower IPCE values in the spectrum of the 2/[70]PCBM system might result from poor charge-carrier generation and collection using photons absorbed by donor compound 2. Therefore, in this case, the acceptor material [70]PCBM is mostly responsible for the photocurrent generation. We presume that the observed differences in the photovoltaic performances of oligothiophenes 2 and 3 blended with [70]PCBM are related to the active layer morphology of the respective devices. It might be assumed that quinquethiophenesilane 3 possessing longer conjugated arms self-assembles in solid films to form 3D interpenetrating networks of the donor phase in the blends capable of efficient positive charge carrier generation and their transport to the anode. Shorter conjugated arms in the case of quaterthiophenesilane 2 make this self-assembling less efficient, therefore some isolated domains of the donor material might be formed in the blend. Excitons generated inside such domains do not provide free charge carriers, which results in significant recombination losses. To prove this hypothesis, additional studies will be carried out in the future.
Even with a minimal understanding of the underlying physical reasons, one can notice that the photovoltaic performance of star-shaped oligothiophenesilanes improves with an increase in the length of the attached oligothiophene substituents. Quaterthiophenesilane 2 significantly outperformed terthiophenesilane 1 reported previously,11 used in combination with [60]PCBM (1:3 component ratio) and [70]PCBM (1:2 optimal ratio). At the same time, quinquethiophenesilane 3 yielded better output parameters as compared to compound 2. This correlation suggests that it might be very promising to synthesize and investigate the photovoltaic performance of the novel silanes with sexithiophene and even longer oligothiophene side chains.
The performance of the solar cells comprising silanes 2 and 3 is most drastically limited by the disappointingly low fill factors at a level of 26–28%. Low fill factors usually indicate substantial charge transport problems arising in most cases from non-optimized active layer morphology. Pristine silane 2 has a strong tendency to self-assemble with the formation of distinct clusters visible in the films even to the naked eye. The presence of these clusters was also revealed by optical microscopy for the films of pristine material and its blend with [70]PCBM (Fig. 8). In contrast, compound 3 yielded quite smooth films showing no signs of phase separation on the optical scale or in AFM topography images. This is quite surprising, since the solubility of 3 is lower than the solubility of 2. Numerous pores which formed in the films of 3 and the 3/[70]PCBM blend during vacuum drying were visible. The evaporation of the last traces of the solvent trapped in the bulk might be accompanied by the formation of bubbles that penetrated through the top layer of the material, forming such pores.
 Fig. 8  Optical microscopy images of the films of (a) pristine 2 and (b) its blend with [70]PCBM. AFM images of (c) the thin films of pristine 3 and (d) the composite 3/[70]PCBM. 
Therefore, optical microscopy and AFM did not provide evidence for large scale phase separation in the 3/[70]PCBM blend. However, these data are not sufficient to conclude that in reality, photoactive materials do not segregate from each other in the blend. It is notable that the solubility of [70]PCBM in chlorobenzene (∼80 mg mL−1) is much higher than that of 3 (∼10 mg mL−1). Such a great difference in the solubilities of the donor and acceptor materials most probably results in a strong inhomogeneity of the film in the vertical direction.30 Thus the evaporation of the solvent during the film formation process should first result in the precipitation of the almost pure donor compound. The next layers of the growing film will contain increasing amounts of [70]PCBM. Finally, the upper layer of the film will be mainly composed of [70]PCBM.
On the one hand, such a diffusion bilayer architecture should be very beneficial for device performance since it solves the problem of charge recombination at the active layer/electrode interfaces. However, on the other hand, a “mix” of donor and acceptor materials might have an unfavorable morphology somewhere in the volume of the film. In such a case, even a large scale phase separation between the components will be hidden underneath an upper homogeneous part of the blend. Perhaps this is the reason why the studied devices yielded such low fill factors. In order to reveal the actual vertical morphology of our blends in the future, we plan to investigate the cross-sections of the films using special microscopy techniques.
On the basis of the obtained data, we can conclude that oligothiophenesilanes 2 and 3 are quite promising electron-donor materials for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. Further research in this direction might result in a substantial improvement in materials of this type and photovoltaic devices made thereof.
Another area for the application of organic photovoltaic devices is related to light sensing. Organic photodetectors have been developed intensively in parallel with organic solar cells during the last decade.31–35 Any photovoltaic cell that converts photons to free-charge carriers with high quantum efficiency and gives a fast electrical response under light radiation with low intensity might be used as a photodetector.
We have studied the transient characteristics of photovoltaic devices comprising 2/[70]PCBM blends in the photoactive layers. First, it was shown that these devices respond fairly well to light coming from a light-emitting diode modulated with a frequency of 5 kHz (Fig. 9). A deeper investigation of these devices was performed using short (10 ns) light pulses generated by a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The measurements were performed with a 60 Ω load resistance that corresponded to an RC constant of 0.3 μs for the investigated element. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the photovoltaic device gives a very quick response to the laser pulse even under zero bias voltage. The estimated response time was only 50–60 ns, which is remarkably short for a device with a relatively large active area (0.12 cm2). The response signal induced by a short-light pulse undergoes rapid decay within 0.7–0.8 μs. The decay time is defined by the RC constant of the device and can be potentially reduced by a factor of 3–5 via a corresponding decrease of the load resistance to 10–12 Ω. Photodetecting devices with such transient characteristics can be operated at frequencies of 1–2 MHz with the potential for an increase up to 5–10 MHz at least. We emphasize that the reference devices comprising P3HT/[70]PCBM blends in the active layer and possessing the same size and configuration yielded a much longer response time under the same measurement conditions (RC constant of the element 0.3 μs): 1–2 μs and decay time of 3–4 μs. In this case, the response and decay times cannot be improved significantly since they are defined by the internal processes and not the RC constant of the element. Thus the obtained results suggest that some inherent properties of star-shaped oligothiophenesilane 2 are responsible for the observed high-speed operation of the organic photodetectors.

Conclusions
We presented the preparation and systematic investigation of two new members of a family of three-dimensional star-shaped organic semiconductors: quaterthiophenesilane 2 and quinquethiophenesilane 3. To obtain these compounds we had developed a new synthetic protocol based on the Suzuki coupling of the novel 3D branching center tetrakis(5′-bromo-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)silane with substituted bithiophenylboronic or terthiophenylboronic esters.
We investigated the optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized compounds and applied them as the electron-donor materials for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. Power conversion efficiencies of ∼1.0% and ∼1.4% were obtained for devices based on the composites 2/[70]PCBM and 3/[70]PCBM, respectively. These values correspond to the state of the art results reported in the literature for solution-processed small molecular bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on oligothiophenes.11–16 At the same time, the investigated material combinations were shown to be very promising for applications in high-speed organic photodetectors. Response times as short as 50–60 ns were revealed for the fabricated devices in the experiments with short (10 ns) light pulses. Photodetectors based on the designed materials can operate with a frequency of 1–2 MHz even at zero bias voltage, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than for the reference devices based on a conventional P3HT/PCBM system.
Thus the presented work proves that oligothiophenesilanes can be considered as a very promising family of electron-donor materials for organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells. Further research in this direction mainly focused on the development of new highly soluble silanes with longer oligothiophene arms may result in breakthroughs in the field of solution-processed small molecular organic photovoltaics.

Broader context
The manuscript describes the synthesis of tetrakis oligothienylsilanes and their application as donor materials in molecular bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and photodetectors. Molecular BHJ solar cells have recently emerged as an important research area in the field of energy and environmental science as an alternative energy source. They are capable of solving problems inherent to organic solar cells containing polymeric donor materials, such as the complicated purification of the polymers used, their low solubility, ordering ability, etc.Tetrakis(terthienylsilane) (1) was used as the donor in the very first prototype of molecular BHJ solar cells in 2006 but demonstrated only modest efficiency due to absorption in the short-wavelength range, whose overlap with the solar light spectrum is quite narrow. In this work the synthesis of longer systems of this family is reported for the first time, and results indicate that the lengthening of the oligothiophene branches leads to a significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency. The suggested strategy of synthesis based on the replacement of the trimethylsilyl end group by bromine is of particular interest for the preparation of novel 3D light-harvesting systems with longer conjugated chains.
