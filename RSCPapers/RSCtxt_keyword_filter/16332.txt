    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 20th December 2017AbstractTrivalent bismuth compounds featuring octahedral halide coordination, such as BiI3, double-perovskite structures and vacancy-ordered perovskite derivatives, have recently attracted considerable attention as potential environmentally benign thin film materials for solar light-harvesting and optoelectronic applications aiming to replace toxic lead-based perovskites. Yet, their photovoltaic performance still lags considerably behind their lead-counterparts. Improving their performance requires a detailed knowledge of the photoinduced carrier dynamics and kinetics in these systems. In the current study, we present a detailed investigation of layered BiI3. The compound exhibits pronounced exciton dynamics which is associated with a characteristic second-derivative type feature in the transient absorption spectra. Accurate time constants are assigned to carrier cooling and recombination processes. Pronounced coherent oscillations are observed in the kinetic traces indicating strong electron–phonon coupling. Analysis of the coherences recovers the steady-state Raman spectrum of BiI3 with a dominant mode of Ag symmetry at 114 cm−1, associated with the zone center C(Γ) phonon. The line position is well reproduced by DFT calculations. In terms of the carrier lifetime, high absorption coefficient and band-gap position, BiI3 is a promising candidate as a photovoltaic material but challenges posed are the difficulty to split the strongly bound excitons which are confined in the 2D layers and the efficient extraction of electrons and holes at n- and p-selective contacts, beside well-known issues regarding high resistivity and the intrinsic softness of this material.
1. Introduction
Lead-based halide perovskite materials derived from methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPI) have reached high photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies above 22.1% in lab specimens.1–3 However, the inherent toxicity of the water-soluble lead salts and long-term stability issues still hang like the sword of Damocles over their wide-spread application in photovoltaic (PV) and optoelectronic devices, together with ever-decreasing prices for the well-established and further maturing silicon-based PV technologies.4
Therefore, halide compounds based on bismuth(III), which has the same 6s26p0 electron configuration as divalent lead,5 have recently come into focus as potential lead-perovskite replacements. While their toxicity is much lower6,7 and their stability higher,8,9 their efficiencies in PV devices currently still trail the performance of lead-based systems.5,10,11 For instance, PV devices employing BiI3 and mixtures of BiI3 with AgI have reached up to 2% power conversion efficiency (PCE).12,13 Related vacancy-ordered bismuth perovskite derivatives, such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, and bismuth double-perovskites, such as Cs2AgBiBr6, currently reach PCE values up to 1.6,14 and 2.5%,15 respectively. Additional efforts are directed toward the exfoliation of monolayers of BiI3 for potential optoelectronic applications as a 2D material.16–18 Optimisation of the thin film morphology of the bismuth compounds as well as the type of n- and p-selective contacts will likely lead to substantial future improvements. In this respect, time-resolved optical studies of the ultrafast charge carrier kinetics and dynamics are highly valuable for identifying performance bottlenecks in such lead-free semiconductor materials with potential applications in real-world PV systems.
The crystal structure and energy level diagram of BiI3 are presented in Fig. 1. As shown in panel (A), BiI3 is a layered material and belongs to the space group R (no. 148).19,20 In this layered 2D structure, the iodide anions form an almost hexagonally close packed lattice, whereas the bismuth cations occupy two third of the octahedral voids in every second layer. The VB maximum of BiI3 is located between −6.0 and −6.3 eV with respect to the vacuum level.13 It features an indirect band gap of ca. 1.67 eV with a weak absorption coefficient (α ≈ 100 cm−1)21,22 and a direct gap of 1.96 eV, reaching large absorption coefficients of more than 105 cm−1 above 2 eV.21,23 Optical excitation of BiI3 at 400 nm produces a carrier population with an initial excess energy of 1.4 eV above the CB edge. The CB of BiI3 lies about 0.3 eV below the CB of TiO2, which is used as a mesoporous (mp) scaffold in the current study, see panel (B). Electron injection into the CB of mp-TiO2 is therefore not favoured and was also not observed in the current study.

The latter one was used as scaffold material. The energy of the optical pump pulse (λpump = 400 nm, corresponding to 3.10 eV) is indicated as a blue arrow. 
In this contribution we represent the first UV-Vis broadband transient absorption experiments of BiI3, and here we specifically deal with the carrier dynamics in this layered compound, with a focus on the importance of excitonic and phonon interactions in these systems. The results will be also compared with our previous data for vacancy-ordered lead-free perovskites, such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9.24,25
2. Experimental
2.1 Thin film preparation
Sintered thin films of TiO2 with a thickness of ca. 500 nm were prepared as mesoporous scaffold materials on thoroughly cleaned glass slides as described previously.24,26–30 A 12.5 wt% solution of bismuth triiodide (ChemPUR, 99.999%) in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, Acros Organics, 99.8%, Extra Dry) was applied upon spinning the mp-TiO2/glass substrate (25 × 25 mm2) at 500 rpm for 4 s. Afterwards the rotation speed was increased to 3000 rpm for 30 s. The resulting film was heated to 80 °C for 30 min. All steps were carried out under dry nitrogen in a glove box (relative humidity < 2%).
2.2 Pump–supercontinuum probe (PSCP) spectroscopy
Broadband transient absorption spectra at 920 Hz repetition frequency were collected using the PSCP method31 on our UV-Vis setup covering the wavelength range 260–670 nm.24,26,32–34 Total absorption of TiO2 and BiI3 at short wavelengths limited the UV spectral range in this study to 350 nm. Pump pulses (400 nm, chopped at 460 Hz) and probe pulses were polarised at magic angle (54.7°) and focused into a nitrogen-flushed contact cell29 accommodating the BiI3/TiO2 thin film substrate. It was mounted on an x/y piezo stage and constantly translated within a 2 × 2 mm2 plane perpendicular to the propagation axis of the supercontinuum probe beam. The cross-correlation was typically ca. 80 fs, and the determination of zero time delay was accurate within ca. 20 fs. Single-shot baseline corrections were applied. Transient spectra at a certain delay time represent averages of 3000 pump–probe cycles.
2.3 Calculation of band structures and Raman spectra
DFT calculations for BiI3 were performed using norm-conserving pseudopotentials within the local density approximation (LDA) Perdew–Zunger functional as implemented in “Quantum Espresso”.35 Valence electrons were bismuth 6s26p3 and iodine 5s25p5. A plane-wave cut-off energy of 60 Rydberg (820 eV) and a 5 × 5 × 3 k-grid for hexagonal unit cells and a 7 × 7 × 7 k-grid for rhombohedral unit cells were employed. The atomic positions and unit cell parameters were taken from the literature.19 Conversion between the hexagonal cell and the primitive rhombohedral one was performed using CCTBX.36 Atomic positions and lattice parameters were optimised to minimise the forces to less than 10−3 Rydberg Bohr−1. Nonresonant Raman coefficients were calculated using “PHonon”,37 and graphical representations of the Raman modes were drawn with XCrySDen.38 The crystal structure of BiI3 was visualised using “VESTA 3”.39
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Transient absorption monitors carrier dynamics in BiI3

Fig. 2 shows broadband transient PSCP absorption spectra of BiI3 upon excitation with a pump pulse at 400 nm. Around t = 0 (top panel), we observe the build-up of a bleach feature below 530 nm and an oscillatory structure above. The latter one resembles the shape of the second derivative (magenta dotted line) of the steady-state absorption spectrum (violet dotted line). The minimum of this oscillatory feature is located at about 2.0 eV which corresponds to the position of the direct band edge.21 As will be discussed later on the shape of this band-edge feature strongly suggests contributions of excitons to the dynamics. This is also in agreement with findings for vacancy-ordered perovskite derivatives, such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9.24,25
 Fig. 2  Broadband PSCP transient absorption spectra of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 at different time slices of interest. In the top and bottom panels, the violet dotted lines represent the inverted steady state-absorption spectrum, whereas the magenta dotted lines correspond to the second derivative of the steady-state absorption spectrum, respectively. 
The second panel of Fig. 2 covers the time scale up to one picosecond. We observe a blue-shift of the second-derivative-type feature. The blue-shift might be at least partially related to the specific band structure of BiI3, with relatively far-spaced indirect and direct band gaps at 1.67 and 1.96 eV, respectively: after photoexcitation electrons will relax into the very flat region around the CB minimum located at ca. 0.5, whereas holes will gather at the VB maximum at about 0.7.21 Bleach contributions will therefore arise from two separate regions of the band structure, which is different from the situation in direct-band-gap semiconductors, such as GaAs.
We also observe a decay of the second-derivative-type feature, but no spectral decay in the bleach region below 450 nm. Therefore the dynamics is not associated with carrier recombination, but must be due to hot carrier relaxation. The dominant kinetic component found in the global analysis (Section 3.3) is τ1 = 0.52 ps which is compatible with the time scale of carrier–optical phonon scattering.26,27,40 Ultrafast carrier–carrier scattering in the 100 fs regime is likely present, but more difficult to resolve in the present case because of pronounced superimposed oscillations in the transient spectra as will be discussed separately in Section 3.2.
The third panel highlights the dynamics at intermediate times. Up to ten picoseconds (green spectrum) the band-edge feature shifts further to the blue, and the bleach region shows a small decay. Therefore the dynamics involves predominantly slow carrier–optical phonon scattering processes and the beginning decay of optical into acoustic phonons,26,27,40 and also some electron–hole recombination. The global analysis provides a time constant of τ2 = 3.6 ps for these processes. The shift becomes much weaker but still persists up to about 100 ps (red spectrum), yet in this time regime we find further indications for a decay in the bleach band below 470 nm.
The decay of the bleach (now without shifting of the band-edge feature) becomes very clear at times beyond 200 ps (bottom panel). Because most of the cooling processes have already ceased by that time, we assign this uniform decay of the whole spectrum to electron–hole recombination. The decay can be well described by the two time constants τ3 = 260 ps and another very slow component which we can only roughly estimate as τ4 > 5 ns (beyond the time window of our PSCP experiment).
We note that we did not observe any electron injection into mesoporous TiO2. This was confirmed by recording additional broadband transient absorption spectra (not shown here) on a separate PSCP setup28,41 monitoring the response in the near infrared range (900–1600 nm). No transient absorption, which would be expected after injection of electrons into the CB of TiO2,24,25,42 was observed for BiI3 on mesoporous TiO2.
3.2 Early-time dynamics reveals coherent phonons in BiI3
Strong oscillations are observed in the kinetic transients at least up to 5 ps. They are visible over a wide range of the spectrum and are nicely seen in the contour plot as well as in the selected eight traces in the spectral range 474–665 nm (Fig. 3). Over time the features slightly shift to shorter wavelengths, corresponding to the aforementioned blue-shift of the second-derivative-like band edge feature, and decay due to dephasing processes.
 Fig. 3  Contour plot for the transient absorption spectra of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 including eight kinetic transients covering the wavelength range 474–665 nm. For each kinetic trace, the best fit (black line) consists of a biexponential decay (green and red lines), a step-function (cyan line) and a damped cosine function (violet line), all convolved with a Gaussian instrument response function. Pump wavelength: 400 nm. 
The oscillations suggest coherent motion of optical phonons coupled to the electronic transition which results in a periodic modulation of the measured transmission and/or reflectance.43 The coherence is most likely induced by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS).44 Considerable excitonic contributions to the dynamics are expected for BiI3: the estimated exciton binding energy is in the range 160–180 meV23 and therefore larger than the available thermal energy of ca. 26 meV at 300 K. This results in an estimated exciton Bohr radius of ca. 6 Å, which is similar to the thickness of a 2D layer of this material. This exciton binding energy is larger than for lead-perovskites, where values in the range 5–10 meV at room temperature are proposed,45–49 and the layered 2H polytype of PbI2, where estimates in the range 60–7050,51 and 100–130 meV52 were reported. However it is smaller than in (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, where a value of ca. 300 meV was estimated.53 For PbI2, (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and also (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 we previously observed clear excitonic signatures in their transient absorption spectra at room temperature.24–26
The regular oscillation pattern in the kinetics of BiI3 means that predominantly one particular phonon mode contributes to the signal. This is different from our previous study of the vacancy-ordered perovskite (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 where contributions of several stronger modes resulted in a more complex oscillatory beat pattern.25
For describing the short-time kinetic traces of BiI3 we employed a fit function containing a step-function, two exponential decay functions with the time constants τe1 and τe2, respectively, and a damped cosine term with a damping time constant τd and a wavelength-independent phase-shift. The experimental time resolution was included by convolving this total fit function with a Gaussian instrument response function.
The best fit leads already to a very good description of all experimental kinetic traces (see Fig. 3). The prominent oscillation corresponds to  = 114 cm−1 with the damping time constant τd = 1.1 ps. Decoherence therefore takes considerably longer than in the previously studied (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 system (τd ≈ 0.6 ps). The 114 cm−1 oscillation observed for the BiI3 thin film is consistent with the intense zone center C(Γ) LO phonon mode of Ag symmetry at 113.3 cm−1 observed in steady-state Raman spectra of BiI3 crystals.54 The time constants τe1 = 0.16 ps and τe2 = 0.48 ps were found for the biexponential decay.
To investigate if any other phonon modes significantly contribute to the oscillation, the data were also analysed in the following way: in the first step, the experimental oscillatory contribution was extracted by subtracting the two exponential decays and the step function from the experimental spectrum. In the second step zero-padding of the time traces up to three times their original length was performed. Afterwards the padded traces were multiplied with an exponentially decaying apodisation function. Then a Fourier transformation was performed to obtain the frequency magnitude from the modified experimental time traces, which was finally averaged over certain wavelength ranges (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Contour plot highlighting the vibrational contributions (in cm−1) to the coherent oscillations of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 including five spectral cuts providing vibrational spectra averaged over the wavelength intervals indicated. The bottom panel shows Raman stick spectra for BiI3 obtained from our DFT calculations (magenta) and experimental data from ref. 54 (black), the latter scaled to the relative intensities reported in ref. 55. Note the reciprocal wavelength scale employed in the contour plot which is equivalent to an energy representation. 
The vibrational spectra obtained from this procedure agree well with the experimentally determined Raman spectrum of Kaifu and co-workers.54 The latter one is presented as a black stick spectrum in the bottom panel, with the intensities scaled to the ambient pressure Raman spectrum provided by Saitoh et al.55 The spectrum is dominated by a single very strong and broadened line at 114 cm−1, which was also identified by fitting the time-domain data in Fig. 3. It is assigned to the aforementioned zone center C(Γ) LO phonon mode of Ag symmetry. Its tail toward lower frequencies contains the weaker Eg d(Γ) mode found at 95.0 cm−1 in the steady-state Raman spectra.54,55 Above 600 nm more substantial low-frequency activity is seen, particularly in the wavelength range 637–696 nm. The weak absorption in the 50–60 cm−1 range likely arises from the Ag B(Γ) and D(Γ) modes at 58.5 and 53.5 cm−1, respectively.54,55 At even lower frequencies, the Ag c(Γ), b(Γ) and A(Γ) modes at 36.7, 33.5 and 22.8 cm−1 as well as the Eg a(Γ) rigid layer mode at 12.9 cm−1 is located, with the A(Γ) being the relatively most intense. All these modes are responsible for the broad “bump” in our experimental spectrum below 40 cm−1.54,55

Fig. 4 also shows that the most prominent contributions to the 114 cm−1 phonon mode stem from the wavelength range 620–650 nm and from the range 480–570 nm, separated by very weak activity in the range 580–610 nm (Fig. 2). A striking result is that low-frequency Raman activity is mainly found in the wavelength region above 620 nm where the red edge of the broadened exciton peak of BiI3 is located. This suggests a relatively stronger Raman enhancement of the low-frequency modes in the region of the excitonic resonance. In contrast at wavelengths below 570 nm low-frequency Raman activity is almost absent. Resonance effects in steady-state low-temperature Raman spectra of BiI3 were reported previously by Shen and co-workers.56 Strong enhancements of Raman bands are found in cases where the incident wavelength (in our case the respective portion of the broadband supercontinuum probe light) and the wavelength of the scattered photon are resonant with excitonic levels, as it is certainly the case above 620 nm. We note that we previously saw similar wavelength-dependent changes of Raman intensities for the metal-deficient perovskite (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9.25
We also compared the experimentally determined Raman spectrum with our calculated spectrum from DFT calculations. Band diagrams are provided in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†), and structural parameters are summarised in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculations for the experimental structure of BiI3 predict an indirect band-gap of 2.25 eV which overestimates the experimental band-gap by ca. 0.6 eV. This difference is well understood because of the neglect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in the calculations.17,21 On the other hand, although inclusion of SOC brings the calculated indirect band-gap much closer to the experimental value (1.55 vs. 1.67 eV),21 at the same time the direct band-gap is not well described by SOC calculations either (1.61 vs. 1.96 eV).21 We therefore employed less expensive calculations without SOC for determining the phonon frequencies.
The results of phonon calculations at the Γ point for the rhombohedral unit cell are included as a magenta-colored stick spectrum in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. A summary of the phonon frequencies and a comparison with other data are included in the ESI† (Table S2). There are twelve Raman-active modes for the space group R (no. 148), four non-degenerate Ag and four doubly degenerate Eg modes.54 The strongest experimental Raman mode with Ag symmetry is well reproduced by the calculations and slightly underestimates the experimental Raman frequency of BiI3 crystals (110.4 vs. 113.3 cm−1).54 The structure of BiI3 and the associated displacement vectors for this strongest phonon mode are depicted in Fig. 5. It involves concerted motions of the iodine atoms, which results in a substantial change in polarisability. We note that in particular the frequencies of the Eg modes are overestimated substantially (Table S2, ESI†). Inclusion of SOC would improve this agreement,17 however at the same time worsen the description especially for the dominant Ag mode.17

3.3 Global kinetic analysis dissects carrier relaxation in BiI3
The transient absorption spectra of BiI3 were subjected to a global kinetic modelling procedure41,57–59 to extract accurate time constants for the carrier relaxation processes. The preliminary analysis in Section 3.1 broadly classified four time regimes of carrier relaxation processes. Consequently we described the dynamics by a consecutive model involving five “species” Si, i.e. S1 → S2 → S3 → S4 → S0 with the corresponding time constants τ1–τ4. As will be shown below, the individual time constants are very different and increase systematically from τ1 to τ4. Therefore a consecutive model is adequate. Species S1–S4 characterise the non-equilibrium BiI3 absorption spectra at different stages of relaxation, with S1 being the “species” prepared by photoexcitation at 400 nm. S0 corresponds to the steady-state absorption spectrum of BiI3 at the temperature of our experiments (T = 296 K). The species-associated spectra (SAS) were parametrised by a sum of Gaussian functions. The final optimised spectra and time constants are provided in Fig. 6. Representative kinetics at two wavelengths on short and long time scales are shown in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively.
 Fig. 6  Absorption spectra of BiI3 at different stages of carrier relaxation after photoexcitation at 400 nm near the band edge. The transient species correspond to S1, S2, S3 and S4 in the kinetic model, with the associated time constants τ1–τ4. S0 is the steady-state absorption of our BiI3 thin film at 296 K (violet line). The inset contains an overview spectrum showing that the most pronounced dynamics occurs near the band gap, whereas spectral changes at high excess energies above the band gap are weaker. 
 Fig. 7  Kinetic fits for BiI3 carrier relaxation at 375 nm (left) and 669 nm (right) at short times up to 3 ps. The top panels show the contributions of the five “species” S4 (red), S3 (magenta), S2 (green), S1 (blue) and S0 (violet). The bottom panels depict the experimental data points together with the total fit. 
 Fig. 8  Kinetic fits for BiI3 carrier relaxation at 375 nm (left) and 669 nm (right) at longer times up to 900 ps. The top panels show the contributions of the five “species” S4 (red), S3 (magenta), S2 (green), S1 (blue) and S0 (violet). The bottom panels depict the experimental data points together with the total fit. 
The room-temperature spectrum (violet line) shows a broad exciton peak centred at about 610 nm. Toward shorter wavelengths the spectrum rises monotonously and is featureless. After photoexcitation the spectrum at early times (red line) features a broadened and strongly depleted exciton feature and an extended long-wavelength tail. In contrast, the above-band-gap absorption changes only slightly. This band shape is responsible for the second-derivative-like features in the transient absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 2. Fast disappearance of the exciton absorption has been observed previously in the low-temperature spectrum of GaAs in the presence of high densities of free carriers after photoexcitation or under continuous-wave illumination.60,61 We therefore ascribe this effect to Coulomb screening of the excitons by photoexcited carriers. At the same time, the absorption edge is red-shifted below the unperturbed energy of free excitons consistent with band-gap renormalisation arising from exchange and correlation effects between the carriers.60,62,63
The initially hot carrier distribution relaxes further toward the band edge with a time constant of τ1 = 0.52 ps resulting in the spectrum shown in Fig. 6 as a magenta line. Here the exciton peak has partially recovered and the band-gap-renormalisation feature has become considerably weaker. The time scale is typical for carrier–optical phonon scattering.26,27,40 We also note that the kinetic fits of the early-time oscillatory component in Fig. 3 provided, beside a very similar time constant of 0.48 ps, an additional fast time constant of 0.16 ps with much smaller amplitude. We believe that this is likely an indication of fast initial carrier–carrier scattering at very early times before relaxation mainly occurs via optical phonons.
The cooling process proceeds further as captured by the evolution of the magenta to the green spectrum (Fig. 6). We assign this to slower carrier–optical phonon scattering and the beginning decay of optical into acoustic phonons (heat transfer).26,27,40 The corresponding time constant is τ2 = 3.6 ps. The concomitant weak decay of the bleach feature in the transient absorption spectra suggests that electron–hole recombination already starts in this time range.
The further decay is well described by the time constant τ3 = 260 ps and another slow component which we can only crudely estimate as τ4 > 5 ns (beyond the time window of our PSCP experiment), resulting in the blue and violet spectra in Fig. 6, respectively. We assign the main part of this dynamics to electron–hole recombination which is probably overlaid by some acoustic phonon relaxation.26,40
Carrier recombination therefore appears to happen largely on longer time scales (τ3 = 260 ps, τ4 > 5 ns), with estimated amplitudes of 55% and 35%, respectively, and to much smaller extent on shorter time-scales (τ2 = 3.6 ps, 10%), where the latter is however overlaid by carrier cooling dynamics leading to a similar type of band evolution. The kinetics in Fig. 7 and 8 show these decays in the bleach (375 nm) and exciton bands (669 nm) together with the respective “species” contributions.
The lifetimes from our global analysis may be compared with previous photoluminescence (PL) data of Brandt et al.,22 who fitted their sample-dependent PL decays by mono- or biexponential kinetics. We determined the “average carrier lifetime”  from the corresponding fitted time constants τi and amplitudes Ai as64 (1)and the “amplitude-weighted lifetime” 〈τ〉 as:64 (2)The data of Brandt et al. provide  (〈τ〉) values in the range 0.58–1.31 ns (0.55–0.86 ns), whereas we obtain a larger value of about 4.6 ns (1.9 ns). Therefore with respect to its carrier lifetime BiI3 should be a quite promising PV material, as only thin layers of this highly absorbing material are required for efficient light-harvesting.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have presented the first comprehensive UV-Vis ultrafast broadband transient absorption study of BiI3, a material with potential applications in photovoltaics. The experiments provided several important findings regarding the charge carrier kinetics and dynamics of this compound. The relaxation of the photoexcited carriers was monitored and provided time constants of 0.52 and 3.6 ps for carrier–optical phonon scattering and beginning acoustic phonon relaxation. Pronounced oscillations in the kinetics were observed over a very wide spectral range. They were probably initiated by an impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) process. This demonstrated the presence of strong electron–phonon coupling in this material. A detailed analysis of the oscillations in the kinetic traces recovered the complete Raman spectrum of BiI3, with a dominant phonon mode at 114 cm−1. Such strong electron–phonon coupling was also observed by us very recently in transient absorption spectra of so-called vacancy-ordered metal-deficient perovskites, such as (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9.24,25 It appears to be a hallmark of halide compounds involving the Group 15 elements bismuth and antimony, regardless of the detailed crystallographic structure of the material. These strong carrier–lattice interactions, possibly inducing nonradiative recombination, might be one limiting factor for increasing the carrier lifetime in such materials, even after improvement of the electronic properties by further purification or intentional doping.
Previous studies of carrier recombination in BiI3 have relied on relatively low-time-resolution photoluminescence techniques.22,65 Our current transient absorption data with about 80 fs time resolution suggest slower carrier recombination than reported in the previous experiments, with components of 260 ps (partly superimposed by acoustic phonon relaxation) and more than 5 nanoseconds. With respect to PV applications the carrier dynamics of BiI3 has been previously discussed in terms of free-carrier dynamics with an emphasis on the disparity in electron and hole mobilities, due to the six times smaller electron effective mass.17,66 The clearly visible peak close to the direct band edge in the steady-state absorption spectrum at 296 K and the second-derivative like transient absorption features in our time-resolved data strongly suggest a large contribution of exciton dynamics, consistent with previously published exciton binding energies of 160–180 meV for this material.23 Large lateral exciton diffusion coefficients and propagation velocities were measured in single crystals at low temperatures and assigned to efficient ballistic exciton transport along the 2D layer planes of BiI3.67–69 Another future task will therefore be the efficient separation of these mobile excitons using optimised thin film architectures and appropriate electron- and hole-selective contacts. These issues need to be addressed together with previously highlighted points, such as the high resistivity (and thus insufficient fill factor) and the softness (due to the layered structure) of this material,22 to turn BiI3 into a promising material for photovoltaic applications.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) Crystal structure of BiI3 (space group R, no. 148) with the c-axis (blue) pointing along the x-direction. (B) Diagram of the energy levels of BiI3 and mesoporous TiO2. The latter one was used as scaffold material. The energy of the optical pump pulse (λpump = 400 nm, corresponding to 3.10 eV) is indicated as a blue arrow.	 

 	Fig. 2  Broadband PSCP transient absorption spectra of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 at different time slices of interest. In the top and bottom panels, the violet dotted lines represent the inverted steady state-absorption spectrum, whereas the magenta dotted lines correspond to the second derivative of the steady-state absorption spectrum, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Contour plot for the transient absorption spectra of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 including eight kinetic transients covering the wavelength range 474–665 nm. For each kinetic trace, the best fit (black line) consists of a biexponential decay (green and red lines), a step-function (cyan line) and a damped cosine function (violet line), all convolved with a Gaussian instrument response function. Pump wavelength: 400 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  Contour plot highlighting the vibrational contributions (in cm−1) to the coherent oscillations of BiI3 on mp-TiO2 including five spectral cuts providing vibrational spectra averaged over the wavelength intervals indicated. The bottom panel shows Raman stick spectra for BiI3 obtained from our DFT calculations (magenta) and experimental data from ref. 54 (black), the latter scaled to the relative intensities reported in ref. 55. Note the reciprocal wavelength scale employed in the contour plot which is equivalent to an energy representation.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated layer structure of BiI3 (blue: bismuth, violet: iodine) with displacement vectors (light green) indicating iodine movement for the most intense Raman-active phonon mode at 110.4 cm−1 having Ag symmetry.	 

 	Fig. 6  Absorption spectra of BiI3 at different stages of carrier relaxation after photoexcitation at 400 nm near the band edge. The transient species correspond to S1, S2, S3 and S4 in the kinetic model, with the associated time constants τ1–τ4. S0 is the steady-state absorption of our BiI3 thin film at 296 K (violet line). The inset contains an overview spectrum showing that the most pronounced dynamics occurs near the band gap, whereas spectral changes at high excess energies above the band gap are weaker.	 

 	Fig. 7  Kinetic fits for BiI3 carrier relaxation at 375 nm (left) and 669 nm (right) at short times up to 3 ps. The top panels show the contributions of the five “species” S4 (red), S3 (magenta), S2 (green), S1 (blue) and S0 (violet). The bottom panels depict the experimental data points together with the total fit.	 

 	Fig. 8  Kinetic fits for BiI3 carrier relaxation at 375 nm (left) and 669 nm (right) at longer times up to 900 ps. The top panels show the contributions of the five “species” S4 (red), S3 (magenta), S2 (green), S1 (blue) and S0 (violet). The bottom panels depict the experimental data points together with the total fit.
