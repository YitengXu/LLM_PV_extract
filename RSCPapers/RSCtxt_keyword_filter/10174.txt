    , Accepted 8th October 2021First published on 12th October 2021AbstractThe low-cost material antimony trifluoride (SbF3) was doped into commonly used tin dioxide (SnO2) for the first time, and the SbF3-doped SnO2 as an electron-transport layer (ETL) was successfully applied in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After the SbF3 doping, the optimized photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) was significantly enhanced from 19.89% to 21.42%. The effects of SbF3 on the device performance were then systematically investigated. The results show that the electron mobility of the ETL is markedly increased and the quality of the ETL/perovskite interface is effectively improved, which is helpful to promote the electron-transport efficiency in the ETL as well as the electron-extraction ability from the perovskite to the ETL. Besides, the perovskite grain size is clearly increased and the trap state density in the bulk perovskite is significantly decreased, both of which can greatly suppress charge-carrier recombination in the perovskite film. Moreover, the device based on the SbF3-doped SnO2 ETL displays negligible hysteresis and excellent stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted substantial attention by virtue of their energy-harvesting applications, and the power convention efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has soared from 3.8% to over 25% in the past few years.1–5 Such a jump in progress for the PCE can be attributed to the outstanding perovskite properties (including an adjustable band gap, high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length,6–8etc.), and clever device structure designs (such as composition regulation,9–11 interface modification12–14 and tandem engineering15,16). For modification of the interface in PSCs, two metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2 and SnO2) as electron-transport layers have been most reported in the literature and have proved highly effective, especially for high-efficiency n–i–p-type PSCs.17–20 However, the early reported mesoporous TiO2 electron-transport layer (ETL) required a high-temperature annealing process of over 450 °C,20 which is not conducive to large-scale manufacturing processes. Thereby the low-temperature-processed (about 125 °C) compact TiO2 ETL was developed and applied in PSCs recently.21 Nevertheless, compact TiO2 also has many shortcomings, such as a low carrier mobility, a high surface trap state density and mismatched energy-level alignment with the perovskite, and all of these disadvantages ultimately lead to a large device hysteresis.22–24 What is worse, compact TiO2 generally accelerates the cell photodegradation by acting as a strong catalytic effect initiator under ultraviolet (UV) light illumination and therefore dramatically decreases the lifetime of the device.25 In comparison, the SnO2 ETL possesses a higher electron mobility, better transmittance in the visible region, more suitable energy-level alignment with the perovskite, increased UV light stability, as well as being compatible with low-temperature processing (about 150 °C).17,18,26,27 Nowadays, the certificated record efficiency of PSCs has been achieved by devices that use a SnO2 ETL.3
Although SnO2 has been proved to be excellent for PSCs, it has a drawback: the surface of SnO2 contains oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups,28 which could eventually generate trap states near the valence band of SnO2 and lead to non-radiative recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface.29–32 Therefore, devices based on pure SnO2 still have non-ignorable hysteresis, and their performance can actually be further improved. Fortunately, more and more researchers have discovered that modifying or doping the SnO2 ETL can effectively reduce the defect density, increase the electron mobility, adjust the surface energy-level, diminish undesirable hysteresis, and hence improve the device performance.23–25 For example, Ke and co-workers found that a very thin PCBM layer inserted into the SnO2/perovskite interface could efficiently passivate SnO2 surface trap sites and suppress interfacial charge-carrier recombination.33 Jung and co-workers reported that the use of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) for SnO2 surface treatment could not only reduce the surface defects of SnO2 films, but also adjust the Fermi level of SnO2, making it more compatible with the energy level of perovskite.28 Zhang and co-workers showed that graphdiyne-incorporated SnO2 could greatly improve the electron mobility of SnO2 by forming C–O σ bonds.6 In addition, our research group have also recently discovered that both 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)-incorporated SnO2 and rubidium fluoride (RbF)-modified SnO2 could respectively promote the PCE of PSCs together with clearly suppressing the device hysteresis.34,35 All of the above studies demonstrate that there is considerable room to effectively improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by modifying or doping the SnO2 ETL.
In this work, we introduced the cheap inorganic compound antimony trifluoride (SbF3) into the SnO2 colloidal dispersion (marked by SnO2–SbF3) for the first time to study the impacts of SbF3 addition on the photovoltaic characteristics of PSCs. It is found that the introduction of SbF3 can successfully increase the electron mobility in the ETL, enlarge the grain size in the perovskite film and improve the quality at the ETL/perovskite interface. By carefully optimizing the SbF3 content ratio to the amount of SnO2, an outstanding PCE of 21.42% was achieved, much higher than the efficiency of the pure SnO2-based device (19.89% PCE). Moreover, the device with SnO2–SbF3 ETL exhibits excellent stability and negligible hysteresis.
Results and discussion
In order to investigate the different properties of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films, SnO2 precursor solutions without/with SbF3 were respectively spin-coated onto ITO substrates, and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 minutes (the detailed experimental process is described in the ESI†). Fig. 1a–c shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films. In comparison with the SnO2 film, the additional peaks for the SnO2–SbF3 film at ∼685.1 eV and ∼540.6 eV are assigned to F 1s and Sb 3d3/2 (Fig. 1a and b), respectively,34,36 which demonstrate that SbF3 has been successfully doped into the SnO2 film. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the SnO2–SbF3 film surface (Fig. S1a–d, ESI†) also reveals the presence of F and Sb, confirming that SbF3 was indeed added to the SnO2 film. Fig. 1c shows that the Sn 3d peak for the SnO2–SbF3 film is downshifted by about 1.0 eV toward a lower binding energy, in contrast to that of the SnO2 film, and this behavior could originate from F–Sn bond formation that is induced by the strong interaction between F and Sn in the SnO2–SbF3 film.28,37 The optical transmittance spectra of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films on the ITO substrate are shown in Fig. 1d. It is seen that both of the films display good transparency in the range of 300–900 nm, and the transmittance of the SnO2–SbF3 film almost remains unchanged compared with that of the SnO2 film, which indicates that the addition of SbF3 has little change on the optical transmittance properties of the pristine SnO2 film.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to explore surface morphology of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films. As shown in Fig. S1e–h, both films exhibit a smooth surface. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the SnO2 film is 1.66 nm, and that of the SnO2–SbF3 film is 2.72 nm. The small increased surface roughness for the SnO2–SbF3 film might be related to the introduction of F and Sb atoms that could change the binding energy of the Sn atoms in the pristine SnO2 film.28 Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was also employed to study the energy levels of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films. Details of the results and corresponding calculations are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). It can be seen from Fig. S3 (ESI†) that the addition of SbF3 has little effect on the energy level and work function of the pristine SnO2 film.
To further investigate the electrical properties of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films. The electron mobility of the two films was determined using the space charge finite current (SCLC) model with the ITO/Al/ETL/Al structure (ETL is either the SnO2 film or the SnO2–SbF3 film). Details of the calculation methods and parameters are shown in Fig. 2a and Table S1 (ESI†). The results demonstrate that the SnO2–SbF3 film exhibits a higher electron mobility (4.35 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1) than that of the SnO2 film (2.38 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1). In addition, the structure composed of ITO/ETL/Au was also fabricated to study the conductivity of the two films (Fig. 2b and Table S2, ESI†). The conductivity of the SnO2–SbF3 film is 5.19 × 10−3 mS cm−1, which is higher than that of the SnO2 film (3.80 × 10−3 mS cm−1). Both the electron mobility and the conductivity of the ETL are clearly enhanced after SbF3 doping, indicating the more effective charge transport in the SnO2–SbF3 film, which can significantly prevent charge accumulation in the ETL or at the ETL/perovskite interface and so increase the Jsc in PSCs.

To explore impacts of the ETL on the perovskite film, we then deposited the Cs0.04FA0.74MA0.22PbIxBryCl3−x−y perovskite film using a two-step method onto the SnO2 or SnO2–SbF3 ETL (details of the fabrication process are described in the ESI†). Fig. 2c compares the absorption spectra of the two perovskite films, and the results show that the films have similar light absorption abilities. Fig. 2d presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. It can be clearly seen that the positions of the characteristic diffraction peaks for the two perovskite films are almost the same, but that the peak intensities are different. The diffraction peak at 12.62° is assigned to PbI2, and that at 14.05° corresponds to the main perovskite.34 Notice that after doping SbF3 into SnO2, the intensity of the lead iodide peak (PbI2) is significantly suppressed, while the intensity of the main perovskite peak is distinctly enhanced. These studies confirm that the addition of SbF3 can effectively diminish the PbI2 residue in the perovskite layer as well as helpfully improving the perovskite film crystallization (moderate unreacted PbI2 is commonly believed to be beneficial to the efficiency of PCEs, since it can passivate the defects in perovskite grain boundaries,38 whereas excess unreacted PbI2 will result in an intrinsic instability of the perovskite film under illumination, even when stored in an inert atmosphere39). Moreover, the XRD patterns based on different SbF3 amounts are exhibited in Fig. S4 (ESI†). With an increase in the SbF3 doping concentration, the ratio of the perovskite peak intensity to the PbI2 peak intensity clearly increases, and the intensity ratio reaches a maximum when the SbF3 concentration is 0.4 mg mL−1. In order to further verify the difference in perovskite crystal growth on the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used. As is shown in Fig. 3a and b, both perovskite samples display continuous pinhole-free films and the films cover the surface fully, while the perovskite grain size on SnO2–SbF3 is clearly larger than that on SnO2, which is consistent with the stronger main peak intensity of the perovskite on SnO2–SbF3 shown in the XRD pattern (Fig. 2d). In short, a larger grain size and better crystallization of the perovskite layer on SnO2–SbF3 are very important for higher-performance PSCs.

The AFM morphology of the perovskite film on the SnO2 or SnO2–SbF3 ETL was also tested. From the comparison in Fig. 3c and d, we find that a larger perovskite grain size can be obtained by doping with SbF3, and this result is in accordance with our above analysis from the XRD patterns (Fig. 2d) and SEM images (Fig. 3a and b). The RMS of the SnO2-based perovskite film is 30.1 nm, and that of the SnO2–SbF3-based perovskite film is 33.5 nm. The phenomenon of the slight RMS increase might be caused by the slightly larger roughness of the SnO2–SbF3 film that is under the perovskite layer (Fig. S1e–h, ESI†).
To deeply explore the charge-carrier dynamics in the perovskite film based on the SnO2 or SnO2–SbF3 ETL, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained. Fig. 4a displays the PL spectra at the excitation wavelength of 485 nm. Compared with the perovskite film on the SnO2 ETL, the film on the SnO2–SbF3 ETL shows stronger PL quenching, indicating more efficient electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2–SbF3. Besides, the PL peak of the perovskite film on the SnO2–SbF3 ETL shifts to a lower wavelength by about 1.5 nm, which suggests fewer defects in the bulk perovskite.34Fig. 4b shows the TRPL spectra fitted by a bi-exponential decay function. From the complex TRPL spectra, two characteristic times can be extracted: the fast decay (τ1) and the slow decay (τ2) times.40τ1 is due to the carrier quenching at the ETL/perovskite interface, and τ2 is related to the carrier radiative recombination by defects in the bulk perovskite. As is shown Table S3 (ESI†), the calculated τ1 (= 67.04 ns) and τ2 (= 233.54 ns) values for the SnO2–SbF3/perovskite film are shorter than those for the SnO2/perovskite film (τ1 = 77.21 ns, τ2 = 276.32 ns). The smaller τ1 (and τ2) for the SnO2–SbF3/perovskite film indicate the improved quality at the ETL/perovskite interface (and decreased trap states in the bulk perovskite). This is in agreement with the PL results.

To quantitatively investigate the trap-state density of the perovskite film based on the SnO2 ETL or the SnO2–SbF3 ETL, devices with the structure of ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated.41Fig. 4c shows the corresponding dark I–V curves. The trap density (Nt) can be determined from the curves via the following relationship:42  where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, and L is the perovskite film thickness. The calculated Nt value of the perovskite film on the SnO2–SbF3 ETL is 3.91 × 1015 cm−3, which is much lower than that of the perovskite film on the SnO2 ETL (5.65 × 1015 cm−3) (Table S4, ESI†). This result reveals that the method of SbF3 doping in the SnO2 ETL can actually reduce the defects in the perovskite film.
Subsequently, we fabricated PSCs with the structure of ITO/ETL (SnO2 or SnO2–SbF3)/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4d and Fig. S5 (ESI†) present the cross-sectional SEM images of the investigated devices. It can be clearly seen that the perovskite film on SnO2–SbF3 shows more compact crystallization and a larger grain size, which indicates that the SnO2–SbF3 film is more conducive to the growth of perovskite crystals compared with the SnO2 film. This result is consistent with the surface SEM images, as shown in Fig. 3a and b.

Fig. 5a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results measured in the dark to gain information about the carrier transfer and recombination in devices with an equivalent circuit model (the model diagram is shown in the inset of Fig. 5a, where Rtr is the charge-transfer resistance and Rrec is the recombination resistance).36 The extracted Rtr and Rrec values are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). As is shown in Fig. 5a, the larger Rrec acquired from the SnO2–SbF3 device signifies the reduction of charge-carrier recombination in the bulk perovskite, and its smaller Rtr also indicates the enhancement of electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETL. These EIS results are in good accordance with the PL, TRPL and trap-state density analyses.

The J–V curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device based on SnO2–SbF3 gives a PCE of 21.42%, with a Voc of 1.146 V, a Jsc of 24.24 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.10%. By contrast, the device based on SnO2 gives a PCE of 19.89%, with a Voc of 1.132 V, a Jsc of 23.42 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.03%. For the SnO2–SbF3 device, the higher Voc may be ascribed to the more appropriate energy level of the SnO2–SbF3 film as well as the lower carrier recombination at the SnO2–SbF3/perovskite interface; simultaneously, the larger Jsc and FF values are probably attributed to the increased conductivity of the ETL, the enhanced electron mobility in the ETL, the improved electron-extraction ability at the ETL/perovskite interface, together with the decreased trap defects in the bulk perovskite. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of the SnO2–SbF3 devices with different concentrations of SbF3 aqueous solution. It can be concluded from the J–V diagram that the device with the 0.4 mg mL−1 SbF3 doping concentration shows the best photovoltaic performance, which is in agreement with the XRD analysis (Fig. S4, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are depicted in Fig. 5c. The integrated currents from the EQE spectra are 22.83 mA cm−2 (for the SnO2 device) and 23.52 mA cm−2 (for the SnO2–SbF3 device), close to the Jsc value obtained from J–V measurements (Fig. 5b).

The hysteresis of the J–V curves was investigated under both reverse-scan and forward-scan directions (Fig. 5b and Table 1). It is worth noting that the device based on SnO2 shows obvious hysteresis while the device based on SnO2–SbF3 displays negligible hysteresis. We thus conclude that the hysteresis is greatly suppressed after SbF3 doping. We prepared more the 50 individual devices based on the SnO2 or SnO2–SbF3 film, and their PCE performance distribution is summarized in Fig. 5d. It is clear that the average PCE of the SnO2–SbF3 devices is indeed higher than that of the SnO2 devices. The long-term stability of the devices stored in a nitrogen glove box was also measured. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the change in PCE with increasing time. The study reveals that the SnO2 device maintains only 72% of its initial PCE, whereas the SnO2–SbF3 device retains over 85% of its initial PCE. The steady-state output of the devices at the maximum power point (MPP) was also tested. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the current outputs of the SnO2 and SnO2–SbF3 devices are stable at 21.56 mA cm−2 and 22.08 mA cm−2 at the MPP bias. The SnO2 device only retains 95.6% of its maximum efficiency after 300 s, while the SnO2–SbF3 device maintains 97.9% of its maximum PCE.
Conclusion
In summary, we find that the SbF3-incorporated SnO2 ETL has a positive effect on the performance of PSCs. Compared with the SnO2 ETL, the SnO2–SbF3 ETL shows an improved electron mobility, a higher electron conductivity and a more suitable energy level relative to perovskite. The SnO2–SbF3 ETL also improves the quality of the ETL/perovskite interface, thereby promoting the electron-extraction ability from the perovskite to the ETL. In addition, the SnO2–SbF3 ETL is more conducive to the growth of perovskite crystals with a decrease of the PbI2 residue and an increased perovskite grain size, which can significantly decrease trap defects in the perovskite film and hence efficiently suppress charge-carrier recombination in the bulk perovskite. As a result, the PSC based on the SnO2–SbF3 ETL displays an outstanding PCE of 21.42% with negligible hysteresis and excellent stability. By contrast, the device based on the pure SnO2 ETL shows a PCE of 19.89% with obvious hysteresis and poorer stability. This work demonstrates that the SnO2 ETL doped with SbF3 is a successful strategy for enhancing the device efficiency, and provides the new, cheap, effective modification material SbF3 for future PSCs.
