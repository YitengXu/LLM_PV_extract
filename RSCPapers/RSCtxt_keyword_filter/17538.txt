    , Accepted 4th October 2019First published on 4th October 2019AbstractInterface engineering is a critical factor in achieving high photovoltaic performances for large-area, printable, flexible and low cost organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we developed a solution-processable n-doped graphene cathode interfacial material (CIM) PDINO–G for OSCs by adding graphene to the classic material PDINO ((N,N-dimethyl-ammonium N-oxide)propyl perylene diimide). The dispersed graphene in PDINO–G was n-doped by the nitroxide radical of N-oxide in PDINO, which was certified by the ESR, Raman spectroscopy and XPS results. The n-doped PDINO–G CIM possessed increased conductivity, lower work function, reduced charge recombination and increased charge extraction rate. Previously, n-doped graphene was prepared only on the surface of chemical vapor-deposited (CVD) graphene films without solution processability. The effect of the CIM on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs was studied by selecting the photovoltaic model system of PTQ10 as the donor and IDIC-2F as the acceptor. The OSCs based on PTQ10:IDIC-2F with PDINO–G CIM demonstrated the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.01%, which was significantly enhanced in comparison with that of the devices without graphene modification on the PDINO CIM (12.23%). The universality of the high performance PDINO–G CIM was verified in two other photovoltaic systems based on PTQ10:IDIC and PM6:Y6. Especially, the single junction bulk heterojunction OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with PDINO–G CIM displayed a high PCE of 16.52% (average PCE of 16.3 ± 0.2%). The results indicate that the n-doped PDINO–G is an excellent CIM for OSCs. Furthermore, this PDINO-doped graphene can be applied in other optoelectronic devices such as tandem OSCs, organic light-emitting diodes, and high-performance perovskite solar cells as a cathode interfacial material considering its advantages of solution processability, low work function and high conductivity.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in recent years because of their advantages of simple device structure, easy fabrication by solution-processing, light weight and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. Interface engineering between the active layer and electrodes of OSCs is a critical way to achieve high photovoltaic performances. Graphene displays high charge carrier mobilities, mechanical flexibility and compatibility with solution processing etc., but its high work function makes it unsuitable for use as a cathode interfacial material (CIM). Herein, we developed a strategy to disperse graphene in the alcohol-soluble traditional CIM PDINO. The dispersed graphene was n-doped by the nitroxide radical of N-oxide in PDINO, and the n-doped graphene CIM, PDINO–G, possesses the advantages of increased conductivity, lower work function, reduced charge recombination and increased charge collection, and thus it improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs significantly. For example, the OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with the PDINO–G CIM demonstrated a high PCE of 16.52%, which is one of the highest PCE in an OSC to date. The results indicate that PDINO–G is an excellent CIM for OSCs, and can be used in other optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs and perovskite solar cells.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention as hopeful renewable energy source technology due to their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight, printable and versatility of the chemical structure of photovoltaic materials for power generation applications.1,2 Recently, the considerable development of OSCs has benefited from the progress of novel high-performance photovoltaic materials and technological improvement in device fabrication. Since 2015, remarkable progress has been achieved in OSCs using the bulk heterojunction active layer of p-type conjugated polymer donors and n-type organic semiconductor small molecule non-fullerene acceptors.3–7 The non-fullerene acceptors have the advantages of low bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and easily tuned electronic energy levels in comparison with fullerene acceptors. Single junction bulk heterojunction OSCs with over 15% power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been achieved recently by using the novel extended fused aromatic ring acceptor Y6.8,9
However, there are numerous scientific and technological challenges that must be solved to realize the commercialization of OSCs. In the research area of OSCs, their high-throughput processing and large-area manufacturing are yet to be achieved.10–12 Accordingly, interface engineering is a critical factor in achieving a high photovoltaic performance for large-area, printable, flexible and low cost OSCs.13 Alcohol/water soluble interfacial materials have been widely used as interfacial modification materials in optoelectronic devices due to their unique properties and advantages, including electrode work function modification and charge collection improvement from active layers.14–20 Based on the requirements for device manufacturing processes, it is critical to develop new electrode-interfacial materials with superior conductivity and high charge carrier mobility that can work efficiently under thick film conditions.
On the other hand, graphene displays a high specific surface area, remarkable thermal/electrical properties, high charge carrier mobility, transparency, mechanical flexibility, and compatibility with solution processability, and hence it has been used in energy devices, composites, electronics, etc.21–24 In addition, the semi-metallic band structure of graphene affords widely variable work functions based on its continuously tunable Fermi energy. Graphene has been used in electrodes and anode interfacial materials, and cesium-neutralized insulating graphene oxide (GO) was reported as an anode interfacial material (AIM).25–28 Therefore, it is very important to develop methods for the effective dispersion and reduction in work function for the mass production and practical application of graphene materials.
Based on these considerations, we systematically investigated and established an efficient interfacial modification strategy by dispersing graphene in traditional interfacial modification materials, which implemented a doping mechanism to improve the charge transport property and conductivity of interfacial modification materials. Herein, we dispersed graphene powder in a typical water/alcohol soluble CIM (N,N-dimethyl-ammonium N-oxide)propyl perylene diimide (PDINO)29 to obtain solution-processable graphene-containing interfacial modification materials and demonstrated that graphene was well-dispersed and n-doped by the polar moieties in the traditional cathode organic material. The modified interfacial layer exhibited over two orders of magnitude higher conductivity, suitable work function, better charge extraction, and excellent universality for application as a CIM in various high-performance bulk heterojunction OSCs. With the PDINO-doped graphene as the CIM, a single junction bulk heterojunction OSC based on PM6:Y6 achieved a high PCE of 16.52% (average PCE of (16.3 ± 0.2)%).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Dispersion of graphene in PDINO
We chose PDINO as the dispersant for graphene powder based on the following reasons: (a) it is alcohol soluble, (b) it has a large planar electron-deficient π-system and an ionic moiety to interact with graphene via π–π interactions, hydrophobic forces, and Coulomb attraction for dispersion, and (c) it can tune the work function of graphene for its application as a CIM. The calculation results on the adsorption energies of several dispersants including PDINO, 1-pyrenesulfonic acid sodium salt, and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate on the single-layer graphene surface via periodic density functional theory suggest that PDINO has a larger adsorption energy (−3.510 eV) than both sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) (−0.438 eV) and 1-pyrenesulfonic acid sodium salt (−0.271 eV) (Table S1 (ESI†)), which are the two typical surfactants for graphene dispersion and exfoliation of graphite into graphene.30–32 The strong affinity of PDINO to the graphene surface lies in its large, electron-deficient π-conjugated aromatic system and flexible alkyl spacer, which may make the π-conjugated aromatic system and the ionic moiety work independently and synergistically.
The dispersion of graphene was carried out using a bath ultrasonicator and commercially available single-layered graphene in PDINO ethanol solution. The optimal dispersion conditions were PDINO concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and graphene/PDINO weight ratio of less than 20%. A higher PDINO concentration and graphene weight ratio resulted in the aggregation of the graphene. A typical dispersion is represented by the Tyndall effect, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The dispersion of graphene was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), in contrast to the sharp diffraction peak at 26.4° of graphite, the XRD pattern of the typical dispersed graphene (2 mg mL−1 PDINO with 5% graphene) shows a broad and weak peak at 22.5° while the XRD pattern of PDINO shows no peak in the range of 10–40°,32–35 which suggests that the dispersion of graphene in PDINO is probably close to the single-sheet level.35 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the Raman spectrum of the dispersed graphene in PDINO with excitation at 532 nm. The D-band at about 1344 cm−1 and G-band at about 1578.3 cm−1 for PDINO and 1581.2 cm−1 for SDBS dispersant are ascribed to the edges/defects in the lattice and the sp2-hybridized carbon bonds in the graphene lattice, respectively. The featured second-order 2D-band at about 2700 cm−1 and the major intensity ratio of the 2D-band to the G-band illustrate the presence of few-layered graphene.32–35 Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the graphene powder, which show a dominant CC peak at 284.5 eV attributed to the sp2-hybridized carbon bonds in the graphene lattice.32–35 The very weak signal for the C–C band (285.3 eV) from the sp3-hybridized carbon bonds confirms the low content of defects in the graphene flakes. To characterize the number of layers clearly, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows the AFM image of the graphene flakes deposited on a mica substrate, indicating a typical lateral size of around 100 nm and a thickness of about 1.23 nm. According to the thickness distribution of 20 graphene flakes, the majority of graphene flakes have an average thickness of 1.861 nm, indicating the few-layered graphene flakes (<2 layers). More detailed characterization of the dispersions will be discussed later.
2.2 Photovoltaic performance
The dispersed graphene in PDINO (hereinafter called PDINO–G) was employed as a CIM to build the OSCs. The AIM was PEDOT:PSS doped with graphene oxide (hereinafter called PEDOT:PSS-GO) since it was reported that graphene oxide can make PEDOT more conductive by changing its chain conformation and morphology.36–38 PDINO CIM and PEDOT:PSS AIM were also used to fabricate the control devices.8 The donor poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10)5 and acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-5) or 6-fluoro-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDIC-2F),39 which are low cost photovoltaic materials, were used as the active layer materials in the devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS-GO/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/PDINO–G/Al (100 nm). Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of the photovoltaic and interfacial materials used in this work and schematic diagram of the OSCs. In the fabrication of the OSCs, the optimized ratios of graphene in the CIMs and AIMs were achieved by spin-coating 5% (weight percent, wt) graphene in PDINO and 0.5 wt% GO in PEDOT:PSS, respectively (see Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†)).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the photovoltaic and interfacial materials used in this work and schematic diagram of the OSCs device. 
The J–V curves of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a. The devices with bare Al as the cathode exhibited a poorer device performance of 10.15% (Voc = 0.84 V, Jsc = 17.89 mA cm−2, FF = 67.55%). When the typical PDINO CIM was incorporated, the resulting device delivered an enhanced PCE of 11.81% with Voc = 0.90 V, Jsc = 18.06 mA cm−2 and FF = 72.66%. By replacing PDINO with PDINO–G, the resulting device efficiency was enhanced to 12.58% (Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 18.57 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.43%). When PEDOT:PSS-GO was used as the AIM to replace PEDOT:PSS and PDINO was still used as the CIM, the resulting device efficiency was 12.23% (Voc = 0.90 V, Jsc = 18.39 mA cm−2, and FF = 73.92%). By using both graphene-containing interfacial materials, PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM and PDINO–G CIM, the resulting devices exhibited the best PCE of 13.01% (Voc = 0.91 V, Jsc = 19.09 mA cm−2, and FF = 74.87%). The external quantum efficiency spectra of all the devices are presented in Fig. 2b. The integral current density values (Jcalc.) calculated from the external quantum efficiency spectra match well with the Jsc values from the J–V curves (see Table 1). It should be mentioned that the significantly increased Voc of the OSCs with PDINO or PDINO–G as the cathode interfacial layer can be ascribed to the reduced charge recombination and lower work function of the cathode with the cathode interfacial layer, as will be discussed below.

2.3 Characterization of PDINO–G and n-doping of graphene by PDINO
To understand the working mechanism of the PDINO–G CIM in improving the photovoltaic efficiency of the OSCs, we measured the work functions of the CIM on various substrates using both scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).40Table 2 summarizes the work function data of PDINO–G with different doping ratios of graphene on ITO or an evaporated gold electrode. The UPS results show that the work function was reduced from 4.43 to 3.64 eV for the ITO electrode and from 4.44 to 3.77 eV for the evaporated gold electrode after deposition of the PDINO layer. The deposition of the PDINO–G layer reduced the work function to 3.82–4.09 eV for the ITO electrode and 3.83–4.01 eV for the evaporated gold electrode, depending on the graphene ratio in PDINO–G (see Table 2). Meanwhile, the SKPM measurements further reveal the same trend with the UPS results. The small discrepancies between the two measurement techniques are caused by the different atmospheres and experimental conditions. All the work functions are lower than that of graphene (4.60 eV),40 indicating that the addition of graphene to PDINO still maintains the suitable work functions of PDINO for use as CIMs. The interfacial dipole at the electrode surfaces can be formed from the highly polarized N-oxide group in PDINO, which is attributed to the reduction in the work function.

From the UPS measurement, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were down-shifted from −5.88 eV for PDINO to −6.21 eV for PDINO–G (20% graphene in PDINO for example), which sufficiently illustrates that the hole-blocking ability increased with the graphene doping in PDINO (Table S8 (ESI†)). Furthermore, we also measured the bulk phase conductivities for PDINO–G using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PDINO–G/Al. The conductivity was extracted from the experimental data in the region of the ohmic contact, where the slope of the log–log plot is 1.41 The results displayed that the conductivity increased from 9.14 × 10−6 (for PDINO) to 1.18–4.25 × 10−3 S cm−1 (5–20% G in PDINO) by over 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. S8a and Table S8 (ESI†)). Meanwhile, two-point probe devices were fabricated using the organic ribbon mask technique to test the surface conductivity,42 which was also extracted from the experimental data in the region of the ohmic contact. The results further reveal the same trend with that from the SCLC method (Fig. S8b and Table S8 (ESI†)). The bulk phase and surface conductivity results indicate that the doping of graphene promoted the electron conductivity, which is beneficial to improve the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs.
To further illustrate the electron transfer state of PDINO–G, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was conducted.18–21 All samples were studied in the solid form in the dark. For PDINO, a strong ESR signal with a g value of 2.0099 was observed, revealing that electron transfer from the N-oxide to the electron-deficient PDI may take place through self n-doping. After doping 5% graphene in PDINO, the PDINO–G sample (under device conditions) showed strong and broad resonance peaks with a g value of 2.0057 (Fig. 3a). This suggests that the electron transfer state was revised significantly, and the transmission of N-oxide on PDINO changed from self-doping to n-doping for both the PDI unit and graphene. Because the graphene doping provided another new electron transfer channel from the N-oxide, the strength, shape and g value of the ESR signals changed dramatically. To verify our explanation about graphene n-doping, we used a model material, poly[p-(N,N-dimethylamino)styrene]oxide (PSO),18 to disperse graphene (5 wt%) and to study the interaction of the functional group N-oxide with graphene (PSO–G). No ESR signal was detected for PSO, but for PSO–G dispersion sample, obvious ESR signal was observed with a g value of 2.0044 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the nitroxide radical in the N-oxide intermolecularly transfer electrons to graphene and n-dope the graphene.18–21 The additional peak at 2.02 in Fig. 3b comes from the hyperfine splitting of the nitroxide radical, and the hyperfine splitting resulted from the g value anisotropy caused by the slow motion of the nitroxide radical in the solid state.43–46

To further confirm the n-doping behavior of PDINO–G, Raman spectroscopy was employed.33–35,47 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the full Raman spectrum of graphene flakes dispersed by different dispersants, including SDBS, PSO and PDINO. The G-band at 1581.2 cm−1 and the 2D-band at about 2700 cm−1 for graphene flakes were observed using the traditional SDBS dispersant. The very weak D-band at 1344 cm−1 indicates the low defects in the graphene.33–35,47 An ∼2.9 cm−1 red shift in the G-band accompanied by an ∼10.6 cm−1 red shift in the 2D-band was observed for the dispersed graphene samples in PDINO. Simultaneously, similar red shifts were found in the PSO dispersed graphene samples (∼1.7 cm−1 red shift of the G-band and ∼3.2 cm−1 red shift in the 2D-band). Red shifts have been reported on n-doped chemical vapor-deposited (CVD) graphene, and thus the red shifts here may be related to the n-doping of graphene also.48–50 Compared with graphene dispersed with SDBS, the other two dispersants with the same polar group N-oxide caused the same displacement trend, which confirms that the polar groups with nitroxide radicals may result in the red shifts of the G- and 2D-band. However the dispersed graphene contains different layers and a small variation in the number of graphene layers, which may also result in the peak shift, and thus we conducted further experiments to verify this.
To validate the ESR and Raman analysis for the n-doping in PDINO–G, the XPS technique was performed to probe the composition and doping-induced valence band changes.48–50 PSO and its graphene dispersion PSO–G were used as the model materials. In PSO, the N 1s binding energy appears at two positions, one at 399 eV, and the other with a higher binding energy at 402 eV, which are attributed to the nitrogen of the amine and N-oxide, respectively (Fig. 4). The very close molar numbers of O and N of the N-oxide indicates the partial conversion of the amine to N-oxide in PSO. With an increase in the dispersed graphene ratio in PSO, the O 1s binding energy moved from 532.3 eV to a higher value at 532.8 eV, indicating that the electrons transferred to graphene. Simultaneously, the molar ratio of N 1s at 399 eV/402 eV increased. As the electron density of oxygen decreased, the electron density in the nitrogen in the N-oxide increased accordingly and its N 1s moved from 402 eV to 399 eV (Fig. S13, ESI†). This is evidence that the N-oxide transferred electrons to graphene and n-doped the graphene. For PDINO, the N 1s binding energies of amide and N-oxide appear at 400 eV and 403 eV, respectively (Fig. S12 ESI†). However, their molar numbers are not equal, meaning that the nitrogen of the N-oxide increased its electron density and lowered its N 1s binding energy to 400 eV. From the ratio (1.33) of N 1s at 400 eV to that at 403 eV (Table 3), a self-doping level of 15% can be calculated. This is surprising since there is less than one electron per perylene diimide unit. The low doping level may mean that some packing of the perylene units is needed for the self n-doping. With an increase in the dispersed graphene ratio in PDINO–G, a similar trend for N 1s and O 1s was also found as that of PSO–G. Therefore, the XPS measurements directly confirm that the intermolecular n-doping of graphene by PDINO occurred, which is in good agreement with the ESR and Raman results. It should be mentioned that the n-doping of the graphene flakes is not unusual and in fact it is expected since CVD graphene, single wall carbon nanotubes and fullerenes all show n-doping behavior according to the literature.47–50

2.4 Effects of the PDINO–G CIM on the charge carrier mobilities
The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the PTQ10:IDIC-2F blend layers with or without interfacial materials were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method41 with electron-only devices (ITO/ZnO(10 nm)/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/with or without CIMs/Al(100 nm)) and hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS-GO/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/with or without CIMs/MoO3 (5 nm)/Au (40 nm)), respectively. The results are shown in Fig. S14 and Table S9 (ESI†). For the reference device without any interfacial modification treatment, the μe and μh values are 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with μh/μe of 3.99. After incorporating PDINO CIM, μe and μh increased to 7.52 × 10−4 cm2V−1 s−1 and 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a more balanced μh/μe of 2.23. With PEDOT:PSS-GO as the AIM and PDINO–G as the CIM, μe and μh were further enhanced by almost one order of magnitude to 2.48 × 10−3 cm2V−1 s−1 and 3.96 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with most balanced charge mobility μh/μe of 1.59. The more balanced and fast charge transport is believed to contribute to the enhanced Jsc and FF observed in the solar cells by reducing charge recombination and the build-up of space charges. It should be mentioned that the increased hole mobility of the devices with the PDINO or PDINO–G CIM may be related to the reduced surface recombination of the devices with the CIM, as discussed in the following section.
2.5 Charge carrier recombination
To explore the charge extraction properties in the OSCs with the interfacial modification, transient photocurrent (Fig. 5a) and transient photovoltage (Fig. 5b) measurements were executed for the PTQ10:IDIC-2F based devices. The transient photocurrent analysis mainly examines the charge extraction time under short-circuit conditions, which provides some valuable information for charge carriers from the built-in field and recombination. It is noteworthy that the charge extraction time for the device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS-GO/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/PDINO–G/Al) is 0.34 μs, which is much shorter than that of the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/Al (0.65 μs) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/PDINO/Al (0.45 μs). Fig. 5b shows the photovoltage decays from the transient photovoltage measurement of the devices with the different interlayers, which give the charge carrier lifetimes of the OSCs. The charge carrier lifetime for the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS-GO/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/PDINO–G/Al (47.44 μs) is 10.1 times longer than that of the control device (4.68 μs) without CIMs. The charge carrier lifetime of the OSCs device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTQ10:IDIC-2F/PDINO/Al is 24.56 μs. These results suggest that the effective n-doping effect in PDINO–G led to a decrease in the charge extraction time and increase in the lifetime of charge carriers in the devices. The results of the transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage measurements illustrate that the acceleration of carrier extraction may be related to the longer carrier lifetime at open-circuit conditions. The efficient charge extraction and longer carrier lifetime explain the Jsc and FF improvement of the OSCs with the graphene-modified interlayers.

Dependence of (c) Jsc and (d) Voc on light intensity (Plight) in the optimized OSCs based on PTQ10:IDIC-2F. 
To further understand the charge carrier recombination behavior in the OSCs with the different interfacial modification, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on light intensity (Plight) was measured. Jsc and Plight can follow the formula Jsc ∝ (Plight)α,51–53 where α is a parameter related to the recombination degree. The value of α is 0.901, 0.923 and 0.969 for the OSCs with bare Al electrode, PDINO and PDINO–G CIM, respectively (Fig. 5c). The increased α value (closer to 1) of the PDINO–G-based OSC illustrates that the graphene interfacial modification reduced the charge recombination. The results of the Jsc dependence on light intensity verify that there is no obvious charge carrier recombination after incorporating the PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM and PDINO–G CIM, which is consistent with the results of the transient measurements, resulting in the highest PCE of 13.01%.
The relationship between Voc and Plight follows a linear fitting line of Vocversus ln(Plight).51–53 If bimolecular recombination dominates in the devices, the slope of the fitting line should be equal to 1 kT/e (where e is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the Kelvin temperature), if monomolecular recombination (trap-assisted recombination) dominates, and the slope should be equal to 2 kT/e, whereas if surface recombination dominates, the slope should be equal to 0.5 kT/e. In the OSCs without or with PDINO and with the PDINO–G cathode interfacial layer, the slopes of the fitting lines are 0.906 kT/e, 0.949 kT/e, and 0.987 kT/e, respectively (Fig. 5d). The slope close to 1 kT/e for the device with the graphene-modified interfacial material indicates that bimolecular recombination dominates in the device. The slope moving away from 0.5 kT/e and towards 1 kT/e suggests the surface recombination was suppressed for the devices with the PDINO–G CIM.
2.6 Thickness sensitivity analysis
The tolerance to interlayer thickness is very important in the fabrication of OSCs because it is difficult to control the interlayer thickness within several nanometers. Therefore, we studied the effect of the interlayer thickness on the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. Table S10 (ESI†) lists the photovoltaic performance parameters of the OSCs based on PTQ10:IDIC-2F with the PDINO–G thickness ranging from 5 to 30 nm. The efficiency of the OSCs was maintained at above 12% even with a relatively thick PDINO–G CIM film of 30 nm, which benefitted from the high charge mobility/conductivity, good electronic properties and matching energy level of the PDINO–G CIM with the active layer of the OSCs.
2.7 Universality of PDINO–G CIM for different photovoltaic materials
The experimental results mentioned above indicate that the graphene decorated CIM of PDINO–G showed excellent interfacial modification property in the non-fullerene OSCs based on PTQ10:IDIC-2F. Thus, to certify the universality of PDINO–G for application in OSCs, we investigated the effect of PDINO–G on the photovoltaic performance of OSCs based on other two high performance non-fullerene systems, PTQ10:IDIC and PM6:Y6. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of the OSCs based on different photovoltaic active layers, and the photovoltaic performance and photovoltaic parameters of the devices are listed in Table 4 and Tables S11–S13 (ESI†). For the PTQ10:IDIC active layer, the device exhibited a maximum PCE of 12.44% with the incorporation of PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM and PDINO–G CIM (while PCE = 11.56% for the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, and PCE = 10.10% for the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al). In addition, for the devices based on the high performance PM6:Y6 active layer,8 the device parameters Voc, Jsc and FF of the most efficient devices with PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM and PDINO–G CIM were 0.85 V, 25.65 mA cm−2 and 75.78%, respectively, yielding a prominent PCE of 16.52%, which is one of the highest PCE values for a single junction OSC (PCE = 15.32% for the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, and PCE = 13.26% for the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al). It should be mentioned that the highest data were obtained from 10 individual OSCs, which verify the good reproducibility of the high PCE values.

To verify the reliability of our results from the photovoltaic performance measurements in our laboratory, we fabricated inverted OSCs based on PM6:Y6 for certification. Considering the optical absorption of PDINO in the visible region, we introduce NDINO54 to replace PDINO for application as the CIM in the inverted OSCs. NDINO has an identical functional moiety and analogous electron-deficient π-conjugated aromatic system with PDINO, but it does not absorb in the visible region. The preliminary results on the inverted OSC devices (ITO/ZnO/NDINO-G (1 mg mL−1 NDINO with 5% graphene)/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag) displayed a PCE of 15.70% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 25.12 mA cm−2, and FF = 76.20%) in our laboratory (see Table S13, ESI† and Table 4). A PCE of 15.50% (Voc = 0.81 V, Jsc = 24.85 mA cm−2, and FF = 77.00%) was certified by the National Institute of Metrology, China (see the Test Report in Fig. S20 (ESI†)). Thus, the certified result indicates the reliability of the device test conditions in our laboratory.
3. Conclusion
In summary, an efficient interfacial modification strategy was systematically investigated and established by adding graphene to the classical CIM PDINO (PDINO–G). The dispersed graphene in PDINO–G was n-doped by the nitroxide radical of N-oxide in PDINO, which was certified by the ESR, Raman and XPS results. Our strategy to disperse graphene in polar CIMs solves two problems for the use of graphene as a CIM, one is solution processability, the other is the high work function that is not suitable for cathode interlayers. The n-doped PDINO–G CIM possesses increased conductivity, reduced charge recombination and increased charge extraction rate. The OSCs based on PTQ10:IDIC-2F with PDINO–G CIM and PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM demonstrated the best PCE of 13.01%, which is significantly enhanced in comparison with the PCE values of the control devices without the graphene-containing interfacial material. The universality of the high performance PDINO–G CIM was verified on the two other photovoltaic systems based on PTQ10:IDIC and PM6:Y6. Especially, the single junction bulk heterojunction OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with PDINO–G CIM and PEDOT:PSS-GO AIM displayed a high PCE of 16.52%. The results indicate that the n-doped PDINO–G is an excellent CIM for OSCs, and it can be applied in many other optoelectronic devices such as tandem OSCs, organic light-emitting diodes, organic field effect transistors, and high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Ltd. PM6, Y6, IDIC, PDINO and NDINO were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. and used as received without further purification. Other chemicals and solvents were obtained from J&K, Alfa Aesar, and TCI Chemical. Co. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, PVP Al 4083) was obtained from H. C. Starck. The ITO glass (thickness 1.1 mm, 15 Ω per square, transmittance ≥86%, soda-lime glass and Nippon sheet glass) was purchased from South China Science & Technology Company, Ltd. PTQ10 (GPC: Mn = 30.1 kDa and Mw/Mn = 1.57 anal.). IDIC-2F and PSO (GPC: Mn = 15.6 kDa; Mw/Mn = 1.60 anal.) were synthesized according to previously reported methods.5,18,39 A mixture of PDINO surfactant and single-layer graphene power (5–20 wt%), and ethanol was sonicated for 20 min in an ice-water bath. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 min.
4.2 Device fabrication and characterization
The conventional device structures were indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS-GO/active layer/PDINO or PDINO–G/Al. Pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates were treated by UV-ozone treatment for 30 min, and then about 30 nm PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS-GO was coated onto the substrates at a spinning rate of 3200 rpm, and dried at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-protected glove box. Before spin-coating the photoactive layers, all blend solutions with polymer concentrations of about 3 mg mL−1 were stirred thoroughly at 40 °C for about 2 h in a glove box. PTQ10:IDIC-2F (1:1 weight ratio) in chloroform solution, PTQ10:IDIC (1:1 weight ratio) in chloroform solution, and PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 weight ratio) in chloroform:chloronaphthalene (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution were spin-coated to obtain a film thickness of approximately 100 nm. After spin-coating, the active layers were annealed at 110 °C for 5 min for the devices with thermal annealing treatment. Then ethanol solution of PDINO–G cathode interlayer at a concentration of 2.0 mg mL−1 with 5% graphene was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm with a thickness of 10 nm (unless otherwise stated). Finally, 100 nm of aluminum was thermally deposited atop the interface in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of about 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. For the devices fabricated at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in China, a shadow mask with an effective device area of 0.046 cm2 was used.
The inverted devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/NDINO-G/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.24 g of zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, Aldrich) and 0.83 μL of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%, Aldrich) in 3.00 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, J&K Scientific). A thin layer of ZnO was deposited by spin-coating the ZnO solution on pre-cleaned ITO glass at 6000 rpm and then dried at 200 °C for 1 h. Then a methanol solution of NDINO-G cathode interlayer at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 with 5% graphene was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm, and dried at 100 °C for 4 min in air. Then the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-protected glove box, in which the active layer of PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) was spin-coated from its chloroform solution onto the interface processed substrates. Subsequently, the active layers were annealed at 110 °C for 10 min for the devices with thermal annealing treatment. Then 12 nm MoO3 and 100 nm of silver were evaporated at a pressure of about 5.0 × 10−5 Pa in succession. For the devices fabricated at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in China, a shadow mask with an effective device area of 0.046 cm2 was used.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under 1 sun, AM1.5G spectrum from a classic solar simulator (Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp in a glove box filled with nitrogen. The light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 by a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The EQE was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Taiwan, Enli Technology Co. Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
4.3 Instruments and measurements
Molecular weight measurements of all polymers were carried out on an Agilent PL-GPC 220 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) instrument using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C. The bath ultrasonicator was purchased from Shenzhen Pinhuang Science and Technology Ltd (Model Number: Dongsen DS-040ST) with the ultrasonic maximum power of 240 W, ultrasonic frequency 40 kHz, and max capacity 10 L. Absorption spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectrometer (Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer). Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy was implemented on a KP Technology SKP5050. ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer (300 K, 9.063 GHz, X-band). The microwave power used was 1 mW, and the magnetic field sweep width ranged from 3310 to 3710 G. The modulation frequency was 100 kHz, and the modulation amplitude was 3.5 G. AFM measurements were carried out using a Bruker-ICON2-SYS in tapping mode. The RMS values of the surface AFM images were averaged based on five times testing on different areas for each sample. The thickness of the active-layer and interlayer was determined using a Prolometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2), in combination with extrapolation from an absorbance–thickness curve assuming a linear dependence of absorbance at 480 nm for the cathode interlayer on the film thickness. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALab250Xi system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALab220i-XL system. XRD patterns of the pristine graphite and the graphene film were collected on an Empyrean Rigaku-D/max 2500 V X-ray diffractometer with Cu KR radiation. Raman spectra were recorded using an Olympus FV1000-IX81 Raman microscope equipped with a 533 nm Ar ion laser. The transient photocurrent of the devices was measured by applying 500 nm laser pulses with a power of 0.354 MW. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace). The photovoltage produced a transient voltage signal on a 10 MΩ resistor and the photocurrent produced a transient voltage signal on a 50 Ω resistor, which was recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C).
The ESR samples of PDINO–G and PSO–G were prepared using ethanol as the dispersion solution with different graphene ratios followed by freeze drying under vacuum. The Raman samples of graphene were prepared by vacuum filtration of PDINO–G or PSO–G dispersion (centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min) with a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (pore size: 0.45 μm), followed by careful washing with deionized water, methanol and ethanol once to remove the surfactant, and drying under vacuum for 3 h. The XPS, UPS and SKPM samples of PDINO–G and PSO–G were prepared by spin-coating the PDINO–G and PSO–G dispersion (2 mg mL−1 PDINO solution with different ratio of graphene) at 2000 rpm for 30 s onto silica dioxide substrates, ITO substrates and evaporated Au substrates, respectively.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in recent years because of their advantages of simple device structure, easy fabrication by solution-processing, light weight and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. Interface engineering between the active layer and electrodes of OSCs is a critical way to achieve high photovoltaic performances. Graphene displays high charge carrier mobilities, mechanical flexibility and compatibility with solution processing etc., but its high work function makes it unsuitable for use as a cathode interfacial material (CIM). Herein, we developed a strategy to disperse graphene in the alcohol-soluble traditional CIM PDINO. The dispersed graphene was n-doped by the nitroxide radical of N-oxide in PDINO, and the n-doped graphene CIM, PDINO–G, possesses the advantages of increased conductivity, lower work function, reduced charge recombination and increased charge collection, and thus it improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs significantly. For example, the OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with the PDINO–G CIM demonstrated a high PCE of 16.52%, which is one of the highest PCE in an OSC to date. The results indicate that PDINO–G is an excellent CIM for OSCs, and can be used in other optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs and perovskite solar cells.
