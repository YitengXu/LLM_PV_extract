    , Accepted 13th October 2020First published on 14th October 2020AbstractThe development of halogenated organic semiconducting materials has triggered a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. Herein, two wide-bandgap polymers containing an electron-deficient [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-f]isoindole-5,7(2H,6H)-dione (TzBI) unit were developed, by introducing a halogen atom into the thienyl side chain of the copolymerized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit. When combined with a non-fullerene acceptor Y6, both copolymers presented increased crystalline coherence length and significantly reduced phase-separated domain size, thus resulting in higher charge transfer efficiency and more satisfactory charge transport properties than the non-halogenated polymer analogue PHT-EHp without halogen substituents in the thienyl unit of the side-chain. The organic solar cell device based on the PClT-EHp:Y6 blend presents a remarkable current density of 27.3 mA cm−2 and an impressively high internal quantum efficiency approaching 100% at the wavelength of 820 nm, both of which are among the highest values reported for single-junction organic solar cells. Moreover, the devices prepared from PClT-EHp and the Y6-derivative, Y6DT, present a further enhanced efficiency of 16.4%, demonstrating the efficacy of delicate materials design toward high-performance binary organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their good compatibility with printing techniques and great potential to be integrated with portable electronics.1–3 Non-fullerene OSCs have gradually been the protagonist in this field due to the good light-harvesting ability, especially in the near-infrared region of the non-fullerene components.4–7 Recently, the state-of-the-art OSCs, comprising conjugated polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 18%.8–11 This great progress is attributable to the combined strategies of delicate design of new light-harvesting materials, multiple optimizations of relevant device architectures, and rational light-management strategies.12–15 The recently emerged non-fullerene acceptor Y6 has enabled significant enhancement in PCE metrics of OSCs, since the π-face-on single-crystal packing of Y6 can lead to large electronic coupling, high electron mobility, and large electron affinity.16,17
While the design of NFAs determines the efficiency level of OSCs to a significant degree, the development of polymer donors yet plays a certain role in the further upgrade of photovoltaic performances of OSCs.18–21 Among the reported polymer donors for OSCs, the PTzBI-derivatives that contain a pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7-dione (TzBI) unit have been considered as promising candidates, owing to their complementary absorption spectra with high-performance narrow band gap NFAs that allow for efficient light-harvesting to achieve high short-circuit current densities (JSC), and relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels that are favorable for realizing high open-circuit voltages (VOC). Moreover, the PTzBI framework provides a platform for the molecular design through chemical modification and thus enables finely tunable optoelectronic properties.9,21,23
It has been established that the introduction of a certain amount of halogen atoms onto the skeleton and/or side-chain of polymer donors can be a valid method to modulate the opto-electrical and aggregation properties of the resulting materials.22–24 In particular, the pioneering work of the incorporation of halogen atoms into the side chains of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been proven to be effective for constructing high-performance polymer donors for OSCs.25–29 The fluorine (F) atom has been employed in polymer donors to adjust the electronic structures and interactions between molecules, resulting in a range of extensively used highly efficient polymer donors.30,31 However, the incorporation of F atom substitution increased the complexity of synthesis and thus the overall cost. An alternative strategy is to incorporate cost-effective chloride (Cl) atoms, which has weaker electronegativity than F atoms, and the empty 3d orbitals of the Cl atom can accommodate free π-electrons, thus resulting in decreased molecular energy levels of materials and broadened absorption spectra.25–29,32
In this work, we introduced halogen atoms, including both F and Cl atoms, into the thienyl side-chain of the BDT unit, and constructed wide-bandgap conjugated polymers containing a TzBI-unit to investigate the impact of halogen substituents on the relevant photovoltaic properties of these copolymers. The resulting polymer donors, PHT-EHp, PFT-EHp and PClT-EHp, with substituents of hydrogen (H), F, and Cl atoms, respectively, on the thienyl side chain of the BDT unit, present different degrees of molecular planarity. Of particular interest is the device based on the PClT-EHp:acceptor, Y6, which gives a remarkable JSC of 27.3 mA cm−2 and an impressively high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) approaching 100% at a wavelength of 820 nm, which are among the highest values reported for single-junction OSCs. Furthermore, by incorporating a Y6-derived acceptor, Y6DT, the PClT-EHp-based binary devices present an upgraded PCE of 16.4%, demonstrating the efficacy of delicate materials design in developing highly efficient organic solar cells.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and photoelectrical properties
The polymer donors PHT-EHp, PFT-EHp and PClT-EHp were synthesized by copolymerizing TzBI with the BDT block that incorporates different pendant moieties (Fig. 1a), with the specific synthetic routes summarized in Scheme S1 (see the ESI†). The number average molecular weight (Mn) of these resulting polymers is in the range 19.5–2.46 kDa with polydispersity in the range of 2.6–2.9 (ESI†), as estimated by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography at 150 °C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were used to understand the molecular conformation, with the dimer unit of (HT-EHp)2, (FT-EHp)2 and (ClT-EHp)2 as the input structure (Fig. S1, ESI†). It was noted that the Cl atom as the substituent resulted in a slightly larger dihedral angle between the BDT unit and the vertical thiophene ring, which is reasonable due to the larger atomic radius of Cl. Note that the polymer PClT-EHp displays a very small torsion angle between alkylthienyl-substituted BDT and the flanked thiophene ring of the TzBI unit in the polymer backbone, agreeing with the observed planar conformation of PClT-EHp. The polymer donors with a more planar conformation would facilitate π–π stacking and contribute to the formation of desirable film morphology.33

The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of neat films and blend films are shown in Fig. 1b and S2 (ESI†), respectively. The donors' absorption is located in the range of 400–700 nm, complementary to the absorption profile of Y6 and Y6DT (Fig. 1a) that exhibit absorption peaks at about 820 nm. Moreover, PFT-EHp and PClT-EHp exhibited an obviously blue-shifted absorption spectrum relative to PHT-EHp, attributable to the electron-withdrawing effect of halogen atoms. Cyclic voltammetry was used to estimate the energy levels of the donor polymers, with corresponding characteristics shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PHT-EHp, PFT-EHp, and PClT-EHp were calculated to be −5.60 eV, −5.64 eV, and −5.71 eV, respectively. Based on the ionization potentials measured by using the photoelectron yield spectra (AC-3), the HOMO energy levels of PHT-EHp, PFT-EHp, and PClT-EHp were determined to be −4.91 eV, −5.08 eV and −5.12 eV, respectively (Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate the consistency of the changes in the energy level among these polymers and indicate that PClT-EHp with a relatively deeper HOMO energy level essentially has a higher possibility to attain a large VOC.
Photovoltaic performance
Based on the well matched absorption and energy levels for the developed polymers and Y6, we fabricated a solar cell using a device structure of (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFNDI-Br/Ag) with polymer:Y6 blends as the photoactive layer, where a thin layer of cathode interface PFNDI-Br was employed to facilitate the electron extraction. As we focused on the impact of different donors on the device performance, we simplified the fabrication procedure under optimized conditions, i.e., using chloroform as the main solvent with maintaining the donor:acceptor ratio at 1:1 (w/w), which led to a similar active layer thicknesses of ∼100 nm. Note that the photovoltaic performances of devices decreased upon increased film thickness (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The amount of solvent additive was screened, with the optimal additive as 1.0 vol% dibenzylether (DBE). Representative current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells measured under standard AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 2a, with the extracted photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1.

The as-cast devices based on PClT-EHp:Y6 (1:1) present a modest PCE of 10.3%, with a VOC of 0.86 V, a short circuit-current density (JSC) of 23.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 50.1% (Table 1, Fig. S5 and Table S2, ESI†). The DBE treatment induces a significant increase in JSC (27.3 mA cm−2) and FF (72.6%), while the VOC marginally declines to 0.80 V, giving a decent overall PCE of 15.8%. Further addition of DBE leads to gradually decreased performance, and thus, we used 1.0% DBE to optimize devices based on the other two polymer donors (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI†). It was clearly discovered that the devices based on polymers containing halogen atoms exhibited much better device performance than that based on PHT-EHp:Y6 counterparts, suggesting the efficacy of halogen substitution (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Furthermore, the impedance spectra analysis suggests the non-halogenated PHT-EHp based device shows the lowest shunt resistance while the PClT-EHp based device shows the highest shunt resistance (Fig. S7, ESI†), which is consistent with the observed trend of the obtained FF of corresponding devices.34
The largely elevated JSC is verified by using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, where the EQE of both PFT-EHp and PClT-EHp based devices exceeds 80% in a wide range of 450–830 nm, significantly higher than that of the PHT-EHp case (Fig. 2b). The integrated current density is 26.3 and 26.5 mA cm−2 for PFT-EHp:Y6 and PClT-EHp:Y6 cells, respectively, confirming the accuracy of the J–V measurements. To further study the photoelectrical conversion process in the champion cell based on PClT-EHp:Y6, we measured the reflectivity (R) of the whole device, and calculated the IQE from the formula, IQE = EQE/(1 − R).35 The final results are displayed in Fig. 2c, where we note a very high IQE approaching 100% at ∼860 nm. Such a high IQE implies that essentially every absorbed photon can result in a separated pair of charge carriers and almost all photogenerated carriers are collected at the ITO and silver electrodes.
Charge carrier dynamics
To explicitly understand the process of exciton dissociation and charge collection, we measured the photocurrent (Jph) as a function of the effective applied voltage (Veff). Jph is defined by the difference in light (JL) and dark current density (JD), and Veff is defined by Vbi–Vappl, where Vbi refers to the voltage when Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied bias.36 As shown in Fig. 2d, the PClT-EHp:Y6 based device displays the highest saturation photo-current density (Jph) of 27.6 mA cm−2, much higher than that of the PHT-EHp:Y6 device (23.0 mA cm−2), indicating the superior maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) of the former (Table S4, ESI†). Charge collection probability P(E,T) was calculated according to the relation P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat, which under certain conditions is relevant to the efficiency of exciton dissociation or field-dependence of geminate or nongeminate recombination.37 As seen from Fig. S8a (ESI†), it can be noted that the P(E,T) of the PClT-EHp:Y6 device exhibits the weakest dependence on Veff, with on average the highest values upon variation of Veff. These tendencies provide an indication that the introduction of halogen into the donor component is an efficient method to optimize the light harvesting and charge collection in the studied blend system.
We further determined the dielectric constant (εr) and reorganization energy in these blends to understand the properties of charge separation and recombination in operational devices. The general relationship between exciton binding energy Eb and the dielectric constant is described by Eb = q2/4πε0εrrct, where q is the elementary charge, and rct is the separation between the hole and electron at charge transfer states (CTSs).38 A high dielectric constant of a device will be beneficial for the reduction of Eb, thus promoting the dissociation of charge transfer-states into the mobile carrier.38 As shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†), the εr of the blend film containing F and Cl atoms is 4.05 and 3.78, respectively, higher than that of the blends with the non-halogenated donor PHT-EHp (εr = 3.65). We attribute the excellent JSC and IQE values of PFT-EHp cells partially to the higher εr and resultant decrease in Eb, such that in a certain spectral range (in our case in the acceptor absorption regime around 820 nm), the absorbed photon to electron conversion process is nearly loss-free, leading to a maximal IQE approaching unity with high EQEs across a wide spectrum (Fig. 2c).
Further investigations were conducted by testing the relationship of JSC–Plight and VOC–Plight, where Plight is the illumination density. The Plight-dependence of JSC is generally described using the power law as, JSC ∼ Plightα, with the power ranging between 0.85 and 1.39 As shown in Fig. 3a, the best fitting to the JSC–Plight characteristics leads to an α value of 0.963 (PHT-EHp), 0.976 (PFT-EHp), and 0.983 (PClT-EHp). The α for the PClT-EHp device exhibits the least deviation from unity, indicative of the relatively weaker bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions or reduced space-charge effects,39 Fig. S8c (ESI†) shows the VOC–Plight characteristics of these solar cells. Relatively low slope values (<1.5kBq/T) are observed (except for the PFT-EHp:Y6 device), indicating the minor role of trap-assisted recombination. In the case of the PClT-EHp:Y6 cell, the slight upper deviation from the ideality factor being 1 may be related to morphology traps or inhomogeneous distribution of photo-generated carriers within the active layer.40

We also performed transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements to explore the competition of charge recombination and charge extraction in solar cell devices with halogenated donor components. The TPC decay time of PFT-EHp:Y6 and PClT-EHp:Y6 devices was determined to be 0.55 and 0.27 μs, respectively (Fig. 3b), while the PHT-EHp:Y6 cell presents a higher decay time of 0.75 μs. These results evidence that by utilizing halogenated donors, the efficiency of charge-sweep-out is much higher, especially with the chloride-containing donor. To better understand these phenomena, we measured transient photovoltage (TPV) on the same set of devices (Fig. 3c). The results of TPV are well consistent with the TPC results, i.e. the PHT-EHp:Y6 devices show the shortest TPV decay time (27.4 μs), compared to the values of PFT-EHp:Y6 (52.0 μs) and PClT-EHp:Y6 (59.6 μs) devices. The almost doubled TPV decay strongly suggests that charge recombination is slower in the halogenated devices, especially in PClT-EHp:Y6, which is a key merit for the mitigation on carrier losses, thus affording the high IQE.

OC loss analysis
Electroluminescence (EL) and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) were used to reveal the situation of energy loss in these devices. The radiative efficiency, termed electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL), was obtained by applying an injection current density close to the JSC of these devices (Fig. S9a–c, ESI†). The non-radiative VOC loss (ΔVOC,nr) was evaluated according to the relation, ΔVOC,nr (T) = −(kBT/q)ln(EQEEL), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.21 Through determination of the (device) band gap, Eg, extracted from the EQE spectra (Fig. S9d–f, ESI†), the detailed VOC loss parts contributing to the total voltage loss were calculated (see Table S5, ESI†). The three devices give a similar and relatively low ΔVOC,nr of ∼0.23 V. It can be noted that the PClT-EHp:Y6-device shows a slightly higher radiative limit VOC (VOC,rad = 1.03 V), with regard to other devices. Additionally, by comparing the Urbach-tail induced VOC loss, i.e., the difference between Shockley–Queisser limit VOC (VOC,SQ) and VOC,rad, we observe a lower loss of 0.16 V for the PClT-EHp:Y6-device with respect to that of 0.19 V and 0.23 V found for the PFT-EHp:Y6 and PHT-EHp:Y6 based devices, respectively. These results hint that the energetic disorder at the donor/acceptor interface may reduce in the PClT-EHp:Y6 cell, which can account for the larger VOC of 0.80 V (Table 1). We also exploited FTPS to assess the reorganization energy (λ) in these blends. The λ was determined by fitting the FTPS curves with the well-established Marcus equation.41 As illustrated in Fig. 3d and Table S5 (ESI†), the devices based on PHT-EHp:Y6 and PFT-EHp:Y6 are associated with a λ value of 0.13 and 0.15 eV, respectively, which is lower than that of the PClT-EHp:Y6 devices (0.22 eV). These results are consistent with the above energy loss analysis and are reasonably understood by the fact that PClT-EHp with a more planar molecular skeleton can further enhance the electron delocalization, thus contributing to a higher reorganization energy.41
Morphology analysis
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to study the structural order in the BHJ blends. As shown by 2D scattering patterns (Fig. S10, ESI†), the introduced halogen does not alter the “face-on” texture of the molecular π-stacking in the blends. The sector averaged curves in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are shown in Fig. 4a. Fitting the high-q range of the OOP curves with the Scherrer formula can parameterize the length scale crystallites in the blends in a global manner (Fig. S11, ESI†).42 The π–π stacking peaks of the blends are located at a similar q position of 1.72 A−1. The crystalline coherence lengths (CCLs) of the π–π stacking were found to be 2.4, 2.6, and 2.7 nm for the blends with PHT-EHp, PFT-EHp, and PClT-EHp, respectively (Table S6, ESI†), which suggests an enhanced molecular ordering in BHJs with halogenated donors. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) were used to reveal the mesoscale morphology of the blends in real and reciprocal space, respectively. TEM images of the PHT-EHp:Y6 blend show fibrillar mixing features, while enlarged bright regimes are seen across the images of PFT-EHp:Y6 and PClT-EHp:Y6 blends (Fig. 4b). The RSoXS averaged curves show hump profiles with characteristic lengths of 82 nm, 67 nm, and 54 nm for PHT-EHp:Y6, PFT-EHp:Y6, and PClT-EHp:Y6 blends, respectively, as estimated by 2π/q (Fig. 4c).

Combining the results of GIWAXS, TEM, and RSoXS, we can conclude that morphology improvements play a key role in boosting the solar cell performance of devices based on halogenated polymers. The extended CCLs indicate increased π-stack populations in crystallites that can promote charge transport. The higher relative phase purity, evidenced by the increased image contrast in TEM and the decreased domain sizes indicated by RSoXS, points to a suitable phase separation, which facilitate the exciton diffusion-mediated dissociation processes and reduction of interfacial charge recombination. These merits in morphology fully agree with the improved photophysical processes corresponding to an ultrahigh IQE and expedited charge sweep-out process with reduced recombination, eventually achieving the improvement of JSC and FF in devices.
Conclusion
In summary, we developed two wide bandgap π-conjugated polymers by incorporating halogen substituents into the thienyl side chain of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit. The resulting halogenated copolymers presented slightly blue-shifted absorption and deepened HOMO levels. The OSCs prepared from the chlorine-substituted polymeric donor PCl-EHp and non-fullerene acceptor Y6 yielded a champion efficiency of 15.8%. Morphology investigations indicate that the introduction of halogen atoms modifies the microstructures of BHJ layers in a way that the crystalline coherence length slightly increases and the phase-separated domain size appropriately reduces. These benefits are conductive to charge generation and charge transport in the device, thus attributing to the extremely high IQE approaching 100% (at 820 nm) and the remarkable JSC (27.3 mA cm−2), which are among the highest values reported in single-junction OSCs. Moreover, we show that based on the Y6DT acceptor with the finely decorated chemical structure, a further improved efficiency (16.4%) could be realized. The presented results demonstrate the halogen substitution-based chemical tailoring to be a feasible strategy toward high-performance binary organic solar cells.
