    , Accepted 22nd March 2012First published on 22nd March 2012AbstractTunable energy band CdSexS(1−x) quantum dots (QD) are developed for QD-sensitized solar cells(QDSSCs) by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The results indicated that the energy band and the light absorption of CdSexS(1−x) QDs could be controlled by the ratio of the sulphur (S) and the selenium (Se). Compared with the conventional CdS/CdSe system, its absorption spectrum and monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum show higher light harvest ability and a broader response wavelength region. As a result, a high energy conversion efficiency of 2.27% was obtained with the CdSexS(1−x) QDSSCs under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2. After being further treated with CdSe QDs, the CdSexS(1−x)/CdSe QDSSC yielded an energy conversion efficiency of 3.17% due to the enhanced absorption and the reduced recombination. It can be expected that tunable energy band QDs controlled by the ratio of atoms can contribute to higher efficiency QDSSCs.
Introduction
In the past decade, the sustained increase in demand for energy has greatly encouraged the exploration of non-fossil energy resources, especially solar energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as one of the most cost-effective alternatives to first generation photovoltaic devices due to their low cost and simple fabrication process.1 Up to now, a certified energy conversion efficiency of 11.5% has been achieved with an organic sensitizer in a DSSC.2 In addition to organic sensitizers, semiconductor QDs, possessing several significant advantages such as tunable bandgap, strong light absorption, and high stability against oxidative deterioration,3–5 have been widely investigated for use in DSSCs.6
Although a higher maximum theoretical efficiency (44%) is expected compared with conventional DSSCs with organic sensitizers,7 QDSSCs still present lower energy conversion efficiency. Initially, single QD sensitizers such as InAs, CdS, CdSe, PdS and AgS were investigated in QDSSCs, but most of these QDSSCs presented low energy conversion efficiency less than 2%.8–14 Subsequent research has shown that cascade QDSSCs with several different types of QDs could effectively improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.15–20 Hossain et al.21 reported that a CdS/CdSe-sensitized SnO2 solar cell achieved a photocurrent density up to 17.4 mA cm−2 and an energy conversion efficiency of 3.68%. Yang et al.19 used Pt, CuS, CoS, and CuS/CoS counter electrodes for CdS/CdSe QDSSCs and obtained energy conversion efficiencies of 3.0%, 3.3%, 3.8%, and 4.1%, respectively. Zhang et al.22 investigated the influence of structural properties of various TiO2 photoanodes on the performance of CdS/CdSe QDSSCs and achieved an energy conversion efficiency up to 4.92%. Generally, in single QDSSCs, in order to inject the excited electrons from the QDs to TiO2, the conduction band edge of the QDs should be higher than that of TiO2, but too high or too low is not advisable. In the case of QD cosensitization, for instance, a high energy conversion efficiency of 2.2% was achieved in a CdHgTe–CdTe QDSSC but only 1.0% in a CdTe–CdHgTe QDSSC in Chang's group.23 This result suggested that the energy band edge of QDs should be suited to those of the cosensitizers and TiO2. For QDs prepared by the SILAR technique, the energy band and the light absorption can be tunable by the SILAR cycle numbers of QDs. However, this regulation is relatively rough, since the SILAR cycle numbers are related to the size of QDs, which is limited by the pore size of the TiO2 film.
Herein, CdSexS(1−x) QDs, whose energy band and light absorption can be controlled by the ratio of S and Se, was developed for QDSSCs. As a result, a high energy efficiency of 2.27% was obtained in a CdSexS(1−x) QDSSC system. After being further treated with CdSe, a higher energy efficiency up to 3.17% was achieved due to the enhanced absorption and reduced recombination. This work provides a new method to improve the energy efficiency of QDSSCs with the tunable energy band QDs.
Experimental
A mesoscopic TiO2 film was prepared on FTO glass by the doctor-blade method with TiO2 paste, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the TiO2 film was controlled at about 11 μm. Na2SexS(1−x) solution was prepared by dissolving Na2S·9H2O and Se powder in methanol and then stirring to form a red brown solution. The ratios of Na2S·9H2O to Se were 0.625 M/0.125 M, 0.5 M/0.125 M, 0.375 M/0.125 M and 0.25 M/0.125 M, where the corresponding Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution concentrations were 0.625 M, 0.5 M, 0.375 M and 0.25 M, respectively. The TiO2/CdSexS(1−x) electrode was assembled by the SILAR technique. The TiO2 film was dipped into the Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution for 30 s, and then rinsed with methanol. After that the electrodes coated with Cd(NO3)2 were dipped into the Na2SexS(1−x) methanol solution for 30 s, then rinsed with methanol; this procedure formed one SILAR cycle. When a sample underwent n SILAR cycles, it is herein marked as TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(n). Then, the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x) electrode was dipped into a 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution for 5 min, rinsed with water and then dipped into a 0.5 M Na2SeSO3 solution at 70 °C for 10 min, and finally rinsed with water; this procedure formed another SILAR cycle. The TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(n) electrode underwent m SILAR cycles, herein marked as TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(n)/CdSe(m). TiO2/CdS(n), TiO2/CdSe(n) and TiO2/CdS(n)/CdSe(m) electrodes were prepared as reported.17 The QDSSC was sandwiched with the QD-sensitized electrode and the Pt-counter electrode by a 25 μm sealing film. The electrolyte used in this procedure is composed of 2.0 M Na2S, 0.5 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in water/methanol (7:3 v/v) solution.
The UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded with a Lambda 950 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). The morphology of TiO2 powder was investigated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) from Tecnai G2 20 (FEI, Holland). Element component scanning was performed using a Sirion 200 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI, Holland) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a Parstat 2273 (PAR,USA). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of QDSSCs were measured with a Keithley 2400 meter (Keithley, USA) under the illumination of air mass 1.5 (AM1.5), 100 mW cm−2 by an Oriel 91192 solar simulator (Newport, USA). The corresponding incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured with a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit system (Newport, USA). The active area was obtained with a mask containing a round hole of 0.13 cm2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the TEM images of the scraped TiO2 powders before and after CdSexS(1−x) sensitization. Fig. 1a shows that the particles are clean, transparent and regular-shaped crystals with clear boundaries and sizes about 20 nm. After being sensitized with QDs, the boundary of TiO2 particles becomes obscure and the particles are connected by 4 to 6 nm small particles, as shown in Fig. 1b. This could be attributed to CdSexS(1−x) particles with sizes of 4–6 nm homogeneously covering the surface of TiO2 powders.

To improve the efficiency of QDSSCs, an appropriate energy band with well matched energy band edge for both the TiO2 and the electrolyte is needed. Here, the tunable energy band CdSexS(1−x) QDs for QDSSCs is controlled by the ratio of S and Se, and the x value in CdSexS(1−x) QDs is optimized by the ratio of Na2S·9H2O/Se and estimated by the performance of CdSexS(1−x) QDSSCs. Fig. 2 presents the J–V curves of TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(10) QDSSCs with different molar ratios of Na2S·9H2O/Se, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that when the molar ratio of Na2S·9H2O/Se increases from 2:1 to 4:1, the photocurrent density (Jsc) of the QDSSC increases from 4.55 mA cm−2 (2:1) to 7.09 mA cm−2 (3:1) and to 7.55 mA cm−2 (4:1). The open circuit voltage (Voc) increases from 0.35 V (2:1) to 0.37 V (3:1) and to 0.41 V (4:1). Upon further increasing the molar ratio of Na2S·9H2O/Se to 5:1, the Jsc and Voc decrease to 7.11 mA cm−2 and 0.40 V, respectively. However, the fill factor (FF) is almost constant around 0.61. This could be attributed to the change of energy band. A high Se content, corresponding to a narrow band gap and high absorption, results in declined driving force of electron injection from QDs to TiO2, thus leading to a low Voc and Jsc. As a result, the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency of 1.86% is obtained when the molar ratio of Na2S·9H2O/Se is 4:1. Therefore, the molar ratio of Na2S·9H2O/Se is optimized to 4:1 for the tunable CdSexS(1−x) QDs and this ratio is fixed for the following characterization.

The CdSexS(1−x) QD-sensitized TiO2 film was analyzed by SEM equipped with EDS and results are presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a presents the EDS dot scanning spectrum of the center scope within the CdSexS(1−x) QD-sensitized TiO2 film. The peaks at 1.40, 2.33, and 3.15 keV can be attributed to Se L, S K and Cd L, which confirm the existence of CdSexS(1−x) in the TiO2 film. From the white line shown in the SEM image of Fig. 3b, the signal intensities of Se, S and Cd elements throughout the cross-section of the TiO2 film were scanned linearly by EDS analysis and results are presented in Fig. 3c. As a control, the peak distribution of Ti element is also presented. It is clear that the signal intensities of Se, S and Cd are smooth within the area of the Ti signal, which indicates that the Se, S and Cd are homogeneously distributed within the TiO2 film. Moreover, the ratio of S to Se throughout the cross-section of the CdSexS(1−x) QD-sensitized TiO2 film estimated by EDS is about 0.56, which means the optimized tunable energy band QD-sensitizer is CdSe0.64S0.36.

Compared with the single QD-sensitizer, a cascade QDSSC sensitized with different QDs could effectively improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency due to broader absorption. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the optimized electrodes TiO2/CdSe(4), TiO2/CdS(4), TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4), TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) and TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) were characterized spectrophotometrically and results are presented in Fig. 4. It could be found that TiO2/CdS(4) exhibits a characteristic peak of CdS and an absorption edge at about 500 nm. TiO2/CdSe(4) exhibits an absorption edge at about 665 nm and a shoulder at 600–650 nm. However, the cascade electrode TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) shows a mixed absorption spectrum of TiO2/CdS(4) and TiO2/CdSe(4), indicating the existence of a cascade microstructure. In contrast, the shape and intensity of the absorption curve of TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) electrode differ from those of single TiO2/CdSe(4), TiO2/CdS(4) and cascade TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) electrodes, whose absorption edges stopped at about 675 nm. This result indicates that the compound CdSexS(1−x) with a different energy band is obtained and distributed homogeneously within the TiO2 electrode. However, when the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) electrode is further treated with Cd(NO3)2 and Na2SeSO3 solution twice, the cascade electrode TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) is formed and its color became much darker. As shown in Fig. 4, comparing with the cascade electrode TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4), the absorption of the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) electrode shows obviously stronger absorption without any shoulder and its absorption edge is red-shifted to about 690 nm. As a result, with the optimized QD-sensitizer, the energy band of QDs was effectively adjusted and a higher photocurrent density of QDSSCs could be expected with the cascade electrode TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2).

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of QDSSCs based on these QD sensitized electrodes were characterized under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and results are presented in Fig. 5; their photovoltaic performance is summarised in Table 2. The results indicated that the devices based on TiO2/CdS(4) and TiO2/CdSe(4) electrodes show low power conversion efficiencies of 0.52% and 0.17%, respectively. However, the cascade QDSSC based on the TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) electrode shows a power conversion efficiency of 1.76%, which is higher than those of TiO2/CdS(4) and TiO2/CdSe(4). This result proved that the cascade cosensitization can improve the power conversion efficiency effectively. This improvement could be attributed to the broader absorption of the sensitized TiO2 electrode after being cosensitized successively with two kinds of QDs. Interested, the single QD-sensitized device with the optimized tunable energy band CdSexS(1−x)(12) exhibited higher photovoltaic parameters (Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.41 V, FF = 0.60 and η = 2.27%) than those of the cascade QDSSC based on a TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) electrode (Jsc = 8.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.37 V, FF = 0.55 and η = 1.76%), which indicated that the performance of QDSSCs could be improved by the tunable energy band QDs. However, after being treated with CdSe twice, the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) electrode based QDSSC was further improved (Jsc = 12.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.44 V, FF = 0.59 and η = 3.17%). After being coated with a CdSe layer on the optimized tunable energy band CdSexS(1−x)(12) layer, the device exhibits more effective absorption and reduced recombination, resulting in the improvement of the performance of the QDSSC. In fact, Lee et al.24 also reported that the reorganization of energy levels between CdS and CdSe could form a stepwise structure of band edge levels (TiO2 < CdS < CdSe) and should be advantageous for the electron injection and hole-recovery of CdS and CdSe QDs. As a result, the cascade QDSSC with a TiO2/CdS/CdSe electrode showed much higher efficiency than that with TiO2/CdSe/CdS. Moreover, the conduction band energies of CdS and CdSe in neutral solutions are −0.8 and −0.6 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.25 When in contact with sulfide, these conduction bands shift to −1.0 and −1.2 V (vs NHE), respectively,26 indicating that CdSe QDs may have a higher conduction band than that of CdS QDs when in contact with sulfide. These results indicated that the type of the QD-sensitizer is very important in determining the performance of QDSSCs, since this QD-sensitizer is corresponding to the different energy levele and could be tunable by the ratio of atoms.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is defined as the ratio of collected electrons to incident photons. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent action spectra of the QDSSCs based on TiO2/CdS(4), TiO2/CdSe(4), TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4), TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) and TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2). It could be found that the QDSSCs based on single QD sensitized electrodes of TiO2/CdS(4) and TiO2/CdSe(4) present IPCE peak values of 34% at 450 nm and 19% at 400 nm, respectively. The IPCE curve of the TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) based QDSSC exhibits a broad spectrum with a maximum value of 39% at 480 nm, which is higher than those of TiO2/CdS(4) and TiO2/CdSe(4). However, the IPCE curve of the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) based QDSSC shows a higher value of 45% at 550 nm, which is broader and higher than that of the TiO2/CdS(3)/CdSe(4) based QDSSC. After being coated with CdSe, the IPCE curve of the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) based QDSSC exhibits a shoulder with a higher peak value of 50% at 560 nm and a red-shift to 725nm, promising higher light harvest ability and higher photocurrent density. These results are consistent with the J–V curves and the absorption spectra.

In order to investigate the interfacial difference between TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) and TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2), the interfacial recombination is characterized with EIS under dark conditions and an applied bias of their corresponding Voc. Fig. 7 presents the typical Nyquist plots of the QDSSCs based on TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) and TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2). Their charge transfer resistance (Rct) values, which relate to the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the electrolyte and can be described by the semicircle in the middle frequency region of the Nyquist plot,27 are evaluated by fitting the spectrum with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 7. Values of Rct of 284 Ω for the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) based QDSSC and 671 Ω for the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) based QDSSC were obtained, suggesting that a higher electron transfer resistance and a lower back reaction occurs at the TiO2/electrolyte interface after being treated with a CdSe layer on the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12) electrode. As a result, better photovoltaic performance can be achieved for the TiO2/CdSexS(1−x)(12)/CdSe(2) based QDSSC. This result agrees well with the IPCE and J–V curves.

Conclusions
A CdSexS(1−x) QDs-sensitized TiO2 electrode with tunable energy band and high light absorption was developed for QDSSCs. The results indicated that the CdSexS(1−x) QDSSCs outperformed single CdS, CdSe QDSSCs and cascade CdS/CdSe QDSSCs due to the appropriate energy band and broader light absorption. After being treated with CdSe onto a CdSexS(1−x) QDs-sensitized TiO2 electrode, its energy conversion efficiency increased by 40% compared with that of the initial CdSexS(1−x) QDSSC and by 80% compared with that of the CdS/CdSe QDSSC. The results of EIS and IPCE indicated that this improvement could be attributed to the enhanced absorption and the decreased back reaction occurring at the TiO2/electrolyte interface in the QDSSC. Further investigation into the tunable energy band QDs with a range of atoms and ratios could be expected to improve the performance of QDSSCs.
