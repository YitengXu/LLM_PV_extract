    , Accepted 17th May 2016First published on 17th May 2016AbstractThiocyanate ammonium (NH4SCN) is introduced into the fabrication of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) films through one-step spin-coating. The promoted formation of black trigonal phase α-FAPbI3 with better crystallinity has been observed after the addition of NH4SCN, together with the supression of the formation of yellow hexagonal phase δ-FAPbI3. Planar perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) based on NH4SCN-assisted formed α-FAPbI3 films with high quality present a highest power conversion efficiency of 11.44% when 30 mol% NH4SCN is applied. Notably, the addition of NH4SCN is found to enhance the moisture stability of the perovskite. As a result, the planar PVSCs with 30 mol% NH4SCN additive show improved stability under ambient conditions (RH: 30–40%) over those based on pristine FAPbI3. NH4SCN simultaneously enhances the efficiency and moisture stability of FAPbI3 based PVSCs through a single one-step solution method, facilitating their commercial fabrication and application.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have recently drawn much attention because of their surge in power conversion efficiency (PCE), rising from 3.8% to 21.0% in a few years.1–5 To date, efficient PVSCs have been reported mainly based on CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3).6–8 However, MAPbI3 perovskite is known to have a tetragonal to cubic phase transition around 55 °C, which is likely to have adverse effects on the thermal stability of the related perovskite solar cells.9–11 In addition, MAPbI3 undergoes light and thermal degradation, especially in the presence of humidity or solvents.12–16 Recently, the formamidinium cation (HC(NH2)2+ hereafter FA) was applied to replace MA to construct hybrid perovskites. It is reported that the FAPbI3 perovskite has higher thermal and photostability than MAPbI3, which makes it suitable for long-time operation stability.17–19
Although FAPbI3 perovskite does not undergo a phase transition between 25 and 150 °C, the coexistence of black trigonal phase α-FAPbI3 and yellow hexagonal phase δ-FAPbI3 hindered the performance improvement of FAPbI3 based solar cells.20,21 Methods including additives, two-step spin-coating and solvent engineering were established to control the phase structure and morphology of the FAPbI3 film with much better device performance.4,22 From a fabrication point of view, the one-step spin-coating method is attractive because of the low cost and simple processing. However, the FAPbI3 perovskite film obtained from the single one-step solution method is usually composed of both α-FAPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3 due to the inherent structural instability of FAPbI3.23 To solve this problem, material design for improving the intrinsic stability of FA-based perovskite materials is also vital to repress the formation of δ-FAPbI3, which might in turn facilitate the easier fabrication of FA-based perovskite films with high quality.
On the other hand, the black α-FAPbI3 was observed to convert into the yellow δ-FAPbI3 in a humid atmosphere.23 Component substitution was attempted to stabilize the black α-FAPbI3. For example, incorporation of 15 mol% MAPbBr3 resulted in stabilization of black α-FAPbI3 along with enhanced PCE.24 The Park group replaced 10% of FA with Cs+ ions to get the perovskite FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 with better moisture stability than FAPbI3.25 In the efforts of improving the moisture stability of lead based perovskites, the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) was proved to be a good replacement for iodide in MAPbI3, resulting in the perovskite material CH3NH3Pb(SCN)2I with higher moisture stability because of the stronger interaction between SCN and Pb ions.26 Chen et al. demonstrated that CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x with 5 wt% Pb(SCN)2 is more reproducible and stable than MAPbI3.27
Based on the fact that incorporation of SCN− could improve the moisture stability of CH3NH3PbI3, herein, SCN− was first introduced into the FAPbI3 system by mixing ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) with the precursor solution, expecting the improved moisture stability of the FAPbI3 film and the corresponding PVSCs as well. A highest PCE of 11.44% was obtained through a conventional one-step spin-coating method when 30 mol% NH4SCN was added. Notably, SCN− is found to promote the formation of black α-FAPbI3 and suppress the formation of δ-FAPbI3. The planar PVSCs with the NH4SCN additive show much better stability than those based on pristine FAPbI3 due to the enhanced moisture stability of the perovskite with SCN−.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the full X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films on compact TiO2. The perovskite films were prepared by single one-step spin-coating with NH4SCN as the additive in a molar ratio of 0, 10%, 30%, 60% and 80% to PbI2. In the case of no NH4SCN additive, the pristine FAPbI3 shows characteristic diffraction peaks for both α-FAPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3, which is similar to those prepared by the one-step solution method.22 The peaks at 11.8° and 22.4° belong to the δ-FAPbI3 and the others at 13.9°, 19.8°, 24.3°, 28.1°, 31.5°, 34.7°, 40.2° and 42.8° can be assigned to the (111), (012), (021), (222), (123), (030), (024), and (333) lattice planes of α-FAPbI3.28 When NH4SCN is added, the formation of δ-FAPbI3 was suppressed. The peaks of δ-FAPbI3 gradually disappear as the content of NH4SCN increases. Intriguingly, the intensity of the (111) peak for α-FAPbI3 is dramatically enhanced with smaller full width of half maximum (FWHM) for the films with the NH4SCN additive. At high NH4SCN concentration, only diffraction peaks of α-FAPbI3 can be observed, indicating that the formation of α-FAPbI3 is promoted by the NH4SCN additive. Thiocyanate, named pseudohalogen, has a similar radius and properties to iodide. Partial substitution of iodide with SCN− in the MAPbI3 system was reported to form a more stable perovskite, MAPb(SCN)2I.26 However, in this study, no new peaks were detected with the NH4SCN additive, suggesting that NH4SCN does not change the structure of FAPbI3 significantly. The result is similar to the previous reports for the MAPbI3 system, which suggested that most of the SCN− would evaporate during annealing and three dimensional MAPbI3−x(SCN)x would be obtained.29,30 Some other reports proposed that layered MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 would be formed rather than three dimensional MAPbI3−x(SCN)x, whose XRD patterns are quite different from ours.31,32

To make sure whether NH4SCN acts as a volatile additive, we tested the Fourier transform infrared spectra of perovskite materials with and without NH4SCN (Fig. S1†). The infrared spectrum has no sign of SCN− absorption for pristine FAPbI3, while those with NH4SCN show obvious existence of SCN−, signifying the incorporation of SCN− into the FAPbI3 film. Due to the similarity of XRD patterns with and without the NH4SCN additive, we propose that most of the NH4SCN has evaporated during the annealing process and the remaining SCN is likely to exist on the boundary and surface of FAPbI3 crystals. Some other additives, including HI, NH4Cl, MACl and FACl, have also been reported, among which HI and FACl are also helpful to get pure α-FAPbI3.18,33 Unlike these fully volatile additives along with easily evaporated anions, some SCN− from the NH4SCN additive in our case still remains in the FAPbI3 film after annealing, which may be ascribed to the strong interaction between Pb2+ and SCN−.
To gain further insight into the influence of SCN−, the absorption spectra were tested using an integrating sphere. As shown in Fig. 1b, the perovskite film prepared with 10 mol% NH4SCN additive shows a higher absorption in the range of 600–800 nm, but a lower absorption in shorter wavelength compared with FAPbI3. When the content of NH4SCN increases to 30 mol%, the perovskite film shows absorption enhancement in the full visible range. With more NH4SCN, the absorption patterns are similar to those of 30 mol% with a lower absorption intensity in the full spectrum, which might be attributed to the lower coverage of perovskite films.34
As we know, the uniformity of perovskite films is a significant requisite for high performance planar PVSCs.35–37 Thus, we then study the impact of the NH4SCN additive on the morphology of FAPbI3 perovskite films. Fig. 2 presents the surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of FAPbI3 perovskite films with different contents of NH4SCN on compact TiO2. We find that FAPbI3 tends to form radial needle-shaped crystals (Fig. 2a), while the films with SCN− are inclined to form perovskite grains and the grain size gradually becomes larger as the content of NH4SCN increases, which is consistent with their decreasing FWHM of XRD peaks. With 10 mol% NH4SCN, the film still has a rough surface with a near 100% coverage and small grain size (Fig. 2b). When NH4SCN increases to 30 mol%, the film has a much bigger grain size and smoother surface with some small pinholes (Fig. 2c). However, the micron-sized grains would separate from each other as SCN− further increases, accompanied by larger pinholes, which are harmful to the device performance.

The devices fabricated from pristine FAPbI3 exhibit considerably lower performance with a PCE of 5.94% (PCEavg = 4.46% based on 12 devices), which is similar to the previously reported PCE for FAPbI3-based PVSCs with a similar device structure using the single one-step spin-coating method.38 The PCE is improved to 11.44% (PCEavg = 10.18% based on 22 devices) when the content of NH4SCN is increased to 30%, due to the improvement of FF and Voc. However, all photovoltaic parameters, as well as PCE, gradually decrease by further increasing the content of SCN−, which is predictable from the weaker light absorption (Fig. 1b) and the poor film morphology with larger pinholes (Fig. 2).
The improved photovoltaic performance of PVSCs with 30% SCN− is mainly attributed to the better morphology of the films prepared with 30 mol% NH4SCN additive (hereafter, 3S-FAPbI3). As shown in Fig. 2, 3S-FAPbI3 has a much larger grain size and smoother surface, which is much better than the pristine FAPbI3. As such, the grain boundary area of the 3S-FAPbI3 film would be remarkably reduced, depressing the charge recombination in the perovskite films.39Fig. 3e and f show the cross-sectional SEM images of FAPbI3 and 3S-FAPbI3 films on compact TiO2. The 3S-FAPbI3 film forms larger and thicker crystals than pristine FAPbI3, which would effectively block the contact of electron transport layer TiO2 and hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in a higher Voc due to less recombination, as well as an improved FF. Thus, the PVSCs based on 3S-FAPbI3 show much better performance than those based on pristine FAPbI3. The superiority of 3S-FAPbI3 over FAPbI3 is further corroborated by comparing the photovoltaic performance of more devices of perovskite solar cells employing 3S-FAPbI3 over pristine FAPbI3 in Fig. 3d. The PVSCs based on 3S-FAPbI3 show 128% higher average PCE than pristine FAPbI3.
To investigate the influence of SCN− on the stability of the perovskite film, the moisture stability of pristine FAPbI3 and 3S-FAPbI3 was tested. As shown in Fig. 4, the whole FAPbI3 film changes from black to yellow uniformly, while 3S-FAPbI3 still remains black after storing in a constant humidity and temperature chamber (RH ≈ 85%, T = 20 °C) under dark conditions for 2 h, implying the higher moisture stability of 3S-FAPbI3 than that of pristine FAPbI3. We propose that the better moisture stability of 3S-FAPbI3 is ascribed to the introduction of SCN−, which suppresses the formation of yellow phase FAPbI3. Furthermore, the strong interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ ions may also contribute to the stability of the 3S-FAPbI3.29 Since 3S-FAPbI3 shows better moisture stability than FAPbI3, the solar cells based on 3S-FAPbI3 are possibly more stable than those based on FAPbI3. Fig. 4e shows the PCE curve as a function of time, where the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI3 and 3S-FAPbI3 was measured under continuous light illumination (AM1.5 global solar light at 100 mW cm−2) without encapsulation under ambient conditions (RH: 30–40%). As displayed in Fig. 4e, the device based on 3S-FAPbI3 shows much better stability than the pristine FAPbI3 device. The PCE of the pristine FAPbI3 device is degraded by 92% after 20 min, whereas the 3S-FAPbI3 device shows 13% degradation even after 1 h. The enhanced device stability under ambient conditions is possibly ascribed to the protection of SCN− ions and the better intrinsic stability of 3S-FAPbI3 against light and humidity.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) was first introduced into the FAPbI3 system and helps to improve the performance of planar PVSCs fabricated by the single one-step solution method. Compared to pristine FAPbI3, the perovskite film with the SCN− additive forms black α-FAPbI3 rather than yellow δ-FAPbI3. In the case of 30% SCN− addition, the perovskite shows a larger absorption range, enhanced crystallinity and larger grain size. The corresponding planar PVSCs with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/MoO3/Ag present a highest PCE of 11.44%. Besides, NH4SCN is found to enhance the moisture stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite, which can be attributed to the suppression of the formation of the yellow δ-FAPbI3. Consequently, the planar PVSCs based on 3S-FAPbI3 show much better stability than those based on pristine FAPbI3. Our work proves that introduction of the NH4SCN additive is a good strategy for developing FA-based perovskite with better performance and higher stability through the single one-step solution method.
Experimental
Materials
Patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were obtained through etching using zinc powder and hydrochloride acid. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99% purity) was purchased from Shanghai Materwin. Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, 99% purity) was bought from Merck. Other materials, including titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TDBA, 99.8% purity), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 99% purity), lithium–bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li–TFSI, 99% purity) and thiocyanate ammonium (NH4SCN, 99.99% purity), were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials are used without further purification.
Solar cell fabrication
A patterned FTO glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water and isopropanol successively before use. A compact TiO2 layer about 90 nm was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin-coating 0.3 M 1-butanol solution of TDBA after UV-ozone treatment of the FTO substrate. After coating, the substrate was dried on a hot plate at 125 °C for 5 min, and finally annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Equal molar FAI and PbI2 were mixed in DMF and stirred for 2 h to form a 1.0 M precursor solution. The perovskite FAPbI3 was deposited onto TiO2/FTO by spin-coating the precursor solution at 2500 rpm for 40 s before annealing on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min. For the perovskite with SCN, an appropriate amount of NH4SCN was added into the FAPbI3 precursor solution and stirred for 2 h before use. The thickness of the perovskite without the additive and with 30 mol% NH4SCN is 400 nm and 480 nm, respectively. The spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer solution was prepared by dissolving 72.5 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL tBP and 17.5 μL Li–TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 40 s and the thickness is 180 nm. Finally, a 10 nm MoO3 layer and 100 nm silver layer were deposited via thermal evaporation. TiO2 was prepared under ambient conditions and other device fabrication steps were carried out in a N2-purged glovebox.
Characterization

X-ray diffraction. 
Crystallographic properties of the perovskite films on TiO2/FTO substrates were investigated on a Rigaku UltimaIV X-ray diffractometer at room temperature using graphite monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 nm) with a scanning rate of 5 deg per min over the Bragg angle range of 10.0–50.0°.


UV-vis spectra. 
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite deposited on TiO2/FTO substrates were recorded on a UV-2450 UV-vis Shimadzu Spectrophotometer with the signal of the TiO2/FTO substrate as calibration background.


Scanning electron microscope. 
Morphologies of the perovskite films on TiO2/FTO substrates were studied through SEM images obtained on an S-4800 (Hitachi) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with a high tension of 3.0 kV and magnification of 3.0k.


Moisture stability test. 
FAPbI3 and 3S-FAPbI3 films were stored in a constant humidity and temperature chamber under dark conditions for 2 h, in which humidity and temperature were controlled to be RH 85% and 20 °C, respectively.
