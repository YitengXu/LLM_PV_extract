    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 26th February 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have improved at an unprecedented rate, reaching over 22% power conversion efficiency in less than a decade, and have generated a wealth of high impact work in the literature studying the properties of these unique materials. While the highest performance and best progress have been observed with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites, their low tolerance to moisture and rapid degradation when exposed to UV light and high temperatures have posed a major setback to their commercialization. Recently, mixed halide hybrid perovskites (MHHPs) where I− is substituted with Br− and Cl− have driven a paradigm shift in PSCs, synergistically combining high performance with high ambient stability. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the progress made in the past 5 years in methylammonium-based organic–inorganic MHHPs and cesium-based all inorganic MHHPs. We discuss the fabrication approaches for halide substitution and the resulting crystal structure, long-term stability and durability, and device performance. Unique from other reviews, we focus this review on the optical properties of MHHPs, including light-induced phase segregation and alterations in the optical band gap and photoluminescence with halide substitution. We also summarize trends in carrier dynamics, including carrier thermalization, recombination, and charge transfer probed with time-resolved optical spectroscopies. Furthermore, we provide a short overview on mixed cation hybrid perovskites, where methylammonium is substituted with formamidinium/cesium or Pb is substituted with less toxic and benign metals to improve both the stability and the environmental impact of PSCs. We discuss the optical characteristics of mixed cation perovskites and approaches to lower nonradiative recombination with cation substitution. We conclude this review with a discussion on innovative future directions that will propel research on MHHPs as a game changer in perovskite-based optoelectronics.
1. Introduction and background
Organolead halide based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed an extraordinary rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE), from 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 1) to >22% in 2017 (ref. 2–7), reaching close to their theoretically predicted efficiency of 27%.8 The ease of solution processing and straightforward fabrication approaches have enabled both solid-state and flexible PSCs amenable to scalable manufacturing processes. Perovskites, discovered by Gustav Rose and bearing the name of Russian mineralogist Lev Perovksi, have an ABX3 crystal structure, where the halogen atoms (X = Cl, Br, I) occupy the vertices of an octahedron and the divalent metal atoms (B = Pb, Sn) lie at the centers of the octahedra.9–12 The cavity formed by neighboring octahedra enclose the monovalent cation (A = MA, Cs) as depicted in Fig. 1A. The highest reported efficiencies in PSCs have largely been achieved with methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites (MAPbI3), attributable to their broadband light absorption in thin films <1 μm (Fig. 1B), highly efficient ambipolar charge transport, and rapid charge extraction rates.13–15 While the small bandgap of MAPbI3 (1.5 eV) is advantageous for achieving high current density, photon energy surpassing the band gap is lost, resulting in a relatively low open circuit voltage (Voc ∼ 0.85 V). Alternatively, bromide-based MAPbBr3 perovskites have also piqued tremendous interest in their use in PVs due to their high Voc (∼1.2–1.5 V) enabled by a large 2.2 eV bandgap, good charge transport facilitated by their long exciton diffusion length (>1.2 μm), and long-term stability.16,17 But poor light absorption beyond the ∼550 nm band edge has limited device efficiencies to <10%.18–23 The Cl based perovskites, MAPbCl3, have thus far been unusable in solar devices due to their large bandgap (3.1 eV), which hinders light absorption beyond the UV.24–26 However, they have a lower valence band energy level than their iodide- and bromide-based counterparts (Fig. 1C) enabling longer carrier lifetimes and fast carrier transport.27 A recent study by Kumawat et al. demonstrated that halide-controlled bandgap variations in perovskites result from hybridization between Pb 6p and halide p orbitals, where smaller halides are more tightly bound and form a tighter cage around the cation, reducing the polarizability of the perovskite. The reduced polarizability results in lower light absorption and a subsequently higher band gap.28 Because electronic contributions from the cation in perovskites occur far below the valence band maximum, cations have minimal contribution to the bandgap but are primarily responsible for maintaining charge neutrality and structural stability.29,30 In addition to the bandgap, variations in the crystal structure of perovskites determine their overall stability and device longevity. MAPbI3 possesses a tetragonal structure (Fig. 1A), which is inherently unstable and contributes to its rapid degradation under ambient conditions.31–35 When exposed to moisture, UV-light, and heat, MAPbI3 reorganizes from a black α-phase to a yellow δ-phase which has poor photovoltaic performance36–39 and also results in harmful byproducts such as HI and PbI2.40 Despite complex encapsulation techniques41–45 and application of UV filters,46,47 the stability of MAPbI3 currently poses a major barrier to commercialization for utility-scale solar power. In contrast, MAPbBr3 acquires a pseudocubic crystal structure due to the smaller size of Br, which provides air and moisture stability and long term durability.4,18,48,49

To overcome the challenges with MAPbI3 while sustaining the merits of Br- and Cl-based perovskites, mixed halide hybrid perovskites (MHHPs) have recently emerged as a game changer in PSCs. One example of MHHPs is MAPbI3−x(Br/Cl)x where the stoichiometric substitution of Br and Cl ions in the MAPbI3 perovskite lattice induces a change in the lattice parameter, giving rise to substantial improvements in the structural stability.48 MHHPs have driven a paradigm shift in both light harvesting50–53 and light emitting technologies54–59 facilitated by the straightforward solution-processed fabrication procedure, highly tunable bandgaps from 1.5 to 2.7 eV, and long-term stability while maintaining the near-complete light absorption properties of MAPbI3. By controlling the ratio of halide ions in MHHPs, a favorable position of the valence and conduction bands has been achieved, which has leveraged both planar and mesoporous PSCs with a number of compatible electron- and hole-transport materials (Fig. 1C).60–62 While record device efficiencies with MHHPs have been achieved with the mesoporous architecture,4,53,63,64 the planar geometry is more suitable for tandem devices, flexible PVs,3,60,65–68 and for integration applications such as those used in building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems.69–71 In this review article, we highlight the progress reported in the literature in the past five years in MHHPs that has enabled them to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and high ambient stability for next-generation PVs. We provide a detailed overview of both methylammonium- and cesium-based MHHPs, including their synthesis, device fabrication processes, and solar cell performance. Distinct from other reviews on this topic,72,73 we focus our article on the optical properties of MHHPs and highlight the studies on time-resolved optical spectroscopies to understand the fundamental underpinnings that drive high efficiency in MHHPs. Furthermore, we also briefly summarize the synthesis, device performance, and optical properties of mixed cation hybrid perovskites where both cation site A and site B are substituted with other ions, generating improved optoelectronic quality, minimized defect trapping, and long carrier lifetimes. Finally, we conclude this review with challenges and a roadmap forward for hybrid perovskites.
2. Fabrication, crystallographic properties, and device performance of mixed halide hybrid perovskites
The structure, composition, film morphology, and resulting device performance of methylammonium-based MHHPs are strongly correlated with the synthesis approach and deposition route.74–76 The deposition of perovskites, whether on planar surfaces or into mesoporous layers, has been achieved with both solution-phase and vapor/vacuum-assisted routes where the organic and metal halide precursors were deposited either simultaneously or sequentially.17,18,74,77–80 The most straightforward and cost-effective deposition route involves one-step spin casting from solution, as illustrated in Fig. 2A(i), albeit at the expense of incomplete coverage, defects and pinholes.81,82 Alternatively, to achieve pin-hole free large grain size films, a heated air flow has been introduced during the spin casting process (Fig. 2A(ii)) which rapidly evaporates the solvent giving rise to uniform films and high device performance.82 In this section, we summarize literature findings of the strategies that have been adopted for Br and Cl inclusion into the perovskite lattice for both mesoscopic and planar architectures to achieve controlled crystallization and an optimal film morphology, and summarize the impact of these deposition techniques on the crystallographic properties, long term durability, and device performance of MHHPs.

2a. MHHPs with bromine inclusion
MHHPs of the molecular formula MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 have been successfully achieved over the complete range of x = 0 to 1 via substitution of Br ions into the MAPbI3 lattice by simply tuning the ratio of halide precursors.48,84–86 The ease of substitution is enabled by one-step solution-phase spin cast deposition from a controlled mixture of MAX and PbX2 (X = I, Br) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).87,88 However, the atomic radius of Br− (1.96 Å) is slightly smaller than that of I− (2.20 Å) resulting in a higher diffusivity of Br− in solvent and dominating the growth kinetics of MHHP films.89,90 During the synthesis of MHHPs from precursors in solution, Pb2+ complexes with electron-donating solvents and with halide ions to form halide–plumbate complexes with 2-fold or 3-fold coordination. This complex further reacts with MA+ and, upon solvent evaporation, this larger complex crystallizes into MAPbX3 where the halide identity impacts the crystal growth.91 A recent study by Kamat and co-workers determined that Br− is the dominant binding species in MHHPs, as its complexation with Pb2+ is 7× greater than that of Pb2+ with I−.92 This implies that Br/I ratios in the precursor solutions have to be carefully modulated to facilitate the uniform spatial distribution of both halides with desired crystal structures.
Xu et al. also investigated the role of Br− during the crystallization and formation of MHHPs.93 While in the absence of Br− ions, PbI2 crystallized in the hexagonal phase with a prominent (001) diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.6°, in mixed halide Pb(I/Br)2 with high bromide content, Br− complexed with Pb2+ and distorted the hexagonal structure. This was confirmed with XRD which showed the absence of the (001) diffraction peak, and spectrophotometry, which showed the absence of the 515 nm band edge of pure PbI2. When exposed to MAI vapor, these Pb(I/Br)2 films with excess Br− surprisingly produced MAPbI3 with only trace amounts of Br, as I− from the vapor displaced most of the Br. This displacement reaction and the subsequent formation of MAPbI3 are strongly correlated with the initial lead halide films where pure PbI2 films rapidly convert to MAPbI3; the reaction is slower for PbIBr and slowest for PbBr2. The findings of this study support that, in the presence of excess Br (>30%), bromide–plumbate complexes are strongly coordinated and can retard the crystal growth of MHHPs. However, at well-controlled Br concentrations in the MAPbI3 lattice, the crystal structure is stabilized, improving the long-term durability of MHHPs. The improved stability is attributable to the smaller ionic radius of Br− compared to I−, which transforms the tetragonal phase I4/mcm symmetry of MAPbI3 into the Pmm cubic phase.48,87,94,95 This has been directly observed in XRD (Fig. 2B) where for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 at x = 0, the (004) and (220) diffraction peaks are indicative of the tetragonal phase and ultimately merge into the (200) peak indicating the cubic phase at x = 0.2.48,96 By examining the linear trends in the lattice parameter as a function of x, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 has been shown to follow Vegard's law during its phase transition from tetragonal to cubic.48 The phase change from tetragonal to cubic accompanies the high ambient stability of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 PSCs as shown in Fig. 2C, where the devices with x = 0.2 and 0.29 Br content maintained their high efficiency, whereas PSCs with x = 0 and 0.06 Br rapidly degraded when humidity was raised to 55% and subsequently lowered to 35% a day later.48 These findings have been supported by other recent work as well.97–99
In addition to improving the stability of MHHPs, Br substitution also aids in enhancing the device efficiencies. Noh et al. adopted a one-step deposition process where the perovskites were infiltrated in TiO2 mesopores with compact TiO2 as an electron-conductor and polytriarylamine as a hole-conductor and showed a PCE of 12.3% (Fig. 2D) between x = 0.06 and 0.2 in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3.48 However, from x = 0.29 to 1, the PCE sharply decreases due to a decline in Jsc from 18 to 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2E). While the current density is compromised, higher Br substitution improves the Voc from 0.87 to 1.13 V, attributable to the larger bandgap of Br-containing MHHPs. Notably, at low values of x, the increase in Voc offsets the decrease in Jsc, resulting in relatively constant efficiencies. These results have been further validated via simulations,100 indicating that ≤20% Br content is ideal to effectively balance high efficiency and high stability. Conversely, Cao et al. observed improved performance at ∼33.3% Br substitution in devices with a triple layer mesoscopic architecture consisting of TiO2/Al2O3/carbon, where perovskite layers (MAPbI2Br and MAPbI3) were utilized as both the light absorber and the hole conductor. MAPbI2Br resulted in a higher PCE (11.03% vs. 10.51% for MAPbI3) driven by increases in Voc (1.04 V vs. 0.904 V) and FF (0.69 vs. 0.67).97 Interestingly, they also observed near negligible hysteresis and an increase in IPCE in MAPbI2Br, which they attributed to the high absorption coefficient in the visible region and long carrier lifetime in the MHHPs.
In addition to the conventional one-step processing, other techniques such as multi-step deposition, vapor phase, direct contact, and halide exchange post-MAPbI3 fabrication processes have also been thoroughly investigated. Notably, as reproducibility in spatial distribution of Br ions in MHHP films remains a challenge, Cui et al. used a direct contact and intercalation technique to fabricate high-quality thin MAPbI3−xBrx films on compact TiO2 which resulted in controlled halide compositions, large grain sizes, small surface roughness, and high reproducibility.85 In their approach, the PbBrxI2−x precursor solution was spin-cast on substrates immediately followed by placing the substrates face down in MABr or MAI powder preheated to 150 °C in order to form MHHPs within 15 min. In another approach, Kim et al. demonstrated halide exchange post-MAPbI3 synthesis enabling the use of precursors necessary for low-temperature processing, which is currently not achievable with MABr. They exposed a MAPbI3/TiO2 mesoporous layer to vapor phase HBr in acetic acid (Fig. 2F) and used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements to confirm halide exchange. ToF-SIMS showed that a temporary halide gradient ultimately results in ion migration and diffusion to create a homogenous Br distribution, resulting in devices with 18.9% PCE.83Table 1 summarizes a number of these synthesis approaches and solar cell performances resulting from these approaches.

2b. MHHPs with chlorine inclusion
Chlorine inclusion in the perovskite lattice has also gained significant interest to achieve bandgap tunability and band alignment with charge transport layers. Cl substitution in MAPbI3, MAPb(I1−xClx)3, is typically achieved by spin casting a 1:3 molar mixture of PbCl2 and MAI in DMF followed by an annealing step.103–106 MHHPs with Cl inclusion have been achieved with one-step deposition, where the precursor concentration, solvent, annealing temperature and duration, and other fabrication conditions such as the spin-casting speed and time are all critical to achieving high quality and highly reproducible films.105,107,108 While these parameters have been carefully controlled, the large difference in the atomic radii of Cl− and I− anions results in low ionic miscibility and hinders Cl substitution into the MAPbI3 lattice.51,109–111 The initial temperature of the precursor solution and the temperature and duration of annealing both play a key role for improved Cl substitution, as this thermal energy governs the rate of solvent removal from films and the resulting crystallization rate and surface coverage of Cl.105–108,112–115 However, sublimation of MACl during the annealing process results in a substantial loss of Cl content in MHHP films,112,113,116,117 with successful inclusion of only 1–5%.105,118 In particular, Tidhar et al. visualized MACl vaporizing from MA(I1−xClx)3via in situ air SEM to support this theory.119 Yu et al. demonstrated with XRD that during early phases of crystallization, MAPbCl3 (2θ = 15.5°) is formed, which ultimately decomposes as Cl ions vaporize and PbI2 (2θ = 12.6°) remains in the films.116 In a unique study, Ralaiarisoa et al. recently investigated the composition of MAPbI3−xClx in 3D before, during, and after annealing with laterally resolved ToF-SIMS, showing that Cl ions not only vaporize from the MHHPs but also diffuse and accumulate at the interface of the conducting polymer substrate,106 which corroborates with earlier reports that indicate higher Cl content at metal oxide interfaces.110,120 The rapid sublimation of MACl can either improve the stability,94 or retard the crystal growth of MHHPs.95,119,121–123 Even with minimal Cl inclusion in MAPb(I1−xClx)3 MHHPs, an intermediate Cl-rich phase is formed during the crystallization process which improves the crystal structure.106,111,124,125 Hwang et al. combined MAI with PbCl2 and tracked the extinction of PbI3− at 370 nm and PbI42− at 425 nm.126 The extinction intensity of both compounds increased with the concentration of PbCl2 suggesting an anion exchange between PbCl2 and MAI, which results in iodoplumbate compounds, and Cl− further complexes with these compounds. The small ionic radius of Cl− (1.81 Å) also results in improved ambient stability with minimal change in the crystal structure of MAPbBr3−xClx MHHPS for up to 30 days under ambient conditions.127
The crystallographic properties of MAPb(I1−xClx)3 MHHP films result from the fabrication approaches. Song et al. demonstrated that a heated air flow during the spin casting process (Fig. 2A(ii)) achieves pin-hole free large grain size films yielding planar devices with 17.6% PCE.82 In another study, Nie et al. reported a hot casting technique using a heated precursor solution spin-cast onto substrates at high temperatures, which generated highly uniform millimeter scale grains (Fig. 3A–C) and resulted in planar PSCs with efficiencies approaching 18%.101 A number of other fabrication techniques have also been reported, including dual source thermal evaporation,128 blade coating,129,130 and spray deposition among other techniques.50,131 A summary of these synthesis approaches and corresponding solar PCEs is provided in Table 1. The device performance of MHHPs with Cl incorporation is directly correlated with these fabrication techniques and the resulting Cl inclusion.118,132–135 Docampo et al. adopted a two-step deposition to fabricate planar Cl-substituted films with 0 to 15 wt% Cl in the soak solution.102 While post-annealing, though Cl vaporized from the MHHP films with minimal change in the lattice parameter between the different samples, PSC efficiencies demonstrated a strong dependence on Cl concentration (Fig. 3D and E). A 5 wt% Cl precursor in MAI and MABr resulted in efficiencies of 10.5% and 15.4%, respectively, exceeding the pure triiodide reference devices (5.5%). This improvement in device performance was correlated with improved light absorption at the band edge, longer carrier diffusion lengths, and decrease in series resistance (Rs). Huang and co-workers also studied the impact of Cl incorporation in inverted solar devices using a multicycle interdiffusion process.121 By controlling the stoichiometric ratio of MAI:MACl precursor deposited onto a layer of PbI2 with repeated deposition cycles, Cl− inclusion in MAPb(I1−xClx)3 films was tuned and a maximum device efficiency of 16.01% was achieved (Jsc = 20.71 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.97 V, and FF = 0.78). The reference triiodide device only achieved 13.41% efficiency (Jsc = 19.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V, and FF = 0.75), indicating that Cl improved all device parameters simultaneously, attributable to decreased carrier recombination.

2c. Multi-halide MHHPs with both Br and Cl inclusion
While MHHPs with both Cl− and Br− incorporated into the MAPbI3 lattice have not been widely studied, these ternary halide perovskites demonstrate exciting properties, including broadband light absorption, a large band gap, increased stability, improved carrier mobility, and an optimal crystal structure.136,137 The first PSCs with MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly were reported by Suarez et al., who studied both planar (compact TiO2) and mesoscopic (Al2O3 and TiO2) architectures where PbCl2 was mixed with either MABr or MAI in a 1:3 molar ratio and subsequently the ternary halide was achieved by stoichiometric mixing of Br- and I-based binary precursor solutions.138 The best performing MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly PSC, η = 12.5%, was achieved with an Al2O3 mesoporous scaffold with no Br inclusion. In a similar study, Liang et al. spin-cast a stoichiometric mixture of two binary precursors onto PEDOT:PSS and added 1 wt% of 1,8-diiodooctane to the precursor solutions to improve the rate of crystallization. With inverted planar devices, their ternary halide perovskites achieved >10.5% efficiencies but, interestingly, the best-performing PSCs did not have Br incorporation.104 However, Jeong et al. recently demonstrated that ternary MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly can outperform binary MHHPs achieving PCEs >16% specifically when <10% Br was included which resulted in homogeneous pin-hole free films.139
Analogous to binary halides, the role of Cl− in ternary halide MHHPs also remains controversial as it is unclear whether Cl content is reduced or completely sublimed post-annealing.95,140 Zhao et al. used energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis to confirm that even trace amounts of Cl− are undetected after 40 min of annealing at 125 °C.141 Notably they also found that optimal MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly films were obtained with a 1:1:1 molar ratio of PbI2:MABr:MACl; any increase in Cl precursor concentration resulted in the formation of pores in the films due to rapid sublimation of Cl. Similarly, Chiang et al. achieved >16% PCE with ternary halide planar and inverted devices and concluded that the presence of Cl in the perovskite layer was undetectable post annealing.27 Both of these studies performed multiple characterization techniques (XRD, EDX, and UV-vis). While Cl− rapidly sublimes, its presence is crucial in determining the crystal growth kinetics of ternary halide MHHPs. He et al. showed that NH4Cl acts as an excellent sacrificial agent to tune the formation kinetics of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3. Initially, Cl− inclusion is kinetically favored in the perovskite lattice but as the reaction progresses, Br− inclusion is thermodynamically favored, resulting in sublimation of Cl-based compounds and the retention of I and Br. Films annealed in a closed container showed crystallization over longer time scales in accordance with Le Chatlier's principle, which suggests that vaporized Cl content trapped in the confined space prevents further sublimation of Cl−.95 These studies suggest that the Cl ions impact the MHHP film crystallinity, morphology, and grain sizes, but any trace amounts remaining post annealing do not directly contribute to device efficiencies.
3. Optical and electrochemical spectroscopic analysis of MHHPs
3a. Steady-state photoluminescence properties
The tunable optical properties of MHHPs have driven significant innovations with this material, allowing straightforward manipulation of the band edge and photoluminescence (PL) and providing a route to optimize solar devices with the best performance. Both halide identity and halide ratios are important in determining the optical shifts in PL emissions of MHHPs. While the PL of MAPbI3 is centered at 770 nm (ref. 18 and 19) in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, the PL systematically blue shifts to lower wavelengths with increasing Br substitution, ultimately reaching 540 nm for pure MAPbBr3.86,94,98 PL blue shifts with Br substitution have also been correlated with the presence of defect centers in the perovskite lattice.94 In addition to shifts, increasing Br also increases the PL intensity, suggesting that nonradiative recombination is suppressed in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 layers. Ternary halide MHHPs show a similar blue shift in PL (Fig. 4A and B) although the presence of Cl in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3−yCly results in slightly redshifted PL relative to their binary halide system.94,159 This is likely attributed to slight modifications in the crystal structure of ternary halide MHHPs as discussed in Section 2. The optical bandgap of MHHPs is highly tunable (Fig. 4C), where Br inclusion from x = 0 to 1 in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3(Cl)y films shows color modulation from yellow (x = 1) to dark brown (x = 0); this color tunability is highly desirable for decorative niche applications and BIPVs.140 While pure triiodide perovskites absorb light throughout the UV, visible, and near-infrared regions, increasing Br substitution blue shifts the band edge (Fig. 4D) mirroring the trends of PL. The optical band edges are useful in determining the bandgap of MHHPs as shown in Fig. 4E for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3(Cl)y which shows a linear trend as a function of Br-fraction. The increase in the bandgap with rising Br content is attributed to structural distortion induced by stress and biaxial strain of Pb–I bonds as Br is substituted.94 The change in the bandgap has also been correlated with the hybridization of Br 4p orbitals with I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals, as well as the crystal structure transition from tetragonal to pseudocubic.98 The bandgap of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites is best described by the quadratic equation Eg(x) = Eg(MAPbI3) + [Eg(MAPbBr3) − Eg(MAPbI3) − b]x + b(x)2, where x is the Br composition and b is the bowing parameter.100,160 The bowing parameter is typically small, b = 0.30 to 0.34, indicating low compositional disorder and high miscibility between I and Br in MHHPs.86,160 Conversely, bandgap tuning with Cl inclusion is minimal and only increases from 1.54 eV to 1.59 eV.118

Our group recently demonstrated bandgap tunability and PL shifts in planar MHHP films where optical properties were strongly correlated with the grain structure resulting from the synthetic technique adopted to fabricate the films.49 In this work, planar MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.33 were fabricated with two different precursor solvents, DMF and a 3:7 by volume mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO):γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and deposited on compact TiO2. The precursor solvent had a strong impact on the average crystal size, where the strong complexation of DMSO with PbI2 resulted in nucleation in the precursor solution, and the larger nuclei promoted the formation of larger crystallites (∼200 nm). Since DMF does not coordinate strongly with lead halides, smaller nuclei were formed in solution which resulted in small grained (∼55 nm) perovskite films. This is evidenced in the PL spectra where DMF-based films (Fig. 5A) showed broadening and larger blueshifts with increasing Br substitution than DMSO:GBL-based films (Fig. 5B), suggesting a strong dependence on the crystal morphology. Notably we observed that the optical band edges of MHHPs obtained from both solvents were nearly identical (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, bandgaps calculated from absorbance and fluorescence peak positions as a function of Br content (Fig. 5D) did not overlap, but showed a large divergence for the DMF vs. DMSO:GBL films. We attributed this discrepancy in peak shifts to differences in the size of iodide-rich domains in the MHHPs, where DMF-spun perovskites have smaller iodide-rich recombination nuclei that have a wider fluorescence band gap, and DMSO:GBL spun perovskites have larger iodide-rich recombination cores with a narrower bandgap. These low-bandgap nuclei in DMSO:GBL-produced perovskites are minimally influenced by the bulk Br composition, and thus the PL peak positions more closely resemble the bandgap of MAPbI3.

(D) Bandgaps calculated from absorbance spectra compared to bandgaps calculated from fluorescence peak positions, showing a large divergence depending on the Br content and precursor solvent.

It is also notable that shifts in PL peak positions in MHHPs also represent light-induced phase segregation of the halide ions.161 However, this process is reversible and the original halide distribution can be mostly restored when the perovskite films are stored in the dark.162,163 Yang et al. described this photo-induced modification as the formation of temporary sub-bandgap states in MAPbI3−xBrx films followed by interaction of these states with more incident photons, generating metastable states.163 McGehee and co-workers demonstrated a similar phenomenon where photoexcitation of MHHPs resulted in halide segregation into iodide-rich minority and bromide-enriched majority domains, evidenced by shifts in XRD spectra and PL.162 They proposed that since the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 valence band has major contribution from the halide p orbitals, the formation of iodide-rich domains stabilizes holes, which likely drives halide segregation under illumination. In the dark, these trapped holes are filled, where entropy and lattice strain enable the phase segregated MHHPs to relax back to their original well-mixed state. While reversible, the generation of these metastable halide-segregated regions introduces recombination centers, decreasing Voc and Jsc, which will ultimately limit the performance of MHHP-based PSCs.
3b. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy
A comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental photophysics driving the carrier dynamics in MHHPs is critical to harnessing their full potential in high efficiency PSCs. Time-resolved spectroscopies, including time-resolved photoluminescence (trPL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), are powerful techniques that provide a mechanistic understanding of the excited-state processes initiated by light absorption in perovskites, including carrier generation, charge transport, and carrier recombination.164 TrPL has been extensively used to examine the timescales of radiative decay of excited species in photoactive materials and has been a cornerstone to providing insight into carrier transport in PSCs.49,148,149,154,165–167 In trPL, a picosecond light pulse initiates electronic excitation and generates electron hole pairs, which are generally free carriers in perovskites due to their relatively low exciton binding energy.102,150 Carriers recombine either radiatively emitting a photon or non-radiatively by Auger processes. In pristine perovskite films or those paired with passive scaffolds (such as Al2O3), high radiative decay rates indicate slow recombination and improved carrier diffusion lengths (LD) desirable for high performance devices. Perovskites paired with an electron- or hole-selective material often show shorter lifetimes, suggesting improved charge injection.155,158,168
In our recent work, we used trPL to study the radiative decay of pristine MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films deposited from precursors in DMF for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.33 (Fig. 6A).49 The decay rates were measured at the corresponding emission peak wavelengths for the different Br inclusion levels (see Fig. 5A). The average carrier lifetime (τavg), obtained from a biexponential fit to the decays, demonstrated a systematic increase with increasing Br content from 29 to 52 ns for x = 0 to 0.33, consistent with other reports,98,160 which has been attributed to improved carrier transport with Br inclusion.140,162 We compared the lifetimes of DMF-deposited MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films with those deposited from DMSO:GBL precursor solvent, and observed an order of magnitude decrease in lifetimes for the same Br content. These trends are attributable to the differences in the grain size and morphological evolution of films obtained from the two precursor solvents (see Section 3a for more details of this work). In another study by Zhou et al., Br-substituted MHHPs were combined with an n-type TiO2 compact layer and long radiative lifetimes were observed, indicating slow recombination and efficient carrier extraction.142

Carrier decay by Cl− incorporation in MHHP films has also been studied with trPL for x = 0 to 20 wt% Cl inclusion (Fig. 6B).102 Decay curves fit to a biexponential function showed that radiative recombination slowed with increasing Cl−, indicating an improvement in LD. These results have been further supported by similar findings observed by both Xie et al. and Jiang et al.,132,149 who calculated a rough estimation of LD ∼ 200 nm for x = 0 wt% (reference MAPbI3) and LD ∼ 800 nm for MAPb(I1−xClx)3. Surprisingly, trPL decay constants remained unchanged for Cl− concentrations >5 wt%, which supports our earlier discussion (see Section 2) that Cl− incorporation is capped at low concentrations as excess Cl− sublimes during annealing. Conversely, Liao et al. performed similar experiments on pristine MAPb(I1−xClx)3 films for x = 0 to 0.2 and observed long radiative lifetimes up to 10% Cl− inclusion, followed by a decrease in the carrier lifetime at 20% Cl− inclusion (Fig. 6C).150 This unusual trend was attributed to phase impurities from unreacted MAPbCl3 at high Cl concentrations which also contributed to a poor morphology and surface roughness. A recent study by Li et al. comparing trPL decays of pristine MAPb(I1−xClx)3 films in air vs. in a vacuum demonstrated that carrier localization, surface band bending, and trap-filling effects strongly influence the carrier dynamics, but further studies will be needed to fully comprehend the role of these processes.169 The collection of work discussed here shows that trPL has thus far provided a wealth of information on the photodynamics of light, emissive states in MHHPs, and is complementary to TAS which probes dark states, as discussed next.
3c. Transient absorption spectroscopy
TAS is a pump–probe technique where ultrafast femtosecond pump pulses excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of MHHPs as shown in the energy diagram in Fig. 7A.170 The excited electrons thermalize to a non-equilibrium distribution in the conduction band, which is bound by a characteristic parabolic band shape. The carriers then cool within a few picoseconds via electron–phonon coupling to a stable energy distribution, which follows the parabolic band shape that is centered slightly above the absorption band edge. The optical transitions of an incoming white light probe are then either blocked or enhanced. Further excitation of carriers into the conduction band is blocked by the equilibrium distribution of filled electronic states; these blocked transitions manifest as a negative signal, or photobleach (PB), in the TA spectra, which corresponds to the bandgap energies with reference to the valence band.171 Enhanced transitions, or photo-induced absorption (PIA), appear as positive signals in the TA spectra. PIA bands have been correlated with both conduction band saturation, which increases photoexcitation at off-peak wavelengths, and refractive index changes from the free carrier population as the dielectric function of MHHPs will vary as a result of the photoexcited states.172,173 The decay of photoexcited states is studied by monitoring the recovery of PB and PIA in TA spectra (Fig. 7B) where carriers can relax either via one-body trap-assisted recombination at grain boundaries or via many-body Auger recombination, which dominates at high pump fluences.173–176 If MHHPs are paired with an electron transport layer, such as TiO2 (depicted in Fig. 7B), then electrons that did not recombine are injected into the electron-selective scaffold.170

Recently, our group used TAS to examine the excited state dynamics in Br−/I− binary MHHPs as a function of Br substitution from 0 to 30%.170 MAPbI3−xBrx films were infiltrated in a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold on glass and samples were pumped at 400 nm to initiate dynamics. TA spectra of the different Br inclusion samples (Fig. 8A) show a strong PB signal that correlates well with the steady state absorption onset (PB1) similar to that observed in the literature.177 The recovery kinetics of PB1 was fit with a multi-exponential decay function (Fig. 8B) to reveal characteristic lifetimes correlated with carrier thermalization (τ0), recombination (τ1), and charge injection into TiO2 (τ2). Carrier recombination and charge injection lifetimes displayed a small increase with increasing Br content, which we attributed to the increased capacity of the conduction band in Br-containing perovskites and the slight shift in energy band alignment between TiO2 and MAPbI3−xBrx with increasing Br content. Most notable, however, was the significant decrease in the carrier thermalization lifetime (τ0) with increasing Br content (Fig. 8C), which suggests that the presence of Br enhances the electron–phonon coupling in the perovskite lattice, aiding in the relief of the hot phonon bottleneck observed in MAPbI3 perovskites.178–180 This rapid carrier cooling is likely attributable to the transition of the crystal structure from tetragonal to pseudocubic as well as a broadening of the conduction band as Br content is increased within the lattice.170

Yoon et al. also investigated the impact of halide ion concentration in the precursor solution on the excited state behavior with TAS.92 They infiltrated various stoichiometric ratios of Br− and I− in PbX2 and MAX precursors into a passive mesoporous Al2O3 scaffold in order to eliminate any signal recovery as a result of charge injection. They observed PB bands in TA spectra at wavelengths corresponding to the absorption onsets with a systematic blue-shift with Br substitution (Fig. 8D). The bleach recovery for each sample after 387 nm pump excitation (Fig. 8E) and the kinetic analysis following bimolecular charge recombination (Fig. 8F) show that the recombination timescale is slower in MHHPs at the optimized Br−:I− ratio (1:3.5, 1.518 ns lifetime) relative to pure MAPbBr3 (0.126 ns) and pure MAPbI3 (0.787 ns). In their follow-up work, the authors also studied the timescales of induced ion migration and phase segregation under 405 nm continuous wave laser irradiation of I/Br MHHPs.181 TAS recorded after subjecting the samples to 0, 1, and 40 minutes of irradiation revealed that reversible phase segregation of I- and Br-rich areas is induced within 1 minute; a longer irradiation time simply increased the time needed for the reversal of phase segregation. While light induced phase segregation of halide ions in MHHPs remains a challenge, it can be minimized by using a stoichiometric excess of halide ions in precursors compared to Pb2+ and by using halide ion post-treatment of the perovskite films.182
Unlike I/Br MHHPs, due to the rapid sublimation of Cl− in I:Cl binary mixed halide perovskites fewer, studies have focused on TAS of MAPbI3−xClx systems.52,55 Notably, Zhai et al. compared the ultrafast transient response of MAPbI3 films with those of both MAPbI1.1Br1.9 and MAPbI3−xClx films pumped at 400 nm using photomodulation spectroscopy. The photomodulation spectra for all three samples showed a PB band in conjunction with a PIA1 band located in the near IR region and a second PIA2 band located at wavelengths shorter than the PB band. The recovery kinetics of these bands showed that PIA1 and PB originated from two different species in the MAPbI3 film only, suggesting the coexistence of both excitons and free carriers from photoexcitation. PB and PIA1 recovery kinetics of MAPbI1.1Br1.9 and MAPbI3−xClx were near identical and indicted that the transient response resulted from the formation of excitons only, attributable to the large exciton binding energy in these MHHPs.183 While extensive literature exists on the excited-state dynamics of both pure-halide and mixed-halide perovskites, some deficits still remain in our understanding of the complex photophysics of MHHPs, motivating further work in this area.
3d. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) provides an understanding of the internal electrical processes of semiconducting materials, and an analysis with well-defined circuit models gives both qualitative and quantitative measures of the parameters of charge transport in solar cells. EIS has been a key tool to assess the chemical capacitance, recombination resistance, and charge conductivity of MHHPs; these processes directly govern the solar device performance. Recently, Cao et al. fabricated a fully printable solar cell with sequential deposition of compact TiO2, mesoporous TiO2, porous Al2O3, and porous carbon on FTO-glass and compared the performance of MAPbI3 PSCs (11.94% PCE) with those of MAPbI2.7Br0.3 (13.49%) and MAPbI2.4Br0.6 (11.83%).144 They employed EIS to understand the impact of halide content on the PCEs by generating Nyquist and Bode phase plots (Fig. 9A and B) and fitting the data to an appropriate circuit model. The fitted model explains the 3 features observed in Fig. 10A and B, in order of decreasing frequency, as the recombination resistance (Rct) and charge transfer at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, and dielectric response of the device. Rct exponentially decreased for biases below −0.7 V, which is the built-in potential reported at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface,144,184 and showed lower values for the MHHP devices (Fig. 9C). This is analogous to the findings by Tu et al. where they examined Rct for PSCs with mesoporous TiO2/MAPbI3−xBrx/spiro-OMeTAD where Rct reached a minimum when MHHPs were optimized with x = 0.14.143 EIS also allows us to examine the chemical capacitance (Cμ) which is defined as the capability of a system to accept or release charge carriers due to a change in their chemical potential. The authors observed that the rise of Cμ shifted to lower voltages (Fig. 9D), likely attributed to alterations in band alignment between the perovskite and TiO2 associated with the incorporation of Br. The product of Rct and chemical capacitance yields the apparent electron lifetime for the perovskite (τct), which is shown in Fig. 9E. Below −0.7 V, the MHHP devices have longer lifetimes than pure MAPbI3 devices, which suggests that Br substitution reduces the carrier recombination rate in perovskites. Further, EIS studies by Dong et al. have shown that Cl−-incorporated MHHPs also reduce the carrier recombination rate, resulting in a carrier lifetime of 18.3 μs relative to reference MAPbI3 devices with a maximum lifetime of 10.5 μs.121 The observations with EIS corresponded well with the device performance of MHHPs, which showed increased Voc, FF, and Jsc relative to the reference devices without Cl−. They concluded that the addition of Cl− led to an increase in grain sizes relative to the thickness of the film, which ultimately decreased carrier recombination at grain boundaries in the vertical direction, improving the carrier lifetime. Wang et al. also recently fabricated PSCs with compact TiO2/meso-TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD and used MAI to modify the interface between the mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite layer.152 The PSCs showed the highest Jsc, Voc, and FF, and the best efficiencies at 10 mg mL−1 MAI, which corresponded well with trends observed in EIS. EIS indicated the lowest recombination rate at this concentration, which explains the high Voc, and the highest ratio of shunt resistance (Rsh) to series resistance (Rs) which explains the high FF. EIS is also a highly sensitive characterization tool relative to other techniques providing a measure of charge transport even with trace quantities of halide in MHHPs. For example Zhao et al.123 synthesized MAPb(I1−xClx)3 by combining PbI2:MAI:MACl at ratios of 1:1:x where x = 1–2 and incorporated the MHHPs into planar and mesoscopic PSC architectures. While XRD and EDX could not confirm the presence of Cl in the active layer, EIS showed that the recombination resistance of the planar MAPbI3 solar cells was 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the MHHPs with MACl. This observation was corroborated with SEM, which indicated that, while the morphology is not altered with MACl concentrations, the density and coverage of the perovskite layer are improved, decreasing the recombination rate at the MHHPs/TiO2 interface.123

4. Inorganic mixed halide hybrid perovskites
4a. Fabrication and device performance
Inorganic perovskites replace the methylammonium cation with a small inorganic cation such as cesium and have recently demonstrated tremendous promise for both solid-state lighting and solar cells due to their high stability.22,185–189 Mixed halide CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 perovskites are of particular importance due to their high ambient stability and optical bandgaps suitable for designing solar cells.190 Inorganic MHHPs also overcome the phase instability of pure CsPbI3, which only retains its desirable black cubic phase (bandgap 1.73 eV) at temperatures above 310 °C and rapidly transitions back to the non-conducive yellow orthorhombic phase (band gap 3.01 eV) at room temperature.185 Sutton et al. demonstrated improved phase stability in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 MHHPs with increasing Br content by comparing the absorbance band edge of CsPbIBr2 and CsPbI3 films placed in an inert N2 chamber with a low flow of 50% relative humidity (RH) air (Fig. 10A). The absorbance showed high stability for CsPbIBr2 and rapid degradation for CsPbI3 occurring within 20 minutes of exposure. While these results are promising, the authors concluded that CsPbIBr2 will eventually revert to the orthorhombic phase when left under ambient conditions for extended periods of time.
While the higher stability of inorganic MHHPs has been attractive, their low device performance relative to methylammonium-based MHHPs has been a setback towards their use in commercially applicable PV devices. Ma et al. used dual source thermal evaporation to concurrently deposit CsI and PbBr2 onto a layer of planar TiO2 on FTO-coated glass followed by post-annealing to form CsPbIBr2 with a 2.05 eV band gap. The champion device had a PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF of 4.7%, 8.7 mA cm−2, 959 mV, and 0.56, respectively.192 Beal et al. fabricated an inverted solar cell with PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI2Br/PCBM/BCP ([2,9]-dimethyl-[4,7]-diphenyl-[1,10]-phenanthroline) using a 1-step deposition technique and achieved a PCE of 6.69% and a high Voc of 1.12 V.193 Surprisingly, they found that its IPCE dropped at lower wavelengths, which they attributed to the parasitic resistance of ITO. The efficiency and stability of inorganic MHHPs is also correlated with the fabrication approach and post-annealing conditions applied. Ho-Baillie and co-workers recently sprayed CsI on a spin-coated lead bromide film in air to develop CsPbIBr2 MHHPs and observed an impressive 6.3% efficiency when the substrate was maintained at room temperature but films were annealed at 300 °C.194 The films demonstrated high thermal stability with no detectable phase change, color change, or emergence of new impurity peaks post heat treatment. Snaith and co-workers compared perovskites deposited using both 1-step and 2-step methods, fabricating planar devices with TiO2 as an electron conductor, CsPbI2Br, and spiro-OMeTAD as a hole conductor.189 While the 2-step approach did not yield films optimal for solar devices, the 1-step-deposited champion device had a PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF of 9.84%, 11.89 mA cm−2, 1.111 V, and 0.75, respectively. The Shockley–Queisser limit for a material with the same bandgap (1.92 eV) as CsPbI2Br should yield a maximum Jsc and Voc of 16.3 mA cm−2 and 1.63 V, respectively. Zhou et al. have further improved upon the 1-step deposition of CsBr and PbI2 dissolved in DMF and DMSO using an antisolvent method.191 Their champion device resulted in 10.3% PCE (Fig. 10B) and remained stable without encapsulation for 1500 hours (Fig. 10C) with minimal degradation. The highest recorded efficiencies for fully inorganic MHHP devices were recently reported by Zeng et al.; they formed CsPbI2Br films via layer by layer spin-coating of perovskite nanocrystals followed by ligand removal.195 A P3HT layer was deposited after the perovskite followed by an annealing step which passivated surface defect states and resulted in efficient hole extraction and PCE > 12%. A summary of relevant literature findings on all inorganic MHHPs, their synthesis and deposition approach, and the resulting device performances is presented in Table 2. While these collections of work support the promise of cesium lead-based MHHPs, there remains a significant margin for improvement for inorganic MHHPs to be on par with methylammonium-based perovskites. PSCs fabricated with inorganic MHHPs, where the Pb2+ was replaced with Sn2+, have been actively pursued as well, but the PCEs were significantly lower than those of their Pb-based counterparts.196,197 Recent literature has also witnessed a tremendous rise in all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals which have been extensively synthesized with varying halide ions resulting in size- and morphology-controlled optical properties that have been harnessed in a range of optoelectronic applications.198–201 While we will not discuss nanocrystals in this review focused on bulk perovskites, we refer the readers to these excellent reviews on perovskite nanocrystals.202–205

4b. Optical and spectroscopic analysis
Analogous to methylammonium-based MHHPs, the optical properties of CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 films are tunable when the halide ratios are controlled, enabling straightforward manipulation of both the absorption band edge and PL. Sutton et al. fabricated CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 MHHPs by combining stoichiometric ratios of PbI2, PbBr2, and CsI in DMF and showed a blue shift in the absorption onset and the PL with increasing Br content from x = 0.67 to 1 (Fig. 11A and B).189 They observed that the extent of the blue shift was linearly related to the fractional iodide concentration (Fig. 11C) in accordance with Vegard's law, enabling them to tune the band gap to 1.92 eV. Similar to organic–inorganic MHHPs, phase separation is also known to occur in CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 as demonstrated by Beal et al. who exposed CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 films to 1 sun illumination for 9 min and observed that the PL of pure Br films and MHHPs with x > 0.6 remained stable, but for films with x = 0.2–0.4 the PL red-shifted over time, indicative of phase-segregation of Br- and I-rich domains.193 In another study, Ma et al. demonstrated that this phase-segregation likely emerges from the synthesis technique, so they fabricated CsPbIBr2 using dual-source thermal evaporation. Contrary to the results obtained by Beal et al., they observed that CsPbIBr2 films even with elevated Br content were stable in light soaking experiments.192 This is attributed to a more uniform deposition of the halides with thermal evaporation rather than the wet-chemical approach such that the halide ions are not segregated prior to light soaking and show higher stability when exposed to light. Dastidar et al. also demonstrated that the synthesis approach determines the light-induced stability of inorganic MHHPs.206 They first synthesized 10 nm nanocrystals (NCs) of CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 using a ligand-mediated hot-injection approach followed by deposition of the NCs onto a glass substrate, which they immersed in ammonium thiocyanate solution (NH4SCN) in isopropanol. The ligands on the NCs were removed with isopropanol and the NCs ripened and merged into larger grains, resulting in mixed halide films. Inorganic MHHPs with a Cl−:I− ratio of 1:6 demonstrated high stability when exposed to 11% humidity for 96 h, whereas reference CsPbI3 films transitioned from the black phase to the yellow phase within 18 h. The authors determined that excess chloride must remain as unmixed, segregated inclusions of CsPbCl3 in the sintered films, but the exact role of Cl− in improving the stability of inorganic perovskites remains elusive.

Beyond phase segregation, changes in PL have also been leveraged to understand how optical properties are correlated with the annealing temperature, precursor concentration, and halide stoichiometry of inorganic MHHPs.192,194,195,207 Notably, Ho-Baillie and coworkers synthesized CsPbI2Br films using dual source evaporation of CsBr and PbI2, where CsBr-rich, PbI2-rich, and stoichiometrically balanced films were achieved by altering the deposition rate of the precursors.207 PL imaging revealed that both CsBr- and PbI2-rich films have PL-inactive regions corresponding to impurity grains, but the stoichiometrically balanced films exhibited uniform PL emission, indicating no impurities in the perovskite layer. Time-resolved PL of these samples (Fig. 11D) revealed a long exciton lifetime for the stoichiometrically balanced films (7.15 ns) relative to CsBr-rich (1.15 ns) and PbI2-rich (4.05 ns) films; these shorter carrier lifetimes were correlated with the impurities detected in PL resulting from nonradiative energy losses.
The synthesis and resulting optical properties of inorganic MHHPs have also been investigated with ultrafast TAS measurements to track ion diffusion and formation of MHHPs. Hoffman et al. synthesized MHHPs by first synthesizing 12 nm CsPbBr3 NCs, removing excess ligands and depositing the NCs onto mesoporous TiO2. This was followed by a two-step annealing at 170 °C under vacuum and annealing at 250 °C in ambient air, which gave rise to bulk films.208 The annealed CsPbBr3 films were exposed to a PbI2 solution to yield MHHPs where the mixed halide formation in the films was controlled by both time and film thickness. TAS measurements showed that the thin 25 nm MHHP film had the characteristic PB band of CsPbBr3, which redshifted from 517 nm with I− incorporation (Fig. 11E). These trends are very similar to that observed with MAPbX3 MHHPs, indicating that MA+ and Cs+ have little contribution to the excitonic excited state. The recovery of the main bleach maxima for each of the films with increasing substitution of Br− with I− (Fig. 11F) illustrates that, despite an initial increase in the recombination rate with small amounts of I−, recombination slows as more I− is introduced and Br− is further exchanged, further stressing the importance of stoichiometry determined by trPL measurements. TA spectra of thicker, 350 nm, films revealed diffusion-limited migration of I− in CsPbBr3 films. The PB band redshifted with I− inclusion on the surface of the film, indicating that MHHPs were formed; however, no shifts were observed when the samples were excited at the bottom of the films, indicating a pure CsPbBr3 phase. These results suggest that the fabrication approach of inorganic MHHPs strongly contributes to their optical response and device performance. In another study, Chung et al. examined the relationship between electronic structures and hot-carrier relaxation rates in CsPbBr3, CsPbBr1.5I1.5, and CsPbI3.209 They observed that the hot carrier-relaxation rate is fastest for CsPbBr3, which they attributed to the multiphoton emission process. To further understand which of the hot carriers (electrons or holes) contributes to the relaxation rates, the authors calculated the electron densities of the valence band and conduction band at the R- and M-symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone. Their results suggested that the dependence of the hot-carrier cooling rate on the halide identity corresponds to the hole dynamics and differences in the antibonding coupling between Pb 6s and halide np orbitals.

5a(i). Fabrication and device performance. 
In addition to mixed halide perovskites, mixed cation hybrid perovskites have also enabled significant enhancement in optical properties, charge transport, and device performance, where formamidinium (FA, NH2CHNH2+), methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), and cesium (Cs+) cations are used in concert with varying halides.215,216,219,230 Since the size of the cation directly controls the symmetry of the lattice and the resulting optoelectronic properties, controlled substitution of cations in perovskites is known to impact lattice contraction/expansion, reduce the number of trap states, and improve surface passivation due to the hydrophobicity of ions.72,214,218,231 The size of the cation determines how it fits within the metal halide octahedra, where a too large cation results in lower dimensional perovskite structures, and a too small cation induces lattice strain and instability in the crystal structure. Early work by Snaith et al. showed that the substitution of MA with FA and Cs+ decreases the band gap of the perovskite with increasing size of the cation A.158 This observation was attributable to the modulation of the bond length of the cation B and halogen X, B–X, through the size of the cation A.48 The mixed cation approach provides a favorable avenue to achieve band gaps in the near infrared region, which is not only desirable for enhanced light harvesting in PSCs, but also amenable to tandem solar cells integrated with Si or CIGS based PVs.4,215
Mixed cation hybrid perovskites are most commonly achieved via 1-step deposition of precursors dissolved in DMF and DMSO, where PCEs > 20% have been achieved by carefully optimizing the ratio of MA to FA.5,63 Other approaches to fabricate mixed cation hybrid perovskites have also been pursued. Thakur et al. designed a printing-based two-step solution process forming α-phase (MA)x(FA)1−xPbI3 which generated impurity-free perovskite crystals without residual PbI2.220 Their approach resulted in uniform films with complete surface coverage on the mesoporous TiO2 layer with reduced recombination, long carrier lifetimes, and higher efficiencies (15.6% PCE) relative to MAPbI3 perovskites (14.7% PCE). Ji et al. also fabricated FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskites via cation exchange post MAPbI3 deposition by immersing the MAPbI3 films in an isopropanol solution of FAI.214 Mixed cation perovskite devices achieved 15.51% PCE at x = 0.75 with reduced hysteresis and higher stability relative to MAPbI3 based devices. In a recent study by Li et al., larger phenylethylammonium (PEA) ions were combined with FA to generate FAxPEA1−xPbI3 mixed cation perovskites via a 2-step spin coating process (Fig. 12A). FA and PEA integrated in the perovskite lattice increased the transition energy from the black to the yellow phase, effectively locking the structure in the photoactive phase. PEA enhances the perovskite stability under ambient conditions by (i) inducing a quasi-3D lattice composed of hybrid 2D perovskite regions (Fig. 12B) that improved structural stability, and (ii) by migrating into the grain boundaries and passivating the surface from moisture given its high hydrophobicity.36 The authors achieved FAxPEA1−xPbI3 solar cells with 17.7% PCE and negligible hysteresis and minimal degradation in device performance over a 16 day period. Table 2 summarizes the fabrication technique and device behavior of a number of mixed cation A hybrid perovskites.

5a(ii). Optical and spectroscopic analysis. 
The optical properties of mixed cation hybrid perovskites are highly tunable with controlled ratios of Cs, FA, and MA in the perovskite lattice.7,232 Zhang et al. recently synthesized FAxMA1−xPbI3 with x = 0 to 0.3.232 They observed a systematic red shift in the band edge, with a large 25 nm shift in absorbance resulting from 30% FA incorporation. PL shifts corresponded well with absorbance, showing a red-shift (Fig. 12C) although a gradual decrease in the FWHM of the PL peaks was observed with increasing FA. This peak narrowing indicates a higher degree of crystallinity and less energetic disorder in the perovskite layer with increasing FA. TrPL measurements revealed an increase in carrier lifetimes with increasing FA (∼11 to 17 ns for x = 0 to 0.3), which further supports that FA improves the crystallinity and crystal structure.
While mixed cation hybrid perovskites have largely focused on FA and MA pairings, the inclusion of Cs+ with these larger organic cations has shown to improve the photostability and electronic properties of the perovskite.218,233,234 Bush et al. performed light soaking PL measurements for CsxFA1−xPb(BryI1−y)3 and demonstrated that at ∼25% concentration, Cs+ prevents halide segregation in the perovskite layer,235 which is in agreement with previous reports.236 Furthermore, Niu et al. synthesized Cs0.09MA0.91PbI3 mixed cation perovskites and achieved 18.1% PCE from solar cells.237 They examined the defect densities in Cs-doped and undoped films with trPL where the longer lifetimes of Cs0.09MA0.91PbI3 hybrid perovskites (2.9 ns) compared to MAPbI3 (1.9 ns) indicated a reduction of trap density. They also conducted XPS measurements which, in conjunction with trPL, suggested that Cs+ likely suppresses unsaturated Pb+ that arise when there are iodide deficiencies. Metallic Pb acts as a recombination center, giving rise to shorter carrier lifetimes and poor device performance as observed in undoped MAPbI3 films. In another study, Nam and co-workers designed a fully inorganic mixed cation hybrid perovskite where Cs ions were partially substituted with potassium, Cs1−xKxPbI2Br, from x = 0 to 0.1.238 The authors found that absorbance increased with increasing K+ ions but with minimal shifts in the band edge. TrPL measurements of pristine films revealed that the carrier lifetime decreased with increasing K+ (14 ns for x = 0 and 11 ns for x = 0.075), which the authors attributed to residual K+ ions that failed to incorporate into A site vacancies. They also compared the pristine films with Cs1−xKxPbI2Br films paired with TiO2, an electron acceptor, and trPL revealed that K+ ions promoted more efficient carrier extraction from the perovskite into TiO2. They attributed this phenomenon to morphology refinement with K incorporation, which resulted in smoother and larger perovskite crystals and manifested as enhanced photovoltaic performance from 8.2% PCE for CsPbI2Br films to 9.1% for Cs0.925K0.075PbI2Br.

5b(i). Fabrication and device performance. 
While Pb-based perovskites have thus far achieved unprecedented efficiencies, the high toxicity of lead is a primary concern to the environment and to human health as even low exposure levels are associated with significant health impairments.239,240 The US environmental protection agency (EPA) has strict regulations in place for lead-based technologies;240 these concerns over Pb toxicity have therefore hindered the wide-scale implementation of Pb-based perovskites. Therefore, research efforts in both computational and experimental work have focused on replacing Pb with nontoxic elements including Sn, Ge, Bi, Sb, and Ag.239,241,242 However, a complete replacement of Pb has resulted in poor device efficiencies, which has motivated the use of mixed cation hybrid perovskites with controlled substitution of a nontoxic cation B. This minimizes the severe toxicity of Pb while maintaining excellent optoelectronic properties, stability, and high performance. Tin (Sn), a nontoxic earth-abundant metal, is a highly promising contender to replace Pb and has been extensively studied as a viable substitute due to similar physical and chemical properties to Pb.243,244 The slightly smaller ionic radius of Sn2+ (1.35 Å) compared to Pb2+ (1.49 Å) suggests that substitution could occur with minimal lattice perturbations245–247 and transition the crystal structure from the tetragonal I4cm to the stable cubic P4mm structure at >50% Sn inclusion.246,248 Studies on mixed cation MASnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskites have shown that x = 1, i.e. complete replacement of Pb, is detrimental to PSCs because (i) SnI2 reacts much faster with MAI and poor film quality is observed due to rapid, uncontrollable crystallization,225,227 and (ii) Sn2+ is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly oxidizes to Sn4+, leading to rapid degradation rates.156,226,249,250 Therefore, well-controlled amounts of Pb are necessary to stabilize Sn in its 2+ state. Choy and co-workers have achieved >15% PCE with Pb–Sn mixed cation perovskites with 25% Sn inclusion in a planar inverted device architecture.224 Li et al. showed that up to 50% of Pb can be successfully substituted with Sn, reaching 13.6% PCE with optimized annealing temperature and active layer thickness.245 Recent work has also shown that Pb–Sn mixed cations also display near negligible hysteresis in J–V curves, demonstrating improved charge transport with Sn substitution.224,225 The annealing conditions of mixed cation films primarily determine the crystalline morphology and the resulting optoelectronic properties. Sn inclusion has been shown to improve crystallinity, resulting in larger and uniform grains247 with improved coverage of perovskite crystals in films.248 The choice of the solvent for dissolution of mixed cations also has a profound effect on the crystallinity. For example DMSO acts as a strong capping agent for Sn- and Pb-based precursors, enabling slower crystallization and formation of flat and smooth grains ideal for high performance mixed cation PSCs.224,246
Belcher and co-workers recently performed a feasibility study where they substituted between 1.6 and 25% of Pb with various transition metals (Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Sr, and Zn) in MAPbI3 and demonstrated that the substituted metal is not required to be a group IV element such as Sn.222 The authors found that MAPbI3 tolerates up to 6% Pb substitution with most cations without a significant setback to its optoelectronic properties except Fe, which was detrimental to device performance even in small amounts. The study revealed that MAPbI3 properties were most enhanced with an optimized concentration of 1.6% Co+ inclusion and achieved 17.2% PCE compared to 16.6% PCE of reference MAPbI3 devices in an inverted planar geometry. This was mostly driven by an increase in Voc, where 1.05 V was observed for the device with 1.6% Co+ inclusion compared to 0.99 V for the reference, Pb-only, device.222 No change in the bandgap was observed with Co2+; however, significant shifts were observed in both the work function and band energies of the Pb–Co mixed cation system for Co2+ fractions greater than 3% (Fig. 13A), enabling a desirable energetic alignment with the PEDOT:PSS hole transport material that accounts for the improvements they observed in Voc. This impactful study will ultimately enable researchers to fine tune the properties of mixed cation perovskites to achieve high efficiencies and simultaneously achieve high stability, low toxicity, and improved band alignment. Frolova et al. also pursued a systematic study to screen a range of metal cations (Ag+, Cu+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Hg2+, In3+, Bi3+, Sn4+, and Ti4+) to minimize Pb in current perovskites.226 While most cations at a minimal 10% substitution were detrimental to the performance of PSCs, the Hg–Pb mixed cation perovskites boosted efficiencies by 38%, giving rise to 13.0% PCE for MAHg0.1Pb0.9I3 relative to 9.4% PCE for reference MAPbI3 devices, as demonstrated in Fig. 13B.226 They attributed this increase in PCE to improved crystallinity and connectivity between grains in conjunction with minimal impact on the optoelectronic properties.

Beyond divalent metal cations, a recent study by Wang et al. suggested indium, In, as a promising partial substitute for Pb. Trivalent In3+ complexes well with Pb2+ in the perovskite lattice and the authors showed that mixed-cation mixed-halide MAPb(1−x)InxI3Clx with 15% In substitution in an inverted planar device geometry resulted in 17.55% PCE compared to 12.61% PCE of MAPbIxCl3−x control devices.223 SEM confirmed that MAPb(1−x)InxI3Clx films had smaller grain sizes but fewer pinholes compared to MAPbIxCl3−x films. Furthermore, 1-D XRD and 2-D grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) showed that Pb–In mixed cation perovskites grow with multiple ordered crystal orientations, which promotes efficient charge transport in multiple directions. The authors also monitored PCE as a function of air exposure time and observed increased stability of In-incorporated devices, which was attributed to the more stable In3+ oxidation state compared to Pb2+.223Table 2 provides a detailed summary of the reported perovskite compositions, device configurations, and synthetic techniques that have been investigated for B-site mixed cation hybrid perovskites. These collections of high impact work on mixed-cation perovskites demonstrate that new compositional engineering approaches need to be adopted beyond mixed-halide perovskites to design perovskites with high ambient stability, low toxicity, and optoelectronic properties optimized for high efficiency devices.


5b(ii). Optical and spectroscopic analysis. 
The optical properties of Pb–Sn mixed cation perovskites are quite remarkable and have enabled researchers to systematically reduce the bandgap with increasing Sn. Band gaps as low as 1.1–1.2 eV have been observed with 50 and 75% Sn substitution.225,228,243,245,246 This has resulted in significant red shifts in both the absorption onset and IPCE responses reaching nearly 1060 nm, which is unprecedented for pure MAPbI3 and CsPbI3 perovskites.225,228,245,246,251 The IPCE responses of Pb–Sn mixed cation perovskites are shown in Fig. 13C where 50% Sn substitution shows a strong red-shift and broadband light absorption.222 This broadband light harvesting ability has allowed the utility of mixed cation perovskites in tandem devices with the promise to substantially lower fabrication costs compared to traditional Si-based tandem devices.225,229 Notably, the red shift in the absorption onset is induced by a number of divalent metal cations when substituted controllably in the Pb-based perovskite lattice.252
In addition to bandgap tunability, the presence of Sn also aids in phase stability. Yang et al. compared MAPb(I1−yBry)3 and MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 with ssPL with light soaking experiments with a 1 sun intensity 532 nm laser.177 They observed that the PL peak of MAPb(I1−yBry)3 MHHPs gradually shifts from 1.8 to 1.64 eV within 30 s, indicating light-induced phase segregation which we discussed in Section 3a. However, the PL of MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 mixed cation perovskite was stable even after 90 min of continuous irradiation. Since MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 has overall low PLQY, the authors also performed TA measurements to further affirm their conclusions. Samples were excited with a low fluence 365 nm pump followed by short exposure to a secondary excitation at both low intensity (0.01 sun) and high intensity (1 sun). TA spectra of both MAPb(I1−yBry)3 MHHPs and MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 showed a characteristic photobleach signal at a 10 ps delay correlating with the steady state absorbance band edge. While the intensity of the secondary light exposure had minimal impact on the TA peak position of MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 (Fig. 13D(i)), for MAPb(I1−yBry)3 the photobleach signal blue-shifted from 660 nm to 600 nm and a new signal appeared around 750 nm (Fig. 13D(ii)). These changes in the MAPb(I1−yBry)3 correspond to two separate material compositions and indicate that in the absence of Sn, severe phase segregation into I- and Br-rich phases occurs. The MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 mixed cation perovskite remained stable during TA measurements.177 In another study by Jen and co-workers, an ideal bandgap (1.35 eV) complex mixed cation mixed halide MAPb0.5Sn0.5(I0.8Br0.2)3 perovskite was rationally designed with multiple advantages over traditional MAPbI3. They include lower nonradiative recombination states, band edge disorder, and Urbach energy coupled with a higher absorption coefficient, which resulted in ∼17.63% PCE.253 The strong PL intensity of this optimized complex perovskite relative to un-optimized MAPb0.75Sn0.25I3 suggested that defect states were reduced and the band edge was sharpened in MAPb0.5Sn0.5(I0.8Br0.2)3, which indicates improved optoelectronic quality and excellent light absorption. They performed trPL to analyze the photostability of MAPb0.5Sn0.5(I0.8Br0.2)3 and observed that the PL peak position and intensity remain unaltered under continuous illumination of a 532 nm laser (1 sun equivalent incident photon flux), suggesting minimal light-induced phase segregation. They correlated this high photostability with an improved internal bonding environment (crystallite size and microstrain) that resulted in an increased barrier for halide migration and alleviated phase instability under illumination.253
In addition to Sn, Lau et al. recently investigated inorganic mixed cation perovskites with controlled substitution of Pb with strontium (Sr).212 While Sr substitution did not shift the absorption onset, the absorbance increases when Sr doping is <5% in CsPb1−xSrxI2Br films. The authors observed negligible shifts in PL emission peaks, but trPL measurements of CsPb1−xSrxI2Br films revealed interesting trends. They deposited the CsPb1−xSrxI2Br films with 0 to 5% Sr substitution on an inert mp-Al2O3 scaffold to eliminate any electron extraction. Decay traces at the emission peak revealed a fast (τ1) time constant attributed to defect trapping and a slow (τ2) time constant correlated with effective recombination. While the defect trapping lifetime did not change at all with Sr doping %, the effective recombination lifetime was improved for the 2% Sr-substituted sample (167.1 ns) compared to the undoped perovskite film (11.1 ns). However, excess Sr in 5% doped films adversely impacted recombination decreasing the lifetime to 9.3 ns. Device performance correlated well with trends in carrier lifetimes where 2% Sr substituted mixed cation perovskites gave rise to 11.2% PCE relative to 7.7% for CsPbI2Br films.

6. Conclusions and future outlook
In summary, this comprehensive review provides an overview of the progress in the past five years in organic–inorganic and all-inorganic lead mixed halide perovskites, the impact on their optical properties, and the improvements in device efficiency achieved with controlled halide substitution. We have summarized the synthesis approaches to achieving controlled Br, Cl, and mixed Br/Cl substitution in the MAPbI3 lattice via both solution-processing and vapor-deposition techniques with particular emphasis on the role of solvents, annealing temperatures, and deposition conditions to ultimately give rise to improved high power conversion efficiencies not achievable by mono-halide perovskites. Unique from other reviews, our focus has been to highlight how the halide identity directly impacts the optical characteristics including high photostability, tunable optical band gaps and photoluminescence, and approaches to minimize light-induced segregation of halides in MHHPs. We also discuss the utility of ultrafast spectral techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence to probe fundamental processes such as carrier thermalization, carrier recombination via trap states and Auger processes, and charge injection that enables the high performance in MHHPs. Furthermore, we also briefly summarize the findings in the literature about the use of impedance spectroscopy to study the high recombination resistance and long carrier lifetimes of MHHPs, which align well with the observations of optical spectroscopies. In addition to methylammonium-based MHHPs, we also discuss the advances in Cs-based all inorganic MHHPs, their fabrication, optical and optoelectronic properties, and device performance. Finally, we conclude this review with progress in mixed-cation perovskites where the traditional methylammonium cation is substituted with controlled amounts of Cs and formamidinium, as well as where the traditional Pb cation is substituted with other divalent metals such as Sn, Co, and Mn, or trivalent cations such as In. We briefly highlight the fabrication and device performance of mixed cation hybrid perovskites and discuss the utility of ultrafast optical spectroscopies in studying defect trapping and exciton recombination in this class of perovskites. We anticipate that hybrid perovskites of mixed cations, mixed anions, and a combination of the two will give rise to a new class of materials, allowing multifaceted tunability of their optical and optoelectronic properties and several technological applications beyond PVs.
We anticipate that in the next five years new perovskite materials will be discovered, new fabrication and deposition approaches will be realized, and new PV architectures will be characterized to ultimately improve the commercial feasibility of MHHPs in a range of technologies. Particularly, the substitution of Pb with cations that are earth-abundant and low in toxicity is appealing to improve the broader impact of perovskites in applications beyond solar cells, such as biological labelling254 and biomedical imaging.255 Furthermore, we expect that the existing fabrication techniques of perovskites reviewed in this article will be merged with innovative concepts where smart interfacial engineering, such as integrated 2D/3D interfaces, and advanced deposition tools will generate devices that are stable for >10000 h with zero loss in performances.221 While most of the research on perovskites thus far has focused on small, laboratory-scale processes, new approaches that enable a transition from “lab to fab” such as 3D printing256 and roll-to-roll production257,258 will be needed for fully printed cost-competitive PSCs. Other considerations, not discussed in this review, which are essential to determine the full potential of PSCs as an inexpensive alternative to Si-based PVs are assessing the toxicity to human health259,260 and multi-stage life-cycle assessment studies to evaluate environmental impact.261–263 Furthermore, we anticipate that progress in MHHPs will enable interfacing these hybrid materials with light harvesting photonic nanostructures to understand the impact on their carrier transport relative to other mesoporous solar cells.264–268 With rapid progress in these future directions, we envision that MHHPs will ultimately enable a paradigm shift in perovskite technologies.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskites with cubic (left) and tetragonal (right) crystal structures. In this ABX3 structure, organic or inorganic cations occupy position A (green), metal cations occupy B (black), and halide ions occupy X (blue). The lead halide octahedron (maroon) forms a corner linked network around methylammonium cations. (B) Absorption spectra comparing the light harvesting capability of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) vs. CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskites. (C) Band energy level diagram of CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites and commonly utilized charge-extraction layers. The work functions of the electrodes shown are represented by dotted lines.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A) Schematic illustration of (i) solution-based one-step spin coating of a perovskite film, which often results in incomplete coverage and (ii) the heated airflow process for the pin-hole free layer growth of a MAPb(I1−xClx)3 perovskite layer. (B) XRD of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 with varying Br content, x. The region of the tetragonal (004)T and (220)T and cubic (200)C peaks (2θ = 27.5–31.0°) has been magnified to highlight the crystal structure conversion with increasing Br content. (C) Power conversion efficiency of PSCs based on MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.06, 0.20, 0.29) when stored in air at room temperature without encapsulation. The humidity was maintained at 35%, and the PSCs were exposed to a humidity of 55% on day four to investigate their performance variation at high humidity. At low Br content, the perovskites have low tolerance to moisture and degrade rapidly. (D) Power conversion efficiencies of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 devices as a function of Br content (x). (E) J–V curves of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 PSCs for a range of x = 0–1. (F) Schematic illustration of bromine doping via halide exchange, where I− is substituted with Br− on the surface of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer when exposed to vapors of HBr solution in acetic acid. An initial halide gradient is formed where the surface is bromine-rich (red color) and the bottom is an iodine-rich region (black color). Panel (A) adapted with permission from ref. 82.
