    , Accepted 2nd June 2023First published on 6th June 2023AbstractThiophene–vinylene–thiophene (TVT) is a well-known building block of organic photovoltaic materials because of its tunable optical absorption, strong molecular aggregation, and high charge mobility. Recently, TVT-based materials attracted much more attention because promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16% has been reported. This review comes to being and will sum up the TVT-based conjugated polymers and small molecules in which TVT can serve as either an electron-donating unit or an electron-accepting unit according to its substituents and also can act as a π bridge unit in these materials. The main content elaborated includes molecular structures, charge generation, transport, and collection properties, energy loss, molecular stacking, and blend film morphology. In particular, the contribution of molecular stacking originating from the enhanced molecular rigidity caused by the introduction of non-covalent interaction will be emphasized. Of note is that the carboxylate-containing TVT-based polymers show reduced non-radiative energy loss compared to their counterparts without carboxylate. And both polymers and small molecule acceptors based on Y-series small molecules using TVT as the linkage unit present a wide absorption window, homogeneous phase composition, and high charge mobility. In addition, the TVT material-based all-polymer and ternary OPVs which exhibited satisfactory PCE have also been discussed.
1. Introduction
Organic small molecules (SMs) and conjugated polymers (CPs) are commonly utilized as photovoltaic materials because of their unique advantages of low-cost, light weight, and easy modification compared to the inorganic counterparts.1–3 SMs have merits of adjustable molecular structures and good reproduction between batch production,4–7 while CPs exhibit excellent solution-processability and good mechanical characteristics owing to their high molecular weight and solution viscosity.8–10 With the development of high-efficient CPs and SMs, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures have acquired tremendous progress as evidenced by the power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 19%.11–14 The alternating electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) moieties constructing the backbones of CPs and SMs have been proved as one successful molecular structure because of the easily modulated optoelectronic properties.15
Vinylene as the simplest unit has been widely used in various photovoltaics because it can not only prolong the conjugation of the backbone but also adjust the molecular structure due to its intrinsic rotation properties. At the earliest times, vinylene was introduced into the backbone of poly(thiophene) (PT) to extend the conjugation and broaden the absorption in the visible region, but it was not used in the field of OPVs.16–18 Early in 1995, Heeger et al. used a vinylene-containing polymer poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) as a donor and (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl carboxylate (PC61BM) as an acceptor and reported the first BHJ-based OPV.19 Later, it was discovered that vinylene can reduce the steric hindrance of adjacent groups, in particular, vinylene can increase the intermolecular interactions of bulky aromatic units. Taking the large naphthalene diimide (NDI) as an example, it was found that the insertion of vinylene between two NDI units markedly optimized the twisted structures, brought an enlarged conjugation, and finally improved the molecular crystallinity and modulated the blend film morphology.20
Subsequently, during the use and development of vinylene, thienylene–vinylene–thienylene (TVT) appeared as a portion of various polymers and SMs and played different roles in tuning molecular properties according to the position of TVT on the molecules.21 When TVT was inserted between two bulky aromatic perylene diimide (PDI) units, the excessive aggregation of PDI-based polymer can be effectively overcome, leading to higher charge carrier mobility.22,23 Compared with the counterpart bithiophene without the vinylene linkage unit, materials containing TVT as an electron-donating unit showed higher performance because TVT made the molecule tend to form stronger π–π stacking and a more ordered structure. For example, the D–A copolymer with TVT as the electron-donating unit and isoindigo as the electron-withdrawing unit achieved higher PCE when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl carboxylate (PC71BM), which is also the highest PCE of the fullerene-based devices at that time.24 Besides this, the TVT unit can also be substituted on the side chain of CPs and SMs, and the two most obvious roles are extending the absorption even to 1000 nm and increasing the charge mobilities.25–27 These previous studies prove that TVT promoted the development of photovoltaic materials due to enhanced planarity and conductivity. Actually, TVT-based photovoltaic materials have been extensively studied over the past few decades because of the outstanding device parameters including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF).28–30
In particular, with the development of non-fullerene acceptors, TVT-based CPs and SMs have played an increasingly important role in the field of OPVs, and the performances of the devices prepared with them are very high. Recently, Bo et al. synthesized a wide-bandgap polymer, PBTVT, which comprises a TVT acceptor unit and a benzodithiophene donor unit. The devices fabricated with PBTVT as the donor and ITOIC-2F (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(3,4-bis(hexyloxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) as the acceptor exhibited an overall PCE of 11.04% with halogen-free green solvent o-xylene. The desired face-on orientation of PBTVT in the blend films facilitated the charge transport although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level offset between PBTVT and ITOIC-2F is only 0.08 eV.31 Very recently, Hou et al. reported a polymer poly(bis(2-butyloctyl) [2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-4,4′′-dicarboxylate-5,5′-diyl-vinylene) (PTVT-T) containing carboxylate-substituted TVT as the electron-withdrawing unit, which finally exhibited a quite high PCE of 16.20% after combining with non-fullerene acceptor 2,2′-[[12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-12,13-dihydro-3,9-dinonylbisthieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole-2,10-diyl]bis[methylidyne(5,6-chloro-3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile] (BTP-eC9).32 The carboxylate substitution on the TVT unit is helpful to obtain a planar skeleton structure and form good phase separation morphology in favor of intermolecular charge transport.
Whether as a connecting unit or an electron-donating or electron-withdrawing unit on the backbone or side chain, TVT can optimize the material's properties to some extent; therefore, TVT-based materials are expected to perform better with the emergence of new structures. There is only a review with a focus on poly(thiophene vinylene)-related low-cost polymers.33 Nevertheless, the main photovoltaic characteristics of TVT-based polymers and small molecules need more deep understanding, especially, the future development of TVT-based donors based on the emergence of new various fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. In this review, the progress of TVT-containing materials applied in OPVs will be summarized and the properties of CPs and SMs will be analyzed in detail and the relationship with their structures will be established. Especially, the positive role played by TVT in regulating molecular configuration, then affecting molecular arrangement, and finally tuning the molecular absorption and charge mobility will be emphasized. Meanwhile, the promising materials (carboxylate-containing TVT-based polymers) and devices (all-polymer and ternary OPVs) will be highlighted. A better understanding of designing novel and high-performance TVT-based photovoltaic materials will be provided.
2. Conformation of TVT-based molecules
Due to the rotation of the single bond, TVT-based molecules usually exhibit several conformations. The final molecular conformations also behave differently based on the substituents. Firstly taking the absolute TVT unit as an example, four cis–trans isomers as shown in Fig. 1a can be obtained by theoretical calculation.34 The relaxed potential surface energy scans based on the density functional theory (DFT) show great energy differences against torsion degrees in the energy order of (cis, cis)-TVT > (cis, trans)-TVT > (trans, trans)-TVT. After the vacancy sites on the TVT unit were replaced by functional substituents, the molecular packing structure can be modulated because the backbone planarity is related to the regio-positioning of the introduced alkyl chains on the TVT unit. For instance, the intorsion angles (θ1) between two thiophene units are 23.3° and 1.0° for PI and PO, respectively, and the inter-monomeric torsion angles (θ2) between the thiophene linked with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and TVT are similar as shown in Fig. 1b.35 Additionally, the neighboring oligothiophene rings within the PI backbone cross toward the left and right of each other, whereas for PO they are mutually twisted in the same direction, implying a certain coil-like polymer conformation. In order to appropriately decrease the rotation of the vinylene linker, noncovalent interactions and covalent interactions were introduced to tune the molecular structure within the aromatic backbone.36–39 For example, the O⋯S weak noncovalent interaction between the oxygen atom of the alkoxyl groups and the sulfur atom of the thiophene units can be employed to promote molecular planarity. As shown in Fig. 1c, the twisted TVT–nC3H7 is less stable than TVT–OEt with a planar configuration. The calculated results indicate that the dihedral angles of the TVT–OEt building block were fixed through the O⋯S interaction which is shortened to be 2.690 Å and thus the whole backbone is almost planar. In its crystalline structure, a typical herringbone packing with O⋯S interaction further proves the importance of the O⋯S conformational lock.38

Another strategy to fix the conformation is fusing the vinylene of TVT with a covalent bond. We constructed a fused TVT unit namely ETVT and found that there are two conformational isomers cis-ETVT and trans-ETVT when taking the TVT unit as a reference. Owing to the only rotatable bond in the ETVT unit, the steric repulsions between the CH2 group of the alkyl chain and the sulfur atom of thiophene make the dihedral angle fixed at 180° as shown in Fig. 1d. The strong electronic localization of the fused ETVT unit downshifts the HOMO energy level and thus enhances VOC. This method can not only restrict the rotatable vinylene unit but also rearrange the electronic distribution and even decrease the energy loss of the fabricated devices, which will be discussed in detail below.34,37 These structure evaluations reveal the reason why and how to use the TVT unit to increase the conjugation and planarity of materials.
3. 
        TVT-based p-type materials
As mentioned previously, TVT can be utilized to construct donor or acceptor materials according to the substituted groups. This section will focus on the TVT-containing p-type materials, which are roughly divided into polymers and SMs. The polymers will be further classified into copolymers based on thiophene, D–A type polymers, and terpolymers. There have been reported two kinds of SMs, in which the TVT unit is arranged on the backbone or substituted on the side chain. The optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of these materials caused by the structure will be described in detail.
3.1 
          TVT-based p-type polymers

3.1.1 Copolymers based on TVT and thiophene. 
Early on, poly(thienylene-vinylene) (PTVs) synthesized by Henckens et al. showed promise and potential for use in photovoltaic devices, but the performance was quite low.40 The later modification of the substituted group on PTVs further enhanced the charge transport, and thereby slightly improved the device performance.41,42 For example, in 2004 Smith et al. designed a PTV analogous polymer C1 (Fig. 2) and obtained a PCE of 0.24% when blended with PC61BM.43 The detailed polymer properties and device parameters can be obtained in Table 1. In 2005, Hou et al. designed another polymer C2 by simplifying the alkyl chain on thiophene of C1 and obtained a similar PCE of 0.26%.42 The poor performance of these PTVs was attributed to the inherently non-luminescent characteristics, short lifetime of the singlet excited state and useless exciton decay process.

After that, little research has been attempted to improve the photovoltaic performance of PTV derivatives. Kim et al. designed a TVT-based copolymer C3 (similar to C1), with which the fabricated PC71BM-based devices only achieved a PCE of 0.53%.44 They found that the main reason may be that the excessive aggregation of C3, as well as the poor miscibility between C3 and PC71BM, resulted in serious exciton recombination. Then, they developed another copolymer C4 by incorporating two thiophene units between two adjacent vinylene units and found that C4 had good solution processability and high structural organization after annealing.45 In combination with the low HOMO level, high hole mobility, and small bandgap, the devices gave a consequent PCE of 1.2% when combined C4 with PC71BM. In 2012, Chen et al. designed and synthesized two two-dimensional (2D) polymers C5 and C6, in which the conjugated side chains extended the π-electron delocalization perpendicular to the molecular backbone and markedly enhanced the hole mobility to 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1.46 As a result, a PCE as high as 4.04% was achieved in the C5-based devices. However, C6-based devices showed relatively low mobility of 1.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE of 2.06% because the bulky pendent branched thiophene unit in C6 reduced the ordering of polymer backbones and finally led to nearly amorphous film morphology. Undoubtedly, Chen's work drives the development of TVT-based p-type polymers and devices. From the relationship between the molecular structures and corresponding device performance, C5 exhibits a much higher JSC although the VOC is not very suitable. Therefore, the large π-conjugation may be beneficial to obtain desired photoelectric properties for TVT-based copolymers and offers a novel approach to further modify the molecular backbone. Recently, Peng et al. designed a polymer C7 by combining TVT and carboxylate-functionalized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. As a result of the extraordinary hole mobility and film morphology, the devices ultimately gave a PCE of 7.05% when combining C7 with PC71BM.47 Obviously, this molecular strategy can greatly enhance the PCE of copolymers based on TVT and thiophene. As a group, the performance of copolymers based on TVT and thiophene is generally very low, which is mainly attributed to the unmatched energy levels, absorption, and miscibility with fullerene acceptors.


3.1.2 
            TVT-based D–A type copolymers. 
According to the role played by the TVT unit, we simply divided the reported TVT-based D–A type polymers into three categories, as shown in Fig. 3. Table 2 summarizes the electronic properties and device performance. Firstly, when TVT acts as an electron-rich unit and is copolymerized with various electron-deficient units, a series of D–A conjugated polymers were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4. After incorporating the electron-withdrawing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) building block, a low bandgap (1.57 eV) D–A conjugated polymer D1 was synthesized.48 Unfortunately, a low PCE of 1.0% was achieved due to the poor absorption and inefficient exciton dissociation when blended with PC71BM. After two fluorine atoms were introduced into the BT unit, polymer D2 exhibited a better PCE of 5.98% behind blending with a three-dimensional SM acceptor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N′-bis(2-octyl-dodecyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide]-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SF-PDI4).49 Yang's group combined D2 with PC71BM and fabricated a high-performance device with a PCE of 7.86% without any additive and thermal annealing treatment.50 In order to improve the backbone rigidity, Huang et al. incorporated the noncovalent conformational lock S⋯O through introducing an ethoxy side chain into the TVT unit and synthesized a new polymer D3. Compared with the counterpart polymer (without S⋯O noncovalent interaction), D3 showed better charge transport mobility and a final higher PCE of 6.16%.51 Wang et al. synthesized four polymers D4–D7via combining the TVT unit and difluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT) and investigated the effect of the side chain substituted on TVT on the photovoltaic performance.52 Compared with the longer alkyl side chain (D6 and D7), it was found that the larger conjugated thiophene side chain endowed polymers D4 and D5 with lower bandgaps and more rigid backbones to form highly ordered π–π stacking nanostructures. Ultimately, D4:PC71BM devices exhibited the highest PCE of 6.79% because of the optimal morphology with suitable domain sizes to the stimulative exciton dissociation and reduced bimolecular recombination. Therefore, the use of conjugated side chains or conformational locks can effectively enhance the intermolecular π–π interaction and hence realize better charge carrier transport. D4–D7 all possessed branched side chains on the TVT unit, which inevitably imposes steric hindrance due to the close distance between the tertiary branched site located at the second carbon and the main chain. Therefore, these branched side chains twisted the main-chain coplanarity and attenuated interchain interactions. Whereafter, Cheng et al. introduced a carbon–carbon triple bond between the thiophene unit and the branched side chain to address the issue. D8 and D9 were designed when FBT and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) were used as electron-withdrawing units, respectively. Systematic analysis shows that acetylene-incorporated TVT can dramatically reduce the steric hindrance, enhance the coplanarity of the molecular backbone, and promote interchain interactions. On the other hand, D9 possessed a wider absorption range and higher crystallinity than D8. Hence, D9:PC71BM-based devices outputted a higher PCE of 7.75% with synergistically improved performance parameters.53

 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of p-type polymers with TVT as the electron-donating unit and other units as the A moiety. 
Moreover, a series of electron-deficient units besides BT have also been copolymerized with TVT units and obtained many copolymers. When using the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit as the electron-withdrawing unit, the polymer D11 with shorter and closer branched alkyl side chains afforded higher PCE of 7.16% than polymer D10 with longer and farther branched alkyl side chain mainly due to the obviously enhanced FF to 66%.54,55 This result proved that the branched point of alkyl side chains had a big influence on the phase separation and charge transport owing to the tunable intermolecular interaction and compatibility between the donor and acceptor.55 When DPP was used as the electron-deficient unit, three polymers D12–D14 containing different π linkages between donor and acceptor units and alkyl side chains substituted on DPP were synthesized.56,57 Whether furan or thiophene acted as the π linkage, lower PCE was obtained when blending these polymers with PC71BM. Further optimizing the side chain length of polymer D12, PCE was enhanced because of the higher absorption coefficient in the region of 500–900 nm and smaller nanoscale phase separation.58
In addition to BT, TPD, and DPP units, some other large π-conjugation electron-withdrawing units were also used to construct D–A type polymers using TVT as the electron-donating unit. Jo et al. designed a highly π-extended polymer D15 by utilizing isoindigo as the electron-deficient segment.24 Because of the strong electron-withdrawing properties and planar π-conjugated structure of the isoindigo unit, D15 showed a broad absorption and deep HOMO energy level and finally gave a high PCE of 7.09%. After regulating the location of the branched point of the alkyl chain on isoindigo, Wang et al. reported two polymers D16 and D17.59 It is a pity that D16- and D17-based devices only exhibited PCEs of 5.00% and 4.18%, respectively. Distinctly, the PCE had a downward trend as the branched point was away from the backbone, which may be attributed to the formed non-ideal blend morphology. Then, they chose a fully planar dibenzonaphthyridinedione (DBND), an isomer of isoindigo, as the electron-withdrawing unit and synthesized a wide-bandgap (Eg = 2.23 eV) polymer D18. The high crystallinity of polymer D18 led to little sensibility toward the film thickness and weight ratios of donor and acceptor and finally gave a PCE of 6.32% without the additive or annealing process. This value is also the highest PCE of the reported wide-bandgap polymers at that time. When larger π-conjugated quinacridone (QA) and dibenzo[def,mno]chrysene building blocks were used as the acceptor units, the obtained polymers D19 and D20 exhibited unsatisfactory efficiencies when paired with acceptor PC71BM.60,61 Chochos et al. designed the 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) unit and synthesized an ultralow bandgap (Eg = 1.15 eV) polymer D21. Although D21 with a unique molecular structure exhibited a low PCE of 1.10%, it showed appropriate potential in near-infrared organic electronics.62 Recently, Chen et al. developed a polymer D22 with dithienobenzoxadiazole as the electron-acceptor unit and TVT as the electron-donor unit. D22:IT-4Cl-based devices showed a PCE of 3.12%, which resulted from weak molecular packing and final poor phase separation.63
In addition to the intrinsic structure of TVT, multiple modification sites are also the main reasons for its great attention in the field of OPVs. When the TVT unit is substituted with appropriate functional groups, it can act as an electron-deficient group as shown in Fig. 5. When the N-annulated pyrrolo-perylene unit was used as the electron-donating unit, two D–A type polymers E1 and E2 possessing different alkyl chains were obtained.65 Compared with E1, E2 with longer alkyl chains showed red-shifted absorption and higher mobility because E2 adopted a more planar structure through the stronger intermolecular interaction. As expected, the E2-based device showed a PCE (4.80%) with higher JSC and FF than that of the E1-based device (PCE = 3.63%) as listed in Table 3. Schmaltz et al. polymerized TVT and para-azaquinodimethane to design a new polymer E3. Regrettably, it only showed a low PCE of 1.63% when blended therefore with PC71BM and there is a lack of systematic research.66 When a fluorine or cyano group was introduced into the 3-position of the thiophene ring of TVT, it can also act as an electron-withdrawing unit. Kim et al. synthesized three polymers E4, E5, and E6 with the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene unit as the electron-donating unit and investigated the effect of substitutions on the TVT unit.67 They found both fluorine and cyano atoms could downshift the energy level and enhance the absorption coefficient. However, the fluorine-substituted polymer E5 achieved the best PCE, and the cyano-substituted polymer E6 showed the lowest PCE whether blending with acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC) or PCBM and the unsubstituted polymer E4 afforded a moderate performance. As represented in Fig. 6, the thin-film microstructural comparisons of the polymer:ITIC and polymer:PCBM blend films reveal that the blend films of E5 showed preferential face-on orientation, which was more favorable for well-balanced hole/electron mobilities. However, E6-based blend films presented a bimodal structure, in which both edge-on and face-on orientations coexisted, which might be one of the reasons for the relatively low PCEs. In a few words, the inferior PCE of the E6-based device was ascribed to the mismatched HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the bad charge transport in organic photovoltaic devices. TVT also can be used to construct quinoidal polymers. Whereafter, Jeng and his coworkers introduced another TVT unit into thiophene on TVT on the basis of E4. Further, cyano is substituted at different positions of TVT and simplified the alkyl chain on BDT, developing two polymers E7 and E8. E8 outputted a higher PCE of 9.27% with a 0.96 V VOC, a 15.62 mA cm−2JSC, and a 61.8% FF than E7 (7.68%) when blended with PC71BM. The systematic analysis showed that cyano in different positions on TVT has a great role in molecular properties, and E8 possessed a narrower bandgap, relatively low-lying HOMO energy level, higher hole mobility, and higher degree of crystallinity.

In addition to acting as an electron-donating or electron-withdrawing unit in D–A type polymers, TVT can also be used as π bridge unit to connect electron-donating units and electron-withdrawing units. With a functionalized phenyl ring as the electron-donating unit and TPD as the electron-withdrawing unit, a D–π–A copolymer E9 was obtained by direct arylation polymerization.68 The small steric hindrance of the phenyl overcame the steric limitation between the polymer donor and acceptor and therefore led to improved intermolecular interactions. However, the low number-average molecular weight due to the low reactivity of direct arylation polymerization still restricts the PCE of devices. Besides, TVT can also be used as a side chain in D–A type polymers. In 2013, Kang et al. introduced a TVT side chain onto the 4- and 8-positions of BDT units, and designed a polymer E10. With the assistance of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the E10:PC71BM showed a PCE of 6.04% with a 0.87 V VOC due to the deep HOMO level and satisfactory blend morphology.69 In 2015, Hou et al. also used TVT-substituted BDT to design a derivative of poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7), i.e. polymer E11.70E11 exhibited an impressive PCE of 8.13% with a high JSC of 16.00 mA cm−2 when paired with fullerene acceptors. E11 exhibited compact π–π stacking, which is helpful to facilitate the interchain π-electron transport. In 2020, Tong et al. replaced the TT unit of E11 with BT or FBT and modified the alkyl chain on the TVT unit, producing two new polymers E12 and E13. Finally, E13:PC71BM-based devices exhibited a slightly higher PCE of 5.22% than E12 (4.50%) as a result of the deepened HOMO level, increased charge mobility, and better microstructural morphology.71 Meanwhile, it is easy to see that TT is better than BT in this category of polymers.
In short, TVT has been used to construct various D–A or D–π–A type copolymers with suitable electron-donating units. Most of them did not exhibit superior PCEs (<9%) because the steric hindrance and restriction in their molecular weight control of TVT-based copolymers limit the light harvesting ability and network structure formation of the blended active layer. But, several promising units such as BT, TPD, and isoindigo are expected to further improve efficiency after optimizing the length or branched point of the alkyl side chain, changing the molecular skeleton, and selecting suitable non-fullerene acceptors to combine with these copolymers. In addition, the steric hindrance of TVT-based copolymers can also be adjusted by intramolecular interactions and functional substituents. For example, noncovalent interactions such as H⋯O, S⋯O, etc. can be utilized to keep the molecular planarity. Large steric substituents can be also introduced onto the thiophene unit to achieve a rigid molecular skeleton. Based on the controlled steric hindrance, the restriction in their molecular weight can be addressed and the polymerization of TVT-based copolymers with different molecular weights becomes somewhat easier.


3.1.3 
            TVT-based terpolymers. 
Terpolymers consisting of three different comonomer units along the polymer backbone are considered as a promising candidate of the aforementioned D–A type conjugated polymers.73–76 On the one hand, by adopting different composition ratios, three different comonomer units are capable of producing various terpolymers; therefore, the physical properties of terpolymers can be regularly tuned even by small structural variations. On the other hand, the change of the monomer combination along the polymer backbone enables the terpolymers to exhibit tunable light-harvesting ability, molecular orbital energy levels, and charge transport properties which can, in turn, govern the solubility, molecular packing, and film morphology in the solid state. As we all know, great progress has been made in OPV performance due to the development of terpolymers.43,77,78 Because of the unique structure, TVT has been successfully introduced into various terpolymers to adjust the polymer configuration and obtained high device performance as shown in Fig. 7. Table 4 displayed the device's photovoltaic properties. For example, a terpolymer F1 bearing two different donor groups TVT and 1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)-selenophen-2-yl)ethane and one acceptor unit IID was designed.79 As a result, the terpolymer F1-based OPVs achieved a PCE of 4.64% with a relatively high JSC of 12.50 mA cm−2 due to the superior light-harvesting properties in the range of 350–800 nm as well as an appropriate microstructure induced by the improved miscibility between the donor and acceptor. In 2014, Zhang et al. combined the TVT–TPD building block and IID–TVT comonomers and synthesized terpolymer F2.80 In comparison with the IID unit, the relatively weaker electron-withdrawing properties of the TPD unit up-shifted the energy levels. The only alkyl side chain substituted on TPD decreased the solubility of F2 compared with F1 and thus resulted in a lower PCE than F1. Besides the aforementioned regular terpolymers, random terpolymers bearing one electron-deficient unit and two electron-donating units were also reported. Choi et al. designed random terpolymer F3via adopting the same segments DPP, bithiophene, and TVT. F3 typically preferred to adopt edge-on chain orientation on the substrate and the F3-based active layer finally achieved a high PCE of 5.24%.57

In addition to the main chain, as previously mentioned, TVT can also act as the conjugated side chain of terpolymers to form 2D terpolymers. In 2006, Hou et al. synthesized a simple terpolymer F4 containing thiophene, TVT side chain-functionalized thiophene, and alkyl chain-functionalized thiophene unit. The resulting F4-based devices exhibited a PCE of 3.18% higher than that of P3HT at that time due to stronger absorbance and the deeper HOMO level, indicating that TVT as a side chain is a practical method to improve the OPV performance. In 2012, our group designed two terpolymers (F5 and F6) by doping the tris(thienylenevinylene) conjugated side chain at the 3-position of the thiophene unit.28 The introduction of the TVT side chain into the TPD-based terpolymer F5 slightly enhanced the absorption in the range of 400–500 nm, which significantly increased JSC to 12.20 mA cm−2 and FF to 68%. The introduction of TVT into the DPP-based narrow band gap (1.1 eV) terpolymers F6 led the absorption spectrum to a longer wavelength of 1 μm and JSC to 22.65 mA cm−2, which was the highest JSC reported at that time. Compared with copolymers, these developed different terpolymers did not show better performance. As shown in Fig. 8, except for the JSC of one terpolymer-based device is higher than that of copolymer-based devices, all parameters of other terpolymer-based devices are lower than that of copolymer-based devices. And the highest PCE of terpolymer-based OPVs is only 6.46%. The results imply that ternary polymerization is not an available strategy to boom the PCE of TVT-based polymers.

3.2 
          TVT-based p-type SMs

3.2.1 SMs with TVT in the main chain. 
Compared with polymer donors, SM donors often exhibit superior properties such as good processability, high electron mobility, and excellent stability. Driven by these advantages, TVT has also been used in designing SMs. For example, Palomares et al. synthesized a small donor G1 with a central 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), TVT connecting moiety and dicyanovinylene terminal groups.82 When blended with PC71BM, the G1-based OPVs showed a PCE of 3.75%, a VOC of 1.01 V, and an FF of 63.05% after solvent vapor annealing as summarized in Table 5. For the sake of studying the influences of alkyl side chains, other five SM donors G2, G3, G4, G5, and G6 based on the central EDOT unit were synthesized, in which the terminal groups and the number of thienylenevinylene units were changed as shown in Fig. 9.83 After comparing the aforementioned six SMs, it was found that the terminal groups and the number of thienylenevinylene units have a large influence on the material photoelectric properties. First, after introducing ethylrhodanine into the terminal groups, a red-shift absorption was observed. And increasing the number of thienylenevinylene led to a broad absorption window. Both of the results can be originally ascribed to the conjugation extension, which is conducive to gaining higher JSC. Then, together introducing ethylrhodanine and increasing the number of thienylenevinylene moved the energy level up owing to their electron-donating effect and finally resulted in a lower VOC. Consequently, G4 presented the highest PCE of 4.9% and an outstanding JSC of 12 mA cm−2.

 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of SMs with the TVT unit in the main chain. 
Besides the EDOT-based SMs mentioned above, a series of high-crystallinity π-conjugation A–D–A type SMs G7, G8, G9, and G10 incorporating TVT as the central electron-donating unit and alkyl-substituted rhodanine or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-rhodanine as the terminal electron-withdrawing units were also reported.84 It was found that the change of terminal units (for G7 and G9) with the stronger electron-withdrawing units (for G8 and G10) led to an obvious bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption (λmax) by 20–30 nm and intensified intramolecular charge transfer effect. On the other hand, with the increase of π-conjugation lengths from the G7 to G9 or G8 to G10, the optical band gaps become narrower and the phase separation domain size decreased. These molecules showed superior crystalline properties in the thin films upon solvent vapor annealing process and G8 and G10 exhibited the best hole mobility close to 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Finally, both G9 and G10-based devices showed comparative PCEs of 5.8% (G9:PC71BM) and 6.0% (G10:PC71BM) under proper solvent vapor annealing treatment. In addition, Wong's group introduced a new terminal group and obtained polymer G11, which downshifted the HOMO energy level and enhanced the VOC values from 0.85 V to 0.96 V.85 However, the blue-shifted absorption spectrum decreased JSC to 4.26 mA cm−2 and PCE to 2.13% when blended with PC61BM. In order to reduce the steric and conformational constraints, they further introduced an alkyne unit as the linkage and modulated the terminal groups to construct three molecules G12, G13, and G14.85 But the narrower absorption spectra and larger nanoscale phase separation between the donor and PC61BM resulted in low JSC and FF, and final low PCE less than 2%. It is necessary to use appropriate electron-withdrawing units to construct A–D–A type SMs. Hence, Choi et al. built a new SM G15 by exploiting DPP moiety as an electron-withdrawing unit. The G15 showed a narrow range absorption and poor morphology when blended with PC61BM. Ultimately, the devices only present a low PCE of 2.21% due to low JSC.86
Besides the roles aforementioned, the TVT unit was also used as a π-bridge to construct small molecular donors. For example, Zhu et al. obtained two isomeric A–D–A type SMs G16 and G17, which contain different electron-donating units 2,6-substituted BDT (BDTx) and 4,8-substituted BDT (BDTy), same electron-withdrawing unit DPP, and the TVT bridge. Although G16 exhibited a red-shifted and enhanced absorption and better crystallinity than G17, G17 presented a higher PCE whether choosing PC61BM or PC71BM as the acceptor because of the deeper HOMO energy level, better solubility, and phase separation.87 In comparison with the state-of-the-art OPVs, the performance of both G16 and G17-based devices is still very poor. In addition, linking two TVT moieties via fusing thiophene on TVT also can gain some decent SMs. For example, Bäuerle et al. used a fused ring, 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT), to link two cyano-functionalized TVT units, gaining a series of SMs (G18–G20) via managing the side chain on TVT. After the solvent vapor annealing treatment of SMs:PC61BM, they all displayed a satisfactory morphology with an interpenetrated network of fiber, which demonstrates the formation of decent phase separation, resulting in efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Ultimately, G18, G19, and G20-based devices gained a PCE of 4.0%, 3.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, they also prepared G21 by using a TT-fused ring to link two cyano-functionalized TVT moieties. However, G21 exhibited a narrow absorption range, and poor phase separation with PC61BM, leading to a poor performance (PCE = 1.7%). Of note is that the G21-based devices present a high VOC of 1.06 V due to their low-lying HOMO level.88
In short, in these A–D–A type donor molecules, whether TVT is the central electron-donating unit or the bridge between D and A units, the designed molecules performed very poorly in the fullerene system, mainly because both JSC and FF of devices are quite low. The highest PCE is close to 5%, and most of them present a PCE of less than 3%, which might originate from the poor molecular packing caused by the steric hindrance of TVT in the main chain.


3.2.2 SMs with TVT in the side chain. 

TVT can be attached to the main chain of SMs, besides, the TVT unit has also been attached to the side chain in order to modulate the solution processability, optical absorption, energy level, molecular packing as well as the miscibility with the combined component. Among the reported SMs, TVT mainly acted as the 2D conjugated side chain of the BDT unit, as shown in Fig. 10. The device performance is summarized in Table 6. For example, Zhang's group reported an A–D–A type medium-bandgap SM donor H1 with BDT as the core and two diketopyrrolopyrrole moieties as the terminal electron-withdrawing units.89 The alkylated TVT side chain slightly downshifted the HOMO level and enhanced the optical absorption, thus increasing both VOC and JSC simultaneously. Finally, the binary OPVs based on H1:2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC) blend afforded a PCE of 5.48%, and the ternary devices based on the H1:IDIC:PC61BM ternary device achieved a high PCE of 6.55%. When they utilized an alkylated TVT-substituted BDT as the central unit, and two 3-ethylrhodanine units as the terminal electron-withdrawing groups, other two molecules H2, and H3 were obtained. These two molecules exhibited complementary absorption, appropriate energy levels, and optimal blend morphology with two very different acceptors PC71BM and IDIC. Finally, almost the same PCE exceeding over 6.50% was obtained.90 Besides, Min et al. synthesized a complicated p-type SM H4, in which BDT with the TVT side chain as an electron-donating unit, fluorinated BT as an electron-withdrawing unit, and the cyano end-capped with carboxylate acted as the end group.91 Consequently, the H4-based devices not only achieved a high PCE of 11.20% but also showed fine photo and thermal stabilities due to the increased molecular crystallinity, higher hole mobility, and reduced phase aggregation. However, the counterpart polymer PBTTBO-BT without TVT exhibited a slightly lower PCE of 9.73%.

Comparing molecules with TVT in the main chain and side chain, it is not difficult to find that the SMs with TVT in the side chain easily increase the effective conjugation length, achieve ordered intermolecular stacking, induce π-electron delocalization better in TVT side groups and thus slightly downshift the molecular HOMO level to achieve higher VOC. Besides, it is beneficial to form a suitable phase separation structure with fullerenes, thereby showing higher performance, especially boosting the FF of the devices. Most of them delivered PCE of over 5% and the highest PCE reached 11%, which is distinctly higher than that of SMs with TVT units in the main chain. It's important to note that four TVT-based SMs with TVT units in the side chain were used to combine with FA and NFA, simultaneously. Through comparing photovoltaic performance, we identified the main characteristics of FA or NFA-based OPVs. For example, the NFA-based OPVs generally showed higher JSC than the FA-based ones due to the stronger photo response in the near-infrared region. In addition, the NFA-based OPVs would present better performance when the microstructures were accurately controlled by some post-processing methods. In view of this case, the development of TVT-based SMs compatible with non-fullerene acceptors is highly promising.

        TVT-based n-type materials
As we have seen, TVT has been used to construct many kinds of polymer or SM donors in which TVT serves as donor or acceptor moiety according to the substituted electron-donating units as well as the connecting building blocks. As a typical electron-donating unit, the TVT unit can also be coupled with strong electron-withdrawing building blocks such as NDI and PDI to form polymers or SM acceptors. These materials show excellent performance and great potential, but there are still some areas for improvement. In addition, all-polymer OPVs have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for practical applications because of their excellent thermal and mechanical stabilities; therefore, it is important to develop highly efficient n-type polymers. In this part, we will introduce TVT-based polymers and SMs reported as acceptors in OPVs.
4.1 n-Type polymers
PDI and NDI units have been widely used in many n-type conjugated polymers due to their appropriate energy levels, high electron mobility, and good light absorption ability.92,93 However, the excessive aggregation of the planar NDI or PDI skeleton structure usually resulted in worse phase separation in the blend films. Because of bond rotation properties, TVT is a good choice for copolymerization with NDI or PDI to effectively reduce the aggregation induced by NDI or PDI, adjust the energy level, and balance the crystallinity and miscibility with the donor. As shown in Fig. 11, many D–A type polymers containing TVT have been reported. For example, Chen's group in 2016 synthesized a polymer K1 with an NDI unit as the electron-withdrawing unit and a TVT unit as the electron-donating group.94 When blended with donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th), the fabricated devices exhibited a PCE of 2.94% with a VOC of 0.80 V, a JSC of 7.41 mA cm−2 and an FF of 49.9% as listed in Table 7. When the alkyl chains attached to the NDI unit were lengthened, polymer K2 exhibited an improved PCE to 6.43% with poly[4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]-triazole] (J51) as the donor.22 The obviously improved JSC and FF are mainly due to the formation of a well-mixed morphology with better charge-transport pathways in the D:A blend film. In 2014, Huang et al. introduced an alkoxy substituent group into the TVT unit and obtained polymer K3.95 The O⋯S conformation locks between the alkoxyl groups and the sulfur atom of thiophenes enhanced the macromolecular planarity. Although the PCE of PTB7:K3 BHJ solar cells was only 1.70%, K3 exhibited high ambipolar mobilities in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) with an electron-mobility of 5.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole-mobility of 3.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which were the highest mobilities for all-polymer OTFTs at that time. Due to the high electron affinity of NDI, the LUMO orbitals of NDI-based polymers are often largely localized on the NDI units, which would hinder efficient intermolecular electron transport.96,97 Kim et al. carried out a study to explore the influence of the dipole moment on the charge generation by introducing cyano onto the TVT unit of polymers K4 and K5.98K4 with shorter side chain showed larger dipole moment and more delocalized LUMO energy levels, which finally promoted the exciton dissociation and electron transport. When poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-5-octyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione] (PBDTTTPD) was selected as the donor, K4-based devices showed a higher PCE of 7.4%, while K5-based devices exhibited a relatively low PCE of 6.5%. Moreover, the device performance of TVT-based polymer acceptors can also be adjusted by introducing some electron-deficient substituents onto the thiophene of the TVT building block. For instance, Park et al. synthesized a copolymer K6 after copolymerizing fluorinated TVT with NDI.23 Because K6 showed a smaller crystal domain size and a well-mixed morphology induced by the fluorination, the PCE was increased from 5.11% to 7.14%. Subsequently, Kim et al. synthesized an analogue of K6via utilizing an asymmetric fluorination strategy, named K7. And they selected PTB7-Th as the donor to combine K6 and K7, respectively. K7 showed a weakened molecular aggregation and good miscibility with PTB7-Th. Therefore, the K7-based devices delivered a higher PCE (4.6%) than K6-based devices (4.3%).99 Besides, Kim et al. designed a chlorinated polymer K8, achieving a modest PCE of 5.78%.100 Evidently, all the halogenated derivatives displayed higher performance than halogen-free polymers. As mentioned before the photovoltaic parameters of terpolymers could be finely tuned through adjusting the component ratio by simply varying the monomer feed ratio during synthesis.101 In 2017, Xu's group synthesized a series of random terpolymers K9, K10, K11, and K12 based on the TVT unit and two NDI units modified with different branched alkyl side chains.102 Though those copolymers showed similar energy levels and absorption spectra, the active layer showed enormously different morphology with different monomer proportions. As a result, K10 with 90% 2-octyldodecyl substituted NDI component exhibited an optimal morphology and the highest PCE of 4.55% when combined with donor polymer PTB7-Th. In the same year, Chen's group introduced the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit as another electron-rich moiety and synthesized five terpolymers K13, K14, K15, K16, and K17.103 They simultaneously used TT and TVT donor units which afforded better backbone coplanarity of these terpolymers, thereby reducing the packing distance and promoting the long-range ordering, and thus increasing the charge carrier mobility. By reasonably tuning the ratios of TT and TVT electron-rich moieties, the surface roughness and morphology of the blend films were gradually optimized. Consequently, the optimized device prepared with PTB7-Th:terpolymer displayed improved PCE when the TVT ratio in the copolymer backbone increased from 0 to 75%, which was attributed to the increased JSC. The solar cells prepared with blend PTB7-Th:K16 with the TVT ratio of 0.75 showed the highest PCE of 5.27%. However, further increases in the TVT ratio to 100% (K17) led to a reduced PCE owing to the obviously decreased JSC.

PDI as another typical n-type unit has been widely used to synthesize various organic semiconductors with good light-harvesting properties, thermal and chemical stability, and strong electron-accepting ability.104,105 However, the analogue PDI unit similar to the NDI unit also tends to aggregate during blending with the other active material. During the development of PDI-based materials, the TVT unit played a significant role in adjusting their photovoltaic performance. In 2015, Zhan et al. first designed and synthesized a polymer K18 with TVT as the electron-rich unit and PDI as the electron-deficient unit.106 The narrow absorption spectrum and largely aggregated domains resulted in a low PCE of 1.0% when blended with donor poly[[4,8-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2-(2′-ethyl-hexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl]] (PBDTTT-C-T). They furthermore incorporated a cyano in the TVT moiety and obtained the other polymer K19. Compared with K18, K19 exhibited lower LUMO and HOMO energy levels while retaining a planar molecular backbone. As a result, the K19-based BHJ solar cell gave a PCE of 1.74% when blended with PTB7-Th.107
Except for cooperating with NDI and PDI, TVT also can combine with quinoxaline (Qx) derivatives. In 2021, Kim et al. synthesized a new polymer K20via copolymerization of cyano-functionalized Qx and the TVT moiety. The desirable planarity of Qx endowed K20 with enhanced intra- and inter-molecular interaction, resulting in increased charge transport capacity. After combining poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thien-yl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) with K20, the devices present a PCE of 3.54%. Meanwhile, a VOC of 1.00 V was achieved owing to the high LUMO level of K20.108 Besides cooperating with other moieties, TVT also can be used as the linkage unit in polymerized small molecule acceptors. In 2021, Huang and his co-workers developed a polymer K21via polymerizing a Y-series acceptor and TVT unit. The π-extended coplanar backbone afforded K21 high crystalline and ordered π–π stacking with smaller dπ–π and larger CCL, thus obtaining an excellent charge transport capacity. In consequence, the JD40:K21-based devices achieved an impressive PCE of 16.13% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 23.75 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.4%. Of note is that the polymerized target product displayed outstanding shelf-life stability (88% of its initial PCE left after storage for 6647 h) and light-soaking stability (5% light-induced losses after 1300 h under illumination with a light intensity of ≈100 mW cm−2).109
In these aforementioned TVT-based polymer acceptors, NDI or PDI was mainly used as the electron-deficient unit and TVT was used as the electron-rich unit. The main role that TVT played is to lead to better coplanarity of the polymer backbone, reduce the packing distance between the polymer chains, promote long-range ordering, and thus finally increase the charge carrier mobility in the blended films. However, all these TVT-based n-type polymers utilized for all-polymer OPVs presented inferior device performance of less than 8%. The main reasons for these results are as follows. Firstly, the steric hindrance in the bay position of NDI and PDI restricts the control of polymerization. Secondly, the narrower absorption window and lower absorption coefficient hinder the photon utilization of devices. Thirdly, the large phase-separated domain and inhomogeneous phase composition impede charge separation and transport. Finally, the relatively low μe (on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and unbalanced μe/μh limit the enhancement of JSC and FF. Of note is that polymer K21 based on the Y-series small molecular acceptor using TVT as the linkage unit can effectively address the above issues. The obtained PCE over 16% based on polymer acceptor K21 is a high value in the all-polymer OPV field. The result implies that TVT has great potential to achieve exceptional polymers with excellent stability and more research can be done in this field.
4.2 n-Type SMs
As disused above, when two bulky PDI or NDI moieties were directly linked, the obtained molecules usually showed twisted dimer structures, which led to serious aggregation in the BHJ blend. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate a linker between two PDI or NDI units to disrupt the excessive aggregation and preserve the charge transport properties via effective π–π stacking. In 2015, Zhan's group reported a rigid SM L1 (as shown in Fig. 12), which is composed of TVT as a linker between two PDI units.106 The rotational TVT unit made the PDI dimer present a twisted structure, thus disrupting the excessive aggregation of PDI dimers in the PBDTTT-C-T:L1 blend films. Meanwhile, the suitable π–π stacking facilitates effective charge transport properties. However, the larger phase separation and bigger root-mean-square (RMS) in the blend film result in an ultimate low PCE of 0.69% (as listed in Table 7). Later, Hwang and his coworkers introduced different substituted TVT segments and modified the alkyl chains on amide and bay positions to shed light on the role of substituents, generating the SMs L2–L4. According to a series of research, as can be seen that cyano-substituted L4 exhibited a high absorption coefficient, efficient charge transport, and predominant face-on molecular stacking. After blending with PTB7-Th, the L4-based devices displayed a nearly double PCE of 4.32% than L2 and L3.110 Kim et al. coupled two cyano-functionalized NDI units with TVT and synthesized an NDI dimer L5.20 When 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (DTS-F) was selected as the donor, DTS-F:L5 based all-SM OPVs exhibited a promising PCE of 3.01%. Besides those common electron-deficient building blocks, TVT was also utilized in the bis(naphthalene-imide)arylenelidenes-based SM acceptors, affording molecule L6. Under the optimized conditions, the PBDB-T:L6-based solar cells showed a high VOC of 1.12 V and a PCE of 4.80%.111 Although the aforementioned dimerized small-molecule acceptors all present a poor performance, they possess some merits, such as more strongly developed crystalline structures, and better thermal and morphological stability. Therefore, recently, Kim and his co-workers utilized TVT to link two Y-series acceptors to design the new acceptor L7. TVT linker endowed L7 with high crystallinity, charge mobility, high Tg, and low diffusion coefficients at 85 °C. Consequently, the devices delivered an impressive PCE of 17.60% and outstanding stability with a t80% lifetime of 4005 h.112
 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of TVT-based SM acceptors. 
In summary, the SMs tended to exhibit hindered extensive aggregation and displayed effective π–π stacking, thereby the suitable domains with crystalline structures facilitated charge transport in the blend films and yielded higher performance when TVT was used as the linker between two bulky units. The TVT linker also gives the target material a stronger absorption spectrum and higher charge mobility due to the prolonged conjugation of TVT groups. When the segments which the TVT linker connects with are Y-series acceptor units, the obtained n-type small molecules exhibited better photovoltaic performance. This tendency is similar to that of TVT-based n-type polymers. The PCEs over 16% presented by both TVT-based n-type SMs and polymers containing the Y-series acceptor imply that the combination of TVT and Y-series acceptor is an effective strategy to achieve high-performance n-type materials.
5. Fused-TVT derivatives
Compared to non-fused materials, the fusion of adjacent aromatic rings often affords several distinctive merits. For example, the highly planar backbone and extended π-conjugation can improve electron delocalization, thus leading to a reduced bandgap and broadened absorption. The larger π-conjugation can also strengthen the intermolecular electron couplings and thereby induce closer π–π stacking between neighboring molecules, which benefits the intermolecular charge transport. The rotational freedom of compounds can be greatly suppressed by the fusion strategy, therefore resulting in enhanced intramolecular charge transport. Driven by these intriguing properties including narrow bandgap, broad absorption, and high charge transport, we devoted great research endeavors to the fused-TVT structures. The fused TVT unit (ETVT) can be reckoned as the benzene or thiophene-embedded TVT derivatives, as shown in Fig. 13. The summary of polymer properties and device performance can be achieved in Table 8. Compared with the non-fused PTVTTBT, the ring fusion of the ETVT segment not only downshifted the HOMO energy level but also increased the absorption coefficient of M1.34 In addition, the energy loss of the M1:ITIC system was estimated to be about 0.67 eV approaching to the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV, which is one of the lowest values of TVT derivatives at that time. Furthermore, prolonging the length of side chains and adding new alkyls into the ETVT unit increased the solubility of two polymers M2 and M3.36 However, the steric hindrance caused by the additional octyl group on the ETVT unit affected the planarity and conjugation of the polymer, thus resulting in the blue-shifted absorption spectrum. In addition, the introduction of alkyls into the ETVT unit further downshifted the HOMO energy levels and reduced the energy loss. Finally, the M3-based solar cells achieved a high VOC of 1.03 V whether blended with PC71BM or ITIC. Hence, the ring fusion of the TVT unit for donor polymers is an effective strategy to enhance VOC and decrease energy loss.

Besides the electron-deficient unit BT, the ETVT unit was also utilized to copolymerize with NDI to obtain D–A type copolymer acceptors M4 and M5. With regard to the polymer M4, the asymmetric thienylene–benzothiophene (T-BTh) unit can be considered as the evolution of the ETVT unit from the ring-fused TVT unit.113 When blended with PBDB-T, the M4-based all-PSC realized the highest PCE of 5.99% due to the favorable face-on molecular orientation, high molecular weight, fiber-like blend film morphology, and relatively balanced hole and electron mobilities. In addition, introducing sulfur atoms into the TVT unit and fusing the ethylene unit obtained the T-TT unit. When copolymerized with an NDI unit, the polymer M5 exhibited a larger absorption coefficient, higher electron mobility, and smaller π–π stacking distance with an obvious face-on orientation, compared with poly[(E)-2,7-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-4-methyl-9-(5-(2-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[lmn][3,8] phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone] (PNDI-TVT).37 When blended with PBDB-T and J71, the M5-based all-PSC achieved a largely enhanced PCE, which is attributed to the accelerated charge generation and transport.
In addition, the ETVT was also used to construct A–D–A type SMs. Cheng et al. developed an all-fused TVT derivative dithienocyclopentapyran (DTCP), with which as the electron-donor they obtained an A–D–A type narrow-bandgap molecule M6.114 When PBDB-T was selected as the donor, the devices delivered a decent PCE of 9.32%. Recently, Zhu et al. developed another two all-fused TVT building blocks, 4,8-dihydropentaleno[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (PDT) and 4,8-dihydropentaleno[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (PDTT) when they were end-capped by two 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DFIC) groups, generating two SMs M7 and M8.115 The absorption range of M8 is wider than M7 owing to the stronger electron-donating character of PDTT, but both of them display NIR photoresponsivity. Therefore, when blended with the donor poly((4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl(5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-1,3-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl) (PM6), M7 and M8 achieved a JSC of 21.68 and 25.90 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition, the PM6:M8 blend film possessed a large-scale phase separation and slight self-aggregation. Consequently, M8 delivered a PCE of 10.70%, which is higher than that of M7 (7.84%). Compared to other types of SMs, M6–M8 make it necessary to further investigate the relationship between the molecular backbone and the performance.
When adopting fused TVT-based polymer donors, compared with the systems with fullerene as the acceptor, fusion significantly reduces the energy loss of devices fabricated with non-fullerene as the acceptor. The above results show that ring fusion can significantly reduce the energy loss of the fused TVT-based materials, which is of significant aspect that needs to be improved for enhancing the photovoltaic properties of TVT materials. Although the preliminary results have been obtained by mastering the relationship between the structure and property, the reason and mechanism of the decrease of energy loss in the system are still unclear. And there are few kinds of fused TVT polymer materials, and the PCEs were still not ideal. In addition, both the devices using fused TVT-based SMs and polymers present a non-ideal PCE of less than 10%. Therefore, there is still much room to explore the new fused TVT-based photovoltaic materials and study the correlations of molecular structure–photophysical properties–photovoltaic performance.

        TVT-based materials containing carboxylate
Besides the TVT-based materials mentioned in previous sections, there is also a kind of typical material containing the carboxylate-substituted TVT unit. As shown in Fig. 14, these materials commonly achieved good performance with high VOC, JSC, and FF, simultaneously. Therefore, we concluded all these carboxylic carboxylate (COOR)-substituted TVT-based materials would play a significant role in the further development of OPVs. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 9.

In 2009, Li et al. introduced a carboxylate group into the TVT unit and obtained polymer N1, which showed a significantly increased PCE by ten times to 2.01% with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 5.47 mA cm−2 and an FF of 42.8% (as displayed in Table 9).41 It is worth mentioning that N1 is the first polymer comprising carboxylate-substituted TVT. The work proved that carboxylate can increase the photoluminescence and lifetime of the excited state and create an effective charge transfer due to its electron-withdrawing effect. It is worth noting that the increased photoluminescence may originate from the reduction of nonradiative relaxation pathways. The discovery may be useful to help researchers to comprehend the relationship between carboxylate and energy loss.
To meet the need to reduce material costs, Hou et al. synthesized a low-cost polymer N2 by copolymerizing TVT and vinylene.116 In comparison with the analogous polymer containing methyl-substituted TVT, the introduction of carboxylate formed a better planar conformation in favor of forming high molecular regularity and ordered packing, thus showing largely enhanced charge carrier mobility. And the enhanced electron push–pull effect by carboxylate and non-covalent interaction between the oxygen on the carboxylate group and the hydrogen on the vinylene bond effectively promotes intramolecular charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 15, the calculated results proved that the energy barrier from the stable state to the meta-stable state for the carboxylate materials is much higher than the methyl one; therefore, the carboxylate-substituted PTVs are more inclined to form a planar configuration than the alkyl-substituted ones. Therefore, TVT-based materials with carboxylate exhibited great potential to achieve high JSC and FF, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art OPVs. However, the formation of relatively larger phase separation in N2:2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (BO-4Cl) blend film finally led to a low PCE of 6.44%. In the next year, they further optimized the PTV structure by introducing a thiophene substituent into the TVT unit and modulating the alkyl side chains of the carboxylate unit.32 As a result, the twisting conformation was locked by the intramolecular O⋯H non-covalent interaction, and the successfully obtained polymer N3 exhibited a strong aggregation behavior in the solution state and wide absorption spectrum. After blending N3 with three representative acceptors, including PC71BM, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F), and BTP-eC9, very different PCEs of 7.25%, 11.28%, and 16.20% were obtained. The highest PCE of 16.20% is also the best record for PTVs, which is ascribed to the excellent JSC of 26.22 mA cm−2 and FF of 78.0% of N3:BTP-eC9 devices. They confirmed that carboxylate can increase the quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL), leading to a low non-radiative energy loss which is comparable with the star polymer donors of the moment. Geng et al. introduced 2,2′-bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene into the TVT-based copolymers and designed two polymers N4 and N5.117 When PC71BM was selected as the acceptor, the N4-based devices achieved higher PCE of 6.25% than N5-based devices (PCE = 5.53%) due to the compact π–π stacking and appropriate nano-fibrillar morphology. Furthermore, Hou et al. fabricated N4:BTP-eC9-based devices and obtained a high PCE of up to 16.31%, which is an impressive value for TVT-based devices.118 And then they confirmed that N4-based devices possess high hole mobility (1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and EQEEL. The EQEEL of devices reflects low non-radiative energy loss. Meanwhile, they introduced BTA3 into the N4:BTP-eC9 binary blend and improved the PCE from 16.31% to 16.81%. The higher PCE of the ternary device originates from the simultaneous increase of JSC and FF.

When combined with a large electron-donating BDT unit, there have been reported two typical polymers N6 and N7 containing carboxylate substituted TVT units. Compared with polymer N6 with an alkyl chain substituent on the BDT unit,119 polymer N7 developed by Zhang et al. has sulfanyl substituents on BDT.120 When blended with the non-fullerene acceptors ITOIC-2F or IT-4F, both N6 and N7 presented PCEs of more than 10%. The results imply that the introduced carboxylate with strong electron-withdrawing ability can adjust the energy level, and accelerate the formation of desirable morphology and molecular packing. Chen et al. used difluorobenzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (FTAZ) and benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) as the electron-deficient units and achieved polymers N8 and N9, respectively. Compared with polymer N9, the larger dihedral angle between the carboxylate-substituted TVT unit and bulky BDD acceptor unit implied that N9 has better coplanarity, which facilitates the π–π stacking and charge transport. The stronger electron affinity of the BDD unit than FTAZ leads to a lower energy level of N8 than N9. As a result, N9-based devices delivered a higher PCE of 11.5% than N8 (8.56%) when IT-4F was used as the acceptor.121 These results indicate that when the carboxylate was located at the TVT unit of polymers, excellent PCEs can be obtained whether paired with fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors.
In summary, carboxylate-substituted TVT mainly shows two advantages. One is the good solubility and molecular packing in the solid film provided by the blanched alkyl chain on the carboxylate unit. The other is the reduced steric hindrance and thus improved planarity of molecules. Such structure is expected to deepen the HOMO energy level which may be beneficial to reduce voltage loss, enhance the light absorption and facilitate charge transport which may lead to improved JSC and FF of devices. In addition, the ternary strategy has been considered as an efficient method to enhance the device performance through different mechanisms such as charge transfer, energy transfer, parallel linkage, or alloy model.122–126 Although only one study about TVT-based ternary devices has been reported, the improved PCE indicates that the ternary strategy is applicable to TVT-based devices.
What is worth mentioning is that the p-type materials combining TVT with carboxylate afford a significantly higher PCE (half of the devices have PCE of more than 10%) than the counterparts without carboxylate whether selecting fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. Importantly, the VOC values are mainly distributed between 0.8 and 1.0 V, which are higher than those of the counterparts. That is because carboxylate is easy to gain a low-lying HOMO level due to the electron-withdrawing effect and increases the EQEEL to reduce the non-radiative energy loss. These results demonstrate that introducing carboxylate onto TVT-based materials is a feasible strategy to achieve high-performance photovoltaic polymers. However, relevant studies are very limited and there is still much room for improvement. In a word, introducing carboxylate is an effective molecular engineering to optimize TVT-based photovoltaic materials.
7. Conclusion and outlook
In view of the development of TVT-based materials in BHJ OPVs and their recently excellent performance, we summarized TVT-containing photovoltaic materials as electron donors or electron acceptors in order to get more valuable information for future molecular design. In this review, we analyzed the correlation between chemical structures, optoelectronic properties, and device performance. TVT-based materials are simply classified into four categories: TVT-type donor, TVT-type acceptor, fused-TVT derivatives, and TVT-based materials containing the carboxylate group. In these materials, the TVT unit can act as both an electron-donating unit and an electron-withdrawing unit depending on the substituents on TVT and the connection units. Besides the backbone, TVT can be also utilized on the side chain of materials. No matter where it is located, TVT could not only regulate the absorption properties and energy levels but also modulate both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, thus adjusting the molecular packing and film morphology. After device optimization, the PCE of TVT-type polymer donor with carboxylate group has been improved up to 16% in N3 and N4-based devices with eC9 as the acceptor due to the appropriate phase separation and enhanced charge mobility. Because carboxylate is easy to gain a low-lying HOMO level due to the electron-withdrawing effect, the EQEEL of the device was obviously increased and thus the non-radiative energy loss was reduced. However, the PCE of most other-type TVT-based materials is basically below 10%. The poor molecular stacking resulting from the steric hindrance of TVT is one critical factor limiting the morphology of the blended film, which finally impacts the device JSC and FF. Another critical factor limiting the device performance is the low VOC (at a level of ∼0.8 V) of most TVT-based materials. Therefore, the molecular packing behavior and energy loss of TVT-based OPVs should be focused on for understanding their potential in optoelectronic applications.
Therefore, to further enhance the PCE and decrease the energy loss, the principal task is to adjust the molecular structure to increase the absorption spectrum and optimize the blend film morphology. From the previous reports discussed in this review, it can be seen that there are many strategies to modulate the π-conjugated backbone, heteroatom substitution, and side chains to obtain excellent device performance. Side-chain engineering including adjustment of the side chain length, branched point, and substitution position plays an important role in modulating the intermolecular and intramolecular interaction. The suitable side chain can also endow the TVT-based materials with good solubility for purification and excellent solution processability. For example, the conjugated thiophene side chain on the 3-position intensively improved the rigidity of backbones and decreased the bandgaps compared with the alkyl side chain. However, the longer thiophene side chain was unfavorable to optimal domain size for effective exciton dissociation and charge transportation. Therefore, suitable side chains attached to the TVT unit are expected to improve the PCE.
Besides, carboxylate played a significant role in the TVT-based materials, such as increasing the conjugation of molecules to strengthen the molecule aggregation, promoting the intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer due to the electron push–pull effect and non-covalent interaction, and suppressing the energy loss caused from its's luminescent effect. As shown in Fig. 16, carboxylate-based materials present unique merits in photovoltaic parameters compared to other TVT-based materials. Firstly, we find that the materials which can output a PCE of over 10% are mainly carboxylate-based polymers and the highest PCE is up to 16.31%, which is catching up with the classic photovoltaic polymers. Secondly, there are also two n-type materials based on high-efficient Y-series acceptors which can gain extraordinary performance. However, other materials present a low PCE even though a fraction of them can achieve a similarly high VOC. Next, carboxylate-based materials are easier to acquire satisfactory FF and JSC, simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 14, most devices with FF > 60% and JSC > 15 mA cm−2 are carboxylate-based materials. Besides, most carboxylate-based materials are p-type polymers, further utilization of TVT-containing carboxylate to synthesize n-type materials is expected.
 Fig. 16  (a) PCE against VOC and (b) FF against JSC scatter diagram of the reported TVT-based binary OPVs. 
Here, we propose several methods to achieve higher performance for TVT-based materials. Firstly, the number of carboxylates can increase appropriately to manage the molecular crystallinity and characteristics of luminescence. And then, the length of the alkyl chain on carboxylate can further modulate to explore the other potential possibilities. Last but not least, carboxylate should be introduced into other-type TVT-based materials (p-type SMs, n-type polymers, n-type SMs, etc.). We believe that these designs about carboxylate can further improve the device performance through influencing the phase separation, charge mobility, and non-radiative energy loss. To sum up, the efficiency of OPVs based on TVT-containing materials could be further increased by modifying TVT units, selecting suitable coupling units, and managing the carboxylate as well as exploring new use of TVT in photovoltaic materials.
