Devices constructed using these architectures showed a power conversion efficiency of 4.12%, which is the highest among the SnO2 nanostructures grown on conducting substrates by wet chemical methods.
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising third generation photovoltaic devices, which recently have shown a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency above 12%.1 DSSCs, in general, are composed of a nanocrystalline wide band-gap semiconducting oxide on a transparent conducting substrate, a sensitizing dye, a redox shuttle for regeneration of the dye and a catalytic counter electrode.2 Various metal oxides like TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, Nb2O5etc. so far have been used as a porous layer for dye attachment and carrier transport.3 Among them, tin oxide (SnO2) is one of the most promising candidates, as it has high electrical conductivity and electron mobility (240 cm2 V−1 s−1).4 Despite these facts, it has shown moderate power conversion efficiencies as compared to TiO2 and ZnO. This is mainly attributed to its lower conduction band position, which affords low open circuit potential and subsequent traps acting as recombination centres. Various strategies have been applied to overcome these limitations by coating its surface with other metal oxides like ZnO, TiO2, MgO, Al2O3etc. with improved power conversion efficiencies.5 Different types of nanostructures like nanowires,6 hollow spheres,7 nanofibres,8 nanooctahedra3detc. have also been applied to improve power conversion efficiencies and have shown promising results. However, all of the methods produce nanostructures in powder form and have to be applied on FTO substrates, which makes further processing and scalability difficult. A variety of chemical methods have been reported in the literature for the fabrication of well ordered nanostructures of ZnO and TiO2 on FTO substrates,3a–c,9 whereas scalable methods for direct deposition of SnO2 on conducting substrates are scarce.10
Herein, we report for the first time, deposition of well ordered nanowall structures of SnO2 on FTO substrates at low temperature from ethanol solution. We further modified these structures with TiO2 nanoneedles by simple TiCl4 treatment. When used in dye sensitized solar cells, these structures showed excellent photovoltaic properties. Despite low thickness (∼3.2 μm), the electrodes showed power conversion efficiencies up to 4.12%, which is the highest among the SnO2 electrodes, directly deposited onto FTO substrates by the chemical solution deposition method. A systematic investigation of interfacial kinetics in the system is done by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage decay measurements.
All chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purifications. The tin oxide nanowall-array electrodes were prepared by the solution deposition method onto FTO substrates. The FTO substrates used for deposition were firstly cleaned with detergent solution, then with isopropanol and acetone solution by ultrasonication, dried in air and treated in ozone for 10 min. Two substrates of the size 7.5 × 2.5 cm were dipped in falcon tubes containing deposition solution of 0.3 M tin(IV) chloride and 0.9 M thioacetamide in ethanol. The solution was heated at 70 °C for 3 h. After completion of deposition, substrates were removed from the tubes and washed with ethanol, dried and annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. For nanoneedle growth, substrates were dipped in 0.01 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for a desired period of time. Then the substrates were removed and washed with water and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. For dye loading, electrodes were dipped in a 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile–ethanol for 18 h and later were taken off, washed with ethanol and stored in the dark prior to measurements.
SEM images of the pristine and TiO2 nanoneedles coated SnO2 nanowall electrodes are shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2a it is clear that walls are well interconnected with each other like a spider-web network. This type of interconnection can be beneficial over nanoparticle electrodes, where charges have to clear grain boundaries for passing from one particle to the other. Ordered growth of nanowalls can be seen from a cross-sectional image (Fig. S1†). By taking several trials, we optimized the temperature for nanowall growth (70 °C), above which the nanowall films were not uniform and were covered with bulky precipitate, whereas at lower temperatures the growth was not uniform and walls were not interconnected. TiCl4 treatment of these nanowall electrodes affords full coverage of nanowalls with TiO2 nanoneedles (Fig. 2b, d, S2†). The nanoneedle growth occurred only when the concentration of TiCl4 was maintained at 0.01 M, above which growth of bulky particles can be seen (Fig. S3†). X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 3a) show that the nanowalls are polycrystalline in nature (JCPDS card no. 41-1445). Crystallite size calculated from Scherer's formula is found to be 18 nm. The XRD pattern of TiO2 coated SnO2 nanowalls shows reflections from rutile-TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 34-0180) indicating the crystallinity of nanoneedles.

The {110} reflections from SnO2 and TiO2 are overlapping each other. Thus from SEM and XRD measurements it can be concluded that each of the nanocrystallites from SnO2 nanowalls acts as a nucleation centre for the growth of TiO2 nanoneedle structures. Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the ball and stick model of SnO2 and TiO2 unit cells to help the visualization of the two crystals, and their interface (Sn in red, Ti in dark grey, O in light grey). The lattice parameters for the rutile SnO2 are a = b = 0.474 nm and c = 0.318 nm and for TiO2a = b = 0.459 nm and c = 0.315 nm. For these the {110} mismatch is 3%.11 Raman analysis of the samples is shown in Fig. 3b. Pure SnO2 shows a peak at 633 cm−1 corresponding to the A1g mode.2c TiO2 nanoneedles show peaks at 434 and 605 cm−1 corresponding to Eg and A1g modes of vibrations.13 EDX analysis of the samples shown in Fig. S4† indicates the presence of Ti along with Sn and O elements confirming the presence of SnO2 along with TiO2. This type of porous and fully interconnected architecture with high surface area can be useful in a variety of optoelectronic devices where high surface area, good connectivity along with porosity is a prerequisite for high performance. In particular, in dye-sensitized solar cells, dye adsorption and light absorption are strongly influenced by aggregation of the material used. Also, the in-depth penetration of electrolyte is important for complete regeneration of oxidized dye molecules. Porous material with good interconnectivity can be useful in this sense, as it can allow complete electrolyte access and its interconnections provide a continuous path for charge carriers.

We further fabricated dye sensitized solar cells using our architectures. Fig. 4a represents current–voltage characteristics of the devices recorded under 1 Sun illumination. Pristine SnO2 nanowall electrodes showed poor Voc and fill factor values. This is common in SnO2 based photo-anodes where recombination of conduction band electrons with oxidized dye molecules and I3− in the electrolyte is faster than the dye regeneration process by the redox shuttle.5 To overcome these limitations various metal oxide surface treatments have been reported in the literature. Best results, so far, have been obtained for TiO2 treatment. TiCl4 treatment of the samples generally improves surface area, thereby improving the amount of dye adsorbed and removes defects. Also, as the conduction band position of TiO2 is higher than SnO2, an efficient energy cascade is formed, which favours charge separation and suppresses recombination. In the present case TiO2 needles grown on the surface of SnO2 improved dye adsorption (surface area increase) as evident from UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S5†), due to which current density jumped to 14 mA cm−2 for the sample in which TiO2 nanoneedles were grown for 40 min. Also, open circuit potential improved from 412 to 649 mV, suggesting that TiO2 needles effectively block the back flow of electrons from the SnO2 conduction band to the redox shuttle. Overall power conversion efficiency jumped from 1 to 4.12% (Table 1), which is the highest efficiency so far among the chemically deposited SnO2 nanostructures on conducting substrates. Despite low thickness (3.2 μm), short circuit current density is high in our samples, indicating that SnO2 cores rapidly transport the photogenerated electrons to FTO with less chances of recombination. To further test our hypothesis, impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage decay measurements were performed. Impedance spectra of DSSCs show two semicircles; a small semicircle in the high frequency range corresponds to the interface between Pt and electrolyte while a big semicircle in the low frequency range corresponds to transport in the SnO2–dye-photoanode. It is clear from Fig. 4c that charge transfer resistance decreases considerably upon growth of TiO2 nanoneedles and electrons can easily flow through the system, which agrees closely with J–V results. Also series resistance decreased upon TiCl4 treatment, which indicates that TiO2 helps to make good contact to FTO. Frequency at the highest point in the second semicircle is related to electron lifetime. A lower value of frequency corresponds to higher electron lifetime,7 in the pristine SnO2 sample this value is 7.79 Hz while in the TiO2 nanoneedles coated sample it is 3.91 Hz. This clearly indicates that the latter devices have higher electron lifetime. Transient photovoltage decays of the samples are shown in the Figure 4b. As pointed out by Zaban et al.,12 when charge recombination is higher, Voc drops rapidly after light cut-off. In the case of pristine SnO2 samples, electrons rapidly recombine with redox species and Voc drops rapidly, however TiO2 coated samples show a slow drop of Voc indicating that charge recombination is suppressed in the presence of TiO2 nanoneedles, thereby improving electron lifetime. We believe that improving the thickness of the SnO2 layer will further improve the power conversion efficiency.

In conclusion, we developed a soft chemical route to synthesize novel architectures of SnO2 nanowalls coated with TiO2 nanoneedles, directly on FTO substrates. The architecture has better interconnectivity, charge transporting ability and well defined porosity and can be utilized to construct high performance electronic devices.
