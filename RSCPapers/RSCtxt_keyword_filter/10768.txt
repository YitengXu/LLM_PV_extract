1. Introduction
Energy has become one of the major concerns of the 21st century and there is growing demand for new sources that result in sustainable energy.1 Non-renewable sources such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas are crucial sources for major sectors such as industries, transportation, agriculture, etc. But these sources are limited and could become extinct in the future. They also release greenhouse gases which cause global warming. To overcome these issues, one needs to concentrate on developing/using renewable energy sources such as biofuels, wind power, solar power, tidal power, and hydropower etc.2–5 The only disadvantage of these renewable sources is that they cannot be utilized completely and continuously (depending on the natural conditions). Thus, we need to implement sustainable energy development strategies which involve three major technological changes: efficiency improvement in energy production, energy savings on the demand side, and replacement of fossil fuels by various sources of renewable energy.6 Out of the various energy development strategies, electrochemical energy production is under serious consideration as an alternative energy/power source. Electrical energy storage (EES) cannot possibly address all of these matters. However, energy storage does offer a well-established approach for improving grid reliability and utilization.7 Energy storage devices, particularly lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs), have gained a huge importance in the past several years due to their widespread applications as dominant power sources for portable consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, tablets, notebook PCs, and camcorders) and hybrid electric/plug-in-hybrid (HEV/PHEV) vehicles.8–11
In the last few decades, metal oxides have been widely employed for various applications such as gas sensors, oxygen reduction reactions, hydrogen generation, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, optoelectronic devices, etc.12–22 Nano-structuring of these metal oxides has shown unusual mechanical, electrical, and optical properties which have gained importance in various applications.23–25 Nano-engineering of electrode materials has proven to enhance electrochemical performances of LIBs and SC devices. Moving from conventional bulk to nanostructures offers several advantages for LIBs and SCs, including: (i) increase in electrode/electrolyte contact area that permits higher lithium-ions across the interface for LIBs and a large number of ion adsorption sites for double-layer formation and charge-transfer reactions for SCs, (ii) shorter path lengths for ionic/electronic transport with faster diffusion rates, (iii) better accommodation of the mechanical strain and structural distortion generated from ion insertion/extraction and other reactions, and (iv) occurrence of new reactions that are not possible with bulk materials.26
Compared to metal oxides, metal sulfides have equally emerged as a prominent class of materials for LIBs and SC due to their unique chemical and physical properties, such as high electric conductivity, mechanical, and thermal stability. Also, they possess rich redox chemistry which contributes to highly specific capacity/capacitance.26 Metal sulfides have also been widely explored as a bi-functional catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR),27–33 and hydrogen generation/evolution reactions30,34–39 which can replace the use of noble metals (Ir, Ru, Pt) as catalysts.
The sheer number of publications (see Fig. 1) in the literature for the last 4 years shows the importance of new binary and ternary metal sulfides. Taking these factors into account, we provide an overview of the progress on binary and ternary metal sulfide nanomaterials as electrodes in LIB and SC applications.
 Fig. 1  Statistics of literature reports on various binary and ternary metal sulfides reported from the year 2011 to the present (May 2017). 
This review summarizes recent progress in synthesis and development of binary and ternary metal sulfides (BMS and TMS) as electrode materials for LIBs, SC, and solar cells. It surveys the various strategies involved in synthesis methods, deposition techniques, and their effect on the performance of electrode materials. The main focus is the influence of these BMS and TMS on charge storage mechanisms and their electrochemical performances like specific capacity/capacitance, rate properties, and cycling stability for LIBs and SC. The review also summarizes the use of BMS and TMS as counter electrode (CE) materials to replace the precious metal Pt electrode in DSSCs. Also, new and promising strategies used to obtain desirable porosity, crystallinity, stoichiometry, shape, size and surface area, and their influence on the number of catalytic sites are discussed. Additionally, synthesis methods that avoid ligands and use of nontoxic components as a step towards a green chemistry approach are described. In situ depositions and fabrications that involve controlled thickness, low process temperatures, good deposition rates that result in short diffusion lengths, good electron transport, and suppression of charge recombination contributing to overall performance are discussed in length. Attempts to enhance such overall electrochemical properties of binary metal sulfides by use of various carbon sources, namely reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon nanotubes (CNT), and the effects thereof, are also discussed. Hence, discussions leading to appropriate tailoring of structure and surface property of BMS and TMS can be found in this review. At the end, the future scope for research in this field is outlined.
In our review we have considered type AB2S4 as binary metal sulfides and type A2BCS4 as ternary metal sulfides where A, B, and C are metal centres. NiCo2S4, ZnCo2S4, CoNi2S4, and CuCo2S4 are considered as binary metal sulfides and Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2FeSnS4 are considered as ternary metal sulfides.
2. Lithium ion battery
2.1. Working principle
A Li-ion battery mainly contains four essential components, namely, anode, separator, electrolyte and cathode. Generally, graphite is used as the anode material which possesses a theoretical capacity of 375 mA h g−1. Cathode materials such as layered LiCoO2 or LiFePO4 or LiMn2O4 also are used and 1 M LiPF6 (EC; DMC) too with a gel polymer electrolyte. In a reaction principle, Li-ions are removed from the host during the charge process and absorbed back during the discharge cycle. Electrode materials usually are intercalated compounds which remain stable after intercalation/de-intercalation of Li-ions with minimum structural variations. The separator acts as a barrier between anode and cathode to avoid a short circuit and, at the same time, to allow only Li-ions to pass through it. The working principle of a Li-ion battery is usually referred to as a “rocking-chair” mechanism, in which lithium ions move between anode and cathode during cycling. During the charge process, i.e., in presence of external electric field, Li-ions tend to move from cathode to anode through the separator where they get intercalated into the anode. During discharging, Li-ions from the anode move back to the cathode to undergo complete discharge as shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Working principle of a Li-ion battery. 
In Li-ion batteries, Li-ions can be stored in nanopores of anode carbon through interfacial and surface charging. The conductive mesoporous structure provides fast Li-ion transport and high rate capability. The electrolyte plays an important role in conducting the Li-ions to-and-fro from anode and cathode. In the case of electrolytes, the energy separation (Eg) of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) defines the electrochemical window during redox process. The electrolyte will be either reduced on an anode with  above the LUMO or oxidized on a cathode with  below the HOMO. The thermodynamic stability of the electrolyte can be achieved by appropriate selection of electrode materials to satisfy the potential window of a given electrolyte. The capacity and rate of lithiation and de-lithiation in LIBs depend on several kinetic processes such as: (i) electron transfer between electrode materials and the current collectors, (ii) electron transport and movement of lithium ions in the electrode materials, (iii) transport of ions in the non-aqueous electrolyte, (iv) transfer of electrons at the interface of electrode and electrolyte, and (v) phase transition in the electrode materials caused by lithiation or de-lithiation.
2.2. Importance of metal sulfides in LIBs
In the recent past, revolutionary advancements in consumer electronic devices, electric vehicles, and low-to-medium scale stationary energy storage units accelerated demand for high performance lithium batteries. On the other hand, limited sources of fossil fuels and their post-use environmental concerns are forcing researchers to find alternative and green material sources for energy applications. Metal sulfides are one such category of nanomaterials which offer high specific capacity compared to traditional electrode materials. Metal sulfides also exhibit unique properties of physical and chemical sensitivity which can be effectively used in applications like sensors, energy storage, and conversion applications.26,40–43 Chemical sensitivity of metal sulfides has been effectively utilized to alter oxygen vacancies through in/out diffusion mechanisms suitable for Li-ion storage and conversion applications.
However, recent studies suggest that despite the large lithium storage capacity, the transition metal sulfides usually suffer from large irreversible capacity, poor rate capability, roundtrip energy inefficiency, and severe capacity fading during cycling. These obstacles are believed to be rooted in the Li storage mechanisms, and cannot be simply addressed by nanostructures without a comprehensive understanding of their origins and effects. However, recent reports suggest that large volumetric changes of metal sulphide nanostructures during electrochemical reactions lead to reduced capacity and poor cycling stability.40 Moreover, many metal sulfides exhibit much higher electronic conductivity than their oxide counterparts because the electronegativity of sulphur is lower than that of oxygen, which prevents disintegration of the structure by elongation between layers and makes it easy for electrons to transport in an electrode.
Recently, a number of reviews on metal sulfide have been reported. Rui et al.26 summarized recent advances in nanostructured metal sulfides (MS) and their application in lithium batteries (LIB) and supercapacitors (SC). In this review, the author's focus was on recent advances in design and fabrication of nanostructured MS electrodes like iron sulfide, copper sulfide, cobalt sulfide, nickel sulfide, manganese sulfide, molybdenum sulfide, and tin sulfide for LIBs and SCs. In another review, Liu et al.41 summarized progress on rational design and efficient synthesis of MSs with controlled morphologies, sizes, compositions, and micro/nanostructures, along with their applications as electrode materials for lithium/sodium/magnesium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, and electro catalysts for ORR, OER, and hydrogen evolution reactions. The functional mechanism of MSs and their performance evaluation in battery applications was the focus of Xu et al.40 review. Xu et al. also highlighted the progress and challenges of various metal sulfides like MoS2, WS2, ZrS2, VS2, VS4, SnS2 and their composites with various carbon sources like carbon black, carbon nano tubes (CNT), graphene, and carbon fiber cloth for a Li ion battery. On the other hand, Yu et al.42 concentrated their literature evolution on morphological aspects of MSs including design and synthesis methods for and hybrid-SCs. In all previous reviews, the main focus was on primary metal sulfides and a limited attempt was made to discuss reports only on a binary metal sulfide like NiCo2S4. In the last 2–3 years, there have been several research groups working on improving properties of metal sulfides by resolving demerits of primary metal sulfides. Therefore, reversible capacity and stability of the electrode material is essential for high performance of LIB technology. In this section, we will be focusing and listing the work carried out so far on binary and ternary metal sulfides and their applications for LIBs.
2.3. Binary and ternary metal sulfides in lithium ion battery

2.3.1. NiCo2S4 as electrode material. 
Generally, sulfide minerals are classified as semiconductors due to their significant refractive indices, high electrical conductivity, and often metallic luster. A fundamental property that differentiates sulfide materials from oxide is the band gap; the energy separation between the filled valence band constructed mainly from the sulphur p-orbital, and the empty conduction band constructed mainly from the empty cation orbital. However, the bonding arrangement for sulfide minerals, particularly ternary sulfide minerals, is believed to play a crucial role in defining properties associated with sulfide materials and many of the reports termed it as complex to interpret.
The redox mechanism of NiCo2S4 conversion reaction as follows: about 8 M of Li+ ions are involved during the first cycle. Therefore, the reaction mechanism involved is explained through a conversion reaction as follows: NiCo2S4 + 8Li+ +8e− → Ni + Co + 4Li2S(1) Ni + xLi2S ↔ NiSx + 2xLi+ + 2xe−(2) Co + xLi2S ↔ CoSx + 2xLi+ + 2xe−(3)
Yu et al. in 2016 followed a simple facile hydrothermal method to prepare NiCo2S4 nanotubes directly grown on Ni foam with an average inner-diameter of 55 nm, external-diameter of 100 nm, and length of 2 mm (Fig. 3(a)). The binder-free anode for the LIBs NiCo2S4 nanotube array exhibited outstanding lithium-storage performance. It is generally observed that the cyclic voltammetry on NiCo2S4 nanorods electrode gives a reduction peak at 1.1 V in the first peak, which is due to the reaction of Li+ ion with NiCo2S4 to form corresponding Ni and Co nanoparticles embedded in Li2S matrix, which is represented by reaction (1). In this irreversible process, a small reduction peak at 0.6 V appears which corresponds to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The repetitive peaks which appear in the first and subsequent anodic scans for oxidation at 2.05 V and 2.37 V correspond to the oxidation of metallic Ni and Co to NiSx and CoSx, respectively. The NiCo2S4 nanotube array delivered a discharge capacity of 720 mA h g−1 during 50 cycles that slightly surpasses its theoretical capacity of 703 mA h g−1. When the current comes back to 0.2C after rate measurements, NiCo2S4 nanotubes can still stably deliver a discharging capacity of 652 mA h g−1, reaching 92.7% of that at the initial 0.2C. However, during the 2nd and 5th cathodic scans two reduction peaks were observed at 1.23 V and 1.68 V, which can be attributed to the reduction of NiSx and CoSx into metallic Ni and Co, respectively as represented in reactions (2) and (3). These reversible redox peaks contribute to the overall capacity and decide the cyclic stability of the sulfide material.44

On the other hand, Wang et al. followed a low-temperature synthesis approach to grow hierarchical NiCo2S4 ultrathin nanosheets of 2–3 nm thickness on Ni foam Fig. 3(b). The free standing NiCo2S4 nanosheets on Ni foams show a high specific capacity of about 1300 mA h g−1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.2%, outstanding cycling stability, and remarkable rate capability. The authors attribute the high performance as due to a unique nanoarchitecture of the NiCo2S4 nanosheets having abundant electro-active sites and high conductivity. The long term stable redox kinetics was achieved by mechanically integrating ternary metal sulfides by direct growth on Ni-foam which receives better connections to the conductive Ni foam.45
For the first time, Zhu et al. demonstrated the importance of NiCo2S4 as an electrode material for a Li battery. Initial discharge/charge capacity of 1815/1013 mA h g−1 was obtained with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼56%. After 100 cycles, 70% of initial capacity was retained with capacity loss of 0.3% per cycle.47 Zou et al. followed a simple hydrothermal synthesis method followed by sulfurization to obtain 3D-networked NiCo2S4 nano-sheets on a carbon cloth substrate as shown in Fig. 3(c). The resulting mesoporous NiCo2S4 nano-sheets showed a high surface area of 109 m2 g−1. The binary sulfide nanomaterial electrode showed an initial discharge–charge capacity of 2298/1868 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 100 mA g−1. Also, the 3D network structure of NiCo2S4 nanosheets resulted in a large surface area that provided easier electron and ion transport capability from an electrolyte. With this, the reversible capacity of ∼1275 mA h g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1000 mA g−1 retaining ∼1137 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The authors concluded that, at higher current rates, the NiCo2S4 nano-sheets were believed to pose a reversible capacity of 340 mA h g−1 which is comparable to the theoretical capacity of graphite. High cyclic stability was attributed to a unique 3D network structure and void space of NiCo2S4 nanosheets that are believed to provide structural robustness and mesoporous network structures.46
Recently, Zhang et al. prepared a 3D network of ultra-thin NiCo2S4 on N-doped graphene and CNT (NGC) in a one-step process. In this study, the authors designed NiCo2S4 having an excellent interface with N-doped graphene/CNT frameworks by a dispersion and confinement approach to retain structural integrity and cycling stability of the electro-active material during LIB performance. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between NiCo2S4 and NGC networks, the NiCo2S4/NGC electrode exhibited superior electrochemical performance with high initial charge capacity of 1225 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention >89% after 100 cycles (Fig. 4). The authors performed cyclic stability at 5 A g−1 at which capacity was 574 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, demonstrating its exceptional high-rate performance (Fig. 4).48

(d) Rate performance of bare NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4/NGC-2 electrodes at various current densities (reprinted from ref. 48, Copyright 2016, with permission from John Wiley and Sons48). 
Meanwhile, many research groups worked to improve the performance of ternary metal sulfides by various strategies. In most cases, researchers followed a ternary sulfide electrode synthesis such as a hydrothermal method, anion exchange reaction, low temperature chemical approach, simple precipitation method, solvothermal, facial oil phase approach, and a hot injection method to improve morphology of the material. Several electrochemical studies related to energy conversion and storage demonstrated that hetero-atoms like nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur play an important role in electroactivity of electrode materials. To observe the effects of a hetero atom like nitrogen, Zhang et al.48 and Wu et al.49 used nitrogen-doped graphene/CNT frameworks (NGC) and nitrogen-doped carbon foam (NDCF) as a substrate, respectively, to grow NiCo2S4 materials hydrothermally. In early 2015, Wu et al. synthesized NiCo2S4 nanotubes on Ni foam using a two-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 5(a)) and used electrode materials without any conducting binders. It was observed that the electrode possessed an initial discharge–charge capacity of 1806 and 1282 mA h g−1 with a reversible capacity of 720 mA h g−1, which is higher than its theoretical capacity value (703 mA h g−1). The authors concluded that the observed higher reversible capacity is mainly due to its unique tube-like morphology which allows both the inner and outer wall to participate in the chemical reaction. It was observed that NiCo2S4/NGC had a very high surface area of 168 m2 g−1 compared to NiCo2S4/NDCF (42 m2 g−1) due to the graphene/CNT hybrid framework. As electrode material, NiCo2S4/NGC showed an initial discharge–charge capacity of 1687/1225 mA h g−1 and reversible capacity of 1091 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Whereas an initial discharge/charge capacity of 2157/593 mA h g−1 with reversible capacity of 1182 mA h g−1 was achieved after 100 cycles in the case of NiCo2S4/NDCF.49 Furthermore, the authors proved that the well-designed hollow feature and voids in the NiCo2S4 nanotubes provided adequate volumetric expansion during the lithium insertion and extraction process, thus making them a suitable anode in LIBs.

Later, the same group fabricated NiCo2S4 nanostructures on 3D graphene foam via a solvothermal method followed by sulfurization. This unique network-like design provides a high surface area and high electro-active sites for an electrochemical reaction. A high initial discharge capacity of 2137 mA h g−1 was obtained, with capacity retention of 1292 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles.50 In another attempt, hollow nanospheres of NiCo2S4/C were synthesised via a hydrothermal method using SiO2 as a template. They possessed a high specific area of 247 m2 g−1 with high initial capacity of 2223 mA h g−1 of which 1178 mA h g−1 was retained after 200 cycles.51
In a template free solvothermal method, Jin et al. prepared mesoporous hydrangea macrophylla like NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4 with crosslinked nanorods (10–20 nm) architecture showing excellent electrochemical performances as anode materials for LIB. The uniquely assembled NiCo2S4 showed an initial discharge/charge of 1204/966 mA h g−1 and could retain 718 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. However, interestingly, at a higher current rate of 2000 mA g−1, it retained a reversible capacity of 395 mA h g−1 which is higher than NiCo2O4 and even the theoretical capacity of graphene.52 In 2015, Bhattacharjya et al. prepared spinel NiCo2S4 with a nanorod morphology. The authors further utilized carboxymethyl cellulose–polyacrylamide (CMC–PAA) as a composite binder for LIB electrode preparation, which resulted in excellent performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate property, and cyclic stability. It was observed that initial discharge/charge capacity was found to be as high as 1668/1296 mA h g−1. Impressively, a reversible capacity of 1188 mA h g−1 was still maintained even after 100 cycles. The interesting aspect of this study was to account for the effect of binder on electrode performance. Therefore, the authors thoroughly carried out SEM analysis to identify cracks before and after 10 cycles. In both cases, NiCo2S4 showed no visible cracks on it; however, the electrode with the PVDF binder showed the formation of a thick polymeric gel layer filled with traces of NiCo2S4 in it.53 Song et al.54 synthesized hexagonal NiCo2S4via vapor transformation using H2S. Graphene was used as a conductive additive, instead of conductive carbon, to provide better contact between the electrode materials. It delivered a discharge/charge capacity of 1455/1073 mA h g−1, with 607 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles. Kinetics studies showed a pseudo-capacitance mechanism of Li+ storage. The authors suggested the extension of this synthesis approach for various other BMS such as FeCo2S4 and ZnCo2S4.
Yang et al. synthesized 3D CoNi2S4 nanorods and cross-linked NiCo2S4 nanosheets on carbon cloth via a one-step hydrothermal method. Cross-linked NiCo2S4 nanosheets delivered high initial discharge capacity of 2363 mA h g−1 which was higher than CoNi2S4 nanorods (1979 mA h g−1). After 50 charge/discharges it retained 90.8% of its initial capacity (2134 mA h g−1). This enhanced capacity and superior cyclic performance was attributed to its unique structure which provides convenient channels for Li ions and electrons and helps in strain relaxation.55 For comparison, Table 1 lists various binary/ternary metal sulfides and their synthesis methods, surface area, initial discharge/charge capacity, rate performance, and cyclic stability.

2.3.2. Other binary metal sulfides. 
Even though binary metal sulfides have been in use for different applications due to their high thermoelectric properties, now, low cost, low toxicity, and easy-to-handle binary metal sulfides have attracted growing interest in recent years as energy materials. So far, there are limited reports on synthesis of CoMoS4,56 CuSbS2,57 ZnCo2S4,58 Cdln2S4,59 FeMo4S6,60 CuCo2S4,61,62etc., and their applications as anode materials for LIBs. Contrary to emerging trends, for very first time in 2006 Guo et al. synthesized flower-like CoMoS4 using a simple precipitation method and utilized it as an electrode material having a nanopetals morphology with high initial discharge capacity of 1547 mA h g−1. Even though a reversible capacity of 460 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles was achieved in initial studies, the report recognized the importance and potentials of binary metal sulfides in energy storage applications.56 Nevertheless, looking at the trend and already notable contributions from anode materials like NiCo2S4 and CuZnS4, the prior listed set of materials might gain importance in the near future in the energy storage sector.
Later in 2013, Zhang et al. employed a hot injection method for the synthesis of brick-shaped CuSbS2 and studied its electrochemical properties for the first time. It delivered a good initial capacity of 762 mA h g−1 but CuSbS2 was too unstable to retain much capacity after a series of cycles. After 50 cycles a reversible capacity of only 86 mA h g−1 was achievable, which is very low compared to other materials. The authors contemplated that the CuSbS2 rigid surface decreased the capacity because it only allows the surface to take part in chemical reactions.57
In contrast to NiCo2S4, its inverse spinel CoNi2S4 also has gained a huge importance in various applications. Sun et al. reported the facile synthesis and use of CoNi2S4 as electrode material for a Li-ion battery. The authors reported preparation of fused CoNi2S4 nanorods architecture via a hydrothermal method without any surfactants. As an anode material, CoNi2S4 nanorods delivered an initial discharge/charge capacity of 1575/1245 mA h g−1 and even after 50 cycles it could maintain a reversible capacity of 946 mA h g−1. The high reversible capacitance was attributed to the formation and dissolution of a SEI layer by the electrolyte. The authors also attributed the improved electrode performance in LIB to its unique 1D geometry which improved the utilization of electrode material and shortened the electron diffusion path.63 Alternatively, CdIn2S4 has attracted wide interest due to its high photocatalytic activities. To make use of binary metal sulfides semiconductor properties, Mahadadalkar et al. prepared composite hierarchical nanopetals like CdIn2S4/graphene nanostructures in a template-free hydrothermal process. This multi-functionality CdIn2S4/graphene was further tested in LIBs as an anode as shown in Fig. 6. The CdIn2S4/graphene as anode LIB showed very high reversible capacity of 678 mA h g−1 and maintained capacity of 608 mA h g−1 at an applied current density of 150 mA g−1 for 225 cycles. The authors attributed charge storage and cyclic stability to high porosity of the CdIn2S4 and the fast electron kinetics offered by the conductive graphene support.64

(b) Cyclic-voltammetry curves recorded after first discharge–charge profile of Li-ion battery containing bare CdIn2S4 (C1) and CdIn2S4/graphene nano-heterostructure with 3% GO (C4).

As synergic properties of ternary metal sulfides were being explored, new sets of ternary metal were being tested for their charge storage capacities. In 2016, researchers highlighted the importance of a few other ternary metal sulfides materials which were used as electrode material for a Li battery for the very first time. Following a simple hydrothermal method, X. Zhang et al.60 and W. Zhang et al.59 prepared nanosheets of FeMo4S6 and CulnS2 nano-spheres of which FeMo4S6 showed better initial lithium storage capacity of 973/749 mA h g−1. Also, FeMo4S6 maintained higher reversible capacity of 670 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles whereas, in the case of CulnS2 there was a huge capacity loss after a few cycles and it could attain a reversible capacity of only 265 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles. Increased capacity was attributed to the higher conductivity resulting from the presence of graphene in the composite electrode. For the first time, Kale et al.65 synthesised hierarchical 3D ZnLn2S4/graphene via a hydrothermal method and used it as an electrode material for solar hydrogen production and a lithium ion battery. Initial discharge/charge capacity of 1106/645 mA h g−1 was obtained for ZnLn2S4/graphene with a capacity retention of 590 mA h g−1 after 220 cycles, which was better than bare ZnLn2S4. This article highlights the importance of ZnLn2S4 as electrode material for hydrogen production and a lithium ion battery; it also allows researchers to further investigate the importance and enhance performance of ZnLn2S4.
Yang et al. reported unique nanoartichoke morphology of ZixCo1−xSxvia a facile oil phase approach by varying different sulphur sources. It was observed that Zn–Co sulfide nanosheets with surface area of 67.8 m2 g−1 showed a higher reversible capacity of 750 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles compared to that of Zn–Co nanoparticles (220 mA h g−1). The authors emphasised that the unique morphology lead to the high surface area of this electrode material, which sequentially altered interfacial contacts between Zn–Co species and electrolyte, making an efficient electrochemical cell component.58
Earlier, Ye et al. attempted to synthesis a composite of SnCoS4/graphene electrode material in a one-step process. In this study, the authors conducted extensive material characterization to establish the synergism between SnCoS4 and graphene. The initial discharge/charge capacity of 1739/1298 mA h g−1 was achieved for the SnCoS4/graphene nanocomposite which further retained a reversible capacity of 940 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2000 mA h g−1.66
Furthermore, two different studies conducted by Wu et al.67 and Ding et al.68 successfully synthesized CuFeS2via a solvothermal method and used it as anode and cathode material for Li-ion battery application, respectively. Ding et al. used a direct method whereas Wu et al. followed a poly(vinylpyrrolidone) template-assisted route to prepare uniformly distributed nanosheet electrodes. Interestingly, both studies recorded similar electrode performance. As anode material, it delivered a reversible capacity of 700 mA h g−1 at 100 mA h g−1 and as cathode material it delivered a reversible capacity of 500 mA h g−1 at 350 mA h g−1.
Recently, Tao et al.69 synthesized rGO-coated Cu2SnS3 anode material via a hydrothermal method. The rGO/Cu2SnS3 showed a reversible capacity of 561 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles. Here, rGO played an important role to maintain higher cyclic stability. Studies were conducted by Qu et al.70,71 on Cu2SnS3 in two different morphologies. The Cu2SnS3 with a cabbage-like structure had a surface area of 22 m2 g−1 compared to that of spheres (18 m2 g−1). The Cu2SnS3 with cabbage morphology attained a reversible capacity of 670 mA h g−1 compared to the spheres-type morphology (436 mA h g−1), respectively. Therefore, the Cu2SnS3 could be well utilized as an efficient anode in LIB with a high conductive composite partner like rGO.
CuCo2S4 is another binary sulfide which has caught attention for energy applications. Nie et al. reported a one pot hydrothermal approach for synthesis of a CuCo2S4/graphene composite. Initial discharge/charge capacity of 1004/956 mA h g−1 was obtained at 0.1C, which was found to be higher than that CuCo2S4 (796/712 mA h g−1). Interestingly, capacity of 866 mA h g−1 was retained by CuCo2S4/graphene after 500 cycles (226 mA h g−1 for CuCo2S4). The authors related enhanced capacity recovery to a pseudo capacity effect of the polymeric/gel film.61 Recently, Varma et al. coated carbon on CuCo2S4via a hydrothermal approach and used it as electrode material. CuCo2S4/C could delivered a capacity of 296 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles.62 These results open up new possibilities for researchers to work on enhancing the properties of these materials with improved rate capability and cycling stability.

2.4. Studies on ternary metal sulfides
Cu2ZnSnS4 material has a variety of applications but its electrochemical properties were first investigated by Zhou et al. As an electrode material it had a good initial capacity value but after 50 cycles discharge capacity reached around 150 mA h g−1.72 Yang et al.73 used a simple microwave-assisted method for synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystals; it exhibited a discharge/charge capacity of 857/288 mA h g−1. Unfortunately, only 81% of the initial capacity was retained after 30 cycles. In another case, Li et al.74 used a wet chemical approach which could attain a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.
Hierarchical porous Cu2ZnSnS4 films were synthesised via a solution pyrolysis method and used as an electrode material for LIBs by Yin et al.75 High initial discharge capacity of 1154 mA h g−1 was obtained, which was higher than in previous reports. Interestingly, capacity of 680 mA h g−1 was still retained after 40 cycles. The authors suggested that enhanced performance was due to its 3D porous structure which acts like a blood vessels, providing a pathway for lithium ions. Jiang et al.76 synthesised Cu2ZnSnS4 microspheres with ultrathin nanosheets via a solvothermal method. These microspheres possessed an initial charge capacity of 779 mA h g−1 and retained 786 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. An all solid-state battery was fabricated with Cu2ZnSnS4/graphene, lithium metal, solid bilayer (Li10GeP2S12 and 70% Li2S-29% P2S5-1% P2O5) as cathode, anode, and electrolyte, respectively. It delivered a discharge capacity of 645 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Interestingly, at higher current rate (1000 mA g−1) it retained a capacity of 233 mA h g−1.77
Huge amounts of progress have been made with these materials, starting from the Zhou et al. report with 150 mA h g−1 to Jiang et al. with 786 mA h g−1. Still, a lot of research can be done on these materials to further increase their storage performances and cyclic stability because Cu2ZnSnS4 possesses a theoretical capacity of 847 mA h g−1.
3. Supercapacitors
3.1. Charge storage in supercapacitors
Supercapacitors have been one of the active areas of research due to their unique properties like high power density, high charge/discharge rates, and long cycle life. When compared to rechargeable batteries, they deliver a very high power density. This makes a supercapacitor a promising electrochemical device where a power burst is needed. When compared to batteries in terms of charge/discharge rates, supercapacitors can be charged and discharged in the shortest time period, which is a great advantage, and they also have a long cycle life, which can withstand millions of cycles without involving an irreversible chemical reaction; this is high compared to batteries.
Based on the charging mechanism, supercapacitors can be classified into two types:
(1) Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), and
(2) Pseudo-capacitors
Electric double-layer capacitance is a mechanism in which storing of energy is achieved by an electric double layer effect. This mechanism occurs at the interface between electrode–electrolyte called the Helmholtz double layer (Fig. 7). The amount of charge stored in this interface is proportional to the applied voltage and depends on the nature, morphology of electrode surface, and also the type of electrolyte. Thus, by controlling the surface area and pore size, one can aim to achieve a high storage capacitance.
 Fig. 7  Working principle of supercapacitor. 
Pseudo-capacitance is an electrochemical storage mechanism by means of a reversible faradaic redox reaction on the surface of the electrode. It is accomplished by an electron charge transfer between electrolyte and electrode from de-solvent and adsorbed ion (Fig. 7). This mechanism usually exhibits a very high specific capacitance and high energy density as compared to an electric double-layer capacitor. Amounts of pseudo-capacitance mainly depend on the surface area and structure of the electrode.
Supercapacitors show potential applications in electronics, transportation, communication, etc. They are used in a wide range of energy capture and storage applications.
3.2. Design and working principle
Electrochemical capacitors consist of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane called a separator, and an electrolyte. Materials with thin coating on a current collector are usually used as an electrode. To obtain superior performance in a supercapacitor, an electrode with high electrical conductivity, high temperature stability, and high surface area is essential. An electrolyte is made up of a solvent and some dissolved chemicals which dissociates into ions and makes it ionically conductive. The most important parameter of an electrolyte is that it should be chemically stable, does not react with the electrodes, and it should be stable under the potential of operations. It is observed that an aqueous electrolyte can achieve a higher capacitance value as compared to organic electrolyte.78,79 The electrolyte material determines various aspects like operating voltage, temperature range, etc., which directly effect the specific capacitance of a capacitor. The separator plays an important role in preventing a short circuit between two electrodes. These separators are usually microporous membranes which allow only conducting ions to pass through them. Separators should be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability, have good temperature stability, and possess good ionic conductivity; also, they should not degrade or react with the electrolytic solution.
When an external voltage is applied, ions in the electrolyte form an electric double layer at the electrode depending on their polarity; e.g., a negative electrode will have a layer of positive ions on its electrode/electrolyte surface and a positive electrode will have a layer of negative ions on its electrode/electrolyte surface.
Depending on the nature of the electrode materials, an electrochemical storage mechanism may be due to separation of charge in a Helmholtz double layer or by faradaic redox reactions with charge-transfer. The most commonly used electrode materials which work on separation of charge in Helmholtz double are carbon in various forms like activated carbon, carbon aerogel, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc. Various metal oxides like RuO2,80 MnO2,81 V2O5,82 NiO,83 Co3O4,84 SnO2,85 and Fe2O386,87 and sulfides like CoS2,88 Ni3S2,89 NiS,90 ZnS,91 CuS,92,93 and MoS241,94,95 have been widely explored as electrode materials for supercapacitors which undergo faradaic redox reactions with charge-transfer, so called “pseudo-capacitance.” Along with metal oxides, conductive polymers also play a vital role in pseudo-capacitance due to their high conductivity but they lack in certain important mechanical strengths and limited cycling performance. A few examples of conducting polymers include polyaniline,96 polythiophene, polypyrrole,97 and polyacetylene.86
Recently, binary metal oxides like NiCo2O4,98,99 ZnCo2O4,100,101 MCo2O4 (M = Mg, Mn, Cu),102–104etc. have been explored as electrode materials for supercapacitor studies. Zhang et al. summarized a few reports on binary transition metal oxides as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.105
3.3. Binary metal sulfides as electrode materials
Many different binary sulfides such as NiCo2S4, CoNi2S4, ZnCo2S4, CuSbS2, MxCo(3−x)S4 (where M = Ni, Mn, Zn), CoMoS4, MnCo2S4, CuCo2S4, Cu2NiSnS4, and FeNi2S4 have been considered as promising materials for supercapacitor applications. Various attempts have been made to obtain materials with high specific capacitance, high energy, power density, and better rate capabilities. But few attempts relating to synthesis methods using different current collectors, graphene composites, or metal oxide composites have been proven to do well in increasing overall performance of a supercapacitor. In this review, we consider recent reports from 2012 on binary metal sulfides, their various methods of synthesis, morphology, and their effect on electro-chemical properties like specific capacitance, rate performance, and cycle stability.

3.3.1. NiCo2S4 as supercapacitor electrode. 
Various groups of researchers across the globe have been continuously working on a new set of binary and ternary metal sulfides and trying to explore the properties of these materials in as many different ways as possible. Out of all the binary metal sulfides mentioned earlier, NiCo2S4 is a promising material not only for lithium-ion batteries but also as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
Chen et al.107 highlighted the importance of nickel cobalt sulfide over oxides in terms of conductivity, redox property, and used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Urchin-like NiCo2S4 nanostructures were synthesized via precursor transformation (Ni and Co-based precursors) by a hydrothermal method. As an electrode material, it showed pseudo-capacitance characteristics and delivered a specific capacitance of 1149 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. At a higher current density of 50 A g−1, it could still deliver a capacitance of 761 F g−1. High specific capacitance and high rate capacitance is due to its unique urchin-like morphology; this enhances the facility of electrolyte penetration and high conductivity of NiCo2S4, which then allows electrons to move quickly, thus contributing to its high rate property.
Various morphologies like urchin, tube, flower, and cubic-like microstructures were successfully synthesized by Zhang et al.108 using a hydrothermal method with different solvents. It was observed that the tube-like microstructure had a better performance than flower, cubic, and urchin structures, due to the effective reaction of the electrolyte and the active materials in tubular structures. From this, it was clear that morphology plays an important role in performance of an electrode. Out of different morphologies, the nanotube microstructure showed a better specific capacitance of 1050 F g−1 at current density of 6 A g−1. Also, 75.9% of initial specific capacitance was retained after 5000 cycles. Wan et al.109 successfully synthesized NiCo2S4 nanotubes via a sacrificial method based on the Kirkendall effect.110 As obtained nanotubes had a surface area of 32 m2 g−1 and as an electrode material it showed a specific capacitance of 933 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In another case, Pu et al.111 successfully grew NiCo2S4 nanotubes directly on Ni foam and used them as an electrode material without any additive binders. At a high current rate of 4 A g−1, it could deliver a specific capacitance of 738 F g−1 and a capacitance of 93.4% was retained even after 4000 cycles. Enhanced performance is due to its porous nanotubes morphology which provides a large active surface area and relatively short diffusion pathway for ions, leading to high charge–discharge capacities and also high utilization of active materials.
Yang et al.113 synthesized NiCo2S4 hexagonal plates via a hydrothermal method. A specific capacitance of 1086 F g−1 was obtained at a lower current density of 0.5 A g−1 and even after 2000 charge/discharge cycles it retained specific capacitance of 891 F g−1. Hydrangea-like NiCo2S4 were synthesized using a low temperature hydrothermal method with high surface area of 75 m2 g−1. As an electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 1475 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and, interestingly, it could retain a capacitance of 1152 F g−1 even at 20 A g−1; its excellent performance is mainly due to its unique hydrangea-like morphology which shortens the distance of electrolyte/electrode materials and helps in the rapid movement of ions and electrons.114 Amaryllis-like NiCo2S4 nanoflowers were synthesised by Hussain et al.115via a hydrothermal method. A flexible solid state device was fabricated using carbon fabric fiber with NiCo2S4 which delivered an energy density of 25 W h kg−1 at a power density of 168 W kg−1. Excellent stability of 90% was obtained after 5000 cycles. In another attempt by Hussain et al.,116 truncated NiCo2S4 cubohexa-octahedrals were synthesised via a hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 832 F g−1 and 735 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively with a capacity retention of 92.7% after 5000 cycles. Tao et al.204 synthesised NiCo2S4 with tremella-like morphology via a microwave method followed by a hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 1410 F g−1 and 1137 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively with capacitance retention of 92.7%.
Mesoporous NiCo2S4 nanosheets were synthesized using a one pot hydrothermal method. They delivered a specific capacitance of 744 F g−1 at 1 A g−1; remarkably, 93.4% of initial capacitance was retained after 1500 cycles.118 Yang et al.119 synthesized NiCo2S4 flaky array structures on Ni foam and used them as a binder free electrode. It exhibited a very high specific capacitance of 2044 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The increase in capacitance is due to its unique flaky-like structure which displayed a high surface area of 40.98 m2 g−1; 77% of initial capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles. NiCo2S4 flaky arrays display excellent charge-transfer kinetics and thus exhibit a remarkably improved electrochemical performance. NiCo2S4 nanosheets were successfully grown on Ni foam by Lin et al.120via a two-step hydrothermal method. Morphology was controlled by the amount of additive ammonium fluoride in the reaction mixture. An electrode made of nanosheets with self-decorated nanoneedles delivered a better performance. As electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 2618 F g−1 at a current density of 15 mA cm−2 and a 92.6% retention of initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. Sahoo et al.121 reported a Ni–Co sulfide ultrathin nanosheet via an electro-deposition method on Ni substrate which showed high specific capacitance of 1712 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. At a higher current rate of 10 A g−1 it could retain a specific capacitance of 909 A g−1. In another case, Li et al.122 synthesised porous nickel–cobalt sulfide nanosheets via micelle-confined growth and subsequent sulfuration with a high surface area of 141 m2 g−1 and average pore size of 7 nm. Specific capacitance of 1304 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 was obtained and 93.5% of its original capacitance was retained after 6000 cycles. When fabricated as a device, it delivered a high energy density of 41.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 414 W kg−1. 3D NiCo2S4 nanosheets were synthesised by Sui et al.123 in 2017. NiCo2S4 nanosheets delivered a pseudocapacitance of 1258 F g−1 and 1077 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. An asymmetrical device with activated carbon delivered an energy density of 47.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 477.3 W kg−1.
Zhu et al.124 synthesized NiCo2S4-based nanostructured films on Ni foam via a two-step method which involved growth of a Ni–Co precursor (Ni–Co hydroxide) followed by treatment with Na2S to form NiCo2S4 nanostructures. During the synthesis process, sodium dodecyl surfactant (SDS) was used which acts as an effective anionic surfactant to prevent the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles from agglomerating. A NiCo2S4-SDS electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 2519 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 which was found to be double than that of bare NiCo2S4 nanotubes (1293 F g−1). The increase in specific capacitance is mainly due to its hierarchical porous structure with good electrical contact which results in high conductivity and increases the transport rate of electrons and ions.
3D honeycomb NiCo2S4 was successfully synthesised by Zhang et al.125via a hydrothermal method followed by a sulfuration method. Various morphologies such as needle, flake, and petal-like were synthesised by varying the amount of NH4F during the synthesis process. Specific capacitance of 14 mA h cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 for these honeycomb nanostructures. This unique honeycomb nanostructure not only provides many electro-active sites but also shortens the distance for charge transfer and ion diffusion. Liu et al.126 synthesised flower-like NiCo2S4via a hydrothermal method with a high surface area of 81.3 m2 g−1. As an electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 1516 F g−1 and 1354 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 16 A g−1, respectively. After 1000 cycles, it still retained 89.6% of its initial capacitance.
NiCo2S4 nanorods were successfully grown on Ni foam via a hydrothermal method and used as electrode material for LIBs and SC. As electrode material without any conductive binder; it delivered a specific capacitance of 240 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1.127 Hierarchical NiCo2S4 was fabricated on Ni-foam via a one-step chemical approach which showed a specific capacitance of 1739 F g−1 at 4 A g−1. At higher current rates (30 A g−1) it retained 85.2% of its initial capacitance. Enhanced performance at high current is mainly due to its highly porous nature with good mechanical and electrical contact, which helps with better electron/ion transportation.128 Unique cockscomb flower-like NiCo2S4 was synthesized using a hydrothermal method. It delivered a specific capacitance of 1707 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an areal capacitance was found to be 4.1 F cm−2 at 2.4 mA cm−2. Increased capacitance is attributed to its unique electrode design and its morphology, which allows high reaction sites.129
NiCo2S4 hollow microsphere were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 1753 F g−1 was attained at a current density of 1 A g−1; when the current density was increased to 3 A g−1, it still delivered a specific capacitance of 1350 F g−1. The hollow microstructure possessed spheres with 2–5 nm pores, which enhance the electro-active sites. Voids of NiCo2S4 hollow spheres serve as an ion reservoir, which reduces the diffusion distance of electrolyte and accelerates ion diffusion.130 Porous NiCo2S4 nano networks were successfully fabricated on nickel foam through an anion exchange reaction between a Ni–Co precursor and Na2S. As electrode material, it showed a high capacitance of 1501 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 which was found to be 2.5 times greater than NiCo2O4 (638 F g−1). After 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1, it could still rate 95.4% of its initial capacitance. Its improved performance is due to a unique porous network, which favours highly accessible active electro-active sites.131 Peng et al.132 synthesized NiCo2S4 mesoporous nano sheets directly on Ni form using a two-step solution method and different deposition rates. Out of different depositions, sample D1 showed the highest specific capacitance of 1575 F g−1 at 10 mA cm−2 and 92% of initial capacitance was retained after 1500 cycles. It was observed that as the mass of the electrode material increased, there was a decrease in rate of ion transport, which resulted in decreased specific capacitance. Self-standing NiCo2S4 nanotubes were successfully grown on Ni-foam via an ion exchange reaction by Chen et al. They delivered a specific capacitance of 14.4 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. After 5000 cycles, specific capacitance of 92% of initial capacitance was retained; also, it showed a very high energy and power density of 31.5 W h kg−1 and 2348 W kg−1, respectively.133 Nanocage NiCo2S4 were synthesised by Wang et al.134 which showed a specific capacitance of 1635 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 63% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles. Inspired by blooming buds, Wen et al.117 synthesised ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanopetals via a mild hydrothermal method. The NiCo2S4 nanopetals possessed a specific capacitance of 2036 F g−1 and 1705 F g−1 at current density of 1 F g−1 and 70 A g−1, respectively. As an asymmetric device with active carbon, it delivered an energy density of 35.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 819 W kg−1. This device was used to light 10 LEDs in series which lasted for almost for 60 min and shows the importance of NiCo2S4 for practical applications. NiCo2S4 spheres were synthesised by Zhang et al.,135 which showed an specific capacitance of 1156 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Chai et al.136 synthesised porous NiCo2S4 using halloysite as template and component. It demonstrated ultrahigh specific capacitance of 589 C g−1 and 408 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1 with 86% retention after 1000 cycles. As an electrode material for an asymmetrical device, it delivered an energy density of 35.48 W h kg−1 at power density of 199.9 W kg−1. Its enhanced performance can be attributed to its porous structure and large number of active sites induced by the template. Capsule-like porous hollow Ni–Co sulfide was synthesised with γ-MnS nanocrystals as a sacrificial template. Specific capacitance of Ni1.77Co1.23S4 was found to be 182 mA h g−1 and 153.8 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. As an asymmetrical device with activated carbon, it delivered an energy density of 42.7 W h kg−1 at power density of 190.8 W kg−1. Two such devices connected in series could light an LED for an hour.137
A novel flexible electrode of NiCo2S4 nanosheets was fabricated on nitrogen-doped carbon foam (NCF) using a two-step hydrothermal approach wherein, Ni–Co hydroxide was obtained in the first step followed by treatment with Na2S to form NiCo2S4 nanostructures. NiCo2S4/NCF exhibited greatly improved electrochemical performance, delivered a specific capacitance of 877 F g−1 at high current density of 20 A g−1, and possessed excellent cyclic stability. Its increased capacitance is due to NCF which provides an efficient and rapid pathway for ion and electron transport.138 A NiCo2S4 nanotube array was successfully synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method on carbon cloth as reported earlier. Size and morphology were controlled by manipulating the Co to Ni molar ratio. High capacitance of 1856 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 and 75.3% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 3000 cycles.139 Similarly, Xiong et al.140 synthesized a NiCo2S4 array on carbon fiber paper with different morphologies like nanofibers, nanotubes, and hollow nanoneedles via a hydrothermal method (Fig. 11). It was observed that out of all different morphologies, hollow nanoneedles showed the best performance with specific capacitance of 1154 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 835 F g−1 after 8000 cycles. Another attempt to synthesize NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays was made by Cia et al.141 Wherein, a Ni–Co hydroxide precursor was transformed to NiCo2S4 by hydrothermal treatment with sodium sulfide. For comparison, NiCo2O4 was synthesised by calcination of Ni–Co hydroxide. NiCo2S4 nanotubes on nickel foam delivered a capacitance of 15.58 F cm−2 at current density of 10 mA cm−2 which was found to be higher than NiCo2O4 (3.63 F cm−2). The enhanced performance can be attributed to their nanotube/nanoneedle architecture and the carbon/nickel substrate, which serves as a good current collector and ensures better conductivity.

NiCo2S4 nanosheets were successfully synthesized on activated multiporous carbon (AMC) by Wang et al.142via a hydrothermal method. They exhibited a high specific capacitance of 651 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 and at high current density of 10 A g−1; a specific capacitance of 573 F g−1 was retained. Chen et al. developed a one-step electro-deposition method to synthesize a Ni–Co sulfide nanosheets array on carbon substrate and used it as electrode material. High specific capacitance of 1418 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 was obtained and even at a higher current rate of 100 A g−1 a specific capacitance of 1285 F g−1 was retained. High performance is attributed to its nanosheet morphology which offers a high number of reaction sites.143 Sun et al.144 utilised carbon fiber paper/cloth as a substrate for the synthesis of NiCo2S4. A pure phase of NiCo2S4 was achieved on carbon fiber paper, which delivered a specific capacitance of 1.19 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. In another case, Hao et al.145 synthesised hollow NiCo2S4 nanotubes on carbon textile. Specific capacity of 1279 and 1004 F g−1 was obtained at current a density of 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. An asymmetric device with NiCo2S4/CT delivered an energy density of 40.1 W h kg−1 at power density of 451 W kg−1. The abundant mesopores on the nanotubes opens a large space which allows ion diffusion through it and carbon textile acts as a matrix for fast ion transport.
Mesoporous NiCo2S4 nanoparticles were synthesized with a simple solvothermal method using ethylene glycol as a solvent. The synthesized material possessed a large surface area of 42.8 m2 g−1. It delivered a specific capacitance of 1440 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and 91.7% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles. Interestingly, an energy density of 28.3 W h kg−1 was obtained at a power density of 245 W kg−1.146 Hollow Ni–Co sulfide was synthesized via a solvothermal method followed by subsequent sulfurization in a hydrothermal system. The hollow spheres showed a high surface area of 248 m2 g−1. As electrode material it showed a specific capacitance of 935 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and at a higher current rate of 10 A g−1, a capacitance of 667 F g−1 was retained.147
Unique hollow hexagonal nano plate-like structure were synthesized via a template method based on the Kirkendall effect. As electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 437 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, at 20 A g−1 and 53.2% of capacitance was retained.149 Novel ball-in-ball hollow structures of ternary nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4) were successfully synthesized by Shen et al.148via a facile anion exchange method. When used as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors, Ni–Co sulfide hollow spheres delivered a specific capacitance of 1036 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Fig. 10b shows the detailed FESEM and TEM images of samples at various stages of the reaction. Hollow mesoporous NiCo2S4 ellipsoids were synthesised by Hou et al.150via a solvothermal method using ethylene glycol. Specific capacitance of 607 F g−1 and 495 F g−1 was obtained at 3 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. An activated carbon asymmetrical device showed an energy density of 28.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 187 W kg−1. In a unique approach, hollow spheres with flaky structures were synthesised via a one-pot hydrothermal method by Wei et al.151 Specific capacitance of 1366 F g−1 and 700 F g−1 was obtained at 1 F g−1 and 20 F g−1 with capacitance retention of 89.8% after 2000 cycles.
Wang et al.152 used an easy and simple precipitation method for the synthesis of porous Ni–Co sulfide. A specific capacitance of 1259 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1 and even at a higher current density of 50 A g−1 it retained a capacitance of 945 F g−1. When fabricated as a device, it showed a high energy density of 44 W h kg−1 at a power density of 954 W kg−1. The enhanced performance can be attributed to its porous morphology which increases the electro-active sites, contact area between electrode material, and electrolyte and high conductivity of Ni–Co sulfide. A high boiling-point solvent was employed to synthesize mesoporous NiCo2S4 which had a high surface area of 223 m2 g−1. A specific capacitance of 406 C g−1 was obtained at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 93.7% after 20000 cycles.153 Xiao et al.154 synthesized a 3D cauliflower-like NiCo2S4 architecture via a microwave method. As electrode material, it exhibited a high capacitance of 1471 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 94.9% of initial capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles.
Xu et al.155 synthesised hollow Ni–Co sulfide with a unique nanobox morphology by tuning the metal ion concentration to form NiCo2S4 and Ni2CoS4. When investigated as electrode material, NiCo2S4 and Ni2CoS4 showed a specific capacitance of 1588 and 1200 F g−1 at a current rate of 2 A g−1, respectively. The reaction kinetics of cobalt ions are much faster than that of nickel ions during charge/discharge, resulting in lower redox potential of NiCo2S4 than Ni2CoS4 due to its intrinsic electrochemical response to the electrolyte. After 4000 cycles it was found that 90.5% retention was attained by Ni2CoS4 which is higher than NiCo2S4 (88.2%); this is due to the structural instability of the higher content of Co ions in NiCo2S4. In another case, Ni–Co sulfides were synthesised via a one-step hydrothermal co-deposition method using Na2S2O3 as the sulphur source. Specific capacitance of 954 F g−1 (1 A g−1) and 99% of capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles.156 Kong et al.157 synthesised a core–shell nanostructure with NiCo2S4 nanotubes wrapped with NiCo2S4 nanosheets. Specific capacity of 1948 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 with 94% of initial capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. An asymmetrical device was set up with carbon as porous carbon, which delivered an energy density of 10.6 W h kg−1 with power density of 2.47 kW kg−1 at a current density of 16 mA cm−2. In another report, cauliflower-like NiCo2S4 was synthesised via a solvothermal method which showed a specific capacitance of 2445 F g−1 and 1687 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Low cost activated balsam pear pulp was used as an electrode material with NiCo2S4 nanoparticles to fabricate an asymmetrical device.158
NiCo2S4/carbon/metal oxide composites. 
In order to enhance the electrochemical properties of binary metal sulfides, researchers have attempted various strategies such as: (a) to make a composite with various carbon-based materials like reduced graphene oxide (rGO), single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) to enhance electron transport in the active material. (b) To make composite with metal hydroxides/oxides/sulfides like Ni(OH)2, Ni–Co hydroxide, NiCo2O4, MnO2, Ni3V2O8, and CoS to enhance the electro-active sites; also, they undergo faradic mechanism/reaction to contribute to the overall enhanced capacitance. Table 2 highlights various reports on Ni–Co sulfide and their composites. It lists various synthesis methods involved, potential window, electrolyte, surface area, capacitance, rate performance, power density, and energy density of Ni–Co sulfides and their composites. Detailed studies on these approaches are discussed in this section.

Wen et al.159 synthesized NiCo2S4/MWCNTs hybrids via a simple solvothermal reaction and fabricated an asymmetrical supercapacitor. NiCo2S4 with 5 wt% MWCNT showed the highest specific capacitance of 2080 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and, at higher current density of 20 A g−1, it delivered a capacitance of 1270 F g−1 with 85.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Fascinatingly, when fabricated as an asymmetrical supercapacitor with rGO, a high energy density of 51.8 W h kg−1 was obtained at a power density of 865 W kg−1. The enhanced performance is due to the presence of MWCNT which acts as a mini current collector and increase the flow of electrons. Recently, Beka et al.160 synthesised MWCNT/NiCo2S4 core/shell hybrid nanostructures via a two-step hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 1423 F g−1 and 1005 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 2.5 A g−1 and 25 A g−1 respectively, whereas bare NiCo2S4 delivered a specific capacitance of 933 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 and 78 F g−1 at 25 A g−1. MWCNT/NiCo2S4 retained 81.4% of its initial capacitance after 4000 cycles. The MWCNT core acts as a pseudocapacitive active material with excellent conductivity and better mechanical stability.
Li et al.161 used carbon nanotubes (CNT) as a composite material to synthesize a CNT/NiCo2S4 composite via a simple chemical bath deposition method. Compared to bare NiCo2S4, the CNT/NiCo2S4 composite exhibited a better specific capacitance of 1537 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and even at 100 A g−1 it retained a capacitance of 1200 F g−1. And, 91.5% of the initial capacitance was retained after 3000 charging–discharging cycles. Similarly, Lu et al.162 synthesised NiCo2S4/CNT via a simple reflux method. High specific capacitance of 2210 F g−1 and 1591 F g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1 and 60 A g−1. An asymmetrical device with activated carbon showed an energy density of 67.9 W h kg−1 at power density of 23.9 kW kg−1. The increase in capacitance in both the cases is due to CNT which was used as conductive matrix and increased the rate of electron transport. The role of CNT is to provide a highly conductive support; it provides a favourable pathway for improving conductivity and facilitates charge transfer within bulk electrode materials. Also, it provides good mechanical strength and enhances stability as explained by Lu et al.162
Ultrathin NiCo2S4 nano sheets were successfully grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 8(a). In the absence of rGO, NiCo2S4 formed a hollow spherical structure. A NiCo2S4/rGO hybrid electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 1161 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and even after 2000 cycles it retained 1108 F g−1 (4.5% loss) which was higher than a bare NiCo2S4 hollow structure (18% loss). Fig. 8 (3 and 4) shows the variation of specific capacitance at different current rates and their cyclic stability.106 In another case, Li et al.163 used reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as composite material to synthesize NiCo2S4/rGO hybrid and NiCo2S4 hollow spheres via a hydrothermal method. NiCo2S4/rGO hybrid delivered a specific capacitance of 1805 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Thus, rGO provides a better electron transfer path and accounts for the increase in conductivity. 3D hierarchical architecture Ni–Co sulfide was successfully synthesized and modified using reduced graphene oxide by Gao et al.164 A modified electrode showed a specific capacitance of 1152 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and reached 971 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 which was higher than unmodified Ni–Co sulfide. Reduced graphene oxide greatly increased the electrode conductivity and thereby enhanced the overall electrochemical performance. Cai et al.165 synthesised NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on rGO nanosheets via a one pot refluxing method (at a temp of 180 °C). The NiCo2S4/rGO composite delivered a specific capacitance of 1484 F g−1, whereas bare NiCo2S4 showed 835 F g−1 and 83% of initial capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles for this composite. Here, rGO serves as a perfect matrix for NiCo2S4 nanoparticles which improves the conductivity of NiCo2S4 and provides a pathway for fast charge transfer. In another approach, a one-step solvothermal method was employed for the synthesis of NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on graphene (GR) sheets without the use of surfactants. NiCo2S4/GR high specific capacitance of 1708 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 compared to bare NiCo2S4 (950 F g−1). An asymmetrical device fabricated with carbon black and NiCo2S4/GR delivered an energy density of 17 kW kg−1 at power density of 37.7 W h kg−1.166 Recently, Annamalai et al.167 reported a porous NiCo2S4 nanostructure on rGO synthesised via a facile synthesis method. Specific capacitance of 1498 F g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1. Wang et al.168 employed a one-step solvothermal method for synthesis of Ni–Co sulfide nanoparticles on graphene. The Ni–Co sulfide/graphene composite delivered a specific capacitance of 1437 F g−1 and 671 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and 50 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 92.5% after 5000 cycles. An asymmetrical device was constructed with rGO hydrogel which delivered an energy density of 39.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1778 W kg−1.
Xu et al.169 fabricated NiCo2S4@rGO@CNT as electrode material for a supercapacitor. A specific capacitance of 1242.5 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 2 A g−1 which was found be higher than bare NiCo2S4. A unique carbon source with tubular architecture was derived from Juncus roenerianus and used as a substrate with inner and outer side coated with Ni–Co sulfide nanotubes. This unique architecture showed a specific capacitance of 747 F g−1 and 507.9 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1. When investigated as an asymmetrical device with activated carbon, it delivered an energy density of 27.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 236.3 W kg−1.170
Zou et al.171 synthesized carbon coated NiCo2S4 directly on graphene/Ni substrate via a hydrothermal method followed by sulfurization. Specific capacity of 253 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 was obtained and only loss of 6.1% of initial capacity was observed after 5000 cycles which was higher than NiCo2S4 without carbon coating (2.3 times). The carbon coating was proved to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode material. Carbon@NiCo2S4 nanorods were synthesised by Li et al.172via a hydrothermal method using carbon supported nickel nanorods which act as surfactant and nickel source. Morphology of NiCo2S4 was controlled using H2O2 during hydrothermal treatment, which forms a porous structure. However, specific capacitance of 1455 F g−1 and 1262 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1 respectively with capacitance retention of 83% after 2000 cycles.
Unique 3D Ni–Co hydroxide/Ni–Co sulfide/graphene/Ni-foam was successfully fabricated by Tao et al.173 A Ni–Co hydroxide/Ni–Co sulfide/graphene electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 2001 F g−1 and retained 1646 F g−1 at high current density of 8 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. A little addition of K3Fe(CN)6 to a KOH electrolyte provided an exceptional increase in the performance of its electrochemical properties and increased its specific capacitance to 6283 F g−1 at 6 A g−1. Recently, Luo et al.174 synthesised a NiCo2S4/Ni–Co double hydroxide via a vapor-phase hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 1765 F g−1 and 940 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 56% after 2000 cycles. The performance of these materials can be further enhanced by compositing with conductive materials like rGO, CNT, PPy, etc. This unique vapor-phase hydrothermal approach can be further extended for the synthesis of other binary metal sulfides such as ZnCo2S4, FeCo2S4, CuCo2S4, etc.
Li et al.175 synthesised a hierarchical NiCo2S4@Co(OH)2 nanotube array via a hydrothermal method followed by an electro-deposition method. As electrode material, it exhibited an areal capacitance of 9.6 F cm−2 and 6.4 F cm−2 at current density of 2 mA cm−2 and 32 mA cm−2, respectively. With activated carbon, an asymmetrical device delivered an energy density of 35.89 W h kg−1 at power density of 0.4 kW kg−1. The smart combination of NiCo2S4 and Co(OH)2 contribute to an overall boosted performance. In another attempt to enhance the performance of NiCo2S4, Nguyen et al.176 synthesised mesoporous NiCo2S4@Ni(OH)2 core sheet nanosheets on conductive carbon cloth substrate. High capacity of 209 mA h cm−2 was obtained at current density of 20 mA cm−2 with excellent capacity retention of 94.5% after 2000 cycles. Its high capacity can be attributed to its unique structure which provides high electro-active sites and the carbon cloth helps promote better conductivity.
Raj et al.177 fabricated a NiCo2O4/NiCo2S4 hybrid nanostructure on Ni foam via a facile ammonia evaporation technique. This hybrid structure exhibited a specific capacitance of 3671 F g−1 at 1.8 A g−1 and at 9 A g−1 it maintained a specific capacitance of 2767 F g−1 and 84% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. NiCo2S4@NiCo2O4 nanocolumn arrays (NCAs) were fabricated on carbon textiles by Cheng et al.178 A specific capacitance of 2259 and 1139 F g−1 was obtained at current densities of 0.5 and 12.5 A g−1, respectively. A high energy density of 44.06 W h kg−1 was obtained at high power density of 6.4 kW kg−1 with capacitance retention of 92.5% after 6000 cycles.
Highly conductive NiCo2S4 single crystalline nanotubes arrays were successfully grown on flexible carbon fiber paper (FCP) and later a series of electro-active metal oxides were deposited onto it via electro-deposition. Out of various electro-active metal oxides like MnO2, FeOOH, and CoxNi(1−x)(OH)2, the CoxNi(1−x)(OH)2/NiCo2S4 composite exhibited highest specific capacitance of 2.9 F cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2 and better cycling stability (96% retention after 2000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2).179
Core–shell structured NiCo2S4 were successfully synthesized by tuning the ratios of Ni to Co via a simple two-step hydrothermal method which delivered a specific capacity of 155 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good cyclic stability.180 In another case, hierarchical NiCo2S4@NiCoxSy core/shell nanoarrays were grown on carbon cloth which apparently showed a better performance than bare NiCo2S4. NiCoxSy was coated on NiCo2S4 nanotubes via an electro-deposition technique. An areal capacitance of 3.9 F cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and at 50 mA cm−2 it could deliver a capacitance of 2.9 F cm−2. The enhanced performance is mainly due to the presence of carbon cloth which acts as an efficient current collector and its unique core–shell structure provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions.181 In another report, Yang et al.182 reported hierarchical NiCo2S4@Ni(OH)2 core–shell hybrid nanosheet arrays on Ni foam delivered a specific capacitance of 240 mA h g−1 at 5 mA cm−2 with cycling stability of 81.4% over 2000 cycles. Ni(OH)2 nanosheet coating provides numerous accessible channels for ion diffusion. A unique hybrid nanostructure, when fabricated as an asymmetric supercapacitor device with activated carbon as negative electrode, showed an energy density of 53.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 290 W kg−1. Yan et al.183 synthesized a NiCo2S4@PPy core–shell hetero-structure nanotube array on Ni foam and used it as electrode material without any conductive binder. Polypyrrole helps enhancement of capacitance as it contributes to pseudo-capacitance and also builds a better electron pathway with active material for enhanced electron transport. High areal capacitance of 9.8 F cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 and when an asymmetric device was assembled with activated carbon, it delivered a high energy density of 34.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 120.2 W kg−1. In 2017, Chen et al.184 fabricated NiCo2S4@PPy core–shell hybrid nanosheets on nickel foam via a hydrothermal method followed by electro-deposition. As electrode material, NiCo2S4@PPy delivered a high areal capacitance of 800 μA h cm−2 at current density of 5 mA cm−2 which was found to be twice that of pristine NiCo2S4 (383.9 μA h cm−2). An aqueous hybrid supercapacitor was assembled with NiCo2S4@PPy and activated carbon as electrodes, which delivered high energy and power density. Two such devices connected in series could light 38 LEDs effectively, which shows the potential of these nanostructures for practical applications.
To enhance the electrochemical performance of binary metal sulfides, researchers have attempted to incorporate metal oxides/sulfide in the binary metal sulfides matrix to come up with a unique design of an electrode material. Yang et al.185 constructed a unique architecture of MnO2 nano flake wrapped around NiCo2S4 nanotubes via a one-step hydrothermal method followed by carbonization treatment. The nanostructure delivered a specific capacitance of 1337 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 which was higher compared to bare NiCo2S4 (799 F g−1). Interestingly, 82% of capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles (50% for bare NiCo2S4). This enhanced performance of MnO2/NiCo2S4 is due to the outer MnO2 shell which helps to absorb cations on the electrode surface and undergoes an intercalation/de-intercalation process. Another similar approach was made by Xu et al.186 where hierarchical NiCo2S4@MnO2 core–shell nanosheets were grown on nickel foam. Areal capacitance of 2.6 F cm−2 was obtained at current density of 3 mA cm−2. Interestingly, 103.9% of capacitance was retained after 5000 cycles. Cyclic stability of NiCo2S4@MnO2 can be attributed to MnO2 acting as buffer for volume change during cycle tests. Fascinated by the architecture, Chen et al.187 developed unique NiCo2S4@MnO2 heterostructures via a mild hydrothermal method. Specific capacitance of 520 F g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 86.8% after 2000 cycles. In another approach, He et al.188 synthesised unique NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 core–shell nanotubes via a hydrothermal method followed by an electro-deposition method. High capacitance of 4.25 C cm−2 and 3.12 C cm−2 was obtained at current density of 4 mA cm−2 and 40 mA cm−2, respectively. An asymmetrical device with NiCo2S4@Ni3S2 and 3D rGO aerogel as electrodes was fabricated which delivered an energy density of 32.75 W h kg−1 at power density of 0.36 kW kg−1. To further enhance the cycling stability of Ni–Co sulfides, Huang et al.189 synthesised NiCo2S4/NiO core–shell nanowires via a similar approach as Hu et al. It showed a specific capacity of 12.2 F cm−2 at current density of 1 mA cm−2 with excellent stability of 89% after 10000 cycles. This unique electrode material was evaluated for an asymmetrical device which showed a superior energy density of 30.38 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.288 kW kg−1. Enhanced performance can be attributed to the unique NiCo2S4/NiO nanostructure. In yet another interesting case, Jia et al.190 demonstrated a unique hybrid of NiCo2S4/Fe2O3 nanoneedles as an electrode material for SC, which showed a specific capacitance of 352 F g−1 at current density of 5 mV s−1. An asymmetrical device was constructed with MnO2 and NiCo2S4/Fe2O3 as electrode material, which delivered an energy density of 2.29 mW h cm−2 at a power density of 196 mW cm−2.
Fu et al.191 fabricated CoS nanosheets via an electro-deposition technique on NiCo2S4 nanotubes synthesised by a hydrothermal method. This nanostructured architecture showed an areal capacitance of 4.7 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and 76.1% of initial capacitance was retained after 1500 cycles. CoS nanosheets coating on NiCo2S4 nanotubes provides a more effective pathway for electrons compared to bare NiCo2S4 nanotubes. Also, this nanostructured architecture with open and loose structures possesses enough space and surface for fast reversible faradaic reactions. Similarly, Zeng et al.192 tried a reverse architecture of NiCo2S4 nanosheets on CoS nanotubes synthesised on Ni foam. Wherein, areal capacitance of 7.6 F cm−2 was obtained at 5 mA cm−2 and 71.7% of initial capacitance was retained after 3000 cycles which was higher than previous results obtained by Fu et al. Here, CoS serves as a scaffold, providing a large surface for the growth of NiCo2S4 nanosheets and the growth of CoS on Ni foam provides robust adhesion which enhances the electrical conductivity. Very recently, hollow mesoporous NiCo2S4/Co9S8 submicro-spindles were successfully synthesised by Hou et al.193 Pseudo-capacitance of 749 F g−1 and 620 F g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1 and 15 A g−1. A fabricated asymmetrical device showed high energy density of 33.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 150 W kg−1.
Chen et al.194 developed a distinctive approach, wherein they synthesised NiCo2S4 tubes on NiCo2O4 nanosheets and used it as electrode material. High specific capacitance of 4.3 F cm−1 was attained at 5 mA cm−1 with capacitance retention of 3.5 F cm−1 after 5000 cycles. When fabricated as an asymmetric supercapacitor it delivered an energy density of 24.9 W h kg−1 at power density of 334 W kg−1. NiCo2S4 nanotubes on the NiCo2S4 nanosheets possess a much higher specific surface, which helps in full utilization of electro-active material for energy storage and also provides good contact between the active material and electrolyte. In another attempt, Niu et al.195 synthesised a NiCo2S4 core with uniformly distributed Ni3V2O8 nanoparticles as a shell via a hydrothermal followed by a co-precipitation method. Specific capacitance of 512 C g−1 was obtained at 1 A g−1 and as an asymmetric supercapacitor it showed an energy density of 42.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 200 W kg−1. Incorporation of Ni3V2O8 shell enhanced the capacity by providing highly electro-active sites.
In another case, the same strategy was employed to synthesize NiCo2S4–graphene–MoS2 which showed a specific capacitance of 1270 F g−1 at low current density of 1 A g−1. At a higher current density of 5 A g−1 it delivered a capacitance of 1002 F g−1 and excellent cycle stability of 94.8% retention after 4000 cycles.196 Tingting et al.197 synthesised NiCo2S4 on a nitrogen and sulphur functionalized graphene aerogel (N,S MGS) and used it as electrode material for a SC application. NiCo2S4/N,S MGA delivered a specific capacitance of 822 F g−1 and 556 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively.
Other than composite materials like rGO, CNT, MWCNT, metal hydroxide, metal oxide, and metal sulfide, recently Li et al.198 synthesised NiCo2S4 nanosheets on porous carbon nitride nanosheets and used them as electrode material for SC applications. Interestingly, specific capacity of 506 C g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1 with 100% capacitance retention after 1500 cycles. This suggests good cycle stability of a NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 electrode for practical applications. An asymmetric device was constructed with activated carbon which delivered an energy density of 16.7 W h kg−1 at power density of 200 W kg−1. This device fabricated with NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 could run a mini fan for about a minute, suggesting its importance in practical applications. The authors suggested that the enhanced performance can be attributed to unique sheet on sheet architecture which provides a short ion pathway. This result gives a platform for researches to explore the possibilities of metal nitrides as a composite material along with binary metal oxides and sulfides for various energy applications.
In another attempt to enhance the performance of NiCo2S4, Ketjen black was used as a composite material by Peng et al.199 NiCo2S4/Ketjen black nanocomposite delivered an areal specific capacity of 10.1 F cm−2 at current density of 10 mA cm−2 with 92% initial capacitance retention after 6000 cycles. High conductivity and surface area of Ketjen black along with NiCo2S4 nanostructures contribute to the overall enhanced performance. Similarly, Zhu et al.200 decorated acetylene black on NiCo2S4 hollow microspheres and used them as electrode material for an asymmetrical SC application which delivered an energy density of 24.7 W h kg−1 at power density of 428 W kg−1.
Wang et al.201 reported the use of NiCo2S4 hybridised with tryptophan functionalised graphene quantum dots (Trp-GQD) as electrode material for a SC application. Specific capacitance of 1453 F g−1 and 455 F g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. An asymmetrical device with NiCo2S4/Trp-GQD and activated carbon delivered an energy density of 157 W h kg−1 at power density of 800 W kg−1. A tryptophan functionalised graphene quantum dot hybrid enhanced the conductivity of NiCo2S4 and improved the mechanical strength of the binder layer.


3.3.2. CoNi2S4. 
Hu et al.112 synthesized CoNi2S4 nanosheets on Ni foam via a two-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 9). As electrode material, CoNi2S4 nanosheets delivered a high specific capacitance of 2906 F g−1 with higher areal capacitance of 6.3 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2. Most importantly, an asymmetric supercapacitor cell was set up using CoNi2S4 nanosheets arrays as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode; it exhibited a high energy density of 33.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 409 W kg−1. Fig. 9c shows the FESEM images of the Ni–Co precursor and Ni–Co sulfide, respectively. Excellent performance can be attributed to its unique nanosheet-like structure and also good mechanical and electrical contact with high electrical conductivity and transport rate. CoNi2S4 nanosheets were successfully synthesized on Ni-foam using a one-step potentiostatic deposition method for the first time. A capacitance of 1932 F g−1 was obtained at 2 A g−1 and 1640 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. After 1000 cycles, 89.2% of initial capacitance was retained.211 In another case, nanostructured CoNi2S4 were successfully grown on a carbon substrate via a precursor transformation method. Different morphologies were obtained by varying the anions of Ni–Co salts. Material with NO3− as anion delivered a high capacitance of 2714 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.212
Wang et al.213 reported CoNi2S4 flower-like nanosheets on Ni foam and porous Ni via a one-step electro-deposition method and then used as a binder-free electrode material for a supercapacitor. It was found that the porous Ni/CoNi2S4 delivered a better specific areal capacitance of 1999 mF cm−2 compared to that of Ni foam/CoNi2S4 (1552 mF cm−2) and it also possessed a cyclic stability of almost 98.5% of its initial capacitance after 1500 cycles. The excellent performance of the porous Ni/CoNi2S4 integrated electrode was attributed to the high surface area associated with the CoNi2S4 flower-like nanosheets and also the porous nature of Ni skeleton current collectors. Du et al.214 synthesised CoNi2S4 nanoparticles via a solvothermal method with specific capacitance of 1636 F g−1 and 1351 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and 5 A g−1, respectively. An asymmetrical device was fabricated with activated carbon which showed an energy density of 36.7 W h kg−1 at power density of 7630 W kg−1. This asymmetrical device was successful in lighting up a LED and drive a rotating motor, which shows the potential of CoNi2S4 for real applications.
CoNi2S4/Graphene nanocomposites were successfully developed by Du et al.215 using a facile physical approach. A maximum specific capacitance of 2009 F g−1 was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1 and a specific capacitance of 755 F g−1 was retained at 4 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. The enhancement in its capacitance is due to the presence of graphene which acts as a conductive network and helps in efficient charge transport. The same group synthesized CoNi2S4 nanoparticles using a one-step solvothermal method which showed a specific capacitance of 1330 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1. After 2000 cycles it only retained 378 F g−1.216 Novel 3D flower-like CoNi2S4/CNT composites were synthesized by precursor transformation followed by an anion exchange reaction. As electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 2094 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 83.4% of its initial capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1.217 Tang et al.218 used reduced graphene oxide as composite material for the synthesis of CoNi2S4/rGO using a solvo-thermal route without any template. A CoNi2S4/rGO nanocomposite showed a high capacitance of 1709 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and at a high current rate of 10 A g−1, it retained capacitance of 1268 F g−1. In another case, Beka et al.219 reported the synthesis of flower-like CoNi2S4 on 3D graphene decorated Ni foam via a two-step hydrothermal method. It delivered a specific capacitance of 6.53 F cm−2 at a current density of 6 mA cm−2 with cycle stability of 85% after 3500 cycles. Its enhanced performance is due to the introduction of a graphene layer between Ni foam and CoNi2S4 which provides good mechanical contact and also increases conductivity. Zhao et al.220 reported a unique architecture of CoNi2S4 nanosheets with SiC nanowires on a carbon cloth as electrode material for a supercapacitor using a hydrothermal method which delivered a specific capacitance of 231 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. When fabricated as an asymmetrical capacitor with activated carbon on Ni foam as the negative electrode, it delivered a high energy density of 57.8 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1.6 kW kg−1. Tang et al.221 fabricated a flexible device using flexible nickel foam coated with CoNi2S4/NiSe material. Specific capacitance of 311 mF cm−2 and 136 mF cm−2 was obtained at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 and 15 mA cm−2 with 97% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles.
Recently, in 2017, He et al.208 synthesised bouquet-like NiCo2O4/CoNi2S4 nanoarrays via a hydrothermal method followed by an electro-deposition method. This unique architecture delivered a specific capacitance of 6.25 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 which was found to be higher than the individual NiCo2O4 (1.08 F cm−2) and CoNi2S4 (1.25 F cm−2). And 88% of its initial capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles. This article suggested that the combination of oxides and sulfides can deliver a better performance compared to individual oxides and sulfides.


3.3.3. CuCo2S4. 
CuCo2S4 was synthesized via a solvothermal method using different solvents and then used as an electrode material for a supercapacitor for the first time by Tang et al.222 Materials obtained using glycerol displayed ultrahigh capacitance of 5030 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 and at higher current density of 70 A g−1, it retained a specific capacitance of 1365 F g−1. Similarly, mesoporous CuCo2S4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by Zhu et al.223via a simple solvothermal method using ethylene glycol. As obtained CuCo2S4 nanoparticles exhibited a better performance with a specific capacitance of 752 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 98.1% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. Recently, hierarchical CuCo2S4 hollow nanoneedle arrays were successfully synthesized on Ni foam using a facile template-free hydrothermal method and then used as binder-free electrodes. It exhibited a specific capacitance of 2163 F g−1 at 6 mA cm−2. The synthesized materials showed exceptional high cycle stability i.e., after 5000 cycles 98.7% of initial capacitance was obtained.224 Shen et al.225 constructed a 3D CuCo2S4/CNT/Graphene nanocomposite as electrode material for a supercapacitor which showed a specific capacitance of 504 F g−1 at a high current rate of 10 A g−1. Guo et al.226 synthesized CuCo2S4 on nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets via a one-step solvothermal method as shown in Fig. 12. As electrode material, it showed high specific capacitance of 1005 A g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. Interestingly, at high current rate of 50 A g−1 it could still deliver a capacitance of 770 F g−1. The increase in its performance is mainly due to the presence of nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets which allow a large area of active sites and also act as a conductive network. In another attempt, Liu et al.227 synthesised a porous CuCo2S4/graphene composite using a simple hydrothermal method. As electrode material, CuCo2S4/graphene could deliver a capacitance of 425 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and could retain 370 F g−1 at current density of 10 A g−1 with capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles. Recently, Xu et al.228 synthesised CuCo2S4via an improved solvothermal method. Specific capacitance of 449.6 F g−1 and 401 F g−1 was achieved at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 5 A g−1, respectively. CuCo2S4 with activated carbon was fabricated to form an asymmetrical device which showed an energy density of 15 W h kg−1 at power density of 422.5 W kg−1. These results suggest the potential of Cu–Co sulfide as electrode material for practical applications.

3.3.4. Other binary metal sulfides. 
Tong et al.229 grew Zn–Co sulfide on carbon nanotubes/nitrogen-doped graphene (NGN/CNTs) via a hydrothermal method followed by a sulfidation process. The synthesized material was used as an electrode without any conductive binders; it delivered a high specific capacitance of 2484 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and, interestingly, almost 0% fade was observed after 10000 sustaining charge/discharges at current density of 30 A g−1 which shows excellent cycling stability of the ternary sulfide. Yang et al.58 used a facile oil phase approach to synthesize Zn–Co sulfide and then applied it as electrode material for both a lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor. In the supercapacitor application, as electrode material it delivered a specific capacitance of 486 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. At a high current rate of 5 A g−1, 86.4% of initial capacitance was retained even after 2000 cycles.
Ramasamy et al.230 highlighted the importance of unique capacitance for intercalation of CuSbS2 in energy storage applications. As electrode material, a specific capacitance of 619, 697, and more than 1160 F g−1 resulted for LiOH, NaOH, and KOH electrolytes, respectively. It was found that lithium ions can be intercalated between the van der Waals layers without distorting the CuSbS2 structure which paves a way to explore the importance of CuSbS2 as electrode material in Li-ion battery applications.
CoMoS4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via a co-precipitation method and investigated as electrode material for a supercapacitor for the first time. A high specific capacitance of 415 F g−1 was obtained at a low current density of 0.5 A g−1 but, impressively, it showed an excellent cyclic stability with 100% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at current density of 2 A g−1.231 To further enhance the performance, Xu et al.232 explored the importance of CoMoS4 as electrode material for a supercapacitor. CoMoS4 was synthesized via a simple precipitation method which showed a capacitance of 661 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The high capacitance of CoMoS4 may be attributed to the multiple oxidation states, the synergistic effect of presence of Co and Mo, and high conductivity of sulfides. Yang et al.233 synthesized Co3S4/CoMo2S4 (CMS) ultrathin nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a one-step hydrothermal method and then used them as electrode material for a supercapacitor. It delivered a specific capacitance of 1458 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and favourable cycling stability of 97% after 2000 cycles. When fabricated as an asymmetric supercapacitor it exhibited a maximum energy density of 33 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.85 kW kg−1.
Liu et al.234 studied the electrochemical properties of flower-like Mn–Co oxysulfide nanoparticles prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Impressively, as electrode material it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 490 C g−1 at 2 A g−1 which was far better than that of Mn–Co oxides. After 3000 cycles, 86.5% of initial capacitance was retained at 20 A g−1 which shows good cycling stability. Later, Pramanik et al.235 synthesized carbon doped MnCo2S4 micro-cubes on Ni-foam via a solvothermal method. High specific capacitance of 1892 C g−1 was obtained at a current density of 5 A g−1 and 91% of capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles. Recently, Sahoo et al.236 reported porous manganese–cobalt–sulfide on Ni foam using an electro-deposition method. It exhibited excellent pseudo-capacitive behaviour with specific capacitance of 2421 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and even at 8 A g−1 it could still deliver a capacitance of 2000 F g−1.
Kumar et al.237 reported NiV2S4 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam via an anion exchange reaction and its use as electrode material for an asymmetrical capacitor. As electrode material it delivered a specific capacitance of 639 C g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 with capacitance retention of 90.7% at 30 mA cm−2 after 2000 cycles. Enhanced performance of the sulfide is mainly due to its low electronegativity and larger atomic size of sulphur, which creates a robust structure and helps with better transport properties. When fabricated as an asymmetrical capacitor with activated carbon as the anode it showed an energy density of 45.1 W h kg−1 and power density of 240 W kg−1.
To enhance the stability ternary sulfides, Shen et al.238 demonstrated novel FeNi2S4–graphene–MoSe2 composite electrode materials for supercapacitor applications via a hydrothermal method. As electrode material, it delivered a specific capacitance of 1700 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Interestingly, specific capacitance of 106% was retained after 4000 cycles which shows a better stability of the active material. In another strategy, Tang et al.239 modified FeNi2S4 with graphene and CNT to form a FeNi2S4/CNT/graphene nanocomposite which showed a specific capacitance of 725 F g−1 at high current density of 10 A g−1. The electrode showed a capacitance retention of 88% after 2500 cycles.
In 2016 for the first time, Tang et al.240 explored the importance of FeCo2S4 as an electrode material for SC. Square FeCo2S4 tubes were synthesised via a controlled sulfidation process which delivered a specific capacitance of 2411 F g−1 and 1742 F g−1 at current density of 5 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2. An asymmetrical solid state device was constructed with FeCo2S4//3DPNG which showed an energy density of 76.1 W h kg−1 at power density of 755 W kg−1. The authors suggest the superior performance of FeCo2S4 can be attributed to a rich redox reaction due to variable vacancies of Fe element and also due to its unique morphology. Zhu et al.207 fabricated a flexible electrode using a silver sputtered textile and coated with FeCo2S4–NiCo2S4 composite. Specific capacitances of 1518 F g−1 and 1296 F g−1 were obtained at current densities of 5 mA cm−2 and 40 mA cm−2, respectively. All fabricated solid state symmetrical devices showed high energy density of 46 W h kg−1 at power density of 1070 W kg−1 with stability of 92% after 3000 cycles. Table 3 highlights various other binary metal sulfides and their electrochemical properties e.g., specific capacitance, rate performance, capacity retention, energy, and power density.

4. Binary and ternary metal sulfides as counter electrode material for solar cells
4.1. Introduction
Sunlight, being an abundant source of energy, is undoubtedly capable of providing infinite and sustainable economic growth with minimal impact on the environment. And, in this direction, photovoltaics (PV) has been a very promising strategy so far. Research on first generation solar cells (silicon based) has continuously evolved with a focus on materials that are cost effective and that can harness the complete range of the solar spectrum. But, theoretically, the maximum achievable efficiency in these cells is only up to 33.7%.244 Nevertheless, they are durable and reliable. The second generation solar cells with processed thin films, although they are less costly, cannot yet stretch their efficiencies too far. The third generation solar cells are based on multiple electron hole pair generation and can allow their efficiencies to go much farther. Possible inclusions in this category are dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), and perovskite sensitized solar cells (PSSCs). Sensitizers in such cells, upon irradiation, absorb sunlight and generate electron hole pairs. The electron transport layer (ETL), usually a mesoporous oxide, accepts electrons from the sensitizers. The hole remains on the surface of the n-type absorber where the reduced specie of the electrolyte donates an electron to regenerate the sensitizer. The transported electrons and oxidized electrolyte species finally combine and complete the circuit at the counter electrode as shown in Fig. 13.

4.2. Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC)
DSSC has many advantages like easy synthesis methods for electrode materials and easy fabrication of cells. DSSC, although comparatively economical, have a platinum (Pt) electrode and expensive dye molecules which make up for the large portion of the cost involved. The high cost and limited reserves of platinum has encouraged researchers to find alternate materials for counter electrodes.
There are enormous amounts of research being done to replace the platinum electrode.245–248 Development of Pt-free counter electrode (CE) catalysts can make DSSCs more competitive among various photovoltaic devices in terms of cost effectiveness. A good catalytic and highly conductive CE material can rapidly reduce the oxidised redox couple (I3−) and regenerate sufficient amounts of reductant (I−) in the electrolyte such that as soon as the electron reaches the CE, it could prevent electron recombination and reduce the loss of photoelectrons to a large extent (Fig. 13).
Grätzel et al.249 were the first of a few to report the possible use of graphitic carbon as counter electrode material but were able to reach an efficiency of only 6.7%. However, since Lee et al.250 in 2008 were successful in achieving 7.56% performance, the pace of research in this field has become rapid and constituents like carbon materials, organic polymers, metal carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, tellurides, selenides, multiple compounds, and composites have been explored as alternate counter electrode materials. Theerthagiri et al.247 in 2015, and Wu et al.248 in 2014 compressively surveyed these findings. Further, in 2016 Chen et al.246 narrowed his review to list the findings on various forms of carbon material like microporous carbon, graphene, nitrogen-doped graphene, single-walled carbon nanotubes, and multi-wall carbon nanotube being used as CE material for DSSC. Carbon materials were reported to be promising candidates because of their low cost, high electron conductivity, good catalytic activity, thermal stability, and high corrosion resistance. However, their reduction capability and electrical conductivity still can't match up to those of Pt. Many researchers have expressed the few challenges that exist in preparing and applying these various carbon CEs in DSSCs.
Sulfides and selenides have shown huge potential for being used as CE materials and a number of photocatalytic and photoactive systems have been produced from these. Sulfides, namely CoS, MoS, WS2, NiS, etc., have been synthesized by various techniques and used as CE materials. They have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in catalysing I3− reduction. Some noteworthy contributions include the first use in 2009 of CoS being electrodeposited on ITO/polyethylene naphthalate substrate as CE to give much higher conversion efficiency than Pt.251 Also, MoS2 and WS2 have shown comparable, or much more, power conversion efficiencies over Pt–FTO due to good catalytic activity and low resistance to charge transfer and Pumera et al.252 comprehensively reviewed such reports. Stability and scale up challenges do exist. They suffer from inherent instabilities in presence of moisture. Such instabilities are not only present when using them as CE materials but also when being manufactured and processed. The last couple of years have witnessed a variety of binary and ternary chalcogenides being applied as CE materials. There are many reports on NiCo2S4, CoNi2S4, CoMoS4, NiMoS4, CulnS4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2ZnSnS4 as some alternative materials for Pt CE. Two different cations coexisting in a single crystal structure can facilitate the binary and ternary chalcogenides to have more complex functions and enrich redox reactions; these are highly promising for CE by future DSSC research. At this juncture, it seems timely to summarise the recent work, analyse a few developments, and suggest future prospects of how these materials influence PV technology. This review narrowly focuses on advances in the development of binary and ternary CE and their role in sensitised solar cells.

4.3.1. NiCo2S4. 
NiCo2S4 is widely used as CE material due to its high redox reaction capability. The distinct d-electronic configuration of Co(III) at the surface of NiCo2S4 has added to its excellent electrocatalytic properties. NiCo2S4 is expected to offer richer redox reactions due to the contributions from both nickel and cobalt ions. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites occupied by Ni2+ and Co3+ also provide more hopping of charges between Ni and Co cations compared to the single phase of metal sulfides.107 Various synthesis methods have been employed like hydrothermal, solvothermal, and electro-deposition methods and ion exchange reactions to improve overall performance. Most of them were either hydrothermally or solvothermally synthesized since they produce high-surface-area catalysts with a large number of active catalytic sites.
Lin et al.,254 for the first time in 2013, synthesized NiCo2S4 microspheres via a facile solvothermal method, followed by electrophoresis for deposition, to obtain a high transmittance (N75%) and excellent electro-catalytic activity with cell efficiency of 6.14%, and was comparable to that of conventional Pt CE. Fabrication of an electrode by electrophoretic deposition had numerous advantages: namely control of thickness, low process temperature, good rate of deposition with uniformity, and feasible large scale deposition without the use of any binders. Furthermore, Anuratha et al.255 used a simple one-step electrochemical deposition by a pulse reverse technique and obtained dendritic nanostructures. They possess short diffusion lengths and high specific surface areas of fractals and provide pathways for small molecules to penetrate through their branches and reach the internal catalyst surface sites. Shi et al.253 synthesised NiCo2S4 nanosheets on ITO substrate via low temperature hydrothermal method (Fig. 14).

Banerjee et al.256 synthesized a nano array of needle-like nickel cobalt sulfide by sulfurization (using H2S) of NiCo2O4 for good power conversion efficiency of 6.6% when used as CE (Fig. 15). But the concern of toxic H2S utilisation made Khoo et al.257 prepare NiCo2S4 nanosheets by using structure-directing agents, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and L-cysteine (L-Cys). Large exposed areas facilitated better electron transport and regeneration of I−/I3− to give efficiency (7.22%) much higher than Pt CE. Chi et al.258 tried to deposit these nanosheets on carbon fibres used as substrate. The large exposed electroactive area of nanosheets and void space (that allows redox ion diffusion) significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity and electron transport, enabling a higher catalytic performance toward I−/I3− redox regeneration, in comparison to conventional Pt–FTO CE. Nanowire arrays of NiCo2S4 were directly fabricated on FTO substrate by an ion–exchange reaction by Liu et al.259 for CE application. The solution-based IER avoids use of high temperatures and toxic gas sources such as H2S during the synthesis process. The efficiency obtained was comparable to that of old Pt CE (5.92). An observable narrowing of Epp as shown in a CV graph implies its strong ability to reduce I3− to I−.

In another case, Huang et al.261 obtained mirror-like nanoparticles of this sulfide and developed them in situ on FTO by a solvothermal method. Tafel polarization, CV, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), and impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the catalytic activities and conductivities of these Ni–Co–S CEs approached or exceeded those of Pt-pyrolysis CE. Even 1000 cycles of CV didn't alter the particle morphology, and also 98% of its overall performance was retained. Huo et al.262 in 2015 tried a composite of NiCo2S4, wherein flower-like microspheres of NiCo2S4/NiS were produced by a simple two-step hydrothermal method. And the combined effect exhibited a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and excellent electro-catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− and was able to reach an efficiency of 8.8% compared to DSSCs with Pt CE (8.1%). It can hence be concluded that performance is closely related to the synthesis method that resulted in crystalline type, particle shape, size, and also on stoichiometry. These binary metal sulfides have much lower intrinsic conductivities compared to Pt. They suffer from resistive voltage loss when compared to Pt and hence, addition of conductive media overcomes this shortcoming. But the mechanism by which these carbonaceous materials enhance efficiency was rarely discussed and Lu et al.260 reported the bi-functional activity of rGO wherein it acts as both co-catalyst in accelerating the tri-iodide reduction and a promotor of conductivity to decrease series resistance of the CE. Decrease of charge transfer resistance was more significant than the series resistance when rGO was coupled with the sulfide (Fig. 16). Highly crystalline nickel cobalt sulfide (NCS) micro-particles were mixed with a small portion of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nano-flakes. Krishnapriya et al.263 further substantiates the enhanced activity of NiCo2S4–graphene nanosheet hybrids due to better electronic conductivity and better adhesion caused by a synergistic coupling interaction (at the interfaces of NiCo2S4 and graphene nanosheets). It is important to mention that prospects of commercialization of NiCo2S4 have been demonstrated by Su et al.,264 in their very recently published work (Dec 2016) wherein a facile low cost solution method to synthesize large scale NiCo2S4 and dip coating to deposit them on FTO was well demonstrated with an efficiency beyond 8.5%. They further used a flexible substrate, namely indium doped tin oxide polyethylene naphthalate, which brings it much closer to a possibility of commercialization. Table 4 shows the literature on NiCo2S4 as counter electrode for DSSC.

4.3.2. CoNi2S4 as counter electrode. 
Binary compounds not only exhibit more complex functions, but also allow their properties to be readily tuneable by changing the stoichiometry of their components. Although not much of a difference in electro-catalytic activity or overall performance was observed, one can find researchers preferring nickel cobalt sulfide over cobalt nickel sulfide.
Chen et al.266 synthesized different morphologies like nanoribbons and nanorods (using different nickel precursors like nickel(II) acetate and nickel(II) sulfate respectively) via a hydrothermal method and obtained efficiencies up to 7.03% for ribbons, unlike rods that delivered an efficiency of only 4.1%. Pt CE showed an efficiency of 6.45%. A high specific surface area of a CE provides more catalytic sites for I3 reduction, which is favourable for regeneration of a dye sensitizer, thus enhancing catalytic performance. The intrinsic properties of CoNi2S4 nanoribbons and their polymorph nature, wherein a wide exposure of crystal facets contributed to significant distinction of conversion efficiency between two one-dimensional CoNi2S4 nanostructures.
Shi et al.267 synthesized CoNi2S4 nanostructures on a FTO substrate via a simple hydrothermal method at different reaction times (20, 90, and 300 min) at 130 °C. The electro-catalytic property of materials deduced from CV studies showed similar activity as that of Pt CE. The samples obtained at 90 min delivered the best catalytic capability and the lowest charge-transfer resistance, which is due to their formation of proper film thickness. Overall an efficiency of 4.61% was achieved with CoNi2S4 as a CE which was found to be comparable with Pt CE (4.67%) (Fig. 17).

4.3.3. CulnS2. 
CuInS2 (CIS) had earlier been exploited as an absorber layer for applications with solar cells. Due to its high absorption coefficient, relatively ideal direct band gap (1.5 eV), good stability under light radiation, and easy conversion of n/p carrier type, researchers have studied its electro-catalytic activity with respect to use as CE in DSSCs.268 Yao et al.269 in 2013 synthesized, via solution method CuInS2 (CIS) nanocrystals, NCs free of surfactant by exchanging organic capping ligands with inorganic ions S2−. This enhanced the active surface area, inter-particle coupling, and charge transport and they were able to achieve efficiency up to 6.53% that was much higher than Pt CE. Considering the low charge mobility in CIS NPs coming from the random boundaries between NPs, Zhou et al.270 and Liu et al.271 in 2014 made micro and nano spheres of CuInS2 by solvo and hydrothermal methods, respectively and obtained their composites of rGO. As previously mentioned, rGO improves the surface area for enhanced capture of electrons from a redox couple, adhesion of CIS particles, and also visible light absorption. And rGO also facilitates decrease of light reflection from CE to photoanode and ensures better energy conversion efficiency. Chen et al.272 in 2015 used a unique synthesis technique wherein Cu ions were incorporated into InS2 nanoplates by a solution process to avoid selenization and ligand exchange. The content of copper added proportionately changed the bandgaps of the CuInS2 nanoplates and could be tuned from 1.45 to 1.19 eV. The template synthesis of 2D materials demonstrated here allows one to control the shape and composition and hence electrical optical properties of CIS. Its use as CE material gave an efficiency of 7.09%.
Other binary metal sulfides. 
Molybdenum or tungsten sulfides based catalysts have been largely used for hydrogen evolution and hydride sulfurization reactions by electro-catalysis. Ni or Co act as promoters and significantly enhance catalytic activity.273–275 Promoter atoms are located at edges of the MoS2 sheets in the form of so-called Ni(Co)–Mo–S structures. Kanatzidis et al.276 reported the synthesis of porous CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 but Zheng et al.277 tried it as a CE in DSSC. They showed a better electro-catalytic property with an overall efficiency of 4.96% and 5.27%, respectively. Interestingly, addition of graphite enhances the cathodic and anodic peak currents and peak separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks decreases. Efficiency increases to 7.31% and 7.14%, respectively and was comparable to that of Pt CE (7.46%). Although few have been explored, they have huge potential for further exploitation of their electro-catalytic properties. Table 5 provides the literature on other binary metal sulfides used as CE for DSSC.

4.3.4. Cu2ZnSnS4. 
The ternary metal sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is the most extensively researched and widely used material for solar cell applications. CZTS is a non-toxic, earth abundant, and low cost material. In addition, it is a direct band gap material with a high absorption coefficient of 104 cm−1 in the visible light region. Also, the value of the CZTS band gap is affected by the molar composition of CZTS, and lies in a range of 1.4–1.7 eV.278,279
Xin et al.281 for the first time reported use of CZTS as a CE material prepared by a solution method, followed by selenization which doubled the efficiency to 7.36%. Fang et al. tried to obtain surfactant-free CZTS but was only able to reach an efficiency of 3.6%, much lower than Pt CE. The pace of research is more rapid since then with many researchers working on in situ deposition or direct deposition of CZTS on substrates. Dai et al.282 tried a simple and cost-effective technique for fabricating porous surfactant-free CZTS thin film (that showed quite low reflectivity and effective light trapping) on Mo flexible foils. Liu et al.283 used a low temp in situ solvothermal method to deposit CZTS nanospheres on FTO and Wozny et al.284 used pulse laser deposition to grow a nanoplate array of CZTS. Swami et al.285 used a spray technique followed by annealing in a N2 + H2S atmosphere (to passivate defects on the surface and reduce recombination) to directly synthesize CZTS on FTO, while Tong et al.286 obtained an ultrathin transparent film of CZTS by a sol gel technique. An DC magnetic sputtering method was employed by Fan et al.280 by varying the atomic concentration for the synthesis of CZTS (Fig. 18). Most recently, in 2016, Park et al.287 found a facile solution process with spin coating for large scale deposition of highly nanoporous CZTS. All these techniques reached efficiencies between 5.5% and 7.5%.

Chen et al.288 have pioneered themselves in this field of CZTS materials being used as CE. They innovated a green method via a solvothermal technique and pre-treated with a layer of TiCl4 to obtain well adhered nanosheets and particles on the substrate; it possessed the advantages of chemical stability, easy deposition, and mechanical stability. They also experimented on rounded morphology of CZTS nanosheet networks,289 which were synthesized by a solvothermal method and fabricated by electro-deposition. The fundamental requirements, mechanical stability, and chemical stability towards the electrolyte were tested after 7 days. The efficiency and FF was retained by 98% and 97% of its initial values, respectively; a mechanical peel-off test showed that the CZTS film was still strongly bound to the substrate, and the efficiency retained 91% of its initial value. A reflective mirror was also used to improve the visible light utilization rate and efficiency was observed to increase from 6.24% to 7.12%. In 2016 they used a solvothermal method for an in situ deposition of a semi-transparent 2D leaf-like structure of CZTS on FTO.290 A detailed growth mechanism of leaf-like structures was discussed. The thin smooth edges of kesterite nanoplates curl up and become cambered to form leaf-like structures. Efficiencies up to 8.7% were reached with assistance of mirror reflection. Again in 2016, they proposed the use of a carbon cloth as flexible substrate. The good conducting framework, better catalytic activity, effective electron transport, and iodide specie diffusion gave a power conversion efficiency of 7.53%. A stable and longer duration life performance (after 7 days, a loss of ∼6% in the PCE value retaining ∼100% PCE after 300 cycle bending) were observed.291
Various morphology like nanofibers reported by Mali et al.292 by electro-spinning and nanorods, nanoflowers (Fig. 19), and spherical CZTS reported by Mokurala et al.293 clearly convey that exposed surface area, porosity, and pathway for redox specie diffusion play a key role in enhancing performance. With the two phases of CZTS, kesterite and wurtzite, performance evaluation was done by Kong et al.294 who reported that wurtzite resulted in a better efficiency of 6.85% unlike kesterite which reached an efficiency of 4.89% that was much lower than Pt CE (6.23%). The wurtzite phase of CZTS is metastable and possess a hexagonal crystal system. This structure is beneficial for catalysis and charge conductivity and shows a higher carrier concentration and lower resistivity and hence high electrical conductivity.

Bai et al.295 tried composites of CZTS with graphene and CNTs. Here also, the conducive properties of graphene, as discussed earlier, prominently contributed to enhance efficiency by over 40%. The effect of 1D conducting pathway, surface area, and porosity surpasses the charge transfer resistance offered by graphene over CNTs where CNTs exhibit a very low charge transfer resistance. However, enhancement in the CZTS-CNT composite was only 20% (Fig. 20).

Li et al.296 recently, in 2016, explained the role graphene in CZTS–graphene composites differently. In addition to graphene greatly speeding up the extraction of photoexcited electrons from the CZTS, the composite is believed to have utilized unabsorbed photons and produce electrons, effectively suppressing recombination; this was evidenced by the largest Jsc obtained. This allows enhanced capture from the solar spectrum.
In 2017 Liu et al.298 reported breakthrough research in CZTS. They reported the possible use of new CZTS derivatives as CE materials. A combined theoretical and experimental study of a strategy that exploits the substitutional incorporation of K, V, Ir, or Pt cations to enhance the catalytic performance of CZTS is discussed. K doping was reported earlier by Tong et al.299 for enhancing the (new 1 1 2) preferred orientation and reducing the second phase of ZnS in CZTS thin film. Tablero et al.300 substituted cations Ir and V to create mid-band states. Subsequently, different metal-substituted CZTS surfaces (metal = Ir, K, Pt, and V) were designed as CE materials. These studies revealed that when Cu2+ atoms in Cu2ZnSnS4 are replaced by V, the material produced shows a high catalytic activity for the reaction of I3−/I−. These results provide helpful information with regard to doping of CE materials for enhancing the performance of DSSCs.


4.3.4. Other ternary metal sulfides. 
Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) and Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) are two other ternary metal sulfides which have been used as counter electrodes for DSSC. Park et al.301 reported CFTS as CE for DSSC and compared it with other sulfides like CuS, Cu2S, SnS2, CuSnS3, Cu2SnS3 and CZTS. It was observed that out of possible Cu and Sn based sulfides, CFTS showed a better performance when compared to Pt CE (7.1%); CFTS showed a photo conversion efficiency of 5.6%. It was interesting to see that it could deliver a better performance than CZTS.
In another case, Prabhakar et al.302 synthesized CFTS using spray pyrolysis followed by sulfurization at different temperatures (400, 500 and 600 °C) for use as CE for DSSC (Fig. 21). Interestingly, CE CFTS showed a power conversion efficiency of 8.03% which was higher than that of Pt CE. Enhanced performance is due to its good catalytic activity in an iodine/iodide electrolyte as shown in Fig. 21. Also, the Mott–Schottky heterojunction of PtCo–CZGS nano-particles designed by Huang et al.303 as CE material promotes the transfer of electrons from semiconducting CZGS to metallic PtCo, which speeds up the reduction of I3− to I− in dye-sensitized solar cells. They were able to achieve efficiency up to 8.12%.

5. Oxygen reduction/evolution reaction
5.1. Binary metal sulfides in ORR and OER
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two fundamental reactions that prominently occur in advanced metal-air batteries and fuel cells (FCs). With advancements in FCs and metal-air batteries, platinum and its alloys have been widely used as ORR and OER catalysts. Since then, exploring highly efficient catalysts with low cost has been extensively studied as an alternative to platinum. However, recently there have been several reports on catalyst-based OER (FCs) or ORR (water splitting). A catalyst which can undergo both OER and ORR plays an important role in rechargeable metal air batteries and is called a bi-functional catalyst. Herein, ORR and OER correspond to the discharge and charge processes, respectively. Recently, in 2016, Lee et al.305 reviewed recent advances and progress made in using bi-functional electro-catalysts for metal-air batteries. They covered all the aspects pertaining to ORR, OER, and basic mechanisms and literature to date. Our focus in this review is to highlight the importance of binary and ternary metal sulfides for ORR, OER, and their bi-functional catalytic properties. As discussed in previous sections, out of all binary metal sulfides, NiCo2S4 has been one of the most studied and largely explored materials in various sectors such as LIB, SC, and SCs. In the next section we discuss the work done on NiCo2S4 along with few other metal sulfides for OER and ORR.

5.1.1. NiCo2S4. 
NiCo2S4 synthesised for the first time for ORR/OER applications via a solvothermal method using EGylated DES composed of PEG 200 and thiourea,306 when used as an electro-catalyst possesses a good OER with an onset potential of 1.45 V and lower Tafel slope (64 mV dec−1). The improved OER performance of NiCo2S4 originated from its short diffusion route and fast transportation for active species and, interestingly, NiCo2S4 demonstrated long-term stability for almost thirty hours. Following a similar approach, Wu et al. synthesised NiCo2S4 on 3D graphene foam. Further sulfurization yielded a unique architecture with high surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. A prominent peak at −0.29 V was observed in an O2-saturated electrolyte solution which suggests the composite exhibits catalytic activity towards ORR. It was found that the composite favours a four-electron oxygen reduction pathway in the potential range of −0.45–0.65 V.307 On the other hand, the NiCo2S4/nitrogen and sulphur-functionalized multiple graphene aerogel (NiCo2S4/N,S-MGA) was constructed by Tingting et al.308 and used as electrode material for a supercapacitor and ORR. A high cathodic peak at −0.407 V was observed indicating excellent activity towards ORR due to the presence of N and S atoms in the architecture, which promoted the adsorption of O2 over the catalyst. Wu et al.309 developed a one pot hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of NiCo2S4 on reduced graphene oxide where Na2S was used as a sulfur source as well as a reducing agent.
Wu et al.310 synthesised NiCo2S4 on carbon support; it showed an onset potential of −0.02 V and a Tafel slope of 76.2 mV dec−1 which was close to that of the Pt/C catalyst. In another report, the same group utilised 3D nitrogen-doped carbon foam as a substrate for the synthesis of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays. Both electrodes showed a comparable catalytic activity with a four electron pathway over Pt/C.311 Zhang et al.312 synthesised NiCo2S4 microspheres via a facile one pot method and used it as a bifunctional catalyst for OER and ORR. NiCo2S4 microspheres exhibited an onset potential of −0.05 V with a peak potential at −0.22 V. It was observed that electrons transferred per O2 molecule were found to be 3.98 which was close to the theoretical value of 4. The authors suggested that the electrocatalytic property of NiCo2S4 originated from the unique d-electronic configuration of Co(III) at the surface. In another case, NiCo2S4 nanoparticles were grown on graphene via a solvothermal method with ethylene glycol as solvent and used as a bifunctional catalyst.313
Liu et al.314 investigated the theoretical and experimental importance of NiCo2S4@NiFe LDH/NF hetero-structures as a bi-functional catalyst for OER and HER. The OER catalyst showed an over potential of 201 mV at a current density of 60 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec−1. In continuation, Liu et al.315 synthesised NiCo2S4 on carbon cloth and utilised it as a bi-functional catalyst for OER and HER which delivered an overpotential of 305 mV for hydrogen evolution and 340 mV for oxygen evolution. An alkaline water electrolyzer made from NiCo2S4/CC needs a voltage of 1.68 V for a 10 mA cm−2 water splitting current. These studies suggest a new platform to explore the use of binary metal sulfides as potential electrode material for full water splitting. Sivanantham et al.316 synthesised NiCo2S4 nanowire on Ni foam to yield a unique architecture and to act as a bifunctional catalyst for ORR and HER with an overpotential of 260 mV and 210 mV, respectively. Further, Wang et al.317 and Han et al.318 demonstrated the use of NiCo2S4 microspheres and NiCo2S4 with nitrogen-doped CNT as an effective bi-functional catalyst for metal/air batteries and zinc air batteries, respectively.


5.1.2. ZnIn2S4. 
Liu et al.319 synthesised a hetero-junction of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets/1D TiO2 nanorods via a hydrothermal method for water splitting applications. When used as a photo-electrode it showed an onset potential of −0.53 V with a photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 which was higher than the TiO2 nanorod (0.05 V and 0.4 mA cm−2). The negative shift in onset potential and increase in the photocurrent is due to a large accumulation of electrons and the electron–hole pairs being separated at the interface which decreases charge recombination. In another attempt, the same group developed a multi-junction with ZnIn2S4 nanosheet/TiO2 film/Si nanowire configuration with an onset potential of −0.33 V.320 Further, Liu et al.321 developed a novel TiO2/CdS/ZnIn2S4 nanorod-nanosheet array (NRSs) as a photo-catalyst which delivered a photocurrent density of 9.33 mA cm−2 at 0.53 V. This unique architecture possessed a large photo response spectrum to visible light with good band alignment; also a CdS buffer layer lowered recombination probability which contributed to the high photocurrent density.

5.2. Other binary metal sulfides
A few other binary metal sulfides including Co0.5Fe0.5S,322 Zn–Co–S,323 CoMoS4,324 FeNiS4,325,326 and CuCo2S4327 have been explored as prominent bi-catalysts for OER and ORR applications.
6. Hydrogen generation reaction
6.1. Binary metal sulfides for hydrogen evolution reactions
Hydrogen is a known environmental friendly fuel that carries the largest energy density. Potentials of hydrogen as an energy carrier can be utilized via a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A HER is the production of hydrogen through the process of water electrolysis where the evolution of hydrogen is possibly limited and is based on desorption of molecules coming from the cathode surface and this requires efficient HER catalysts.

6.1.1. ZnIn2S4. 
For the first time, Lei et al.328 investigated the importance of ZnIn2S4 as a potential photo-catalyst material for H2 evolution reactions. As an electrode material, ZnIn2S4 showed an activity of 57 μmol g−1 h−1 and was enhanced to 800 μmol g−1 h−1 using Pt as a co-catalyst in the first cycle. A templated-free approach was followed by Chai et al.329 for the synthesis of fluorinated ZnIn2S4 microspheres via a hydrothermal method. Tian et al.330 studied temperature dependence during the hydrothermal method used for the synthesis of ZnIn2S4. As the temperature was gradually increased, there was an increase in total pore volume, average pore diameter, and surface area which affected the catalytic behaviour. It was observed that ZnIn2S4 obtained at 160 °C showed a better H2 production of 248.9 mmol g−1 h−1. Li et al.331 deposited ZnIn2S4 thin film on indium tin oxide (ITO) using a spray pyrolysis technique. UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnIn2S4 thin film showed an optical band gap of 2.1 eV which is close enough for photo-electrochemical splitting of water (2.0 eV).332 ZnIn2S4 microspheres were synthesized by a template-free hydrothermal method which showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 842 μmol h−1 at pH 1.333 Song et al. studied the effect of concentrations of In on morphology and photocatalytic performance. Of all the different compositions, ZnIn2.3S4−y delivered a highest photocatalytic activity of 363 μmol g−1 h−1 which can be attributed to its large specific area and the crystallite size.334 Chen et al.335 synthesized ZnIn2S4 with hexagonal-cubic phase via a bio-inspired approach using hydrilla as a template with H2 evolution of 14.9 μmol h−1. Shen et al.336 used various solvents such as water, methanol, and ethylene glycol which resulted in different morphologies such as a flowering cherry-like microsphere and micro-clusters, respectively; the aqueous-assisted synthesis method showed a maximum activity of 27.3 μmol h−1 mainly due to a unique morphology and better crystallinity.
Chaudhari et al.337 demonstrated a conversion of harmful H2S gas into useful H2 under solar light using ZnIn2S4 as a catalyst. Morphology of ZnIn2S4 was controlled by the presence of trimethylamine to obtain nanoplates/nanostrips. Optical studies showed a band gap of 2.34–2.48 eV with hydrogen evolution of 5287 μmol h−1. In another report by Bai et al.,338 ZnIn2S4 microspheres with surface area of 165.4 m2 g−1 was synthesized by a cetylpyridinium bromide (CPBr) assisted hydrothermal method. It was observed that CPBr concentration and pH greatly affected the electro-catalytic activity. ZnIn2S4 obtained at pH 2 showed a higher activity of 1544.8 μmol h−1 g−1, attributed to its flower-like microsphere morphology with good pore structure which was helpful for e−–h+ transfer. Recently, a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted hydrothermal method was carried out by Shen et al. for synthesis of ZnIn2S4 which showed a hydrogen production of 112.45 mmol h−1 and 122.5 mmol h−1.339,340 Lately, Shang et al.341 used a polyol-mediated hot injection method for synthesis of ZnIn2S4 sub-microspheres. Using 1 wt% Pt loading as a co-catalyst, ZnIn2S4 showed a H2 evolution of 612 mmol h−1 g−1 which was higher than bare ZnIn2S4 (151.8 μmol h−1 g−1). Presence of platinum enhances electroactive sites and favours high H2 evolution rate. A heterojunction of cubic quantum dot/hexagonal microsphere ZnIn2S4 showed a catalytic activity of 114.2 μmol h−1.342
Effect of doping. 
Shen et al.343 prepared ZnIn2S4via a hydrothermal method and used it for photo-catalytic performance by doping with various compositions of copper (Cu) (0 wt% to 2 wt%). It was observed that 0.5 wt% of doped Cu showed the highest photo-catalytic activity with hydrogen evolution of 151.5 μmol h−1 under visible light. Hui et al.344 doped Co which displayed a high production of 200.5 mol h−1. Doping of Co replaces Zn2+ by Co2+ and results in the increase of d(006) space, which promotes photo-generated charge separation and showed enhanced photocatalytic activity. Jing et al.345 and Wu et al.346 doped different concentrations of Ni and Cr in ZnIn2S4 and studied their catalytic performance. Cr3+-doped ZnIn2S4 showed a good H2 evolution performance of 3115.2 μmol h−1 g−1. In another case, Tian et al.347 and Zhu et al.348 investigated the effect of doping La and rGO/La in ZnIn2S4 respectively. Doping has always been one of the most effective techniques to tune the performance of an electrode material. Tian et al.349 investigated the doping effect of rare earth (RE) ions such as La3+, Ce3+, Gd3+, Er3+, and Y3+ on the photocatalytic activity of ZnIn2S4. It was observed that with 2.0 wt% of Y, Gd, Er, Ce, and La doping showed increased hydrogen production efficiency by 46%, 53%, 61%, 69%, and 106%, respectively. In a similar report by Shen et al.350,351 alkaline-earth metals and transition metals such as Ca, Sr, Ba, and Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co were doped in ZnIn2S4via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process. Ca-doped ZnIn2S4 showed a greater catalytic performance than pristine ZnIn2S4 due to suppressed charge recombination via band-to-band transition in Ca-doped ZnIn2S4.
Effect of graphene/carbon composite. 
Zhou et al.352 synthesized ZnIn2S4/rGO nanosheets via a controlled solvothermal method. It was observed that the surface area of n ZnIn2S4/rGO doubled to 92 m2 g−1 due to the presence of rGO. The amount of catalyst was a key factor for the catalytic performance; 0.050 g of ZnIn2S4/rGO showed a max rate of 81.6 mmol h−1 which decreased to 40.3 mmol h−1 for 0.1 g of catalyst. A microwave-assisted method was followed for the synthesis of flower-like rGO/ZnIn2S4 microspheres with good photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of 132.3 μmol h−1.353 Similarly, 3D ZnIn2S4/rGO heterostructures were synthesized via a hydrothermal method with hydrogen production of 6365 μmol h−1 with 0.2 g of catalyst.354 Presence of rGO helps in hole–electron separation and better conductivity, which leads to lower charge combination in the system. Similar results have been reported in Ye et al.355 and Chen et al.356 In another attempt, ZnIn2S4 was grown on carbon nanofibers to form a core–shell via a two-step method which showed a hydrogen evolution of 95 μmol h−1.357 Chai et al.358 prepared MWCNT/ZnIn2S4via a hydrothermal approach and investigated the photocatalytic behaviour for hydrogen production. With 3 wt% of MWCNT, it showed a better activity of 684 mmol h−1. The presence of MWCNT enhances the charge transfer and the resulting enhanced charge separation efficiency. Recently, in 2017, Xia et al.359 compared the effect of carbon quantum dots (1D), carbon nanotubes (2D), and reduced graphene oxide (3D) as a composite material with ZnIn2S4 for the photocatalytic H2 production reaction. Out of all composite materials, rGO/ZnIn2S4 showed a higher H2 production rate of 2640.8 mmol g−1 h−1 which is the highest reported so far. Higher photocatalytic activity of rGO/ZnIn2S4 was attributed to a large surface area which provides higher nucleation sites and larger space for charge-carrier transfer.
Effect of composite material. 
Shen et al.360 demonstrated a series of Pt-loaded metal sulfides/ZnIn2S4 as a photo-catalyst for the H2 evolution reaction. Wherein, various metal sulfides such as Ag2S, SnS, CoS, CuS, NiS, and MnS have been explored of which CuS/ZnIn2S4 showed a higher H2 evolution performance of 201.7 μmol h−1. Similarly, Lim et al.361 investigated the role of MoS2, CuS, and Ag2S as co-catalysts with ZnIn2S4 of which Mo2S/ZnIn2S4 showed a better catalytic activity. Ding et al.362 explored the use of MoS2 as a co-catalyst along with rGO which showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.62 mmol h−1 g−1. With similar architecture, Yuan et al.363 reported the generation of 4169 μmol h−1 g−1 hydrogen. Later, many reports used MoS2 as co-catalyst; namely, Chen et al.364 and Wei et al.365 reported H2 evolution rates of 8.047 mmol h−1 g−1 and 130 μmol h−1 which were 28 times and 9 times higher than bare ZnIn2S4, respectively. These reports strongly suggest that Mo2S is a potential co-catalyst for H2 evolution reactions.
In a two-step method, Wei et al.366 synthesized ZnIn2S4/NiS and used it as a photocatalyst. Studies showed that NiS plays a critical role of co-catalyst, which helps in directional migration of photo-excited electrons, and also acts as active sites for H2 evolution. Junctions between ZnIn2S4 and NiS played a role in high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution at a rate of 104.7 μmol h−1 which was higher than Pt/ZnIn2S4 (77.8 μmol h−1). ZnS-coated ZnIn2S4 synthesised by Li et al.367 showed photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the presence of glucose. Mei et al.368 synthesized In2S3/ZnIn2S4via an ion exchange reaction. It was observed that the photocatalytic performance was higher in composites, compared to their pristine forms. In another report, Ni(OH)2 was used as a co-catalyst with ZnIn2S4 microspheres which showed a H2 evolution of 8.35 mmol g−1 h−1; this was 18 times higher than bare ZnIn2S4. Use of Ni(OH)2 enhanced interfacial charge transfer suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs.369 The unique architecture of 3D CdS quantum dot/graphene/ZnIn2S4 obtained by Hou et al.370 enhanced light absorption ability and improved the separation of photo-generated carriers. In another approach, a CdS quantum dot-sensitized ZnFe2O4/ZnIn2S4 nanosheet hetero-junction showed hydrogen production rate of 79.0 μmol h−1.371 Liu et al.372 and Ding et al.373 synthesised ZnIn2S4–g-C3N4via a hydrothermal approach and microwave assisted methods, respectively. This unique hetero junction showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 953.5 mmol h−1 g−1 with 40 wt% of g-C3N4 and 387 μmol h−1 with 20 wt% of g-C3N4 in the composite respectively.


6.1.2. CdIn2S4. 
Bhirud et al.374 prepared CdIn2S4 and analysed effects of surfactant on its morphology and photocatalytic activity. Among a series of catalysts, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) assisted CdIn2S4 with bipyramid morphology showed an excellent photocatalytic activity of 3238 mmol h−1. CdIn2S4 with graphene composite successfully fabricated by Mahadadalkar et al.64 demonstrated H2 production with enhanced photocatalytic activity of 4495 μmol h−1. Further, as discussed in the previous section, ZnIn2S4 has been considered as a potential electrode material for H2 evolution reactions. Taking this into account, Yu et al.375 and Chen et al.376 synthesised PdS-loaded CdIn2S4/ZnIn2S4 and CuS/CdIn2S4/ZnIn2S4 composite material which showed a H2 evolution of 780 μmol h−1 and 358.4 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Recently, a hetero junction of CdS nanowire on CdIn2S4 nanosheets was successfully synthesised by Wang et al.377 and used as a photoelectrode which showed a photocurrent density of 2.85 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In another attempt, CdIn2S4/g-C3N4 was fabricated by Chen et al.378 where g-C3N4 was wrapped onto CdIn2S4 nanosheets in which CdIn2S4 not only helped with faster charge separation but also significantly improved the photo-stability of CdIn2S4.


6.1.3. CaIn2S4. 
Ding et al.379 explored the photocatalytic activity of CaIn2S4. Optical studies revealed that CaIn2S4 possessed an optical band gap in the range from 1.68 to 1.74 eV with a max hydrogen evolution rate of 30.92 μmol h−1 g−1. The authors suggested that CaIn2S4 composed of In3+ ions in a d10 configuration may be the reason for achieving high photocatalytic activity. The same group also utilised bimetallic Au–Pt alloy as a co-catalyst with CaIn2S4, which showed an enhanced activity of 107.6 μmol h−1 g−1; this was higher than CaIn2S4, Au–CaIn2S4, and Pt–CaIn2S4.380 In another attempt to enhance the catalytic property, Xia et al.381 and Jiang et al.382 utilised CNT and as a composite material with CaIn2S4 and g-C3N4, respectively. Using CNT as a composite material enhanced crystallinity and specific surface area of CaIn2S4 which resulted in an H2 evolution rate of 23.4 μmol h−1 g−1. Whereas, using g-C3N4 a high H2 evolution rate of 102 μmol g−1 h−1 was attainable.


6.1.4. Other binary metal sulfides. 
There are fewer reports on binary metal sulfides used for HER, but limited studies showed greater potential to replace the expensive platinum electrode. Ma et al.383 synthesized NiCo2S4 on Ni foam with thioacetamide as sulphur source via a hydrothermal method and used it for the hydrogen evolution reaction. As an electrode material for the hydrogen evolution reaction, it showed a very low onset potential of 17 mV with a Tafel slope of 84.5 mV dec−1. In another case, Gu et al.384 used carbon nanofiber/CNT as a template for the synthesis of NiCo2S4. Further, a composite material was doped via a phosphidation reaction and their catalytic properties were studied. Phosphorous-doped NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF showed an ultra-low onset potential of 27 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Wang et al.385 synthesised CoNi2S4via a one pot hydrothermal method and studied the effect of temperature on photocatalytic activity. It was observed that the crystallite size increased from 9.3 nm to 14.3 nm from temperatures of 160 °C to 240 °C. A catalyst obtained at 220 °C showed overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In a rare case, another important binary metal sulfide, CuCo2S4, was explored as a potential electrode material for the hydrogen evolution reaction by Ge et al.386 in 2016. The authors followed a one-step method to prepare CuCo2S4 and CoNi2S4 to get nanorods with a cluster-like morphology. As electrode material, CuCo2S4 and CoNi2S4 showed an overpotential of 111 mV and 135 mV with a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec−1 and 63 mV dec−1, respectively.

7. Synthesis methods
Synthesis methods play an important role in controlling structures and properties of desired materials. In all previous sections, morphologies of different electroactive materials were discussed contextually. In this section, we briefly discuss various synthesis methods which have been employed for the synthesis of binary metal sulfides such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, electro-deposition, electro-spinning, etc. (Fig. 22).
 Fig. 22  Synthesis methods. 
Hydrothermal methods are simple and widely used techniques for the synthesis of nanomaterials. Here, water acts as solvent which is heated in a closed vessel called an autoclave which can maintain the desired temperature and pressure. With water being abundant in nature, it possesses remarkable properties and acts as a catalyst for the formation of the desired product under hydrothermal conditions. Another important advantage of using water as a solvent is that it is volatile so it can be easily separated from the product.
Hydrothermal methods have been widely used for the synthesis of various metal sulfides. Various research reports show different morphologies of the same material and also study their effects on performance. It has been observed that key parameters that result in unique morphologies include reaction temperature and the surfactant used. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and hexamethylenetetramine (HTMA) are two examples of commonly used surfactants. For the synthesis of binary sulfides there are two main steps: first, is the formation of binary metal hydroxide/oxides; second, this is followed by sulfuration. Sulfuration is done to convert oxides to sulfides in the presence of sulfur sources such as sodium sulfide, thiourea, etc. In some cases, metal sulfides can be obtained in a one-step hydrothermal approach.
Many successful attempts have been made to synthesize binary metal sulfides directly on a conductive substrate such as nickel foam, carbon cloth, carbon fiber, etc. These act as a conductive matrix which enhances conductivity of the active material.
A solvothermal synthesis method is quite similar to a hydrothermal one, wherein the reaction medium is replaced by solvents such as ethanol, methanol, etc. Unique morphologies such as nanorods, micro flowers, and plate-like morphologies can be obtained by using different solvents and mixture of solvents. Similar to hydrothermal, in a solvothermal method the reaction mixture is heated in a closed vessel and heated to a temperature higher than the boiling points of the solvents. It has been observed that temperature and the surfactant plays a prominent role in the morphology of the materials produced.
Another widely used technique for the synthesis of metal oxides/sulfides is an electrodeposition method, where the active material can be directly grown on the desired substrate. An advantage of this approach is that it provides firm contact between the substrates and the active material. Nickel foam and carbon cloth are widely used as a conductive substrate for the growth of nanomaterials. Another advantage of using this technique is that the material deposited on the substrate can be directly used as an electrode material in various applications such as a lithium ion battery and a supercapacitor (which avoids the use of conductive additives).
Various other synthesis approaches such as precipitation, sol–gel, electrospinning, and solution based methods also have been explored for the synthesis of metal sulfides which are similar to synthesis of metal oxides.16
8. Summary/conclusion and future perspectives
Metal sulphides have been a Frontier material and are the focal point of investigations for energy applications. Binary metal sulfides (BMS) have been widely explored in various sectors such as lithium ion batteries, super-capacitors, hydrogen generation/evolutions, oxygen reduction reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, and solar cells etc.; even more so in the last five years. BMS as an electrode material for LIBs possesses high theoretical capacity, better conductivity, and rich redox ability that delivers a significant specific capacity. BMS in the form AB2S4 (where A, B = metal and A ≠ B) possesses better conductivity and redox ability and has huge potential as battery material. With a motivation from metal sulfides (MoS2, CuS, SnS, FeS2, etc.) being used as an electrode material for a Na-ion and Mg-ion battery (MoS2), attempts have been made to utilise binary metal sulfides for Na-ion battery applications. But, unfortunately, during the lithiation process intermediate polysulfide Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) forms, which easily reacts/dissolves in electrolyte and results in a decrease in reversible capacity. Aspects such as understanding the chemistry and reaction mechanisms of these materials in Li, Na, and Mg ion batteries are yet to be worked on and such information can enhance better utilization of BMS. Also, dynamics of the formation of intermediate polysulfides need to be studied. Compatible electrolytes with minimized shuttle effects can fairly enhance the performance of LIBs and also need to be studied.
Discussions on improvements in performance by tweaking the crystal structure and surface character have revealed a promising line of action for using BMS for energy applications. Some typical examples of enhanced performance were elaborately discussed. Increasing conductivity by incorporating various conductive carbons and conductive polymers such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon nano tubes (CNTs), graphene ribbons. Also, polyaniline, polypyrrole, and PEDOT poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), respectively, have shown high promise for designing a very high performance electrode. Unique results have been discussed with support from characterization, thus providing new information on electron pathways. One can observe very few reports on study of the factors controlling ion dynamics of metal ions in new electrode systems. Understanding the interfacial and degradation mechanisms of these metal-ion batteries by in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption, impedance spectroscopy and microscopy techniques can open up new avenues for taking this research to an entirely new level. Optimisation and demonstration of full cell prototype metal-ion batteries using BMS and TMS materials was rarely found. Thus, it will be important to initiate large scale synthesis and construct operating systems so as to identify and work on their shortcomings.
Also, BMS and TMS are promising alternatives to expensive precious metal Pt as CE materials in DSSC applications. These CE materials are observed to be very promising and surpass carbon materials in many aspects to appropriately replace Pt CE. We note NCS and CZTS to be extensively researched and used as counter electrode materials. Various researchers have applied different synthetic strategies to obtain various morphologies so as to tune their electrochemical activity and performance. Porosity, crystallinity, stoichiometry, shape, size, and exposed surface area strongly influence the number of catalytic sites and regeneration of the electrolyte. Synthesis methods that avoid ligands and use of nontoxic components are preferred as a step towards green chemistry approaches. In situ depositions and fabrications that involve controlled thickness, low process temperatures, good deposition rates that result in short diffusion lengths, good electron transport, and suppression of charge recombination contribute to overall performance and are important parameters to be considered with respect to large scale applications. Substrates such as carbon cloth are very exciting material and can take the research of these CE materials far into the future. Use of graphene and CNTs as high surface conducting frameworks with BMS and assistance of reflective mirrors allows an enhanced utilization of photogenerated electrons. Doping CZTS with various cations for creation of mid band states and high catalytic activity has opened up a new era for obtaining various doped BMS and TMS as enriched CE materials for DSSCs.
Finally, the review allows promising solutions presented here to be broadly applied to other energy applications, majorly oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen generation, Li–air batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries.
