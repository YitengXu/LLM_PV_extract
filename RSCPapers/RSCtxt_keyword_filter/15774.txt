The power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases with elongation of the conjugated spacer, and the dye with the dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole spacer has the best efficiency of 8.14%, which is comparable with that of an N719-based DSSC (8.03%). After coadsorbed with 1 mM CDCA, the efficiency was improved to 8.4%. The J-aggregation of the dye results in light harvesting at a longer wavelength spectral region and increasing the photocurrent of the cell.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great attention due to their convenient fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for possible indoor and commercial applications.1 Among four major components of DSSCs, photoelectrodes, dyes, electrolytes and counter electrodes, the dyes definitely play an important role as they are in charge of light harvesting. The highest cell efficiencies (AM 1.5) of single dye-based DSSCs have achieved 13.0%,2 11.5%3 and 12.5%,4 for zinc–porphyrin dyes, polypyridyl ruthenium dyes and metal-free dyes, respectively. Impressively high cell efficiencies (>12%) without the use of a co-sensitizer or co-adsorbent have rendered metal-free dyes very competitive with the other two types of dyes.4,5 Moreover, their lower cost, easier purification, and higher flexibility in structural design are also very attractive for future commercialization.
Metal-free sensitizers have an archetype skeleton of donor–(π conjugated spacer)–acceptor (D–π–A). A red shift of the absorption spectra can be achieved via insertion of an internal acceptor (A′) to form D–π–A′–π–A type sensitizers.5 The use of a fused aromatic segment in the π-conjugated spacer is beneficial to red-shifting and intensifying the absorption spectra of the dyes.6,7 Recently sensitizers containing a rigid segment comprised of fused electron deficient and electron rich aromatics, dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (BTBF),8 dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (DTQ)9 and dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (BTTP),10 as the conjugated spacer, were reported by us and Cao, respectively. These sensitizers absorb broadly and intensely as the planarized π-spacer is helpful in the delocalization of π-electrons and electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.11,12 Reduction of reorganization energy during photo-induced charge transfer is also anticipated with the rigidified π-spacer.13,14 Accordingly, these sensitizers have very promising cell performance, which rivals that of an N719 based standard DSSC.
In continuation of our studies on rigid spacers with fused electron rich and deficient segments for better DSSC performance, we extended our studies to dyes with an elongated electron rich segment and a moderate electron deficient segment. Therefore, we set out to synthesize the sensitizer with dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole (BZTP) entity, BZTP-1. Two congeners with rigid spacers of smaller dimensions, BZ-1 and YC-1, were also synthesized for comparison (Fig. 1). In contrast to BTTP, BZTP allows the incorporation of a hydrocarbon chain at the triazole moiety, which may help with dye solubility and alleviation of dye aggregation and dark current.
 Fig. 1  The structure of the dyes. 
In order to have a better understanding of the rigid spacer on the physical properties and the cell performance of the dyes, TD-DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory using Q-Chem 4.0 software were carried out on BZ-1, YC-1 and BZTP-1. Calculations on dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole-based dye (DTPBT)10 and two analogues (BT-1 and BTBT-1) were also carried out for comparison (vide infra). We first carried out the computations on the rigid spacers of the six dyes. According to the computation results (Fig. S1, ESI†), we found that: (1) extension of the more electron rich segment of the rigid spacer results in less negative values of the HOMO (BZ-1 < YC-1 < BZTP-1 and BT-1 < BTBT-1 < DTP-4); (2) changing the electron deficient segment of the rigid spacer from benzotriazole to benzothiazole results in more negative values of the HOMO (BZ-1 > BT-1; YC-1 > BTBT-1; BZTP-1 > DTP-4). This trend is actually in parallel with the trend of the dyes (vide infra).
The synthetic routes of the new dyes are described in Schemes S1–S3 (ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes in THF at a concentration of 10 μM, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Two major bands are observed for these compounds. The band below 400 nm is attributed to the aromatic π–π* transition, whereas the band of a longer wavelength is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from the donor to the acceptor. Since the dihedral angles between the triphenylamine (TPA) donor and the core are similar (17.2–24.1°, Fig. S2, ESI†), the bathochromic shift of the ICT band for BZTP-1 dye (∼46 nm vs.YC-1 dye) is mainly due to its longer and planar mainframe. There is a prominent increment of the molar extinction coefficient (ε) at the ICT band as the BZ (benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole) entity in BZ-1 (ε = 17.6 kM−1 cm−1) is fused with the thiophene ring (YC-1 dye, ε = 29.5 kM−1 cm−1) and thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole (BZTP-1 dye, ε = 55.6 kM−1 cm−1). The longer wavelength and the more intense absorption of the BZTP-1 dye should be beneficial to the photocurrent of DSSCs.

There is a broadened and red-shifted ICT band (Fig. 2b) for the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 film compared with the dyes in the solution, indicating that there exists J-aggregation of the dyes. This is further supported by the blue shift of the ICT band: 13, 12 and 41 nm for BZ-1, YC-1 and BZTP-1, respectively, after adding 10 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent. Obviously, the dye with a larger flat skeleton has a higher tendency of dye aggregation. Though dye aggregation may result in quenching of the excited state and hamper electron injection, there were some examples of J-aggregation enhanced cell performance due to the enhanced light-harvesting at longer wavelengths.9,15 The contribution of the longer wavelength absorption to the photocurrent in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots witnesses that the J-aggregation of the dyes is beneficial to the cell performance (vide infra).
The electrochemical properties of the organic dyes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF solutions at a concentration of 1 mM with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The first quasi-reversible one-electron redox wave can be attributed to the oxidation of arylamine (BZ-1 and YC-1) or arylamine/BZTP (BZTP-1). The BZTP-1 dye has a significant cathodic shift of the oxidation potential compared with the other dyes, which reflects the more electron rich nature of the BZTP entity (vide supra) and is consistent with its longer wavelength ICT band.
Computational results for the dyes and the benzothiadiazole congeners (Fig. S4, ESI†) are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The ground-state dihedral angles (Fig. S2, ESI†) between the core and the TPA donor or the acceptor (2-cyanoacrylic acid, Ac) range from 0.3 to 24.1°, which allows efficient charge transfer from the TPA to the acceptor. Frontier orbitals of the dyes are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The HOMO in these compounds is mainly distributed from the TPA to the core, while the LUMO is largely distributed from Ac to the core. The lowest transition (S0 → S1) is ∼100% of HOMO → LUMO transition for all the compounds, confirming its charge-transfer character. It is interesting to note that the strong overlap between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals leads to high oscillator strength (f) of the S0 → S1 transition in BZTP-1 and DTP-4. The differences in the Mulliken charges between the S0 and S1 (or S2) states (Fig. 3) deserve attention: (1) the charge in the fused segment is less negative in the BZ-containing dyes (BZ-1, YC-1 and BZTP-1) compared with their BT-containing congeners (BT-1, BTBT-1 and DTP-4), i.e. less charge trapping in the photoexcited state of the former; (2) the charge in the fused segment becomes less negative as the dimension of the fused segment becomes larger (BZ-1 < YC-1 < BZTP-1 and BT-1 < BTBT-1 < DTP-4); (3) the ratio of the negative charge at the fused segment to that at the acceptor becomes smaller as the dimension of the fused segment becomes larger. Therefore, electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor (anchor) is expected to be more effective for BZTP-1 compared with DTP-4 and BZ-1. It is also anticipated to be more effective for BZTP-1 compared with DTP-4.

The DSSCs were fabricated using these organic dyes as the sensitizers and the mesoporous anatase TiO2 film as the photoanode. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) plots of the cells under illumination and in the dark are shown in Fig. 4a, and their incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) are shown in Fig. 4b. The device performance parameters under 100 mW cm−2 of illumination are collected in Table 1. The dye-loading amounts (BZ-1, 0.422; YC-1, 0.362; BZTP-1, 0.384 μmol cm−2) on the TiO2 photoanode were found not to be the dominating factor for the photocurrent (Jsc). The photovoltage (Voc), photocurrent and cell efficiency (η) increase in the order of BZ-1 (5.7%) < YC-1 (6.8%) < BZTP-1 (8.14%), which are in parallel with the increasing size of the fused segment. The significantly improved cell efficiency of BZTP-1 can be rationalized by the following reasons: (1) the improved Jsc value due to the red-shifting and hyperchromic shift of the absorption spectra. Moreover, light harvesting above 650 nm due to J-aggregation of the dyes also contributes to the photocurrent in the IPCE spectrum; (2) the longer electron lifetime (τ) at the interface between the dye-adsorbed TiO2 film and the electrolyte under illumination (τ: BZ-1, 6.19 ms; YC-1, 7.50 ms; BZTP-1, 11.08 ms, Fig. S6, ESI†); (3) better dark current suppression (Fig. 4a). The better dark current suppression (Fig. 4a and Fig. S7a, ESI†) for BZTP-1 is consistent with its higher Voc value.
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves and (b) IPCE of DSSCs based on the dyes with and without CDCA as the coadsorbent. 
More effective suppression of the dark current by the BZTP-1 cell is also supported by the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in the dark (Fig. S7b, ESI†). From the Nyquist plots, the reduced electron recombination resistance (Rrec) increases in the order of BZ-1 < YC-1 < BZTP-1, indicating that the electron recombination rate decreases in the order of BZ-1 > YC-1 > BZTP-1. The order of decreasing Voc, BZTP-1 > YC-1 > BZ-1, is in conformity with the order of the electron recombination rate.
The electron lifetime (τIMVS) is also measured under the open-circuit conditions by the intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS, Fig. S8, ESI†).16 At the same light intensity, the order of the electron lifetime, BZTP-1 > YC-1 > BZ-1, is in line with the Voc value and the dark current (vide supra). As the Voc value depends on the conduction band edge (Ec) of the TiO2 electrode and the electron recombination process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, the charge extraction method (CEM) was used to measure the electron density (dn, Fig. S9, ESI†) for estimating Ec of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode.16–18 The charge density decreases in the order of BZTP-1 > YC-1 > BZ-1, suggesting that the upward shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 increases in the order of BZTP-1 < YC-1 < BZ-1. Obviously the dark current suppression very effectively counteracts the unfavorable upward shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 and leads to a larger Voc for the dyes with a larger fused segment; the Voc value increases in the order of BZ-1 < YC-1 < BZTP-1. The cell of BZTP-1 has a slightly higher Voc value than that of DTP-4.10,19 Possibly the additional 2-ethylhexyl chain in the conjugated spacer of BZTP-1 helps with blocking the triiodide ion of the electrolyte from approaching the TiO2 surface and leading to less charge recombination.
DSSCs with CDCA as the coadsorbent were fabricated for comparison. Though CDCA may alleviate the dye aggregation and suppress the dark current, it will also decrease the dye loading. Therefore, DSSCs at different CDCA concentrations were tested (Fig. S10, ESI†). The best cell efficiencies were found at 5 mM for BZ-1 and YC-1, and 1 mM for BZTP-1, respectively. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 4 and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The efficiency of BZ-1 improved slightly to 6.2%. The efficiency of BZTP-1 (8.4%) slightly exceeds that of the N719-based standard cell (8.03%), while that of YC-1 (7.5%) reaches 94% of the standard cell. The increased Voc (∼20 mV) for BZ-1 can be attributed to the improved dark current suppression, which is supported by the significant increment of the electrochemical impedance (120.04 Ω vs. 153.91 Ω) of the cell in the dark after addition of CDCA (Fig. S11, ESI†). A slight improvement of the Jsc values for all dyes may be due to the removal of dye aggregates harmful to electron injection, such as dyes not anchored on the TiO2 photoanode.
A fused segment of large size (such as BZTP) seems to favour dye aggregation. More compact packing of the dyes due to J-aggregation together with the incorporation of 2-ethylhexyl chain may be the cause for efficient dark current suppression of BZTP-1. Extension of light harvesting to the longer wavelength spectral region via J-aggregation for increasing photocurrent is worth noting and may be a useful approach for future design of sensitizers. Though J-aggregation was also reported to increase the photo-current of DTP-4 at a longer wavelength spectral region, addition of CDCA was found to show a red shift of the spectra and an improved cell performance.
In conclusion, we have synthesized a sensitizer, BZTP-1, with the dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole entity comprising fused electron rich and electron deficient entities as the conjugated spacer. There exists J-aggregation of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. The J-aggregation of the dye extends the ICT band to the longer wavelength spectral region and leads to larger photocurrents of the DSSCs. The best cell efficiency reached 8.14%, which is comparable to the N719-based standard DSSC (8.03%). Upon addition of 1 mM CDCA as the coadsorbent, the efficiency increases to 8.40%.
