    , Accepted 17th September 2014First published on 18th September 2014AbstractA polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) that shows high durability at elevated temperature and under non-humidified conditions is strongly demanded for the next generation PEFCs. Here we show the importance of using pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as catalyst supports for fuel cell (FC) durability. For that purpose, two different membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using pristine CNTs and commercial carbon black (CB) as carbon supports were coated by polybenzimidazole on which platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were deposited. Notably, the CNT-based MEA exhibited ∼4 times higher durability compared to the CB-based MEA. The ex situ monitoring of the fabricated electrocatalysts before and after the durability testing based on transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements revealed higher structural stability of the CNTs compared to the CB in their MEAs. The pristine structure of the CNTs has been revealed to be very important for the high PEFC durability. This is the first report that shows the durability of the pristine CNT-based PEFC at high operating temperature and under non-humidified conditions, which are the targets of the next generation PEFCs with very high performance.
Introduction
The development of novel carbon materials with a perfectly crystalline structure is a challenging issue.1 Several kinds of nanocarbon materials were introduced for different energy applications, including solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells.2–5 Fuel cells, in particular PEFCs, are considered as among the most promising alternative energy sources due to their high energy conversion efficiency, high power density and size-compactness.6,7 The most severe bottleneck that prevents the wide commercialization of the PEFCs is their low durability in terms of Pt sintering and dissolution under high electrode potential, as well as the oxidation corrosion of the catalyst-supporting materials,8–16 that lead to fast sintering and dissolution of Pt nanoparticles.17,18 Accordingly, it is expected that the high oxidation-stability of the supporting materials in the MEAs is a key factor to enhance the durability of the PEFCs.
Currently, graphitic carbon materials, such as carbon black (CB) including Ketjen, Vulcan and acetylene black have been widely used as the catalyst supporting materials in PEFCs due to their high surface areas, ease of Pt nanoparticle loading, relatively high electron conductivity and low cost.19 Such graphitic carbons have a high number of defect sites (essentially composed of sp3 carbons) that are connected to hydrophilic functional groups, such as epoxy, –COOH and –OH moieties. These functional groups contribute to the increase in the catalyst-support surface areas, improved Pt nanoparticle loading, as well as good dispersity in polar solvents, such as alcohol. However, it has been reported that the electrochemical oxidation process of carbon more easily occurs at the sp3 carbons than at the sp2 carbons, leading to the nonhomogeneous agglomeration and/or detachment of the metal nanoparticles from the catalysts.20 Hence, a carbon material with a highly graphitized surface (less sp3 carbon) together with a new substitutive strategy of anchoring the metal nanoparticles is highly required in order to develop the next generation PEFC.
Recently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are cylindrical graphene tubes with a nano-sized diameter, have received a great deal of attention due to their highly graphitized structures together with relatively high surface areas and remarkable electrical conductivity.19,21,22 In addition, their fibrous structures are advantageous to form a catalyst layer (CL) sheet from the view point of smooth fuel gas diffusion.23 However, regarding the carbon defect-free structure, which is considered as a key factor for the improvement of the catalyst durability, the pristine CNTs lack high metal-loading efficiency due to the absence of metal binding sites.24 To overcome this disadvantage, CNTs have been generally treated by a harsh oxidation process (e.g., strong acid treatments) to introduce defect sites for metal binding.25 In order to avoid these destructive treatments, various polymers, such as polyallylamine hydrochloride,26,27 chitosan,28 polyaniline,29–31 poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride),32,33 and polypyrrole31,34,35 have been proposed to introduce the binding sites into the CNT surfaces for metal loading. Based on such a strategy, we have reported stable polymer-wrapped pristine-CNT composites using polybenzimidazole polymers (PBIs; Fig. 1).36–38 The PBI polymer on the CNTs has worked both as a good binder for the highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles and as a proton conductor in the electrocatalyst layer. Thus, our fabricated PBI-wrapped-CNT electrocatalyst is envisioned to support a more durable PEFC due to the use of the pristine CNTs.

This study is the first report describing the durability of the pristine CNTs at high temperature and under non-humidified PEFC conditions. In addition, in this report, we compare the performance measured at high temperature and under non-humidified conditions of two different MEAs prepared using the pristine CNT-based electrocatalyst and CB-based electrocatalyst before and after the durability testing.
Experimental
Materials

N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), ethylene glycol (EG), hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), and 85% phosphoric acid were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical, Ltd., and used as received. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs; ca. 20 nm diameter) were kindly obtained from the Nikkiso Co. Carbon black (CB; Vulcan XC-72R) was purchased from Cabot Chemical Co., Ltd. Poly[2,2′-(2,6-pyridine)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole] (PyPBI) and poly[2,2′-(m-phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole] (PBI) were synthesized based on previously reported methods.39 CNT/PyPBI/Pt was prepared based on our previous report.36 For comparison, CB/PyPBI/Pt was prepared by a similar procedure. In order to show the importance of PyPBI as a coating layer, an electrocatalyst of pristine CNTs without PyPBI coating was also prepared in a similar way.37 The PBI membranes doped with phosphoric acid were prepared according to our previous method.38
Materials characterization
The XPS spectra were measured using an AXIS-ULTRADLD (Shimadzu). The TGA measurements were obtained by using a TGA-50 (Shimadzu) at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flowing air of 20 mL min−1. The SEM and TEM micrographs were obtained using SU8000 (Hitachi High-tech) and JEM-2010 (JEOL, an acceleration voltage of 120 kV) electron microscopes, respectively. A copper grid with a carbon support (Okenshoji) was used for the TEM observations. The XRD patterns were recorded with a Smartlab X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) using CuKα radiation at λ = 1.5405 Å. The measurements were performed in the 2θ range of 3–90° with the 2θ scanning step of 0.02°, scanning step time of 4 s, filament intensity of 40 mA, and 30 kV voltages.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed by using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE-3; Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.) with a conventional three-electrode configuration in a vessel at room temperature. A glassy carbon electrode (GC) with a geometric surface area of 0.282 cm2 was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential of the electrode was controlled by using an ALS-Model DY2323 (BAS) potentiostat. The catalyst suspension was typically prepared as follows. The composites (1.0 mg) were ultrasonically dispersed in an 80% aqueous EG solution (2.0 mL) to form a homogeneous suspension. A portion of the CNT/PyPBI/Pt suspension (16.2 μL) was then cast onto a GC electrode to produce a uniform catalyst layer. For CB/PyPBI/Pt, 16.5 μL of the suspension was cast. Finally, the cast films on the electrodes were air-dried. The CV measurements of the electrocatalysts at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 were carried in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 in order to determine the ECSA values.
Fuel cell testing
The electrocatalyst composite was ultrasonically dispersed in an EG/water mixture, and then deposited on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) (SIGRACET gas diffusion media GDL 25 BC, SGL Carbon Group) by vacuum filtration. The GDL was used as a filter to produce a gas diffusion electrode (GDE). The H3PO4 doped-PBI membrane was sandwiched between two GDEs to fabricate an MEA.38 The obtained MEA was hot-pressed at 120 °C and 5 MPa for 30 s before the measurements. The performance of the MEAs was measured at the temperature of 120 °C using a computer-controlled fuel cell test system (model 890e, Scribner Associate, Inc.). The polarization curves were recorded at atmospheric pressure under dry hydrogen (100 mL min−1 flow rate) and air (200 mL min−1 flow rate) as the anode and cathode gases, respectively, without any external humidification.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
The EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz using a Solartron 1287/1260 potentiostat/frequency response analyser equipped with the Zplot software. The Nyquist spectra were used for the analysis. The obtained data were fitted using this software (Zview, Scribner Associate, Inc.).
Results and discussion
The CNT-based electrocatalyst (CNT/PyPBI/Pt) was prepared according to our previous paper,36 and the CB-based electrocatalyst (CB/PyPBI/Pt) was synthesized by a similar procedure (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3a, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) diagrams of these electrocatalysts show the N 1s peak at around 400 eV (ref. 40) and the Pt 4f doublet peaks at 71.1 and 74.4 eV that are attributed to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, respectively,41 indicating the presence of PyPBI and Pt in the electrocatalysts (for narrow scans, see ESI, Fig. S1†). The C/N ratio in CB/PyPBI/Pt determined by XPS was 95.5/4.5, which was almost identical to that of CNT/PyPBI/Pt (C/N = 95/5.0), indicating the presence of similar amounts of PyPBI in the two electrocatalysts. Fig. 3b shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of CB/PyPBI (dashed red line), CB/PyPBI/Pt (solid red line), CNT/PyPBI (dashed black line) and CNT/PyPBI/Pt (solid black line). As can be seen, the thermal decomposition of CB/PyPBI started at ∼550 °C, while for CNT/PyPBI, it started at ∼710 °C. The observed higher thermal stability of CNT/PyPBI compared to CB/PyPBI clearly reflects the high thermal stability of the CNTs originating from their graphitic nature.42 After the deposition of the Pt metal catalyst, the thermal oxidation of both electrocatalysts was accelerated due to the catalytic effect of Pt (dashed lines in Fig. 3b).42 The amount of Pt loaded on the composites determined from the TGA curves at 900 °C was 45 wt% and 49 wt% for CB/PyPBI/Pt and CNT/PyPBI/Pt, respectively. Fig. 3c and d show the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, from which it is obvious that the uniform Pt nanoparticles were efficiently dispersed on both the CB/PyPBI (Fig. 3c) and the CNT/PyPBI composites (Fig. 3d). The ideal triple-phase boundary of CNT/PyPBI/Pt was clearly observed from the high resolution TEM image (Fig. S2†). The average particle diameters of Pt of CB/PyPBI/Pt and CNT/PyPBI/Pt determined from the Pt particle size distribution (Fig. 3e and f) were 3.95 ± 0.5 nm and 3.75 ± 0.3 nm, respectively.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in an acidic electrolyte solution (Fig. 4), from which we calculated the amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the Pt surfaces. The ECSA values of CB/PyPBI/Pt and CNT/PyPBI/Pt were determined to be 56.5 and 59.4 m2 gPt−1, respectively. All the above results have clearly indicated that our electrocatalyst preparation procedure developed for CNT/PyPBI/Pt was applicable to CB and a similar CB-based electrocatalyst composite was successfully synthesized.

Fig. 5 shows the polarization (solid lines) and power density (dashed lines) of the CB/PyPBI/Pt-based MEA (MEACB; red color) and the CNT/PyPBI/Pt-based MEA (MEACNT; black color). The power densities of the MEACB and MEACNT were ∼135 mW cm−2 and ∼160 mW cm−2, respectively. In order to determine the effect of the electrochemical properties of the MEACB and MEACNT on the fuel cell performance, EIS measurements were carried out.

The Nyquist plots of the MEACB and MEACNT were obtained by EIS measurements in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at the current densities of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6a) and 800 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b), and were analyzed using the equivalent circuit displayed in the inset of Fig. 6a, in which the circuit consisted of an ohmic resistance (RΩ), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and gas diffusion resistance (Rg).43 The determined resistance values are summarized in Table 1. Notably, all the resistances (RΩ, Rct and Rg) of the MEACNT were lower than those of the MEACB. As observed from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. 6c, the CL of the MEACB possessed an agglomerative structure, while that of the MEACNT (Fig. 6d) showed a fibrous network structure. Thus, we assume that the morphological difference between the CB-based CL and the CNTs-based CL resulted in the difference in impedance of their MEAs. Therefore, it is suggested that the fibrous network structure of the CNTs plays an important role in better proton conduction, charge transfer and gas diffusion pathways, thus leading to the improved FC performance.

To show the effect of PyPBI on the electronic and protonic conductivities of the CNT-based electrocatalyst, the impedance of CNT/Pt was measured (see ESI, Fig. S3†) demonstrating a Nyquist plot of the CNT/Pt based-MEA at 100 mA cm−2, and the result was compared to that of CNT/PyPBI/Pt. As observed, RΩ, Rct and Rg of CNT/Pt increased by 37%, 17% and 53%, respectively, compared to those of the CNT/PyPBI/Pt (see ESI, Table S1†), indicating a sluggish electrode activity for the CNT/Pt composite.
The two different MEAs (MEACNT and MEACB) were subjected to durability testing based on the protocol provided by the Fuel Cell Commercialization of Japan (FCCJ),44 in which the potential sweeps (0.5 V s−1) were cycled between 1.0 and 1.5 V at 120 °C under non-humidified conditions with flowing H2 and N2 at the anode and the cathode, respectively. The polarization curves were recorded every 1000 cycles after switching the cathode gas from N2 to air. The durability testing was terminated when the potential was less than 60% of the initial voltage at 200 mA cm−2.45Fig. 7(a and b) shows the polarization curves from the durability testing of the MEACB (Fig. 7a) and the MEACNT (Fig. 7b), in which, for simplicity, representative curves after specified cycles were selected for display. To more clearly compare the results, the cell voltages of the MEACB and the MEACNT at 200 mA cm−2 are plotted as a function of the potential cycling numbers (Fig. 7c). The 200 mA cm−2 region is chosen since this current density is often used for the stationary PEFCs.46 It was found that after 15000 potential cycles of both MEAs, the cell voltage of the MEACB (red line) drastically decreased. In a sharp contrast, the MEACNT (black line) exhibited a gradual decrease upon cycling. Since the components of the assembled MEAs (MEACB and MEACNT) were the same, except for the carbon support materials, such an evident durability difference is due to the difference in the oxidation stability between the CB and CNTs.

(c) Plots of the cell voltage at 200 mA cm−2 as a function of the number of potential cycling for the MEACB (red line) and MEACNT (black line) during the durability testing. 
For better understanding of the role of PyPBI as a coating layer, the composite of the CNT/Pt without PyPBI polymer coating was analyzed, showing the following features. Fig. S4† shows a TEM image of the pristine CNTs loaded with the Pt metal (CNT/Pt composite). As observed from the image, large aggregates of the Pt metal were formed in a nonhomogeneous distribution way because pristine CNTs lack the binding sites of Pt.24 The CV of the CNT/Pt catalyst (see ESI, Fig. S5†) shows weak hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks compared to that of the CNT/PyPBI/Pt electrocatalyst. The ECSA of CNT/Pt was recorded to be 16.6 m2 gPt−1, confirming the Pt aggregates observed from the TEM measurement. The assembled MEA of the CNT/Pt electrocatalyst show poor fuel cell performance with low open circuit voltage (see ESI, Fig. S6†), emphasizing the lack of the electrocatalyst homogeneity into the MEA. These observations indicate the importance of the PyPBI-coating for the fabrication of an active electrocatalyst of the pristine CNTs.
In order to obtain more information about the stability of the CNT-wrapped and CB-wrapped electrocatalysts, their MEAs (MEACNT and MEACB) were delaminated during and after the durability testing, and then analyzed using TEM and XRD. Fig. 8a and b show the TEM mages of the electrocatalysts of the cathode side of the MEACB and the MEACNT after 12000 potential cycles, respectively. The 12000 potential cycles were chosen for the study, since they are close to the durability break points of the MEACB (see Fig. 7c). Notably, the Pt particle sizes increased for both the CB-based and the CNT-based electrocatalysts compared to their initial particle sizes. The increase of the Pt particle size was more obvious in the case of the CB-based electrocatalyst where it reached 6.24 nm (Fig. 8c) compared to 5.55 nm for the CNT-based electrocatalyst (Fig. 8d). Such an increase in the Pt size of the CB-based electrocatalyst would be due to the faster corrosion process of the CB-support material; namely, upon potential cycling, an accelerated fusion process of the neighboring Pt particles occurs, leading to the formation of bigger Pt particles. In a good agreement with the results obtained by TEM, the XRD pattern of the CB-based electrocatalyst has showed an obvious broadening in the graphitic (002) peak after 12000 potential cycles (Fig. 9a), confirming the fast corrosion process of the CB-based electrocatalyst. In a sharp contrast, such a broadening in the graphitic (002) peak was not observed in the CNT/PyPBI/Pt electrocatalyst after the same number of potential cycles as shown in Fig. 9b. Accordingly, the ex situ monitoring of these delaminated MEAs has showed two important features: (i) the Pt aggregation of CB/PyPBI/Pt was accompanied by the corrosion of the CB-support material, and (ii) the pristine CNTs exhibited a much higher structural stability upon potential cycling compared to the CB material.

Fig. 10 shows the TEM images after the durability testing (20000 potential cycles and 80000 potential cycles for the CB-based electrocatalyst and the CNT-based electrocatalyst, respectively). Quite interestingly, the TEM image of the CB-based electrocatalyst after the durability testing shows a similar Pt-size distribution (average Pt size was 6.46 nm, see ESI, Fig. S7†) which is comparable to that after 12000 cycles (the average Pt size was 6.24 nm, see Fig. 8c) despite the significant performance deterioration of the MEACB after 20000 cycles shown in Fig. 7c. On the other hand, for the MEACNT, although a slight deterioration in the performance was observed after the 80000 cycles of the durability test, the Pt nanoparticles exhibited an evident agglomeration process as shown in Fig. 10b (unfortunately, the Pt histogram was not provided due to the huge Pt aggregates). Such contradictory results are explained by the following hypothetical mechanism. Namely, (i) the continuous corrosion of the CB-support during the potential cycling caused a disconnection in the electron pathways between the carbon atoms after 15000 cycles, leading to a significant drop in the FC performance and (ii) the aggregation of the Pt on the CNT-support only caused a slight deterioration in the FC performance upon potential cycling because the conductive network structures of the CNTs still remain and support good electron pathways. Indeed, we observed clear tubular structures of the CNTs in the TEM image of the CNT/PyPBI/Pt electrocatalyst even after 80000 potential cycles (see Fig. 10b).

Consequently, the inherent structural stability of the pristine CNTs and the activation of CNTs for Pt loading through the PyPBI polymer-wrapping process played an important role in the protection of the carbon support from the direct exposure to the corrosive environment, leading to high PEFC durability at the elevated temperatures. Such a significant enhancement of the durability has not been reported yet in either half-cell47–51 or MEA42,52,53 comparisons between the CB and the CNT, in which oxidized CNTs have been used. Hence, we owe this very high durability of the CNT-based MEA to the inherent structural stability of the pristine CNTs.
Conclusions
In this study, we fabricated different FC electrocatalysts based on CNT and CB catalyst-supports to show the importance of the PyPBI polymer-wrapping process on the FC durability at high operating temperature (120 °C) and under non-humidified conditions. The polymer wrapped-CNT based-MEAs showed a remarkable durability compared to the CB-based MEAs. Such a high durability of the CNT-based MEA was due to the inherent structural stability of the pristine CNTs and the polymer wrapping process that protected the carbon support from the direct exposure to the corrosive environment. The accelerated deterioration behavior of the MEACB was due to the fast corrosion process of the CB support which led to the Pt agglomeration.
The presented study is highly important for the design and fabrication of the next generation fuel cell electrocatalysts.
