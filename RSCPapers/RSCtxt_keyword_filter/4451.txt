    , Accepted 8th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractZnS as an inorganic passivation agent has been proven to be effective in suppressing charge recombination and enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). In the present study, we constructed a novel TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS photoelectrode via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD). The complementary effects of multi-ZnS layers on the optical and electrochemical performance of the QDSCs were systematically investigated. The multi-ZnS can not only facilitate the growth and distribution of QDs, but also suppress the different interface charge recombination effectively. We suggest that the formation of the ZnCdS intermediate layers via ion-exchange route during CBD process contributes to the higher photoelectrochemical cell performance of the QDSCs with the middle ZnS layer. When the three-layer ZnS was employed in CdS/CdSe co-sensitized system, the PCE reached 6.05%, which is much higher than that observed for solar cells with the conventional single ZnS treatments and the two layers inserted at the interface between CdS QDs and CdSe QDs and electrolyte (4.80% and 5.42%, respectively).
1. Introduction
In recent years, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have been widely investigated because of the attractive characteristics of quantum dots (QDs) as sensitizers, such as size tunable band-gaps, good chemical stability, high molar extinction coefficient, possible multiple exciton generation effects and simple preparation procedure.1–4 Despite these advantages, currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of chalcogenide QDs (e.g., CdS,5 CdSe,6 PbS,7 CdSe/CdS,8 CuInS29 and ZnCuInSe10) based QDSCs still lags behind 13% (28 mm2 area) of dye sensitized solar cell and 22.1% of perovskite solar cells.11,12 The lower PCE is related to the inefficient charge separation and severe recombination with the photoelectrode interface architecture.13–15 The interface charge recombination includes:
(1) Recombination of electrons with surface defects of metal–oxide (e.g., TiO2,16 ZnO17 and SnO218);
(2) Recombination of electrons with the oxidized species in the electrolyte;
(3) Recombination of the excited electrons and free electrons at the surface states of QDs.19–21 The third point is relevant to the preparation of QDs.

In situ growth methods including successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD) have been widely used to deposit QDs directly onto photoanode film to ensure a high coverage of the effective metal–oxide surface.22 However, the resultant QDs, particularly the surface states of the QDs are far from perfect due to low temperature processing. Such surface states of QDs exert an appreciable but detrimental role leading to pronounced charge recombination.23,24 Taking these recombination paths into consideration, several strategies have been attempted to attenuate interfacial recombination processes to enhance the performance of QDSCs.
Presently, passivation of the QDs as well as metal-oxides with a thin barrier layer has been regarded as the most efficient way to reduce charge recombination as described in the previous reports. Among them, ZnS and ZnSe have been the most frequently studied inorganic passivating agents in QDSCs. Such passivating materials can prevent charge recombination from the QDs or metal–oxide to the electrolyte, which are attributed to their higher conduction band (CB) edge, as compared to the commonly used metal-oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO) and QDs (e.g., CdS and CdSe). In 2002, Yang et al.13 pioneered a ZnS layer to prevent chalcogenide photocorrosion in PbS/CdS QDSCs and thus, improved the performance of the cell. Shen et al.25 unraveled that the improvement in performance of QDSCs was fundamentally ascribed to the passivation of the QDs surface states by ZnS layer by preventing electron trapping. Furthermore, dealing with TiO2 using ZnS coatings can also be considered as a blockage of TiO2 surface, which can reduce the leakage of the electrons injected into the metal–oxide toward the electrolyte. Recently, Kim et al. designed a type of heterostructure by inserting a ZnS layer between the TiO2 and CdS, which yielded a PCE of 3.69%.26 They found that the ZnS interlayer can facilitate the growth of CdS QDs and suppress the electron back-transfer from TiO2 to QDs sensitizer. Huang et al. also demonstrated successful design and fabrication of QDSCs with a high efficiency of 7.24% based on CdS/CdSe QDs with two ZnSe layers inserted at the interfaces between QDs and TiO2 and electrolyte.27 In addition, Zhou et al. reported the CdS/CdSxSe1−x/CdSe multilayer structure applied in QDSCs and also, they demonstrated that the CdSxSe1−x interlayer can facilitate charge injection and impair the interfacial defects for retarding charge recombination.28
In the present study, we further developed a novel TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS (TZ3) photoelectrode with multi-layer ZnS. The QDSCs based on TZ3 exhibited a high PCE of 6.05% (Jsc = 16.60 mA cm−2, Voc = 622 mV), which is more than 26% higher than that of a traditional structure of TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS (TZ1, Jsc = 13.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 599 mV, PCE = 4.80%). The influence of multi-ZnS layers on optical and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated in QDSCs. The results obtained from the UV-vis absorption spectra show that the cascade structure of the novel photoanode architecture has a complementary effect in light harvesting to enhance the absorption intensity. Electrochemical tests show that the combination of multi-ZnS-layer contributes to attenuation of the interfacial charge recombination rate and prolongs the electron lifetime, resulting in more efficient charge collection in QDSCs. Among the multi-ZnS layers, the ZnCdS intermediate layer originates from the conversion of the middle ZnS layer via ion-exchange route during CBD process, which can help facilitate the growth of QDs and consequently improve the PCE. Thus, it was found that the performance of solar cells can be enhanced by controlling the incorporation of the ZnS passive layer at the appropriate sites.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Titanium oxide (TiO2, Degussa, P25), α-terpineol (C10H8O, 95%, Aladdin), ethyl cellulose (EC) ([C6H7O2(OC2H5)3]n, 48.0–49.5% (w/w) as ethoxyl, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfide anhydrate (Na2S·9H2O, ≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, 98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt monohydrate (N(CH2COONa)3, ≥98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfite anhydrous (Na2SO3, ≥98%, Aladdin), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(AC)2·2H2O, 98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.99%, Aladdin), and selenium powder (Se, 200 mesh, 99.999%, Alfa) were all used without further purification. Ultrapure deionized water was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions.
2.2 Preparation of mesoporous TiO2 films
TiO2 mesoporous films were fabricated according to a literature method.24 A TiO2 paste was obtained on dispersing 1 g Degussa P25 mixed with 0.5 g ethyl cellulose and 3.5 g α-terpineol in 10.0 mL ethanol in round-bottom flask and then removing the ethanol via stirring. Subsequently, the white TiO2 paste was coated on the clean FTO substrate (the active area is 0.196 cm2) via the doctor blading method. Then, the substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air.
2.3 Growth of CdS/CdSe QDs and ZnS passivation layer
The growth of CdS and CdSe QDs in situ on TiO2 films was carried out in the same manner as reported in our previous study.29 For the deposition of CdS QDs, the film was immersed in 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O solution and 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O solution for 1 min, in sequence, followed by rinsing with methanol and drying. This process was repeated for five consecutive cycles. CdSe was deposited through a CBD procedure. The CBD solution contained 0.1 M Na2SeSO3, 0.1 M Cd(AC)2·2H2O, and 0.2 M N(CH2COONa)3 with a volume ratio of 1:1:1 under dark condition for 3 h at room temperature.
For the ZnS passivation-layer deposition, ZnS was adsorbed onto the electrodes using SILAR process as follows. First, the electrodes were immersed into a 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O solution for 1 min, rinsed with methanol and dried in air. Subsequently, the electrodes were dipped into a 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O solution for another 1 min, rinsed with methanol and dried again. Several separate layers of ZnS coatings were applied to the electrodes.

Fig. 1 illustrates explicitly the fabrication steps of assembling the CdS/CdSe QDs and ZnS passivation layers with the different photoelectrode structures according to the list of sample names.

2.4 Counter electrode, electrolyte, and device assembly
The Cu2S was employed as the counter electrode and polysulfide aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte, which were assembled to form solar cells using a scotch tape. The detailed experimental procedure of preparing electrolyte and counter electrode were described in the previous paper.29
2.5 Characterization
The morphology of the films was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 250). The compositional EDX analysis and elemental mapping on the samples were carried out by EDX integrated in SEM. The optical absorption properties were studied by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900H). The current density (J)–voltage (V) performance of the solar cells was measured with a source meter (Keithley 2400) under a simulated AM of 1.5 G sunlight with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded using 7-SCSpec response measurement system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by an impedance analyzer (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) under dark conditions with a forward bias of 0.65 V. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were measured on the same electrochemical workstation equipped with a frequency response analyzer under an intensity-modulated (30–150 W m−2) light emitting diode (LED 470 nm).
3. Results and discussion
To evaluate the influence of ZnS layer on the optical properties of the CdS/CdSe QDs sensitized TiO2 films, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three photoelectrodes. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the absorbance is significantly enhanced by changing the ZnS layer deposition sites from the outer to inner, particularly on introducing the middle layer. Compared to the single ZnS (TZ1), the absorption onset of two ZnS layers (TZ2) and the multi-ZnS layers (TZ3) show a slight red shift. These absorption features indicate that the combination of multi-ZnS-layers have a different but significant influence on the optical absorption in QDSCs compared with the single ZnS. Undoubtedly, it is favorable for harvesting solar light in the cell devices. The influence of ZnS layer at different sites on the optical properties was systematically studied and the results are displayed in Fig. S2.† These results suggest that the ZnS layer deposited at different sites in CdS/CdSe QDs co-sensitized system exercised different effects on the light absorption of the photoelectrode. In the presence of the inner ZnS as a seed layer, the amount of CdS incorporated was enhanced greatly and in turn, increased as the CdS layer promotes the growth of CdSe QDs and consequently improves the absorbance intensity, which appears as a red shift.26,30

In recent years, ion-exchange has been proven to be very simple and effective for inorganic QDs as well as for the passivation agent.31,32 Huang et al. reported a new passivation method for chlorinated PbSe QDs via ion exchange with cesium lead halide (Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals to produce high-quality PbSe QDs.33 Furthermore, Yang et al. have demonstrated the TiO2/ZnSe template immersed into a Cd2+ source solution; the cation of Cd2+ substitutes the Zn2+ in the ZnSe during this process and forms ZnxCd1−xSe QDs.34 In our case, the ZnCdS intermediate layer was formed via this simple and facile ion-exchange route during CBD process to obtain the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS photoelectrode. The reaction process can be expressed by reaction (1): ZnS + xCd2+ → Zn(1−x)CdxS + xZn2+(1)
Furthermore, the CdS or CdSe have a large lattice mismatch with the composites of ZnS, which are 7.3% and 12% respectively.35,36 However, the introduction of the ZnCdS intermediate layer derived from the middle ZnS by CBD process can reduce the lattice mismatch strain and the number of interfacial defects. As demonstrated from the previous reports,32,37 the middle ZnCdS buffer layer can help facilitate the growth of QDs on the pre-prepared film, leading to a high absorption and an extended spectral range. This can be explained based on the sharply enhanced light absorption intensity and slight red shift for the middle layer as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The novel structural TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS indicates that the enhancement of light absorption is beneficial to capture more photons and thus generate more excitons. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the light harvesting efficiency “LHE” is given by the equation:38 LHE = 1–10−absorbance.(2)
The LHE of TZ3 is also observed to be higher than the others, which is consistent with the observations from absorption spectra. The higher absorbance of TZ3 can be attributed to a fact that the combination of the multi-layer ZnS at different sites plays a significant complementary effect on the optical properties. Furthermore, these absorption features demonstrate that the intermediate buffer layer plays an important role in the light capture efficiency.
We fabricated the TiO2/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe sample to remove the influence of the inner and outer ZnS as displayed in Fig. 1. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the top view and cross sectional view of the SEM images of the TiO2/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe, respectively. When the QDs were assembled on the TiO2 film (Degussa P25, ∼25 nm), no apparent difference in the surface morphology was observed compared to the bare TiO2 film (as shown in Fig. S1†). This may be due to the presence of these QDs, which cannot be distinguished under the resolution of the SEM.30 The thickness of the TiO2/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe film is approximately 13 μm with a porous structure, which can favor the penetration of electrolyte and the deposition of the QDs. The atom ratios of the elements in the TiO2/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe photoelectrode are shown in Fig. 3(c); the atomic percentages of Cd, Zn, Se, S were found to be 56.8%, 1.2%, 36.95%, and 5.04%, respectively. The results clearly illustrate that the Zn2+ in the ZnS is not substituted completely by Cd2+, but is formed as ZnCdS at room temperature, which is consistent with the previously reported observation.34

In order to evaluate the internal resistance and charge recombination processes of QDSCs, EIS was performed under dark conditions with an applied voltage set to Voc of the QDSCs. QDSCs can be viewed as an equivalent circuit combining a series resistor with some parallel connected resistors and a capacitor as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4(a). Rct represents the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interfaces and within the TiO2 films.8 The fitting data of the EIS by Z-view software are displayed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the Rct values of the three photoelectrodes decrease in the order: TZ3 > TZ2 > TZ1. The charge recombination resistance in a QDSC is primarily determined by Rct. A high Rct value indicates a retarded backward reaction of the injected electron transfer at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface.39 EIS result of TZ3 sample reveals that the complementary effect of multi-layer ZnS can effectively control the charge recombination at different interfaces. Moreover, the similar Cμ values can be observed from Table 1, indicating that the inherent property of the different sensitizers have no evident effect on the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2.40 The electron lifetime (τn) can be estimated by τn = Rct × Cμ.41 The τn of the QDSCs with a multi-layer ZnS is 276.15 ms, which is much longer than that of the QDSCs with the two ZnS layers or the single ZnS layer. The longer τn suggests a reduced interface charge recombination and an accelerated charge separation in TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS based QDSCs. According to EIS results, the inner ZnS can decrease the charge recombination between TiO2 and electrolyte interfaces and retard the recombination process of electrons populating the TiO2 and holes populating the QDs. Moreover, the formation of ZnCdS intermediate layers can reduce the number of defect sites, which can control the recombination reaction from TiO2 or CdS to electrolyte and thus increase the charge separation efficiency.42 The detailed Nyquist plot curves (Fig. S3†) and corresponding fitting results (Table S1†) of each cell for ZnS deposition at the different sites in QDSCs are available in ESI.†

Fig. 4(b) shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of the three cells (TZ1, TZ2, and TZ3). The value of the dark current reflects the combination level of electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 with the electrolyte.43 As shown in Fig. 4(b), the dark current values of TZ3 based solar cells were much lower than that of the TZ1 and TZ2 based solar cells. This result indicates that the cascade structure, which employed the multi-ZnS layer modification, can strongly inhibit the charge recombination process. In addition, the decreased dark current with multi-ZnS layers contributes to the increase in Voc.44
The electron transport and recombination in QDSCs have also been studied by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). From Fig. 5, we can observe the dependence of the time constants, τd and τn, which can be measured by the following equations:45,46 (3) (4)where fIMPS and fIMVS are the frequencies of the minimum IMPS and IMVS imaginary component, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), both the τd and τn decreased with the increase in the light intensity. The IMPS results at varied light intensities clearly illustrate that τd for QDSCs based on TZ3 (0.91–0.18 ms) is shorter than that based on TZ1 (3.73–0.40 ms) and TZ2 (1.66–0.22 ms). For QDSCs, the shorter τd and the longer τn corresponds to faster electron transport and longer electron lifetime, respectively.47 Therefore, the new structure of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS based QDSCs has the higher electron transport and collection mobility and the lower charge recombination, which is consistent with results of EIS and the dark current–voltage.

Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V curves of the QDSCs. The performance parameters of different devices are summarized in Table 2. For J–V analyses, we used the same electrolyte and CEs for all the samples. The counter electrode material has a major effect on the FF.48 We used Cu2S film on a brass foil as the electrode material, so FF can be considered similar. When the single ZnS layer was loaded on the surface of TiO2/CdS/CdSe, the device generated a Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 599 mV, yielding a PCE of 4.80%. When the middle layer was inserted between CdS and CdSe of TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS, the Voc and Jsc greatly increased. Furthermore, when the inner ZnS layers were deposited between TiO2 and CdS/ZnCdS/CdSe/ZnS, a Jsc of 16.6 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 622 mV was achieved; also the highest PCE of 6.05% (an increase of ∼26%) was achieved for this QDSC. It can be seen that the multi-ZnS-layer applied in CdS/CdSe co-sensitized system can significantly improve the Voc and Jsc. The improved Jsc primarily results from the higher light capture efficiency caused by embedding the middle layer and consequently generating more excitons,29 which is in accordance with the absorption spectra. Fig. 6(b) shows the IPCE spectra for the TZ1, TZ2 and TZ3 in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. According to a previous report,29 the calculated Jsc value from the IPCE for the TZ1, TZ2 and TZ3 solar cells are 12.3, 14.0 and 15.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curves under the error range. The maximum IPCE value of the TZ3 based solar cell (∼83%) is higher than that of TZ1 and TZ2 based solar cells (∼70% and ∼76%), which indicates its good performance. In addition, the overall photoresponse of the solar cell matches well with its absorption features with the photocurrent onsets directly correlated with the absorption onsets.

It is worth noting that the reduced interface charge recombination is often used to explain the higher Voc.24 The schematic of charge recombination process in multi-ZnS-layer based QDSCs are illustrated in Fig. 6(c). The inner ZnS act as a blocking layer, which can help separate the injected electrons in TiO2 from the positively charged QDs and the redox couple of polysulfide electrolyte, thus hindering an interfacial recombination to obtain a high voltage, VOC.26,27 For the assembly of the middle layer, we suggest that the middle was converted to the ZnCdS buffer layer via ion-exchange route during CBD process. This can help to reduce the lattice mismatch and the number of defect sites to form the close-fitting core/shell structure.31,32 Thus, ZnCdS buffer layer can reduce the charge recombination at CdS/CdSe interface and increase the charge separation efficiency. This enhancement in PCE can be attributed to the new cascade structure of the multi-ZnS-layer, which is capable of enhanced light absorption, reduced charge recombination and a prolonged electron lifetime. The comparative representation of ZnS passivation layers used to boost the performance of the photovoltaic devices reported in other studies is presented in the Table 3. Clearly, the combination of ZnS multi-layer inserted in CdS/CdSe co-sensitized system has a superior performance via simple in situ fabrication techniques. Optimization and integration of the device structure will open up great opportunities to achieve high-performance QDSCs.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the multi-ZnS-layer introduced into the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized system was assembled into a new structure via a successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The cascade structure is demonstrated to promote the deposition of QDs and to decrease charge recombination, collectively leading to high efficiency QDSCs. The incorporation of multi-ZnS layers offers two benefits:
(1) As a seed layer, it can facilitate the growth and distribution of QDs, resulting in a higher light adsorption; and
(2) As a passivation layer, it can effectively embellish the surface state of QDs and metal–oxide, contributing to retarded charge recombination which can prolong the electron lifetime. Based on ion-exchange by the CBD process, an intermediate ZnCdS layer is formed at the interface between CdS and CdSe, which can help reduce the lattice mismatch strain and the number of interfacial defects, and consequently enhance the quantum yield for the photogeneration of charge carriers. Eventually, compared with the TZ1 device, the open circuit voltage, the short-circuit current and PCE of the TZ3 are increased from 599 mV to 622 mV, from 13.5 mA cm−2 to 16.6 mA cm−2, and from 4.80% to 6.05%, respectively.
