    , Accepted 6th December 2012First published on 7th December 2012AbstractIn this communication, high specific capacitance of CuS nanotubes (2393 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 and 2175 F g−1 at 15 A g−1) was obtained in redox active polysulfide electrolyte through combination of the pseudocapacitance of CuS nanotubes in electrolyte and the faradic capacitance of electrolyte at the electrode electrolyte interface.
The ever worsening energy and global warming issues call for the urgent development of clean and high performance energy storage devices. As a new class of energy storage devices, supercapacitors have attracted intense attention over the past decades owing to their higher power density than secondary batteries and conventional electrostatic and electrolytic capacitors. It is well accepted that the capacitance of supercapacitors greatly depends on the electrode material.1 To date, there are three major types of electrode materials for supercapacitors: carbon materials,2 metal oxides/hydroxides1,3 and conducting polymers.4,5 Compared with these widely used electrode materials, some metal sulfides are receiving increasing attention as supercapacitor electrode materials in view of their interesting intrinsic properties and excellent performance.6,7
As a p-type semiconductor metal chalcogenide, CuS shows potential applications in sensors,8 solar energy devices,9 photothermal conversion 10 and Li-ion batteries.11 To date, there have been many reports about the synthesis and application of CuS nanotubes (CuS NTs),8,12 but to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports about their application in supercapacitors. In this communication, porous CuS NTs were successfully used as supercapacitor electrode materials, and showed high capacitance.
The electrolyte is another important factor affecting the capacitance of a supercapacitor. An alternative method to enhance the capacitance of carbon material based supercapacitors has been reported through using a redox active electrolyte. The redox active electrolyte can provide additional pseudocapacitance by quick redox reaction at the electrode electrolyte interface. Various redox mediators have been added into acidic electrolytes to improve the capacitance of carbon material based double layer capacitors.13–17 But as far as we know, an effective redox mediator used in an alkaline electrolyte has rarely been reported.18,19 Bearing this in mind, we attempted to discover a highly effective, versatile and low cost redox mediator for alkaline electrolytes, which are commonly used electrolytes for metal oxide based supercapacitors.20–23
Polysulfide electrolyte is an effective electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells for attaining high fill factors and high power conversion efficiencies.24 It has been reported that the S2−/Sx2− redox couple is an effective mediator in alkaline electrolytes. Metal chalcogenides such as CoS, PbS, and Cu2S exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide reduction, with Cu2S exhibiting superior activity and stability.25,26 But to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports about the use of S2−/Sx2− redox mediator to improve the capacitance of metal sulfide based supercapacitors.
In this communication, a novel redox active alkaline electrolyte was used to improve the specific capacitance of CuS NTs by adding S2−/Sx2− in conventional NaOH electrolyte (0.5 M NaOH/0.5 M Na2S/0.5 M S powder). It is the first report of the enhancement of capacitance by combining the pseudocapacitance of CuS NTs with the faradic capacitance at the electrode electrolyte interface. This new electrochemical system is promising for further developments of metal sulfide based high performance supercapacitors.
CuS NTs made up of small CuS nanoparticles were synthesized according to the previous report of our group using [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O (tu = thiourea) nanowires as self-sacrificial templates (ESI†).27 As shown in Fig. 1A, the diameter and length of the CuS NTs are about 100 nm and several micrometres respectively, retaining the 1D structure of the [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O nanowire precursor (Fig. S1, ESI†). The TEM image (Fig. 1B and 1C) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1C insert) clearly confirm the polycrystalline and porous hollow structure of the CuS NTs. Furthermore, from the magnified TEM image (Fig. 1C), we can clearly see that the CuS NTs are made up of small CuS nanoparticles. This specific structure was beneficial for electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion. This may be one of the reasons for the high specific capacitance. The XRD pattern in Fig. 1D confirms the hexagonal phase crystalline structure of CuS. No characteristic peaks of impurities were observed. The prepared high purity CuS NTs were successfully used as high performance supercapacitor electrode materials.

To evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the polysulfide electrolyte for electrical energy storage, cyclic voltammetric (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system with a graphite counter electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). Fig. 2 shows the CV curves of CuS NTs in polysulfide and conventional NaOH electrolytes (1 M). In NaOH electrolyte, only one redox peak appears; this may be due to the reaction between CuS and CuSOH (eqn (1)), which is similar to the redox reactions of NiO/NiOOH28 and CoS/CoSOH,29 because Cu, Co and Ni are in a contiguity family and have similar properties. In polysulfide electrolyte, three pairs of redox peaks appear. The redox peak O3/R3 may involve the redox reaction between CuS and CuSOH, which is in accord with the peaks in NaOH solution. Another two pairs of redox peaks (O1/R1 and O2/R2) may be due to the redox reaction of polysulfide at the electrode electrolyte interface. To date there have been many reports about the electrochemistry of polysulfide in ionic liquid and organic solvents, although the exact chemical mechanisms involved in a polysulfide electrolyte are very complicated and presently not well understood, it is reported that peak O1 is due to the oxidation of S2− to S atom (S0) (eqn (2)); the S0 is easily dissolved in concentrated Na2S solution to form polysulfide anions (Sx2−) (eqn (3)).30,31 At a high potential of about −0.3 V, Sx2− is oxidized to elemental sulfur (S8) (eqn (4)), which may be absorbed on a CuS electrode; these could be employed to index the peak O2.32 The reduction peak R2 is coupled to the oxidation wave O2 and can be assigned to the reduction from S8 to S82−(eqn (5)), which then disproportionates to S62− and S8 (eqn (6)).33,34 The following reduction peak R1 is attributed to the reduction from polysulfide anions Sx2− (x = 2–6) to S2−(eqn (7)).32,35 The reduction potentials of R1 and R2 are similar to the previous report.31 CuS + OH− ↔ CuSOH + e−(1) S2− → S0 + 2e−(2)30,31 (x −1)S0 + S2− → Sx2−(3)30,31 Sx2− → (x/8)S8 + 2e−(4)32 S8 + 2e− → S82−(5)33,34 4S82− → 4S62− + S8(6)33,34 Sx2− + 2e− → Sx−12− + S2− (x = 2–6)(7)32,35

The specific capacitance of CuS NTs in NaOH and polysulfide also can be calculated from the CV curves according to the previous report.36 In polysulfide electrolyte, the capacitance of CuS NTs is 2393 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, which is 4 times higher than that in NaOH electrolyte (503 F g−1). The results indicated that the faradic reaction of polysulfide at the electrode electrolyte interface largely improved the specific capacitance of CuS NTs. It was an effective route to improve the capacitance by combining the pseudocapacitance of electrode materials with the faradic capacitance of the electrolyte at the electrode electrolyte interface through the use of a redox active electrolyte.

Fig. 3 shows the EIS plots of CuS NTs in polysulfide and NaOH electrolytes. The EIS plot in polysulfide (enlarged image shown in Fig. 3 bottom insert) is composed of three parts: a high frequency semicircle, an intermediate frequency semicircle and a low frequency trail. The high frequency semicircle and intermediate frequency semicircle are related to the charge transfer resistance in the CuS NTs electrode bulk (Rct1) and at the electrode electrolyte interface (Rct2) respectively. The low frequency trail involves the Warburg diffusion resistance (W). The equivalent circuit for fitting the EIS plot is shown in Fig. 3B top insert. However, in NaOH electrolyte, only one large and not closed semicircle involved in the electron transfer resistance in the CuS NTs electrode bulk (Rct1) was observed. The electron transfer resistance in NaOH is larger than that in polysulfide. The CV and EIS results indicate the useful dual role of the polysulfide anions, as an electrolyte with good conductivity and a source of faradic capacitance.

The Tafel curve is a useful tool to study the kinetics of electrolyte reactions. In general, exchange current density (i0) and transfer coefficient (α) are two key parameters that influence the rate of a charge transfer controlled electrochemical reaction.37i0 reflects the inherent rate of the rate-determining step of an electrochemical reaction, its magnitude depends on the concentration and order of the reactants and the temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, the i0 in 0.5 M NaOH and polysulfide electrolytes are 7.0 mA cm−2 and 20.6 mA cm−2, which indicate that the charge transfer rate in polysulfide electrolyte is faster than that in NaOH, which is in accordance with the EIS results. α is the fraction of potential energy that is transferred to the reaction. It can be calculated from the Tafel slope according to the previous report.37 The values are 0.64 and 0.27 for NaOH and polysulfide electrolytes respectively. The α in polysulfide electrolyte is smaller than 0.5; this may due to the electrochemistry of polysulfide being very complicated, where one or more electron transfer reactions followed by a series of chemical transformations occur at each electrochemical reaction.37 Tafel slope = 2.303RT/(αF)(8)

In order to understand the nature of the faradic reaction of polysulfide at the electrode electrolyte interface, we also investigated the capacitor as a function of the electrolyte formulation. In the view of specific capacitance, as shown in Fig. 5A, the specific capacitance at 10 mV s−1 increased with the Na2S and S concentration from 0 to 0.5 M (NaOH concentration was 0.5 M). The low polysulfide concentration is not enough to efficiently improve the capacitive performance, but at higher polysulfide concentration, corrosion of the electrode will occur. The corrosion is harmful to the cyclability of CuS NTs. In the view of the charge transfer resistance, as shown in Fig. 5B, the ohmic series resistance and charge transfer resistance decrease with the Na2S and S concentration from 0 to 0.5 M. These results further confirm that the addition of S2−/Sx2− in NaOH can effectively improve the capacitance and charge transfer rate of CuS NTs. Taking into account the specific capacitance, charge transfer resistance and cyclability, the optimal electrolyte concentration is 0.5 M NaOH, 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M S.

The energy storage performance of CuS NTs in polysulfide electrolyte was evaluated by CV and cyclic chronopotentiometry (CP) methods. Fig. 6 displays the CV curves and the corresponding specific capacitance of a CuS NT electrode in polysulfide electrolyte at different scan rates. From the CV curves we can find that, as the scan rate increases, the potentials of the oxidation and reduction peaks shift to more positive and negative directions. This may be due to the limitation of the ion diffusion rate to satisfy electronic neutralization during the redox reaction.38 The specific capacitances are found to be 3102, 2393, 1884 and 1117 F g−1 corresponding to the scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 50 mV s−1. It is amazing that, even at the high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the high specific capacitance of 1117 F g−1 is retained, which is much higher than 887 F g−1 at 40 mV s−1 for Ni(OH)2/graphene composite in 1 M KOH,23 and 850 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 for Co3O4/Ni(OH)2 composite in 1 M NaOH.22

Fig. 7 shows the CP curves and the corresponding specific capacitance of a CuS NT electrode in polysulfide electrolyte at different current densities of 15–50 A g−1. In the case of a current density lower than 15 A g−1, longer time was needed to charge the supercapacitor, which was not in accordance with the standard of a supercapacitor. The three charge/discharge platforms correspond to the three redox peaks in the CV curves. The three plateaus in the charge portion of the CP curve from the bottom up correspond to oxidation peaks O1, O2 and O3 in the CV curve respectively. The three plateaus in the discharge portion from the top down correspond to the reduction peaks R2, R1 and R3 in the CV curve respectively. The relationship between the redox peaks and the voltage plateaus have been reported in battery like materials.39 The highest specific capacitance of 2175 F g−1 was obtained at the current density of 15 A g−1 (the donation of the Ni foam current collector is negligible as shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). This was more than 17 times higher than the recently reported 122 F g−1 for a CuS nanoneedle/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite at a current density of 1.2 A g−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte7. This high specific capacitance was higher than many widely used supercapacitor materials including 1471 F g−1 for Co3O4 nanosheets at 10 A g−1 in 2 M KOH21 and 1335 F g−1 for Ni(OH)2/graphene composites at 2.8 A g−1 in 1 M KOH.23 Remarkably, opposed to the typical pseudocapacitance effect, which is observed only in moderate regimes, our proposed electrochemical system can be loaded until 50 A g−1, supplying still 646 F g−1. These results indicate that in this novel polysulfide electrolyte, CuS NTs performed with high power performance. This can be explained by the following merits. (a) The porous CuS NTs were made up of small CuS nanoparticles; this specific structure can provide large surface area and good electron transfer passage. (b) The fast redox reaction of S2−/Sx2− at the electrode electrolyte interface affords rich faradic capacitance. (c) The charge transfer resistance of the CuS NT electrode in polysulfide electrolyte is small (less than 1 Ω), which is of benefit for charging and discharging in a rigid regime.

To further explore the performance of the CuS NT electrode in our proposed polysulfide electrolyte, the energy density and power density derived from the discharge portion of the CP curve were calculated according to the previous report.23 As shown in Fig. 8, the maximum energy density of 592 W h kg−1 and the highest power density of 35 kW kg−1 were obtained at an operation voltage of 1.4 V (black), superior to many previously reported materials containing Ni(OH)2/graphene (red),23 MnO2/Ni(OH)2 (green)20 and CuS/CNT (blue)7 composites (these value were based on a single electrode). These results indicate that in our proposed polysulfide electrolyte, the CuS NT electrode performed with high energy density and power density, which was promising for the further development of high performance hybrid electrochemical capacitors by coupling our CuS NT material with a suitable counter electrode material with a comparable high performance. This is a clear next step for our proposed CuS NT electrode material and polysulfide electrolyte.

The cyclability of the CuS NTs in polysulfide electrolyte was also investigated using the CV method. In order to avoid the loss of CuS NTs, the Ni foam loaded CuS NTs were pressing under a pressure of 10 MPa with two blank Ni foams to form a sandwich structure. From Fig. 8B, we notice that a noticeable capacitance loss was obtained during the repetitive CV measurements at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1, This may be due to the following reasons. On the one hand, CuS NTs are made up of small CuS nanoparticles; in the charge/discharge process, the small CuS nanoparticles may flake off from the CuS NTs and this may result in the mass loss of active species. On the other hand, the redox reaction is a quasi reversible process; this is also responsible for the capacitance fading. Despite the relatively poor electrochemical stability, the attractive capacitance exhibited by this electrode material in our proposed polysulfide electrolyte inspires us to improve it in latter studies.
In summary, this is the first report of an effective method to enhance the capacitance of metal sulfide by the combination of the pseudocapacitance of electrode bulk and faradic capacitance at the electrode electrolyte interface. Polysulfide electrolyte is a highly effective and low cost redox electrolyte for metal sulfide based supercapacitors. In this electrolyte, our proposed CuS NTs exhibited a high specific capacitance of 2393 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 2175 F g−1 at a current density of 15 A g−1. It is an important step in supercapacitor development and is promising for the further development of metal sulfide based high performance supercapacitors.
