    , Accepted 17th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractDespite the rapid development of organic solar cells (OSCs), light harvesting efficiency is limited by a compromise between light absorption and charge recombination loss due to the low carrier mobility of organic materials. To circumvent this block, a facile route is to implement the photonic structures into an ultrathin photoactive layer of OSCs to fully use the incident light. Herein, a simple yet cost-effective paradigm for light-trapping enhancement of OSCs is proposed by introducing the dual-grating patterns via a two-step soft nanoimprinting technology. The original grating templates are simply duplicated from a commercial CD or DVD disk, which can avoid the complicated mold fabrication process and allow the easy transfer of various two-dimensional grating patterns into OSCs. With an optimized dual-grating, a substantial increase in the photo-generated current of 11.6% is realized, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 9.92% for PTB7:PC71BM-based OSCs. The experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the light-trapping enhancement is attributed to broadband light scattering and the grating period longer than the absorption region can minimize the destructive interference. We anticipate that the proposed light manipulation scheme could help to achieve highly efficient OSCs of various material systems due to the ease of use and drastic improvement in efficiency.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have been attracting continuous attention in the past decade due to their advantages of low-cost, simple fabrication, light weight, mechanical flexibility and large-area manufacturing compatibility.1–8 Many efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of OSCs in terms of the synthesis of new materials, morphology control, and interface engineering, so as to better match with the solar spectrum for the increase in short-circuit-current (JSC) and manipulate the contact energy for the decrease in the open-circuit-voltage (VOC) loss and charge recombination loss.4–16 To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art OSCs with a single-junction and tandem junction has exceeded 14% in the scientific literature.17,18 However, further PCE enhancement is urgently required with the concurrent development of materials, device architectures and fabrication processes for the module fabrication.
Especially, the low carrier mobility and short exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors restrict the photoactive layer thickness in the range of 100–200 nm to minimize the charge recombination loss for charge extraction. The incident light cannot be fully absorbed for photocurrent generation in such a thickness scale, and thereby the resulting external quantum efficiency (EQE) of commonly reported OSCs is between 60% and 80%.19 Therefore, a great challenge for a substantial increase in EQE and PCE of OSCs is to enhance the light trapping in an ultrathin photoactive layer over a range of wavelengths. The popular strategy to enhance the light trapping is the introduction of photonic structures to appropriate positions in OSCs to increase the internal scattering or prolong the optical length of the incident light, or induce the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or localized plasmon resonance (LPR).20–22 To date, a variety of light trapping schemes have been advanced, including the doping of metallic nanoparticles,23–25 microlens array-based antireflection coatings,26–28 corrugated nanostructures inside photoactive layers,3,16,29 patterned transparent electrodes,30–32 and so on. Despite the performance improvement, some of these light-trapping structures are often accompanied by complicated fabrication procedures, the incompatibility with nanoscale organic films, or the challenges of precisely engineering such objects over large areas, which inevitably hinder their practical adoption. Hence, a simple and nondestructive approach to develop light-trapping structures is crucial for the optimization of high-efficiency OSCs.
In recent years, soft nanoimprinting technology has been fully developed, which convincingly demonstrates a simple and damage-free method to introduce different periodic or random structures into OSCs for the remarkable enhancement in JSC and PCE.33–36 Typically, very expensive fabrication processes (e.g., with e-beam or laser lithography techniques) are necessary to create an original mold with pre-designed nanostructures suitable for broadband light trapping. Here, we investigate the ability of integrating nanoimprinted dual-gratings as a light-trapping structure into the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) of OSCs for broadband self-enhanced light absorption and the enlarged optical path length. Particularly, a simple yet cost-effective method of fabricating a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold as the original grating template is proposed by duplicating from a commercial CD or DVD disk, which can avoid the complicated mold fabrication process and allow the easy transfer of various two-dimensional grating patterns into OSCs.36,37 The advantage of patterning the ZnO layer is the enhanced light scattering at the interfaces of both ZnO/polymer and polymer/back metal electrodes. In addition, many different periodic patterns are obtained via the two-step soft nanoimprinting technology by changing the nanostructured PDMS molds. Upon optimization of the 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-grating, a substantial increase in JSC of 11.6% is realized without sacrificing the VOC and fill factor (FF), yielding a maximum PCE of 9.92% for OSCs based on a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) photoactive layer. To our knowledge, this result shows one of the highest PCEs for OSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM blend (see the summary in ESI Table S1†).2,38–41 The impact of grating periodicity and cross-angles on device performance is experimentally and theoretically explored, showing that light-trapping enhancement is attributed to broadband light scattering and the grating period longer than the absorption region can minimize destructive interference.
2. Experimental section
2.1. PDMS mold preparation
To fabricate the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold, the polysiloxane pre-polymer solution was prepared by mixing an elastomer base and a curing agent in a ratio of 1:10, followed by thorough stirring and removing all the generated bubbles. The pre-polymer solution was then poured on the surface of a CD or DVD disk (ESI Fig. S1†), and cured at 60 °C for 6 hours. A PDMS mold with a one-dimensional grating of a certain period was obtained after removing it from the CD or DVD disk.
2.2. Device fabrication
OSCs were fabricated with a structure of glass substrate/ITO/ZnO (with or without dual-gratings)/PEIE/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. Prior to device fabrication, ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in Decon 90, acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 20 min in sequence, and subsequently dried at 110 °C in an oven. The sol–gel-derived zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 220 mg zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.5%; Sigma-Aldrich) in 2000 μL 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich) and 61 μL ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH; Sigma-Aldrich) with vigorous stirring for 12 hours for the hydrolysis reaction under ambient conditions. After UV ozone treatment for 15 minutes, ITO–glass was spin-coated by the sol–gel ZnO precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 40 seconds, followed by annealing at 130 °C for 20 seconds. The first PDMS mold was subsequently placed on top of the ZnO layer along the grating direction at an annealing temperature of 130 °C with a continuous press for 10 seconds. Then, the second PDMS mold was rotated to a certain angle, and placed in conformal contact with the ZnO layer at an annealing temperature of 150 °C for 1 minute to ensure the formation of cross gratings onto previously patterned gratings. The resulting dual-grating-patterned ZnO layer was formed after the PDMS mold was removed and continuously annealed at 150 °C for 20 minutes. As a comparison, the spin-coated ZnO layer for the reference flat device was directly annealed at 150 °C for 20 minutes without any PDMS treatment, resulting in an ∼40 nm-thick ZnO film. To modify the interface between the ZnO and the polymer active layer, PEIE solution that was diluted with 2-methoxyethanol to get a concentration of 0.4%, was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer (with or without gratings) at 5000 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. Then the resulting substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The PTB7:PC71BM blend solution consisting of 5 mg PTB7 and 7.5 mg PC71BM (purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech) dissolved in 485 μL ODCB and 15 μL DIO was spin-coated on top of the ZnO/PEIE layer at 1500 rpm for 2 minutes. To complete the OSC fabrication, the samples were transferred to an interconnected high vacuum evaporation chamber (base pressure: 2 × 10−6 Torr), in which an 8 nm-thick MoO3 layer and an 100 nm-thick Ag film were thermally deposited with a shadow mask on the active layer to form the top anode for hole collection. The active area defined by the overlap between the ITO cathode and the Ag anode was 0.0725 cm−2. A quartz crystal microbalance was used for monitoring the deposition rate and the layer thickness.
2.3. Film & device characterization
The surface morphologies of the samples were characterized with AFM (Veeco MultiMode V) in the tapping mode and SEM (FEI, Quanta 200FEG). Transmission and reflection data were recorded using an UV/vis/near-IR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750) with an integrating sphere at room temperature. The layer thickness of the films was measured with an alpha-SE™ Spectroscopic Ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam Co., Inc). The photovoltaic characteristics of OSCs were examined using a programmable Keithley 2612 source measurement unit under one sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91160, 100 mW cm−2) in air at room temperature. The EQE measurements were performed with a photo-modulation spectroscopic setup (Newport monochromator), which consisted of a xenon lamp, an optical chopper, a monochromator, and a lock-in amplifier operated by a computer. The illumination intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode with a known spectral response.
2.4. Optical simulation
The near-field distributions in OSCs were simulated based on the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) approach (Lumerical FDTD Solutions 8.7.3) as well as in-house generated codes. In the OSC modeling, the optical properties, e.g., polarized incident light, reflection, absorption, and surface plasmonic resonance were fully taken into account. The depth and period of two-dimensional (2D) patterned nanostructures were determined from AFM images. The refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of ITO, ZnO, and PTB7:PC71BM used in the simulations were determined experimentally using the ellipsometer. All the devices (with or without gratings) were simulated with the same model parameters to get a reasonable comparison.
3. Results and discussion
The OSCs with an inverted structure used in this work consist of an ITO-coated glass substrate as a transparent cathode, a sol–gel derived ZnO layer as an ETL, an ultra-thin polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) layer as a buffer layer, a PTB7:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction as the photoactive layer, and a MoO3/Ag bilayer as an anode. Fig. 1 presents the schematic diagram of the OSC fabrication process on ITO-coated glass substrates. The two-dimensional (2D) periodic dual-gratings were incorporated in the sol–gel-derived ZnO ETL via a simple two-step soft nanoimprinting technique with the PDMS molds (Fig. 1b and c). Here, two kinds of gratings were duplicated from the CD and DVD disks, respectively, showing the periods of 1500 nm and 800 nm, the line widths of 1000 nm and 500 nm, and the fill factors of 500 nm and 300 nm. Except for the orthogonal patterns with the combination of two grating structures, the 2D dual-grating structures were prepared by tuning the cross-angles (i.e., 30° and 60°). The flat and patterned ZnO layers were then spin-coated with an ultrathin PEIE layer (Fig. 1d), which was used to reduce the ZnO work function and thus match the energy levels between the ZnO ETL and the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layer for improving the electron collection as well as blocking holes and exciton quenching at the contact.42,43 In addition, the PEIE treatment is beneficial to the adhesion of the spin-coated PTB7:PC71BM layer.44–46 After the spin-coating of the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layer on PEIE-coated ZnO (Fig. 1e), MoO3 and Ag were finally deposited to complete the whole device (Fig. 1f).

The surface morphologies of the patterned ZnO layers with various dual-gratings were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are shown in Fig. 2. It is found that the height and shape of the 2D patterns can be adjusted by changing the imprinting pressure imposed on the PDMS molds. For this reason, various patterns can be easily formed by means of the two-step soft nanoimprinting technique (see other examples in ESI Fig. S2†). It is noted that the PEIE treatment has negligible influence on the morphologies of patterned ZnO layers (ESI Fig. S3†). More importantly, the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layers spin-coated on various patterned ZnO substrates can maintain the patterned structures with a continuously tapered morphology as clearly demonstrated by the AFM micrographs in ESI Fig. S4,† although the spin-coated photoactive layers cause a little smoothing of the patterned structures with the decreased groove depth.

The optical transmittance spectra of flat and patterned ZnO layers on ITO–glass substrates were measured by collecting both specular and diffuse lights with an integrating sphere for the incident light propagating from the glass surface (inset of Fig. 3). It can be easily observed in Fig. 3 that the transmittance of patterned ZnO layers with all four kinds of orthogonal dual-gratings is enhanced in a wide spectral range of 400–800 nm as compared to that of the flat ZnO/ITO–glass substrate. For example, the patterned ZnO layer with an 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-grating shows the highest transmittance of ∼93% at a wavelength of 580 nm, higher than that of the flat ZnO layer with a transmittance of 89%. The specular and diffuse transmission characteristics of ITO–glass substrates with various ZnO layers were measured to determine the amount of light scattering that was induced by the patterned ZnO layer. The haze values (haze = diffuse transmission/total transmission) of ITO–glass substrates with various ZnO layers are also shown in Fig. 3, revealing the obvious contribution of light scattering to the transmittance enhancement in the visible wavelength range. The broadband transmittance nature of patterned ZnO layers with dual-gratings matches well with the light-trapping requirements in OSCs. In addition, the effect of cross-angles of dual-gratings on the total transmittance was investigated. It is evident in ESI Fig. S5† that the 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings with different cross-angles can cause obvious enhancement in optical transmittance in a wide spectral range of 400–800 nm, while the enhancements for dual-gratings with the cross-angles of 30° and 60° are slightly inferior to that of the orthogonal case.

Fig. 4a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of OSCs with and without dual-gratings under 100 mW cm−2 Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the use of dual-gratings results in the remarkable increase in JSC as compared to the reference device with a flat ZnO layer, while the VOC and FF of all the OSCs are of similar values. Especially, the device based on 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings exhibits the largest enhancement ratio of JSC as high as 11.6%, leading to a JSC of 18.02 mA cm−2 and thus the highest PCE of 9.92%. As listed in Table 1, the averaged PCE value is 9.54% for the device based on 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings, which indicates the slight deviation of the device performance in different batches. However, this deviation can be minimized by precisely controlling the nanoimprinting process. It is clearly shown in Fig. 4b that the dark J–V curves of OSCs with different dual-gratings are almost consistent with that of the flat device, implying the negligible difference in leakage current with the introduction of dual-grating patterns. It is thus inferred that the charge extraction efficiency is unaffected by the imprinted dual-gratings, while the JSC enhancement is mainly ascribed to the increased photocurrent generation. Moreover, the J–V characteristics of OSCs based on 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings with different cross-angles are compared in ESI Fig. S6,† and the detailed parameters are also summarized in Table 1. Analogous to the optical properties in ESI Fig. S5,† it is found that the OSCs based on different 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings exhibit similar JSC and PCE. These results demonstrate that the cross-angles of the dual-grating structures have a minor impact on the light harvesting of OSCs.

To identify the nature of the JSC enhancement, the EQE spectra of OSCs with and without dual-gratings were measured and plotted in Fig. 4c. Compared to the flat cell, the introduction of various dual-gratings leads to a uniform EQE enhancement profile across the visible wavelength range. The tendency of the EQE enhancements for various patterned OSCs is in good agreement with the increase in JSC (Fig. 4a), in which the device based on 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-gratings shows the highest EQE enhancement. The absorption (1-R–T) spectra of these devices with different dual-gratings were extracted from the reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) spectra, which were measured through an integrating sphere for an optical propagation from the glass side. As shown in Fig. 4d, the presence of dual-gratings causes an obvious increase in the light absorption of OSCs relative to that of the flat device, which is consistent with the enhancements of the EQE and JSC. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the enhanced light harvesting is attributed to the increased light trapping in OSCs due to the use of dual-gratings.
Note that there is a lack of significant enhancement of EQE and absorption beyond the absorption edge (i.e., ∼750 nm) of the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layer as shown in Fig. 4c and d, which is contrary to the previous reports.25,29,34 It is usually found that the use of light-trapping structures in the scale of 100–500 nm results in a significant increase of the photocurrent in the near-infrared wavelength region due to the plasmonic excited absorption enhancement when compared with analogous devices constructed on flat surfaces.25,34 To get deep insight into the optical effect of dual-gratings on the enhanced light harvesting, the simulation of near-field light propagation inside various OSCs was performed by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method (see the Experimental section for the detailed procedure of optical modeling).47 Here we simply applied the transverse electric (TE) polarized light into the FDTD simulation process to shorten the simulation time by taking into account the same characteristic meaning about the results of transverse magnetic (TM) or TE polarized light application. Fig. 5 displays the cross-sectional views of near-field profiles in OSCs with and without dual-gratings for TE-polarized incident light at 430 nm and 630 nm with the same intensity. For simplification, the field intensity distributions of 800 nm × 1500 nm and 1500 nm × 800 nm dual-gratings can be referenced to those of 800 nm × 800 nm and 1500 nm × 1500 nm structures, respectively. It is apparent that the optical modeling qualitatively shows the influence of dual-gratings on the light trapping. The field intensities are rather weak in the active layer of the reference device constructed on a flat ZnO layer (Fig. 5a and b), implying that only a little part of the incident light can be effectively absorbed and the majority remains unused. Conversely, the introduction of dual-gratings into the ZnO ETL (Fig. 5c–f) can markedly increase the field intensities inside the PTB7:PC71BM layer, which are favorable for the light absorption in the photoactive layer to generate the photocurrent. According to a previous report,48 the photonic structures inside the photoactive layer may function as a resonant structure and a low loss mirror, and the corresponding optical interference can affect the absorption by enhancing the light scattering and prolonging the optical length. It should be emphasized that the light-trapping enhancement is just a geometric effect, which rules out plasmon excitation or other exotic causes (e.g., nonlinear frequency shifting or tip-enhanced field effect) for the light harvesting enhancement.29 In addition, it is noted that the use of a 1500 nm × 1500 nm dual-grating structure (Fig. 5e and f) will induce the higher field distribution in the photoactive layer than the case of an 800 nm × 800 nm structure (Fig. 5c and d). This difference may originate from the longer grating period that can minimize the destructive interference of the incident light inside the photoactive layer. These simulation results are in agreement with the aforementioned optical characterization and photovoltaic parameters, confirming the effect of dual-grating structures on light harvesting enhancement.

4. Conclusion
In summary, high-efficiency OSCs with dual-gratings for broadband light-trapping enhancement have been demonstrated through a simple yet cost-effective two-step soft nanoimprinting technology, which is suitable for designing flexible, large-scale and low-cost optoelectronic devices. The original grating templates are simply duplicated from a commercial CD or DVD disk, which can avoid the complicated mold fabrication process and allow the easy transfer of various 2D grating patterns into OSCs. With an optimized dual-grating, a substantial increase in JSC of 11.6% is realized without sacrificing the VOC and FF, yielding a maximum PCE of 9.92% for PTB7:PC71BM-based OSCs. The impact of grating periods and cross-angles on the device performance is experimentally and theoretically investigated, showing that the light-trapping enhancement is attributed to broadband light scattering and the grating period longer than the absorption wavelength can minimize the destructive interference. We anticipate that the light manipulation approach used here could promote the realization of highly efficient OSCs of various material systems because of the ease of use and drastic improvement in efficiency.
