    , Accepted 12th January 2012First published on 13th January 2012AbstractA series of “H” type dye sensitizers with pyrrole as the conjugated bridge were synthesized, in which two pieces of N-arylpyrrole-based organic dye moieties were linked together through various aromatic rings. Interestingly, the introduced aromatic isolation group not only gave a new possibility to modify the construction structure, but also controlled the topological structure of the resultant dyes in some degree. As a result, their performance could be adjusted, and the configuration of “H”-type could suppress the aggregations on the TiO2 surface. The performance of the DSCs based on these dyes as the sensitizers demonstrated that the structure of these dyes was beneficial to the devices, and the conversion efficiency of the solar cell based on dye LI-22 with carbazole as the isolation group was as high as 5.22%.
Introduction
Stimulated by the pioneering work of O'Regan and Grätzel,1 Dye-Sensitized Solar cells (DSCs) have attracted great attention, with the highest efficiency of ∼11% achieved from ruthenium metal-based sensitizers under air mass (AM) 1.5 illumination.2–4 Apart from precious metal-based sensitizers, the metal-free organic dyes as DSC sensitizers were another promising alternative for the scientists, which possess the easily adjustable structures, the high molar extinction coefficients, and the relatively cost-effective facile preparation processes. Thanks to the great efforts of researches, lots of organic dyes with donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) structures have been examined in DSCs, with top efficiencies reaching 10%,5 such as indoline,6 triphenylamine (TPA),7 coumarin,8 perylene,9 and so on, most of which are in a rod-shaped configuration.
The achieved success, so far, on one hand, confirmed that the metal-free organic dyes are the most promising candidates for DSCs, more importantly, on the other hand, indicated that the structure of the dyes could heavily affect or even determine the final efficiencies of the corresponding DSCs. Thus, for the synthetic chemists, it is still needed to explore new organic dyes with novel structure, to further improve the conversion efficiencies of DSCs. Perhaps, other types of dyes, in addition to the traditional rod-shaped ones, should be designed.
For optimizing the popular type of rod-shaped organic dyes, various functional groups and their derivatives have been introduced to the D-π-A system to expand the absorption spectra of the dyes and reduce the charge recombination,10 which would be favorable to enhance the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) as well as the fill factor (ff). The most used strategies were to strengthen the abilities of the donors and acceptors, and to introduce more conjugate bridges or modify the conjugated system. For the donor group, the excellent electron-donating property and aggregation-resistant nonplanar molecular configuration of triphenylamine made it an important donor in many organic dyes.7 As to the acceptor, cyanoacetic acid was mostly used for its strong electron-withdrawing and anchoring capability onto a TiO2 surface.11 Thiophene derivatives have been widely used as the π-conjugate bridges,5,12 however, the extension of the linker length of thiophene derivatives usually aggravated the aggregation, which was considered to be one of the major factors accounting for the low photovoltaic performance of DSCs.13
To suppress the possible aggregations formed on the TiO2 surface, some hydrophobic alkyl chains could be introduced in the π-conjugate bridges.14,15 Also, it was reported that the incorporation of aromatic rings to the donor group could efficiently prevent the π–π stacking and reduce the charge recombination between redox couple and the injected electrons in the TiO2,16 to improve the performance. Thus, it might be a good way to link some aromatic rings to the conjugate bridge, to optimize the performance of the organic dyes. However, the related examples are very scarce, possibly due to the limitation of the synthetic flexibility of the frequently used thiophene ring.
In comparison with the thiophene ring, the different direction of the electric dipole moment of pyrrole indicated that the big π system comprised the electronic properties of n electrons, derived from the nitrogen atom, to a larger degree, much more than those in the cases of thiophene (Chart 1). This special point should benefit its abundant electron density, directly leading to the more effective charge transfer between the donors and the acceptors if used as a linker, as partially proved by the results of the pyrrole-based second-order nonlinear optical chromophores.17 More importantly, it was easy to link the non-coplanar aromatic rings through single bonds to the pyrrole ring on the nitrogen atom. With these considerations, some pyrrole-based organic dyes were designed and prepared in our group,18 and demonstrated satisfactory results, indicating that N-arylpyrrole might be a novel conjugation moiety to optimize the performance of the organic dyes.
 Chart 1  The dipole moment of pyrrole, thiophene and furan. 
In 2006, for the first time, we linked two pieces of donor–π-acceptor blocks together through an isolation group to yield a new type of chromophore, which we termed as “H”-type chromophores (Chart 2).19 Once embedded into the polymeric system, the resultant polyurethane containing this “H”-type chromophore (PS2, Chart 2) exhibited an enhanced second-order nonlinear optical effect, in comparison with its linear analogue (PS1, Chart 2), realizing the effect of “one plus one is greater than two”, due to the presence of the isolation group, which weakened the aggregation of the donor–π-acceptor blocks. Other examples of our group and other scientists also confirmed this effect.20 Thus, we wondered: how about the results if two pieces of rod-shaped organic dye moieties were bonded together through an isolation group? However, it seemed that so far, there were no reports apparently concerning this question.
 Chart 2 
Therefore, all the above points prompted us to prepare some novel “H”-type pyrrole-based organic dyes, in which two pieces of N-arylpyrrole-based organic dye moieties were linked together through various aromatic rings (Chart 3). The obtained three dyes demonstrated relatively high conversion efficiencies and an anti-aggregation effect. Herein, we would like to report their syntheses, structural characterization, electrochemical properties, theoretical calculations, and photovoltaic performance in detail.

Experimental section
Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over and distilled from K-Na alloy under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Compound 1 was prepared following the procedure reported in the literatures.18 All other reagents were used as received.
Instrumentation
The 1H NMR spectroscopy study was conducted with a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra were measured on a Voyager-DESTR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS; ABI, American) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser and a 1.2 m linear flight path in positive ion mode, or a GCT premier CAB048 mass spectrometer. UV-visible spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. Differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) were carried out on a CHI 660 voltammetric analyzer at room temperature in nitrogen-purged anhydrous CH2Cl2 with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. A platinum disk and a Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode and quasi-reference electrode, respectively. The ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used for potential calibration.

The reaction was stirred at 80 °C for 30–40 h. Once cooled to room temperature, the organic layer was separated, dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated until dry.

Preparation of solar cells
The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was prepared by following the procedure reported in the literature.21 A TiO2 colloidal dispersion was made by employing commercial TiO2 (P25, Degussa AG, Germany) as a material. Films of nanocrystalline TiO2 colloidal on FTO were prepared by sliding a glass rod over the conductive side of the FTO. Sintering was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. Before immersing in the dye solution, these films were soaked in the 0.2 M aqueous TiCl4 solution overnight in a closed chamber, which can significantly increase the short-circuit photocurrent. The thickness of the TiO2 film was measured to be about 13 μm. After being washed with deionized water and fully rinsed with ethanol, the films were heated again at 450 °C, followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dyes for 24 h at room temperature. For the coadsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid was added. The adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont). The redox electrolyte was placed in a drilled hole in the counter electrode by capillary force and was driven into the cell by means of vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using a UV-melt gum and a cover glass. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in the mixed solvent of acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (7:3, v/v).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to be 100 MW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). J-V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The cell active area was tested with a mask of 0.28 cm2. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with an IPCE test system consisting of a model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp and power supply, and a 7ISW301 spectrometer.
DSCs property test
The DSC was illuminated by light with energy of a 42 mW cm−2 from a 500 W Xe lamp. A computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter was employed to collect the J-V curves. The photoelectric conversion efficiency was calculated according to eqn (1): (Equation 1)In the formulas, η is the global efficiency, Voc, Jsc, and FF are open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, and fill factor, respectively. Pin is the power of the incident light.
Result and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to “H” type dyes was depicted in Scheme 1. Under the normal palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction between compound 1 and one of compound 2–4, the bisaldehydes 5–7 were obtained with two units of aldehyde 1 linked with different aromatic rings. Finally, the three dyes were prepared from bisaldehydes 5–7 and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine, through a Knoevenagel condensation reaction. It should be pointed out that just by conveniently changing the aromatic moieties of compound 2–4 in the Suzuki reaction, different “H”-type dyes could be easily yielded. Thus, the distance between the two pieces of D-π-A moieties could be adjusted by utilizing different isolation groups. Also, as discussed later, the whole topology of the resultant “H”-type dyes was dependant, at some extent, on the used isolation groups. This was unexpected at the very beginning of the design, however, gave a new possibility to modify not only the construction structure but also the topological structure of the resultant dyes, which should have some influence on the performance of the corresponding DSCs. The products were characterized by spectroscopic analyses, and all gave satisfactory data corresponding to their expected molecular structures (the data listed in the experimental section). Importantly, they were soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, THF, DMF, and DMSO, thus, there were many choices of the solvents in the fabrication process of DSC devices.

Absorption properties in solutions and TiO2 film
Absorption spectra of the three dyes in diluted solution of CH2Cl2 were shown in Fig. 1, and their absorption data were listed in Table 1. In the UV-vis spectra, the three dyes exhibited two main prominent bands, appearing at 300–400 and 400–550 nm, respectively. The former was ascribed to the localized aromatic π–π* transition, and the latter was that of the charge-transfer character, which was from the donor part of the triphenylamine moieties to the acceptor end group. There was no big difference in the maximum absorption peaks of the three dyes, indicating that the aromatic rings linked on the pyrrole ring had little influence on the D-π-A conjugated systems. This point could be partially confirmed by their calculated electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO, since there were nearly no interactions between the two pieces of the D-π-A conjugated systems and the isolation groups. Interestingly, this phenomenon could hardly be observed in other five-member heterocyclic rings, such as thiophene and furan.

Fig. 2 showed the absorption spectra of the three dyes on TiO2 film after 24 h absorption. The maximum absorption peaks and the absorption bands of them were red-shifted compared to their spectra in solution, which should be ascribed to the electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. The interaction between the carboxylate group and the surface Ti4+ ions could lead to the increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated framework, thus, the energy of the π* level was decreased by this delocalization, resulting in the red shifted absorption spectra.

Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer between the TiO2/dye/redox electrolyte systems, differential pulse voltammograms (DPV) were performed in CH2Cl2 solution, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3). The oxidation potential of the dyes was determined from the peak potentials (Ep) by DPV, the oxidation potential vs. NHE (Eox) corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), while the reduction potential vs. NHE (Ered), which corresponds to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), could be calculated from Eox−Eo–o. Both of the LUMO and HOMO levels of these dyes agreed well with the requirements for an efficient sensitizer: First, their LUMO levels were negative of the CB level (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of TiO2, and the Egap ranges from 0.78–0.84, which were all larger than the gap of N719 (Egap = 0.35). Assuming that energy gap of 0.2 eV was necessary for the efficient electron injection, these driving forces were large enough for the injection; secondly, HOMO levels of the dyes were more positive than the iodine redox potential (0.4 V). Thus, these oxidized dyes could be regenerated from the reduced species in the electrolyte to give an efficient charge separation. Therefore, these dyes should be good sensitizers, as the electron transfer in DSCs was feasible

Electronic structure quantum chemical calculations
To gain insight into the geometrical and electronic properties of these dyes, we mimicked the electronic structure of the dyes using time-depending DFT (TDDFT) calculations with Gaussian 03 program.22 In particular, we used the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional and a 6-31G* basis set. The ground-state structures of three “H” type dyes were shown in Fig. 4. As easily seen, in the “H” type dye, the two pieces of rod-shaped organic dye moieties had a planar geometry, and the dihedral angles of the triphenylamine-vinylene-pyrrole were little, indicating that the isolation groups between them did not twist the conjugation systems. Thus, this configuration would not only keep the charge transfer through the whole conjugation system, but also prevent the π–π* stacking between the planar structures. As mentioned in the introduction part, the linkage of some aromatic rings to the conjugate bridges, might be another approach to prevent the π–π stacking and reduce the charge recombination between redox couple and the injected electrons in the TiO2. Here, the calculated structure of these three dyes partially confirmed this point, thus, it was expected that the design of these new “H” type dyes might be a new way to optimize the performance of the organic dyes.
 Fig. 4  The optimized structures calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set for LI-21, LI-22 and LI-23. 
Analyzing the geometrical structure of the whole dye molecules in detail, it was found that these three dyes, although all of them were termed as “H”-type dyes, demonstrated very different topological structures. In them, LI-21 was more similar to the shape of “H”, while LI-23 could be considered as a twisted “H”; however, the shape of LI-22 was more like a “V” without the summit point. As the TiO2 film was somehow of spherical surface, the different topological structure of these three dyes would surely affect their adsorptions on the TiO2 film, and the shape of LI-22 might be the better one. From this point, perhaps, it could be claimed that the changing of the isolation groups between the two pieces of the D-π-A moieties in the “H”-type dyes could affect their adsorption behavior, to influence the final performance, in some degree. This realized the important role of synthetic chemists in the development of functional materials with good performance, who could modify the properties of the materials in the molecular scale.
The electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of these dyes was shown in Fig. 5. The HOMOs of these three dyes were spread over the triphenylamine unit through the pyrrole ring, and the LUMOs were located on the cyanoacetic acid and extended to the pyrrole moieties. Examination of the HOMOs and LUMOs of these dyes indicated that HOMO–LUMO excitation moved the electron from the triphenylamine to the cyanoacetic acid moieties. The change in local electron density distribution induced by photoexcitation resulted in efficient charge separation.

The photovoltaic characteristics of the three “H” type dyes as the sensitizers in DSCs were measured with a sandwich DSC cell comprising 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in the mixed solvent of acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (7:3, v/v) as the redox electrolyte. Details of the device preparation and characterization were described in the experimental section. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSCs were shown in Fig. 6. All three dyes could efficiently convert the light to photocurrent in the region from 300 to 600 nm. From the structure of these three dyes (Scheme 1), the π system was not too long, as the result, their absorptions located in the range of 300–600 nm. Since the above discussed results have already exhibited some special points of these “H”-type dyes, in the next step, some new “H”-type dyes with an expanded absorption spectra should be designed to pursue better performance. This research is underway in our laboratory.

Fig. 7 showed the current–voltage characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells employing three “H” type dyes as sensitizers under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. The photovoltatic characteristic parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) were listed in Table 2. N719 (ditetrabutylammoniumcis-bis(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)) is one of the best dyes for DSC, generally used as a well-reproducible standard control to evaluate the performance of new DSCs. For comparison, the performance of N719-based device, measured under similar conditions, was summarized in Table 2.

It has been verified that different dye baths for semiconductor sensitization had a crucial effect on the performance of the DSCs. As an attempt to improve the performance of the DSCs based on the three “H”-type dyes, we optimized the solvent of the dye baths. Considering the solubility of them, we chose CH2Cl2 and mixed solvents with DMF and ethanol as the solvents, with the results summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding J-V curves shown in Fig. 7. When the solution of CH2Cl2 was used, the DSC based on LI-22 showed better comprehensive properties with Voc of 0.69 V, Jsc of 11.33 mA cm−2, and ff of 0.65, corresponding to the conversion efficiency of 5.08%. This should be due to the higher Jsc of dye LI-22 (11.33 mA cm−2) than those of LI-21 (10.67 mA cm−2) and LI-23 (9.44 mA cm−2). When the solution baths were changed to the mixed solvents with DMF and ethanol, the Voc and ff values of the three dyes increased, and the DSC based on LI-22 still showed better comprehensive properties with Voc of 0.71 V, Jsc of 11.29 mA cm−2, and ff of 0.65, corresponding to the η value of 5.22%. These results were in good accordance to the above discussions. Since the isolation groups in these three dyes were different, the distance between the two pieces of the D-π-A moieties in each “H”-type dye was different, and interestingly, their topological structure was also different at a large extent. This difference, as discussed above, could affect their adsorption behavior on the TiO2 films, leading to the different performance. To know more about the relationship between the structure of these new “H”-type dyes and their performance, much more work should be conducted. However, the obtained preliminary results showed that these types of dye were promising, but might need some optimization in structure.
CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) is a transparent, organic compound which binds strongly to the surface of nanostructured TiO2, being able to displace dye molecules from the semiconductor surface and therefore hindering the formation of dye aggregates. Thus, the performances of the DSCs in the presence of CDCA with various concentrations were studied. The results were collected in Table 3, and the corresponding J-V curves were shown in Fig. 8. CDCA did not efficiently improve the device's performance, however, in some experiments, it decreased the power conversion efficiency. A possible explanation was that the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was reduced by the coadsorption of CDCA, resulting in a loss of active light-harvesting. Take dye LI-21 for example, without CDCA, when the TiO2 electrode was stained by immersing it into a dye solution (0.3 mM) in CH2Cl2 for 24 h, the amount of adsorbed dye was 3.34 × 10−7 mol cm−2, and when the addition of 10 mM CDCA and 20 mM CDCA, they decreased to 2.57 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 2.40 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. The result could be considered as a hint that these “H” type dyes did not aggregate on the TiO2 surface, as pointed out above.

Conclusions
In summary, three “H”-type dyes based on pyrrole ring were designed and prepared, for the application in dye-sensitized solar cells. Thanks to the flexible chemistry of pyrrole, some aromatic moieties could be conveniently introduced to suppress the possible aggregation of the dyes in DSC devices. Excitingly, the topological structures of this “H”-type dyes could be modified by the linkage of different isolation groups, which finally affect their performance as sensitizers, providing a new approach to optimize the chemical structure of dyes to achieve higher conversion efficiency. The solar cell based on the dye LI-22 with carbazole as the isolation group exhibited a 5.22% conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G sunlight. Coadsorption of CDCA did not improve the conversion efficiency of these devices, indicating that these “H” type dyes nearly did not aggregate on the TiO2 surface.
