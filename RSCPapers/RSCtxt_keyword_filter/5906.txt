    , Accepted 28th February 2021First published on 2nd March 2021AbstractFlexible fiber batteries with self-powering functionality will offer new opportunities for next-generation wearable electronic devices. Here, we present a high-capacity aqueous Zn-ion battery fiber that can directly harvest energy from ambient air to recharge without using additional power supply. The air-recharging capability stems from the freestanding cathode fiber consisting of nano-structured V6O13/aligned carbon nanotubes, which can induce a spontaneous redox reaction with ambient air at its discharged state for capacity recovery. This air-recharging process is reversible and compatible with the routine galvanostatic charge–discharge of aqueous Zn-ion batteries. The resultant battery fiber shows a high specific capacity (371 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1), stable cyclability (91% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1), and can be efficiently recharged to ∼60% upon exposure to air. Finally, we demonstrate a self-charging battery fiber to effectively power a strain sensor in an integrated, wearable fingertip.
Introduction
The widespread use of mobile and wearable electronic devices has driven the demand for flexible power solutions that are light and compact.1,2 Fiber batteries are promising because they are durable, light-weight and can be woven into textiles.3 However, it is challenging for fiber batteries to escape from the limited duration to meet the ever-increasing power demand of wearable devices.4–6 Moreover, the recharge and reuse of fiber batteries are restricted when the electricity power is unavailable, e.g., in outdoor usage scenarios, which are frequent occurrences for wearable electronics.7 To tackle above-mentioned limitations, numerous energy harvesting components including solar cells, triboelectric generators and biofuel cells have been integrated with fiber batteries into self-powered systems.8–12 However, they highly rely on specific energy resources, e.g., constant sunlight, frequent motions and large amount of sweat, which are sometimes unavailable to recharge the fiber batteries. Besides, external connections and accessories are required in such systems, reducing the advantageous flexibility and applicability of fiber batteries.
Other than the integration at the device level, designing self-chargeable electrode materials represents a promising option. Recent investigation have shown that several active redox materials, such as Prussian blue, tungsten oxides, polypyrrole and vanadium-based compounds, can be utilized for self-powered electrodes in planar electrochromic and energy storage devices due to their spontaneous oxidation reactions in ambient conditions.13–18 Thus, by employing such electrode materials, self-charging fiber batteries with simplified device configuration, being highly independent of usage scenarios, can be expected. However, the reported self-chargeable materials are assembled in rigid, open-structure devices, and show either limited capacity (<100 mA h g−1), poor reversibility, or inadequate efficiency. To date, there are no self-charging fiber batteries due to the bottlenecks of materials design and configuration-based solution, e.g., it is critical but difficult to synthesize electrode materials that possess good properties for both energy storage and self-charging; it is of course more difficult to achieve self-charging fiber batteries in flexible, compact configuration to afford reliable performances against various deformations and ambient erosions.
Here, we report a high-capacity, aqueous Zn-ion battery fiber that can be self-recharged in ambient air (Fig. 1a). As a key component, the self-chargeable fiber electrode was prepared by synthesizing nano-textile-like V6O13 onto the aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber via a facile solution-redox method. Nano-structured V6O13 is redox-active in a wide range of oxidation states, and can afford abundant active sites for Zn2+-storage to achieve high capacity.19 The freestanding V6O13/CNT hybrid fiber (VCF) is directly assembled as a cathode with a Zn anode fiber to produce the self-charging VCF/Zn battery fiber with high flexibility. We discover that the discharged VCF can be converted to its charged state with capacity recovery via a spontaneous oxidation reaction with air (O2). We refer to such a reaction as an air-recharging process, which is available in numerous environments since air is pervasive in our living space. An exceptional deintercalation mechanism, other than the conversion in previous self-chargeable electrodes, is demonstrated in the air-recharging process of VCFs. Constructing this air-rechargeable battery fiber in the paradigm of aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs)19–24 further offers several advantages including high specific capacity, safety and glove-free fabrication. In addition, a flexible, tubular low-density polyethylene encapsulation is designed to inhibit the fiber battery from electrolyte volatilization and moisture erosion in ambient air. The resultant air-recharging VCF/Zn battery fiber delivers a high specific capacity (371 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1), stable cyclability (91% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1), and can be efficiently recharged to ∼60% upon exposure to air without additional power supply.

Results and discussion
The synthesis of VCF designed for air-rechargeable ZIB fiber is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1b. Aligned CNT fibers obtained from a continuous floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition method25 (details in Note S1†) were twisted in a multi-strand manner and used as the fiber current collectors (Fig. S1 and S2†). V6O13 was then grown onto the aligned CNT fibers via a facile solution-redox reaction at room temperature (Fig. S3–S5†). Our synthetic approach circumvented the prolonged heat treatment required for the routine hydrothermal synthesis of vanadium oxides as well as a multi-step coating method to further obtain the vanadium oxide-based electrode for ZIBs.26 The freestanding, binder-free VCF with flexibility (Fig. S6†) may alleviate the exfoliation and cracking of active materials upon deformations and could be prepared in a scalable manner for the direct fiber battery assembly. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses showed that the interconnected, porous network of as-synthesized V6O13 nanobelts were uniformly anchored on the CNT fibers without discernible impurities (Fig. 1c–e and S7, S8†). The hierarchical CNT fibers increased the accessible surface area of VCFs (171.3 m2 g−1) to the electrolyte (Fig. S9†), enhancing not only the transport of electrons and Zn2+ ions for improved cathode utilization (Fig. S10†) but also the O2 absorption to activate the air-recharging reaction. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images further evidenced the anisotropic V6O13 structure with layer-spacing parallel to the length direction of nanobelts (Fig. 1f and S11, S12†).
Since the air-recharging process is based on the discharged cathode material, VCF was first paired with the Zn anode fiber to fabricate the VCF/Zn battery fiber (Fig. 2a and S13†) for the electrochemical evaluation. A high initial discharge capacity of 371 mA h g−1 was achieved at 200 mA g−1 (based on the mass loading of V6O13) with an average plateau of ∼0.78 V (Fig. 2b and S14†). The normalized capacity of the VCF/Zn battery fiber was 0.74 mA h cm−1 at 0.4 mA cm−1 and could be further enhanced by increasing the mass loading of V6O13 in VCFs. The reversible Zn2+ storage/release was evidenced by the appearance of pronounced Zn 2p peaks at 1021.3 eV (2p3/2) and 1044.1 eV (2p1/2) in the fully discharged VCF, which were not detected in the pristine VCF (Fig. 2c).27,28 These Zn 2p peaks then became weak upon charging, suggesting the extraction of Zn2+ ions from VCF. The in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement further showed an enlarged d-spacing of V6O13 during the discharge (Fig. S15†), which indicated the large accommodation of Zn2+ in the layer-structured V6O13 and so as the high discharge capacity.29,30 An insertion of up to ∼3.49 Zn per unit formula of V6O13 was determined in a fully discharged VCF, i.e., Zn3.49V6O13 (Fig. S16†). Moreover, VCF showed high rate capability (Fig. 2d) with a specific energy up to ∼230 W h kg−1, outperforming the previously reported aqueous battery fibers (Fig. 2e).31–35 The capacity could immediately recover with the reversal of the applied current density from 5 to 0.2 A g−1 for over 60 cycles (Fig. 2f). Such facilitated kinetics in VCFs was attributed to a high surface-controlled capacity contribution36–38 of up to 93.4% from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies (Fig. S17†). With the above-mentioned merits, the VCF/Zn fiber could maintain a capacity of ∼310 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 over 500 cycles (Fig. 2g), or a capacity of ∼151 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 over 5000 cycles (Fig. S18†). Moreover, the flexible fiber-shaped configuration rendered the VCF/Zn battery with high durability, enabling a well-maintained output under increasing bending angles from 0 to 180° (Fig. S19†). Even after 1000 cycles of bending (Fig. 4h) and twisting (Fig. S20†), the battery fibers retained over 90% of the original capacity.

The air-recharging capability was determined to stem from the spontaneous oxidation of the discharged VCF upon its exposure to O2 (Fig. 3a). In the routine galvanostatic charging process driven by electrical grid (schematic in Fig. S21†), electrons are released from the discharged (reduced) cathode, leading to oxidized vanadium in the cathode along with extracted Zn2+ from the layered structure.21,39 Alternatively, we discovered that the discharged VCF (e.g., Zn3.49V6O13) with low-valence-state vanadium could be spontaneously oxidized by O2 in air to its charged state (Zn3.49−xV6O13) with the release of Zn2+ for the charge balance (Fig. 3a). Along this line, the fully discharged product could recover to its charged state without any external power supply in the VCF/Zn battery fibers. This spontaneous oxidation reaction could be theoretically explained by the redox potential difference between the discharged VCF (low to −0.24 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) and the oxygen dissolved in the aqueous mildly acidic electrolyte (∼1.23 V versus standard hydrogen electrode) obtained from the cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 3b).40 Considering the acidic condition in the 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte, the existing H+ ions would induce the reduction of dissolved O2 to H2O. Moreover, the discharged VCF (Zn3.49V6O13) would be oxidized by O2 with the release of Zn2+ ions (details in Note S3†). Experimentally, this air-recharging process was first discovered from an increasing open-circuit voltage (OCV) attributed to the gradually deeper oxidation (Fig. 3b) in a fully discharged VCF/Zn battery with exposure to O2. Note that the above air-recharging reaction would not take place in the absence of O2, i.e., the VCF/Zn battery fiber delivered limited OCV (<0.6 V) and capacity recovery (<5 mA h g−1) after exposure to an O2-eliminated condition for 20 h (Fig. S22†).

(d) In situ X-ray diffraction patterns of the discharged VCF at various air-recharging states. (e) In situ X-ray diffraction patterns of VCF during the galvanostatic discharge (100 mA g−1) and the sequent air-recharging process. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further used to elucidate the air-recharging reaction of the fully discharged VCFs in 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte with dissolved O2 (Fig. 3c). With the increasing air-recharging time from 0 (fully discharged VCF) to 30 h, V 2p peaks were found to be gradually shifted to higher binding energy, suggesting the oxidation of V elements in the discharged VCFs. This oxidation was accompanied by the extraction of Zn2+ ions from the layered structure in the discharged VCFs, as revealed by a decreased Zn/V elemental ratio from the transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry analysis (Fig. S23†). Moreover, the in situ X-ray diffraction measurement showed that the pronounced peak at ∼25° (Fig. 3d), attributed to the (1 0 0) plane of V6O13, gradually shifted to a larger angle at first and then remained almost unchanged.29,30 This peak shift indicated a gradually decreased d-spacing, and further implied an exceptional deintercalation of Zn2+ ions from VCFs in the air-recharging process (Fig. 3e). This air-recharging reaction via Zn2+ deintercalation, and not via conversion as in previous active redox materials, may act as a reversal of the galvanostatic discharging process to afford sustained self-charging capability.
The one-dimensional porous structure of VCF was appreciated as a crucial merit conducive to the maximized exposure to the dissolved O2. Indicated by rhodamine in the aqueous electrolyte, signals at different depths revealed that VCF was fully infiltrated with the electrolyte, as shown in the three-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy image (Fig. 4a). This sufficient contact between VCF and the aqueous electrolyte allowed accessible O2 dissolution for the oxidation of unsealed VCF. Galvanostatic discharge profiles were then measured for the electrochemical evaluation of air-recharged VCF (e.g., Zn3.49−xV6O13). The air-recharging process afforded an increasing discharge capacity of up to 191 mA h g−1 upon the extension of the oxidation time for the first 25 h (Fig. 4b). The open-circuit voltage of VCFs accordingly increased (Fig. S24†) due to the deeper oxidation of Zn3.49−xV6O13. Further the extension of the air-recharging time (>25 h) would contribute little to the discharge capacity because the redox potential difference would gradually decrease until it is unable to drive the extraction of Zn2+ (details in Note S3†).

Scale bar, 200 μm in (a). 
The air-charging process was reversible, as revealed by the highly overlapped discharge curves recorded from the repeated air-charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles (Fig. 4c). When the air-recharging time was prolonged from 10 to 20 h and then reverted to 10 h, the discharge capacity could accordingly increase from 79 to 145 mA h g−1 and then recovered to 76 mA h g−1 (Fig. S25†). Furthermore, the air-recharging reaction of the VCF/Zn battery fiber was compatible with the routine galvanostatic charge–discharge. This was evidenced by the well-maintained discharging capacity upon the recurring alternative operation of air-recharging (20 h)/galvanostatic discharging (at 100 mA g−1) and galvanostatic charging/discharging (at 1 A g−1) processes (Fig. 4d and S26†). During the cycles, the ohmic resistance and the charge transfer resistance of VCFs remained almost unchanged upon repeated alternative operation processes (Fig. S27†). This implied the surface stability of VCFs upon the air-recharging process (Fig. S28†) as well as its compatibility with the routine charge–discharge. In addition, the air-recharged battery fiber could be further galvanostatically charged to its fully charged state (1.5 V) when the electrical power supply is available (Fig. S29†). Therefore, the air-recharging function could serve as a promising backup power supply for the VCF/Zn battery fiber, enhancing its applicability towards wearable electronic applications.
From the device aspect, the air-recharging process of the VCF/Zn battery fiber was designed to be triggered by removing the impermeable encapsulation and diffusing air (O2). Specifically, a double-layer tubular encapsulation was customized for the air-rechargeable VCF/Zn battery fiber (Fig. 5a). The removable outer layer was composed of impermeable poly(vinyl ether) and O2-permeable low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was selected as the inner tubular encapsulation. In routine galvanostatic charge–discharge processes, the VCF/Zn battery fiber was protected by the double-layer tubular encapsulation without air permeability. Once the VCF/Zn battery fiber was exhausted, the air-recharging process could be initiated by the removal of the outer poly(vinyl ether) tube (in yellow). In this paradigm, the battery fiber was encapsulated by a single-layer of LDPE. Due to its nonpolar molecular structure, the flexible LDPE tube afforded a high selectivity for O2 (∼40 barrier for O2 permeability) to enable the spontaneous oxidation reaction, meanwhile preventing electrolyte volatilization and moisture erosion (<0.9 g m−2 d−1 for H2O permeability).41 Thus, the continuous O2 diffusion could be permitted into the aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte and then react with the discharged VCF (e.g., Zn3.49V6O13) for capacity recovery.

(e) A strain sensor fiber was powered by VCF/Zn battery fibers integrated in a flexible fingertip. (f) Current–time curve of the strain sensor fiber upon the increasing bending cycle. 
To visualize the feasibility of this air-recharging capability, two aqueous VCF/Zn battery fibers were connected in series to power a thermometer. After their exhaustion (Fig. 5b), the battery fibers were unsealed in the ambient air for several hours and then they could be recharged to repower the thermometer (Fig. 5c). Impressively, leaving the air-recharged battery fiber in varying practical scenarios, e.g., upon deformations and all-weather conditions for hours did not show any significant voltage loss (Fig. 5d). The flexible fiber-shaped configuration also made it favorable for convenient integration with other functional modules that could fit into the irregular surface of human body. As a proof-of-concept, the VCF/Zn battery fibers were integrated with a strain sensor into a wearable fingertip (Fig. 5e). During the repeated curving of the finger, the strain sensor fiber could make immediate response (Fig. 5f), demonstrating the feasibility of this air-recharged battery fiber towards self-powering wearable systems.
Conclusions
In summary, a high-performance aqueous Zn-ion battery fiber with air-recharging capability is achieved by synthesizing a V6O13/CNT cathode fiber through a facile solution-redox method. This rationally-designed VCF has overcome the canonical tradeoff between the self-charging activity and high specific capacity in self-rechargeable electrode materials. A configuration-based solution is further presented to enable stable and reversible operation of the flexible, air-rechargeable battery fiber by inhibiting the electrolyte volatilization and ambient erosions. The resultant VCF/Zn battery fiber shows a high gravimetric capacity of 371 mA h g−1, long cyclability up to 5000 cycles, and could be efficiently recharged to ∼60% with an open-circuit voltage of ∼1.1 V in ambient air. This study provides a new strategy to realize the self-powering functionality at material-level within simplified, flexible device configuration, contributing to the advancement of wearable electronic systems.
Experimental section
Synthesis of the V6O13/CNT electrode fiber (VCF)
A two-step, solution-redox-based approach was adopted for the synthesis of freestanding VCFs. In step 1, α-MnO2 nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto aligned CNT fibers in a three-electrode mode with a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electrodeposition was performed under a pulse electrodeposition mode (1.5 V for 1 s and 0.7 V for 10 s) in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Mn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. In step 2, the as-prepared MnO2/CNT fiber was soaked in an aqueous VOSO4 solution (0.1 mol L−1) overnight at room temperature. A layer of V6O13 in faint blue could be observed on the surface of aligned CNT fibers after soaking. The obtained V6O13/CNT fiber was then thoroughly washed with deionized water to remove the remnant impurities (e.g., Mn2+ and MnO2) and then allowed to be dried in air. The formation of nanostructured V6O13 was driven by the difference of redox potentials between MnO2/Mn2+ and VO2+/VO2+.26 The normalized mass loading of V6O13 in VCFs was measured to be ∼1 mg cm−1 by an electronic macro-balance (BT25S, 0.0001 mg).
Fabrication and modification of the Zn anode
A facile electroplating method in a two-electrode mode was used to fabricate the Zn anode on aligned CNT fibers. The Zn electrodeposition was performed at −0.8 V versus Zn foil (purity of >99.9%, serving as both counter and reference electrodes) for ∼1000 s in an aqueous solution containing 1 mol L−1 ZnSO4 and 1 mol L−1 KCl. The Zn-coated CNT fibers were then washed with deionized water and then allowed to be dried at room temperature in vacuum for ∼5 h before use. A dispersion of 1:5 polyvinylidene fluoride/nano-CaCO3 (weight) in an N-methyl pyrrolidone solvent was prepared and then uniformly coated onto the Zn-deposited CNT anode fibers to form a porous separating layer42 after drying. The as-modified Zn anode fiber was accessible to the electrolyte and would not result in short circuits when assembled with VCF to produce the full battery fiber.
Fabrication of the air-recharging VCF/Zn battery fiber
The fiber-shaped VCF/Zn battery was assembled using VCF as a cathode and the Zn-deposited CNT fiber as the anode. The two electrode fibers soaked with 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte were first encased in an O2 permeable LDPE tube and sealed with ultraviolet curing adhesive at two ends. The as-fabricated battery fiber was further encapsulated by another removeable layer of a heat-shrinkable poly(vinyl ether) tube to eliminate the influence from ambient conditions on galvanostatic charge–discharge processes.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical tests were conducted on an Arbin multichannel electrochemical testing system (MSTAT-10 V, 10 mA, 32 channels). 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte was used with a controlled dosage of ∼40 μL. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a CHI 660E electrochemical station at 0.1–1.0 mV s−1versus Zn/Zn2+. The electrochemical impedance measurement was conducted from 10 mHz to 1 MHz with a voltage amplitude of 5 mV. The applied current densities and specific capacity in the galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were calculated based on the mass of as-synthesized V6O13 in VCF.
Characterizations
The structure and morphology of VCF, aligned CNT fibers and the Zn-deposited anode fiber were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss FE-SEM Ultra 55 operated at 3 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F operated at 200 kV). Raman analysis was conducted on a Raman spectrometer (Dilor LabRam-1B, He–Ne laser of 4 mW, excitation wavelength of 532 nm). Ex situ XRD analysis was conducted on an X-ray power diffractometer (Bruker AXSD8) with filtered Cu Kα radiation. In situ XRD measurements were conducted using customized cells with a Be window on the surface for X-ray penetration. X-ray photoelectron spectra was recorded on a PHI5300 system (Mg, 250 W, 14 kV). A 3D laser confocal microscope image was recorded from Nikon C2+. Photographs were captured by a camera (SONY A6000, Japan).
