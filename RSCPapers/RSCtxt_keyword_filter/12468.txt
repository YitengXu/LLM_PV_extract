, Accepted 14th August 2014First published on 15th August 2014AbstractTwo tetradodeoxyphenyl-substituted indacenodithiophene (IDT) based polymers, PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT, were achieved by copolymerizing IDT with terthiophene (3T) or di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole (DTBT). Although these two polymers show significantly different UV-vis absorption spectra and band gaps (2.08 eV and 1.75 eV), the HOMO levels (−5.35 eV and −5.30 eV) of these polymers are almost the same. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on polymers with the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit show relatively high short-circuit current density (Jsc) due to the relatively wide and high photo-electronic response and high hole mobility. Thanks to the four long aryl side chains on IDT, the polymer thin film shows an amorphous nature, and the AFM root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of the polymer/PCBM blend film is only around 0.3 nm which can contribute to the homogenous bulk heterojunction structures without significant phase separation. Finally, decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.52% is achieved by the benzothiadiazole based polymer and PC71BM composite. By comparison study, we demonstrate why BT is an excellent acceptor unit for indacenodithiophene-based PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted increasing interest due to their potential for fabrication of light-weight, large-area, and flexible light-harvesting devices through low-cost solution processing.1–7 With prolonged effort, the PCE of PSCs has already exceeded 10%.8 PSCs usually adopt a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, where a photoactive layer consists of an interpenetrating network of π-conjugated polymer donors and soluble fullerene or nanocrystal acceptors.9 Because donor polymer can harvest most of the solar energy, more efforts have been focused on developing conjugated polymers with small band gap and proper energy levels that can be used as a donor material to complement fullerene-based acceptors.10–14
Among different donor materials, indaxenodithiophene (IDT) based conjugated polymers have attracted much attention in optoelectronic devices.15–17 In IDT, the rigid ring unit could enhance both the degree of conjugation18 and the co-planarity of the molecular backbones. A series of polymers based on IDT, BT and thiophene have been synthesized (Scheme 1).16,19–24 The highest PCE reached 7% based the corresponding PSCs.25 Jen et al. studied several high performance D–A polymers based on IDT and different acceptor units.26–29 The IDT-based polymers have presented pretty high mobility and the appropriate optical properties, which can facilitate the charge transport simultaneously enhance the absorption of sunlight and subsequently lead to high Jsc of PSCs devices.30 Therefore, both thiophene and BT are promising building blocks for IDT-based polymers. Among these materials, IDT and di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) based high performance polymer solar cells showed PCE up to 6%.24 In general, the strategy to improve the PCE of solar cells devices is to adjust band gap of polymers.31,32 Low band gap could enhance the absorption at long wavelengths. However, usually lowering the band gap will lead to the change of the HOMO level, which could reduce Voc of the devices. Increasing Jsc and keeping high Voc is a contradiction, but IDT and di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) based polymer solar cells can show high Jsc resulting from wide absorption and acceptable Voc resulting from deep HOMO energy level.24
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of IDT-based polymers. 
Typically, the side chain of IDT based polymer was hexyl, and molecular weights (Mn) of polymers (Scheme 1) were exhibited to be in the range of 15–25 K.16,19–24 Longer side chains on the donor can produce better solubility of the polymer and intermediate oligomers, which may potentially lead to higher molecular weight.33 On the other hand, long side chains could reduce the tendency for crystallization to help to obtain the complete noncrystalline materials, which could avoid considering that crystallinity impacts on spectral red shift and mobility in polymer solar cells study. Especially in chemical structure comparison study, long sided chained polymer is favorite.
Here, we synthesized a new tetra-dodeoxyphenyl long chain substituented indacenodithiophene (IDT) derivative and used it as a building unit for polymers. Two IDT-based copolymers PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT (Scheme 2) with different building blocks were prepared by Stille polycondensation, and their thermal, optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. Thanks to the long dodecyl chain, PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT showed high molecular weights (Table 1). Especially, PIDT3T showed one of the highest molecular weights of 61.7 K in IDT based polymers. Compared with PIDT3T polymer, the benzothiadiazole unit in PIDTDTBT polymer was introduced to lower the band gap and increase the absorption. Fortunately, the introduction of BT could lower the band gap and increase Jsc effectively, while the HOMO level did not changed. Thanks to the amorphous nature of these polymers, the comparison of two polymers is completely due to difference of the thiophene and the BT in the middle of other units. In this paper, by comparison study we demonstrate why BT is an excellent acceptor unit for indacenodithiophene-based PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes of the monomer (IDT) and the copolymer are depicted in Scheme 3. The synthesis of the indaxenodithiophene (IDT) was generally based on the previous literature.34 The TMS groups on compound 1 (Scheme 3) were introduced to facilitate the later intramolecular cyclization reactions. Two polymers, PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT, were synthesized by using palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling copolymerization of IDT with 3T and DTBT.35 The structures of two polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Both polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene, due to the four dodeoxyphenyl side chains in the IDT repeat unit. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluant and polystyrenes as the internal standards, and the results were listed in Table 1. The Mn of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT are 61.7 K and 35.1 K, respectively. Molecular weights of the copolymers are relatively high, probably due to the good solubility of IDT monomer with long side chains.

2.2. Thermal analysis
The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown Fig. 1. DSC thermogram didn't show apparent thermal transitions for PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT polymer, implying their amorphous nature. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperature with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT are 374 °C and 422 °C, respectively. DTBT unit has higher thermal stability than 3T unit,36,37 which results in higher thermal stability of PIDTDTBT polymer. This indicates that the thermal stability of the polymers is good enough for PSCs applications.

2.3. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT in chloroform solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 2, respectively, and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 2. PIDT3T exhibited one absorption band due to the π–π* transition with the absorption maximum at 516 nm. PIDTDTBT exhibited two absorption bands due to the π–π* transition and the intramolecular charge transfer with the absorption maximum at 450 nm and 606 nm in chloroform solution. In the thin film, both polymers exhibit a red-shift in the absorption maximum and onset, which is attributed to solid state packing effects. Compared the absorption in thin film with that in solution, PIDTDTBT polymer exhibits a greater red-shift compared to PIDT3T, which is attributed to more effective π–π stacking.38,39 PIDTDTBT polymer shows more planar polymer structure and packs better than PIDT3T. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT were estimated to be 2.08 eV and 1.75 eV according to Eoptg = 1240/λ. Due to the introduction of BT unit, the band gap of PIDTDTBT was obviously lowered compared with PIDT3T. The lower band gap of PIDTDTBT should be beneficial to its application as donor material in PSCs.

2.4. Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed for determining the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the conjugated polymers.40 Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) properties of the polymers. A three electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode has been used. The potentials were internally calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is found to be 0.43 V vs. SCE. According to the empirical equation,HOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) (eV)LUMO = −(Ere + 4.4) (eV)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT. 
The results of the electrochemical properties are listed in Table 2. Compared with PIDT3T, the LUMO energy levels of PIDTDTBT decreased significantly due to the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor unit, but the HOMO energy levels of the polymer changed little, which is possibly due to similar oxidation potential of 3T and DTBT. These two polymers show deep HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV), which is desirable for good stability in the air and high open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.
2.5. Photovoltaic properties
To investigate and compare the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, bulk heterojunction PSCs devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al were fabricated by the method of solution processing as our previous work.41–43 And then, we further optimized the device performances using PC71BM acceptor with device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM(1:3)/Ca/Al. Fig. 4 exhibits the J–V curves of the PSCs under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Table 3 summarized the detailed device performances. Finally, the best solar cell obtained from PIDT3T:PC71BM (1:3) showed a PCE of 3.26% with an Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 7.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 51.93% and PIDTDTBT showed a PCE of 4.52% with an Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 9.85 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.26% at the same condition. The Voc of two polymers based PSCs devices was almost the same due to the similar HOMO level. Compared to the PIDT3T, PIDTDTBT showed higher Jsc value, which may be originated from the relatively lower band gap and stronger π–π stacking interaction. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on PIDT3T:PC71BM and PIDTDTBT:PC71BM (1:3) are shown in Fig. 5. The EQE value of PIDTDTBT is higher than that of PIDT3T in most parts of spectra (320–700 nm) and the maximum value reaches 61%. It indicates that PIDTDTBT has good photo response among the absorption range. The calculated current density from the EQE measurement were 7.66 and 9.74 mA cm−2, respectively for PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT, which agree well with the Jsc (7.75 mA cm−2 for PIDT3T and 9.85 mA cm−2 for PIDTDTBT) obtained from the J–V measurements.

Mobility measurements via space charge limited current (SCLC) method40 disclose a hole mobility of 2.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PIDTDTBT:PC71BM device, higher than that of the PIDT3T:PC71BM device (1.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. 6). This could be a potential reason that PIDTDTBT:PC71BM device exhibits larger Jsc and FF than PIDT3T:PC71BM device.
2.6. Morphological characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology of the two polymers: PC71BM blend films annealed at 150 °C. The height images and phase images of the blends are shown in Fig. 7. The blend films of PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT with PC71BM showed surface roughness with root-mean-square (RMS) of 0.343 nm and 0.328 nm, respectively. Although with a smooth surface morphology of the active layer, the device based on PIDT3T has a lower Jsc value than PIDTDTBT which can be attributed to its lower EQE value. The crystallinity of the polymer films was investigated using XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 8. There are no peaks observed for these polymers in XRD test, indicating their amorphous nature.

3. Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized two indacenodithiophene-based polymers PIDT3T and PIDTDTBT. Thanks to the long side chain, the polymers show high (up to 60 K) molecule weight with narrow PDI and amorphous nature (no crystallization). Although these two polymers show significantly different UV-vis absorption spectrum and band gap (2.08 eV and 1.75 eV), the HOMO levels (−5.35 eV and −5.30 eV) are almost the same. PSCs based on these two materials show almost the same Voc (around 0.8 V) due to the same HOMO level. PSCs based on PIDTDTBT with benzothiadiazole unit show relatively high Jsc and FF due to the relatively wide and high photo-electronic response and high hole mobility. Our comparison study shows that BT is a good acceptor unit in IDT polymer backbone which does broad absorption to increase Jsc of PSCs devices without lowering Voc of the device due to proper HOMO levels.

4.2. Instruments and measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were taken on a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 Spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (MS) were recorded under APCI mode on a Bruker Maxis UHRTOF spectrometer. All GPC analyses were made using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as eluant and polystyrene standard as reference. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectrum was measured with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. The organic molecule films on quartz used for absorption spectral measurement were prepared by spin-coating their chloroform solutions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. Surface roughness and morphology of thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400 working at the tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance.
4.3. Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic bath in acetone, toluene, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. And then, oxygen plasma treatment was made for 20 min, spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm, and dried under argon for 20 min at 120 °C. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of the polymers and PC61BM (PC71BM) with a weight ratio of 1:3 in deoxygenated anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene at 2000 rpm on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a glove box. The thickness of active layer films measured by a Dektak 150 profilometer is around 100 nm. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were thermally evaporated at a vacuum of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa on top of active layer. The photovoltaic performance was measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G irradiation using a Xe arc lamp in an argon atmosphere (<0.1 ppm H2O and O2), and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves was obtained by Keithley 2400. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained by a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system.
