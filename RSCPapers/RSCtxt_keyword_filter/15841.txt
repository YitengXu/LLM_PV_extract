    , Accepted 27th June 2017First published on 28th June 2017AbstractChanging N-substituents to modify energy gaps is important for the diverse applications (photochromism, photocatalysis, etc.) of viologen-based compounds. In situ N-substitution using alcohols under solvothermal and acidic conditions is an effective and common synthetic method for viologen-templated metal halides. In this work, we found that replacing alcohols with alkenes could reduce the reaction temperature dramatically to room temperature. A new cis/trans-viologen-templated bromoplumbate with a novel 1-D chain structure built by edge-sharing planar [Pb3Br9]3− oligomers was successfully obtained. This bromoplumbate hybrid has a narrower energy gap compared with bulk PbBr2, which has been well explained by linear optical response spectra calculations and PDOS analysis.
Viologens, namely N,N′-disubstituted-bipyridinium (V2+) salts, have been widely researched in photochemistry, electrochemistry, biochemistry, synthetic chemistry, and supramolecular chemistry.1–4 They have been used not only as electron acceptors designed for electrochromic or photochromic smart materials,3,5–7 but also as electron relays designed for solar energy conversion,8,9 flow batteries,10,11 and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.12,13 For these applications, energy gaps (Eg) of viologens are fundamental and vital parameters. For instance, to improve the power conversion efficiency in solar cells, a narrower Eg and broad absorption are highly required.14
One common strategy to modify Eg of viologens is to change the N-substituents.15–19 Inorganic–organic hybrid haloplumbates have attracted considerable attention of material scientists due to the fascinating features of their novel electrical and optical properties.20,21 For example, haloplumbate perovskites show promising applications such as in solar cells20 and light emitting diodes (LEDs).21 Recently, in situ N-substitution using 4,4′-bipyridine, alcohols, and inorganic acids as precursors under solvothermal conditions became an effective synthetic method for viologen-templated lead or bismuth halides.3,22–26 On one side, this route makes the synthesis of viologen-based hybrid materials less toxic and more convenient.22 On the other side, novel viologen compounds may be obtained, which cannot directly be synthesized using viologen precursors. Nevertheless, reaction active groups of N-alkylation reagents were limited to hydroxyl. This limits the selection of N-alkylation reagents. In addition, this route was realized at high temperature.22–26 In this work, we synthesized a new viologen-templated bromoplumbate (lead bromide), {(H2CV)3[Pb6Br18]·2H2O}n (1; H2CV = 1,1′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-4,4′-bipyridimium-1,1′-diium), and found that the reaction temperature was dramatically reduced from 120 °C to room temperature (RT) when acrylic acid instead of 3-hydroxypropionic acid was used as a precursor (Scheme 1). Compound 1 has a novel cis/trans-viologen-templated 1-D chain structure built by edge-sharing planar [Pb3Br9]3− oligomers and displays an Eg narrowing characteristic compared with bulk PbBr2.
 Scheme 1  
In situ synthesis of an N-carboxylic acid viologen by two reaction pathways. Molecular structures of cis-[H2CV]2+ and trans-[H2CV]2+ are drawn with 30% thermal probability ellipsoids (C, gray; N, blue; O, red; H, green), and only the carboxylic hydrogen atoms are shown for clarity. 
As shown in Scheme 1, compound 1 can be obtained by a hydrothermal reaction of PbBr2, 4,4′-bipyridine, acrylic acid and HBr (40% v/v). In this reaction, the olefinic bond of acrylic acid acted as a reaction–activity group. This reaction can occur at 120 °C or room temperature (RT). In contrast, the reaction cannot occur at RT if 3-hydroxypropionic acid is used as the N-alkylation reagents according to the traditional method.3,22–26 Besides, acrylic acid is much cheaper than 3-hydroxypropionic acid (see supplier item price report in Table S2†). It means that the new in situ synthetic method using acrylic acid instead of 3-hydroxypropionic acid as a precursor is not only mild but also economical.
The crystal structure of 1 consists of two types of [H2CV]2+ cations, infinite [Pb3Br9]n3n− chains, and lattice H2O molecules. As depicted in Fig. 1a, two kinds of [H2CV]2+ isomers, namely cis- and trans-[H2CV]2+ (cis/trans-isomers based on original olefinic bonds; the positions were marked as arrows in Scheme 1), self-assemble to form a zigzag trimer by the double O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds (O⋯O, ∼2.635 and 2.694 Å; ∠OHO, ∼178.72 and 175.39°) between carboxyl groups. The two terminals of the trimer are connected by hydrogen-bonding to two lattice water molecules (O⋯O, ∼2.703 Å; ∠OHO, ∼170.43°), and finally a zigzag-like five-molecule hydrogen-bonding unit was formed.

As shown in Fig. 1b and c, a planar edge-sharing oligomer stacking anionic 1-D chain [Pb3Br9]n3n− is formed with the zigzag-like five-molecule hydrogen-bonding unit as a template. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the chain can be viewed as being built by the stacks of [Pb3Br14] building blocks, which consist of three edge-sharing Pb1, Pb2 and Pb3-centered distorted octahedra. Such a building block connects with its symmetry-related unit through edge sharing to form a haxamer pseudoplane. Such planes stack each other through eight Pb–Br bonds to form a zigzag-like chain extending along the a direction. A convenient diagrammatic representation of the stacking patterns observed for these planar edge-sharing stacking haloplumbates has been developed, as well as a shorthand notation to specify the repeat pattern in the stacks.27,28Fig. 1b shows the envelope stacking pattern diagram and Geiser notation, 6(5/2,1/2), for the 1-D chain.29 Although the stacking patterns of organically modified varied 1-D haloplumbates, in which the stack planes include dimers, trimers, tetramers and hexamers, can be found in the CCDC database, this stacking pattern of chains represents a new type of hexamer.30
The dehydration process of 1 occurred around 100 °C based on a thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S1†), but powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Fig. S2†) show that the crystal structure is thermally stable up to at least 150 °C. This means that the contribution of lattice H2O to the stability of the framework is quite tiny.
The electronic absorption spectra of 1 and PbBr2 have been measured by the diffuse reflection experiment, and the results are depicted in Fig. 2a. The absorption edge for 1 is at about 2.4 eV, which shows a 0.9 eV red shift compared to that of PbBr2. However, some studies reported about the blue-shifting of the absorption spectra of organic–inorganic hybrid materials which were due to quantum confinement effects (QCE) and dielectric enhancement effects, and the excitons were tightly confined in the inorganic well layers in these hybrid materials.31–33 Here, the red shift of 1 suggested that the introduction of viologen cations into the parent PbBr2 may increase the activities of electrons of the charge transfer effect.16,26,34–37 To evaluate and assign these observed spectra, we examine the linear optical response spectra of 1 and the parent PbBr2. The calculated imaginary ε2(ω) part of the frequency-dependent dielectric functions displayed in Fig. 2b can be used to describe the real transitions between the occupied and unoccupied bands.38,39 As noted from the dispersions of ε2(ω) spectra, the first feature absorption peak is at about 2.8 eV for 1. The value is similar to that of the observed spectra located at about 2.8 eV. In terms of PDOS analyses (Fig. 2c), the valence bands close to the Fermi level are mainly dominated by Br 4p and Pb 6s atomic orbitals, while the bottom of the conduction bands is mostly dominated by p−π* anti-bonding orbitals of H2CV2+ for 1. Accordingly, the first absorption is assigned to the charge transfer between the top of the valence band of an inorganic bromoplumbate moiety and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of organic H2CV2+. The observed stronger second absorption peak located at about 3.8 eV is attributed to the charge transfer between bromoplumbate inorganic skeletons. With the above analysis, the red shift arises from the charge transfer between an inorganic skeleton and H2CV2+ because the LUMO of H2CV2+ is just located in the middle of the empty band of parent PbBr2.

To design and modify various Eg viologens for different requirements is very meaningful.4,40,41 The above result suggests that it is possible to tune the Eg of hybrid materials by selecting organic ligands with different LUMO energies, which regulates the energy levels of the bottom of the conduction band. We then performed the density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level using the optimized geometries of the H2CV2+, pyridine (py) and its derivatives: H(py)+, M(py)+, HP(py)+, Bpy, H2(Bpy)2+, MV2+. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the LUMOs of H2(Bpy)2+, MV2+ and H2CV2+ are located at similar energy levels, indicating that they possess a fairly similar electron affinity. The general trend is that more delocalized p–π* orbitals or more positive charges result in lower lying LUMOs. Meanwhile, those with electron-donating groups give rise to high-lying LUMOs.

In summary, we have developed a new in situ synthesis strategy for viologens, which is much milder than the traditional solvothermal method. With this method, a new bromoplumbate hybrid with a 1-D chain structure built by novel planar edge-sharing [Pb3Br9]3− oligomers was prepared. This viologen-based compound shows a large redshift of an energy gap compared with PbBr2, which was well explained by linear optical response spectra calculations and PDOS analysis. It is proposed that organic templates with more delocalized electron orbitals or more positive charges result in low-lying LUMOs. The results may guide the design and synthesis of hybrid materials with different energy gaps by selecting viologens with different LUMO energies.
