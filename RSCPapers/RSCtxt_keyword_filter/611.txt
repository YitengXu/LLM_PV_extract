    , Accepted 30th December 2022First published on 4th January 2023AbstractRecently, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have accomplished the most remarkable progress in emerging photovoltaic technology. However, their poor stability hinders the route to commercialization. Notably, the high chemical activity of halides such as I− and Br− and the formed halide-related vacancy defects lead to the instability of PSCs. In spite of the importance of X-site anions, more and more works have been devoted to the polyatomic pseudohalides and superhalogens in perovskites. In this context, this review will focus on the basic understanding of the structural and photoelectric properties of pseudohalides and superhalogens. We comprehensively summarize the current research progress of SCN−, HCCO−, Ac−, BF4−, BH4−, and PF6− anions to realize high structurally stable perovskites and related solar cells. Based on these observations, some perspectives on future efforts toward achieving highly stable PSCs are proposed and discussed.

1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have driven much interest in the development of photovoltaic devices since they first emerged in 2009.1,2 The hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites act as a classical solar absorber material. Their great merits such as high carrier mobility, high absorption coefficient, low carrier recombination rate, low exciton binding energy, high defect tolerance, and tunable band-gap properties enabled an outstanding performance within a decade.3–6 The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been pushed to 25.7% with superior long-term operational stability.7
In general, the halide perovskite has a ABX3 scaffold, where the A site denotes a monovalent cation (such as CH3NH3+ (MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (FA+), and Cs+), the B site denotes a divalent metal cation (such as Pb2+ and Sn2+), and the X site denotes a monovalent anion (such as I−, Cl−, and Br−).8 The corner-shared [BX6]4− octahedra form a cuboctahedral cavity to accommodate the A site that satisfies the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure. The electronic and optical properties of the halide perovskite show a great relationship to the composition and structural variations. The exploration of the possible range of A-site cations has been widely investigated. The alternative A-site cations to yield the 3D perovskite lattice only are Cs+, FA+, and MA+. Other large organic spacer cations (such as PEA+ (C6H5(CH2)2NH3+), BA+ (CH3(CH2)3NH3+), or EDA2+ ((CH2)2(NH3)22+)) could be incorporated into perovskites to form a low-dimensional structure like the RP (Ruddlesden–Popper) phase with a formula of  or the DJ (Dion–Jacobson) phase with a A′An−1BnX3n+1 framework. However, a preferred vertical orientation of a low-dimensional perovskite is hard to achieve owing to its different quantum well thickness with different n values. The small n-value perovskite is more likely to orient parallel to the substrate, and the high n-value perovskite tends to achieve a vertical orientation.9
In addition, the Pb2+ of the B-site cation has high toxicity, which is very concerning in terms of environmental and human health concerns. Other metal cations with similar electron configurations in the IVA/VA group, such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Sb3+, Bi3+, Ag+, Cu+, and Au+, still show poor performance.10,11 Meanwhile, I−, Cl−, and Br− are the most widely used X-site anions, which react with BX2 to form the ABX3 perovskite materials. However, the halide anion of I− shows high chemical activity and the corresponding I− vacancy defects could form easily. The existing I− vacancy defects have a negative impact on the device stability owing to the unwanted increase in ion conductivity.12 Partial substitution of I− by Br− could tune the band gap and improve the structural stability. As for Cl−, the Cl− incorporation could affect the nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite film, although it is too small to incorporate into a perovskite lattice.13
Other efforts have also been reported to form stable perovskites such as SCN− (thiocyanate), Ac−, HCOO−, BF4− (tetrafluoroborate), and PF6− (hexafluorophosphate).2,14–17 Yan et al. delivered efficient and stable PSCs by using Pb(SCN)2 in a perovskite precursor.18 This SCN−-modulated perovskite film is a high-quality perovskite film with increased grain size. Other studies with the HCCO− anion have also been investigated. Estroff and Abate et al. enabled an excellent coverage and large crystal domains with the use of MAHCOO.19,20 Grätzel et al. used FAHCOO to suppress the anion-vacancy defects and non-radiative recombination in FAPbI3 perovskites.2 The BF4− anion plays a key role in improving charge extraction in the interface and reducing the voltage deficiency.17,21 An appropriate amount of PF6− addition could stabilize the Pb–X–Pb octahedral frame in perovskites, which is beneficial for the less non-radiative recombination and enlarged carrier lifetime.21 Notably, these nonhalides have shown various functions in realizing superiorly stable and high-performance PSCs. However, the effects of anions beyond I−, Cl−, and Br− on perovskites have yet to be fundamentally understood.
In this review, we first describe the basic understanding of the structural and photoelectric properties in nonhalides including pseudohalides and superhalogens. Then we comprehensively summarize the current research progress of SCN−, HCCO−, Ac−, BF4−, BH4−, and PF6− anions to realize highly structurally stable perovskite materials and devices. Their functions in perovskites are systematically summarized, including the strong interaction with perovskites, nucleation and growth, phase stability, efficiency, stability enhancement, and defect passivation. Finally, based on these observations, we propose our perspectives on the future efforts towards achieving highly stable PSCs and devices.
2. Overview of nonhalide anions
To obtain a typical 3D perovskite crystal, the crystallographic stability is determined by Goldschmidt's tolerance criteria (t) and octahedral factor (μ):22 (1) (2)where RA, RB, and RX are the ion radii of A, B, and X site ions. To form a stable perovskite crystal with a 3D framework, the value of t and μ must be in the range of 0.81 < t < 1.11, and 0.44 < μ < 0.90, respectively.23,24
The X-site anions are not limited to the three halides (I−, Cl−, and Br−), alternatively, it can be defined as negative monovalent anions or polyatomic anions with −1 charge. The ion radius shows a decreasing trend: RCl− (181 pm) < RBr− (196 pm) < RI− (220 pm). There are two types of nonhalides in perovskites (Fig. 1a). On the one hand, the stable pseudohalides (e.g. SCN−, Ac−, and HCOO−) have gained much attention. SCN− has a similar ion radius to I− (217 pm for SCN−).25 The linear Lewis structure of SCN− showed stable resonance, rendering a strong Lewis acid-base interaction with Pb2+ or Sn2+ when considering the long pairs of electrons from N and S atoms.26,27 HCOO− has a stronger bonding with FA+ than BF4−, I−, Br−, and Cl− owing to the hydrogen bonding.2 The most deleterious defects of I− vacancies can be eliminated with HCOO−. On the other hand, superhalogens such as BH4−, PF6−, and BF4− have a higher electronegative and electron affinity than halides.28,29 The use of superhalogens greatly enhances the structural stability via partial substitution of halides. Therefore, the recent emergence of pseudohalides or superhalogens can significantly mitigate the defect-related instability in PSCs.

2.1 Pseudohalides
The effective ion radii of polyatomic anions usually satisfy the following criteria:30 (3)It is reliable to apply a general comparison of the relative ion size of the pseudohalides. To satisfy Goldschmidt's tolerance criteria, the range of A-site cations increased with the size of X-site anions (Fig. 1b). The maximum value of spherical X anions is RX = 2.42 RB (μ ≥ 0.414) to stabilize the [BX6]4− octahedral. Therefore, the X-site anions with a size up to 287 pm can form a stable [BX6]4− octahedral, which allows the size of A sites up to 288 pm in lead perovskites. For nonspherical X anions, the effective RX may be greater than 2.42 RB, which depends on how the ligands of the X site coordinate to the B site.30 The pseudohalides mainly contain N3− (azides),31 CN− (cyanides),32 N(CN)2− (dicyanamides),33 SCN−,29 HCOO−, 2Ac−,34 and I3− (triiodides).35 Beside the Pb- and Sn-based perovskites, the perovskite-like lattice can accommodate other B-site cations, such as [(CH3)4N]Mn(N3)3, Ni(NH3)(CN2)·C6H6, [NH3(CH2)7NH3]2Au2I6(I3)2, MAMn(HCOO)3, etc.31,32,35,36 The polyatomic HCOO− anion has a similar size to Br− and a planar structure.
SCN− has been extensively investigated for improving the stability of perovskites. Yan et al. calculated the crystal structure of MAPbIx(SCN)3−x perovskites by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. 1c and d).37 The incorporation of the SCN− group delivered a thermodynamically stable lattice with a pseudo-orthorhombic framework.37 Ganose et al. also verified the thermodynamically stable structure in 2D hybrid perovskites (Fig. 1e and f).38 The 2D MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 layered perovskite has a space group of Pnm21, where the Pb atom octahedrally coordinated to two apical (or trans) S-bonded SCN− anions and four axial I− anions. Meanwhile, the MA+ molecule was sandwiched between the layers, forming an orthorhombic pattern like the K2NiF4 compound. SCN− has a great role in bonding, where the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) is determined by Pb 6p-I 5p and Pb 6p orbitals, respectively (Fig. 1g). There is also a small contribution of S 3p and N 2p in the SCN− in VBM. HCOO− was rarely reported in the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites. Instead, it can coordinate with Mn2+ cations and form a MAMn(HCOO)3 structure. It plays a significant role in eliminating halide vacancy defects and alleviates the adverse ionic conductivity of perovskites (Fig. 1h and i).2
2.2 Superhalogens
Superhalogens have a higher electron affinity than halides, such as BH4−, BF4−, and PF6−.39 Ogale et al. first applied them to solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells as a component of the X site by using MABF4.40 BF4− and PF6− could partially substitute I− to form stable organic–inorganic perovskite superlattices, which provide a large variety of possibility to expand the possible perovskite formulations.41,42 The addition of BF4− in FAPbI3 could enhance the formation energy of FA+-related vacancies to improve the structural stability.42 BF4− has a higher electronegativity than the F−, implying that the bonding between BF4− and its neighboring Pb atom would be more ionic. Li et al. calculated the VBM and CBM of the minimum-energy superlattice structures of (FAPbI3)3/CsPbI2BF4, (MAPbI3)3/CsPbI2BF4, (FAPbI3)3/MAPbI2BF4, and (CsPbI3)3/MAPbI2BF4 (Fig. 2a–d and e–h).43 The charge density in (MAPbI3)3/CsPbI2BF4, (FAPbI3)3/MAPbI2BF4 illustrated that the VBM and CBM states were distinctly separated in space and had no slap. While the charge density of VBM and CBM value in (FAPbI3)3/CsPbI2BF4 and (CsPbI3)3/MAPbI2BF4 had a slight overlap on the Pb atoms and was far away from the CsPbI2BF4 and MAPbI2BF4 layers. They also calculated the layers of FAPbI3, MAPbI3, and CsPbI3 from one to three along the direction of the base vector a. The complete separation of charge density in VBM and CBM states is beneficial to the electrons/holes collection owing to the effective electrons/holes restriction in different atomic layers. Increasing the number of layers could solve the incomplete separation of the charge density of the VBM and CBM states.

For perovskite superlattices, the electrons are distributed in the potential well and holes in the potential barrier. For instance, the superlattice with BF4− is a type-II superlattice.43 The great spatial separation of electrons/holes with superhalogens has a significant effect on carrier transport and collection. In addition, Hendon et al. simulated the crystal structure with VBM and CBM states of CsPbI3−x(PF6)x and CsPbI3−x(BF4)x perovskites as shown in Fig. 2d–p.41 Compared to the octahedral CsPbI3 perovskite (pm3m), CsPb(PF6)3 maintained a cubic lattice by the linear coordination through the axial termini. CsPb(BF4)3 had Cs symmetry with C1m1 space group. The B–F bond in CsPb(BF4)3 was not inline owing to the linear coordination occurring by two edges of the tetrahedron. As for BH4−, it consists of two elements and has one extra electron satisfying the electronic shell closure.44 In addition to the suppression of I− vacancy defects, BH4− has a strong dihydrogen interaction with MA+. The existence of BH4− could substitute the I− anion or compensate for the I− vacancy defects.45,46
3. SCN−
3.1 Acting as an X-site anion in halide perovskites
Bilaji et al. first used a pseudohalide salt of Pb(SCN)2 and Pb(NO3)2 with MAI vapors through a sequential vapor-assisted solution process47 to achieve the ion exchange of SCN− and I−, or NO3− and I−, respectively. Yan et al. used Pb(SCN)2 precursor and prepared a high-quality MAPbI3−xSCNx perovskite film.37 The S and N atoms with long pairs of electrons in SCN− have strong interaction with Pb atoms, which in turn stabilized the frame structure of MAPbI(SCN)2. Jiang et al. compared the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MAPbI3 and MAPbI(SCN)2 (Fig. 3a).48 The characteristic peaks at 14°, 20°, 29°, 32°, and 41° for the MAPbI(SCN)2 film could be indexed to the formed perovskite structure. They designed moisture-tolerance tests via the reflection spectrum in Fig. 3b and c. There is no obvious variation in the film color of the MAPbI(SCN)2 film for 0–1.5 h. Moreover, the black MAPbI(SCN)2 film still maintained the original morphology for months in air with 40% relative humidity. After exposure to air with 95% humidity, the MAPbI(SCN)2 remained the stable perovskite structure with an Eg of 1.532 eV. The resulting PSC device with MAPbI(SCN)2 delivered a PCE of 8.3%. Yan et al. indicated that adding Pb(SCN)2 below 1.0 mmol% did not change the Eg value of FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3 perovskites.49 Lou et al. also illustrated that the pure CsPb(SCN)3 displayed the highest Eg compared with CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskites.50 The up-shifted VBM was responsible for the increase of Eg. The strong interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ (like Pb–S, Pb–N, and Pb–C bonds) lead to a rather high-energy anti-bonding orbital when compared to CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3.

Meanwhile, SCN− has a strong ionic interaction with Sn2+.51 Owing to the π-conjugated electron system, the incorporation of SCN− showed great enhancement in photoelectron transfer.52,53 Diau et al. observed the enhanced structural stability in FASnI3−x(SCN)x perovskites and a maximum was reached in FASnI(SCN)2.52 Indeed, SCN− was deemed as a bridging ligand to construct a stable octahedra framework due to its ambident nucleophilicity. The XRD patterns in Fig. 3d and e showed three main perovskite peaks around 14°, 28°, and 41° in FASnI3−x(SCN)x perovskites. However, the diffraction peaks of FASn(SCN)3 shifted to smaller angles with the increase of lattice spacing. Similar to the other mixed-halide substitution,54 adding SCN− in FASnI3−x(SCN)x films showed a decreased VBM value when increasing x from 0 to 3 (Fig. 3f). Besides, FASnI3−x(SCN)x has enhanced oxidation resistance, which is attributed to the enhanced hydrophobicity and strong interaction with Sn2+.
The 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites exhibit a photoactive triplet state.55 After spin-coating rubrene, a small organic molecule, the obvious triplet energy transfer from (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 to rubrene was observed (Fig. 3g). This phenomenon exhibited unique photophysical behavior with triplet state phosphorescence. Therefore, 2D perovskites with SCN− have great potential in the use of triplet sensitizer. Moreover, 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 shows high thermal stability.56,57 Meng et al. explored the photoelectric properties of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskites.57 The charge transport across the inorganic layers is determined by the quantum tunneling effect. The space between inorganic layers showed negligible contributions to VBM and CBM. It was observed that Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 had a crystal orientation along the [001] direction like (NMA)2PbBr4, (PEA)PbI4, and (PDMA)PbI4. However, the (002) and (004) peaks shifted to larger angles with decreasing size of the cation or anion (Fig. 3i). Meanwhile, the interlayer tunneling probability of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskite reached 0.312, which was ten times higher than those of (NMA)2PbBr4 and (PDMA)PbI4 (Fig. 3j). Large tunneling probability and small interlayer spacing contributed to fast charge transport with high conductivity. Therefore, 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskites have super small interlayer spacing and interlayer nano channels, which will promote the charge transport.
Ning et al. employed PEAI and Sn(SCN)2 to form 2D PEA2Sn2I4−xSCNx perovskites as an intermediate template for the growth of 3D CsSnBrI2−xSCN perovskites.58 This approach enabled the preferred out-of-plane growth of a 2D–3D mixed structure with homogeneous inclusion of SCN− in the 3D CsSnBrI2−xSCN perovskite structure, further contributing to the suppressed defect density and retarded Sn2+ oxidation. The pseudohalide-modulated 2D perovskites also show great potential in tuning the electronic properties of perovskites. Liu et al. adopt the 2D Sn perovskites with pseudohalide to adjust the electronic and excitonic properties.59 The 2D BA2SnI2SCN2 and BA2SnI4 perovskites had the smallest exciton binding energy and effective mass compared with the Pb- and Br-based 2D perovskites. The strong exciton effect in pseudohalide-substituted 2D tin perovskites could enhance PL performance as well as photocurrent when applied in PSCs according to the J–V curve.
3.2 Acting as additives in halide perovskites

3.2.1 Amine-type additives. 
GUASCN (guanidinium thiocyanate). 
The strong binding affinity of SCN− could recover the oxidized sites and coordinate with undercoordinated sites to passivate the defects, which cannot be reached by classical halides.27,60,61 The strong hydrogen bonding between GUA+ and SCN− further contributes to the additional stabilization of perovskites. Pham et al. elucidated the grain growth mechanism with GUASCN:62 MAPbI3 + GUASCN → GUAI (s) + PbI2 (s) + MA (g) + HSCN (g)↑(4)With the surface treatment of GUASCN, the HSCN gas was expelled from the film rapidly and the formed GUAI, PbI2, or the ((GUAI)x(PbI2)y) compound accumulated at GB as a secondary phase. The MA gas enhanced the de-nucleation rate and solubility of unwanted small MAPbI3 crystals, thus facilitating grain coarsening. Zhu et al. proved that adding 7 mol% GUASCN can substantially improve the carrier lifetime up to 1 μs in Sn–Pb perovskite films.14,63 The calculated surface recombination velocity (S) and carrier diffusion coefficient (D) from the transient reflection (TR) spectrum in Fig. 4a and b illustrated that the fitted S increased from 10–100 cm s−1 to 1.0 × 102 cm s−1. GUASCN is a common additive to reduce the pinholes and small grains in hybrid halide perovskites. Zhang et al. claimed that GUASCN could inhibit the 1D solvate intermediate phase and form high-quality quasi-2D films.64 The following reaction revealed the potential mechanism: MAPbI3·DMF + yGUASCN → y/xPbI2−xSCNx + (1 − y/x)PbI2 + MAI + yGUAI + DMF(5)The decomposition products of GUAI and PbI2−xSCNx enlarged the grain size and enhanced the crystalline quality of thin films. The fitted rapid rise time (τ) by ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy in Fig. 4c and d indicated that the perovskite film with GUASCN had faster τ of 4.43 ps, 4.78 ps, and 107.90 ps for n = 3, 4, and 5, respectively, where the control films had τ of 0.15 ps (n = 2), 6.78 ps (n = 3), 8.86 ps (n = 4), and 13.21 ps (n = 5), respectively. Therefore, GUASCN significantly improved the energy/charge transfer efficiency due to a suppressed recombination center and effective energy/charge transfer. A similar approach was also reported in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaics.65 The bidentate nature of SCN− leads to improved electronic coupling in the CQD matrix.2,66,67 GUASCN has nearly zero dipole moment, thus benefiting charge transport. By surface reconstruction, GUASCN played a key role in surface passivation via epitaxial surface bridges with CQD. The oxidized species were eliminated with GUASCN by substituting Pb–O to the Pb–SCN bond (Fig. 4e). The upshifted CN stretch in Fig. 4f proved the surface reconstruction between the SCN− and CQD surface.

NH4SCN. 
The pseudohalide SCN− anion could drive the secondary formation of thin films as the intermediate catalyst, therefore ensuring the composition purity both in the original films and final polycrystals. The SCN− group in NH4SCN was not incorporated into the perovskite lattice in the final-state perovskite films. Jen et al. proposed the recrystallization process with NH4SCN:68 MAPbI3 + SCN− → PbI64− + MA+·SCN− (dipping)(6) MA+·SCN− + NH4+ → MA+ + HSCN (g)↑ + NH3 (g)↑ (annealing)(7) PbI64− + MA+ → MAPbI3(8)Therefore, the undissolved polycrystals could recrystallized and form new MAPbI3 crystal. The SCN− anions in NH4SCN can strongly interact with Pb2+/Sn2+ and the organic cations, where NH4+ cations could interact with [PbI6]4− or [SnI6]4−.68–70 Chou et al. revealed the role of in 2D tin perovskites by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to detect the location of SCN− anions (Fig. 5a and b).71 The positive and negative signals of Sn, I, SCN, and TEA (2-thiophene-ethylammonium) were located at the same region, which indicated the SCN can coordinate with Sn2+. Zhang et al. investigated the NH4SCN concentration in the orientation and crystallinity of 2D (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (Fig. 5c–e).72 The 2D perovskites in the absence of NH4SCN showed random orientation and weak preferential orientation, while the film with 2% SCN− had sharp and discrete Bragg spots and a considerable increase in orientation.

MASCN and FASCN. 
MASCN can significantly reduce the reaction activity via the strong interaction with Sn2+/Pb2+.73–75 For instance, Lian et al. proved that MASCN can retard the reaction between FAI and Sn2+ and also suppress the Sn2+ oxidation.74 Zhang et al. added 5% MASCN into (PA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (PA is n-pentylammonium) perovskite precursor to regulate the phase distribution.75 The TA patterns in Fig. 5f at various delay times indicated that the peaks at 570 nm, 606 nm, 640 nm, 666 nm, and 720 nm attributed to n = 2, n = 3, n =4, n = 5, and 3D-like phases in (PA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 film, respectively. The n = 2 phase disappeared and the 3D-like phase enhanced remarkably in MASCN-modified films (Fig. 5g), further proving that the perovskite film with SCN− obtained a high n-value phase and large grain. Moreover, the improved water contact implied great hydrophobicity of perovskite films in Fig. 5h. The XRD patterns in pseudohalide-induced perovskite films had barely changed 2D phases after storing for 60 days. Different from the previous report, Grätzel et al. used MASCN and FASCN vapor to achieve phase transition and obtain stable black-phase FAPbI3 perovskites.76 The formed corner-sharing Pb–I–SCN structures at the interface could maintain kinetically stable perovskites. The vapor-treated FAPbI3 devices maintained 94.4% PCE of the original value after 500 h testing at the maximum power point (MPP).
PEASCN and TEASCN. 
Compared to pure PEAI treatment, the PEASCN source conformed to a more crystalline film.77 The PEASCN sample can reach a carrier lifetime of over 2 μs and carrier mobility over 40 cm−2 V−1 s−1. Khadka et al. introduced PEASCN into pure FASnI3 perovskites to achieve defect suppression in the bulk and interface.78 These polyatomic pseudohalides delivered a high PCE of 9.65% with a Voc of 667 mV in the corresponding devices. Therefore, the PEASCN not only acts as a 2D additive but also as a crystallization regulator. Ning et al. synthesized a new pseudohalide molecule TEASCN (TEA is 2-thiopheneethylamine) to construct a bilayer quasi-2D structure on the Sn–Pb perovskite surface.79 The TEASCN-introduced films enabled a high n-value (n = 2) phase while the TEAI-introduced films formed a low n-value phase of n = 1.


3.2.2 Metal-type additives. 
KSCN and NaSCN are the most commonly used additives in perovskites.80–84 Zhang et al. used the two additives to improve the microstructure perovskite structure and crystallinity of thin films.18 The NaSCN treatment could suppress the Br− vacancies and decreased the surface defect density, thus further increasing the device stability.82 Besides the effect of SCN−, K+ could also passivate defects. Xu et al. found that KSCN can enlarge perovskite grains to an average diameter of 11 μm.81 This attempt enabled the carrier diffusion length to around 25 μm in slot-die-coated perovskite films. Additionally, Cao et al. used KSCN as an interlayer between PEDOT:PSS and FA0.75MA0.25SnI2Br perovskites to better match the energy alignment and optimize carrier transport in the interface.83 The resulting tin perovskite device delivered a high PCE of over 11% with a Voc of 840 mV. On the one hand, K+ diffused into the lattice and passivate defects in the GB. On the other hand, SCN− anions coordinate with Sn2+ and restrain Sn2+ oxidation.

4. HCOO− and Ac−
Pseudohalides HCOO− and Ac− anions could affect the crystallization and optoelectronic properties of perovskites. Adding a small amount of HCOO− and Ac− anions in precursors could achieve compact surface coverage and improve the crystallinity of perovskite thin films.85 Interestingly, formic acid (FAH) is identified as one of the degradation products of DMF.86 Introducing additional FAH in the precursor enables the reduction of the hydrolysis of DMF. A 70–80 mV increased Voc was achieved with 7.5 vol% FAH. Increasing the acidity would raise the concentration of all solutes and decrease the strength of solvents in the precursor, thus inducing supersaturation and crystal growth.87 Meng et al. observed dense nuclei with the snowflake-like crystal of FAH-induced perovskite film within 3.5 min as shown in Fig. 6a and b.88 The control film showed almost no nucleation after the spin-coating process. Meanwhile, FAH is an ideal redox potential and has no negative effects in nucleation and crystal growth. Liu et al. pointed out the following reactions of FAH effect in precursor:89 HCCO− + 2I0 → 2I− + H+ + CO2 (g)↑(9) HCCO− + I3− → 3I− + H+ + CO2 (g)↑(10)HCOO− in FAH can react with adverse I0 and form I−, H+, and CO2 gas. The generated H+ further inhibited the deprotonation of FA+. In addition, the FAMACs films with 2 mol% FAH showed higher photoluminescence intensity (Fig. 6c) and longer lifetime (Fig. 6d). Han et al. further reported that FAH enhanced the crystallinity of Sn-based perovskites and exhibited high reproducibility and PCE in the corresponding devices.90

Estroff et al. first used MAFA (methylammonium formate), an ionic liquid (IL), in MAPbI3 perovskites.19 In addition to the advantages of HCOO−, the property of ILs also played a key role in film growth due to their outstanding thermal stability.16,91 Abate et al. indicated that the crystallization and growth process with MAFA went through the following steps:20 (i) the coordination of Pb2+ and HCOO− in precursor; (ii) the HCOO-Pb bond replaced by I-Pb bond when annealing at 100 °C; (iii) complete replacement by I-Pb bond and crystal growth. The MAFA was presented at the surface in the final form. By utilizing the pseudohalide anion, Jeong et al. attained a certified PCE of 25.2% and remarkable operational stability over 450 h.2 HCOO− anions showed a strong affinity with Pb2+ and can form a stable bonding network at the Pb2+-terminated surface. As exhibited in Fig. 6e, the highest binding energy with I− vacancies in HCOO− also proved the strong defect passivation of anion vacancies via strong binding affinity.
Similar to HCOO−, volatile Ac− anions also can form an intermediate with perovskite and modulate the crystallization process.34,92 Zhou et al. proposed a novel strategy to suppress adverse I2 to reduce the energy and voltage loss.92 FAAc (formamidine acetate) as a “residual free” weak alkaline can reduce the defect density at a deep level and in particular manipulate the stoichiometry at A sites in perovskite precursors. The characteristic peak of I2 at 360 nm showed a decreased tendency with the increasing amount of FAAc (Fig. 7a). As for the alkalinity, FAAc has a pKa of around 7.64, whereas other alkaline additives such as NaAc (sodium acetate) and NaHCO3 have a pKa of 9.24 and 10.33, respectively. Therefore, a large range of FAAc can regulate the absorbance of I2 (Fig. 7b), which indicated that the weak alkaline had a great potential to regulate the α-phase perovskites on a large scale. Additionally, the volatile Ac− facilitated grain growth with enlarged grain size and film quality. Lv et al. further used MAAc in the Sn–Pb perovskite precursor.93 The strong hydrogen bonding between MAI and MAAc can not only stabilize the perovskite lattice but also increase the viscosity and solubility of the solute in the solution.

PbAc2 as a pseudohalide lead source has also been attempted to improve the perovskite growth and film morphology.15 Compared to PbCl2 and PbI2 as displayed in Fig. 7c, the perovskite film from PbAc2 revealed better crystallinity. The transition process can be described as: PbX2 + 3MAI → MAPbI3 + 2MAX (X = Cl, I, Ac)(11)The thermally unstable MAAc tends to evaporate more rapidly than MACl and MAI under annealing. The nucleation density with PbAc2 was higher than others and the film showed full coverage on the substrate. Meng et al. eliminated the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase by DMAAc (dimethylamine acetate) and stabilized the lattice structure of DMAPbI3.94 As shown in Fig. 7d, after annealing at 140 °C for 1 min, some DMAPbI3 crystalline phase appeared in the absence of the Cs4PbI6 phase. After annealing at 190 °C for 5 s, there was no Cs4PbI6 phase either. Thus, the incorporation of DMAAc can shorten the crystal growth time. When annealing further, the coexisting of DMAPbI2Ac and DMAPbI3 affords a dynamically stable DMAPb(I, Ac)3 as follows: PbI2 + DMAAc → DMAPbI2Ac(12) DMAPbI3 + DMAPbI2Ac → DMAPb(I,Ac)3(13) DMAPb(I,Ac)3 + Cs+ + I− → CaPbI3 + DMA (g)↑ + HAc + HI (g)↑(14)Therefore, DMAAc can accelerate the phase transformation from intermediate to thermally stable CsPbI3 phase. Additionally, Huang et al. achieved a high Voc up to 1.31 V and superior air stability for 4680 h with n-butylamine acetate (BAAc).95 The hydrogen bonding of N–H⋯OC–O− in BAAc has a stronger shielding effect than N–H⋯I− in BAI. The vertically aligned grains can be crystallized from the uniformly distributed intermediate.
5. BF4− and BH4−
An interesting strategy to introduce F− in perovskite with BF4− anion has been investigated.28,96–98 BF4− contributes to large perturbation to the electronic structure. Considering the similar ion radii of I− and BF4−, Han et al. investigated MAPbI3−x(BF4)x perovskites with different BF4− concentrations.28 All MAPbI3−x(BF4)x perovskites had the same tetragonal crystal structure like the MAPbI3 perovskites. The introduction of BF4− leads to an obvious change in frequency-dependent electrical conductivity. In the same vein, Nagane et al. studied the mechanism of BF4− modulation via solid-state NMR (ssNMR) at the atomic level.99 It was reported that BF4− anion was not incorporated into the perovskite lattice, but reacted with MAI like a scavenger. As shown in Fig. 8a, the F− signal of BF4− was located at −147.8 ppm with a broadened signal after mixing equimolar amounts of MAI and MABF4, indicating the formed MAI-MABF4 cocrystal. Additionally, 10 mol% excess MAI was added with BF4−and the F− signal was the characteristic peak of MAI-MABF4 cocrystals. The δ peak at 43.9 ppm in the 11B spectrum had no change in Fig. 8b, further proving that the BF4− was not incorporated into the perovskite lattice.

Additionally, imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (IMBF4) containing imidazolium cation and BF4− anion to passivate the Sn–Pb perovskite was achieved by Kim et al.12 The morphological effect and charge carrier dynamics with IMBF4 verified the role of BF4− in optoelectronic properties. Meanwhile, the functional π-conjugated QAPy+ (1,1′-((7,14-dioxo-7,14-dihydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridine-5,12-diyl)bis(octane-8,1-diyl))bis(pyridin-1-ium)) cooperating with BF4− lead to a higher endothermic decomposition temperature, therefore exhibiting better stability compared to the control PSCs device.97 The QAPyBF4 not only suppressed the defects of organic cation vacancies but also improved the interface contact and the adhesion of the buried interface. A signature PCE of 23.1% and Voc up to 1.2 V was achieved with markedly improved thermal stability by the buried QAPyBF4 interface. To demonstrate the crystallization process with BF4−, Zhang et al. applied (t-Bu)2PMeHBF4 ((t-Bu)2PMeH+ is di-tert-butyl(methyl)phosphonium) and analyzed the free energy in the surface/bulk by classical theory (Fig. 8b and c).100 With the assistance of (t-Bu)2PMeHBF4, the PbI2–(t-Bu)2PMeBF4 intermediate was prenucleated as the nucleation center and greatly reduced the interface energy. Thus, the nuclei of perovskite films can occur at a lower saturation due to the low nucleation barrier, further forming small and contact nuclei during the solvent evaporation process (Fig. 8b). Besides the faster nucleation process in the precursor, a faster crystallization process in the thin films was also observed as shown in the in-situ absorption spectra in Fig. 8d and e. The absorption signal of (t-Bu)2PMeHBF4-modified film reached the peak value 10s earlier than the control film.
Snaith et al. claimed that BMPBF4 (BMP+ is 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium) could suppress the deep trap states significantly.21 To understand the distribution of BMPBF4 in the perovskites, they utilized the nano SIMS (nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry) and analyzed the 19F− and 11B16O2− signals as displayed in Fig. 8f. The 19F− signals were consistent with 11B16O2− signals. F− anions were distributed over the surveyed volume in the perovskite layers to play the role of defect passivation. Snaith et al. also incorporated BMIMBF4 (BMIM+ is 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) into perovskite layers and achieved superior long-term thermal stability both in non-encapsulated and encapsulated devices (Fig. 8g and h).21 The BMIM+ was not only located in the bulk perovskites but also accumulated at the buried interface. However, the BF4− was only located at the buried interface. Both the BMIM+ and BF4− suppressed the ion migration in the perovskite films in return.
Compared to halide anions, BH4− is composed of two elements and needed one extra electron for electronic shell closure.46,103,104 The strong dihydrogen interaction between ionic hydrogen in BH4− and the proton hydrogen in MAI can prevent the decomposition of MAI. BH4− has an ion radius of 202 pm, which is similar to halides and can partially substitute these heavy halides such as I−, Br−, or Cl−.41,46 A stable MAPbIx(BH4)3−x was reported by Xu et al.45 The superhalogen BH4− can release anion vacancies and reduce defects such as halide vacancies or organic cation vacancies by partial substitution of I−. Sanchez-Diaz et al. reported the addition of NaBH4 into Sn perovskites for achieving the oxidation resistance from Sn2+ to Sn4+ during the solution processing, which lead to a PCE of 10.61% with superior operational stability over 1300 h in an N2 atmosphere.105 The FASnI3 perovskite film emerged with a compact and pinhole-free morphology with NaBH4 incorporation. In this respect, this new type of superhalogen anion provides a novel design in complex perovskites.
6. PF6−
For the F-type superhalogen PF6−, it has an ion radius of 225 pm and also can be incorporated into a perovskite lattice.41,106 Tao et al. achieved a PCE of 27.35% in 4T (four terminal) perovskite-Si tandem devices by F-type PF6− with a perovskite framework of FA0.65MA0.20Cs0.15Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3−x(PF6)x.106 When partial substitution of I−/Br− by PF6− occurred, the perovskite showed lattice expansion. Meanwhile, there was a released tensile strain with PF6− addition. Therefore, a high-quality perovskite film formed with strain relaxation, which had a positive effect on charge transport and passivation of defect density. Moreover, Hao et al. adopted BMIMPF6 to enhance the phase stability of CsPbI2Br and delivered a PCE of 16.2% with a Voc of 1.28 V.16 The CsPbI2Br with BMIMPF6 had a lower formation energy than the pure α-CsPbI2Br as shown in Fig. 9a, therefore stabilizing the α-CsPbI2Br perovskite. The average Br-I-Br angle (Fig. 9c and d) with BMIMPF6 increased from 78.1° to 88.3°, thus contributing to the enhanced phase stability of α-CsPbI2Br perovskite by restraining the distortion of [BX6]4− octahedrons. With KPF6-assisted crystallization, Bu et al. achieved a high PCE of 23.35% in MA-free PSCs.107 The interface between perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD was intersected without KPF6 treatment, whereas it had no obvious change after KPF6 treatment as shown in cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 9d and e). Meanwhile, PF6− stayed on the surface and passivated the grain boundaries and the signals of K+ and F− throughout the perovskite films (Fig. 9f). As a result, the device with KPF6 showed negligible ion migration after thermal aging.

7. Conclusions and outlooks
The nonhalides act as emerging candidates for tuning the optoelectronic properties of perovskites and their applications in photovoltaics and beyond. The ambient light and thermal stability were greatly enhanced through this strategy. Meanwhile, they can tune the nucleation and crystal growth process and modulate the film growth process. Their positive effects on morphology, stability, electrical conductivity, carrier density, and charge transport properties provide another perspective for the future selection of the X-site anions. To achieve high-efficiency and stable PSCs with this strategy, more fundamental research studies need to be carried out.
(i) More theoretical and experimental studies should determine whether pseudohalides or superhalogens can be incorporated into a perovskite lattice. The propensity of the position in the bulk perovskite lattice or the interface/surface can offer an in depth understanding of halide management including the halide composition and halide defect regulation.
(ii) Due to the high volatile properties of SCN−, the chemical inhomogeneity by local evaporation may be caused by unusual planar defects like edge dislocation or the bending of interlayers. The development of an elaborate vapor treatment method with SCN− can improve the phase transition and the crystallization kinetics.
(iii) Pseudohalides contribute to enlarged grains and few boundaries with high n-value distribution for low-dimensional perovskites. The role of organic cations in such a system cannot be ignored. On the one hand, functionalized organic cations containing both electron-rich atoms and electron-donating chains show a strong passivation effect on the net positive charge in perovskites. On the other hand, the characteristics of the cationic component should also be investigated.
(iv) The passivation effect of HCOO− and Ac− is mostly reflected in the halide vacancies. Meanwhile, they have a strong interaction with B-site cations to stabilize the perovskite lattice structure. The hydrogen bonding network with organic cations further enables the unique role of HCOO− and Ac− in passivating anion-vacancy defects. Though volatile FAH and HAc have no residues in perovskite films after annealing,85,90 long-term passivation from the precursors to thin films at high temperature is missed. Therefore, ionic liquids can be designed with various functional organic cations with pseudohalide anions in this regard. Their special properties with non-volatility and low toxicity will benefit the realization of efficient and stable PSCs.
(v) The passivation with BF4− or PF6− can mainly be embodied in blocking the invasion of H2O and O2, thereby facilitating moisture stability. Designing the functional hydrophilic groups with BF4− or PF6− to meet the appropriate polarity, conductivity, melting point, viscosity, and chirality is an important issue in the development of more efficient and stable PSCs soon.
