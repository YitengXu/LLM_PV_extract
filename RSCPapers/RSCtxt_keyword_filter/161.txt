    , Accepted 1st August 2021First published on 2nd August 2021AbstractIn the past few years, electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems including rechargeable metal-ion batteries and supercapacitors have received increasing attention because of their wide applications in public wearable and portable consumer electronics, electronic skin, and hybrid electric vehicles. Especially, hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) or asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) assembled with battery-type and capacitive-type electrodes usually exhibit superior electrochemical performance by combining the advantages of high capacity from battery-type cathodes and broad voltage windows from electric double-layer capacitive anodes. However, the sluggish ion/electron diffusion and inferior structural stability of the battery-grade electrode materials may limit their actual applications in some fields requiring high-rate and long-life energy storage and conversion. Much effort has been focused on the development of cathode materials with high-performance. As a spinel binary metal cobaltite, MgCo2O4 has attracted extensive attention in EES because of its high theoretical capacity, relatively better environmental friendliness and the abundant natural reserves of magnesium. In this work, current research progress regarding the synthetic strategies for powdered MgCo2O4, binder-free hetero-structure of MgCo2O4 on the current collector, and MgCo2O4-based composites and their applications in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, Mg-ion batteries, and some other rechargeable ion batteries is reviewed in detail. Finally, we put forward some conclusive remarks and perspectives on the future development of metal-ion batteries and supercapacitors with outstanding performance. Our intention is to provide some clues for the build-up of high-rate and long-life energy storage systems as well as guidance for future related research on other binary metal cobaltites in energy storage devices.Runze WuRunze Wu is currently a masters candidate under the supervision of Prof. Chunju Xu at North University of China.

1. Introduction
With the acceleration of industrialization and development of social economy, traditional energy resources such as crude oil and coal are approaching exhaustion. The emission of pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides during the global use of fossil fuels brings great damage to the ecosystem. In order to seek an efficient solution to resolve the above issues regarding the energy shortage and the accompanying environmental pollution, people have been committed to the exploitation and utilization of renewable and clean natural energies such as hydropower, wind, solar, and tidal energies.1,2 However, these natural energy resources are closely related to the detailed geographic conditions, and they cannot provide energy steadily and continuously. So far, electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices have been considered as promising candidates in virtue of their merits such as operational stability, high efficiency and environmental friendliness, which are expected to harvest the intermittent natural energies and output in the form we need.3,4 EES devices store energy based on several principles such as charge adsorption, charge intercalation, and breakage of chemical bonds due to the interaction between materials and electrolytes. The burgeoning demand for electric vehicles and electronic devices put forward higher requirements on the performance of EES systems. Based on the above reasons, the development of EES devices should take into account high energy and power densities, long cycling span, fast charging capability and operational safety.5 Among the various currently existing EES systems, supercapacitors and batteries are the paramount energy storage devices.6,7 Batteries store charges through intercalation of ions in the electrode materials to obtain high energy densities.8 Supercapacitors store energies mainly through charge accumulation in the electrode/electrolyte interface or through fast Faradaic reactions at the electro-active sites, and they have the advantages of high power density, fast charge/discharge capability, long cycling span as well as superior rate capability.9,10 However, batteries and supercapacitors are imperfect, and they have their respective shortcomings including low power density for batteries and inferior energy density for supercapacitors. It is widely known that research progress regarding electrode materials has promoted the development of emerging energy-storage devices.11,12 Hence, it is essential to explore and research advanced electrode materials in order to improve the electrochemical performances of EES devices.
In recent years, conducting polymers, carbonaceous materials and some transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been widely used as electrode materials for EES devices with their own advantages.13–15 Carbonaceous materials usually possess a large specific surface area, porous structure, superior conductivity and cost-effectiveness, but the low capacitance and energy density of carbon-based EES devices may hinder their further applications.16,17 Conducting polymers are promising organic materials for EES devices owing to their good conductivity, light weight, flexibility and low cost.18 However, such materials usually suffer from structural collapse over a long-term cycling process, and the poor cycling life becomes a fatal problem in their real applications.19 In contrast, TMOs have been regarded as the most promising electrode materials applicable to supercapacitors,20,21 lithium-ion batteries,22,23 and electrocatalysts24,25 because of their inherent superiorities of multiple oxidation states as well as complex physicochemical structures.26,27 Among theTMOs, Co3O4 is one of the most studied and reported electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage on account of its high theoretical charge storability up to 1602 C g−1 and rich redox activities.28 There are some review papers reported so far on the discussion and summary of the research progress regarding Co3O4-based electrode materials and their applications in EES. For example, Wang et al. discussed the methods for the synthesis of Co3O4 and summarized the recent process in Co3O4-based electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.29 Shi et al. introduced the preparation of Co3O4 with different morphologies and structures, and then summarized the applications of Co3O4 and its composites as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries with superior electrochemical properties.30 Although Co3O4 has exhibited good electrochemical performances, it has some drawbacks including the scarce natural reserves, toxicity, and high cost of cobalt, which may prohibit its actual applications in EES to a certain extent. Therefore, some considerable efforts are devoted to the partial replacement of cobalt with more eco-friendly and inexpensive metals (Mg, Ni, Cu, and so on) to synthesize spinel-type binary metal cobaltites, which are usually expressed with the general formula of ACo2O4. The electrochemical performances are expected to improve efficiently compared to those of single Co3O4.31–34 When the external elemental metal A is introduced into the Co3O4 crystal structure, it may enhance the overall conductivity if A has better conductivity than cobalt. On the other hand, if the element A has various valence states, it can also generate rich electrochemical reactions, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties. Among the cobalt-based binary metal oxides, MgCo2O4 has attracted extensive attention in supercapacitors,35 batteries,36 catalysts,37–40 and sensors41 because of its high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness and abundant natural reserves of elemental magnesium. The MgCo2O4 molecule usually possesses a normal spinel structure and the detailed crystal structure is presented in Fig. 1. The Co ions are located in the octahedral sites and Mg ions occupy the tetrahedral positions.
 Fig. 1  The crystal structure of MgCo2O4. 
When MgCo2O4 serves as the electrode material for supercapacitors, elemental magnesium does not participate in Faradaic reactions owing to no change of valence state, and all the redox reactions are derived from cobalt with several oxidation states. However, MgCo2O4 possesses a much larger bandgap compared to pure Co3O4, which can enhance the material's electrochemical activity.42 In addition, the transport of electrons has relatively low activation energy between multiple metal species, which is also helpful to improve the overall electrochemical performances. The fast and reversible faradaic reactions of MgCo2O4 as an electrode material for supercapacitors can be expressed as follows: MgCo2O4 + H2O + e− ↔ 2CoOOH + MgO(1) 2CoOOH + 2H2O + 2e− ↔ 2Co(OH)2 + 2OH−(2)
As for the application of MgCo2O4 in Li-ion batteries, the inactive MgO is usually formed during the first discharge and it may prevent volume change in the subsequent electrochemical reactions, retaining the good cycling stability. In view of the above-mentioned merits, the MgCo2O4 electrode material has been widely studied in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. However, the material sometimes still suffers from poor stability under certain electrolytic conditions, and it only delivers a quarter of the theoretical capacity in the supercapattery storage mode. As for the Li-ion storage mode, some MgCo2O4 nanostructures can deliver capacity higher than that of the theoretical value. The present research is mainly focused on the synthesis of low-cost energy storage materials and improvement of the charge storability such as high capacity and energy density. So it is important to provide a summary of current studies related to the MgCo2O4 electrode material in order to find out the solution to the enhancement of charge storage capability as well as guide the future research direction in this field.
Krishnan et al. recently reviewed and analyzed the progress of MgCo2O4 as a charge storage electrode for Li-ion batteries, supercapatteries (battery-type electrodes), and magnesium rechargeable battery cathodes. They clearly pointed out the troubling issues regarding the limitation of the charge storage for each type of device, and provided some detailed analysis and possible solutions from a scientific point of view including the brief discussion on energy storage parameters of ACo2O4 for Li-ion batteries and supercapatteries, crystal and band structures emphasizing the energy storage parameters of MgCo2O4 and Li-ion batteries, and stability issues of MgCo2O4 in some secondary batteries. Finally the authors gave some impressive conclusions and recommendations on the improvement of the charge storability. Their work intended to comprehend the energy storage properties of MgCo2O4 towards commercialization.42 Besides, the research progress in MgCo2O4-based electrode materials applicable to the EES has been rarely summarized and reported. As for the currently existing references regarding the detailed synthesis strategy and solution to the improvement of conductivity, porosity, and electro-active sites of MgCo2O4, it is still necessary and urgent to provide a thorough summary of the previously reported work. High-performance MgCo2O4 electrode material with controlled shape and porosity can be rationally designed and synthesized via a simple synthetic route which is of significant importance for its real applications in EES. In this work, we mainly focus on the detailed preparation methods of powdered MgCo2O4 materials, binder-free MgCo2O4 hetero-structure and MgCo2O4-based composites, as well as their applications in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, Mg-ion batteries, and other batteries. The morphology and structure control, synthetic methods and electrochemical performances of these materials are discussed and summarized in detail. The purpose of this review is to highlight the advancement made with MgCo2O4-based electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage, and present the challenges and perspectives for the future research direction related to this type of electrode materials.
2. MgCo2O4-based electrode materials for supercapacitors
Among the various EES devices, supercapacitors have attracted burgeoning interests by virtue of their unique merits, such as high power density, long cycling life, fast charge/discharge capability, and environmental benignity.43,44 Based on the charge storage mechanism, supercapacitors are geneally divided into two categories: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo-capacitors (PCs). EDLCs store energy by charge adsorption and desorption in the double-layer on conductors with a large surface area, while PCs store charges mainly by fast surface redox reactions in addition to some EDLC behavior.45–47 In recent years, the design and assembly of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) or hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) are expected to greatly improve the energy density and expand the real applications. The ASCs or HSCs are usually assembled by utilizing the pseudo-capacitive (RuO2 or MnO2) or battery-type (e.g. Co3O4, NiCo2O4, and so on) electrode materials as positive electrodes, and electrochemical double-layer capacitive (activated carbon, CNTs, graphene, and so forth) electrode materials as negative electrodes. Such a design can broaden the total voltage window of the device because carbon-based anode materials often exhibit a wide potential window. Besides, the high capacity of TMO-based cathode materials can also be retained, so the specific capacity and energy density of ASCs (HSCs) are expected to be enhanced to a certain high level.48,49 It is necessary and particularly important to develop high-performance battery-type cathode materials through a simple and cost-effective method for their further actual applications in supercapacitors. Battery-grade electrode materials such as NiO,50 Co3O4,51 ZnCo2O4,52 CuCo2O4,53 MgCo2O4,54 and so on55–57 display a distinctive electrochemical behavior with a pair of strong redox peaks in cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and a potential plateau in galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles, which is different from the corresponding response of EDLCs or PCs. Among a variety of battery-type materials, especially cobalt-based binary metal oxides, MgCo2O4 has motivated a great deal of research enthusiasm in supercapacitors owing to its high theoretical specific capacity (∼1405 C g−1), abundant supply of elemental magnesium in nature, environmental benignity and low cost. Herein, we will summarize the detailed synthetic methods and applications regarding the powdered MgCo2O4, binder-free structure of MgCo2O4 materials, and MgCo2O4-based composites in supercapacitors, which are listed in Table 1 in detail. It is worth mentioning that the term “specific capacity” with the unit “C g−1” or “mA h g−1” is used for the battery-type MgCo2O4 and MgCo2O4-related composites in the next sections, and some of the data are converted from “F g−1” according to the GCD curves in the corresponding literature.

2.1 Powdered MgCo2O4 electrode materials
Powdered electrode materials are the most basic and widely studied materials owing to the advantages of easy operation in synthesis, mass production and low manufacturing cost. To fabricate a working electrode on the basis of a powdered electrode material, the binder and conductive reagents are generally mixed with it in an organic solvent, and the obtained homogeneous slurry is then coated on the current collector for further electrochemical tests. Presently, powdered MgCo2O4 in various morphologies applicable to supercapacitors has been synthesized through hydrothermal, solvothermal, and co-precipitation methods. For instance, the MgCo2O4 porous structure was hydrothermally prepared by Luo et al., and the as-prepared MgCo2O4 exhibited a specific capacity of 180.96 C g−1 (348 F g−1, 0–0.52 V) at 0.25 A g−1.58 Wang et al. reported that MgCo2O4 micro-flowers assembled with porous nanosheets were successfully synthesized through an initial hydrothermal method and a subsequent calcination process in air. These MgCo2O4 flowers possessed a specific surface area of 39.1 m2 g−1. The electrochemical tests indicated that such MgCo2O4 flowers delivered a specific capacity up to 337.14 C g−1 (749.2 F g−1, 0–0.45 V) at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a moderate rate capability with 73.3% capacity retention at 15 A g−1. Besides, about 67.8% of the initial capacity was retained over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The unique structure of MgCo2O4 flowers constructed from porous nanosheets was beneficial to the full contact between the electrolyte and electrode material, therefore exhibiting superior electrochemical performance.35 Wang and co-workers designed MgCo2O4 spheres with abundant oxygen vacancies (OV-MgCo2O4) via a hydrothermal method and NaBH4 reduction treatment. The OV-MgCo2O4 achieved a specific capacity of 184 C g−1 (460 F g−1, 0–0.4 V) at 1 A g−1 and good rate performance with 76% capacity retention at 20 A g−1. An ASC device fabricated with OV-MgCo2O4 and AC delivered an energy density of 18.7 W h kg−1 at the power density of 320 W kg−1.59
Recently, Chen et al. explored the influence of hydrothermal parameters on the morphology of powdered MgCo2O4, and they synthesized MgCo2O4 nanoflakes (NFs) and MgCo2O4 nanocubes (NCs) by changing the hydrothermal temperature and reaction time, respectively. The MgCo2O4 NFs possessed a specific surface area of 64.9 m2 g−1, which was higher than the 19.8 m2 g−1 of MgCo2O4 NCs. Meanwhile, the MgCo2O4 NFs exhibited a capacity of 315.66 C g−1 (734.1 F g−1, 0–0.43 V) at 1 A g−1 while MgCo2O4 NCs only delivered 233.7 C g−1 at the same current density. To evaluate the further actual applications of MgCo2O4, an ASC was assembled by using MgCo2O4 NFs as the cathode and AC as the anode, and the device could operate in a broad voltage window of 0–1.7 V as well as delivered an energy density up to 33.0 W h kg−1 at 859.6 W kg−1. These results strongly indicated that the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors was closely associated with the morphology and porosity of the electrode material.60 In Sandosh's work, MgCo2O4 materials were prepared through a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted hydrothermal technique followed by a calcination process. The MgCo2O4 electrode delivered a specific capacity of 319.95 C g−1 (711 F g−1, 0–0.45 V) at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with 94% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.61 Zhao et al. prepared spinel MgCo2O4 nanosheets by adopting a hydrothermal method. These MgCo2O4 nanosheets exhibited a specific capacity as high as 500.92 C g−1 (1431.2 F g−1, 0–0.35 V) at 1 A g−1 and remarkable cycling stability with only 2.35% capacity loss after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. An ASC was assembled with such MgCo2O4 nanosheets and AC as the cathode and anode, respectively, and the device displayed an energy density of 32 W h kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1.62
In Xu's work, double-urchin-like MgCo2O4 hierarchical microstructures were hydrothermally synthesized. As shown in the SEM images in Fig. 2a and b, the double-urchin-like MgCo2O4 architecture was composed of many nanoneedles with the size of 5–50 nm from the tip to the root. The porous MgCo2O4 microstructures showed a specific capacity of 254 C g−1 (508 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at 2 A g−1 and an outstanding cycling performance with 95.9% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.63 Wu et al. directly grew MgCo2O4 nanoflakes (NFs) and nanowires (NWs) on stainless steel foil (SSF) through a hydrothermal route followed by an additional annealing conversion of the precursors. Because SSF often exhibits relatively poor conductivity, its compositions vary greatly and the accurate control of compositions is hard to be realized. Some possible corrosion in strong alkaline electrolytes may lead to a decline in the electrochemical performance. Therefore, the porous MgCo2O4 NFs and NWs were scraped from SSF, and the MgCo2O4 NF-based powders could exhibit a high specific capacity of 424.98 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, while the NW powders delivered 351.17 C g−1. The assembled MgCo2O4 NFs//AC ASC delivered a capacity up to 146.10 C g−1, a long-life cycling stability with 108.28% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 6 A g−1, and a high energy density of 41.10 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1012.80 W kg−1.65

In addition to the hydrothermal synthesis using water as a solvent, ethanol and ethylene glycol can also be used for the solvothermal preparation of powdered MgCo2O4. For example, Krishnan et al. prepared MgCo2O4 cuboidal microcrystals in ethylene glycol solvent and nanoflowers in the presence of CTAB as a surfactant. The MgCo2O4 crystals assembled with layered flakes showed a capacity of 345 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 using 3 M LiOH as the electrolyte, higher than the 178 C g−1 for MgCo2O4 nanoflowers and 139 C g−1 for nanospheres obtained by the molten salt method. After 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1, the MgCo2O4 cuboidal microcrystals demonstrated superior charge retention (∼110%) to those of other MgCo2O4 nanostructures.66 In our research group, hierarchically porous MgCo2O4 micro-flowers were synthesized in ethanol solvent by a simple and cost-effective solvothermal method combined with a post annealing conversion of the precursor. These porous MgCo2O4 flowers possessed a specific surface area up to 71.58 m2 g−1 and a mean pore size of 29.6 nm. The results of electrochemical tests demonstrated that the flower-like MgCo2O4 belonged to the battery-type electrode material, and delivered a specific capacity of 313.3 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior rate capability with a capacity of 189.4 C g−1 at 16 A g−1 as well as good cycling stability with 74.5% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The mesoporous structure with a large surface area of MgCo2O4 micro-flowers was significantly beneficial in providing more active sites, shortening the diffusion paths for ions and electrons, and facilitating Faradaic reactions, thus improving the electrochemical properties.54 Later on, we further obtained MgCo2O4 twinned-hemispheres (Fig. 2c and d) in ethylene glycol solvent using a similar method. Such MgCo2O4 twinned-hemispheres with a specific surface area of 63.8 m2 g−1 exhibited good electrochemical performances including a capacity of 281.9 C g−1 (626.5 F g−1, 0–0.45 V) at 1 A g−1, good rate capability with 71.8% capacity retention at 16 A g−1 and moderate cycling stability with 68.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 2e and f).64
Besides the hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis, powdered MgCo2O4 materials could also be fabricated through other methods. For instance, Ghaziani et al. reported that MgCo2O4 nanofibers were prepared via a sol–gel electro-spinning method, and the effect of calcination temperature (500, 600, and 700 °C) on the physical and electrochemical properties of the fibers was investigated. The MgCo2O4 nanofibers obtained at 500 °C displayed a specific capacity of 84 C g−1 (210 F g−1, 0–0.4 V) at 0.5 A g−1 and 87.8% of the capacity could be retained after 3000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1.67 In Krishnan's work, MgCo2O4 with an aggregated structure was prepared via a molten salt method, and the MgCo2O4 possessed a specific capacity of 160.5 C g−1 (321 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at 0.5 A g−1.68 Moreover, MgCo2O4 nanorods with an average diameter of about 50–100 nm and length of 120 nm could be synthesized by a co-precipitation method, and the optimal specific capacity of these MgCo2O4 nanorods could reach 564 C g−1 (752 F g−1, −0.2 to 0.55 V) at the current density of 2 mA cm−2.69
Powdered MgCo2O4 electrode materials with different morphologies and structures (e.g. particles, nanosheets, nanorods, microflowers, and so forth) for supercapacitors have been reported to exhibit very fine electrochemical performance. However, the practical specific capacity of powdered MgCo2O4 in the reported literature is often far inferior to the theoretical value, and its cycling performance is not quite satisfactory to meet the requirements of actual applications. These problems may be mainly derived from the inherent poor conductivity of electrode materials and the unstable structure in the long-life cycling. Meanwhile, the utilization of the binder and conductive reagents during the preparation of the working electrode greatly increases the electrode resistance and reduces the electrochemical active sites, thus deteriorating the final electrochemical performance. Exploiting the facile preparation method and optimizing the synthetic parameters to synthesize MgCo2O4 electrode materials with controllable morphology and porosity are necessary in order to achieve enhanced electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.
2.2 Binder-free MgCo2O4 electrode materials
Powdered electrode materials possess some merits such as easy synthesis and large-scale production. However, in the subsequent stage of making the electrode, use of binders and conductive reagents is inevitable. It may increase the total resistance of the working electrode and then reduce the efficient utilization of active materials. Additionally, the active material sometimes falls off the electrode more or less after long-term cycles due to the structural collapse, resulting in the decay of cycling performance. Therefore, the binder-free synthesis of electrode materials without using any binder or conductive reagents is expected to tackle these problems to some extent, leading to an improved electrochemical performance. In recent years, some binder-free MgCo2O4 with different micro-/nanostructures have been successfully grown on conductive substrates (e.g. nickel foam, carbon fibers, etc.), and later on directly used as the working electrode for further electrochemical tests. Some detailed examples are given below.
Cui et al. prepared porous MgCo2O4 nanocones on a nickel foam (NF) substrate by a simple hydrothermal method (Fig. 3a). Such MgCo2O4 nanocones/NF hetero-structures (Fig. 3b and c) were directly used as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors and exhibited excellent electrochemical properties. At the current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacity of MgCo2O4 nanocones could reach 300 C g−1 (750 F g−1, 0–0.4 V), and about 84% of the initial capacity was retained after 1000 cycles. The good performance could be attributed to the unique mesoporous structure of MgCo2O4 nanocones supported by three-dimensional (3D) NF, which reduced the dependence on the binder and conductive reagents, and hence, the migration rate of both ions and electrons was greatly improved.70 Guan et al. fabricated MgCo2O4 nanowire arrays on graphene coated NF, and such a structure achieved a specific capacity of 263.2 C g−1 (658 F g−1, 0–0.4 V) at 1 A g−1.71 Teng and coworkers synthesized MgCo2O4 nanosheet arrays on NF, and they further investigated the effect of solvents on the structure and electrochemical performance of the MgCo2O4 nanosheets. The MgCo2O4 nanosheets prepared in the ethanol and water mixed solvent (MCN-1) were thinner than those in the pure water solvent (MCN-2), which was probably due to the fact that the polarity of ethanol was lower than that of water, leading to the slower precipitation rate of the precursor for MCN-1 and formation of thinner nanosheets of MCN-1. When used as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the MgCo2O4 nanosheets exhibited a battery-type electrochemical feature. The MCN-1 electrode displayed a maximum specific capacity of 853.06 C g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, which was superior to the 382.25 C g−1 of MCN-2. Moreover, about 94.65% of the original specific capacity of MCN-1 was preserved after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2, which is higher than the 73.90% of MCN-2. The better electrochemical performance of MCN-1 was mainly attributed to the thinner nanosheets, which were helpful for the transportation of ions/electrons and shortened the diffusion distance.72

Vijayakumar et al. utilized a hydrothermal method to synthesize MgCo2O4 nanosheets on NF (Fig. 3d). As shown in Fig. 3e and f, the MgCo2O4 nanosheets/NF exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance including a specific capacity as high as 947 C g−1 at 2 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with approximately 96% capacity retention after 5000 consecutive cycles at 25 A g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was constructed with the MgCo2O4 nanosheets/NF as the cathode and activated carbon as the anode, and the HSC device exhibited an energy density of 12.99 W h kg−1 at 448.7 W kg−1.73 In the study conductd by Xu's group, MgCo2O4 nanoneedles were densely grown on NF through hydrothermal reactions with a post-annealing process. The MgCo2O4 nanoneedles/NF hetero-structure showed a specific capacity of 402 C g−1 (804 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at 1 A g−1 and presented good cycling stability with 87% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 6 A g−1. The ASC assembled with MgCo2O4 nanoneedles/NF as the cathode and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the anode delivered an energy density of 81 W h kg−1 at the power density of 1350 W kg−1.74
In Wu's work, MgCo2O4 nanobrushes were hydrothermally deposited on carbon fibers (CFs) (Fig. 4a). The MgCo2O4 brushes/CFs (Fig. 4b and c) showed a high capacity of 427 mC cm−2 (854 mF cm−2, 0–0.5 V) at a current density of 2.5 mA cm−2 and superior rate performance with 399.5 mC cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2. The ASC was assembled with the MgCo2O4 brushes/CFs as the positive electrode, activated carbon fibers as the negative electrode and PVA–KOH as the solid electrolyte. The ASC device displayed a broad voltage window of 1.2 V and a specific capacity of 15.168 C cm−2 (12.64 F cm−3, 0–1.2 V) at 0.5 A cm−3.75

Gao's group reported that many submicron prismatic MCo2O4 (M = Co, Mn, Fe, Mg, and Zn) (Fig. 4d) could be successfully grown on NF by a general hydrothermal assisted co-precipitation method. It was found that the performance of all bimetal oxides was superior to that of a single metal oxide (Co3O4). Notably, MgCo2O4 showed the highest specific capacity of 613.5 C g−1 at a current density of 2 mA cm−2. In addition, the ASC was constructed with submicron prismatic MgCo2O4 and AC to further evaluate its actual application. The ASC exhibited a specific capacity of 182.8 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, an energy density of 39.7 W h kg−1 at 396 W kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability with 121.1% capacity preservation after 5000 cycles (Fig. 4e and f).34 Kim and coworkers firstly obtained silicon carbide flakes (SiCFs) via a simple carbonization treatment, and then introduced MgCo2O4 nanoneedles onto the surface of SiCFs by the solvothermal method.76 In 1 M of KOH aqueous electrolyte, the SiCFs/MgCo2O4 electrode showed a specific capacity of 310.02 C g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and excellent rate capability with 83.2% capacity retention at 500 mV s−1. An ASC was assembled with SiCFs/MgCo2O4 as the positive electrode, SiCF as the negative electrode and PVA–KOH–KI as the gel electrolyte. The maximum energy density of the device could reach 41.308 W h kg−1 at the power density of 464.72 W kg−1.77 In addition, they further fabricated an ASC with SiCF/MgCo2O4 nanoneedles as the cathode and SiCF/Fe3O4 as the anode, and the ASC possessed an energy density as high as 72.79 W h kg−1 at 727.96 W kg−1.78
The formation of binder-free MgCo2O4 electrode materials by directly growing MgCo2O4 on a conductive substrate may be helpful to exhibit better electrochemical properties than powdered MgCo2O4. The absence of binders and conductive reagents in this hetero-structure as well as the intimate contact between the active material and current collector may efficiently improve the utilization of the active material, reduce the overall resistance and maintain the structural integrity during the long-term cycling process. As a result, the preparation of binder-free electrode materials is one of the most promising methods to improve the charge storability of supercapacitors.
2.3 MgCo2O4-based composites
Although MgCo2O4 electrode materials with different morphologies and structures have been widely studied for supercapacitors, their practical electrochemical performance still remains unsatisfied, which is probably due to the inferior conductivity and limited electrochemical active sites. To deal with these problems, research has been devoted to the formation of MgCo2O4-based composites, which are usually formed by combining MgCo2O4 with carbons, conducting polymers, or metal oxides. On one hand, the combination of MgCo2O4 and carbon-based materials can both improve the overall conductivity and relieve the volume variation during the cycling process, thus improving the rate capability and cycling stability. On the other hand, the MgCo2O4/conducting polymer (metal oxide) composite may exhibit enhanced specific capacity and cycling performance compared to the single component material. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between two different electrode materials often can further improve the overall electrochemical performances. Therefore, the MgCo2O4-based composites are expected to show superior charge storability for supercapacitors, and to date, some literature studies regarding the MgCo2O4-based composites have been reported for energy storage and conversion.
Krishnan et al. reported that MgCo2O4 could be modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via a hydrothermal method. Electrochemical tests showed that the MgCo2O4/rGO composite exhibited a specific capacity of 285 C g−1 (570 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at a current density of 2.5 mA cm−2, and excellent cycling capability with 104% capacity retention at 25 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles as well as a low resistance of 0.80 Ω. The superior electrochemical performance of the MgCo2O4/rGO composite was mainly ascribed to the addition of rGO. It greatly enhanced the binding between Mg and Co ions in the MgCo2O4 crystal, reduced the dissolution of Mg in alkaline electrolytes, thereby showing significant electrochemical properties.79 Furthermore, the assembled ASC with MgCo2O4/rGO as the cathode and AC as the anode delivered an energy density of 31 W h kg−1 at 1800 W kg−1.80 Besides, the MgCo2O4 nanowires@MnO2 nanoflake composites were successfully prepared on the graphene decorated NF, and the composites displayed a specific capacity up to 354.9 C g−1 (887.3 F g−1, 0–0.4 V) at 1 A g−1 and good long-term cycling stability over 3000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Graphene makes the electron transportation easier, and it also serves as a buffer layer between MgCo2O4 nanowires@MnO2 nanoflake core–shell structure and the nickel skeleton, which efficiently strengthens the mechanical adhesion and improves the cycling stability. In addition, the direct growth of MgCo2O4 core nanowires on graphene can ensure every nanowire participates in the ultrafast electrochemical reaction at high current densities. The porous MnO2 nanoflake shell grown on the surface of MgCo2O4 nanowires can promote ion penetration and shorten the transport path of electrons and ions, which improves the capacity of electrode materials.81
In Xu's work, hierarchical core–shell structural MgCo2O4@MnO2 nanowall arrays were regularly grown on NF by a two-step hydrothermal method. The composites possessed a large surface area of 140.04 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.69 cm3 g−1, which were beneficial for the highly efficient charge/discharge reactions. The composite electrode delivered a specific capacity of about 426.25 C g−1 (852.5 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at a current density of 1 A g−1 and still achieved 286.65 C g−1 (573.3 F g−1) at 40 A g−1. The ASC assembled with MgCo2O4@MnO2 and AC showed a high energy density of 93.1 W h kg−1 at the power density of 576 W kg−1.82 Gao et al. successfully anchored a layer of polypyrrole (PPy) on the surface of the urchin-like MgCo2O4/NF hetero-structure via hydrothermal reactions and chemical oxidative polymerization methods (Fig. 5a and b). The MgCo2O4@PPy electrode demonstrated an extraordinary specific capacity of 485.82 C g−1 (1079.6 F g−1, 0–0.45 V) at 1 A g−1, good rate capability with 373.99 C g−1 at 20 A g−1 and 97.4% capacity retention at the end of 1000 cycles. The assembled MgCo2O4@PPy//AC ASC exhibited a specific capacity of 150.4 C g−1 (94 F g−1, 0–1.6 V) at 0.4 A g−1, and a high volumetric energy density of 17.18 mW h cm−3 at a volumetric power density of 0.16 W cm−3.83 The researchers in the same group further prepared double urchin-like hierarchical MgCo2O4@NiMoO4 core–shell structures on NF (Fig. 5c) through two-step hydrothermal approaches. The composite electrode exhibited a huge specific capacity of 710 C g−1 (1775 F g−1, 0–0.4 V) at 1 A g−1, 67.1% capacity retention at 20 A g−1 and moderate cycling stability with 74.7% capacity preservation after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The MgCo2O4@NiMoO4 composite and AC were employed to assemble an ASC, which exhibited an energy density of 37.5 W h kg−1 at 480 W kg−1 and an excellent cycling stability of 71.7% after 10000 cycles. The reason for the superior electrochemical properties may be that the double urchin-like MgCo2O4 grown on the NF provides a large number of active sites for the chemical reaction, while the NiMoO4 deposited on the double urchin-like MgCo2O4 provides a new path for electron transfer and ion diffusion, increasing the specific surface area and reducing the internal resistance.84

Teng et al. designed hierarchical MgCo2O4@MnO2 core–shell nanosheet arrays (CNAs) on NF by employing a solvothermal reaction combined with a post calcination process.86 At the current density of 1 mA cm−2, the MgCo2O4@MnO2 CNA electrode showed a superior specific capacity of 968.98 C g−1 and good cycling stability with 91.45% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. In order to explore the actual applications, an ASC was constructed with MgCo2O4@MnO2 CNAs/NF as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode. The all-solid-state ASC device and traditional aqueous ASC device were fabricated with PVA–KOH gel and KOH solution as the electrolyte, respectively. The all-solid-state ASC exhibited an energy density of 18.65 W h kg−1 at the power density of 264.5 W kg−1, while the traditional aqueous ASC delivered an energy density of 26.44 W h kg−1 at 289.9 W kg−1. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the combination of the MgCo2O4 core and MnO2 shell, and such a core–shell structure greatly increases the electro-active sites at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Furthermore, Kumar et al. hydrothermally synthesized MgCo2O4 nanoflake arrays and MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 nanochain arrays (NCAs) on NF. When used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors, these MgCo2O4 materials exhibited battery-like electrochemical behavior. The MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 NCAs displayed better electrical conductivity and exhibited a specific capacity up to 316.8 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, higher than the 265.3 mA h g−1 of MgCo2O4 nanoflake arrays. Meanwhile, the MgCo2O4/MgCo2O4 NCA composite presented superior cycling performance with only 3% capacity loss after 5000 cycles at 6 A g−1.87 Zhu et al. synthesized Ni and Zn co-doped MgCo2O4 on cobalt foam using a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The hetero-structure possessed a capacity as high as 900 C g−1 (1500 F g−1, 0–0.6 V) at the current density of 5 mA cm−2, and the capacity exhibited no attenuation compared with the initial value (89% of its highest capacity) over 20000 cycles, superior to that of pure MgCo2O4. Furthermore, an ASC was assembled by employing Ni and Zn co-doped MgCo2O4 as the cathode and AC as the anode. The ASC device with a stable operation voltage window of 0–1.7 V could deliver a high energy density of 46.9 W h kg−1 at 132.8 W kg−1. The improved electrochemical performance of the binder-free Ni and Zn co-doped MgCo2O4 could put down to the fact that the porous nanosheet arrays directly grown on the current collector (cobalt foam) reduced the shedding of active materials in the electrochemical tests, and the channels between the nanosheets were beneficial to the internal diffusion of electrolyte ions.88
Liu et al. synthesized the MgCo2O4@NiMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell structural composites on NF via two-step hydrothermal methods. The MgCo2O4@NiMn LDH/NF composite delivered an amazing capacity of 1878.6 C g−1 (3757.2 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 5d) and superior cycling capability with 86.9% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at 10 A g−1. The ASC derived from the MgCo2O4@NiMn LDH/NF (cathode) and AC (anode) showed an energy density of 62.33 W h kg−1 at 750 W kg−1 (Fig. 5e).85 Hierarchical MgCo2O4@CoFe LDH core–shell nanowires on the NF substrate could be prepared through the initial hydrothermal reactions and post calcination treatment. The MgCo2O4@CoFe LDH composite delivered an extraordinary specific capacity of 903.15 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 80.2% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The assembled MgCo2O4@CoFe LDH/NF//AC ASC showed a high energy density of 60.82 W h kg−1 at 725 W kg−1.89 Moreover, they further prepared MgCo2O4@NiCo LDH on NF using a similar method. The MgCo2O4@NiCo LDH delivered a super-high capacity of 2850.6 C g−1 (5701.2 F g−1, 0–0.5 V) at 1 A g−1 and 83.7% capacity retention at the end of 5000 cycles. The ASC assembled with MgCo2O4@NiCo LDH and AC exhibited a remarkable energy density of 89.79 W h kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1.90
According to the above analysis, the powdered MgCo2O4, binder-free MgCo2O4 on a conductive substrate and MgCo2O4-based composites have been widely studied in supercapacitors, and each type of MgCo2O4 electrode material possesses its own advantages and disadvantages. The powdered MgCo2O4 can be easily synthesized in mass production, but its inferior specific capacity and relatively poor electrical conductivity may hinder its broad practical applications. The binder-free MgCo2O4 on a conductive substrate can sometimes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance compared to powdered MgCo2O4. However, the large-scale production still remains a big challenge. The MgCo2O4-based composites can deliver enhanced specific capacity and good cycling performance due to the combined contributions from different electrode materials; the complicated preparation procedures which are energy- and time-consuming may also limit their further applications in energy storage. Therefore, exploring a simple, cost-effective, and mass-production method to synthesize MgCo2O4 as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors will be one of the hottest research directions.
3. MgCo2O4-based electrode materials for batteries
As one of the most promising energy storage devices, rechargeable batteries have attracted extensive research interest owing to their inherent advantages such as satisfactory energy and power densities, high storage efficiency, environmental friendliness, and low maintenance cost.91,92 However, there is still sufficient space for improvement in all these issues. Each type of battery has its set of leading problems that need better solutions.93 A typical rechargeable battery device is mainly composed of an electrode material, a separator, an electrolyte, and a current collector. Among them, the electrode material is the key component of the device and plays a vital role in improving the electrochemical performance of batteries. Traditional electrode materials such as graphite and other carbon-based materials usually present a narrow working voltage window and low specific capacity, which impede their extensive practical applications in rechargeable batteries. To ameliorate the predicament, TMOs as a competitive candidate have been widely used in rechargeable batteries because of their merits of low cost and high gravimetric specific capacity. Among the various TMOs existing currently, MgCo2O4 has aroused massive research interest in Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Mg-ion batteries (MIBs), Li–O2 batteries, and Zn batteries by virtue of its high theoretical specific capacity, low cost and abundant reserves, and exhibits prominent electrochemical performance, as listed in Table 2.

3.1 MgCo2O4 for Li-ion batteries
Currently, there are various types of rechargeable batteries such as lead–acid, Ni–Cd, Ni–MH, Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Na-ion batteries and other aqueous metal-ion batteries. They have been applied in different fields due to their own advantages and disadvantages. Among them, LIBs have occupied a dominant position in the consumer market because of their intrinsic merits such as high gravimetric energy density, low self-discharge rate and low maintenance system.94,95 The working principle of Li-ion batteries mainly relies on the repeated transfer of lithium ions between the anode and cathode.96 Graphite is often used as the commercial anode material for Li-ion batteries, but its low theoretical specific capacity (372 mA h g−1) makes it difficult to meet with the increasing energy demand of electric vehicles and other electronic devices.97 In addition, the fabrication of graphite with high purity is cost-intensive. As one of the promising anode materials for the LIBs, MgCo2O4 has received increasing attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 780 mA h g−1. The spinel structure of MgCo2O4 with lower electrical resistance and threshold energy may facilitate intercalation of Li+ ions, and the mixed valence states and the semiconductor nature of MgCo2O4 will also improve the electrochemical reactions. When MgCo2O4 serves as the LIB electrode, the energy storage mechanism is involved in the intercalation and conversion reactions and reversible chemical bonding. The Li+ intercalation occurs deeper in the electrode pores during electrochemical reactions. To date, MgCo2O4 with different morphologies and structures have been reported for LIBs, and they often exhibit superior electrochemical performance. For example, Sharma et al. synthesized needle-shaped MgCo2O4 particles via a simple oxalate decomposition method, as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 6a. Such an MgCo2O4 anode for LIBs delivered a reversible capacity of 114 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 60 mA g−1.98

Wu et al. prepared a novel MgCo2O4 porous structure consisting of secondary ultrafine NPs by a solvothermal method and heat treatment process. The porous MgCo2O4 electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 824 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 500 mA g−1 and superior cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 543 mA h g−1 after 350 cycles at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6b).99 In Darbar's work, MgCo2O4 with a spherical shape (Fig. 6c) and fibrous structure (Fig. 6d) was obtained via the oxalate decomposition and electro-spinning method, respectively. The MgCo2O4 nanofibers obtained under the optimal conditions delivered a reversible specific capacity of 795 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 60 mA g−1. Furthermore, the nanofibers still possessed a reversible capacity of 411 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 240 mA g−1.100 Kulkarni and coworkers synthesized MgCo2O4 particles with different morphologies and sizes via a simple precipitation method, and further explored the effect of precipitating agents on the electrochemical performance of MgCo2O4. The results showed that the uniform cubic MgCo2O4 particles obtained from LiOH as the precipitating agent exhibited a reversible capacity of 899 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 60 mA g−1, which was superior to that of MgCo2O4 agglomerated particles prepared using KOH as the precipitating agent (Fig. 6e). The superior performance of cubic MgCo2O4 particles can be mainly attributed to the large surface area and crystallinity, which provide more electro-active sites and lower resistance.101
In Kulkarni's work, they reported a facile precipitation preparation of MgCo2O4 and further investigated the effect of calcination temperature on the electrochemical performance. The MgCo2O4 electrode materials calcined at 600 °C delivered the best electrochemical performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 886 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 60 mA g−1 and long-term stability with a capacity of 358 mA h g−1 at 0.5C over 500 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the existence of a small amount of MgO, which was believed to help retain the structural stability of anode materials in the electrochemical reactions.102 Reddy et al. synthesized spinel MgCo2O4 particles via a template-free molten salt method. When used as anode materials for LIBs, these MgCo2O4 particles exhibited a reversible capacity of 816 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 60 mA g−1 and maintained a reversible capacity of 460 mA h g−1 over 140 cycles at 600 mA g−1.103 In Shin's group, quadruple-shelled MgCo2O4 hollow microspheres used as anode materials for LIBs were prepared through a solvothermal method with the assistance of colloidal carbon spheres as a hard-template, as shown in the schematic illustration provided in Fig. 7a. The SEM image (Fig. 7b) and TEM image (Fig. 7c) clearly showed that the MgCo2O4 exhibited a multi-shelled structure. As shown in Fig. 7d, the cyclic voltammogram displayed a superior reversibility of electrochemical reaction after the first cycle. The unique multi-shelled MgCo2O4 hollow structure delivered a high discharge capacity of 1360 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 7e). The remarkable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the quadruple-shelled hollow structure. The interstitial spaces within the four shells provided abundant meso-pores and shortened the distance of Li+ diffusion, thus promoting the electrochemical kinetics by facilitating charge transfer and mass transfer. Furthermore, the void space between each shell could alleviate the volume expansion during the Li+ insertion and extraction, improving the volumetric specific capacity.104

Wang and colleagues directly grew MgCo2O4 NWs on NF as a binder-free anode material for LIBs (Fig. 8a). The morphology and size of these NWs were observed from the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 8b and c), respectively. The MgCo2O4 NW electrode exhibited a discharge capacity of 649 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1. The binder-free MgCo2O4 NW structure increased the overall conductivity and then reduced the distance of Li-ion diffusion, thus improving the electrochemical performance of LIBs.105 Gu et al. reported that MgCo2O4/Li4Ti5O12 composites could be fabricated via a co-precipitation method. When used as an anode material for LIBs, the composites exhibited a discharge capacity of 300 mA h g−1 and still retained 85.5% of the initial capacity at the end of 150 cycles. The high discharge capacity and superior cycling performance are associated with the improved conductivity and increased active sites by the surface modification of Li4Ti5O12 with MgCo2O4.106 Wang et al. prepared MgCo2O4 porous nanosheets (Fig. 8d) through a microwave-assisted liquid phase method combined with a subsequent annealing process. The MgCo2O4 porous sheets exhibited a high specific capacity of 1173.8 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and superior cycling stability with 96.3% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 8e and f). The monolayer porous nanosheet shortened the transport pathway for Li+ ions and electrons, thus improving the electrochemical performance.107

It was reported that the MgCo2O4@C dodecahedra could be prepared from a bimetal organic framework via a simple co-precipitation method followed by a calcination process in an argon atmosphere. MgCo2O4@C delivered a high discharge capacity of 1302 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1 and outstanding cycling capability with 1195 mA h g−1 capacity retention after 200 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical properties are ascribed to the generation of inert MgO during the first discharge, which serves as an intermediate buffer layer to alleviate the volume change in the subsequent cycling process.108 Furthermore, the researchers in the same group also fabricated MgCo2O4@TiO2 nanorods (NRs) by an oxalate decomposition method and surface modification. When used as an anode in LIBs, the MgCo2O4@TiO2 NRs achieved a discharge capacity of 803 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and retained 856 mA h g−1 at the end of 300 cycles. The TiO2 coating can provide buffer space, which is beneficial to reduce the volume change during the charge/discharge process. In addition, the lithiated TiO2 coating can enhance the electrical conductivity of the electrode material, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the surface of TiO2-coating may prevent electrolytes from being immersed within the sealed MgCo2O4, hence leading to enhanced electrochemical properties.109 All the above examples demonstrate that MgCo2O4 in different morphologies and structures can be efficiently used as an anode for LIBs with superior electrochemical performance.
3.2 MgCo2O4 for Mg-ion batteries
LIBs have been widely used in many fields to date, but there still exist some problems such as low-voltage energy storage, low specific power density, limited Li resources caused by excessive consumption, high cost and some environmental issues. All these may hinder the applications of LIBs in fields requiring both high power and high energy densities, especially in aqueous electrolyte-based systems. In contrast with Li-ion batteries, magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs) have been proven to be more promising rechargeable batteries owing to their intrinsic advantages such as lower redox potential, higher capacity capability (2205 mA h g−1), better cycling performance, safer operation with no dendrite generation in the charge–discharge process, abundant natural reserves and low cost of magnesium.110,111 Although the cell voltage is usually not high enough (∼1.5 V), MIBs have still received increasing attention recently. As a transition metal oxide with a spinel structure, MgCo2O4 has been proven to show Mg2+ intercalation/de-intercalation behavior and exhibits a high open-circuit voltage (OCV) when used as the cathode material for MIBs. Based on these unique advantages, MgCo2O4-based materials as cathodes of Mg-ion batteries have been reported with extraordinary electrochemical performances. For example, Truong et al. prepared spinel MgCo2O4 NPs by a one-pot facile and rapid supercritical fluid method (Fig. 9a). The TEM image in Fig. 9b demonstrates that the MgCo2O4 NPs exhibited a cubic shape. When used as the cathode material for MIBs, the device presented a discharge capacity of 124.1 mA h g−1 (Fig. 9d). The synthesis is facile and rapid, and their resultant small crystallite size with short Mg diffusion length may facilitate fast charge and mass transport as well as enhance the contact with the electrolyte and the resulting reaction kinetics.112 In Ichitsubo's work, the authors prepared MgCo2O4 samples through an inverse coprecipitation process and studied the spinel structure and conductivity of MgCo2O4. The MIB was fabricated with MgCo2O4 as the positive electrode and Mg as the negative electrode in an electrolyte of acetonitrile with Mg(ClO4)2 salt, which exhibited a high OCV of about 3.5 V and could light a blue diode with a band gap of about 2.6 V (Fig. 9e).113 Furthermore, Okamoto et al. also synthesized MgCo2O4 cathode materials for MIBs by using the same coprecipitation method. The Mg insertion into the spinel lattices occurs through the “intercalation and push-out” mechanism, which formed a rocksalt phase in the spinel mother phase. The “intercalation and push-out” process may provide a new strategy for designing cathode materials for polyvalent cations.114

In Kotani's group, the spinel MgCo2O4 mesocrystals with a porous framework structure were successfully synthesized by the reaction of Mg ions with calcite-type CoCO3 mesocrystal precursors in agar gels. The detailed synthesis of MgCo2O4 mesocrystals is illustrated in Fig. 9c. The obtained MgCo2O4 mesocrystals delivered the highest discharge capacity of 165 mA h g−1, superior to that of MgCo2O4 NPs synthesized by the inverse co-precipitation method. The excellent electrochemical performance of MgCo2O4 mesocrystals can be attributed to its unique structure, which displays a high specific surface area and single-crystalline structure, providing a high connectivity of the Mg2+ diffusion paths in the solid-phase.115 Gu and coworkers reported that MgCo2O4 NPs were initially prepared via a co-precipitation method and then MgCo2O4/graphite composites were obtained by a three-dimensional mixing process. The MgCo2O4/graphite composites with a relatively low proportion of MgCo2O4 delivered a remarkably high specific capacity of 180 mA h g−1 at a C rate of 0.05C (Fig. 9f). The superior electrochemical performance may be due to the decoration of MgCo2O4 NPs and the improved conductivity induced by graphite.116 According to the above descriptions, it can be easily concluded that the MgCo2O4 electrode materials can exhibit good electrochemical properties in MIBs.
3.3 MgCo2O4 for other batteries
Apart from Li-ion and Mg-ion batteries, MgCo2O4-related electrode materials are also used in other types of batteries such as Zn batteries and Li–O2 batteries. The aqueous rechargeable Zn battery is regarded to be very promising because of the high operation voltage (∼1.8 V), high security and extensive global stockpile. For example, Zhu et al. successfully grew Ni and Zn co-doped spinel MgCo2O4 on cobalt foam via a simple one-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 10a). Especially, the cobalt foam served as both the source of cobalt and support. The obtained Ni and Zn co-doped MgCo2O4 was constructed by nanosheets with a thickness of 50–200 nm, and the sheets were closely connected to form a highly dense and ordered array structure (Fig. 10b). An aqueous Zn battery was fabricated with such Ni, Zn-codoped MgCo2O4 as the cathode and commercial Zn sheet as the anode in an electrolyte of 3 M KOH and 0.02 M Zn(AC)2. The assembled Zn battery exhibited an ultrahigh capacity of 1.93 mA h cm−2 and remarkable cycling stability with no capacity loss after 30000 cycles (Fig. 10c and d).88

Furthermore, Wang et al. firstly prepared graphene on NF via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and then grew MgCo2O4 NWs (Fig. 10e and f) on the graphene substrate supported by NF through a simple hydrothermal method. The binder-free MgCo2O4@graphene electrode materials possessed a large specific surface area of 119.3 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 12.6 nm. When employed as the cathode for Li–O2 batteries, the MgCo2O4 NW structure can guide the growth of Li2O2 into a homogeneous thin film that facilitates its decomposition at low over-potential. The non-aqueous Li–O2 battery was capable of operating over 480 cycles with limiting capacity and rate values at 400 mA h g−1 and 200 mA g−1, respectively.117
The electrode material is often considered as a special catalyst, and the performance is closely related to its shape, size, structure, and other intrinsic properties. MgCo2O4 with different structures and morphologies have been reported in a variety of batteries including LIBs, MIBs, Zn batteries and Li–O2 batteries, and they can exhibit different electrochemical performances.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
High rate, superior density, and long-life energy storage are promising development directions of next-generation high performance EES devices. The electrochemical performances of TMO-based supercapacitors and batteries are primarily limited by the battery-type electrode due to the sluggish kinetics of ion and electron diffusion in the bulk materials and the inferior structural stability of the active materials. As a binary transition metal oxide, MgCo2O4 has a normal spinel crystal structure similar to that of Co3O4, in which Mg ions occupy the tetrahedral sites and Co ions occupy the octahedral sites. The MgCo2O4 electrode material is an intriguing candidate for electrochemical energy devices such as supercapacitors and batteries owing to its unique advantages of high theoretical specific capacity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. In this work, we were mainly committed to reviewing the synthesis of MgCo2O4-based electrode materials including powdered MgCo2O4, binder-free MgCo2O4 hetero-structure and MgCo2O4-based composites via different synthetic methods, as well as their applications in some electrochemical energy storage systems such as supercapacitors, LIBs, MIBs, aqueous rechargeable Zn batteries, and Li–O2 batteries. We further described the synthesis methods and structure-based electrochemical performances of MgCo2O4 electrode materials in detail.
Although some superior electrochemical properties of MgCo2O4 in electrochemical energy storage have been reported, some challenges still exist and need to be explored. There is still substantial room for the development of new strategies aiming to further improve the electrochemical performances of supercapacitor and battery devices. The following points cover some problems and concerns in the current research of MgCo2O4-based electrode materials that need to be taken into account for future design and fabrication of EES devices.
(1) The mechanism of charge storage needs to be further explored and some basic concepts should be corrected. For example, the term “capacity” with the unit “C g−1” or “mA h g−1” should be used for battery-type electrode materials, however, “capacitance” and “F g−1” have often been wrongly used for this type of materials in many published literature studies. In the field of LIBs, some TMO-based battery-type materials do not exhibit pseudo-capacitance in the bulk state due to phase transformations during ion storage. With the size of material reducing to the nanoscale level, the surface area increases greatly, leading to a decrease in the diffusion distance of ions, and the phase transformation is suppressed in some cases. Then the voltage plateau is reduced in favor of a continuously sloping voltage profile over the entire intercalation range, and even an almost linear discharge curve emerges as the size of electrode material decreases to a sufficiently small value. So the in-depth study of energy storage mechanisms is necessary, which can help to understand the important control steps affecting reaction rates and then make improvements regarding the material design.
(2) The relatively poor electrical conductivity of MgCo2O4 needs to be improved, which can be realized by combining it with other conductive materials such as carbon-based materials (graphene, CNTs, carbon dots, etc.), noble metals (e.g. Pt, Au, and Ag), and so on. The overall high resistance derived from the poor conductivity may largely decrease the rate capability and power density of MgCo2O4. Therefore, the combination of MgCo2O4 and other conductive materials with very good conductivity is expected to improve the final electrochemical performance. In addition, the capacity of electrode materials can be enhanced by atom doping. Some examples related to metal ion-doped transition metal compounds, and N and other hetero-atom doped carbon materials have been reported; this idea can also be applied to the design and fabrication of MgCo2O4-based materials. Research on hetero-atoms or/and metal ion-doped MgCo2O4 electrodes in supercapacitors and rechargeable metal-ion batteries can be further explored.
(3) The electrochemical performance is greatly dependent on the porous feature (large specific surface area, suitable pore size and distribution, and so forth) of electrode materials, so the design and preparation of MgCo2O4-based materials with controllable porous structure and adjustable pore size via simple methods is very important. Currently, research on MOF-assisted self-template methods as well as electro-spinning method for the synthesis of electrode materials has received increasing attention. MOF is a new type of material consisting of metal clusters/centers and organic ligands, and is constructed by self-assembly with various dimensional crystal structures. It is characterized by adjustable size and strong chemical modification owing to the diversity of organic ligands. So it can serve as a template or precursor to prepare electrode materials with hollow structures, tunable shapes, and tailored compositions under different conditions, such as the synthesis of porous metal oxides via pyrolysis of MOFs in air and porous carbon through the pyrolysis of the corresponding MOF in an inert atmosphere. In addition, the MOF-derived electrode materials usually possess high specific surface area and large internal pore volume. Considering the above, MgCo2O4 in a variety of porous shapes is expected to be obtained by these approaches. The porous structure can alleviate the structural change and volume expansion during the long-term charge/discharge cycling process. The suitable pore size not only facilitates the penetration of the electrolyte, but also shortens the transportation distance of ions and electrons, thus improving the electrochemical performance.
(4) For real applications in supercapacitors, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) or hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) are usually assembled with battery-type MgCo2O4 as the cathode and electrical double-layer capacitive electrode materials as the anode. Excellent electrochemical performance of the device is often obtained due to the combined contributions from the high capacity battery-type MgCo2O4 and the large voltage window of the EDLC-based negative electrode. The power density and energy density may be further enhanced by using an anode with a wider potential window and higher specific capacitance such as V2O5, rGO/Fe2O3, Bi2O3 and so on. In addition, the usage of ionic liquid electrolytes or organic electrolytes can improve the voltage window of a device to a certain extent and hence can further enhance the energy density. The contact of active materials and current collector can be firmer if a buffer layer is introduced between them, and such a buffer layer can also enhance the conductivity of the electrode, resulting in better cycling performance in the long-term cycling process.
(5) The practical application of MgCo2O4 in electrochemical energy storage needs further exploration and implementation. Presently, the study of MgCo2O4 still remains at the laboratory stage, and the following barriers should be overcome prior to its commercial use. Some published studies reported the very high specific capacity of MgCo2O4-based materials at low current densities, which could not meet the requirement in actual use. Excellent electrochemical performance including high capacity and long-term cycling stability at high current density is usually required. In addition, commercial use always demands high mass loading (more than 10 mg cm−2), which is far higher than that in the current lab-scale (1–3 mg cm−2). In the case of high mass loading, sufficient infiltration of the electrolyte throughout the thick electrode is an important issue, and the engineering of pores and three-dimensional hierarchical architectures in the nanoscale can create sufficient ion and electron transport pathways. To meet the basic requirements of small and portable electronic devices in the future, both high volumetric and gravimetric energy/power outputs are strongly desired for the commercial applications of MgCo2O4-based electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.
