A combination of strong visible light absorption and low-lying frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels make PDI useful as a photoactive electron transporting material in organic solar cells. Indeed, PDI based molecules and polymers have been studied as so-called non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for over 30 years. Recent advances in materials design has enabled solution processed organic solar cell devices based on PDI materials to reach power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) upwards of 12%.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted immense attention as energy conversion devices due to the ability to manufacture light weight and flexible modules, with low production costs, and short energy payback times.1–4 Traditionally, the photoactive layer of an OSC is fabricated by blending a conjugated polymer (electron donor material) and a fullerene derivative (electron acceptor material) in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). While these systems can achieve maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 12%,5–7 there are several drawbacks to fullerene-based acceptors (e.g., energy intensive synthesis, weak absorbance of visible light, morphological instability, limited tunability of electronic properties, and yielding devices with relatively lower operating voltages), which has hindered further PCE increases.8,9 Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), on the other hand, address many of the crucial barriers that prevented further improvements to OSC device efficiency by offering several key advantages (e.g. strong visible and/or NIR light absorption and tuneable energy levels to maximize photocurrent generation and operating voltages, respectively).7Fig. 1 features the structural evolution of some famous acceptors for OSCs.5,6,10–13 Adding the phenyl butyl methyl ester moiety to fullerene simultaneously increased material solvent solubility and material miscibility with donor polymers, thus leading to excellent OSC performance through improved processability and nanomorphology formation, respectively (Fig. 1a).5,6 Some first generation NFAs featured an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type architecture using basic organic conjugated building blocks giving moderate OSC performance.11 These designs laid the foundation for the development of record performing materials.10 Ring-fusion and use of highly electron deficient end capping units resulted in NFAs with excellent light absorption, rapid electron transport capabilities, and appropriate miscibility with donor polymers to give champion performance (Fig. 1b).10 Among the NFAs reported, the perylene diimide (PDI) chromophore has received significant attention with an evolution from monomers to sophisticated oligomers (Fig. 1c), with the field having been the subject of many reviews.14–19

The PDI chromophore possesses several enticing properties that render the unit a suitable building block from which to construct electron acceptors for OSCs, such as: (1) multiple grafting sites for structural modification, which can be used to tune LUMO energies and shift the absorption spectra to span the desired region; (2) high electron affinity, due to the strong electron-withdrawing imide groups; (3) high electron mobility, due to effective intermolecular electronic coupling originating from (quasi)planar structures; (4) excellent chemical, thermal, photo, and oxidative stability; and (5) atom-economical and safe syntheses.18,20
Using a single PDI chromophore and functionalizing at the ortho, bay, and/or imide positions of the molecule has afforded OSCs devices with PCEs as high as ∼5%.21–23 PCE is limited mainly due to strong intermolecular π–π stacking that leads to the formation of excessively large crystalline domains which, although facilitates charge transport, ultimately prevents efficient exciton dissociation.23 It was only recently reported that incorporating PDI into the core of the A–DA′D–A structural template could lead to record breaking PCEs of >12%.24 The high PCE of this A–DA′D–A system was attributed primarily to a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, which led to strong light absorption and delocalized frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Unlike previous monomeric PDI NFAs, intermolecular packing in the photoactive layer was dominated by the donor polymer, thereby greatly aiding with efficient exciton generation and dissociation.
Prior to the development of this A–DA′D–A motif, rational design principles for PDI-based acceptors largely focused on inhibiting over-aggregation, while maintaining the balance between the exciton dissociation and charge transport. An effective strategy to suppress over-aggregation was developed with the introduction of twisted PDI dimers, in which two PDI units are linked directly or by connecting fused conjugated bridges through the bay position(s).3,7 The coupling of strong optical absorption in the visible region, along with efficient charge generation and transfer, led to higher Jsc and PCE for OSCs devices. In addition, O, S, Se, and N heteroatoms have been incorporated in the opposite bay area of PDI units to affect geometry and optoelectronic properties.25–28 Notably the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) increased relative to non-annulated congener, assuring high OSC open-circuit voltage (Voc).3 It is important to note that in certain cases, over-twisting within PDI dimers might not be an effective approach to increase the performance of OSCs, owing to the development of overmixed/less pure domain morphology.29
Further, linking three or four or five PDI units to an aromatic core has yielded a series of PDI oligomers with three-dimensional (3D) molecular structure that facilitates the isotropic charge transport as in fullerene-based OSCs.30–32 Generally, 3D structures not only provide multidirectional charge transport, but also form uniform-blend morphology with nano-phase separation, thus resulting in an increase of both Jsc and Voc. Recently, a new ring-fusion strategy has proven efficient at reducing the over-twisting and promoting π–π stacking of the acceptors, thereby improving charge transport and increasing device performance.33–35 This strategy can raise the LUMO energy level of PDIs, thereby minimizing the energy loss and increasing Voc values. Another added benefit of the ring-fusion strategy is the resultant high molar absorptivity and increased Jsc, which has helped to push PCEs over 11%.13,54 It was also realized that in multiarray PDIs, the control on intramolecular π–π interactions between the adjacent PDIs plays an important role for efficient electron transport processes.13,36 Furthermore, the regiochemistry of the central core and the spatial interactions between PDIs in various constitutional isomers can also impact device performance.37,38
In general, the performance of most NFA based OSCs depends on the choice of donor material, processing conditions, and the parameters used for device fabrication. By screening these parameters, it is possible to optimize phase separation, phase size, and aggregate order. There are number of reviews detailing the mechanisms and structure/device properties of NFAs for OSCs and thus are not covered in this perspective.39–43 The main motive for this perspective is to highlight and discuss important PDI NFAs that have delivered high performance OSCs. In the first section of this perspective, an overview of molecular design/photovoltaic property relationships of high-end performing PDIs are outlined. In the following section, the promising results for various N-annulated PDIs are discussed in more detail. Further, we extend our discussion to how N-annulated PDIs can be future champion materials in the field OSCs. Concluding remarks, along with future perspectives and outlook, are discussed in the last section.
High performance PDI based non-fullerene acceptors
PDI monomers often suffer from over aggregation in the photoactive layer, due to strong π–π stacking, which can subsequently lead to micrometre-sized crystallites that prevent efficient exciton splitting at the donor/acceptor interface.44 The over aggregation problem has been addressed by incorporating sterically bulky alkyl or aryl groups at the N-imide positions, bay-positions, and ortho-positions of PDIs.15,45 In one report, a slip-stacked PDI was generated by introducing substituents at the ortho-positions (also termed headland).22 The best-performing acceptor in this series was obtained by adding a phenyl group at each ortho-position of PDI. Due to the steric hindrance of the substituents, a slipped stack of the PDI planes was observed. As a result, device PCEs up to 3.6% were obtained by combining with a wide bandgap donor polymer. In another report, four phenyl groups were appended to the bay region and a device PCE of 4.1% was achieved when using PTB7-Th as the donor polymer.46 Li et al. reported a PCE of 5.0% for devices based on a ortho-functionalized PDI, a new record for an acceptor with a single PDI core.47 After a long-time gap, a rapid development occurred with the introduction of twisted PDI dimers or bridged PDI dimers, higher order oligomers, and push–pull structures which lead to tremendous boosts in OSC device performance,3,18,24 which can be attributed to: (1) broad, intense and red-shifted optical absorption; (2) an increase in the LUMO energy; and (3) a reduction in aggregation within the BHJ.
One of the first examples of a PDI dimer for OSCs came from the Wang group. They constructed a dimer by directly linking two sulphur annulated PDIs at the bay position (SdiPBI-S, see Fig. 2, molecule 2.1). OSC devices were fabricated using the wide band gap polymer PDBT-T1.26 Molecule 2.1 possessed a dihedral angle of 80° between two PDI units, which is larger than the non-annulated analogue (67°). This twisted structure helped disrupt aggregation owing to steric repulsion between the adjacent PDI units. Incorporation of sulfur at the bay position helped increase the LUMO energy level, thereby leading to an increased Voc and high PCE values of 7.1% for resulting OSC devices. From the same group, even higher PCE was achieved by replacing sulfur with selenium (SdiPBI-Se, see Fig. 2, molecule 2.2).27 Since selenium has a larger valence electron cloud and is more easily polarized, it was expected to show better charge transport with greater electron-accepting ability than the sulfur annulated dimer. Moreover, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) helped elucidate that this molecule possessed fast generation of charges. A morphological study using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) suggested face-on orientation of PDBT-T1 and proper mixing with molecule 2.2, a higher electron mobility compared with their previous results was reported. By using 0.25% v/v 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in the solution during active layer film formation, they achieved the highest OSC device PCE (8.4%). It was also shown that Se-annulation helped increase the device Voc by raising the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, thereby limiting energy losses due to non-radiative recombination. Recently, the Wang group elucidated that hetero-annulation can lead to ideal D–A morphology by reducing exciton-dissociation energy and by favouring face-on orientation, which both lead to high OSC performance.48
 Fig. 2  Chemical structures of dimeric PDI acceptors for OSCs. 
A simpler PDI dimer (oo-2PDI, see Fig. 2, molecule 2.3) was synthesized by joining two PDI units together through the headland positions, resulting in slightly less steric strain between the PDI units. This reduction in strain led to a less twisted confirmation, which was beneficial for charge transport. A raising of the LUMO energy level improved the device Voc value. OSC devices based on oo-2PDI and the polymer donor PTB7-Th gave moderate performance (5.8%).49 Using solvent additive DIO (1% v/v) during film formation lead to high device PCE values (8.3%) with an impressive Jsc value of 18.79 mA cm−2. The high PCE value in this work can be attributed to the combined effect of appropriate energy level alignment and a favourable BHJ morphology. Efficient exciton dissociation occurred at the donor/acceptor interface was demonstrated by effective photoluminescence (PL) quenching.
Liu et al. introduced a spirobifluorene bridge between two PDI units (SF-PDI2, see Fig. 3, molecule 2.4).50 Initially for OSCs, it was considered that for efficient charge separation and transfer processes, the ΔELUMO between donor and acceptor should be ≥0.3 eV. However, in the device based on a P3TEA/2.4 photoactive layer, a small ΔELUMO of 0.05 eV was still able to provide ultrafast and efficient charge separation. Subsequently, an OSC with a remarkably high internal quantum efficiency (90%) and Voc (1.11 V) successfully pushed the device PCE to 9.5%. Importantly, this work provided a new approach to minimize the voltage loss from non-radiative recombination by reducing the driving force for charge separation. Further, the Nuckolls group prepared a conjugated oligomer by linearly fusing four PDI units (hPDI4, see Fig. 3, molecule 2.5), which exhibited a helix-type structure with broad and intense optical absorption from 300–650 nm.51 When blended with the commercially available polymer donor PTB7-Th, OSCs had efficiencies as high as 8.3%. They characterized the film morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and found that, for this system, a domain size of 20–40 nm was the ideal range for exciton dissociation and charge transport. Further, they noted from thermal analysis that there was only a very small change (0.2–0.3% decrease in efficiency) in PCE of OSCs after two weeks under ambient conditions.

Zhong and co-workers demonstrated a novel approach to tune the morphology and molecular geometry of a PDI dimer by utilizing the concept of electrostatic interactions.52 A fully fused PDI dimer F-2PDI-4F (see Fig. 4, molecule 2.6) was synthesized, in which the bay-positions of PDI were substituted with four fluorine atoms. Due to the F⋯F electrostatic repulsion, the PDI scaffolds in 2.6 lost planarity, creating a dihedral angle of 12.6° between the adjacent two naphthalene rings that make up the perylene unit. The controlled molecular aggregation in 2.6 provided an optimal morphology when blended with the highly crystalline donor polymer PBDB-T. A high device PCE of 9.0% was achieved with an impressive FF (66.8%). However, blending molecule 2.6 with a relatively less crystalline polymer PTB7-Th gave devices with moderate PCE of 5.2%. This work revealed that the performance of OSCs can be enhanced by selection of a highly crystalline donor/weakly crystalline acceptor pairs (and vice versa) benefiting the FF.

While the formation of PDI dimers can interrupt the extensive aggregation commonly seen with monomeric PDIs, charge transport can still be limiting. To facilitate the fullerene-like isotropic charge transport, three or more PDI units have been linked with a central core usually through the bay position via either single bonds or ring-fusion. Duan et al. investigated two novel PDI trimers, one based on an electron deficient 1,3,5-triazine core and the other on a benzene core. Ta-PDI (2.7a) and Th-PDI (2.7b) (see Fig. 5) were blended with polymer donor PTB7-Th separately to compare the performance in OSCs.33,53 The introduction of the electron deficient triazine core not only yielded a smaller bandgap and broader optical absorption, but it also increased the molar absorptivity relative to the benzene-based trimer. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method demonstrated nicely that electron and hole mobilities in PTB7-Th/Ta-PDI based devices were higher than PTB7-Th/Th-PDI based devices, leading to higher Jsc and FF in the OSC devices. Furthermore, due to absence of H–H steric hinderance due to the nitrogens in the triazine core, there was less distortion of the PDI units leading to better π–π stacking of PDIs and subsequent higher film crystallinity. This hypothesis was validated by X-ray diffraction characterization, which showed a shorter stacking distance for the Ta-PDI blend than for the Th-PDI blend. Also, by using density functional theory (DFT), they optimized the geometries of both trimers and showed that Ta-PDI had a less twisted molecular geometry. They calculated charge dissociation probability P(E,T) for the OSCs based on both trimers and found that a higher exciton dissociation occurred at the interfaces between PTB7-Th and Ta-PDI along with weaker bimolecular recombination. Owing to these properties, OSCs based on Ta-PDI had a higher PCE (9.1%) than those based on Th-PDI (5.5%).
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures of trimeric PDI acceptors for OSCs. 
Further, Wang and co-workers designed a trimeric PDI (TPH, see Fig. 5, molecule 2.8) similar to Th-PDI but with the three PDI units fused to the central benzene.33 This trimer had a three-bladed propeller configuration in which the PDI units exhibited strong π–π interactions with each other, as confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. With PDBT-T1 as the donor polymer and TPH as the acceptor, OSC devices showed an excellent PCE of 8.2% with high FF of 70.1%, and high Voc of 0.97 V. These results highlighted the importance of fused, rigid, and conjugated architectures for PDI based acceptors.
In the pursuit of even better performing OSCs devices, tetrameric PDIs were designed by connecting four PDI units to a central congested core. To demonstrate this method, the Yan group synthesized two PDI-tetramers, where one was ring-fused (FTTB-PDI4, see Fig. 6, molecule 2.9) and other a non-fused type structure.13 Ring-fusion helped to restrict the conformational freedom of 2.9 and showed many beneficial properties, such as an upshifted LUMO energy level and a blue-shifted spectra with stronger molar absorptivity. Consequently, high electron mobility and high Voc were observed in OSC devices. From DFT and SCLC data, it was surmised that a unique “double-decker” structure helped maintain a balance between hole and electron mobility, as well as influence a small domain size in the blend. Consequently, a P3TEA/2.9 blend gave an impressive device PCE (10.5%) with a small voltage loss of 0.53 V. Devices based upon the unfused tetramer gave lower PCE (7.1%) because of excessive intermixing with the polymer donor. Blend morphologies were optimized using 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) as the solvent additive. Moreover, the authors also directly compared P3TEA/2.9 blends with those of P3TEA/PC71BM and found that devices based on fused PDI tetramer showed far better performance than fullerene-based devices (PCE = 7.8%). This result provides motivation for researchers working with PDIs for further enhancing OSC performance. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the ring-fusion strategy could lead to OSC device stability. After 140 hours in continuous solar illumination (AM 1.5G) under ambient condition, P3ETA/2.9 based devices could maintain 84% of the initial PCE. In contrast, only 40% of the original PCE was achieved by devices utilizing unfused analogues of 2.9 as the electron acceptor.29
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of fused tetrameric PDI acceptors for OSCs. 
Recently, the same group highlighted the concept of controlling intramolecular π–π stacking by designing two isomeric PDI-tetramers, whereby the PDIs were connected at different positions (α- and β-positions) of a central naphthalene core.36 From DFT calculations, it was shown that the α-isomer (a-FTTN-PDI4, see Fig. 6, molecule 2.10) featured a “double-decker” geometry with an intramolecular π–π distance 3.6 Å. Meanwhile, the β-isomer featured a “head-to-tail” geometry with larger intramolecular π–π distance of more than 3.8 Å. UV-vis and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopic measurements proved the presence of a co-facially π–π interaction between the adjacent PDIs in 2.10; a feature which was absent in the β-isomer. Inverted architecture devices were fabricated with the donor polymer P3TEA and performance was optimized using a combination of solvent additive ODT and thermal annealing processing. Morphology studies of blend film by AFM and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) showed ordered molecular packing, with pure domains resulting in higher electron mobility and FFs. Of the two isomers, higher performing devices were reported using P3TEA/a-FTTN-PDI4 (PCE = 8.6%) vs.P3TEA/β-isomer (PCE = 7.4%). Impressively efficient charge separation was observed, despite a very high device Voc (1.15 V). Moreover, they also highlighted the thermal stability of the active layer of both isomers in the blended films by analyzing the plot of PCE vs. annealing time. From these experiments, it was observed that PCE values only changed slightly over a long period of heating, thus showing the thermal stability of PDI-based OSC devices.
Regiochemistry around the central core of PDI-tetramers also plays a vital role in boosting the device performances of OSCs.37 Two regioisomers of a PDI-based acceptor with four Se-annulated PDIs as outlying groups were constructed and OSC devices fabricated with polymer donor PDBT-T1. The optimized molecular geometry of (BPT-Se1, see Fig. 7, molecule 2.11) had a less twisted structure than the other regioisomer, and hence tighter intramolecular packing, that improved film crystallite quality. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements confirmed that BPT-Se1 showed a higher LUMO energy than the other regioisomer. The higher LUMO energy of 2.11 leads to a higher device Voc (1.05 V), while enhancements of device Jsc and FF were mainly attributed to favourable morphology in the blend film, leading to a PCE of 9.5%.
 Fig. 7  Chemical structures of tetrameric PDI acceptors (showing regioisomeric effect on performance) for OSCs. 
In another case, two regioisomeric PDI-based acceptors (oCP-FPDI4 and pCP-FPDI4, 2.12) based on a [2.2]paracyclophane central core were designed and synthesized.38 When complemented with donor polymer P3TEA, devices based on either PDI-based acceptor yielded high Voc of up to 1.16 V. Notably, the P3TEA/2.12-based devices achieved PCE of 9.0%, owing to the high Jsc and FF, which is significantly higher the P3TEA/ortho functionalized [2.2]paracyclophane-based device (PCE = 2.4%). Morphological studies revealed that one of the primary reasons for the higher performances of the pCP-FPDI4-based devices was the suitable nano-scale phase segregation formed in the photoactive blends, leading to suppressed charge recombination and more efficient charge dissociation. This work suggests that regulating the spatial orientation of PDIs in the constitutional isomers could be an effective approach to improve PCEs.
Yet another example highlighting the importance of regiochemsitry in PDI oligomer NFAs was recently reported by Wang and co-workers.54 Therein, the authors detailed the OPV performance of two corannulene ring-fused PDI pentamers, whose isomeric structures differed only in their molecular symmetry. Single crystal XRD analysis revealed that CRP-1 (Fig. 8, molecule 2.13) possessed D5h symmetry, while CRP-2 (Fig. 8, molecule 2.14) was C2v symmetric. A combination of GIWAXS and resonant RSoXS revealed that the higher molecular symmetry of 2.13 resulted in smaller domain sizes and better phase separation when blended with donor polymer P3TEA in the photoactive layer. These differences in photoactive layer morphology translated into higher OPV performance for 2.13 than 2.14 (PCE = 11.2% vs. 10.3%). Since both isomers possessed identical Voc (1.06 V), disparities in OPV performance between 2.13 and 2.14 were correlated to variances in charge separation efficiency, as evidenced by their different Jsc (15.48 vs. 15.13 mA cm−2) and FF (67.0 vs. 63.3%).
 Fig. 8  Chemical structure of corannulene pentameric PDI acceptors and a linear PDI acceptor based on A–DA′D–A structural template for OSCs. These molecular designs have led to the highest performing PDI based OSC devices. 
In a recent report by the Zhong group, a new NFA (PDFC, see Fig. 8, molecule 2.15) was prepared using A–DA′D–A structural template.24 This A–DA′D–A structural motif is very popular for NFAs, but had yet to be explored where A′ is a PDI.55–57 The OSC device using 2.15 as the acceptor with PM6 donor afforded outstanding PCE of 12.5%, with record-breaking fill factor (81.3%) for ∼120 nm thick active layer blend. The excellent photovoltaic properties were attributed to: (1) strong absorption by 2.15via the ICT effect; (2) delocalization of the FMOs leading to more efficient exciton generation and dissociation; (3) preferential face-on π–π stacking for both 2.15 and PM6 beneficial for the charge transport; (4) high and balanced hole/electron mobilities; and (5) well-matched HOMO–LUMO energy levels between donor polymer PM6 and acceptor 2.15. The PCE of the PM6/2.15 based device demonstrated a weak dependence on the active layer thickness; a PCE of 11.6% was obtained for active layer thickness of 300 nm and a PCE of 9.6% was achieved using a 570 nm-thick active layer. The retention of PCE with high active layer thickness is critical for the roll-to-roll fabrication of multi-layer OSC modules. While increasing the thickness of the active layer led to increased photon harvesting, the slight drop in PCE was attributed to suppression of the charge transfer cascade because of the longer pathways for free charges to travel and higher number of traps present for charge recombination to occur. Table 1 provides all metrical data for OSC devices detailed above.
Overall, PDI oligomers and push–pull structures perform best as NFAs in OSC devices among other PDI oligomers (dimers and trimers). One major requirement for high performing devices is to prevent over aggregation in the photoactive layer, while maintaining sufficient intermolecular π–π stacking to enable phase separation and efficient electron transport. The highest device PCEs were obtained using narrow gap polymers as the donor and solvent processing additives during active layer film formation. In particular, the donor polymer P3TEA appears an ideal partner for PDI NFAs. Despite all these advances, there is still room to enhance the performance of OSCs by not only designing new molecules, but also through optimized ink formulations, solution processing methods, and investigating new donor materials. With respect to the latter, the use of small molecule-based donors is an underdeveloped field of study.
N-annulated PDI based non-fullerene acceptors
Over the past few years, our research team has devised an atom-economical, high yielding, and scalable synthetic method for making a variety of N-annulated PDI (N-PDI) oligomers.28 N-annulation of the PDI bay region imparts different properties on the PDI chromophore than sulfur and selenium bay hetero annulation. Unlike other heteroatom annulated PDIs, N-annulation not only modulates the optical and electronic properties, but it also provides an extra site for functionalization.58–62 Functionalization of the annulated pyrrolic N-atom is accessible by simple SN2 chemistry. A variety of groups can be implemented at this additional grafting site which is helpful in ensuring a high solvent solubility and controlling thin-film nanomorphology.63–65 Integration of nitrogen in the bay area of PDI destabilizes the FMO energy levels equally, maintaining strong visible light absorption, while also enabling high Voc in OSC devices.66 These N-annulated PDIs have very good film forming/printing ability, rendering them highly suitable for large-area module fabrication.67–70
Our journey towards high performing OSCs using N-annulated PDI as NFAs started in 2016. A N-PDI dimeric scaffold (3.1, Fig. 9) was synthesized in high yield, on large scale, and without using column chromatography for purification.28 OSC devices were fabricated using several different polymer donors with N-PDI dimers with ethyl and hexyl side chains at the pyrrolic N-position. Hexyl-functionalization of the pyrrolic nitrogen afforded excellent solubility of the NFA in common organic solvents. For example, compound 3.1 has solubility >50 mg mL−1 in a range of common processing solvents such as chloroform and o-xylene. Initial inverse architecture OSC devices were developed using a blend ratio of donor and acceptor (P3TEA/3.1, 2:3) for the photoactive layer. Casting conditions were optimized [1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) + 2.5% v/v ODT] and a respectable device PCE of 7.5% was achieved with a remarkable Voc (1.13 V).
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of N-annulated PDI dimers for OSCs. 
A further series of N-PDI dimers having linear and branched alkyl chains appended at pyrrolic N-position (3.2a–h, see Fig. 9), to tune BHJ morphology, was reported.63PTB7-Th was chosen as a donor material for the photoactive layer because of its complementary absorption profile and electronic energy levels, commercial availability, and wide use for PDI based OSCs. Studying the optoelectronic properties of 3.2a–h in both solution and film highlighted the effect of these appended side chains. It was found that molecule 3.2h with branched 2-ethylhexyl side chains showed an additional prominent shoulder peak at 600 nm in the thin film absorption profile when cast from the green solvent 2Me-THF, which was absent in solution. This additional peak is due to strong aggregation in the solid state.71 Each dimer was blended with PTB7-Th and spin-cast from 2Me-THF solution. It was observed that 3.2h gave best OSC performance. Highest PCE reported for these systems was 6.5% with high Jsc (14.98 mA cm−2), high Voc (0.97 V) and reasonable FF (44.8%). Use of solvent additives [DIO or diphenyl ether (DPE)] during film formation were found to be critical in aggregating the PDI NFAs and giving top performance.
Beyond alkyl side chains, three benzyl-based side chains (benzyl, 4-fluorobenzyl, and pentafluoro-benzyl) were selected to create new efficient NFAs (3.3a–c, see Fig. 10), owing to the possibility of different intermolecular and π–π interactions as compared to alkyl chains.64 Compound 3.3a possessed similar energetics to those of alkylated N-PDIs, while fluorinated benzyl chains were found to stabilize the FMO energy levels. Two suitable polymers (PTB7-Th and QX1) were mixed with 3.3a–c and OSC device performance determined. It was found that when PTB7-Th was mixed with 3a, a maximum device PCE of 5.6% was recorded, while devices using QX1 gave PCEs of 5.8% for both 3a and 3b. A high Voc (ca. 1 V) was observed for all QX1 and N-PDIs dimer blends.

The N-PDI can be easily mono-brominated at the opposite bay position providing a useful synthon to construct PDI-spacer-PDI type NFAs. Several thiophene derived spacer groups (e.g. diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), thiophene, etc.) were introduced using atom-economical cross-coupling methods and allowed for tuning both optoelectronic and self-assembly properties in the solid state.72–79 Among all spacer groups, we have found that DPP gave OSC devices with the best performance. PDI-DPP-PDI (see Fig. 10, molecule 3.4) was synthesized by using direct (hetero)arylation (DHA) coupling protocol, a scalable and atom-economical cross-coupling method.72,73,80–82 Unique to compound 3.4 was that molecular reorganization within the film could be achieved using a simple solvent vapor annealing (SVA) step.72,73,83 Morphology evolution could be monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy. OSC devices using a PTB7-Th/3.4 blend gave low performance (PCE ∼ 1%) with as-cast active layers. Upon post-deposition processing of OSC devices using SVA, the performance increased 5-fold to 5.6%. The optimized processing condition leads to significant increase in both Jsc (6.40 vs. 11.32 mA cm−2) and FF (35 vs. 50%). In this report, the device air and light stability were monitored over many days. The device exhibited no changes in PCE after being exposed to air and ambient light for 7 days, while after 14 days the PCE dropped by only 10% with respect to its initial value. And after 35 days, the device still retained 70% of the original PCE. While the performance of the device decreased from 5.0% to 3.5% after 35 days, this loss in efficiency occurred primarily because of degradation of silver contacts. The active layer maintained its integrity, highlighting the suitability of PDI-DPP-PDI as an air-stable NFA.
Unique to this system was the appearance of a strong optical absorption band at 586 nm following SVA treatment. Such a feature was attributed to molecular reorganization of 3.4 and correlated to maximum device performance. Thus, this handle provided a simple method to screen donor polymers for pairing with PDI based NFAs. A series of low cost, variable band gap and scalable polymers (P3HT, PCDTBT, and PDTT-BOBT, see Fig. 13) were screened as alternatives to the expensive donor polymer PTB7-Th.80PDTT-BOBT was determined to be the most promising donor material under our optimized active layer processing conditions for pairing with PDI-DPP-PDI. After SVA treatment, the blend of PDTT-BOBT/PDI-DPP-PDI gave OSC devices with PCE of 4.4% along with high Voc (0.99 V) and moderate Jsc (9.89 mA cm−2). Importantly, device performance remained relatively consistent with increasing the device size (3 to 36 mm2), showing that the active layer blend may be ideal for large area device construction. Polymer screening was further extended to a range of BDT based polymers with all blends given reasonable OSC device performance, thus highlighting the ‘universal’ nature of this NFA.81
Expanding upon previously developed methodologies, we applied our DHA cross-coupling procedure to construct new tetrameric PDIs. First, we showed the effective use of DHA to facilitate an unprecedented four-fold substitution on a thiophene based core (IDT-NPDI4, see Fig. 11, molecule 3.5).84 Compound 3.5 has four N-PDI groups attached to the 2 and 3 positions of the terminal thiophene units of IDT. OSC devices were made using a PTB7-Th/3.5 active layer, processing in chlorobenzene with solvent additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN). Device efficiency reached 3.4%, largely because of the high Voc (>1 V). The low FF (35%) and Jsc (8–10 mA cm−2) were attributed to an imbalance in the electron and hole mobility, which was supported by SCLC calculations. Further, we reported on a novel saddle-shaped N-annulated PDI-tetramer (Th4PDI4, see Fig. 11, molecule 3.6) by optimizing the DHA cross-coupling reaction.79 OSC devices cast from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), using a PTB7-Th/3.6 photoactive layer, gave an initial PCE of 1.8%. The PCE of these devices was improved by screening a series of solvent additives, where the use of 3% (v/v) CN additive led simultaneously to an over 2-fold increase in Jsc (10.20 mA cm−2) and PCE (4.2%).

The development of near-IR absorbing NFAs has garnered much interest in recent literature85–87 because near-IR absorption allows these systems to generate more charge-carriers by better utilizing the available solar energy. Altering a materials optoelectronic properties can be achieved either by installing heteroatom-containing functional groups88–90 or by extending π-conjugation.91–95 We note that extending π-conjugation via the addition of another naphthalene unit between the imides (generating a so-called terylenediimide) has been shown to significantly red-shift the absorption profile relative to analogous PDI materials.91 However, the much more synthetically facile way to extend π-conjugation in PDI materials is through the functionalization of the bay positions.92,93 Our group has reported a series of PDI-core-PDI materials featuring N-annulated PDI through-conjugated to the spacer via acetylene linkers at the bay positions.94,95 Notably, an NFA featuring a BF2 formazanate spacer (BF2PDI2, see Fig. 12, molecule 3.7) exhibited strong post-deposition SVA effects, which facilitated near-IR absorption that contributed to a 2-fold increase in PCE. Table 1 provides all metrical data for OSC devices detailed above.

 Fig. 13  Chemical structures of polymer donors for OSCs discussed in this perspective. 
In summary N-PDIs as NFAs for OSCs can be easily synthesized using atom-economical coupling methods. These materials exhibit high solvent solubility owing to the additional sites for side chain installation. They also possess high device Voc (typically >1 V), due to the destabilized FMOs compared to related PDIs. One major benefit is the simple synthetic methods based on DHA cross-coupling that can be used for rapid access to a myriad of low cost and versatile NFAs in multi-gram quantities. This method is particularly valuable because it allows the atom-economical introduction of spacer groups between two or more N-PDIs in one step. These features make them promising candidates for efficient and commercially viable solar cells. Through thoughtful modification of chemical structures, including the spacer groups and functional groups at the pyrrolic N-position, a markedly higher Jsc, and FF along with high PCE could be achieved to deliver record OSC performance. Recent efforts have demonstrated OSC with photoactive layers based on the N-PDI NFA 3.2h can be readily processed using roll-to-roll compatible processing methods from greener solvents, delivering high Voc upwards of 1.3 V, and are effective at indoor light recycling.96–100

Conclusion
In this perspective, we have presented examples of high performing non-fullerene acceptors based upon the PDI chromophore. To date top molecular design involves four or five PDI units appended to a central core and a PDI introduced into the core of A–DA′D–A architecture. Through a combination of rational materials design, use of advanced synthetic strategies, morphological control, and device optimization the PCE of PDI based OSCs has eclipsed 12%. From materials design point of view alone, it is important that:
(1) NFA materials possess intense and broad optical absorption that is complementary to the absorption range of the donor material. Moreover, the electronic energy levels of the NFA and donor material should be carefully matched, in order to allow efficient charge extraction at the donor–acceptor interface. Ideally, the energy differences between the HOMOs and LUMOs of each component in the photoactive layer should be small enough to avoid large voltages losses from non-radiative decay processes, while still allowing for an effective electronic driving force for charge separation. PDIs exhibit strong visible light absorption complementary to that of the plethora of high-performance donor polymers (e.g.PTB7-Th), while new molecular designs have realized near-IR optical absorption allowing for pairing with wide-gap donor polymers (e.g.PM6). The energy levels of PDI can be easily modified either through the installation of heteroatoms and functional groups at the bay position or by exploiting ring-fusion between the π-conjugated core and PDI. Notably the LUMO energy level is easily destabilized allowing for high OSC open circuit voltages to be achieved.
(2) Nanophase separation can be achieved by balancing intermolecular and intramolecular π–π interactions in the blend, while avoiding over-aggregation of PDI. The extent of PDI aggregation can be hindered through use of either PDI–PDI dimerization or the insertion of a π-conjugated core. Although the synthetic diversity of π-conjugated cores is highly attractive from a materials design perspective, it is important to consider that the choice of π-conjugated core plays several crucial roles. Not only can it affect the degree of isotropic charge transport, the amount of intramolecular π–π interactions and the possibility of regioisomerism can drastically influence NFA domain formation. Ring-fusion (between PDI and core) should be viewed as a powerful tool to induce intramolecular π–π stacking by extending molecular planarity and reducing over-twisting leading to organized nano-scale morphologies.
(3) Stability of nanoscale morphologies in the active layer is one of the major hurdles that must be tackled for the objective of commercializing OSCs. Although PDIs are well-known for their pronounced chemical and thermal stabilities, there are relatively few studies detailing the long-term operational stability of PDI based OSCs. Recent studies have suggested that higher order PDI based NFAs with three or more PDI chromophores fused to a conjugated core lead to more isotropic structures that have greater interaction with polymer donors and are less prone to self-aggregation, subsequently leading to more thermally stable bulk-heterojunctions in the film. Clearly the stability of PDI-based OSCs is a topic for further studies.
A new avenue in PDI based NFA research is the utility of the N-annulated PDI. Our research team has developed N-PDIs that give OSCs with PCEs from 6–8% processed from green solvents using roll-to-roll compatible methods. Notable is the voltages >1 V commonly achieved. High open-circuit voltages are retained under low light intensity illumination which is ideal for indoor light recycling. Moreover, final materials based on N-PDIs as a building block can be synthesized in gram-scale by using simple and atom-economical synthetic routes. We believe that the correct combination of spacer groups (especially those are giving high PCE with PDIs) and N-PDI based building blocks could have the potential to deliver record-breaking efficiencies. Overall, the combined effect of simple synthetic routes, large structural diversity, high green solvent solubility, large area printability, and the ability to deliver OSCs with high open-circuit voltages should make the N-PDI an attractive materials to work with for future OSC development.

Table Content:
Vikas Sharma	Dr Vikas Sharma received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Maharshi Dayanand University Rohtak, Haryana (India). He received his Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, India. Here he developed rylene imide derivatives (perylene monoimides and diimides). These materials were applied in organic electronics as white-light emitters, sensors, and memory devices. He then moved to the research group of Prof. Gregory Welch at University of Calgary as a postdoctoral fellow. His research focussed on the synthesis of perylene diimide oligomers for organic solar cells.
Josh D. B. Koenig	Josh Koenig received his BSc (with honours) from the University of British Columbia in 2017. That same year, Josh started his PhD working under the supervision of Prof. Gregory Welch at the University of Calgary. Josh’s ongoing research into sustainable energy chemistry focuses on the synthesis of new non-fullerene acceptor materials for organic solar cells, as well as the development of molecular photo/electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to alternative fuels.
Gregory C. Welch	Gregory is a professor of chemistry at the University of Calgary. He runs a chemistry-centric research group working on sustainable materials for energy, health, and the environment. The team operates following a lab-to-fab model and translates small scale discoveries to real world applications. Innovative technologies emerging from the lab include indoor light recycling devices, flexible strip lighting for signage and safety, and low-cost sensors for health and food security applications. Gregory completed a PDF at UCSB developing small molecule semiconductors and Lewis acid dopants. He obtained his PhD from the University of Windsor where he established Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry.
