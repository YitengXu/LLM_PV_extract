    , Accepted 17th December 2016First published on 9th January 2017AbstractHigh quality perovskite films were fabricated from different precursor solutions containing a certain proportion of different hydrogen halides. An anti-solvent, toluene, was used here to isolate an intermediate from the perovskite precursor solution to reveal the impact of the hydrogen halides on the crystallization of perovskite films. From the Fourier transform infrared spectra we found that the stretch vibration of CO for pure N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) appeared at 1663 cm−1, which was shifted to a smaller wavenumber while reacting DMF with CH3NH3I (MAI) + PbI2 and MAI + PbI2 + HX (X = Cl, Br, I). Moreover, the appearance of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at low angles (near 8 degrees) as well as some small angle shift showed that the MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I) intermediate was formed, which benefits perovskite crystallization because the formation of the intermediate will avoid a rapid reaction between MAI and PbI2. What's more, the solubility of the precursor can be improved by adding hydrogen halides. By adding a certain amount of hydrogen halide into the one-step perovskite precursor solution we can obtain pin-hole free and almost no defect films. Transient absorption (TA) was carried out to investigate the charge recombination in intrinsic perovskite films and perovskite devices, giving some reasonable interpretations.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid semiconductors such as perovskites have attracted much attention1–7 because of their excellent properties, such as a long diffusion length of charge carriers, high mobility and easy solution processing which raise the probability of large-area production and flexible device applications. Many research studies were focused on the mechanism of perovskite solar cells,8–11 which helps us understand these solar cells deeply. There are several different solution methods for fabricating perovskite films like one-single step1 and two-step sequential deposition.4 In the one-step method, PbI2 and MAI are dissolved in DMF with the ratio of 1:1 without a subsequent handle, resulting in perovskite films consisting of many micrometer-sized rod-like crystal aggregates. The quality of perovskite films plays a significant role in perovskite photovoltaic devices, because the coverage degree and the homogeneity of the films are very important for the performance of perovskite solar cells. In the dendritic perovskite solar cells, hole transporting materials such as Spiro-OMeTAD makes contact directly with the mesoporous TiO2, which will lead to a low current density and fill factor, resulting in low photovoltaic conversion efficiency. The low coverage of perovskite films derived from PbI2 doesn't have the same solubility as MAI in DMF and under one-step conditions PbI2 and MAI will transform into perovskites very quickly so that the final films had an incomplete coverage and were inhomogeneous.4
Many efforts have been made to control the perovskite film crystallization process and optimize the precursor solution to improve the film quality. In the previous studies, hydrogen halides were chosen to add into the precursor solution to improve the quality of perovskite films.12–14 For instance, Zhao et al. found that with the use of HI to react with PbI2, HPbI3 was obtained to replace PbI2 as the origin of Pb, and fabricated highly uniform and excellent thermally stable perovskite films.12 Another group selected hydrochloric acid as an additive and added a small amount of it into the standard perovskite precursor solution in both one-step deposition and sequential deposition, producing pinhole free and high moisture tolerant planar MAPbI3 films.13 Xu et al. reported a method by adding certain concentrations of hydrochloride into the perovskite precursor solution (the hydrochloride was made from dissolving HCl gas into DMF), followed by a one-step deposition to obtain highly efficient and air-stable perovskite solar cells.14 In addition, some efforts15–17 to modify the two-step method had been made to fabricate high quality perovskite films and investigate the impact of the photoanode thickness on the perovskite solar cell performance. By adding hydrogen halides into the precursor solution, high quality perovskite films can be obtained and the performance of perovskite solar cells is improved apparently. However, the additive's impact on the precursor solution hasn't been discussed which is very important for following crystallization; here we utilize an anti-solvent to obtain the intermediate from the precursor solution to explore the process of crystallization.
In this work, we use a facile method to obtain compact and uniform perovskite films, by adding a certain amount of aqueous saturated halide acids (hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and hydroiodic acid) into the perovskite precursor solution followed by a single one-step spin-coating. A new intermediate can be isolated from the precursor solution, and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and XRD analysis we confirm the formula MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I). Nucleation theory and the charge transfer process, indicated by the time-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectrum, were used to give a theoretical explanation. The final films have a longer charge carrier lifetime and higher power conversion efficiency (PCE).
Experimental section
Sample preparation
To a freshly prepared 1 mL of perovskite DMF precursor solution consisting of 461 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of MAI were added a certain amount of HCl from 33 wt% hydrochloric acid, HBr from 48 wt% hydrobromic acid, and HI from 57 wt% hydroiodic acid, respectively. The solutions were spin coated on quartz glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 105 °C for 1 h. The final films were used for scanning electron microscopy, transient absorption and XRD measurements. Then we adjust the amount of acid from 2% to 10% of the volume of precursor solution to find the optimal addition amount.
Isolated intermediate
80 mg of MAI and 230 mg of PbI2 were dissolved in 0.5 mL of DMF, and after stirring for 1 h at room temperature, a certain amount of aqueous HCl, HBr and HI solution was added into the solution, respectively. Toluene was added into the completely dissolved solution. And then the precipitates were filtered and dried in a vacuum oven and used for FTIR spectroscopy and XRD measurement.
Device fabrication
461 mg of PbI2 and 159 mg of MAI were dissolved in 1 ml of DMF with stirring for 1 h at room temperature. The completely dissolved solution was divided into three portions and then an aqueous solution of HCl, HBr and HI was added in a volume ratio of 8%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The resulting solutions were spin-coated on the mesoporous layer by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1100 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s. The obtained perovskite films were then annealed at 105 °C for 60 min. After cooling to room temperature, the HTM layer was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s with a solution of Spiro-OMeTAD, which consisted of 73 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 17 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution and 8 μL of the Co(III)-complex in chlorobenzene. Finally, a gold layer with the thickness of 60 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation on top of the device to form the counter electrode.
Characterization
The SEM images of the films were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI Sirion 200, Netherlands) in combination with EDX. A UV-vis spectrophotometer (3900H Hitachi, Japan UV-Vis) was used to test the absorption of perovskite films from 450 nm to 800 nm. We obtained the static photoluminescence spectrum of the perovskite films using a fluorescence detector (QM400 and LaserStrobe, Photo Technology International, USA). X-ray diffraction (X'Pert Pro, Netherlands) Cu Kα beam (λ = 1.54 Å) was used to determine the crystal structure of the films and intermediate products. The FTIR spectral data of the intermediate products from 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1 were collected by using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (Thermo Fisher IS50R, USA). Transient absorption was carried out by using LKS.80 and LP.920 to analyze the charge recombination in intrinsic perovskite films and perovskite devices. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a 3A grade solar simulator (Newport, USA, 94043A) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. We obtained incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra by using a QE/IPCE measurement kit (Newport, USA).
Results and discussion
In the previous studies, based on the typical one-step method, low coverage and non-uniform films were obtained without any additives or solvent engineering.4 The SEM images of the perovskite films after adding a small amount of hydrogen halide into precursor solutions were obtained (Fig. 1), which indicate that with the addition of a certain amount of hydrogen halide, the quality of the perovskite films improved. The rod-like construction disappeared and is replaced by smooth and compact perovskite films. In addition, the cross-sectional SEM images of these perovskite films were also obtained and are shown in the ESI.† From the cross-sectional SEM images we found that the thickness of the films increased from 247 nm to over 300 nm after the addition of hydrogen halide into the precursor solution to fabricate perovskite films, and the thickest film was about 394 nm when HI was used as an additive.

In Fig. 2, the UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra of the typical one-step prepared perovskite films and the perovskite films prepared using the modified method are shown. The UV-vis spectra of the obtained films are shown in Fig. 2a, which indicate that typical MAPbI3 absorbs at 480 nm and 760 nm, respectively.18 The films prepared by the modified method showed a higher UV-vis absorbance than the ones prepared without any treatment, which is ascribed to higher film quality. We also found that the spectrum of the perovskite films with the addition of HBr showed an apparent blue-shift at 760 nm. The static photoluminescence of the perovskite films is shown in Fig. 2b and we found that once the HBr was added into the perovskite precursor solution, the obtained films showed an obvious blue-shift in the photoluminescence peak, indicating that the addition of HBr had a prominent effect on the perovskite films, even Br may be replaced by I to form MAPbI3−xBrx.19 We conducted Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and the result is shown in the ESI,† from which we can find that Cl is not residual in the film fabricated with HCl as additive. We suppose that HCl dissolves while annealing and disappears and the resulting films are MAPbI3. Under HBr conditions, a typical peak of Br in the spectrum appeared, which agreed with the UV-vis spectrum and the photoluminescence spectrum and we confirm that with the addition of HBr, a small amount of Br replaced I and MAPbI3−xBrx is formed.

The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 3, which also confirm that in our way the perovskite films formed, the strong characteristic peaks of (110), (220) at a 2θ of 14.1 degrees and 28.4 degrees clearly indicating that perovskite films contain the tetragonal phase.20 Furthermore, we found that after adding a certain amount of hydrogen halide into the precursor solution, the XRD intensity of the obtained films was higher than before, which means higher crystallinity.

To gain further insight into the hydrogen halide's impact on the perovskite films, we isolated the intermediate via pouring the precursor solution into an anti-solvent21 like toluene. We suppose that in the precursor solution MAI, PbI2, DMF and HX (X = Cl, Br, I) will form a new intermediate, MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I). The precipitate was characterized to verify our supposition. The XRD profiles of the intermediates are shown in Fig. 4, which implied that the intermediate phase was self-organized and highly crystalline in nature. Some other group reported that PbI2 is a layered semiconductor material, in which the interlayer spaces can be rapidly inserted with different guest molecules,22 leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the c axis. In previous work, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and MAI could coordinate with PbI2 to form a MAI–PbI2–DMSO complex, whose XRD analysis shows some low angle peaks around 9 degrees.14 In our work, the XRD peaks of the intermediate mostly appeared at low angles, indicating that the intermediate phase has a longer interplanar distance compared to PbI2. This is attributed to MAI and DMF which were inserted into PbI2 and a new complex MAI–PbI2–DMF was formed.
 Fig. 4  The XRD profiles of the isolated intermediate from different precursor solutions. (a) The full angle of XRD patterns. (b) The details of XRD patterns from 5 to 10 degrees. 
From the strong intensity peaks, we find that they appeared at around 8 degrees in Fig. 4b, which is different from the reported XRD peaks of MAI–PbI2–DMSO.21 In addition, compared to the intermediate obtained without any additive, the degrees were a little smaller, being ascribed to HX (X = Cl, Br, I) combined with PbI2 and the intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–HX (X = Cl, Br, I) formed. The interplanar distance became larger and the diffraction degree became smaller.
The interaction of MAI, DMF and HX (X = Cl, Br, I) with PbI2 was also confirmed by FTIR, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. During the isolation process, once the precursor was poured into toluene, we obtained the precipitate quickly in the absence of additive. On adding HX (X = Cl, Br, I) into the precursor, we obtained liquid products firstly. Then the product from the precursor containing HI became solid eventually and for precursors containing HCl and HBr the supernatant was removed and then more toluene was added to get solid products. In Fig. 5, the IR spectra of the product with and without additives are shown. The stretch vibration of CO appeared at 1667 cm−1 for pure DMF, and shifted to 1640 cm−1 for MAI–PbI2–DMF, 1655 cm−1 for MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHCl, 1658 cm−1 for MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHBr, and 1654 cm−1 for MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHI, respectively. What's more, close to 540 cm−1 there were some vibrations for the product with HCl and HBr, while no vibrations for MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHI and MAI–PbI2–DMF were observed, which can be ascribed to the fact that HCl and HBr existed and the condition of HI needed to be studied further. From the IR spectra, we know that once the hydrogen halide was added into the precursor solution, it will combine with the precursor and solvent to form a new intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I), which agreed with the results obtained from the XRD profiles of the intermediate.

Generally, solution precipitation proceeds in two steps: nucleation and crystal growth. When a solution reaches saturation nucleation takes place, and then the crystal growth.23 PbI2 and MAI have different solubilities in DMF and so the two sections have different growth rates.24 On the other hand, the reaction between PbI2 and MAI is very quick when the solvent is rapidly evaporating, which will lead to nonuniform films. There are two ways to obtain dense and smooth films, either by avoiding different growth rates such as improving the solubility of the precursor, or making the crystal growth process slow, such as by adding some additives to combine with the precursor and form the intermediate.25 In this work, three different hydrogen halides were added into the precursor solution to obtain compact and smooth films. The previous study revealed that the addition of an acid could improve the solubility of the solution through the enhanced solubility of the inorganic component.26 In addition, in the precursor solution there was a new intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I) formed, which favored crystal growth for the same proportion of the precursor and more nuclei can be formed. Besides, the formation of the intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I) would avoid the rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI because PbI2 combines with HX (X = Cl, Br, I) and forms the intermediate.
Accordingly, with the use of hydrogen halides as additives, the precursor, solvent and HX (X = Cl, Br, I) formed a new intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I). If we add more halide acid there will be some negative effects on the film because more haloid acid will bring in more water into the precursor solution, which is disadvantageous to the crystallization process. In order to investigate the optimal addition of hydrogen halides, we conducted an optimal experiment by adding 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% volume ratios of the precursor solution of three halide acids, respectively, and the SEM images of the resulting films are shown in the ESI.†
Two kinds of nanosecond-transient absorption measurements have been conducted to further confirm the performance of the films and investigate the charge carrier dynamics in the samples.
From the transient absorption spectra, the charge recombination in the films can be analyzed.27 After photoexcitation, the perovskite films absorb energy and electron–hole pairs are generated, the electrons transit to the conduction band and the holes are left in the valence band, then these excited charges will recombine via three ways. The electrons in the conduction band recombine with holes in the valence band directly, or the electrons will be trapped in the band gap or defects and then recombine with holes, and thirdly, the charge will recombine by the way of Auger recombination.28,29 In our experiment, the excitation energy was low and so there was no Auger recombination and we detected a bi-exponential decay curve. We utilized the bi-exponential function y = A1exp(−x/τ1) + A2exp(−x/τ2) to fit our results according to the equation: ΔOD(Δt) = A0 + Ae−Δt/τ(a)where τ1 and τ2 are the time constants, and A1 and A2 are the contributions from the relevant portions. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 6, and the lifetime and proportion are shown in Table 1.

We found that there were two processes at the decay curve which correspond to two different recombination processes.30 The fast decay could be attributed to the surface trap or defect non-radiative recombination,31 the lifetime of which is tens of nanoseconds, and we consider that the amplitude of the TA signal is in proportion to the number of defects. The slow decay is related to charge carrier recombination, the lifetime of which is about hundreds of nanoseconds, the recombination dynamics are shown in Fig. 7a. From the fitting results we know that with the addition of hydrogen halide we get a larger value of A due to the slow recombination lifetime, from 41.8% to 86.6%, which means that most charges were recombined directly, and there were less defects in the perovskite films, because of the smaller value of A for the fast decay part from 58.2% to 13.4% (Table 1), which was consistent with the SEM observation (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration of charge recombination in (a) perovskite films, and (b) TiO2/perovskite/Spiro device. 
In perovskite solar cells, after the charges are separated, the electrons were injected into TiO2 and the holes were transferred to Spiro-OMeTAD.28 The electrons in TiO2 could recombine with the holes in Spiro-OMeTAD which was not desirable to happen as the recombination is harmful to solar cells. Another TA experiment was carried out to detect this process. TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD was fabricated as the test sample, and Fig. 8 shows the TA responses of TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD with different perovskite films from different precursor solutions; the recombination route is shown in Fig. 7b. The wavelength of pump light is 500 nm and the wavelength of probe light is 1000 nm which monitors the holes in Spiro-OMeTAD.32 When there was no Spiro-OMeTAD, no TA signal at 1000 nm could be obtained. However, for the samples with Spiro-OMeTAD, we can obtain a decay signal which was very well fitted by a mono-exponential decay function. The charge recombination decay curves are shown in Fig. 8, and the lifetime constant was increased from 5–6 μs to 20 μs. From the above results it can be seen that, the recombination of the electrons in TiO2 with the holes in Spiro-OMeTAD can be suppressed in high-quality perovskite films, which was beneficial to determine the Voc of solar cells which we would show below.

Finally we added the hydrogen halide into the perovskite precursor solution and fabricated solar cells. The photovoltaic performance of these perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Effect of the additives in the precursor solution on the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI3 solar cells. 
With the addition of hydrogen halide, the PCE of the cells increased from around 10% to over 15%. The increase in the PCE was suggested to be related to the difference in the current density and fill factor which is in line with the results from SEM and TA measurements. Improving the quality of the films will lead to a higher current density and fill factor, because a high coverage of perovskite films could avoid the direct contact of HTM with TiO2 and suppress charge recombination. Uniform and smooth films have few defects and trap states. From the PCE of these solar cells we found that HCl and HI can improve the PCE more while HBr has little effect on the PCE, and HI is regarded as the best additive in our experiment. The champion cell fabricated from three different additives is shown in Fig. 10a. Once HI was added, the PCE was up to 15.21%, and when HCl and HBr were added, the PCE was 14.49% and 13.52%, respectively. The IPCE is also shown in Fig. 10b, which is in agreement with our current density from the previous PCE test.

Conclusions
We fabricated high quality perovskite films through a one-step method with addition of a certain amount of hydrogen halide. In this method, we added a certain proportion of hydrogen halide saturated aqueous solution into the typical perovskite precursor (1:1 molar ratio MAI and PbI2) solution, followed by a one-step method. From the previous study, we know that hydrogen halide has an effect on the solubility of the perovskite precursor, and here we found that they can form the intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMF–xHX (X = Cl, Br, I), which could avoid the quick reaction between the two precursors to form perovskites, so that we can obtain uniform and dense perovskite films. With the addition of additives we increased the PCE from near 10% to over 15%, and the following TA experiments gave theoretical support that high quality perovskite films had a longer lifetime constant and charge recombination was suppressed. We also found that HCl and HI have an apparent effect on the perovskite films while HBr has little effect, but Br can replace I to form MAPbI3−xBrx. The conclusions from the SEM, XRD, and TA and PCE results are consistent with each other.
