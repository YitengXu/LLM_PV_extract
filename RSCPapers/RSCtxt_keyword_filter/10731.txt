    , Accepted 13th May 2020First published on 15th May 2020AbstractControlling the orientation of the dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface needs extensive attention for improving the photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The suppression of the charge recombination and self-aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface also plays a vital role in the improvement of cell efficiency. In this report, based on the bi-anchored structure containing N-alkyl-attached 1,8-naphthalamide derivative as the donor system and spiroBiproDOT as the π-spacer, an organic dimeric dye (D-Dye) was designed and synthesized by Suzuki coupling, followed by Knoevenagel condensation. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.1% with a Voc and Jsc of 0.70 V and 14.6 mA cm−2, respectively, was achieved for the DSSC employing D-Dye. A monomeric dye (M-Dye) was also synthesized and the resultant cell efficiency of 4.85% was achieved with Voc and Jsc of 0.67 V and 9.93 mA cm−2, respectively, which was 33% lower than that of its dimeric analogue (D-Dye). The photo-physical experiment was carried out for both organic dyes to understand their light absorption characteristics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance measurements were also obtained to rationalize the better photovoltaic performance of DSSCs employing the dimeric D-Dye, which was due to the effective suppression of the charge recombination and self-aggregation of dye molecules. The co-adsorption of D-Dye (0.4 mM) with N-719 (0.4 mM) in the ratio of 10:1 v/v (D-Dye:N-719) further enhanced the cell efficiency to 8.34% (Voc of 0.77 V and Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2).
1. Introduction
In the last three decades, the photovoltaic technology has become an increasingly attractive field incorporating various applications such as energy storage, power generation, digital technology, and energy conversion by the progressive optimistic research and exploration of this subject. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have also reached a higher pitch in energy storage and conversion and are attracting more attention due to their ease of construction in a limited budget with high efficiency of energy conversion. However, it is still a matter of research to develop solar cells into a cheaper and business class product with higher current conversion efficiency. In 1991, O’Regan and Grätzel1,2 first introduced a conversion solar cell with moderate current conversion by employing an inorganic ruthenium-based sensitizer,3–5 a titanium metal oxide semiconductor, a redox electrolyte, and a transparent conducting electrode.6 The maximum current conversion efficiency of 7.12% was achieved.7 Nowadays, the research is more focused on the mechanism such as interfacial charge transfer, charge recombination, dye regeneration, and dye aggregation in DSSCs.8,9 Nonetheless, the main disadvantages of DSSCs employing an inorganic ruthenium-based sensitizer include purification difficulty, high cost, and limitation in tailoring the absorption band of the sensitizer within the solar spectrum. Organic sensitizers have become a good competitor because of their low-cost purification process as well as the flexibility of tailoring the absorption band in the solar spectrum.5,10 Many studies have been carried out by engineering the design of the sensitizer (dye) for prohibiting charge recombination,11,12 dye aggregation, reinforcing dye regeneration,13,14 charge injection, and covering a broader absorption band15–25 in the solar spectrum. The above physical parameters are the influencing factors in the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, such as short-circuit photo-current (Jsc) and open-circuit photo-voltage (Voc). Among the inorganic dyes, the metal complex dye of zinc with a porphyrin ligand has achieved the highest (13%) power conversion efficiency using a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte to date.26 On the other hand, the maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.6% was achieved by fabricating a solar cell using the triazatruxene dye as the sensitizer.27 For better light harvesting efficiency, the minimum requirements are high molar absorptivity concomitant with strong intramolecular charge transfer.28 The optical and electrochemical properties of an organic dye are also influenced by intramolecular charge transfer.29 Based on these above facts, it is very essential to engineer the structures of organic dyes, so that they can harvest solar light more efficiently. The general structure of an organic dye with D–π–A and D–A–π–A configuration showed better light harvesting capacity in between the visible and far-red region of the solar spectrum.30,31 However, organic dyes containing phthalocyanine, porphyrin, and polymethine showed higher performance for light harvesting of the NIR region.32–35
Dye aggregation and charge recombination36 play a vital role in influencing the photon to current conversion efficiency.14,37,38 The resultant molecular dipole arrangement of the dye molecules triggered the broadening and shifting of the absorption spectra after binding onto the TiO2 surface.14 It was reported that, upon binding on the TiO2 surface, the head-to-head and head-to-tail arrangements are responsible for the hypsochromic (H-type) and bathochromic (J-type) shifts of the dye in the solar absorption spectrum.39,40 These arrangements of dye molecules, based on resultant dipole, induced dye aggregation in their vicinity, which in turn stimulated charge injection and charge recombination.
Various methodologies have been developed to prevent dye aggregation and charge recombination based on molecular structure engineering of the dye moiety.41–45 Among these, two processes are much more convenient for preventing dye aggregation. First of all, the use of a foreign adsorbent such as CDCA or DCA can be helpful in prohibiting dye aggregation.46–49 Separation of the dye from its neighboring dye by using a cyclodextrin cavity is also helpful and can be explained by host–guest mechanism.50 Secondly, the introduction of a bulky group in the chain of the donor moiety or π-spacer side also makes an impact in controlling dye aggregation and charge recombination.51,52
Other methods have been reported in which dye aggregation and charge recombination were controlled efficiently by dimeric dyes compared to their monomeric units. Due to the efficient prevention of dye aggregation and charge recombination, the photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit photo-current or open-circuit photo-voltage of the dimeric dyes were significantly increased compared to their monomeric counterparts. The maximum probability of charge injection towards the conduction band of TiO2 also increased due to the presence of di-anchoring group bound to the semiconductor surface.53–55
A molecular arrangement based on the di-anchoring structure can develop more a compact packing of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. This tendency of molecular arrangement of the dye may reduce charge recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 (CBTiO2) to the redox electrolyte. As a result of the proper orientation on the TiO2 surface, the use of dimeric di-anchoring dye can enhance charge injection by inhibiting dye aggregation and charge recombination.56–62 The bridge that connects the two units in a dimeric dye may be aliphatic or aromatic. This bridge also connects the donor or spacer moiety. The length and the molecular property of the bridge dominate the molecular arrangement and the grafting orientation of the dye unit on the TiO2 surface. This auxiliary effect from the bridge unit can also affect the photovoltaic parameters of the organic solar cell.14,38 Apart from the aliphatic and aromatic bridge unit, a spiro-structured molecular bridge is also incorporated for connecting the two monomeric units in a dimeric dye for better charge passivation. It was reported that the charge passivation of the seven-membered spiro configuration was much better than the five-membered spiro moiety because of the flexibility of the dihedral angle in between the two connected cyclic conformations through sp3-carbon.14 Nonetheless, this has become an additional factor for the proper orientation of dimeric dye molecules on the TiO2 surface, which in turns reinforces the efficient charge injection. It was postulated that the resultant dipole moment of the dimeric dye is higher than that of its analogous monomeric unit, which helps in uplifting the CBTiO2. This uplifted CBTiO2 leads to an increase in the Voc of the solar cell.14,37
In this study, the dimeric dye (D-Dye), in which two monomeric units containing 1,8-naphthalamide connected through a π-spacer, 2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spirobi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine] (spiroBiProDOT), was synthesized and characterized for DSSC applications. In spiroBiProDOT, two seven-membered cyclic chains connected through the sp3 carbon were selectively incorporated for better charge passivation and charge injection. In order to obtain strong intramolecular charge transfer, 1,8-naphthalamide was included and attached with the spiroBiProDOT spacer. For comparison, the monomeric dye (M-Dye) was synthesized and characterized with respect to the photo-physical studies and photovoltaic parameters. The dimeric D-Dye showed a higher efficiency of 7.1% (Voc of 0.7 V, Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2), whereas the monomeric M-Dye was able to achieve 4.85% efficiency (Voc of 0.67 V, Jsc of 9.93 mA cm−2) for the cells without using any mask. The photo-physical and electrochemical properties of both the dyes were measured to understand their working mechanisms in the DSSC operation.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Materials and reagents
Reagents and solvents were acquired from Sigma Aldrich, ACROS organic, SHOWA, Matrix Scientific, TCI, and Alfa Aesar and were used without any further purification. Precursors 1,63 2,63 4,14 7,14 and 814 were synthesized by known procedures from reported articles. All the moisture and oxygen sensitive reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Dry toluene was received from Sigma Aldrich Company and was used carefully under inert atmosphere. SpiroBiProDOT (2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spirobi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]) was synthesized from 3,4-dimethoxy thiophene.38 The solvents utilized for the purification process were reagent grade and used after proper distillation.
2.2. Dye characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded on Varian 400 MR and Varian Mercury Plus 400 spectrometers, using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm (parts per million) with respect to the reference TMS (0 ppm) shift. Absorption spectra were recorded on a HITACHI/U-2900 (U-2900, spectrophotometer). Differential Pulse Voltammetric (DPV) analysis was performed on a CH instrument (CHI611E). Platinum wire and platinum foil were used as the working electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The spectra were recorded with the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in method involving the solvent mixture of CH2Cl2 and EtOH (1:3 v/v) using 0.1 M TBAP (tetrabutylammonium perchlorate) as he supporting electrolyte, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, and Fc+/Fc as the redox couple in the potential window of 0 to 0.55 V.
2.3. Assembly of DSSC
The synthesized organic dimeric D-Dye (0.4 mM) and monomeric M-Dye (0.4 mM) were solubilized in a solvent mixture of EtOH and CH2Cl2 present in the solvent ratio of 3:1. Commercially available N719 dye (0.4 mM, D719, Ever Light Chemical Industrial Co., Taiwan) was solubilized in EtOH solvent. A TiO2 photoanode was immersed into the organic dye solution for 24 h. The dipping time was reduced to 12 h for immersion in the D-Dye and N719 dye mixture. ITO glass (1.1 mm thick, Pilkington TEC 7, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd, Japan), which was used as the substrate of the counter electrode, was consecutively rinsed out with 4% glass cleaner (PK-LCG545, Parker, Japan), followed by DI water for half an hour in an ultrasonic bath. Two-step dip-coating process was used to prepare poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-capped Pt nanoclusters as the catalyst on the surface of ITO glass.3,64 Firstly, the ITO-glass substrate was immersed in a 2% conditioner (ML371, OM Group) at 70 °C for 5 min and excess residual conditioner was washed out with DI water. Secondly, the ITO glass substrate was again immersed in PVP-capped Pt solution at 40 °C for 5 min, followed by washing with DI water, drying by an air gun, and sintering in an oven at 325 °C for 30 min, chronologically.
The dye-adsorbed photoanode was assembled with the PVP-capped Pt counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion while sealing with a spacer (25 μm-thick Surlyn film) using a hot press at 115 °C for 10 s. The redox electrolyte (I−/I3−) was prepared from 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.2 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.2 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile/valeronitrile in the volume ratio of 85:15 and injected into the space gap between the photoanode and the counter electrode through predrilled pin holes in the counter electrode. Finally, the assembled pin holes of the laboratory scale solar cells were sealed with a UV tape.
2.4. Characterization and photovoltaic measurements
The characterization and photovoltaic measurement of the assembled cells were carried out under AM 1.5G (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar simulator (YSS-E40, Yamashita Denso Corp., Japan). A mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 or 0.25 cm2 was pasted on the illuminated side of the constructed solar cell to control the light above the illumination area. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) characterization of the fabricated assembled solar cells was carried out with the help of a cell QE/IPCE measurement system (QE-3000, Titan Electro-Optics Co., Ltd, Taiwan). The charge transfer properties through different interfaces of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte were characterized by electron impedance spectroscopy (operated with an AC current with 10 mV amplitude within the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz) with the help of a potentiostat instrument (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab B.V., Netherlands) with 0.7 V applied bias in dark condition.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Dye design and synthesis
The dimeric dye (D-Dye) and its monomeric counterpart (M-Dye) were designed and characterized to examine the intramolecular charge transfer, controlled dye aggregation, charge recombination, and the proper orientation of the dye molecules bound to the TiO2 surface. The molecular structures of the SpiroBiProDOT spacer, D-Dye, and M-Dye are presented in Fig. 1. The spacer unit (SpiroBiProDOT) introduced in the dimeric D-Dye maintained a specific distance in between the two monomeric dye units to prevent molecular aggregation due to intramolecular and intermolecular dye–dye interaction. It is reported that the flexibility with respect to the dihedral angle in between the two thiophene units65 in the SpiroBiProDOT moiety by substitution with a different substituent benefits the charge passivation throughout the constructed cell. The introduction of the butyl chain in the donor moiety can also be helpful to increase the solubility in most common organic solvents. Simultaneously, the presence of two anchoring carboxylic groups also enhances the efficiency of charge injection towards CBTiO2.

The synthetic scheme for the preparation of the M-Dye is shown in Scheme 1. Precursor 2 was synthesized from the condensation reaction of 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride with 1-butamine, followed by the Pd-catalyzed borylation reaction with 78% yield. Precursor 5 (5-bromo-3,4-dimethoxythiophene-2-carbaldehyde) was synthesized from the regioselective Vilsmeier–Haack formylation reaction, followed by the bromination reaction with NBS. The monomeric M-dye was successfully synthesized with 65% yield by employing Suzuki coupling between precursor 5 and precursor 2, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid.

3.2. Photo-physical properties
To examine the optical properties of the dye molecules, the UV-Vis absorption spectra and the emission spectra were recorded using dichloromethane and EtOH (1:3 v/v) as the solvent mixture. The absorption spectra of the dye molecules after binding on the TiO2 surface were also recorded. The excitation wavelength was decided based on the absorption maxima in the absorption spectra. The observed spectral data are summarized in Table 1. In the solvent mixture, D-Dye showed two major peaks in the absorption spectra, where the two peaks with the absorption maxima at 342 nm (sharp) and 501 nm (broad) corresponded to the π–π* transition of the 1,8-naphthalamide group and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, respectively (Fig. 2b). A similar phenomenon was also observed for the M-Dye (Fig. 2a). The absorption maxima was observed for the two peaks at 337 nm (sharp) and 460 nm (broad), which corresponded to the π–π* transition and ICT, respectively, for the dye molecule. The broad absorption peak in the range between 400 nm to 650 nm was covered by the dimeric D-Dye, whereas the monomeric M-Dye covered was from 400 nm to 550 nm in the UV-Vis spectra. This important observation indicates that the intramolecular charge transfer of the dimeric D-Dye is much faster than that of the monomeric M-Dye in the solar spectra. This red shifting absorption spectra (corresponding to the ICT band) are 64 nm and 24 nm higher as compared to the D1–D1 dimeric and D1 monomeric dyes.14 The emission maxima of 667 nm and 587 nm were observed for the D-Dye and M-Dye at the excitation wavelength of 550 nm and 500 nm, respectively.

In order to understand the effect of dye aggregation after binding on the TiO2 surface, the UV-Vis spectra were also recorded for the dye molecules on a transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 film (Fig. 2c). It was observed that both the dye molecules showed a red shift after binding on the TiO2 surface compared to those in the solvent mixture. The absorption maxima were observed at 545 nm (broad) and 519 nm for the D-Dye and M-Dye, respectively. This red-shifted spectrum of 43 nm for D-Dye and 59 nm for M-Dye clearly indicates the possibility of J-aggregation of the dye molecules after binding on the TiO2 surface.66–68 The molar extinction coefficient of 3.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 was calculated for the dimeric D-Dye, which was higher than that of its monomeric analogue M-dye, 2.18 × 104 M−1 cm−1, thus confirming that the dimeric dye is better for light harvesting. Light harvesting efficiency was also compared (Fig. 2d) for both the dyes, revealing that the D-Dye covered a broader absorption range (Δλ = 180 nm) compared to that of the M-Dye (Δλ = 120 nm). D-Dye and M-Dye from the TiO2 electrodes were desorbed using the aqueous solution of HCl (0.1 M, EtOH/H2O, 1:1). The amount of dye loading of 5.39 × 10−8 mol cm−2 and 3.38 × 10−8 mol cm−2, corresponding to the M-Dye and the D-Dye were calculated, respectively.
This result also supports the better light harvesting efficiency of the dimeric dye compared to its monomeric counterpart.
3.3. Electrochemical studies
The differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) experiments were carried out for both the dye molecules to analyze the electron injection from the low unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) state of the dye molecule to the CBTiO2 as well as the dye regeneration after getting electrons from the redox couple (I−/I3−) by the oxidized dye in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) state. Throughout the experiments, the dye molecules were solubilized in the mixture of EtOH and CH2Cl2 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3a). The HOMO of the D-Dye and M-Dye was at −5.09 eV and −5.04 eV, respectively, as calculated from the oxidation peak of DPV. On the contrary, LUMO was calculated from the band gap energy level (Eg/opt) and the HOMO energy level (EHOMO). The LUMO of D-Dye and M-Dye was calculated as −3.02 eV and −2.7 eV, respectively (Table 1). The energy level of the I−/I3− redox couple and CBTiO2 was reported to be −4.9 eV and −4.2 eV, respectively.37,38 From this experimental result, it was observed that the EHOMO of both the dye molecules was lower than the energy level of the I−/I3− redox couple (−4.9 eV). At the same time, the ELUMO of both the dyes lie above the energy level of CBTiO2 (Fig. 3b). The energy level positions of the HOMO and LUMO of both the organic dyes encourage efficient charge injection as well as dye regeneration. However, there is a significant potential loss of 1.2 eV for D-Dye and 1.5 eV for M-Dye, whereas the minimum potential of 100–150 mV is required for efficient electron injection from the LUMO of the dye to CBTiO2.

3.4. Electron density distribution of D-Dye
Molecular simulation was performed for D-Dye and M-Dye by using ChemDraw 3D 19.0 modified version and the energy calculation results are reported in Table 1. EHOMO and ELUMO of D-Dye were found to be −5.26 eV and −3.29 eV, respectively. On the other hand, EHOMO of −5.19 eV and ELUMO of −2.98 eV were found in case of the monomeric M-Dye. This energy minimization study also supported the energy calculation results obtained from the DPV measurement. To understand the electron density distribution throughout the designed dye, molecular simulation was also performed for D-Dye by using the aforementioned software. As shown in Fig. 4, maximum electron density was found on the thiophene spacer unit and the 1,8-napthlamide unit corresponding to the EHOMO and EHOMO−1 energy state, respectively. On the contrary, the maximum electron cloud was observed on the cyanoacrylic acid moiety and partially on the thiophene unit corresponding to the ELUMO and ELUMO+1 energy state, respectively. This electron distribution throughout the dye molecule is favourable for efficient photo-induced charge separation and due to the enhanced anchoring effect by the two anchoring groups, the degree of electron injection to the TiO2 electrode was significantly enhanced.

3.5. Photovoltaic studies
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the cells based on the monomeric and dimeric dyes were carried out under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight. The photovoltaic parameters corresponding to the J–V characteristics are shown in Table 2. The photovoltaic measurements were carried out with or without using a mask (aperture area: 0.16 cm2 and 0.25 cm2). The photovoltaic studies were categorized in three different formats. Firstly, a rationalized comparison was carried out in between the dimeric D-Dye and its monomeric M-Dye by using a 0.25 cm2 mask. The maximum cell efficiency of 6.8% with Voc of 0.7 V and Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2 was observed in case of the dimeric D-Dye (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, 4.7% cell efficiency with Voc of 0.65 V and Jsc of 9.64 mA cm−2 was achieved for the monomeric M-Dye (Fig. 5b). Secondly, the mask area was changed from 0.25 cm2 to 0.16 cm2. In this condition, the photovoltaic parameters gradually decreased for both the monomeric and dimeric dye. The maximum cell efficiency of 5.1% (Voc of 0.71 V and Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2) and 3.6% (Voc of 0.63 V and Jsc of 8.5 mA cm−2) was achieved for D-Dye and M-Dye, respectively. It was found that the Jsc of D-Dye is 28% (3.86 mA cm−2), which is higher than that of the M-Dye using a 0.25 cm2 mask. A similar result was also obtained by using a 0.16 cm2 mask; nearly a 1 mA cm−2 increase was found in case of the dimeric dye compared to its monomeric analogue. This observation clearly indicates that the charge injection efficiency of the dimeric unit is higher due to the presence of two anchoring groups as well as the proper orientation of the dye molecules. This proper orientation of the dye molecules can also increase charge passivation throughout the cell, which in turn increases the charge injection efficiency. The open circuit photo-voltage of D-Dye showed an increase of about 50 mV to 60 mV compared to that of the M-Dye in both the measurements (by using 0.16 cm2 or 0.25 cm2 area of the mask). Two major factors were reported for modulating the open-circuit photo-voltage of the constructed solar cell. Among them, one is the reduction of charge recombination. The second one is the up-shifting of the conduction band of TiO2 by increasing the resultant dipole moment of the adsorbed dyes on the TiO2 surface. Upon binding on the TiO2 surface, the dimeric dye achieved higher dipole moment due to the presence of two monomeric units connected by a spiro-spacer. In this dipolar rearrangement, the most relative negative dipole was attained by the cyanoacrylic acid group after binding on TiO2. Therefore, the electron cloud density on the anchoring side is much higher in D-Dye than in the M-Dye. The more negative cloud on the anchoring side also increases the positive pole on the 1,8-naphthalamide group, which is far away from the anchoring group. This kind of charge distribution influences the dipolar direction from negative to positive. The significance of this charge distribution phenomenon change from negative to positive direction can influence the induced up-shifting of CBTiO2, which in turns increases the photo-voltage, as described in eqn (1).69–74 ΔCB = −qμnormalγ/εoε(1)where −q belongs to electronic charge. The dye surface concentration is measured and termed as γ. The dipole moment of the adsorbed dye bound on TiO2 is termed as μnormal. The di-electric constant of the monolayer and the permittivity of the vacuum are denoted as ε and εo, respectively. From the above equation, it may be postulated that the increase in the resultant dipole moment (μnormal) of the D-Dye due to the presence of two monomeric dye units connected by the spiro spacer generally enhanced the photo-voltage of the cell, by up-shifting the conduction band of TiO2.

The overpotential of the constructed cell may increase without using any mask.75 As shown in Fig. 5c, the maximum efficiency of a cell without using any mask reached 7.1% (Voc of 0.7 V and Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2) and 4.85% (Voc of 0.67 V and Jsc of 9.93 mA cm−2) for the D-Dye and M-Dye, respectively. This trend is also similar to the photovoltaic performance using different area of masks. However, a minimum amount of the improved photovoltaic performance in both types of cells employing D-Dye and M-Dye without using any mask may be due to the non-restriction of over-potential. In the absence of any co-adsorbent such as CDCA, the D-Dye (with 0.25 cm2 area of mask) showed a significantly higher Voc of 0.70 V compared to the dimeric D1–D1 dye (Voc of 0.57 V, without mask). This result also indicated a significant enhancement in the resultant dipole moment of the D-Dye, which could uplift the conduction band of TiO2 more as compared to the D1–D1 dye.14
Thirdly, another important cell fabrication was carried out, by measuring the photovoltaic data with the co-adsorption of the mixed inorganic N-719 (0.4 mM) dye with the organic dimeric dye (D-Dye, 0.4 mM) in the 1:10 volume ratio (Fig. 5d) on the TiO2 surface. The maximum cell efficiency of 8.34% (Voc of 0.77 V and Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2) was achieved. On the other hand, for the N-719 dye, the maximum cell efficiency of 8.26% (Voc of 0.76 V and Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2) was achieved. The increase in the cell efficiency from 8.26% (single adsorbent of N-719) to 8.34% (co-adsorbent of N-719 and D-Dye) implies that the organic dimeric dye is capable of preventing the dye aggregation of N-719 for better molecular adsorption. On the other hand, the co-adsorption of the N719 dye with D-Dye formed a tightly packed monolayer of these two sensitizers rather than the N719 dye alone. This closely packed monolayer adsorbed on TiO2 formed an insulated barrier against the back electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the I−/I3− electrolyte.76–79 This unwanted redox process was retarded strongly by the presence of the long N-alkyl chain attached to the 1,8-naphthalamide moiety of the D-Dye. The reduction in the dark current enhanced the open circuit photo-voltage (Voc). From Table 2, a 10 mV enhancement in Voc (0.77 ± 0.003 V) for the co-adsorbed N719 and D-Dye compared to the N719 dye (0.76 ± 0.004 V) alone was observed. The increased Voc played a vital role in the enhancement of cell efficiency. The photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the M-Dye and D-Dye was measured as shown in Fig. 6(a). On careful observation, more than 70% of IPCE in the region between 450 nm to 600 nm for D-Dye was observed; however, there was a sharp decrease in the IPCE by about 55% in the same area covered by the M-Dye. At the same time, a broad absorption spectrum in the region between 450 nm to 650 nm was observed for the dimeric dye compared to its monomeric analogue. This broader IPCE spectrum for the D-Dye also supported the result of enhanced short-circuit photo-current density of D-Dye in comparison with M-Dye.

3.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To justify the increased open-circuit photo-voltage, impedance analysis was carried out for both D-Dye and M-Dye. The electrochemical impedance spectra of both the spiro-dyes were recorded for the DSSC devices under a forward bias of 0.7 V in the dark condition. The Nyquist plots of both the dyes are shown in Fig. 6(b). In a typical DSSC Nyquist plot, there are three semicircles associated with the charge transfer processes at the different interfaces: first the high frequency region associated with the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, the mid frequency large semicircle for charge transfer at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface, and the third in the low frequency region indicates the ion diffusion resistance or the Warburg diffusion coefficient in the electrolyte.80–82
A large semicircle in the mid-region indicates that the charge transfer resistance is high at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface. In other words, the charge recombination process is inhibited at the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interfaces for the dimeric D-Dye compared to the monomeric M-Dye. The best fitted data in Fig. 6(b) showed that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitance (Cμ)83 of the D-Dye are 23 Ohm and 1.02 mF cm−2, respectively, at the applied bias of 0.7 V. On the other hand, the values of 14 Ohm and 0.95 mF cm−2 were found for the M-Dye at the same applied bias. The conduction band shift and capacitance represented in eqn (2) and (3) play an important role in influencing the voltage of the fabricated cell.84 Voc = E(F,redox) − E(F,n)(2) E(F,n) = ECB + kBTln(nc/Nc)(3)where kB, T, nc, and Nc represent the Boltzmann's constant, absolute temperature (293 K), free electron density, and CBaccessable states, respectively.
The chemical capacitance of both the dyes was calculated by the extrapolation of experimental data with an equivalent circuit fitted by using the Nova software. The experimental results of increased charge transfer resistance also supported the increased photo-voltage by uplifting the CBTiO2. It is reported that Voc is the potential difference (eqn (2)) between the Fermi Level of TiO2 (EFn) and the redox electrolyte (Ered). For a particular cell, the energy level of the redox electrolyte is constant; therefore, Voc is individually dependent on the shifting of the conduction band and the electron cloud on CBTiO2 (as given in eqn (3)).73,74,84,85 The capacitance of D-Dye (1.02 mF cm−2) is higher than that of M-Dye (0.95 mF cm−2), indicating a more pronounced up-shifting of CBTiO2 in the cell employing the dimeric D-Dye compared to the monomeric M-Dye. This result also supported the increased value of Voc in the dimeric dye due to the high value of resultant dipole moment.
Electron lifetime also plays an important role in charge injection and charge passivation of the semiconductor surface. More charge injection and passivation also concomitantly increase the short-circuit photo-current of a fabricated cell. The electron lifetime can be calculated by multiplying charge transfer resistance with the capacitance. It was found that the electron lifetime of the D-Dye is 23.5 ms, which is almost two times higher than that of the M-Dye (13.3 ms). This calculation result also supported the higher Jsc value for the D-Dye (13.5 mA cm−2) compared to its monomeric M-Dye (9.64 mA cm−2). The calculated values for charge transfer resistance, capacitance, and electron lifetime are shown in Table 3.

4. Conclusion
Two organic dyes, dimeric D-Dye and monomeric M-Dye containing 1,8-naphthalamide derivative, were synthesized by using Suzuki coupling and compared through photovoltaic characterizations. Better photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.7 V were observed for D-Dye in comparison with M-Dye (Jsc of 9.93 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.67 V), leading to an enhancement of more than 30% in the power conversion efficiency from 4.85% (M-Dye) to 7.1% (D-Dye). Such enhanced photovoltaic properties, specifically Jsc, were well explained by the broadening of UV-Vis absorption and the IPCE spectra of the dimeric dyes compared to their monomeric counterparts. A noticeable amount of increased Voc (30 mV) was explained by up-lifting of the conduction band of TiO2 (CBTiO2) due to the increased resultant dipole moment of the dimeric D-dye. The shifting of CBTiO2 was explained by increasing capacitance (0.07 mF cm−2) of the cell fabricated using D-Dye in comparison with the M-dye. The improvement in the electron lifetime (10.2 ms) also increased the charge injection towards CBTiO2 in the case of the D-Dye solar cell. The study of co-adsorption of D-Dye with N-719 dye was also carried out and the maximum cell efficiency of 8.34% (Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.77 V) was achieved, showing that D-Dye is also a good co-adsorbent in conjunction with N-719.
