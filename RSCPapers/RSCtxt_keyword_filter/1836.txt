For the sake of promoting the mechanical endurance of flexible devices, a convenient and effective strategy for Ga doping is proposed, which can synchronously suppress the defects and tailor the residual stress of CZTSSe. The formed CZTGSSe with a doping concentration of 0.28 mol L−1 presents an optimized heterojunction characteristic with a CBO of −0.30 eV and a released residual stress of −1.87 GPa. Benefitting from the optimum Ga doping concentration with the reduced electrostatic potential fluctuation of 81.18 meV, the ultimately structured device with a PCE of 5.37% is achieved, which can maintain 80% of its original PCE after suffering in a harsh bending environment. The proposed Ga doping strategy may pave a promising way for congener flexible and portable solar cells.
1 Introduction
Irreparable environmental damage caused by vigorous industrial development and accelerated depletion in traditional fossil fuels has become an urgent issue in the energy crisis era. Accordingly, effectively harvesting and utilizing renewable and abundant solar energy is considered to be an immediate solution to alleviate environmental pollution and the energy crisis.1,2 Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) has attracted enormous attention as a promising flexible photovoltaic absorber due to its unique advantages such as non-toxicity, resourceful, low cost and desirable light absorption coefficient,3,4 which can provide broad applications in aerospace, curved photovoltaic building and smart wearable equipment. Accordingly, the PCE of flexible CZTSSe solar cells has kept breaking through to a world record 10% after years of efforts by researchers, which is still far away from its predecessor Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) (22.6%).5 This PCE limitation mainly comes from the defects of CZTSSe causing high Voc deficit and non-ignorable stress issues in flexibility.6,7
On the one hand, various defects will cause a carrier recombination center both in the bulk of CZTSSe and at the CZTSSe/CdS interface, which seriously deteriorates the device performance. Severe antisite defects such as CuZn, ZnCu and SnZn are the source of the main defects in CZTSSe, which can be effectively alleviated by substituting metal cations with other isovalent cations. In particular, significant improvement in device performance is indeed realized by fully or partially substituting Cu1+ by Ag1+, Li1+ and Au1+, Zn2+ by Cd2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+, Sn4+ by Ge4+ and Si4+.8–10 However, the above studies are mainly focused on isovalent substitution and researchers tend to overlook the prospect of trivalent metallic elements (In and Ga), which gradually begin to show their benefit in boosting Voc of CZTSSe devices and inhibiting defects.11,12
On the other hand, the inevitable residual stress has always been a problem in the production of flexible photovoltaic devices, as it directly causes film cracking, peel off and function failure of the entire device.13 As for residual stress, it is usually composed of thermal stress and intrinsic stress; the thermal stress originates from the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) difference between the film and substrate during the heating and cooling process.14 The intrinsic stress usually stems from the impurities and defects in the absorber: generated defects and dislocation will cause lattice distortion in the nucleation process of CZTSSe, accordingly generating intrinsic stress.15 Therefore, the precondition to solve the intrinsic stress issue is to reduce the multiple defects in the absorption layer. According to the above discussion, seeking a method that can simultaneously solve the defects and stress problem will solve the most difficult dilemma of flexible CZTSSe solar cells.
As discussed above, trivalent doping, defects and intrinsic stress can be organically combined. Based on our preliminary judgment, trivalent doping can not only reduce the defect dislocations generated in the nucleation process of the absorber (reducing the Voc deficit) but also tailor the intrinsic stress in flexible CZTSSe thin films (promoting flexibility), which can be considered as a breakthrough attempt in the bottleneck of current flexible CZTSSe solar cells. In this work, the challenge of the large residual stress of flexible CZTSSe solar cells with undesirable mechanical endurance is overcome by moderate Ga doping. The flexible devices with this optimized Ga doping exhibit improved heterojunction band matching and significant defect inhibition, which facilitates carrier transport. Accordingly, the photoelectric conversion efficiency and bending stability of flexible CZTSSe solar cells is significantly enhanced, which paves a promising way for future development of flexible photovoltaic devices.
2 Experimental
Ti foil of 50 μm was chemically polished with a diluted acid solution, which is composed of H2O, HNO3 and HF at a volume ratio of 5:4:2, and the polishing time was 60 s. For the effect of chemical polishing on substrate morphology and subsequent device performance refer to our previous work.16 The Mo layer was first sputtered with 80 sccm Ar for 5 min under the DC sputtering power of 250 W and the sputtering pressure was 0.1 Pa, then reduce the Ar gas flow rate by 10 sccm every 1 min until the Ar gas flow rate becomes 20 sccm, subsequently sputtering Mo with 20 sccm for 10 min to obtain the final Mo layer with a thickness of about 800 nm. The sheet resistance of the Mo layer is 0.7 Ω □−1. To prepare CZTS precursor solution, 0.958 g of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, 0.724 g of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 0.745 g of SnCl2·2H2O and 1.979 g CH4N2S were weighted and sequentially poured into a round-bottom flask with 10 mL dimethylformamide. After magnetic stirring at 70 °C, 60 min, a homogeneous yellow solution was obtained. The obtained solution was spin-coated on Mo-coated Ti foil at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by sintering on a 300 °C hot plate for 2 min. The spin-coating/sintering cycles were repeated 20 times to obtain the CZTS precursor. Subsequently, CZTS precursor was selenized in a quartz tube with continuously accessible 60 sccm N2 at 580 °C for 10 min to obtain the alloyed CZTSSe. For CZTSSe with a Ga doping process, GaCl3 with various concentrations (0, 0.14, 0.28 and 0.42 mol L−1) was poured into CZTS precursor solution, the subsequent preparation process of Ga-doped CZTSSe (CZTGSSe) is the same as that of CZTSSe. A flexible CZTSSe solar cell was fabricated according to the traditional structure of Ti/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag, and the effective area of each isolated cell is 0.25 cm2. The buffer layer CdS was prepared by chemical bath deposition at 80 °C, and the thickness of the CdS layer was 60 nm. After that, i-ZnO and ITO were sputtered onto the CdS layer, respectively. The thickness of i-ZnO and ITO was 60 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Finally, the top Ag contact electrode was thermally evaporated onto ITO. A detailed schematic diagram of the flexible CZTGSSe solar cell preparation process is shown in Fig. 1.

The effect of Ga doping on the structural and mechanical properties of CZTSSe was systematically determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, 532 nm laser). Detailed atomic ratios of thin films were determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Hitachi S4800, 20 kV) mounted on SEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher, K-alpha) was employed to understand the chemical states of elements in Ga-doped CZTGSSe thin films and valence states of the CCZTSSe thin film and CdS layer. The band gap of the CCZTSSe and CdS thin film was obtained by measuring the optical performance using UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy (Shimadzu, UV-3600). During the test process of optical performance, all the samples were prepared on a glass substrate with the same preparation process as those fabricated on Ti substrate, thus, here the influence of the flexible opaque Ti substrate on the band gap of CZTGSSe can be excluded in this paper. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter with standard AM 1.5G illumination to determine the photoelectric conversion capacity of flexible solar cells. PL spectra were obtained on flexible devices with increased laser excitation intensity by equipping a solid-state laser with 532 nm at 10 K, which can be used to calculate the electrostatic potential fluctuation in flexible devices on the basis of variation in peak shape.
3 Results and discussion
To understand the effect of Ga doping on the structural and mechanical properties of CZTSSe thin film, XRD and Raman spectroscopy were carried out. As depicted in Fig. 2(a), apart from the diffraction peak of the impenetrable back contact Mo layer, other peaks located at 27.23°, 45.33° and 53.66° correspond well to the (112), (204) and (312) peaks of kesterite CZTSSe.17 No overall phase change is observed after Ga doping, indicating Ga doping by dissolving GaCl3 into CZTS precursor solution can form a homogeneous alloy absorber, retaining the original kesterite structure host. Other diffraction peaks which might originate from binary or ternary phases are not detected, reflecting the purity of the obtained absorbers. Significantly, the magnified (112) peak shows a shift towards a greater diffraction angle in Fig. 2(b), which can be preliminarily considered as Sn being gradually replaced by Ga with a smaller atomic radius during the alloying process.18 As for the diffractograms of spin-coated CZTS precursor with increased Ga doping concentration, the embryonic form of the (112) peak gradually emerges with a dominate Mo peak. The strain of CZTGSSe thin films can be calculated using a formula according to the diffraction data in XRD: ε = βcosθ/4, where β is the full width half maxima (FWHM) of the (112) peak, θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, and ε is the lattice strain. As presented in Fig. 2(d), the CZTGSSe thin film with increased Ga doping concentration exhibits an obvious strain release, and it can be preliminarily concluded that deep and shallow defects such as CuZn, ZnCu and SnZn are suppressed and this conjecture will be discussed below. Owing to the variety of reactions in the CZTGSSe alloying process, possibly generated binary or multicomponent products may disturb the purity of the absorption layer. Accordingly, Raman spectroscopy was carried out to further identify the structural performance of CZTGSSe thin films. As depicted in Fig. 2(e), Raman peaks located at 195.52 cm−1 and 326.45 cm−1 correspond well with the vibration A mode of CZTSe and CZTS, respectively.19 The other peaks located at 177.41 cm−1 and 240.71 cm−1 correspond well with vibration B and E modes of CZTSe, respectively.20 Other miscellaneous phases such as Ga2Se3 or Ga2S3 are not observed, verifying again the purity of CZTGSSe and it is consistent with the XRD results. The enlarged vibration A mode of CZTGSSe thin films is shown in Fig. 2(f), and an obvious Raman shift is also observed, which can be explained by the radius difference between Ga and Sn.

As previously discussed in XRD, we attribute the conjecture of the diffraction peak shift to Sn replaced by Ga. For further verification, detailed atomic ratios of CZTGSSe thin films were determined and the results are summarized in Table 1. All the obtained absorbers present a stoichiometric ratio of poor copper and rich zinc (Cu/(Zn + Sn + Ga) < 1, Zn(Sn + Ga) > 1), which is considered a desired ratio for efficient CZTSSe solar cells.21 Significantly, the gradually decreased Sn and increased Ga/(Sn + Ga) (from 0 to 0.15) is observed. Previous theoretical calculations showed that GaSn has a relatively low formation energy, which acts as an acceptor in CZTSSe,12 and it has also been realized by constructing a sandwich-like Ga3+ configuration to form a Cu2ZnSn(Ga)(S,Se)4 alloying absorber.18 Therefore, we conclude that Sn is gradually occupied by Ga during the alloying process, causing Sn and Ga/(Sn + Ga) variation. To understand the effect of Ga3+ doping on the chemical states of each element in CZTGSSe, wide-scan XPS and core-level spectrum of Cu, Zn, Sn and Ga elements are systematically analyzed, which is shown in Fig. 3. The detected energy levels of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, Se, C and O in Fig. 3(a) agree well with previous reports.22 Notably, gradually exposed Ga energy levels with the increased Ga doping concentration is observed, which is highly in line with the EDS results. Besides, the core-level spectrum of Cu, Zn, Sn and Ga displayed in Fig. 3(b–e) confirms the Cu1+, Zn2+, Sn4+ and Ga3+ oxidation states, respectively, indicating a single environment for each of these components after selenizing the CZTS precursor with dissolved GaCl3.22–24 As observed in Fig. 3(f), the intensity of the Ga energy peak in the precursor exhibits a more obvious increasing trend than that of the alloyed CZTGSSe thin film. Notably, a substantially decreased intensity of Ga energy level peak is observed after undergoing the alloying process, indicating that the majority of dissolved Ga3+ in the CZTS precursor has migrated to the interior of CZTSSe, which is difficult to detect with XPS. According to the above characterization results, the formation mechanism of Ga-doped CZTSSe thin film can be referred to as follows: Cu(OAc)2 + Zn(OAc)2 + SnCl2 + GaCl3 + 4mTu → [Cu(Tu)m](OAc)2 + [Zn(Tu)m](OAc)2 + [Sn(Tu)m]Cl2 + [Ga(Tu)m]Cl3(1) 4[Cu(Tu)m](OAc)2 + 2[Zn(Tu)m](OAc)2 + 3[Sn(Tu)m]Cl2 + 3[Ga(Tu)m]Cl3 → Cu2ZnSn(Ga)S4 + Cu2S + ZnS + SnS + SnS2 + Ga2S3 + Volatiles(2) SnS + Se → SnSe2(3) Cu2S + SnSe2 → Cu2SnSe3/Cu2SnSe3(4) Cu2SnSe3/Cu2SnSe3 + Ga2S3 → Cu2Sn(Ga)Se3/Cu2Sn(Ga)Se3(5) Cu2Sn(Ga)Se3/Cu2Sn(Ga)Se3 + ZnS → Cu2ZnSn(Ga)(S,Se)4(6)

During the process of spin coating heating, solvents containing C, N, O, and S will volatilize in the form of residual gas. Reaction formula (1) explains the formative process of homogeneous yellow solution, in which thiourea (Tu) is complexed in dimethylformamide with metal salt ions. Afterward, CZTS together with some binary sulfides will be generated in the process of hot sintering. The selenization reaction mechanism of CZTS precursor with various Ga doping concentrations can be well understood from the reaction formula (2)–(6), finally alloying the Cu2ZnSn(Ga)(S,Se)4 thin film.
Both commercially available and laboratory-developed thin film solar cells are structured with a traditional heterojunction. Unexceptionally, CZTSSe thin film solar cells are essentially composed with a CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction. The orientation of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction dominates a critical role in photovoltaic performance. Hence, the effect of Ga doping on the heterojunction characteristics of CZTSSe/CdS is systematically investigated by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and XPS energy spectroscopy. The band gap analyzed from the transmittance and valence band maximum (VBM) value of CZTGSSe and CdS thin films are depicted in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(c), a slight decrease in band gap from 1.36 to 1.27 eV is observed with the increase in Ga doping concentration, which agrees well with previous literature on theoretical calculations.25 The slight decrease in the band gap of CZTGSSe can be explained by the stress effect caused by the induced Ga3+ with a smaller radius. The VBM value of CZTGSSe thin film with increased Ga doping concentration is 0.33, 0.35, 0.41 and 0.36 eV, respectively. The conduction band offset (CBO) of the CZTGSSe/CdS heterojunction can be determined as follows:26 CBOCZTGSSe/CdS = EgCdS − VBMCdS − (EgCZTGSSe − VBMCZTGSSe) + Vbb(7) Vbb = (ECZTGSSeCL − ECZTGSSeCL(i)) + (ECdSCL − ECdSCL(i))(8)where ECZTGSSeCL and ECdSCL are the core level energies of Cu, Zn, Sn, Ga and Cd, which originate from CZTGSSe and CdS thin films, respectively. ECZTGSSeCL(i) and ECdSCL(i) represent the same energy and are determined at the interface with different sputtering times. According to eqn (8), the average Vbb of CdS-CZTGSSe0, CdS-CZTGSSe0.14, CdS-CZTGSSe0.28 and CdS-CZTGSSe0.42 can be estimated from XPS core level detection, which is shown to be 0.09, 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12 eV. Combing the above information including band gap, VBM and Vbb, the band alignment of the CZTGSSe/CdS heterojunction can be acquired, which is shown in Fig. 5. As for the CZTSSe thin film solar cell, previous reports demonstrate that a “spike-like” structured CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction with a moderate conduction band offset (CBO) value from 0–0.4 eV can play a crucial role in collecting photogenerated carriers and suppressing carrier recombination.27 However, exorbitant CBO over 0.4 eV may deteriorate the device performance. As observed in Fig. 5(e)–(h), apparently, all the heterojunctions present a “cliff-like” structure, which is consistent with the results in most experiments.28,29 Interestingly, the CBO of the CZTGSSe/CdS heterojunction with increased Ga doping concentration shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, which reaches the maximum (−0.30 eV) as the doping concentration of Ga is 0.28 mol L−1. The increase of “cliff-like” CBO makes it closer to the ideal “spike-like” structure, which also indicates an improved heterojunction through Ga doping. The CBO variation demonstrates that an appropriate increase in Ga doping concentration can effectively promote carrier transportation at the CZTGSSe/CdS interface, which will result in a better open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), further confirmation of which will be discussed below.

As previously discussed, the inevitable intrinsic stress stemming from impurities and defects in absorber will deteriorate the device performance especially for those fabricated on flexible substrates, which will seriously challenge its performance in a harsh bending environment. Accordingly, omega stress XRD measurement is introduced to understand the effect of Ga doping on the stress of flexible CZTGSSe thin films. Determination of the residual stress can be referred to as follows: (9) (10) σ = K·M(11)where θ, E, μ and θ0 refer to diffraction angle, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and diffraction angle detected without stress constraint, respectively. The correlation of sinusoidal grazing incidence angle (ψ) and corresponding diffraction angle for CZTGSSe thin films is depicted in Fig. 6. The slope (M) of the fitting line derived from diffraction results (K) and residual stress (σ) are summarized in the inset table in Fig. 6. As expected, an obvious decrease in residual stress is observed after Ga doping, showing a minimum value of −1.87 GPa as the Ga doping concentration is 0.28 mol L−1. The tailored residual stress of CZTGSSe thin film can be preliminary attributed to the regulated defects with the role of Ga doping. As the thermal processing of alloyed CZTGSSe are the same, thermal stress originating from a CTE difference will not largely affect the variation of residual stress, while the intrinsic stress is the main factor leading to residual stress release. As the intrinsic stress in flexible CZTSSe thin film solar cells is mainly caused by impurities and defects in CZTSSe. The defects and dislocations produced in the nucleation process of CZTSSe thin films will cause lattice distortion, which will produce intrinsic stress in CZTSSe. With the effect of Ga doping, XRD and XPS results show that Ga can occupy the lattice position of Sn. We believe that this lattice occupation can effectively reduce the displacement defects such as SnZn, which is considered as a tiresome defect deteriorating device performance. Therefore, the reduction of defects by Ga doping can reduce the intrinsic stress in the absorption layer to a certain extent. Finally, the residual stress in CZTSSe is significantly reduced after Ga doping.

The electronic band structure near the Fermi-level of CZTSSe with optimized structural models is systematically calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) pseudopotential in GGA. According to the valence electron arrangement of Cu, Zn, Sn, Ga, S and Se atoms in CZTGSSe, their respective energy band diagrams are simulated. As shown in Fig. 7, the band gap of CZTGSSe with increased Ga substitution in Sn is 0.96, 0.78, 0.63 and 0.53 eV, respectively, which agrees well with the decreasing trend in experimental results. Generally, the band gap calculated by GGA is less than the actual band gap value of the material, which is underestimated by about 30%. Based on previous research in correcting the band gap difference by GGA+U or hybrid functional, the band gap difference will not change the changing trend of the band gap of the model structure.30,31 The valence electrons of CZTGSSe constituent element will split into continuous energy level distributions, and their respective electronic state density is obtained by VASP, which is shown in Fig. 8. Obviously, the density of states ranging from −8 eV to −6 eV is mainly affected by Zn and Sn, and the of states density at −5–0 eV is mainly affected by Cu. As Ga gradually replaces more Sn, the state density of Cu and Zn does not change significantly. For element Sn, it can be seen that the peak strength of its state density gradually weakens, while the peak of the state density of Ga gradually strengthens. When the simulation object is CZGSSe, the Sn peak is not visible, and the information of Ga is obvious. This is also consistent with our original intention of Ga doping to suppress SnZn substitutional defects.

The suppressed defects are not only reflected in the intrinsic stress of the absorber, but also critical to the performance of subsequent flexible devices. Therefore, J–V curves detection and bending test are carried out to fully understand the photoelectric and mechanical performance of flexible solar cells prepared under the absorption layer with different amounts of Ga doping, respectively. J–V curves and PCE variation with an error bar of flexible devices (nine solar cells with an active area of 0.2 cm2 for each parameter) are shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. The parameters of the flexible CZTGSSe solar cell are summarized in Table 2. Flexible CZTSSe solar cells without Ga doping exhibit a poor PCE of 3.31%, featuring a Voc of 299.31 mV, current density (Jsc) of 26.45 mA cm−2 and FF of 41.81%. Apparently, owing to the released residual stress and improved heterojunction characteristics, moderate Ga doping concentration greatly promotes the improvement of device performance, which increases from 3.31% to 4.19% and 5.37% in PCE as the doping concentration is 0.14 mol L−1 and 0.28 mol L−1, respectively. Compared with Jsc and FF, Voc varies the most, which increases remarkably from 299.31 mV to 351.12 mV. We attribute the phenomenon of increased Voc (decreased Voc deficit) to the relief of band tail state and electrostatic potential fluctuation which originates from defects (CuZn, SnZn and VCu) after Ga doping.32,33 Detailed calculation and demonstration of the electrostatic potential fluctuation will be systematically discussed below. However, excessive Ga doping with 0.42 mol L−1 will slightly weaken the performance of the solar cell, exhibiting a decreased PCE of 4.61%. The reason for the weakening performance caused by excessive Ga doping may be the formation of some Ga related deep level defects in the absorber, which needs to be further analyzed in our next work. In order to figure out the effect of Ga doping with released residual stress on the mechanical performance of flexible CZTGSSe solar cells, the bending test is carried out under a harsh bending environment, and the output PCE attenuation with various bending times and bending degrees are depicted in Fig. 9(c and d). As expected, a flexible device with Ga doping exhibits superior mechanical endurance compared with that without Ga doping. For a fixed bending degree of 60°, flexible CZTGSSe solar cells with a 0.28 mol L−1 doping concentration can maintain 87%, 85% and 81% of the original PCE after suffering bending with the time of 20, 50 and 100, respectively. For fixed bending times of 50, flexible CZTGSSe solar cells with a 0.28 mol L−1 doping concentration can maintain 85%, 82% and 78% of the original PCE after suffering bending with degrees of 60°, 120° and 180°, respectively. However, flexible CZTSSe solar cells without Ga doping merely maintain 71% after suffering bending with the degree of 60° and times of 100. The reduction in performance attenuation after bending guarantees better mechanical durability, highlighting its flexible characteristics and future applications.

As mentioned in the photoelectric performance of flexible devices, the boosted Voc of the flexible device with moderate Ga doping is considered as the role of released band tail state and electrostatic potential fluctuation originating from decreased antisite defect. The electrostatic potential fluctuation γ can be well determined as follows:34 (12)where ε0, εr, and Nt represent the permittivity of vacuum, relative permittivity and total defect density, respectively. The above equation indicates that the electrostatic potential fluctuation is closely connected with the defect density, which is mainly generated from the absorber. Accordingly, the PL spectra of flexible CZTSSe and CZTGSSe (Ga: 0.28 mol L−1) solar cells recorded with a 532 nm solid-state laser at 10 K were obtained to determine the electrostatic potential fluctuation. As shown in Fig. 8, compared with the band gap calculated from the traditional method (1.36 and 1.29 eV), the band gap calculated by PL (1.34 and 1.26 eV) is smaller, indicating a sub-band gap state dominated role in carrier recombination.35 For PL spectra with increased laser intensity present a gradual emerged “shoulder” with a threshold of ∼123.64 μJ cm−2 and ∼78.89 μJ cm−2, which is considered a crucial result in estimating the total defect density. The gradually emerged PL shoulder peak is characteristic of doped and compensated semiconductors, including kesterites.36
Here, we assume that the illuminated light can be fully absorbed within the upper 100 nm CZTSSe/CZTGSSe absorber and the total defect density can be determined by the double electron–hole pair generated (Ne–h). Finally, the electrostatic potential fluctuation γ can be calculated by combining the following formulas: (13) (14) (15)where mr, me, mh, m0, ħ, Tlaser, λ and t represent the reduced effective mass, electron effective mass, hole effective mass, electron mass, reduced Planck's constant, threshold laser intensity, laser wavelength and the thickness of absorber, respectively, which are summarized in Table 3. The electrostatic potential fluctuation γ is estimated to be 97.17 and 81.18 meV, indicating a released γ with decreased radiative and non-radiative charged defects after Ga doping, inhibiting the Voc deficit of the device with better device performance. In addition, we can also find that the PL peak intensity increases with the increased laser excitation intensity, indicating an enhanced absorption strength. Compared with Fig. 10(a) and (b), with the same laser excitation intensity, the PL peak intensity after Ga doping (0.28 mol L−1) is obviously stronger than that without Ga doping, indicating that the Ga-doped absorption layer has a higher absorption strength, which also further verifies the reduction of defects in CZTGSSe.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we report an efficient and flexible Ga doped CZTSSe solar cell based on a penetrative understanding of the residual stress and photoelectric characteristic of CZTGSSe thin films. The XPS detection combined with VASP theoretical calculation demonstrate that the introduced Ga3+ solution prefers to occupy the lattice of Sn, which effectively released the band tail state and electrostatic potential fluctuation. Benefitting from the role of Ga doping in promoting the heterojunction characteristic and releasing residual stress, Ga doping with an optimized concentration of 0.28 mol L−1 achieved 5.37% efficiency flexible CZTGSSe solar cells with desirable mechanical endurance. The Ga doping strategy may facilitate the development of flexible CZTSSe solar cells toward roll-to-roll production in industry.
