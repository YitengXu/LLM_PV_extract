Our finding demonstrates the TSi/sg-ZnO bilayer ETL holds promise in the practical application of OSCs for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and moisture-resistance of devices.
Introduction
To date, organic solar cells (OSCs) have been paid tremendous attention due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility, environmental friendliness etc.1–3 Moreover, the-state-of-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lab-scale single-junction OSCs has exceeded 18% with the assistance of developing high-quality photovoltaic materials as well as innovating device structures.4–8 Despite the PCE of OSCs reaching the threshold of commercialization, the stability of OSCs especially under a humid environment is still far from satisfactory compared to its inorganic counterpart.9–11 Therefore, exploring effective methods to intensify the stability yet without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance of devices is urgent and significant for the development of OSCs.
Compared to developing high-performance photovoltaic materials, the rational management on interfacial contact between a charge transport layer and photoactive layer could be a simple yet effective method to simultaneously improve the stability and efficiency of OSCs.12–14 Up to now, fullerene derivatives (PCBDANI, FPNOH, etc.), organic small molecules, polymers, and inorganic materials have been successfully used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in OSCs.15–20 Among the reported ETLs, the sol–gel ZnO (sg-ZnO) has been widely adopted for its facile preparation, high optical transparency and large electron mobility.21–24 However, the hydrophilic nature of sg-ZnO not only increases the possibility of moisture ingression, but also inevitably hampers the wettability of nonpolar organic solvents used for preparing a photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO. Hence, the molecular arrangement and morphology of the photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO could be highly influenced, which might inevitably impart a negative effect on device stability and efficiency to some extent.25,26 Besides, the defect-rich surface of sg-ZnO stemming from the low processing temperature could lead to serious interfacial charge recombination, thus also impairing the stability and efficiency of derived devices.27 Even though several types of materials have been successfully adopted to modify sg-ZnO, such as ionic liquids, polymers and organic small molecules, the reported materials feature either complex synthetic procedures or batch-to-batch variation, which are obviously not compatible with the practical application of OSCs.28–31 Albeit some organic small molecules are definitely low-cost as well as effective in improving the efficiency of OSCs when modifying sg-ZnO, and their hygroscopic property or instability to moisture would increase their storage cost and limit their application in humid environments.32–34 Therefore, developing materials simultaneously featuring low cost, effectiveness, and strong humidity resistance to modify sg-ZnO is greatly anticipated for the practical application of OSCs.
Taking the above into consideration, we developed a simple organic trisiloxane molecule (named TSi). TSi could be prepared via a one-step procedure and purified solely through extraction with deionized water. And when TSi was applied to modify sg-ZnO, the TSi/sg-ZnO film presents fewer surface defects, shallower work function, and stronger hydrophobicity than the pristine sg-ZnO film. More importantly, when applying a copolymer (PBDFP-Bz) based on benzodifuran and benzotriazole as the electron donor and Y6 as the electron acceptor to fabricate OSCs, the derived devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO as the ETL produced a higher PCE of 14.62% along with stronger moisture-resistance than that of control devices (12.39%), benefiting from suppressed charge recombination, enhanced charge extraction and increased stability to moisture. Beyond that, the TSi/sg-ZnO ETL was also applicable in other photovoltaic systems, among which PM6:Y6 OSCs based on TSi/sg-ZnO ETL demonstrated a superior PCE of 16.37% accompanied with enhanced stability to moisture versus the reference ones.
Discussion
Photovoltaic properties
The device configuration in this work is displayed in Fig. 1a, where a home-made benzodifuran (BDF)-based polymer (PBDFP-Bz) and Y6 were firstly adopted as the donor and acceptor for preparing the photoactive layer, respectively, owing to their complementary absorption and well-aligned energy level (Fig. S1, ESI†).35 TSi can be facilely synthesized via a one-step procedure and purified solely through extraction with deionized water (Scheme 1), indicating its great potential for low-cost mass production. Furthermore, the TSi molecule has been successfully characterized by 1H-NMR and FTIR (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†).36 It is highlighted that TSi features incoordinate electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution (Fig. 1d), which is conducive to forming an interfacial dipole and facilitating charge extraction between a photoactive layer and sg-ZnO.

As exhibited in Fig. 1e and Table 1, the PBDFP-Bz:Y6 devices based on sg-ZnO as the ETL obtain a modest PCE of 12.39% with a Jsc of 23.12 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.819 V and FF of 65.41%. Compared to devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL, the optimized PBDFP-Bz:Y6 devices with TSi/sg-ZnO as the ETL deliver a higher PCE of 14.62% coupled with a slightly enhanced Jsc of 23.41 mA cm−2 and a higher Voc of 0.830 V as well as a larger FF of 75.23% (Fig. 1e, Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The relatively higher Jsc of devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL should be ascribed to its higher efficiency in charge extraction considering the similar photoactive materials for devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO ETL and sg-ZnO ETL, which is verified by the relatively higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) value of the former (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, a slightly higher JEQE of 22.68 mA cm−2 was obtained for the optimized devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL compared with that of optimized devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL (21.85 mA cm−2), consistent with the results of J–V measurements with an acceptable deviation less than 6%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 14.62% as well as the FF of 75.23% of the PBDFP-Bz based devices are among the highest values reported so far for BDF polymer-based OSCs (Fig. 1j and Table S2, ESI†). Meanwhile, it is also noted that the photovoltaic performance of PBDFP-Bz-based devices is also among the highest values for OSCs with a benzotriazole-based copolymer as the electron donor.37–40 Besides, the optimized devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL display good reproducibility of photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 13.49 ± 0.62% (Fig. S5, ESI†).

Charge dynamics
To shed light on the influence of a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL on the photovoltaic performance of the optimized devices, a series of characterizations on charge dynamics was firstly performed. As displayed in Fig. 2a, the transient photocurrent (TPC) spectra demonstrate that devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL feature a more efficient charge extraction evaluated from a smaller photocurrent decay lifetime of ∼0.18 μs than that of devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL (∼0.34 μs). Meanwhile, the evolution of Jsc as a function of light intensity (Plight) shows that devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL present a larger α (1.00) than that of devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL (0.98), as shown in Fig. 2b, also suggesting that a more perfect charge extraction is preserved in the former, which agrees well with the more enlarged and balanced charge mobilities of the former (Fig. 2c and Table 1).41,42 The proficient charge extraction could suppress the bimolecular charge recombination and impart the improvement of photovoltaic performance for devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL.

Furthermore, the transient photovoltage (TPV) spectra indicate that devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL display a prolonged lifetime of ∼1.07 μs versus that of devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL (0.74 μs) in Fig. 2d, implying the charge recombination rate is greatly reduced in the former. As shown in Fig. 2e, a smaller ideality factor n of 1.21 demonstrates that the trap-assisted recombination is effectively restrained in devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL relative to devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL (1.96).43,44
As depicted in Fig. 2f, the stability of the optimized PBDFP-Bz:Y6 OSCs under a humid environment (∼50% relative humidity) was evaluated.45 Obviously, devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL present stronger endurance to moisture with 85.1% of their original PCE remaining after storage in a humid environment for ∼380 h, while devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL only display a low value (69.8%). Hence, a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL should feature great potential for fabricating efficient OSCs with high endurance to moisture.
Morphology properties
To better understand the effect of TSi/sg-ZnO ETLs on the photovoltaic performance of the optimized devices, the morphology of the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO and sg-ZnO was investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a and d, the photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO and TSi/sg-ZnO both display a nanoscale interpenetrating network. Meanwhile, a similar fibrillar texture-like morphology could also be found for a photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO and TSi/sg-ZnO (Fig. 3b and e). However, the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO exhibits a denser surface morphology with larger root mean square roughness (Rrms) of 3.19 nm (Fig. 3f) than that upon sg-ZnO (Rrms = 1.32 nm, Fig. 3c), which should be ascribed to a more ordered arrangement of the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO (discussed in the latter). Therefore, the better morphology of the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO is beneficial for charge transportation, which coincides well with the enlarged charge mobility of devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO ETL.

Furthermore, two-dimensional grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was conducted to study the influence of TSi/sg-ZnO ETL on the microstructure and molecular packing of the photoactive layer. As shown in Fig. 4, the photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO and TSi/sg-ZnO both present a pronounced (010) peak in out-of-plane (OOP), indicating the predominant face-on orientation of the photoactive layer. The (010) peak in OOP of the photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO is located at 17.57 nm−1 (Fig. 4d), corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.57 Å. However, the (010) peak of the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO shifts to 17.76 nm−1, resulting in a reduced π–π stacking distance (3.53 Å). Beyond that, the crystalline coherence length (CCL) of the photoactive layer upon sg-ZnO for the π–π stacking in OOP is 15.4 Å, while the corresponding CCL increases to 16.5 Å for the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO (Fig. S6, ESI†).46,47 Moreover, the (100) peak in OOP of the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO displays a stronger diffraction intensity than that on sg-ZnO (Fig. 4d). Therefore, the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO features a more ordered arrangement along with higher crystallinity, which should be the partial origin of the higher Jsc and FF of devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL.

Photophysical properties
To intrinsically understand the effect of a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL on the photovoltaic performance of the optimized devices, some characterizations on sg-ZnO film and TSi/sg-ZnO film were implemented. As shown in Fig. 5a, the sg-ZnO film presents spiculate feature distribution along with a large Rrms of 8.12 nm. However, the TSi/sg-ZnO film shows a smooth surface morphology with a small Rrms of 4.62 nm (Fig. 5d). The smooth surface of the TSi/sg-ZnO film could provide better contact with the photoactive layer, which is verified by its smaller series resistance versus that of devices based on sg-ZnO ETL (Fig. S7, ESI†). As exhibited in Fig. 5b and Video S1 (ESI†), the sg-ZnO film presents a hydrophilic property with a water contact angle (CA) of 43.01°. Even though the reported trialkoxysilane molecule could enhance the hydrophobicity of the sg-ZnO film to some extent, the modified sg-ZnO film still features a hydrophilic property with a water CA of 66.76° (Fig. S8 and Video S2, ESI†). Compared to the above films, the TSi/sg-ZnO film demonstrates distinct hydrophobicity with a larger water CA of 91.22° (Fig. 5e and Video S3, ESI†), which is not only beneficial for improving the wettability of the nonpolar solvent used to prepare the photoactive layer upon TSi/sg-ZnO, but also is in favour of enhancing the endurance to moisture for devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO. Owing to the thinness of the TSi layer (Fig. S9, ESI†), the TSi/sg-ZnO film almost displays a similar photon transmission as the sg-ZnO film (Fig. 5c). For the incoordinate ESP distribution of TSi, an appreciable interfacial dipole accompanied with a down-shifted work function by 0.24 eV could be found for the TSi/sg-ZnO film versus sg-ZnO film (Fig. 5f), which could reduce the energy loss for electron transfer and be partially responsible for the higher Voc of OSCs based on TSi/sg-ZnO.32,48

Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), steady state photoluminescence spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra and Kelvin probe force microscopy were conducted to study the influence of TSi on the surface trap states of sg-ZnO. As shown in Fig. 6a, the Zn peak of the TSi/sg-ZnO film shifts by about 0.8 eV to a higher binding energy in comparison with that of the sg-ZnO film. Meanwhile, the N peak of the TSi/sg-ZnO film can only be found at a higher binding energy (401.6 eV), and the lower energy (399.6 eV) N peak is completely absent (Fig. S10, ESI†), which indicates that numerous Zn atoms distributed on the surface of the sg-ZnO film are bound by the –NH2 of TSi molecules and there are no free states of –NH2 in the TSi/sg-ZnO film.33,49,50 It is also noted that the O peak of the TSi/sg-ZnO film at 532.5 eV resulting from oxygen defects is highly reduced compared to that of the sg-ZnO film (Fig. 6b and c).51 Furthermore, the sg-ZnO film and TSi/sg-ZnO film both exhibit a sharp ultra-violent emission and a broad emission from 450–650 nm, which corresponds to the near band edge emission and deep level emission induced by oxygen defects, respectively.27 However, the broad emission of the TSi/sg-ZnO film presents a reduced intensity versus that of the sg-ZnO film, also suggesting that the oxygen defects on the surface of sg-ZnO could be highly passivated by TSi molecules. Moreover, the TRPL spectra indicate that the exciton lifetime of Y6 on sg-ZnO (17.2 ns) is much smaller than that on TSi/sg-ZnO (32.1 ns), as shown in Fig. 6e, revealing that the photogenerated carriers of Y6 on TSi/sg-ZnO are less captured by oxygen defects, which is similar to the work reported by Li et al.32

As displayed in Fig. 6f and Fig. S11 (ESI†), the contact surface potential (CSP) of the TSi/sg-ZnO film in the dark is about 160 meV more positive than that of the sg-ZnO film, being in line with the lower work function of the TSi/sg-ZnO film.52 Moreover, TSi/sg-ZnO presents a smaller CSP discrepancy of 10 mV versus that of sg-ZnO (50 mV) when placed in the condition with light successively turned off, on and off, implying that fewer defects distribute on the surface of the TSi/sg-ZnO film.53 Overall, the reduced oxygen defects of the TSi/sg-ZnO film could enhance electron extraction, alleviate the interfacial charge recombination, and then impart better photovoltaic performance and stronger stability for devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO.
The universality of TSi/sg-ZnO ETLs in OSCs was further investigated in another three photovoltaic systems.54–56 As shown in Fig. 7a–c, Table 2 and Fig. S12 (ESI†), all devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL demonstrate better photovoltaic performance especially with relatively higher Voc and FF compared to those of devices based on an sg-ZnO ETL. In particular, PM6:Y6 devices with a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL yield a higher PCE of 16.37% than that of the reference devices (15.10%). Meanwhile, all devices based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL also showed stronger stability than the reference ones when stored in a humid environment for ∼380 h (Fig. 7d–f). Overall, TSi/sg-ZnO bilayer ETLs would be promising candidates to be adopted for the practical application of OSCs for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and moisture-resistance of devices.

Conclusion
In summary, an organic trisiloxane molecule TSi simultaneously featuring low cost, effectiveness, and strong moisture resistance was developed to modify sg-ZnO films. It is found that TSi could simultaneously passivate the surface defects, decrease the work function, and intensify the hydrophobicity of sg-ZnO films. Benefiting from these merits, PBDFP-Bz:Y6 OSCs based on a TSi/sg-ZnO ETL demonstrate suppressed interfacial charge recombination and improved charge extraction, which thus results in a higher PCE of 14.62% along with stronger stability in a humid environment than the reference ones. Moreover, the TSi/sg-ZnO ETL is also applicable in three other photovoltaic systems, among which PM6:Y6 devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO ETLs demonstrate a superior PCE of 16.37% with ∼1% enhancement relative to the reference ones. Meanwhile, the stability of PM6:Y6 devices based on TSi/sg-ZnO ETLs increases by 15.7% versus the reference ones under a humid environment. Our work highlights the great potential of TSi/ZnO in the practical application of OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
PBDFP-Bz was prepared in our laboratory,35 and Y6 was purchased from Zhiyan Company (Nanjing, China). Unless otherwise noted, γ-aminopropylmethyl-diethoxysilane, hexamethyldisiloxane and other chemicals were purchased from Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China) and used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of TSi
γ-Aminopropylmethyl-diethoxysilane (1.913 g, 10.0 mmol), hexamethyldisiloxane (8.119 g, 50.0 mmol) and potassium hydroxide (0.028 g, 0.5 mmol) were placed into a single-neck bottom flask (50 mL) equipped with a condensing tube. The flask was vacuumed, refilled with nitrogen, and then placed into an oil-bath with a temperature of 100 °C, and kept stirring for 3.0 h under nitrogen protection. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 140 °C and maintained for 0.5 h. After the flask was cooled to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 30 mL deionized water, and then the upper layer was extracted after the above mixture was left to stand for 4.0 h. The above procedure was repeated 4–5 times until the upper layer became clear. Finally, the mixture was diluted with anhydrous dichloromethane and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and dried under vacuum to obtain a pale yellow liquid as the target product TSi. Yield: 1.708 g (61.2%). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ: 2.67(m, 2H), 1.96(s, 2H), 1.47(m, 2H), 0.48(t, 2H), 0.12(s, 18H), 0.04(s, 3H); FTIR (cm−1): 3357, 3290, 2958, 2927, 1938, 1582, 1470, 1412, 1257, 1048, 840, 783, 754, 687, 652, 633.
Device fabrication
The OSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/sg-ZnO (35 nm)/TSi (7 nm)/PBDFP-Bz:Y6/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The patterned ITO-coated glasses (∼12 Ω sq−1) were successively cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min. Then, the ITO-coated glasses were dried with nitrogen-flow, and irradiated with oxygen plasma for 20 min. Next, the sg-ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated on top of the ITO-coated glass at 4500 rpm for 30 s.21 Subsequently, the film was annealed at 220 °C for 40 min in air. Afterwards, 1.5 mg mL−1 TSi in isopropanol was spin-coated on sg-ZnO film at 1800 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 80 °C for 4 min in air. Afterwards, the substrates were placed in a glovebox (VO2 < 0.1 ppm, VH2O < 0.1 ppm). The PBDFP-Bz:Y6 (1:1.25, by weight) blends with a concentration of 7.5 mg mL−1 for PBDFP-Bz were dissolved in chloroform and kept under stirring at 45 °C for at least 2.0 h. Before spin-coating, 1.0% DPE was added into the above chloroform solution and consecutively stirred at 45 °C for at least 1.0 h. Sequentially, the chloroform solution was spin-coated onto ITO/sg-ZnO/TSi film, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, the active layer was placed into a glass dish with a cap for 5 min, where methanol vapor was filled. Finally, MoO3/Ag (8/100 nm) was successively evaporated onto the photoactive layer under a pressure of ∼4.0 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the devices was defined by the shadow mask with 3.14 mm2.
