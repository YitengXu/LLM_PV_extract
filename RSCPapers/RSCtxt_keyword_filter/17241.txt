    , Accepted 24th September 2015First published on 25th September 2015AbstractIn conventional organic photovoltaic cells, the active layer consists of a polymeric donor and a molecular acceptor (PD/MA). An unconventional material combination based on molecular donor/polymeric acceptor (MD/PA) emerged in 2014 but attracted limited attention. To broaden photovoltaic material systems and understand the crucial factors related to the photovoltaic performance, in this report, we adopted a molecular donor (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and three polymeric acceptors based on perylenediimide (PDI). We find that the high contents (70–80%) of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the better crystallinity and larger grains in the blend films induced by the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) play an important role in constructing the continuous and effective donor phase for charge transfer and hole transport in the active layers. The highest PCE of photovoltaic cells reached 3.01% with a VOC of 0.68 V, JSC of 7.59 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.58 for the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PSe-PDI active layer, although the hole and the electron mobilities are still unbalanced. Further optimization of the film morphology and improvement of the electron mobility by material design and device engineering are expected to boost the efficiency of MD/PA type fullerene-free solar cells.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have received close attention from both academia and industry in recent years because of their unique advantages of low cost, light weight and their application in fabricating flexible large-area devices.1–4 In the so-called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure of OPVs, the active layers comprise a mixture of an electron donor (p-type) and an acceptor material (n-type). This structure provides both large interfaces for photo-generated excitons to efficiently dissociate into charge pairs and bicontinuous networks for transport of holes and electrons to the corresponding electrodes.2 From the viewpoint of the materials, fullerene derivatives are most frequently used as an effective electron acceptor, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% has been achieved by using either polymer- or molecular-based donors.5–11 However, recent developments of new n-type materials release us from the limitations of the fullerene-based acceptors such as the difficulty in the manipulation of the absorption spectra and the energy levels and the metastable morphology of the mixed films.12 These limitations could be overcome by molecular design of both polymer and molecular acceptor materials for non-fullerene BHJ.13,14
In principle, there should not be any fundamental limitations of the material combinations in BHJ and there are four types categorized by the class of the materials: polymeric donor/molecular acceptor (PD/MA),15–24 polymeric donor/polymeric acceptor (PD/PA, so-called “all-polymer”),25–36 molecular donor/molecular acceptor (MD/MA, so-called “all-molecule”) and molecular donor/polymeric acceptor (MD/PA). Due to the intense investigations and the large number of promising polymer donors available, the first two types of OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptors have achieved huge success with the highest PCE of 6.80% and 6.71%, respectively.22,35 OPVs based on MD/MA could be traced back to 1986, where CuPc and PV molecules were used as the donor and the acceptor, respectively.37 After that, owing to the development of new molecular materials, the efficiency of OPVs based on MD/MA has been greatly improved.38–41 In particular, the emergence of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in 2012 ignited the research on this type of OPV. OPVs based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and a perylenediimide (PDI)-based molecular acceptor with a PCE of 3.0% have been reported.42–44 In a recent report, the PCE of the MD/MA type OPV based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 shoot up to 5.4%.45
Compared with the above three types, OPVs based on MD/PA combinations have been reported in very recent years and the number is still limited. In 2014, Zhan et al. reported the first MD/PA type OPV, using p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor and a PDI-based polymer as the acceptor, but the PCE was as low as 0.29%.46 Later, the same group changed the donor to DIB-SQ, a kind of squaraine dye, and simultaneously adopted a layer-by-layer fabrication method, and the efficiency of OPV was improved to 1.12%.47 Almost at the same time, Nguyen et al. fabricated an MD/PA type OPV based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and a high performance naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based n-type polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) to achieve a PCE of 2.1% by intensive device optimization.48 Recently, Inganäs et al. synthesized a new donor small molecule DTD, and the PCE of the cells reached 3.6% by combining with P(NDI2OD-T2) as the acceptor.49 More recently, Jo et al. obtained a high PCE of 4.82% based on the combination of DTP-DPP with P(NDI2OD-T2).50 So far, the highest PCEs in reported OPVs based on MD/PA combinations, 1.12% for PDI-based polymers and 4.82% for NDI-based polymers, are inferior to those of other three types of OPVs. The vital factors that determine the miscibility, film morphology, charge transport and the device performance of MD/PA type devices are still not clear. There is still more room for investigation in MD/PA combinations to understand the mechanism of the formation of BHJ structures and to realize higher photovoltaic performance.
In this contribution, we utilized p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the molecular donor and three kinds of PX-PDI (X = C, T, and Se) polymers based on PDI with different energy levels and band gaps as the acceptor to fabricate MD/PA type BHJ OPVs and systematically investigate the critical parameters related to the performance. The effect of solvent additives in the solution on the absorption spectra, the morphology of the blend films, charge transport properties and photovoltaic performance were also investigated.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures and energy levels of the materials used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method according to the equations of LUMO = −e(φred + 4.8) (eV) and HOMO = −e(φox + 4.8) (eV), where φred and φox are the onset of reduction and oxidation potentials vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively.27 The LUMO energy of PC-PDI (−3.66 eV), PT-PDI (−3.94 eV) and PSe-PDI (−3.97 eV) is well below that of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (−3.34 eV); thus effective electron transfer from the photoexcited donor to the acceptors can be expected. In addition, the HOMO energy offsets of PC-PDI (0.71 eV), PT-PDI (0.72 eV) and PSe-PDI (0.63 eV) relative to the HOMO of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are sufficiently high to promote hole transfer from the polymeric acceptors to the molecular donor by photoexcitation of the acceptors. Therefore, we could expect photocurrent generation from both the donor and the acceptor absorptions.

OPVs were fabricated with a conventional sandwich structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the three combinations. The device performances were optimized by varying the solvents, the molar ratios of the donor and the acceptors in the blends and the use of diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive in the solutions. The J–V curves under light irradiation are shown in Fig. 2 for the optimal devices and VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF), and PCE calculated from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1 for the best conditions and in Table S1† for various conditions. The PCEs of the devices with the donor of PC-PDI, PT-PDI and PSe-PDI increase from 1.05%, 0.39% and 0.73%, respectively, to 2.45%, 2.02% and 3.01%, with the addition of 0.5 vol% of DIO in CB in the coating solutions. For these three combinations, the efficiencies peaked with 0.5 vol% of DIO, and the JSC values largely decreased when the amount of DIO is more or less than this value. The best donor:acceptor ratio between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC-PDI, PT-PDI and PSe-PDI systems was 7:3, 7:3 and 8:2, respectively, which is quite different from the other three fullerene-free OPV systems in which the typically optimal ratios are around 1:1. These high optimum contents of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the MD/PA system suggest that high contents of the molecular materials might be necessary to construct both large interface area and continuous phase of the molecular material phase which are suitable for OPVs.

To investigate the effect of DIO on the properties of blend films, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film and the three kinds of blend films of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI with the best ratios for the photovoltaic cells spin-coated from CB or CB:DIO (0.5 vol%) solutions as shown in Fig. 3. Without DIO, the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film exhibits two peaks at 622 nm and 671 nm, while the three blend films only show one broad peak at around 620 nm and the peaks at 670 nm are absent, implying a relatively disordered structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. With 0.5 vol% DIO as the additive, the red-shift of the peaks to 690 nm was observed for both the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI blend films. We speculate that these changes result from the increase of crystallinity in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 for both the pure and the blend films during the film formation process. The influence of DIO on the aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 might enhance the intermolecular order, which could be favorable to the hole transport in the blend films.

To investigate the improvement of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallinity, the crystal structures of the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film and the blend p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI films were measured by 2D grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and the images are shown in Fig. 4. When the films are spin-coated from CB solutions, the blend films show weaker signals compared with the pure donor film, suggesting that the amorphous acceptor polymers disperse into the donor phase and disturb the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. When the films were prepared from the CB:DIO solvent, the intensity of the signals both in the pure and the blend films become stronger, which implies that the addition of DIO helps to improve the crystallinity of the donor phase. On the other hand, the orientational disorder in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 becomes larger with DIO judging by the broadening of the diffraction peaks in the azimuth direction. Note that PX-PDIs do not show any diffraction peaks even in the pure films (data not shown). From the changes of the absorption spectra and 2D GIXRD, we can conclude that the addition of DIO could increase the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallinity, which should be favorable for the charge transport.

The charge transport properties of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI blend films spin-coated from CB or CB:DIO solutions were estimated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique. Both the estimated hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table 1 and the typical J–V curves are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). It is clear that the hole mobilities of these blends exhibit higher values than the electron mobilities. Upon addition of DIO into the solution, the hole mobilities increased by one to two orders of magnitude, which indicates that the addition of DIO plays an important role in constructing the continuous donor phase in the active layers. The electron mobilities of all the blend films were observed to be in the range of 3.1 × 10−6–9.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The addition of the DIO additive just slightly increased the electron mobility, which is still much lower than the hole mobility. The enhanced hole and electron mobilities in the blend films could contribute to more efficient charge extraction and thus a higher FF. However, it is important to balance electron mobility and hole mobility in organic solar cells for good photovoltaic performance.31 Therefore, improvements of the electron transport would further increase the device performance.
The efficiency of exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface is estimated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The PL spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI blend films with excitation at 610 nm are shown in Fig. S2.† It can be seen that the PL intensity was quenched by >95% in the blend films relative to the pure donor film without the DIO additive. This suggests that efficient charge transfer between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PX-PDI polymers occurred. The efficient PL quenching of the blend film spin-coated without DIO indicates homogeneous mixed blend films, which are favorable to the exciton dissociation. On the other hand, the PL intensity of the pure donor film with DIO addition was much lower than that without DIO, suggesting the lower emission quantum yield of the film due to the change of the packing order observed in UV-vis spectra. This change of the quantum yield makes the quantitative evaluation of the quenching efficiency difficult. However, PL intensities of the blend films with DIO addition largely increased compared to those without DIO; even the PL quantum yield with the higher structural order is lower. This change implies that the charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface is much less efficient in the blend films cast from CB:DIO solutions. This change may be attributed to the large aggregation domain of the donor or the acceptor, which leads to longer exciton diffusion length during the lifetime. The efficiency of PL quenching decreased but JSC increased with the addition of DIO, which suggests that charge transport in the blend films without DIO is a more severe problem. Therefore, the morphology of the blend films needs to be explored to further monitor the complete yield of free charge carriers in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI systems because it is widely believed that there are inevitable relationships between the morphology of the blend active layers and the solar cell performances.16,31,51–55
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to understand the morphological features of the blend films p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI spin-coated from the solutions without and with DIO additive. As shown in Fig. 5, the three p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI blend films showed relatively smooth surface with the root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.40, 1.37 and 0.317 nm, respectively. The most effective mixing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PSe-PDI might result from the larger torsion angle between selenophene and PDI moieties.56 When the blend films were spin-coated from CB:DIO (0.5 v%) solutions, the phase-separated surface morphology with a larger domain size formed, and the RMS roughness increased to 3.36, 1.49 and 1.69 nm, respectively. The relatively homogeneously mixed p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PX-PDI films without DIO should be more favorable for the exciton diffusion to the interface than the phase-separated blend films with the DIO additive.57 Based on the PX-PDI concentration in the blend films, we deduced that the large aggregated domain is the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2-rich region, which might result from the effect of additive DIO on the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.43 It is consistent with SCLC and PL analyses above, which demonstrate that the addition of DIO enhances the charge transport, but decreases the efficiency of the exciton dissociation.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the OPVs are shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that these three photovoltaic devices showed a broad photocurrent response in 300–750 nm by using CB as a solvent, but with a low EQE value of <20%. The addition of DIO into the solutions drastically increases the EQE values, exhibiting a maximum value of about 40%. The absorption intensities of the films are quite similar between the films with and without DIO addition, so the difference in the EQE spectra could be due to the change in internal quantum efficiency (IQE). IQE can be considered as the product of the efficiencies for exciton diffusion to the donor/acceptor interface (ηED), the charge transfer at the interface (ηCT), the charge dissociation into free charge carriers (ηCD) and the charge collection (ηCC).57,58 The addition of DIO could cause the decrease of ηED through the larger domain size of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 suggested by AFM. Very recently, Nguyen et al. demonstrated that the length of exciton diffusion in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 decreases from ∼6.8 nm of the as-cast film to ∼4.9 nm upon processing with DIO.59 Both the effects could decrease ηED with the addition of DIO. However, the enhanced hole mobility and crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 should largely increase the term of ηCT × ηCD × ηCC, which could compensate the decrease of ηED. Thus, the EQE spectra in the region of 350–750 nm largely increased with the use of DIO for all the three material combinations.60,61

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated fullerene-free OPVs based on unconventional material combination, a molecular donor and polymeric acceptors. The addition of DIO was effective to increase the crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and enhance the hole mobility of the blend films, which could compensate the inferior efficiency for exciton diffusion due to the change of the mixing morphology. The PCE of photovoltaic cells reached 3.01% with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 7.59 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.58 for the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PSe-PDI active layer, where the ratio of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is as high as 80%. The use of MD/PA type combination opens up a new pathway to explore materials for high performance OPVs.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Alfa, Aldrich, TCI or Wako and used without further purification. The PDI-based copolymers PC-PDI, PT-PDI and PSe-PDI were synthesized according to the procedures in the literature.27,62
Characterization
Absorption spectra were measured using a JASCO V-660 spectrometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted in tapping mode with a 5400 scanning probe microscope (Agilent Technologies). 2D GIXRD patterns were measured at an incident angle of 0.12° using synchrotron radiation at beamline BL19B2 of SPring-8. The films were prepared by spin-coating chlorobenzene solutions (with or without DIO) of the polymers (10 g L−1) on Si substrates and thermally annealed at 80 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication and characterization of MD/PA solar cells
Devices with the conventional sandwich structure were fabricated through the following steps. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, water, acetone and 2-propanol by ultrasonication. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) was spin-coated (4000 rpm, 30 s) on ITO after drying the substrate. The film was dried at 150 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 5 min. After cooling the substrate, a blend solution of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and a PDI-based polymer with the total concentration of 20 g L−1 was spin-coated. The substrate was annealed at 80 °C for 30 min inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox to dry the solvent completely, and then a Ca/Al (20 nm/60 nm) electrode was evaporated onto the substrate under high vacuum (10−4–10−5 Pa) in an evaporation chamber (ALS Technology, H-2807 vacuum evaporation system with E-100 load lock). Photovoltaic cells without protective encapsulation were subsequently tested in air under simulated AM1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Peccell Technologies, PCE-L11). The light intensity was adjusted by using a standard silicon solar cell with an optical filter (Bunkou Keiki, BS520). The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 I–V measurement system. The thickness of the active layer was in the range of 100–120 nm measured by using a Dektak 6M surface profilometer (ULVAC). The configuration of the shadow mask afforded eight independent devices on each substrate, with an active layer of ∼0.21 cm2 for each device. The effective area of the devices was defined using a metal photomask (2 mm × 3 mm) during irradiation with simulated solar light. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a Hypermonolight System (Bunkou Keiki, SM-250F).
Hole and electron mobility measurement by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method
Hole- and electron-only devices were fabricated by using the device structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (5 nm)/Au (60 nm) and glass/Al (60 nm)/active layer/Al (60 nm), respectively. The active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution (with or without DIO) with the total concentration of 15 mg mL−1. Both hole and electron mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation in the SCLC region (slope of 2 in the logJ–logV plots):  where ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (assumed to be 3), and L is the thickness of the polymer layer.
