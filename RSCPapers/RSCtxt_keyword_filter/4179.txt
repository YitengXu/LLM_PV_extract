    , Accepted 6th June 2018First published on 7th June 2018AbstractThis work focuses on the development of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecular nonfullerene acceptors to pair traditional and low-cost poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. Different end capped groups, 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene and fused-ring moieties (benzo[b]thiophene and benzo[b]furan), were separately introduced into promising DPP-based nonfullerenes SF-DPP-EH, and three new spiro-DPPs SF-(DPP3F)4, SF-(DPPBT)4 and SF-(DPPBF)4) were obtained. These terminal groups largely extend the conjugation in SF-DPP-EH with an obvious red-shifted absorption (25–43 nm). Of the three new spiro-DPPs, SF-(DPP3F)4 showed the best solubility in common solvents and gave a power conversion efficiency of 1.67% when blended with P3HT. The charge-transfer state (ECT) at the donor–acceptor interface was directly probed through measuring the subbandgap external quantum efficiency (EQE) to estimate the energy loss in spiro-DPP based devices.
Intoduction
In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPV), there is growing interest in developing new electron acceptor materials to replace prevalent fullerene-based acceptors such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).1–5 Although fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM) have superior electron accepting properties, these fullerene derivatives do not significantly contribute to light harvesting at wavelengths greater than 600 nm, and their energy levels cannot be fine-tuned to match the donor materials to maximize the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and minimize the energy loss. Moreover, their high cost is an important obstacle for their industrial application despite the successes in laboratory scale devices. It has been encouragingly shown that, to date, the performances of some non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs exceed those of their fullerene-based control devices.6–14
Two kinds of polymer donor materials have been usually investigated to pair nonfullerene materials in OPVs. One is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and another type is low band gap copolymers with donor–acceptor motifs. Compared with these novel promising low band gap polymers, the traditional P3HT could be easily synthesized using a simple one-step synthetic method and thus demonstrates its large potential to decrease the cost in large scale synthesis. Due to the high-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level (∼−5.0 eV) and negligible absorption in the long-wavelength region of >650 nm, the OPVs with P3HT pairing PCBM showed a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.6 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) of ∼10 mA cm−2 and PCE of ∼4%.15 Li et al. had developed an indene bisadduct of fullerene (ICBA and IC70BM) to lower the LUMO to about 0.2 eV and largely enhance Voc (over 0.8 V), and thus PCE (7.4%).16 However, further improvement of the Voc of a P3HT-based organic solar cell by modulation of fullerene is quite difficult and usually leads to the decrease of the performance.
While, in view of these typical drawbacks for P3HT, one can easily achieve the tailoring of the LUMO level of nonofullerene molecules by modulating their molecular structure. More importantly, their absorption spectra can also be tuned to complement that of P3HT. Expectedly, the P3HT-based nonfullerene OPVs have advanced tremendously over the past several years. To the best of our knowledge, several kinds of nonfullerene exhibited excellent photovoltaic properties with the PCE exceeding 6%.6,17–19 Electron-deficient building blocks, such as benzothiadiazole (BT),20,21 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),22–27 perylenediimide (PDI),26,28–33 naphthalenediimide (NDI),34,35 rhodanine,36–38 and others,39,40 have been widely adopted to construct non-fullerene acceptors.
Compared to other acceptors, DPP based acceptors possess relatively high LUMOs, which contribute to high Voc alongside P3HT. And more, the absorption of DPP derivatives can be red-shifted to more than 600 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of P3HT mainly lying in the range of 300–600 nm. Due to the existence of an intramolecular H-bond, two thiophene rings are nearly coplanar to the DPP core. Some linear DPP based acceptors pairing with P3HT have resulted in relatively large phase separation and exhibited relatively low efficiency despite their high Voc.41,42 Recently, we introduced spirobifluorene (SF) as the core and obtained a non-planar DPP-based acceptor (Scheme 1).43 Unlike propeller-like triphenylamine and tetraphenylmethane(silane) cores, the spirobifluorene (SF) core yields a cross-shaped geometry with two molecular planes perpendicular to each other. Consequently, the two molecular planes still retain the intermolecular interaction with the molecular plane of adjacent molecules. It is worth noting that SF-DPP-EH is the dimer of its linear analogue, DPP1, from its molecular structure.42 Expectedly, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) was significantly improved for P3HT:SF-DPP-EH based OSCs when compared with DPP1 based devices, thus leading to an improved efficiency of 3.63% with a high voltage of 1.10 V. GIXD investigation of the structural order of BHJ thin films indicated that for the P3HT:SF-DPP-EH blends, the SF-DPP-EH crystalline structure was preserved, showing a similar pattern as seen in the pure film. Very recently, Chen, Shi and co-workers reported that capping each DPP of SF-DPP-EH by a phenyl unit further optimized its molecular configuration and extended the absorption of SF-(DPPB)4.44 As a result, the OSCs based on P3HT:SF-(DPPB)4 blended films could exhibit a PCE of 5.16% with a Voc of 1.14 V. Moreover, the efficiency was further enhanced up to 6.09% by using inverted device architectures.17 This efficiency is one of the highest efficiencies for P3HT-based fullerene-free OSCs and the highest efficiency for DPP-based acceptors. These results demonstrated that spiro-DPPs are promising nonfullerene OSC acceptors.
 Scheme 1  The illustration of molecular structure modification. 
However, the film absorption of two spiro-DPPs lies in the range of 500–700 nm and still largely overlaps with that of P3HT (400–600 nm). So, extending the absorption spectrum of spiro-DPPs will further broaden the absorption of the active layer (Scheme 1). Herein, a 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene group and fused-ring moieties (benzo[b]thiophene and benzo[b]furan) were separately capped to SF-DPP-EH and three new spiro-DPPs were obtained. For the three sipro-DPPs, the different terminal groups can yield different electronic structures and morphologies. A detailed investigation of their photophysical and electrochemical properties was performed. Furthermore, these new spiro-DPPs were carefully investigated as nonfullerene acceptors paring with P3HT.
Experimental
Gerenal
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 (1H NMR 400 MHz and 13C NMR 100 MHz) spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetra-methylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. UV absorption spectra were obtained using a Scinco S-3150 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The CV measurement was carried out at room temperature on a CHI660E system in a typical there-electrode cell with a working electrode (glass carbon), a reference electrode (Ag/Ag+, referenced against ferrocene/ferrocenium (FOC), and a counter electrode (Pt wire) in an acetonitrile solution of Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) at a sweeping rate of 100 mV s−1. The thin solid film was solution deposited on the surface of the glass carbon working electrode. Topographic images of the films were obtained on a Veeco MultiMode atomic force microscope in the tapping mode.

All reactions and manipulations were carried out under N2 with the use of standard Schlenk techniques. The other reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.

Device fabrication and characterization
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (80–100 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm). Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. A 40 nm-thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI4083, filtered at 0.45 mm) was spin-coated (3000 rpm) onto the ITO surface. After being baked at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Subsequently, a 100 nm-thin active layer was spin-cast from a blend of the donor (P3HT) and the spiro-DPP acceptor in a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The active layer thickness was measured using a Dektak 150 profilometer. A 10 nm-thin Ca layer was deposited on the active layer under a high vacuum (3 × 10−6 Torr). Finally, a 80 nm-thin Al layer was deposited on the top of the Ca layer under a high vacuum (3 × 10−6 Torr). The effective device area was patterned to be 0.16 cm2 by using a shadow mask. The PCEs were measured in an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) under ambient conditions. The power of the sun simulator was calibrated before testing by using a standard silicon solar cell, giving a value of 100 mW cm−1 in the test. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a solar cell–photodetector responsivity measurement system QE-R (Enlitech Inc.).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
A synthetic route for the three spiro-DPPs is shown in Scheme 2. The synthesis of all small molecules involved two steps. First, the corresponding key intermediate compounds, monocapped DPPs (3F-DPP-Br, BF-DPP-Br and BT-DPP-Br), were synthesized via a selective Suzuki coupling between aryl boronic acid and dibrominated DPP in an acceptable yield. Then, further Suzuki coupling reaction between SF-B and monocapped DPPs at a molar ratio of 1:6 afforded the desired four new spiro-DPPs in moderate yields (40–50%). SF-(DPP3F)4 is soluble in common organic solvents such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. However, SF-(DPPBT)4 and SF-(DPPBF)4 exhibited moderate solubility in these organic solvents.

Photophysical properties
As shown in Fig. 1, similar to SF-DPP-EH, all new spiro-DPPs also show two distinct absorption bands including a weak band in the shorter wavelength region (300–500 nm) and a strong band with a typical vibronic structure in the longer wavelength region (500–700 nm). The absorption maximum at the longer wavelength for SF-DPP-EH is 597 nm, whereas the absorption maximum of SF-(DPP3F)4 was red-shifted to 622 nm. Expectedly, much bigger red shifts are observed for other two spiro-DPPs (36–43 nm), which are capped with the fused-ring arenes. Obviously, the terminal groups largely extend the conjugation in spiro-DPPs. In thin films, all spiro-DPPs exhibited a red-shift (about 30 nm) in absorption, suggesting enhanced π–π interactions. Notably, from dilute solution to film, the absorption of SF-(DPP3F)4 was largely broadened besides notable red-shifts. The absorption edges of films for all three molecules are over 700 nm and the optical band gaps of films are about 1.7–1.8 eV.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out to investigate the electronic structure of new spiro-DPPs. The samples used in the CV measurements were drop-cast from CHCl3 solutions of small molecules on a Pt plate working electrode. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be estimated from the onset potentials for oxidation and reduction from the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset (ox/re) + 4.7) (eV). The CV curves are shown in Fig. 2, and the data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, all the molecules undergo reversible multiple electron oxidations. For SF-(DPP3F)4, reversible reduction was also observed. However, the other two molecules exhibited irreversible reduction.

Nonfullerene organic solar cells
Spiro-DPP acceptors were used in bulk heterojunction solar cells, pairing P3HT as the donor material. OSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/P3HT:spiro-DPPs/Ca(10 nm)/Al(80 nm) and tested under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. Furthermore, a relatively big effective device area of 0.16 cm2 was used for the test. In our previous study, we had carefully performed the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs of P3HT:SF-DPP blends by changing the D/A weight ratios and found that the devices with D/A ratios of 1:1 exhibited the best photovoltaic performance. Therefore, firstly, we fabricated the devices based on P3HT:SF-(DPP3F)4 (1:1) blends. Similar to the high-efficiency SF-DPP-EH acceptor, a high Voc (1.03 eV) was obtained, which was mainly due to the large energy level offset (1.40 eV) between the HOMO (−4.94 eV) of P3HT and the LUMO (−3.54 eV) of SF(DPP3F)4. However, the low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) tend to a extremely low PCE of 0.24%. Encouragingly, an obvious enhancement was observed in the PCEs upon thermal annealing. Indeed, for the optimized device based on the P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 layer (1:1, w/w), an enhancement in Jsc from 1.02 to 4.50 Am cm−2 and in FF from 23.2% to 33.0% results in an obvious improvement of PCE (1.38%) after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. As expected, the introduction of a hole blocking layer (PFN) effectively improved the Jsc and the FF, and then evidently enhanced the PCE (1.67%) (Table 2). The OSCs fabricated from the other two different acceptors SF(DPPBT)4 and SF(DPPBF)4 were optimized on the basis of the same optimal D/A weight ratios (1:1). The three best based devices exhibited low photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.73% for the P3HT:SF(DPPBF)4 blend and below 0.5% for the P3HT: SF(DPPBT)4 blend.

In order to understand the energy loss in spiro-DPP based deices and whether there is further room to improve the photovoltage, we directly probed the charge-transfer (CT) state at the donor–acceptor interface by measuring the subbandgap EQE. Fig. 3 shows the CT region of the EQE spectra and fits the CT band using the equation below:  
 Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves and (c) external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the nonfullerene devices of P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 blends with different D/A weight ratios; (b) J–V curves and (d) EQE curves of the best nonfullerene devices of P3HT:SF(DPPBF)4 and P3HT:SF(DPPBT)4 blends. 
In the equation, E is the photon energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and f is a factor proportional to the number of states. By fitting the equations, the energy ECT, and the reorganization energy λ corresponding to the molecular interaction in the blend can be estimated.

Fig. 4 shows the charge transfer state band to band absorption (EQE) of P3HT blended with SF-DPP-EH or SF(DPP3F)4. A recent study has suggested that the absorption strength of the CT state is three to four orders of magnitude lower than that of the singlet state.45 The ECT values from the fitting are determined to be 1.60 eV for the P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 devices and 1.75 eV for the P3HT:SF-DPP-EH devices. Obviously, the ECT of the P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 blend is lower than that of the P3HT:SF-DPP-EH blend, which is consistent with the difference in the Voc of these two devices. And also, both of them are in good agreement with the empirical relation of Voc = ECT/q − 0.6. The energy loss resulting from charge transfer is given by the difference between the energy of the excited pure P3HT (EP* = 1.9 eV) and the ECT. Apparently, the energy loss is relatively low for both the blends.

Notably, the photoresponse of the singlet state for the P3HT:SF-DPP-EH blend is obviously lower than that of the P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 blend. Since SF-(DPP3F)4 has much broader absorption spectra compared to SF-DPP-EH, the low charge separation efficiency is responsible for the lower EQE. Most probably, low miscibility of SF-(DPP3F)4 in P3HT exists, thus reducing the charge separation efficiency.46
Meanwhile, given the important role of film morphology of the active layer in determining the device performance of OSCs, the surface morphology of the photoactive layers was studied using tapping mode AFM. Fig. 5 shows the height images for the as-cast and thermal annealing (TA) films. For the as-cast films, the blend films of three molecules showed smooth surfaces with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (SF(DPPBF)4: 0.9 nm, SF(DPPBT)4: 0.6 nm, SF(DPP3F)4: 0.6 nm). After thermal annealing, the RMS roughness of active layers slightly increased (SF(DPPBF)4: 1.8 nm, SF(DPPBT)4: 1.0 nm, SF(DPP3F)4: 1.1 nm). This may indicate that the crystallinity of the blend films was improved, which is consistent with the improvement of Jsc.

Conclusion
We separately introduced 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene and fused-ring moieties (benzo[b]thiophene and benzo[b]furan) into promising DPP-based nonfullerenes (SF-DPP-EH), and three new spiro-DPPs (SF-(DPP3F)4, SF-(DPPBT)4 and SF-(DPPBF)4) were obtained. These terminal groups largely extend their conjugation in SF-DPP-EH with an obvious red-shifted absorption (25–43 nm). Due to the introduction of fused-ring moieties, SF-(DPPBT)4 and SF-(DPPBF)4 showed limited solubility. SF-(DPP3F)4 still preserved good solubility in common solvents and gave a power conversion efficiency of 1.67% when blended with P3HT. The ECT values from the fitting are determined to be 1.75 eV for the P3HT:SF-DPP-EH devices and 1.60 eV for the P3HT:SF(DPP3F)4 devices, which means the energy loss is relatively low for both blends.
