Interestingly, we observe the spontaneous formation of 3D phases within either NH4Cl or DMSO treated 2D perovskites, which plays a pivotal role in facilitating charge transport. It is revealed that NH4Cl increases charge carrier lifetime and passivate trap states within the 3D phase while DMSO promotes 2D/3D inter-phase charge transfer. These two competitive processes reach a delicate balance in DMSO and NH4Cl co-treated devices, which deliver a maximum PCE up to 13.41% with excellent air-stability and eliminated hysteresis. This is among the highest values reported for 2D RP perovskite (n = 4) based planar solar cells, particularly via all low-temperature solution fabrication.
During the past several years, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation energy sources with an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 23.7%.1 Despite their skyrocketing development, conventional three-dimensional (3D) perovskites with the formula of ABX3 where A is a monovalent organic cation, B is a divalent metallic compound and X represents a halide anion are unstable when exposed to light, heat or moisture during operation, which impede their commercial applications. In contrast, the emerging two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites have recently attracted increasing attention due to their superior ambient stability afforded by the hydrophobic nature of newly introduced organic spacers. The typical formula of 2D RP perovskites is L2An−1BnX3n+1 where L represents the large organic cation and n is the layer number of inorganic slabs between two spacers.2–4 Based on the representative L such as n-butylamine (n-BA) and phenethylamine (PEA), 2D RP perovskite solar cells have demonstrated the best PCEs of 13.70% (ref. 5) and 11.01%,6 respectively, both of which are however far behind those of traditional 3D counterparts. The inferior device performance of 2D RP perovskites originates from two major limiting factors—the morphology randomness inhibiting charge transportation and the large exciton binding energy (Eb) restricting charge separation.7
Several means have been demonstrated to be effective in regulating the crystallization process and film morphology of 2D perovskites. For instance, an incorporation of an NH4SCN additive into PEA and BA based 2D perovskites resulted in preferential vertical orientation and trap passivation,6,8 while cesium doping was found to efficiently reduce trap-state density.5 However, they all require an additional thermal annealing step to remove the residual additives or promote the crystallinity in perovskite thin films, which is difficult to accurately control because an excessive thermal annealing would lead to the accelerated degradation of perovskites and the poor reproducibility of solar cells.9 It is therefore desirable to develop an alternate room-temperature fabrication strategy to achieve both a favorable film morphology and reduced trap density in 2D RP perovskites, which still remains a huge challenge.10
Moreover, the large Eb of 2D RP perovskites would deter the interfacial charge separation in solar cells, leading to not only low open-circuit voltage (VOC)11 but also severe hysteresis phenomena.12 An integration of 3D phases with 2D RP perovskites has manifested as one feasible way to aid in charge separation.13 The formed quasi-2D perovskites comprise the structures of either 3D:2D mixtures14–20 or 3D/2D bilayers21–26. For instance, the Snaith group added n-BA+ into benchmark 3D perovskites of mixed-cation/halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(IyBr1−y)3.13 The highly oriented 3D phases were surrounded by 2D phases, resulting in suppressed nonradiative charge recombination. This phenomenon was also found in a 2D/3D (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite junction.21 The optimal alignment of graded energy bands provided a continuous upshift of the LUMO energy level in the 3D/2D perovskite structure, which facilitated charge transfer from the perovskite to the electron-transporting layer and also prevented the backflow of electron carriers, thus retarding both charge recombination and ion migration.25 However, in the above examples, the foreign 3D phases were purposely added. In contrast, we recently reported the spontaneous formation of 3D phases by replacing the long linear spacer n-BA+ with a short branched isomer iso-BA+ in 2D perovskites, which efficiently collected the confined charges within 2D phases and then transported them with faster carrier mobility and slower recombination rates.27,28
In this study, we seek to further investigate the influences of such internally generated 3D phases within 2D RP perovskites on improving the film morphology and charge transportation. We therefore conducted a detailed study on the paradigm 2D RP perovskite—(PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4) as a proof-of-concept. PEA-based 2D RP perovskites are generated by one-step room-temperature solution-fabrication with the assistance of an NH4Cl additive and DMSO solvent. We previously demonstrated the room-temperature fabrication of highly crystalline and densely covered 3D CH3NH3PbI3 thin films by exploiting a volatile NH4Cl additive.29 Such high-quality perovskite films can also be obtained by using DMSO solvent via the formation of a CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase.30 Thus we anticipate that such morphological optimization modulated by using either an NH4Cl additive or DMSO solvent can also be achieved in 2D RP perovskites. As a result, the NH4Cl additive can facilitate the crystallization of the 3D phase and thus largely increase charge carrier lifetime and suppress trap states while inhibiting charge transport between 2D and 3D phases. In contrast, the DMSO solvent plays a pivotal role in enhancing the crystal orientation of perovskites and optimizing the 2D/3D interfaces, both of which significantly accelerate inter-phase charge transfer. The competition between charge carrier lifetime within 3D phases and inter-phase charge transfer finally achieves a delicate balance under the synergistic effect of both NH4Cl and DMSO addition, which yields highly efficient, reproducible and stable solar cells, delivering a maximum PCE up to 13.41% based on PEA 2D perovskites.
The PEA based 2D RP perovskites film were made by one-step spin-coating from DMF solution at room temperature. The stoichiometric ratio between PEA and MA in the pristine precursor was kept as 2:3 mol%. A small amount of NH4Cl, DMSO or both of them was then added into the precursors to regulate the crystallization process of 2D perovskites (see the ESI,† for detailed procedures). In the following discussion, those obtained perovskites based on the PEA cation—(PEA)2MA3Pb4I13, (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 with an NH4Cl additive, (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 with DMSO solvent, and (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 with both NH4Cl and DMSO are denoted as PEA, PEA + NH4Cl, PEA + DMSO and PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO perovskites, respectively.

Fig. 1a displays the crystal structure of PEA based 2D RP perovskites (n = 4) where four layers of inorganic [Pb6]4− octahedra are sandwiched between the organic spacer cations. Fig. 1b shows the optical absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all these four samples. All samples exhibit distinctive exciton bands around 560, 600 and 640 nm in the absorption spectra, which are correlated with 2D phases with n = 2–4, respectively. It is worth noting that the addition of both NH4Cl and DMSO can enhance the absorbance intensity of 2D perovskites, in which the latter has a more pronounced effect. Such absorption enhancement may result from the dense and uniform nature of the 2D perovskite films with a larger grain size, which increases light harvesting.31 In addition, an absorption onset at about 715 nm is observed for NH4Cl or DMSO treated samples, suggesting the formation of extra quasi-3D bulk phases. This result is in accordance with our previous report that mixed 2D and 3D phases with various quantum well thicknesses (i.e., n) coexisted in 2D perovskite films.28 We then studied their PL spectra as shown in Fig. 1b. As compared to neat PEA showing the main PL peak at 715 nm, either NH4Cl or DMSO treated samples exhibit similar red-shifted PL bands at 731 nm, while the synergistic effect of the NH4Cl additive and DMSO solvent further red-shifts the PL peak to 763 nm, which can be assigned to the 3D phase. Besides, PEA + NH4Cl, PEA + DMSO and PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO perovskites all show additional shoulder bands at 573, 617 and 648 nm, corresponding to n = 2–4 phases, respectively. Note that the extra small peaks at 820 nm come from the instrumental noise.

Fig. 1c presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these four samples in the diffraction region of 3.0–10.0° and their corresponding parameters such as the d-spacing and full width at half maximum (FWHM) are displayed in Table S1.† All these samples feature two main diffraction peaks around 14.10° and 28.50°, which are assigned to the (110) and (202) lattice planes of the orthorhombic halide perovskite, respectively.32 On the one hand, the peak intensity is largely enhanced upon the addition of NH4Cl yet weakened by DMSO solvent, giving rise to moderated intensity in the NH4Cl and DMSO co-treated sample (Fig. 1c). On the other hand, as shown in Table S1,† those two main peaks gradually shift towards higher angles in the sequence of PEA, PEA + NH4Cl and PEA + DMSO, and then move slightly towards lower angles in PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO perovskite. This is a manifestation of unit cell expansion upon NH4Cl or DMSO treatment and then a bit shrinkage when subjected to both treatments. Furthermore, the d-spacing of these samples follows such a similar trend that it becomes narrower and then broader in PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO perovskite. Interestingly, the FWHM has an opposite trend—firstly larger and then smaller. All the above phenomena imply that the lattice matching is the most balanced in the PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO sample. Moreover, they all exhibit the diffraction peaks at low angles (e.g., 5.67, 6.49, 8.00 and 9.51 degrees), which confirms the formation of 2D RP perovskite structures (Fig. 1d).33 In particular, the samples treated with DMSO solvent—either single or dual additions display more pronounced peaks at low angles, which clearly indicates enhanced crystallinity and lattice ordering of the 2D phase under the assistance of DMSO.
After verifying the existence of 2D RP perovskite phases by using XRD patterns, we performed grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies to acquire in-depth information regarding the crystal packing and orientation. As shown in Fig. 2, the scattering patterns reveal two major characteristics of 2D perovskites. The pristine PEA perovskite exhibits continuous Debye–Scherrer rings with homogeneous intensity distribution implying that the crystals in the thin film are almost randomly oriented (Fig. 2a), similar to a previous report.6 This orientation ordering is slightly enhanced by the addition of NH4Cl as indicated by the spot along the segments of qz = 1.4 and 1.7 Å−1 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2c, the DMSO treated perovskite displays sharp and discrete Bragg spots along the same rings while the rings around qz = 1 and 2 Å−1 disappear, indicating the formation of well-aligned perovskite crystals. Moreover, the (101) spot along qz as well as the (101) and (202) spots along in-plane (qxy) show up, suggesting the vertical growth of crystal grains.14 However, the combined effects of NH4Cl and DMSO will slightly reduce the crystal orientation (Fig. 2d). In short, it is expected that the vertically oriented 2D perovskite thin film caused by NH4Cl and DMSO dual-addition provides a direct path for both electron and hole transport, while the charge transport is slightly hindered in an excessively oriented sample treated with DMSO alone.

Apart from the crystallinity, the film morphology was further evaluated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images as shown in Fig. 3. The pristine PEA perovskite film features cross-linked rod-like crystals of ∼100 nm. Upon addition of NH4Cl, the crystals grow longer into overlapped nanorods with an average size of ∼1 μm. This is also verified by the narrower full width half maximum (FWHM) and the enhanced crystallinity in the PEA + NH4Cl sample than the neat PEA thin film as shown in Fig. 1c. On the other hand, the Lewis base of DMSO forms an adduct with PbI2 (Lewis acid), which modulates the crystallization and results in smoother surfaces. Dual treatments of NH4Cl and DMSO integrate both effects and lead to a densely packed morphology. It is noted that the rod-like crystals are the edges of vertically aligned 2D flakes as shown in Fig. S1.†

Given these diverse effects of the NH4Cl additive and DMSO solvent on PEA based 2D perovskite thin films, we investigated the performance of their planar solar cells in a device architecture as schematically shown in Fig. 4a. The representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves under reverse scan and standard AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 4b, and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The device based on neat PEA perovskite exhibits poor performance with a PCE of 5.47% and a certain hysteresis phenomenon (Fig. S2a†), which agrees well with a previous report.2 After adding NH4Cl, the JSC, VOC, FF and PCE rise up to 10.78 mA cm−2, 1.00 V, 69% and 7.44%, respectively. Moreover, the device hysteresis is largely suppressed (Fig. S2b†), which can be attributed to the enhanced 3D phase crystallinity and reduced trap density afforded by NH4Cl addition. Furthermore, the devices fabricated from DMSO treated films exhibit a significant increase of JSC to 12.13 mA cm−2 and PCE to 9.41%, respectively. However, the hysteresis phenomenon still exists (Fig. S2c†). Under the synergetic effect of NH4Cl and DMSO dual treatments, the PCE is remarkably increased up to 13.41% with JSC = 18.78 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.14 V and FF = 62%.

An average PCE of ∼11.8% is obtained over 37 devices as shown in Fig. S3.† Importantly, negligible hysteresis is found in these optimal devices (Fig. S2d†), which is also supported by the little variation of the hysteresis index when changing the scan rate from 20, 50, 100 to 200 mV s−1 (Table S3†). This is the best performance achieved by far for 2D RP perovskite solar cells, not to mention the room-temperature fabrication. We also notice that the VOC of the samples after DMSO treatment is increased from ∼1.0 V to ∼1.1 V, while that of the NH4Cl treated sample remains invariable. The plausible reason is that DMSO enhances the lattice orientation of perovskites as proved by GIWAXS and hence aids in charge transfer from 2D to 3D phases, thereby effectively inhibiting charge recombination within 2D phases. Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of these four sets of samples. The integrated photocurrent is 17.15 mA cm−2 for the PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO sample, which however deviates from the JSC (18.78 mA cm−2) obtained from the J–V measurement at reverse scan because the preferential orientation of the as-prepared 2D perovskites interferes with the polarization of the excitation light. Finally, we measured the PCE of the optimal NH4Cl and DMSO co-treated PEA perovskite based solar cells over light illumination time by fixing the voltage at a maximum power point of 0.9 V (Fig. 4d). The output power remains steady over 500 s with a stabilized Jsc of 14.06 mA cm−2 and PCE of 12.67%.
Of crucial importance, all the above-mentioned samples present excellent ambient stability after storing in an environmental chamber with a relative humidity (RH) of 60% in air and at 30 °C for 15 days (Fig. S4a†). After aging for 30 days, the control PEA sample and the ones with single treatment both show degradation at the edge of the thin film, while the optimal perovskite film with dual treatments remains smooth and brownish. Fig. S4b† compares the optical absorbance of all these tested 2D perovskite films. After the storage for 30 days, the absorbances of neat PEA and NH4Cl or DMSO-treated samples decrease rapidly by ∼50% and ∼30%, respectively, whereas the PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO sample preserves ∼83% of the initial absorbance value. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO sample shows ∼24% loss after aging under the same conditions for 10 days (Fig. S5†). Moreover, under the same storage conditions, we tested the stability of the optimal co-treated perovskite devices without encapsulation. Fig. S6† displays the J–V curves of the device after aging for 15 days in the dark and under light illumination, which still retains an excellent diode characteristic and a high PCE of 10.94% with little hysteresis. The PCE is 81.6% of the original value and in stark contrast with that of the 3D MAPbI3 reference device, which retains 80.5% of the initial PCE after aging for 1.5 h under the same storage conditions. In short, the superior performance and stability of 2D RP perovskites after NH4Cl and DMSO dual treatments originates presumably from the increased crystal grains, reduced intragranular defects and grain boundaries, and improved vertical orientation in the thin film, which permit efficient charge extraction while suppressing carrier recombination.
In order to interpret each role of NH4Cl and DMSO addition in the resulting 2D perovskite, time-resolved PL spectroscopy studies were carried out as shown in Fig. S7.† We fitted the PL decay kinetics to a biexponential function containing two decay processes and the results are summarized in Table S2,† in which the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) components are considered to be nonradiative and radiative decays, respectively.34,35 We can compare the PL dynamics of all samples by using the average PL lifetime 〈τ〉 calculated as: (1)
The 〈τ〉s of PEA samples follow the same trend when NH4Cl or DMSO treatment is applied, that is, PEA < PEA + NH4Cl < PEA + DMSO. This indicates a suppression of non-radiative charge recombination paths in 2D perovskites by both treatments, which is ascribed to the diminished defect/trap states. When the samples are co-treated with both NH4Cl and DMSO, the prolonging of 〈τ〉 becomes not so pronounced in PEA based 2D perovskites. This phenomenon can also be revealed by other spectroscopic studies in the following section.
The diminishing of trap/defect states by both NH4Cl and DMSO addition can be further confirmed by absolute PL quantum yield (PLQY) measurements. Note that PLQY refers to the ratio between overall nonradiative recombination and radiative recombination of the photogenerated charges. By these two modification strategies, an enhancement of PLQY can be observed in both PEA based samples with the same trend, that is, PEA < PEA + NH4Cl < PEA + DMSO < PEA + NH4Cl + DMSO as shown in Fig. S8.†
Both TRPL and PLQY results only offer collective information of the charge carrier recombination in the studied systems. The ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectra were then measured to fingerprint the detailed charge carrier dynamics within each phase of these 2D perovskite films. We excited all the samples with a fs laser pulse at 400 nm with photon energy well above Egs. As mentioned above, solution processed 2D perovskite films are generally a mixture of 2D and 3D phases including pure 2D phases (n ≤ 4), quasi-3D phases (n = 5–20), and neat 3D phases (n > 20) characteristic of reduced Eg due to the weakening of quantum confinement.36 After photoexcitation, the photogenerated charges/excitons would populate at the lowest states of each phase after thermalization, which respond to signature negative bleach bands at different wavelengths in TA spectrograms. They include the bleach of 2Dn=2 (575 nm), 2Dn=3 (610 nm), 2Dn=4 (640 nm), quasi-3D (650–740 nm), and 3D (750 nm) phases as shown in Fig. 5a–d (blue areas). The time evolution of those bleach bands represents the transportation and recombination of photo-generated charge carriers within and across various phases.28 In general, the bleach bands are narrower in wavelength and prolonged in time by NH4Cl and DMSO addition, which correlate with the confined phases and extended excited state lifetime, respectively, and also coincide with the above conclusions derived from XRD and PLQY results.

To identify the charge carrier recombination and transportation pathways, we conducted singular value decomposition (SVD) fitting for all the samples as also depicted in Fig. 5a–d. All the TA spectra can be fitted into one fast (black curve) and one slow component (red curve). The slow components of all samples contain a pronounced bleach band at the red side, which can be attributed to the long-lived charge carriers mainly located at quasi-3D or neat 3D phases. The fast components of the neat PEA sample show characteristic negative bleach bands of 2D phases with the maximum at 2Dn=2 (575 nm), 2Dn=3 (610 nm) and 2Dn=4 (640 nm), which can be assigned to the short-lived charge carriers (Fig. 5a). Under the treatments of NH4Cl + DMSO, the spectral features of the fast components become negative bands at 2D phases and positive bands at quasi-3D or neat 3D phases concurrently (Fig. 5b–d). According to our previous studies, this is a distinct fingerprint of inter-phase charge transfer from 2D to 3D phases.28 Based on the above analysis, we summarize the charge carrier dynamics after photoexcitation in all 4 samples in Fig. 5e, from which we can demonstrate the influences of PEA spacing cation and DMSO/NH4Cl addition on the photo-induced charge carrier dynamics as follows. (1) After NH4Cl addition, the main bleach band of the slow components is red shifted to 750 nm with an increased amplitude and reduced bandwidth compared to the fast components (Fig. 5b). This means that the 3D phases in 2D perovskite films are significantly enhanced with improved crystallinity as evidenced by previous XRD results. As a consequence, the lifetimes of the slow components are dramatically increased from 1.5 ns in neat PEA based samples to 15 ns after NH4Cl addition with diminished defect/trap states. Such enhanced 3D phases can collect the confined charges within 2D phases and transport them with faster carrier mobility to boost the device efficiency.28 The reduced trap states could also diminish the accumulation of charge carriers at the interface of the electrodes. Moreover, the ferroelectric polarization domains, which are mainly believed to account for J–V hysteresis, become less pronounced in pure 3D phases with high crystallinity.37 Both the effects are responsible for the suppressed hysteresis in the NH4Cl treated sample (Fig. S2b†).38 (2) DMSO will slow down the perovskite crystallization process during spin-coating by forming an intermediate phase.30,39 DMSO addition could also help form 3D phases as shown in Fig. 5c yet with less contribution (i.e., a smaller amplitude of the 3D bleach bands) and worse crystallinity (i.e., a larger band width of the 3D bleaches) compared to NH4Cl addition, probably due to the residual DMSO left in the perovskite film which cannot be completely removed due to its high boiling point. This explains the remaining hysteresis in DMSO treated devices as noted above. On the other hand, the inter-phase charge transfer from 2D to 3D phases in DMSO treated samples is greatly improved with a charge transfer time of 92 ps in the PEA + DMSO sample. Those values are much higher than those of NH4Cl treated samples (262 ps for PEA + NH4Cl). Therefore, we conclude that DMSO mainly acts to improve the interfacial charge transfer between 2D and 3D phases, which can be well interpreted from the GIWAXS profiles showing that all DMSO treated samples exhibit the best orientation orneriness. The reason is that the ordered orientation would maximize the electronic coupling between 2D and 3D phases and minimize the interfacial defects, both of which facilitate the inter-phase charge transfer.12 The improved 2D/3D interfaces can also validate the larger PLQY of DMSO treated samples than NH4Cl treated ones despite faster charge recombination rates in 3D phases as shown in Fig. S6† since the interfacial trapping or other non-radiative recombination could be suppressed. This is also the possible reason for the larger VOC obtained from Fig. 4b. (3) For NH4Cl + DMSO treated samples in PEA based 2D perovskites, the lifetime of slow components is shorter than that of NH4Cl treated samples and longer than that of DMSO treated ones while the inter-phase charge transfer rate is faster than that of NH4Cl treated samples and slower than that of DMSO treated samples as shown in Fig. 5e. This means that the 3D phase enhancement induced by NH4Cl addition and the efficient inter-phase charge transfer caused by DMSO addition are competing with each other in 2D perovskite thin films. The best performance of NH4Cl + DMSO treated devices should result from the optimal balance between those two effects.
In summary, we have demonstrated the low-temperature fabrication of highly efficient 2D RP perovskite solar cells with the aid of an NH4Cl additive and DMSO solvent. Both treatments are found to strongly impact the film morphology and charge transportation in perovskites. Importantly, the generation of 3D phases is observed within either NH4Cl or DMSO treated perovskites, leading to improved charge separation as suggested by time-resolved spectroscopic results. The individual roles of these two treatments are unraveled as below. The NH4Cl additive mainly functions to increase the crystallization of the 3D phase, prolong the charge carrier lifetime and diminish trap/defect states. In contrast, the DMSO solvent acts to weaken the crystallization of the 3D phase yet enhance the crystal orientation of perovskites and optimize the 2D/3D interfaces, thereby facilitating inter-phase charge transfer. These two competitive processes achieve an optimal balance in the DMSO and NH4Cl co-treated device, which gives rise to a maximum PCE up to 13.41% in planar solar cells with excellent ambient stability and eliminated hysteresis. This work offers a versatile yet viable avenue toward highly efficient and stable 2D RP perovskite optoelectronics. This has been exemplified by our parallel work on photodiodes40 and one more recent study by Gao and coworkers on aligned and graded 2D perovskite films for efficient solar cells.41
