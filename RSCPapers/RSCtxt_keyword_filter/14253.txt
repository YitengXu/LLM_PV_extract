    , Accepted 4th December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractIn this study, we demonstrated a self-deposition method to deposit Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on graphene woven fabrics (GWF) to improve the performance of graphene-on-silicon solar cells. The deposition of Pt NPs increased the work function of GWF and reduced the sheet resistance of GWF, thereby improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of graphene-on-silicon solar cells. The PCE (>10%) was further enhanced via solid electrolyte coating of the hybrid Schottky junction in the photoelectrochemical solar cells. These results suggest that the combination of self-deposition of Pt NPs and solid-state electrolyte coating of graphene-on-silicon is a promising way to produce high performance graphene-on-semiconductor solar cells.
Introduction
Two-dimensional graphene (Gr) has attracted tremendous attention because of its unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical properties and many potential applications.1–3 Transferring Gr onto silicon produces a Schottky junction, which can operate as a solar cell under illumination.4 In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying Gr in n-type silicon Schottky junctions to produce Gr/n-Si solar cells.5–10 Gr/n-Si solar cells can help in avoiding the complex fabrication processes of traditional Si solar cells. However, the devices based on the pristine Gr only show the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) less than 6%.11,12 The low PCE is caused by the low work function and imperfect conductivity of pristine Gr, as well as the high carrier recombination rate at the Gr/n-Si interface.9,13,14
Recently, various approaches have been employed to improve the efficiency of Gr/Si solar cells. These efforts include altering the network structure (incorporation of Gr woven fabrics (GWF),15,16 deposition of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on Gr,17 and chemical doping of Gr,18), controlling the number of layers of Gr,6,19 controlling the thickness of the interfacial oxide at the Gr/n-Si interface,20 using Si nanostructure arrays to enhance light absorption,16,21–23 engineering the Gr/n-Si interface,22,24 and applying an antireflection coating.4,5 Among them, the deposition of Au NPs on Gr (Au–Gr) is one of the most popular methods, which offers the opportunity to not only control the work function of graphene but also improve its electrical conductivity.9,25 The PCE of solar cells with Au–Gr on n-type silicon (Au–Gr/n-Si) can reach 7.36%.17 However, further improvement of the PCE is limited by the reduced light transmittance caused by Au NPs.17 Because Pt has a higher work function than Au, the surface properties of GWF can be properly turned using a smaller amount of Pt NPs than that needed using Au NPs. Traditional methods to deposit Pt NPs on graphene usually require complicated procedures,26 limiting the application of Pt NPs in solar cells.
Herein, we aimed to develop a self-deposition method for in situ galvanic synthesis of Pt NPs on GWF to generate Pt-GWF. We report the development of high-efficiency GWF/n-Si Schottky junction solar cells by depositing Pt NPs on GWF and decorating GWF with embedded solid electrolytes. Pt NPs deposition on GWF resulted in p-type doping of graphene and was observed to be an effective approach for achieving high work function and enhanced electrical conductivity of graphene, compared to other approaches. A maximum PCE of 7.94% was achieved for n-type silicon solar cells with Pt-GWF (Pt-GWF/n-Si). The PCE of Pt-GWF/n-Si was further enhanced to 10.02% by the decoration of solid electrolyte on Pt-GWF/n-Si.
Experimental
Preparation of GWF
GWF was generated using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) with a copper mesh as the substrate. The copper mesh was cut into a proper size and rinsed with hydrochloric acid and ethyl alcohol to remove the surface oxide layer and contaminants. Then, it was placed into a quartz tube in a CVD reactor. The CVD reactor was heated to 1000 °C at 10 °C min−1 under Ar (300 mL min−1) and H2 (45 mL min−1). Subsequently, the flow of H2 was stopped and the flow rate of Ar was set to 200 mL min−1. CH4 was introduced at 20 mL min−1 for 15 min. Finally, the mesh was quickly cooled to room temperature. After etching the copper mesh with a FeCl3/HCl solution (FeCl3: 1 mol L−1; HCl: 0.5 mol L−1), GWF was obtained. GWF was further rinsed by deionized (DI) water for 4 h to completely remove the residual ions.
Assembly of the GWF/n-Si solar cells
Single crystal n-type silicon (400 μm, 2–4 Ω cm) with a 300 nm thick patterned SiO2 surface layer was used as the solar cell substrate. The substrate was rinsed by acetone to remove organic impurities. The top side had a 0.11 cm2 Si window. The bottom side was coated with Ti (10 nm)/Au (50 nm) through e-beam evaporation. Then, the prepared GWF was transferred onto the substrate to generate the GWF/n-Si solar cells. Au wires were connected to the surface of GWF with silver paint.
Self-deposition of Pt NPs
The positive (GWF) and negative (n-Si) electrodes of the GWF/n-Si solar cell were connected by a conducting wire. Chloroplatinic acid solution (10 mM) was added to the Si window on the GWF/n-Si solar cell, followed by illumination at 82 mW cm−2 for 3–15 min using a solar simulator. After illuminating, the remaining chloroplatinic acid solution on the solar cell was removed.
Preparation and spin-coating of solid electrolytes
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (0.5 g) was added to DI water (10 mL) under stirring. The solution was then heated to 75 °C till PVA was completely dissolved. The PVA and nitric acid (PVA + HNO3) solid electrolyte was obtained by further adding 0.97 g of 1 M HNO3 (mass fraction: 65–68%) solution into the PVA gel at room temperature. To obtain a hybrid solar cell, the solid electrolyte was spin-coated on Pt-GWF/Si at 5000 rpm for 60 s.
Characterizations
A Newport 69907 solar simulator was used to measure the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells under AM 1.5. The illumination intensity was calibrated to 82 mW cm−2. A Keithley 2601A SourceMeter was used to collect current–voltage (I–V) data. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO 1530, 5 kV) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, 120–200 kV) were used for morphology and structure characterizations. A Raman spectroscope (Renishaw, RM2000, He–Ne laser excitation at 514 nm) was used for structure characterization. An Agilent Carry 5000 spectrophotometer was used for transmittance measurement. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) were employed for the work function measurement and elemental content analysis.
Results and discussion
GWF was transferred onto n-Si to produce GWF/n-Si solar cells (Fig. 1a). The PCE of pristine GWF/n-Si solar cells is 3–5%. To deposit Pt NPs onto GWF, chloroplatinic acid was added to the Si window on the pristine GWF/n-Si solar cells (Fig. 1b). A conducting wire was used to connect GWF and n-Si. Then, a solar simulator was used to illuminate the device, which resulted in the deposition of Pt onto GWF. This self-deposition approach realized in situ galvanic synthesis of Pt-GWF on a silicon wafer by the deposition of Pt NPs directly onto GWF, combining the photo-assisted deposition (PAD) method27 and the electrochemical deposition method.28

In this process, electrons from n-Si were exported. The conducting wire transferred the electrons to chloroplatinic acid, enabling a series of reduction reactions of [PtCl6]2− to [PtCl4]2− and eventually to Pt.28 This self-deposition approach neither needs complex procedures to prepare Pt NPs29 nor a metal substrate as the sacrificial layer to provide electrons for depositing Pt NPs,30 thereby avoiding defects on Pt-GWF. Fig. 1c shows the schematic diagram of Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells with Pt NPs deposited on the surface of GWF.
As shown in Fig. 2, Sample A and B represent the pristine GWF/n-Si solar cells. Sample C is the Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cell generated by photo-assisted deposition of Pt NPs on Sample A (10 min deposition time). The photo-assisted deposition method27 is similar to the self-deposition method but without the conducting wire. Sample D is Pt-GWF/Si generated by the self-deposition approach on Sample B (10 min deposition time). The PCE of Sample C was enhanced from 4.23% to 6.87% (Fig. 2a). The PCE of Sample D was improved from 4.10% to 7.94%. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the Pt-GWF/n-Si deposited with Pt NPs by self-deposition has higher PCE compared to Pt-GWF/n-Si assembled by photo-assisted deposition with the same deposition time of 10 min. Moreover, the PCE of 7.94% is higher than the previously reported PCE (7.36%) obtained by doping of Au NPs on graphene.17

As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the series resistance (Rs) of the solar cell decreased from 11.6 to 10.0 Ω cm2 for Sample C and from 11.2 to 9.3 Ω cm2 for Sample D, while the shunt resistance (Rsh) of the solar cell increased from 336 to 1019 Ω cm2 for Sample C and from 1155 to 3835 Ω cm2 for Sample D. The decrease of Rs and the increase of Rsh contributed to the improvement of the PCE.17 Pt NPs improved both the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) of the solar cells. Under the same conditions as those for Pt NPs deposition, the self-deposition method (Sample D) is superior to the photo-assisted deposition method (Sample C).
There are three reasons for the enhancement in the PCEs of solar cells: (i) the Pt NPs improved the work function of GWF and thus resulted in an enhanced built-in electric field with increased Voc and Rsh; (ii) the Pt NPs reduced the sheet resistance of GWF and led to an increase in Jsc and a decrease in Rs; and (iii) the metal was placed close to the interface between two dielectrics (air and GWF/n-Si interface), thus light scattered preferentially into the dielectric with a larger permittivity, i.e., the GWF/n-Si interface. (iii) The scattered light then acquired an angular spread in the GWF/n-Si interface, causing an increase in the optical path length.31 As a result, the incident light was better absorbed by n-Si to produce more photocarriers.
To investigate the structural and morphological changes of GWF/n-Si solar cells after the deposition of Pt NPs, a comparative study was performed on pristine GWF and Pt GWF. Top-view optical images and SEM images of GWF/n-Si and Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Because the Pt NPs were too small to be observed (Fig. 3a), TEM was used to identify the Pt NPs (Fig. 3b). The distance between the adjacent lattice fringes was 0.225 nm, corresponding to the interplanar space of the {111} plane of the face-centered cubic modification by Pt.32

XPS spectra were obtained to measure the content of Pt NPs on GWF. Fig. 3c shows the XPS spectrum of pristine GWF, and Fig. 3d shows the XPS spectrum of Pt-GWF deposited with Pt NPs. The atomic ratio of Pt is 0.5%. The major peaks at 71.2 and 74.6 eV in Fig. 3d can be assigned to the zero valence state of Pt. In addition, the peak at 74.6 eV may be attributed to the interaction between Pt NPs and graphene.33
The relationship between the deposition time and the performance of Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the solar cells deposited with Pt NPs for 10 to 15 min showed higher PCEs than the cells deposited with Pt NPs for 5 min. Transmission spectra of GWF and Pt-GWF are shown in Fig. 4b. The deposition of Pt NPs reduced the sheet resistance of GWF (Fig. 4c) without significantly perturbing the transmittance of GWF. GWF and Pt-GWF were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4d). The two prominent peaks in the Raman spectra represent the G-band (∼1584 cm−1) and the 2D-band (∼2700 cm−1). The 2D-band and G-band of GWF did not shift upon Pt deposition, similar to the result for multi-layer graphene deposited with Au NPs.34 It is worth noting that when excessive Pt NPs were deposited onto GWF (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†), the PCE of the cells declined. The J–V curve of the solar cell with excessive deposition of Pt NPs is shown in Fig. S3c (ESI†). The decrease in the PCE was mainly caused by the reduced light transmittance due to the surface accumulation of Pt NPs.

Fig. 5 shows the UPS spectra of Ag, GWF/n-Si, and Pt-GWF/n-Si. The Fermi edge (EFermi) of Ag is same as that of GWF/n-Si and Pt-GWF/n-Si, as the Fermi edge is determined by the test condition. The right panel of Fig. 5a shows a magnified view of the region near the Fermi edge for Ag, and the EFermi is 21.68 eV. The right panel of Fig. 5b shows the secondary electron cut-off region of GWF/n-Si (EGWF-Si-cutoff, 4.85 eV) and Pt-GWF/n-Si (EPt-GWF-Si-cutoff, 5.15 eV). The relationship among Ecutoff, EFermi, the energy of excitation source (hν, 21.22 eV), and the work function (Φ) is shown in eqn (1). Φ = hν + ECutoff − EFermi(1)

According to eqn (1), the work function of GWF/n-Si (ΦGWF-Si) and Pt-GWF/n-Si (ΦPt-GWF-Si) was calculated as 4.39 eV and 4.69 eV, respectively. As the GWF did not fully cover the silicon wafer, the UPS measurement covered both the GWF and n-Si, resulting in a lower value of the work function of GWF/n-Si (ΦGWF-Si), compared to that of the work function of GWF (ΦGWF). Thus, ΦGWF-Si can be calculated as follows: (2)where ΦC–Si is the work function of coating/n-Si structure, Φn-Si is the work function of n-Si, Sn-Si is the area of exposed n-Si, ΦC is the work function of the coating materials, and SC is the area of coating. The UPS spectra of n-Si and graphene were collected. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the work function of n-Si (Φn-Si) is 3.91 eV. The area ratio of GWF and n-Si is ∼2.3 (Fig. S4c, ESI†). According to eqn (2), ΦGWF is derived to be 4.60 eV, which is comparable to the work function of graphene (4.64 eV, Fig. S4b, ESI†). In the self-deposition method, GWF was contacted with a back electrode, which caused more photoelectrons to move from the back electrode to GWF. As the reduction process from [PtCl6]2− to Pt occurred,28 more Pt NPs formed on the surface of GWF, suggesting that the major improvement of ΦPt-GWF-Si originated from the improvement of ΦPt-GWF. The work function of Pt-GWF (ΦPt-GWF) was calculated to be 5.03 eV. The improvement in ΦGWF has a great influence on the Fermi level of GWF/n-Si. The energy band diagrams of the GWF/n-Si and Pt-GWF/n-Si junctions are shown in Fig. 5c and d. The down-shifts of the Fermi level caused increment in the barrier height and depletion region, which further influenced the Voc and Jsc.9
To further enhance the PCE of the Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells, solid electrolyte (HNO3 + PVA) was coated onto the Pt-GWF/n-Si surface to fabricate hybrid heterojunctions and solid-state photoelectrochemical solar cells.15Fig. 6a shows the schematic diagram of a Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cell coated with the solid electrolyte on the surface. Photoexcited charge carriers generated in n-Si were separated by the built-in field, where electrons are directed to the n-Si region and holes move toward the GWF (yellow arrows).35 The n-Si and the redox electrolyte also create a photoelectrochemical cell with the GWF counter electrode.

(c) Light J–V curves of GWF/n-Si, Pt-GWF/n-Si, solid electrolyte coated GWF/n-Si and solid electrolyte coated Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells. 
In a typical photochemical process, the holes driven to the n-Si surface are captured by NO3− ions, which diffuse to GWF, and then are reduced back to NO3−. This redox reaction forms a photoelectrochemical channel for charge carriers. Fig. 6b shows the energy diagram of the solid electrolyte coated Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cell in the dark. The upper left part of Fig. 6b shows the energy diagram of the GWF/n-Si solar cell, and the upper right part shows the photoelectrochemical solar cell. The barrier height of the photoelectrochemical solar cell is higher than that of the Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cell. The bottom right part of Fig. 6b shows the equilibrium energy diagram of the hybrid heterojunction and solid-state photoelectrochemical solar cell, whereas the bottom left part of Fig. 6b shows the equilibrium energy diagram of the Schottky junction in this hybrid device. The barrier height between n-Si and the solid electrolytes is equal to that between n-Si and Pt-GWF.
In this configuration, the two solar structures operate together in a parallel circuit, and the Schottky junction and photoelectrochemical effect work synergistically. In the hybrid heterojunction and solid-state photoelectrochemical solar cell, the solid electrolyte plays three roles simultaneously: an anti-reflection layer, a photoelectrochemical channel, and a chemical carrier.15 As shown in Fig. 6c, after spin coating the solid electrolyte onto the Pt-GWF/Si solar cell, the PCE was improved to 10.02%. In comparison, the efficiency of the solar cell that was only coated with solid electrolyte (without Pt NPs deposition) was 7.51%. The result suggests that the deposition of Pt NPs significantly improved the performance of the GWF/n-Si solar cells, and that Pt NPs and HNO3 + PVA synergistically enhanced the PCE of the GWF/n-Si solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a practical and effective method to deposit Pt NPs on GWF to enhance the PCE of Pt-GWF/n-Si solar cells. The deposition of Pt NPs improved the work function of GWF without influencing the transmittance of GWF and also decreased the sheet resistance of GWF. The increased work function of GWF resulted in an enhanced built-in electric field and thus an improved Voc, whereas the enhanced conductivity led to a higher Jsc. After spin-coating solid electrolyte onto the Pt-GWF/Si solar cell, the PCE of the resulting hybrid Schottky junction and photoelectrochemical solar cell was determined to be 10.02%, the highest among all the GWF/n-Si solar cells developed in this study. However, it is worth noting that, compared with other metals, Pt is expensive. It is imperative to find cheaper metal NPs that enhance the efficiency of graphene/Si solar cells in the future.
