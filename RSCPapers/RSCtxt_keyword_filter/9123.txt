    , Accepted 25th September 2019First published on 25th September 2019AbstractA composite of CdS nanoparticles and a europium metal organic framework (Eu-MOF) (CdS/Eu-MOF) was synthesized. The unique properties of MOFs help to improve the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of CdS by reducing charge carrier recombination and utilizing a broader spectrum for light harvesting. Under visible light illumination, the photocurrent of the CdS/Eu-MOF composite modified electrode was about 2.5-fold higher than that of the CdS modified electrode. When an ampicillin (AMP)-binding aptamer was immobilized on the CdS/Eu-MOF modified electrode as a recognition element, a self-powered PEC aptasensor exhibiting a specific photocurrent response to AMP was constructed. Several experimental conditions such as the ratio of CdS to MOF, the coating amount of the CdS/Eu-MOF suspension and the concentration of the aptamer were studied. Under optimum conditions, the photocurrent of the developed sensor was linearly related to the logarithm AMP concentration in the range of 1 × 10−10 to 2 × 10−7 M, with a detection limit (3S/N) of 9.3 × 10−11 M. Moreover, this sensor exhibited excellent selectivity, good repeatability and desirable stability. It was successfully applied to the detection of AMP in lake water and milk samples.
Introduction
Ampicillin (AMP), a β-lactam antibiotic, has been widely used to treat bacterial infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in humans and animals because of its broad spectrum and low cost.1 However, the overuse of AMP in animal husbandry has inevitably caused the antibiotic residue problem in food products, which might damage human health by allergic reactions, breathing difficulties and seizures.2 According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the tolerance or safe level for AMP in milk is 28.6 nM.3 Moreover, the discharge and accumulation of AMP in the environment have led to the worldwide spread of bacterial resistance. Therefore, monitoring of AMP in the environment and food products has recently received considerable interest. Various instrumental methods such as surface enhanced Raman scattering,4 fluorescence,2 high performance liquid chromatography5 and electrochemical sensing6,7 have been developed to determine AMP. Nevertheless, these methods usually have at least one restriction, such as low sensitivity, poor selectivity, time-consuming operation procedure and expensive equipment. Therefore, it is essential to develop a highly sensitive and selective, rapid and low-cost strategy for AMP detection.
In recent years, photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors have been extensively developed for biochemical analysis, medicine assays and environmental monitoring.8–10 Generally, PEC detection is based on the transfer of photogenerated electrons at electrode/electrolyte interfaces and the subsequent change in photocurrent caused by interactions between the analyte and photoactive matrix.11 Compared with conventional electrochemical analysis, PEC detection exhibits lower background but higher sensitivity due to the separation of the excitation source (light) and detection signal (photocurrent).12–14 The performance of the PEC sensor is mainly dependent upon photoactive materials which can generate a responsive signal under photoirradiation. CdS, a narrow bandgap semiconductor (2.4 eV), has been well-known as an outstanding photoactive material responsive to visible light.15,16 However, the rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs and photocorrosion limit the application of CdS.17 Many attempts such as noble metal deposition,18 construction of heterojunctions19 and elemental doping20 have been made to improve the PEC performance of CdS.
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials constructed by using metal ions as nodes and organic bridging ligands as linkers.21 Due to their tunable structures and properties, MOFs have been extensively applied in the fields of gas storage and separation,22 heterogeneous catalysis,23 chemical sensing24,25 and drug delivery.26 Recently, coupling of MOFs with other functional materials has been demonstrated to improve the properties of materials through the synergistic effect.27–29 In particular, the fabrication of a MOF/semiconductor composite has been confirmed as a valid strategy to improve the activity of photocatalysts. For instance, Li et al. synthesized a core–shell structure MOF composite of Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 and proved that the combination of Cu3(BTC)2 and TiO2 was not a simple superposition, but a process of collaboration and cooperation.30 Wang et al. prepared a UiO-66/g-C3N4 composite and demonstrated that the interface of this composite could promote the transmission of optical carriers and significantly enhance their optical properties.31 Cao et al. constructed a highly sensitive and selective PEC sensor for glyphosate detection based on the Cu-BTC/g-C3N4 composite.32 Among various MOFs, Ln-MOFs are known to have light-harvesting properties due to the antenna effect. As a representative of Ln-MOFs, the Eu-MOF has been employed to prepare the CdTe/Eu-MOF composite which exhibited a synergistic light-harvesting effect between the Eu-MOF and CdTe quantum dots (QDs) and 80% improvement in the power conversion efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cell compared to CdTe QDs alone.33 In addition, the superior photocatalytic activity of the CdTe/Eu-MOF has also been confirmed for the degradation of rhodamine 6G.34
In this work, we synthesized a CdS-decorated Eu-MOF (CdS/Eu-MOF) as a photosensitive material to construct a PEC sensor for AMP detection. Compared with pure CdS or Eu-MOF, the CdS/Eu-MOF composite exhibited higher photocurrent because the MOF could assist in improving the PEC properties of semiconductors by minimizing the charge recombination losses and utilizing a broader solar spectrum for light harvesting. As shown in Scheme 1, the PEC sensor was constructed with the CdS/Eu-MOF photoelectrode and the AMP-binding aptamer. Based on the specific recognition ability between the aptamer and AMP, the proposed PEC sensor showed an increased photocurrent response to AMP in the concentration range from 1 × 10−10 to 2 × 10−7 M. Thus, a PEC sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity for AMP detection was successfully developed.

Experimental
Materials and apparatus
Eu(NO3)·6H2O was obtained from Adamas-Beta Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O was purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Ltd (Tianjin, China). Ampicillin (AMP), kanamycin (KAN), streptomycin (SRT), bleomycin (BLM), tetracycline (TC), sodium sulfide (Na2S), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC), and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) were provided by Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). The AMP aptamer was synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) with sequences of 5′-TTT TGC GGG CGG TTG TAT AGC GG-3′. Other reagents of analytical grade were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) and used without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout the experiment.
The morphology of materials was examined by using a Nova Nano SEM 450 instrument (FEI, Netherlands) equipped with an IE250X-Max50 EDS (Oxford, UK) and a Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI, Netherlands). The visible absorption spectra were recorded on a TU-1900 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Instrument Company, China). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Instruments, Darmstadt, Germany). PEC measurements were carried out with a CHI830D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd, China).
Synthesis of the CdS/Eu-MOF
CdS was prepared according to our previous report.14 Firstly, Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.84 g) and mercaptoacetic acid (1.5 mL) were added to distilled water with a volume of 100 mL. Then, 2.0 M NaOH was added to the above solution to adjust the pH to 10. After stirring for 30 min at 150 °C under a N2 atmosphere for removing O2, 100 mL of Na2S (0.2 M) was added dropwise to react for another 4 h. When the product was cooled to room temperature, absolute ethanol was added until precipitation occurred. Finally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with absolute ethanol, and dried at 60 °C.
The Eu-MOF was synthesized using the Eu3+ ion as the metal center and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) as the organic linker.35 Briefly, Eu(NO3)3 aqueous solution (0.5 M, 1 mL) was added dropwise into BTC ethanol–water solution (v/v, 1:1) (0.5 M, 40 mL) under vigorous stirring. After reacting for 60 min at room temperature, a white precipitate was obtained. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with ethanol and water, and dried at 60 °C.
The CdS/Eu-MOF composite was prepared as follows. Firstly, a mixed aqueous solution of the Eu-MOF (5 g L−1) and CdS (30 g L−1) was ultrasonically agitated for 2 hours. Then, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with water, and dried at 60 °C.
Fabrication of the PEC aptasensor
Prior to fabrication, the indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glassy electrode was cleaned with a mixed solution of ethanol and NaOH (2 M) solution (v/v, 1:1) for 20 min followed by washing with distilled water until the electrode is clean. After being dried with high purity nitrogen gas, the ITO electrode surface was dipped into 1% PDDA solution containing 0.5 mol L−1 NaCl with a geometric area of 0.096 cm2 for 0.5 h, followed by thoroughly rinsing with water and drying with nitrogen gas. Then, 9 μL of the CdS/Eu-MOF suspension (3 g L−1) was coated on the ITO electrode surface and dried at 60 °C. The obtained CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO electrode was coated with 8 μL of the aptamer at a desired concentration, and then kept at room temperature for 12 h to ensure the effective immobilization of the aptamer. The aptamer/CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO electrode was thoroughly rinsed with water and dried naturally at room temperature for further use.
PEC detection of AMP
The fabricated aptamer/CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO was incubated with 10 μL of different concentrations of AMP solution at 25 °C for 4 h, followed by thoroughly rinsing with water to eliminate unfixed molecules. Then, it was put into the PEC cell to serve as a work electrode, together with a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. The PEC measurement was performed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) by recording the chronoamperometric curve at an applied potential of 0 V upon the “on–off” photoirradiation cycle. A 10 mW 405 nm portable laser was employed as the light source, and the distance between the light source and working electrode surface was 8 cm.
Results and discussion
Characterization of materials and modified electrodes
The morphologic structures of the as-prepared materials were studied by SEM and TEM. Fig. 1A shows that CdS was a homogeneous granular structure with clear grain boundaries. From TEM analysis, the diameter of CdS nanoparticles was estimated to be about 5 nm (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, the as-prepared Eu-MOF exhibited a nanorod structure with a length of 1.05 ± 0.28 μm and a width of 80 ± 25 nm (Fig. 1B). When CdS and the Eu-MOF formed the composite, the surface of the Eu-MOF became rough and many CdS nanoparticles were decorated on Eu-MOF nanorods (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, from the TEM images in Fig. 1E and F, we found that the dispersion of CdS nanoparticles on the surface of the Eu-MOF effectively reduced the aggregation of CdS nanoparticles and formed a relatively uniform structure.

Meanwhile, the compositions of the CdS/Eu-MOF were confirmed using energy dispersive spectra (EDS). As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the element peaks of Cd, S, Eu, C and O appeared in the as-prepared composite, consistent with the fact that the composite was composed of the Eu-MOF and CdS. The element peak of Pt appeared because platinum was sprayed on the surface of the material before testing to increase the conductivity of the material. In addition, the distribution of Cd, S, Eu, C and O elements in the composite and loading of CdS on the surface of the Eu-MOF were also confirmed by elemental mapping analysis.

The crystalline nature of the as-synthesized materials was revealed by XRD analysis. As depicted in curve a in Fig. 3A, CdS showed three characteristic diffraction peaks at 26.5°, 43.7° and 51.8° which corresponded to the (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes of the cadmium yellow CdS phase (JCPDS no. 41-1049),36 respectively. The sample of the Eu-MOF was also found to be highly crystalline. All diffraction peaks could be well correlated with the known bulk phase of Eu(1,3,5-BTC)·6H2O (curve b in Fig. 3A).37 For the CdS/Eu-MOF composite, the characteristic diffraction peaks of CdS were clearly seen; however, some diffraction peaks of the Eu-MOF between 28° and 50° were not observable due to its weak intensity (curve c in Fig. 3A).

The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared materials were studied by visible absorption spectroscopy. It was seen that CdS showed strong absorption in the wavelength range of 380 to 490 nm but negligible absorption at wavelengths longer than 490 nm (curve a in Fig. 3B). Although the Eu-MOF showed absorption in the entire visible region, its absorbance values were weak (curve b in Fig. 3B). Compared with CdS and the Eu-MOF, the CdS/Eu-MOF composite exhibited stronger absorption in the visible light range from 380 to 780 nm (curve c in Fig. 3B). This result indicates that the introduction of the Eu-MOF is beneficial to broaden the visible light absorption range and enhance the visible light harvesting property of CdS. Furthermore, it was observed that the CdS/Eu-MOF obviously had strong absorption in the wavelength range from 380 to 490 nm. Thus, we selected a 405 nm portable laser as the light source to effectively excite the CdS/Eu-MOF in the following PEC experiments.
The interface properties of various modified electrodes were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plots of EIS spectra and the corresponding equivalent circuit model are shown in Fig. 4. The electron transfer resistance (Ret) value of the modified electrode was evaluated based on the semicircular diameter of the Nyquist plots. The Ret value of the bare ITO electrode was 237.1 Ω (curve a in Fig. 4). While ITO was modified with CdS, the Ret value increased to 661.2 Ω (curve b in Fig. 4), owing to the semiconductor properties of CdS. The Ret value of Eu-MOF/ITO was 255.9 Ω (curve c in Fig. 4), which was slightly higher than that of the ITO electrode. It is likely that the carboxylate ligand of the MOF structure can accelerate the ligand-to-metal charge transfer and site to site electron migration,38 thus endowing the Eu-MOF with good conductivity. Compared with CdS/ITO, the Ret value of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO was reduced (curve d in Fig. 4), indicating that the Eu-MOF can improve the conductivity of CdS. After the AMP aptamer was anchored on the CdS/Eu-MOF electrode, the Ret value was 1124 Ω (curve e in Fig. 4). This result demonstrates the effective immobilization of the aptamer on CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO, which increases the steric resistance of the electrode surface and inhibits the electron transfer on the electrode.

PEC analysis of modified electrodes

Fig. 5A shows the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO with light on–off cycles. It was seen that the CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO electrode responded sensitively to light illumination. Further observation indicated that the photocurrent hardly changed with the potential from −0.2 V to 0.6 V. Recently, self-powered PEC sensors with an applied potential of 0 V have attracted increasing interest, which could eliminate the common necessity of an external power source and permit detection without the application of any voltage bias between the cathode and anode.39,40 Additionally, these self-powered sensors could avoid high background and interference arising from high bias potential employed in ordinary PEC sensors. Therefore, in this work, we selected 0 V as the applied potential to explore a novel self-powered sensing approach to AMP detection.

(D) Plot of response time with potential decay for the corresponding photoelectrodes derived from (C) when light was turned off. 

Fig. 5B compares the photocurrent responses of various modified electrodes recorded in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) at a bias potential of 0 V under visible light illumination. The photocurrent value of CdS/ITO was 0.68 μA (curve a in Fig. 5B). By contrast, the Eu-MOF/ITO generated a negligible photocurrent response (curve b in Fig. 5B), due to the fact that the conjugated structure of the MOF does not favor charge separation.30 When the CdS/Eu-MOF modified electrode was employed, the photocurrent increased up to 1.71 μA, about 2.5 times higher than that of CdS/ITO. This should be ascribed to the synergistic light-harvesting effect of the CdS/Eu-MOF33 and the influence of the unique structure of the MOF.41

Fig. 5C shows the open-circuit dark–light–dark photovoltage responses of CdS and CdS/Eu-MOF modified electrodes. When the light was turned on, the open circuit potential (Vocp) of CdS/ITO changed from −0.091 to −0.74 V (curve a in Fig. 5C) while the Vocp of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO changed from −0.064 to −0.87 V (curve b in Fig. 5C). The rapid change of Vocp confirmed that both electrodes were sensitive to light illumination. Further observation indicated that the Vocp of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO under photoirradiation was more negative than that of CdS/ITO, meaning more effective separation of photogenerated e–h pairs on the former.42
Generally, when the light on the photoelectrode is interrupted at the open circuit, the excessive electrons are removed because of the recombination of e–h pairs. In such a case, the photovoltage decay rate directly related to the electron lifetime (τn) can be described as the following equation:43 τn = [−kBT/e][dVocp/dt]−1(1)where kBT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVocp/dt is the open circuit voltage transient. Fig. 5D depicts the plot of response time with potential decay obtained by applying eqn (1) to the data in Fig. 5C. It was seen that at the same Vocp value, the response time of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO was longer than that of CdS/ITO, showing less recombination of e–h pairs in the CdS/Eu-MOF modified photoanode.44
Fabrication and optimization of the PEC aptasensor
Considering that CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO exhibited an admirable photocurrent response, we employed it as a photoelectrode and the AMP aptamer as a recognition element to construct a self-powered PEC aptasensor for AMP detection. As shown in curve a in Fig. 6A, the CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO displayed a photocurrent of 1.72 μA. After the aptamer was immobilized on CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO, the photocurrent remarkably decreased (curve b in Fig. 6A). This may be ascribed to the presence of the aptamer which enhances the steric hindrance of the electrode interface and obstructs the electron transfer as indicated by EIS analysis (curve e in Fig. 4). While AMP was present, an increase in photocurrent was observed (curve c in Fig. 6A), owing to the oxidation of AMP captured by the aptamer on the photoelectrode. Accordingly, the aptamer/CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO was feasibly employed as a PEC aptasensor to detect AMP.

(C) Influence of the CdS/Eu-MOF amount on the photocurrent response of the modified electrode. (D) Effect of the aptamer concentration on the photocurrent response of the PEC aptasensor. 
Several conditions for the construction of the self-powered PEC aptasensor were studied and optimized. Fig. 6B shows the photocurrents of electrodes modified with different ratios of CdS to MOF. The photocurrent of CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO increased with increasing the ratio of CdS to Eu-MOF from 2:1 to 6:1, because CdS could transfer photogenerated electron holes to the Eu-MOF under light illumination to achieve the synergistic effect. However, the photocurrent decreased when the proportion of CdS in the composite further increased which could be ascribed to the fact that excessive CdS coverage on the surface of the Eu-MOF leads to agglomeration, which affects the synergistic effect of the CdS/Eu-MOF. Accordingly, the ratio of CdS to Eu-MOF was selected as 6:1 to prepare the modified electrode in this work except where otherwise indicated.
On the other hand, the influence of the CdS/Eu-MOF suspension amount on the photocurrent response of the PEC aptasensor was investigated (Fig. 6C). The photocurrent of the modified electrode increased when the volume of the CdS/Eu-MOF suspension increased from 6 to 9 μL. However, as the volume of the CdS/Eu-MOF further increased, the photocurrent decreased significantly. It is likely that an excessively thick film of the CdS/Eu-MOF on the electrode surface reduces light absorption and electron transfer capacity.
Moreover, the influence of aptamer concentration was investigated. Fig. 6D depicts the photocurrent difference (ΔPI) of the sensor before and after incubation with the aptamer at different concentrations. The value of ΔPI increased gradually with the increase of the aptamer concentration from 0.5 to 2 μM. Nevertheless, when the aptamer concentration exceeded 2 μM, the change of ΔPI was not obvious. Therefore, the amount of the CdS/Eu-MOF suspension and the concentration of the aptamer used for sensor fabrication were optimized as 9 μL and 2 μM, respectively.
PEC aptasensing of AMP
Under optimal experimental conditions, the self-powered PEC aptasensor was constructed and explored for the determination of AMP at different concentrations. As shown in Fig. 7A, the photocurrent of the proposed sensor increased linearly with the increase of logarithm AMP concentration from 1 × 10−10 to 2 × 10−7 M. The linear regression equation is expressed as ΔPI/nA = 70.0543lgC/M + 700.4726, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9953. In addition, the detection limit (S/N = 3) was calculated to be 9.3 × 10−11 M, superior to those of many previously reported methods for AMP detection (Table 1).

The selectivity of the fabricated self-powered PEC sensor was studied. For this purpose, the PEC responses of the fabricated sensor to AMP and other antibiotics including KAN, SRT, BLM and TC under the same conditions were recorded. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the photocurrent of the sensor displayed a remarkable increase in the presence of AMP, whereas the addition of other antibiotics did not cause a noticeable change. This result indicates that the sensor has excellent selectivity for AMP detection.

To further assess the performance of the fabricated aptasensor, the reproducibility was investigated by comparing the response of six independently prepared aptamer/CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO toward 100 nM AMP. The relative standard deviation (RSD) value was 2.1%, implying that this sensor has good reproducibility. At the same time, the stability was also evaluated. The fabricated aptamer/CdS/Eu-MOF/ITO electrode was stored at 4 °C. After one week, the PEC response of the sensor toward 100 nM AMP still retained 97.8% of its original response, indicating that the sensor possesses high stability.
Detection of AMP in real samples
To confirm its feasibility, the fabricated sensor was applied for detecting the level of AMP in real samples. Lake water and milk samples were selected as representatives to explore the sensing performance. The water sample was collected from East Lake in Wuhan City, China. Prior to detection, the lake water sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, and then diluted with PBS to pH 7.4 for further analysis. The level of AMP in the water sample was determined by using the standard addition method. As shown in Table 2, the recovery values are between 85.05% and 107.9% and the relative standard deviations (RSD, n = 5) are between 2.97% and 6.99%, indicating that the fabricated sensor can be applied to the detection of AMP in the environmental water sample. The milk sample was purchased from a local supermarket and pretreated according to a previously reported procedure with slight modification.46 Firstly, 1.5 mL of trifluoroacetic acid and 15 mL of 5% phosphoric acid were added to the milk sample. Then, the sample was gently shaken in a shaker to precipitate casein, followed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove coagulation of proteins and fats. Subsequently, the sample was adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH and filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane. Finally, the sample was diluted with PBS (pH 7.4). As shown in Table 2, the recovery values are between 87.05% and 97.61%, demonstrating that the prepared aptasensor for the determination of AMP in milk samples is feasible.

Conclusions
Benefiting from the unique structure of the MOF, a CdS/Eu-MOF nanocomposite with excellent PEC performance was successfully synthesized. Then, the composite modified electrode generated a photocurrent signal at 0 V under visible light illumination and offered the basis for the construction of a self-powered PEC sensor while an AMP-binding aptamer was introduced as the recognition element of the sensor. Under the optimum conditions, the fabricated self-powered PEC aptasensor exhibited a broad linear range and a low detection limit. Meanwhile, the levels of AMP in lake water and milk samples were determined with good accuracy and recovery by using the proposed sensor. This work provides a new insight into the design and application of the MOF composite-based PEC sensor.
