    , Accepted 7th November 2021First published on 8th November 2021AbstractLead iodide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as promising energy-materials. However, to date, several key electronic properties such as optical properties, effective mass, exciton binding energy and radiative exciton lifetime are largely unknown. Here, we employ an integrated approach with several state-of-the-art first-principles based methodologies viz. hybrid density functional theory combined with spin–orbit coupling, many-body perturbation theory, model-BSE (mBSE), Wannier–Mott and density functional perturbation theory to address these properties by taking a prototypical model system viz. APbI3 (A = Formamidinium (FA), methylammonium (MA), and Cs). We demonstrate that while the mBSE approach improves the excitonic features in the optical spectra, the Wannier–Mott approach and ionic contribution to dielectric screening ameliorate the exciton binding energy. Moreover, the direct–indirect bandgap transition (Rashba–Dresselhaus splitting) may be responsible for the reduced charge carrier recombination rate in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. In addition, we examine the electron–phonon coupling constants and polaron parameters that may provide valuable insights into charge-carrier generation and transport. Furthermore, the role of cation “A” in procuring the long-lived exciton lifetime is well understood.
1 Introduction
Lead iodide perovskites (APbI3) have received considerable attention in optoelectronic devices by virtue of their remarkable phenomena, such as ambipolar charge transport,1,2 collection and recombination of charge carriers,3 and multivalley nature of the band structure.4 Rapid developments in the field of perovskite cells have led to a dramatic increase in the power conversion efficiency from 3.8%5 to 25.5%6 in less than 10 years. Amongst the lead iodide perovskites, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are the most studied systems that come under the category of hybrid inorganic–organic perovskites (HIOPs).5,7–9 Long charge carrier lifetimes, high carrier mobility, low trap density, and potentially low manufacturing costs have made them excellent candidates for solar cells.10–12 Likewise HIOPs, inorganic perovskites are also rich in practical applications because of their long carrier diffusion lengths13 and high fluorescence quantum yields.14 For example, CsPbI3 is one of the highly studied systems under inorganic perovskites. Since, these systems have been widely studied in the past, they are the best prototypes for studying new theoretical methodologies that can provide significant scientific insights.
To date, reliable theoretical methods to comprehend the optical, electronic, excitonic and polaronic properties of APbI3 (A = FA, MA and Cs) perovskites have been scarcely reported in the literature.15 Thus, despite the wide study of the properties like transport phenomena, defects, thermodynamic stability, and formation energy of the APbI3 system,1–3,16 the accurate methodology in determining the exciton and polaron parameters is hitherto unknown. Therefore, revisiting the analytical methodologies is crucial in the present scenario for accurate correlation with the experimental studies.
At the theoretical level (here density functional theory (DFT)17,18), it has never been easy to understand these properties as the exchange–correlation (εxc) functional needs to be carefully analyzed in the light of electron's self-interaction error and spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect. Note that, for the case of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, the GGA (PBE) functional provides a bandgap in fortuitous agreement with the experimental results, because of lucky error cancellation, which persuades researchers to use GGA (PBE) functionals for these systems.19–22 However, local/semi-local functionals (viz. LDA or GGA) are not sufficient to determine the correct band edge positions and are incapable of discerning the excitonic peaks.23 In principle, the decent way to calculate the optical properties is to determine the accurate position of the quasiparticle peak in the spectra by evaluating the quasiparticle energies, in particular, the bandgap. It should be noted here that with the development of perovskite solar cells, the mechanism behind the efficiency of perovskites to convert solar energy to power has become a topic of capital interest. In this regard, a relatively large exciton binding energy [30–55 meV] has been reported.24–30 Therefore, the extreme challenge is to compute accurately the exciton binding energy and following that the optical gap. The accuracy of the optical gap and excitonic peak can be further used to circumvent the problem of determination of exciton lifetime of the charge carriers. In addition, electron–phonon coupling also plays a crucial role in the exciton lifetime, hence it is important to investigate the electron–phonon interaction in these APbI3 perovskites using the mesoscopic model viz. Frohlich's model.31,32 Recently, Jana et al. have demonstrated that organic cations (MA and FA) carry a fundamental advantage over inorganic cations (Cs) for achieving the long-lived exciton lifetime.33 Since, the band edges are primarily contributed by Pb and I, we intend to understand how the cations affect the excited state lifetime in APbI3 perovskites.34 Hence, it is interesting to understand the role of cations in determining the exciton lifetime.
In this article, using state-of-the-art first-principles based methodology under the framework of DFT (with PBE17 and hybrid functionals (HSE06)35 combined with SOC), MBPT23, model-BSE (mBSE)15, Wannier–Mott36 and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)37,38 approaches, we present an exhaustive study on the theoretical understanding of the optical, electronic and excitonic properties of APbI3 perovskites. We have carefully analyzed the starting point by tuning the exact exchange parameter α in HSE06 + SOC calculations, in order to have an accurate estimation of the GW bandgap in APbI3 perovskites. Furthermore, by the quantitative description of the optical spectra, we have shown that relativistic BSE calculation with SOC is not sufficient. This is due to the fact that it requires extremely high k-grid sampling, which is indeed computationally a very demanding task. Subsequently, the mBSE approach has been used to sample the Brillouin zone with sufficient accuracy. This approach derives the experimental features of the optical spectra. Furthermore, we have used Wannier–Mott and DFPT approaches to explore the effective mass, electronic and ionic contributions to dielectric screening and the exciton parameters including exciton binding energy, exciton energy, and exciton radius. The role of Rashba–Dresselhaus splitting is also addressed in APbI3 perovskites. Finally, we have performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the radiative lifetime of excitons and the polaron parameters, where the cation A's role is well investigated via IR spectra.
2 Theoretical methods and computational details
We have used several methods systematically (viz. DFT, MBPT, mBSE, DFPT, and Wannier–Mott) to explore the most accurate one for addressing the experimentally obtained bandgap, and the optical and electronic properties of APbI3 perovskites. As a first step, DFT calculations are performed with the PAW pseudopotential method39 as implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40 The PAW pseudopotentials used in our calculations are H (1s1), C (2s2 2p2), N (2s2 2p3), Pb (5d10 6s2 6p2), I (5s2 5p5) and Cs (5s2 5p6 6s1). However, we have also checked the influence of Pb (6s2 6p2) in the bandgap obtained by our calculations (see the discussion in ESI†, Section X). We have observed that at the PBE level, different pseudopotentials yield the same value of bandgap. However, for the GW bandgap, a discrepancy up to 0.15 eV is noted. We have used exchange–correlation functionals (εxc) viz. generalized gradient approximation (GGA with PBE) for optimizing the atomic positions of the structures. We have started with the experimental lattice parameters of the unitcell for the cubic phases of APbI3 perovskites. A conjugate gradient minimization algorithm is used to relax the atomic positions and lattice parameters of the structures with a force convergence of 0.001 eV Å−1. The structures are optimized with Γ centered 4 × 4 × 4 k-mesh sampling. The tolerance criteria for total energy is set to 0.001 meV for the energy calculations. The k-mesh41 is converged at 6 × 6 × 6 for simple PBE optical spectra calculations. The details of the validation of k-mesh for PBE calculations is given in the ESI† (see Fig. S1). To obtain accurate electronic structures and optical properties, we have performed hybrid functional HSE06 calculations.35 In the HSE06 method, the exchange potential is divided into two parts: short range [SR] and long range [LR]. A fraction of non-local Hartree–Fock exchange potential is mixed with the GGA exchange potential of PBE in the short range part. The long range exchange part [LR] and the correlation potential are contributed by the PBE functional. (1)where α is the mixing coefficient and ω is the screening length. We have tuned the α parameter from 25% to 53% and ω is 0.2 Å−1 in hybrid calculations (HSE06) along with SOC, in order to have a reliable prediction of the starting point, for the single shot GW calculations. The dependence of single shot GW on the choice of α is explicitly shown in ESI,† Fig. S10. The energy cutoff (ENCUT) and the number of included bands (NBANDS) for GW calculations are not independent of each other but have to be converged together. Therefore, we have shown the convergence of the quasiparticle bandgap with respect to a set of number of bands (NBANDS), and the plane wave energy cutoff (ENCUT). We have computed a quasiparticle bandgap as a function of NBANDS for fixed values of ENCUT (see ESI†, Fig. S10). For our GW calculations, we have considered 1000 NBANDS and 400 ENCUT. Following this, the difference in the bandgap using 2000 and 1000 NBANDS is around 0.02–0.04 eV. The difference is quite small, therefore we have considered 1000 bands in our calculations. However, for the convergence of ENCUT, we have observed that the difference between the bandgap for ENCUT values of 400 and 500 eV is negligible. Note that we have also checked the same for ENCUT = 600 eV and we do not observe any change in the value.
In order to determine the optical gap and excitonic effects, the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) is solved. Initially, we have used light 4 × 4 × 4 k-point sampling. The convergence criteria for the number of occupied and unoccupied bands in BSE calculations is given in the ESI† (see Fig. S2). To further improve the spectra, the model-BSE (mBSE) approach is used, which takes into account a denser k-point sampling. The model-BSE calculation approximates W0 to a model dielectric function that depends parametrically on the macroscopic dielectric constant obtained in the BSE calculations with light k-points. Following this, we have used the DFPT approach with k-grid 12 × 12 × 12, in order to include the electronic as well as ionic contributions to the dielectric function. We have used single-shot GW in our calculations that incorporate random phase approximation (RPA). The plane wave energy cut-off is set to 600 eV in our calculations. Note that, the SOC effect is duly included in all our calculations.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Determination of accurate quasiparticle peak position: GW bandgap
We have determined the optical response of APbI3 perovskites by computing the imaginary part of the dielectric function (Im (ε)). Initially, we have started with the basic GGA (PBE) functional for the optical spectra of the cubic phase of the MAPbI3 perovskite, without incorporating the SOC effect (see Fig. 1(a)). Subsequently, we have benchmarked the GW calculations with a comparative study of self-consistent GW (scGW) and single-shot GW (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†). We have computed the optical spectra using scGW for MAPbI3, and discern that scGW is four times more expensive as compared to single-shot GW, even for the calculations without SOC for a unit cell. Hence, we have performed all the following computations with single-shot GW.42 It is well known that the single-shot GW calculation is very much dependent on its starting point. A detailed discussion for the suitable choice of the starting point (PBE/HSE06/with and without SOC) is given in the ESI† (see Section IV).
 Fig. 1  Imaginary part of the dielectric function of the cubic phase of MAPbI3 calculated using single-shot GW (without the excitonic effect) and BSE (with the excitonic effect), where several εxc functionals are used as a starting point (i): (a) PBE, (b) PBE+SOC, (c) HSE06 (α = 25%), (d) HSE06+SOC (α = 25%) and (e) HSE06+SOC (α = 50%). 
From the detailed discussion in the ESI† (for Fig. 1), we conclude that HSE06+SOC (α = 50%) is a prominent choice as a starting point for the GW in our calculations. GW@HSE06+SOC with (α = 50%) gives rise to a peak value at 1.67 eV (see Fig. 1(e)) (i.e. in good agreement with the previous reports).43–46 The above analysis highlights the crucial three factors for considering the initial points: (i) inclusion of SOC, (ii) inclusion of more HF exact exchange to reduce electron's self-interaction error (in HSE06 εxc functional), and (iii) the converged value of α.
Note that in earlier studies, people have tuned exact exchange parameter α to obtain a correct bandgap value from hybrid calculations. Surprisingly, controversies47–49 for the bandgap obtained from GW calculations are not fully discussed in detail. In view of this, here we present these benchmark results to establish that by a systematic analysis of the starting point, with single-shot GW, one can predict an accurate fundamental bandgap. This not only helps in improving the GW bandgap, but also in resolving the controversies that pre-exist in the literature.47–49 The corresponding analysis of the BSE result (underestimated peak at 1.29 eV) is discussed in the next section. We have benchmarked two more systems viz. FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 to ensure that the above approach is not just an artifact or responsive only for MAPbI3 perovskites. The tuning of the exact exchange parameter α by 53% in HSE06+SOC followed by GW works very well for FAPbI3 and CsPbI3. The first peak position (bandgap) is obtained at 1.45 eV and 1.73 eV for FAPbI3 and CsPbI3, respectively (see ESI†, Fig. S4 and S5). Notably, the DFT-½ method50 is also one of the popular methods with the same computational cost as standard DFT, and allows determining reasonable bandgaps in agreement with experiments; however, this technique imposes correction only to the valence band (see ESI†, Section XV). In short, the DFT-½ method is good for determining the experimental bandgap but for band edges, the hybrid functional will be the foremost choice. A short discussion about the applicability of the GGA + U method51 is also given in the ESI† (see Fig. S13, Section XVI).
3.2 Exciton binding energy (EB)
Until now, we have delivered fairly accurate electronic bandgaps (GW bandgaps) by tuning the exact exchange parameter (α). However, in order to obtain the correct optical gap and absorption spectra, one needs to look upon the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE). The accuracy related to the BSE peak position has not been yet achieved or benchmarked well. This tends to mislead the BSE exciton peak position, and consequently the exciton binding energy. Using BSE@GW@HSE06+SOC (50%), the obtained BSE peak positions (optical gap) for MAPbI3 (see Fig. 1), FAPbI3 (see Fig. S4, ESI†) and CsPbI3 (see Fig. S5, ESI†) perovskites are 1.29 eV, 1.08 eV and 1.34 eV, respectively. Notably, the exciton binding energy (EB) is defined as the difference between the energy of an unbound non-interacting e–h pair (electronic gap (GW)) and the exciton energy, where the e–h pairs are bound by a screened Coulomb interaction (optical gap (BSE)). Therefore, a discrepancy in the BSE peak position consequently leads to incorrect exciton binding energy EBi.e., 0.38 eV, 0.37 eV and 0.39 eV for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 perovskites, respectively. Note that, low EB (EB < kT = 26 meV at room temperature) values are desirable, so that excitons will dissociate easily to form free charge carriers. In this regard, a low but non vanishing EB value will be congenial for solar cell materials to retain their partial excitonic character without having any energy loss in the formation of free carriers.

3.2.1 model-BSE (mBSE) approach. 
To compute the optical spectra or optical gap, the conventional BSE@GW approach is a reliable and an exemplary approach that mostly provides high quality results for exciton energy and EB. However, the requirement of a large number of processors for high k-grid sampling (approx 10 × 10 × 10), even for a unitcell is not affordable, and thus, results in inconsistency observed in the BSE excitonic peak position or exciton energy. This attributes to the incorrect EB value as shown in the previous section. Therefore, to tackle the BSE convergence, the only way is to sample the Brillouin zone with sufficient accuracy (high k-mesh is required). This motivates us to use a parameterized model for the dielectric screening i.e., the model-BSE approach (mBSE).15 The convergence of the optical spectra as a function of the number of k-points (k-mesh) is performed within this model. This method is generally based on two approximations:
(i) The static screening W is replaced by a simple analytical model, given in eqn (2); as the latter one is easier to compute. Here, the dielectric function is replaced by the local model function: (2)where, ε∞ is the static ion-clamped dielectric function in the high frequency limit. ε∞−1 is calculated from DFPT as shown in Table 1. The screening length parameter, λ, is fitted to the screening (ε−1) from explicit GW calculations at small wave vectors with respect to |q + G| (see Fig. 2(a)–(c)). q and G are defined as the wave vector and lattice vector of the reciprocal cell, respectively. The parameters obtained for the APbI3 perovskites are given in Table 1.

(ii) PBE+SOC single particle eigenvalues are used as an input for the mBSE calculations, instead of GW+SOC quasiparticle energies. This approach requires a scissor operator, which is calculated by taking the difference of the GW bandgap and DFT bandgap, including SOC.52 Notably, the scissor correction to the PBE+SOC eigenvalues is only included for the construction of the BSE kernel. The values of the scissor operator for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are 0.60 eV, 0.71 eV and 0.80 eV, respectively.

Fig. 2(d)–(f) show the optical spectra as predicted by the mBSE approach. Here, we have performed robust k-point sampling up to a 10 × 10 × 10 k-mesh. We can see that the first peak is shifted with an increase in the k-mesh (shown by arrow). It confirms that high k-point sampling is required to converge BSE calculations. The comparison of mBSE and BSE approaches at low k-point sampling (4 × 4 × 4) has been discussed in the ESI† (Fig. S6 and S7). However, with PBE+SOC, the convergence of optical peaks can be achieved with few k-points only (see ESI†, Fig. S1). Undoubtedly, the spectrum features are improved (see the sharp first peak describing the excitonic effect as in Fig. 2(d)–(f)) with an increase in k-mesh, but with an incorrect position of the same. The obvious reason is that we have performed mBSE on the top of PBE+SOC. However, the PBE+SOC is not a suitable choice as a starting point for the mBSE, that we have already confirmed in the aforementioned section. Our motivation in this section is to present a qualitative analysis of how the k-grid affects the spectra, because to perform mBSE calculations on the top of HSE06 (with 50% or 53% α as applicable) incorporating SOC along with a denser k-grid is computationally not only very expensive but also sometimes not feasible. The main approximation of model-BSE is that it does not include the full RPA calculation of the momentum dependent dielectric function. Another approximation is that the off diagonal terms of WGG′ are neglected. Recently Sun et al.53 have shown that the off diagonal terms (local field effects) of the dielectric function are not important for the optical response of the semiconductors; however, they play a crucial role in insulators with strong short-range interactions.
To sum up the aforementioned discussion, from the mBSE spectra, we are successful in inferring the experimental features of the optical spectra and simultaneously observe the reduction in the exciton binding energy with a denser k-grid. With this background and qualitative picture, in the following section our aim is to determine the exciton binding energy and the optical peak position quantitatively using the Wannier–Mott approach.


3.2.2 Wannier–Mott approach. 
3.2.2.1 Effective mass. 
Excitons are bound e–h pairs attracted via electrostatic Coulomb forces. There are mainly two types of excitons: (i) Frenkel excitons (tight bound excitons) and (ii) Wannier–Mott excitons (loosely bound or free excitons). Wannier–Mott excitons are characterized by small bandgaps and a high dielectric constant, generally found in semiconductors.54,55 The Bohr's model is used for Wannier excitons by approximating e–h pairs as a hydrogenic atom. In order to extract the EB, we have herein considered the Wannier–Mott approach along with Fermi's golden rule for APbI3 perovskites.36 As a first step, the effective mass of electrons and holes using the Wannier–Mott model is determined using the E–K dispersion curve. Therefore, we have performed band structure calculations using the GW approximation on top of HSE06+SOC along with α = 50%, 53% and 53% for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3, respectively (see Fig. 3(a)–(c)). The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBm) are obtained at high symmetry R (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) point, and their difference is defined as the bandgap. The obtained bandgaps for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are 1.67 eV, 1.45 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments.43,56,57 In addition, we have observed direct–indirect nature of the bandgap, due to splitting of bands. This is prominent in MAPbI3, moderate in FAPbI3, and completely vanished in CsPbI3 (see ESI†). The splitting of bands due to SOC and a lack of inversion symmetry result in the Rashba splitting of bands58–62 (see ESI†).

Next, we have extracted the effective mass from the band structure, by parabolic fitting of the dispersion curves. We have considered the average value of effective masses from R → X and R → Γ directions (see details in the ESI†). (3)where m*, E(K), K, and ħ are the effective mass, energy, wave vector and reduced Planck's constant, respectively. The values of effective mass and reduced mass (see Table 2) are very well in agreement with previous experimental findings.57,63–65

We have noticed that electron effective masses  are consistently smaller than the hole effective masses , thus, in agreement with previous trends reported in refs. 48, 64, and 66. Following this, the exciton binding energies for screened coulomb interacting e–h pairs in parabolic bands are calculated as: (4)where, μ is the reduced mass, i.e., εeff is the effective dielectric constant and R∞ is the Rydberg constant. Note that the difference in the calculated effective mass with the previous literature reports is very less i.e., ± 0.002 m0. Moreover, as the exciton binding energy is proportional to the reduced mass, it might have variation up to ±2 meV. In the given formula, all the terms are known to us except εeff. Henceforth, our task is to determine εeff.
3.2.2.2 Electronic and ionic contributions to dielectric screening. 
The early reports depended only on the static value of the dielectric constant at a high frequency εe (= ε∞), which is based on the assumption that the dielectric screening occurs only when EB is larger than the optical phonon energy.15,67 However, recently, it has been reported experimentally that optical phonon modes are observed from 8 to 16 meV.68,69 This infers that low frequency optical phonon modes also play an important role in dielectric screening. Therefore, for εeff, a value intermediate between the static ionic dielectric constant at low frequency i.e., εi, and the static electronic dielectric constant at high-frequency εe should be used.
The imaginary and real parts of the dielectric function are shown for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3, respectively. In Fig. 4(a)–(c), we have shown the electronic contribution to the dielectric function. The static real part of the electronic dielectric constant for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 is 6.75, 7.02 and 5.74, respectively (indicated by the point in Fig. 4(a)–(c)). The ionic contribution to real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function is shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f). To obtain the ionic contributions of the dielectric function one needs to compute the force-constant matrices, which is defined as the Hessian (second derivative) of the total energy with respect to the ionic positions and internal strain tensors (strain fields). These parameters may be obtained from finite differences or from perturbation theory. Here, we have used DFPT for our calculations. The static real parts of ionic dielectric constants for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are 30.4, 37.9, and 30.5, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Electronic contribution to the dielectric function for (a) MAPbI3 (b) FAPbI3 and (c) CsPbI3, respectively. Ionic contribution to the dielectric function for (d) MAPbI3 (e) FAPbI3 and (f) CsPbI3. Variation of EB with respect to ε is shown in (g, h and i). The ionic contribution to dielectric screening is calculated using DFPT including SOC. 
On comparing the values, a sizable increase of the static low frequency ionic dielectric constant as compared to the static high frequency electronic dielectric constant is found. The reason for this behavior is the increase in optically active phonon modes below 16 meV as shown within the shaded portion (see Fig. 4(d)–(f)). This shows unequivocally the ionic nature of the perovskites. The electronic and ionic contribution of the dielectric constant will decide the upper and lower bound for the exciton binding energy by using eqn (4). The εeff as a function of exciton binding energy (EB) i.e. εeff(EB) is given by the following equation (see derivation in the ESI†):70,71 (5)
On solving eqn (5), we determine εeff(EB). Im (ε−1(ω)) is the energy loss function, which can be calculated from the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. The intersection point of εeff(EB) (from eqn (5)) and the EB(εeff) (from eqn (4) (shown in Fig. 4(g)–(i))) will give the value of εeff. The intersection point is marked by a circle in Fig. 4(g)–(i) and the values for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3, are 9.5, 10.2 and 7.6, respectively. However, these values have satisfied the upper and lower bounds for static electronic (at high frequency) and ionic dielectric constants (at low frequency), respectively.
After the substitutions of μ and εeff in eqn (4), the obtained EB values (by taking into account the full relativistic approach as well as ionic dielectric screening) for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are 16.13 meV, 13.30 meV and 25.40 meV, respectively. These values are close in agreement with the recent experimental estimates.72–74 However, several large values of EB exist in previous theoretical and experimental studies.15,25,28–30 The obvious reason is the negligence of the optically active phonon modes (below 16 meV) that will contribute to the ionic dielectric screening. We have shown in Table 3, the value of EB corresponding to the electronic and ionic dielectric constants. On the other hand, we have obtained an exciton binding energy of 14.60 meV corresponding to εeff = 1057 for CsPbI3. This is in agreement with that reported in an experimental study.57 The discrepancy observed in the exciton binding energy from 14.60 meV to 25.40 meV is in agreement with recent reports,57,75 therefore it will be more justified to show the variation of the dielectric constant with exciton binding energy (see Fig. 4(g)–(i)). In this figure, we have shown the variation of EB from lower bound (EBl) to upper bound (EBu) of the static dielectric constant.

3.2.2.3 Exciton parameters for APbI3 perovskites: exciton energy, exciton radius and exciton lifetime. 
By knowing the exciton binding energy, we can estimate the highest temperature, at which excitons will remain stable. The thermal energy needed to separate the exciton is EB = kBT, where EB = 16.13 meV for MAPbI3 and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore, excitons will be unstable above T = 187 K. The exciton energy is defined as the difference between the GW bandgap and the exciton binding energy. Eexc = Eg–EB = 1.67–0.016 = 1.65 eV(6)
The exciton radius for the MAPbI3 perovskite with the orbital n is given by,54,55 (7)where, rRy = 0.0529 nm is the Bohr radius. The exciton radius for MAPbI3 comes out to be 4.57 nm. Here, the phonon contribution is taken into consideration, while calculating the εeff term. The εeff is defined to have an intermediate value between the static electronic and ionic (phonon modes) dielectric constant.
In order to find the exciton lifetime, as a first step, we have to calculate the probability of the wavefunction |ϕn(0)|2 for e–h pairs at zero separation.55,76 (8)
Secondly, the transition dipole matrix needs to be determined. The dipole matrix from the k.p model77 is defined as: (9)where,  is the momentum operator. vk and ck are the valence band and conduction band, respectively.  is defined as the Kane energy without SOC. For the perovskite case (see ESI† of ref. 78), Kane energy is defined as .
In terms of reduced mass, eqn (9) can be written as: (10)
Using eqn (10), the value of the transition dipole matrix |〈vk|p|ck〉|2 for MAPbI3 is 5.71 × 10−49 Kg2 m2 s−2.
The above mentioned expressions will help us in determining the exciton lifetime, which is used to judge the efficiency of solar cells or photovoltaic devices. The long lived exciton lifetime infers that recombination is reduced, which leads to a higher quantum yield and conversion efficiency. The exciton lifetime is the reciprocal of the transition rate, which is defined by Fermi's golden rule. The transition rate is given by:79,80 (11)where  is the transition dipole matrix element (|〈vk|p|ck〉|2) per unit cell, and Ω(0) = Eexc is the exciton energy, e is the electronic charge and c is the speed of light.
Finally, the lifetime of excitons is: (12)
Hence, the lifetime of excitons for MAPbI3: (13)
Similarly, we have determined the exciton parameter for FAPbI3 and CsPbI3. Table 4 provides a comparison of the parameters for APbI3 perovskites.

A comparison of the exciton radius calculated from the Wannier–Mott approach and the model-BSE approach is given in ESI, Section XVII

From Table 4, we can conclude that HIOPs (MAPbI3 and FAPbI3) have a longer exciton lifetime than inorganic perovskite CsPbI3. However, on comparing MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, FAPbI3 has a longer exciton lifetime than MAPbI3. Note that, the exciton lifetime is directly dependent on the inverse of the transition dipole matrix value. These calculations also support the experimental observations that a perovskite containing a larger A site cation favors a longer exciton lifetime.81 The ionic radii of the cation in the APbI3 perovskite are in the order FA > MA > Cs, and thus, the exciton lifetimes also follow the same trend τFA > τMA > τCs.
Note that there is also an alternative method to have a qualitative estimation of the excited state lifetime of the excitons using the mBSE approach. We already have an experimentally featured optical spectra of the APbI3 perovskite (obtained using a 10 × 10 × 10 k-mesh) (see Fig. 2(d)–(f)) and also the accurate exciton energy (Eexc) (see Table 4). We shift the optical spectra obtained via the mBSE approach at exciton energy, and further calculate the broadening Γ of the first exciton peak (see Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Qualitative analysis of exciton lifetime using the mBSE exciton peak, where Γ refers to its broadening. Here, only the electron–hole interaction is taken into account. 
Note that, the exciton lifetime is inversely proportional to its broadening.
In order to calculate its broadening, we have taken the rms value of the exciton peak, and the corresponding trend for its broadening is as follows: ΓCs > ΓMA > ΓFA. Therefore, the exciton lifetime follows the opposite trend τFA > τMA > τCs (see Fig. 5).
Notably, the width of the peak depends on the sampling of the Brillouin zone (k-points). We have presented the comparison with different k-meshes viz. 4 × 4 × 4, 6 × 6 × 6 and 8 × 8 × 8 in Fig. S9 in the ESI.† However, the trend for broadening remained the same in every case, i.e. CsPbI3 has a broadened peak in comparison to that of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, irrespective of the k-mesh size. It is well known that the width determines the energy and the inverse lifetime of the excitons. The sharper the peak, the longer the quasi particle lives and vice-versa. Therefore, qualitatively, we can say that CsPbI3 has the lowest exciton lifetime. We have also justified the observed trend for the exciton lifetime using the mBSE approach by calculating the oscillator strength and the excitation energies of the pair using the approach presented in refs. 79 and 80 (see details in ESI†, Section XVIII).
The Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) yields the exciton energies and their corresponding wave functions by solving the two-particle problem for an electron and a hole. The exciton wave functions can be obtained as a sum of all the possible electronic transitions between a valence band and a conduction band, within the Tamm–Damcoff approximation. Note that if the exciton binding energy is large (for e.g. in eVs), or if the exciton consists of a large number of electronic transitions, then the electron–phonon coupling would require special attention. Since, in our case, the exciton binding energy is very small (in meVs), the electron–phonon coupling would mainly broaden the absorption peak of transitions due to the finite lifetime of the electronic states.82 In view of this, we have examined the polaron parameters including electron–phonon coupling constants in APbI3 perovskites.
3.2.2.4 Polaron parameters for APbI3 perovskites. 
To compute the polaron parameters, first we have determined the frequencies of the optical phonons, and subsequently calculated via appropriate models, electron–phonon coupling constants, static dielectric constants, polaron masses, radii and polaron mobilities. These findings provide valuable insights into the basic understanding of charge transport processes and mechanical properties in metal halide perovskites.
We have used an efficient “Frohlich's mesoscopic model” to investigate the electron–phonon interaction in our system.31
In 1954, Frohlich introduced an interaction parameter that described theoretically the motion of an electron in the vicinity of polar lattice vibration. This parameter is a dimensionless quantity known as the Frohlich coupling constant.31,32 (14)where coupling constant α quantifies the strength of the electron–phonon coupling. m*, me, h and c are the effective mass of the electron, rest mass of the electron, Planck's constant, and speed of light, respectively. ωLO (in [cm−1] units) is the optical phonon frequency, 1/ε* is the ionic screening parameter (1/ε* = 1/ε∞–1/εstatic were, εstatic and ε∞ are static and high frequency dielectric constants) and Ry is the Rydberg energy. We obtain the following order for the electron–phonon coupling constant CsPbI3 > MAPbI3 > FAPbI3 in agreement with the qualitative analysis done on the basis of change in the bond length, specific free volume, and atomic fluctuations (see ESI†, Section XIV).
Furthermore, Feynman extended the Frohlich's polaron theory so that the effective mass of the polaron32 (mP) can be calculated using the given equation. (15)where m* is the effective mass computed from the GW band structure calculations. This expression shows that the polaron mass is always higher than the effective mass calculated from band structure calculations, thereby influencing charge carrier mobilities.
Furthermore, we have determined the polaron radii83 using the following equation: (16)
Note that these polaron parameters are used to estimate an upper limit for charge carrier mobilities μ, assuming that only optical phonons are involved.
The Hellwarth polaron model84 is used to define the polaron mobility: (17)where β = hcωLO/kBT, m* is the effective mass of the charge carrier, and w and v correspond to temperature dependent variational parameters. K is a function of v, w, and β84i.e., defined as follows: (18)
Here, a2 and b are calculated as: (19) (20)
From the following expressions, we have obtained that FAPbI3 has a larger carrier polaron mobility than MAPbI3 and CsPbI3. However, the comparison of mobilities with the literature values is quite cumbersome due to the wide range of published values reported in the literature (2.5–165 cm2 V−1 s−1).85 Note that our calculated values for the polaron mobility are typically the upper limit of the reported values that can be expected in the complete absence of local distortions due to polarons and defect scattering of acoustic phonons. The lower value of polaron mobility for CsPbI3 is mainly a result of the higher effective mass that is directly related to the higher ionicity of the CsPbI3i.e. 0.141 (see Table 5).

3.3 Role of cations via infra-red spectra (IR)
To understand the role of cations in the obtained exciton lifetime, we have further computed their Infra-red (IR) spectra. IR spectra are used to determine the vibrational modes corresponding to the motion of atoms or molecules. The IR spectra of APbI3 perovskites show vibrational modes, particularly in three energetic regions of phonons: low frequency, mid frequency and high frequency bands. To briefly explain the reason behind the observed sequence for the exciton lifetime, we are interested here only in the low frequency band (0–200 cm−1) and the high frequency band (2900–3500 cm−1) (see Fig. 6). The large difference in the atomic mass between the inorganic cage atoms (Pb and I) and the covalently bonded organic atoms (H, C, and N), has anticipated that the low frequency modes are entirely comprised of PbI6 octahedra. However, the high frequency mode involves the A cation (mainly organic cations, because of the presence of light atoms H, C, and N).
 Fig. 6  Infra-red spectra of MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3, respectively. 
The reason for the observed trend in exciton lifetimes of the perovskites is carefully analyzed by comparing the individual role of the electron–phonon coupling and the size of cations. Note that cations do not have any contribution to the band edges (see ESI†, Fig. S8); however, indirectly they do affect the inorganic cage Pb–I via electrostatic interactions. The IR spectra of the lattice are associated with direct coupling of the photons to phonons. The excited photons have a tendency to induce dipole and the square of the dipole is proportional to the IR intensity. The size of the cation, electron–phonon coupling and the IR intensity are strongly correlated. Note that electron–phonon coupling depends on the free volume (unoccupied space).86 A large free volume (because of the small size of the cation) provides more space for atomic motions, and as a result electron–phonon coupling will be enhanced. Also, the small size of the cation will not suppress the vibrational modes of the PbI cage. Consequently, this results in high intensity in the low frequency mode. Hence, the intensity of IR spectra in low frequency modes is given as follows: CsPbI3 > MAPbI3 > FAPbI3. The same trend is further followed by the electron–phonon coupling. On the other hand, the size of the cation is in the order FA > MA > Cs, which suppresses the vibrations of the inorganic Pb–I cage based on the same trend.
From Fig. 6, we compare the low frequency bands, which comprise mainly of Pb–I cages. We have observed a strong intensity for CsPbI3, because it has stronger electron–phonon coupling, due to more space for atomic fluctuations. Notably, the strong intensity observed for CsPbI3 (frequency range 0–500 cm−1) is not just because of the Pb–I cage, but it also involves the vibrational mode of the Cs cation, due to its heavy size. However, the low intensity peak of MAPbI3, that signifies weak electron–phonon coupling, is due to the moderate space for atomic fluctuations. The intensity is the lowest in the case of FAPbI3 as the large size of the FA cation has suppressed the Pb–I modes significantly. The electron–phonon coupling leads to a very slow, moderate and very fast recombination process in perovskites containing FA, MA, and Cs. As a result, the exciton lifetime will be enhanced in the order FAPbI3 > MAPbI3 > CsPbI3.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have presented an exhaustive study for the accurate determination of the quasiparticle bandgap or the optical peak of APbI3 perovskites. All the calculations are well validated to avoid artefacts of numerical simulations. The experimental bandgap is reproduced by using the tuned α of hybrid DFT calculations with the SOC, as an initial step for GW and BSE calculations. This methodology resolves the inconsistency observed in the bandgap from previously reported GW calculations. Furthermore, the model-BSE (mBSE) approach is used for qualitative description, to improve the features of optical spectra, where the Brillouin zone is sampled with sufficiently high accuracy. The Wannier–Mott approach and ionic dielectric screening have been used to anticipate accurately the exciton binding energy. Our results show that the ionic contribution to dielectric screening is extremely important, because of the presence of optically active phonon modes below 16 meV. We have observed significant Rashba splitting for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, which tends to reduce the recombination rate (due to indirect gaps) along with the strong absorption of light (due to the direct gap). The exciton lifetime as determined using the Wannier–Mott approach (k.p perturbation theory) is in agreement with the trend observed in the broadening of the exciton peak via the mBSE approach. The Frohlich coupling constant (α) and polaron parameters for MAPbI3, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 support our qualitative discussion of coupling strength calculated using changes in the bond length, specific free volume, and atomic fluctuations. The role of cation “A” for achieving the long-lived exciton lifetime is well investigated via IR spectra. The detailed analysis and the theoretical framework presented in this work will serve as a reliable technique for future studies of the electronic, optical and excitonic properties of alloyed or defected systems.
