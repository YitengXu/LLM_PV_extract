    , Accepted 4th March 2014First published on 4th March 2014AbstractTo minimize the charge recombination between electrons and the electron acceptor in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, we propose a separated electron donor and acceptor of a redox couple in the photoanode and in the cathode, respectively. Owing to the absence of the acceptor in the photoanode initially, the charge recombination rate is retarded remarkably, resulting in an increase of the short-circuit photocurrent by >2-fold, open-circuit photovoltage by 71 mV and power conversion efficiency by >2.5-fold.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attracting considerable attention due to their potential low cost and high performance.1 A typical DSSC comprises a dye-sensitized TiO2 film as the photoanode, a platinized conductive glass as the cathode and a redox couple based electrolyte sandwiched between the two electrodes. The electron donor (e.g. I−) in the electrolyte fulfils dye regeneration upon electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 while the electron acceptor (e.g. I3−) in the electrolyte accepts electrons at the cathode to complete the circuit.2 However, the presence of I3− in the photoanode layer leads to charge recombination between electrons and I3−, resulting in a drop of photovoltaic performance.
In fact, the photoanode layer only needs the electron donor for fast dye regeneration, while the electron acceptor should locate at the surface of the counter electrode for efficient electron relay to the internal of the device. If the electron acceptor is moved from the photoanode layer to the surface of the counter electrode, the charge recombination between electrons and I3− can be minimized due to the absence of triiodide in the photoanode initially and meanwhile fast electron transfer from the cathode to the internal of the device can also be maintained. Unfortunately, the separation of the donor and the acceptor cannot be realized with the liquid electrolyte,3 but it can be realized with the solid-state electrolytes for solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs).4–8
Herein, we prepared double-ester-substituted imidazolium iodide (DEII, Fig. 1) to act as the electron donor. The donor was deposited in the dye-loaded TiO2 layer for efficient dye regeneration preceded by electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, while the acceptor (mixture of DEII and iodine at a molar ratio of 6:1, or I−/I3− = 5:1, the same below) was deposited on the cathode surface for efficient electron relay from the cathode to the inside of the cell for circuit completion. The cathode was placed on top of the photoanode to form a close contact between the donor and acceptor, which was then sealed into a solid device. As compared to the redox mixture electrolyte based device A (Scheme 1), separating the electron donor and acceptor of a redox couple in device B (Scheme 1) could significantly retard charge recombination because of the absence of I3− in the photoanode initially. As a consequence, the photovoltaic performance was improved remarkably.

A redox-couple mixture is used as the solid-state electrolyte in device A while the electron donor and acceptor of the redox-couple are separated in device B: the donor is in the photoanode layer but the acceptor (the mixture of donor and acceptor) is on top of the photoanode in contact with the cathode. 
Results and discussion
The synthetic procedures of DEII are described in the Experimental section. The chemical structure of DEII was corroborated with 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS (Fig. S1, ESI†). The decomposition temperature (Fig. S2, ESI†) is 140 °C and the melting point (Fig. S3, ESI†) is 128 °C for DEII.
To highlight the advantage of a separated donor and acceptor in the ssDSSC and exactly compare the solar cell performance arising from the photoanode part, the top acceptor layer above the photoanode in device B is the DEII–I2 mixture, which is the same as in device A. Fig. 2a displays the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength for the solid-state devices with a 16 μm TiO2 film9 and a metal-free organic dye sensitizer10 (Fig. S4, ESI†). In the visible spectral range, the IPCE value increases remarkably from device A to device B. This forebodes that device B can produce a much higher photocurrent than device A. Fig. 2b shows the J–V curves for device A and B under AM1.5G full-sun irradiation. Device A produces a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 7.02 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 562 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.41%, while device B produces Jsc of 16.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 633 mV and FF of 0.63, corresponding to PCE of 6.50%. The Jsc increases by more than 2-fold from device A to device B, which is consistent with the IPCE result. In addition, the Voc is improved by 71 mV from device A to device B. To compare the back-reaction with triiodide, J–V curves were measured under dark conditions and are shown in Fig. 2b. The onset potential of dark current shifted to a higher value from device A to B, in good agreement with the variation of Voc. As a result, the PCE is enhanced by more than 2.5-fold when the acceptor is removed from the photoanode layer but remained in the top layer. These data clearly support that separating the electron donor and acceptor can improve the photovoltaic performance remarkably.

4-Tertbutylpyridine (TBP) is a typical additive in the electrolyte which suppresses charge recombination. For comparison, we fabricated two reference devices with DEII/I2/TBP (5:1/4) or DEII/I2/LiI/TBP (5/1/0.5/4) as the electrolyte, respectively. The device with DEII/I2/TBP produced Jsc of 11.01 mA cm−2, Voc of 743 mV and FF of 0.71, corresponding to PCE of 5.81%, and the device with DEII/I2/LiI/TBP produced Jsc of 11.69 mA cm−2, Voc of 752 mV and FF of 0.68, corresponding to PCE of 5.98%. As compared to device B with a separated donor and acceptor, the device with TBP yielded lower PCE despite the higher Voc due to the much decreased photocurrent. This clearly indicates that our approach is better than simply adding TBP in terms of power conversion efficiency, although the electrolytes with TBP are not all-solid-state.
The ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is an important factor in determining the photovoltaic performance of ssDSSCs. Fig. 3 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of dummy cells sandwiched with solid DEII or the DEII–I2 mixture. The left semicircle is attributed to the reduction of triiodide to iodide at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The radius of this semicircle on the real axis represents the resistance of charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct). As much more triiodide exists in the DEII–I2 mixture than in DEII, the former exhibits a smaller Rct than the latter. It should be noted that a very small amount of I3− (molar ratio of I3−/I− = 4.9 × 10−4) is contained in the solid DEII due to contamination (Fig. S5, ESI†). The right semicircle is attributed to the diffusion in the solid electrolyte between electrodes. The diameter of this semicircle on the real axis is used to estimate the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. DEII and the DEII–I2 mixture exhibit ionic conductivities of 1.5 and 7.0 mS cm−1 at RT, respectively. The conversion of iodide to triiodide results in a significant reduction of the distance between adjacent iodides, which makes Grotthus charge exchange11 along the iodide chain more efficient and accounts for the higher ionic conductivity of the DEII–I2 mixture.

Ionic movements of iodide and triiodide via Grotthus charge exchange for both DEII and the DEII–I2 mixture are characterized by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) on dummy cells sandwiched with solid DEII or the DEII–I2 mixture.12 The LSV curves of DEII and the DEII–I2 mixture show a plateau of limiting current at a slow scan rate (10 mV s−1), as shown in Fig. 4, which is controlled by the ionic movement via Grotthus charge exchange. As the limiting current density is proportional to the concentration of triiodide due to the large excess of iodide, the DEII–I2 mixture produces a much higher limiting current density than DEII.7

The electron transfer in device B is similar to that in device A that contains a typical redox couple based electrolyte in one phase. Upon electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, the electron donor (I−) in DEII is oxidized by the dye cation and changes to the electron acceptor (I3−), which moves quickly via Grotthus charge exchange to the donor/acceptor interface, due to the high ionic conductivity and limiting current of DEII, and then to the counter electrode through the top acceptor layer. The electron acceptor (I3−) deposited on the surface of the cathode accepts electrons and changes to the donor (I−), which moves quickly via Grotthus charge exchange to the donor/acceptor interface and then to the photoanode layer. A close contact between donor and acceptor layers ensures fast interfacial charge transfer.
As the top electrolyte part is the same for both devices while the bottom electrolyte part in the photoanode layer for device A has a higher ionic conductivity or limiting current density than that for device B; device A should exhibit better photovoltaic performance without taking other factors into account. However, device B produces higher Jsc, Voc and PCE than device A. This indicates that there is another factor influencing the solar cell performance significantly.
The Voc depends on the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2 and free electron density in the CB.13Fig. 5 shows the plot of charge density (Q) at open circuit against open-circuit photovoltage under LED light with various intensities. For both device A and device B, the Voc increases with the logarithm of charge density, and the slope is almost the same (170 mV). As compared to device A with the mixture electrolyte, the separation of the donor and acceptor shifts the CB edge positively by 280 mV, as seen in Fig. 5.13 As compared to device A, the positive shift of CB for device B is beneficial for a higher electron injection yield and hence photocurrent generation. The observed higher Jsc for device B can be explained by the relative lower CB. The concentration gradient of I3− from the photoanode to the counter electrode is also advantageous to improve the photovoltaic performance as reported by Hayase et al.14 However, the positive shift of CB should lead to a decrease in Voc, contrasting to the observed higher Voc. This suggests that separation of the donor and acceptor in device B should suppress charge recombination.
 Fig. 5  Relationship between Voc and charge density. 
As I3− is initially absent in the photoanode layer of device B while a large amount of I3− is present in the photoanode layer of device A, the two devices should have different charge recombination rates between electrons and I3−. To verify this point, the electron lifetime was measured using intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) under LED green light (532 nm) with various intensities. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between electron lifetime and charge density obtained from charge extraction. The electron lifetime is enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude from device A to device B at the same charge density. This indicates that charge recombination between electrons and triiodide is retarded remarkably when the device structure is changed from A to B. As compared to device A, the higher electron lifetime in device B is attributed to the absence of triiodide in the photoanode layer initially as the electron lifetime is expected to increase with decreasing acceptor concentration.15 The remarkable increase in the electron lifetime brings about more electrons stored in TiO2, resulting in a significant improvement of Voc from device A to B.16 The charge densities, which depend on the photo-injected electron density and the electron lifetime at open-circuit, are measured to be 10 and 85 μC cm−2 under 45 W cm−2 LED light (532 nm) for device A and device B, respectively. It is derived from Fig. 5 that Voc gain solely arising from the increased charge density is about 360 mV. Therefore, the collective effects of the positively shifted CB edge (280 mV) and the increased charge density contribute to an increase in Voc by 80 mV, which is in agreement with the observed increase in Voc under the same LED light.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the separation of the redox couple in the ssDSSC device and its advantage over the mixed redox-couple electrolyte for the first time. Contrasting to the redox-couple based solid electrolyte, moving the electron acceptor from the photoanode to the cathode can inhibit charge recombination remarkably due to the absence of triiodide in the photoanode layer initially and meanwhile shift the CB edge positively. As a consequence, Jsc, Voc and PCE are improved remarkably upon separation of the donor and acceptor of the redox couple. With the new device structure, the photovoltaic performance can be further optimized by increasing the ionic conductivity of the electron donor through molecular design.17 This new device structure opens up a new way for optimization of the solar cell performance.

Solar cell fabrication and solar cell performance measurements
TiO2 films (15 μm) composed of a 10 μm nanoparticle (20 nm) layer in direct contact with the FTO substrate and a 5 μm light scattering particle (80% 20 nm TiO2 + 20% 100 nm TiO2) layer were sintered at 525 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of neighboring TiO2 particles under an airflow. The film thickness was measured using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Sintered films were then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then rinsed with deionized water. The TiCl4-treated TiO2 films were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 120 °C before immersing into the dye (Fig. S4, ESI†) solution (0.3 mM in toluene) for 16 h at room temperature for complete dye adsorption. For device A, the dye-loaded TiO2 film as the working electrode and the Pt-coated FTO as the counter electrode were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. The methanol solution of the mixture electrolyte was injected into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode and dried on a hot plate at 50 °C until the TiO2 porous film was filled with the solid-state electrolyte. For device B, the methanol solution of DEII was dropped onto the dye-loaded TiO2 film and dried on a hot plate at 50 °C until the TiO2 porous film was filled with DEII. The methanol solution of the DEII–I2 mixture (molar ratio 5:1) was drop-casted onto the surface of the counter electrode and dried on a hot plate at 50 °C. The counter electrode deposited with the DEII–I2 mixture was placed on top of the working electrode filled with DEII and assembled together. The two cells were further dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 2 days to completely remove the residual methanol before sealing. The working performance of DSSC was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter (Oriel) under illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light coming from an AAA solar simulator (Newport-94043A) equipped with a Xe lamp (450 W) and an AM1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150) equipped with a KG-5 filter. Action spectra of incident mono-chromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength were recorded on an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments). The intensity of incident monochromatic light was measured using a Si detector (Oriel-71640). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was used during measurement to avoid stray light completely.
Characterization
The chemical structure was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Varian 400 MHz NMR spectrometer) and HRMS (HP-5988A). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a TG-DTA 2000S system (Mac Sciences Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC 822e thermal analysis system (Mettler Toledo Instruments Inc., Switzerland) with nitrogen gas as purge (80 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) in transmission mode. Solid-state electrolytes were sandwiched in dummy cells between two identical Pt electrodes, which were used for measurements of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 105 Hz and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany). The electron lifetimes were measured by controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and charge densities at open circuit were measured using a charge extraction technique. IMVS and charge extraction analysis were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT), which includes a green light-emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and the corresponding control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 0.5 to 45 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
