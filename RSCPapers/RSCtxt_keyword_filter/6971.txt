    , Accepted 7th July 2019First published on 8th July 2019AbstractIn this work, we investigated the light-soaking effect in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) employing ZnO as an electron extraction layer (EEL) and demonstrated highly efficient light-soaking-free PSCs with a LiF modified ZnO (ZnO:LiF) EEL. A blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was applied as the active layer. The PSCs fabricated with the LiF doped ZnO EEL showed a 21.2% increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.35% to 4.06% as compared with the pristine ZnO-based devices. In contrast to the devices with a lithium chloride (LiCl) or lithium bromide (LiBr) modified ZnO EEL, the ZnO:LiF-based PSC devices show excellent light-soaking-free characteristics with high fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (Jsc). More importantly, the photovoltaic devices employing a poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend system as the active layer have been also fabricated, which achieved a high PCE of 8.85%. Our results indicate that the inclusion of additional LiF made for reduced oxygen vacancy defects at the metal-oxide/organic interface, which were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and charge extraction analysis. It is shown that LiF modified ZnO as an efficient and cost-effective EEL material has the potential to open a new avenue for high performance optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies due to the advantages of flexibility, light weight and large-area solution process fabrication capability.1–4 Substantial progress in the field of PSCs has led to device efficiencies close to 16% and serious commercialization of this technology has come within reach.5,6 Aside from the efforts in synthesis of low-bandgap photoactive materials and design of light harvesting structures, interface engineering also plays a critical role in further determining the device efficiency and stability.7–10 Regular PSC devices usually employ transparent indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the anode and hole extraction layer (HEL).11,12 However, the acidic PEDOT:PSS HEL is corrosive to ITO and may decompose under long-term ultraviolet (UV) exposure.13–15 Moreover, the top low work function metal cathode is sensitive to oxygen and humidity in the surrounding atmosphere, resulting in fast degradation of the device performance.16,17 Therefore, PSCs with regular configuration are not ideal candidates for robust long-term solar energy harvesting.
Inverted PSCs, which can avoid the incorporation of unstable interlayers, are more attractive due to their long-term stability.18,19 In this structure, n-type metal oxide materials, such as ZnO, SnOx and TiO2, are commonly used as electron extraction layers (EELs).20,21 Among all the EEL materials, ZnO is more attractive due to its high electron mobility, high optical transmittance and environmentally friendly nature. It is easy to synthesize and can be processed by a cost-effective solution fabrication process, which is more compatible with printing and roll-to-roll manufacturing.22,23 However, ZnO EELs prepared by the sol–gel process often suffer severely from unavoidable oxygen vacancy and dangling bond defects, generating a high density of recombination centers and limiting device performance.24–26 In addition, the poor compatibility between the organic materials and the metal oxide buffer layer would also result in a poor interfacial contact at the ZnO/active layer interface, leading to increased charge recombination and accelerated polymer degradation.27 Thus, many efforts have been made to minimize the defects of ZnO EELs and facilitate efficient electron extraction by modifying the ZnO/active layer interface. Zhang et al. developed the bilayer EEL with carbon quantum dot modified ZnO and suppressed the exciton quenching by passivating the ZnO surface defects.28 In our previous work, we demonstrated the enhanced device performance by surface defect passivation of solution-processed ZnO layers using an atomic layer deposited ultrathin Al2O3 layer.29
Another serious issue in ZnO-based inverted PSCs is the pronounced S-shaped kink in the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The device performance gradually increases and reaches a saturated state upon continuous UV or solar illumination, known as the so called “light-soaking” issue.30,31 The light-soaking effect poses a major problem especially when devices experience variation in environmental illumination.32 Such an effect directly leads to a fluctuation in the output power and requires an additional stabilizing system which is unfavorable for commercial applications. One effective and simple solution is to chemically dope ZnO with salts such as Cs2CO3 and SnCl2.33,34 It has been reported that the use of salt doped EELs can improve device performance by modifying the energy level matching and enhancing the charge extraction properties.35
In this paper, we demonstrate that the light soaking issue can be overcome by the use of lithium fluoride (LiF) doped ZnO (ZnO:LiF) as an EEL. In contrast to devices based on pristine ZnO or lithium chloride (LiCl)/lithium bromide (LiBr) doped ZnO, the ZnO:LiF-based device shows well-behaved light-soaking-free characteristics with high short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). The incorporation of LiF shows advantages of reducing oxygen vacancy defects and increasing the charge collection probability of the ZnO layer. The best performing devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer with ZnO:LiF EEL yield a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.06% and 8.85%, which represents a 21.2% and 12.6% increase, respectively, in the efficiency compared to a control cell made with pristine ZnO.
Experimental section
Materials
Patterned ITO substrates (15 Ω per sheet, 150 nm) were ordered from CSG Holding Co. Ltd (China). P3HT and PC61BM were purchased from Lumtec Luminescence Technology Corp. Molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoOx) and 1,2-dicholobenzene (ODCB) solvent were received from Sigma Aldrich. The blended solution of P3HT:PC61BM was prepared as follows: 20 mg P3HT and 20 mg PC61BM were mixed and dissolved in 1 mL ODCB, then the blended solution was stirred for 24 h and filtered through a 0.2 mm filter before use. For the ZnO layer, ZnO powder (99.9%, particle size <5 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ammonia (25%, Tianjin Chemical Reagent) to form 0.1 M Zn(NH3)42+ solution. Then, lithium fluoride (LiF), lithium chloride (LiCl) and lithium bromide (LiBr) (Sigma Aldrich) with 10% molar ratio was added to the ZnO precursor solution and refrigerated for several hours to promote the powder dissolution. All reagents and solvents involved in the experiment were utilized without further purification.
Characterization
All the films were prepared under the same conditions to enable accurate comparisons. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanonavi SPA-400 SPM) images were collected using a tapping mode. The J–V characteristics were measured using a programmable source meter (Keithley 2400) under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator with an AM 1.5G simulated solar spectrum. The J–V curve of the device is measured every 30 seconds. The device was persistently placed under the solar simulator and connected to the electrode when the test was in progress. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured under standard measurement conditions with a 7-SCSpec solar cell measurement system manufactured by 7-STAR Co. All the measurements were performed in air under ambient conditions without device encapsulation. The transmission properties were characterized with UV visible spectra (U-3900H, HITACHI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were implemented using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Amicus Budget).
Device fabrication
Inverted PSCs were fabricated with device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al (Device A); ITO/ZnO:LiF/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al (Device B); ITO/ZnO:LiCl/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al (Device C); ITO/ZnO:LiBr/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al (Device D). The ITO glass substrates were rinsed in an ultrasonic bath with de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol consecutively, and then treated by UV ozone for 30 min. After UV treatment, the clean substrates were spin-coated with prepared ZnO precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 60 s and subsequently heated in ambient air for 20 min at 200 °C. After that, the active layer P3HT:PC61BM with a thickness of ∼200 nm was prepared in a glovebox by spin-coating onto the ZnO films at 700 rpm for 28 s. The wet films were slowly dried in covered glass Petri dishes for 1 h and then thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. Finally, the films were transferred to a high-vacuum chamber (1 × 10−6 Pa), where the MoOx (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) cathodes were thermally evaporated in sequence. The deposition rates of MoOx and Al were 0.3 and 5.0 Å s−1, respectively. The device active area was 0.04 cm2 defined by the overlap of anode and cathode. For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, the active layers were deposited on the ZnO and modified ZnO surface using a blended solution containing PTB7-Th:PC71BM (10 mg mL−1:15 mg mL−1) dissolved in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3, v/v) at 1000 rpm for 90 s in a glovebox. To obtain the average data related to device performance, 10 individual devices for each set of conditions were fabricated and tested. Electron-only cells were also fabricated to investigate the carrier transport properties. The structures of electron-only cells were as follows: ITO (180 nm)/EEL/Bphen (80 nm)/Liq (1 nm)/Al (100 nm).
Results and discussion
Alkali metal halide materials including LiF, LiCl and LiBr are utilized to modify the ZnO EEL, achieved by spin coating the mixed precursor solution. Both the pristine ZnO and modified ZnO EELs were used in inverted PSCs with the same device structure of ITO/EEL/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al. Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic of the inverted PSC and the chemical structures of the photoactive layer materials (P3HT and PC61BM). The thicknesses of all EEL layers were controlled at 40 ± 5 nm with same concentration and preparation process.

Fig. 1(b) shows the J–V characteristics of inverted solar cells with different EELs at a saturated state. The reference solar cell fabricated with a pristine ZnO EEL yielded a PCE of 3.35% with Jsc of 9.03 mA cm−2 and FF of 59.7%. Devices with alkali metal halide doped ZnO layers yielded largely enhanced PCE, though as-cast pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr based devices demonstrated pronounced S-shaped J–V curves (as discussed in a subsequent section). A summary of the performance of PSCs made with different EELs is listed in Table 1. It is shown that for the device with ZnO:LiF, a significantly improved PCE of 4.06% is achieved, with a higher Jsc of 10.38 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 61.8%. The EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 1(c), are measured to evaluate the device photo-response. Devices with modified ZnO EELs showed enhanced EQE profiles compared to the device with pristine ZnO, explaining improved Jsc values. Moreover, the enhanced EQE over a broadband wavelength range of 350–600 nm with the highest EQE of 65.97% at 550 nm was obtained in PSCs with the ZnO:LiF EEL, indicating the superior property of the solution-processable ZnO:LiF EEL for application in inverted PSCs.

A systematic study of transparency and morphology characteristics of different EELs was carried out to unravel the origin of the performance improvement. The EEL transmittance is highly important in inverted PSCs since the incident light must pass through the EEL film first and then be absorbed by the active layer. Fig. 2(a) shows the transmittance spectra of pristine and modified ZnO thin films on glass substrates. It is found that the transmittance spectra showed no significant difference between these four films which all exhibited high transparency with transmittance around 92% in the visible range. This indicates that the alkali metal halide modified ZnO films, similar to the pristine ZnO film, are suitable to serve as EELs in inverted PSCs. The absorption spectra of the four films were also measured and the result is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The surface morphology of different EELs coated on the glass/ITO substrates were investigated by AFM measurements and are displayed in Fig. 2(b). The values of root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness are 0.77 nm for the pristine ZnO thin film, and those of ZnO:LiF, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs are 0.39 nm, 0.54 nm and 0.43 nm, respectively. This implies that the use of alkali metal halides assists in forming a more uniform and denser EEL, which is favorable for efficient electron extraction.36

Contact angle (CA) measurements were further conducted to investigate the performance difference of various EEL-based devices, as is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The CA of the pristine ZnO film on the glass substrate was 30.8°, which was found to be largely decreased to 7.9° for the ZnO:LiF EEL. Such a hydrophilic improvement indicated that the modification of ZnO with LiF could be of benefit for a smoother active layer with fewer interfacial traps.37 The water CA began to increase gradually up to 37.6° and 43.3° for ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs. This evolution of hydrophilic properties is well in accordance with the RMS results of AFM data.
The surface electronic properties of different EELs coated on the ITO substrates were investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. The corresponding UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3(a). The schematic diagram showing the energy levels in devices with different EELs is illustrated in Fig. 3(b). The secondary electron cut-off (Ecut-off) values of pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiF, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr are 17.46, 17.50, 17.48 and 17.43 eV, respectively, and the corresponding work functions (WFs) are 3.76, 3.72, 3.74 and 3.79 eV, respectively. (WF = 21.22 eV − Ecut-off). From the valence band edge region, the energies separated between the valence band level and the Fermi level are determined to be 3.60, 3.50, 3.58 and 3.55 eV, respectively. The band gaps of these four types of ZnO EEL films are determined from the absorption spectrum. Thus the conductive bands (CBs) are about 4.10, 3.96, 4.06 and 4.08 eV, respectively (shown in Fig. 3(b)). In these cases, the good alignment of the conduction band of ZnO:LiF and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the fullerene leads to an ohmic-contact interface. Consequently, the ZnO:LiF layer could be finely tuned toward forming an ideal EEL, which benefits the efficient electron extraction process.

The J–V characteristics for inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with various light exposure time were measured under continuous AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performance results for devices with different EELs are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d). J–V curves were measured periodically with a certain time interval. Severe S-shape characteristics were observed in the devices with pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs at the initial stage of illumination, exhibiting low FF and Jsc. With continuous illumination, these device performances were enhanced significantly over time. On the contrary, the ZnO:LiF-based device reached its maximum efficiency very quickly and the light-soaking effect was almost eliminated. The S-shape is a typical effect originating from the poor charge extraction and collection efficiency.38 For devices with severe light soaking, the initial measurement always fails to achieve the best device performance, where S-shaped J–V characteristics with low Jsc and FF are usually observed. Only after enough light soaking time can device parameters reach saturation. Fig. 4(e) shows the time evolution of device efficiency with various EELs. The light-soaking effect for various devices was quantified by defining the light-soaking time (τs) as the time required for the device PCE to reach 95% of its maximum value (τs = 95%tPCEmax). Devices with pristine ZnO require approximately 450 seconds (s) to reach saturation. However, for ZnO:LiCl (Device C) and ZnO:LiBr (Device D) based devices, τs increases to approximately 690 s and 1410 s, respectively. Although Devices C and D achieve higher saturation efficiency, they did not exhibit the expected shorter soaking time compared with pristine ZnO. One possible explanation is that Cl− and Br− groups on the ZnO surface may cause more trap formation, which amplifies the light-soaking effect.39 Nevertheless, the ZnO:LiF-based PSC device, without further irradiation treatments, exhibits outstanding light-soaking-free properties.

To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism and explore the origin of the performance discrepancy for devices with different EELs, electron-only devices have also been fabricated with structure of ITO/EEL/Bphen/Liq/Al. The electrons are collected by the front ITO cathode under forward bias, which is similar to the electron transporting process in PSCs. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 5, the ZnO:LiF EEL is well suited to extract electrons that are injected via the Liq/Al top electrode. A high electron current is already seen for the un-illuminated ZnO:LiF-based device and the J–V characteristics remain essentially unaffected after illumination. These findings are in strong contrast to the results for the devices with pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs, in which the current densities are largely enhanced after illumination. This clearly demonstrates that the light exposure substantially improves the electron extraction at these three EEL/organic interfaces. As the top electrode is identical in all the devices, we attribute this behavior to an inefficient electron extraction via the EEL/cathode interface. Clearly, the ZnO:LiF EEL is excellently fitted to extract electrons with high electron current even without illumination. Improved electron transport and extraction is an efficient method to decrease carrier combination, and thereby enhance the PCE of PSCs. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate the superiority of LiF modification to improve the electron extraction for the pristine ZnO EEL, which is responsible for the high efficiency and light-soaking-free inverted devices.

Generally, the main causes of trap defects in solution-processed ZnO are nonlattice oxygen containing species on the surface. For further investigation of the composition properties of the different EELs, the O-1s spectra of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were analyzed in more detail. Typically, in a ZnO film, the highest-binding-energy peak at 529.7 ± 0.5 eV corresponds to the chemical bond between neighbouring zinc and oxygen atoms. The sub-peaks are related to the oxygen vacancy regions and adsorbed O2etc.40,41 Typical XPS O-1 s spectra for the ZnO films doped with different halogens are presented in Fig. 6, with resolved spectra shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). From Fig. S3 (ESI†), it is seen that the binding states of O-1s spectra were clearly resolved into three chemical components centered at 529.7 ± 0.5 eV (OA), 531.1 ± 0.5 eV (OB) and 532.8 ± 0.5 eV (OC), respectively. The proportion of oxygen vacancy components decreases in the order of devices ZnO:LiBr, ZnO:LiCl, ZnO and ZnO:LiF, respectively, which is ascribed to differences in oxygen adsorption capacity of doped elements. The reducibility of fluorine, oxygen, chlorine and bromine ions is reduced in turn, which causes the relevant increased chemical adsorption capacities on oxygen. The result here matches well with the initial unsaturated performance of corresponding devices.

The photocurrent-density (Jph) to effective bias voltage (Veff) characteristics of the P3HT:PC61BM based inverted PSCs with various EELs were explored. Jph was defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represented the current densities measured under illumination and in the dark condition, respectively. Veff was determined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the built-in potential measured at Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage. The voltage dependent ratio of Jph to Jsat could reflect the charge extraction probability, where Jsat is the saturation current at high Veff (>1.0 V).42 As shown in Fig. 7(a) (without illumination), at a large Veff (≥0.6 V), the high Veff assists the photo-generated charge carriers being swept out efficiently prior to recombination, therefore giving rise to an almost 100% collection of the photo-generated charges. While in a low Veff region, the number of extracted photo-generated carriers decreases due to the increase of charge recombination. Jph values obtained for the devices with pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs decrease much faster than that of the cell with ZnO:LiF EEL at Veff < 0.4 V, implying the much lower charge recombination in the ZnO:LiF-based device. These results indicate that the application of a ZnO:LiF EEL suppresses the charge recombination and improves the charge-extraction efficiency. Upon exposing the devices under AM 1.5G illumination for several minutes, the traps or defects may be filled with photo-generated electrons, thus the charge-transport capability of the pristine ZnO, ZnO:LiCl and ZnO:LiBr EELs are strongly ameliorated leading to almost identical Jph–Veff characteristics with that of the ZnO:LiF device. It is therefore clear that the LiF modified ZnO is a perfect EEL, offering excellent charge collection capacity with few traps or defects.

To further illustrate that the ZnO:LiF EEL also shows high electron extraction performance in other PSC systems, a typical high-performance active layer PTB7-Th:PC71BM was used to construct the PSC device. The J–V curves and the related data are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2. The ZnO:LiF-based device shows an enhancement of 12.6% in PCE, from 7.86% to 8.85%, compared with the pristine ZnO-based device. The performance enhancement can be also explained by the improved electron extraction efficiency due to the reduced oxygen vacancy defects at the ZnO:LiF/organic interface.

Conclusion
In summary, the application of various alkali metal halides including LiF, LiCl and LiBr in modifying ZnO was used to address the light-soaking issue in inverted PSCs. Our results indicate that the presence of ZnO:LiF could help to reduce the trap state density at the EEL/active layer interface and increase electron extraction efficiency. As a result, the ZnO:LiF EEL significantly shortens the light-soaking time. Significantly enhanced PCE was achieved in PSCs based on the modified ZnO:LiF EEL with negligible light-soaking effect. The optimized PCE values of 4.06% and 8.85% were realized for P3HT:PCBM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, which are 21.2% and 12.6% higher than those of devices with a pristine ZnO EEL, respectively. The results suggest that the LiF modified ZnO EEL developed in this work has the potential for application in high performance solution-processable PSCs.
