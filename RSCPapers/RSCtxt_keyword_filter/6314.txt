Consequently, fuel cells have been designed to efficiently generate electricity from clean and renewable fuels and have gained increasing attention. In recent years, the development of earth-abundant and cost-effective materials for application in fuel cells has become a key objective worldwide to push the commercialization of this technology. Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have become one of the most popular research topics because their alkaline environment allows a wider range of cost-effective materials to be employed as membranes and electrodes. Unitized regenerative AEMFCs (UR-AEMFCs) have also attracted great research interest because of their additional energy storage capability. The electrode performance plays critical role in the practical application of (UR-)AEMFCs. Oxide-based precious metal (PM)-free electrocatalysts have been developed as one class of promising candidates for application in (UR-)AEMFCs due to their many advantages, such as low cost, earth-abundant resources, intrinsic tunable electronic structures and surface properties, and structural flexibility, which can be utilized to lower the kinetic and thermodynamic barriers of oxygen electrocatalysis in an alkaline environment. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in oxide-based PM-free electrocatalysts used for (UR-)AEMFCs considering their synthetic strategies, such as morphology and structure control, electronic and surface properties.

1. Introduction
Although alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) are pioneering clean-energy technology put into practical use and known as the power behind the space program, they have not been as successfully developed as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to some technical problems, such as their anion exchange rate. In the last decade, AFC technology has been reinvigorated with the rapid progress of anion exchange membranes (AEMs).1,2 The main driving force for the development of AFCs is that they can potentially allow the use of precious metal (PM)-free catalysts, including transition metals and alloys, oxide-based electrocatalysts, and even metal-free electrocatalysts, which are both thermodynamically and kinetically feasible in alkaline media.3–5 Besides, the potential cost effectiveness of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), there are many advantages that are particularly noteworthy as follows: (1) the electrode kinetics of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is facilitated in an environment with a high pH value; (2) Besides hydrogen, a wide range of fuels (such as alcohol) can be employed in AEMFCs. The electrodes in an alkaline environment can function with CO2 in variable fuels, and have the capability to operate in air; (3) AEMFCs provide the possibility for the use of less expensive polymer materials, and thus fluorinated raw materials are not necessary; (4) by applying bifunctional electrocatalysts, unitized regenerative AEMFCs (UR-AEMFCs) integrated with a fuel cell (FC) and an electrolysis cell (EC) together have been developed with high efficiency, which provide a promising pathway for future energy conversion and storage. Thus, successful applications for the commercialization of (UR-)AEMFC devices can be foreseen in the near feature.
In the first stage of AEMFC technology, platinum (Pt) was commonly used as a standard catalyst in the development of AEMs and anion-conducting ionomers, enabling a standard comparison with the electrodes in PEMFCs. Varcoe et al. reported an AEMFC using radiation-grafted poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene) (ETFE) as the AEM material. The electrodes were composed of Pt–Ru alloy as the anode and Pt as the cathode, which reached a peak power density (PPD) of ∼130 mW cm−2 at 50 °C under H2/O2 operating conditions.6 Huang et al. reported a record-high AEMFC performance of 3.4 W cm−2 with Pt/C as the cathode catalyst, and PtRu/C as the anode catalyst under H2/O2 at 80 °C. By applying the highly conductive reinforced block copolymers as the membrane, the ohmic loss caused by water uptake was greatly reduced; meanwhile, the stability of the full-cell was verified over 500 h current load with no change in the membrane resistance and minimal loss in cell performance.7 This work highlighted the significance of the properties of the membrane in AEMFCs. In the last two decades, several classes of platinum group metal-free electrocatalysts have been developed towards accelerating the electrode reactions in AEMFCs. For example, silver (Ag) and some metal alloys have already been quite well studied and confirmed to be catalytically active for the ORR in alkaline media.6,8–11 Based on the advanced progress with membranes and hydroxide exchange ionomers, a prototype AEMFC with an Ag-based cathode was reported to yield a high PPD of 920 mW cm−2 under H2/CO2-free air at 95 °C.12 The 4e− ORR mechanism involving the *H2O-mediated and conventional 4e− associative pathways was suggested to be preferable on the Ag (111) crystal facet in an alkaline environment.13 Another promising class of PM-free catalysts for the ORR is transition metal–nitrogen–carbon electrocatalysts. Their activities are generally thought to originate from their defect-laden active sites, where the transition metal, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) coexist.14 Transition metal catalysts incorporating Co and Fe have shown great potential with superior ORR electrocatalytic activity. The incorporation of N with carbon has been employed to effectively modify the local charge density distribution in the carbon support, thus leading to an improvement in its reactivity and catalytic activity.15 Recently, metal-free electrocatalysts, such as nitrogen-doped carbon, have been studied in some valuable works.16,17 The uniformity of the porous structure in the bulk carbon matrix, together with the N-doping active sites, was confirmed to exhibit a PPD of ∼95 mW cm−2 at 60 °C in the cell performance test.18 More recently, Peng et al. reported cobalt ferrite nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon, which besides good ex situ activity, achieved with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.71 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the ORR, and the carbon-based cobalt ferrite nanoparticles performed excellently in operating AEMFCs, generating a PPD of up to 1.35 W cm−2 under H2/O2 operating conditions.19
Metal oxides and their composite materials have been widely studied as promising candidates to replace PM electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, showing highly promising bifunctional catalytic performance and durability.20–24 Firstly, the use of PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts will greatly reduce the cost of AEMFCs. Through rational design of the structures and surface properties of oxide-based materials, they are capable of providing efficient and durable active sites for both the ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution,25,26 thereby opening the door for their application in UR-AEMFC devices. Due to the scarcity of efficient and stable anion conducting materials, namely AEMs and ionomers, most of the PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts developed for AEMFCs in current works have mostly been tested by the rotating disk (or ring-disk) electrode (RDE or RRDE) in alkaline solution. Although superior activities have been witnessed for various oxide-based materials in solution, the relevance of their catalytic performance under RDE/RRDE measurements is not straightforward compared to that in real cell conditions. The in-cell performance of electrocatalysts is largely related to their reaction capability on the electrode reaction interface. The solution-based RDE environment allows for a thin and uniform catalyst layer on the electrode without significant mass and ionic transport loss, while a balance between the reaction and mass transport is highly required in cell operating conditions. To drive their applications, recent efforts have been devoted to achieving high performance with these oxide-based electrocatalysts. Among the previous studies towards electrode catalysts in UR-AEMFCs, PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER have been widely studied because of their high potential in reducing the activation overpotentials of both the ORR and OER, and their economic effectiveness. To realize satisfactory performances in UR-AEMFCs using oxide-based electrocatalysts, material design together with the optimization of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) should be comprehensively considered.3,27,28 Bifunctional oxide-based electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER in alkaline media have become an interesting research topic in recent years.29 The rate-determining steps (RDS) of this reversible reaction pair (ORR/OER) require different surface properties on their active sites, and thus it is difficult to develop bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with single active sites. Transition metal oxides (TMOs), especially cobalt and manganese oxides, perovskites and spinel oxides as well as their carbon hybrids, have been widely reported to be promising candidates for electrode reactions in alkaline media. To favour the catalytic reactions at heterogeneous interfaces in the electrode, special efforts have been made to overcome two major hurdles, i.e., optimizing the catalytic ability, namely activity, durability, and bifunctionality with active sites, and the other is to increase the conductivity of the bulk material to facilitate with the reaction, which involves four major principles of electrocatalyst design for electrode reactions in fuel cells.
Herein, we comprehensively review the efforts towards developing oxide-based electrocatalysts with subtle electronic structures and surface properties, doping configurations, microstructure modification, and synergetic effects for application in electrocatalytic reactions in (UR-)AEMFCs, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The synthetic strategies and structure control methods of oxide-based electrocatalysts will be discussed, and their correlations with the state-of-art ex situ and in situ catalytic performance will be presented. The experimental attempts and theoretical analysis are discussed in this review to provide perspectives from oxide-based materials design to cell application. Finally, the challenges and perspectives with oxide-based catalysts for their large-scale use in fuel cells will be discussed.

2. Fundamentals of anion exchange membrane fuel cells
Low-temperature PEMFCs have long been commercially developed as next-generation energy conversion devices for a wide range of applications. However, this technology is limited by the sluggish ORR kinetics in an acidic environment, which requires scarce and expensive catalysts such as Pt. Thus, to reduce the cost of fuel cells, inexpensive and efficient catalysts need to be applied. In this regard, AEMFCs have attracted great attention because the cathodic ORR is more facile in an alkaline environment, thus facilitating the application of PM-free materials. During the operation of an AEMFC, when ambient air or pure oxygen is introduced, hydroxide ions are generated due to the electrochemical ORR at the cathode, then transported through the AEM to the anode, where the water is electrochemically generated from the fuel (such as H2) oxidation reaction, and then diffuse back and consumed with ORR at the cathode.
2.1 Anion exchange membranes
The AEM is a key part of AEMFCs, which determines the reaction pathways in the fuel cells. In the last decade, great efforts have been made to develop highly conductive and stable AEMs, also known as hydroxide exchange membranes, thereby opening the door for the application of AEMFCs.3,30,31 AEMs are solid polymer electrolytes, which facilitate with the conduction of hydroxide or carbonate anions (HCO3− and CO32−, respectively) from the cathode to the anode in the reverse direction of proton transport through the PEM. The AEM polymer backbone provides “anchors” to fix cation groups, and these cationic groups contribute to the hydroxide ion mobility. Prior knowledge has led to the general perception that AEMs have too low conductivity and chemical stability (especially in the systems with high pH values) for application in an alkaline environment.30 Recently, great progress has been made for AEMs with high conductivity and stable backbones,2,30–32 thus promoting the realization of high-level cell performances in AEMFCs. Several reported AEMs have shown conductivity of around 200 mS cm−1.31,33–35 Highly conductive AEMs paired with optimized electrodes have been reported to yield a PPD as high as 3.4 W cm−2.7
However, despite the breakthrough progress with AEM conductivity, the mechanical and chemical stability of the polymer backbones still remain a big challenge in this area.36 The catalyst durability target in AEMFCs proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) requires a performance loss of less than 40% after an accelerated stress test for 10000 cycles in the voltage range of 0.60 to 0.95 V under H2/CO2-scrubbed air.37 However, only a few available works have reported long-term durability tests exceeding 500 h.12,38–41 The cationic moieties within the polymers or side-groups for anion conduction are the most susceptible sites for nucleophilic attack. Great research efforts have been paid to the design of stable cationic moieties. For example, quaternary ammonium head groups, especially the trimethyl ammonium cations, have been found to exhibit excellent conductivity and stability.42,43 Recent works have shed light on the strategies to protect the cationic groups in AEMs, in addition to improving their polymer backbone reinforcements, thus promoting the stability of AEMFCs.44,45 Despite that rapid progress achieved with AEM materials, most of the current research works towards electrocatalyst design for AEMFCs are based on two commercially available AEMs, namely FAA-3-PK-130 from Fumatech Company and A901 from Tokuyama.
2.2 Cathodic oxygen reduction reaction
In addition to AEM development, a practical membrane electrode assemble (MEA) in AEMFC single cells is composed of many other components, including the cathode catalyst, anode catalyst, and anion exchange ionomers. Among them, both electrode catalysts play a vital role for the AEMFC performance. In a typical H2/O2-feed AEMFC, electrooxidation of hydrogen occurs at the anode and electroreduction of oxygen at the cathode. The ORR commonly proceeds through the 2e− or 4e− pathway in an alkaline environment, as shown in Fig. 2. The preferred ORR pathway is the direct 4e− to OH−, which is commonly performed with Pt catalysts in acid environment. In an alkaline environment, due to the decrease in the extent of anion adsorption on the electrocatalysts, it is advantageous to reduce the cathodic ORR overpotential. Alternatively, the oxygen is reduced to HO2−via a 2e− pathway, followed by the second 2e− step, which mainly leads to the reduction of the intermediate hydrogen peroxide HO2− to OH−. The combination of these two reaction steps is known as the pseudo 4e− ORR pathway.46

Through both the 2e− and 4e− transfer reactions, O2 can be reduced to hydroxide ions. The overpotential of the ORR is related to the pH value of the medium. The previous theoretical calculations conducted by Blizanac et al. were plotted in a Pourbaix diagram, as shown in Fig. 2, with the overpotential of ORR as the y axis and the pH value as the x axis.47 Obviously, the overpotential of the 2e− pathway is much lower than the 4e− pathway to form H2O (see lines 3 and 3′), which means that it is kinetically favorable to go through the peroxide intermediate species during the ORR on these electrodes without the strong adsorption of O2 on the electrode. In an alkaline environment with a pH of > 12, a cross-section of lines 2 and 3′ appears, indicating that at a high pH value, the 4e− transfer reactions can be favorable on some special designed active sites. The corrosive intermediate product HO2− presents the threat of the corrosion of the components in fuel cells over time.
To reduce the cathodic overpotential, the design of electrocatalysts should push the ORR to follow the 4e− pathway. The ORR mechanism on the surface of TMOs has been proposed to be different from that on the surface of PMs.48 Various ORR pathways have been demonstrated with oxide electrocatalysts, depending on their specific crystal structure, molecular composition, or surface properties.49,50 When the surface cations are not fully coordinated with oxygen in stoichiometric oxides, they react with the oxygen in water to fulfill the full oxygen coordination. Accordingly, a possible four-step catalytic route has been proposed, as shown in the following equations (eqn (1)–(5)).51,52 The reduction of a surface cation is charge-compensated by protonation of a surface oxygen ligand to create OH− species. The absorbed OH− species further interact with adsorbed O2− to form structure-sensitive O configurations. The competition between the O2−/OH− displacement (eqn (3)) and OH− regeneration (eqn (5)) has been found to be the RDS in alkaline electrolyte.48,52 Mm+ − O−2 + H2O + e− → M(m−1)+ − OH− + OH−(1) O2 + e− → O−2(ads)(2) M(m−1)+ − OH− + O−2(ads) → Mm+ − O − O−2 + OH−(3) Mm+ − O − O−2 + H2O + e− → M(m−1)+ − O − OH− + OH−(4) M(m−1)+ − O − OH− + e− → Mm+ − O−2 + OH−(5)
2.3 Anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction
In recent years, research interests have been widely focused on the development of advanced AEMs and electrocatalysts for the cathode reaction in the field of AEMFC technology. In contrast, anode electrocatalysts for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in AEMFCs have only been seriously studied in the past five years. The HOR kinetics on PM-based electrocatalysts have been recognized to be very fast in acidic fuel cells, but in contrast to that in acid media, the kinetics of the HOR on precious metals is relatively slower under alkaline conditions, which usually requires a higher metal loading on the anode.53 Accordingly, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR is also crucial to achieve high and stable power output from AEMFCs.
Durst et al. investigated the exchange current densities of PM nanoparticles using an H2 pump via mass transport-free kinetic measurements. Their experiments showed that the exchange current densities of the traditional PM-based electrocatalysts (such as, Pt/C, Pd/C and Ir/C) decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude when the electrolyte goes from low (pH = 0) to high pH values (pH = 13).54 The HOR process goes through the following equation in alkaline media: H2(g) + 2OH−aq → 2H2O + 2e−(6)which is a combination of several individual steps, where the first step is the Tafel (T) reaction (eqn (7)) involving the dissociative adsorption of molecular dihydrogen without electron transfer: H2 + 2* → *-Had(7)
The *-Had binding energy is reported to be the key parameter influencing the HOR kinetics, and the design of electrocatalysts for the HOR usually requires affinity for the chemisorption of molecular hydrogen. The second step is known as the Heyrovsky (H) reaction (eqn (8)), where the electrons transfer from molecular dihydrogen to the active sites, which was proposed by Bronoel et al. to be the RDS of the HOR at high overpotentials in electrolytes with a pH value in the range of 7–14.55 In this step, a weaker metal–hydrogen (M–H) binding energy will be preferable to enhance the HOR in alkaline media. H2 + H−aq → Had + H2O + e−(8)
In the next step, Had will be consumed followed by the discharge of adsorbed hydrogen atom, which is known as the Volmer (V) reaction (eqn (9)): Had + OH−aq → H2O + e−(9)
HOR occurring on single crystal Pt in alkaline media has been suggested with the T or H reaction as the RDS. The slower HOR kinetics at a high pH value has been mostly attributed to the adsorption of OH− species on the active sites, which blocks the H2 adsorption, and consequently hinders the reaction.56,57 The Pt–Ru alloy has been developed and shows high promise for electrocatalytic HOR in alkaline media;53 however, its mechanism is still controversial. It was proposed that Ru can possibly optimize the binding energy of Had or OH species and avoid the undesirable cation adsorption during the HOR in alkaline conditions, but more evidence is needed. In this case, further investigation towards the electrocatalytic mechanism of the HOR in alkaline media is required for developing effective electrocatalysts to boost the anodic reaction in AEMFCs.
2.4 Unitized regenerative-AEMFCs and oxygen evolution reaction
Unitized regenerative fuel cells (UR-FCs) have emerged as a new concept to expand the application scenarios of fuel cells. It is a combination of an energy conversion device and energy storage system, which can realize sustainable and efficient power output and renewable resource storage in an integrated stack system.50,51 Unitized regenerative anion exchange membranes fuel cells (UR-AEMFCs) have been widely studied in recent years with the development of advanced AEMs and bifunctional electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment. UR-AEMFC has attracted great interest in recent years because this integrated energy conversion and storage device is suitable for various applications, for example, rechargeable aircrafts, clean-energy vehicles, and residential backup power. NASA has filed many patents related to this technology since the 1960s. As illustrated in Fig. 1, during the operation of a single UR-AEMFC in the EC mode, H2O is electrochemically split into H2 and O2via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and OER at the anode. While switching to the FC mode, H2 and O2 are transformed to H2O together with electricity output through the HOR and ORR, similar to the behavior in normal AEMFCs.52 In the FC mode, the ORR kinetics is the main barrier for achieving a high power output, while in the EC mode, the fuel storage efficiency is primarily determined by the OER kinetics.
The key challenge in the development of UR-AEMFC technology is the oxygen electrode, which can simultaneously lower the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of the ORR and OER.58–60 The peroxide intermediate species generated during the ORR with a relatively weaker adsorption of O2 on the electrode is kinetically favorable in the ORR process. In contrast, the kinetic activation barriers of the peroxide formation or O2 evolution from peroxide need to be overcome in the reverse steps in the OER. Conventional bifunctional electrocatalysts mainly include Pt, Ir and Ru metals, and their oxides,61–65 which are usually prepared by mixing an efficient component for the ORR, such as Pt, paired with a component for the OER, such as Ir, IrO2 and IrO2–RuO2.66–71 PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts have specially been exploited as cost-effective alternatives in recent years.72 Based on the theoretical analysis of the ORR and OER mechanism on the cathode,73–77 the RDSs of both reactions are quite different, which makes it challenging to develop efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with single active sites. Suntivich et al.76 studied the mechanism of the OER on the surface of metal oxides in an alkaline environment. Firstly, the oxidation of hydroxide anions occurs when hydroxyl radicals are adsorbed on the active sites to give Bm+–OH−. The coupled protons and electrons escape from Bm+–OH− to form B(m+1)+–O2−. Next, the nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl anion on B(m+1)+–O2− yields the hydroperoxide intermediate Bm+–OOH−. Finally, followed by a further electron transfer reaction pathway, O2 is released, and simultaneously, the active site is set free. The reaction rate of the OER on metal oxides is limited by either the formation of the O–O bond in the OOH adsorbate on B-site ions or the deprotonation of the oxyhydroxide group to form peroxide ions.
TMOs and hydroxides have demonstrated to display improved OER kinetics, while maintaining ORR catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte, especially perovskite and spinel oxides have been explored as promising bifunctional catalysts to reduce the cost of materials for the oxygen electrode in UR-AEMFCs.58 The adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen-mediated mechanisms have been recognized as the two main OER mechanisms on perovskite oxides.78,79 The adsorbate evolution mechanism explains the OER on perovskites as 4-electron charge-transfer steps, which involve a series of intermediates interacting with the B-site metal cations. In contrast, the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism suggests that oxygen in the oxide lattice acts as the reaction intermediate itself. When the Fermi level dips into the overlapping transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p bands, oxygen vacancies are introduced and a net lower activation energy barrier is produced.80,81
3. Advantages of oxide-based precious metal-free electrocatalysts for (UR-)AEMFCs
3.1 Low cost and abundant storage
Recent advances in the use of PM-free oxides as cost-effective electrocatalysts for fuel cells are of great value. To date, the best-known Pt or Pt alloy electrocatalysts for the ORR cost approximately $50 g−1. Ru-based oxides for the OER cost around $2.5 g−1.82 In addition, the scarce storage and difficult access of these PMs limit their commercial viability.83,84 Electrocatalysts operating under alkaline conditions show fundamentally enhanced kinetics, thus making the use of platinum group metal-free catalysts more available, such as the less expensive Ag (∼$1 g−1).11,85–87 Furthermore, TMO-based electrocatalysts are more cost-effective for fuel cells. For example, perovskites have been widely explored as promising materials for the ORR in lithium–oxygen batteries and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).88–94 One of the most important reasons for the wide research interest in perovskites is that they encompass most of the transition metals in the periodic table with different structures, giving rise to high compositional flexibility. These metal oxides are only composed of earth-abundant and low cost elements, such as the transition metals Fe (∼$0.0001 g−1), Mn (∼$0.02 g−1), Co (∼$0.03 g−1), and Ni (∼$0.02 g−1), and early rare-earth metals (e.g., La ∼$0.02 g−1).11 The raw materials of these metal oxides are largely stored in the earth and easy to extract. TMOs, especially the best-known manganese and cobalt oxides, have been demonstrated to show comparable catalytic performances to PM-based electrocatalysts for the ORR/OER in alkaline media.95,96 Thus, the successful application of these oxide-based electrocatalysts in AEMFCs will largely reduce the cost of this advanced technology.
3.2 High surface area and highly active sites
The intrinsic goal for the design of electrocatalysts in AEMFCs is to achieve massive and efficient catalytic sites on the surface that remain stable under the operating conditions in an alkaline environment. Conventional structures with non-precious metal electrocatalysts tend to have low active site density, implying the specific surface reaction rate can be quite low, thus directly leading to thick catalyst layers in the electrode with notoriously poor mass transport capabilities.97,98 Oxide-based electrocatalysts have been explored as competitive PM-free electrocatalysts for electrode reactions due to their high surface area, multivalent nature and composition diversity to provide efficient active sites. Comprehensive strategies have been devised to correlate the surface properties and electrocatalytic performances of oxides, which allow the “forward design” of oxide-based electrocatalysts with highly active sites towards specific reactions. The kinetically favorable RDS on metal oxides was demonstrated to be dependent on the O2−/OH− displacement or surface oxygen protonation on metal cations, as mentioned in Section 2. Many valuable studies have shown that these oxide materials are capable of providing PM-competitive active sites through rational design. Taking perovskites oxides as an example, their catalytic activities are highly dependent on their surface properties and metal cation compositions, which can be precisely controlled to achieve desirable binding energetics of the reaction intermediates, consequently achieving ORR/OER activity and stability.26
3.3 Structural flexibility
Another important merit of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts is their structural flexibility, which can be utilized to create novel nanostructures and desirable morphologies. Both the ORR and OER in (UR-)AEMFCs are generally gas-involving electrochemical reactions, which occur at the interface of the solid electrocatalyst, gas, and electrolyte, where electrons and anions can also be transferred, the so-called triple-phase boundary regions (TPBs). Besides the intrinsic catalytic activity of electrocatalysts, it has been widely recognized that the construction of TPBs can directly affect the surface accessibility and mass transportation behaviors for favorable active sites, thus greatly influencing the cell performance. For example, the hierarchical structures within the electrode are built with catalyst particles, which are typically of micro-/sub-micrometer dimensions but internally consist of nano-building blocks and/or nano-domains.99–101 At the TPB regions, not only enough active sites are needed to support efficient reactions, but also desirable porosity and a microarchitecture are required to assist mass transportation, as shown in Fig. 3, to maximize the role of the active sites. From this point of view, flexible structures are preferable with electrode design in AEMFCs. TMOs with diverse nanostructures, including nanotubes (NTs), nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs), nanofibers (NFs), nanosheets (NSs), nanoparticles (NPs) and nanoaerogels (NAs), have been explored with the aim providing sufficient active sites in electrocatalysis for energy conversion and storage devices, especially lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.102–105 Metal oxides with hollow structures have been extensively reported to show a low density, high surface area, and high loading capacity. The presence of nanoscale hollow interiors with functional shells endows them with technological significance in the catalysis field.106 The hollow structure geometry can be obtained via the conventional template method, which has been commonly used to create spherical hollow nanostructures.101 Moreover, various simplified procedures have been explored to fabricate special hollow structures of metal oxides, such as the Kirkendall effect,107 galvanic replacement,108 chemical etching,109,110 thermal decomposition111–113 and Ostwald ripening effect.114,115 Some special structures have also been constructed and showed good electrochemical performances, including urchin-like microspheres,116,117 mesoporous microspheres,118,119 core–shell mesoporous microspheres,120 double-shelled hollow microcubes121,122 and flower-like superstructures.123

3.4 Benefits from synergetic effect
Hybrid structures combining metal oxides and carbon materials, such as heteroatom-doped carbon, graphene, graphene oxides and carbon matrices with different morphologies and porosities, have been recommended as promising candidates instead of oxides alone for application in fuel cells.125,126 The biggest obstacle hindering the application of oxide electrocatalysts for electrode reactions is considered to be their lower bulk electronic conductivity compared with metal-based electrocatalysts.127 Electrocatalysts with high electronic conductivity may enable low ohmic loss in fuel cell systems.128–130 The present research works towards oxide-based catalysts in AEMFCs basically consider oxide–carbon composites to alleviate the electrical resistance, which will largely improve the fuel cell performance. By combining oxides with carbon materials, researchers have demonstrated that the addition of carbon can enhance the conduction pathway between oxide particles (external electron pathway), thus maximizing the utilization of the oxide.131,132
In addition, the introduction of oxide–carbon interfaces by forming oxide–carbon hybrids can be beneficial for oxygen electrocatalysis.133,134 It was found that functional carbon in oxide–carbon composites can facilitate the ORR process via the 2e− pathway to HO2−.135–137 Poux et al. proposed that the ORR on carbon-containing perovskite (LaCoO3 or La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) composites was conducted as coupled reactions.137 Firstly, O2 was reduced to HO2− on carbon, and then the oxide facilitated the following HO2− reduction or decomposition. A similar mechanism was also reported by Malkhandi et al.138 The synergetic effect of metal oxide–carbon hybrids was also found, which can modify the electronic structures of oxides.139–141 Haas et al. observed a shift in the Co K-edge for La0.6Ca0.4CoO3–carbon composites via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements.142 This design concept is an important step to further boost the catalytic performance of oxide-based electrodes. Various synthetic strategies can be employed to fabricate hybrid oxide–carbon electrocatalysts with optimal electrical and chemical coupling effects between the oxide nanoparticles and carbon substrates.143,144 An in situ synthetic approach was demonstrated as an effective way to create metal oxide–carbon hybrids by directly growing the oxide component in the presence of functionalized carbon materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets). Many ex situ strategies have also been proposed by attaching pre-prepared oxide components onto the surface of carbon through covalent, noncovalent or electrostatic interaction.145,146 A relatively strong covalent bond between carbon and metal oxides is preferable for catalytic application, and thus in situ synthesis is considered to be more favorable for the fabrication of oxide–carbon composite electrocatalysts.29
Furthermore, many functional carbon materials have been demonstrated, which can provide additional catalytic sites to facilitate with electrode reactions in oxide-based carbon composites.127,147–150 For example, Pham et al. reported multi-heteroatom doped defect-enriched CNTs (MH-DCNT), which exhibited an E1/2 of 0.81 V vs. RHE and a limiting current density of 5.0 mA cm−2 for the ORR in alkaline solution, reflecting its intrinsic catalytic ability.150 Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are typically recognized as promising components in electrocatalyst design, which have shown good ORR electrocatalytic activity and durability. The interaction between the graphene π electrons and nitrogen lone-pair electrons is likely to bring desirable electronic properties, which are beneficial for electrocatalysis.24,125,151,152 Recently, the progress on functional carbon-based electrocatalysts for AEMFCs have been reviewed in other works.147,153,154 It is worth mentioning that the use of carbon materials as additives for the electrocatalytic ORR and OER may bring durability issues because carbon oxidation may occur as a side reaction at high potentials. Considering this obstacle, vital works are in progress to suppress the carbon corrosion under the operating conditions in fuel cells.
4. Recent advances in oxide-based electrocatalysts for (UR-)AEMFCs
Based on the above-mentioned advantages, PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts have emerged as a branch of promising candidates to replace precious metals for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. Many efforts have been made towards the application of these materials for electrode reactions in (UR-)AEMFCs. For example, TMOs, especially cobalt and manganese oxides have attracted great interest as electrocatalysts for the ORR and/or OER in an alkaline environment. Previous theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that the presence of variable oxidation states and unique surface structures of TMO-based electrocatalysts can make them highly active for electrocatalytic reactions in alkaline solution.58,74 In addition, their ability to mix well with another material, such as carbon, significantly increases the electrical conductivity of oxides, which makes oxide-based electrocatalysts highly efficient as electrode catalysts in (UR-)AEMFCs. In recent years, many successful cases of AEMFCs using oxide-based materials as oxygen (air) electrode electrocatalysts have been witnessed, and the representative works are summarized in Table 1. In this section, we mainly focus on the recent advances of PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts developed for (UR-)AEMFCs. The design strategies and the in-cell performances achieved with oxide-based electrocatalysts will be highlighted. Moreover, we will discuss the current methods for the fabrication of electrodes in (UR-)AEMFCs with oxide-based electrocatalysts.

4.1 Single metal oxide-based electrocatalysts

4.1.1 Cobalt oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Among the numerous PM-free single metal oxides, cobalt and manganese oxides (CoOx and MnOx) of various structures have attracted special attention for actively catalyzing the ORR/OER in alkaline media as a result of the intrinsic valence properties of Co and Mn cations.141,167,168 Other TMOs (such as NiOx and FeOx) have not been thoroughly investigated to date. For these TMOs, it has been reported that by doping with another metal cation (such as Cox+ or Mnx+) in complex structures, they can also show optimized catalytic performances for the ORR/OER in alkaline media, which will be provided in an extra discussion in this section.
Cobalt oxides are widely studied for the ORR in alkaline solutions mainly because of their easy preparation and promising high electrocatalytic ORR performance.169–172 During the ORR, Co3+ is demonstrated to be the donor–acceptor reduction site because of its ability to effectively provide and capture electrons in alkaline solution.173 The distribution mode of the Co metal cations on different coordination sites is dependent on the size and morphology of the oxide particles.174–176 The synergetic effect between cobalt oxides and carbon materials has been highly valued in the design of electrode electrocatalysts for AEMFCs.
High-loading nitrogen-doped reduced graphene-supported CoO NPs (CoO/rGO) were reported by He et al.177 The RDE measurement for the ORR performance in alkaline solution showed an onset potential and E1/2 as high as 0.95 V (vs. RHE) and 0.83 V (vs. RHE), respectively, with this CoO/rGO electrocatalyst, indicating the promising application value of this type of oxide-based electrocatalyst. To achieve a high specific surface area, carbon materials with two or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) structures have been developed. For example, Liang et al. reported a cobalt oxide-based hybrid structure with multi-walled CNTs.144 The as-synthesized CoO/nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) showed a significantly higher ORR current density, possibly due to the higher electrical conductivity of the CNT support. The CoO/NCNT hybrid showed higher ORR activity and stability under a highly corrosive alkaline solution (10 M NaOH) at 80 °C, demonstrating the novelty of strongly coupled inorganic/nanocarbon hybrids as a system for oxygen electrolysis in alkaline media. Wang et al. developed 3D N-doped graphene oxide-supported core–shell Co/CoO nanoparticles (Co/CoO-NGA).24 Different from the traditional wet-chemistry method, they obtained the core–shell structure via a hydrothermal method followed by annealing treatment to control the growth of the shells on pre-synthesized Co nanoparticles. The replacement of the “shell” metal oxide particles with pure metal was thought to minimize the resistance between the TMO particles and substrates. The catalytic performance of Co/CoO-NGA in a half-cell was similar to that of the commercial Pt/C electrode, with the E1/2 of −0.189 (V vs. Ag/AgCl), which was very close to that of the Pt/C (−0.170 V vs. Ag/AgCl) catalyst. The stability of Co/CoO-NGA was also examined. Only 2% current loss was observed after a 13000 s durability test, whereas for the commercial Pt/C, the current loss was approximately 22%. Additionally, the AEMFC fabricated with Co/CoO-NGA delivered a PPD of 110 mW cm−2, which is comparable to that with Pt/C (120 mW cm−2) under the same operating conditions and MEA fabrication parameters. Guo et al. reported monodisperse Co/CoO NPs deposited on a graphene support through a self-assembly method in solution.141 RDE measurements were carried out to study the ORR activity and kinetics on the Co/CoO NPs and different carbon-supported Co/CoO NPs in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The graphene-supported Co/CoO NPs showed a more positive E1/2 (0.176 V vs. Ag/AgCl) than the carbon-supported Co/CoO NPs (0.290 V vs. Ag/AgCl). It was found that the optimized Co size and CoO thickness, together with the interaction effect brought by appropriate supports led to the enhancement in the catalytic activity of the CoO oxide NPs. These comparisons indicate that cobalt oxides will exhibit similar catalytic performances to commercial Pt/C in AEMFC applications.
Huang et al. developed CoO@Co/N-doped carbon (CoO@Co/N–C) core–shell nanoparticles via the in situ reduction of cobalt(II)-1,10-phenanthroline precursor in the presence of a commercial high-surface-area carbon material, and subsequent pyrolysis at high temperature (Fig. 4a).156 The as-synthesized catalyst achieved an onset potential of 0.99 V (vs. RHE) and a limiting current density of ∼7 mA cm−2 (at 0.3 V vs. RHE) in alkaline solution (Fig. 4b), which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The in-cell performance and durability of the as-prepared CoO@Co/N–C as the cathode catalyst in the AEMFC is presented in Fig. 4c and d, respectively, exhibiting a PPD of 237 mW cm−2 under H2/O2 operating conditions. In addition, the stability test for CoO@Co/N–C showed than a nearly constant current density was maintained during the 100 h operation of potential hold at 0.4 V under H2/air in the AEMFC. These results indicate the potential superior performance of CoO@Co/N–C as a cathode catalyst compared with the commercial Pt/C for AEMFCs. In this work, the differentiated performance of the polarization curves may be also affected by the MEA preparation strategy, which requires further specification. A very high cathode catalyst loading of 2 mg cm−2 was applied in this work, which can possibly lead to a thick catalyst layer, thus resulting in gas transportation and water flooding issues.

Recently, Xiong et al. reported a 2D-architecture N–C–CoOx material, which was developed by embedding CoOx nanoparticles onto nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon substates, as shown in Fig. 5a.155 The cathode implemented with N–C–CoOx in an AEMFC was paired with a low-loading PM anode. The ORR kinetics on N–C–CoOx evaluated through RDE measurements was not very good compared with other PM-free electrocatalysts in the literature, with the extracted onset and E1/2 potentials of only 0.78 and 0.71 V vs. RHE, respectively.97,178 In contrast, by reaching 7.4 W mg−1PM cm−2 with a total PM loading of 0.1 mg cm−2, the well-designed AEMFC using N–C–CoOx as the cathode catalyst was very close to meet the 2025 milestone set for AEMFCs suggested by the DOE (1 W cm−2 at 0.65 V with a total PM loading < 0.125 mg cm−2 under H2/CO2-free air).37 By surpassing the PPD of 1.0 W cm−2 (Fig. 5b and c) under H2/O2 operating conditions, this work made a breakthrough by applying the PM-free oxide-based cathode in AEMFCs. The AEMFC with N–C–CoOx as the cathode electrocatalyst also showed satisfactory stability after 100 h operating at 600 mA cm−2 with a voltage loss of 15% (Fig. 5d).

4.1.2 Manganese oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Manganese oxides are one of the most widely studied classes of low-cost TMO materials for the ORR in an alkaline environment. MnOx with various multivalent polymorphs, and nonstoichiometric MnOx with multiple active sites have shown great potential for the electrochemical ORR.157,179–182 The observed catalytic activity of MnOx has been postulated in the literature to originate from the redox between Mn species, which assist the charge transfer to adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface.183,184 Previous attempts to explore the catalytic behaviors of MnOx-based catalysts in alkaline media have revealed that MnO2 is particularly efficient for the electrocatalytic ORR.183,185 Mao et al. proposed that the ORR mechanism on MnOx oxides follows a 4e− reaction pathway.184 Additionally, as initial battery materials, manganese oxides are particularly efficient for conducting and transporting charge carriers in a short time, and this a process, known as the “flywheel” effect, can be beneficial when they are used as the electrode material in fuel cells, as explained by Vondrák et al.186 The ORR catalytic activity of one-dimensional MnO2 with various crystallographic structures was studied, and it was found that the ORR proceeds through an apparent 4e− reduction pathway of O2 on the MnO2 surface.187,188
α-MnO2 was reported to show more obvious advantages than β-MnO2 and γ-MnO2 phases. α-MnO2 has the largest tunnel size among the three phases, which gives more defects and –OH groups to favor the insertion and transfer of ions. These unique structural properties are beneficial for the surface adsorption of O2 and the dissociation of O–O bonds.185 Kenko et al. synthesized two types of Mn hollandite oxides (labelled as KMO-HT and KMO-CP) through a hydrothermal method (HT) and a traditional co-precipitation (CP) method, respectively.158 The as-prepared KMO-HT exhibited a high onset potential for the ORR (ca. 0.9 V vs. RHE), and high efficiency for 4e− reduction of around 90%. The AEMFC performance with KMO-HT exhibited a PPD of around 49 mW cm−2. Ng et al. prepared MnOx nanoparticles and integrated them onto glassy carbon (GC) particles, which are more resistant to heat and corrosion than conventional carbon supports with high specific surface areas.162 The as-prepared MnOx–GC particles were found to be easily loaded onto a carbon paper substrate via conventional techniques such as spraying or painting to form a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) in an AEMFC. The MnOx–GC particles displayed high activity for the ORR in alkaline electrolyte, proceeding via a pseudo 4e− ORR pathway, and the accelerated durability test revealed excellent stability of the MnOx–GC catalyst, maintaining nearly 60% of its activity after 30000 cyclic voltammograms. The performance of MnOx–GC as a cathode incorporated into an AEMFC achieved a PPD of 98 mW cm−2 with an H2/O2 gas feed, demonstrating the viability of MnOx for electrode reactions in fuel cell devices.
Recently, Speck et al. investigated the stability of four types of Mn oxide allotropes using on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to monitor the Mn dissolution rate under the ORR conditions.189 By investigating the dissolution profiles of Mn for different manganese oxides over time, they found that the total dissolved amount from β-MnO2 and α-MnO2. α-Mn2O3 is more stable in the presence of H2O2. Shi et al. recently fabricated an AEMFC with non-stoichiometric α-MnO2 NRs as the cathode catalysts, and thoroughly studied the influence of the electrode design parameters, including the ratio of carbon, ionomer content, and catalyst loading with the in-cell performance.160 The Taguchi design method applied in this work helped to explain the influence of the ionomer content in the α-MnO2 catalyst layer on the AEMFC power output. The optimized AEMFC with the α-MnO2 cathode could only achieve a PPD of around 45 mW cm−2 under the specific MEA conditions, which highlights the significant role of anion exchange materials applied in AEMFCs in the final cell performance. Since the durability of the electrocatalyst is one of the major obstacles for the commercialization of AEMFCs, Arunchander et al. reported a two-step synthetic method for the fabrication of a hybrid electrocatalyst with MnO nanoparticles fabricated in the nitrogen-doped graphene (MnO/NG) to enhance the catalytic stability of MnO in alkaline media.161 Despite the inferior performance delivered in a single AEMFC, the optimized MnO/NG electrocatalyst (annealed at 900 °C) retained good ORR activity after being subjected to 10000 continuous potential cycles between −0.8 and 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in O2-saturated alkaline electrolyte. The enhanced durability of the MnO/NG electrocatalyst compared with Pt/C was thought to be attributed to the stable NG support, which provided a strengthened metal–support interaction to prevent the detachment of the oxide nanoparticles.
Meanwhile, the electronic conductivity of manganese oxides is of great concern for achieving high activity for electrode reactions in AEMFC devices. The resistance of the catalyst layers is required to be comparable or even lower than that of AEMs (2–10 Ω cm−2).1 Composite structures of Mn oxides with metals (Ni etc.) and carbon materials have been proposed not only to introduce an additional interface to facilitate the catalytic process, but also provide high electrical conductivity of the bulk material. For example, when MnO2 NWs were coated with a thin carbon shell, the electrical conductivity of α-MnO2 was reported to increase by five orders of magnitude from 3.2 × 10−6 to 0.52 S cm−1 for the carbon-coated MnO2.190 Fu et al. prepared 3D structural Ni-modified MnO NPs supported on a porous graphene aerogel (Ni–MnO/rGO).191 The as-synthesized electrocatalyst showed an E1/2 potential of 0.78 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 0.94 V vs. RHE in the RDE measurements. Furthermore, the as-prepared Ni–MnO/rGO aerogel showed higher electrical conductivity and lower HO2− yield compared with its MnO/rGO and Ni/rGO counterparts, indicating the potential higher activity and stability owing to the synergetic effect between the MnO and Ni phases.


4.1.3 Bifunctional cobalt and manganese oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Transition metal cations (Co and Mn) in metal oxides have also been reported to serve as effective bifunctional sites for both the ORR and OER in an alkaline environment depending on the potential applied, thus making them excellent electrode materials in UR-AEMFCs.192–194 Besides the mechanical cooperation of two mono-functional ORR and OER components to obtain bifunctional electrocatalysts,195–197 these designable oxides provide an opportunity to realize dual functions through a simpler synthesis process. The bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts is related to the interactions between the intermediates and the active sites. Numerous efforts have been conducted to find correlations between the adsorption energy and different oxygen-containing groups on the surface of various types of oxides.58,95,198,199 More recently, Co and Mn oxide-based electrocatalysts have received increasing attention as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts, with a total overpotential of less than 0.9 V, thus showing great potential for applications in (UR-)AEMFCs and rechargeable metal–air batteries. Man et al. calculated the binding energies of HO* and HOO* on the surface of various oxides by using standard density functional theory (DFT), and demonstrated the “volcano plot” between the binding energies with the theoretical overpotentials of OER.193 The concentration of oxygen vacancies and the oxidation state with metal cations were also demonstrated to inevitably affect the ORR/OER activity of oxide-based materials.200 The scaling relationships are highly dependent on the oxide compositions and electronic structures, resulting in different shapes of volcano plots. Therefore, employing appropriate design regulations with oxide-based bifunctional electrocatalysts is promising to minimize the overpotentials for both the ORR and OER, and to shed light on parameters that will consequently result in high oxygen electrocatalysis activity and stability in fuel cells.
CoOx-based materials have been demonstrated to show efficient OER catalytic activity.202,203 Mao et al. reported a high-performing bifunctional catalyst composed of 3D crumpled N–graphene (N–CG) and cobalt oxides (N–CG–CoO).204 The 3D hollow graphene structure is highly valuable to offer a large surface area and stable anchoring sites for CoO nanocrystals, which can enable the full use of surface active sites by minimizing the agglomeration/restacking of graphene sheets. The well-designed N–CG–CoO hybrid catalyst exhibited good bifunctional catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte. The unique 3D and hollow structure of graphene offered a large surface area to fix the CoO nanocrystals, and meanwhile alleviated the collapse of the graphene support. Consequently, the durability test of N–CG–CoO showed a slight decay of 12% in ORR activity after 20000 s of continuous operation at 0.75 V vs. RHE, whereas the Pt/C catalyst exhibited up to 41% decrease in activity. The OER durability test results under high potentials were also satisfactory with the N–CG–CoO hybrid, showing only 13% activity loss after 7,000 s potential hold at 1.55 V vs. RHE. Tong et al. reported a strongly coupled hybrid catalyst composed of CoOx nanoparticles with abundant surface oxygen vacancies supported on B,N-decorated graphene (CoOx NPs/BNG), as shown in Fig. 6a and b.201 By using advanced spectroscopic techniques, the formation of rich oxygen vacancies was confirmed, and a strong Co–N–C bond was confirmed in the CoOx NP/BNG composites. The hybrid electrocatalyst was highly efficient for the OER in alkaline solution with a low potential of ∼1.525 V vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10). Also, it presented a good ORR performance with a positive E1/2 of 0.805 V vs. RHE approaching that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 6c). Huang et al. reported a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon-supported clustered CoOx catalyst (CoOx/NMC).156 The overall oxygen electrode activity reflected by the parameter ΔE between E1/2 of the ORR and Ej=10 for the OER was found to be only 0.592 V with CoOx/NMC compared with the Pt/C- and Ir/C-coupled bifunctional electrocatalysts (ΔE = 0.693 V vs. RHE), indicating the superior bifunctionality of CoOx/NMC composites as advanced electrode catalysts for UR-AEMFCs.

Zhang et al. synthesized a bamboo-shaped N-doped carbon nanotube-supported Co/CoOx composite through a self-generated method and studied the ORR/OER mechanism on the surface of CoOx.207 The as-synthesized Co/CoOx@BS-NCNT composite exhibited an E1/2 of 0.842 V vs. RHE for ORR, which is mainly attributed to the enriched coordination-unsaturated Co2+ in the CoOx structure featuring high electrical conductivity. The enhanced OER kinetics on CoOx was attributed to the lattice oxygen in CoOx, which promoted the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ to form the Co3+–OH transition species, which augmented the adsorption of OH− species on the active sites and expedited the oxidation of OH− species to improve the evolution of O2.
Bifunctional oxygen catalysis on the surface of Mn oxides has also attracted research interest. Previous theoretical analysis has demonstrated the potential OER activity on the surface of Mn oxides.214 The multivalent properties of Mn oxides and their unique surface structures enable them to provide active sites for the ORR/OER reversible reaction pair, although their overall performance is still inferior to that of Co oxides, as presented in Table 2. The total overpotential between the E1/2 of the ORR and the Ej=10 of the OER is calculated to reflect the intrinsic bifunctional activity of these oxide-based electrocatalysts in alkaline solution. Gorlin et al. prepared MnOx thin films via the electro-deposition method and compared their ORR/OER activity with that of PM electrocatalysts in alkaline solution, as shown in Fig. 7a and b.192 The prepared MnOx thin film was found to be more active for the ORR than both the Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts, and showed only a small gap of ∼130 mV in terms of the E1/2 for the ORR compared with Pt/C. The OER activity of MnOx was superior to that of Pt/C and approached that of Ir/C and Ru/C. Selvakumar et al. prepared a series of α-MnO2 with different shapes (NWs, NTs and NPs), and investigated the effect of morphology on their catalytic performance for the ORR and OER in alkaline media.215 It was found that both α-MnO2 NWs and NTs are capable of executing 4e− oxygen reduction on a single catalytic site due to their nano-geometry effect. Among the three α-MnO2 shapes, the NWs showed the best performance, which is possibly owing to the affinity of the (310) crystallographic planes for water molecules. DFT calculations also proved that the reaction interface of α-MnO2 NWs could facilitate the adsorption of reactants.

Meng et al. also studied the electrocatalytic activities on MnOx oxides with different crystalline structures (Fig. 7c),212 and demonstrated the potential high bifunctional activity of α-MnO2 compared with other structures, including amorphous Mn oxide, β-MnO2, and δ-MnO2 (Fig. 7d and e). These combined results showed that the electrocatalytic activities are strongly dependent on the crystalline structures of the oxide, which follow the order of α-MnO2 > amorphous > β-MnO2 > δ-MnO2. The outstanding ORR activity of α-MnO2 is likely due to its strongest O2 adsorption capability, as suggested by the temperature-programmed desorption characterization, while the superior OER activity was attributed to the abundant bridges existing in the α-MnO2 phase as effective protonation sites.
Ng et al. fabricated an oxygen electrode for UR-AEMFC with carbon-free, PM-free MnOx oxides deposited on a stainless steel (SS) substrate.159 The MEA in this UR-AEMFC single cell consisted of a commercial AEM placed between the MnOx-SS oxygen electrode and the Pt/C hydrogen electrode. The PPD attained in the first cycle with the FC mode was 27 mW cm−2 and a round-trip (RT) efficiency of 45% to 42% over 10 switch cycles was observed in this work. They also proposed a PM-free UR-AEMFC prototype in 2013.162 Coupled with PM-free Ni/C as the anode electrocatalyst, they employed a mixture of Ni/C and glassy carbon-supported manganese oxide (MnOx/GC) as the cathode electrocatalyst. A new synthetic route via the impregnation of Mn ions on the surface of heat-tolerant GC particles was introduced for the successful synthesis of MnOx NPs. The performance and durability of this PM-free UR-AEMFC is shown in Fig. 8. The initial FC performance with MnOx/GC as the cathode catalyst was 16.5 mW cm−2, while subsequent power output loss was observed after the first cycle, presenting an RT efficiency of 40%. After cycling the cell between EC and FC modes for 8 cycles, the performance degraded, as shown in Fig. 8b–d. In detail, the PPD in the FC mode decreased from 10.8 to 7.2 mW cm−2, and the current density in the EC mode at high potential decreased from 17.7 to 13 mA cm−2, while the RT efficiency decreased slightly from 40% to 34%. Despite the inferior performance, this is the first UR-AEMFC prototype to be reported, which completely gets rid of PM electrocatalysts.

4.2 Multimetal oxide-based electrocatalysts

4.2.1 Perovskite oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Perovskite oxides with the merits of low cost, excellent ionic conductivity, overall resistance to corrosion and controllable surface properties have been recognized as promising candidates for electrocatalysis, especially in an alkaline environment, exhibiting high activity and reasonable stability.77,216–218 In general, the structures of perovskite oxides, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals are distributed in the A-site, and transition metals occupy the B-site, as illustrated in Fig. 9a. In recent years, research interests have been focused on tuning the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides by developing structures with various A- and B-site metal compositions. The modification of the B site by doping different transition metals can play an important role in determining the catalytic activity by generating oxygen vacancies and optimizing the valence state. Calculation results have shown that the binding energies of the adsorbates can be modified to enhance the ORR catalytic activity of these oxides.219 The catalytic activity of perovskite oxides for the ORR has been reported to depend on the orbital filling (eg) of the B-site cation, as proposed by Suntivich et al. (shown in Fig. 9b with a volcano plot).76,77 The eg band represents the filling of the d-electrons of the B-site cation in the anti-bonding orbitals, which interact strongly with the O-2pσ orbitals. The interaction mainly affects the adsorption of reactants on the surface of transition metals, thereby influencing the RDS rate of O22−/OH− displacement or OH− regeneration in the ORR process. It has been suggested that an eg value of ∼1, as observed in LaMnO3 and LaNiO3, renders an excellent surface oxidation state for the ORR using perovskites. Sunarso et al. studied the ORR activity of the thin-film electrodes prepared with these perovskite oxides under RDE measurements.220 As shown in Fig. 9c, the voltammograms obtained for the ORR in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH revealed that among LaNiO3, LaCoO3, LaFeO3, LaMnO3, and LaCrO3 oxide catalysts, LaCoO3 exhibited the largest diffusion-limited current density in the ORR, followed by LaMnO3, LaNiO3, LaFeO3 and LaCrO3 in a decreasing order. Partially substituting the B-site Ni metal with other metals, such as Co, Fe, Mn, and Cr, as shown in Fig. 9d, can make the onset potentials for the ORR shift more positively, suggesting enhanced ORR catalytic kinetics with an optimized B-site metal composition in perovskite oxides.

LSV curves were all measured in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Adapted from ref. 220 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
The eg filling state is widely used as a descriptor to indicate the oxygen binding and intermediate binding in the design of highly-active catalytic sites with oxide catalysts. In addition, the electronic and ionic conductivities of these oxides can be tuned to minimize the ohmic loss in electrochemical systems. Electronic conduction in these oxides is shown to occur through the B-site network via the oxygen bridge.128 Oxygen bulk diffusion in perovskite oxides proceeds via an oxygen vacancy transport mechanism. Thus, one of the criteria in the design of perovskite oxides as efficient electrocatalysts is to enhance the oxygen vacancy concentration. It was found that the substitution of the B-site in LaBO3 could change the expected bulk conductivity between ∼1 μS cm−1 for Fe to ∼1 S cm−1 for Ni, and even higher with that of La1−xSrxMnO3,222,223 which makes them promising candidates for electrode reactions at TPBs in AEMFCs. The oxygen vacancy content in double perovskites at room temperature has been found to be linearly correlated to the size difference between the A-site cations.224,225 In the case of A-site modification, a decrease in the activity for the ORR was observed in LnMnO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y, Dy, Yb, etc.) as the A-site metal changed from La to Yb.226 Wang et al. studied the ORR activity of a series of ABO3 perovskites, RNiO3 (R = La, La0.5Nd0.5, La0.2Nd0.8, Nd, Nd0.5Sm0.5, Sm and Gd) with controlled A-site substitutions and found that the ORR activity decreased monotonically with a decrease in the A-site element ionic radius, which resulted in a lower conductivity in the electrode films. LaNiO3 still exhibited the best conductivity and ORR activity among the tested oxide materials.225
Besides tuning the A-site or B-site composition in perovskite oxides to obtain desirable catalytic activity, functional carbon materials have been introduced to improve the electrical conductivity of these oxide materials, as well as facilitate the catalytic reaction with a synergetic effect. Instead of physical mixing of oxide and carbon, the creation of an interface by fabricating oxide–carbon hybrids can change the electronic/crystal structure of perovskite oxides by altering the oxidation state of the transition metals in the perovskite structure, thus affecting the catalytic mechanism and performance on the surface of perovskite oxides.134 Li et al. studied the ORR catalytic activity and mechanism of LaMnO3/C hybrids with different oxide loadings. The hybrid catalyst with 100 wt% LaMnO3 loading showed the highest electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution, exhibiting an E1/2 of 0.82 V vs. RHE for the ORR in RDE measurements. It was found that the hybrid with more C–O–Mn bonds displayed a lower activation energy and higher ORR kinetic rate. Besides the high ORR activity, the LaMnO3/C catalyst exhibited long-term durability of over 10000 s constant potential hold at 0.75 V (vs. RHE), with only a small current decay of less than 10%.227
Great progress has been made with perovskite electrocatalysts showing satisfactory ORR activity under RDE measurements in alkaline electrolyte; however, most of them have not been successfully transitioned to application in real AEMFCs due to the inability or high difficulty in fabricating electrodes with sufficient mass transport, porosity, electronic conductivity, and catalyst layer (CL) thickness. La1−xSrxMnO3, a typical cathode material in SOFCs, has been explored as an active cathode catalyst for the ORR at room temperature in alkaline media due to its relatively high electrical conductivity and good affinity with oxygen molecules.228 Saito et al. synthesized a 20 wt% low-loading La0.83Sr0.17MnO3/KB (LS0.17M/KB) electrocatalyst via a modified reverse micelle method. The high dispersity of LS0.17M nanoparticles on KB support enabled a catalyst with higher ORR activity compared with that of the 45 wt% high-loading LS0.23M/KB prepared via the co-precipitation method. The single AEMFC applying LS0.17M/KB as a cathode catalyst gave a maximum power density of 129 mW cm−2, which was comparable to that with of the conventional 46 wt% Pt/C as the cathode catalyst (exhibiting a PPD of 138 mWcm−2) under the same operating conditions.229 Recently, Dzara et al. reported the first account of La and Al co-doped CaMnO3 perovskite integrated into an AEMFC.20 The morphology of Ca0.9La0.1Al0.1Mn0.9O3−δ (CLAM) calcined at 800 °C showed the most heterogeneous Ca dispersion and regular NP shape and surface composition. By compositing the as-prepared CLAM with the Vulcan carbon support at a mass ratio of 30:70 and integrating it into the cathode of an AEMFC, the cell delivered a PPD of ∼30 mW cm−2, which was further improved by changing the carbon support to N-doped Vulcan carbon. Doubling the catalyst loading on the cathode led to an increase in the PPD value to 76 mW cm−2. This work highlighted that the continuous optimization of the CL and MEA structure is beneficial for the power outputs with perovskite oxides in AEMFCs.


4.2.2 Spinel oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
The general formula for spinel structure oxides is AB2O4, in which the A and B cations are typically transition metals with charges of +2 or +3 and are arranged in a cubic close-packed lattice.230 Spinel structures have been explored as efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR mainly because of their mixed valence. Co3O4 is the simplest spinel oxide that has been explored for the ORR in early research work. Although Co3O4 showed low catalytic activity, researchers have found that substitution of Co3O4 with Zn, Ni, Cu, and Mn can greatly enhance its catalytic activity and stability as an electrocatalyst for the ORR in an alkaline environment.231 MnCo2O4 is a type of mixed valence oxide with a spinel structure, which has shown promising ORR activity in alkaline solution due to its redox-active metal centers.232,233 Liang et al. fabricated MnCo2O4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets via a two-step solvothermal method to obtain MnCo2O4/N-rmGO (Fig. 10a and b) and studied the electrocatalytic ORR activity of this catalyst.21 X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) measurement was conducted to reveal the covalent coupling effect in the MnCo2O4/N-rmGO hybrid system, suggesting the formation of covalent interfacial metal–O–C and metal–N–C bonds in the hybrid. This intimate interaction endowed the oxide nanoparticles with high conductivity and electrocatalytic activity with redox-active centers, which can hardly be realized by the physical mixture of metal oxide nanoparticles and graphene supports. The as-synthesized MnCo2O4/N-rmGO hybrid showed a more positive onset potential for the ORR than the corresponding physical mixture of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles and N-doped graphene sheets, as shown in Fig. 10c. The E1/2 difference between the MnCo2O4/N-rmGO hybrid and Pt/C catalyst was only 20 mV at the same catalyst loading. Additionally, MnCo2O4/N-rmGO exhibited excellent stability, as evaluated by chronoamperometric measurements. The ORR current density of the MnCo2O4/N-rmGO hybrid decreased by only 3.5% over 20000 s continuous operation at a constant voltage of 0.70 V vs. RHE, while a 33% decrease was observed for the Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 10d).

Atomic-level modification has been demonstrated to give rise to substantial chemical and physical properties on the surface of oxides. Ling et al. reported an atomic-level engineering strategy for the radical modification of ZnxCo1−xO NRs and found that the transport of ions and electrons was promoted on the active sites using the modified oxides as electrode materials.234 Toh et al. studied the influence of the metal cation composition in four different types of spinel oxides, namely NiCo2O4, NiMn2O4, ZnCo2O4 and ZnMn2O4 nanocrystals on their catalytic performance for the ORR in alkaline media. The bulk resistance of the obtained spinel oxides was tested by applying the two-point probe method. NiCo2O4 exhibited the lowest resistivity among the tested oxides of only 0.83 kΩ, which was possibly due to the defect formation on the oxide surface and the phase separation in the spinel structure, leading to a population of itinerant charge carriers in the conductive band. RDE measurements in alkaline solution showed that NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4 displayed much more positive reduction onset potentials of −0.147 and −0.239 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively, suggesting advantageous electrocatalytic ORR activity.235 Zhou et al. recently synthesized a series of spinel oxides ZnCoxMn2−xO4 (composition varied with x ranging from 0 to 2) to exclusively investigate the ORR catalytic activity of edge-sharing [TMO6] octahedra. Changes in the Mn/Co ratio were identified as a key factor affecting the ORR behavior of ZnCoxMn2−xO4. The super exchange interactions of Mn–O–Co through the edge-sharing [CoxMn1−xO6] octahedra were demonstrated to result in charge density redistribution via the shared oxygen “edges” in the octahedra network between Mn3+ and Co3+.236
To achieve sufficient mass transport during the ORR process with oxide catalysts, research efforts have also been focused on introducing high-surface area and abundant pores in the catalyst architecture, which aims to enhance the accessibility of the active sites. Lin et al. studied hollow porous spinel AB2O4 microstructures (A = Zn2+ and B = Mn3+ and/or Co3+).237 Among the developed hollow porous spinel oxides, the ZnMnCoO4 microspheres exhibited high ORR activity with the E1/2 of only 50 mV lower than that of the Pt/C catalyst in RDE measurements. In addition, its excellent durability was also proven. It is worth mentioning that a weakened Co3+–OH bond was found in the ZnMnCoO4 microspheres when the low-spin electronic state of Co3+ in Co3O4 transforms to a mix high-spin and low-spin state in the oxide, which facilitates the O2−/OH− displacement in the ORR process.
The unique mixed valences and porous structures of spinel oxide-based electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be beneficial for enhanced catalytic activity and mass transportation, and thus their applications in AEMFCs have also been explored.238–241 Singh et al. applied a scalable microwave irradiation method to achieve the in situ synthesis of N-doped porous graphene (pNGr)-supported CoMn alloy oxide nanoparticles, and employed them to fabricated the cathode electrocatalyst in a single AEMFC with Pt/C as the anode catalyst.22 Microwave irradiation during the synthetic process not only resulted in the formation of the CoMn alloy oxide nanoparticles on the graphene framework, but also created abundant pores for the graphene substrates. The RDE measurements showed that the CoMn/pNGr (Co:Mn ratio of 2:1) catalyst displayed superior ORR performance among the prepared CoMn alloy oxide nanoparticles, with the E1/2 for the ORR of 0.791 V vs. RHE; however, the in-cell performance with MnCo2O4/pNGr (2:1) as the cathode electrocatalyst was not satisfactory. Yang et al. reported a 3d Co–Mn spinel oxide catalyst MnCo2O4 (Fig. 11a) synthesized via a hydrothermal method with different oxide loadings on carbon supports.163 Through the ORR polarization profiles acquired under RDE measurements (Fig. 11b), the obtained Co–Mn spinel oxides with different loadings showed similar ORR activity with high E1/2 potentials of around 0.84 V vs. RHE. In addition, this work highlighted the AEMFC performance with MnCo2O4 by increasing the oxide loading to 80 wt%. A benchmark PPD of 1.2 W cm−2 was obtained under H2/O2 and 80 °C operating conditions (Fig. 11d), indicating the potential value of Co–Mn spinel oxides for the cathode reaction in AEMFCs compared with PM-based electrocatalysts. By optimizing the oxide loading to 0.8 mg cm−2 in the cathode, the CL thickness could be reduced to 8 μm, which was reported to be beneficial for water management in the electrode. In addition, the porosity features, as presented in the STEM image (Fig. 11c), were further measured by the N2 adsorption–desorption method. The enhanced cell performance was also likely to originate from the appropriate pore structures, namely 1.9 nm micropores and 4.0 nm mesopores in the electrode, which facilitated the mass transportation in the TPBs.

The same group also reported a rock-salt-type Mn–Co oxide (MnCo2O3/C) originating from the spinel-type precursor material MnCo2O4/C through mild reduction by NH3 at a relatively low temperature.242 The as-synthesized Mn–Co oxide catalyst exhibited an excellent E1/2 of 0.86 V vs. RHE for the ORR in alkaline electrolyte. The as-prepared MnCo2O3/C was found to reach the same diffusion-limited current density (−3.6 mA cm−2) as the Pt/C catalyst, suggesting a 4e− process of reducing O2 completely to H2O. The electron microscopic and spectroscopic characterization also suggested that the high catalytic performance was possibly due to the rational design of the microstructure and the synergistic active sites of Mn and Co. It should be noted that the catalytic activities were preliminarily evaluated by RDE measurements and a more realistic in-cell performance is still under investigation.


4.2.3 Bifunctional perovskite and spinel oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Through the rational design of active sites on the surface of perovskite and spinel oxides, they have emerged as efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media, thus making them suitable for application in UR-AEMFCs.243 Similarly, the modification of the A- or B-site in perovskites has been investigated as an effective way to create surface oxygen vacancies and change their valence states. Perovskites with the general ABO3 formula, such as LaNiO3 and LaCoO3, have been identified to show bifunctional catalytic activity for the ORR/OER in alkaline solution. It has been found that Ni- and Co-based perovskites exhibit promising bifunctional activity because of their intermediate spin states, leading to appropriate overlap between the molecular orbitals of their cations and the oxygenated species. Their catalytic activities can be controlled by changing the composition of their metals or optimizing their morphology.244,245 Suntivich et al. proposed that the potentially high catalytic activities of LaMnO3 and LaCoO3 oxides are attributed to the unity eg orbital filling to facilitate the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates participating in the rate determining steps in the ORR and OER, respectively.76 Partial substitution of the A- and/or B-site metal cations in perovskites to fabricate various  (A and A′ are from rare-earth or alkaline-earth metals and B and B' are from transition metals) oxide catalysts has been widely studied to achieve enhanced bifunctional ORR/OER activity.
A-site doping has been used as an efficient way to tune the concentration of oxygen vacancies with oxides, thus benefiting the OER activity in alkaline media.246–250 Xu et al. reported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 NPs prepared through a solution method, which showed enhanced OER activity and maintained high ORR activity.249 The well-designed perovskite oxide featured both A-site deficiency and surface oxygen vacancy when the concentration of A-site metal ions was reduced. Surface oxygen vacancies are an ideal characteristic for the OER since they can attract OH− in alkaline media. The promising OER performance was demonstrated with Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF), showing a much higher performance than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts.77 Bu et al. recently prepared various mesoporous nanofibers of different cation-ordered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−xFexO5+δ (x in the range of 0 to 2) perovskites via a mild electrospinning method.200 The high amount of Pr substitution with the A-site metal cation and the large surface area of mesoporous nanofiber structure resulted in promising bifunctional catalytic activity in the obtained oxides. Although the optimized PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−xFexO5+δ oxide exhibited a moderate ORR performance in 0.1 M KOH solution with an E1/2 of ∼0.73 V vs. RHE, excellent OER catalytic activity of 9 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art IrO2 was achieved, with the Ej=10 of 1.53 V vs. RHE under RDE measurements.
The modification of the B-site in perovskites is another way in current work to improve the ORR/OER activity.251,252 The optimized interaction between the B-site cations and oxygen species can be achieved through control of the B-site composition to promote the ORR/OER kinetics on the interface of the active sites. Lopez et al. prepared a series of LaMO3 (M = Co, Fe, Ni, and Mn) oxides through a sol–gel method and reported the best performance with the LaCoO3 oxide.253 Changing the B-site valence state in perovskites not only can promote the formation of B–OH in the electrocatalytic reaction by introducing extra active sites, but also increase the electrical conductivity of the bulk oxides. Wang et al. reported an efficient spray impregnation method for the preparation of a multitude of homogeneous La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3−σ (LSCF) NPs.254 The optimized B-site cations provided a highly active surface. In addition, the modified LSCF cathode manifested an area-specific electrical resistance (ASR) of ∼0.140 Ω cm2, which is only a fifth of that of the pristine LSCF cathode (∼0.764 Ω cm2). Wang et al. utilized a polymer-assisted method to prepare LaCo1−xNixO3 nanostructures and proved again that the contribution of the synergistic effect between the two metal ions in the B-site can benefit the adsorption of O on the Co active sites, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR and OER.34 The as-prepared LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3 exhibited a much higher total overpotential of 0.88 V compared with that of the LaCoO3 catalyst (1.04 V) in alkaline solution.
Compositing perovskite oxide structure with carbon materials has been developed as an important design concept to boost the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides in (UR-)AEMFCs. Heteroatom-doped (such as N, S, B and P) carbon materials, especially N-doped carbon have been extensively studied as a component in perovskite–carbon hybrids, which can provide additional active sites to facilitate the ORR.255–258 For example, LaNiO3@NCNT with a core-corona structure was reported as a high-performing bifunctional catalyst, where LaNiO3 was selected to provide highly-efficient OER active sites, and meanwhile serve as a support material for the ORR-active component NCNT.259 Excellent ORR activity was demonstrated with LaNiO3@NCNT, showing an E1/2 potential for the ORR very similar to that of commercial Pt/C, and 5.8 times higher current density (at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) than its LaNiO3 counterpart. In the case of oxide-based carbon composite materials, compared to the ORR, their electrocatalysis durability for the OER is more challenging due to the extremely oxidative conditions at high potentials (>1.4 V vs. RHE), and thus the stability of carbon-based electrocatalysts is significant. A full-range cyclic voltammetry degradation test was conducted, and it was found that LaNiO3@NCNT exhibited 3 and 13 times higher stability for the ORR and OER compared with Pt/C, demonstrating the homogeneous dispersion of NCNT on LaNiO3 with strong interaction as one entity increased the catalyst stability.
The bifunctional ORR/OER activity of recently reported perovskite and spinel oxide-based electrocatalysts is presented in Table 3. Most of the reported perovskite oxides actually show promising activity for the OER with Ej=10 less than 1.7 V vs. RHE, while the ORR activity of perovskite oxides in most cases is not excellent, normally with an E1/2 of less than 0.7 V, thus leading to a generally higher total overpotential in the range of 0.8–1.1 V for bifunctional OER and ORR in alkaline solution. In contrast, spinel oxides, seem to show much better ORR activity than perovskite oxides, simultaneously maintain similar OER performances, thus exhibiting comprehensively better bifunctional activity.

Among the spinel oxides, cobaltite (e.g., Co3O4 and NiCo2O4) has received the most attention since is generally shows high activity.231,267,274–277 The bifunctional activity of Co3O4 for both the ORR and OER may stem from the active tetrahedral-site Co2+ and the octahedral-site Co3+, respectively. To obtain high surface activity, the morphology of spinel oxides can be controlled using various synthetic strategies.248,278 Devaguptapu et al. reported the synthesis of a flowerlike carbon-free NiCo2O4 catalyst via a soft template method.267 This morphology-controlling approach provided an effective way to create a robust 3D architecture with a larger surface area and enhanced mass transfer. The carbon-free NiCo2O4 exhibited an exceptional onset potential and E1/2 for the ORR of 0.94 and 0.82 V vs. RHE, respectively. Excellent OER activity was also observed with an overpotential of ∼350 mV when generating a current density of 10 mA cm−2. After up to 20000 cycles in the durability test in a wide potential window (0–1.9 V), the current density generated at 1.6 V vs. RHE with the NiCo2O4 catalyst even showed a 20% increase, while a loss of 40% was observed after only 10000 cycles with a Pt–Ir catalyst. Yang et al. deposited NixCo3−xO4 nanocrystals on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) wrapped by pyridine-based polybenzimidazole (PyPBI) through a solvothermal method to form uniform hybrid catalysts.268 The PyPBI layer on the nanotubes provided well-dispersed binding sites, which coordinated with the transition metal cations (Co2+ and Ni2+) during the synthesis. The as-prepared MWNT–PyPBI–NixCo3−xO4 outperformed most of the PM-free bifunctional electrocatalysts with a total overpotential of ∼0.72 V for the ORR/OER in alkaline solution. By incorporating Ni into the A-site, NiCo2O4 was found to exhibit higher electrical conductivity than pure Co3O4, which was also beneficial for the electrocatalytic activity.279 Among the spinel oxides, MFe2O4 (M = Co, Mn, and Ni) has been reported as a group of attractive structures, in which oxygen forms a face-centered cubic (fcc) close packing structure, where one half of the octahedral sites and one eighth of the tetrahedral interstices are occupied by cations.280 Si et al. recently reported promising bifunctional activity towards both the ORR and OER using a CoFe2O4 oxide catalyst.272 The relatively higher concentration of O22−/O− species in CoFe2O4 was thought to be beneficial for the OER activity. Additionally, the existence of defect sites with a low oxygen coordination indicated strong O2 adsorption during the ORR.
Other binary cobalt-based spinel oxides such as CuxCo3−xO4 and MnxCo3−xO4 have also been reported to show high ORR and OER activities. Jin et al. recently reported an excellent catalytic performance and outstanding stability for both the OER and ORR using CuxCo3−xO4/C spinel nanomaterials,281 presenting a low overpotential of 0.358 V for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and positive E1/2 of 0.82 V vs. RHE in alkaline solution. The chronoamperometry test conducted under a constant voltage of 0.7 V vs. RHE for 12000 s showed that the CuxCo3−xO4/C catalyst exhibited a small decrease of 5.36% with an increase in the current density, whereas the Pt/C catalyst showed nearly 22.73% loss after the stability test. The synergetic effect by compositing with a carbon material has been utilized to achieve better electrocatalytic performances. Wang et al. synthesized an MnCo2O4–graphene hybrid material and demonstrated the strong chemical coupling effect between the oxide nanoparticles with N-doped reduced graphene substrates through covalent bonding, leading to enhanced ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activity in alkaline media.282
Several prototypes of laboratory-prepared UR-AEMFCs have been reported with spinel oxide-based electrocatalysts in terms of their cell performance, efficiency, and stability. Based on the application of a home-made ultra-thin porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and anion exchange ionomer (qPDTB–OH−), a UR-AEMFC fabricated with Cu0.6Mn0.3Co2.1O4 as the bifunctional oxygen cathode catalyst and Pt/C as the anode catalyst was reported to deliver a PPD of 163 mW cm−2 at 45 °C fed with H2/O2.165 The OCV in FC mode was approximately 1.05 V, corresponding to the good ORR activity of the cathode electrocatalyst. The developed UR-AEMFC also showed satisfactory stability when charged at 100 mA cm−2 for nearly 200 h. Although there have been many endeavors to get rid of precious metals in an alkaline environment in UR-AEMFCs, superior in-cell performances of UR-AEMFCs that are comparable to UR-PEMFCs have hardly been achieved with bifunctional oxide-based electrocatalysts, possibly due to the irrational design of the electrode structure and the possible thick catalyst layer, which may not meet the mass transport requirements at high current densities.


4.2.4 Other multimetal oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
The heterojunction structure of mixed metal oxides has been demonstrated to exhibit enhanced performances for oxygen-related heterogeneous thermochemical and electrochemical reactions due to its synergistic advantages.283–285 Although the mechanism for the enhancement of the electrocatalytic reactivity originating from this synergistic effect is still ambiguous because of the randomness of heterojunction structures, many successful cases have been reported. For example, Boettcher et al. studied the electrical conductivity and the electrolyte accessibility of various TMOs and (oxy)hydroxides with the addition of Fe cations, and assessed the activity of mixed-metal Ni–Fe and Co–Fe (oxy)hydroxide catalysts for the OER in alkaline media. It was found that the existence of Fe impurities dramatically enhanced the activity of the Ni and Co-based OER oxide catalysts, which is likely due to the enhanced electrical conductivity and more accessible active sites on their surface.95 Hosseinibenhangi et al. investigated the mixed oxides MnO2–LaCoO3 and MnO2–Nd3IrO7 in conjunction with the alkali-metal ion K+ and verified the improvement of the bifunctional activity due to potential-driven K+ ion insertion in MnO2–LaCoO3 and MnO2–Nd3IrO7.286 The OER overpotentials were lowered by 110 mV and 152 mV at a constant current density of 5 mA cm−2, respectively. For the ORR, the overpotential on the modified MnO2–LaCoO3 was decreased by 75 mV. Yamada et al. recently examined the Fe–Co mixing effects in several perovskite and brownmillerite oxides for OER activity.287 Masa et al. applied a facile strategy to synthesize a series of Fe–Co mixed oxide NPs embedded inside oxidized multi-walled CNTs with a narrow diameter distribution. The proposed mechanism of the tetravalent Fe and Co mixed oxides with enhanced OER activity and stability compared to the parent compounds was demonstrated to be the smaller charge-transfer energies on the active sites, which afforded a lower OER/ORR reversible overpotential of 0.83 V.288 With the optimized molar ratio of Fe:Co (2:3), the mixed oxide catalyst exhibited promising long-term stability with little degradation after 400 OER/ORR cycles.
Metal–metal oxide heterojunction composites have also been explored for electrocatalysis. For example, Wang et al. developed a carbon-supported Co–Fe3O4 hybrid (Co–Fe3O4/C), which was prepared via a two-step reduction method, where the Co precursors were first reduced to Co NPs and Fe3O4 was then deposited on them.164 The Fe2+ cation occupied half of the octahedral sites, and Fe3+ was dispersed on the remaining octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites, forming spinel Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a face-centred cubic structure. The AEMFC fabricated with Co–Fe3O4/C exhibited an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.85 V and a PPD of 114 mW cm−2. Although the power density of the AEMFC was inferior to that with a Pt/C catalyst, Co–Fe3O4/C showed a promising performance under RDE evaluation by undergoing a four-electron reaction pathway for the ORR and exhibiting good stability with a current retention of approximately 99% after 10000 s at 0.76 V (vs. RHE).
The flexibility in the design of PM-free oxide materials endows oxide-based catalysts with large diversity in their surface properties and catalytic activities. Dresp et al. recently classified a series of bifunctional monometallic and bimetallic oxides in terms of a synoptic overpotential diagram, as shown in Fig. 12a.289 Ni(OH)2 was highly valued for the OER process with ppm-level Fe contamination in the alkaline electrolyte, exhibiting an overpotential of 300 ± 3 mV at 1 mA cm−2 for the OER. The Mn–Co oxides were demonstrated to exhibit promising ORR overpotentials of 597 ± 7 mV for Mn31Co69/C and 617 ± 3 mV for Mn61Co39/C at a current density of −3 mA cm−2 due to the synergetic effect. In accordance with the ORR mass activity measured at 0.8 V vs. RHE and the OER activity at 1.53 V vs. RHE (Fig. 12b), despite of the inferior ORR activity with Mn–Co oxide materials, they still exhibited the most promising bifunctional performance among the studied oxides.

A bifunctional Co3O4/Co2MnO4 nanocomposite was fabricated with a highly OER-active Co3O4 component and a highly ORR-active Co2MnO4 component. The well dispersed nature of the two components in the composite structure was reported to result in a synergistic enhancement of the activities for both the OER and ORR with the catalyst.59 These examples reflect the possible positive role of the synergetic effect in the design of mixed metal oxide-based electrocatalysts, which are expected to be promising candidates for electrode reactions in (UR-)AEMFCs.

5. Conclusion, challenges and perspectives
Herein, we provided a comprehensive overview of the recent progress achieved for oxide-based PM-free electrocatalysts designed for electrode reactions in (UR-)AEMFCs. As discussed, PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts have become promising oxygen electrode candidates in (UR-)AEMFCs. One of the primary reasons for this is their low-cost and abundance in the earth. Secondly, their multivalent nature, unique surface properties and structural diversity lead to a wide space to achieve efficient and desirable catalytic sites for the ORR and/or OER in alkaline media. In addition, the heterojunction structures of oxides with various functional carbon materials result in boosted catalytic activity and electrical conductivity due to the synergetic effect, thus making them available for the electrode reactions in (UR-)AEMFCs.
Single metal oxide (mainly TMO)-based materials have been demonstrated to be excellent electrocatalysts for the ORR and/or OER in alkaline media. The AEMFCs employing Mn and Co oxides as cathode catalysts have exhibited quite good performances and stability. Cobalt oxides have been proven to be efficient ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline media, with Co3+ acting as the donor–acceptor reduction site due to its ability to capture electrons and provide electrons to oxygen in solution. An AEMFC fabricated with N–C–CoOx as the cathode electrocatalyst was reported to achieve a PPD of 1.05 W cm−2 and showed good stability over 100 h constant operation at 600 mA cm−2. In particular, the multivalent properties and unique surface structures of MnOx and CoOx oxides enable them to provide highly active and stable sites for the reversible ORR/OER pair in UR-AEMFCs. A bifunctional oxygen electrode was successfully prepared via the catalyst-coating substrate technique, which was demonstrated to maintain a round trip efficiency of 45% to 42% over ten switch cycles in a single UR-AEMFC.
In addition to single metal oxide-based electrocatalysts, multimetal oxide (e.g., perovskite and spinel oxide)-based materials have been extensively investigated as promising and efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER in alkaline solution. Through the rational design of the metal cation compositions and surface oxygen vacancies of multimetal oxides, they are promising electrode candidates with outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activities for UR-AEMFCs. The AEMFC fabricated with a lanthanide perovskite oxide-based cathode exhibited an in-cell performance of >100 mW cm−2. Although great progress has been made in developing perovskite electrocatalysts with various compositions and structures, unfortunately, the majority of them have only been examined with RDE experiments and have not been successfully transitioned to AEMFCs performance. One possible reason for this is the high difficulty in fabricating perovskite electrodes with high electronic conductivity, sufficient mass transportation, and suitable CL thickness. Spinel oxides containing Co and Mn have been mostly reported to be highly active for the ORR/OER through the rational design of suitable active sites for the donors and acceptors during the reversible reactions of oxygen. A breakthrough was made with a high-loading MnCo2O4/C cathode, achieving a PPD of 1.2 W cm−2 under typical AEMFC operating conditions. The results highlight the impact of cell-level key parameters, such as pore distribution, CL structure and thickness, in achieving desirable performances with oxide-based electrocatalysts.
Although oxide-based electrocatalysts show great potential for application in (UR-)AEMFCs, there are still several challenges remaining, which need to be further investigated. Firstly, the state-of-art AEMFC performance of >1 W cm−2 could only be achieved using one-side of the PM-free electrocatalyst in current works and cannot totally avoid PM catalysts on the other side (commonly the anode side). Reducing the PM loading in AEMFC devices is of great significance for their large-scale commercial applications. In addition, emphasis needs to be placed on understanding the intrinsic mechanism for the HOR in an alkaline environment, which can guide the forward-design of anode electrocatalysts in AEMFCs.
Most of the research activities towards enhancing the performances of AEMFCs have been focused on the design of key components, such as electrocatalysts and AEMs, where to date, only a few publications showed the macroscopic optimization of the electrode structure and comprehensive cell performance.65,290 Half-cell tests, i.e. the typical RDE and RRDE measurements in alkaline electrolyte, have been commonly used to evaluate electrocatalysts for AEMFCs; however, there is insufficient data for in-cell performances that are consistent with the positive progress of catalyst development. The in-cell performance of electrocatalysts is more complicated since it largely depends on the construction of TPBs and CL structures, where sometimes, these two factors are even decisive for the catalytic performance in real cell systems. The design of the CL is actually the construction of TPB regions, where electrons, protons, fuel, and product flow in or out, and thus not only abundant active sites are acquired, but also desirable porosity and microarchitecture are needed to benefit the mass transportation, thus maximizing the performance of the active sites during cell operation. Therefore, the development of electrodes with optimized TPBs and suitable CL structures is still challenging and requires further investigation.
In the last 5 years, the operating factors and cell-level water management have also been considered, with a perspective on understanding how the state-of-art AEMFC (H2/O2 fed) performance of >3 W cm−2 comparable with the PEMFC can be achieved.28 In the AEMFC, water is produced at the anode via the HOR and consumed at the cathode by the ORR during cell operation; meanwhile, water is moved from the cathode to the anode by the electro-osmotic drag effect. For the anode CL, it should either have high water drain capacity or be hydrophobic to prevent water flooding, while the cathode CL needs to be hydrophilic to accept liquid water from the AEM and be able to retain it. It is necessary to provide adequate water to maintain the humidity and cation conductivity of AEM and electrode hydration without flooding or drying the catalyst or gas diffusion layers, both of which will cause serious mass transportation issues in AEMFCs.291 Standard operating conditions need to be explored to fully reflect the intrinsic catalytic activities of electrocatalysts during the polarization curve tests, and thus provide engineering solutions to achieve high-performing AEMFCs with PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts.
Long-term stability tests in AEMFCs with oxide-based electrocatalysts are still lacking in current research work. Actually, to date, limited reports have shown long-term AEMFC performance stability above 300 h, which largely restricts the application scenarios of AEMFCs. The most significant obstacle hindering the longevity of AEMFCs remains the stability of their anion exchange materials. With current progress, AEMFC devices still face severe difficulty for long-term operation at a temperature of >60 °C. Based on improving the chemical stability of the cationic groups of the polymer backbone in the membrane and ionomer, the stability of oxide-based electrocatalysts under real cell operating conditions should be considered in the future design of AEMFCs.
In principle, PM-free oxide-based electrocatalysts as potential replacements for PM-based electrocatalysts provide a good basis for developing cost-effective AEMFC devices. However, despite their compelling merits, further research efforts are highly required for the design of oxide-based electrocatalysts with superior activity, durability and conductivity for AEMFC applications. Synthesis strategies need to be explored to obtain desirable surface properties, tune the dispersion of the active sites, and optimize the surface morphology and pore structure, with the aim of achieving high performances in the electrode reactions. Thus, these remaining challenges still need to be overcome in future work to push the commercialization of this technology.
