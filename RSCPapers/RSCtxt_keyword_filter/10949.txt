    , Accepted 5th October 2022First published on 6th October 2022AbstractTailoring the template structure is attractive for the realization of high-performance poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conducting polymers; however, precious little attention has been paid to the molecular weight effect of templates on the surface energy (γs) of PEDOTs. Herein, on the basis of the represent template of polystyrene sulfonic acid, we demonstrate that increasing the template molecular weight is effective to increase the size of PEDOT-rich domains and thus decrease the γs of PEDOT films, for the first time. After fabrication into organic solar cells with the synthesized PEDOT series as anode interfacial materials (AIMs), we found that PBDB-T:Y6, PM6:Y6, D18-Cl:Y6 and PM6:BTP-ec9 based binary bulk heterojunctions present optimal miscibility and photovoltaic performance (12.96%, 17.21%, 17.30% and 18.19%, respectively) on various AIMs, and the high γs donor (or acceptor) based bulk heterojunction is partial to AIM with high γs. Our results not only highlight the important role of template molecular weight in the regulation of PEDOT γs, but also suggest guidelines to match photoactive bulk heterojunction materials with proper AIMs.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted worldwide attention due to the merits of low cost, mechanical flexibility and ease of large-scale fabrication. Benefiting from the continuous innovations in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) material design, morphological control and device engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs has been pushed to over 19%.1–6 The design of anode interfacial materials (AIMs) is equally important, not only for improving the efficiency of charge collection at the anode interface but also for optimizing the morphology of photoactive BHJs.7–10 Regrettably, the development of AIMs is still far behind.11–13
The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymer, invented in the early 1990s, is still the most frequently utilized AIM in conventional OSCs so far. Recently, surface energy (γs) regulation on PEDOT:PSS AIM using the secondary doping strategy is becoming increasingly popular in the morphological control of BHJs and realizing high performance OSCs.9,14–19 For example, Zhou et al.20 mixed WOx nanoparticles into PEDOT:PSS to improve the γs of the AIM and to optimize the phase separation of BHJs, leading to a significantly enhanced efficiency. Despite progress, effective strategies allowing for a continuous regulation on the γs of PEDOT:PSS for meeting the requirements of various BHJs are still lacking so far.21 Also, the mystery of which AIM is suitable for which state-of-art donor or acceptor is still not fully deciphered.
During the last few decades, great efforts have been devoted to develop novel templates for the chemical synthesis of high-performance PEDOT conducting polymers.22–24 Some of the representative strategies for chemical tailoring of PSS are categorized and summarized in Fig. 1. Even this approach seems to have great potential in obtaining desirable γs, and studies are extremely scarce. It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the template molecular weight (Mw) plays an important role in determining the build-up kinetics of PEDOT complexes and thus the physico-chemical properties.25–28 However, precious little attention has been paid to the template Mw effect on γs (see Fig. 1b). From the point view of guiding the design of high-performance PEDOT-based AIMs, it is highly desirable to establish the relationship between the Mw of templates and the γs of PEDOT conducting polymers.

In this contribution, we are dedicated to elucidating the relationship between the Mw of templates, the γs of PEDOT AIMs and the photovoltaic performance of BHJs. For a start, we selected four batches of PSSs with Mw ranging from 70 to 1000 kDa, by a factor of 14.3, as the model template system to prepare a PEDOT:PSS AIM series. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSSs were systematically characterized regarding the PEDOT polymerization degree, doping level, arrangement and orientation. Furthermore, we correlated the γs of PEDOT:PSSs with their PSS Mws (MPSSW s). Finally, the effect of MPSSW on the OSC performance was discussed in detail based on four kinds of binary BHJs, and a deep understanding of the mechanism of performance variation was provided by BHJ miscibility and device physics analysis.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of PEDOTs
The PEDOT:PSS series was prepared using the oxidative polymerization method (see Fig. 2a). The resultant PEDOT:PSSs were referred to as P-70, P-200, P-500, and P-1000 in terms of their respective MPSSW s. Both the characteristic absorptions of PEDOTn+ (polaron and bipolaron, 700–1300 nm) and PSS (190–300 nm) are observable in all samples (see Fig. 2c), confirming the successful polymerization and doping of PEDOT and formation of PEDOT:PSS polyelectrolyte complexes.

To study the impact of MPSSW on the oxidative polymerization of PEDOT, the products were characterized systematically regarding the polymerization degrees and doping levels of PEDOTs. It is accepted that the precise detection of the polymerization degree of the PEDOT inside the PEDOT:PSS matrix is still a challenge.29 Herein, we adopted UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra to estimate the relative magnitude of the polymerization degree of the as-synthesized PEDOTs.30 This is because the band gap between the highest occupied molecular (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of polythiophene derivatives usually decreases with the elongation of the polymer chain length, leading to a gradual red-shift in the absorption spectrum.10,31–33 Prior to the spectral tests, chemical dedoping experiments were conducted to fully reduce the synthesized PEDOTs from the oxidized (doped) to neutral (dedoped) states with the aim of eliminating the polaronic/bipolaronic orbitals.34Fig. 2d presents the optical characteristics of neutral PEDOTs. The four PEDOTs exhibit essentially the same absorption profiles, suggesting that their HOMO–LUMO bandgaps are nearly the same, i.e. their polymerization degrees are basically the same. To obtain the doping levels of PEDOTs, S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2e, the doublets at binding energies of ≈168 and 165 eV correspond to the sulfur atoms of PSS and PEDOT, respectively.35 By fitting the respective PEDOT peaks, the doping levels of PEDOTs were calculated to be 0.17, 0.16, 0.16 and 0.18 for P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000, respectively. According to the similar polymerization degrees and doping levels, we can state that the template Mw has a negligible effect on the oxidative polymerization of PEDOTs.
In order to further explore the template Mw effect on the formation of a PEDOT ionic complex, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization studies were employed. The AFM height and phase images of PEDOT:PSS films are displayed in Fig. 2f and g, respectively. The granular structures in height and phase images could be regarded as the PEDOT:PSS grains and PEDOT-rich domains, respectively. As expected, the size of PEDOT-rich domains is significantly smaller than that of the PEDOT:PSS grains, reflecting the so-called core–shell configuration of the PEDOT:PSS complex where the hydrophobic PEDOTs are surrounded by a hydrophilic PSS shell (see Fig. 2b). In the AFM height images, we observed that the surface root mean square roughness (RMS) Rq increases monotonically from 1.03 to 1.38 nm with increasing MPSSW, accompanied by an increase in the PEDOT:PSS grain size. In the AFM phase images, we found that the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS becomes more noticeable with increasing MPSSW, as can be seen in the increasing domain size and Rq value. This may be attributed to the increased PSS size that enlarges the sizes of the EDOT:PSS micelle and EDOT precursor core, as evidenced in Fig. S1 and S2.†36 Moreover, we found that the neat PSS films have a very similar phase morphology (see Fig. S3†), further confirming that the enlarged PEDOT-rich domains may be caused by the PSS size effect rather than the increased intrinsic size of PSS. Fig. 2h shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns of PEDOT:PSS films. The reflections of weak signals at about 0.29 and 1.23 Å−1 are assigned to the lamellar stacking (100) of PEDOT:PSS and amorphous halo of PSS, respectively, corresponding to the disordered molecule orientation in the four PEDOT:PSS films.13,37 It means that the molecular packing of PEDOT:PSS has essentially no MPSSW dependence.
2.2 Surficial and optoelectrical properties of PEDOT:PSS films
The total γs values of PEDOT:PSS films were estimated by the surface wettability-based Owens–Wendt method.9,38 As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the water contact angles on the surfaces of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 films are 42.68°, 60.38°, 80.13° and 91.52°, respectively, while the corresponding diiodomethane (DIM) contact angles are 43.14°, 60.13°, 60.42° and 64.79°, respectively. Consequently, the total γs values of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 films are calculated to be 57.32, 42.60, 31.97 and 26.79 mN m−1, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the total γs values of raw PSS materials with an Mw of 70, 200, 500 and 1000 KDa are 69.74, 69.56, 67.27 and 66.67 mN m−1 (see Fig. S4†), respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the corresponding PEDOT:PSS products. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the decrease of PEDOT:PSS γs is directed mainly to the gradual enlargement of the PEDOT core size (see Fig. 2g) rather than to the decrease of PSS shell γs. In order to further examine this speculation, a contact-mode AFM-based nanofriction technique was employed. Fig. 3b shows the probe torsion profile scanning of different PEDOT:PSS films, where the twist angle (ΔTA) represents the microscopic γs of PEDOT:PSS.39 As expected, the ΔTA is strongly PEDOT core size-dependent, with the larger PEDOT core having a lower ΔTA, which is in good agreement with the total γs result.

(b) Schematic representation of the AFM-probe behavior during scanning with an idealized graph of the twist angle (left) and cantilever twist recording during the scanning on PEDOT:PSS films (right). The maximum twist angle (α1) corresponds to the peak in the left graph. After that, the probe moves along the surface and experiences the opposition of the sliding friction force, that is why it twists at a relatively constant angle (α2).39 (c) I–V curves of conductive devices. (d) UPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS films. 
The optical properties of PEDOT:PSS films were evaluated using UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometry. As shown in Fig. S5,† no obvious difference is observed in the transmittance spectra, indicating that altering the MPSSW of the PEDOT:PSS AIM has no remarkable influence on the light input of OSCs. The out-of-plane conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films were measured on a conductive device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Al and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 3c. The film thicknesses of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 are 37, 45, 45 and 48 nm, respectively. As expected, a monotonic increase in conductivity is observed as a function of MPSSW, from 5.65 × 10−6 (P-70) to 6.78 × 10−6 (P-200), to 7.21 × 10−6 (P-500) and 7.48 × 10−6 S cm−1 (P-1000), which corresponds to the gradual increase in the PEDOT domain size. This enhancement in AIM conductivity may be beneficial for minishing the charge transport barrier at the interface between the anode and BHJ.10 The WFs of PEDOT:PSS films were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. 3d. The so-calculated WFs display only a mild variation of about 90 meV, indicating no significant influence of altering MPSSW on the electronic band structure of PEDOT:PSS AIMs. Moreover, a similar phenomenon is observed in cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, as shown in Fig. S6.† This result means that altering the MPSSW of the PEDOT:PSS AIM is expected to have negligible effect on the energy-level alignment at the anode/BHJ interfaces.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance of PM6:Y6-based OSCs
To evaluate the performances of the four PEDOT:PSSs as AIMs in OSCs, conventional photovoltaic devices based on a model BHJ of PM6:Y6 were fabricated. The chemical structures of PM6 and Y6 are illustrated in Fig. 4a. The device architecture is shown in Fig. 4b. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of OSCs with different PEDOT:PSS AIMs and the extracted operating parameters are given in Fig. 4c and Table 1, respectively. Noteworthily, the device performance is found to be strongly dependent on the MPSSW of PEDOT:PSS-based AIMs. With the increase of AIM MPSSW from 70 to 200 and to 500 KDa, the PCE is boosted from 16.38% for P-70 to 16.81% for P-200 and further to 17.21% for the P-500 device. This PCE enhancement comes from the simultaneous increase in the device open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Impressively, the 17.21% PCE is among the highest efficiencies of single-junction PM6:Y6 binary OSCs.40,41 When the AIM MPSSW further increases to 1000 KDa, synchronously decreased Voc, Jsc and FF are obtained, thus lowering the PCE to 16.84% for the P-1000 device. These findings highlight the importance of MPSSW as a crucial factor for high-performance PEDOT:PSS AIMs.

Generally, the γs of underlying AIMs is identified as one of the key factors in dictating the film-formation behavior and the morphological characteristics of photoactive BHJs, and thus the device parameters Voc, Jsc and FF.14,15,42 Herein, we utilized Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ to estimate the miscibility (i.e. the average morphological properties) of the PEDOT:PSS series-based PM6:Y6 BHJs. The χ values were obtained from the equation of , where K is a constant, and γdonor and γacceptor are the γs values of the donor and acceptor, respectively.43–45 Commonly, the smaller the χ, the better the miscibility.46 As shown in Fig. S7 and S8,† the γs values of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000-based PM6 films are 35.99, 36.61, 37.59 and 38.41 mN m−1, respectively, while the γs values of the corresponding Y6 films are 40.12, 39.91, 39.39 and 38.79 mN m−1, respectively. The χ values of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000-based PM6:Y6 blends are calculated to be 11.6 × 10−2, 7.1 × 10−2, 2.1 × 10−2 and 0.095 × 10−2 K, respectively. Obviously, the miscibility of PEDOT:PSS-based PM6:Y6 follows the order of P-1000 > P-500 > P-200 > P-70. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the inferior device performance of P-70 and P-200 can be ascribed to the poor miscibility of their BHJs while the superior device performance of P-500 can be attributed mainly to the superior miscibility of its BHJ. However, the P-1000 device with an ultrahigh miscibility exhibits a medium performance. This may be due to the ultrahigh miscibility that is unfavorable to exciton diffusion and dissociation.46
Moreover, GIWAXS characterization was employed to further investigate the molecular packing in PEDOT:PSS series-based PM6:Y6 films. The detected GIWAXS patterns are included in Fig. 4d. The line-cut profile curves of GIWAXS and the extracted GIWAXS parameters are displayed in Fig. S9 and Table S2,† respectively. As can be seen, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the (010) π–π stacking peak of PM6:Y6 at qxy ≈ 1.70 Å−1 decreases with the decrease in PEDOT:PSS γs. The P-70 based PM6:Y6 film exhibits a (010) π-π stacking peak at qz ≈ 1.696 Å−1 with CCL = 2.15 nm, whereas P-200 based PM6:Y6 shows qz ≈ 1.693 Å−1 with CCL = 2.11 nm, the P-500 based PM6:Y6 shows qz ≈ 1.705 Å−1 with CCL = 2.10 nm, and the P-1000 based PM6:Y6 film shows qz ≈ 1.722 Å−1 with CCL = 2.04 nm. The (100) lamellar stacking displayed an identical tendency (see Fig. 4d, Table S2†). The P-70 based PM6:Y6 film exhibits a (100) lamellar stacking peak at qxy ≈ 0.292 Å−1 with CCL = 5.95 nm, whereas the P-200 based PM6:Y6 shows qxy ≈ 0.291 Å−1 with CCL = 5.71 nm, the P-500 based PM6:Y6 shows qxy ≈ 0.293 Å−1 with CCL = 5.68 nm, and the P-1000 based PM6:Y6 film shows qxy ≈ 0.297 Å−1 with CCL = 4.99 nm. These observations suggest that the crystalline size of PM6:Y6 blends diminishes with the decrease of γs of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer, reflecting that the miscibility of PM6:Y6 has a negative correlation with PEDOT:PSS γs.
In addition, AFM measurements were performed to further detect the morphological properties of PEDOT:PSS series-based PM6:Y6 BHJs. The AFM height and phase images are displayed in Fig. S10† and 4e, respectively. The height image displays that the surface RMS roughness Rq of PM6:Y6 layers decreases monotonically from 0.95 to 0.86 nm, with the decrease of γs of PEDOT:PSS. In the phase images, the domain size of PM6:Y6 exhibits a positive correlation with the γs of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layers. Meanwhile, we observed that the average phase difference Rq decreases from 2.35° to 0.84° with the decrease of γs of PEDOT:PSS. All of these findings indicate that the miscibility of the PM6:Y6 blend increases with the decrease of γs of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer (see Fig. 4f), which in line with the result obtained from χ measurements. It is accepted that the similarity plays a key role in determining the uniformity of the mixtures.47,48 Herein, we evaluated the similarity between PM6 and Y6 with their surface energy difference (Δγs). In the case of the P-70 substrate, the Δγs value was calculated to be 4.13 mN m−1(see Fig. S7 and S8†). With the decrease of substrate γs, the Δγs value decreases gradually to 0.37 mN m−1. Based on the classical ‘like dissolves like’ rule,47,48 we can speculate that the improved miscibility of the BHJ layer can be ascribed to the enhanced similarity of the two materials induced by substrate γs engineering. Besides, the morphologies of neat PM6 and neat Y6 films deposited on various PEDOT:PSSs were also detected. As shown in the height images, the RMS Rq of PM6 films is highly dependent on the substrate γs (Fig. S11a–d†), with lower γs having the smaller Rq (i.e. surface area), whereas an inverse relationship is observed for Y6 (Fig. S12a–d†). We speculated that the slight variations in PM6 and Y6 morphologies contribute to the mild changes of their γs values. As shown in the phase images (Fig. S11e–h and S12e–h†), both the features of the PM6 fibril and of the Y6 grain become more distinctive on lower γs substrates, similar to the results obtained on the DPP2T-TT photoactive material.49
Next, we investigated the charge carrier dynamics in the four OSCs with various PEDOT:PSS AIMs. Fig. 5a presents the plots between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) of various devices. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) is determined from the ratio of Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions (where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density). The Pdiss values are 96.2%, 96.8%, 97.3% and 96.6% for P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 OSCs, respectively. Clearly, the Pdiss shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, which is well consistent with the variation of the OSC Jsc and FF. The higher Pdiss is probably attributed to the superior BHJ miscibility that is beneficial for exciton dissociation. Complementarily, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was employed to investigate the kinetics of hole collection in relevant devices.

The measured curves are shown in Fig. 5b. The hole mobilities (μh) of devices with P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 as AIMs are 2.76 × 10−4, 3.65 × 10−4, 4.34 × 10−4 and 3.47 × 10−4, cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher μh value may be due to the better miscibility of PM6:Y6, which can be partially responsible for the enhanced Jsc and FF.
To gain insight into the charge recombination kinetics, we detected the light intensity (Plight) dependence of J–V characteristics of various OSCs. Fig. S13† presents the semilogarithmic plots of Voc as a function of Plight, and the data followed the formula of Voc = nkBT/qln(Plight), where kB, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. The slope of P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 OSCs are 1.21, 1.17, 1.12 and 1.12 kBT/q, respectively. This result indicates that P-500 derived optimal miscibility of PM6/Y6 aiding this BHJ suffers from the lowest trap-assisted recombination. Fig. 5c presents the plots between Jsc and Plight on the logarithmic scale, and the data followed the equation of Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is the exponential factor. The P-500-based device exhibits an α value of 0.955, larger than that of its P-70, P-200 and P-1000 counterparts (0.952, 0.953 and 0.942). The maximum α value means the smallest bimolecular recombination inside P-500 OSCs.
To further understand the difference in the Voc of the four OSC devices, energy loss (Eloss) analysis was carried out by using sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 5d–f and S14.† As expected, the four devices exhibit the same ΔE1 value of 0.265 eV, due to the same energy gap of the four PM6:Y6 devices. For the non-ideal radiative loss ΔE2, P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 devices exhibit different values of 0.06, 0.05, 0.05 and 0.05 eV, respectively. For nonradiative recombination loss, the ΔE3 were calculated to be 0.250, 0.245, 0.243 and 0.245 eV for P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 devices, respectively. The somewhat smaller ΔE2 and ΔE3 can be ascribed to the superior network morphology (miscibility) of the PM6:Y6 blend deposited on a lower γs AIM substrate. Based on the above analysis, the total Eloss values are estimated to be 0.575, 0.560, 0.558 and 0.560 eV for P-70, P-200, P-500 and P-1000 OSCs, respectively. Clearly, the Eloss shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, which is well in line with the variation of the OSC Voc.
2.4 Relationship between the γs of PEDOT:PSS AIMs, the miscibility of BHJ layers and the PCE of OSCs
According to the deep understanding of the PM6:Y6 model system, we further selected two more donors (PBDB-T and D18-Cl, see Fig. 6a) to investigate the correlation between the γs of PEDOT:PSS AIMs, the miscibility of Y6-based BHJs and the PCE of OSCs. The best-performing J–V curves of PBDB-T:Y6 and D18-Cl:Y6 OSCs and the corresponding operating parameters are exhibited in Fig. 6b, c and Table 2, respectively. The device performance is found to be strongly dependent on the γs of PEDOT:PSS AIMs. By optimizing the γs of AIMs, the PCEs are boosted from 12.20% to 12.96% for PBDB-T:Y6 OSCs, and from 15.76% to 17.30% for D18-Cl:Y6 OSCs, respectively. Noteworthily, Y6-based binary OSCs with the low γs donor of PBDB-T (about 31 mN m−1, see Fig. S15†) exhibit the optimal PCE for low γs P-1000 AIM, whereas the D18-Cl:Y6 OSCs with a high γs donor (about 38 mN m−1, see Fig. S16†) demonstrate the best performance for high γs P-200 AIM. These high device PCEs may have originated from their respective optimal miscibility of BHJs (see Table 2). Combining the analysis of PBDT-T:Y6, PM6:Y6 and D18-Cl:Y6 systems, we arrive at a speculation that the low γs donor based BHJs favor AIMs with lower γs, as depicted in Fig. 6e. Furthermore, when fabricated into PM6:BTP-ec9 devices with these PEDOT:PSSs, we found that the high γs P-200 based device exhibits the highest PCE among the four OSCs. By comparing the γs of BTP-ec9 and Y6 acceptors (about 42 vs. 39 mN m−1, see Fig. S17 and S8†), we can state that the high γs acceptor based BHJs favor AIMs with higher γs.

3 Conclusion
On the basis of the PEDOT:PSS AIMs, we have systematically studied the impacts of template Mw on the γs of PEDOTs, the miscibility of binary BHJs and the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. By changing the MPSSW from 70 to 1000 KDa, we prepared a series of PEDOT:PSSs with continuous gradient γs from 57.32 to 26.79 mN m−1 and found that the high MPSSW results in lower γs. Based on the continuously tunable γs of the PEDOT:PSS series and the thus optimized miscibility of active layers, impressive PCEs of 12.96%, 17.21% and 17.30% are achieved in PBDB-T:Y6, PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 based OSCs, respectively. As a highlight, a PM6:BTP-ec9 based OSC fabricated with P-200 AIM exhibits a competitive PCE of 18.19%, which is among the highest values in binary BHJ OSCs. More importantly, we found that the high γs donor (or acceptor) based binary BHJs favor AIMs with higher γs. This work not only highlights the important role of template Mw for tuning the γs of PEDOT conducting polymers, but also provides a clear map of the choice of AIMs in terms of γs for a BHJ donor or acceptor with a specific γs.
