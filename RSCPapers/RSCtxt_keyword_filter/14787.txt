    , Accepted 27th May 2014First published on 28th May 2014AbstractIn this paper, we report micromorph tandem solar cells coated with a hemispherical-pit (HP) array layer, which traps light and consequently enhances the efficiency. A quartz mold for ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) was fabricated by combining UV photolithography and wet-etching technology, and the HP arrays were then transferred onto the tandem solar cells through UV-NIL. The HP array layer could simultaneously reduce the average reflectance of the tandem solar cells from 7.7% to 1.8%, and effectively enhance light trapping by scattering more incident light into the tandem solar cells. A relative improvement of the efficiency of the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer is up to 4.1% as compared to the reference device. The current–voltage characteristics of the tandem solar cells as a function of incident angle were also investigated. The power conversion efficiency of the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer is always higher than that of the reference with the same incident angle. The results further show that the HP array layer can effectively decrease the reflectance and scatter more incident light into the solar cells at larger angles not only for normal incidence but also for the obliquely incident light. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer was also investigated as well as the reference tandem solar cells. The possible physical mechanism behind the observation is also discussed in this work.
1 Introduction
To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of thin film silicon solar cells, a number of light trapping techniques have been investigated in order to manipulate light inside the absorber layers and increase the effective path length in the solar cells.1,2 Light trapping is frequently accomplished through the use of randomly roughened or periodically textured surfaces, such as transparent conductive oxides (TCO),3–8 diffractive grating structures,9–11 photonic crystal structures12–16 and plasma structures,17–23 either on the front or rear of the solar cells. Generally, about 10% of incident light is reflected from the surface of the thin film silicon solar cells back to the air. However, the thin film silicon solar cells coated with an antireflection (AR) layer can significantly reduce the total light reflection and increase light absorption.24–31 Especially, Escarré and coworkers31 demonstrated that the imprinting of random square based pyramidal textures can simultaneously enhance light in-coupling and light-trapping in amorphous silicon/microcrystalline silicon tandem solar cells, and the PCE is enhanced by 5% compared to the reference solar cells.
In addition, Yu and coworkers14,15 demonstrated that the hemispherical-pit arrays have a higher enhancement factor compared to hemispherical-concave arrays, and both textured arrays are performed under the condition that the hemispherical diameter is equal to the array periodicity, so we design and fabricate a hybrid resist hemispherical-pit (HP) array layer (for convenience, the hybrid resist hemispherical-pit (HP) array layer is briefly named the HP array layer) to enhance the PCE of the micromorph tandem solar cells via ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (UV NIL) in this paper. The advantages of this technique are as follows: micromorph tandem solar cells are becoming among the most promising candidates in terms of their PCE through the combination of an amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) top cell having a high band gap (1.7 eV) and a microcrystalline silicon (c-Si:H) bottom cell with low band gap (1.1 eV), which is extremely close to the theoretical values of the ideal tandem solar cells with maximum conversion efficiency.32,33 UV-NIL is a low cost and relatively high throughput method for patterning nanostructures, which allows mass production with step and repeat techniques.34,35 Moreover, compared with a traditional single AR layer, the HP array layer having a gradient refractive index can reduce the reflectance and scatter more incident light into the cells and prolong the optical path length.24,26 The other important benefit of this design is that it provides some room to reduce the thickness of the top a-Si:H absorber, thereby reducing the Staebler–Wronski degradation effect36,37 and thus leading to higher stability of the efficiency of the entire micromorph tandem solar cells.
Herein, we introduce a novel technological process for preparing a quartz mold for use in UV NIL. Then we focus on the fabrication of a HP array layer for micromorph tandem solar cells via UV NIL. By varying the incident light angle under standard test conditions (25 °C, AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2), the optical properties and the performance of tandem solar cells are discussed. The possible physical mechanism behind the observation is also explored in this work.
2 Experimental
2.1 Thin film solar cell fabrication
The fabrication process of the micromorph tandem thin film silicon solar cells is as follows. Firstly, a front contact F-doped SnO2 layer with a thickness of 400 nm was deposited on a bare glass substrate by atmosphere pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).38 Secondly, a front 200 nm thick a-Si (p–i–n) cell and a bottom 1800 nm thick μc-Si (p–i–n) cell with a 20 nm P-doped nc-SiOx:H intermediate reflector in between were grown by the conventional plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Finally, a thin ZnO:Al/Ag film serving as a back reflector was sputtered.
2.2 Materials and methods
The hybrid resist comprising fluorinated mercaptopropyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-F-SH) and a diluted crosslinker (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-1,6-hexyl diacrylate, DCFA4) (POSS-F-SH/DCFA4, and mole ratio, 1:16) was used as the material of the soft mold and the HP array layer because of its favorable properties, which include elastomeric character, low price, high optical transparency (about 98% transmission above 350 nm), excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 627 MPa), low surface energy (18.8 mJ m−2), high decomposition temperature (335 °C), and easy de-molding. Fig. 1 shows the structures of thiol–ene photo-curable hybrid resist (POSS-F-SH/DCFA4). The refractive index (n) and absorption index (k) of the hybrid resist were measured using an NKD-8000 (Aquila, UK), as shown in Fig. 2. The detailed synthetic process and characteristics of the hybrid resist can be found in our previous report.39

Many research studies show that considerably better performance is achieved by optimized textured surfaces.10,14,15 Especially, there have been studies demonstrating that optimized nanostructures can achieve the enhancement factor beyond the Yablonovitch limit.10,40,41 Here, we use a commercial mask with a pitch of 10 μm and a diameter hole of 5 μm for UV photolithography. It should be noted that the texture of the mask is not optimal, but commercially available and state of our art laboratory standard.

Fig. 3 shows the fabrication process of this work. The surface of a quartz substrate was first cleaned with ACE, IPA, and D.I. water by ultrasonic agitation. A 100 nm Cr layer was deposited on the surface of the quartz substrate as the mask for wet etching. The quartz substrate with the Cr layer was then spin-coated with the AZ4620 photoresist and exposed to UV light (Karl Suss MA6, Germany), as shown in Fig. 3(a). After being developed with AZ 400MIF developer solution (Fig. 3(b)), the AZ4620 photoresist patterns were first chemically etched in a solution mixture of Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6, HClO4, and D.I. water (9:6:85, by weight) for 60 s to transfer the pattern onto the Cr layer shown in Fig. 3(c). After removing the photoresist, the entire quartz substrate with the patterned Cr layer was dipped into the buffered hydrofluoric (BHF) acid solution mixed with 40% NH4F and 49% HF for 3–5 min at 25 °C. Thereafter, by removing the Cr layer, the quartz mold with HP arrays can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f). Due to the isotropic etching time of BHF solution, the wet etching process resulted in different textured HP arrays as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b).

The surface of the quartz substrate (soft mold substrate) and the quartz mold with HP arrays were hydrophilic by immersing it in a piranha solution (30% H2O2:98% H2SO4 = 1:3) at 150 °C for 3 h. After washing and drying, the quartz substrate of the soft mold was soaked in 0.2 wt% MAPTES (3-(methacryloyloxy)propyltrimethoxysilane) in toluene solutions for 4 h, while the quartz mold was soaked in 0.2 wt% TCMTS ((5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,10-tridecafluoro-4-methyldecyl)trimethoxy silane) in toluene solutions for 4 h. Then both were cleaned thoroughly with fresh ethanol in an ultrasonic bath and dried in nitrogen gas, respectively. Thereafter the hybrid resist was spin-coated on the surface of the quartz substrate of the soft mold at 1000 rpm for 15 s, and the thickness of the hybrid resist was about 5 μm. Then the quartz substrate with the hybrid resist layer was covered by the quartz mold with HP arrays modified by the TCMTS molecules, as shown in Fig. 3(g). Finally, the sample was exposed to UV light for 10 min after applying a pressure of 0.02 MPa for 10 min by our home-made UV pneumatic imprinting machine (Fig. 3(h)). After de-molding, the quartz substrate (soft mold) with the patterned hybrid resist layer was baked at 100 °C for 1 h to enhance its mechanical properties and solvent resistance.

Fig. 3(j)–(l) show the schematic of the fabrication of the HP array layer for the micromorph tandem solar cells. Before the hybrid resist was spin-coated on the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells, the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells was suspended and immersed in 0.2 wt% MAPTES in toluene solutions for 4 h, and then the surface of the glass substrate was washed gently with ethanol to remove physisorbed MAPTES molecules, and dried with nitrogen gas. Next, a 5 μm thick hybrid resist was spin-coated over the micromorph tandem solar cells at 1000 rpm for 15 s, and then the tandem solar cells with the hybrid resist layer and the soft mold were then combined and exposed to UV light for 6 min after applying a pressure of 0.02 MPa for 10 min, as illustrated in Fig. 3(k). After curing under UV light and de-molding, the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 3(l).
2.3 Characterization techniques
The microstructure of the samples was studied with a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (ULTRA 55, Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). In all cases, sputtered gold–palladium coating of 50–80 Å was used to improve the sample conductivity, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). All surface images of the sample were obtained using sample mounts with a 30 degree inclination from the horizontal.
The reflectance from the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells was measured using a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda-1050, Perkin Elmer) at room temperature, with an integrating sphere attachment over the spectral range of 300–1200 nm. All samples were measured at square spots of 4 mm × 4 mm to obtain the average reflectance. The photocurrent of the tandem solar cells tested was analyzed using a solar simulator under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2, 25 °C). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the tandem solar cells was also measured using a QEX10 quantum efficiency measurement system (PV Measurements).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Surface characterization of the HP array layer

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the SEM image of the quartz mold with different tapered HP arrays. A SEM image of the replica soft mold imprinted by the quartz mold (b) is also given in Fig. 4(c). Finally, the HP array layer is uniformly imprinted onto the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells, and the depth of HP is about 5 μm (not shown), as shown in Fig. 4(d). One can see that the pattern transferred on the light entrance surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells after two processes is still consistent with the quartz mold.
3.2 Optical properties of the HP array layer
The reflectance of the tandem solar cells with three different types of texture on the glass substrate was also measured using a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fig. 5(a) shows the measured reflectance of the tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer (the thickness was about 5 μm) without and with the HP arrays at 8° tilted angle with respect to the normal incident light beam, and the tandem solar cells with the bare glass substrate served as a reference. It is worth mentioning that a thin ZnO:Al/Ag film is placed on the backside of the solar cells as a perfect reflector mirror. So the transmission is approximated to be zero, and reducing the reflection means enhancing the absorption. Note that the strong oscillations of the spectra are due to the interference between different interfaces of the bare solar cells, especially in the range from 750 nm to 1200 nm. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the existence of HP arrays results in weaker interference and weaker intensity of the reflected wave. The average reflectance (averaged from 300 to 1200 nm) of the bare surface of the glass substrate was 7.7%. However, the tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer without and with the HP array structures had an even lower average reflectance of 6.8% and 1.8%, respectively. The reflectance of the tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays is also slightly lower than that of the bare reference due to the lower refractive index of the hybrid resist layer material compared with that of the glass substrate. From Fig. 5(b), it can be noted that the reflectance of the tandem solar cells with the bare glass substrate increases with increasing incident angle, however, for the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer, with increasing incident angle, the reflectance increases below the wavelength of 800 nm and decreases from the wavelength of 800 to 1200 nm. Compared with the traditional AR layer, the continuous change of the effective refractive index between air and the underlying glass is essential for suppressing light reflection.

(b) Measured reflectance of tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer at an incident angle of 8° and 45°, and the bare tandem solar cells also displayed in parallel for comparison. 
3.3 Analysis of optics in the HP array layer
For the HP array layer, both scattering and diffraction will happen and provide contribution to the absorption. And diffraction arises from the collective interaction with many scattering objects. However, scattering effects dominate the absorption enhancement behavior due to the structure of the focused HP arrays larger than the incident light. Herein, the HP array layer was analyzed by geometrical optics in this work.31 For easy analysis of ray dynamic, the refractive index of the hybrid resist and the glass substrate of the tandem solar cells are fixed to be 1.478 at a wavelength of 600 nm due to a quite close refractive index between the hybrid resist and the glass substrate of the tandem solar cells. In addition, the transparent conductive oxide layer with random texture was under the glass substrate (not shown). Fig. 6(a) shows how the incident light interacts with the hybrid resist without (left) and with (right) the HP array layer. By applying Snell's law, the incident light which is perpendicularly projected onto the hybrid resist without the HP array layer has been divided into two parts. Part of the light will enter into the solar cells, and the other part will be reflected back to the air. While the normal incident light projected onto the HP array layer has also been divided into two parts. One part of the light will be refracted into the HP array layer with different directions of propagation, and the other part may travel towards the HP arrays again or back towards the air. For example, when a1 = 60°, one can get a2 = 35.87° and most of the incident light is refracted into the tandem solar cells. Such a result shows that the HP array layer can scatter more incident light into the tandem solar cells and prolong the optical path length even though the obliquely incident light is used.
 Fig. 6  Ray diagrams showing how light geometrically interacts with the HP array texture when (a) entering or (b) exiting the device. 
The ray diagrams of Fig. 6(b) show how the outgoing light interacts with the HP array layer. According to the Snell refraction law, the total internal reflection will happen if the incident angle is larger than the critical angle. The critical angle should satisfy eqn (1) and the total reflection condition of the HP array layer should satisfy the angle – side eqn (2) of the triangle, as shown in the following. nisinθc = 1(1) (2)where ni = 1.478 is the refractive index of the hybrid resist at a wavelength of 600 nm, one can get the critical angle θc = 42.58°. R = 5 μm is the radius of the HP arrays, L is the height of the hybrid resist between the HP arrays and the glass substrate (L is small and can be negligible here), and H = 1000 μm is the height of the glass substrate. For the hybrid resist without the HP array layer, when a4 = θc = 42.58°, one can get a3 = 90° − a4 = 90° − θc = 47.42°, which means that part of the scattered light with the angle bigger than a3 = 47.42° will escape from the solar cells. However, according to eqn (2), the scattered light with the angle ranging from 0° to 89.81° (when θ = θc, then 0° < a5 < 90° − δ = 90° − 0.19° = 89.81°) will experience internal total reflection for the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer. Such results demonstrate that the HP array layer can make more outgoing light reflect back into the tandem solar cells compared with that of the reference tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays.
3.4 Efficiency of tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer
Firstly, five bare samples were tested using a solar simulator under AM 1.5G illumination condition before spin-coating the hybrid resist layer. For the sake of comparison, Samples 1–4 coated with the HP array layer and Sample 5 coated with the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays were also tested. The performance and I–V characteristics of all five samples are presented in Table 1. The short circuit current density (Jsc) of Samples 1–4 has been enhanced after introducing the HP array layer. Meanwhile the short circuit current density (Jsc) of Sample 5 coated with the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays is slightly higher than that of the bare reference. A relative improvement of the efficiency of the tandem solar cells (Sample 1) coated with the HP array layer is up to 4.1% as compared to the reference device, which agrees well with the theoretical calculation.37 But it is lower than the predicted enhancement by reducing the reflectance. Such phenomena can be explained as follows: on the one hand, the AM 1.5G spectrum is nonlinear and nonuniform distribution, which could not guarantee the same increment to the tandem solar cells like the UV/VIS/NIR spectrum; on the other hand, the increments of short circuit current density of the top cell and bottom cell of the tandem solar cells are different, and thus some of the photo-generated carriers of the cells with greater short circuit current density will recombine again. In addition, the absorption of the hybrid resist layer also leads to low power conversion efficiency (especially, below 350 nm).39 However, no doubt that the coated HP array layer has a gradient refractive index, which can reduce the reflectance and scatter more incident light into the cell induced by ordered HP arrays and prolong the optical path length,24,26 therefore enhancing the light trapping and boosting the light conversion efficiency for the micromorph tandem solar cells.

In order to evaluate the influence of the oblique light incidence conditions, current–voltage characteristics of the tandem solar cells (Sample 1) as a function of incident angle were further investigated, and the corresponding bare sample was served as a reference, as shown in Table 2. In addition, the I–V characteristics of Sample 1 before and after adding the HP array layer at an incident angle of 0° and 45° are also given in Fig. 7. From Table 2 and Fig. 7, one can see that both short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) decrease with increasing incident angle due to the weakness of the solar energy density spectrum into the tandem solar cells. It is worth noting that the PCE of Sample 1 coated with the HP array layer is always higher than that of bare Sample 1 with the same incident angle. As discussed above, such behaviour further indicates that the coated HP array layer can effectively scatter more incident light into the solar cells at larger angles not only for normal incidence but also for obliquely incident light, therefore improving the short circuit current density and thus leading to higher light conversion efficiency.

In order to further understand the enhancement absorption spectral range of the tandem solar cells after adding the hybrid resist layer with or without HP arrays. The EQE of the tandem solar cells with three different types of texture on the surface of the glass substrate was measured using a QEX10 quantum efficiency measurement system, as shown in Fig. 8. One can see firstly that the EQE of the bare tandem solar cells is higher than that of the tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer with and without the HP arrays, which is due to the low optical transparency (about 85%) below 350 nm,39 while the EQE of the HP array layer is higher than that of the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays, which is due to the lower effective thickness with the HP arrays. Note that the bare tandem solar cells and the tandem solar cells coated with the hybrid resist layer without the HP arrays exhibit almost equivalent EQE, top and bottom cell currents. Such phenomena can be explained that the hybrid resist material has a slightly lower refractive index compared with that of top glass of the tandem solar cells, and also served as a traditional AR layer. For the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer, the currents increase from 10.98 to 11.43 mA cm−2 for the top cell, and from 11.21 to 12.06 mA cm−2 for the bottom cell, respectively. The relative increase of both top and bottom cells is 4.1% and 7.6%, respectively. The short circuit current density of the tandem solar cells depends on the lower current (the Jsc of the top cell), and the increase of the Jsc of the top cell by EQE agrees well with the enhancement, as shown in Fig. 7. Such results also indicate that the bottom cell benefits more from the HP array layer.

For the micromorph tandem solar cells, the HP array layer having a gradient refractive index not only provides excellent antireflection properties but also can effectively scatter more incident light into the cell induced by ordered HP arrays and prolong the optical path length,24,26 therefore enhancing the light trapping and improving the short circuit current density. Although the bottom cell benefits more from the HP array layer, it could still supply some room to tailor the thickness of the front a-Si:H absorber, thereby reducing the Staebler–Wronski degradation effect36,37 and thus leading to higher stability of the efficiency of the entire micromorph tandem solar cells. In addition, although the surface morphology from V-shaped to U-shaped can improve the electrical device performances of deposited cells, it cannot guarantee that there are no cracks formed in the U-shaped valleys between the nanostructure arrays as the silicon layers growing on neighboring nanostructures collide.22,42,43 The cracks might cause degradation in Voc and FF in the deposited cells. However, the HP array layer offer a means of improving the efficiency not by changing the microelectronics fabrication methods or altering the device chemistry, but by simply adding a coated hybrid resist layer with the HP arrays onto the glass substrate of the tandem solar cells. So the major advantage is that it avoided the formation of cracks during the growth of the layers, then the Voc and FF are not affected by the backside structure, compared to other light trapping configurations such as textured silicon interface,22,42,43 and thus yielding better cell performance. This technique could also be implemented in the single silicon thin film solar cells for efficiency enhancement. We believe that, with further optimized parameters of the HP arrays, the performance of our HP array layer can more effectively enhance the PCE of the solar cells.
4 Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated a novel method for preparing a quartz mold for UV-NIL. The HP array layer was successfully applied on the surface of the glass substrate of the micromorph tandem solar cells via UV NIL. The HP array layer has effectively reduced the reflection and led to scattering of more incident light into the micromorph tandem solar cells and prolonged the optical path length, therefore increasing the short circuit current density and enhancing the PCE of tandem solar cells. Compared with that of 7.7% of the reference tandem solar cell, the average reflectance of the tandem solar cell coated with the hybrid resist layer without and with the HP array structures dropped to 6.8% and 1.8%, respectively. A relative improvement of the efficiency of the tandem solar cells coated with the HP array layer is up to 4.1% as compared to the reference device. Furthermore, the HP array layer could provide some room to reduce the Staebler–Wronski degradation effect, thus leading to higher stability of the efficiency of the entire micromorph tandem cells due to the fine trapping light performance. In addition, the HP array layer exhibited a hydrophobic nature due to the low surface energy of the hybrid resist with HP arrays. Another important benefit using the HP array layer on the surface of the glass substrate of solar cells is that it is useful to avoid the formation of cracks during the silicon growth.
