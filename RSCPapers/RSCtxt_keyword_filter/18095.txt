    , Accepted 10th January 2023First published on 11th January 2023AbstractAlthough the anomalous ferroelectric photovoltaic effect of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) has recently drawn widespread attention, very low photocurrent density and poor power conversion efficiency severely hinder its practical application as a photovoltaic device. A novel photovoltaic architecture was herein designed and constructed to achieve enhanced photovoltaic performance in (Sm and Ni) gradient-doped BiFeO3 multilayers. The experimental results and analysis show that the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies greatly enhances the photovoltaic performance of the gradient-doped BiFeO3 multilayer. In particular, its photocurrent density (Jsc) of 80 μA cm−2 and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.49 V are much higher than those of pure BiFeO3 films reported in previous literature. Meanwhile, a possible underlying mechanism was finally proposed to demonstrate the enhanced photovoltaic property, that is, the oxygen vacancy gradient distribution coupled with the flexoelectric effect greatly enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby ultimately enhancing the photovoltaic output of the above photovoltaic architecture.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of modern industry, the global energy crisis and increasing environmental problems have emerged, which are the key problems to be solved urgently for all countries in the world. Photovoltaic new energy is a potential substitute for fossil fuels due to its cleanliness, sustainability and extensiveness, and has become one of the possible solutions to the above problems. At present, silicon-based photovoltaic cells have occupied the vast majority of the solar cell market. However, the fabrication cost of silicon-based solar cells is still high and the photoelectric conversion efficiency has a limit (Shockley–Queisser limit, η < 33%).1,2 In order to address the above issues, new solar cells such as semiconductor thin-film cells, organic perovskite cells, and ferroelectric photovoltaic devices have received widespread attention in recent years.3–8 Theoretical calculations showed that photovoltaic devices based on ferroelectric materials might break through the Shockley–Queisser limit of traditional silicon-based photovoltaic cells, thus becoming a research hotspot in the field of new photovoltaic cells.1,9 Nevertheless, traditional ferroelectric materials (LiNbO3, BaTiO3, etc.) have wide band gaps (Eg > 3 eV) and very low photoelectric conversion efficiencies, thus limiting their application in photovoltaic devices.
More recently, multiferroic BiFeO3 with a narrow bandgap (Eg ∼ 2.7 eV) and giant ferroelectric polarization (P > 100 μC cm−2) has great advantages in the photovoltaic application, making it the most promising ferroelectric photovoltaic material with potential breakthrough results.10–12 Previous literature13–16 works mainly focused on exploring the origin of the ferroelectric photovoltaic effect in BiFeO3. For example, (i) bulk photovoltaic mechanism: the emergence of a stable photocurrent in a homogeneous medium with an asymmetric center is the so-called “bulk photovoltaic effect” (BPVE). The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is described by a third-order tensor, which can only exist in the absence of inversion in centrosymmetric substances. Studies reported that 21 piezoelectric crystals might exhibit the BPVE effect;16,17 (ii) domain wall theory: Yang et al.11 found a giant open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼16 V in BiFeO3 films with a periodic arrangement of 71° domain walls, thereby coming up with the domain wall theory. The results show that the photogenerated voltage is proportional to the numbers of nanodomain walls being parallel to the electrode, but it will disappear as the electrode becomes perpendicular to the domain wall; (iii) depolarization field effect: within the interfaces between the ferroelectric film and metal electrodes, the surface charges of the film caused by the remanent polarization cannot be completely shielded by the free compensation charges from the metals due to their inconsistency, subsequently forming a depolarization field throughout the entire ferroelectric film;18 (iv) Schottky barrier effect: a Schottky contact is formed as a ferroelectric semiconductor is in contact with a metal electrode. A built-in electric field is generated at the interface between the ferroelectric film and metal electrodes, which can easily separate photogenerated electron–holes and then drive the photogenerated charges to the electrodes;19 (v) vacancy: the effect of the vacancy on the photovoltaic output of the ferroelectrics is very complex. Being similar to the Schottky barrier effect that generates a built-in electric field at the interface, the vacancy in the ferroelectrics (such as oxygen vacancy) can also generate a built-in electric field and affect the photovoltaic performance of ferroelectric materials.20,21 In fact, the more important thing is that the very low photocurrent density and poor power conversion efficiency of BiFeO3 seriously hinder its practical application as a photovoltaic device. Nevertheless, there are very few reports on improving its photocurrent or power conversion efficiency.
This paper pioneered the construction of a stacked ferroelectric photovoltaic device structure composed of a (Sm and Ni) gradient-doped BiFeO3 multilayer film. In this novel structure, the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies was achieved through the gradient distribution of components, and the flexoelectric effect was also induced at the same time. The coupling effect of these multiple factors enhances the whole built-in electric field, improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, and finally improves the photovoltaic output of the (Sm and Ni) gradient-doped BiFeO3 multilayer photovoltaic device. Finally, a possible mechanism was proposed to demonstrate the origin of the enhanced photovoltaic performance in this (Sm and Ni) gradient-doped BiFeO3 photovoltaic device.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Thin film preparation
Bi1−xSmxFe0.975Ni0.025O3 (x = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15) thin films were prepared by a sol–gel spin-coating process, where x = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 were labeled as BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3, respectively. In addition, the gradient-doped multilayer film was constructed as BSFNO-1/BSFNO-2/BSFNO-3 and is denoted as BSFNO-g. During the preparation of the samples, spin-coating times for the conventionally doped samples (BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, and BSFNO-3) were 9. In order to maintain the same thickness for all samples, spin-coating times for the gradient-doped sample (BSFNO-g) were also 9 (3 + 3 + 3); that is, the first layers (first “3”) are BSFNO-1, the middle layers (middle “3”) are BSFNO-2, and the last layers (last “3”) are BSFNO-3 (the schematic diagram of thin film photovoltaic devices is shown in Fig. 8d).
As a typical run, Bi(NO3)·5H2O was dissolved in 20 ml acetic acid at 50–80 °C to form a clear solution A. Then, the metal nitrates of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Sm(NO3)3·6H2O, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 40 ml ethylene-glycol-methyl-ether to form solution B. A mixture of solution A and B was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then was aged for 24 h to form the precursor solution. BiFeO3-based thin films were deposited onto an FTO/glass substrate using spin-coating technology (first, at a speed of 600 rpm for 9 s and then 4000 rpm for 30 s). The wet coatings were annealed at 300 °C (2 min) and then at 550 °C (5 min). The spin-coating process was repeated 9 times to obtain the desired and uniform thickness. Lastly, the coatings were annealed at 550 °C for another 30 min. Au was sputtered onto the surface of BSFNO films as the top electrode (Φ = 0.5 mm) for the electrical measurements (FTO as the bottom electrode).
2.2 Characterization and measurements
The phase purity and crystalline structures of BiFeO3-based thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (power: 2.2 kW, focal spot: 0.4 × 12 mm; goniometer radius: 280 mm). Raman spectra (HR800) show that BiFeO3 film exhibited a phase transition trend of the microstructure after ion doping. The surface morphologies of the as-prepared films were observed using a field-emission scanning-electron-microscope (FE-SEM, Quanta F250). The chemical states of the film surface were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS analysis was performed on the Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha XPS system (Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.68 eV). Survey XPS spectra (0–1000 eV BE) were collected at a pass energy of 40 eV with an energy step of 0.5 eV. High-resolution XPS spectra for specific elements were recorded at a pass energy of 20 eV with an energy step of 0.1 eV. A base pressure of 5 × 10−10 mbar was held in an analytical chamber. C 1s contamination peak at 284.5 eV was used for binding energy calibration. Spectral analysis was performed on the basis of the Pseudo-Voigt (Psd-Voigt) fitting function after the Shirley-type background subtraction. The leakage current densities of the films under different fields (J–E) were characterized by a precise source/measure unit (Keithley 4200-SCS meter). The photovoltaic properties of the films were evaluated under the irradiation of a laser source (hv = 3.06 eV) with the maximum power density of 50 mW cm−2, and the current–voltage curves were simultaneously recorded using the Keysight B2901a meter. The absorption spectra of the films were investigated by UV-Visible spectroscopy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphology
The phase purity and crystalline structures of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, BSFNO-3, and BSFNO-g films were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1a. XRD patterns show that all detectable diffraction peaks of the films can be easily assigned to the rhombohedral distorted perovskite structure of the R3c space group on the basis of the JCPDS card (no. 86-1518), in which five characteristic peaks at 23.3°, 32.7°, 33.1°, 46.7° and 52.2° corresponding to (012), (104), (110), (024) and (116) diffraction planes, respectively, are clearly visible. It means that Sm and Ni co-dopants do not change the crystalline structure of BiFeO3. At the same time, sharp diffraction peaks indicate that all films are of high crystalline quality.
 Fig. 1  (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of BSFNO thin films, and (b) fitting analysis of the (012) diffraction peak for BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 films. 
Nevertheless, cleaved (104) and (110) peaks in BiFeO3 gradually merge into one peak in BSFNO, which might result from smaller atomic radii of Sm3+ and Ni2+ than those of Bi3+ and Fe3+, respectively. XRD results show that BSFNO films maintain the crystalline structure of the parent phase (BiFeO3), indicating that the intrinsic ferroelectric nature should be preserved. Furthermore, the delicate analysis of XRD patterns can reveal the subtle differences in the crystal structure of different films. As shown in Fig. 1b, fitting analysis of the (012) diffraction peak in XRD patterns of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 films shows an apparent tendency to shift to a higher angle with the increase of Sm content in the BiFeO3 system, which should be attributed to the smaller atomic radius of Sm3+ than that of Bi3+. Obviously, the unit cell volumes of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 show a gradual decrease. It means that the gradient-doped multilayer BSFNO-g thin film (BSFNO-1/BSFNO-2/BSFNO-3) will show a trend of gradual lattice shrinkage from top to bottom, consequently inducing a strain gradient in the film. In other words, the flexoelectric effect is possibly induced in the BSFNO-g thin film, which will be discussed later. In addition, the diffraction peaks of the FTO substrate can be detected in all films, implying that the films might be very thin (as shown in SEM images of Fig. 3).
At the same time, Raman spectra can further reflect the effect of (Sm and Ni) co-doping on the fine phase structure of BiFeO3, as shown in Fig. 2. According to a group theory, 13 Raman active modes (ΓRaman, R3c = 4A1 + 9E) exist in the rhombohedral distortion perovskites with the R3c space group.22,23 The measured frequency range of Raman scattering spectra was set to 50–750 cm−1. All Raman modes observed in BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, BSFNO-3 and BSFNO-g films are basically the same as that of the rhombohedral distortion perovskite structure, further demonstrating that BSFNO films have the same crystalline structure as that of the parent phase BiFeO3. In particular, two characteristic modes of A1-1 (∼143 cm−1) and E-1 (∼75 cm−1) should be controlled by the Bi–O covalent bond, responsible for the permittivity and ferroelectric phase.22 The Bi–O covalent bonds remain relatively stable because the above two modes (A1-1 and E-1) did not exhibit any significant change. However, another A1 mode (A1-2 ≈175 cm−1) associated with Fe atoms responsible for magnetism exhibited significant weakening with the introduction of the dopant Sm. It might be due to the super-exchange interaction between magnetic Sm3+ and Fe3+ through oxygen bridges, which significantly affects the magnetic property of BiFeO3.24,25

Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of BSFNO-1 and BSFNO-g films. As shown in Fig. 3a, BSFNO-1 film has many cracks or pores, indicating poor surface uniformity and low packing density. Compared with BSFNO-1 film, the surface morphology of BSFNO-g multilayer film (Fig. 3b) changed significantly, which exhibited a denser and defect-free microstructure. Such improvement in the film quality of the BSFNO-g sample might result from this particular multilayer structure or the presence of buffer layers. Concerning the BSFNO-g multilayer sample, BSFNO-1 as the top layer was deposited on the buffer layers of BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 instead of direct deposition on FTO. This particular multilayer structure or the presence of buffer layers could effectively eliminate the large lattice mismatch between BSFNO-x and FTO, leading to a remarkable improvement in the film quality of the BSFNO-g sample. Obviously, the gradient-doping can significantly improve the film surface uniformity and compactness. It should lead to the reduction of leakage current and enhancement of ferroelectric behavior of BSFNO-g film. The inset of Fig. 3a is the cross-sectional view of BSFNO-1 film, in which the thickness of the as-prepared thin film is about 210 nm. It should be noted that the thickness of other films is almost the same as that of BSFNO-1 film prepared under the same conditions.

3.2 Electrical and optical properties

Fig. 4 shows the current density (J) as a function of electric field (E) for BSFNO thin films measured at room temperature. Obviously, the content of the Sm dopant greatly affects the leakage conductivity of BSFNO films. The increasing trend of the leakage current density is BSFNO-1 < BSFNO-2 < BSFNO-3; that is to say, BSFNO-3 presents the largest leakage current density, while BSFNO-1 has the smallest. For example, under the electric field strength of 100 kV cm−1, the leakage current densities of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, and BSFNO-3 films are 4.5 × 10−5, 2.5 × 10−2, and 2.3 × 101 A cm−2, respectively. In general, the leakage current in BiFeO3-based films mainly originates from the charge hopping between Fe2+ and Fe3+ or the existence of oxygen vacancies.15,21 In this case, different leakage current densities in BSFNO thin films should be attributed to different concentrations of oxygen vacancies in these films, which will be demonstrated in the next section. At the same time, it can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the J–E characteristics of BSFNO films are not symmetrical in positive and negative electric fields. This may be due to the different work functions of FTO and Au electrodes in the devices of Au/BSFNO-x/FTO, which reveals the possible formation of Schottky barrier electric fields in these devices.
 Fig. 4  Leakage conductance curves (J–E) of BSFNO thin films. 
In order to better understand the leakage behavior of BSFNO films, it is necessary to explore their leakage conduction mechanisms. In the previous literature,26–28 there are four possible leakage conduction mechanisms in BiFeO3 film: space-charge-limited-current (SCLC), Poole–Frenkel (PF) emission, Schottky emission (SE) or Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanisms. In this case, because the film thickness of 210 nm is much larger than the possible tunneling depth of 50 nm, the FN tunneling mechanism can be ruled out. Therefore, the dominant leakage conduction mechanism of BSFNO films can be determined from SCLC, PF or SE emission mechanisms.

3.2.1 Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mechanism. 
Because the charges are injected into the film from the electrode faster than they pass through the film, the limitation stems from the current, hindering the formation of space charges. According to the SCLC mechanism, the leakage current density can be expressed as follows:26–28 (1)where ε0 is vacuum permittivity, εr is relative permittivity, μ is charge mobility, E is electric field strength, and L is the thickness of the film.


3.2.2 Poole–Frenkel emission (P–F) mechanism. 
On the basis of this conduction mechanism and continuous hopping of charges between vacancy trap centers, the ionization of trap charges can be either thermally or field-activated. According to the P–F mechanism, the leakage current density can be expressed as follows:26–28 (2)where φt is trap ionization energy, εopt is optical permittivity, kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge and T is the thermodynamic temperature.


3.2.3 Schottky-emission (S-E) mechanism. 
The Schottky barrier is caused by the Fermi level difference between the metal electrode and the semiconductor thin film. The energy difference creates a potential barrier between the metal and semiconductor that the charge must overcome. The current density across the barrier can be expressed as follows:26–28 (3)
Among them, A is Richardson's constant, and ϕ is the Schottky barrier height.
As shown in Fig. 5a, it clearly shows that the as-prepared thin films exhibited obvious ohmic conduction behavior under a low electric field (E < 26 kV cm−1, shown in Fig. 5a), which might be attributed to oxygen vacancies presented in these films (see XPS results in Fig. 6), which would make electron transferring at the metal–semiconductor interface be dominated by the tunneling process, leading to ohmic behavior.20,27 As shown in Fig. 5b, the Schottky emission (SE) conduction mechanism dominating in the medium electric field region (26 kV cm−1 < E < 149 kV cm−1) might originate from different work functions of FTO and Au electrodes in the devices of Au/BSFNO-x/FTO. Nevertheless, the Poole–Frenkel emission (P–F) mechanism was observed in the high electric field region (E > 149 kV cm−1, shown in Fig. 5c). PF emission is very similar to Schottky emission, which involves a process where charge carriers trapped in defect centers emit into the conduction band and contribute to the conduction process.28 These trap centers distributed within the forbidden region of the dielectrics might originate from interband energy levels induced by dopant ions (i.e. the dopants of Sm3+ and Ni2+ in BiFeO3 in this case).29,30 The carriers in these trap centers could be activated under a higher electric field.28

 Fig. 6  (a) Fe 2p and (b) O 1s core-level XPS spectra of BSFNO thin films. (c) Rpeaks values revealing the oxygen vacancy concentration in these films. 
It is well known that the leakage conductance of BiFeO3 mainly originates from the existence of the Fe2+ or oxygen vacancy. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the valence states of Fe and O elements in BSFNO films. Fig. 6a shows the Fe 2p XPS spectra of BSFNO films and the corresponding peak fitting parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the XPS spectral profiles of Fe 2p (Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2) are not much different in all samples, implying that the chemical state of Fe is almost the same in all BSFNO films. In particular, a characteristic satellite peak around 718 eV was found in the Fe 2p XPS spectra of all BSFNO samples (about 8 eV higher than the Fe 2p3/2 peak), indicating that only Fe3+ exists in these films.31,32 Therefore, the contribution of the charge hopping between Fe3+ and Fe2+ to the leakage conductivity of BiFeO3 films can be excluded.

XPS spectra of O 1s for BSFNO films are shown in Fig. 6b, which is not a unimodal curve. In order to obtain the exact position of each peak, each curve is properly fitted on the basis of the Pseudo-Voigt (Psd-Voigt) fitting function. The corresponding fitting results are also summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the XPS spectrum of each O 1s includes three peaks and their energies from low to high are corresponding to metal–oxygen bonds (such as Bi–O bonds and Fe–O bonds in BiFeO3), dangling bonds and surface-adsorbed bonds, respectively. Generally, the appearance of two characteristic peaks corresponding to dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen in the XPS spectrum of O 1s is considered to be a prominent feature of oxygen vacancies present in the perovskite oxides. In addition, the concentration of oxygen vacancies can be indirectly estimated by the relative peak intensity ratios (Rpeaks) between metal–oxygen bonds and the sum of dangling bonds and adsorbed oxygen:33 (4)
Among them, IO–M represents the peak intensity of metal–oxygen bonds, IDL represents the peak intensity of dangling bonds, and IADS represents the peak intensity of surface adsorbed oxygen.
As shown in Table 1, the calculated Rpeaks of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 are 0.361, 0.416 and 0.513, respectively. It means that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in BSFNO films from low to high is BSFNO-1 < BSFNO-2 < BSFNO-3 (shown in Fig. 6c), which is well consistent with the results and analysis of the leakage conductance and Urbach energy EU (see Fig. 7). Briefly, the XPS results confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies in all BSFNO films. In addition, BSLNO-1 film has the least oxygen vacancy, while the BSFNO-3 film has the most oxygen vacancy (Fig. 6c), which is basically the same as the previous leakage conductance results (Fig. 4). At the same time, it means that the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancy can be achieved in the BSFNO-g gradient-doping structure (BSFNO-1/BSFNO-2/BSFNO-3), which will directly affect the electrical and photovoltaic properties of these films.
 Fig. 7  (a) Reflectance spectra and (b) Urbach energy fitting curves of BSFNO thin films. 

Fig. 7 shows the reflectance spectra of BSFNO thin films. As shown in the inset in Fig. 7a, the energy value at the intersection of the curve and the abscissa is an estimate of bandgap (Eg) obtained by linear extrapolation. The bandgaps of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, and BSFNO-3 films are roughly estimated to be 2.65, 2.66 and 2.68 eV, respectively (as shown in Table 2). They are almost the same as the forbidden bandwidth of pure BiFeO3 (Eg ∼ 2.70 eV), implying that ion doping has little effect on its bandgap and thus no obvious enhancement in light absorption. Therefore, it has a very limited impact on the photovoltaic performance of BiFeO3. The Urbach energy EU, corresponding to the interband energy levels near the conduction band, is closely related to various sources of disorder. Therefore, the lattice defects of the films can be reflected in the tail of the absorption band and characterized by Urbach energy (EU). The lower the Urbach energy value, the fewer defects or impurities are in BiFeO3-based films, which reveals the lower leakage conductance and the better ferroelectric performance of the films. The Urbach energy near the absorption edge is determined by lnF(R) = hν/EU,34–36 where EU is the Urbach energy and hν is the photon energy. It can be seen that lnF(R) is linearly related to the photon energy near the absorption edge, and Urbach energy is the inverse of the slope of this linear part. As shown in Fig. 7b, Urbach energy values for BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, and BSFNO-3 films are estimated to be 0.09, 0.11, and 0.19 eV. The lowest value of Urbach energy further confirms that BSFNO-1 film has the fewest oxygen vacancies as well as the lowest leakage current. This conclusion is well consistent with the previous analysis on the leakage conductance and XPS results.

As mentioned above, the intrinsic ferroelectric nature of BSFNO films should be preserved since they maintain the crystalline structure of the parent phase BiFeO3, confirmed by XRD results and Raman spectra. Nevertheless, BSFNO films exhibited severe leakage conductance characteristics as shown in Fig. 4, which should be attributed to the existence of abundant oxygen vacancies in these films revealed by the Urbach energy and XPS analysis. Therefore, the gradient-doped BSFNO-g thin film exhibited poor ferroelectric performance due to large leakage possibly derived from oxygen vacancies (see Fig. S1 and relative analysis for the ferroelectric properties of BSFNO-g thin film in the ESI†). It is known that a prerequisite for the depolarization field to work in ferroelectric film is that the film must exhibit good ferroelectric properties.18 In this case, the effect of the depolarization field on the photovoltaic performance of BSFNO-g thin film could be negligible due to its poor ferroelectric performance.

3.3 Photovoltaic properties and their internal mechanisms

Fig. 8 shows the photovoltaic properties of (Sm and Ni) co-doped BiFeO3 thin films. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the order of short-circuit current density (Jsc) from small to large is BSFNO-1 < BSFNO-2 < BSFNO-3 < BSFNO-g. It is obvious that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the gradient-doped BSFNO-g thin film is greatly enhanced. For example, Jsc of BSFNO-1 is only 17 μA cm−2, while it increases up to 80 μA cm−2 for the gradient-doped BSFNO-g film. Compared with the former, it has increased by as much as 4.7 times. It should be mentioned that pure BiFeO3 thin film had a photocurrent density of only 11 μA cm−2 in our previous study.20 At the same time, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of BSFMO-g is also significantly higher than that of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2, and BSFNO-3 films. As shown in Fig. 8(b), Voc of the gradient-doped BSFNO-g film (0.49 V) is nearly 10 times higher than that of BSFNO-1 (0.05 V). Likewise, Voc of pure BiFeO3 film is only 0.02 V in a previous study,20 and all photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3.

According to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) formula of solar cells:37 (5)
Among them, Isc is the short-circuit current (Isc = Jsc× S), Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Pin is the input light power, and FF is the fill factor.
The simultaneous increase in both the photocurrent density Jsc and the open-circuit voltage Voc of the BSFNO-g film implies that its power conversion efficiency should be greatly improved, which will promote the practical application of BiFeO3-based films as the photovoltaic devices.
Meanwhile, BSFNO-g film was subjected to photovoltaic durability tests for up to 1800 s (30 min). As shown in Fig. 8c, Jsc of BSFNO-g film remained almost unchanged after the 1800 s long measurement. The durability test results show that BSFNO-g thin film has excellent stability and repeatability, which will also contribute to its reliable application in photovoltaic devices.
Combining the above experimental data and analysis, a possible underlying mechanism was proposed to elucidate the enhanced photovoltaic performance in the gradient-doped BiFeO3 thin film (BSFNO-g). Fig. 9a shows a schematic diagram for the band structure of the conventionally doped BiFeO3 thin film (i.e., BSFNO-1). φAu (5.1 eV) is the work function of Au, referring to the spatial distance between the vacuum level E0 and the Fermi level Ef. φFTO (4.4 eV) and φBFO (∼4.65 eV) are the work functions of FTO and BiFeO3 film, respectively. Because φBFO (∼4.65 eV) is smaller than φAu (5.1 eV), the energy band bends upward at the metal–semiconductor (BSFNO-1/Au) interface. Conversely, the band bends down at the BSFNO-1/FTO interface. In this way, negative charges (−) will accumulate at the BSFNO-1/Au interface, and positive charges (+) will accumulate at the BSFNO-1/FTO interface. In short, the whole device forms a built-in electric field Ebi-S (the electric field direction is directed from the FTO to Au, so-called the Schottky barrier electric field). Under the irradiation of light, the photogenerated carriers (electrons and holes) generated in the BSFNO-1 film are accelerated and separated under the action of the built-in electric field Ebi-S, and then reach the interface of BSFNO-1/Au or BSFNO-1/FTO to form photocurrent. However, this built-in electric field Ebi-S, being proportional to the work function difference between the top and bottom electrodes (φAu − φFTO = 0.7 eV), appears to be very weak. Therefore, the photovoltaic performances of BSFNO-x (x = 1, 2, and 3) thin films are not remarkable.
 Fig. 9  Energy band diagrams of (a) conventionally doped sample (BSFNO-1) and (b) gradient-doped sample (BSFNO-g). 

Fig. 9b presents a schematic diagram for the band structure of the gradient-doped BiFeO3 thin film (BSFNO-g). In this multilayer sample, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the top layer of BSFNO-1 is the smallest, while it is the largest in the bottom layer of BSFNO-3. That is, more oxygen vacancies accumulated on the side between the bottom layer of BSFNO-3 and the FTO electrode, while fewer oxygen vacancies existed on the side between the top layer of BSFNO-1 and the Au electrode. Subsequently, a gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies naturally arises throughout the photovoltaic device. Apparently, the built-in electric field Ebi-S in the monolayer sample such as BSFNO-1 mainly originates from the work function difference between the top and bottom electrodes (Schottky barrier). As shown in Fig. 9a, oxygen vacancies exist and are uniformly distributed in the monolayer film without the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies, which cannot bring about an additional built-in electric field. However, for the gradient-doped multilayer BiFeO3 film (BSFNO-g), the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies presented in the film brings another built-in field Ebi-gv, as shown in Fig. 9b. Fortunately, the direction of this built-in electric field Ebi-gv in the BSFNO-g architecture is from the FTO bottom electrode to the Au top electrode, which is well consistent with the direction of previous Ebi-S. This means that the total built-in electric field (Ebi) in the BSFNO-g device is the sum of Ebi-gv and Ebi-S (Ebi = Ebi-gv + Ebi-S). In other words, the total built-in electric field Ebi in the BSFNO-g film is greatly enhanced. Therefore, the gradient distribution of oxygen vacancies produces a larger built-in electric field in the BSFNO-g sample, which further enhances the separation ability of photogenerated carriers and in turn, improves the photovoltaic properties (photocurrent and photovoltage) of this device.
In fact, a scenario of band bending might more vividly illustrate the effect of oxygen vacancy gradient distribution on the photovoltaic properties of BSFNO-g film. As mentioned earlier, in a uniform monolayer BSFNO-1 film, the energy bands at the electrode-semiconductor interfaces bend upwards or downwards due to their different work functions. However, for the gradient-doped multilayer BSFNO-g film, the magnitude of the band bending presenting in the interface between the BSFNO-3 bottom layer (oxygen vacancies-rich) and FTO, should be larger than that between the BSFNO-1 top layer (oxygen vacancies-poor) and Au. In other words, the band bending in the interface becomes much larger, because more oxygen vacancies (positively charged) accumulation increases the barrier height on that side. Therefore, the oxygen vacancy gradient distribution further strengthens the band-bending amplitude difference between the top and bottom interfaces in the BSFNO-g film. As shown in Fig. 9a, En is the distance between the Fermi level Ef and the valence band (EV), and qVd is the distance between the top position of the band bend and the valence band (EV).5,38,39 Obviously, qVd2 in the gradient-doped multilayer BSFNO-g film (Fig. 9b) is much larger than qVd1 in the monolayer BSFNO-1 film (Fig. 9a), because the former has a larger band bending amplitude due to the oxygen vacancy gradient distribution. The increased band-bending amplitude difference between the top and bottom interfaces (qVd2 > qVd1) is bound to strengthen the built-in field Ebi across the entire ferroelectric film, thereby enhancing the separation ability of photogenerated carriers. Therefore, the stronger band bending induced by the oxygen vacancy gradient distribution leads to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of BSFNO-g film.
More recently, the flexoelectric effect in BiFeO3 film has attracted more attention. The flexoelectricity appearing in BiFeO3 can well control the vacancy structure (oxygen vacancy, VO), which finally tunes the related functional properties of BiFeO3 film. Furthermore, continuously controllable photoconductivity can be achieved in free-standing BiFeO3 through the coupling between the flexoelectric and the ferroelectric photovoltaic effect.40–45 In our photovoltaic device structure, (Sm and Ni) co-doping leads to a continual change in the unit cell volume of BiFeO3. As shown in Fig. 10, as the doping concentration of Sm increases, the unit cell volume of the doped BiFeO3 decreases continuously because the ionic radius of Sm3+ (1.08 Å) is smaller than that of Bi3+ (1.17 Å). Based on the fine-fitting analysis of XRD patterns as shown in Table 4, the unit cell volumes of BSFNO-1, BSFNO-2 and BSFNO-3 were calculated to be 58.49(1), 57.39(1) and 56.47(9) Å3, respectively (using a pseudo-cubic unit cell form with the lattice parameters of  and , where aH and cH are the hexagonal lattice parameters of BSFNO thin film). Obviously, the gradient-doped multilayer BSFNO-g thin film (BSFNO-1/BSFNO-2/BSFNO-3) will show a trend of gradual lattice shrinkage from top to bottom, as shown in Fig. 10. As a result, this compositional gradient distribution induces a strain gradient in the multilayer BSFNO-g film. It is well known that strain gradient will induce the flexoelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films. In other words, downward flexoelectric polarization Pflexo (directed from Au to FTO electrodes) will appear and penetrate the entire BSFNO-g film. Similar to the depolarization field in ferroelectric materials, the flexoelectric polarization Pflexo can also induce the opposite flexoelectric field Eflexo. Fortunately, Eflexo also has the same orientation (from FTO to Au electrodes) as the above-mentioned built-in electric fields of Ebi-gv and Ebi-S. Therefore, the flexoelectric effect induced by the compositional gradient distribution in BSFNO-g film provides another built-in electric field Eflexo, which will further accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby enhancing the photovoltaic performance of BSFNO-g film.

In fact, the flexoelectric field Eflexo can be roughly estimated on the basis of the Williamson–Hall relationship and expressed as follows:43–45 (6)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr and a are the relative permittivity and lattice constant of the film, e is the electron charge, ∂u/∂z is the strain gradient in the film perpendicular to the FTO substrate (z is to the film-distance from the substrate interface).
In order to obtain the vertical strain gradient “∂u/∂z”, the broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks at several special angles was well analyzed to draw the Williamson–Hall (W–H) diagram (see “estimation of the strain gradient” and Fig. S2 in the ESI† for details).42–45 According to the Williamson–Hall relationship, the vertical strain gradient “∂u/∂z” in the 210 nm-thick BLCFO-g film was estimated to be 0.21 × 105 m−1. Therefore, the flexoelectric field Eflexo in BLCFO-g film is about 0.36 × 105 V m−1. Although the magnitude of this flexoelectric field Eflexo in BLCFO-g film is not as large as ∼106 V m−1 found in epitaxial BiFeO3 films with a large mismatch strain, it is quite sufficient to affect the separation of the photogenerated carriers and thus improve the photovoltaic properties of BLFCO-g thin film.
In spite of the extraordinary photovoltaic properties including anomalous above-band photovoltage and switchable photocurrent, the power conversion efficiency of BiFeO3 still requires significant enhancement regarding its poor photocurrent density. Although many approaches4,14,20,46–50 were developed to improve the photovoltaic output of BiFeO3 film devices by ion doping or construction of heterostructures as shown in Table 5, the results were not so satisfactory. In this case, a stacked ferroelectric photovoltaic device was elaborately constructed using (Sm and Ni) gradient-doped BiFeO3 multilayer films, in which a gradient distribution of the oxygen vacancies and consequently inducing flexoelectric effect were achieved. Ultimately, the integrated additional built-in electric fields (Ebi-gv + Eflexo) derived from the oxygen vacancy concentration gradient and flexoelectric effect intensely enhanced the photocurrent density of BSFNO-g film with no attenuation of the open circuit voltage. It means that the photovoltaic output of the BiFeO3 film device was greatly promoted. Therefore, it is believed that this work might open up a promising route to construct an exquisite multi-layer ferroelectric structure to greatly enhance the photovoltaic output of the BiFeO3-based film device, which should intensely promote its practical application as the photovoltaic devices.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, (Sm and Ni) co-doped BiFeO3-based thin films were prepared by the sol–gel spin-coating process. XRD analysis showed that all samples exhibited a perovskite R3c structure. SEM observation showed that the gradient-doped thin film (BSFNO-g) presented better surface uniformity and higher packing density. Leakage conductance, absorption spectra and XPS analysis confirmed the existence of oxygen vacancy gradient distribution in the BSFNO-g film. Photovoltaic tests showed that gradient-doping significantly improved the photovoltaic performance of the BSFNO-g film. Meanwhile, a novel theoretical model was proposed to explain the possible mechanism for the enhanced photovoltaic properties in the BSFNO-g film, that is, the synergistic effect of three built-in electric fields (Ebi-S induced by the Schottky barrier, Ebi-gv by the oxygen vacancy gradient distribution and the flexoelectric Eflexo by the composition gradient) greatly promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers, thereby ultimately enhancing the photovoltaic output of the gradient-doped BiFeO3 thin-film photovoltaic device. It is believed that this work might open up a promising way to greatly enhance the photovoltaic output of BiFeO3-based thin films by constructing fine-tuned multilayer ferroelectric architectures, which will strongly promote their practical application in photovoltaic devices.
