    , Accepted 10th April 2018First published on 11th April 2018AbstractMixed-organic-cation FA1−xMAxPbI3 perovskites are currently attracting intensive attention for their high photovoltaic performance. However, FA1−xMAxPbI3 usually has an undesired non-perovskite phase leading to a compromised efficiency, and a facile strategy to achieve pure-phase FA1−xMAxPbI3 has been rarely reported. Here, we demonstrate a facile approach to form δ-phase free FA1−xMAxPbI3 using a non-stoichiometric precursor solution. It is found that a small amount of excess methylammonium iodide (MAI) added to the precursor solution has a profound effect on perovskite crystallization during the liquid-to-solid phase transformation. Using an in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy measurement, it is found that the excess MAI can promote the formation of FA1−xMAxPbI3 and facilitate the cation-exchange between organic FA+ and MA+ during the film formation. Based on the optimized pure-phase FA1−xMAxPbI3, the perovskite solar cells exhibit an encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.40%. This study demonstrates a facile method to achieve high performance FA dominating mixed-organic-cation perovskite devices while providing insight into the ion-exchange process during perovskite crystallization.
Introduction
As one of the emerging photovoltaic technologies, the high performance and ease of fabrication of organometal halide perovskite based solar cells (PVSCs) draw tremendous attention in the photovoltaic community.1–5 In seven years, over 22% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs fabricated with a solution process has been realized.6–8 Generally, perovskite has a chemical formula of ABX3, where A is the organic/inorganic cation (A = methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), cesium (Cs+), rubidium (Rb+)), B is the metal cation (B = Pb2+ or Sn2+) and X is the halide anion (X = I−, Br− or Cl−).9 It has been a hot research direction to investigate the impact of different elementary compositions on the opto-electronic properties of perovskite thin films. Although most PVSCs reported to date are based on the composition of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3),10–15 several intrinsic shortcomings limit its competitiveness in solar energy applications. Particularly, the bandgap (∼1.58 eV) is larger than the optimal bandgap (1.34 eV) of a single junction cell deduced by Shockley and Queisser.16,17 More importantly, a phase transition of MAPbI3 occurs once the temperature exceeds 60 °C, which makes MAPbI3 very vulnerable when exposed to actual working conditions.18–20 To alleviate this issue, understanding the role of the organic cations and finding alternatives to overcome the limitations of MA based perovskites are highly desired. As a result, this gives rise to extensive investigations on other organic and inorganic cations, such as FA+ and Cs+,21,22 and the opto-electronic properties of the corresponding perovskite thin films.
Compared with MAPbI3, formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) has a lower bandgap (∼1.48 eV) and better thermal stability. Therefore, FAPbI3 has a more ideal absorption range for single junction cells.23–25 However, considering the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,9 pure FA based perovskites are always accompanied by an unfavorable “yellow” non-perovskite phase (δ-phase) that cannot be eliminated effectively, which is fatal to the performance of PVSCs.26
Recently, it has been found that mixed-organic-cation perovskites (MOCPs), particularly those with mixed cations of MA+ and FA+, can realize an improved photovoltaic performance with a PCE of over 20%.27–30 The MOCPs exhibit combined merits of FA+ and MA+ (low bandgap and high stability at room temperature). Consequently, most reported best-performing PVSCs are based on FA dominating MOCPs.31,32 Despite these intriguing properties, it is challenging to obtain pure phase perovskites in FA dominating MOCPs. In the presence of a high content of FA+, the formation of the δ-phase is more thermodynamically favorable. Therefore, the resulting MOCPs always consist of both a photovoltaic active perovskite-phase and a photovoltaic inactive δ-phase.33 Typically, high annealing temperature (≥150 °C) is required to eliminate the δ-phase. However, the fast nucleation of the perovskite crystal at such high temperature would largely increase the surface roughness of the perovskite film.31,34–36 Several investigations on the nucleation process and approaches to obtain high-quality MOCP thin films have been recently reported.34,37,38 It is proposed that the larger ionic size of FA+ (2.79 Å), as compared to that of MA+ (2.70 Å), makes the penetration of FA+ into the PbI6 octahedral framework kinetically unfavorable, which is responsible for the undesired film quality.31 Qiu et al. reported a modified two-step method that allows sufficient inter-diffusion of organic cations into the octahedral framework to prepare pure-phase MOCPs.39 For the two-step method, the amount and composition of organic cations that can finally be incorporated into the inorganic PbX6 (X = I−, Br−, Cl−) octahedral framework are determined by the intercalation capabilities of the organic cations. However, the solution dripped for the inter-diffusion process always contains an excess amount of mixed-organic-cations39,40 and it is therefore still challenging to precisely control the chemical composition of the resulting perovskite film. By contrast, the one-step deposition method is more capable of precisely controlling the perovskite composition. However, as mentioned above, in FA dominating perovskite, the resulting perovskite is usually accompanied by an undesired δ-phase. To stabilize the α-phase, a smaller cation Cs+ or smaller halide Br− is intentionally incorporated into FA dominating MOCPs, tuning the Goldschmidt tolerance factor to a more desired value.38 Although the incorporation of Cs or Br can stabilize the MOCPs with a pure α-phase, it inevitably causes an increased bandgap and reduced absorption of sunlight. Until now, synthesizing FA dominating MOCPs with a pure α-phase while simultaneously maintaining their low band gap remains an attractive yet challenging issue.9,41 Very recently, Pang et al. reported pure phase MOCPs fabricated with a non-stoichiometric precursor solution (NSPS), which can inhibit the δ-phase via methylammonium-mediation (MAM).31 Although pure phase MOCPs can be successfully synthesized, it is still not clear how the NSPS affects the crystallization and film formation processes. It is hypothesized that during the annealing process, there is an organic-cation-exchange (OCE) between FA+ and MA+ which facilitates the formation of phase-pure MOCP films. In fact, understanding the interplay between the cations and anions at the early stage of perovskite crystallization is of both high scientific and application values.
Here, we report an investigation of the impact of NSPS on the early stage of perovskite crystallization and film formation using in situ PL measurement during the liquid-to-solid phase transformation. We have found that NSPS with even a low doping ratio (≤0.15) of excess MAI can efficiently eliminate the δ-phase in the resulting perovskite films at low temperature. Different from the previously reported hypothesis that the OCE occurs during the annealing process, we found that the OCE process between FA+ and MA+ takes place during the liquid-to-solid phase transformation immediately after the deposition of the precursor solution. This is evidenced by the temporal evolution of PL peak transition from MAPbI3 to FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 in the first 2 minutes before the thermal annealing process. In addition, owing to the low doping ratio of excess MAI, no residual MAI remains in the resulting perovskite film. These potential advantages guarantee a shorter annealing time (10 min) and lower annealing temperature (130 °C). The as-prepared highly crystallized FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 film consequently gives rise to an impressive PCE of 17.4%.
Experimental section
Film synthesis
All perovskite precursor materials i.e., formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp., Dyesol and Acros Organics, respectively. PC61BM and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) were purchased from Nano-c and Luminescence Technology, respectively. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as received.
For stoichiometric precursor solution (SPS), the FAI, MAI and PbI2 were mixed together at a mole ratio of 0.85:0.15:1 (146.2 mg:23.85 mg:461 mg) in DMF and DMSO (1 mL:78 μL). For NSPS, the FAI, MAI and PbI2 were mixed together at a mole ratio of 0.85:0.15 + x:1 (146.2 mg:23.85 + 159x mg:461 mg) in DMF and DMSO (1 mL:78 μL). PC61BM was dissolved in CB at a concentration of 25 mg mL−1.
Device fabrication
The pre-patterned FTO surface was cleaned sequentially with Decon 90, ethanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath, followed by drying in an oven. The as cleaned FTO was exposed to UV-ozone for about 20 min. Then a NiO layer was deposited on the FTO substrates as reported before.42 For perovskite films, the precursor solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s, and at the 8th second of the spin-coating 200 μL anti-solvent of toluene was rapidly poured onto the perovskite precursor film. After spin-coating, the MOCPs were annealed on a hot plate at 130 °C for 10 min while immediately dropping 15 μL DMF at the edge of a Petri dish which was atop the perovskite precursor film at the beginning of thermal annealing. After the annealing process, PC61BM layers were spin-coated atop the MOCPs at 2000 rpm for 30 s. It should be noted that MOCP and PC61BM depositions were conducted in a well-controlled glovebox with both oxygen (O2) and moisture levels under 1.0 ppm. It is followed by the deposition of a hole-blocking layer (BCP, 5 nm) and an electrode layer (Ag, 80 nm) on top of the perovskite film by thermal evaporation. The active area was determined by the overlap between two electrodes to be 0.1 cm2.
Characterization
Perovskite film morphology evolution was studied using a Carl Zeiss Supra 55 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Cypher S atomic force microscope (AFM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a D2 Phaser instrument using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation to investigate the perovskite crystal structure. PL profiles were recorded on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer and in situ PL spectra were characterized with home-built equipment. An excitation laser (315 nm) was introduced to the sample through a fibre, and the PL spectra were detected by using a detector connected with an Ocean Optics USB2000; the equipment is shown in Fig. 3a. UV-Vis absorption spectra were acquired on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 2S UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were monitored with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was tested by using home-built equipment and the details of the set up can be found in our previous work.43 Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement was carried out with a time correlated single photon counting spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980) and the samples were excited using a 480 nm laser beam.
Results and discussion
Owing to the profound effect of excess organic cations on the perovskite crystallization and film formation, we suspect that even a small amount of excess MAI would have a large impact on the structural properties of the resulting perovskite films via OCE. Firstly, we prepared FA0.85MAxPbI3 precursor solutions with stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric ratios of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 (higher MAI content), respectively. Different from the film prepared with FA0.85MA0.15PbI3, the film prepared with excess MAI has an obvious color change immediately after spin-coating (Fig. 1e–h). This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that even a small amount of excess MAI can largely affect the perovskite nucleation and growth.

We sought to further investigate the impact of excess MAI on the crystallization of the perovskite under various processing conditions. As shown in Fig. 2a, only the δ-phase appears in the as-prepared film of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3. After annealing at 130 °C for 2 min, only a small intensity α peak can be observed. Further annealing the film for 10 min, the α peak becomes much stronger. However, the δ-phase still cannot be completely eliminated. This observation of MOCP prepared with SPS is consistent with other reports.40 On the other hand, for the film prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 with excess MAI as shown in Fig. 2b, a predominant peak corresponding to the α-phase of the MOCP is observed even without thermal annealing. This unannealed film has only a small δ-phase peak located at 11.8°. The δ-phase peak disappeared once the films were annealed for 2 or 10 min at 130 °C, indicating the formation of pure α-phase MOCP. It has been reported that MA+ has a smaller molecular size than FA+, which makes it much easier to penetrate into the PbI6 framework at the early stage of crystallization.31,44 Then, FA+ will replace MA+ during the thermal annealing process. Therefore, a shift of the main perovskite diffraction peak at around 14° is expected in such an OCE process. Interestingly, such XRD peak shift has not been observed as shown in Fig. S1.† Therefore, this suggests that the film prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 should have the same perovskite structural composition during the crystal growth under the annealing process. Thus, we speculate that the OCE between FA+ and MA+ cations with excess MAI already takes place at the early stage of the liquid-to-solid transition right after the spin-coating process.

To further verify the effect of excess MAI, the UV-Vis spectra of the respective MOCPs (FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.85MA0.3PbI3) prepared with different annealing processes were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, both FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 films annealed for 2 min and 10 min exhibit an identical absorption edge at around 820 nm. This is same as the case for FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 annealed for 10 min, suggesting that all the MOCPs have the same perovskite composition. Furthermore, the absorbance intensity of MOCP FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 (without annealing) increases largely around 450 nm (Fig. 2c), which is mainly contributed to the absorption of the δ-phase.31 This observation is consistent with the yellowish color as shown in Fig. 1a–d. In contrast, the MOCP FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 prepared without annealing already has an absorption edge around 810 nm, which further confirms that the excess MAI indeed facilitates the formation of the perovskite phase in the early stage of crystallization. It is worth mentioning that the absorption edge of MOCP FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 without annealing is not as sharp as that of FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 prepared at 130 °C. This suggests that the weaker absorption edge might be caused by the coexistence of the δ-phase, α-phase, and other possible compositions.
It is worth noting that both XRD and UV-Vis have limitations on understanding the early stage of the crystallization process. Particularly, ion exchange and chemical reactions at this stage take place mainly with materials in the amorphous phase. To confirm the above speculation and investigate the early stage chemical reaction process, we developed an in situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurement (Fig. 3a) to monitor the PL of materials during the liquid-to-solid transition right after the spin-coating process. As shown in Fig. 3b, the film prepared with SPS FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 exhibits broad PL spectra peaked at ∼1.97 eV. The PL spectra remain almost the same with respect to the increased time. Interestingly, the broad PL spectrum should neither belong to the δ-phase nor the α-phase, as a much smaller FWHM would be expected for any crystalline phase. Such a broad spectrum should have originated from other chemical compositions in the amorphous phase, which have never been reported in the literature with regard to the perovskite crystallization process. On the other hand, in the case of the film prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 as shown in Fig. 3c, the PL spectrum right after spin-coating (0 s) already assembles the characteristics of MAPbI3 with the peak position at ∼1.59 eV.45 Gradually, the peak position shifts to lower energy, indicating a decrease in the bandgap. This is due to the FA+ replacing MA+ in the perovskite structure. Finally, the peak position is almost similar to that of pure FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 (∼1.51 eV, Fig. S2†). The above results confirm that the ion exchange process with excess MAI occurs at the early stage of the liquid-to-solid state transformation.

Combining the above results, different crystallization processes during the liquid-to-solid state transformation of MOCPs prepared with SPS and NSPS are proposed as illustrated in Fig. 3d and e. In the case of using SPS, as the FA+ content is dominant and the δ-phase (FA0.85MA0.15PbI3) formation is more thermodynamically favorable, FA+ firstly coordinates into the PbI6 framework to form the δ-phase perovskite. Additional energy with thermal annealing is required to achieve phase transformation from the δ-phase to the α-phase. In the case of using NSPS, the MA+ with a higher concentration competes with FA+ to coordinate into PbI6. As a result, both the α-phase (MAPbI3) and δ-phase (FA0.85MA0.15PbI3) co-exist in the resulting perovskite film. Upon thermal annealing, the uncoordinated residual FA+ ions gain additional activation energy to replace MA+ in the α-phase perovskite framework. According to the above results, the activation energy for phase transformation from the δ-phase to the α-phase is higher than that required for the OCE process of FA+ replacing MA+. To make further comparison between the activation energy for phase transformation from the δ-phase to the α-phase and the energy of FA+ replacing MA+ in the OCE process, XRD and UV-Vis characterization processes were conducted on films prepared with the precursor solutions of FAPbI3 and FAPbI3·0.3MAI (a doping ratio of 0.3 of excess MAI) respectively. All the films were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† As demonstrated in the XRD result, only the δ-phase appeared in the film prepared with the precursor solution of FAPbI3, which is consistent with the previous report that high annealing temperature (160 °C) is needed to achieve a pure perovskite phase of FAPbI3.46 However, when it comes to the film prepared with the precursor solution of FAPbI3·0.3MAI a high intensity of the perovskite peak (α-phase) is shown, and we ascribe this to the OCE process between FA+ and MA+. To confirm the composition of the perovskite, UV-Vis measurement was conducted on the films, and the absorption edge (838 nm) of the film prepared with the precursor solution of FAPbI3·0.3MAI indicates the composition of FAPbI3 which has a bandgap of 1.48 eV. The relatively low annealing temperature (130 °C) to achieve the perovskite phase transition of the film prepared with the precursor solution of FAPbI3·0.3MAI compared with that of the film prepared with the precursor solution of FAPbI3 (160 °C) hints that the activation energy for phase transformation from the δ-phase to the α-phase is higher than that required for the OCE process of FA+ replacing MA+. This brings insight into the interplays between the ion concentration and phase transition in the crystallization of such organometal halide perovskite systems. Detailed reaction kinetics requires more in-depth theoretical and experimental investigations. Furthermore, to explore the dependence of the PCE on the annealing time we prepared devices adopting NSPS FA0.85MA0.3PbI3 with different annealing times (3, 5, 8 and 10 min) in the same batch, and the device performance is summarised in Table S1.† The XRD and SEM tests of the films were also conducted (Fig. S4†). Since, XRD has its limitation on detecting the excess MAI inside the MOCPs, no MAI peak appeared in the XRD results. It is illustrated that the MOCPs annealed for 8 and 10 min, respectively, exhibit consistently high crystallinity (XRD) and similar surface morphology (SEM), and the devices based on these MOCPs demonstrate similar performance. All these observations suggest that 10 min thermal annealing should be enough for the device to achieve its intrinsic performance, and the effect of excess MAI could be ignored. Moreover, as shown in the XRD and SEM results, the XRD intensity and the grain size gradually increased with the annealing time extended from 3 to 8 min. Thus, although a pure perovskite phase (XRD) can be achieved only after 3 min of thermal annealing, the crystallization process of the film is still in a progressing phase. The unfinished crystallization of the film will also compromise on the device performance. Consequently, after 10 min of thermal annealing, the effect of excess MAI could be ignored, and the poor performance of devices, adopting a shorter annealing time, is affected by the remaining excess MAI and the crystallinity of the perovskite film.
In order to investigate the detrimental effect of the δ-phase on the opto-electronic properties of the perovskite films, we measured the time-resolved PL (TRPL) on the perovskite films prepared with different NSPSs. Fig. 4a shows the XRD spectra of the corresponding MOCPs with MAI content increasing from 0.15 to 0.30. The δ-phase can be mostly eliminated even by adding a small amount of excess MAI in the precursor solution (FA0.85MA0.17PbI3). Further increasing the MAI content to 0.2, the δ-phase is completely disappeared, and the morphology of MOCP also becomes homogeneous as shown in the SEM (Fig. S5†) and AFM (Fig. S6†) images. Fig. 4c shows the TRPL of different MOCPs measured at the emission peak at 820 nm. The PL lifetime of the MOCPs significantly increases from 144.0 ns for the film prepared with SPS to 522.0 ns for that prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.2PbI3. Both the above results (XRD and TRPL) further confirm that the NSPS with excess MAI can maintain the pure phase of MOCPs with reduced recombination in the resulting perovskite films. It should be mentioned that MACl can also be adopted for the OCE process; however, as reported by previous work the introduction of Cl− will complicate the OCE process and further study is still needed.31,47–49

(c) Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the corresponding MOCPs; the peak emission is 820 nm. 
Finally, inverted planar heterojunction PVSCs were fabricated with a device structure of FTO/NiO/perovskite film/PC61BM/BCP/Ag. Compared with the control device prepared with SPS, all the devices adopting NSPS exhibit higher PCEs. The device performances are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 1. As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, all devices prepared with different precursor solutions exhibit the same EQE onset, indicating that the MOCPs have the same bandgap. A champion PCE of 17.4% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 22.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, and a high fill factor (FF) of 78.5% was achieved with an optimized perovskite layer prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.2PbI3. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectra is in agreement with that determined by J–V measurement. The statistical photovoltaic parameters of at least 12 devices in each case are summarized in Fig. 5c–f. The improvement in performance is mainly due to the improvement of FF from 65% to 75%. As FF is largely affected by carrier recombination, the difference in device performance is in agreement with the increased TRPL lifetime in NSPS with the eliminated δ-phase.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile non-stoichiometric precursor solution method is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of phase-pure mixed-organic-cation perovskites at low temperature. It is found that even a small amount of excess MAI has a profound effect on the perovskite crystallization during the early stage of liquid-to-solid phase transformation. Using an in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy measurement, it is confirmed that cation-exchange occurred in liquid-to-solid phase transformation. Benefiting from the pure perovskite phase with reduced recombination, a high PCE of 17.4% was obtained for the device prepared with NSPS FA0.85MA0.2PbI3. Our work not only demonstrates NSPS as a facile method to achieve phase-pure MOCPs, but also provides an in-depth understanding of the cation exchange process in perovskite crystal formation.
