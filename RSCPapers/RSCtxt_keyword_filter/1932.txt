    , Accepted 15th January 2015First published on 15th January 2015AbstractWe report two new triarylamine-cyanoacrylic acid based push–pull dyes, X76 and X77, featuring the π-conjugated linkers of dihexyl- and dihexyloxybenzene-substituted dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]thieno[3,2-b:3′,2′-b′]dipyrrole (DTDP), respectively. The absorption, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties for all sensitizers have been systematically investigated. Both dyes containing a DTDP moiety showed good light harvesting ability as compared to that of the reference dye incorporating the hexyl-substituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) linker. Moreover, the substituents of DTDP moiety significantly influenced the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the X77-based device is higher at longer wavelengths, and extends to nearly 800 nm. A dye-sensitized solar cell employing the X77 photosensitizer and the Co-bpy electrolyte exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 6.6% measured under the 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 sunlight.
Introduction
Recent development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) opens an attractive route for the realization of a cheap alternative to today's commercially available solar technologies.1 Organometallic dyes of ruthenium polypyridine2 and zinc porphyrin complexes3 have been demonstrated as efficient light-harvesters for DSCs. These devices have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiency of 10–13% under standard air mass 1.5 G illumination.2,3 Recently, donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) organic sensitizers have drawn considerable attention4–18 as sensitizers as a result of the abundance of raw materials, the flexibility of molecular design, and the strong light harvesting capacity, which currently reaches more than 12% PCE.19
Based on this model, aromatic heterocycles have been introduced as coplanar π-linkers. Key developments on coplanar π-linkers involved (i) enhancing the delocalization capacity of π-electrons, resulting in a reduced molecular energy gap to enhance light harvesting; (ii) tuning steric and/or electronic structures of substituents on π-linkers to modulate the physicochemical characteristics of organic dyes. In this regard, fused-ring thiophenes have been widely exploited as crucial building blocks for organic dyes, including thienothiophenes,20 benzodithiophenes (BTD),21 dithienothiophenes,22 cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),23 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS),24 naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene,25 indeno[1,2-b]thiophene,26 and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP).27–29 Apart from these simple fused thiophenes, multifused thiophenes, such as dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT),30 indacenodithiophene (InDT),31 cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene[2′,1′:4,5]thieno-[2,3-d]thiophene (CPDTTT)32 and dithieno[2,3-a:3′,2′-c]phenazine33 used for organic dyes, were also reported. As demonstrated in these works, better π-conjugation can be readily achieved by increasing the coplanarity of bridged π-systems.
In the previous work, we introduced a series of DTP segments in organic dyes, resulting in good photovoltaic performance.29 In this contribution, we extended our studies on this line by employing dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]thieno[3,2-b:3′,2′-b′]dipyrrole (DTDP) as the conjugated linker. Two new DTDP linkers, i.e., dihexyl- and dihexyloxybenzene-substituted DTDP, were synthesized for X76 and X77, respectively (Fig. 1). To further assess the merit of both multifused thiophenes in terms of light absorption, we also prepared its counterpart C241 (Fig. 1) featuring the DTP bridge as a reference.

Experimental
Materials and instruments
The synthetic routes for dyes X76/77 are shown in Scheme 1. Pd2(dba)3, dppf, Pd(PPh3)4, t-BuONa and cyanoacetic acid were purchased from Energy Chemical (China). 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were purchased from Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide was dried over and distilled from CaH2 under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Phosphorus oxychloride was freshly distilled before use. Dichloromethane was distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen atmosphere. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of the studied dyes. 

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-300 or AM-400 spectrometer. The reported chemical shifts were against TMS. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained with a Micromass GCT-TOF mass spectrometer. The melting point was taken on a RY-1 thermometer, and temperatures were uncorrected.
Optical and electrochemical measurements
The absorption spectra of dyes and sensitized films were measured by a SHIMADZU UV-2600 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a HITACHI F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for sensitized films were performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany), with sensitized electrodes as the working electrode, Pt-wires as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 M) and MeCN were used as the supporting electrolyte and solvent, respectively. The results were calibrated using ferrocene as the standard.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range from 200 mHz to 100 kHz was performed with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany) in the dark with the alternate current amplitude set at 10 mV.
Charge densities at open circuit and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Germany), which includes a green light emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and the corresponding control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 5 to 75 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
Fabrication and characterization of DSCs
The TiO2 paste (particle size, 20 nm) was printed on a conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Hyogo, Japan, fluorine-doped SnO2 over layer, sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq.−1) using a screen printing technique. The film was dried in air at 120 °C for 30 min and calcined at 500 °C for 30 min under flowing oxygen before cooling to room temperature. The heated electrodes were impregnated with a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride solution in a water-saturated desiccator at 70 °C for 30 min and fired again to give a ca. 3 μm (for cobalt cells) or 9 μm (for iodine cells) thick mesoscopic TiO2 film. The TiO2 electrode was stained by immersing it into a 0.3 mM dye solution in a mixture of DCM–EtOH (v/v, 1:1) and keeping it at room temperature for 12 hours. The sensitized electrodes were then rinsed with dry ethanol and dried by a dry air flow. The Pt catalyst was deposited on the FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (40 mM in ethanol) with the heat treatment at 395 °C for 15 min to give a photoanode. The sensitized electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell by a 25 μm thick Surlyn (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The Co-bpy electrolyte is composed of 0.25 M [Co(II)(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.05 M [Co(III)(bpy)3](PF6)3, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. For comparison, an iodine electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile was formulated.
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were carried out using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter controlled by a computer and a standard AM1.5 solar simulator-Oriel 91160-1000 (300 W) SOLAR SIMULATOR 2 × 2 BEAM. The light intensity was calibrated by an Oriel reference solar cell. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.2 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cell were performed by using a commercial setup (QTest Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System, CROWNTECH, USA).

Results and discussion
UV-vis absorption properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes in CH2Cl2 solutions are depicted in Fig. 2a. The optical and electrochemical properties of the dyes are summarized in Table 1. Both dyes exhibit an intense absorption peak, which can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions from the triarylamine donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. The X76 and X77 dye presents a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of 562 and 560 nm, respectively. It is apparent that with respect to the C241 dye (λmax = 525 nm), X76 and X77 with multifused thiophenes present notably red-shifts of the maximum visible absorption wavelength (λmax) by 35–37 nm and an enhanced maximum molar visible absorption coefficient. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye-loaded TiO2 films (∼3 μm), shown in Fig. 2b, display the same trend for the absorption maxima as those for the absorption in solution. The light-harvesting capacities of devices based on the three dyes were compared by recording the UV-visible absorption spectra of 3 μm thick, dye-coated titania films in contact with a Co-bpy electrolyte for cell fabrication (Fig. 2c). Note that X76/77 sensitized solar cells possess a broader and stronger photoresponse in the visible region of 550–750 nm in comparison with those of C241, indicative of the more powerful light harvesting capability.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammogram measurements of dye sensitized films (Fig. 3a) were first surveyed to determine the accurate ED/D+ values of the dyes (Table 1) by averaging the anodic and cathodic peak potentials. TiO2 films stained with sensitizers (150 μM dye solution) on FTO functioned as the working electrode in a solution of TBAP (0.1 M) in acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The oxidation potentials (ED/D+, taken as the HOMO levels of the dyes) of X76 and X77 were measured to be 0.71 and 0.77 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The excited state reduction potentials (ED*/D+, taken as the LUMO levels of the dyes) of X76 and X77 were obtained from the redox potentials and the zero–zero transition energies (E0–0), and the values are calculated to be −1.34 and −1.27 V, respectively. Overall, replacing the conjugated π-linker of DTP with DTDP in push–pull dyes to harvest low-energy photons resulted in an upward shift of HOMO (Fig. 3b).

Note that the current intensity of C241 sensitized film (1.03 mA) is 3.67-fold higher than those of X76/77 (around 0.28 mA), sharply contrasting a slight decrease of the X76/77 adsorbed amount. By comparing the absorbance change of a dye solution before and after dye uptaking with a TiO2 film (3 μm), the surface coverage (Γ) of X76, X77 and C241 anchored on TiO2 film was determined to be 5.60 × 10−8, 5.10 × 10−8 and 6.60 × 10−8 mol cm−2, respectively. These results indicate that the intermolecular electronic interaction is stronger for C241 relative to X76/77, which can be attributed to the strong π–π stacking of molecules.35 Therefore, it can be perceived that both DTDP π-linkers in X76/77 are effective in preventing possible intermolecular electronic interactions between two neighboring dye molecules. To understand the structure discrepancy between the DTDP and DTP π-linkers, quantum chemistry calculation with DFT methods were performed. We optimized the molecular structure of X76/77in vacuo. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the two side chains on the DTDP core are found across each other at an angle of 45.2° and 20.1° for X76 and X77, respectively. Furthermore, in the case of X77, the benzene substituents are perpendicular to the DTDP skeleton. Thus, through attachment of the bulky insulating groups, the intermolecular interactions between X76/77 could be weaker than that of C241.

Theoretical calculations
Further insights into the electron distribution of the transition-involved frontier molecular orbitals are depicted in Fig. 5. The HOMO orbital of X76/77 is delocalized over the entire molecule with maximum components on the triarylamine donor, whereas the LUMO orbital is delocalized across the DTDP spacer and cyanoacrylic acid groups with sizable contributions from the latter. The results indicate that the electrons in the donor could be successively transferred to the acceptor part and then injected into the conduction band of TiO2 after being illuminated by light. Note that there are nearly no distributions of these frontier orbitals on the DTDP substituents. The same phenomenon has also been observed in DTP dyes.28,29a Therefore, the hexyl or hexyloxybenzene substituents could be considered insulating spacers, which reduce the intermolecular exciton annihilation in the assembly of dye molecules grafted on the surface of titania.28b

Photovoltaic performance of DSCs

Fig. 6 shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of excitation wavelength for the dye coated titania film in conjunction with an acetonitrile (MeCN) electrolyte containing the tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)cobalt(II)/(III) redox couple. The X76 and X77 cells exhibit a broader IPCE response compared to the C241 counterpart. Such a broader spectral response of X76 and X77 is consistent with the trend of the absorption spectra, implying that both dyes possesses better light harvesting ability for long-wavelength visible light, which would be attributed to the larger DTDP π-system. However, X76 and X77 confers relatively lower IPCEs from 400 to 650 nm, compared to that for C241. It is widely recognized that the IPCE is determined by four factors: light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the injection efficiency of the dye into the conduction band (Φinj), the regeneration efficiency (ηreg) and the collection efficiency (ηcc), which can be expressed as eqn (1): IPCE = LHE(λ)Φinjηregηcc(1)
 Fig. 6  IPCE action spectra of the studied DSCs employing cobalt electrolyte. 
Remembering that these dye sensitized devices display a similar absorption in the visible spectrum between 400–600 nm (Fig. 2c), we can conclude that LHE is not the controlling factor of the IPCE height observed here. In addition, the Φinj is not likely to be responsible for the apparent difference in IPCE, considering the comparable LUMO level and the same anchoring group for these dyes. Therefore, the lower IPCE of X76 and X77 sensitized DSCs could be ascribed to their low regeneration efficiency and charge collection efficiency.
Recently, M. Feldt, et al. demonstrated that high regeneration efficiency can be expected for dyes with driving forces for regeneration (ΔGreg) of above 0.4 eV.36 Lower driving force for dye regeneration will reduce the regeneration efficiency of dyes. As presented in Fig. 3b, the calculated driving force for the regeneration of the X76 and X77 by Co(bpy)32+/3+ (0.56 V vs. NHE) are 0.15 and 0.21 V, respectively. By contrast, C241 possesses a much higher driving force of 0.34 V. In this regard, the small driving force for regeneration of the X76 and X77 may bring them the negative effects in IPCE. However, we could not conclude that less efficient dye-regeneration in devices based on X76/77 plays a role in controlling IPCE; as pointed by the reviewer, more careful experimental examination, such as regeneration kinetic data based on transient absorption spectroscopy, needs to be further performed before making such an argument. On the other hand, charge recombination kinetics measurements revealed that the photocurrents of X76/77 sensitized devices at 1 sun were somewhat limited by charge collection efficiency (see the following section).
The photovoltaic performance of the dyes X76, X77 and C241 was evaluated by using them in DSCs with a redox mediator based on cobalt tris(bipyridine) in acetonitrile. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices under simulated one-sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 7, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of the X76 cell are 8.6 mA cm−2, 710 mV and 0.67, respectively, affording a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.1%. Furthermore, a notably improved JSC of 11.6 mA cm−2 concomitant with an increased VOC of 800 mV was achieved with the X77 dye, contributing to a higher PCE of 6.6%. The key observation here is that a subtle modification of the substituent in DTDP induces strikingly large JSC and VOC improvements. The results indicate that the side chains of multifused thiophenes play a pivotal role in achieving higher power conversion efficiency. Under the same conditions, the dye C241 sensitized solar cells exhibited slightly higher efficiency relative to those of X77 which mainly originates from their higher regeneration efficiency and charge collection efficiency.

To scrutinize the recombination kinetics of these devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the dark. Typical EIS Nyquist plots for DSCs based on the X76, X77 and C241 dyes measured in the dark under a forward bias of −0.7 V are shown in Fig. 8. The equivalent circuit presented in Fig. 8 was used to fit the experimental data of all of the samples. Rs is the series resistance accounting for the transport resistance of the TCO and the electrolyte. Cμ and RCT are the chemical capacitance and the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, respectively. CPt and RPt are the interfacial capacitance and charge transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, respectively. The larger semicircle at lower frequencies represents the interfacial charge transfer resistances (RCT) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The fitted RCT increases in the order of X76 (118 Ω) < X77 (710 Ω) < C241 (2673 Ω), indicating a sequential decrease of the charge recombination rate. Because a decreased charge recombination rate reduces the electron loss at an open circuit, therefore the charge collection efficiency for these devices are in the order C241 > X77 > X76. The smaller RCT value means the electron recombination from the conduction band to the electrolyte occurs more easily and thus results in lower VOC. Obviously, the replacement of the dihexyl-substituted DTDP with the bulky dihexyloxybenzene-substituted DTDP moiety endows dye molecules to form a more favorite organic layer to inhibit the charge recombination at the interface between the redox shuttle and titania.
 Fig. 8  Nyquist plots for DSCs based on the three dyes measured in the dark under −0.7 V bias. Top left corner is the equivalent circuit. 
Furthermore, we can qualitatively discuss the dye regeneration based on the EIS results in view of the fact that competition between dye recombination and dye regeneration determines the performance of a DSC. As we know that recombination with the oxidized sensitizers would limit cell performance if regeneration of the dye fails to compete effectively with the recombination reaction.37 EIS measurements revealed that the charge recombination with the oxidized sensitizers or redox couples in X76/77 sensitized devices is much stronger than that of C241, indicative of a less efficient regeneration of the oxidized sensitizer for X76/77.
The electron lifetime (τ) at open circuit, measured by controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), can be obtained by fitting either the real or the imaginary part of the IMVS response.38 As shown in Fig. 9, the electron lifetime for all the DSCs decreases with charge density following a power law relation. For X76, a shorter electron lifetime has been measured compared to devices incorporating X77 and C241, giving a clear clue regarding its smaller photovoltage and photocurrent. At a fixed Q (6.77 × 1018 cm3), the τ value for X77-based DSCs is larger than that of X76-based DSCs by around 12-fold, which is consistent with the results from EIS measurements. To further understand the influence of introducing the DTDP spacer on charge recombination kinetics at the titania/dye interface, we performed the IMVS measurements of the iodine cells. The iodine electrolyte is composed of 0.6 M DMPImI, 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile. It is valuable to note that, at a fixed Q (3.77 × 1018 cm3), the τ value for X77-based DSCs is larger than that of X76-based DSCs by around 288-fold. The lifetimes of X76-sensitized iodine cells are even lower than those of cobalt cells based on X76, X77 and C241, indicating there could be strong intermolecular interactions between iodine and dihexyl-substituted DTDP spacer.39 Hence, we could arrive at the conclusion that X77 with the dihexyloxybenzene-substituted DTDP spacer is advantageous for the suppression of charge recombination in DSCs when compared to its counterpart X76 with dihexyl-substituted DTDP.

Conclusions
To summarize, by using dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]thieno[3,2-b:3′,2′-b′]dipyrrole as a coplanar core, dihexyloxy-triphenylamine as an electron donor, and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor, we have synthesized two new DTDP dyes for mesoscopic sensitized solar cells. With respect to the DTP dye, both multifused thiophenes present notably red-shifts of the maximum visible absorption wavelength by 35–37 nm and an enhanced maximum molar visible absorption coefficient. The IPCE of the X77-based device is higher at longer wavelengths, and extends to nearly 800 nm, reflecting the better sunlight-harvesting ability of DTDP at longer wavelengths. Furthermore, the double peripheral side chains on the DTDP bridge could serve as a spatial hindrance to mitigate undesirable dye aggregation. It is valuable to note that the substituents on DTDP moiety significantly influenced the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes. EIS and IMVS measurements have disclosed the critical influence of the DTDP substituents upon the electron lifetime of cobalt and iodine devices. The lifetimes of X76 sensitized devices are much lower than those of X77, resulting in a lower cell efficiency. Though the efficiencies of the X77 devices are slightly lower than those of C241, our work indicates that the DTDP moieties are promising candidates for highly efficient organic dyes in light of their good light harvesting ability at longer wavelengths. Rational design of the electron donor of the dyes and the DTDP substituents are possible to tune energetic properties of dyes and abate the adverse interfacial charge recombination in DSCs.
