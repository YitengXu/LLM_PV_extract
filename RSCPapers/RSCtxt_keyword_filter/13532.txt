    , Accepted 27th April 2020First published on 28th April 2020AbstractPbS quantum dots (QDs) were regarded as promising candidates for photoelectric devices because of their high absorption, multiple exciton generation effect and solution processability. However, their low charge carrier transport behavior impedes their wide application. Here, a ligand exchange process was introduced to fabricate PbS-QD + hybrid perovskite photodetectors. The photodetectors show a high sensitivity, low noise current and high stability under visible to near-infrared light illumination. The devices exhibited an impressive responsivity of ∼2 × 106 A W−1 and a high photoconductive gain of ∼3 × 106, respectively, with an applied bias of 5 V. Furthermore, the photodetectors display a large detectivity approaching 1015 Jones and a fast photoresponse up to 1 MHz at room temperature. These great performances suggest that the hybrid perovskite can well passivate the defects of PbS-QDs and provide new insight into the preparation of high-performance nano-devices.
1. Introduction
Lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as promising optoelectronic materials because of their wide absorption range, multiple exciton generation effect and solution processability. Therefore, PbS-QDs have been exploited as active materials for semiconductor nanostructures in new-generation nano-electronic and nano-optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, field-effect transistors (FETs) and photodetectors (PDs).1–5
More recently, PbS-QD based photodetectors have shown more impressive properties, and some advanced techniques have made their potential applications widespread.6–8 However, the low conductivity of the QD device is far from meeting the requirement of high-performance devices. Otherwise, carrier mobility of the QDs is limited due to the severe scattering from a very large number of grain boundaries, together with the length of the organic ligands around the QDs, which decreases carrier diffusion lengths between QDs and causes serious charge recombination.9,10 Several strategies have been proposed to enhance the carrier transfer of the QDs in order to realize widespread application in microelectronics and optoelectronics. For example, impurity doping in colloidal QDs has been considered as a fundamental method in semiconductor technologies and shown great potential, yet it still remains challenging and uncontrollable.11,12 The ligand exchange method is a facile and capable process, yielding a more conductive transfer layer that greatly enhances the usefulness of such QDs in nano-devices.13,14 Specifically, the traditional shorter ligands (i.e., ethanedithiol and mercaptopropionic acid) are usually used to replace the long-chain organic ligand through a substitution reaction, which would shorten the space between particles and improve the transmission performance of QD-devices.15,16 However, the drawbacks of low photoelectric conversion efficiency and weak photocurrent (from nA to μA) will seriously affect the application of QDs.17,18 The novel ligand exchange technique can increase carrier transfer and complement the optical spectrum of PbS-QDs, which will be an effective and facile process to further promote the progress of QD-based photodetectors.19
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites20 (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Br, or Cl) have attracted tremendous attention in the fields of photodetectors, solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs) because of their high carrier mobility, long exciton diffusion length and high conversion efficiency.21–25 In recent studies, hybrid perovskites have been successfully used to passivate the surface of QDs (i.e., PbS, CdS, InP, and CdSe) as a ligand.26 Such PbS-QDs were capped with a hybrid perovskite and then applied in hybrid nanostructured solar cells, achieving an impressive short-circuit current (Jsc) of 24.83 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.28%.19 Lattice match between hybrid perovskites and PbS-QDs could minimize the trap states of QDs by passivating the surface defects due to their octahedral polycrystalline structure on a scale of ∼1 nm, which is small enough to reach the hard-to-access sites of PbS-QDs.27,28 In addition, hybrid perovskite materials can also realize the full spectrum response from the visible spectrum to the near infrared region and high-frequency signals of the detections.29 It is completely possible to complement hybrid perovskites, combined with the excellent photoelectric performance, with PbS-QDs in photoelectric detection, which allows the realization of higher sensitivity, gain and detectivity photodetectors.28,30
In this report, we exploit a hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) decorated with PbS-QDs by using a ligand exchange process to fabricate high-performance photodetectors. The photodetector based on the Au/PbS-QD + hybrid perovskite/Au structure shows a high sensitivity, low noise current and high stability under visible and near-infrared light illumination. In particular, the photodetectors exhibit a large detectivity approaching 1015 Jones and a fast photoresponse up to 1 MHz at room temperature. Our results indicate that the QD-hybrid perovskite structure is a promising candidate for high-performance photodetectors.
2. Experimental section
The synthesis method of PbS-QDs was reported in our previous work.18 To synthesize the hybrid perovskite, PbI2 and methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) were first dissolved in acetonitrile with a molar ratio of 1:1, then heated to 80 °C and kept stirring for 20 min in order to obtain the hybrid perovskite solution (25 wt%). Here we constructed a Au/QD-hybrid perovskite/Au structure to evaluate the photoelectric properties of the photodetector. First, the electrode patterns were defined by photolithography with a spacing of 2 μm on a SiO2 (300 nm)/p+-Si substrate, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). After that Ti (15 nm)/Au (20 nm) electrodes were deposited in sequence by using a high-vacuum electron beam (EB) system following a lift-off process. Second, 50 mg mL−1 PbS-QD/octane solution was spin-coated on the substrates at a speed of 1000 rpm, 30 s. To obtain the composite film (PbS-QDs + hybrid perovskite), 0.75 mL hybrid perovskite solution was used to flush the prepared QD film by spin-coating treatment at a speed of 1000 rpm. Thirdly, two rinsing steps were applied for the film with acetonitrile and then octane for 20 s, and then spin-drying was carried out at 1000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, the substrate was heated at 70 °C for 10 min.
The TEM and HRTEM photographs were recorded on a JEM-2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The absorption spectra were measured by using a Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR 3600 spectrophotometer. The electrical characterization of the PbS-QD devices was performed by using a semiconductor parameter analyzer system (Keithley 4200-SCS) at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was implemented by using a Thermo Escalab-250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was obtained by using a Zolix spectrograph, where illumination was provided by a xenon lamp, with a standard silicon cell (OPRC185Si.QGCALS/N#1138) for comparison. A photodetection system combined laser diodes with a light wavelength of 800 nm, a pulse generator for pulsed light illumination, an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS2012B) for the photoresponse property test, and a lock-in amplifier (SRS, SR-830) for the detectivity (D*) or noise equivalent power (NEP) test.
3 Results and discussion
A typical TEM image of isolated PbS-QDs showed that the average diameter of these PbS-QDs was 3 ± 0.5 nm. The HRTEM image of the obtained nanocrystals revealed well-resolved lattice fringes, which demonstrated that these nanocrystals were single crystalline with high crystallinity (as shown in Fig. 1a). The optical absorption spectrum of the PbS-QDs is shown in Fig. 1b, where a well-defined excitonic peak centered at 930 nm could be observed. The size (d) of the PbS-QDs could also be calculated based on the relationship between the PbS-QD band gap (E0) and the particle size.31 The size d was estimated to be ∼3 nm (E0 ∼ 1.4 eV), which agreed well with the data extracted from Fig. 1a.

As we know, the space between individual PbS-QDs was controlled by the length of the organic ligands that were used to passivate their surfaces. This has been proved to be a decisive factor in the charge carrier mobility and conductivity. Thus, the hybrid perovskite was introduced as a replacing ligand of PbS-QDs via a solid-state ligand exchange. In order to explore the quality of the hybrid perovskite ligand-exchanged PbS-QD system, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed to investigate the crystalline structures. As shown in Fig. 2a, the hybrid perovskite films without any PbS-QDs showed strong peaks at (110), (220), (310) and (330) lattice planes of a typical CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure, respectively.32 In comparison, the intensity of (110) and (220) peaks in the XRD pattern of PbS-QDs + hybrid perovskite film decreased significantly, along with the intensity of the overall peak, which is also weaker than that of the pure hybrid perovskite film. Then the patterns showed minor and wide diffraction peaks at 25.9°, 30.0° and 43.1°, which could be assigned as (111), (220) and (220) for a typical PbS-QD structure (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. It is obvious to see that the Pb2+ and I− in the hybrid perovskite can bond with the surface of PbS-QDs, which causes the structure change of the PbS-QD crystal. Combined with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test, more investigation was expressed below.

(b) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of PbS-QDs + hybrid perovskite film and (c) XPS spectrum of Pb 4f peaks for the PbS-QD film, PbS-QDs + hybrid perovskite composite film and perovskite film, respectively. 
Then accurate XPS elemental analysis was performed to further investigate the states of both PbS and hybrid perovskite in the film after the ligand exchange process. In Fig. 2b, the Pb 4f and S 2p peaks could be clearly observed, along with the N 1s, C 1s and I 3d peaks originating from the surface capping ligand hybrid perovskite. Fig. 2c shows the Pb 4f binding energy of PbS-QDs, QDs-hybrid perovskite and pure hybrid perovskite thin films, respectively. It was obvious to see that the Pb 4f peak of PbS-QDs and hybrid perovskite film was around 137.89 eV and 138.18 eV, which correspond to Pb–S binding energy and Pb–I binding energy, respectively. However, a binding energy of 138.02 eV (Pb 4f peak) was detected in the PbS-QDs + hybrid perovskite film which suggested the co-existence of Pb–I and Pb–S binding energy states of Pb element. Combined with the XRD results, it could be concluded that PbS-QDs have been successfully combined with the hybrid perovskite via the ligand exchange process.
To explore the influence of the hybrid perovskite on the PbS-QD thin film, we measured the photoelectrical properties of the devices, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of PbS-QD films with/without the hybrid perovskite treatment. The pure PbS film exhibited a wide absorption range of 300–1000 nm, and the exciton absorption peak of PbS-QDs was around 1000 nm, which was consistent with the absorption behaviour of the PbS-QD solution shown in Fig. 1b. After treatment with the hybrid perovskite, the enhanced absorption ability in the whole spectrum (300–1000 nm) was ascribed to the following facts: (i) high absorption coefficient of the hybrid perovskite material in the visible region (300–800 nm); (ii) high quality of the PbS QD film increases the absorption after surface passivation from the hybrid perovskite. This whole range of visible light to near-infrared lays a foundation for the improvement of photoelectric detection performance.

(c) I–V curves of the photodetectors at varied light intensities (800 nm). (d) Time response of the device under light illumination (800 nm, 500 μW cm−2) with the applied bias V(AB) = +5 V. 
The EQE spectra with/without hybrid perovskite treatment are shown in Fig. 3b. Pure PbS-QDs exhibited a strong photo-response at 300–1200 nm with two peaks at ∼550 nm and 980 nm, along with a relative sensitivity at different wavelengths, which has been mentioned in our previous data.33 The lower EQE of the peak at 980 nm was consistent with the ground-state PbS-QD excitonic absorption feature, which could be found in the absorption spectrum of the QDs (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the EQE of the film after hybrid perovskite treatment was greatly enhanced with a highest quantum efficiency reaching about 80% at 600–900 nm. Subsequently, the quantum efficiency began to decrease, yet still higher than that of the films prepared with PbS-QDs. These results indicated that PbS-QDs and hybrid perovskite were highly complementary, enabling a wider wavelength range of photodetectors. In order to investigate the photo-response performance, a particular 800 nm light was chosen for our following measurements.

Fig. 3c shows the linear behaviour of the I–V curves of the photodetector measured in the dark and under different light illumination, respectively. High photoconductivity has been observed, implying a high light sensitivity of the device. It could be calculated that the conductivity of the device under the dark condition was about 8 × 103 s cm−1, while the conductivity of the film was about 2 × 104 s cm−1 under light illumination (800 nm, 500 μW cm−2). Time-dependent photo-response was performed by periodically turning on and off the light at an applied bias of V = +5 V, as shown in Fig. 3d. The photo-current of the device dramatically increased from ∼0.75 mA to ∼3 mA with the light irradiation off and on, giving a stable and repeatable Idark/Ilight ratio of ∼4.5. Moreover, the responsivity (R) and photoconductive gain (G) were estimated, which are critical parameters for photodetectors and could be expressed as34,35 (1)where Ip is the photocurrent, S is the effective illuminated area, Popt is the incident light power, η is the quantum efficiency, q is the electronic charge, λ is the light wavelength, h is Planck's constant and c is the light speed.36 Based on this equation, R and G were estimated to be 2 × 106 A W−1 and 3 × 106 at V(AB)= +5 V, respectively. These values were superior to the performance of previous QD-based photodetectors we reported before.
Hybrid perovskite treatment can effectively improve the carrier transport behaviour between the QDs because of the high carrier mobility of the perovskite and short length of perovskite ligands, which results in a high conductivity of devices. The high carrier mobility significantly decreases the transit time of carriers, and the incident light can be effectively converted into current, leading to a high photocurrent and thereby enhancing the photoresponsivity.33
The response speed is a key parameter for photodetecotors, which is essential for the photodetector application, revealing its ability to follow a fast-varying optical signal.37 Although many efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of fast response nano-devices, little attention has been paid to accurately determine their response properties at a higher frequency (f) of the pulsed light. In this work, we further measured the response properties at the f up to MHz. Fig. 4a depicts the schematic diagram of the device measurement, in which a laser diode was used to provide the pulsed light assisted with a pulsed generator, and the result is presented in Fig. 4b–d. From the time response curve under an ultrahigh pulsed light with f = 20 kHz, the device exhibited excellent stability and reproducibility, indicating that the device could follow the fast light switching. The speed of photodetectors is often characterized by the rise time (τr) and the fall time (τf) of their response to an impulse signal or to a pulse signal. The time interval for the response rise from 10 to 90% of its peak value is defined as τr; otherwise, the time interval for the response to decay from 90 to 10% is τf. Subsequently, the rise time (τr) and fall time (τf) can be determined to be 2 μs and 23.8 μs from a single normalized cycle (Fig. 4d), respectively. It is worth mentioning that the device showed the capability to work under higher pulsed light irradiation up to 200 kHz, as shown in Fig. 4c. The distinguished on/off state indicated that the device can follow well over light irradiation with varied f. Meanwhile, a relative balance (Imax − Imin)/Imax as a function of switching f of the device is plotted in Fig. 4e. Notably, the device still retains a relative balance of about 50% at a high frequency of f = 1 MHz, which was superior to the values of the nano-photodetectors based on previous reports and was comparable to that of some commercial devices, suggesting a great potential of the device to monitor the pulsed light signal with fast switching.

(e) The relative balance [(Imax − Imin)/Imax] versus switching frequencies. (f) Dark current noise at switching frequencies. 
To define the ability of the photodetectors to distinguish an extremely weak signal from the background noise, the detectivity (D*) or the noise equivalent power (NEP) has been measured using a lock-in amplifier.18Fig. 4f shows the noise current signal in the switching f. The NEP/D* of the photodetector was estimated to be about 10−17 W/1015 Jones at 800 nm (500 μW cm−2, 5 kHz) based on the following equation:38 (2)where A is the effective area of the detector, f is the electrical bandwidth, D* is the detectivity, R is the responsivity, and in is the noise current. It was obvious to see that the noise current of the photodetectors decreased consistently with the increase of the frequency. This device showed a rather low noise current (<1 pA Hz−1/2), which was smaller than that of some silicon substrate photodetectors.39
In comparison with other perovskites and PbS-QDs and based devices, as shown in Table 1, the photoelectric performance of PbS-QDs combined with hybrid perovskite, such as the spectrum, photocurrent, responsiveness and detectivity, has been greatly improved. These enhanced performances were attributed to the fact that the hybrid perovskite showed a better photoresponsivity at the weak detection performance of PbS-QDs at 600–900 nm light illumination.33 Therefore, the device exhibited an excellent detection capability in the whole visible to near-infrared light. The main reasons for the improved detection performance of the PbS-QD photodetectors with hybrid perovskite ligand exchange could be described as follows:

(i) The traditional surface ligand exchange process was limited by the fact that only a few molecules or atoms combined on the surface of PbS-QDs to passivate the traps/defects. In contrast, hybrid perovskite treatment could effectively reduce the organic ligands, which adsorbed on the surface of PbS-QDs and space between each PbS-QD greatly. It can lead to better lattice matching with PbS-QDs, making PbS-QD surface passivation more efficient. Furthermore, the hybrid perovskite can be also served as participants in carrier transport, as shown in Fig. 5a.

(ii) The p-type intrinsic properties of PbS and hybrid perovskites have been reported in previous works.40,41 From the energy level position in Fig. 5b, we can clearly see that the conduction/valence bands of the hybrid perovskite were slightly lower than those of PbS-QDs, resulting in no barrier impeding of the movement of carriers. Therefore, when the hybrid perovskite comes into contact with the PbS-QDs, the homotype heterojunction (p–p type)42 was observed at each individual PbS-QD + hybrid perovskite system. Under light illumination (hν), charge carriers (electrons/holes) were generated in both hybrid perovskite and PbS QDs at the interface of the p–p heterojunction and then photogenerated carriers would be fast separated by the built-in electric field effect. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PbS is higher than that of the hybrid perovskite, which suggests that no energy barrier exists at the interface. The fast carrier extraction and reduced recombination at the interface facilitate the carrier transport, which results in a higher conductivity for the device. The high carrier conductivity significantly decreases the transit time of carriers, resulting in an efficient conversion from incident light to photocurrent, leading to a large photocurrent, and faster photoresponse.33 Therefore, the similar homotype heterojunction (p–p junction) exhibited an improved photoelectrical performance.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we proposed to construct high-performance photodetectors based on PbS-QDs with the hybrid perovskite ligand exchange process. The device exhibited a high responsivity of ∼2 × 106 A W−1, a photoconductive gain of ∼3 × 106, and a detectivity of ∼1015 Jones with an applied bias of 5 V. Moreover, the operating speed of our photodetectors was up to ∼1 MHz combined with the high gain across the visible to near-infrared region and a relatively fast response time/recovery time of ∼2 μs/24 μs was obtained. The enhanced performance of PbS-QD + hybrid perovskite devices in comparison with original PbS-QDs was attributed to the excellent photoelectric properties of the hybrid perovskite as well as complementary PbS-QDs. These great results suggested the potential applications of the hybrid perovskite and PbS-QDs for the construction of nano-photodetectors.
