    , Accepted 20th July 2014First published on 22nd July 2014AbstractWe show that interface tailoring is an effective approach towards high performance G/Si Schottky-barrier solar cells. Inserting a thin graphene oxide (GO) interfacial layer can improve the efficiency of graphene/silicon solar cells by >100%. The role of the GO interfacial layer is systematically investigated by varying the annealing temperature and thickness of the GO film. It is found that GO cannot be treated as the common thought, i.e., an insulator. In other words, the G/GO/Si solar cell is not suitable to be treated as a “MIS” cell. In contrast, it should be regarded as a p-doped thin layer. The effects of GO film thickness on device response are also studied and there exists an optimal thickness for device performance. A record 12.3% (device size: 3 × 3 mm2) power conversion efficiency is achieved by further performance optimization (chemical doping graphene and antireflection coating).
Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional sheet of sp2 hybrid carbon, is highly attractive for numerous applications such as high-performance nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage.1–3 Recently, in view of its fascinating physical properties,4–6 the integration of graphene into photovoltaic devices has been extensively explored.7–11 Among these photovoltaic devices, graphene/silicon (G/Si) Schottky-barrier solar cells are extremely appealing due to their simple device structure, low cost and potential for high efficiency.7 For Schottky-barrier solar cells, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) is a critical factor determining the device performance. Specifically, larger SBH is desirable for more efficient charge separation. Chemical doping of graphene is the most commonly used method to increase SBH since it is determined by the difference between the work function (WF) of graphene and the electron affinity (χ) of Si (i.e., SBH = WFG − χ).10
In parallel, the other significant research challenge originating from the device structure aspect is to create interfaces that are tailored at the nanoscale to optimize transport of energy. It has been demonstrated that the interfaces play an important role in pursuing high power conversion efficiency (PCE). For example, in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs), there is usually a hole/electron transport layer between the active layer and the anode/cathode.12,13 As another example, it is found that a thin SiOx layer is beneficial for Si-based Schottky-barrier solar cells, the introduction of a thin insulator changes the device structure from MS (Metal–Semiconductor) to MIS (Metal–Insulator–Semiconductor).14 However, there are few reports on the interfaces in G/Si solar cells.
Herein, we show that interface tailoring is an important strategy in G/Si Schottky-barrier solar cells. Owing to its tunable electronic structure, GO and its derivatives have been used as a new class of efficient hole- and electron-extraction materials in polymer solar cells.15 The insertion of graphene oxide (GO) films, which can be regarded as a graphene sheet functionalized with oxygen groups, leads to dramatic improvement of PCE by >100%. A 12.3% PCE can be obtained with further modifications (chemical doping graphene and TiO2 antireflection coating). More importantly, GO should be treated as a p-doped material rather than an insulator in G/GO/Si solar cells. This result thus serves as a model example toward high performance (G/Si) Schottky-barrier solar cells.
Experimental section
Synthesis of multilayer graphene (MLG)
As reported previously,16 MLG is grown on copper foil (25 μm thick, Alfa Aesar) using the LPCVD method. Briefly, the system is first heated to 1000 °C for 10 min with a H2 flow of 300 sccm to clean the surface of copper, then 10 sccm CH4 is introduced for 20 min.
GO film preparation
GO is synthesized using the modified Hummer's method.17 The concentration of GO used is ∼1 mg mL−1 in a mixed solution (water–ethanol = 1:1). The solution is spun coated onto Si substrates at certain speed for 60 s, then GO films are either dried on a hot plate at 80 °C for 30 min or annealed at different temperatures (200, 300, 400, and 500 °C) under an Ar atmosphere for a fixed 30 min.
Synthesis of TiO2
For the synthesis of TiO2,18 Ti(OBu)4 is added to a mixture solution of water and ethanol (water–ethanol = 1:60 molar ratio), then a small amount of HCl (37 wt%) is added to promote hydrolysis and the solution is stirred for 2 h before use.
Fabrication of solar cell devices
n-type Si (with a square window of 3 mm × 3 mm surrounded by 300 nm thick SiO2) is used as substrates. SiO2 is used to define the active area of solar cells. In addition, SiO2 is used to make sure that the Ag paste (the front electrode) is separated from the underlying Si (connecting the rear electrode), and therefore the solar cells can work properly. GO is spun coated onto Si substrates at a certain speed and then annealed at different temperatures. The transfer of graphene onto the GO/Si substrate is realized by the well-known wet transfer method.19 Briefly, the copper substrates are dissolved using FeCl3 (∼0.7 M), then the MLG film is washed several times with deionized water, finally the MLG film is picked up using the GO/Si substrates. Ga–In liquid (99.999%) and Ag paste are applied as the rear electrode and the front electrode, respectively. HNO3 doping is done by using concentrated HNO3 (65 wt%) vapor for 1 min. TiO2 solution is spun coated onto the graphene film at 2000–6000 rpm for 1 min.
Characterization
The solar cells are tested under Air Mass 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, the light density is calibrated using a standard solar reference cell, SRC-1000-TC-QZ, VLSI Standards S/N: 10510-0305). The current–voltage data are recorded with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. IPCE is obtained using a QTEST STATION 500AD in the range 300–1100 nm. AFM measurements are performed on an Agilent Technologies 5500 Scanning Probe Microscope, and the thicknesses and surface roughness (Rq) are obtained using Picoview version 1.8. GO samples are prepared by dropping GO solution on a Cu grid, then observed using a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM). Raman Spectra are recorded using a Renishaw inVia-Reflex with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light. Scanning electronic microscopy is performed with a JSM-7001F, and the EDX spectrum is obtained using an Oxford INCA X-MAX. UPS measurements are performed with an unfiltered HeI (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp to determine the work function of graphene on different substrates. XPS measurements are made with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) to detect the C 1s signal. Electrochemical impedance spectra are recorded using a CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., and the measurements are carried out under illumination (AM 1.5G condition) by applying a bias that is equal to Voc.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a depicts the schematic illustration of our device. It consists of three layers, namely G/GO/Si. In the present work, MLG is employed because it has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the performance of MLG/Si devices is superior over that of their single-layer graphene (SLG) counterparts.20,21 MLG is synthesized by LPCVD as reported elsewhere.16 The multilayer structure is verified by using the Raman spectrum (Fig. 1b, IG/I2D > 2) and the transmittance spectrum (the inset of Fig. 1b, 84% at 550 nm, corresponding to 6–7 layers). Pristine MLG/Si solar cells having a stable PCE of ∼2.3% are used as the reference devices. A typical solar cell has Jsc = 23.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.35 V, FF = 0.26 and PCE = 2.13% (Fig. 2, the red curve and Table 1). After GO is introduced at the interface, the PCE dramatically decreases from 2.13% to <0.2% (black curve). It means that the unannealed GO interlayer has a deleterious effect on the device performance. However, if the GO film is annealed at 200 °C before transferring graphene (if not otherwise stated, GO(X) represents the GO films annealed at different temperatures), the PCE is noted to be improved substantially by 42-fold from 0.12% to 5.2% (blue curve). Compared with the reference device, the PCE shows an increase of >100%, as a result of the increase in Jsc, Voc and FF from 23.7 to 26.4 mA cm−2, 0.35 to 0.48 V and 0.26 to 0.41, respectively. Obviously, the main improvements are from FF (an increase of 54%) and Voc (an increase of 37%). If GO can be treated as an insulator, Jsc/(G/GO/Si) should be smaller than Jsc/(G/Si) since carriers are transported to the GO interfacial layer by tunneling. However, Jsc shows some increase after the insertion of the GO film, and as shown later, there exists a clear trend of increasing Jsc with increasing GO film annealing temperature. We came to a conclusion that GO can no longer be treated as an insulator in G/GO/Si devices. Therefore, in G/GO/Si solar cells, the holes are injected and transported in GO interfacial layers via the sp2 sites, and the content of sp2 sites has critical impacts on the device performance.22 We first examine the Raman spectra of the GO films. As shown in Fig. S1,† the ID/IG shows little change upon annealing, which may be due to the fact that annealing does not lead to an expansion of the sp2 cluster.22 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is then employed to determine the content of sp2 sites of GO interlayers before and after annealing because the absence of sp3 C–C bonding (bonding energy in the range 285.5–286.5 eV)23 allows us to detect the sp2 C–C bonding. As shown in Fig. 3a, The C 1s XPS signal consists of four different chemical shifted components which can be deconvoluted into: C–C (284.7 eV), CO (287.3 eV), C–(O)–O (289 eV) and C–OH (285.5 eV).24 The sp2 C–C bonding fraction (the pink area) is 38.5% in the as-deposited GO interlayer. At sp2 C–C bonding fraction <60%, the conduction in GO is via the tunneling between the sp2 sites and therefore leading to poor carrier transport.22 So it is suggested that the very low density of sp2 sites is responsible for the low PCE after the insertion of the unannealed GO film. After annealing, the content of sp2 sites is increased dramatically from 38.5% to 71.2%. This is believed to be the main reason for the significant improvements in PCE, because percolation among the sp2 sites dominates at sp2 fraction >60%.22 In addition, the GO film thickness becomes thinner upon heating (from 6.7 nm to 5.6 nm, Fig. S4a and S4b†), which is also beneficial for better carrier transport. As a consequence, the carrier injection and transport in GO films are greatly enhanced after annealing.

Clearly, there is a trend of increasing sp2 site content with increasing annealing temperature. (b) The charge-transfer resistance (Zf) of G/Si and G/GO(200)/Si devices. The inset shows an equivalent circuit of the devices. (c) Calculations of SBH from the J vs. H(J) plots. The J vs. dV per day (lnJ) plots are also shown. 
The charge-transfer resistance (Zf) of G/Si solar cells has remarkable influence on FF because Zf is related to series resistance (Rs), a resistance that is associated with Schottky barrier (R2), the front (R1) and back (R3) electrode contact resistance.25 For simplicity, R1, R2 and R3 can be substituted by a single parallel resistance, Rp. The general equivalent circuit of the solar cells is shown in the inset of Fig. 3b.26 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is then employed to determine Zf. As shown in Fig. 3b, Zf is 234.4 Ω for G/Si and 162.2 Ω for G/GO(200)/Si, respectively. The 31% decrease in Zf is thought to be the main reason for the remarkable improvement in FF. The decrease in Zf may be due to the change in device capacitance and needs further study. In order to analyze the variations in Voc, SBH is extracted from the J vs. H(J) plot. The series resistance (Rs) is also calculated from both the J vs. dV per day (lnJ) (denoted as Rs1) and J vs. H(J) plots (denoted as Rs2) to see the consistency of this approach.27 The results are shown in Fig. 3c and all the parameters are summarized in Table 1. As seen, Rs1 and Rs2 show good agreement with each other within 5%. The calculated SBHG/Si is 0.65 eV, which is in good agreement with the difference between WFG and χ (the WFG on Si is 4.72 eV as measured using Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) in Fig. S2,† and χ is 4.05 eV). The SBH increases by 0.14 eV from 0.65 eV to 0.79 eV after the introduction of the GO(200) film, which is consistent with the 0.13 V increase in Voc.
As discussed above, on one hand, simply annealing the GO film at 200 °C improves the PCE significantly; on the other hand, the role of GO need further to be studied. This drives us to vary the GO film annealing temperature (300, 400, and 500 °C) to look into its role in G/GO/Si solar cells. Fig. 4 shows the change of PCE with annealing temperature, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown, G/GO(X)/Si (X = 200, 300, and 400 °C) devices show improvements compared with the reference devices. In order to have reliable results, each set of devices are fabricated with three parallel cells and the statistical results of Jsc and Voc are plotted in Fig. 5a. As seen, Jsc increases with increasing annealing temperature, whereas Voc peaks at 200 °C. The variations in Jsc can be explained as follows. Under the same illumination conditions (AM 1.5G) and using the same graphene, Jsc can be expressed as Jsc = f(β, SBH), where β is the quantum efficiency.28 After the insertion of the GO film, the hole injection and transport in the GO film also have important impacts on Jsc, and Jsc should be therefore written as:Jsc = f(β, SBH, θ),where θ represents the hole injection and transport in the GO film. Since the GO film absorbs little light (Fig. S3†) and SBH is in the e−αw form,28β and θ dominate Jsc. β can be estimated from incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, IPCEGO(400) > IPCEGO(300) > IPCEGO(200), which means that higher annealing temperature leads to larger β. Moreover, all the IPCE are larger than the reference IPCE (black curve), indicating that the incorporation of GO films can suppress interface recombination, which may be due to the negative interface charge nature (or oxide charge) of GO.29θ also increases with increasing annealing temperature because the content of sp2 sites, which has significant impacts on θ, goes higher at higher annealing temperature (Fig. 3a). As a result, Jsc increases with increasing annealing temperature. The change in Voc is explained by exploring the change in SBH. SBH is again calculated from J vs. H(J) plots (see Fig. S7† and Table 2) and there is a clear trend of reducing SBH with increasing annealing temperature. In fact, GO can be regarded as a p-doped material because the Fermi level is very close to the valence band, both supported by theoretical calculations and experiments.30,31 The existence of an opposite doped thin layer on silicon gives rise to the following increase in SBH:32 ΔSBH = qδp2/2εs(1)where q is the electronic charge, εs is the permittivity of Si, δ and p are respectively the thickness and the doping level of the interfacial layer. Upon heating, oxygen atoms are removed from GO and gradually GO is converted to graphene.24 From this point of view, the p-doping level of GO decreases as annealing temperature increases. Hence SBH shows a down trending at higher annealing temperature using eqn (1) due to the smaller δ and p, which is in good agreement with the results obtained from J vs. H(J) plots. It should be pointed out that WFG on GO(400) is 4.62 eV (21.22 − 16.6 = 4.62 eV, the green curve in Fig. S2†), therefore SBHG/Si changes to 0.67 − 0.1 = 0.57 eV, and the increased SBH due to the incorporation of the GO(400) film is 0.03 eV. The p-doping levels of GO(X) (X = 200, 300, and 400) films are respectively 1.06, 0.93 and 0.58 × 1013 cm−2 as calculated from eqn (1), consistent with the fact that the sp2 C–C bonding fraction increases upon annealing at 200–400 °C (Fig. 3a). Though SBHGO(200) (0.79 eV) > SBHGO(300) (0.74 eV), Voc/GO(200) ≈ Voc/GO(300), it is thought that the interface recombination is responsible for this phenomenon for higher recombination reduces Voc (IPCEGO(300) > IPCEGO(200), suggesting that the G/GO(200)/Si device has higher recombination).33

Fig. 6a displays the statistical results of FF and PCE. PCE shows the same trend as FF. Comparing the device parameters, the relatively lower PCE of G/GO(300)/Si is mainly due to its lower FF. The variations in FF are again explained by Zf. As revealed by EIS in Fig. 6b, the relatively larger Zf/GO(300) with respect to Zf/GO(200,400) is responsible for the lower FF.
 Fig. 6  (a) The statistical results (based on three parallel devices) of FF and PCE. PCE has the same changing trend with FF, indicating that the relatively low FF is the main reason for the relatively low PCEGO(300). (b) The charge-transfer resistance (Zf) of G/GO(X)/Si devices (X = 0, 200, 300 and 400 °C). Clearly the G/GO(300)/Si device (the blue curve) has higher Zf than G/GO(200400)/Si devices. 
It is found that further increasing annealing temperature (500 °C) causes degradation in PCE. The surface becomes very rough (Rq = 3.7 nm, Table S1†) after annealing at 500 °C, which may be the main reason for the bad junction (n = 4.45) and low SBH (0.55 eV). The AFM topology image (Fig. 7a) suggests that the rough surface is caused by the white dots, which are identified as new substance by the phase image (Fig. 7b). Two elements, Si and O, are detected by EDX as shown in Fig. 7c, suggesting that the white dots may come from the reactions of Si/SiO2 with residual water/oxygen at high temperature34 (see ESI for details, Fig. S11†).

The effects of GO film thicknesses (δ) on device response are also investigated and there clearly exists an optimal thickness for device performance. GO(400) films with different δ are employed (δ is determined by AFM, see Fig. S5†). Fig. 8a shows the change of PCE with δ. Clearly the best PCE is obtained with δ = 3.5 nm. The statistical graphs of photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S8†, G/GOδ=3.5 nm/Si devices have the best Jsc, Voc, and FF, leading to the highest PCE. Fig. 8b shows the plots of n and SBH vs. δ (the J vs. dV/dlnJ and J vs. H(J) plots are shown in Fig. S9†). SBH decreases (again the calculated result is consistent with the result obtained from eqn (1), further showing that treating GO as a p-doped layer is valid) while n increases with reducing δ. In addition, IPCE increases with increasing δ (Fig. 8c). It seems that larger δ is better for device performance. However, Zf/δ=4.6 nm > Zf/δ=3.6 nm > Zf/δ=2.6 nm (Fig. 8d), indicating that Zf increases rapidly with increasing δ. As a result, there exists an optimal thickness for device performance.

The simple fabrication process and low cost make the G/Si solar cell a competitive candidate for next-generation commercial solar cells. A major problem that hinders its commercialization is the low PCE (typically <10%). We show that the PCE can reach 12.3% by further treating the G/GO/Si solar cells with chemical doping and antireflection coating. Here chemical doping is done by exposing the device to HNO3 vapor and TiO2 coating is employed as the antireflection coating.11 The final structure of solar cells is Si/GO/G/TiO2, as confirmed by the SEM cross-section image (the inset of Fig. 9a) and the back-scattered electron image (Fig. S10†). A typical Si/GO/G solar cell with a PCE of 5% is used (Fig. 9a, black curve), with Voc = 0.48 V, Jsc = 30.1 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.35. By doping graphene with HNO3 (red curve), the PCE is increased to 8.2%, with Voc = 0.55 V, Jsc = 29.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.5. After coating with an antireflection TiO2 layer, the PCE is further improved to 12.3%, with Voc = 0.57 V, Jsc = 37.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.57 (blue curve). HNO3 doping mainly increases Voc and FF, while TiO2 coating mainly enhances Jsc. IPCE (Fig. 9b) also confirms this conclusion: after HNO3 doping, there is little change in IPCE; while the IPCE is greatly enhanced after TiO2 coating.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate that interface tailoring can serve as an effective approach towards high performance G/Si Schottky-barrier solar cells. By inserting a GO film through a simple spin-coating process, the PCE can be increased by >100% compared with the reference devices. The critical role of GO in G/Si solar cells is systematically studied by varying the annealing temperature and thickness of the GO film. Unlike traditional thinking, i.e., GO acts as an insulator, it is found that GO can be treated as a p-doped material. This simple method offers us another choice to obtain high efficiency G/Si solar cells, which potentially opens up new opportunities for next-generation high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic illustration of the device structure. The device consists of three layers, namely G/GO/Si. (b) Raman spectrum of multilayer graphene used in this work. The inset shows a transmittance spectrum of graphene, T550 nm = 84%, which corresponds to 6–7 layers.	 

 	Fig. 2  The effects of GO interfacial layers on device performance. The insertion of as-deposited GO interlayers leads to an extremely low PCE (black curve). However, annealing the as-deposited GO at 200 °C (blue curve) improves the PCE by >100% compared with the reference device (red curve).	 


Ref. (red)	23.7	0.35	0.26	2.13	4.3/4.35	3.35	0.65
GO (black)b	3.33	0.12	0.31	0.12	
	
	

GO (blue)c	26.4	0.48	0.41	5.2	4.37/4.45	2.08	0.79

 	Fig. 3  (a) The C 1s XPS spectra of GO interfacial layers annealed at temperature (0, 200, 400, and 500 °C). The content of sp2 sites is indicated by the pink area. Clearly, there is a trend of increasing sp2 site content with increasing annealing temperature. (b) The charge-transfer resistance (Zf) of G/Si and G/GO(200)/Si devices. The inset shows an equivalent circuit of the devices. (c) Calculations of SBH from the J vs. H(J) plots. The J vs. dV per day (lnJ) plots are also shown.	 
Jsc = f(β, SBH, θ),
ΔSBH = qδp2/2εs	(1)

 	Fig. 4  The change of PCE with GO film annealing temperature. G/GO(X)/Si (X = 200, 300 and 400 °C) devices show improvements in PCE, whereas further increasing the annealing temperature (500 °C) causes degradation in PCE.	 

200	26.4	0.48	0.41	5.2	4.37/4.45	2.08	0.79
300	28.2	0.48	0.30	4.2	4.53/4.64	2.46	0.74
400	32.2	0.39	0.39	4.6	1.51/1.56	3	0.6
500	20.3	0.28	0.28	1.6	2.56/2.6	4.43	0.55

 	Fig. 5  (a) The statistical results (based on three parallel devices) of Jsc and Voc. (b) The IPCE curves of devices with different GO film annealing temperatures.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) The statistical results (based on three parallel devices) of FF and PCE. PCE has the same changing trend with FF, indicating that the relatively low FF is the main reason for the relatively low PCEGO(300). (b) The charge-transfer resistance (Zf) of G/GO(X)/Si devices (X = 0, 200, 300 and 400 °C). Clearly the G/GO(300)/Si device (the blue curve) has higher Zf than G/GO(200400)/Si devices.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) The AFM topology image of the GO(500) film on the Si substrate, the scale bar is 1 μm. (b) The corresponding phase image. (c) The EDX of the white dots in (a); the Pt signal is from the sputtered Pt.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) The change of PCE with δ. (b) The change of SBH and n with δ. (c) IPCE curves of G/GO(400)/Si solar cells with different δ. (d) Zf measurements of G/GO(400)/Si solar cells with different δ.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) The PCE of a G/GO/Si solar cell after different treatment steps: pristine state (G/GO/Si, black curve), after HNO3 doping (red curve) and after TiO2 coating (blue curve). The inset shows a SEM cross-section image of the device. (b) The corresponding IPCE curves of the solar cell after different treatment steps.
