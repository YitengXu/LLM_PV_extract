, Accepted 23rd July 2014First published on 24th July 2014AbstractTwo new ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2 were synthesized and used as sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSC based on D2 shows a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.96% as compared to dye D1 (PCE = 3.65%). The higher value of PCE was attributed to the increase in the light harvesting property of dye D2 because of its extended absorption profile up to the near infrared region and a higher value of dye loading on the photoanode surface. The observed value of a higher PCE has also been confirmed by electrochemical impedance data and dark current.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), since the first report by Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 have attracted considerable research interest as promising alternatives to conventional solar cells based on silicon because of their low cost, simplicity of fabrication and high overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) values.2 DSSCs typically consist of four components: a nanocrystalline wide energy bandgap metal oxide semiconductor film (generally TiO2 or ZnO), a dye, an electrolyte or hole transport material, and a counter electrode. Upon light illumination, light is absorbed by the sensitizer and excited electrons from the sensitizer are injected into the TiO2 conduction band. These electrons are then transferred to the counter electrode by the external load and finally to I3−, which yields I− that reduces the photo-oxidized sensitizer to its original state. In the abovementioned processes, the dye sensitizers play a vital role in both the light harvesting and electron injection efficiency. To achieve an increased light harvesting efficiency in DSSCs, a variety of sensitizers were developed and tested. To date, DSSCs based on ruthenium based dyes3 and porphyrin dyes4 have shown very impressive PCEs. The DSSCs based on a black dye with donor–acceptor type coadsorbents have reached an overall PCE of 11.4%,5 and a new record PCE of 12.3%(ref. 6) has been obtained by the cosensitization of the porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 and a metal free organic dye. Although the sensitizers based on Ru complexes showed a high PCE, their low molar extinction coefficient, high cost and environmental concerns have limited their large scale applications. In this regard, metal free organic dyes have attracted significant interest in recent years.7 Because of their unique advantages such as high absorption coefficients, ease of structural modification, relatively low cost and their resulting PCEs of more than 10%,8 these molecules are strong competitors to the ruthenium based sensitizers.
To develop high PCE DSSCs, several kinds of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dyes possessing both electron donating (D) and electron withdrawing anchoring (A) groups linked by π-conjugated bridges, possessing broad and intense absorption features have been developed so far and would be expected to be one of the most abundant classes of metal free organic sensitizers.8a In the D–π–A structure, triphenylamine derivatives have been widely used as the electron donor (D), whereas the cyanoacrylic acid moiety has been used as the electron acceptor as well as the anchoring unit. Recently, ferrocene-based compounds, which exhibit chemical and electrochemical properties that are interesting for numerous applications, have been employed as donor units in sensitizers for DSSCs.9 For example, Singh et al. have used some ferrocene based dithiocarbamate sensitizers for DSSCs.10,11 Recently, the same research group used ferrocenyl bearing Ni(II) and Cu(II) dithiocarbamates as sensitizers for DSSCs and achieved a PCE of 3.87%.12 However, these dyes contain metal in the central position, which increases the complexity of their synthesis.
Herein, we have synthesized and investigated the optical and electrochemical properties of two ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine (TPA) based donor–acceptor dyes, D1 and D2, for their application as sensitizers for DSSCs. Ferrocenyl is a donor unit and can extend the absorption band towards the longer wavelength region, whereas the cyanoacrylic acid acts as an anchoring unit. The DSSC based on sensitizer D2 showed higher PCE than that of sensitizer D1, which is attributed to the higher amount of dye loading and light harvesting efficiency.
Experimental details
The photoanodes of DSSCs were prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates, which were first cleaned by sonication, and subsequently cleaned with de-ionized water, iso-propanol and ethanol and then dried in air. The working electrodes were prepared by first forming a blocking layer of 0.2 M titanium di-isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in iso-propanol by spray pyrolysis on a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate. This was followed by the deposition of a nano-crystalline layer of TiO2 by the doctor blade technique using a dye sol TiO2 paste (DSL 18NR-T). The TiO2 coated FTO electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, they were immersed into a 0.02 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 20 min, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then annealed again at 500 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the TiO2 layer was in the range of 10–12 μm. Finally, they were immersed into the corresponding solutions of D1 and D2 (5 × 10−4 M in dichloromethane) for 12 h and washed with dichloromethane to give the dye-sensitized TiO2 working electrodes. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating a H2PtCl4 (aq.) solution (0.002 g of Pt in 1 mL of iso-propanol) on to a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate followed by heating at 450 °C for 15 min in air. The sensitized working electrode was assembled with the Pt coated FTO electrode into a sandwich type cell and sealed with the hot-melt polymer surlyn. To complete the fabrication of DSSC, the electrolyte solution containing LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), 1 methyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 volume ratio) was introduced into the space between the two electrodes through a pre-drilled hole in the platinum coated FTO by vacuum backfilling.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs under a simulated air mass of 1.5 global and an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 were measured by a computer controlled Keithley source meter and illuminated using a solar simulator. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device with a light source and a monochromator, and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in the dark using a CH electrochemical workstation. They were measured by applying a dc bias equivalent to the open circuit voltage of DSSC in the frequency range 0.1 to 100 KHz with an ac signal of 20 mV.
Results and discussion
The intermediate 4-[bis-(4-iodo-phenyl)-amino]-benzaldehyde was synthesized from 4-(diphenylamino)-benzaldehyde according to a procedure reported in the literature.13 Compound 1 was synthesized by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 4-[bis-(4-iodo-phenyl)-amino]-benzaldehyde with ethynyl ferrocene (see ESI† for details).14 The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 1 with cyanoacetic acid in a dichloromethane and acetic acid mixture (1:1) in the presence of NH4OAC resulted in compound D2 in 81% yield. The [2 + 2] cyclo-addition reaction of donor–acceptor compound D2 with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) at 75 °C, in dichloromethane in the microwave gave compound D3 in 60% yield (Scheme 1).

Photophysical properties
The electronic absorption spectra of the ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based donor–acceptor D1 and D2 dyes in dilute dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 1 and the data are listed in Table 1. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of dye D1 shows two types of bands. The first band is in the 353 nm region and near 300 nm for both D1 and D2, corresponds to a π → π* transition, and the second band in the 450–470 nm region and corresponds to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).15

Dye D2 shows a high energy absorption band around 471 nm corresponding to a π → π* transition, and a low energy broad band around 630–700 nm corresponding to ICT (Fig. 1).16
The absorption spectra of D1 and D2 on a TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2. The maximum absorption peaks for D1 and D2 on to the TiO2 films are about 474 nm and 492 nm, respectively. The absorption bands of D1 and D2 dyes on TiO2 films are red shifted by 18 nm and 11 nm, respectively, as compared to the bands observed in solution. This red shift can be explained by the formation of J aggregation or the electronic coupling of the dye on the TiO2 surface.17 It was reported that a smaller shift in λmax was associated with dyes in solution vs. on a thin film, suggesting a smaller tendency to form dye aggregates on the semiconductor surface. This phenomenon results in higher photocurrent densities.18 It should be noted here that the red shift for dye D2 is less than that for dye D1, indicating that the incorporation of the TCNE acceptor group could effectively suppress the formation of aggregates on the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, the absorption band of dye D2 on the TiO2 surface became broader compared to that of dye D1 because the absorption band of the former might originate from the electronic transition bands of TPA. Therefore, the strong light harvesting ability of dye D2 with less aggregation on TiO2 films is favorable for the performance of DSSCs.19 The optical band gap was estimated from the absorption spectra corresponding to the onset of the dye adsorption onto the TiO2 film, and is 2.17 eV and 1.74 eV for D1 and D2, respectively.

To obtain information regarding the binding of these dyes onto the TiO2 surface of the DSSC electrode, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of pristine dye powder and of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 were measured. The FTIR spectra of dyes D1 and D2 showed an absorption band at around 1694 cm−1, which is assigned to free carboxylic acid groups of the powdered D1 and D2 dyes. However, the FTIR spectra of dye sensitized TiO2 films displayed two characteristic bands at 1586 cm−1 and 1348 cm−1, assigned to the COO– anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups, respectively, coordinated with surface titanium atoms, and the band around 1694 cm−1 completely disappeared. These observations suggest strong binding and electronic coupling of these dyes through the carboxylic acid group with the TiO2 surface.20
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based donor–acceptor D1 and D2 dyes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. CV data has been reported here with respect to ferrocene oxidation (Fc/Fc+ = 0.00 V). Cyclic voltammograms of these dyes are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The cyclic voltammogram of compound D1 shows two oxidation waves: (a) reversible wave in the region of 0.08 V corresponding to the oxidation of the ferrocene unit, and (b) quasi reversible oxidation wave in the region of 0.65 V, which belongs to the triphenylamine unit.21

The cyclic voltammogram of the donor–acceptor compound D2 shows two oxidation waves and two reduction waves. The first oxidation wave in the region of 0.39 V corresponds to the oxidation of the ferrocene unit, and the second quasi reversible wave in the region of 1.02 V belongs to the triphenylamine unit. Among the two reduction waves, one is quasi reversible in the region of 0.97 V and the other is reversible in the region of 1.39 V and belongs to the TCNE group.22 D2 exhibits higher oxidation potential compared to D1, and is attributed to the increase in the number of acceptors, i.e. TCNE acceptors units.
As shown in Table 1, the oxidation potential (Eox) because of the triphenylamine unit (0.65 V for dye D1 and 1.02 V for dye D2 with respect to Fc/Fc+ = 0.00 V) has been considered for the HOMO level. These values are converted with respect to NHE and are 0.52 V and 0.83 V vs. NHE, which are more positive than the value for the I3−/I− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dyes formed after electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 could thermodynamically accept electrons from the I− ions. In particular, the lower value of the HOMO observed for dye D2 implies that the DSSC prepared with D2 may show higher and efficient charge regeneration.23 The LUMO levels of the sensitizers were estimated by the values of Eox and optical band gaps, i.e. ELUMO = −(Eopt − EHOMO)17a and the optical band gap values were calculated by the onset absorption spectra in Fig. 2. The LUMO values of dyes D1 (−1.65 V vs. NHE) and D2 (−0.91 V vs. NHE) are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating that the electron injection from the LUMO of these sensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2 is energetically feasible. The reduction potential of D2 was observed to be about −1.39 V vs. Fc+/Fc, which is different from that estimated from the difference in Eopt and EHOMO. This discrepancy may be attributed to a difference between the reorganization energy required to optically excite the molecule and the energy required to reduce it. Therefore, these dyes could be used as sensitizers for DSSCs.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) is extensively used for the ground state electronic structure calculations of donor–acceptor systems. However, compared to the ground state, the photoexcited molecules are experimentally difficult to characterize. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method is used in a DFT framework for excited states. DFT calculations are a reliable method for determining ground state energies and structures for various types of donor–acceptor systems. Thus, to get an elementary idea regarding the electronic structure and to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dyes D1 and D2, we performed DFT calculations with Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G** level for C, H, N, O and the Lanl2DZ level for Fe.24,25 We explored similar types of ferrocene-based systems utilizing the DFT method and the results were satisfactory.22c The ferrocenyl groups were observed to be almost planar with respect to the phenyl ring in the D1 dye. On the other hand, the incorporation of the TCNE group results in a loss of planarity of the ferrocenyl groups because of steric hindrance in D2. The optimized structures of D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 4.

The Mulliken spin density distributions of D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 5. Both D1 and D2 show high electron density on nitrogen (−0.570) and oxygen atoms (−0.567), whereas the neighboring carbon atoms show less electron density (0.570). Spin densities on the ferrocenyl groups are practically zero in all the cases (Fig. 5).

 Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbitals of the ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine donor–acceptor D1 and D2 dyes. HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 are also shown here. 
In the D1 dye, the HOMO orbitals are localized on both the ferrocene and the triphenylamine units, whereas the LUMO orbitals are mainly concentrated on the acceptor unit (cyanoacetic acid). The contribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals in dye D2 undergoes a drastic change because of the incorporation of the 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) unit. Careful analysis of the frontier molecular orbitals reveals that the main transition takes place from HOMO−1 to LUMO+1 in D2. The HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 molecular orbitals indicate that electron density is occupied on one of the TCNE units as well as the cyanoacetic acid group (anchor moiety) (Fig. 6). Therefore, this electronic structure fulfills the requirement for electron injection from the LUMO level of D2 into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the fabricated DSSCs sensitized with the D1 and D2 dyes under stimulated light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 7a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency, are compiled in Table 2. The PCE of the DSSC sensitized with dye D1 and dye D2 are about 3.65% and 4.96%, respectively. The higher value of PCE for DSSCs sensitized with D2 illustrated that the introduction of the TCNE acceptor in the conjugated arms improves the PCE of the DSSC. The values of Jsc, Voc and FF for the DSSC sensitized with D2 are higher than those for D1. The increased value of Jsc is attributed to the broader absorption profile of dye D2 adsorbed on TiO2 and a higher amount of dye loading, whereas the increase in the Voc could be attributed to the effective retardation of charge recombination between the injected electrons in the TiO2 and oxidized dye D2.26 The origin of the increased value of the Voc can also be justified from the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs in the dark, as shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen from Fig. 7b that the onset of dark current for DSSC sensitized with D2 is higher than that for D1, indicating that the increase in Voc was associated with decreasing electron recombination in TiO2 with the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte.27 The lower value of Voc for the DSSC sensitized with dye D1 than that of dye D2 may be because of a higher level of ground state oxidation potential of D1 (0.52 V vs. NHE) than D3 (0.83 V vs. NHE), which enhanced the electron back transfer from the conduction band to the oxidized dye.

The incident photons to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8. The IPCE spectra of these devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the respective dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. The IPCE spectrum of DSSC based on D2 extends to the longer wavelength region, as compared to the DSSC prepared with D1. This feature is in agreement with the trend observed in the absorption spectra. The IPCE of the DSSC can be expressed as.  where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency (which depends upon the absorption profile and amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface), ηinj is the electron injection efficiency (depends upon the electron injection rate from the sensitizer into the conduction band of TiO2), and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency (depends upon the electron transport rate in TiO2 towards the FTO electrode and the recombination of electrons with the redox couple in the electrolyte and oxidized dye).
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectra of DSSCs sensitized with D1 and D2. 
Another critical factor in determining the PCE and IPCE values of the DSSCs is the LHE of the photoanode.28 The IPCE values for the DSSC sensitized with dye D2 are higher than those for D1 at all the wavelengths. As can be seen from the Fig. 2, the absorption profile of D2 is more extended to the higher wavelength region as compared to D1, and the higher values of IPCE may be attributed to the enhanced LHE for the DSSC sensitized with D2. This shows that an enhanced LHE can increase the photocurrent and IPCE values.
In general, the Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi level of electron in a dye sensitized TiO2 electrode under illumination and the redox potential level of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Because the electrolyte used in both the DSSCs is the same, the value of the Voc depends upon the Fermi level for electrons after electron injection in both the dyes. The Voc value of the DSSCs can be expressed as7c  where ECB is the TiO2 conduction band edge, Ered is the electrolyte redox potential, kT represents the thermal energy, and nc and NCB are the number of electrons and density of states in the TiO2 conduction band, respectively. After dye sensitization on the TiO2 surface, a shift in ΔECB occurs, which can be given by the expression:29  where μnormal is the dipole moment of the absorbed dye vertical to the TiO2 surface, γ is the concentration of dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (dye loading), and εo and ε are the permittivity of vacuum and dielectric constant of the dye monolayer, respectively. From the abovementioned expression, it is apparent that a dye with larger μnormal and γ values yields a larger shift in the conduction band edge, leading to the higher value of Voc. Because the dipole moment of D2 is larger than that of D1 and dye loading is higher for the DSSC based on the D2 sensitized photoanode than that based on D1, the ΔECB is larger for the DSSC based on dye D2, which consequently has a higher value of Voc.
To further investigate the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs sensitized with these two dyes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed.30,31 The EIS analyses of DSSCs were recorded in the dark under a forward bias voltage of −0.68 V, i.e. equivalent to the approximate Voc of the DSSC and in the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 KHz. The Nyquist plots of the EIS of the DSSCs based on D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 9a. In general, three semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra. The smaller semicircle at high frequency is assigned to the redox charge transfer response at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface.31 The large semicircle at an intermediate frequency represents the electron transfer process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In the low frequency region, impedance is associated with the Warburg diffusion process of I3−/I− in the electrolyte. The two DSSCs showed minimal differences in the smaller semicircles observed at higher frequencies because of the same Pt and electrolyte. However, the difference between the DSSCs for the intermediate frequency semicircle was significant. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface can be estimated by fitting the semicircle in the intermediate frequency region using the Z-view software. This resistance is related to the charge recombination rate, i.e. a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and a larger dark current. It can be seen from the figure that the radius of the semicircle in the intermediate region is lower for the DSSC sensitized with D2 as compared to that for D1. This is consistent with the higher value of Voc for the DSSC based on D2 as compared to that for D1.
 Fig. 9  EIS plots: (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots in the dark for DSSCs sensitized with dyes D1 and D2. 
The electron lifetime was estimated from the peak frequency (fpeak) in the frequency region corresponding to the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 9b), according to the τe = 1/2πfpeak. The estimated values of electron lifetimes for the DSSCs based on D1 and D2 are 17.80 ms and 23.46 ms, respectively, indicating that the back charge recombination is suppressed for the DSSC sensitized with D2 as compared to D1.
Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized donor–acceptor type ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based D1 and D2 dyes and applied them as sensitizers for DSSCs. The effect of the TCNE acceptor group on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties was investigated. The DSSC based on dye D2 yielded a PCE of 4.96% (Jsc = 9.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 and FF = 0.70), while the DSSC based on dye D1 showed a PCE of 3.65% (Jsc = 8.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.66 V and FF = 0.68). The Jsc of dye D2 is higher than dye D1, which can be attributed to the broader absorption profile of dye D2 and the higher value of IPCE. The EIS results are in good agreement with different Voc values for DSSCs based on two dyes. The higher Voc value can be further explained by the longer electron lifetime. These dyes are easy to synthesize as compared to other metal free dyes, and therefore the cost can be further lowered using this type of metal free dyes.
