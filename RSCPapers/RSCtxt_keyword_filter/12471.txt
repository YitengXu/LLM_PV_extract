    , Accepted 27th July 2011First published on 11th August 2011AbstractA novel bis-EDOT-based monomer with ethylene glycol oligomers was synthesized and shown to exhibit strong ion solvation, good transport properties, and effective charge screening. These properties greatly improved JSC (4.2 to 7.0 mA cm−2) and η (1.6 to 2.9%) in an iodine-free solid state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) employing a Z-907 sensitizer, compared with the corresponding values of DSSCs fabricated using the standard bis-EDOT.
O'Regan and Grätzel reported a 7.9% power conversion efficiency (η) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) employing I−/I3− and organic solvents two decades ago.1 Such liquid junction DSSCs present operational problems in that the liquid phase and the iodine system2 can leak and corrode the electrodes, thereby decreasing the lifetime and η of the system. Many researchers have tried to overcome these disadvantages by improving the fabrication processes or developing solid state hole transport materials (HTMs), for example, spin-coating spiro-OMeTAD,3 triarylamines,4 or poly(3-hexylthiophene),5 onto nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, or introducing photoelectrochemical polymerization (PEP) of pyrrole6 or bis-EDOT to the pores of TiO2 electrodes.7 The latter approach is advantageous in that it was shown to improve the extent of pore filling, yielding better physical contact for regenerating oxidized sensitizers during continuous sunlight harvesting.8
In 1997, Yanagida et al. introduced an iodine-free solid state DSSC (s-DSSC) using electrochemically polymerized pyrroles as an HTM in place of the I−/I3− solution in the pores of Z907-sensitized TiO2 electrodes.6 However, the η was as low as 0.1%. Yanagida optimized the procedure using bis-EDOT and reported improvements up to η = 2.85% (JSC = 5.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.76 V) in 2008, demonstrating that bis-EDOT is a promising HTM for s-DSSCs.8 Recently, Ramakrishna et al. reported the preparation of s-DSSCs that employed bis-EDOT. He additionally revealed that a sensitizer played an important role in the PEP process because polymerization was initiated by the photogenerated holes at the HOMO levels of the dyes.9 They obtained η = 6.1% (JSC = 9.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 V) in an s-DSSC employing the indoline D149 dye (which is expensive) with bis-EDOT. However, the efficiency of the Z-907 DSSCs remained low, providing η = 1.7% (JSC = 3.6 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.69 V).
HTMs may similarly play an important role as sensitizers in the PEP process.10,11 Until recently, bis-EDOT was the only material used for PEP. This material may presumably be optimized to improve the performance of s-DSSCs. One of the advantages that s-DSSCs have over liquid junction DSSCs (η = 10%) employing iodine solutions is that photoinduced electrons are less likely to recombine with oxidized HTMs, which are cations in the s-DSSCs, unlike the anions (I3−) in the iodine system.12 Retardation of such recombination reactions is crucial to improving η in s-DSSCs. Durrant et al. demonstrated that hole transporting oligomers comprising ion solvating and transporting ethylene glycol oligomers could be used to control interfacial charge recombination.11 Later, Snaith et al. proposed that the chelation of lithium ions may induce coulombic screening of photoinduced electrons, which could suppress recombination reactions.3c In this communication, we describe the use of a novel bis-EDOT-based monomer (bis-EDOT-TB) as a polymeric HTM for use in the PEP process, and we demonstrate the doping effects of lithium ions on charge transfer in s-DSSCs employing a Z907 sensitizer.
The synthesis of the novel monomer having two triethylene glycol monomethylether (TEG) groups (bis-EDOT-TB) is described in the ESI.†bis-EDOT and bis-EDODT-B were also prepared to compare the effects of the TEG groups. The solubility of bis-EDOT-TB was 0.01 M in CH3CN. The solubility increased upon addition of LiTFSI to the solution of bis-EDOT-TB, indicating that lithium ions interacted with the TEG (Fig. 1).

The binding affinity of the TEGs in bis-EDOT-TB toward lithium ions was investigated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.14CD3CN, which is highly polar and, thus, a competitive solvent, was chosen to provide an environment similar to that present in devices containing the polar ionic liquid, 1,3-ethylmethylimidazolium trifluorosulfonimide (EmITFSI) as the electrolyte. Preliminary experiments confirmed the association between lithium and TEG groups in bis-EDOT-TB, as shown in Fig. 2(a). A mixture of LiTFSI (0.02 M) and bis-EDOT-TB (0.01 M) in CD3CN displayed peak shifts of H1, H2, and H3. However, the ethylene proton peaks (HT1 and HT2) in the thiophene unit did not shift at all, indicating a positive association between TEG and the lithium ions.15 A binding constant was estimated by titrating in lithium ions (bis-EDOT-TB: 0.01 M, LiTFSI: 0.001–0.03 M), assuming that two TEG groups independently associated with one lithium ion (Fig. 2(a)). The H2 peak shift, which was distinctive, was fit to an association model to yield Ka = 495 M−1 (Fig. 2(b)).16 This demonstrated the strong association between TEG and lithium ions, even highly polar solvents with a strong solvation effect, consistent with our observations described above.

Onset potentials (Vonset) of the monomer solutions in the presence of the LiTFSI electrolyte, which was used for the PEP procedure (CH3CN), were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH3CN, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Vonset depended strongly on the geometry of the fused aromatic moieties. A low Vonset was expected for a monomer with a coplanar structure. Indeed, Vonset (0.63 V for Ag/AgCl) of bis-EDOT, which is highly coplanar, was much lower than that of bis-EDOT-B, which had a benzene linker (0.82 V for Ag/AgCl). However, bis-EDOT-TB with the TEG groups exhibited a slightly lower Vonset (0.62 V for Ag/AgCl). The intrinsic S–O interactions17 in bis-EDOT-TB induced a coplanar structure even though the side groups were bulky due to associations between TEG and lithium ions.

The oxidation behavior was investigated in PEDOT-TB films prepared from the corresponding monomers by electrochemical polymerization on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The oxidation potentials decreased and the overall peaks became broader as the concentration of LiTFSI was increased to 5 mM in CH3CN, unlike the case of PEDOT.13 Reynolds et al. reported previously that broad cyclic voltammograms and low peaks were associated with an increase in the electroactivity of a film.17 Therefore, we conclude that lithium ions doped the PEDOT-TB film by strongly associating with the TEGs, which enhanced the material's electrical properties.

        PEP was conducted to fabricate s-DSSCs. Upon photoexcitation of Z-907, electrons were injected from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2. The oxidized dye was regenerated by the oxidized monomer, which initiated polymerization of the monomers to cover the surface of the Z-907-sensitized TiO2 electrode to form a polymer film. The extent of excitation weakened as the polymer film grew and screened the light incident on the dye. As a result, the current density decreased. Therefore, the quantity of charge injected into the TiO2 bands during PEP was proportional to the extent of polymerization, which was related either to the number of chains generated during PEP or to the degree of polymerization (DP) of a chain. In turn, these properties were correlated with the density of the film and the thickness, respectively.
The current traces recorded during the in situPEP of bis-EDOT and bis-EDOT-TB on the surfaces of Z907-sensitized TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 4(a). The quantity of charge injected for the bis-EDOT-TB system was greater than that injected for the bis-EDOT system, indicating that higher quantities of bis-EDOT-TB than of bis-EDOT participated in the PEP process. The polymer film thickness was calculated according to the quantity of corresponding charge transferred during the PEP process to achieve polymer film formation on the FTO. The thicknesses of the PEDOT and PEDOT-TB films were similar, 179 and 162 μm, respectively, despite the differing quantities of charge transferred during the PEP processes (bis-EDOT-TB polymerized to a greater extent). These results suggested that PEP produced oligomeric PEDOT-TB.

The current–voltage characteristics of the optimized devices were measured under AM 1.5 solar conditions (Fig. 4(b)). The device-B prepared with PEDOT-TB yielded higher values of JSC (7.0 mA cm−2) and η (2.9%) compared with those (4.2 mA cm−2, 1.6%) of the control device (device-A) prepared with PEDOT. It should be noted that VOC for device-A was low, 0.60 V, compared with the published value of 0.69 V, even though the conditions applied were those reported previously.9 The 67% increase in JSC may have been due to the low molecular weight of PEDOT-TB. However, device-A, prepared with a shorter PEP time (10 min) expected to produce low-molecular-weight PEDOT, exhibited a lower JSC (3.6 mA cm−2).13 Therefore, the higher JSC for device-B was partly ascribed to the decreased series resistance (Rs), as shown in Table 2. Rs for device-B was 38 Ω, which was 57 Ω smaller than that (95 Ω) of device-A. This result was consistent with the trend observed in the conductivities (σ), measured using the 4-point probe method (PEDOT-TB (56 S cm−1) and PEDOT (34 S cm−1) (see Table 1)). In turn, the increased σ for the PEDOT-TB may have resulted from intrinsic S–O interactions and the association between TEG in the PEDOT-TB with lithium ions. In addition, the hydrophilicity of TEG may have improved the compatibility with EmITFSI, including LiTFSI, as demonstrated in the water contact angle (Θwater) measurements (see the insets in Fig. 4(a)). Θwater for the PEDOT-TB film was 22.5°, which was 49.9° smaller than that (72.4°) of the PEDOT film. This indicated the effective doping of lithium ions by association with TEG. Indeed, the resistance (680 Ω) of a lithium ion-doped PEDOT-TB film was much smaller than that (6970 Ω) of a PEDOT film at 0 V under dark conditions,13 consistent with literature reports.18 Additional advantages of TEG in PEDOT-TB are the charge screening effects, as reported by Durrant et al.10a and Snaith et al.3c The electron lifetimes (τe) of the devices in the dark were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with fits to an equivalent circuit. The τe (2.30 ms) measured in device-B was longer than that (1.71 ms) measured in device-A. This indicated that recombination reactions among the injected electrons with oxidized species were delayed due to charge screening effects.3c

In summary, we successfully synthesized a novel HTM, bis-EDOT-TB, which included two TEG groups on a benzene linker connecting the two thiophene moieties. This novel HTM strongly chelated lithium ions (Ka = 495 M−1) and showed good compatibility with other components (EmITSFI) due to the presence of TEG. In addition, the strong intrinsic S–O interactions stabilized a highly coplanar PEDOT-TB conformation, even after high doping of lithium ions. These characteristics improved the conductivity and effective charge screening, which retarded recombination reactions of the photoinduced electrons with oxidized HTMs. s-DSSC fabricated with bis-EDOT-TB showed great improvements in both JSC (4.2 to 7.0 mA cm−2) and η (1.6 to 2.9%). Optimization studies to improve VOC (0.60 V), which was low compared with other values (0.69 V) and investigation of new sensitizers, such as indoline D149,9 are underway.
