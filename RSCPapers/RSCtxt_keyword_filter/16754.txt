Here, we report the successful use of a new quasi-liquid, polymer-based electrolyte containing the Co3+/Co2+ redox mediator in 3-methoxy propionitrile solvent in order to overcome the limitations of high cell resistance, low diffusion coefficient and rapid recombination losses. The performance of the solar cells containing the polymer based electrolytes increased by a factor of 1.2 with respect to an analogous electrolyte without the polymer. The performances of the fabricated DSCs have been investigated in detail by photovoltaic, transient electron measurements, EIS, Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy. This approach offers an effective way to make high-performance and long-lasting DSCs.IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells were significantly improved upon by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 and have since been extensively studied as a promising technology for renewable energy production because of their potential to offer good energy conversion efficiency at a low cost.1,2 The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is a photoelectrochemical device and comprises a high-surface area, nanostructured working electrode consisting of a dye-sensitized mesoporous, semiconductor film and a platinised counter electrode connected by a redox-active electrolyte containing the oxidized and reduced forms of a redox mediator. Recently, cobalt(II)/(III) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) complexes have emerged as new and promising one-electron, outer-sphere redox couples that offer high photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies and high photovoltages.3,4 This result has encouraged the transition to non-iodide redox mediator systems in the DSCs, which also gives the possibility to overcome the detrimental effects, such as corrosion and visible light absorption, observed using the most commonly used iodine-based redox mediators.5–9However, a common drawback of coordination compound redox couples is a much faster recombination between them and injected electrons in the semiconductor substrate of the working electrode. Previous research has also suggested that cobalt-based redox mediators are limited in DSCs by mass-transport because of the low diffusion coefficients in the electrolyte, and in particular inside the mesoporous semiconductor film.10–12 The poor mass-transport properties are responsible for sluggish dye regeneration and the low fill factor experimentally observed as a high series resistance.10,13,14 In order to overcome this problem, focus has been given to the modification of the cobalt complex ligands, the smaller the better,13,15,16 and/or replacing the sensitizing dyes consisting of ruthenium complexes with organic dyes.5,7,17 Kim et al.10 reported that by controlling the mesoporous film porosity and pore size it is possible to improve the mass transport properties. However, not many reports11,12,18,19 describe possible strategies to overcome the problems with high series resistance, low diffusion coefficient and rapid recombination losses in DSCs based on cobalt redox electrolyte mediators.In this work, we report a new approach to overcome the limitations of high cell resistance, low diffusion coefficient and rapid recombination losses by introducing a polymer component into the DSC electrolyte. We have chosen poly(vinylidine fluoride) (PVDF) as a polymer guest due to its robust chemical properties. Electrolytes containing the PVDF polymer are expected to have a very high stability due to the strong electron withdrawing functional group – CF. Moreover, a polymer such as PVDF may render a higher degree of ion-pair dissociation and thus a higher concentration of charge carriers.20 The present work is devoted to the comparative study of the effects of adding PVDF to cobalt-based electrolytes in 3-methoxy propionitrile (MPN) solvent in DSCs.Experimental methodsMaterials and methodsAll chemicals (research grade) were used as purchased. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) was purchased from Apollo Scientific, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was purchased from Aldrich, and 3-methoxy propionitrile and LiClO4 were purchased from Fluka. The cobalt complexes were prepared as reported earlier.5 The dye D-35 was purchased from Dyenamo AB, Sweden. The TiO2 pastes (DSL 18NR-T and WER2-O) were purchased from Dyesol Ltd.Electrolyte preparationPoly(vinylidine fluoride) was dissolved in 3-methoxy propionitrile (1.5 wt%) by stirring at 120 °C for 2.5 h. After allowing the solution to cool to room temperature, 0.05 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)3], 0.22 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2], 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were added to the above prepared solution and mixed until completely dissolved (CP1). Another electrolyte with 0.05 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)3], 0.22 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2], 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was also prepared in 3-methoxy propionitrile without PVDF (CM1) for comparative studies.Electrodes preparationThe conducting glass substrates (fluorine-doped, tin oxide–FTO, Pilkington, TEC15) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with soap water, acetone and ethanol, each for 20 minutes. The FTO glass substrates were then pre-treated by immersing them into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min after which they were washed with water and ethanol. For the TiO2 screen-printing paste the following recipe was utilized: TiO2 paste 60 wt% (DSL 18NR-T, Dyesol) mixed with 36 wt% terpineol and 4 wt% ethyl cellulose to form a homogenous paste. Mesoporous TiO2 films of 0.25 cm2 area were prepared by screen printing and then the glass electrodes were kept in an EtOH atmosphere for 5 min and subsequently dried at 120 °C for 8–10 min, and then the procedure was repeated for a second time in order to generate a uniform film (thickness 5 μm, Veeco Dektak 3). After the electrodes had cooled down a light-scattering TiO2 layer (WER2-O, Dyesol) was deposited. The prepared electrodes were sintered in an oven in an ambient atmosphere in a stepwise fashion; 180 °C (10 min), 325 °C (10 min), 420 °C (10 min), and 450 °C (30 min). After the sintering process, the electrodes were once again treated with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed as described above. Again, the plates were sintered at 500 °C (30 min) as the final stage of preparation (thickness 7.5 μm, Veeco Dektak 3). After the final sintering step, the electrodes were cooled to 80 °C and were immediately immersed into a dye bath containing 0.25 M D35 in ethanol and left overnight. The platinized counter electrodes (Pilkington, TEC15) were prepared by depositing 20 μl of 4.8 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution on a pre-drilled FTO glass; the Pt films were sintered in air at 400 °C for 30 min.Solar cell fabricationThe TiO2 working electrodes and the platinized counter electrodes were assembled in a sandwich-type device using a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame (Solaronix), and the electrolyte was filled through a pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode glass substrate. Finally, the hole was sealed with a Surlyn sheet and glass cover slip.Solar cell characterisationCurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 1000 W m−2 or with the help of a neutral density filter to 100 W m−2. In order to reduce the scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer and to avoid additional contribution from light falling on the device outside the active area, a light-shading mask (0.7 × 0.7 cm2) was used. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were recorded using monochromatic light from a system consisting of a xenon lamp, monochromators, appropriate filters and a potentiostat, calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). Electron lifetimes for the solar cells were estimated using a green light-emitting diode (Luxeon, 1 W) as the light source. Voltage and current traces were recorded using a 16-bit resolution data acquisition board (DAQ National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research SR570). The relation between potential and charge was studied using a combined voltage decay/charge extraction method. Charge extraction measurements were carried out as follows: the solar cell was illuminated for 5 s under open-circuit conditions, and then the light was switched off and the voltage was allowed to decay to a voltage V. At a certain voltage V, the cell was short-circuited, and the current was determined under 10 s and then integrated to obtain the charge, Qoc (V). Lifetimes were determined by monitoring the photovoltage response after a small perturbation of the light intensity.Spectroscopic techniquesThe absorption characteristics of the electrolytes diluted in MPN and PVDF–MPN were recorded using a Varian UV-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 300Bio) and a Bio-Rad FTS 6000 Raman spectrometer equipped with a Raman accessory. An excitation wavelength of 1064 nm (Nd:YAG laser), a quartz beam splitter and a resolution of 4 cm−1 were used. Scattered radiation was detected using a nitrogen-cooled solid state germanium detector.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)EIS investigations were carried out using an Autolab PGstat12 potentiostat with an impedance module operating in the frequency range 1000 KHz to 0.01 Hz, under a single sine function at 20 mV AC amplitude and under light conditions with an applied bias potential. The EIS measurements of complete DSCs were made under suitable conditions (dark or light illumination conditions were investigated). The resulting impedance curves were fitted using a least-squares fitting procedure adopted using the EQU-VCRT computer programme.21,22Electrochemical measurementsThe electrochemical measurements were made using an Iviumstat XR potentiostat. The working electrode used was a glassy carbon microfiber disk microelectrode supplied by BASi, West Lafayette, USA, with a diameter of (11 ± 2) μm (catalog number MF-2007). The exact surface was determined by recording a cyclic voltammogram of K3Fe(CN)6, for which the diffusion coefficient is known (7.17 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at 25 °C in 0.5 M KCl, pH = 3) according to literature procedures.23 The temperature was regulated to 25 °C by a thermostat. A two-electrode cell was used, using a graphite rod (3 mm in diameter) as both the counter and reference electrode. The scan rate used was 10 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a Mini-Autolab potentiostat with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The glassy carbon and platinum electrodes were used as working and counter electrodes with Ag+/AgNO3 as the reference electrode using 0.1 M tetra-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. Solutions with concentrations of 5 mM were used and 5 mM ferrocene solution was used as reference. The reference electrode was calibrated against Fc/Fc+ and potentials were converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale by using a value of 630 mV vs. NHE for Fc/Fc+.Results and discussionsPhotovoltaic performancesI–V-curves for DSCs containing the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1a and b, representing two different light intensities. Cells containing the CM1 electrolyte display an efficiency of 5.6% and those containing the CP1 electrolyte 6.4% at 1 sun light intensity. The I–V-characteristics are given in Table 1. The DSCs containing the CM1 electrolyte show about 20 mV higher Voc than cells containing the electrolyte CP1. It is notable that the shape of the I–V-curves reflects mass-transport problems at higher light intensities by a larger V–I-slope (higher resistance) and a lower fill-factor. Moreover, the I–V-measurements under dark conditions (dark-current measurements) (Fig. S1, ESI†) also show a steep rise in the dark current at high forward voltage bias, which is dominated by the reaction of electrons with the oxidized redox species over the mesoporous TiO2 interface.24 However, currents are very low at lower bias voltages, indicating low dark currents and rather low recombination loss effects. Fig. 1  I–V-curves of the DSCs containing the two different electrolytes at two different light intensities: 1 sun (a) and 1/10 sun (b) under AM 1.5 illumination sensitized with D-35.

Further work on stability of this new redox system is under investigation.Incident-photon-to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded for the DSCs containing the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes (Fig. 2). The CP1-based DSCs perform slightly better with respect to light response. The IPCE values for both types of electrolytes show remarkably good values in the visible region, around 70–88% from 380 nm to 560 nm. Since the IPCE spectra were recorded at low light intensity, the mass-transport limitations obvious in the I–V-curves at 1 sun illumination level will not be obvious in the IPCE spectra. Fig. 2  Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSCs CM1 and CP1 containing the two different electrolytes. Transient electron measurementsThe electron lifetime gives an estimate of the rate of recombination loss from the TiO2. The lifetime measurement is performed by using a modulated light source under bias light conditions and by measuring the photo-voltage response of the solar cells. The electron lifetime (τe) as a function of voltage is plotted for DSCs containing the electrolytes CM1 and CP1, respectively (Fig. 3). At zero current, equivalent to open-circuit conditions, the values originating from DSCs containing CM1 and CP1 are highly similar, indicating that the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 film is essentially the same in both systems. The curve from DSCs containing the CP1 electrolyte shows longer electron lifetimes at lower voltages indicating lower recombination losses. These results are consistent with those from impedance spectroscopy (EIS, vide infra). The longer lifetimes observed are also consistent with a higher photocurrent, as noted in the I–V characteristics of cells containing the CP1 electrolyte. The higher open circuit voltage for CM1 cells may be due to an increase in quasi-Fermi level EF,n as the measured voltage directly relates to the EF,n value of the TiO2 film.25 The lifetime (τe) as a function of quasi-Fermi level EF,n is shown in Fig. S2.† Fig. 3  Electron lifetimes as a function of open-circuit voltage for DSCs containing the two different electrolytes in DSCs: CM1 and CP1. The extracted charge Qoc as a function of Voc is shown in Fig. 4 for the DSCs containing the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes, respectively. The data clearly show that the solar cells containing the PVDF polymer as an additive to the electrolyte display significantly more collected charge than the solar cells with a MPN-based electrolyte only. At the maximum power point of the two types of solar cells, the DSCs containing the CP1 electrolyte shows nearly twice as high charge density as those containing the CM1 electrolyte. This results from higher electron injection and an increased value in the Jsc for CP1, which is also evident from the I–V curve and also in good agreement with the electron life time measurements. The redox potentials for CM1 and CP1 measured through cyclic voltammetry shows comparable values. The slight increase in the current for CP1 can also explain the higher conductivity of CP1 with respect to CM1 (Fig. S7†). Fig. 4  Extracted charge as a function of open-circuit voltage for DSCs containing the two different electrolytes in the cells: CM1 and CP1. The electron lifetime (τe) is shown as a function of total charge in Fig. 5. At lower charge the lifetime of CP1 is considerably longer, whereas it becomes essentially similar to that of CM1 at higher charge. It can also be noted that the transport time is considerably longer in the TiO2 films of CM1 containing DSCs (Fig. 6). This effect can outweigh the longer lifetimes, since the risk of recombination loss increases as transport time becomes longer. It can be speculated that a high degree of dissociated Co(III) can affect both transport and lifetimes. Fig. 5  Electron lifetime as a function of extracted charge under open-circuit conditions for DSCs CM1 and CP1.  Fig. 6  Electron transport time as a function of short circuit current density for the two different fabricated DSCs CM1 and CP1. The dependence of the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage on light intensity is shown in Fig. 7a and b. Since the data obtained refer to quite low light intensities the current response is close to linear. The voltage response is, excluding the data points at the lowest light intensity, fairly linear with a slope of 64.8 and 94.5 mV per decade for the two types of DSCs: CP1 and CM1 respectively. This corresponds to a non-ideal Nernstian response, which in sensitized AgBr has been linked to dye adsorption site inhomogeneity, such as dye aggregation.26 Fig. 7  Short-circuit current (a) and open-circuit voltage (b) responses as a function of light intensity at low intensities for DSCs containing the two different electrolytes. Electrochemistry and spectroscopic studiesThe diffusion coefficients of the cobalt redox mediators were found from diffusion-limiting current experiments based on slow-scan cyclic voltammetry at 25 °C and were calculated for [Co(bpy)3]3+ in the CM1 electrolyte to be 1.82 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and 4.10 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 in the CP1 electrolyte (Fig. S8 and S9†). The diffusion coefficients obtained clearly indicate that mass-transport should be less of a problem in DSCs containing the CP1 electrolyte than in those containing CM1. These results are also confirmed by the overall electrolyte conductivities of the respective electrolytes determined from the impedance spectroscopy studies (vide infra). A higher Co(III)-ion mobility is expected to render a higher photocurrent and a higher fill-factor, and ultimately lead to better performance. The noted difference in the diffusion coefficients of Co3+ in the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes cannot be extracted either from Raman or UV-vis spectra, since no pronounced spectral difference can be observed (Fig. S3–S6 and Table S1†).EIS studiesThe Nyquist plots of DSCs containing the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes are shown in Fig. 8. Impedance spectroscopy was performed on full DSC cells under an applied bias potential. The curves were fitted to an electrochemical model using a least-squares procedure. The cells containing the CM1 and CP1 electrolytes display nearly the same resistance at the FTO surface (Rs) and at the counter electrode (Rct). There is a marked difference in the electron recombination resistance (Rrec), and also in the low-frequency region related to the diffusion impedance of the electrolytes. Further, PVDF with its relatively high dielectric constant can assist in greater ionization of salts, and thus provide a high concentration of charge carriers.20 Hence, an increase in photocurrent can result. Moreover, from the two EIS curves, we can note that the total internal resistance of cells containing the CP1 electrolyte, which is the sum of Rs, Rct and Rrec is much lower than for cells containing the CM1 electrolyte. Fig. 8  Nyquist plots of DSCs CM1 and CP1 with different electrolytes. The electron life time was calculated from the EIS data using the expression, τ = (RQ)1/n(1)It is found that the electron lifetimes (τs) obtained from the toolbox measurements and from the impedance spectroscopy match comparably well. Differences may be attributed to the different conditions under which the cells were studied; at open-circuit in the toolbox experiments and under short-circuit in the EIS experiments. The conductivity (σ) was calculated according to the equation below. σ = l/RA(2)The various parameters obtained from the EIS measurements are given in Table 2. The conductivities of the both CM1 and CP1 compare well with their performances.

It is well known in lithium-ion battery electrolytes that addition of a polymer increases ion mobility, and it has been speculated that ion-pair dissociation can be involved. Such an effect is difficult to experimentally prove by direct measurements, and you are normally confined to indirect effects, such as changes in electric and dielectric properties of the system (like in our study). However, using isotopic labelling of Na+ and I− in polymer-supported electrolytes of relevance to DSC systems, investigating the likelihood of a Grotthuss mechanism of conductivity in iodine-based electrolyte systems with high iodine concentrations; an alternative, and equally plausible explanation, is instead based on a high degree of ion-pair dissociation and consequently a higher apparent diffusion constant.27ConclusionIn this study, we successfully explored the possibility of using cobalt redox mediators in a polymer matrix and its application as an electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells. The polymer-based cobalt redox mediator DCSs yielded 6.4% and 8.1% at 1 sun and 0.1 sun respectively, and outperform the analogous device based on solvent used for comparison by a factor of 1.2. This also indicates a promising use for indoor applications. Photovoltaic performance, transient electron measurements and impedance spectroscopy show that the polymer-based cobalt redox mediator works more efficiently. The addition of the polymer increases ionic mobility and also we hypothesize that ion-pair dissociation also plays an important role. The new polymer-based cobalt redox mediator performed better in overcoming the limitations of high cell resistance, low diffusion coefficients, rapid recombination losses and to some extent the mass-transport limitations. We believe that this piece of work on dye-sensitized solar cells will open new ideas and thoughts to make practical application DSCs.ReferencesB. O. Regan and M.
