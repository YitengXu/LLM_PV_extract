    , Accepted 30th August 2022First published on 3rd September 2022AbstractFeaturing soft ionic lattices of PbI6 octahedral frameworks, halide perovskites confront multiple occurrences of force-driven structural collapse (e.g., humidity, heat and illumination), initially on the surface and finally in the bulk, and ultimately protecting unstable PbI6 octahedral frameworks is necessary yet challenging in the process of perovskite–photovoltaic applications. Herein, a well-designed PbI6 octahedra-governing strategy with the functional synergism of cations and anions from vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate has been implemented. On the one hand, the SO3CF3− anions simultaneously anchor uncoordinated Pb2+ cations and replace unstable I− ions on the PbI6 frameworks of the perovskite surface, effectively passivating the I− defects and stabilizing the PbI6 octahedral structure. On the other hand, poly(vinylaniline) cations obtained by the UV-induced polymerization of vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate on the perovskite surface trigger compressive stress on the bulk-phase PbI6 frameworks and inhibit ion migration of I− under operating conditions. The anchoring-polymerization protection strategy is universal for modifying perovskite-involved multi-interfaces in large-area modules to tolerate harsh conditions (e.g., storage at 85 °C and 85% RH, working at 85 °C + one-sun illumination). Both high power conversion efficiency and stable continuous output on the as-modified modules were finally realized. Based on the above modules with multi-interfacial modification, a proof-of-concept outdoor automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system has been successfully demonstrated, showing great potential in building the future of stable and practical perovskite photovoltaics.

Broader context
For the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics, there are still some critical problems need to be comprehensively considered, referring to defect passivation, structural stabilization and charge transfer enhancement. Particularly, for multi-interfacial perovskite solar modules (PSMs), the chemical regulation of PbI6 octahedral frameworks can endow PSMs with both high efficiency and stability, comparable to commercialized silicon solar cells. Herein, we report that a multifunctional molecular modifier, UV-polymerized vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate (VT), acts as interlayers within PSMs (including perovskite–HTL, perovskite–Au and perovskite–air interfaces). VT molecules with SO3CF3− anions and vinylaniline cations with alkene groups are adapted to protect perovskite-involved surfaces, and two main aspects are proposed: (1) strong Pb–O coordination between SO3CF3− and perovskite replaces unstable I− ions of surface PbI6 octahedra to enhance charge transfer and structural stability; (2) UV-induced polymerization in alkene groups compresses bulk-phase PbI6 octahedra to inhibit ion migration. The VT molecules are applicable to perovskite-involved interfaces, and thus the as-protected PSMs have demonstrated high efficiency and stability comparable to that of commercialized silicon solar cells. Notably, a proof-of-concept automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system has been built and our PSMs on it have shown repeatable and practical output outdoors. This study has greatly increased public confidence in PSM commercialization.

Introduction
Excellent photoelectric properties of organic-inorganic halide perovskites have been demonstrated in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 25.7% has been reached in small-area PSCs.1,2 However, large-area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with both high PCE and operation stability are still challenging, particularly comparable to silicon-based solar cells.3,4 Following one of the International Electrotechnical Commission standards (IEC 61215:2016), commercial silicon-based solar cells should maintain <5% relative loss in PCE after a damp-heat aging test at 85 °C and 85% RH for 1000 hours.5–7 While the related stability tests have been demonstrated in lab-level single-cell PSCs, an effective strategy for endowing PSMs with the above comparable stability properties is necessary, yet challenging.8,9
In the whole level of PSMs, their individual functional layers (including the perovskite layers, electron transport layers (ETLs), hole transport layers (HTLs), and counter electrodes), relevant interfaces, and outside encapsulation layers should be comprehensively engineered to satisfy practical demands.10–12 The outside encapsulation layers of photovoltaic devices, acting as the first defensive line against oxygen and moisture, have been demonstrated to be one of the best ways to address their stability issues and enhance the device lifetime, and the outer physical encapsulation by employing high-barrier-performance materials and structures have been widely adapted.13,14 The stability of inner PSMs should also be emphasized. Considering perovskites with multiple defects, soft ionic lattices and multi-interfaces within perovskite-related devices, their chemical regulations referring to defect passivation, structural stabilization and charge transfer enhancement are critical. Particularly, due to the series connections of multiple sub-cells (i.e., P1, P2 and P3 interconnections), the increasing perovskite-relevant interfaces in PSMs, compared with the single-cell PSCs, demand systematic considerations in chemical regulations to enhance both PSMs' efficiency and stability (Fig. S1, ESI†).15 Among them, three main aspects are of great importance: (1) most intuitively, the stable surface and bulk of defect-minimizing perovskite films with reinforced PbI6 octahedral frameworks against force-driven structural collapse (e.g., humidity, heat, illumination),16 (2) the usage of inorganic ETLs/HTLs or dopant-free organic ones with stable feature and high charge mobility,17 and (3) the structure-stable multi-interfaces in PSMs, including the ETL–perovskite, perovskite–HTL and HTL–metal interfaces for PSMs' efficiency and stability, and the perovskite–metal and perovskite–air interfaces for PSMs’ stability.18 Recently, a series of doping-free organic or inorganic HTLs (such as PTAA, P3HT, CuSCN, and NiOx) have been developed to maintain self-structural stability and inhibit ion migration between perovskite layers and metal counter electrodes.19–23 In addition, the optimization of perovskite buried surface by forming adjoining layers between the perovskite structure and ETLs,24,25 such as ZnO/ZnS/PbS, FASnClx, can not only facilitate electron transfer but also stabilize the perovskite structure. For the perovskite structure, the intrinsic deep and shallow defects, including vacancies, interstitials, and antistites, have been effectively manipulated by crystallization regulation and surface passivation,26,27 and the fine control of perovskite-involved multi-interfaces has been proven to be of prime importance for photovoltaic performance.28 However, the interface-engineering strategies used for single-cell PSCs are not always workable for multi-subcell PSMs with perovskite-involved multi-interfaces.29 Thus, an available and holistic strategy for high-stability PSMs with high PCE, based on the interface engineering of PbI6 octahedral frameworks, is considered to be in high demand for PSMs.
Herein, we report that a multifunctional molecular modifier, vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate (VT), enables the governing of PbI6 octahedral frameworks and perovskite-involved multi-interfaces for highly-stable PSMs with high PCE. The coordination anchoring of trifluoromethane sulfonic anions and UV-induced polymerization of vinylaniline cations on the perovskite surface sufficiently govern I− vacancies (i.e., missing and unstable I− anions) and the residual stress of PbI6 octahedral frameworks, respectively. After the modification of poly(vinylaniline) trifluoromethanesulfonate (PVT) on perovskite, the perovskite–HTL interface was greatly stabilized, across which the hole extraction was enhanced. Particularly, PVT perfectly stabilized the perovskite–Au (inhabitation of Au and I ionic migration) and perovskite–air (moisture resistance) interfaces that play a key role in the long-term operation stability of PSMs. Correspondingly, the assembled PSMs by molecular modification realized PCEs over 22% (18 cm2). The encapsulated PSMs retained >97% of the initial efficiency after harsh damp-heat storage (i.e., 85 °C and 85% RH) for 1000 h (>91% for 2000 h), and exhibited stable PCE output upon illumination-heat testing (i.e., one-sun, 85 °C and 60% RH). For comparing with silicon-based solar cells, a proof-of-concept automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system was built, and it showed repeatable and practical output outdoors. This study will greatly increase the confidence in research on PSM commercialization.
Discussion
Molecular anchoring and polymerization on perovskite surfaces to enhance device performance
The vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate (VT) molecules are a typical kind of ion-pairing compound with lone-pair electrons and strong ionic bonding energy between the cationic vinylaniline (VAn+) and anionic trifluoromethanesulfonate (SO3CF3−), indicating their bifunctional characteristics after modifying the perovskite surface (Fig. 1a). For one thing, using SO3CF3− anions to anchor perovskites is predicted to provide revised Lewis acid-base pairs with PbI6 octahedral frameworks due to the strong bond enthalpy of Pb–O (382 kJ mol−1), compared to that of Pb–I (142 kJ mol−1).30 For another thing, compared with the commonly used alkyl ammonium cations,31 the VAn+ cations with CC bonds are sensitive to polymerization under UV or heating treatments, and the polymerization-induced shrinkage is also hypothesized to reinforce PbI6 octahedral frameworks.32,33

Herein, the VT molecules were firstly synthesized by mixing equimolar vinylaniline and trifluorosulfonic acid in isopropanol at room temperature (see the ESI,† for more details). The successful synthesis of high-purity VT molecules was proved by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS), with the negative fragment peak and positive fragment peak at 148.95 and 120.08 belonging to SO3CF3− and VAn+, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). The isopropanol solution of VT was then coated onto perovskite films to form VT thin layers (Fig. 1b, Step 1. The perovskite modified with VT is denoted as VT in the figures or PVK–VT in the text.), and subsequent UV irradiation at room temperature induced in situ polymerization to form thin layers of poly-vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate (PVT) on perovskite films (Fig. 1b, Step 2. The perovskite film modified with PVT is denoted as PVT in the figures or PVK–PVT in the text). The uniform distribution of S, O, and F elements on PVK–PVT proves the PVT modification on the perovskite films (Fig. S3, ESI†). The direct anchoring and polymerization of VT on the perovskite surface were later confirmed. The featured Raman signal of Pb–O bonds on both PVK–VT and PVK–PVT films indicates the anchoring interaction of SO3CF3− anions with Pb2+ cations from PbI6 octahedral frameworks (Fig. 1c), and the XPS signal of Pb 4f exhibits a corresponding shift after VT modification (Fig. S4, ESI†). Furthermore, the 1470 cm−1 characteristic peak belonging to CC vibration appeared on PVK–VT and then disappeared on PVK–PVT, in combination with UV-vis spectra of PVK–VT and PVK–PVT films, demonstrating the successful UV-polymerization of the VT layer (Fig. S5, ESI†).
After the anchoring and polymerization of VT on the perovskite surface, the as-formed PVK–PVT exhibited enhanced device performance. Note that the VT/PVT modifier on the perovskite film forms a gradient energy level between the perovskite and HTL, which is desirable for efficient hole transport (Fig. S6, ESI†). The all-round photovoltaic parameters of n–i–p planar PSCs with the configuration of FTO/ETL/FACsPbI3/PVT/HTL/Au (Fig. 1d) were elaborately selected, using ZnTiO3–ZnS as the ETL to form band alignment and stable Zn–S–Pb coherent interlayer to promote ETL–perovskite interaction, and using the relatively stable FACsPbI3 component as the perovskite layer.24,34 The VT solution in isopropanol was optimized to be the concentration of 0.03 mg mL−1, and the dose of 15 μL for each 2 × 2 cm2 perovskite film (Fig. S7a and Table S1, ESI†). The optimized UV-exposure time for VT polymerization on the perovskite layer was three minutes (Fig. S7b and Table S2, ESI†). The modified PSCs with PVT interlayer reached a maximum PCE of 24.35% (with a negligible hysteresis <5%) with VOC of 1.185 V, JSC of 25.47 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 80.69%. In contrast, the control devices without modifier exhibited a maximum efficiency of only 22.13% with a VOC of 1.168 V, JSC of 25.20 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 75.21% (Fig. 1e). The integrated JSC of the best PVT device derived from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum reached 24.62 mA cm−2, superior to the best control PSC (24.48 mA cm−2, Fig. S8, ESI†). Also, 30 individual PVT devices (Fig. S9, ESI†) showed an average PCE of 23.07%, superior to the control PSCs (i.e., 21.07%), demonstrating the reproducibility and reliability of performance enhancement using PVT interlayers. Besides the PCE improvement, the unencapsulated PVT device displayed enhanced storage stability as it maintained 91.38% of its original PCE after 1000 h under dark conditions (25 °C and 20–30% RH), while the control device quickly declined to ∼40% of its original PCE under the same conditions (Fig. 1f). Based on all the results mentioned above, it was proved that the anchoring and polymerization of VT molecules on perovskites effectively brought about high performance of PSCs, motivating us to further study the underlying mechanism therein.
Iodide management of surface PbI6 octahedral frameworks to resist external force
It has been demonstrated that the VAnI (i.e., VAn+ + I−) treatment on PbI2 or α-FAPbI3 could form 2D-VAn2PbI4 perovskite,33 due to the low formation energy of 2D perovskites (see eqn (1)). However, no 2D/Quasi-2D structure was observed after modifying PbI2 or α-FAPbI3 with VT (i.e., VAn+ + SO3CF3−) molecules (Fig. S10, ESI†). To understand the interaction between perovskite and VT molecules, the high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (HS-LEISS) was used to directly unclose the coordination state of surface PbI6 octahedral frameworks.35 The I− and Pb2+ peaks in the perovskite film emerged at the kinetic energies of 2.7 and 3.4 keV (Fig. 2a–c), respectively, and showed a gradual evolution from outer to inner during the in situ Ne+ etching. According to the sensitive factors and peak area of I− and Pb2+, the I:Pb molar ratios in PbI6 octahedral frameworks from perovskite films with different depths could be obtained (Fig. 2d). It was found that the I:Pb molar ratio for the control (from 3.56:1 to 2.90:1) exhibited an opposite trend to that of PVK–VT (from 2.57:1 to 2.86:1) and PVK–PVT (from 2.59:1 to 2.91:1). Note that the ideal I:Pb molar ratio of bulk-phase PbI6 octahedral frameworks should be close to 3:1, and a nonstoichiometric I:Pb ratio (>3:1) would be observed in the perovskite surface without modification, owing to the stopped growth of the periodic crystal structure from the bulk phase to the surface. Instead, the PVK–VT and PVK–PVT displayed a lower ratio of I/Pb than 3 from surface PbI6 frameworks, indicating that some of the unstable terminal I− ions on the PbI6 frameworks of the perovskite surface were replaced by SO3CF3− ions. In addition, the thickness of capping layers was calculated to be ∼1.1 nm. Each SO3CF3− anion can bind to at most three Pb2+ ions to form three Pb–O bonds,36 or chelate one Pb2+ cation to form one O–Pb–O bond.37 The SO3CF3− ions have strong binding on surface octahedral frameworks, which would terminate the perovskite surface and inhibit its conversion into 2D-VAn2PbI4 (see eqn (2)). The different reactions of VAnI and VAnSO3CF3 on the perovskite surface are shown as follows: 2VAnI + FAPbI3 → VAn2PbI4 + FAI(1) VAnSO3CF3 + FAPbI3 → FAPb(I3−x(SO3CF3)x) + xVAnI + (1 − x)VAnSO3CF3(2)

Surface iodide management by SO3CF3− anions effectively decrease film defects, as demonstrated by the space-charge-limited current test in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the Urbach energy test in Fig. S12 (ESI†) and the carrier lifetime test in Fig. S13 (ESI†). By the perovskite films’ PL mapping (Fig. S14, ESI†), the higher PL intensity and narrower emission band suggested that defect passivation on PVK–PVT facilitated effective hole extraction. The defect passivation on PVK by SO3CF3− was further demonstrated by theoretical calculations (Fig. 2e–g) using density functional theory (DFT). The PbI6 octahedral frameworks of the perovskite surface with SO3CF3− modification had a much higher formation energy of iodide defect (3.648 eV) than that of the control without surface modification (3.424 eV).
Benefiting from the SO3CF3− anchoring and subsequent defect reduction, the structural stability (upon heat, humidity and illumination) of perovskites' octahedral frameworks was holistically enhanced. For heat stability, the PVK–VT and PVK–PVT films displayed less, and even no decomposition upon heating at 85 °C for 96 h as compared to the control film, demonstrating the improved thermal stability of PbI6 octahedral frameworks assisted by SO3CF3− (Fig. S15, ESI†). For humidity stability, the three kinds of films were stored under 60–70% RH conditions and the relative ratio of δ-FAPbI3(001)/α-FAPbI3(100) was compared (Fig. S16, ESI†). While PVK–VT and PVK–PVT maintained the α-FAPbI3 phase well, the undesired δ-FAPbI3 continuously appeared in the control film with increasing aging time. For illumination stability, the aged perovskite films exposed to AM 1.5G illumination in N2 were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After aging for 24 hours, the obvious Pb0 signal was detected in the control film but not in the PVK–VT or PVK–PVT film (Fig. 2g–i). Overall, surface iodide management assisted by SO3CF3− enabled the effective protection of PbI6 octahedral frameworks against external force-driven structural collapse, effectively enhancing phase stability. Notedly, the VT molecules without and with polymerization are discussed together here, and a relatively high structural stability was observed in PVK–PVT. In principle, the polymerized VAn+ cations might play another key role in stabilizing perovskites.
Stress regulation of bulk-phase PbI6 octahedral frameworks to inhibit internal force-induced ion migration
As shown in eqn (2), SO3CF3− anions of VT molecules strongly bind with Pb2+ cations, and the rest of VAn+ cations don’t form 2D perovskites but polymerize on perovskites, which would alter the stress of as-covered PbI6 octahedral frameworks. Particularly, the ubiquitous residual stress of perovskite films on rigid FTO substrates, due to mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion (∼5 × 10−5vs. ∼9 × 10−6 °C−1),38,39 is difficult to be released once it accumulates within perovskites, which would hurt their long-term structural stability. In our case, the UV-induced in situ polymerization of VAn+ could solve the undesirable residual stress of PbI6 octahedral frameworks. Depth-dependent GIXRD measurements were taken to reveal the crystal lattice and the residual stress within perovskite films.40 In a classical sin2φ − 2θ measurement, the tilt angle φ was calculated using cosφ = cosψcos(ω − θ), where ψ is the tilt angle, θ is 7.02° for (001) peaks and ω is around 0.5°.41 By varying the tilt angle ψ from 0° to 45°, the intensity and position of the (001) peaks of perovskites around 14.04° were traced (Fig. 3a–c), and the different stress states in films are shown in Fig. 3d.42,43 The control film had a negative slope in the sin2φ − 2θ plot, implying the enlarged distance of its (001) crystal planes and the existence of residual tensile stress. However, the PVK–VT film had an increased yet negative slope compared to the control film, suggesting the partial release of residual tensile stress. Surprisingly, the slope for PVK–PVT was positive, indicating that the tensile stress had been completely eliminated and even transferred into compressive stress after polymerization. Stress transition from tensile stress in PVK–VT to compressive stress in PVK–PVT (Fig. 3d) was dominated by the in situ polymerization of VT cations on perovskites. In addition, the residual stress was quantitatively calculated based on the relationship between Young's modulus and the slope from the sin2φ − 2θ plot. The residual stress was 0.47, 0.17, and −0.065 GPa for control, PVK–VT and PVK–PVT, respectively, illustrating that the VT polymerization completely eliminated the tensile stress of perovskite films and applied 14% compressive stress on PVK–PVT (Table S3, ESI†). The compressive stress on PVK–PVT was also evidenced by the mild decrease in band gaps (from PL emission spectra Fig. S17a, ESI†) and slight surface shrinkage (from surface morphology in Fig. S17b–d, ESI†) of perovskites.41 Stress-effected structural stability was proved by DFT calculations (Fig. 3e), which showed that the PVT–PVK film had a highest formation energy of iodide defects compared to perovskites without and with VT modification (Fig. 3f). The as-released residual tensile stress and as-formed compressive stress within perovskites increased the needed energies of defect formation and ion migration of I− ions and thus would enhance the structural stability of PVK–PVT in PSCs (containing perovskite–HTL interface) and PSMs (containing perovskite-involved multi-interfaces).

(f) Formation energy of iodide defects in perovskites with VT/PVT modification. (g and h) ToF-SIMS depth profiles of aged PSCs without or with the PVT interlayer between the perovskite and HTL, measured in negative ion mode. 
With the dual roles of external surface iodide management (binding uncoordinated Pb2+ cations and replacing with unstable I− anions by SO3CF3−) and internal stress regulation (VAn+ polymerization-induced shrinkage), the stability of the corresponding unencapsulated PSCs, aged at 60 °C for 96 h, was evaluated by ToF-SIMS (Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry; Fig. 3g, h and Fig. S18, ESI†). For aging PSC without PVT modification, it was found that I2− ions migrated from the perovskite layer into the HTL, and Au ions moved into the HTL, as evidenced by the appearance of the AuI2 sign in the HTL layer. In contrast, I− diffusion in PSC with PVT was suppressed, and the PVT interlayer even substantially cut off the migration route of C2F6S2O4N− from HTL (Li-TFSI-doped Spiro-OMeTAD) to perovskite, but not in PSC without PVT protection. Based on the above results, PVT molecules have been demonstrated to work well at the perovskite–HTL interface for small-area n–i–p PSCs with high efficiency and stability.
Robust protection of perovskite-involved multi-interfaces in PSMs under harsh conditions
The molecular anchoring and polymerization strategy using PVT endows the perovskite surface with great stability and defect passivation. This would also enable the comprehensive protection of all perovskite-involved multi-interfaces for the fabrication of high-performance n–i–p PSMs with multi-subcells, including the perovskite–HTL, perovskite–Au, perovskite–air interfaces, which is ineluctable in P1–P2–P3 scribing processes (Fig. S1, ESI†). The as-deposited gold electrodes would directly contact the exposed perovskites in the lateral direction due to the deposition of Au in the P2 channel, leading to the serious ion migration (i.e., iodide and gold ions) and performance degradation of PSMs. While some inorganic oxides (e.g., SnO2, Al2O3 and MoOx) have been developed to cut off the perovskite–Au interfaces, the costly deposition and precise thickness control might be not applied for large-scale PSMs.44–46 In addition, each P3 scribing process would expose one lateral perovskite surface to the air, resulting in the moisture-induced PbI6 framework collapse. Thus, a multi-interfacial modification strategy was utilized here by VT deposition at each perovskite-involved multi-interfaces and subsequent UV polymerization (Fig. 4a and Fig. S19, ESI†) to construct high-stability PSMs from three aspects:

(1) Powerful passivation of surface defects on perovskites and efficient enhancement of hole transport from perovskite to HTL through introducing PVT before HTL deposition to protect the perovskite–HTL interfaces, as demonstrated in the above discussion on small-scale PSCs.
(2) Effective separation between perovskite layers and gold electrodes through introducing PVT after P2 laser-scribing and before gold deposition to protect the HTL–Au interfaces and perovskite–Au interfaces. Note that the solution-processed modification process by dynamically coating VT/IPA solution onto the FTO/ETL/PVK–VT/HTL substrate did not destroy the underlying HTL layer (Fig. S20, ESI†), due to the insoluble property of IPA for the HTLs we used.47 To test the effect of PVT between HTL and Au, the UV exposure time was optimized and the interfacial stability was studied at 85 °C (Fig. S21a and b, ESI†). It was found that PVT from 3 min UV-polymerization greatly stabilized the HTL–Au interfaces. To intuitively observe the change in the direct contact between perovskite and Au, the FTO/PVK/Au and FTO/PVK–PVT/Au devices were fabricated and then aged at 85 °C for comparison (Fig. S21c and d, ESI†). Under the external action of a thermal driving force, the ion migration was accelerated, and the PbI2 peak (from the collapse of PbI6 octahedral frameworks) in XRD patterns appeared in the former device. However, no PbI2 was newly formed in the latter device, indicating the inhibition of α-FAPbI3 structural collapse at the modified perovskite–Au interfaces.
(3) Excellent resistance of humidity on perovskites exposed to air through introducing PVT after P3 laser-scribing to protect the perovskite–air interfaces. The contact angle measurement demonstrated the hydrophobic property of the PVK–PVT and Au surface (Fig. S22, ESI†), consistent with the excellent humidity resistance at the modified perovskite–air interfaces (Fig. S16, ESI†).
Therefore, the perovskite-involved multi-interfacial protection in terms of the above-mentioned three aspects was systematically demonstrated and should be able to boost the overall performance of PSMs. The PCE of PSMs with three PVT interlayers and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs reached 22.01% for an 18 cm2 active area and 19.90% for a 54 cm2 active area, both superior to the controls without PVT (Fig. 4b, Fig. S23 and Tables S4, S5, ESI†). The stability assessments of PSMs under harsh conditions were investigated in detail, and the physical encapsulation of PSMs by a hot-melt butyl sealant was carried out. Note that the strict stability measurements for mature photovoltaic technologies according to the standard IEC61215:2016 were carried out, and the unstable spiro-OMeTAD was replaced by nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc).48 Inspiringly, the NiPc-module with three PVT interlayers retained 97.02% of its initial PCE under 85 °C, 85% RH aging conditions after 1000 h (91.06% for 2000 h), while the NiPc-module without PVT rapidly dropped to 70.03% of its initial PCE after 1000 h (52.53% for 2000 h; Fig. 4c). The PSM performance before and after 85 °C, 85% RH aging measurements are shown in Fig. S24 and Table S6 (ESI†). Additionally, the NiPc-module with PVT displayed a continuous and stable power output under one sun and retained 90.57% of its initial power at 85 °C and 60% RH for 300 h (Fig. 4d), better than that without PVT, which rapidly dropped to 57.27% of its initial power after 42 h. The related devices for aging measurements are shown in Fig. S25 (ESI†). At present, such high-stability performances in multi-subcell PVT-assisted PSMs, as good as that of silicon-based solar cells, have hardly been reported (Table S7, ESI†), and the significantly improved lifetime of PVT-assisted PSMs under heat, humidity, and illumination can be attributed to the reinforcement of PbI6 octahedral frameworks and effective protection at three perovskite-involved interfaces. The superior efficiency and stability of PSMs confirm the practicability and reliability of the PVT multi-interfacial modification strategy, showing great potential in the practical application under working conditions.
Proof-of-concept demonstration of an outdoor automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system
As shown in Fig. 5a, a home-made all-in-one system, including one PVT-protected PSM, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, data collection component and signal transmission unit, was built as a realizable proof-of-concept device for electricity generation, energy storage and power monitoring outdoors. A commercial polysilicon solar cell and a light intensity detector unit were also integrated into the above device to provide output power for comparison and monitor real-time solar intensity, respectively. The working principle is as follows: the PSM works under the sun and charges the portable battery in real-time, the collection component of data records the current–voltage signals, and the signal transmission unit uploads the signals to a cloud platform. Finally, the signals can be downloaded from the cloud platform and observed by mobile terminals at any time. Meanwhile, both the output current–voltage of the silicon solar cell and the light intensity of the sun are recorded to reflect the change in natural light in real time. It was found that the everyday power of the PSM was in linear correlation with the power of silicon solar cell (Fig. 5b and Fig. S26, ESI†), and was repeatable during the day-night cycles, regardless of the weather. Note that the surface temperature of the PSM was as high as 55.9 °C on our homemade device (Fig. S27, ESI†). This simple proof of concept exemplifies the promising integration capability of PVT-protected PSMs with various functional devices for outdoor automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage applications and even other multidisciplinary applications. Such outdoor all-weather PSMs stability measurements should inspire the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics.

Conclusions
To clean up the stability obstacle for commercializing PSMs, a structure-stabilization strategy, holistically reinforcing PbI6 octahedral frameworks of bulk-phase perovskites and their surfaces/interfaces, has been developed. This is mainly due to the synergism of SO3CF3− anions and polymerized VAn+ cations. It is revealed that the SO3CF3− anions strongly interact with Pb2+, enabling the achievement of defect-minimizing perovskite layers by surface iodide management. In combination with SO3CF3− anions, the in situ polymerization of VAn+ cations can substantially regulate bulk stress and inhibit ion migration. The PVT modification can be used to secure the perovskite-involved multi-interfaces (i.e., perovskite–HTL, perovskite–Au, and perovskite–air) in n–i–p PSMs. The final PSMs have exhibited significant improvement in both PCE and stability under harsh conditions including storage at 85 °C and 85% RH and working under one-sun simulation at 85 °C. A real automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system has been built and shown repeatable output outdoors. This study provides a rational paradigm for building stable and practical power systems based on perovskite photovoltaics.

Broader context
For the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics, there are still some critical problems need to be comprehensively considered, referring to defect passivation, structural stabilization and charge transfer enhancement. Particularly, for multi-interfacial perovskite solar modules (PSMs), the chemical regulation of PbI6 octahedral frameworks can endow PSMs with both high efficiency and stability, comparable to commercialized silicon solar cells. Herein, we report that a multifunctional molecular modifier, UV-polymerized vinylaniline trifluoromethanesulfonate (VT), acts as interlayers within PSMs (including perovskite–HTL, perovskite–Au and perovskite–air interfaces). VT molecules with SO3CF3− anions and vinylaniline cations with alkene groups are adapted to protect perovskite-involved surfaces, and two main aspects are proposed: (1) strong Pb–O coordination between SO3CF3− and perovskite replaces unstable I− ions of surface PbI6 octahedra to enhance charge transfer and structural stability; (2) UV-induced polymerization in alkene groups compresses bulk-phase PbI6 octahedra to inhibit ion migration. The VT molecules are applicable to perovskite-involved interfaces, and thus the as-protected PSMs have demonstrated high efficiency and stability comparable to that of commercialized silicon solar cells. Notably, a proof-of-concept automatic light-seeking photovoltaics-to-energy-storage system has been built and our PSMs on it have shown repeatable and practical output outdoors. This study has greatly increased public confidence in PSM commercialization.
