    , Accepted 1st July 2013First published on 4th July 2013AbstractHerein, we report three conjugated polymers with main-chain donors and pendent π-acceptors as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The polymer PPTZF (which contains a phenothiazine (PTZ) chromophore and has a 9,9-dioctyl-fluorene (F) group as the donor unit in the main chain and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in the side chain, linked by a thiophene unit) was used as a basic structure. Then 9,9-dioctyl-carbazole (CZ) and triphenylamine (TPA) were selected to replace F and PTZ, respectively, as structural modifications to get another two polymers: PPTZCZ and PTPACZ. Finally, we fabricated devices and examined the effects of different donors with flexible alkyl chains on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Our studies have revealed that the PTPACZ dye, which has a degree of polymerization (DP) of ∼4, exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance with a relatively high power conversion efficiency of 4.4% under standard (Global Air Mass 1.5) illumination. Charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements have demonstrated that the charge recombination lifetime (τ) is a crucial influencing factor on the open-circuit voltage of these polymer dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years as a promising alternative to traditional photovoltaic devices based on inorganic semiconductor technology.1–4 Among all the components, the dye plays a crucial role in improving the conversion efficiency.5 DSSCs based on metal complex sensitizers have shown very outstanding solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies.6,7 However, they are not attractive in terms of cost and environmental issues, so great efforts have been dedicated to the development of metal-free organic dyes.8–11 Conducting polymers are remarkable in that they combine the electrical and optical properties of metals and inorganic semiconductors with the mechanical properties and processing advantages of organic polymers.12–15 The advantages of tunable energy levels, large absorption coefficients and excellent structural stability owing to thermal and solvent resistance make conjugated polymers possible candidates as sensitizers in DSSCs.16,17
It is critical to get valid absorption and electron injection as well as transference by designing suitable polymer structures.11,18–20 In 2011, Kirk S. Schanze et al. introduced a terthiophene segment as the donor in the backbone and achieved a power conversion efficiency of ∼3%. Another important outcome of their work is the demonstration that the performance of the polymers in the DSSCs varies with the degree of polymerization (DP). In particular, a higher incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and power conversion efficiency are obtained for the polymer with the lowest DP.21 Inspired by the design of small organic dye molecules with donor–π (bridge)–acceptor (D–π–A) structures, Bin Liu et al. synthesized a conjugated polymer dye containing an electron donating backbone (triphenylamine) and an electron accepting side chain (cyanoacetic acid) with conjugated thiophene units as the linkers, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 3.39%.22 In 2011, Jong-Beom Baek et al. synthesized RCP-1, which comprises an electron-donating backbone (carbazole) and an electron-accepting side chain (cyanoacetic acid) connected through conjugated vinylene and terthiophene, and tested it as a photosensitizer. The well-defined donor (D)–acceptor (A) structure of RCP-1 has made it possible, for the first time, to reach a power conversion efficiency of over 4% in DSSCs with an organic polymer sensitizer.23
Based on the research mentioned above, combining the outstanding properties of electron-rich donor and pendent acceptor conjugated polymers may lead to the development of a series of promising dyes for high-performance polymer DSSCs. Herein, we report the synthesis of polymer PPTZF (which contains a phenothiazine (PTZ) chromophore and has a 9,9-dioctyl-fluorene (F) group as the donor unit in the main chain and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in the side chain, linked by a thiophene unit) was used as a basic structure. Then 9,9-dioctyl-carbazole (CZ) and triphenylamine (TPA) were selected to replace F and PTZ, respectively, as structural modifications to get another two polymers: PPTZCZ and PTPACZ (Fig. 1). Finally, we fabricated devices and examined the effects of different donors with flexible alkyl chains on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
The result shows that the PTPACZ dye, which has a DP of ∼4, exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance with a relatively high power conversion efficiency of 4.4% for DSSCs under standard (Global Air Mass 1.5) illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest overall efficiency achieved in polymer DSSCs. Our study suggested that the structure–property relationship in polymers with strong electron-donating main chains and good conjugated side chain units, as well as electron-withdrawing groups, was similar to the small organic dye molecules of D–π–A type. Therefore, the design strategy of small organic dyes could be applied in designing polymer dyes.
Experimental section
Materials
Acetonitrile (AN) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled before use. Phenoxazine was purchased from Inno-Chem Science Technology Co., Ltd. N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, copper powder, 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid, 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene and 1-bromo-iso-octane were purchased from Energy Chemical. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
UV-vis, photoluminescence and voltammetric measurements
Electronic absorption spectra were measured on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. Emission spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer. The emitted light was detected with a Hamamatsu R928 red-sensitive photomultiplier. A computer-controlled CHI660C electrochemical workstation was used for square-wave voltammetric measurements with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. All potentials were reported against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reference.
Cell fabrication
A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected TiO2 particles was used as the mesoporous negative electrode. A 7 μm thick transparent layer of 25 nm-sized titania particles was first printed onto a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass electrode and further coated with a 5 μm thick scattering layer of 350–450 nm-sized titania particles. The film thickness was measured using a benchtop Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. The cycloidal TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a 150 μmol mL−1 dye solution, in a mixed solvent of THF and AN (v/v, 1:1) for 10 h. After being washed with AN and dried by air flow, the sensitized titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO electrode. The electrodes were separated by a 35 μm thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum backfilling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode glass substrate, made with a sand-blasting drill, was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. The infiltrated electrolyte is composed of 1.0 M DMII, 0.02 M iodine (I2), 1 M TBP, 0.1 M GNCS and 0.05 M LiI in AN.
Photovoltaic measurements
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ 300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used for the measurement of photocurrent action spectra, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s, under full computer control. The Hamamatsu S1337 1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated in the National Institute of Metrology, China. During the photocurrent action spectra measurements, a white light-emitting diode was used to bias a testing cell with ∼1.0 mA cm2 of background current. A model LS1000 4S-AM1.5G-1000-W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA 2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. J–V characteristics were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2602 source meter under full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 covered the testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities measured under this solar simulator are well consistent with the integral of the IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTMG173-03), within 5% errors.
Transient photovoltage decay and charge extraction measurements
Transient photoelectrical experiments were measured with an Autolab-PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation. The steady and perturbing lights on the photoanode side of a testing cell were supplied with white and red light-emitting diodes, respectively. We used the red light to generate a photovoltage perturbation near the open-circuit photovoltage of a testing cell under a certain white light and measured the voltage decay process thereafter. The change in photovoltage caused by the red pulse of a testing cell was below 5 mV. Normally, the transient signal follows a monoexponential decay, thus the electron lifetime can be obtained by fitting an exponential function to the photovoltage decay. The electron density was estimated by the charge extraction method. A testing cell was first kept at open-circuit under white light and subsequently, the white light was turned off upon switching the cell from open-circuit to short-circuit to record the resulting current transient, and the electron density was obtained by current integration.
Measurements of molecular weight and thermal stability
The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (WATERS 2414) with three columns in a series, from 1000–1000000, with polystyrene (PS) as a standard sample. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under N2 atmosphere using a PerkinElmer TGA7.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The general synthetic routes to prepare PPTZF, PPTZCZ and PTPACZ are shown in Scheme 1, and detailed synthesis and characterization data are provided below. The precursor polymers 9–11 with aldehyde groups were synthesized via Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. The cross-coupling of borates with alkyl-substituted-carbazole or fluorene, and dibromide triphenylamine or phenothiazine with thiophene carbaldehyde was catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 in toluene for 48 h under alkaline conditions. Following the polymerization reaction, the polymer dyes were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation reactions between the aldehyde groups of the precursor polymers and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine. All of the monomers were synthesized according to the traditional methods: bromination, high temperature solid-state Ullmann and Suzuki coupling.

Absorption spectra and electrochemical properties
The light-harvesting capacities of the polymers at the molecular level were first compared by recording the UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 2) of PPTZF, PPTZCZ and PTPACZ in THF, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. One can see from Scheme 1 that PPTZF is a basic structure, and two different kinds of structural modification to the backbone of PPTZF have been selected to examine their effect on the performance of the polymer. As shown in Fig. 2, PPTZF has two distinct absorption peaks at 330 and 372 nm, neither of which are shifted upon replacing the 9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene (F) of PPTZF with 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-carbazole (CZ) to form PPTZCZ. But the corresponding absorption coefficients are enhanced from 24.0, 19.3 to 42.0, 44.2 × 103 (mg mL−1)−1 cm−1, respectively. The PPTZCZ has a maximum absorption wavelength (λabsmax) of 370 nm, which is red-shifted to 372 nm upon replacing the phenothiazin (PTZ) of PPTZCZ with triphenylamine (TPA) to form PTPACZ, and the absorption coefficient is distinctly increased from 42.0 to 75.2 × 103 (mg mL−1)−1 cm−1. Moreover, the PTPACZ has another distinct absorption peak (23.5 × 103 (mg mL−1)−1 cm−1, 455 nm) in the visible region.

To fabricate an efficient DSSC, the energy-offsets of dye molecules with respect to the titania nanocrystals and redox electrolytes is very important. The E0–0 (zero–zero transition energies) were estimated from the intersection points of the normalized absorption and emission spectra (Fig. 3) of 200 μg mL−1 dye solution (THF), and were 2.38 eV, 2.77 eV and 2.76 eV for PTPACZ, PPTZCZ and PPTZF, respectively. Then we measured the ground-state redox potential (ED/D+) of these three dyes in THF, which can be accurately derived by averaging the anodic and cathodic peak potentials of square-wave voltammograms (Fig. 4). Then the excited-state redox potential (ED*/D+) can be calculated using the equation ED*/D+ = ED/D+ − E0–0/e without considering any entropy change during light excitation.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs

Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent action spectra of DSSCs which were made from 7 + 5 μm thick bilayer titania films coated with PPTZF, PPTZCZ and PTPACZ in THF–AN (v/v, 1:1). The onsets of the IPCE spectra increase in the order PPTZF < PPTZCZ < PTPACZ. In particular, the PTPACZ cell has a much broader and higher IPCE peak, which is in good agreement with the absorption spectra of these dyes. As presented in Fig. 6A, we recorded the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated AM1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and collected the detailed photovoltaic parameters in Table 2. The PPTZF and PPTZCZ cells display power conversion efficiencies (η) of 3.0 and 3.5% respectively. The small efficiency improvement is mainly related to the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) increasing from 742 mV and 5.30 mA cm−2 to 775 mV and 6.06 mA cm−2, respectively, because of the better light-harvesting capacity of PPTZCZ than PPTZF due to replacement of the F unit with CZ.

a The validity of our photovoltaic data is confirmed by comparing the calculated Jscvia wavelength integration of the product of the standard AM1.5 emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03) and measured IPCE spectra with the experimental Jsc, showing less than 5% error. Also note that all the cells show a linear dependence of photocurrent on light intensity.

Furthermore, the PTPACZ cell yielded an efficiency of 4.4% with a Jsc of 8.12 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 769 mV, because TPA has much better donor-capability than PTZ. This is in good agreement with the absorption and IPCE spectra of these dyes. Assuming Jsc is proportional to photocarrier generation flux, we further measured the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these three cells at various light intensities and plotted Voc as a function of Jsc in Fig. 6B. At a given Jsc, the photovoltages increase in the order PPTZF < PTPACZ < PPTZCZ. For a certain redox electrolyte in DSSCs, it is well recognized that a rise or fall of Voc stems from a shift of electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) in titania, which could be related to a variance in the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and/or a fluctuation of electron density.24,25 At a given photocarrier generation flux, the electron density is controlled by the interfacial recombination of titania electrons with electron accepting species in an electrolyte and/or dye cations. Thus, we further performed charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay measurements to understand the alterative order of Voc.
As depicted in Fig. 7A, at the same Voc or potential bias the PTPACZ and PPTZCZ cells have similar extracted electron densities (de), but the PPTZF cell is not the same. With respect to the PTPACZ and PPTZCZ cells, there is an ∼15 mV upward shift in the PPTZF cell of the titania conduction-band edge against the electrolyte Fermi-level. However, the relatively higher conduction-band edge of the PPTZF cell does not lead to an improved Voc, owing to a shortened charge recombination lifetime (τ) at a given de as presented in Fig. 7B. At the same extracted electron density (de) the charge recombination lifetime (τ) of these three dyes increase in the order of PPTZF < PTPACZ < PPTZCZ. This is in good agreement with the alterative order of Voc. Thereby, the charge recombination lifetime (τ) is a crucial influential factor on the Voc of these polymer dyes.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of PPTZF, PPTZCZ and PTPACZ were determined by TGA under nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 8, these three polymer dyes exhibited good thermal stability, with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 250 °C, 239 °C and 244 °C, respectively. This is desirable for the application of polymer dyes in DSSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized three conjugated polymers (PPTZF, PPTZCZ and PTPACZ) which have number average molecular weights of 2300–3000 (DP ∼4), and investigated the influence of different donor units in the backbone on the polymer molecule's energy level and photovoltaic characteristics. Then, we developed a PTPACZ cell, which has TPA and CZ as the backbone, that displays a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%. Up to now, it's the highest efficiency achieved in DSSCs with polymer dyes applied as the sensitizer. Our work demonstrated that the engineering of small organic molecules are also suitable for polymer dye design.
