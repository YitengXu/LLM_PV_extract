    , Accepted 5th May 2013First published on 7th May 2013AbstractA gold nanoparticle-coated and surface-textured TiO2 inverse opal (Au/st-TIO) structure that provides a dramatic improvement of photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation has been fabricated by nano-patterning of TiO2 precursors on TiO2 inverse opal (TIO) and subsequent deposition of gold NPs. The surface-textured TiO2 inverse opal (st-TIO) maximizes the photon trapping effects triggered by the large dimensions of the structure while maintaining the adequate surface area achieved by the small dimensions of the structure. Au NPs are incorporated to further improve photoconversion efficiency in the visible region via surface plasmon resonance. st-TIO and Au/st-TIO exhibit a maximum photocurrent density of ∼0.58 mA cm−2 and ∼0.8 mA cm−2, which is 2.07 and 2.86 times higher than that of bare TIO, respectively, at an applied bias of +0.5 V versus an Ag/AgCl electrode under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination via a photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction. The excellent performance of the surface plasmon-enhanced mesoporous st-TIO structure suggests that tailoring the nanostructure to proper dimensions, and thereby obtaining excellent light absorption, can maximize the efficiency of a variety of photoconversion devices.
Introduction
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by a water splitting process is an attractive approach to achieve clean and renewable energy systems. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a chemical process of electrolysis of water by sunlight generating hydrogen.1 The PEC cells are typically designed with metal oxide semiconductors that operate at particular wavelengths of light/energies as photoelectrodes and noble metals as counter electrodes.2 Among the metal oxide semiconductors being intensively investigated (e.g., TiO2,3,4 ZnO,5,6 Fe2O3,7,8 WO3,9,10 and Cu2O11,12), TiO2 is very promising since it has a flat band potential, fast electron pathways, photo-chemical stability, and good corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions.13 However, TiO2 has a large bandgap, which results in a limited photoresponse and overall low efficiency in the visible region. A strategy for bandgap engineering of TiO2, such as fabrication of an array of nanowires14,15 or nanotubes,16–18 doping of heteroatoms,17–19 and coating of quantum dots,20–23 is thus necessary for efficient hydrogen generation. Metal–semiconductor contacts have shown a great interfacial charge transfer mechanism such as hot electron injection and plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET).24–26 For example, a metallic nanostructure can enhance optical absorption in the range of visible light through excitation of the surface plasmons, resulting in excitation of electrons in the semiconductor at energies well below the semiconductor's bandgap; this in turn allows for a predominance of electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor. Light absorption is an important issue for active materials in these systems because utilization of maximal absorption of light is strongly correlated with conversion efficiency of photons to electrons.27 It has been reported that metal NPs can exhibit outstanding absorption via scattering when the size is comparable to or larger than the wavelength of light.28–31 However, with an increased size of the metal, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR),32,33 which is expected to be achievable by metal NPs and is mainly supported by a dipolar plasmon mode in small size particles, disappears, resulting in inefficient excitation of electrons.
Alternatively, on the basis of its relatively large dimensions, an inverse opal (IO) structure can be suggested as a photon trapping structure that can readily interact with light in the UV-visible region.34,35 A photon trapping effect is a phenomenon in which the effective optical path length is increased by several times, triggered by an interaction between an object and light, i.e., scattering. TiO2 inverse opal structures (TIO) have been studied as photocatalysts3,36,37 and electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)38–40 during the past decade. However, a rather low surface area relative to P-25 (Degussa), a standard active material for photoconversion systems has hampered the broad use of TIO in those areas. Therefore, systematically balancing two opposing factors, surface area and light trapping effects, is crucial to maximizing the power conversion efficiency in TIO-based systems; the pore size should be decreased to less than about 30 nm to increase the surface area for maximal contact of dye molecules onto the surface of the active materials.41–44 On the other hand, large scale structures over a few hundred nanometers are needed in order to obtain an efficient light trapping effect caused by the interaction between objects with proper dimensions and incident light.45–47 In this regard, a hierarchical structure is advantageous in that it can facilitate these two important properties simultaneously by accommodating two different dimensions in the structure.7
Here, we report an optimized gold NP-coated and surface-textured TIO (Au/st-TIO) structure in the form of larger scale TIO coated with smaller scale nanostructures and Au NPs. This structure can potentially broaden the range of photoconversion below the band gap of TiO2 by enhancing the light harvesting effect and surface plasmon-enhanced electron transfer. The surface-textured TIO (st-TIO) is created by the selective removal of one domain in the layer of TiO2-containing block copolymer precursors coated on the surface of TIO during the sintering process. By careful control of the large scale dimensions and introduction of small scale textures, we can successfully optimize the light trapping effect while securing sufficient surface area for reaction sites. Furthermore, the visible working capability in hydrogen generation of the Au/st-TIO structure is realized by the synergistic effect of photon trapping and a plasmon-enhanced transfer mechanism observed in the metal–semiconductor contact. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the properly designed Au/st-TIO structure provides strong potential for engineering of light in hydrogen generation systems.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the four steps of the fabrication process for the Au/st-TIO structure. First, surface-activated polystyrene (PS) beads obtained by treatment with Triton X-100 were self-assembled using a spin-coating method into polycrystalline opals with a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure (I) on a FTO substrate with a thickness of 2.4 μm.48 A TiCl4 aqueous solution was then infiltrated into the 3D assembly of PS followed by annealing in air, which induced the gelation of the TiO2 sol and calcination of PS simultaneously, thus forming the TIO structure (III). After the third step, mesoporous structures composed of ∼7 nm of TiO2 textures are created by hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 precursors and a thin layer of triblock copolymer solution and the second sintering of the sample. The targeted structure is st-TIO (IV) of a few hundred nanometer scale textured with mesoporous TiO2 less than tens of nanometers in diameter. Finally, gold nanoparticles of approximately 30 nm in diameter are deposited onto st-TIO via a hydrothermal method (V).49

Fig. 2 presents scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the structure according to each step of the fabrication process (as described in the Experimental section) of a visible light working electrode for surface plasmon-enhanced hydrogen generation, corresponding to the pristine PS assembly, TIO, st-TIO, and Au/st-TIO. Fig. 2a is a SEM image of a 3D assembly of PS with a diameter of 350 nm and a thickness of about 2.4 μm. The nearly face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal of the compact opal structure was found, as reported elsewhere.48Fig. 2b is a SEM image of a 3D network of TiO2 obtained by the gelation of TiCl4 followed by the removal of the 3D assembly of PS by sintering at 500 °C. Low-density TIO showing an underlying FCC lattice is apparent from the SEM image. The dimensions of the TIO generated from the removal of the PS template were reduced to approximately 83% of the original thickness due to shrinkage induced by the sol–gel reaction. We varied the diameters of the PS spheres and sintering conditions in order to optimize light harvesting capability. Fig. 2c is a SEM image of st-TIO that clearly shows the creation of small scale textures. The inset shows a close-up image of the st-TIO with a larger diameter of air holes of 290 nm and a beam diameter of ∼40 nm coated with TiO2 textures with a smaller diameter of ∼7 nm. The small size textures are attributable to the selective removal of PPO domains formed by the assembly of the PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer. Fig. 2d shows the ∼30 nm Au NPs deposited on st-TIO with a dimension of 290 nm (fabricated from 350 nm PS nanospheres). The inset confirms the presence of two types of smaller scale nanostructures (TiO2 textures and Au NPs). The brighter spots represent Au NPs, due to the larger reflection/scattering cross-section of Au during the process of imaging in SEM.

Fig. 3a shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-prepared st-TIO which confirms that TiO2 is crystalline with an interplanar d-spacing of 0.31 nm corresponding to the (101) plane. It is seen that st-TIO is a mesoporous structure with a diameter of about 7 nm and tightly connected with a thick layer of TIO in a beam diameter of ∼40 nm. There was a tendency in the experiment for TiO2 textures to aggregate and form mesoporous clusters with a diameter of ∼20 nm as marked in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b is a TEM image of the surface of the Au/st-TIO showing the presence of two types of nanoscale structures. The two different degrees of interplanar spacing, 0.31 and 0.22 nm in Fig. 3a and b, indicate the textures of anatase TiO2 and the Au NPs, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were made to further confirm the formation of TiO2 after the sol–gel reaction and application of the hydrothermal method. Fig. 3c shows the XRD pattern of the sol–gel fabricated TiO2 nanostructures (TIO), st-TIO created from hydrothermal treatment of the block copolymer on the surface of TIO, and Au/st-TIO fabricated by hydrothermal deposition of Au NPs on st-TIO. X-ray diffraction analysis verifies that the as-synthesized st-TIOs are in an anatase phase with enhancement at 25° and 38° corresponding to the (101) and (004) planes, as confirmed by # JCPDS 84-1286. These peaks confirm that TiCl4 is completely converted to crystalline anatase TiO2, which indicates the presence of feasible conducting pathways in TIO networks. The XRD peaks of Au/st-TIO with enhancement at 38°, 44°, 65° and 77°, corresponding to the planes of (111), (200), (220) and (311), confirm the crystalline nature of the Au. Furthermore, the TiO2 textures maintain spacing and a 2 theta value in the Au/st-TIO as shown in the TEM images and XRD data, respectively, indicating the stability of the TiO2 nanostructure in the basic condition that is applied for the deposition of Au NPs or the photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction (see the Experimental section).

The interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm represents the Au NPs. (c) XRD data of TIO and st-TIO, and Au/st-TIO from bottom to top. The numbers in brackets in black and in pink represent the lattice planes of anatase TiO2 and gold NPs, respectively. 
The enhanced optical properties due to the introduction of properly designed dimensions and Au NPs can be quantified by shining light on the front side of a P-25 control sample, TIO samples, st-TIO samples, and Au/st-TIO samples (from the top to the FTO substrate). Fig. 4a compares the UV-vis extinction spectra of a 2 μm thick NC–TiO2 film (P-25), and similar thicknesses of TIO structures fabricated from PS with diameters of 130 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm at normal incidence. All UV-vis absorption spectra are normalized by the thickness of the corresponding samples. P-25 was chosen as a control sample since it has shown excellent performance as a working electrode in photovoltaic devices. The absorption peaks spanning from 300 to 400 nm were assigned to the absorption of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticles. Unlike the previously reported results on the photon trapping effects based on the slow photon propagation mechanism of photonic crystal structures at the bandgap edge,3,36 the TIO samples assembled by simple spin-coating methods did not show specific reflectance peaks due to the polycrystalline nature of the opal structure with some defects. However, the TIO samples without the perfect photonic bandgaps, thus no slow photons at normal incidence, still demonstrated a strong and broad absorption band ranging from 400 to 800 nm due to scattering, relative to the P-25 control sample, even though the density of TiO2 in the TIO samples with larger scale air holes (300 nm) is much lower than that of P-25, which is densely packed with much smaller (25 nm in diameter) scale TiO2 particles. The enhanced absorption of the TIO samples in this region is attributed to the photon trapping effect obtained by the larger dimensions of TIO, which can readily interact with light in the visible region. This implies that much more light is able to participate in the light harvesting process in the TIO structure with a trapping zone: some photons that are not absorbed upon their first passage are scattered by the TIO frame again, effectively giving those photon multi-passes through the networks. However, compared to the large absorption cross-section of the TIO structure at a long wavelength, the absorption in the UV range of TIO is still less than that of the P-25 control sample, which is likely due to the low areal density of the TIO samples. We hypothesized that the addition of smaller dimensions to TIO by surface-texturing could successfully address this problem. In fact, the surface area of TIO (350 nm in diameter) obtained by BET is increased by surface-texturing from 33.9 m2 g−1 to 124.9 m2 g−1, exceeding the value (117 m2 g−1) of P-25, as shown in Fig. S2.† As a result, the cross-sectional area of UV-vis absorption is substantially improved after surface-texturing of the corresponding plain TIO in the entire wavelength region for all the cases as shown in Fig. 4b. This implies that the low density of TIO could be overcome by the adoption of a mesoporous hierarchical structure. The optimal structure with the maximum cross-section area achieved by integration of small dimensions in the UV-absorption curve is st-TIO with a diameter of 350 nm, as shown in Table 1 (ESI†). The intensity of the photon trapping effect caused by scattered light under beam irradiation on the device was further investigated by comparing the diffuse reflection spectra of a P-25 control film and st-TIO with different dimensions. As can be seen in Fig. 4c, compared to the P-25 control film, the st-TIO structures showed significantly higher diffuse reflection spectra in the visible spectrum of light (400–800 nm), indicating that the absorbed light was efficiently scattered within the nanostructure film. This result confirms extension of the path length of the light within the TIO with a few hundred nanometers scale. Here, our approach is different from other methods that pursue hierarchical TIO37 in that we maximize the surface area by surface-texturing of TIO without filling air holes with small dimension structures. This makes it possible to maintain a refractive index contrast between the large scale TIO frame and air, which is essential for the photon trapping effect.50,51 As a result, st-TIO with a diameter of 350 nm and 600 nm had a much larger photon trapping effect than P-25 and the light scattering factor of st-TIO was significant in the entire wavelength region. On the other hand, there was only a slight light scattering effect for the TIO made from 130 nm PS nanospheres, which was likely due to inefficient interaction between the relatively smaller dimension nanostructures and exposed light. We observed that the light scattering effect increased with an increase in the pore size in the range of the wavelength-scale of exposed light. The optimized dimension of the st-TIO frame is 350 nm, which allows excellent photon-trapping effects while retaining appropriate surface area, according to the data in Table 1.†Fig. 4d compares the final UV-vis absorption spectra of st-TIO and Au/st-TIO, demonstrating the potential for surface plasmon resonance in the metal–semiconductor interfaces. A broad absorption covering a range of 500–700 nm with an absorption maximum at about 540 nm appeared in the spectra of all Au/st-TIO samples, and is attributed to enhanced surface plasmons in Au NPs.

In order to investigate the hydrogen generation activity of the samples, photo-electrochemical measurements were carried out directly on P-25 control samples, TIO, st-TIO, and Au/st-TIO. Ag/AgCl, a Pt mesh, and as-prepared samples are used as a reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode, respectively, in a 0.24 M Na2S/0.35 M Na2SO3 electrolyte solution. As shown in Fig. 5a illustrating the electron transfer mechanism of Au/st-TIO, after the electrons are transferred from gold nanoparticles to the conduction band of TiO2 upon illumination, the electrons travel to the counter electrode where the hydrogen generation reaction is driven. Meanwhile, the holes diffused to the surface of TiO2 or Au oxidize S2− and SO32−.52,53 In detail, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation proceeds by the following three steps: (a) incident photons are absorbed by the Au NPs, which creates electrons; (b) the electrons are transferred from Au NPs to the conduction band of TiO2; (c) the electrons transferred from TiO2 to the counter electrode reduce the hydrogen ions, whereas the holes induce the oxidation reaction at the surface of the working electrode. Fig. 5b presents linear-sweep voltammograms of P-25 and st-TIOs, which can be explained by the direct photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band of TiO2, under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination. All st-TIO samples show higher photocurrent density than the P-25 control sample, which is likely due to having an adequate surface area and additional photon trapping effects. This suggests that the larger dimensions in st-TIO trigger favorable photon trapping effects and help to transfer collected electrons more efficiently through the 3D connectivity of TIO. The photocurrent density of the st-TIO with a diameter of 350 nm, an optimized one as proved in Fig. 4 and Table 1,† is approximately 2 times greater than that of the P-25 control sample at an applied bias of +0.5 V. Furthermore, when the system is supported by surface plasmon resonance, the photocurrent density reaches ∼0.8 mA cm−2, which is about three times higher than that obtained with bare TIO under illumination of 80 mW cm−2 (see Fig. S6†). More surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent density of Au/st-TIO created by only visible light illumination (in red, AM 1.5 with a cutoff filter (>420 nm)) is almost 1/5 and 1/8 of that of the Au/P-25 sample and the same sample, illuminated by UV-visible light, respectively, indicating that the optimized structure has solely visible light working capability. Overall, the power conversion efficiency of Au/st-TIO under the UV-visible illumination (∼2.58 times larger than that of P-25) is enhanced by a factor of 2.07 and 2.86 by the adoption of surface texturing and surface-plasmon mechanism, respectively, as shown in Fig. S6,† which can be supported by the IPCE data in Fig. S7.†Fig. 5d shows the photoresponse over time (I–t curve) of the Au/st-TIO measured at +0.5 V with chopped illumination of AM 1.5 at a rate of 10 s exposure followed by 10 s non-illumination. The sharp spike in the photocurrent during the on/off illumination cycles indicates suitably fast two step transport of photogenerated electrons from Au NPs to the current collector via the textures of TiO2 and the interior of the TiO2 networks.

(d) I–t curve of Au/st-TIO structures with a diameter of 350 nm at a bias of +0.5 V under UV-visible illumination. The photocurrents of all samples are normalized by their thicknesses. 
In conclusion, we report a finely designed st-TIO structure that efficiently balances light trapping effects and surface area requirements by the introduction of a surface-textured coating onto a TIO structure with dimensions of a few hundred nanometer scale. The observed optical properties confirm large light harvesting effects in the TIO in the long wavelength region, which facilitate the hydrogen generation reaction of a TiO2 semiconductor in the UV-vis range. st-TIO was further optimized as a visible light working hydrogen generation electrode by the introduction of Au NPs, which facilitate surface plasmon-enhanced hydrogen generation. The photocurrent of Au/st-TIO was 2.58 times greater than that of the conventional P-25 photoelectrode, which is recognized for outstanding performance. The excellent performance of Au/st-TIO suggests that this strategy can provide a new route to design photoactive materials via systematic engineering of light.
Experimental procedures
Fabrication of TIO
PS nanospheres with different diameters (d = 130 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm) were synthesized via Colvin's method.48 Mono-dispersed PS nanospheres were assembled onto a TiO2 thin layer coated FTO, which ensures good contact between the final TIO structure and the substrate. An O2 plasma treated FTO substrate was dip-coated with 40 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 minutes. Scotch tape was applied to make a window with an area of 5 mm × 5 mm for the assembly of PS spheres. PS spheres were assembled by spin coating.54 The height of the assembled PS layers was determined by the number of spin coating. Then, the samples were annealed at 85 °C for 1 hour on a hot plate so that assembled-PS nanospheres adhere well to the substrate. 1 μl of 0.9 M of TiCl4 solution (water–ethanol = 1:1) was infiltrated into the self-assembled PS opal structures. The TiCl4–PS composite was preheated at 85 °C for 10 min and then further heated at 500 °C for 1 hour, providing a solution–gelation reaction and calcinations of PS nanospheres. A TiCl4 aqueous solution was treated once again to make efficient electron transport networks.55,56 In the present case, conducting sol–gel chemistry within the PS template resulted in a decrease in diameter of 17% for the formation of TIO networks. Furthermore, the creation of cracks is inevitable in the fabrication process of the TIO structure, as reported in previous studies.30,39,40,57,58
Fabrication of st-TIO and Au NP coated st-TIO
The TIO networks were dip-coated in a diluted solution of a triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (EO20PO70EO20, M = 5800).59 The solution was aged at 55 °C for 2 hours and then heated at 90 °C for 10 hours. After the yellow liquid turned into a bright yellow forming powder, the sample was removed from the vial. Finally samples were washed with deionized water and ethanol followed by the heat treatment at 500 °C for 1 hour to calcine the block copolymer domains. For the gold NP coating on st-TIO, 30 mM of chloroauric acid was dissolved in ethanol, to which 1 wt% of sodium citrate dissolved in water was added. The pH of the prepared solution was adjusted to be 8–9 before deposition. The mixture containing the st-TIO structure was heated to 100 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool naturally. The samples were washed with D. I. water and ethanol.
PEC measurements
The PEC performance of the electrodes was evaluated in a three-cell electrode system under front-side illumination of AM 1.5 G using a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research VersaSTAT3, AMETEK). An Ag/AgCl electrode and a Pt mesh were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.24 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3. The working electrode with an exposed area of 0.25 cm2 was illuminated from the front side. The photoresponse was measured under chopped illumination from a Newport solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter, calibrated with a standard Si solar cell simulating AM 1.5 G. Photocurrent stability tests were carried out by measuring the photocurrent produced under chopped light irradiation (light/dark cycles of 10 s) at a fixed bias of +0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication process for a Au/st-TIO structure. (I) Self-assembly of PS on FTO. (II) 3D assembly of PS infiltrated by TiCl4 solutions. (III) TIO formed by the removal of PS and sol–gel reaction of TiO2 precursors. (IV) A st-TIO created by selective removal of one domain in the triblock copolymer film. (V) A Au/st-TIO obtained by hydrothermal deposition of Au NPs on st-TIO.	 

 	Fig. 2  Morphological characterization of the structures. (a) SEM image of the 3D assembly of PS. The inset shows the cross-sectional image of the 3D assembly. (b) SEM image of TIO networks created from infiltration of TiCl4 followed by gelation of the TiO2 sol and removal of the PS assembly. (c) SEM image of st-TIO networks with a diameter of 350 nm coated with small TiO2 textures with a diameter of 7 nm in the form of a hierarchical structure. The inset is a close-up image of st-TIO. (d) SEM image of Au/st-TIO. The inset shows the presence of gold NPs and the mesoporous TiO2 textures.	 

 	Fig. 3  TEM images and XRD data of st-TIO and Au/st-TIO networks. (a) TEM image of the st-TIO structure. The close-up image in the inset confirms the single crystalline phase of as-prepared st-TIO with an interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm. (b) TEM image of the Au/st-TIO structure. The interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm represents the Au NPs. (c) XRD data of TIO and st-TIO, and Au/st-TIO from bottom to top. The numbers in brackets in black and in pink represent the lattice planes of anatase TiO2 and gold NPs, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Optical properties of the P-25, TIO, st-TIO and Au/st-TIO structure made from PS spheres with different diameters. (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples with a diameter of 130 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm. (b) UV-vis absorption spectra of the TIO networks before and after surface texturing. (c) Diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples with a diameter of 130 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm. (d) UV-vis absorption spectra of Au NP coated st-TIO with a diameter of 350 nm and 600 nm.
