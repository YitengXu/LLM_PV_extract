    , Accepted 18th July 2017First published on 20th July 2017AbstractAn efficient method to synthesize well-crystallized inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = I or Br) with high yield and high reproducibility was proposed. Notably, the as-prepared CsPbI3 in the yellow orthorhombic phase (y-CsPbI3) can be easily converted to the black cubic perovskite phase CsPbI3 (b-CsPbI3) after thermal annealing. Furthermore, two-terminal photodetectors and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based on b-CsPbI3 were fabricated, exhibiting high performances.
Metal halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent optical absorption, good carrier mobility and broad chemical tunability.1–7 In particular, organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have been regarded as promising materials for optoelectronic applications, such as solar cells,8–15 light emitting diodes16–19 and photo-driven water splitting.20,21 In the past few years, the rapid growth of power conversion efficiencies in perovskite solar cells resulted in an explosion of interest in this area.8–15 Up to now, the majority of research focuses on organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites, such as methylammonium lead trihalides and formamidinium lead trihalides (MAPbX3 and FAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I or mixed halogens). However, the hybrid perovskites usually show serious instability against moisture, heat and ultraviolet (UV) light. To avoid this problem, inorganic perovskites (such as CsPbX3) have attracted rapidly increasing attention recently, owing to the comparable properties and higher stability.22–40
Until now, most of the previous reports on the synthesis of inorganic perovskites were focused on direct film deposition using solution spin-coating or vapor-phase co-evaporation.22–28 The colloidal synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanocrystals has only been developed very recently.29–40 It is necessary to develop novel synthesis approaches with a higher yield and to avoid rigorous reaction conditions, such as high vacuum, inert gas protection, etc. In particular, for the practical application in optoelectronic devices, the batch production and phase control of inorganic perovskite materials with high crystallinity are urgently required. In this report, we demonstrate a facile and scalable synthesis method to produce inorganic cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = I or Br) with high yield and reproducibility. Notably, the as-prepared CsPbI3 in the yellow orthorhombic phase (y-CsPbI3) can be easily converted to the black cubic perovskite phase CsPbI3 (b-CsPbI3) after thermal annealing above the phase-transition temperature. Furthermore, two-terminal photodetectors and all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based on b-CsPbI3 were fabricated, exhibiting high performances and long-term stability.
As shown in Fig. 1a, large-yield and high-crystallinity y-CsPbI3 with the orthorhombic phase can be prepared via a facile hydrothermal process with lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2), cesium acetate (Cs(Ac)2) and hydroiodic acid (HI) as precursors (as detailed in the Experimental methods section†). The morphology of the as-obtained y-CsPbI3 crystals obtained after the hydrothermal process was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1b, exhibiting a uniform shape of microrods with an average length of ∼50 μm and a width of 7–10 μm. The crystallinity and purity of y-CsPbI3 were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), as displayed in Fig. 1c, and all the identified XRD peaks could be indexed to the standard pattern of CsPbI3 in the yellow orthorhombic phase (JCPDS card no. 18-0376). To identify the compositions of y-CsPbI3, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed (Fig. 1d–g). The energy bands of Cs, Pb and I can be clearly identified in the survey XPS spectrum (Fig. 1d). A small peak of C 1s originating from adventitious carbon was also observed and set to 284.6 eV. The binding energies of Cs 3d3/2, Cs 3d5/2, Pb 4f5/2, Pb 4f7/2, I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2 bands were determined after calibration, as shown in Fig. 1e–g and Table S1,† confirming the chemical compositions of y-CsPbI3. Similarly, this synthetic strategy is also applicable for another cesium lead halide, CsPbBr3, by replacing the hydroiodic acid precursor with hydrobromic acid. The SEM image and the XRD pattern of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 are shown in Fig. S1a and b,† revealing its micro-polyhedral shape and crystalline structure in the monoclinic phase (JCPDS card no. 18-0364).

It is known that the crystal structure of CsPbI3 can be orthorhombic, tetragonal or cubic polymorphs of the perovskite lattices, and the cubic perovskite phase is predominant at a high-temperature state.29 The as-prepared y-CsPbI3 obtained from hydrothermal synthesis in the orthorhombic (Pnma) space group exhibits a yellow color (as shown in the inset of Fig. 1b) and a distorted perovskite structure (Fig. 2a), in which the central lead atom is surrounded octahedrally by six iodine atoms with a tilted geometry in contrast to the orthogonal geometry of the ideal perovskite structure. To investigate the phase transition behavior of CsPbI3 crystals, the y-CsPbI3 product was dissolved in DMF, spin-coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and then annealed at different temperatures. Fig. 2a shows that the color of the CsPbI3 film changes from yellow to black after annealing at 335 °C, revealing that the phase transition temperature of CsPbI3 from the yellow orthorhombic phase to the black cubic perovskite phase is around 335 °C. This phase change can also be distinguished by the change of XRD peaks at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2b shows that the XRD peak intensities of y-CsPbI3 increase as the annealing temperature increases. This indicates that the crystallinity of the sample becomes higher along with the increase in annealing temperature, as indicated by the SEM images (Fig. S2†). After annealing at 335 °C for 1–2 min, the crystal structure of the CsPbI3 sample changed to b-CsPbI3 in the cubic perovskite (Pm3m) space group, exhibiting a three-dimensional framework of corner-connected PbI6 octahedra with Cs cations located between the octahedra (Fig. 2a). The optical absorbance spectra of the annealed CsPbI3 films were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2c. All the CsPbI3 films annealed below 335 °C show similar absorbance spectra, owing to their unchanged orthorhombic phase. A closer observation reveals that the absorption edge of y-CsPbI3 annealed below 335 °C shows a blue shift along with the increase in annealing temperature, and the color changes from yellow to light yellow (Fig. S3†). This may be ascribed to the improved crystallinity and the enlarged crystal size of y-CsPbI3 after annealing, as evidenced by Fig. S2.† It should be noted that the color of y-CsPbI3 films annealed at 330 °C for more than 3 min can also be changed to black; however, it will turn back to yellow immediately when the temperature is decreased to below 330 °C. The onset absorption wavelength of the as-prepared y-CsPbI3 is around 450 nm (corresponding to 2.76 eV), which is too short to strongly absorb visible light. In contrast, the onset absorption wavelength of b-CsPbI3 after phase transition is around 715 nm (corresponding to ∼1.73 V), indicating that it is a promising material for optoelectronic devices. For the as-obtained CsPbBr3, it exhibits an onset absorption wavelength of 540 nm, as shown in Fig. S1c,† which is also smaller than that of b-CsPbI3.

To investigate the potential of inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 for optoelectronic devices, two-terminal photodetectors based on both y-CsPbI3 and b-CsPbI3 were fabricated and tested. The insets in Fig. 3a and b show the schematic configuration of the device architectures used in this study. To prevent the influence of the ambient environment, the photodetectors were encapsulated by using cover glass and a hot-melt spacer (Surlyn 1702, 30 μm thick, Solaronix), as shown in the insets of Fig. 3a and b. The functional mechanism of the photodetectors is depicted in Fig. S4.† Under light illumination, the inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 can absorb light and generate electron–hole pairs. Subsequently, the electron–hole pairs are rapidly separated and gathered by the electrodes under the applied electric field, therefore the device current is greatly increased in response to the light. Fig. 3a and b display the current–voltage (I–V) plots of y-CsPbI3- and b-CsPbI3-based photodetectors obtained under darkness and simulated solar illumination, respectively. The linear curves indicate that both y-CsPbI3 and b-CsPbI3 have good ohmic contacts with FTO electrodes, which are favorable for charge transfer. Owing to the wide bandgap of y-CsPbI3 (2.76 eV), the y-CsPbI3 photodetectors exhibit a weak response under light illumination. Under dark conduction, the b-CsPbI3 photodetectors present a low current value, because of their intrinsic semiconductive properties, while under light illumination, the b-CsPbI3 photodetectors show a much higher current density. The significant photocurrent density increase of b-CsPbI3 photodetectors can be ascribed to the remarkable light harvesting capability resulting from the strong absorption in the visible spectrum region (Fig. 2c). Besides, the photoresponse performances of the b-CsPbI3 photodetectors under illumination of different wavelengths were also measured, as shown in Fig. 3c, indicating that the b-CsPbI3 photodetectors can work effectively under a broad wavelength range, which is superior to the previously reported CsPbBr3-based photodetectors.40 The photocurrent–time (I–t) response of the b-CsPbI3 photodetector was measured at a bias of 3.0 V under intermittent light illumination with an on/off interval of 12 s (Fig. 3d and e), exhibiting the good reversibility and repeatability of b-CsPbI3 photodetectors. It is well known that the rise time (tr) and the delay time (td) are important parameters to evaluate the performance of a photodetector. Quantitatively, the tr is defined as the time required for dark current to increase to 90% of the maximum value of the photocurrent density, or vice versa. As shown in Fig. 3d, both the tr and td of the b-CsPbI3 photodetector are less than 100 ms. This photoresponse rate is comparable to those of the previously-reported photodetectors based on ZnO nanoparticles, TiO2 films, and other perovskite materials.41–45 The strong light response of the b-CsPbI3 photodetector can be ascribed to: (1) the good intrinsic light-harvesting capability of b-CsPbI3, (2) the high quality of the b-CsPbI3 film and (3) the good electric contact between b-CsPbI3 and FTO electrodes with almost no interfacial barrier.

Recently, the design and preparation of novel inorganic halide perovskites have drawn tremendous attention because the performances of PSCs based on inorganic perovskites exhibited rapid progress over the past two years.22–28 The b-CsPbI3 product was also used for the fabrication of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. Fig. 4a and b display the schematic cross-sectional view of two kinds of b-CsPbI3-based all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with the structures of FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2)/b-CsPbI3/carbon (AIPSC-1) and FTO/c-TiO2/b-CsPbI3/carbon (AIPSC-2), respectively. All of the organic components in common organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, such as organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (usually MAPbI3 or FAPbI3), organic hole transport materials (usually 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene or polytriarylamine), and organic additives in hole transport materials (mainly lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide or tert-butylpyridine), were completely eliminated from the all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, to prevent the disadvantages caused by the organic components, especially the high cost and the performance instability against high temperature, moisture, etc. Fig. 4c exhibits the energy band levels of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, revealing the electron extraction from the b-CsPbI3 conduction band to the TiO2 conduction band and the hole extraction from the CsPbI3 valence band to the carbon electrode.10,11,22,46 In this configuration, a layer of the carbon electrode works as a bifunctional film for both effective hole extraction and collection since it has a suitable work function (−5.0 eV);10 therefore, both organic hole transport materials and noble metal electrodes can be replaced by the carbon electrode with remarkable stability, good processability and low cost. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) plots of AIPSC-1 and AIPSC-2 under simulated solar AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 4d, and the corresponding performance parameters are listed in Table S2.† The AIPSC-1 with a m-TiO2 layer exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.48% with a short-circuit density (JSC) of 13.74 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.58 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44. In contrast, the all-inorganic perovskite solar cells without the m-TiO2 layer present an increase in all the performance parameters. As shown in Fig. 4d and Table S2,† the AIPSC-2 shows a higher PCE of 4.65% with a JSC of 14.31 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.67 V and a FF of 0.48. These results indicate that the b-CsPbI3 film has sufficient carrier diffusion length, therefore it is not necessary to introduce the m-TiO2 layer to extract electrons from CsPbI3. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value of CsPbI3/carbon-based AIPSC-2 is higher than those of the previously reported CsPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/metal (Au or Ag)-based perovskite solar cells.24,25 Moreover, the facile synthesis method of b-CsPbI3 in this work provides a scalable approach to prepare all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with an easy fabrication process. In theory, with a bandgap of 1.73 eV, the maximum JSC of CsPbI3-based all-inorganic PSCs can reach ∼21 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination. Therefore, there is still plenty of room for us to further improve the performances of CsPbI3-based all-inorganic PSCs in the future.

In summary, we have developed a batch-sale solution-phase synthesis method for the preparation of inorganic cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = I or Br) with high yield and good quality. The as-prepared y-CsPbI3 in the orthorhombic phase can be easily converted to b-CsPbI3 in the cubic perovskite phase after thermal annealing. The photodetectors based on b-CsPbI3 show a remarkable performance under a broad wavelength range of light illumination, owing to the appropriate bandgap and strong optical absorption. Moreover, all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based on b-CsPbI3 and carbon electrode were also fabricated, which avoided the disadvantages of organic components in common organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, such as high-cost and instability against heat and humidity. We expect that the synthetic method reported here can be extended to the synthesis of other inorganic perovskite materials, such as Sn-based perovskites with less toxic elements, contributing to the batch fabrication of high-performance and low-cost perovskite devices.
