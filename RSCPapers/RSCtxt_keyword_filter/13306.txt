To date, perovskite solar cells mainly depend on spiro-OMeTAD to perform a key role as a hole transporting material (HTM). However, the complicated multi-step synthetic procedures and high-cost purification process for spiro-OMeTAD limited its potential for commercial application. Herein, three new carbazole-based HTMs with a starburst structure, coded as SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) via tuning the substitution position from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety, have been successfully synthesized via three-step synthesis from commercially available reagents and investigated for highly efficient perovskite solar cells. By adopting this strategy, among them, molecularly engineered carbazole derivative SGT-405(3,6) exhibits significantly increased Tg (192.7 °C), improved film forming ability, reduced hole reorganization energy and enhanced hole mobility compared to its parent molecule SGT-405(2,7) and spiro-OMeTAD. Owing to the promising properties of SGT-405(3,6), meso-porous type PrSCs employing SGT-405(3,6) showed a remarkable PCE of 18.87%, which is better than that of the photovoltaic device employing spiro-OMeTAD (17.71%). To the best of our knowledge, the achieved PCE (18.87%) is the highest value reported for devices with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-porous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/HTM/Au employing small-molecular HTMs. Meanwhile, owing to the simple synthesis of SGT-405(3,6), compared with SGT-405(2,7) previously developed by our group, synthesis cost was much lowered, resulting in low cost compared to the spiro-OMeTAD and SGT-405(3,6), by approximately three times. Furthermore, the long-term device stability of PrSCs was enhanced for SGT-405(3,6) to some extent compared to those of other HTMs studied here due to the good uniform capping layer of SGT-405(3,6) on top of the perovskite layer and the prevention of moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. Therefore, SGT-405(3,6) is a promising low-cost and efficient non-spiro type HTM with potential to replace expensive spiro-OMeTAD for PrSCs.
Introduction
Perovskites have been widely employed as an efficient light absorbing layer for photovoltaic cells due to their broad spectral absorption1,2 from visible to near-infrared, high charge carrier mobilities,3 long charge diffusion lengths,4,5 small exciton binding energy (ca. 50 meV),6 and solution-processing abilities.7 Very recently, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed to over 22%.8 Due to the rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PrSCs), they were selected as one of the top ten emerging technologies of 2016.9
Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are a necessary component10 for efficient PrSCs, since HTMs play a critical role in efficiently extracting holes from the perovskite to the HTM layer and simultaneously transmitting to the counter electrode in order to decrease charge recombination and loss of Voc. So far, spiro-OMeTAD has been the most commonly used hole transporting material for efficient PrSCs. Unfortunately, the complicated synthetic scheme and high-cost purification procedures (sublimation) for spiro-OMeTAD result in efficient but costly materials, because the synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD involves five reaction steps that require low temperature (−78 °C), and sensitive (n-butyl-lithium or Grignard reagents) and aggressive (Br2) reagents.11 In addition, the impurities in HTMs can act as trap sites for holes, and thus high-purity sublimation-grade spiro-OMeTAD is required to obtain high-performance devices.12 The complicated synthesis and high-cost purification procedures (sublimation) of spiro-OMeTAD hindered its potential for commercialization of efficient PrSCs. Therefore it is necessary to develop more economical and efficient alternative non-spiro type HTMs to spiro-OMeTAD.
Carbazole derivatives have attracted much attention due to their interesting photochemical properties.13,14 Increased attention to carbazole-based derivatives could be explained by the features of carbazole derivatives: low cost of the 9H-carbazole starting material, good chemical and environmental stability, versatility of the carbazole reactive sites that can react with a wide variety of functional groups to fine tune its electronic and optical properties.15–17 In our previous work, we reported the synthesis and characterization of carbazole-based HTMs with two- or three-arm chemical structures, which were linked through phenylene-derived central core units. We also investigated their application in CH3NH3PbX3-based perovskite-sensitized solar cells.18,19
In this work, in order to further decrease the synthesis cost and improve the hole transporting capability, we designed and synthesized three derivatives of SGT-405(2,7),18SGT-410(2,7) and SGT-411(2,7)19via tuning the substitution position from the 2,7 to the 3,6 position of carbazole, which are coded as SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6)and SGT-411(3,6). It is worth mentioning that the substitution position tuning from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety not only simplified the synthesis routes (Fig. 2 and 3), but also improved its hole transporting capability, which can be illustrated by its improved smooth film forming ability and hole mobility compared to SGT-405(2,7). With the device structure of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-porous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/HTM/Au, the SGT-405(3,6) showed a PCE of 18.87%, which is better than that of the photovoltaic devices based on spiro-OMeTAD (17.71%). To the best of our knowledge, the achieved PCE (18.87%) is the highest value reported for the devices with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-porous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/HTM/Au employing small-molecular HTMs. Therefore, the simple synthesis and good performance of SGT-405(3,6) make it a very promising candidate for industrial production in the near future.

Results and discussion
The carbazole moiety consists of a pyrrole ring fused to two benzene rings. The nitrogen in the pyrrole ring makes carbazole an electron-donating unit (p-type). Besides, the carbazole unit itself possesses good thermal stability, and further it can be functionalized with a variety of substituents to tune its thermal, photo-physical and electrochemical properties for OLED16,17,20 and solar cells.21 Therefore, carbazole derivatives have attracted much attention for organic semiconductors22–26 due to their good thermal stability, low-cost starting material, high electron-donating ability and chemical stability. In our previous work, carbazole derivatives based on the (2,7) substitution position of the carbazole unit, SGT-405(2,7)18 and SGT-411(2,7)19 exhibited good photovoltaic performance when employed as HTMs for MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells. However, the preparation of 2,7-dibromocarbazole is a challenging task, which involves the nitration of 4,4′-dibromo biphenyl by nitric acid and cadogan reductive cyclization, as shown in Fig. 2.27–29 Herein, we try to tune the substitution position from the 2,7 to the 3,6 position of the carbazole moiety, as shown in Fig. 2. Compared to 2,7-dibromocarbazole, 3,6-dibromocarbazole is a commercially available and cost-effective material. In addition, because the electron donating ability of 3,6-carbazole is higher due to the fact that the N atom is at the para position in 3,6-carbazole derivatives,30,31 we can expect that the newly designed 3,6-carbazole derivatives may have better hole transporting properties. Therefore, we designed and synthesized new three carbazole derivatives, which are coded as SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) (see Fig. 1). The synthetic scheme for the newly designed molecules is shown in Fig. 3.
The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three newly developed HTMs and reference HTMs (spiro-OMeTAD and SGT-405(2,7)) measured in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 4. The maximum absorption peaks of SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6), SGT-411(3,6) and reference molecules of spiro-OMeTAD and SGT-405(2,7) are summarized in Table 1. All new HTMs showed strong absorption bands at 270–310 nm, which are attributed to the π–π* transitions of carbazole and SGT units, and weak absorption bands at 330–400 nm, corresponding to the n–π* transitions of carbazole and SGT units.32 It is worth stating that no absorption peak of SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) observed in the visible region compared to spiro-OMeTAD is truly beneficial in terms of subduing the incident photon loss absorbed by the HTM layer itself.18,33 Compared to the λmax of spiro-OMeTAD (385 nm), the λmax values of SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) are blue shifted to 306 nm, indicating that much weakened conjugation in SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The only chemical structure difference between SGT-405(2,7) and SGT-405(3,6) is shown in Fig. 1. Even though the substitution position tuning from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety leads to approximately 36 nm red shift of λmax, compared to SGT-405(2,7), SGT-405(3,6) exhibits a much decreased absorption peak in the wavelength region of 350–425 nm. From the above absorption profiles, it could be confirmed that the newly synthesized HTMs can act as HTMs without interfering with the incident light absorbing process by the perovskite layer.18,34 The maximum emission peaks of SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) are located at 466 nm, 466 nm and 530 nm, respectively. From the intersection of absorption and emission spectra, their band-gap can be estimated and summarized in Table 1.

The HOMO energy level was derived from the first oxidation potential, whereas the LUMO energy level was determined by subtracting the band-gap energy from the HOMO energy level. In order to determine the first oxidation potential (Eox) of the newly developed HTMs, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted in DCM solution. The diagram of CV curves are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding energy levels are collected in Table 1. The HOMO energy level of spiro-OMeTAD is measured to be −5.25 V, which is similar to the value of previously reported results.35 The HOMO energy levels of the newly synthesized HTMs (−5.26 eV for SGT-405(3,6) and SGT-410(3,6), −5.24 eV for SGT-411(3,6)) are very close to that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.25 eV) and well aligned with the valence band of the perovskite (−5.43 eV). The energy level alignment of the related materials used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 6. The suitable HOMO energy levels of the newly developed HTMs allow holes to be extracted from the perovskite to the HTM layer. In addition, LUMO energy levels of all newly designed HTMs are much higher than the conduction band of the perovskite, indicating that the newly designed HTMs could act as an electron blocking layer and thus reduce the charge recombination processes.

The thermal properties of various HTMs were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. And Fig. 7 shows that all of the newly designed small molecules have high decomposition temperature (Tdec) located in the range of 372–400 °C, with a weight loss of 5%, which is similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD (417 °C), indicating that the newly developed HTMs possess good thermal stability. It is already reported that HTMs possessing higher glass transition temperature can reduce the tendency of oriented aggregation (crystallization) upon heating.36,37 The glass transition temperature (Tg) of HTMs is an important indicator for the morphological stability of the amorphous film upon long time device storage or heating. Among them, SGT-405(3,6) exhibited a very high glass transition (Tg) of 192.7 °C (Fig. 8). Comparison of Tg of SGT-405(3,6) with that of SGT-405(2,7) shows that substitution position tuning from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety leads to the increase of Tg by 44.1 °C. In addition, the glass transition temperature of SGT-405(3,6) is much higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (125.8 °C). However, there are no glass transition peaks detected for both SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6). Additionally, the crystallization process is detected at 233 °C for SGT-405(3,6) during the first heating scan, whereas no crystallization was observed during the cooling and second and third heating steps. In applying small molecular materials for electronic and optoelectronic devices, the morphological stability upon heating is often required, since phase transitions could take place during device operation (e.g., solar cells sitting continuously in direct sunlight can get quite hot, especially under hot climatic conditions). Therefore, we studied the morphological stability of various HTM films spin-coated onto the glass substrate under different heating conditions (w/o heating or heating at 130 °C for 1 hour) by polarized optical microscopy in atmosphere. When annealing treatment (130 °C, 1 hour) was applied on various HTM spin-coated films, enlarged crystallization areas were observed in the case of SGT-405(2,7), SGT-410(3,6), SGT-411(3,6) and spiro-OMeTAD films, while almost no change of surface morphology of SGT-405(3,6) was observed, indicating that SGT-405(3,6) exhibits the best morphological stability upon heating (stable amorphous) due to its very high Tg of 193 °C (Fig. S1†).

The uniformity of the HTM capping layer spin-coated onto the perovskite film was dramatically influenced by the solubility and aggregation behavior (related to the molecular structure) of HTMs.38 It has been widely demonstrated that smooth film forming ability of HTMs is very important for the creation of good interfacial contact of perovskite/HTM/Au, which could significantly affect the hole extraction and the charge recombination in devices.39,40 Therefore the surface morphology of various spin-coated HTM films was investigated by FE-SEM. As shown in Fig. 9, the spin-coated SGT-405(3,6) film exhibits a very smooth and uniform capping layer on the perovskite layer, which could be ascribed to its highly twisted non-planar molecular structure.41 As for the spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD film, there are some nano-sized needle-shaped islands appeared as shown in Fig. 9f, indicating that spiro-OMeTAD tends to oriented aggregation or crystallization due to its intrinsic feature,42,43 which is in agreement with the previously reported result that some very small crystals were observed in the spin-coated film of spiro-OMeTAD.41 The chemically structural difference of three newly synthesized HTMs is shown in Fig. 1. Long alkyl chains in SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) molecules were introduced to increase their solubility. However, a surprising phenomenon was observed, when compared to the uniform SGT-405(3,6) film: some sphere-shaped islands were observed in the spin-coated films of SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6), which could be ascribed to the aggregation induced by the additional van der Waals interactions stemming from the long alkyl chains.38

In order to further study the top morphology of each HTM film spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer, atomic force microscopy was used to measure surface roughness of various HTM capping layers. As shown in Fig. 10, the perovskite-only film without HTMs shows the largest surface roughness (RMS) of 15.989 nm (see Fig. 10a), after the deposition of HTMs on top of perovskite films, the roughness was significantly decreased. The value of surface roughness decreases in the order of SGT-411(3,6), spiro-OMeTAD, SGT-410(3,6), SGT-405(2,7) and SGT-405(3,6). The 3D-AFM image of the top morphology of SGT-405(3,6) (see Fig. 10b) indicates that SGT-405(3,6) leads to the formation of a uniform and full coverage capping layer on top of the perovskite film, which is in agreement with the result from FE-SEM pictures, as shown in Fig. 9b. It should be addressed that the surface morphology and roughness should have a strong influence on the photovoltaic performances. The relatively high fill factor of 78.65 of SGT-405(3,6) is partially contributed to its good film forming ability. The relatively low fill factor of SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) is partially ascribed to their roughness surface morphology.

Hole mobility is another significant parameter to consider in the design of new HTMs for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the hole mobility of each newly synthesized HTM was measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.44,45 The current density Jsc is limited by space charge and is given as  where J is the current density, μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the dielectric constant of the material (normally taken to approach 3 for organic semiconductors),46V is the applied bias, and d is the film thickness. The hole only device structure used in this work: FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. Fitting the J–V curves (Fig. 11) for each HTM applying to the equation evaluates the hole mobilities to be listed in Table 1. The value of hole mobility (8.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of spiro-OMeTAD obtained here is very close to the value of 8.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported in a previous literature.47 As shown in Table 1, SGT-410(3,6) exhibits the lowest hole mobility (5.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). SGT-405(3,6) exhibits the highest hole mobility (1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), followed by SGT-405(2,7) (1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). SGT-411(3,6) shows a comparable value of 8.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to that of spiro-OMeTAD.

Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements indicated that SGT-405(3,6) exhibited 1.8 times higher hole mobility than SGT-405(2,7), but these two molecules show quite similar chemical structure to each other. To elucidate this from a theoretical approach, density functional calculations were performed by using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level with the Gaussian 09 program. And spiro-OMeTAD used as a reference compound was calculated together using the same basis set and calculation method. The optimized geometry structures, detailed energy levels of Frontier molecular orbitals and hole reorganization energy (λ) are summarized in Fig. 12. The reorganization energy (λ) represents the relaxation of the molecule when one electron is withdrawn or donated. Generally, based on the anatomy of a Marcus-type electron-transfer mechanism between the molecules, the small reorganization energy implies the fast transfer rate for electrons or holes to some extent.45 As shown in Fig. 12, the hole reorganization energy of spiro-OMeTAD is 153.3 meV which is close to the value reported in previous literature.45 The λ values of SGT-405(3,6) and SGT-405(2,7) molecules are 95 meV and 117.3 meV, respectively, indicating that SGT405-(3,6) exhibits a very small hole reorganization energy, much smaller than those of SGT-405(2,7) and spiro-OMeTAD, which agrees with the trend of hole mobility values measured by the SCLC method. Furthermore, the λ value of 95 meV of SGT-405(3,6) is indeed comparable to the hole reorganization energies computed for the best organic p-type semiconducting materials (e.g., heteroacenes or oligoacenes).48 These findings demonstrated that the substitution position tuning from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety not only simplified synthesis route, but also decreased its hole reorganization energy.

The interfacial hole transfer process between the new HTMs and perovskite can be investigated by TR-PL (time-resolved photoluminescence) measurements.32Fig. 13 shows TR-PL spectra acquired from various perovskite films spin-coated with different HTMs. Compared with the neat perovskite films, the PL intensity is quenched much more significantly for spiro-OMeTAD and SGT-405(3,6), followed by SGT-405(2,7), SGT-411(3,6) and then SGT-410(3,6), indicating that SGT-405(3,6) exhibits better hole extraction ability compared to that of SGT-405(2,7), SGT-411(3,6) and SGT-410(3,6).

From the characterization of the newly synthesized HTMs by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement, we can expect that the newly developed HTMs have the potential to be applied as hole transporting materials for PrSCs. The high hole mobility of SGT-405(3,6) could potentially lead to a high Jsc value for perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the high hole mobility and excellent film forming ability of SGT-405(3,6) could potentially lead to a higher fill factor of the operating devices.34
To evaluate the ability of the synthesized compounds acting as the HTM for PrSCs, the meso-porous type configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx/HTM/Au in Fig. 6b was used in this work. All devices were fabricated using a one step deposition method with toluene dropping processes49 and the detailed procedure is described in the ESI.† Different component layers of the representative complete device can be seen clearly from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 6c. For comparison, spiro-OMeTAD and SGT-405(2,7)18 were employed as reference HTMs in this study.
The J–V curves of perovskite solar cells with different HTMs are shown in Fig. 14a. And their detailed parameters of photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 15. The photovoltaic parameters of dopant-free devices using different HTMs are shown in Fig. 16 and Table 4. The spiro-OMeTAD-based device gives a PCE of 17.71% with a Jsc of 22.01 mA cm−2, an FF of 76.58, and a Voc of 1.051 V. The SGT-405(3,6)-based PrSC device exhibits the highest PCE up to 18.87%, mainly coming from the enhanced Jsc of 22.93 mA cm−2 and a remarkably high FF of 78.65, while the SGT-405(2,7)-based device exhibits a PCE of 18.0% with a Jsc of 22.32 mA cm−2, an FF of 76.32, and a Voc of 1.057 V. The FF is related to series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). In order to obtain a high FF, the solar cells should have a low Rs and a high Rsh.50 In other words, the HTM layer should effectively block the electron and transport the hole from MAPbCl3−xI3 to the Au electrode. The fabrication conditions used for all devices are the same, except for the HTM. Therefore, the enhanced hole mobility and better film forming ability of SGT-405(3,6) compared to the other HTMs used in this work, provided the SGT-405(3,6) based PrSC with an enhanced Jsc of 22.928 mA cm−2, a remarkably high FF of 78.65 and the lowest Rs of 30.9 Ω. The trend of fill factors of PrSC devices employing various HTMs followed a trend identical to the hole mobility of various HTMs, ascribed to a reduced Rs (series resistance). A straightforward method of estimating Rs for a solar cell is to calculate the slope of the J–V curve near Voc.51 As shown in Table 3, SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6) based PrSCs showed a relatively high series resistance of 44.4 Ω and 45.2 Ω, respectively. Fig. 14b shows the monochromatic incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of perovskite solar cells employing different HTMs, and the integrated photocurrent densities are in good agreement with the Jsc measured from J–V measurements.

To investigate the effect of HTMs on the cells stability, aging tests of the perovskite solar cells without encapsulation were performed under the same dark storage conditions (in atmosphere, at room temperature and the humidity in the range of 15–20%). As shown in Fig. 17, SGT-405(3,6) exhibited the best device stability among the five types of HTM based PrSCs, while SGT-411(3,6) based devices exhibited the poorest device stability. The device stability test results revealed that the improved stability of SGT-405(3,6)-based cells compared to other HTM-based devices could be attributed to the uniform HTM capping layer on the top of the perovskite layer, preventing the moisture penetration into the perovskite layer.40,43

Conclusions
In this study, three new carbazole-based starburst small molecular HTMs, which are coded as SGT-405(3,6), SGT-410(3,6) and SGT-411(3,6), were designed and synthesized on the basis of our previous work18,19via tuning the substitution position from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety. This makes them easily synthesized via three-step synthesis from commercially available starting materials. They were characterized by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. Among them, SGT-405(3,6) exhibits high glass transition temperature (192.7 °C), good solubility, excellent film forming ability and high hole mobility compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile SGT-405(3,6) shows very small hole reorganization energy (95 meV). These analytic results demonstrate that the substitution position tuning from the (2,7) to the (3,6) position of the carbazole moiety not only simplified the synthesis route, but also improved its hole transporting performance, which can be illustrated by its improved smooth film forming ability, reduced hole reorganization energy (λ) and increased hole mobility compared to SGT-405(2,7). Owing to the promising characteristics of SGT-405(3,6), with the device structure of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-porous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/HTM/Au, the device employing SGT-405(3,6) as a HTM affords a remarkable conversion efficiency of 18.87%, which is better than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based device (17.71%) under the same fabrication conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the achieved PCE (18.87%) is the highest conversion efficiency among the devices with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-porous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/HTM/Au employing small-molecular HTMs. In addition, the long-term device stability of PrSCs was enhanced for SGT-405(3,6) compared to other HTMs studied here due to the good uniform capping layer of SGT-405(3,6) on top of the perovskite layer and the prevention of moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. Our work demonstrates that SGT-405(3,6) is a promising alternative non-spiro type small molecular HTM with low-cost and excellent performance to existing cost ineffective and synthetically challenging spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells.
