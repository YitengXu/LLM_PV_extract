An inverted-type organic thin-film solar cell using the thin film of the C60–EDA adduct as a buffer layer was fabricated. The solar cell performance suggested that the C60–EDA adduct thin film functioned as an electron-transporting layer, similarly to the titanium oxides in typical inverted-type organic thin-film solar cells.
The importance of fullerenes and their derivatives as n-type semiconductors has been demonstrated by their many applications such as in organic transistors,1 and organic solar cells.2,3 In organic thin-film solar cells, an important factor in the photoelectric conversion performance is the carrier mobility in the organic film. Adjacent or aggregated fullerene structures are suitable for efficient electron transportation. Therefore, the development of a facile preparation of fullerene aggregates or assemblies is an important research objective.4,5 One of the most facile methods for the chemical modification of fullerenes is the addition of amino groups to its structure.6,7 The reactions of C60 and diamines also readily proceed to afford such adducts.8,9 We found that the reaction of fullerenes (C60 and C70) with a large excess of ethylenediamine (EDA) afforded uniform submicrometer particles consisting of fullerenes and EDA.10–12 We also demonstrated that particles of the C60–EDA adduct and its derivatives contributed to photoelectric conversion in a wet-type half photocell and an organic thin-film solar cell.10,13,14
Recently, inverted-type organic thin-film solar cells have attracted increased attention because they can be fabricated easily under ambient conditions using titanium oxide,15–18 zinc oxide,19,20 and others as electron transporting materials. To expand the structural variation of the organic thin-film solar cells, the development of electron-transporting materials with a hole-blocking function is essential. As an example, several groups have reported that development of fullerene derivatives as a buffer material for an inverted-type organic thin-film solar cell.21–23 However, practical options for n-type organic semiconductor materials are rather limited at this stage, and variations of n-type organic “polymer” semiconductor materials are particularly insufficient for potential needs. We believe that the C60–EDA adduct and its derivatives are potentially applicable as novel n-type organic polymer semiconductor materials.
Therefore, in this study, we solubilized C60–EDA adduct particles in EDA and demonstrated that the EDA-solubilized C60–EDA adduct functions as a buffer material with electron-transporting and hole-blocking properties for an inverted-type organic thin-film solar cell. We think that the residual amino groups of the C60–EDA adduct thin-film provide binding sites between (1) the fullerene derivative in the photoactive layer and the C60–EDA adduct layer, and (2) the C60–EDA adduct layer and the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode, which may allow efficient electron transfer at the interfaces.
The preparation of the C60–EDA adduct-based thin films and photovoltaic devices is summarized in Fig. 1. All reagents were used as received. The C60–EDA adduct particles (C60P) were prepared as follows: toluene solution (100 mL) of C60 (144 mg, 2.0 mmol L−1) and toluene solution (100 mL) of EDA (13.4 mL, 2.0 mol L−1, 1000 eq. to C60) were mixed at room temperature under sonication for 1 min, and then continued stirring for 20 h. The product was collected by vacuum filtration and dried in vacuo to afford C60P as a brown powder.14 As previously reported, C60P that was solubilized by the addition of dodecanoyl chloride showed considerably shorter retention time compared to C60, suggesting that C60P is a pearl-necklace-type polymer consisting of C60 (as the pearl) and EDA (as the linker molecule).

C60P (2 mg) was dissolved in EDA (10 mL) at room temperature and mixed under sonication for 5 min. The EDA solution of the C60P was stirred for over approximately 2 week at room temperature before using for thin film preparation. The thin film was formed by drop-casting the EDA solution of C60P (∼0.1 mL, 3 drops using glass pipette) on an ITO electrode (∼10 Ω sq−1; Geomatec Co., Ltd) and heating at 60 °C for 5 min. This formed the C60P-based thin-film (denoted as C60P–EDA) on the substrate via the “solvent annealing method”24,25 with a coating area of about 4 cm2 (2 × 2 cm2). Finally, the C60P–EDA thin-film-coated substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 5 min to obtain the C60P–EDA thin-film modified ITO electrode, denoted as ITO/C60P–EDA.
A chlorobenzene solution of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Lisicon SP001, Merck, 25 mg mL−1) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Frontier Carbon nanom spectra E100, 20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated (500 rpm for 5 s, then 700 rpm for 60 s) onto the C60P–EDA surface of the ITO/C60P–EDA, and then the modified substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, affording the sample ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM. Next, a water dispersion of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP. Al 4083) as a hole-transport material was spin-coated (500 rpm for 5 s, then 2000 rpm for 60 s) onto the ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM. The PEDOT:PSS-modified substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min (ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS). Finally, silver (Ag) as top electrode was deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS layer through the metal mask with holes by vacuum deposition and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min to obtain the organic thin-film solar cell incorporating the C60P–EDA thin-film as a buffer layer (ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag). The active area of each solar cell was 16 mm2 (4 × 4 mm2). A reference organic solar cell without the C60P–EDA thin film (ITO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) was also prepared in an analogous fashion. All processes for solar cell fabrication except for the vacuum deposition were performed under open air conditions. For the comparison, P3HT:PCBM modified ITO electrode (denoted as ITO/P3HT:PCBM) was also fabricated by similar manner. To obtain sample of the C60P–EDA for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, glass substrates were similarly modified with arbitrary amount of the C60P–EDA (glass/C60P–EDA).
Apparent colour of the C60P–EDA solution was clear yellow. Differential absorption spectrum of the C60P–EDA solution after subtracting of the spectrum of EDA is shown in Fig. 2a. In this spectrum, a light scattering was mainly observed and a weak shoulder peak was found at around 330 nm, which corresponded to the π−π* absorption band of the C60 structure.

The absorption spectra of the ITO/C60P–EDA, ITO/P3HT:PCBM and ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM samples are shown in Fig. 2b. In the ITO/P3HT:PCBM and ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM spectra, broad absorption bands in the range of 400–600 nm for P3HT and near 340 nm for PCBM were observed. In the range of 300–420 nm, larger absorbance was observed in the ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM comparing to the ITO/P3HT:PCBM. Though weak absorption profile was observed in the ITO/C60P–EDA, small absorption band was observed around 380 nm, which corresponded to the C60P–EDA (Fig. 2a). Thus, the absorption profile of the ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM can be attributed to the sum of the P3HT:PCBM layer and the C60P–EDA thin film.
A macroscopic photograph of the ITO/C60P–EDA is shown in Fig. 3. The C60P–EDA layer in the ITO/C60P–EDA was seen as flat thin-film with light yellow.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of C60P and ITO/C60P–EDA are shown in Fig. 4. The SEM image of ITO/C60P–EDA indicates that the C60P–EDA thin film is almost uniformly coated on the ITO surface. In addition, no spherical particles from the original C60P particles can be seen in the ITO/C60P–EDA, which suggests that C60P was completely dissolved in EDA because of additional fullerene-amine addition reactions. Atomic force microscope (AFM) image of ITO/C60P–EDA and TEM image of the C60P–EDA scraped from glass/C60P–EDA also indicate that the C60P–EDA thin-film is almost uniformly coated on the substrate and no spherical particles can be seen in C60P–EDA thin-film (Fig. 5).

The film thicknesses of the solar cell (ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) were estimated to be ∼50–60 nm for PEDOT:PSS, ∼300 nm for P3HT:PCBM, and ∼40–50 nm for C60P–EDA by corresponding absorption spectrum and result of AFM measurement.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag were measured using a potentiostat under illumination with a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5). Open circuit voltages (Voc), short circuit current densities (Jsc), serial resistances (Rs), shunt resistances (Rsh), fill factors (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (η) of solar cells are summarized in Table 1.

The J–V curve of ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag with top η value is shown in Fig. 6. The ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag solar cell generated stable photovoltages and photocurrent, whereas the corresponding reference ITO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag cell lacking the C60P–EDA thin film exhibited Jsc and Voc that were negligible (data not shown).

LUMO level of the C60P–EDA thin film itself is unclear at this stage. Alternately, first reduction peak potential of a similar C60–EDA adduct modified with dodecanoyl chloride in solution was ∼0.25 V negative comparing that of PCBM.14 These results suggest that the C60–EDA thin film works well as an electron-transporting (hole-blocking) layer, similarly to the titanium oxide in typical inverted-type organic thin-film solar cells.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag cell (Fig. 7) was calculated from the short-circuit photocurrents, which were recorded under irradiation with monochromatic light. The IPCE profile corresponds to the absorption observed for glass/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM in the visible wavelength region, which indicates that the photoexcitation moieties of the ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag solar cell in the visible region are P3HT and PCBM.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectrum of ITO/C60P–EDA/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. 
These photoelectric conversion properties suggest the following mechanism for photocurrent and photovoltage generation: (1) photoexcitation of P3HT:PCBM, (2) generation of holes and electrons between P3HT and PCBM, (3) transfer of the photogenerated holes to the Ag electrode through the PEDOT:PSS layer, and (4) transfer of the photogenerated electrons to the ITO electrode through the C60P–EDA thin film.
A detailed characterization and optimization of the HOMO–LUMO levels and carrier transporting properties of the C60P–EDA thin film itself should be declared for efficient photoelectric conversion.
Conclusions
In this study, we successfully developed a facile preparation of a novel organic electronic material consisting of a C60–EDA adduct as a thin film, which can be applied as the buffer layer in an inverted-type organic thin-film solar cell. Detailed characterization of the C60P–EDA thin film and optimization of the experimental conditions for efficient photoelectric conversion performance are currently under investigation.
