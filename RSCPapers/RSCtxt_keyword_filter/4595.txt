    , Accepted 5th August 2011First published on 15th September 2011AbstractThree donor–acceptor type copolymers, poly[9,9′-dioctylfluorene-alt-2,5-bis(seleno-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline] (PFSeQ), poly[9-(1′-octylnonylidene)fluorene-alt-2,5-bis(seleno-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline] (PAFSeQ), and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-2,5-bis(seleno-2-yl)-2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline] (PCSeQ), were synthesized through Suzuki coupling reactions for use as organic photovoltaic materials with high VOC values. In these polymers, selenophene, which has stronger electron-donating property than thiophene, was adopted as a spacer. The polymers had relatively low optical band gaps (<1.9 eV). We investigated bulk heterojunction type polymer solar cells based on the synthesized polymers used as electron donor materials and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) used as the acceptor. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices was in the range of 1.1–3.3% under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Among these polymers, PFSeQ exhibited the best device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.3% upon the introduction of PC71BM as the acceptor. This is the highest performance among photovoltaic materials containing selenophene units.
Introduction
Semiconducting polymers have generated considerable scientific and industrial interest for the past several decades because of their wide range of uses in organic electronics, such as in organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1–9 organic thin film transistors (OTFTs),10–12 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),13–17etc. Among these applications, OPVs have especially attracted significant research interest due to the worldwide technical trend towards sustainable development as well as economic feasibility.18,19 Nevertheless, low power conversion efficiency has been regarded as the most serious obstacle in OPVs.
The PCE value, which is the most important parameter in OPVs, is governed by the short current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) in an organic solar cell. The typical method for increasing PCE is to improve the photon-harvesting property by decreasing the band gap, which gives rise to increases of the JSC value.20,21 However, the strategy which excessively focuses on the JSC value has a drawback from the viewpoint of the energy level, since, in general, the HOMO energy level increases and the LUMO energy level decreases as the band gap decreases.22 Increasing the HOMO energy level induces decrease of the VOC, which lead to decrease of the PCE. Therefore, for high PCE values, the VOC value should be enhanced along with the JSC. Since the VOC is ultimately limited by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, lowering the HOMO energy level of the polymer is the most important factor for reaching a high VOC value.23,24 Recently, copolymers with low HOMO energy levels have been vigorously investigated since they have oxidative stability as well as high VOC values.25–28 Especially, since durability is of great concern for an industrial application, stability of materials, in the field of organic electronics, is regarded as an important property of an organic semiconductor.29,30
In this study, we synthesized new donor–acceptor type copolymers, i.e.PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ, with high VOC values for use in organic pholtovoltaics. In order to lower the HOMO energy level, fluorene and carbazole derivatives, both of which have low HOMO energy levels, were introduced as electron-donating units. In order to prevent the polymer band gap from increasing, selenophene, which has a stronger electron donating property than thiophene, was adopted as a spacer.31–35Quinoxaline was adopted as an electron-withdrawing unit and alkoxybenzene was introduced in quinoxaline as a side chain in order to increase the solubility of the polymers.
Bulk heterojunction-type devices that utilized PC61BM and PC71BM as acceptors were fabricated in order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ. Devices using the synthesized polymers and PCBM-blend films as active layers displayed a 1.1–3.3% power conversion efficiency. In the devices that used a PFSeQ/PC71BM blend film, in particular, the highest PCE level (3.3%) was detected (VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 7.9 mA cm−2, FF = 0.48).
Experimental section
Instruments and characterization
All of the reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise specified. The 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Brüker AMX400 spectrometer in CDCl3, and the chemical shifts were recorded in units of ppm with TMS as the internal standard. The elemental analyses were measured with EA1112 using a CE Instrument. The absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectroscopy system. The solutions that were used for the UV-visible spectroscopy measurements were dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 10 µg ml−1. The films were drop-coated from the chloroform solution onto a quartz substrate. All of the GPC analyses were carried out using THF as the eluent and a polystyrene standard as the reference. The TGA measurements were performed using a TA Instrument 2050. The cyclic voltammetric waves were produced using a Zahner IM6eX electrochemical workstation with a 0.1 M acetonitrile (substituted with nitrogen for 20 min) solution containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the electrolyte at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1. ITO, a Pt wire, and silver/silver chloride [Ag in 0.1 M KCl] were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical potential was calibrated against Fc/Fc+. The HOMO levels of the polymers were determined using the oxidation onset value. Onset potentials are values obtained from the intersection of the two tangents drawn at the rising current and the baseline changing current of the CV curves. The LUMO levels were calculated from the differences between the HOMO energy levels and the optical band-gaps, which were determined using the UV-vis absorption onset values in the films.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the photovoltaic devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) that was equipped with a Peccell solar simulator under an illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Thicknesses of the thin films were measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-step 500 surface profilometer with an accuracy of 1 nm. Topographic images of the active layers were obtained through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions using an XE-150 instrument.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
All of the bulk-heterojunction PV cells were prepared using the following device fabrication procedure. The glass/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates [Sanyo, Japan (10 Ω/γ)] were sequentially lithographically patterned, cleaned with detergent, and ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Then the substrates were dried on a hot-plate at 120 °C for 10 min and treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min in order to improve the contact angle just before the film coating process. Poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P 4083 Bayer AG) was passed through a 0.45 µm filter before being deposited onto ITO at a thickness of ca. 32 nm by spin-coating at 4000 rpm in air and then it was dried at 120 °C for 20 min inside a glove box. Composite solutions with polymers and PCBM were prepared using 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The concentration was controlled adequately in the 0.5 wt% range, and the solutions were then filtered through a 0.45 µm PTFE filter and then spin-coated (500–2000 rpm, 30 s) on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The device fabrication was completed by depositing thin layers of BaF2 (1 nm), Ba (2 nm), and Al (200 nm) at pressures of less than 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device was 4.0 mm2. Finally, the cell was encapsulated using UV-curing glue (Nagase, Japan). In this study, all of the devices were fabricated with the following structure: ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/BaF2/Ba/Al/encapsulation glass.
The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector that was equipped with a KG-5filter. The output photocurrent was adjusted to match the photocurrent of the Si reference cell in order to obtain a power density of 100 mW cm−2. After the encapsulation, all of the devices were operated under an ambient atmosphere of 25 °C.
Devices for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were fabricated in a manner similar to solar cells. The main difference is that in order to facilitate hole-only injection and transport, gold electrodes were deposited instead of the BaF2/Ba/Al cathode normally used in photovoltaic cells.

After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was washed with a dilute HCl solution, a dilute NH4OH solution, and water several times. After evaporating the solvent, the crude product was reprecipitated with methanol several times. The polymer was further purified through washing with methanol, acetone, and hexane in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 h. The chloroform soluble fraction was recovered and dried under a reduced pressure at 50 °C.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic routes of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight of PAFSeQ were lower than the others. This was due to the structural rigidity of PAFSeQ. Although planarity was increased by introducing the alkylidene side chain, the sp2-hybridized carbon at the 9-position of fluorene enhanced the rigidity of the polymer skeleton.35 This affected the solubility and yield of PAFSeQ. PFSeQ and PCSeQ had good solubilities in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, THF, toluene, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), while PAFSeQ was partially insoluble parting such solvents. For this reason, the yield of PAFSeQ seriously decreased after Soxhlet extraction.

All of the polymers had decomposition temperatures (Td) over 330 °C, which indicated that these polymers exhibited good thermal stability, making them applicable for use in polymer solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. The results of the molecular weight measurements and thermal properties are shown in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the UV-vis absorption spectra of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ in a chloroform solution and in thin solid films, respectively. The polymers exhibited maximum UV-vis absorption peaks (λmax) at 543 nm, 543 nm, and 547 nm respectively, in solution. Compared with P3HT's photon absorption property, the three synthesized polymers exhibited lower photon absorption properties than P3HT in the same absorption range as P3HT. However, PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ exhibited photon absorption in the longer wavelength range of the solar spectrum than did P3HT. Considering that the most photons in the solar spectrum are in the range of 600 nm to 800 nm, the three polymers, PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ, seemed to have good photon harvesting properties.
 Fig. 1  Comparison of UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers (a) in solution (in chloroform at a concentration of 10 µg ml−1) and (b) in film. 
As shown in Fig. 1(b), PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ exhibit similar UV-vis absorption properties in a film. Nevertheless, PFSeQ had the shortest band edge. Comparing PFSeQ with PCSeQ, the band edge of PCSeQ was red-shifted by about 14 nm since polycarbazole had more red-shifted band edge by about 20 nm compared with polyfluorene. Among these polymers, PAFSeQ had the longest UV-vis absorption onset, which stemmed from the increased planarity of its polymer backbone and the electron-donating property from the double bond in the 9-position of fluorene due to introducing the alkylidenefluorene. The optical band gaps of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ were calculated from the band edge of the UV-vis absorption spectrum in the film, and they were 1.88 eV, 1.8 eV, and 1.84 eV, respectively.
The electrochemical behavior of the copolymers was investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown by the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 2, the electrochemical oxidation onsets of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ and PCSeQ were 1.4 V, 1.25 V, and 1.35 V, respectively. The reduction parts were not assigned since the reduction peaks were not clear. The HOMO energy levels, which were calculated from the oxidation onsets, were −5.43 eV, −5.28 eV, and −5.38 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the difference between the HOMO energy levels and the optical band gap energies. According to the calculations, the LUMO energy levels of PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ were determined to be −3.55 eV, −3.48 eV, and −3.54 eV, respectively. According to the electrochemical study, the polymers must be air-stable since the HOMO energy levels were below the air oxidation threshold (ca. −5.27 eV or 0.57 V vs.SCE).26 Furthermore, this relatively low value assures a relatively high VOC in the final device. The optical electrochemical properties and calculated energy levels of the synthesized polymers are presented in Table 2.

Morphology analysis
The morphologies of the polymer/PCBM blend films were examined using AFM, as shown in Fig. 3. Dark-colored and light-colored areas correspond to PCBM domains and polymers, respectively. Holes were transferred to anode through p-channels that were composed of polymer materials, and electrons were transferred to cathode through n-channels that were composed of PCBM, therefore, development of detailed p, n-channels was very important. Although all of the blend films showed a smooth surface, large aggregated PCBM domains were obtained in the PAFSeQ/PC61BM film and the film was deficient with respect to detailed p, n-channels compared with the other films, which should be dependent upon the poor solubility of PAFSeQ. In contrast to the PAFSeQ/PC61BM film, PFSeQ and PCSeQ/PC61BM films had detailed p, n-channels.

The polymer/PC71BM blend films formed more detailed p, n-channels than the polymer/PC61BM blend films. In other words, aggregated large PC61BM domains were shown in the polymer/PC61BM blend films, while detailed PC71BM domains were spread in the whole area. The polymer/PC71BM blend films exhibited slightly higher RMS thickness values than the polymer/PC61BM blend films, which could have an effect on the FF of devices.
Hole mobility and photovoltaic characteristics
Hole-only devices (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au) were fabricated in order to estimate the hole mobilities of these polymersviaspace-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements. Hole mobilities of the active layers were calculated from the following SCLC using the J–V curves of hole only devices in the dark (Fig. 4).40 All of photovoltaic cells were fabricated with the bulk heterojunction geometry (BHG) with PCBM. The OPV cells were fabricated with a sandwiched glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer-PCBM/BaF2/Ba/Al structure. A blend of the polymer and PC71BM was dissolved in o-DCB, filtered through a 0.45 µm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, and spin coated at 500–1100 rpm for 30 s. The active layers were preannealed at 120 °C for 10 min before electrode deposition. Each substrate was patterned using photolithography techniques in order to produce a segment with an active area of 4.0 mm2. After all of the fabricated devices were encapsulated in a glove box, the J–V characteristics were measured under an ambient atmosphere. Device optimization involved over 40 devices made from over 10 independently prepared polymer/PC71BM films; optimum photovoltaic efficiencies between 3.1% and 3.5% were obtained especially in devices consisted of PFSeQ/PC71BM films.
 Fig. 4  
J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices measured in the dark. 
As shown in Fig. 5, PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ exhibited VOC values of 0.88 V, 0.78 V, and 0.8 V, and JSC values of 4.8 mA cm−2, 2.7 mA cm−2, and 5.0 mA cm−2, respectively, when PC61BM was used as an acceptor and 80 wt% PCBM was contained in the active layer (1:4, w/w). PFSeQ and PCSeQ exhibited similar JSC values. However, PFSeQ had a higher VOC value than did PCSeQ near 0.1 V. This originated from the HOMO energy levels.
 Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices that have (a) polymer/PC61BM and (b) polymer/PC71BM blend films as active layers. 
The best performance was observed in the device where PC71BM was used as an acceptor and 80 wt% PCBM was contained in the active layer (1:4, w/w). In this device, the VOC, JSC, and FF values of PFSeQ were 0.88 V, 7.9 mA cm−2, and 0.48, respectively, thus, the PCE value increased by 3.3%. In the case of the device with PCSeQ, the best performances of 0.84 V for VOC, 7.9 mA cm−2 for JSC, 0.48 for FF, and 2.9% for PCE were exhibited under the same conditions as those used for PFSeQ. However, PAFSeQ exhibited a relatively low PCE value of 1.2%. In spite of the improved PCE value upon introducing PC71BM as an acceptor, the FF values were lower than in the polymer/PC61BM device. Considering that the FF value depends on the morphology, as shown in the AFM images, the polymer/PC61BM film surfaces were smoother than those of the polymer/PC71BM films, which influences the FF value. However, more detailed p, n-channels were obtained upon introduction of PC71BM to the films, and this likely affected the improved JSC values.
As mentioned above, compared with other polymers, PAFSeQ exhibited a low PCE value of 1.2%, which was chiefly influenced by the JSC value. According to SCLC measurements, PFSeQ (2.45 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1), PAFSeQ (1.47 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1), and PCSeQ (1.21 × 10−6 cm2 V−1s−1) exhibited analogous values of hole mobilities. This indicated that differences in JSC values were not seriously affected by hole mobilities. Whereas, as shown in Fig. 6, the EQE spectrum of PAFSeQ was greatly different compared with the other two polymers. This means that the low JSC value of PAFSeQ originated from its low EQE value.

In other words, a low PCE value of PAFSeQ depends upon the low JSC value, and the origin of the low JSC value was the low EQE value of PAFSeQ. It was one reason of the low PCE value of PAFSeQ. Another reason was a rigid backbone structure and a low molecular weight of PAFSeQ. A double bond in the 9-position of fluorene reduced the flexibility of the alkyl chains, which resulted in a decrease of solubility. The low solubility exerted a strong influence on the molecular weight. A rigid backbone structure and the low molecular weight restricted intermolecular interaction in solid films, which was likely to be a key factor that limited the PCE value of PAFSeQ.
Photovoltaic devices with PC71BM as an acceptor showed higher EQE values than those with PC61BM as an acceptor, although they absorbed photons in the same range of the solar spectrum. It is because PC71BM has a stronger UV-vis absorption property than does PC61BM in the visible region, especially around 500 nm.41 As shown in Fig. 6(b), devices where PC71BM was introduced as an acceptor had especially increased EQE around the 500 nm wavelength region. Consequently, the enhanced EQE values due to the introduction of PC71BM resulted in increased absorption in the visible region and detailed p, n-channels greatly affected the JSC value, which influenced the PCE values of devices.
In order to investigate oxidative stability of photovoltaic devices based on three polymers, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured in ambient conditions for a month. All of the devices were encapsulated to prevent oxidation of the metal electrode and were placed in ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 7, the PCE values of the devices based on PFSeQ, PCSeQ, and PAFSeQ, respectively, as a donor material had changed little after a week. Moreover, the PCE values of these devices were decreased only about 20% even after a month, which was supposed to originate from electrochemical stability of donor polymers as mentioned above.

Conclusions
In this paper, three new copolymers—PFSeQ, PAFSeQ, and PCSeQ—with high VOC values were successfully synthesized. In order to improve the photon harvesting properties of these materials by reducing their band gaps, selenophene was introduced in their polymer backbones. The polymers had low band gaps (∼1.8 eV) and well balanced energy levels. The best device was the device with a 70 nm thick active layer of PFSeQ mixed with PC71BM in a 1:4 ratio, which yielded a VOC value of 0.88 V, a JSC value of 7.9 mA cm−2, a FF value of 0.48, and a high PCE value of 3.3% under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). These results relate to well-balanced energy levels, meaning low HOMO and LUMO levels, and good morphological properties. Compared with the other two polymers, PAFSeQ exhibited a relatively low PCE value of 1.2%, which depended on the JSC value that related its morphology and EQE value.
