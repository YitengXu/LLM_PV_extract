    , Accepted 16th May 2016First published on 27th May 2016AbstractThe efficiency of solar cells with a poor UV response can be improved by altering the incident light spectrum with luminescence down-shifting (LDS). Stable luminescent additives with a large Stokes shift, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a high absorption coefficient are required for this purpose. Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates which meet most of the basic requirements for LDS additives. Herein, commercially available heavy metal free core shell CuInS2/ZnS QDs are theoretically and experimentally evaluated as LDS additives. The small apolar dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands of the QDs are exchanged with thiol functional oligo-caprolactone ligands, via a ligand exchange process, to improve the QD compatibility with the UV curable resin matrix. Aggregation of the QDs is prevented to a large extent in the polymer–QD composite films and the material exhibits luminescence properties which are virtually identical to the luminescence of the QDs dispersed in chloroform. Raman spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy are used to elucidate the ligand exchange and ligand binding processes. It is shown that well-dispersed CuInS2/ZnS QDs are required with a near unity quantum yield to increase the efficiency of solar cells significantly especially if high performance inorganic solar cells are employed.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) cells can suffer from low external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the UV spectral region. Luminescence down-shifting (LDS) has been proposed to improve the spectral response by absorbing short wavelength UV light and emitting at wavelengths where PV cells have high EQE.1 Besides fluorescent organic dyes, down-shifting additives such as rare earth metal chelates and quantum dots (QDs) were proposed.1–4 It was also shown that efficient down-shifting additives: (i) require a near unity quantum yield, (ii) require a high absorbance in the spectral region where the cell EQE is low, (iii) require a large Stokes shift and minimal spectral overlap, (iv) emit in the region where the cell EQE is high, (v) are transparent at wavelengths where the cell has high EQE and (vi) are long term photo-stable.1,3 Fluorescent organic dyes fulfill most of the above described requirements. However, they have a small Stokes shift and consequently exhibit a large spectral overlap which results in significant re-absorption losses.1 In addition they suffer from poor photo-stability although this depends on the type of dye and matrix.5,6 Rare earth metal chelates have high PLQY but they have a narrow absorption band and an extremely low absorption coefficient and require ligands or absorbers that transfer the energy to the luminescent ion.1 QDs are inorganic semi-conductor nanocrystals with tunable optical bandgaps; they have a wide absorption band and high photo-stability.7,8 Depending on the type of semi-conductor, they suffer from a large spectral overlap and consequent re-absorption losses.1,9 QDs typically consist of toxic heavy metal containing semi-conductors such as CdSe and PdS. Recently less toxic heavy metal free QDs based on for example InP and ZnS doped with Mn or CuInS2 have been developed. As LDS additives QDs based on InP are not attractive due to the limited Stokes shift and spectral overlap.10 ZnS QDs doped with Mn and CuInS2 QDs might be useful as down-shifting additives and they are already evaluated for lighting applications.10,11 CuInS2 QDs are characterized by a large Stokes shift of 1.0–1.4 eV and emission in the 500–700 nm region.10 A PLQY of >70% was reported previously for core shell systems of CuInS2 with a ZnS shell.12–15 The wide absorption band and the large Stokes shift in combination with emission in the 500–700 nm spectral region, where most PV cells have high EQE, make CuInS2/ZnS QDs attractive heavy metal free QD based LDS additives. Polymer–QD composites of various types of QDs have been successfully prepared.4,16–20 However a common issue is the aggregation of the QDs during processing leading to a number of issues such as transmission losses due to light scattering, a red shift of the emission spectrum, a drop of the PLQY and inhomogeneous light absorption.11,19,21,22 Aggregation of QDs and matrix compatibility are highly dependent on the organic ligands that are grafted onto the surface of the QDs. Introducing other types of ligands can be done by ligand exchange processes.23,24 Commercially available ligands such as 11-mercapto-1-undecanol, thioctic acid, thiogycolic acid, 1-octadecanethiol and 1-dodecanethiol are either very hydrophilic or very hydrophobic and yield QDs which are either dispersible in polar or apolar media. However for miscibility with polymeric materials these ligands are not always satisfactory. Polymeric ligands that are intrinsically miscible with the host matrix were reported to obtain well-dispersed QDs in polymeric materials.22
In this work, we describe a method for preparing a polymer heavy metal free CuInS2/ZnS QD luminescent composite, which is prepared from commercially available QDs obtained from PlasmaChem GMBH and a UV curable aliphatic polyester-urethane acrylate resin (Neorad™ U-20-12H) obtained from DSM. The small molecule ligand 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) is compared to a synthesized oligomeric ligand to improve the QD dispersibility in the matrix. Raman and NMR spectroscopy are used to elucidate the ligand exchange and ligand binding processes. The luminescence properties of the QDs before formulation and UV curing as well as of UV cured composite film were evaluated. Moreover the obtained luminescent QD containing films were assessed as down-shifting layers for photovoltaic (PV) cells based on an experimental evaluation and based on theoretical simulations.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
All reagents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated. A photo-curable aliphatic polyester-urethane acrylate resin (NeoRad™ U-20-12H) was provided by DSM. CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs were purchased from PlasmaChem (Berlin, Germany). Sodium iodide (NaI), 11-mercapto-1-undecanol, ε-caprolactone, tin(II)octoate, sodium sulfate anhydrous, hydrogen peroxide 30% solution in water, sodium borohydride, lauryl acrylate, 2-methyl-THF, ethyl acetate, acetone, THF, sodium hydroxide, glycerol, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and dichloromethane were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Diol initiator synthesis
11-Mercapto-1-undecanol (5.02 g, 24.6 mmol) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL) to which NaI (36.0 mg, 0.24 mmol) was added as a catalyst. To the stirring solution 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide in water (3 mL) was added as the oxidizing agent. Under a slight exothermic reaction an off white precipitate formed over 15 minutes. The mixture was kept stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes after the exothermic reaction. The product was filtered off and was washed with ethyl acetate (40 mL) and water (50 mL). The white product (4.36 g, 10.7 mmol) was isolated and dried at 40 °C under reduced pressure to constant mass with an isolated yield of 87%. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 3.63 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 4H, –CH2–OH), 2.66 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 4H, –S–S–CH2–), 1.75–1.48 (m, 8H, –CH2–CH2–OH, –CH2–CH2–S–), 1.44–1.18 (m, 30H, –CH2–CH2–CH2–) ppm. 13C-NMR (300 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 63.4 (–CH2–OH), 39.6 (–S–S–CH2–), 33.2 (–CH2–CH2–OH), 30.0–29.5 (–CH2–CH2–CH2–), 28.9 (–S–S–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–), 26.1 (–CH2–CH2–OH) ppm.

2.3 Ligand synthesis
ε-Caprolactone (4.24 g, 37 mmol) was added to the diol initiator (950 mg, 2.30 mmol). The mixture was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere to 120 °C at which tin(II)octoate (3.5 mg, 8.6 μmol) was added as a catalyst. The mixture was kept at 120 °C for 1 hour for the ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. Upon cooling to room temperature the crude ligand dimer crystallized. The ligand dimer was dissolved in THF (100 mL) to which hydrochloric acid (7 mL, 0.7 mmol) was added. Sodium borohydride (250 mg, 6.6 mmol) was added in portions over 30 minutes as a reducing agent for the disulfide linkage. The mixture was allowed to react for 1 hour at room temperature after the last addition. After the reaction a solvent switch to 2-methyl-THF was made and the product was worked up by extraction with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and purified by precipitation in a methanol:water mixture (6:1). The off white product was dried under reduced pressure to constant mass (3.41 g, 3.1 mmol) and was obtained with an isolated yield of 66%. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 4.05 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 18H, –CH2–O–CO), 3.63 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 2H, –CH2–OH), 2.51 (q, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, –CH2–SH), 2.30 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 18H, –O–CO–CH2–), 1.94–1.48 (m, 42H, –CH2–CH2–CH2–), 1.48–0.93 (m, 33H, –CH2–CH2–CH2) ppm. 13C-NMR (300 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 174.0 (CO), 64.9–64.4 (–CH2–O–CO), 63.0 (–CH2–OH), 34.7–34.3 (O–CO–CH2–), 32.7 (–CH2–CH2–OH), 29.8–28.6 (–CH2–CH2–CH2–), 26.4–24.8 (–CH2–S, –CH2–CH2–CH2–) ppm.

2.4 Ligand exchange
A general procedure for the exchange of dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands with thiol functional oligo-CL ligands for CuInS2/ZnS QDs is described below. Excess ligands were removed prior to the ligand exchange procedure by two consecutive precipitations of the DDT capped QDs. Precipitations were performed by the addition of methanol to a QD dispersion in chloroform. The QD precipitate was collected by centrifugation. Typically QDs were dispersed in chloroform with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 during the procedure. For the ligand exchange QDs (30 mg) with DDT ligands were dispersed in chloroform (1 mL). In a separate vial thiol functional oligo-CL (250 mg) was dissolved in chloroform (1 mL) and was added as a whole to the QD dispersion. The mixture was heated under an inert atmosphere to reflux and the chloroform was allowed to evaporate. The remaining melt of the thiol functional oligo-CL ligand with QDs was further heated to 130 °C for 4.5 hours. After the reaction time the mixture was cooled to 60 °C and acetone (500 μl) was added, a transparent colored QD dispersion was obtained. The dispersion was further cooled down to room temperature. At room temperature the excess of the thiol functional oligo-CL was removed by consecutive precipitations with methanol. The procedure was typically repeated three times. The QD precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dried under reduced pressure.
2.5 Fabrication of down-shifting layers
QD dispersions in chloroform were mixed with the UV curable aliphatic polyester-urethane acrylate resin by placing the sample on a roller bench for 15 minutes. The homogenously mixed formulation was applied between two glass microscope slides separated by appropriate spacers to obtain the desired layer thickness. The films were cured by irradiating the sample with UV light (2.5 J cm−2), as a UV light source a Thomson UV MAG was used.
2.6 Methods
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer (Lambda 35) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Absolute PLQY measurements were performed according to the procedure described by Wilson et al.25 As an excitation source a 405 nm laser with an output power of 5 mW was used, emission spectra were recorded using an integrating sphere (Labsphere LMS-100) equipped with a CCD detector (Labsphere CDS-610). Data were acquired using the LightMtrX software package. NMR analysis was performed on a 300 MHz Bruker Avance 1 spectrometer. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed in quartz cuvettes on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS in a 173° backscatter configuration at 25 °C in chloroform. The refractive index of the QDs was set at 2, since the exact refractive index was unknown. EQE measurements were performed on a set-up consisting of the following components: a light source (Muller LXH-100), a monochromator (Newport 74000), a pre-amplifier (Stanford research systems SR570), and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford research systems SR830). Data processing was done using the software package Origin (OriginLab). The EQE was measured at an interval of 10 nm in the range of 350–1100 nm. Fluorescence lifetimes were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments Lifespec-PS equipped with a PicoQuant PDL-800-B pulsed laser. Raman measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon Horiba – LabRam confocal Raman spectrometer equipped with an Olympus BX40 microscope. As a light source a 632 nm HeNe laser was used. Optical and fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Olympus XC50) and an X-Cite series 120Q excitation source. TEM/STEM was performed using an FEI Osiris TEM operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV in the TEM bright field and STEM (HAADF) mode. Ultrathin sections were obtained at −45 °C with an average thickness of 60–70 nm. Elemental analysis for the elements C, H and N was carried out using a LECO Truspec CHN analyzer. Mass spectrometry flow injection analysis in THF was performed using a Maxis HD Q TOF mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source operating in the positive ion mode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Quantum-dot absorption and emission characteristics
CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs with an emission wavelength at 610 nm were selected as down shifting additives since most PV cells have high EQE at this wavelength. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the as received QDs was recorded and showed that the QDs absorbed below a wavelength of 600 nm with a decreasing absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength (Fig. 1). The absorption coefficient of the QDs determined at 350 nm was 5.0 cm−1 g mg−1, the extinction coefficient was obtained in this unit by expressing the QD concentration as milligram QDs per gram liquid. QDs have high molar extinction coefficients; however, expressing the extinction coefficient on a mass basis is more relevant for down-shifting additives since this is proportional to the required amount of the additive in the LDS layer. According to the Beer–Lambert law, the measured extinction coefficient of 5.0 cm−1 g mg−1 at 350 nm corresponds to a required concentration of 40 mg g−1 in the resin formulation for a 50 micron thick LDS layer with an optical density of 1. The photoluminescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1) was recorded with an integrating sphere coupled to a laser excitation source with a wavelength of 405 nm.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence emission spectra of dilute solutions of DDT and oligo-CL capped CuInS2/ZnS QDs in chloroform and of cured composite films. The absorption and emission spectra of QDs capped with DDT as well as with oligo-CL ligands are identical which suggests that the ligand exchange did not influence the light absorption and emission characteristics of the QDs. A red shift of 25 nm and significant broadening of the emission peak was observed for composite films prepared with DDT capped QDs. The broadening was attributed to the severe aggregation of the quantum dots and a consequent loss of the quantum confinement. A small 10 nm red shift of the emission spectrum and no peak broadening was observed for composite films prepared with oligo-CL capped QDs. 
The emission spectrum revealed a broad emission peak with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of >100 nm; which is typical for CuInS2/ZnS QDs.15,26–28 Previously, the broad emission peak was attributed to defect related emission.12,15,26,29,30 Emission can result from multiple luminescence decay pathways with either slightly higher energy (band edge) or lower energy (sub bandgap) states and explains the broad nature of the emission peak.27,31 However, it should be noted that no consensus has been reached about the exact decay mechanism.27
3.2 QD matrix compatibility and ligand exchange
The as received QDs were capped with apolar dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands and were dispersible in solvents such as toluene and chloroform. Upon addition of the QDs to these solvents highly colored optically clear dispersions without light scattering were obtained. Unfortunately, DDT capped QDs were not compatible with the resin formulation and formed large agglomerates upon addition to the resin formulation (Fig. 2). DDT capped QDs were not evaluated further for this reason. A ligand exchange process was explored to improve the dispersion of the QDs in the resin formulation. Commercially available ligands such as 11-mercapto-1-undecanol and lipoic acid were too polar and were as such also not soluble in the resin formulation. Since a ligand with the desired properties was not commercially available, a ligand compatible with the resin was synthesized.

The inset in image B shows a higher magnification TEM micrograph of aggregated QDs in the polymeric film. (C and D) Fluorescence microscopy and high angular annular dark field (HAADF) STEM micrographs of polymer–QD composites prepared with QDs capped with oligo-CL ligands. QDs capped with oligo-CL ligands were well distributed throughout the film, HAADF-STEM with high magnification was required to visualize the QDs, the QDs were present as small clusters in which the individual QDs could be distinguished as shown in the inset of image D. 
3.3 Ligand design and synthesis
A suitable ligand needs to be miscible with the resin formulation, have an interaction with the QD surface and be able to replace existing ligands. Oligomeric caprolactone (CL) was miscible with the resin formulation; however, as such an oligomer has no affinity with the QD surface and is not suitable as a ligand to replace DDT. As a QD binding moiety a thiol end-group was introduced to the oligomer. For the study an oligo-CL ligand with a molecular weight (Mn) of ∼1100 g mol−1 was synthesized from 11-mercapto-1-undecanol, which was used as an initiator for the ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone, in a three step synthetic approach (Fig. 3). The oligomeric ligand with an Mn of ∼1100 g mol−1 was selected to already drastically impact the properties of the QDs when only a small fraction of the ligand would bind to the QDs. In addition the relatively high molecular weight ligands might reduce the aggregation of the QDs by steric repulsion. The obtained oligomeric ligands were grafted onto the QD surface via a ligand exchange procedure (Fig. 4).

3.4 Ligand exchange, a NMR and Raman spectroscopy study
Ligand exchange was performed in a melt of the oligo-CL ligand at elevated temperature and at high concentration of the new ligand to drive the equilibrium in favor of the new ligand, according to Le Châtelier's Principle. Successful ligand exchange was achieved with conversions >80% on a molar basis, according to 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the 1H-NMR spectrum it was observed that the integral of the two aliphatic α-protons of the thiol end-group at 2.5 ppm did no longer match the theoretical amount after ligand exchange. A 2D carbon–proton (HSQC) correlation NMR revealed that the observed broad peak at 2.6–2.9 ppm was assigned to the thiol α protons of ligands that were reversibly bound to the QD surface (Fig. 5). The reversible nature of the ligand binding process explained why the integral of the peak at 2.5 ppm did not match the theoretical integral, the signal originated only from the ligand fraction in solution. From the 1H-NMR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) the ligand fraction free in solution was estimated to be around 25% while 75% of the ligands were bound to the QD surface in the NMR sample diluted with CDCl3. In addition the higher resolution of the 2D spectrum, recorded at 600 MHz, revealed two broad signals in the 2.6–2.9 ppm region and not one as previously observed in the 1H-NMR spectrum recorded at 300 MHz (Fig. S1, ESI†). The lower intensity broad signal at 2.8 ppm was attributed to DDT ligands and the higher intensity signal to oligo-CL ligands. Solid-state NMR relaxometry was applied to investigate the relaxation behavior of the oligo-CL ligand free in CDCl3 solution as well as of QDs with the oligo-CL ligands dispersed in CDCl3 (Fig. S2, ESI†). QDs with the oligo-CL ligands dispersed in CDCl3 showed a complex relaxation behavior. The decay could be fitted with a three component exponential function; the multi-component relaxation behavior was attributed to the heterogeneous mobility of ligands reversibly bound to the QD surface. Besides NMR, the Raman spectroscopy of solid QD samples after ligand exchange confirmed that the ligands were bound via the thiol functionality to the QD surface based on the absence of the characteristic Raman scattering peak of the thiol (S–H) at 2576 cm−1 and disulfides (S–S) at 526 cm−1. Other characteristic Raman peaks of the ligand, like the carbon sulfur bond (C–S) at 650–750 cm−1 and the ester carbonyl (CO) at 1721 cm−1, were present (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the thiol (S–H) peak was completely absent in the Raman spectrum, in contrast to solution state NMR which indicated 25% free ligands in solution. It is hypothesized that the ligands coordinated to the QD surface in the dry state. A shift of the equilibrium between free ligands and bound ligands might be induced during the preparation of the dry samples for Raman spectroscopy. From the above NMR and Raman spectroscopy analysis it followed that >80% of the DDT ligands were replaced with oligo-CL ligands and that the ligands were reversibly bound via the thiol functionality to the QD surface. The successful ligand exchange process resulted in drastically improved dispersion of the QDs in the resin formulation. QDs capped with oligo-CL ligands were easily dispersible in the resin formulation and optically transparent formulations were obtained and the agglomeration of the QDs was prevented also after curing of the resin with UV light (Fig. 2).

(B) Proton–carbon 2D (HSQC) correlation NMR spectrum of CuInS2/ZnS QDs after ligand exchange with oligo-CL ligands. (C) Raman spectra of the oligo-CL ligand with a thiol end-group, a ligand dimer and of QDs with oligo-CL ligands. The oligo-CL ligand and the ligand dimer served as reference compounds for, respectively, the thiol end-group and disulphide. The spectra were background corrected and normalized on the carbonyl (CO) signal at 1721 cm−1. In the inset the spectrum from 550–800 cm−1 is shown to indicate the C–S signal more clearly. 
3.5 Composite characterization
From the QD formulation with oligo-CL ligands in the resin optically transparent polymer–QD composites were successfully prepared by UV curing. The films had a high transmission outside the QD absorption region and were not light scattering (Fig. S3, ESI†). The QD distribution was assessed with optical fluorescence microscopy as well as with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). With optical fluorescence microscopy a homogenous fluorescence was observed throughout the sample (Fig. 2). STEM showed that the QDs were present as small clusters throughout the sample (Fig. 2). The slight aggregation of QDs had almost no effect on the transmittance of the film since the clusters were smaller than 20 nm, and according to Raleigh's law transmission losses in the visible light region were well below 0.2% for clusters this small. This was also confirmed by the transmittance measurement in comparison to a film without QDs (Fig. S3, ESI†).22 The fluorescence properties of the composite resembled that of the QD starting material, the absolute PLQY was unchanged at 15% while a 10 nm red-shift of the emission spectrum was observed (Fig. 1). The red shift was only observed in cured films and not after ligand exchange, the small red-shift of the emission spectrum was for this reason attributed to QD clustering in cured films as observed with STEM (Fig. 2). The absolute PLQY of 15% of the batch of CuInS2/ZnS QDs used for the evaluation was low compared to literature values where PLQY higher than 70% were frequently reported for CuInS2/ZnS QDs.12–15 We attributed the low PLQY to surface defects of the QDs which resulted in an increased number of trapped states which were prone to non-radiative recombination processes. Most importantly the ligand exchange process as well as the UV curing for the preparation of the composite films did not negatively impact the PLQY or cause a large shift of the emission spectrum. No changes were observed in fluorescence lifetime measurements of QD before and after ligand exchange as well as of the prepared composite films (Fig. S4, ESI†). The lifetime decay plots were identical and indicated that the luminescence process of the QDs was not affected by the processing.
3.6 Experimental and theoretical evaluation of the LDS layers on a PV cell
The prepared luminescent composite films were evaluated as LDS layers on top of a multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell by recording the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cell as a function of wavelength. Optical contact between the film and the cell was obtained by the addition of glycerol (n ∼ 1.47) between the LDS layer and the cell. An illustration of the QD-polymer composite on top of the PV cell is shown in Fig. 6. The results of the EQE measurement were compared to a blank measurement with a polymer film without QDs (Fig. 7). The comparison was made in this way to correct for additional reflections caused by the introduction of an extra layer on top of the bare PV cell. Unfortunately the introduction of the LDS layer resulted in a reduction of the cell's EQE in the region where the QDs absorbed light. This EQE reduction was attributed to the low PLQY of 15% of the QDs and the already relatively good UV performance of the blank cell.

 Fig. 7  EQE measurements and simulations of a mc-Si solar cell in combination with a polymer–QD down-shifting layer. Due to the low PLQY of the QD composite a reduction of the EQE was measured in the region where the QDs absorbed. Good agreement between the simulated EQE plot and the measurements was obtained.

A theoretical model to simulate the effect of LDS on the performance of the PV cell as outlined by Rothemund et al. has been applied for theoretical evaluations.32,33 A brief description of the theoretical model and related equations is given in the Section S5, ESI.† A theoretical simulation was performed which used as input the EQE of the bare PV cell, the measured PLQY (15%) and the absorption and emission spectrum of the LDS layer. Re-absorption losses were calculated to be ∼2% based on the spectral overlap of the absorption and emission spectrum and out-coupling losses were calculated for a refractive index of 1.5 which corresponds to ∼13% loss according to Snell's law (Section S5, ESI†). The outcome of the theoretical simulation matched closely the measured EQE of the mc-Si cell as illustrated in Fig. 7. It was concluded that the model was suitable for predicting the effect of the QD-composite LDS layer on the performance of a PV cell. The theoretical model was further used as a predictive tool to evaluate the effect of the PLQY (Fig. 8). The simulations showed that a PLQY > 75% was required to improve the UV performance of the evaluated mc-Si cell and that a near unity PLQY was required to increase the short circuit current of the cell. Various EQE curves obtained from literature sources, representing different PV cell types, were evaluated with the model to get an indication of the potential effect on the current of these cells, by simulating the effect of a LDS layer with CuInS2/ZnS QDs.9,34–36 The effect on the integrated current of the evaluated cell is shown as a function of the PLQY of the LDS layer (Fig. 9). The data were obtained by a full integration over the wavelength region of the cell's absorbance, as the input spectrum the AM 1.5g solar spectrum was used. The theoretical simulations, as a function of the PLQY, showed that as expected a low PLQY leads to a reduction of the integrated current of the cell. Depending on the cell type, however, an increase of the maximum current of the cell was possible with a PLQY > 50%. The absolute gain of the cells integrated current, with a unity PLQY, can be up to 0.5% for the CdTe/CdS cell and 0.4% for the evaluated CIGS cell. The evaluated perovskite and mc-Si cell could only benefit marginally even when the PLQY was assumed to be unity. From this evaluation it can be concluded that in general cell types with a poor UV performance might benefit from LDS while cells with a good UV response like recent record holding cells as reported by Green et al. will not benefit at all.37
 Fig. 8  Simulated EQE plots as a function of PLQY compared to the measured EQE of a mc-Si cell without an LDS layer. From the simulation it follows that a PLQY > 0.75 is required to improve the UV response of the cell. 
 Fig. 9  Absolute integrated current simulations for various cell types as a function of the PLQY of the CuInS2/ZnS LDS layer. 
Most cell types currently developed have already a fairly good UV performance and will consequently not benefit from LDS. It should however be noted that the potential of LDS is also dependent on the input spectrum and might be more beneficial for blue shifted spectra.
Based on the outcome of the theoretical prediction it was concluded that developing QDs with near unity PLQY is essential for their application as LDS additives for PV applications. Increasing the PLQY to the desired near unity values is challenging for CuInS2/ZnS QDs, because of the high proportion of defect-based nonradiative decay pathways.27 Currently the PLQY values for CuInS2/ZnS QDs are still far from unity, despite the fact that large improvements have been made in developing a synthetic route for CuInS2/ZnS QDs with higher PLQY.
4. Conclusions
Luminescent QD–polymer composites were prepared successfully via UV curing, and the process yielded a material with luminescence properties comparable to the starting material. The introduction of an oligomeric caprolactone ligand via ligand exchange was essential to improve the compatibility of the QDs with the resin and reduced QD aggregation in the polymer matrix. The performance of the composites as LDS layers was poor due to the low PLQY of the QDs. A large discrepancy was observed between the PLQY of CuInS2/ZnS QDs reported in the literature (>70%) and the results presented here (∼15%). Experimental results were in good agreement with theoretical simulations and from the theoretical model it followed that a near unity PLQY was required to have a positive effect on the integrated current of the evaluated PV cells. The application of CuInS2/ZnS as a down shifting additive for PV application remains limited as long as the PLQY is not near unity.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence emission spectra of dilute solutions of DDT and oligo-CL capped CuInS2/ZnS QDs in chloroform and of cured composite films. The absorption and emission spectra of QDs capped with DDT as well as with oligo-CL ligands are identical which suggests that the ligand exchange did not influence the light absorption and emission characteristics of the QDs. A red shift of 25 nm and significant broadening of the emission peak was observed for composite films prepared with DDT capped QDs. The broadening was attributed to the severe aggregation of the quantum dots and a consequent loss of the quantum confinement. A small 10 nm red shift of the emission spectrum and no peak broadening was observed for composite films prepared with oligo-CL capped QDs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (A and B) Fluorescence microscopy and bright field TEM micrographs of polymer–QD composites prepared with DDT capped QDs. Aggregation of the QDs was observed in the case of DDT ligands. The inset in image B shows a higher magnification TEM micrograph of aggregated QDs in the polymeric film. (C and D) Fluorescence microscopy and high angular annular dark field (HAADF) STEM micrographs of polymer–QD composites prepared with QDs capped with oligo-CL ligands. QDs capped with oligo-CL ligands were well distributed throughout the film, HAADF-STEM with high magnification was required to visualize the QDs, the QDs were present as small clusters in which the individual QDs could be distinguished as shown in the inset of image D.

 	Fig. 5  (A) Graphical representation of a QD after ligand exchange with oligo-CL ligands and some remaining DDT ligands. (B) Proton–carbon 2D (HSQC) correlation NMR spectrum of CuInS2/ZnS QDs after ligand exchange with oligo-CL ligands. (C) Raman spectra of the oligo-CL ligand with a thiol end-group, a ligand dimer and of QDs with oligo-CL ligands. The oligo-CL ligand and the ligand dimer served as reference compounds for, respectively, the thiol end-group and disulphide. The spectra were background corrected and normalized on the carbonyl (CO) signal at 1721 cm−1. In the inset the spectrum from 550–800 cm−1 is shown to indicate the C–S signal more clearly.

 	Fig. 7  EQE measurements and simulations of a mc-Si solar cell in combination with a polymer–QD down-shifting layer. Due to the low PLQY of the QD composite a reduction of the EQE was measured in the region where the QDs absorbed. Good agreement between the simulated EQE plot and the measurements was obtained. The measurements were performed in duplicate (open and closed symbols).	 

 	Fig. 8  Simulated EQE plots as a function of PLQY compared to the measured EQE of a mc-Si cell without an LDS layer. From the simulation it follows that a PLQY > 0.75 is required to improve the UV response of the cell.
