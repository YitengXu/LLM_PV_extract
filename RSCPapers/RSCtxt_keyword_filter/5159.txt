, Accepted 14th May 2015First published on 14th May 2015AbstractIn this paper, we introduce the sequential deposition method for enhancing the performance of nanocomposite counter electrodes (CEs) in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Here, various CEs are made by the deposition of CuS, PbS, and CuS/PbS nanocomposite layers on an FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) coated glass substrate by a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The result indicates that the efficiency of the cells with CuS/PbS CEs is enhanced by 2.65% compared with the bare CuS (0.99%) or PbS (1.47%) CEs. Also, no considerable improvement is observed for PbS/CuS CEs (1.09%), which indicates that the order of PbS and CuS deposition is critical for efficiency enhancement. Here, the efficiency of the cells with CuS/Pbs CEs was demonstrated to be systematically enhanced by one by one deposition of CuS and PbS layers (sequential deposition). Also, for the CdS/CdSe QD sensitized cells and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs, the cell performance of 3.58% is obtained which is enhanced by more than three and two times compared with the efficiency of the cells with CuS (0.99%) and PbS (1.47%) CEs, respectively. The fill factor is obtained as 0.53 which is the maximum value for CuS/PbS CEs, to our knowledge. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is performed on the QDSCs in order to understand the origin of the performance increment. The results indicate that the electron transfer resistance is reduced in the case of sequentially deposited CEs, while the series resistance is almost the same. This general study shows that the sequential deposition method could offer new opportunities for the simple fabrication of solution-processed CEs in order to make efficient QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals have recently motivated many studies as they are promising sensitizers in order to make QDSCs.1–9 In comparison to dyes, quantum dots offer interesting properties such as high extinction coefficients, large dipole moments, and tuning the light absorption spectrum through controlling their size.10,11 Lately, multiple excitons have been generated in colloidal QDs and enhanced the interest in semiconductor nanocrystals for photovoltaic applications.12,13 However, despite the advantages of QDs, the efficiency of QDSCs is still less than that of conventional DSCs.14
In the last few years, considerable efforts have been conducted to improve the performance of QDSCs by means of various strategies. For example, various structures of photoanodes are sensitized with different combinations of QDs,15–18 and redox electrolytes are prepared by various chemical compositions.19–22 Literature review indicates that, in spite of the comparable open circuit voltages23 and current densities24 in QDSCs and DSCs, their fill factor25,26 is obviously lower than DSCs.27,28
It is known that the series resistance in both DSCs and QDSCs is one of the main parameters noticeably affecting the fill factor.29 For example, the superior conductivity in the TiO2 active layer after annealing decreases the cells' series resistance and therefore improves the fill factor. In addition to the properties of the active layer, kinetics of the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface clearly affects the fill factor.30,31 Considerable charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface could increase the concentration gradients of the redox species in the electrolyte. Enhanced concentration gradient of the redox species will strongly affect the fill factor.
Currently, DSCs generally utilize Pt CEs. Pt has a considerable catalytic activity in polyiodide redox electrolytes and fill factors of more than 0.7 are usually obtained in this kind of cells.27,28 Despite the superior catalytic properties of Pt in polyiodide electrolyte, it not only has a weak catalytic activity in the polysulfide redox electrolyte, but also is chemically unstable in it. Currently, various CEs like CuS, CoS, PbS, Au, Pt, carbon nanotubes, and graphene32–36 are generally used in QDSCs. The mentioned CEs have lower electro-catalytic properties than CEs which are generally utilized in DSCs. Reviewing the literature indicates that, among the various CEs, CuS and PbS have the most catalytic activity in the polysulfide redox electrolyte.37–39 Effective CuS and PbS electrodes are normally manufactured by the chemical treatment of metallic brass and Pb substrates, respectively.39,40 These methods are not easy and cost-effective; more importantly, sealing the metallic CE with the active layer electrode which is made on the FTO coated glass substrate is a challenge, which is specially a serious problem for large scale production. Recently, CuS and PbS CEs have been deposited on FTO coated glass substrates by a simple and cost-effective SILAR deposition method; but, their catalytic activity is still less than that of chemically prepared CEs on brass and Pb metallic substrates.41,42 Recently, Eskandari et al. deposited a PbS layer on the CuS coated FTO substrates by the SILAR deposition method and enhanced the efficiency from 1.17 (CuS CE) up to 2.22% (CuS/PbS CE).43 Fill factor was improved from 0.31 to 0.41 by optimizing the number of PbS SILAR cycles; but, the efficiency and fill factor were still less than those of cells with the chemically prepared CuS and PbS CEs on the metallic substrates.
Here, CuS/PbS nanocomposite layers are deposited on FTO coated glass substrates by a novel sequential deposition method. For the CdS/CdSe QDs sensitized cells and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs, the cell performance with 3.58% efficiency (Voc = 539 mV, Jsc = 12 mA cm−2, FF = 0.53) is obtained. According to the literature, these are the maximum efficiency and fill factor which is obtained for QDSCS with the CuS/PbS CE. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is performed on the QDSCs in order to understand the origin of the performance increment. Results indicate that the electron transfer resistance is reduced in the case of sequentially deposited CEs, while the series resistance is almost the same. The present general study indicates that sequential deposition method could offer new opportunities for the easy fabrication of solution-processed CEs in order to make efficient QDSCs.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Electrode preparation
Photoanodes are made by the double-layer deposition of TiO2 pastes on FTO coated glass substrates (sheet resistance ∼10 Ω sq−1) by doctor blade method. The first transparent layer was prepared by means of a TiO2 paste with 20–30 nm hydrothermally prepared nanoparticles.44 Opaque layers, with enhanced light scattering properties, were constituted by 20–450 nm core–shell of TiO2–SiO2 nanoparticles.45 The deposited layers were annealed at 450 °C for 45 min to remove the residual contamination and obtain a good electrical/mechanical contact between the nanoparticles.
2.2 Electrode sensitization
TiO2 photoelectrodes were in situ coated by CdS and CdSe QDs, respectively. The SILAR process was carried out for CdS deposition according to a recently described method.3,46 Briefly, two solutions with Cd and S precursors were prepared. Cd2+ ions were deposited from the ethanolic 0.05 M solution of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and a 0.05 M solution of Na2S·9H2O in methanol/water (50/50 v/v) was selected as a sulfide source. TiO2 working electrodes were dip-coated into the Cd2+ precursor for 1 min, and subsequently, into the S2− solution for 1 min as well (which is called a single SILAR cycle). After each precursor bath, the photoanode was rinsed with the corresponding solvent to remove the chemical residuals from the layer and then dried by an N2 gun. The chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdSe QDs was performed according to the previously described method:41 80 mM of Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared by refluxing Se and Na2SO3 in Milli-Q water at 80 °C for 6 h with Ar flux. The chemical bath solution was prepared by mixing 80 mM of CdSO4 and 80 mM of Na2SeSO3 with 120 mM of nitrilotriacetic acid sodium salt. CdS sensitized TiO2 electrodes were put in the chemical bath solution at 10 °C for 12 h. Then, the electrodes were washed with Milli-Q water and dried using the N2 gun. Finally, ZnS was coated on CdS/CdSe sensitized electrodes by dipping the photoanode alternately into the 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions for 1 min/dip and rinsing with Milli-Q ultrapure water between the dips. It has been found that ZnS coating considerably increases the efficiency of QDSCs.47 Two SILAR cycles were used for ZnS deposition.
2.3 CEs preparation
Various structures of CEs were prepared through SILAR deposition of CuS and PbS layers on FTO coated glass substrates. Briefly, for the deposition of CuS, two solutions with Cu and S precursors were prepared. Cu2+ ions were deposited from the aqueous 0.5 M solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. Sulfide sources were the 0.5 M solution of Na2S·9H2O in methanol/water (50/50 v/v). A single SILAR cycle for CuS deposition consisted of 1 min dip-coating of the FTO coated glass into the metal precursor and subsequently into the sulfide solution for 1 min. After each precursor bath, the photoanode was rinsed with the corresponding solvent to remove the chemical residuals and then dried using an N2 gun. For the PbS deposition, Pb2+ ions were deposited from the 0.02 M methanolic solution of Pb(NO3)2·4H2O and sulfide source was the 0.02 M solution of Na2S·9H2O in methanol/water (50/50 v/v). A single SILAR cycle for PbS deposition consisted of 1 min dip-coating of the FTO coated glass into the metal precursor and subsequently into the sulfide solution for 1 min. After each precursor bath, the photoanode was rinsed by immersion in the corresponding solvent to remove the chemical residuals and then dried using an N2 gun.
2.4 QDSC preparation
The cells were prepared by bringing together the counter electrode and the sensitized electrode by means of a Surlyn spacer (thickness 30 μm) and filled with the droplet of polysulfide redox electrolyte. Polysulfide electrolyte was made from a 1 M Na2S, 1 M S, and 0.1 M NaOH solution in Milli-Q ultrapure water. Area of the cells was 0.25 cm2.
2.5 Photoanode and solar cell characterization
J–V and impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out by PGSTAT-30 from Autolab Company which was equipped with a frequency response analyzer. A 15 mV AC signal was applied and the frequency was scanned from 400 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5G, and the light power was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
Here, the photoanodes were prepared as described in the Experimental section and was the same for the cells with various CEs. SEM micrograph from the TiO2 layer on the FTO substrate is presented in the Fig. 1. The first layer with 20–30 nm particle size (Fig. 1a) was used as the transparent layer and the second layer with 20–450 nm particle size was deposited on the first layer as the scattering layer (Fig. 1b).

As can be observed in the transmission spectrum from TiO2 and TiO2 sensitized by CdS and CdS/CdSe QDs (Fig. 2), the absorption edge was shifted to longer wavelength after CdSe deposition on CdS layer, which enhanced the light harvesting in the cells.

The scheme of various CE structures and the cells' structure are represented in Fig. 3 and 4 respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 3, besides PbS and CuS CEs, nanocomposites of PbS and CuS were also prepared by the deposition of PbS and CuS layers with various combinations.

Current voltage properties of CdS/CdSe sensitized cells with various CEs: CuS, PbS, CuS/PbS, PbS/CuS, and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS is shown in Fig. 6. According to this figure, noticeable difference is observed in the current voltage properties, especially in the short circuit current densities and fill factor. In order to have more accurate comparison of photovoltaic parameters of QDSCs, solar cell parameters containing open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η) are shown in Table 1.

According to Table 1, the solar cells based on PbS CEs have more conversion efficiency (1.48%) than the cells with CuS counter electrodes (0.99%). Comparison between the cells' efficiencies with composite CE structures of CuS/PbS (2.65%) and PbS/CuS (1.09) with PbS CEs (1.48%) represented that the beneficial effect of the composite CE performance depended on the order of PbS and CuS deposition. The present results indicate that CEs with CuS as the first layer and PbS as the second one have superior properties (η = 2.65%) than the cells with PbS and CuS as the first and second layers respectively (η = 1.09%). Specifically the fill factor is enhanced from 27 to 48% by only reversing the order of PbS and CuS deposition (Table 1). Regarding the dependence of CE performance on the structure of the deposited layers, we also deposited CuS and PbS layers one by one (sequential deposition) on the FTO coated glass substrates (Fig. 3e). According to Table 1, the efficiency of the cells improved by 3.58% in comparison to the structures with the normal CuS/PbS structures with 2.65% efficiency (Fig. 3d and Table 1). This result indicated the crucial role of composite CE structures in the performance of QDSCs. Here, efficiency of the cells with bare CuS (0.99) and PbS (1.48%) CEs improved by more than 3 and 2 times just by fine-tuning the order of deposited layers in sequentially deposited CuS/PbS structures (3.58%).
Regarding the superior properties of sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs (Fig. 3d) and in order to optimize the cells' efficiency, we made various structures of CEs with the sequential deposition of CuS and PbS layers with different cycles of SILAR. Also, we altered the SILAR cycles from 2 to 12 in order to make sequentially deposited CuS/PbS structures. Fig. 7 clarifies the current voltage properties of CdS/CdSe sensitized cells with various CE structures.

According to this table, the lowest efficiency of the cells with sequentially deposited CuS/PbS layers (1.57%) is still higher than that of the cells with bare PbS (1.48%) or CuS (0.99%) CEs (Table 1). These results indicate that sequential deposition has a general beneficial effect in the performance of QDSC CEs. According to Table 2, the maximum efficiency of the cells is obtained for the cells with eight SILAR cycles of CuS/PbS CEs (η = 3.63%, Voc = 574 mV, Jsc = 12.87 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.49).
Increasing the number of SILAR cycles from 8 to 12 decreased the cell performance, and had no beneficial effect (Table 2).
The dark current density–voltage characteristic of the cells with CuS, PbS, and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs are presented in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  The dark current density–voltage characteristic of the cells with CuS, PbS and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS. 
As illustrated in this figure, the dark current density in the case of the CuS/PbS CEs is more than that of bare CuS and PbS CEs, which can be attributed to the improvement in the performance of the CuS/PbS electrode. Under a forward bias in the dark, electrons from the TiO2 layer react with SX2− ions and the consequential S2− ion are oxidized to SX2− at the CE. CEs with high catalytic properties will enhance the oxidation reaction, which subsequently will prevent the concentration depletion of SX2− near the TiO2 electrode and enhances the dark current.31,48
To further elucidate the performance of different CEs and understand the origin of the observed improvement, IS experiments were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE).
Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist diagram of symmetric cells fabricated with two identical CEs which was performed under dark conditions and zero bias.

EIS results were fitted via Zview software and using the equivalent circuit model that was proposed before and is shown in the inset of Fig. 9.49
Here Rs is the series resistance, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, CPE is the constant phase element, which substitutes the capacitor to fit the impedance data accurately, and Ws is the Nernst diffusion impedance of redox species.

According to this table, series resistance is almost the same for the CuS, PbS and sequentially deposited CuS and PbS CEs with 8 SILAR cycles (CuS/…/PbS(8 SILAR)). Rct decreases in the order of CuS/…/PbS(8 SILAR) (8.42 Ωcm2) < CuS (33.15 Ωcm2) < PbS (82.61 Ωcm2), indicating an enhanced performance on the reduction of oxidized redox species. The improvement in the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface decreases the internal resistance and concentration gradients of the redox species in the electrolyte, parameters that could strongly affect the fill factor. It can be observed that the use of CuS/PbS nanocomposites as a CE enhanced the fill factor (0.53) in comparison to the bare CuS (0.37) or PbS (0.24) CEs (see Table 1). According to the Table 3, PbS CE has a very high charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface which means the restricted charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface. Restricted charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, accumulates space charges and therefore creates s-shaped deformations in the current voltage characteristics (Fig. 6) of the cell.39,50,51 As a result, performance of the cells decreases by diminishing open circuit voltage and fill factor (Fig. 6 and Table 1) considerably.39,50,51
As it was explained before, increasing the number of SILAR cycles from 8 to 12 decreased the cell performance (Table 2). In order to understand the origin of the observed inferior performance of mentioned CEs, IS experiment were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical CE. The series resistance (Rs) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface is presented in the Table 4.

According to this table, the CEs' series resistance has enhanced noticeably through raising the number of sequentially deposited layers from 8 to 12 SILAR cycles, which could decrease the fill factor, and consequently efficiency of the cells noticeably (Table 2). Regarding the unique properties of the sequentially deposited CEs, the stability of the electrodes was also investigated under prolonged light-exposure. The photovoltaic parameters of QDSCs, containing open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and conversion efficiency (η) are shown in Table 5.

According to this table, the as prepared cell showed an energy conversion efficiency of 3.52% and efficiency decreased less than 10 percent after 72 h of light exposure (3.17%). Results indicate that cells' stability is comparable with the cells which are made by stable carbon CEs.48 According to the present results, considerable improvement in the efficiency of QDSCs, especially fill factors, is obtained by applying the sequentially deposited CuS/PbS composite CEs in the cells. From the present study, it can be concluded that the performance of the composite CEs could be simply enhanced by fine designing the structure of the deposited layers on the FTO substrate.
4. Conclusions
Here, the sequential deposition method was introduced for manufacturing CEs in QDSCs. For the CdS/CdSe QDs sensitized cells and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs, the cell performance with 3.58% (Voc = 539 mV, Jsc = 12 mA cm−2, FF = 0.53) efficiency was obtained which was enhanced by more than three and two times compared with the photovoltaic properties of the cells with CuS (0.99%) and PbS (1.47%) CEs, respectively. IS results indicated that the electron transfer resistance was reduced in the case of sequentially deposited CEs, while the series resistance was almost the same. We showed that the sequential deposition method could offer new opportunities for the simple fabrication of solution-processed CEs with considerable performance in polysulfide redox electrolytes.
