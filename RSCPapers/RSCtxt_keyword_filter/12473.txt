    , Accepted 20th March 2012First published on 21st March 2012AbstractWe report the fabrication of indoline D205 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with photoelectrochemically polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a hole conductor. Different from conventional photoelectrochemical polymerization under continuous spectral light illumination (e.g. Xe lamp), we conduct the polymerization under monochromatic light. The device performance is found to be dependent on the wavelength of monochromatic light used for the polymerization of PEDOT. Under optimized conditions, the efficiency of DSSCs reaches 7.1%, which is better than that of devices fabricated via continuous spectral light illumination. Detailed characterization of these devices with photoelectrical and impedance measurements reveals that the wavelength of monochromatic light affects PEDOT penetration into TiO2 porous electrodes and photoelectron recombination at the FTO surface. The best device performance is obtained when penetration and recombination are optimized.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low production cost, which make them a promising candidate for commercial application.1–3 Conventional DSSCs with liquid electrolytes based on the iodine/iodide redox couple have the problems of electrode corrosion and electrolyte leakage, which lead to difficulties in industrial applications. Replacing liquid electrolytes with hole transporting materials (HTMs) is one of the most promising methods to avoid these problems.4 Recently, significant research efforts have been devoted to HTM based DSSCs.5,6
Cast-evaporation7–9 and spin-coating10–15 are common methods used for assembling HTMs into nanoporous electrodes. Cast-evaporation is most widely used for inorganic HTMs, such as CuI and CuSCN, and DSSCs with these HTMs have shown the best PCE of 4.7% under one sun conditions.7 Spin-coating has been a standard process for organic HTMs. By spin-coating spiro-MeOTAD on a Y123 dye-sensitized TiO2 porous electrode, DSSCs with the highest PCE of 7.2% have recently been reported.10 Conjugated polymers have also been used as HTMs in DSSCs, which have the advantages of low cost, easy processing and tunable structures.16,17 Initial efforts on polymer HTM DSSCs by spin-coating HTMs yielded low PCEs.18,19 This is mainly due to the large size of polymers, which have difficulties in penetrating thick porous TiO2 electrodes to form effective hole transporting channels.20–24 To solve this problem, in situ polymerization of pre-penetrated monomers has been developed, which includes photoelectrochemical polymerization of 2,2′-bis(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (bis-EDOT),25–29 solid state polymerization of dibromo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene30 and UV polymerization of polydiacetylenes.31 The photoelectrochemical polymerization is a promising technique because it has advantages of long penetration depth and good interface contact.29 Although BET measurements showed that only about 20% volume of the pores was filled with the photoelectrochemically polymerized polymer, high device efficiencies could be obtained despite the low pore filling ratio.32 This also agrees with the recent report by Snaith and McGehee et al. who found that a high filling ratio was not necessary in DSSCs with P3HT as HTM.22
As the properties of penetration depth and interface contact are directly related to the photoelectrochemical polymerization, further study on the polymerization method is necessary to yield highly efficient devices. As photoelectrochemical polymerization is initiated by photo-created holes at the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dyes and the dye molecules have variable absorbance at different wavelengths, the wavelength of the illumination light should have an impact on the photoelectrochemical polymerization process. Therefore, application of monochromatic lights of different wavelengths for photoelectrochemical polymerization of HTM should affect the device performance, which cannot be achieved by continuous spectral light used in the previous reports.25–29
In this paper, we report that the wavelength of the illumination light has remarkable effects on the photoelectrochemical polymerization process, which greatly affects the device efficiency. We also demonstrate that DSSCs with PEDOT polymerized under optimized monochromatic light illumination have superior performance over that with the same HTM prepared under continuous spectral light illumination.
Experimental section
Photoelectrode preparation
The FTO glass (TEC15, LOF) was etched with Zn–HCl to prevent short circuit and then TiO2 dense film was prepared by spraying 0.2 M Ti(OPr)2(acac)2/ethanol on etched FTO/glass at 450 °C. The TiO2 paste (Solaronix T/SP) was doctor-bladed on the dense film surface. The film was sintered at 80 °C, 120 °C, 325 °C, 375 °C, and 450 °C for 20 min at each step. The film was then treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the film was immersed into a D205 dye solution (Mitsubishi Paper Mills, 0.3 mM D205 and 0.3 mM deoxycholic acid in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol, v/v = 1∶1). The films were kept for 2 h at room temperature, which was followed by rinsing with acetone and drying under nitrogen gas flow.
Photoelectrochemical polymerization
The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode and pyrolyzed Pt/FTO electrode were clipped together to assemble the thin-layer electrolytic cell. Parafilm was used as the spacer and sealant. Saturated bis-EDOT33 and 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (Aldrich) in acetonitrile solution was used as the precursor solution. The monochromatic lights were generated by a Xenon light source and a monochromator. The illumination is from the Pt/FTO side of the thin-layer cell and the photon flux density is kept at 3.5 × 1016 s−1 cm−2. The continuous spectral light comes from a xenon light source (Asahi MAX-310) equipped with a LWP-500 filter (Newport), and the light intensity is 25 mW cm−2 as reported in the literature.25–29 The polymerization lasted for 1500 seconds with the current density maintained at 10 μA cm−2. After rinsing off the residual monomers with acetonitrile and drying with N2 gas flow, the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode with PEDOT layer was treated with one drop of 25 mM lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (Fluka) in propylene carbonate (PC) solution. Then the photoelectrode was blown under strong N2 gas flow to eliminate PC solution, and clipped with the counter electrode to form DSSCs.34 The counter electrode was Au-coated FTO/glass (Asahi Glass), which was made by sputtering Au at 20 mA for 300 s (JFC-1600, JEOL).
Device characterization
The photocurrent–photovoltage measurements were recorded with the electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT30, Autolab). A solar simulator (XES-151S, San-EI Electric) was used as the light source for measuring the solar cells (<385 nm was cut off by XUL0385 filter, Asahi Spectra). The intensity of incident light was calibrated using a reference cell (OptoPolymer, ISE CalLab) before each experiment. The active area is defined by a 0.15 cm2 mask. The IPCE was measured using a 300W Xenon light source (MAX-310, Asahi Spectra) and a monochromator (TMS300, Bentham). The impedance of DSSCs was measured using an Autolab (PGSTAT30) electrochemical workstation at open circuit potential under 625 nm light illumination. The results were fitted with a transmission line model by DX element in Zview software. The illumination light was generated by a LED (LUXEON) with a SourceMeter (Keithley) as a current source. UV-vis transmittance spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2 layers were collected with a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. SEM was performed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-6700F).
Results and discussion
The mechanism for photoelectrochemical polymerization is shown in Fig. 1a. Briefly, in the first step, the electron at the HOMO level of the dye is excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. The photoelectron is then injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and collected by the FTO electrode. Meanwhile, the hole left at the HOMO level of the dye oxidizes bis-EDOT monomer and initiates polymerization.25 Photoelectrochemical polymerization was conducted in a specially designed thin-layer electrolytic cell (Fig. 1b) using an indoline D205 dye35 (Fig. 1c) sensitized TiO2 porous layer as the photoelectrode and bis-EDOT (Fig. 1d) as the monomer. The representative DSSC structure with photoelectrochemically polymerized PEDOT as the hole conductor is shown in Fig. 2. In these devices, no iodide/iodine or other redox couples were used.

Fig. 3a and b show the wavelength-dependent light transmittance and light intensity distribution of D205 sensitized photoelectrodes, respectively. For 740 nm light, the light intensity distribution is even in the 8 μm TiO2 layer, but the dye absorption is negligible. Similarly, the 670 nm light has relatively even light intensity distribution along the 8 μm TiO2 layer with 15% absorption. However, for 605 nm and 540 nm light, 90% of incident light has been absorbed at the depth of 5.7 μm and 2.2 μm, respectively, which results in the limited depth of illumination in the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer.

Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the PCE and TiO2 layer thickness in DSSCs with PEDOT as HTM, which was polymerized under different light illumination (740 nm, 670 nm, 605 nm, 540 nm and continuous spectral light). It is observed that the device performance is highly dependent on the wavelength of the illumination light used for photoelectrochemical polymerization. For the devices with PEDOT polymerized under 540 nm light illumination, the maximum efficiency is 2.9% (Table 1). Increasing the wavelength of the illumination light to 605 nm and 670 nm leads to improved device efficiency. However, further increase in the wavelength to 740 nm leads to a large decrease in device performance. The best performance is obtained for devices with PEDOT polymerized under 670 nm light illumination, which shows a PCE of 7.1% with a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 10.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 933 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76 under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 conditions as shown in Table 1. The reproducibility data are shown in the ESI† as Fig. S1 and Table S1, respectively. This performance is even better than that of DSSCs with PEDOT polymerized under continuous spectral light illumination. For devices with PEDOT polymerized under the same light illumination, the PCE first increases with increasing TiO2 layer thickness, which is followed by a rapid decrease at the higher thickness. It is noted that the optimized TiO2 layer thickness is also dependent on the wavelength. For devices fabricated with 670 nm light illumination, the optimized TiO2 layer thickness is 8 μm, which is larger than those of DSSCs with PEDOT polymerized under 540 nm, 605 nm and continuous spectral light illumination (3.0 μm, 4.1 μm, 5.6 μm). The thick dye-sensitized TiO2 layer is beneficial for large photocurrent, because it permits more light to be absorbed for generation of electricity.

To understand the limiting factors for thick TiO2 layers in devices, we further characterized a series of devices assembled under different monochromatic light illumination (740 nm, 670 nm, 605 nm and 540 nm) with TiO2 layers of 8 μm thickness. These devices are named as DSSC740, DSSC670, DSSC605 and DSSC540, respectively. Fig. 5a shows the light-to-electrical performance of these DSSCs. As compared to the performance of DSSC670 (10.1 mA cm−2, 0.76), there is an obvious decrease in Jsc and a moderate decrease in FF for DSSC605 (2.1 mA cm−2, 0.58) and DSSC540 (1.0 mA cm−2, 0.45), while only a moderate decrease in Jsc but a significant drop in FF is observed for DSSC740 (6.8 mA cm−2, 0.33). These differences demonstrate that the limiting factors for DSSC740 are different from those for DSSC605 and DSSC540.

(c) The two conductive channels in dye-sensitized solar cells. Channel 1 is composed of the TiO2 nanoparticle layer, the TiO2/PEDOT interface and the PEDOT/Au interface. Channel 2 is composed of the FTO/PEDOT interface, the PEDOT hole transporting channel and the PEDOT/Au interface. RTiO2 is the electron transporting resistance in the TiO2 layer, RCT and Cμ are the charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance at the TiO2/PEDOT interface, R1 and C1 are contact resistance and capacitance of the FTO/PEDOT interface, R2 and C2 are contact resistance and capacitance of the PEDOT/Au interface, RPEDOT is the charge transport resistance of PEDOT. 

Fig. 5b shows the current–potential measurement of DSSC740, DSSC670, DSSC605 and DSSC540 in the dark. At low bias potential, the slope of the current–potential curve for DSSC740 is steeper than those for DSSC670, DSSC605 and DSSC540. This indicates that DSSC740 has much lower shunt resistance than other devices. Previous studies have shown that the low shunt resistance could induce photoelectron recombination at the FTO surface, which led to decreases in Jsc, Voc and especially in FF.36 This result agrees with the photocurrent–photovoltage measurement of DSSC740 in Fig. 5a.
In general, DSSCs have two conductive channels, one is via a TiO2 porous layer and another is via PEDOT (Fig. 5c). At low bias potentials, the resistance of TiO2 is very large, but the resistance of electropolymerized PEDOT is always small. Therefore, the conductive channel should be via PEDOT. The low shunt resistance of DSSC740 should mainly come from the low FTO/PEDOT interface resistance, because only the low FTO/PEDOT interface resistance could lead to a low resistance channel from the FTO/PEDOT interface via PEDOT to the PEDOT/Au interface.
For photoelectrochemical polymerization, monomers prefer to be polymerized at the dye-sensitized TiO2 surface, because light illuminated dyes have abundant holes at the HOMO level to initiate the polymerization. However, for 740 nm light, the dye absorption is too small to create enough holes at the HOMO level of the dye molecules. In this case, the photoelectrochemical polymerization will partially translate into pure electrochemical polymerization. Pure electrochemical polymerization can only occur at the surface of the FTO substrate, because the TiO2 porous layer has a very large resistance. With a combination of photoelectrochemical polymerization and pure electrochemical polymerization, under 740 nm light illumination, the polymerization occurs at both TiO2 surface and FTO surface simultaneously to result in the low resistance contact between FTO substrate and PEDOT hole transporting channel. In Fig. 5b, the current–potential curves of DSSC540 and DSSC605 are similar to that of DSSC670 with excellent rectification characteristics. These rectification characteristics come from the large shunt resistance in these devices, which indicates low photoelectron recombination at the FTO surface.
To understand the remarkable difference in Jsc among different devices, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were studied, which reflected the light response of photovoltaic devices. Fig. 5d shows the IPCE spectra of DSSC740, DSSC670, DSSC605 and DSSC540, respectively. The spectrum of DSSC740 has a lower IPCE value as compared to that for DSSC670, but both spectra share a similar shape. The shape also resembles the transmittance spectrum of the D205 dye-sensitized TiO2 layer (Fig. 3a). This implies that in this case the shape of IPCE is determined by light absorption. However, for devices with PEDOT polymerized under short wavelength light illumination (DSSC605 and DSSC540), the shapes of the IPCE spectra diverge from the transmittance spectrum and the values of IPCE decrease remarkably at 500 nm–570 nm. As D205 dye reaches its absorption maximum (532 nm) in this wavelength range, the majority of photo-created electrons and holes would be located close to the FTO side of the TiO2 layer. The large distance between photo-created holes and the Au electrode makes the photocurrent sensitive to the hole-transport process. The low IPCE values at 532 nm for DSSC605 and DSSC540 imply that hole-transport from the oxidized dyes to the Au electrode is difficult in both devices.
To characterize the hole-transport in DSSC540 and DSSC605 as compared to that in DSSC670, we conducted open-circuit impedance measurement under 625 nm light illumination. By fitting the impedance spectra with a transmission line model,11,37 the hole-transport resistance of PEDOT and the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/PEDOT interface are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. A light-intensity dependent hole-transport resistance is observed for DSSC670, DSSC605 and DSSC540, which is in accordance with the previous report on spiro-MeOTAD based DSSCs.38 Under the same light intensity, the hole-transport resistance increases with decreasing wavelength of the light used for polymerization. When the hole-transport resistance increases, the holes will have more difficulties of transportation to the counter electrode and the oxidized dye cannot be reduced in time. In this case, the device performance will decrease remarkably. This agrees with Fig. 5a that the PCEs of DSSC540 and DSSC605 are lower than that of DSSC670.
 Fig. 6  The hole-transport resistance/light intensity relationship (a) and the charge transfer resistance/potential relationship (b) of the DSSCs with PEDOT as hole conductor, which was polymerized under different light illumination (red: 670 nm, blue: 605 nm and green: 540 nm). 
Previous studies show that the degree of HTM penetration is an important factor that determines the hole-transport process in DSSCs.13,22,29 D205 dye has large absorption coefficients at 540 nm and 605 nm as compared to that at 670 nm, which induce rapid decrease of light intensity in the depth direction to yield low illumination depth of the incident light (Fig. 3b). Since the density of photo-created holes is directly related to the light intensity, most of photo-created holes would be located at the outer side of the TiO2 layer (the side contact with an Au electrode) to initiate the polymerization of PEDOT. In this case, the majority of PEDOT will be formed at the outer side of the TiO2 layer, which is harmful for penetration.
The charge transfer resistance shown in Fig. 6b can be used to evaluate the recombination at the PEDOT/TiO2 interface when devices are under light illumination. For DSSC540, DSSC605 and DSSC670, at each potential, the device with PEDOT polymerized under the shorter wavelength illumination has a lower charge transfer resistance, which corresponds to a larger recombination at the PEDOT/TiO2 interface. This is in accordance with the low Voc of DSSC540 and DSSC605 shown in Fig. 5a. On the other hand, the dark current measurement is also a tool for evaluating the recombination process in devices. As the charge transfer process between TiO2 porous layer and oxidized dyes does not occur in the dark, the dark current in each device mainly reflects the TiO2/PEDOT interface contact resistance, especially at large bias potential when the resistance of the TiO2 porous layer is small. It is noted that the dark currents of DSSC540 and DSSC605 are lower than that of DSSC670 at large bias potentials (right side of Fig. 5b), which indicate larger TiO2/PEDOT interface contact resistance for DSSC540 and DSSC605 as compared to those for DSSC670. As the same dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were used in these devices, the large interface contact resistance corresponds to the low contact area between TiO2 porous layer and PEDOT. This is in accordance with the low penetration depth in DSSC540 and DSSC605. The low coverage area of PEDOT on the TiO2 porous layer will lead to the difficulty of recovering the oxidized dyes in time, which further supports the increased recombination between electrons in the TiO2 porous layer and the oxidized dye for DSSC540 and DSSC605 as shown in Fig. 6b.
The device stability was studied by illuminating a freshly fabricated DSSC670 under a LED array (LUXEON, NL98) in a N2 gas filled box. The light-to-electrical performances were measured before and after 48 hours of continuous light soaking. As shown in Fig. 7, the photocurrent did not change upon light soaking, only the photovoltage and efficiency decreased slightly from 926 mV and 7.03% to 914 mV and 6.92%, respectively. In addition, after storage of an originally made DSSC670 with 7.12% efficiency in air for five months, the cell retained an efficiency of 6.24%.

Conclusions
Iodine-free DSSCs have been fabricated using PEDOT as hole conductor prepared via photoelectrochemical polymerization under different light illumination. The device performance is found to be dependent on the wavelength of the illumination light used for polymerization. The long wavelength (740 nm) monochromatic light is weakly absorbed by the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer, which induces low contact resistance and large recombination at the FTO/PEDOT interface. In contrast, the short wavelength monochromatic lights (540 nm and 605 nm) have low illumination depth in the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer, which induces limited PEDOT penetration depth and difficulties of hole-transport. The balance between recombination and hole-transport leads to an optimized polymerization wavelength of 670 nm, which is more efficient than the continuous spectral light used in previous reports. These devices give the best PCE of 7.1% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 conditions and the large penetration depth of 8 μm, which represents a new improvement for polymer HTM based DSSCs. This study indicates that further research on assembling methods is important for efficient HTM based DSSCs.

The photoelectrochemical polymerization was performed under 25 mW cm−2 UV-filtered (>500 nm) Xe lamp illumination. After the photoelectrochemical polymerization, the porosity decreased from 0.1541 cc g−1 to 0.1226 cc g−1. We thus estimate that about 20% volume of the pores was filled by the polymer. This filling ratio is similar to that calculated by Yanagida et.al. in ref. 25.
