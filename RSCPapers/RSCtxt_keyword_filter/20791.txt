    , Accepted 14th June 2021First published on 14th June 2021AbstractCyclometalated iridium(III) complexes have been investigated as promising electron donor (D) materials in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their unique octahedral configuration for optimized morphology and their significantly long lifetimes potentially for enhanced exciton dissociation. However, the application as electron acceptor (A) materials has never been reported. In order to fill this blank, herein, two cyclometalated heteroleptic Ir complexes, TRIr and 2TRIr, based on electron donating–accepting type organic ligands with different π-conjugation lengths are reported as electron acceptor materials in comparison with their corresponding main organic ligands. The two Ir complexes exhibit suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.55/−3.47 eV and −5.44/−3.48 eV, which are ∼0.1 eV higher in the HOMO and ∼0.15 eV deeper in the LUMO than the TR and 2TR ligands, respectively. 2TRIr with extended ligand π-conjugation displays a poor triplet feature, while TRIr demonstrates obvious metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition absorption, with a triplet component photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of 85 ns in neat films. When blended with PBDB-T in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are 2–3 times higher than their relevant ligands, with values of 1.20% and 1.62% for TRIr and 2TRIr, and 0.58% and 0.47% for the TR and 2TR ligand-based devices, respectively. TRIr and 2TRIr based active layer blends exhibit poorer hole and electron mobilities, whereas compared with their relatively linear planar ligands, both of the two octahedral Ir complexes exhibit an optimized surface morphology for less bimolecular recombination and more efficient exciton dissociation, thus contributing to improved photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Heavy-metal complexes have attracted great interest in various fields, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–3 electrochemiluminescence,4–6 organic solar cells (OSCs),7–12 chemical sensors13,14 and bio-imaging.15–17 Particularly in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs), great success has been achieved in both academic and industrial communities by using cyclometalated Ir or Pt complexes as phosphorescent triplet emitters due to the full utilization of electron-generated singlet and triplet excitons.18–20 In contrast, the research on cyclometalated Ir or Pt complexes in OSCs was rather rare.21–24
OSCs are considered as one of the promising candidates to address the emerging worldwide energy crisis owing to their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight, low cost and large-area mass production. Among all types of OSCs, solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures, in which electron donor and electron acceptor materials are blended together to form an interpenetrating network in the active layer, have drawn much attention.25–27 The working mechanism of the typical BHJ OSCs can be generally divided into four photophysical steps: (1) excitons are generated through absorbing photons in the photoactive materials; (2) excitons diffuse to the interface between D and A materials; (3) charge carriers dissociated from excitons separated at the D/A interface; and (4) the free charge carriers migrate and are collected at the electrodes.28–30 Thus, one of the effective strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSC devices is to promote the exciton dissociation and charge separation. It is recognized that triplet excitons with sufficiently longer lifetime are beneficial for increasing the exciton diffusion length, which is in favor of exciton dissociation and charge separation, and consequently beneficial for the reduction of charge recombination.31,32 Nevertheless, most of the photoactive materials are purely organic compounds based on singlet excitons with a relatively short exciton diffusion length of 5–10 nm.33,34 In addition, the issue of how and to what extent do the triplet excitons influence photovoltaic performance is not clear. Therefore, it is of significant importance to investigate the triplet containing photoactive materials. One of the potentially effective strategies is to involve a heavy metal complex, which can induce strong spin–orbit coupling to convert singlet excitons to triplet state through intersystem crossing (ISC).7,35 However, in contrast to the development of D–A type polymers and fused-ring small-molecular materials, cyclometalated Ir or Pt complexes have attracted less attention.36
Early-stage work on heavy metal complexes in the field of OSCs was mainly focused on platinum–acetylide polymer donor materials in fullerene-based BHJ OSCs. However, due to the unmatched energy levels between the triplet state and charge transfer state, the utilization of triplet excitons could not be detected from a series of polymers and the PCEs of their corresponding photovoltaic devices were relatively limited.37,38 Recently, a few results demonstrated that small-molecular cyclometalated Ir complexes could be applied as potential electron-donor materials to realize a PCEs from 4–6%.7,8,11 Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the previous reports about photovoltaic Ir or Pt complexes in OSCs were completely focused on the application of electron donor materials, while cyclometalated heavy metal complexes as electron acceptor materials have never been reported.
In this work, we have for the first time designed and synthesized two cyclometalated Ir complexes as electron acceptors for OSC applications. The octahedral heteroleptic Ir complexes, namely TRIr and 2TRIr (Fig. 1), exhibited similar backbones but different π-conjugated lengths within the cyclometalated main ligands. In order to illustrate the effect of cyclometalating with a heavy metal Ir center on photovoltaic device properties, the corresponding organic ligands of TR and 2TR were also presented for comparison. When PBDB-T (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]) was employed as an electron donor material, a 2- or 3 times enhancement in the PCE was achieved from the devices based on both the cyclometalated Ir complexes compared to their relevant organic ligands, due to the stronger absorption intensity, sufficient exciton dissociation and appropriate film morphologies. Besides, by extending the conjugation through inserting an additional thiophene unit into the main ligand, 2TRIr exhibited a higher PCE than TRIr, mostly originated from its wider optical absorption and better film morphologies. Further characterization studies indicated that the exciton dissociation and charge recombination were similar for the two complex-based devices, although TRIr displayed a more obvious phosphorescence with a longer triplet lifetime approaching 100 ns, while 2TRIr exhibited only a significantly reduced lifetime of several nanoseconds. Therefore, in this work, we found that optical absorption and film morphology acted as more dominant impact factors on the photovoltaic performances instead of longer exciton lifetimes for heavy metal complex-based electron acceptor materials.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
In the two cyclometalated Ir complexes, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-pyridine was employed as the coordination part for contributing to deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels,39–41 and thiophene or alkyl-bithiophene as an electron-donating unit (D) was conjugated with an electron-accepting (A) 2-(1,1′-dicyanomethylene)-4-(3-thienylmethylene)rhodanine to ensure sufficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption in the main ligand backbones. And the widely used acetylacetonate (acac)42,43 or its tert-butyl analogue was selected as an auxiliary ligand to guarantee desirable solubility for device fabrication. The synthetic routes are shown in Scheme S1 and the detailed procedures are provided in the ESI.† Thus, two cyclometalated Ir complexes, bis[2-(5-((5-(6-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine-3-yl)-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)methylene)-3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile]iridium(pentane-2,4-dione) (TRIr) and bis[2-(5-((5′-(6-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine-3-yl)-3-octyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)methylene)-3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile]iridium(2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione) (2TRIr), were successfully synthesized. For comparison, the corresponding organic ligands of TR and 2TR were also prepared. All the small-molecular acceptors were synthesized through Knoevenagel condensation with satisfactory yields. The chemical structures of the final products were confirmed through NMR (Fig. S1†), mass spectrometry (Fig. S2†), as well as elemental analysis, and the results were in good agreement with the theoretical values.
In addition, thermal stability of the compounds was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The corresponding curves are shown in Fig. S3,† and the decomposition temperature (Td, represents a 5% weight loss) of the Ir complexes TRIr and 2TRIr was determined to be 321 and 323 °C, which were obviously lower than the values of the relevant ligands of TR (384 °C) and 2TR (384 °C), respectively.
The variations between different acceptors in spatial molecular geometries before and after Ir coordination could be illustrated by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP function and by employing the 6-31G(d) basis set. As shown in Fig. 2, both cyclometalated Ir complexes showed three-dimensional (3D) asymmetric conformations, evidently different from the almost planar structures of their corresponding organic ligands. Hence, it could be conjectured that the varied spatial configurations of the corresponding Ir complexes and organic ligands are expected to induce different morphologies in the active layer blends of OSCs. Furthermore, bearing a bithiophene unit in their backbones, 2TRIr and its parental ligand displayed relatively better coplanarity due to their increased π-conjugation extent, which might produce a more intense intermolecular interaction and π–π stacking in contrast with TRIr and TR, respectively. From the frontier energy level distributions (Table S1†), it is found that for the two organic ligands of TR and 2TR, the HOMO was spread through the whole molecular skeleton, and the LUMO was mainly distributed at the thiophene and rhodamine units, with partial distributions on the pyridine ring. However, after cyclometalating with the Ir center, the HOMO for both TRIr and 2TRIr was mainly located on the phenyl and Ir centers, respectively, with extremely gentle distribution at the pyridine ring, while the LUMO for both compounds was located on the remaining parts of the main organic ligand, with intense distribution on the strong electron accepting groups of thienylrhodamine. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels for the two Ir complexes were estimated to be similar. Differently, a mild distribution on the two strong electron-donating thiophenes for the HOMO was observed in 2TRIr, indicating its shallower HOMO levels. The HOMO and LUMO energy level predictions were in accordance with the CV measurements, as will be illustrated below.

Electrochemical and photophysical properties
The electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) were calculated from the onsets of oxidation and reduction curves against ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0), respectively. The corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. S4,† and the energy level diagrams of the photoactive materials used in this work are summarized in Fig. 3a and Table 1. All the compounds showed irreversible reduction and quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The EHOMO up-shifted whereas the ELUMO values were relatively steady with the insertion of an extra thiophene unit, and by comparing the energy levels of the organic ligand and the corresponding Ir complex, the Ir coordination synchronously led to an enhancement in EHOMO and a decrease in ELUMO. Overall, the EHOMO and ELUMO values of the four acceptors were calculated at −5.66, −5.55, −5.54, −5.44 eV and −3.32, −3.47, −3.33, −3.48 eV, for TR, TRIr, 2TR and 2TRIr, respectively. It is worth noting that the EHOMO/ELUMO values of TRIr and 2TRIr were relatively lower than most cyclometalated Ir complexes reported so far, thus they were more suitable for application as electron acceptor materials in OSCs, which was rarely reported before.36 Moreover, when PBDB-T was selected as the electron donor material, the EHOMO/ELUMO energy offsets of each donor:acceptor blends were sufficient for efficient exciton dissociation.44

To illustrate the optical absorption properties of the PBDB-T polymer donor and the four acceptors (TR, 2TR, TRIr and 2TRIr), the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the corresponding compounds in the film state and dilute CHCl3 solution were characterized. As shown in Fig. 3b, the four acceptors possessed an absorption capacity ranging from 350–600 nm. And the polymer donor PBDB-T could fill up the blank in the wavelength of 600–700 nm to provide complementary absorption. Among the four acceptors, 2TR and 2TRIr demonstrated a wider absorption range than TR and TRIr in both solution and film states, which were ascribed from their enhanced π-conjugation. More specifically, due to the stronger ICT transition induced by bithiophene than single thiophene, 2TR and 2TRIr possessed wider and red-shifted absorption profiles compared to TR and TRIr in both solution and film states, with absorption peaks located at 480 and 491 vs. 439 and 444 nm in dilute CHCl3 solution and 510 and 503 nm vs. 440 and 446 nm in neat films, respectively. Moreover, both 2TR and 2TRIr exhibited significantly red-shifted absorption features in film than in solution with longer wavelength π–π* (ICT) transition peak shifts for 30 and 12 nm, respectively, whereas negligible changes were observed in TR and TRIr, which further confirmed that enlarged π-conjugation resulted in a more intense intramolecular π–π interaction.
It is interesting that cyclometalation with the Ir center exhibited different phenomena on the absorption profiles between the two cyclometalated main ligands and their corresponding Ir complexes owing to different π-conjugation lengths. Normally, the cyclometalated Ir complex-based triplet emitters, which were widely reported in PHOLEDs, demonstrated two obvious longer wavelength absorption bands, with a more intensive shoulder peak, attributed to a singlet state metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition (1MLCT) and even longer wavelength tails attributed to a triplet state metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition (3MLCT) and/or a triplet ligand-centered (3π–π*) transition.45,46 It is observed that compared with the TR ligand, TRIr showed an obvious extra longer wavelength absorption tail for 1MLCT/3MLCT, while the characteristic absorption for 1MLCT/3MLCT nearly vanished in 2TRIr with an additional thiophene in the main ligand, which was possibly contributed by the extended π-conjugation in the 2TR main ligand, weakening the heavy-metal effect of the Ir center. In contrast, the broad longer wavelength absorption bands in the film state for 2TR ligand even demonstrated a bathochromic shift compared with 2TRIr, which is probably ascribed to the intermolecular aggregation, owing to its considerably planar geometry, as shown in Fig. 2b. The absorption coefficients of the different PBDB-T:acceptor blends are demonstrated in Fig. 3c. As shown, all the blended films exhibited a broad absorption in a wide range of 350–700 nm. Among these blended films, PBDB-T:2TRIr exhibited the most favourable absorption properties with an abundantly increased absorption intensity than the other systems in the range of 345–390 nm and 465–700 nm. As a result, the 2TRIr-based devices were expected to obtain higher photocurrent and better photovoltaic performance.
Generally, the main organic ligand normally exhibits a higher energy singlet emission with a photoluminescence (PL) decay lifetime of about a few nanoseconds. After coordination to the heavy-metal Ir center to largely enhance the spin–orbital coupling, an efficient inter-system crossing (ISC) process which converts singlet state excitons to triplets occurs, and thus a lower energy phosphorescent triplet emission with a dramatically longer microsecond-scale PL decay lifetime is achieved. For the heavy metal complex-based emitters in PHOLEDs, the ligand fluorescence emission is normally suppressed due to the strong spin–orbit coupling, and the phosphorescence mostly exhibited by the feature of 3MLCT and/or triplet state ligand centered (3LC) emission.47 However, these phenomena are found to be not universal or even quite different in cyclometalated heavy metal complex based organic photovoltaic materials, particularly in this work. The PL spectra of the ligands and cyclometalated Ir complexes in the film state are shown in Fig. 4a. The neat film of TR displayed a broad PL spectrum from 530 to 770 nm with a strong peak at 590 nm. Unexpectedly, 2TR with longer wavelength absorption revealed a remarkably hypsochromic PL in the range of 480–700 nm, and the emission peak was also blue-shifted to 522 nm. Different from their parental organic ligands, the corresponding PL spectra for the cyclometalated Ir complexes exhibited two emission peaks, which were located at 720/820 nm for TRIr and 615/780 nm for 2TRIr. Such evidently separated double-modal PL profiles were possibly attributed to the reduced ISC rate by expanding the conjugated size and enhancing the D–A interaction in the main ligand, leading to an incomplete eliminated ligand fluorescence at a short wavelength and rather weak phosphorescence at lower energy, respectively.
 Fig. 4  (a) PL spectra of the four acceptors in films and (b) the corresponding transient PL decay curves excited at 440 nm under ambient conditions for TR and 2TR were recorded at 600 and 530 nm, respectively, for TRIr at 820 nm, and for 2TRIr at 780 nm. Inset: enlarged images of the short-lifetime compounds. 
To gain deep insight into the effect of cyclometalation with the heavy metal Ir centre, time-resolved transient photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed to study the excited-state exciton lifetime of the corresponding acceptors. The specific transient PL decay curves are displayed in Fig. 4b, and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown, both of the organic ligands exhibited overall short PL decay lifetimes of <1 ns, as a consequence of the single fluorescence emission feature. In contrast, the cyclometalated Ir complex of TRIr showed typical triplet-state phosphorescence emission characteristics with a significantly long lifetime of 84.9 ns accounting for a proportion of 94.3% when recording at the 820 nm shoulder peak, which was in agreement with the obvious 1MLCT/3MLCT absorption tails. However, 2TRIr demonstrated a relatively weakened metal-participated emission with a significantly reduced PL decay lifetime of 13.2 ns in a ratio below 50% when recorded at 780 nm. The unexpected PL decay for 2TRIr might be ascribed to the fact that the extended π-conjugation in the main ligand with a strong intramolecular D–A interaction to reduce the spin–orbit coupling with the heavy metal Ir centre leads to a significantly weakened 1/3MLCT interaction. On the other hand, the nearly planar structure of the 2TR ligand within the 2TRIr complex might cause intensified bimolecular triplet–triplet annihilation and aggregation quenching for a promoted non-radiative rate.11
Considering the influence of triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) and aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) on the luminescence characterization for these heavy-metal complexes, doped films by dispersing 30 wt% of acceptors into the organic m-TPA-o-OXD host matrix were established.7,48 Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of phosphorescence by O2, the PL spectra of the doped films under an ambient atmosphere and under a N2 atmosphere were simultaneously measured. The excitation wavelength was selected at 440 nm according to the absorption spectra of the acceptors and m-TPA-o-OXD. As shown in Fig. S5a,† different from the neat films with sharp non-continuous fluorescence and phosphorescence emission profiles, broad emission with a mixed fluorescence and phosphorescence feature was observed in the doped films under degassed conditions for the two cyclometalated Ir complexes, with peaks at 653/730 nm for TRIr and 595/727 nm for 2TRIr. However, when measured under an ambient atmosphere, the intensity at longer wavelength shoulder emission for the two Ir complexes was significantly reduced, and particularly almost vanished for 2TRIr, which was ascribed to the decreased intensity of 3MLCT or 3LC emission through quenching the triplet-state excitons by O2.49 In contrast, it was similar to the intensity feature in the PL spectra for the four compounds at higher energy under a different atmosphere, which was attributed to the strong ligand-centred singlet emission. Besides, in the doped films mentioned above (Fig. S5b†), the lifetimes recorded at 730 nm were noticeably decreased from 34.8 and 15.7 ns in N2 to 5.4 and 2.8 ns in air for TRIr and 2TRIr, respectively. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the lower energy emissions were oxygen sensitive and belonged to the triplet-state phosphorescence characteristics.
Photovoltaic properties
For the first time, to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the cyclometalated Ir complexes as electron acceptor materials in organic solar cells, solution-processed OSCs with a BHJ device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated, where ITO and Ag served as the cathode and anode, respectively, and ZnO and MoO3 were used as the cathode and anode interface layer, respectively. The widely reported polymer donor, PBDB-T, which provided complementary absorption and matched energy levels, was employed as the electron donor material. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves under an illumination of 1 sun (simulated AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) and representative external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for different PBDB-T:acceptor blends are shown in Fig. 5 and the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The average PCE was recorded from more than 12 independent devices, and the detailed fabrication processes of OSC devices are summarized in the ESI.†

Firstly, two organic ligands were employed as acceptors, affording rather unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance from the corresponding OSCs. The devices based on TR exhibited a maximum PCE of 0.58%, corresponding to an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.08 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.29, respectively. On the other hand, from the devices based on 2TR, which possessed extended π-conjugation in the molecular backbone, relatively lower photovoltaic properties with a PCE of 0.47%, a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 1.71 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.30 were acquired. Secondly, single-component OSCs with PBDB-T as unitary photoactive materials were synchronously fabricated and 0.09% PCE was yielded. The obviously higher PCE with enhanced photocurrent obtained for the two organic ligands compared to the single component PBDB-T indicated that TR and 2TR certainly served as electron acceptors when blended with PBDB-T, and the poor performance could possibly be attributed to their insufficient light-harvesting ability, poor charge transport and undesirable morphological parameters, as will be discussed below.
Moreover, in order to investigate the effect of coordination on photovoltaic performance, the OSCs based on cyclometalated Ir complexes were successfully fabricated. Both Ir complexes showed 2–3-fold improvement in the photovoltaic performance compared to their parental ligands, revealing the promising potential of cyclometalated heavy metal Ir complexes in the application of small-molecular electron acceptors. The variations in the photovoltaic performance of the two Ir complexes upon different active layer thicknesses are summarized in Tables S3 and S4,† and the most appropriate thicknesses were optimized as 71.1 and 63.6 nm for TRIr and 2TRIr, respectively. More specifically, a PCE of 1.20% was obtained from the PBDB-T:TRIr devices, with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 3.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.37, respectively. As for 2TRIr, further improved performance was achieved with a maximum PCE of 1.62%, Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 5.02 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.35, respectively. It is noted that molecular stacking which affects the morphological behavior of the active layer is strongly dependent on the molecular geometry of donor and acceptor materials. As reported in our previous work on organometallic small-molecule donor materials, both neat film and the blended film with PC71BM for the octahedral heteroleptic Ir complex demonstrated more suitable film morphologies than the linear organic ligand in organic photovoltaics, therefore the PCE was greatly improved from ∼0% for the ligand to 3.8% for the Ir complex.7 Hence, similarly in this work for the two Ir complex acceptors, it could be inferred that the improved FF might be attributed to their octahedral geometries for a more proper morphological behavior with appropriate donor:acceptor interactions in the active layer blends.
In addition, by simultaneously comparing the OSCs based on Ir complexes and their relevant ligands, it can be found that the improvement of photovoltaic properties originated from the enhancement in Jsc and FF. Within the BHJ structure, normally, the exciton diffusion length (LD) is positively correlated with the exciton lifetime, as illustrated in the formula , where D reveals the exciton diffusion coefficient of the specific material and τ is the exciton lifetme.36 Thus, if the exciton lifetimes were long enough to support them to transport the sufficient range without being trapped or annihilated, more excitons would diffuse into the donor and acceptor interfaces, further promoting the exciton dissociation rate and boosting the photovoltaic performance.36 However, in this work, the cyclometalated Ir complex, 2TRIr, which exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, displayed a drastically weakened longer PL decay lifetime (τ2 = 13.2 ns, 46.8%) than that of TRIr (τ2 = 84.9 ns, 94.3%). Therefore, the longer exciton lifetime is not a dominant impact factor in the photovoltaic performance between the two Ir complexes.
In this case, by comparing the photovoltaic performance of the four acceptors, instead of the effect of exciton lifetime, the optimization of absorption properties reasonably served as one of the main influencing factors for the obviously increased Jsc in 2TRIr-based devices. In particular, in contrast to the TRIr-based OSCs, the EQE curve (Fig. 5b) for the devices with 2TRIr as the acceptor showed an obviously enhanced photoresponse in a broad range from 348 to 680 nm, which was also consistent with its strong UV-Vis absorption characteristics. Therefore, the improved photovoltaic performance in OSCs based on the Ir complex than the main ligand counterparts indicated that the photovoltaic properties of OSCs could be improved by a cyclometalated coordination approach with the heavy metal Ir(III) center, which afforded a promising strategy to construct electron acceptor materials. Overall, concluding from the results from the absorption and photoluminescence studies, it can be inferred that the highest PCE of 2TRIr-based OSCs was mostly determined by appropriate light-harvesting ability and/or morphological parameters, rather than a longer exciton lifetime.
Carrier dynamics
Generally, the long exciton lifetime of the heavy metal complex was regarded as a favorable factor to facilitate exciton dissociation and suppress charge recombination in the BHJ-structured active layers due to the sufficient diffusion length of long-lifetime triplet state excitons.9,11 However, comparing the two Ir complexes, although TRIr exhibited a much longer exciton lifetime than 2TRIr, the correlated photovoltaic performance was not improved as expected. It is suggested that carrier dynamics including charge dissociation, recombination and transfer played a significant role in influencing the photovoltaic performance in OSCs. Accordingly, in order to gain a deep insight to illustrate the relationships between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance, a combination of characterization studies was carried out.
Firstly, charge mobilities of the corresponding devices were characterized by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method.50 The hole-only devices in the structure of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron-only device with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al were fabricated several times for the hole and electron mobility measurements. The relevant J–V curves fitted by the SCLC method are depicted in Fig. S6,† and the corresponding mobilities are summarized in Table 2. The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the devices for the polymer donor PBDB-T blended with the acceptors of TR, 2TR, TRIr and 2TRIr were calculated to be 6.48 × 10−6/9.64 × 10−6, 6.48 × 10−6/4.78 × 10−5, 1.10 × 10−6/4.23 × 10−6 and 1.39 × 10−6/3.12 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is found that the extra electron-donating thiophene in the cyclometalated Ir complex 2TRIr significantly reduced the electron-mobilities compared with its corresponding analogue of TRIr. On the other hand, decreased μh and μe were obtained from the cyclometalated Ir complex based devices, in contrast to the control organic ligands. It is unexpected that the 2TRIr-based blends demonstrated the lowest μe, whereas displayed the best photovoltaic performances. It should be noted that the very poor electron mobility in the 2TRIr blends partly correlated to the reduced proportion of the electron acceptor material in the corresponding blended film. The decrease in the charge mobilities, which was irreconcilable with the promotion of the photovoltaic performance for the Ir complex-based devices, was possibly attributed to the effect of asymmetric 3D-octahedral geometries of the Ir complexes on the intermolecular stacking. Therefore, it was necessary to further investigate the reason for the PCE improvement of the devices with cyclometalated Ir complexes.
In addition, the charge recombination in OSCs with different acceptors was measured by assessing the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity. In detail, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) was represented by using the formula Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where the exponential α reveals the degree of bimolecular recombination, with α = 1 corresponding to negligible bimolecular recombination in the OSCs.51,52 As shown in Fig. 5c, they were all linearly correlated between Jsc and Plight with an α value of 0.96, 0.93, 0.97 and 0.97 in the devices based on TR, 2TR, TRIr and 2TRIr, respectively. Among the four acceptors, 2TR exhibited the most unfavorable case of bimolecular recombination, which was in agreement with its worst PCE. Furthermore, α values of 0.97 for the TRIr- and 2TRIr-based devices indicated that bimolecular charge recombination could be further suppressed by the introduction of heavy metal coordination.
On the other hand, PL quenching measurements were further conducted to characterize the charge transport properties in different PBDB-T:acceptor blends to achieve a better understanding of the varied photovoltaic performance. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the PL spectra of the PBDB-T neat film and related four PBDB-T:acceptor blended films were measured. According to the absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), in contrast to nearly no absorption of four acceptors, PBDB-T exhibited a prominent absorption peak above 600 nm; thus, 630 nm was selected as the excitation wavelength to detect the charge transport properties from the donor PBDB-T to the acceptors. The neat film of PBDB-T exhibited a broad PL profile from 600–850 nm with an emission peak at 720 nm. When introducing organic ligands as electron acceptor materials, the PL intensities of the blended films based on TR and 2TR showed a decline with a quenching efficiency of 26.5% and 50.5%, respectively. It should be noted that, although 2TR exhibited improved charge transfer than TR, the insufficient absorption properties and serious charge recombination resulted in the decrease of photovoltaic performance. On the other hand, after cyclometalation in the octahedral heteroleptic Ir complexes, the PL quenching efficiency significantly enhanced than that of the organic ligands, with 82.1% for TRIr and 85.7% for 2TRIr-based blends. The results revealed that the charge transfer from PBDB-T to the cyclometalated Ir complexes was more efficient compared to their parental organic ligands, indicating that more photo-induced excitons were dissociated in the organometallic systems. More specifically, PBDB-T:2TRIr blend demonstrated the highest PL quenching efficiency, which was in good agreement with its best performance among the four acceptors. In a word, the characterization of charge dynamics illustrated that less bimolecular recombination and optimized charge dissociation were detected from the devices based on Ir complexes. Moreover, efficient charge transfer was also concluded as one of the conclusive reasons for the disparities in the photovoltaic performance among the four acceptors.
Film morphology
Furthermore, surface morphologies of the corresponding neat films and blended films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to illuminate the variance in charge dynamics and photovoltaic performance among the four acceptors. The organic ligands were detected first. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the neat films of TR and 2TR both displayed flawed and rough surfaces. Sizeable aggregations and large-scale domains could be clearly observed due to the excessively strong crystallinity induced by their rigid coplanarity. In contrast, relatively smooth film surfaces were detected from the neat films of the cyclometalated Ir complexes. The obvious disparities illustrated that Ir coordination could adjust the molecular aggregation properties. The 3D asymmetric geometries greatly relieved the excessive crystalline intensities of their parental ligands, which would be beneficial for achieving a suitable size of pure acceptor domains and appropriate donor:acceptor phase separations.53,54 As for the blended films based on the main ligands, involving PBDB-T led to relieved aggregation and relative smoother surfaces compared to the relevant neat films. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 6j and n ascribed to the undue planarity of the 2TR ligand, excessive aggregation and overlarge domains could still be discovered from the PBDB-T:2TR blends, which were reasonable for the worst PCE of the relevant devices. In the meantime, different from their very smooth neat films, when mixed with PBDB-T with semi-crystalline properties, the blend films of the two Ir complexes became relative rougher, as is evidenced by the increased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values from 0.674 to 2.583 nm for TRIr and 0.588 to 1.961 nm for 2TRIr, indicating that the blend morphologies of the Ir complex were mainly dominated by PBDB-T. These emerged aggregations might be responsible for guaranteeing an efficient charge transfer from the linear polymer donor PBDB-T to the octahedral-structured Ir complexes.55–57 Synchronously, a slight aggregation would lead to the formation of proper phase-separated networks for the Ir complex-based blends, which is beneficial for improving exciton dissociation, suppressing charge recombination and thus achieving improved photovoltaic performance.58,59

Conclusion
In conclusion, for the first time, we have designed and synthesized two octahedral heteroleptic cyclometalated Ir complexes as potential electron acceptor materials for OSCs. It has been found that when blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T, the devices based on the two Ir complexes synchronously demonstrated better photovoltaic performances than their corresponding pure organic ligands, and this superiority was mainly reflected in the enhancement of Jsc and FF owing to enhanced optical absorption and significantly improved film morphologies. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved upon 2TRIr with extended conjugation in the main ligand. Although 2TRIr possessed a relatively lower electron mobility and significantly weakened triplet excited state exciton lifetime compared to its TRIr counterpart, the best PCE of 2TRIr was reasonably contributed from the increased optical light absorption, improved film morphologies and more effective exciton dissociation. Our work revealed cyclometalating photoactive organic ligands with the heavy metal Ir center to form octahedral geometries provides a potential design strategy for electron acceptor materials in organic solar cells. Meanwhile, to some extent, the nearly invisible MLCT absorption and extremely weakened triplet lifetime for 2TRIr induced by the considerably planar main ligand with a strong D–A interaction subverted the knowledge on phosphorescent cyclometalated heavy metal complexes. Further investigation on photoactive heavy metal complexes with high optical absorption organic ligands is underway.
