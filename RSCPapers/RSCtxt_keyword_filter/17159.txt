    , Accepted 20th February 2021First published on 23rd February 2021AbstractWe report the colloidal synthesis of quaternary kesterite CZTS–CZTSe heterostructures via anion exchange reactions on a kesterite CZTS template. The crystal phase selectivity during the synthesis (kesterite vs. wurtzite) is due to the initial nucleation of cubic Cu9S5 seeds, followed by incorporation of Zn and Sn. Upon injection of Se-precursor, which triggered simultaneous anion exchange and overgrowth of the pristine CZTS template, sandwich CZTS–CZTSe (core-tip) nanoheterostructures were obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical band gap measurement results suggest a change of intrinsic electronic structure of CZTS by Se-treatment. Our study not only provides insight into mechanisms of formation of kesterite CZTS nanocrystals (NCs) and subsequent anion exchange reactions, but also opens doors to access novel CZTSSe nanostructures for potential applications.
Introduction
Copper-zinc-tin-sulphide-selenide (Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x, CZTSSe) has drawn attention as a promising, earth-abundant, non-toxic alternative to CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS) and CdTe as a light absorbing material for thin-film solar cells.1–6 CZTSSe is a direct band gap semiconductor, with a band gap of 1.0–1.5 eV, an optimal range for use as an absorber in a single-junction photovoltaic device.7,8 Photovoltaic devices using CZTSSe directly deposited from hydrazine have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.6%, which is becoming competitive with other thin film solar cells.9–13 CZTSSe photovoltaics produced from copper zinc tin sulphide (CZTS) nanoparticle inks with post-treatment using Se vapor have reached a PCE of 9.0%.14–19 Direct use of CZTSSe nanoparticle inks could, along with other developments in processing, eliminate the separate selenization step and reduce cost and environmental impacts of production.
Synthesis of CZTSSe NCs were recently reported by injection of S–Se precursors into metal–organo complexes.20,21 Compared to other polymorphs (stannite and wurtzite), kesterite is the best candidate as an absorber in thin film solar cells, because of its optimal band gap, maximum absorption and high electron–hole-pair generation.22,23 In a study by Yang et al., the NC products were in the wurtzite phase, but underwent a phase transformation to kesterite after sintering. These devices had lower PCE compared to devices formed from kesterite NPs.24 However, direct synthesis of pure kesterite CZTSSe nanoparticles is challenging because of the minimal energy barrier and energy difference between the polymorphs.23 Moreover, the mechanism of phase-selectivity to kesterite is unclear. Therefore, a clear mechanism for robust synthesis of kesterite CZTSSe is needed.
In this work, we synthesized kesterite CZTS–CZTSe nanoheterostructures by a hot-injection colloidal method. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of kesterite CZTSSe NCs using an anion exchange approach. The template kesterite CZTS NCs were formed by incorporating Zn and Sn into Cu9S5, followed by Se–anion exchange reaction from both tips of the overgrown CZTS. Optical absorbance (optical band gap) measurements and XPS results suggest that the intrinsic electronic structure was affected by Se-treatment. We believe this approach can enable creation of novel CZTSSe-based heterostructures for photovoltaics and other applications.
Results and discussion
Kesterite CZTS NCs can be obtained by injecting sulphur precursors into a metal precursor mixture at elevated temperature. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image in Fig. 1a shows that these CZTS NCs have an average diameter of 9.8 ± 1.1 nm. Size distribution histograms of this and other samples are provided in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The lattice spacing of 1.9 Å observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1b corresponds to (220) planes of CZTS. Scanning TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) elemental maps in Fig. 1e and Fig. S2† indicate the colocation of Cu, Zn, Sn and S signals, confirming the formation of a homogenous quaternary phase, whose composition is Cu2.20Zn0.82Sn1.14S4.00, based upon SEM-EDS analysis (Table S1†). On the other hand, we also observed some polycrystalline particles with multiple domains. Fig. 1c shows an example of a triple-domain particle with two parallel grain boundaries. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) reveals that the particle has two sets of FFT spots, while the three domains share the same (11) spots. Based on the FFT filter analysis (Fig. S3†), the top and bottom domains almost share the same orientation. The middle domain, which connected both top and bottom domains through their (11) planes, corresponds to a 36.6° rotation from top and bottom domains (inset of Fig. 1c and Fig. 3e). More examples of such multi-domain NCs, which all share the same epitaxial growth behaviour along (112) planes, are provided in Fig. S4.†

Separation of nucleation and growth phases is much more difficult in the quaternary compounds than in the binary ones.25 Most metal chalcogenides can crystallize in both wurtzite- and zinc blende-type polymorphs, and the energy difference and barrier between them are usually low.25 The overlapping nucleation window (e.g., similar nucleation temperature) leads to simultaneous production of both polymorphs, separated by stacking faults and grain boundaries.26–29 Moreover, the hexagonal packing of the atoms in (112) planes of the zinc-blend structure allows many kinds of stacking faults or polytype domains, which may be exacerbated by the added strain due to the imperfect stoichiometry of the structure.26,29 Multiple tools have been applied to understand the formation, atomic arrangement, and generation of defects in these structures.25,30 As the current synthesis exclusively produces kesterite (zinc blende-type) phase, understanding of its formation mechanism can be highly instructive.
To reveal the growth mechanism of CZTS NCs and understand the phase selectivity toward kesterite, we studied the reaction intermediates by extracting aliquots at different reaction times. As indicated by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. S5 and S6,† we detected metallic Cu, SnO2 and ZnO NCs as solid products in these aliquots. Because metallic Sn and Zn NCs are very easily oxidized in air during sample handling, additional analysis is needed to understand the initial form of these NCs in the solution. The reduction potential of these three metal ions ranks as Zn2+ → Zn (−0.76 V) < Sn2+ → Sn (−0.14 V) < Cu+ → Cu (+0.52 V).31 This indicates Cu+ ions were reduced to metallic Cu prior to injection of sulphur precursors, while Zn2+ ions could maintain their oxidation states. Experimentally, we also found Sn2+ was oxidized to Sn4+ (SnO2). These observations are supported by the previous report that Sn2+ and oleylamine (OAm) could behave as mild reducing agents.32,33 Moreover, the reducing potential of OAm should be weaker than Sn2+ (−0.14 V). Lattice spacings observed in HRTEM images in Fig. S6b–d† further suggest the formation of isolated metal/metal oxide NCs and not bimetallic (e.g., Cu–Sn or Cu–Zn) structures, consistent with the XRD pattern. In contrast, if the system initially existed as metallic Sn or Zn and then oxidized to SnO2 and ZnO, we should be able to track some metal/metal oxide interfaces in core@shell or dimer heterostructures,34–37 rather than homogeneous and defect-free metal oxide NCs (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the reaction mixture at elevated temperature most likely contained Cu, ZnO, and SnO2.
Upon injection of S-precursor, a mixture of kesterite CZTS, cubic digenite Cu9S5, SnO2, and ZnO were quickly formed, as revealed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 2a. Extending the reaction time led to the conversion of other phases into CZTS NCs, indicated by reduced peak intensities for those phases. These ex situ measurements do not allow us to capture the initial nucleation stage of the reaction, but the formation of Cu9S5, which is the only metal sulphide observed (other than CZTS), illustrates the strong affinity of Cu–S bonding and suggests that cubic Cu9S5 could act as the template for uptake of Sn4+ and Zn2+ ions to yield kesterite CZTS.

(b) TEM and (c–e) HRTEM images of reaction intermediates obtained 30 s after S-precursor injection. (f) Comparison of structural models between digenite Cu9S5 and kesterite CZTS. Note that the cubic Cu9S5 digenite may have Cu atoms distributed among 8c sites with partial occupancy. Here we set the Cu atoms in Cu9S5 to full occupancy for presentation purposes. The scale bar in panel (b) is 50 nm and those in (c)–(e) are 5 nm. 
We can gain insight into the mechanism of formation of kesterite CZTS NCs using HRTEM imaging and structural models. The intermediate extracted 30 s after S-precursor injection shows that the reaction initially yielded three types of products: sub-5 nm nanospheres, ∼10 nm nanoplates, and nanorods. Based on the TEM imaging in Fig. 2b–e (30 s) and Fig. S7† (2, 5, and 10 min), the three products are identified as CZTS, SnO2, and ZnO NCs, respectively. Although it distinguishing CZTS and Cu9S5 phases is difficult because of their similarity in lattice spacings, we believe the initially formed Cu9S5 NCs should exist as nanospheres and act as the template for accepting Sn4+ and Zn2+ ions, as the lattice spacing and atomic arrangement for NCs with other shapes are exclusively assigned to SnO2 and ZnO. As the reaction proceeded, nanospheres grew at the expense of other products (nanoplates and nanorods), producing more uniform and phase-pure CZTS NCs (Fig. S8†).
All the cations in both Cu9S5 and CZTS unit cells are tetrahedrally coordinated. The sulphur atoms in both structures are in a square array, as viewed along a- and a-/c-axis, respectively. The distance between neighbouring sulphur atoms are 2.72 Å in CZTS, which is only 2.3% smaller than the corresponding distance in Cu9S5 (2.78 Å). Moreover, the lattice constants for kesterite CZTS are akest = bkest = 5.43 Å; ckest = 10.85 Å, which corresponds to two Cu9S5 unit cells (adig = 5.56 Å), overlaid along the adig-axis. These features allow transformation from Cu9S5 to CZTS with minimal changes in the sulphur framework, which not only facilitates uptake of Zn and Sn but also helps to preserve the NC morphology.38,39 As we did not detect any ZnS or SnS/SnS2 in either HRTEM imaging or XRD patterns, we conclude that CZTS NCs are formed by incorporation of Zn and Sn into Cu9S5 templates. The observation of sequential nucleation and growth also explains the formation of linear heterostructures.
Pristine CZTS NCs served as a template for subsequent anion exchange. The TEM image in Fig. 3a reveals the ellipsoidal morphology of Se-treated NCs, whose overall size is larger than that of the pristine CZTS NCs. The ellipsoidal product NCs have average dimensions of 15.2 ± 2.0 and 23.6 ± 2.7 nm along short and long axes, respectively (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 3b and S9,† HR-STEM images reveal that the NCs are sandwich-like heterostructures. Based on the lattice spacings of (200) planes for the center region (2.7 Å) and tip regions (2.8 Å), the nanoheterostructures have a CZTS core and two CZTSe caps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of nanoscale colloidal CZTS–CZTSe heterostructures. The formation of heterodomains was also supported by the FFT filter analysis provided in Fig. 3d and S10.† During the anion exchange process, S atoms in the NCs were gradually replaced by Se atoms, and the larger size of Se atoms expanded the lattice, producing the observed shift of the diffraction peaks to smaller angle (Fig. 3e, e.g., (112), (220), and (312)). Although the peaks for (200) planes, whose lattice spacings were observed in the HR-STEM image, were relatively weak, they did not shift to lower angle, and even the line shape was unchanged. This reflects the fact that the CZTSe domain grew from the CZTS domain through anion exchange reaction along (200) planes, where the atomic rearrangement is minimal.

(e) Comparison of XRD patterns of CZTS and CZTS–CZTSe NCs. The scale bar in panels (a–c) are 100, 5, 10 nm, respectively. 
STEM-EDS mapping further reveals that the S signals are concentrated at the center of NCs while Se signals are located at both tips (Fig. 3c and S11†). Cu and Sn are distributed throughout the entire NCs, while Zn signals are relatively weak on both tips, suggesting these CZTSe domain could be Zn-deficient. In contrast to an immiscible crystal boundary, which is commonly observed in metal chalcogenide heterostructures,38,40–42 we observe a diffusion layer between the CZTS and CZTSe domains. The lattice spacings and imaging contrast in the diffusion layer, which has a considerable amount of both anions (Fig. 3c and line scan profiles in S12†), are different from those in core and tip domains. This observation shows that Se ions can coexist with S ions in the kesterite structure, producing an intermediate in the conversion from CZTS to CZTSe. Strictly speaking, the NCs can be considered CZTS–CZTSSe–CZTSe nanoheterostructures. Such a structure containing quaternary and quinary phases with partial anion exchange from S to Se, can potentially provide an electronic structure that promotes electron–hole separation in solar cell devices.13,43,44 Further studies aimed at tuning the anion exchange ratio (CZTS:CZTSe) and corresponding solar cell device fabrications and testing are currently ongoing to gain deeper understanding of the relationship between the electronic structure and device performance for this novel nanomaterial.
Based upon TEM images of reaction intermediates like those shown in Fig. S13,† the monodispersed CZTS NCs tended to merge into larger NCs quickly after the Se-precursor was added (30 s). Prior to anion exchange, the incoming Se2− can adsorb on the surface of CZTS NCs, and then partially displace the pristine OAm ligands.45 Such ligand replacement can trigger aggregation of NCs, consistent with previous reports.46,47 In addition, we observed the reaction yielded some small particles, whose population increased as the larger NCs grew. During this process, active Cu-, Zn- and Sn-species could form by partial decomposition/dissolution of the CZTS NCs. Consequently, the larger NCs grew into ellipsoidal NCs by consuming most of the small particles as the reaction proceeded. This Ostwald ripening process is driven by the difference in surface energy between large and small particles.48 Meanwhile, Se atoms started replacing S atoms from the tip of the NCs. The observation is consistent with observations for other metal chalcogenide systems in which ion exchange occurs preferentially on high curvature regions, low index facets and where surface atoms have low coordination (e.g., edges), as these sites intrinsically have lower energy barriers for the exchange reaction.49–51 The regio-selectivity of ion exchange reactions has been used as a robust method for creation of programmable semiconductor heterostructures.38,40–42 SEM-EDS results show that there were only 1.9 and 3.1 at% of Se incorporated into the particles after 30 s and 2 min of Se-injection, respectively (Table S1 and Fig. S13†). This also supports our proposed mechanism that the overall reaction involved coalescence of CZTS NCs and a subsequent Se exchange process. Ellipsoidal CZTSSe alloy NCs have been observed elsewhere, though they contained a cubic CZTSSe core and two wurtzite CZTSSe tips.20,21 In that case, the CZTSSe system preferentially adopted an ellipsoidal morphology due to its intrinsic crystal structure, although the formation mechanism differs from the present study.
XPS spectra of the NCs before and after anion exchange were used to further understand the unique heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 4a, Cu 2p spectra reveal that copper before and after Se-treatments was present solely as Cu(I); no Cu(II) satellites were observed.52 After anion exchange, the binding energies of the Cu 2p peaks shifted to slightly lower binding energy (∼0.3 eV). This is expected, as S ions in the pristine CZTS lattice were replaced by Se ions with lower electronegativity.6,53,54 Similar shifting (0.3–0.4 eV towards lower BE) of XPS peaks was observed in Sn 3d and Zn 2p spectra. As shown in Fig. 4d, most sulphur was present as S2− prior to Se-exchange, but di- or poly sulphide impurities are also likely to be present. We note that deconvoluting the S 2p spectrum for post-treated NC is difficult because of the interference from Se signals (∼160.0 and ∼166.0 eV), while the line shape and downshifting of the spectrum are consistent with the observations for cations. Fig. S14† presents the XPS spectrum in the Se 3d region, indicating dominance of Se2− with very minor di- or poly selenides. In all, the XPS analyses suggest the electronic structure of CZTS was altered by the anion exchange reaction.

The optical bandgap of the CZTSSe NCs can be estimated from a Tauc plot of (αhν)2versus hν (where α is absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy).55,56 For CZTS NCs, as shown Fig. S15† and Fig. 4e, the NCs obtained after 30 s and 2 min show plasmonic absorbance near 1600 nm and 1300 nm, and optical band gaps of 2.42 and 2.33 eV, respectively. The plasmonic feature also confirms the fact that p-type Cu-deficient Cu9S5 NCs were formed at the initial stage of the reaction, rather than stoichiometric Cu2S, which would not exhibit this feature. The as-synthesized CZTS NCs have a band gap of ∼2.0 eV, which monotonically decreased with increasing reaction time after Se-injection, except that a small increase in band gap (2.04 eV to 2.10 eV) was observed immediately following Se-precursor injection, which could be related to a change in the size or surface charge of the NCs. The final CZTS-CZTSe heterostructures show the narrowest band gap of 1.67 eV. This value is slightly larger than pure CZTSe NCs (1.0–1.5 eV), because of coexistence with more CZTS in the composite (∼75% based on EDS results) with wider band gap. The Se-treatment-induced reduction of band gap is consistent with prior experimental and theoretical reports.57–60
Conclusions
In summary, we have produced a previously unavailable CZTS–CZTSe heterostructure via anion exchange. Initially, we produced CZTS in the kesterite via nucleation of a cubic digenite Cu9S5 template followed by Zn and Sn incorporation. Subsequent Se treatment triggered both overgrowth and anion exchange processes on the CZTS template, producing CZTS–CZTSe sandwich structures. We showed that the incorporation of Se can influence the intrinsic electronic structure by continuously narrowing the band gap. These observations and discussion can inspire new designs for novel CZTSSe nanomaterials for photovoltaics and related applications.
Experimental
Chemicals
Copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99.995%), oleylamine (OAm, 70%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), sulphur powder (S, 99.98%), and selenium powder (Se, 99.99%), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac)2, 99.995%), and tin chloride (SnCl2, reagent grade 98%), were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals were used as received.
Preparation of OAm/TOP–Se precursor
As previously reported,61,62 we first dissolved 2 mmol of Se powder in 1 mL of TOP by sonication and stirring at room temperature under nitrogen until a clear solution formed. Then, to prepare TOP/OAm–Se precursor, 1 mL OAm was added into the TOP–Se solution and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes.
Preparation of OAm–S precursor
The OAm–S precursor was prepared in a manner similar to our previous reports.61,62 Briefly, 2 mmol of S powder was added into 2 mL of OAm, heated to 130 °C, and held for 3–5 minutes to form a clear red OAm–S solution.
Synthesis of CZTS NCs
In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol CuCl, 0.5 mmol Zn(acac)2, and 0.5 mmol SnCl2 powder were mixed with 10 ml OAm. The mixture was held under vacuum at 110 °C for 30 min and then heated to 200 °C under nitrogen. The colour of the mixture turned from transparent to golden, indicating formation of organo–metal precursor complexes. The temperature was further increased to 225 °C, followed by injection of 2 mL of OAm–S precursor. After injection, the temperature was held for 30 minutes. To collect the NCs, 10 mL of ethanol was added, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min. To purify the NCs, the NCs were redispersed in hexane, then ethanol was added, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min.
Synthesis of CZTS–CZTSe NCs through anion exchange
For synthesis of CZTS–CZTSe heterostructures, after the crude reaction mixture for synthesis of CZTS NPs was held for 30 min, 2 ml of OAm/TOP–Se precursor was injected in the CZTS NP reaction mixture at 225 °C. The temperature was held at 225 °C for another 30 min. To collect the NCs, 10 mL of ethanol was added, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min. To purify the NCs, the NCs were redispersed in hexane, then ethanol was added, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min. The NCs were dispersed in hexane at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 for subsequent characterization.
Characterization
TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. HRTEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, HR-STEM images, and STEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) maps were collected using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F STEM equipped with spherical aberration correctors on the image at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. TEM grids were prepared by dropping a dilute NC dispersion onto a carbon-coated copper or gold TEM grid and allowing the sample to dry under air. Size distributions were obtained from TEM images by measuring at least 200 NCs from multiple TEM images from different areas of the grid, using Nanomeasurer ver. 1.2. XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray source. Samples were prepared by drop-casting concentrated NC dispersions onto glass slides. Elemental analysis of NCs by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 within a Zeiss Auriga scanning electron microscope (SEM). XPS were acquired on an ESCALAB 250Xi with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) with nominal spot diameter of 400 μm. The pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained below 5 × 10−8 mbar. Optical extinction of NC dispersions was measured using a Shimadzu 3600 UV–visible–NIR spectrophotometer.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Low-magnification (a) and high-magnification (b) TEM images of CZTS NCs. (c) HRTEM image of triple domain CZTS nanoparticle. The inset shows an illustration of orientational relationship among three domains. (d) FFT patterns of overlay, domain I (red), domain II (green), and domain III (blue). (e) STEM-EDS elemental maps for panel (b). The scale bars in panels a–c and e are 50, 2, 3, and 5 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of products in aliquots extracted at the indicated times after S-precursor injection. (b) TEM and (c–e) HRTEM images of reaction intermediates obtained 30 s after S-precursor injection. (f) Comparison of structural models between digenite Cu9S5 and kesterite CZTS. Note that the cubic Cu9S5 digenite may have Cu atoms distributed among 8c sites with partial occupancy. Here we set the Cu atoms in Cu9S5 to full occupancy for presentation purposes. The scale bar in panel (b) is 50 nm and those in (c)–(e) are 5 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) TEM image of CZTS–CZTSe heterostructures. The red, green and blue regions are CZTS, CZTSe and a CZTSSe diffusion layer, respectively. (b) HR-STEM image, (c) STEM-EDS elemental maps, and (d) corresponding FFT pattern of CZTS–CZTSe NC. A magnified FFT is provided as an inset in panel (d). (e) Comparison of XRD patterns of CZTS and CZTS–CZTSe NCs. The scale bar in panels (a–c) are 100, 5, 10 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–d) High-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d, and S 2p regions for CZTS NCs (red) before and (blue) after Se-treatment. (e) Plot of the band gap evolution with the chalcogenide precursor injection and reaction time.
