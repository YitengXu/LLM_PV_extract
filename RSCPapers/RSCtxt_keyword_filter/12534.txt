    AbstractThe past ten years have witnessed the development of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, which have emerged as an attractive renewable energy source in response to rising energy costs and environmental pollution. In such a solar cell, charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface is a crucial aspect that significantly affects overall device efficiency. Therefore, the choice of these two components and their design are important factors for the optimization of plastic solar cells (PSCs). This feature article correlates the performance of the device to the active layer composites, analyzing the motivations behind specific BHJ designs. Several low-bandgap polymers are described based on their different donor–acceptor units and their influence on both the optical absorption and the electrochemical properties. As for the accepting materials, we examine the effect of chemical functionalization in a series of fullerene derivatives, carbon nanotubes and non-fullerene based compounds on their performances in PSCs. The understanding of film-morphology control is also briefly discussed.Fulvio G. BrunettiFulvio G.

1. Introduction
Up to the second half of the 20th century, semiconductors, metallic conductors, superconductors and magnets were the purview of inorganic chemistry and solid-state inorganic chemistry only. The first organic semiconductors with respectable dark conductivity were reported in the 1950s1,2 and were inspired by the discovery of the transistor and the ensuing advances in condensed matter theory.2 In 1964, William Little published his paper on the possibility of excitonic superconductivity,3,4 a publication that inspired a whole generation of organic and organometallic chemists. In quick succession advances were made from semiconductors to metals and superconductors, with full attention to the latter, while the emphasis on semiconductor properties were essentially abandoned. The emphasis was also on small molecule molecular solids until Labes re-examined polythiazyl [(SN)x], an inorganic polymer, and found it to be a metallic conductor5 as well as superconductor.6 Labes' research inspired MacDiarmid and Heeger to carry out further characterization of this unusual macromolecular solid.7 Their work, in turn, prompted Shirakawa to inform MacDiarmid of his advances in acetylene polymerization that led to films with metallic luster akin to aluminium foil. The ensuing collaboration resulted in a number of landmark publications,8 ultimately leading the Chemistry Nobel Committee to award the 2000 prize to the three scientists. It was not until Cambridge University's Richard Friend's group reported on light emission by a polymer (PLED),9 clearly a semiconductor property, that the paradigm of the day shifted from emphasis on metallic conductivity back to evaluating the semiconductor properties of organic materials. This seminal publication led to the investigation of field-effect transistors (FET) of thiophene discrete oligomers by Garnier.10 Almost concurrent with Garnier's investigations, the fullerenes were made in bulk by Kraetschmer and Huffman,11 the soccer ball-shaped molecules adding a new kick to the superconductor properties of molecular solids and ultimately bringing us to the subject of current intense research and this review, organic photovoltaics (OPV).
Throughout part of the period discussed above (1960s–2009), the discovery of the conductivity of TTF (tetrathiafulvalene) salts,12 the contributions to PLEDs through MEH-PPV (poly[1-methoxy-4-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-phenylenevinylene])13 and to OPV through the advent of PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)14 were some of the contributions from transparent interdisciplinary research. With the latter two, the stage was set for the genesis of the solar cells.
2. Concepts
2.1 Organic metals

2.1.1 Intramolecular charge mobility. 
From the beginning, research centered on π-bonded aromatic molecules. The idea was that 1) π bonds are more polarizable, 2) π bonds are delocalized,15 and 3) the π–π* energy gap is significantly smaller than the corresponding σ–σ* gap. Of course, with the exception of cyanine dyes, open chain and non-aromatic extended π-bonded systems are relatively unstable and for that reason were, very likely, not investigated as intensely as the aromatic and particularly heteroaromatic molecules. The protagonist in the genesis of organic molecular conductors was the aromatic hydrocarbon perylene in the form of iodine charge-transfer complexes.14 In all these cases, it was understood that the radical ion components of these salts were fully delocalized through throughout the perylene molecule's HOMO. Though some polymers were investigated they were poorly characterized.2 A few decades later, the most magnificent example was polyacetylene. It was expected, and was found, to be very reactive in view of the fact that as small an oligoene as octatetraene is unstable at room temperature. Yet, the polymer, while reactive, is thermally very stable in the solid state. To observe conductivity in this solid, there had to be extensive intramolecular delocalization of charge along the macromolecular π-molecular orbital.


2.1.2 Intermolecular charge mobility. 
The evolution of organic metals and superconductors led to the paradigm of the day that in order to transport charge through an organic metal or superconductor, one needed very tight intermolecular π–π interactions with shorter than van der Waals intermolecular distances in the π–π stacking direction. In addition, the chief requirement was “mixed valence”, neutral and charged open shell (radical ion) molecules of the same compound making up the π–π stack.16–18 The closer the ratio to 1:1, the closer the solid was to a metal-insulator transition. The pure radical ion stack was predictably an “insulator” (conductivity <10−6 S cm−1) at room temperature.2 The concept of mixed valence was also applied by Kivelson to explain the conductivity of doped polyacetylene.19 The desired radical ions could be generated by charge-transfer (CT) in donor acceptor (DA) complexes or electrochemically to introduce a closed shell counterion (e.g., BF4−, I3−, N(Me)4+, Li+, etc.).
In “modern” organic electronics, the charge carrying species are expected to be essentially nonexistent in the dark but are generated either as one to a few monolayers in FETs or by photoinduced CT in photovoltaics.

2.2 Bulk-heterojunction solar cells
As stated above, current research in organic electronics has been focused on the development of plastic photovoltaics that offer the advantage of deposition on lightweight material by high-throughput production.1,20–23 The photovoltaic effect in the active layer is built on the diffusion of an exciton at the donor/acceptor interface by a precise sequence of events:24 1) excitation of the donor upon absorption of light, 2) energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor component with dissociation of the exciton and formation of a positive charge (hole) on the donor and negative charge on the acceptor and 3) migration and collection of the charges at the corresponding electrodes (Fig. 1).25
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the charge transfer in a BHJ device.25 
In general, the performance of a photovoltaic cell, in terms of efficiency (η), is calculated using the following eqn (1):26 (1)where Jsc (short circuit current) is the maximum current when the voltage across the device is zero. Voc, the open circuit voltage, is the maximum voltage when the current is zero and depends on the donor-HOMO and acceptor-LUMO energy levels as well as on the electrode metal work function. The FF, defined in eqn (2), is the fill factor, while Pin is the incident light power density, standardized at 1000 W m−2. (2)Vmp and Jmp are the voltage and the current density, respectively, at the maximum theoretical power point.
The choice of the components in the active layer as well as its morphology are crucial factors that govern the physical interaction between the donor and acceptor, affecting the whole photocurrent process. In this review, the discussion is focused on organic materials for application in plastic solar cells and recent advances directed towards their synthesis and device performance. In the first part we will focus on semiconducting polymers and in particular on recent developments in the synthesis of low-bandgap conjugated polymers. The second section describes different accepting compounds based on n-type polymers, carbon nanostructures and non-fullerene π-conjugated derivatives.
3. Donor polymers
The following part describes a non-exhaustive collection of the most significant polymers that have been designed and synthesized for solar cell applications, including poly(3-alkylthiophenes) P3AT, low-bandgap materials and block copolymers.
3.1 Polythiophene based polymers
At present, one of the most studied and well-suited donor polymers is regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT)27,28 that forms a polycrystalline structure through self-assembly, giving rise to high charge carrier mobility. BHJ solar cells made of rr-P3HT and PCBM reached a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 5.0%27,39,40 with external quantum efficiencies of around 88%.28–32 Over the last few years, several research groups have put considerable efforts into optimizing the performance of rr-P3HT:[C60]PCBM solar cells by controlling a variety of parameters. Table 1 summarizes the properties of a collection of efficient photovoltaic cells based on rr-P3HT:[C60]PCBM blends.33 In terms of weight ratio, the optimum has been achieved using a proportion of 1:1 and the best solvent for this blend is ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB). Moreover, device-annealing treatments seem to be a basic process for enhancing efficiency.

In addition to this, it is not surprising that the P3HT's stereospecific bonding (regioregularity) plays an important role in polymeric conductivity and charge carrier mobility. The most stable photovoltaic performance is obtained with the highest molecular weight and regioregular rr-P3HT.34 The conductivity of rr-P3HT (doped with I2) was 100–200 S cm−1 compared to only 0.1–1 S cm−1 obtained for P3HT with a low regioregularity (58–70% HT).35 McCullough's36 and Rieke's37 are among the best synthetic procedures to obtain P3HT with regioregularity of 99% HT and 98.5% HT, respectively.35–38 Regioregular P3HT with 96% HT has also been synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization.39 However, little work has been directed on other poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3AT) which differ in the length of the alkyl chain; some examples are poly(3-butylthiophenes) P3BT, poly(3-pentylthiophenes) P3PT, poly(3-octylthiophene) P3OT and poly(3-dodecylthiophene) P3DDT. Generally, the length of the alkyl chain does not affect either the location of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels, or the optical absorption. The Voc slightly increases with chain length while the Jsc and FF reach a maximum with P3PT and P3HT. In fact, very recently, P3PT has been demonstrated to behave like P3HT under the same experimental conditions, proving to be a competitive polythiophene.40 Longer alkyl chains, in the case of P3OT and P3DDT,41 mainly lower the mobility and facilitate the phase separation thanks to the diffusion of PCBM in the active layer.
The average band-gap of P3AT is around 1.9 eV and the absorbance is limited to within 650 nm. P3AT can absorb only 46% of the available solar photons and only in the wavelength range between 350 and 650 nm.42 This limitation in the absorption is primarily due to confined spectral breadth rather than absorption coefficient. The motivation behind the development of polymers with an optical absorption that extends into the near-infrared is to exploit the low energy photons available in the solar spectrum.
3.2 Low-bandgap polymers: a structural consideration
Various factors can influence the bandgap of conjugated polymer materials including bond-length monomer alternation, aromaticity, π-conjugation length, intermolecular interactions and intra-chain charge transfer. Stabilization of quinoid character in the conjugated system can also efficiently reduce the bandgap. Polymerization of isothianaphthene (benzo[c]thiophene) produced a polymer poly(isothianaphthene) (PITN) that exhibited a bandgap of ∼1 eV, representing a classical example of a narrow-bandgap polymer with an essentially quinoid ground state.53 Another proven strategy to reduce the bandgap of π-conjugated materials and possibly enhance the photocurrent is to incorporate electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units in an alternating fashion in a polymer chain.32,54,55 The D–A systems are expected to exhibit partial intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) that enables manipulation of the electronic structure (HOMO/LUMO levels), leading to low-bandgap polymers56 with relatively high charge carrier mobility.57–60
The common D moieties are thiophene, alkylthiophene, carbazole, fluorene, silicon- or carbon-fused bithiophene while A moieties are usually benzothiadiazole, thienopyrazine, substituted-benzo-dithiophene and diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole (DPP).

3.2.1 Recent advancement. 
Very recently, Yang and Wu fabricated polymer solar cells with high open circuit voltage and efficiency thanks to a careful molecular design based on a “step-by-step approach”. In fact, a poly[4,8-bis-substituted-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-4-substituted-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT)-derived polymer61 was modified by the substitution of the alkyloxy group with an alkyl chain and by the introduction of a fluorine atom in the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit. After these modifications, PBDTTT-CF (Fig. 2) maintained either the original bandgap of 1.77 eV or the broad optical absorption with edges around 770 nm, as a result of the simultaneous lowering of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels.
 Fig. 2  Molecular structure of PBDTTT-CF. 
Due to the particular location of the LUMO, the Voc was maximized to 0.76 V, using [C70]PCBM as the accepting component, while the small bandgap and the wide absorption allowed a Jsc of ca. 15 mA cm−2. Regarding the PCE, the authors claimed a promising 7.7% efficiency, certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, encouraging a probable future commercialization.62


3.2.2 DPP containing polymers. 
Diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole (DPP) containing polymers are another class of narrow-bandgap polymers whose structure is built on the DPP as electron poor unit.63 Janssen et al.64 synthesized a poly[3,6-bis-(40-dodecyl-[2,20]bithiophenyl-5-yl)-2,5-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (pBBTDPP2), a polymer that contains the DPP electron poor unit and quaterthiophene as electron rich moiety. This conjugated material exhibits an optical bandgap of 1.4 eV and an optical absorption of 720 nm in chloroform. A further red shift up to 860 nm was observed by dissolving the sample in oDCB instead of chloroform. The authors attributed this shift to the formation of aggregates, even at low concentration. Due to the tendency of pBBTDPP2 to aggregate, solar cells were fabricated only after optimizing processing parameters. The blend solutions of pBBTDPP2 with [C70]PCBM and [C60]PCBM, respectively, were prepared in oDCB and heated to 170 °C. In order to avoid aggregation, the mixture was sonicated during cooling and a stable suspension was formed. Due to the wider optical absorption of [C70]PCBM, solar cells containing this higher fullerene derivative achieved a PCE of 4% compared to only 3% with [C60]PCBM.


3.2.3 Benzothiadiazole-based polymers. 
Bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DBT) is the most popular A moiety that has been combined with several donating moieties such as fluorene (PFDTBT,65 PFO-DBT66), carbazole (PCDTBT67) as well as dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silol (PSBTBT68), sila-fluorene (PSiF-DBT69), 2,5-bis(2-thienyl)-N-dodecylpyrrole (PTPTB70), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (PDTPDTBT71) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (PCPDTBT42). The structures of these copolymers are depicted in Fig. 3. The resulting copolymers showed high power-conversion efficiency (PCE), up to 5.4%65–67,72,73 The collection of polymers in Fig. 3 was assembled to show improvement of device performance as a function of polymer design. To start, Hashimoto and coworkers synthesized a low-bandgap polymer (PDTPDTBT, Fig. 3)74 based on N-substituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and benzothiadiazole. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.00 and −3.43 eV, respectively, were determined by cyclic voltammetry with an electrochemical bandgap of 1.57 eV. Broad absorption with peaks at 451 and 697 nm were observed in the solid state and the calculated optical bandgap (1.46 eV) differs only a few mV from the electrochemical value (1.57 eV). The BHJ device, fabricated with PDTPDTBT:[C60]PCBM (1:1, w/w), showed a Voc of 0.52 V, a Jsc of 9.47 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.44 with a power conversion efficiency of 2.18% (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2).
 Fig. 3  Benzothiadiazole-based polymers. 
PCPDTBT42 was designed by the substitution of the nitrogen atom in the dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole D moiety with a carbon atom and by removing the thiophene rings from the PDTPDTBT structure. Though the optical bandgap of PCPDTBT (1.45 eV) is similar to that of PDTPDTBT, the 1:1 PCPDTBT:[C60]PCBM blend performed better, with a PCE of 2.7% against 2.18% for PDTPDTBT.
PCPDTBT:[C70]PCBM BHJ solar cell (1:1, w/w)42,75 was also investigated, achieving an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 3.5%, despite a low fill factor of less than 50%. The main reason for this increased performance was attributed once again to the wider optical absorption in the visible region of C70 relative to that of C60.
In addition to the choice of the acceptor component, the performance of plastic solar cells could also be significantly affected by the morphology of the bulk heterojunction,30,76 which ensures maximum exciton dissociation at the interface and efficient charge-carrier extraction.30,76
By adding 2.5 vol% of 1,8-octanedithiol in the chlorobenzene cast solution, the power conversion efficiency of the PCPDTBT:[C70]PCBM solar cell increased from 2.8% to 5.5% (air-mass 1.5 global conditions).77
The use of high boiling point additives during the film deposition is a method that potentially enables film control where thermal annealing is either undesirable or ineffective.
Yang and coworkers68 added a new member PSBTBT to this series of polymers by substituting the carbon atom in the cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene with a silicon atom. The electrochemical band-gap of this silole-containing conjugated polymer PSBTBT is 1.78 eV, higher than that of the carbon analogue but with an optical bandgap of 1.45 eV, essentially that of PCPDTBT. The FET hole mobility increased to 3 times that of PCPDTBT.78 Out of 100 BHJ devices fabricated with PSBTBT-[C70]PCBM (1:1, w/w), an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.7% was observed and for the best device, a PCE of 5.1% was obtained under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The EQE of the devices measured in air was ∼43% with a Voc of 0.68 V, a Jsc of 12.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55%.
A similar improvement in efficiency was observed with the silicon for carbon substitution in fluorene-DBT based PFDTBT copolymers reported by Cao and coworkers69 for the alternating copolymer PSiF-DBT (Fig. 3). Both PFDTBT and PSiF-DBT polymers exhibit a bandgap of ∼1.8–1.9 eV but the latter showed a FET hole mobility of −1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 10 times higher than its carbon analog. A PCE of 5.4% was observed with a BHJ device fabricated with copolymer PSiF-DBT:PCBM (1:2, w/w) with a Voc of 0.90 V, Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.50 (AM 1.5 G, 800 W m−2), compared to a PCE of only 2.4% observed with the carbon polymer. The same group synthesized79 a series of copolymers PFO-M1, PFO-M2 and PFO-M3 (Fig. 4) based on fluorene/benzothiadiazole and thiophene units and studied the influence of the nature and the position of the alkyl chain of the thiophene ring in the polymer's repeating units on the photovoltaic performance. As expected, absorption spectra of these polymers were red shifted by 30–40 nm in comparison to PFO-DBT due to longer overall conjugation length. But a PCE of 2.63% was observed in the case of PFO-M3, which is slightly better when compared to that of PFO-DBT.

Cao and coworkers reported a promising low-bandgap conjugated analogue (poly[5,7-bis(4-decanyl-2-thienyl)thieno[3,4-b]diathiazole-thiophene-2,5] (PDDTT), where a benzene ring was replaced by a thiophene,80 with a spectral response extended to the near infrared region. The molecular structure of PDDTT is shown in Fig. 5. Unfortunately, the photovoltaic performance based on the PDDTT/PCBM blend showed a PCE of only 0.11%. One obvious problem is the low Voc (0.3–0.35 V) due to the higher HOMO. Although the solar cell efficiency of this polymer:PCBM blend is very low, this polymer has shown promising results application in a near-IR photodetector device.81

3.2.4 Pyrazine-based polymers. 
Thienopyrazine (TP) is another promising acceptor unit. The advantage of TP over benzothiadiazole is the modification of the pyrazine ring while introducing steric effects remote to the conjugated chain. The copolymer based on thienopyrazine and thiophene is another example of the alternation between aromatic and quinoid units, which results in a low-bandgap polymer. Several different thienopyrazine copolymers66,82,83 have been prepared and tested in solar cells such as PTHTP,84 PBTHTP, PB3OTP, APFOGreen851, 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 6). Depending on the side chains of the aromatic rings, the copolymers of thiophene–thienopyrazine were reported to have bandgaps in the range of 1.10–1.60 eV. However, the thienopyrazine-based copolymers are less studied in comparison to benzothiadiazole-based copolymers. Also these systems (Fig. 6) have uniformly produced low-to-fair PCE devices.38,86–90

3.3 Block copolymers
Some efforts have been directed toward the design of self-assembling block copolymers, combining donor chromophores and fullerene-functionalized blocks.91,92 In particular, rod-coil diblock polymers, compared to random, homopolymer or alternating polymers, are able to self-assemble in nanostructures, generating nanoscale domains, a fundamental parameter of BHJs.93,94
Fréchet et al. employed a diblock copolymer either as an active layer in BHJs or as a lowering interfacial agent. The diblock copolymer was synthesized by incorporating a P3HT macromonomer as the chromophore block and a homopolymer with a high fullerene content (50% wt) to facilitate the charge migration. However, the pure diblock copolymer performed poorly while the addition of a 17% wt to a P3HT:[C60]PCBM blend reduced the interfacial energy, preventing phase segregation in the film.95
A compelling example of a well-defined rod–coil block copolymer composed of P3HT donor and C60 acceptor chromophores is P3HT-b-P(SxAy)-C60 (Fig. 7) that was employed as “surfactant” in a regular P3HT:[C60]PCBM film, to control the phase segregation of the two components.96 Interestingly, AFM surface analysis revealed a well-defined long “nanofibrils” structure, despite the presence of rigid C60 moieties. This specific spatial configuration could affect the active layer composites, altering their miscibility. Solar cells processed with a 5 wt% of P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 showed a 3.5% PCE, approximately 35% higher than that obtained without “surfactant” in a control device. This positive effect on photocurrent could be ascribed to the enhanced interpenetrating networks of the BHJ as a consequence of the surfactant action. The use of pure P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 as active layer revealed a disappointing performance due to the presence of excessive insulating styrene units and long flexible chains in the coil fragment that was necessary to render the polymer soluble.

Future advances in block copolymer synthesis are likely to lead to finer-scale phase separation and higher-performance devices thanks to their “amalgamating effect”.
In designing low-bandgap polymers for BHJ solar cells various aspects need to be considered. Reducing the bandgap of the polymer by decreasing the oxidation potential may reduce the Voc. On the other hand, a lowering of the bandgap by decreasing the reduction potential of the donor will leave Voc unaffected but decreases the driving force of the donor to transfer an electron in the excited state to the acceptor. So, a careful design of polymers with appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy values is crucial for obtaining higher Voc, while maintaining a narrow bandgap. On the other side PCBM is not an efficient acceptor for solar cells that rely on near infrared absorbing polymers. Consequently, alternative acceptor materials that deliver efficient driving force should be synthesized, the subject of the next section.
4. Acceptors
In the following section, we will give an overview of the accepting materials, describing n-type polymers in polymer/polymer heterojunctions, carbon nanostructures such as fullerene derivatives and carbon nanotubes, and also recent non-fullerene based compounds.
4.1 Polymer-polymer heterojunctions
Very few examples of successful polymer-polymer heterojunctions have been reported in the literature.97–99 An ideal p/n (donor/acceptor) two-layer heterojunction exhibits complementary optical and electronic properties as well as ohmic contacts at the polymer/metal electrode interface. Thus, low-work-function metals, commonly unstable in air, are required to match the electron affinity between the n-type polymers and the electrode. In addition to this, since the greatest number of conjugated polymers used in plastic solar cells were p-type semiconductors, the lack of suitable n-type polymers renders the design of this particular active layer somewhat of a challenge. However, some n-type polymers were synthesized by the addition of cyano groups to well-known polymeric structures. For instance, poly(3,4-dicyanothiophene) (PDCTh), a derivative of polythiophene, was used as the accepting component together with poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) in the fabrication of polymer-polymer heterojunctions. Because of its low solubility, PDCTh was directly polymerized via vapor deposition on a substrate, using 2,5-diiodo-3,4-dicyanothiophene as the starting monomer100 (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PDCTh. 
An ITO coated glass covered with 200 Å of gold was used as the substrate to prevent the ITO degradation during the polymer layer deposition. Thus, a bilayer device with gold contacts at both sides was fabricated to test its photovoltaic response, revealing a Voc of 0.28 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 4 × 10−4 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 3.5 × 10−4%.100 This low performance was in agreement with an electron photon quantum yield of 0.1%. To improve this architecture, the copolymerization of 2,5-diiodo-3,4-dicyanothiophene with more soluble units to increase its solubility and manipulation as well as the use of a lower work function metal have been proposed.
Poly[oxa-1,4-phenylene-1,2-(1-cyano)ethenylene-2,5-dioctyloxy-1,4-phenylene-1,2-(2-cyano)ethenylene-1,4-phenylene] CN-ether-PPV, another n-type material bearing cyano groups at the vinylene double bond, was blended with (poly[2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene-1,2-ethenylene-2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-(1,4-phenylene-1,2-ethenylene)]) M3EH-PPV in a polymer-polymer solar cell (Fig. 8). An energy efficiency of 1.7% under 100 mW cm−2 white light illumination101 was achieved probably due to the formation of a vertical-composition-graded structure during the casting process. In fact, because of the higher solubility in chlorobenzene of CN-ether-PPV, compared to M3EH-PPV, a graded deposition of the two components was obtained during the formation of the active layer. Nevertheless, due to the formation of exciplexes, an external quantum efficiency of only 30% was observed although 95% of the excitons generated on M3EH-PPV were quenched in the presence of CN-ether-PPV. The authors ascribed to these geminate pairs the 1.7% efficiency, preventing an even higher photocurrent conversion.
 Fig. 8  M3EH-PPV/CN-ether-PPV blend. 
Owing to the presence of amide and imine functionalities as parts of the aromatic core, poly(benzimidazole-benzophenanthroline) BBL (Fig. 9)102 is another class of polymeric structure that has also been studied as a source of n-type materials. More specifically, BBL presents a conductivity of 0.01–100 S cm−1, a good photoconductivity, and the highest LUMO value (4.0 eV) among n-type polymers in its category.97,103–105 Poly(p-phenylenevinylene) PPV:BBL and poly(2-methoxy-5(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) MEH-PPV:BBL bilayers have been investigated thanks to their complementary optical properties and electronic structures.106 A power conversion efficiency that inversely depended on the light intensity source was observed with values ranging from 1.5%–4.6% for an intensity of 80–1 mW cm−2.
 Fig. 9  Molecular structure of BBL. 
Under single wavelength radiation of 460 nm, a PCE even higher (5.4%) was achieved in the PPV:BBL polymer-polymer solar cell.107
Although the use of two polymers with complementary properties to form the active layer overcame the 10−2–10−3% energy conversion efficiency of cells made with pure semiconducting polymers,108 polymer-polymer heterojunctions still present some limitations.
In fact, when two polymers come in contact they modify their surface and the energy levels due to their low entropy of mixing, while the redistribution of the electric field is continuously altered by the photoinduced current. These events cause interfacial barrier states because of the aggregation of the two phases and the charge accumulation at the interface, limiting the exciton diffusion and the collection efficiency at the electrodes.109
4.2 Carbon-based nanostructures
In this part, we discuss the use of small molecules based on buckminsterfullerene as accepting components in BHJs, describing the attempts to increase their solubility, to improve the interaction with the donor part in the active layer as well as the influence of the chemical functionalization on the optoelectronic properties.

4.2.1 C60 and [C60]PCBM derivatives. 
The earliest studies of photoinduced electron transfer from the excited state of a conducting polymer MEH-PPV π* onto buckminsterfullerene24 on which the current organic photovoltaics rest, is a process that leaves holes in the polymer and electrons in the fullerene phase with a quantum efficiency close to unity. Steady-state and time-resolved luminescence, as well as light induced electron spin resonance, were used to prove the existence of a strong interaction between the two components in the excited state. The charge transfer at the interface was the main process observed rather than fast carrier recombination or the radiative emission decay of the photoexcited MEH-PPV. The most serious limitation of these early attempts was the low solubility of C60. Conversion of the latter to PCBM was the key to generation of BHJ devices.
To date, [C60]PCBM, with its good electron mobility, excellent electron accepting capability and good miscibility with conjugated polymers, is considered the most successful acceptor. However, as already alluded to, there are a variety of parameters that can be modified to improve the performance of a plastic solar cell, including the thickness of the film, the acceptor/donor ratio, the choice of solvents and the use of additives, as well as the annealing of the active layer at different temperatures.26,73,110,111 Several research groups have been working continuously on these physical properties, studying the morphology of the blend and re-designing the structure of the devices, while others have been synthesizing new fullerene derivatives. In the field of chemical functionalization, several efforts have been made to obtain more soluble C60 derivatives for a better interaction of the blend in the solid state and to modify the well-known structure of PCBM. Higher fullerene isomers104 were also functionalized to examine the effect of the reduced symmetry on the photocurrent conversion.
To further enhance the solubility of [C60]PCBM in organic solvents, several analogues have been synthesized with different ester alkyl chains, varying from C1 to C16.112 The length of the chain did not influence the optical and electrochemical properties of the acceptors but the morphology of the film improved with the length. In contrast to [C60]PCBM, the more soluble acceptors are able to produce a good quality film either alone or as a blend with donor components. Considering the device performance, however, the increase of the alkyl chain length seemed to lower the carrier mobility which deteriorated significantly when the alkyl chain was C16H33.
PCBB (Fig. 10) revealed the best photosensitivity, achieving a PCE of 2.84% under AM1.5 illumination against the 2.0% of PCBM, tested in the same experimental conditions. In an attempt to improve the miscibility with polythiophene polymers, the phenyl group of PCBM was substituted by a thienyl group to influence the morphology of the film and consequently the charge transportation in a polythiophene:fullerene composite.113 However, the morphology of the P3HT:1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-thienyl-[6,6]-methanofullerene (ThCBM) blend improved only after thermal annealing, demonstrating an efficiency as high as 3% in 1:1 ratio blend with P3HT. Further, cyclic voltammetry measurements as well as electron mobility and electron transport properties were not affected by the replacement of the phenyl ring with the thienyl moiety. A similar study concerning the intermixing capability of functionalized C60 was carried out using 1,1-bis(4,4′-dodecyloxyphenyl)-(5,6)C61-diphenylmethanofullerene DMP-12. The latter, a highly symmetric PCBM-like derivative bearing two benzene rings on the methanofullerene bond has been employed as acceptor together with poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] OC1C10-PPV (Fig. 11).114 Despite the absence of any significant influence on the electrochemical and optical properties, the two phenyl groups, which are free to rotate and capable of interacting with the fullerene surface,115 were introduced to create a supramolecular π–π interaction in the OPV blend. DMP-12-based devices revealed an efficiency of 2.3% and a higher Voc by 0.1 V compared to the one obtained under the same conditions using [C60]PCBM, probably due to the improved morphology of the active layer, rather than the donor-HOMO acceptor-LUMO energy gap. In contrast, an electron mobility 40 times lower than a [C60]PCBM-test device was ascribed to the less well-defined phases that decreased the performance. Indeed, due to the enhanced solubility of DMP-12, a high level of recombination during the delocalization of the photogenerated charges was observed as a consequence of the fine-intermixing of the DMP-12 with the donor component.

Since all the high performance BHJ devices are based on dissymmetric fullerene derivatives, it is possible that a symmetric functionalization could be responsible for the lower performance. In further support for this notion, [5,6]-open azafulleroid APCBM,116 where A stands for aza, or C70 functionalized compounds117 produce improved device performance.
In the case of the APCBM, the methano bond of the [C60]PCBM was modified via the replacement of the bridged carbon atom with the more negative nitrogen atom to evaluate both the influence of the bridged nitrogen atom on the electronic structure as well as the possibility to stabilize the [5,6]-open fulleroids against the more thermodynamically stable [6,6]-closed methanofullerenes. During the synthesis, two isomeric imino-PCBMs were observed by the addition of the corresponding azido compounds (Scheme 2). Based on the CV measurements, the open and closed isomers showed reduction potential waves in between the pristine C60 and PCBM. This behavior was mainly ascribed to the higher electronegativity of the nitrogen bridge atom which reduces the electron density in the N-bridged imino-PCBM shell rather than the binding mode. However, despite the isoelectronic character of the open form with C60 (preservation of the original 60 π-electrons), no significant differences in the HOMO levels were observed between [5,6]-open APCBM and [6,6]-closed APCBM. Nevertheless, due to the lower degree of symmetry and the retention of the C60 electron configuration, the open azafulleroid demonstrated an enhanced photocurrent and mobility as well as a higher absorptivity in the visible range with more definition in the spectral features.116,118 In contrast, the [6,6]-closed aziridinofullerene presented remarkable similarities with PCBM, due to their isoelectronic 58 π-electron structure. Investigation of BHJ solar cells using these derivatives confirmed the feature of the opened [5,6] isomer. An efficiency of 2.8% and 2.3% was achieved using [5,6]-open APCBM and [6,6]-closed APCBM, respectively. The very slightly better performance of the open form was attributed to the higher charge mobility since no relevant differences were observed in the LUMO levels and consequently in the Voc. Moreover, the higher optical density, the loss of symmetry and the preservation of the 60 π-electron structure can be considered peculiar characteristics of this particular isomeric form.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of N-bridged imino-PCBMs. 
In order to evaluate the influence of electron donating and withdrawing groups on the electrochemical properties of [C60]PCBM, Hummelen et al.119 have substituted the hydrogens of the phenyl ring of [C60]PCBM with different functional groups. In fact, the Voc linearly depends, within certain limits,120,121 on the difference between the HOMO of the donor component and the LUMO of the acceptor. Unless the two energetic levels becomes too close, the LUMO of PCBM can still be lowered, allowing for an efficient charge generation and photoinduced charge separation. Therefore, a series of mono-, di- and tri-methoxy, thioester and pentafluoro derivatives were investigated. The presence of electron donating groups varied the LUMO energy levels over a range of 0.86 eV but the Voc of (poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]) MDMO-PPV:methanofullerene devices was only slightly modified. The position of the methoxy groups on the phenyl ring did not affect the electrochemistry results while their number had the most powerful effect on the variation of the LUMO values. Methyl-thioester moieties did not have any significant donating power, whereas fluorine atoms mainly influenced the first reduction potential. In agreement with the electrochemical results, a linear correspondence between the Voc and the LUMO location of the different C60 derivatives was observed in non-optimized polymer:fullerene devices.
An alternative way to functionalize the buckminsterfullerene was reported by Frechet et al.122 who replaced the methano bridge of the PCBM with a different attachment. A series of dihydronaphthyl bridged fulleroids with ester solubilizing groups was synthesized and tested in polymer fullerene plastic solar cells (Fig. 12). In contrast to PCBM, the nature of the substitution of the ester moieties that vary from p- and tri-methoxy-benzene to mono- and pentafluoro-benzene revealed no direct effect on the LUMO energy levels but mainly an indirect influence on the electron density through intermolecular interaction in the solid state. AFM images and device performance with these non-PCBM-like derivatives confirmed the solubilizing and interaction effects, achieving a PCE of 4.2% with a phenyl ester acceptor concentration of 45%.
 Fig. 12  Dihydronaphthyl bridge ester C60 fullerene derivatives. 

p-Ethylhexyloxy-substituted methanofullerene (p-EHO-PCBA) represents a good example of the combination of physical and chemical modifications for the improvement of device performance. This modified [C60]PCBM derivative was designed to fit a particular device architecture in which a (titanium oxide) TiOx film was introduced either for a better distribution of the photogenerated charges or for an enhanced interfacial charge transfer thanks to the interaction of the optical layer with the carboxylic functional groups. In fact, in a standard BHJ solar cell, due to the optical interference of the incident and back-reflected light, the light intensity at the metallic (aluminium) electrode is near zero and consequently the photogeneration of carriers is restricted in a fraction of the active layer close to the (indium tin oxide) ITO electrode. Then, electron-hole pairs tend to be generated predominately at the ITO side, creating an inhomogeneous distribution of holes and charges that lowers performance. Since increasing the thickness of the active layer to absorb more light reduces the mobility, an alternative approach is to modify the device architecture, introducing a titanium dioxide optical spacer29 and to synthesize acceptor or donor materials bearing carboxylic functionalities.123,124
Therefore, the ester functionality of the [C60]PCBM structure was hydrolyzed to promote the interaction with the optical spacer layer. Subsequently, a solubilizing electron-donating branched ether group was introduced in the aromatic phenyl ring of the [C60]PCBM, not only for a better manipulation and easier purification but also to influence the LUMO energy level (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 13  Structures of p-EHO-PCBA and p-EHO-PCBM compared to that of [C60]PCBM. 
The power conversion efficiency of P3HT/p-EHO-PCBA/TiOx (2.64%) revealed a slightly better efficiency than the control devices P3HT:p-EHO-PCBM:TiOx (2.34%) made with the corresponding ester. [C60]PCBM was also tested using the same experimental conditions (P3HT:[C60]PCBM:TiOx), demonstrating a PCE of 2.29% similar to that obtained with the analogue ester p-EHO-PCBM. J-V curves are shown in Fig. 14 with a schematic of the device. These results clearly evidence the effective interaction between the titanium optical spacer and the carboxylic acid groups of the modified p-EHO-PCBA that is absent in the case of the p-EHO-PCBM or [C60]PCBM.

4.2.2 C70 and higher fullerene derivatives. 
The higher [C60]PCBM analogs such as 6,6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([C70]PCBM) and [C84]PCBM have been used as alternatives for [C60]PCBM in fullerene/polymer solar cells. The same synthetic procedure used for [C60]PCBM was also adopted for these higher fullerene derivatives to study their application in [C70]PCBM:poly(2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) MDMO-PPV solar cells. Using C70, an efficiency that varies in the range of 2.4 and 3% was achieved and a 50% higher current density than [C60]PCBM was observed.117,125 Surprisingly, with [C84]PCBM the efficiency dropped to 0.25%.126
A possible explanation may be the lower LUMO energy that reduces the Voc, the large mobility difference between electrons and holes in the [C84]PCBM:MDMO-PPV blend and the decreased solubility of this higher fullerene derivative. The broader and stronger optical absorption in the visible region, extending even to the near infrared in the case of C84 that resulted in a higher current output, was the main reason for the examination of these higher fullerene derivatives.127 However, the low abundance, combined with the LUMO energy level, do not augur well for large scale applications to BHJ devices.


4.2.3 Carbon nanotubes CNTs. 
Another emerging class of accepting materials are the carbon nanotubes (CNT).128 Single-walled nanotubes SWNTs usually present a diameter of ca. 1 nm while multi-walled nanotubes MWNTs comprise several co-axial graphitic tubes with an inter-plane separation of 0.34–0.35 nm. Depending on the direction in which the sheet is rolled up and their diameters, CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting, influencing their electronic properties.129,130 Moreover, a unique thermal stability greater than natural diamond, a claimed conductivity131,132 higher than copper by 2–3 orders of magnitude, and a purported tensile strength133–135 10–110 times stronger than steel render these carbon derivatives good candidates for long-life flexible organic photovoltaic devices. Moreover, compared with C60, SWNTs have a series of advantages, including a larger electron affinity, a higher charge mobility along the axis and the presence of structural traps that facilitate the charge dissociation.136,137 The first report of polymer:SWNTs photovoltaic devices was in 2002 by Amaratunga et al.138 who obtained an Voc of 0.75 V for a 1% doped SWNTs:P3OT composite active layer and an efficiency of only 0.04%. Because of their limited solubility, dispersibility and processability, pristine CNTs are difficult to manipulate and tend to aggregate in bundles, limiting the dispersion and the carrier mobility in the polymer matrix. Thus, chemical and physical methods have been used to improve the solubility of CNTs in the active layer and to achieve a larger area of interface between donors and acceptors.139,140
Poly(phenylene ethynylene) PPE was blended with SWNTs to facilitate the π–π stacking interaction with the CNT lattice, achieving a Voc of 1.04 V and a circuit current density of 0.27 mA cm−2. For comparison, a P3OT:SWNT control device revealed a lower performance because of the impossibility of forming an efficient π–π stacking hybrid between P3OT and CNTs.141
Prato et al.142 synthesized both covalent and non-covalent functionalized SWNTs as acceptors for OPVs. Polymer-grafted SWNTs with poly[(vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride] (PVBTA-SWNTs) were obtained by free-radical polymerization of the monomer in the presence of SWNTs while poly[(vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride] PVBTAn+ was non-covalently wrapped around CNTs (PVBTA/SWNTs). The donor/acceptor active layer was formed by mixing covalent or non-covalent functionalized CNTs and porphyrins (P)8− or zinc metal porphyrins ZnP8− by coulombic interaction, revealing a monochromatic incident photo-to-current efficiency up to 9.90% in the case of non-covalent PVBTA/SWNTs with zinc porphyrins ZnP8−. To the best of our knowledge, a photovoltaic device was not fabricated.
Since the diameter of MWNTs can reach 100 nm, significantly less attention has been directed to these carbon nanostructures for the design of OPVs. Generally, a suitable diameter for these devices should be at most 20 nm since the typical overall organic layer thickness is <200 nm. Therefore, only thin MWNTs are good candidates for these thin film device architectures and offer some advantages over SWNTs. In fact, MWNTs are less likely to bundle and surface oxidation or covalent functionalization do not drastically modify the nanotube properties as much as is the case with SWNTs.143,144 Additionally, although the inner-tube interactions in MWNTs are expected to be weak, their electronic properties cannot be assumed as a superposition of a set of isolated SWNTs. In fact, MWNTs are essentially metallic with a small but defined density of states at the Fermi level, much like graphite.144 Indeed, despite the direct contact of the outermost layer with the metal electrode or the matrix polymer, the inner tubes play a significant role in the conductance of MWNTs.
An example of polymer:MWNTs composite for optoelectronics has been described by Ago and collaborators.145 MWNTs were initially purified by chemical oxidation in order to remove metallic catalyst impurities and amorphous carbon and then blended with PPV, whose helical structure helps the dispersion of the tubes in the polymeric solution. Thus, a thin and uniform film using a concentrated and well-dispersed solution of MWNTs was examined in a polymer:MWNTs device. A Voc of 0.9 V, a short circuit current of 0.56 μA cm−2 and poor efficiency of 0.08% were obtained in spite of the relatively high MWNTs dispersion.
Regardless of the main drawbacks of these nanostructures, we believe that the potentiality of the CNTs has not been exhaustively explored. For instance, we consider the use of microwave irradiation as a milder removal method for metal particles, avoiding the harsh conditions responsible for damaging the CNT surface.146 Moreover, selective synthetic approaches and purification techniques could be used to enrich and separate the two fractions of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes.147 Although these are laborious processes, a reduced amount of metallic components can minimize the high mobility through their lattice, a characteristic that causes short circuits and, consequently, limits the photoconversion to low values.148

4.3 New non-fullerene based acceptors
Since the discovery of PCBM, many efforts were made to improve the performance of this fullerene derivative as an n-type component in OPVs. A replacement of PCBM in bulk heterojunction photovoltaics has not been found so far and its applications have been widely used and intensely studied, dominating the scene in the field of OPV acceptors. However, little work has been done to find a valid non-fullerene substitute. Despite their success, fullerene derivatives have demonstrated both limited optical absorption in the visible region and essentially non-modifiable LUMO levels that lead to relatively low-Voc devices. Moreover, the synthesis of functionalized fullerenes is based on addition reactions that perturb the electronic properties of the pristine C60; in addition, due to limited solubility, the synthetic procedures involve difficult purification processes, lengthy preparation routes and low yields.
Sellinger et al. have reported the synthesis and properties of a series of n-type conjugated oligomers based on the Heck coupling of 2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazoles with various di- and trihalo aromatics, as alternative non-fullerene acceptors.149,150 These compounds, referred to as Vinazene derivatives, were easily prepared from alkylvinylazene with selected bromoaromatics. Their optical and electronic properties were tuned by selecting the proper aromatic core and their solubility was increased by inserting branched alkyl chains. Photovoltaic performances with Vinazene derivative 1 (Fig. 15) and poly[N-(2′-decyltetradecyl)carbazole]-2,7-diyl (PCz) as the donor polymer, reached a large Voc over 1 V, higher than that of PCBM; despite this, an efficiency of barely 0.75% was reported. The large open circuit voltage, an important requirement for organic electronics, was in agreement with the values of LUMO energy levels, ranging from −2.76 to −3.50 eV.151
 Fig. 15  Structure of Vinazene derivative 1 employed with PCz in BHJs. 
Substituted arylene imides, perylene or naphthalene diimides are interesting categories of molecules with high charge mobility whose structures can be modified in order to tune the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and, more generally, to modify their electronic performance. The introduction of fluorinated groups as well as cyano electron-withdrawing substituents can influence the electronic properties of these small n-type compounds. These materials have been investigated in organic field-effect transistors and despite their promising characteristics, no OPV applications have been reported.152
5. Conclusions and outlook
Organic electronics has come a long way from small single crystals with a conductivity of less than 10−6 S cm−1 through doped polymer conductivities on the order of 104 S cm−1 for polyacetylene153 to organic photovoltaics with power conversion efficiencies on the order of 7–8%. By adopting a room temperature printing and spraying technology, plastic solar cells represent a valid answer to the growing quest for energy conversion because of the possibility of significantly reducing the cost of large scale production.
In this review, we have analyzed state of the art design and development of organic materials in the context of bulk heterojunction devices. Despite significant progress in this field, there is still plenty of room to improve their performance and to achieve 10% efficiency. New approaches are required for the optimization of this emerging architecture:
• Low-bandgap polymer materials that can harvest more photons from the solar spectrum should be developed in order to achieve a higher level of power conversion efficiency, which is essential for the commercialization of organic solar cells.
• The synthesis of a new generation of acceptors with different HOMO–LUMO energies that will require the use of non-fullerene compounds. The fabrication of a large open circuit voltage device, almost double that of PCBM, demonstrates the possibility of achieving a Voc value above 1 eV.
• The design of block polymers, in which one block contains the conjugated polymer and the other block pendant fullerenes, to control the morphology for a better exciton dissociation.
• The choice of electrode metals with different work functions to minimize the energy loss at the corresponding electrode interfaces and improve charge collection.
A very recent study predicted a 15% efficiency, adopting a tandem solar cell in which two bilayers of a low-bandgap polymer and a mid-bandgap polymer cells were stacked.32,154
Our review indicates that in short order plastic solar cells will dominate the scene of OPVs, especially in the case where a light and flexible device is preferred.
