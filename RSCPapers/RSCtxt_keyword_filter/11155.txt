    , Accepted 15th September 2019First published on 16th September 2019AbstractInorganic CsPbI3 perovskite holds great promise to prepare high-performance and long-term operational perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of its ideal band gap and intrinsic superb stability. However, due to the low tolerance factor, the photoactive CsPbI3 perovskite is a high-temperature (330 °C) phase that would spontaneously transit to a non-perovskite phase at ambient temperature. Herein, we incorporate piperazine-1,4-diium iodide (PZDI2) into CsPbI3 perovskite to stabilize the photoactive phase. PZD cations are proved to be inserted between layered perovskites to form a Ruddlesden–Popper 2D structure. Excitingly, a small amount of PZDI2 (3%) radically enhances the thermal stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite. Specifically, the CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 film exhibits no phase transition after heating at 100 °C for 24 h, whereas the pristine CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 films are seriously degraded after 16 h and 12 h, respectively. The carbon-based PSCs without the hole transport material (C-PSCs) using the CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 film show almost no performance decay after storage in air atmosphere at room temperature for 1200 h and at 85 °C for 200 h, whereas at 85 °C, the pristine CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 devices inflict over 20% decay after 40 h and 6 h, respectively.
Introduction
The rapidly raising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted much attention.1–5 However, their low stability significantly limits their practical application. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) are the main cause for the degradation of PSCs because the volatility of small organic cations (e.g. CH3NH3+) under thermal stress would destroy the perovskite materials and hence device performance.6–10 To solve this problem, the strategy of substituting the organic cations with inorganic cations (e.g. Cs+) to form an inorganic perovskite (e.g. CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2) has been widely adopted.9–12
CsPbI3 perovskite is the most inspiring example due to its ideal bandgap (Eg) of ∼1.70 eV.9–11,13,14 However, the tolerance factor of CsPbI3 perovskite is only 0.81, which could not support a stable perovskite structure at low temperature.9–11,13 The perovskite structure obtained at around 330 °C would spontaneously transit to a non-perovskite phase (δ-CsPbI3) without any photo-activity under ambient conditions.9–11,13 In order to stabilize the perovskite structure, several effective strategies have been developed, including inducing surface strain by reducing the crystal size to the nanoscale,15–17 incorporating large size cations into a crystal lattice18,19 and forming a 2D interface using large organic ammonium cations.20–23 Among these strategies, forming a 2D interface holds the highest promise, which could not only enforce the perovskite structure but also prevent moisture attacking. So far, several large organic ammonium cations exhibited positive effects, including n-butylammonium (BA),21 phenylethylammonium (PEA),22–24 and oleylammonium (OA).22 However, a large amount of those cations were usually needed to induce an obvious stabilizing effect, which would block the carrier transport and hence suppress the device performance.
Herein, a new ammonium cation, piperazine-1,4-diium (PZD), was employed to form a 2D interface in CsPbI3 perovskite. PZD cations, for the first time, were proved to serve as an interlayer, which was inserted between layered perovskites to form a Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) 2D structure. The thermal stability of CsPbI3 perovskite was radically enhanced after a small amount of PZD cations (3%) was incorporated. CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 did not show a phase transition or decomposition after heating at 100 °C for 24 h, while the pristine CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 films were seriously degraded at 16 h and 12 h, respectively. The carbon-based PSCs without hole transport materials (C-PSCs) using CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 exhibited almost no PCE decay after storage at 85 °C for 200 h, while the PCEs of MAPbI3 and CsPbI3 C-PSCs decreased by more than 20% within 10 h and 40 h, respectively. In addition, both morphology and crystal quality were improved after PZDI2 incorporation, and the C-PSCs based on CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 achieved an elevated PCE of 9.39% compared with the pristine CsPbI3 device (8.53%).
Results and discussion
As an ammonium cation with a moderate size (2.72 Å), PZD cations may combine with [PbI6]4− octahedra to form an ABX3 perovskite structure or serve as an interlayer to induce the 2D structure. To clarify so, we prepared a PbI2–PZDI2 complex on FTO glass by spin coating the solution containing PbI2 and PZDI2 (Fig. 1(a)) with equal moles. The XRD pattern of the complex shows intense diffraction peaks, which is clear evidence for their high crystallinity (Fig. 1(b)). Interestingly, the narrow peaks (indicated by ♦) that appear at equal increments (2θ ∼ 6.15°) are characteristic of 00l type reflections of layered compounds.25,26 Such diffraction patterns resemble those of the reported layered perovskites, well suggesting that a 2D perovskite has been obtained. The SEM image in Fig. 1(c) also shows a vivid layered structure, which further confirms the formation of a 2D structure. The interlayer distance is calculated to be 14.36 Å, which is larger than the sum of the size of the inorganic octahedron (6.2 Å)27 and the size of the PZD cation (2.72 Å). Therefore, though PZD cation is a dual ammonium cation, and it prefers to form a Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) 2D perovskite (Fig. 1(e))25 rather than a Dion–Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite28 (Fig. 1(d)). One of the ammonium groups in the PZD cation may coordinate with [PbI6]4− octahedra, while the other ammonium group would interact with I− anions to keep electric neutrality. The UV-Vis spectrum in Fig. 1(f) exhibits an absorption onset at ∼485 nm, corresponding to an Eg of 2.58 eV. The PL spectrum presents a sharp peak centered at 483 nm, which is consistent with the UV-Vis result. Hence, it could be concluded that the obtained PbI2–PZDI2 complex is a RP 2D perovskite.

CsPbI3 films were deposited by the spin-coating method using a precursor solution containing DMF·PbI2·HI adduct and CsI. After deposition, the films were annealed at 200 °C and the CsPbI3 perovskite was obtained. For PZDI2 incorporation, different PZDI2 concentrations were added into the above precursor solution. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the CsPbI3·xPZDI2 films (0% < x < 25%). For x in the range of 0% to 25%, the diffraction peak number for all the samples is identical without forming any new diffraction peak and the corresponding peak positions are close, suggesting no new phase is generated. For a more detailed observation, a shift of the peak positions for the (100) and (200) lattice planes to smaller angles can be seen in the amplified diffraction patterns (Fig. 2(b)) as x increases from 0% to 25%, implying expanded lattice. XPS, FTIR and Raman spectra in Fig. S6–S8 (ESI†) further confirm the incorporation of PZDI2 in the CsPbI3 perovskite.

(d) UV-vis spectra and (e) relationship of Eg with PZDI2 content. (g) TRPL spectra of the CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 films deposited on the glass side. TRPL profiles were fitted to exponential decay and the average lifetime was calculated according to the equation: y(x) = A1 × exp(−x/τ1) + A2 × exp(−x/τ2) + A3 × exp(−x/τ3) + y0. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CsPbI3·xPZDI2 films in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S2 (ESI†) indicate that the pristine CsPbI3 film shows a relatively rough surface and some shallow pores are observed. After PZDI2 addition, CsPbI3·xPZDI2 films gradually become more uniform and compact, and the pore number is further reduced. Meanwhile, the average grain size continues decreasing (Fig. S3, ESI†). Further increasing the PZDI2 content to 10% leads to a drastic reduction in grain size and the film surface is obviously roughened with the crystal grains becoming disconnected. The average grain size is about 320 nm for the pristine CsPbI3 film, which gradually reduces to 277 nm for the CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 film and to 150 nm for the CsPbI3·25%PZDI2 film. AFM images in Fig. S4 (ESI†) agree well with the SEM observation.
UV-vis spectra were recorded to study the change in Eg. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the absorption onsets of perovskite films gradually redshift as PZDI2 content increases. Further calculation (Fig. 2(e)) indicates that the Eg significantly increases from 1.66 to 1.72 eV as x increases from 0% to 25%, which is consistent with the change in the interplanar spacing in Fig. 2(a) and (b). PL spectra in Fig. S5 (ESI†) further confirm the results of UV-vis spectra. This phenomenon is similar to the previously reported works on other large organic cations, such as BA,25 PEA29 and AO,22 which could generate a 2D structure in MAPbI3 or CsPbI3. The observed blue shifts are attributed to quantum confinement.25,30 Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra in Fig. 2(f) indicated that the CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 film shows the slowest quenching rate followed by CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3 films. After fitting, the average lifetimes for the CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 films are calculated to be 2.35 ns, 2.89 ns and 8.93 ns, respectively, suggesting the reduction in defect density after PZDI2 addition.
C-PSCs (as illustrated in Fig. 3(a)) were fabricated by directly painting carbon paste on the CsPbI3·xPZDI2 films, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 40 min. J–V curves were recorded to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. The distributions of PCE, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S9 (ESI†). The average Voc increases progressively with the addition of PZDI2, which should be due to the reduced non-radiation recombination after PZDI2 addition (Fig. 2(f)). Besides, the improvement in the morphology of the perovskite layer (more compact and smooth) would also facilitate charge transfer and transport for suppressing charge recombination. The average Jsc gradually decreases with PZDI2 content, which may be attributed to the enlarged Eg after PZDI2 addition. The FF value does not show obvious change for the three devices. Consequently, the average PCEs of CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 C-PSCs are 7.7%, 8.5% and 8.1%, respectively.

Fig. 3(c) shows the J–V curves of the champion CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 C-PSCs. The champion CsPbI3 device obtains a PCE of 8.53% with a Voc of 0.77 V, Jsc of 16.57 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.67. The champion CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 device shows a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 15.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.66, affording a significantly improved PCE of 9.39%, a promising value for CsPbI3 C-PSCs.31–33 Compared with the CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 device, the champion CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 device obtains a slightly lower PCE of 8.8%, with a Voc of 0.97 V, Jsc of 14.33 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.64. The champion CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 device has small hysteresis (Fig. S10, ESI†) and the plot of the PCE obtained at the voltage close to the maximum power output point as a function of time in Fig. 3(d) shows a steady-state PCE of ∼8.77%, close to the value calculated from the J–V curve. The IPCE spectrum of the CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 device in Fig. 3(e) shows an integrated Jsc of 14.95 mA cm−2, consistent with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve.
To examine the thermal stability of CsPbI3·xPZDI2 films, MAPbI3, CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 films were heated at 100 °C in dry air. Photographs (Fig. 4(a)) and XRD patterns (Fig. S11, ESI†) of the samples after heating for different durations were taken to evaluate their thermal stability. As indicated in Fig. 4(a), the black MAPbI3 film becomes totally yellow after 12 h due to the decomposition of MAPbI3 to MAI and PbI2.8 The CsPbI3 film becomes partially yellow after 16 h and becomes totally yellow after 20 h, due to the transition of α or γ to δ, suggesting improved thermal stability. After the addition of 0.5%PZDI2, the CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 film does not show an obvious yellow phase during the heating process, except for a change in color from dark brown to light brown after 24 h. The XRD patterns (Fig. S11, ESI†) show that no δ phase is formed after 15 h and only a small part of the perovskite phase is transited into δ phase after 24 h. As PZDI2 content increases to 3%, the film color remains almost identical to the fresh one after heating. It is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†) that no phase transition happens after heating for 24 h, declaring the largely improved thermal stability. Therefore, PZDI2 addition is a promising way to enhance the thermal stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite.

(b) PCE change of the CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 devices with storage time at room temperature in dry air (RH ∼ 10–20%). (c) PCE change of the CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2, CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 and MAPbI3 devices with storage time at 85 °C in dry air (RH ∼ 10–20%). 
Device stability was tested by storing CsPbI3, CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 and CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 C-PSCs in dry air at room temperature, whose J–V curves were recorded after different durations. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the PCEs of all C-PSCs show almost no decay after over 1200 h, declaring high room-temperature stability. Thermal stability was studied by storing the C-PSCs at 85 °C in dry air with the J–V curves measured after a certain time. Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S12 (ESI†) show the relative changes of the PV parameters for different devices with storage time. The MAPbI3 device shows poor thermal stability, with the PCE decreasing by more than 20% within 10 h. In contrast, the CsPbI3 device retains its 80% initial PCE after over 40 h, a significantly higher thermal stability. Promisingly, after 0.5%PZDI2 is added, the thermal stability of the CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 device is largely improved with the PCE retaining its 80% initial value after 78 h. Furthermore, 3%PZDI2 addition drastically boosts the thermal stability and the PCE decays less than 1% after 200 h. To the best of our knowledge, this has been the most promising thermal stability data for CsPbI3-based PSCs.10,14,24,31,32,34 Therefore, PZDI2 incorporation has significantly enhanced the thermal stability of CsPbI3 perovskite and their PV devices. The far higher thermal stability of CsPbI3·xPZDI2 than that of MAPbI3 strongly highlights its advantage for PV application.
Conclusion
We have studied the effect of the PZDI2 incorporation on CsPbI3 perovskite, which was proved to serve as an interlayer, being inserted between layered perovskites to form a 2D structure. A small amount of PZDI2 greatly enhanced the thermal stability of CsPbI3 perovskite. The CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 film exhibited no phase transition or decomposition after heating at 100 °C for 24 h, whereas the pristine CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 films were seriously degraded after 16 and 12 h, respectively. A suitable PZDI2 concentration further improved the morphology and the crystal quality, and an improved PCE of as high as 9.39% was achieved for the CsPbI3·0.5%PZDI2 C-PSCs. Furthermore, the C-PSCs also show obviously enhanced thermal stability after PZDI2 incorporation and the CsPbI3·3%PZDI2 device exhibited almost no PCE decay after heating at 85 °C for 200 h, which was far higher than the CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 ones.
Methods
Deposition of TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds
TiO2 blocking layers were spin-coated on FTO glass at 2000 rpm for 20 s, using a 1-butanol solution containing 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), followed by heating at 120 °C for 5 min. Then, TiO2 mesoporous scaffolds were deposited by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD, Dyesol) dispersed in ethanol with a ratio of 1:2.5. After spin coating, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by heating at 550 °C for 30 min.
Deposition of perovskite films

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF)·HI·PbI2 powder was prepared as introduced in our previous work.31 5 g PbI2 and 4 ml HI were mixed in DMF and stirred overnight to ensure complete conversion. Light yellow DMF·HI·PbI2 precipitate was obtained by pouring abundant ethanol into the above solution, followed by washing in ethanol several times. The precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h.
PbI2–PZDI2 complex was deposited on a glass substrate by spin coating a solution containing 0.25 M PbI2 and 0.25 M PZDI2 at 1000 rpm for 20 s. A mixed solvent was used for this solution with a DMF/DMSO ratio of 1:1. Following the spin coating process, the as-deposited sample was annealed at 200 °C for ∼5 min.
A one-step spin coating method was conducted on these substrates to get perovskite films. The CsPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving ∼1 M DMF·HI·PbI2 powder and 1 M CsI in DMF. For PZDI2 incorporation, different PZDI2 content was added into the precursor solution. Then these solutions were spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s and the samples were annealed at 200 °C for 5 min. The fabrication processes of MAPbI3 films were similar to those of CsPbI3 films, except the CsI was replaced by MAI and the annealing temperature was set at 100 °C.
Deposition of carbon electrodes
A commercial carbon paste purchased from Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co. Ltd was used as carbon paint for the deposition of the carbon electrode. The carbon extraction layer was directly printed on the perovskite films at room temperature, followed by heating at 120 °C for 40 min.35–38
Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Philips PW-1830 X-ray diffractometer with X-ray tube Cu Kα radiation. (λ = 1.5406 Å). Chemical states of the film surface were evaluated by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250Xi). Raman spectra were obtained using a 785 nm laser in the 50–400 cm−1 range, particularly sensitive to the Pb–I modes. To prevent sample degradation or thermal effects, the laser power intensity was weakened and the test point per measurement was re-selected. SEM images were obtained using a JEOL 6700F or a 7100F SEM at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Ultraviolet-visible-infrared spectrophotometer (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer UV-vis spectrophotometer (model Lambda 20). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon (Laboratory RAM HR800) confocal micro-Raman spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Thermo-Fisher-Scientific Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (model Nicolet 6700). TRPL measurement was performed using an ultrafast lifetime Spectrofluorometer (Delta flex) and a 475 nm ultrafast laser was used as the excitation light source. Fluorescence lifetime images were recorded using a laser scanning confocal microscope (A1R-si).
Device characterization
The photovoltaic performance was analyzed using a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A, model number 94063A, AM 1.5 global filter) calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using an Oriel reference solar cell (monocrystalline silicon) and meter. The active area of solar cell was masked to about 6.25 mm2. J–V curves were recorded in ambient air on a ZENNIUM pro electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co., KG, Germany). IPCE spectra were recorded using an IPCE kit (E0201, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) in AC mode.
Stability test
The stability tests of perovskite films were conducted by maintaining the films at 100 °C in dry air (RH ∼ 10–20%). Photographs and XRD patterns were obtained at room temperature in ambient air. The device stability tests were performed by storing cells in dry air (RH ∼ 10–20%) at room temperature (20–30 °C). The thermal stability was tested by storing cells at 85 °C in dry air (RH ∼ 10–20%). J–V curves were measured and recorded periodically in ambient air (RH ∼ 30–80%).
