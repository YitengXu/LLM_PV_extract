Relative to WD9 with two methyl groups, the power conversion efficiency (η) increased significantly from 3.18% to 4.29% (WD12 with two hexyl chains) and 4.62% (WD13 with two decyl chains) in the absence of the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). An increase in η of about 45.2% was obtained from WD9 to WD13. The attached longer alkyl chains in DTF–TPA based organic dyes are effective to suppress the electron recombination and reduce the interactions between dye molecules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies indicate that both the resistance for charge recombination and the electron lifetime are increased after the increase of alkyl chains length to the dye molecules. The η of DSSC based on WD9 was markedly increased by about 28.6% in the presence of CDCA as compared to that in the absence of CDCA. However, the η of WD13-sensitized DSSC was not dependent on CDCA and decreased by about 5.4% in the presence of CDCA. This work indicates that the incorporation of longer alkyl chains into DTF–TPA organic dyes is a promising way for efficient coadsorbent-free DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) developed by Grätzel and coworkers have attracted considerable attention on a worldwide scale in the past two decades based on the following advantages: high power conversion efficiency (η), ease of fabrication and low production cost.1 Conventional DSSCs typically contain four components: a mesoporous semiconductor metal oxide film, a dye as a sensitizer, an electrolyte/hole transporter and a counter electrode.2 In these components, the sensitizer is a crucial element, exerting significant influence on the η as well as the stability of the solar cell.3,4
Among the various types of sensitizers, organic metal-free dyes have been extensively exploited for their environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, the flexibility of molecular design with easily tunable photophysical and electrochemical properties.5–20 However, the efficiency of organic sensitizer is low compared with that of the ruthenium21 and porphyrin22 sensitizers. Apart from the spectral response, the charge recombination and dye aggregation are also main factors for the low efficiency. As a result, a number of research efforts have been made to overcome these drawbacks and to enhance the η of DSSCs based on organic dyes. The most popular method is the addition of coadsorbent in the dye solutions, such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).23–28 The CDCA could suppress the dye aggregation and shield the TiO2 surface to reduce electron recombination with the oxidized species in redox electrolyte.29,30 But this method could increase the costs and complexities in DSSCs' assembly process. So, the development of coadsorbent-free organic dye system, in particular, is important for the future economization and simplification of the DSSCs. The introduction of alkyl chains is an effective way for the design of organic dye, which could suppress the charge recombination and dye aggregation and therefore improve the η of the DSSC.31–34
In this paper, three dithiafulvenyl–triphenylamine (DTF–TPA) based organic dyes with different alkyl chains (–CH3, –C6H13, –C10H21) attached on DTF donor were examined to investigate the effect of alkyl chain lengths on the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs in the presence and absence of the CDCA in dye-bath solutions (Fig. 1).

The study results show that both the resistance for charge recombination and the electron lifetime are increased after the increase of alkyl chain length to the dye molecules. The performance of DSSC based on WD13 with two decyl chains was not dependent on CDCA, on the contrary, the η was decreased by about 5.4% in the presence of CDCA. This work shows that the introduction of longer alkyl chains into the DTF–TPA type organic dyes is a promising way for efficient coadsorbent-free DSSCs.

Fabrication of DSSCs
TiO2 colloid was prepared according to the literature.38 The FTO glass substrates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aq. at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The 12 μm thick mesoporous nano-TiO2 films composed of 15–20 nm anatase TiO2 particles were coated on the FTO glass plates by doctor blade. After drying the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer at 125 °C, a 4 μm thick second layer of 300–500 nm sized light scattering anatase particles (Shanghai Cai Yu Nano Technology Co., Ltd) was deposited by doctor blade onto the first layer. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. After the sintering, when the temperature cooled to about 90 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM WD dyes in methanol and left overnight. The films were then rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dyes. Solar cells were assembled, using a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame, with a platinized counter electrode. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through the hole predrilled in the counter electrode, and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass coverslip. The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.3 M HMII, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in MPN.
Photovoltaic measurements
The irradiation source for the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co., USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2. Volt–current characteristics were performed on a Model 2611 sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., USA). A Keithley 2611 sourcemeter and a Model spectrapro 300i monochromator (Acton research, USA) equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp (Aosiyuan Technology & Science Co., Ltd, China) were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained by using Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system under dark condition, with forward bias −0.65 V and frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.

In methanol solution, the absorption spectrum of the WD9 dye displays a strong maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 413 nm (molar extinction coefficients (ε) = 26300 M−1 cm−1) due to charge transfer transitions of the conjugated molecule. The WD12 and WD13 dyes also exhibit similar spectral properties (λmax = 417 and 418 nm, ε = 28900 and 30400 M−1 cm−1, respectively). It is clear that the λmax and ε values of the three dyes normally increase with increasing alkyl chain length. The red-shift and enhanced absorption intensity may favor light harvesting and hence photocurrent generation in DSSCs. We assume that the reason of this higher absorption coefficient lies in the extension of the alkyl chain, and the longer alkyl chain might act as the better absorber material for the incoming light.34
Fig. 3 shows the absorbance profiles of the dyes anchoring on 3 μm thick TiO2 films after 12 h adsorption. When anchored on TiO2, red-shift of absorption maximum and broadening of the absorption spectra were found probably due to the formation of J-aggregates.39 Compared to the spectra of in methanol solution, the absorption maximum of WD9, WD12 and WD13 on TiO2 films have red-shifts about 21, 8 and 2 nm, respectively. With the increase of chain length, the red-shift of absorption maximum is decreased. This may be ascribed to the longer alkyl chain, which could decrease unfavorable aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface.
Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, and from the redox couple in the electrolyte to the oxidized dye, cyclic voltammograms were performed in methanol solution to determine the redox potential. The first oxidation potential of dyes (Eox) corresponds to the HOMO energy levels of dyes. The values of electrochemical oxidation potentials of WD9, WD12, and WD13 were listed in Table 1. The LUMO energy level was calculated by Eox − Eg.40 Eg was determined by the absorption spectra. As Fig. 4 shown, LUMO energy levels of these dyes (WD9: −1.54 V; WD12: −1.56 V; WD13: −1.57 V vs. NHE) are higher than the CB level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE) and HOMO energy levels of these dyes (WD9: 1.15; WD12: 1.11; WD13: 1.09 V vs. NHE) are more positive than the I3−/I− redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE). So, the excited electrons of these dyes could inject into TiO2 efficiently and the oxidized dyes could be regenerated effectively by getting electrons from the I−. It is worth noting that the LUMO energy levels of WD12 and WD13 are more negative than the CB of TiO2 relative to WD9, indicative of the more significant driving force for charge injection. These findings denote that the long alkyl chains in WD12 and WD13 dyes could tune the localization of the frontier orbitals appropriately and enhance the driving force for charge injection, thus making the device performance of WD12 and WD13 superior to that of WD9.

Molecular orbital calculation
To scrutinize the geometrical and photophysical properties, molecular orbital calculations of WD9, WD12 and WD13 were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) and B3LYP/6-31G* program with the Gaussian 09.41 The calculation results are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Frontier molecular orbitals of all dyes. 
The calculation shows that the HOMO energy levels of these dyes largely populate on the DTF–TPA moiety, indicating the donor ability of DTF–TPA group in these dyes, while the LUMO energy levels are delocalized over the 2-cyanoacetic acid and phenyl unit with a sizable contribution on the far end 2-cyanoacetic acid unit, such that the excited electron can be injected into the TiO2 electrode effectively. In the frontier molecular orbitals, the overlap of the electron cloud is located at TPA part, which may facilitate the electron transfer from the donor to the anchor after photoexcitation.
To further study the optical properties of the dyes, we performed time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The TD-DFT results are in good agreement with the experimental spectra and show that the broad absorption bands observed in solution in fact consist of several singlet excitations (Table 2 and Fig. 6). The computations also highlight the electron donating character of DTF–TPA moiety toward excitation. The two lowest-lying electronic transitions, S1 (mainly HOMO → LUMO) and S2 (mainly HOMO → LUMO + 1), have significant oscillator strength (f) and extent of charge separation from the DTF–TPA part to the 2-cyanoacetic acid. This is consistent with the experimental results.

As can be seen from Fig. 7 and Table 3, without coadsorbent CDCA, the photovoltaic parameters of WD9, including Jsc, Voc, FF and η are not very good. Notably, when the alkyl chain length are increased to the dye molecules, DSSCs based on WD12 and WD13 showed higher Jsc and Voc than those of WD9. DSSC based on WD9 produced 3.18% of η (Jsc = 7.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 625 mV, FF = 0.71) while WD13 produced 4.62% of η (Jsc = 9.57 mA cm−2, Voc = 653 mV, FF = 0.74). These observations indicate the short circuit photocurrent as well as the open circuit voltage increase significantly with the increasing of chain length, leading to a linear increment in device efficiency with chain length.
To clarify the influence of the alkyl chain length of the dyes on the device performance, we have measured the amount of dyes adsorbed on TiO2 film. The adsorbed amounts of 1.63 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WD9, 1.52 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WD12, and 1.38 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WD13 are slightly decreasing. Therefore, it is obvious that the enhanced Jsc in the dyes with longer alkyl chains is not originated from their adsorbed amounts.34 Of particular importance is the 17 and 28 mV increase in Voc of WD12 and WD13-based cells relative to the WD9-based cell, which clearly suggests that the long alkyl chains in WD12 and WD13 can effectively enhance the device performance. We attribute these behaviors to the following reason: the long alkyl chains of the dyes can facilitate self-assembly and aggregate-free dye layer on the TiO2 surface, which are apt to obtain an insulating effect, thus blocking the recapture of the photoinjected electrons by triiodide ions. Therefore, the chain length exerts a strong influence on the blocking behavior of the dyes, explaining why the alkyl chain is longer and the efficiency observed for the cells is higher.
To further analyze the difference between the Jsc values of DSSCs based on the three dyes, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for DSSCs based on these dyes are plotted in Fig. 8. The onsets of the IPCE spectra for these dyes are significantly broadened compared to those of their UV-vis absorption spectra in methanol. The IPCE values changing tendency of these dyes are in accordance with their UV-vis absorption spectra in methanol. As shown in IPCE spectra, WD9 could efficiently convert the light to photocurrents in the region from 400 to 625 nm. Notably, WD12 and WD13 exhibited the broader region with photocurrent signal up to about 650 nm. Moreover, the IPCE curve of WD9 lies lower than those of WD12 and WD13. The maximum IPCE values of DSSCs based on WD9, WD12 and WD13 are 59.6, 64.8, and 75.1%, respectively. The high IPCE value and broader absorption of WD13 explained the high Jsc value from the J–V measurement.
 Fig. 8  IPCE curves of the DSSCs sensitized by all dyes. 
It is well-known that the IPCE of a solar cell is determined to some extent by light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (Φinj), and the electron collection efficiency (Φcol).42 In view of the light capture capabilities of the dyes (Fig. 2), LHE is not the determinant for inefficient quantum conversion. Moreover, the similar LUMO levels and the identical anchoring group of the dyes indicate that Φinj is also not the main cause. Therefore, we expect that low Φcol may lead to the disappointing IPCE plateau and photocurrent of WD9.43
Furthermore, to investigate the effect of the alkyl chain on the inhibition from dye aggregation, the TiO2 films were also co-sensitized with these dyes and CDCA for assembling the DSSCs. The relevant J–V, IPCE curves and photovoltaic data are also displayed in Fig. 7 and 8 and Table 3. With coadsorbent CDCA (10 mM in the dye solution), η was improved to 4.09% (Jsc = 8.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 641 mV, FF = 0.73) for WD9 due to the suppression of dye aggregation by coadsorption, but it was reduced to 4.37% (Jsc = 8.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 649 mV, FF = 0.75) for WD13 due to the decrease of loading dyes. Evidently, CDCA is necessary for WD9 but unnecessary for WD13 to improve efficiency. When adding the CDCA in dye bath, the performance of WD9 can be enhanced. However, for WD13, the Jsc decreased slightly with CDCA, resulting in a negative effect on η. These results are consistent with that of IPCE measurements (Fig. 8).
In a word, compared with WD9, the large enhancement by 45.2% (increased from η = 3.18–4.62%) in photovoltaic performance of WD13 can be attributed to the long alkyl chain by suppressing dye aggregation and retarding the charge recombination. The strategy of introducing longer alkyl chains to dye WD9 is quite successful in developing efficient coadsorbent-free organic sensitizers.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique of characterizing the important interfacial charge transfer and carrier transportation process in DSSCs.44,45 Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots for DSSCs based on these dyes measured under the dark.
 Fig. 9  EIS Nyquist (a) and Bode (b) plots for DSSCs based on all dyes under dark. 
In the Nyquist diagram (Fig. 9a), the larger semicircles in lower-frequency reflect the recombination resistance (Rrec) at TiO2–electrolyte interface. Obviously, the radius of the semicircles are decreased in the order of WD13 > WD12 > WD9, indicating that the device sensitized by WD13 exhibits the largest resistance between the TiO2 surface and electrolyte. Thus under the same working condition, it is reasonable to conclude that the electron density of the EC keep the trend WD13 > WD12 > WD9. As we know, the Voc is determined by the potential of the redox shuttle and the EF. According to the formula: EF = EC + kTln(nc/NC),46 where EF and EC are the Fermi energy and the conduction band edge energy, respectively, kT is the thermal energy, nc is the density of conduction band electrons, and NC is the effective density of conduction band states, we can conclude from the formula that the Voc could be in accordance with the trend of WD13 > WD12 > WD9. The results of Nyquist plots are in good agreement with Voc results of the DSSCs based on these dyes: WD13 (653 mV) > WD12 (642 mV) > WD9 (625 mV).
In the Bode plots (Fig. 9b), the lower-frequency peak is indicative of the charge-transfer process of injected electrons in TiO2. The highest Voc of DSSC based on WD13 can be further explained by electron lifetime, calculated through the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of lower-frequency range in Bode plot). For the three devices, the peak frequency of lower-frequency range are decreased in the order of WD9 > WD12 > WD13, and the electron lifetime is enhanced in reverse with the calculated values of 11.51, 18.16 and 25.23 ms, respectively. Thus, WD13 has the longest electron lifetime, indicative of a most effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc due to reduced charge recombination rate.
According to the EIS analysis, both the resistance for charge recombination and the electron lifetime are increased from WD9 to WD12 and WD13, indicating that the introduction of long alkyl chains to the DTF–TPA dyes is effective in TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface modification and Voc increase.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a series of DTF–TPA based organic dyes with different alkyl chains attached on DTF unit, and studied the influence of the alkyl chain length on the device performance in DSSCs. With the increase of chain length, the η of DSSC is improved, which can be attributed to the long alkyl chain by suppressing dye aggregation and retarding the charge recombination. An increase in η of about 45.2% was obtained from WD9 (methyl group) to WD13 (decyl chain). The η of WD9 is markedly increased by about 28.6% in the presence of CDCA as compared to that in the absence of CDCA. However, the η of WD13 is not dependent on CDCA and decreased by about 5.4% in the presence of CDCA. This result indicates that CDCA is not necessary to improve the efficiency of WD13, and that dye aggregation is efficiently inhibited by the long alkyl chain. Studies on EIS shows that both the resistance for charge recombination and the electron lifetime increased after the introduction of longer alkyl chains to the DTF–TPA dyes. This work indicates that the incorporation of longer alkyl chains into the DTF–TPA organic dyes is a promising way for efficient coadsorbent-free DSSCs.
