The π bridges between BDT and TPD were thiophene in PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD, and 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene in PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD. The effects of the π bridges on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated, in addition to the film crystallinities and carrier mobilities. Copolymers with the 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge exhibited high crystallinity and hole mobility. Improved Jsc and FF were obtained to increase the overall power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in inverted single organic photovoltaic cells. A PCE of 6.81% was achieved from the inverted single device fabricated using the PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM blend film with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane. A tandem photovoltaic device comprising the inverted PBDTT–ttTPD cell and a PTB7-based cell as the bottom and top cell components, respectively, showed a maximum PCE of 9.35% with a Voc of 1.58 V, a Jsc of 8.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74% under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The obtained PCE of the bottom cell and FF of the tandem cell are, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported to date for a tandem OPV device. This work demonstrates that PBDTT–ttTPD may be very promising for applications in tandem solar cells. Furthermore, 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge systems in medium bandgap polymers can improve the performance of tandem organic photovoltaic cells.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaic cells are a particularly attractive technology to convert solar energy into electricity because they can potentially be fabricated as large area devices at low cost using high yield roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. Tandem photovoltaic cells, wherein two single junction solar cells are connected in series by a conducting layer known as a recombination layer, have the potential of reaching higher performance than their single junction counterparts. This is because tandem solar cells can overcome many of the shortcomings of single junction solar cells, such as limited optical absorption and low open-circuit voltages. In this work, we designed a series of medium bandgap D–π–A system copolymers consisting of BDT and TPD units with a 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge, and then successfully tested these polymers in tandem cells as bottom cell materials. We found that using the 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge in place of the thiophene π-bridge to the TPD unit produced further improvement of the devices' FF, Jsc, and PCE due to the new polymers possessing higher absorption coefficients, enhanced crystallinity, and higher hole mobility values. In combination with the PTB7 polymer as the top cell material, the polymer PBDTT–ttTPD showed superior performance as the bottom cell material than P3HT:IC60BA, with inverted tandem OPVs showing high PCEs of up to 9.35%.

1. Introduction
In the past decade, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have been the focus of intense academic and industrial research, because of their potential applications as large-area, light-weight, and flexible photovoltaic devices made by inexpensive solution-processing techniques.1–3 The manufacturing of OPVs involves less cost and less energy than those of inorganic-based PV devices, which means that OPVs should achieve energy payback much sooner than the existing technologies, which advantage will increase dramatically if their current modest efficiency and lifetime can be improved.4 Recent analyses suggest that reduction in manufacturing costs offers the best way to significantly enhance the use of renewable energies such as wind or solar power,5 so the improvement of OPV efficiencies may have a significant role in fighting climate change by reducing the use of fossil fuels. Recently, significant improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs have been achieved because of the implementation of novel donor polymers, use of new device structures, optimization of fabrication processing techniques, and incorporation of effective interfacial layers.6–10 To date, PCEs of single-junction OPVs based on blends of newly developed low bandgap donor polymers and fullerene derivatives have exceeded 8%.11–13 Increasing the PCE by simultaneously improving the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of low bandgap polymers in single-junction OPVs remains a challenge, as it requires a trade-off between high voltage and high current, which limits the use of the full solar spectrum. As a result, multi-junction devices with a tandem structure, made by stacking two or more cells with BHJ layers having complementary absorption spectra, are considered a promising alternative to enhance the performance of OPVs.14,15 Generally, a double-junction tandem cell consists of a front cell with a medium bandgap material, an interconnecting layer, and a rear cell with a low bandgap material. As such, medium bandgap polymers with excellent photovoltaic properties are highly desirable in addition to high performance low bandgap polymers.16,17 However, compared to the extensive efforts put into developing low bandgap donor polymers, the exploration of medium bandgap polymers with suitable photovoltaic properties for tandem cells has been largely overlooked. The PCEs of bottom cells in reported tandem OPVs are around 6%, as summarized in Table 1. Improvements in the bottom cell efficiency could be important for enhanced PCEs of tandem OPVs.

Recently, a series of medium bandgap donor (D)–acceptor (A) copolymers using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (BDT) as the electron donor unit and N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as the electron acceptor unit were synthesized by several research groups.18,19 Ma et al. reported a TPD-based polymer PT8 (Eg ≈ 1.85 eV) that exhibited a PCE of 6.17%.20 Subsequently, Beaujuge et al. reported that the PCE of OPVs based on the same polymer backbone could reach as high as 8.5% when the alkyl side-chain lengths were optimized.21 Peng et al. reported a medium bandgap benzotriazole-based polymer PBDTFBZS, which showed a PCE of 6.18%.22 However, despite the high PCEs reported, studies regarding medium bandgap materials for tandem OPVs have remained relatively non-existent, probably because the formation of the recombination layer which connects the top and bottom cells in tandem OPV cells requires thermal treatment (100–150 °C).3,9 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a medium bandgap polymer most commonly used as a bottom cell material in tandem OPVs. In the case of P3HT, PCEs increase owing to its improved crystallinity after the thermal treatment, whereas for most reported medium bandgap D–A type polymers, the PCE decreases following heating.23 In other words, the following criteria are required for medium bandgap polymers used in the bottom cell in tandem OPVs: (1) strong UV-visible absorption between 300 and 700 nm, (2) high PCE in single cells, and (3) high thermal stability. Recently, we reported a difluorinated quinoxaline-based medium bandgap polymer, poly{4,8-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-6,7-difluoro-5,5-(5′,8′-di-2-thienyl-2,3-bis(4-octyloxyl)phenyl)-quinoxaline} (PTIPSBDT–DFDTQX), whose performance in tandem OPVs was at least equal to that of P3HT. The successful application of PTIPSBDT–DFDTQX in tandem OPVs has led to the best PCE to date, 7.40% (ref. 24).
In this work, we designed a series of medium bandgap D–π–A system copolymers composed of BDT and TPD units with a 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge, and successfully tested these polymers in tandem cells as bottom-cell materials. Using the 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge in place of the thiophene π-bridge led to an improvement in the devices' fill factor (FF), Jsc, and PCE due to the higher absorption coefficient, enhanced crystallinity, and higher hole mobility of the new polymers. Many groups have recently reported a dramatic improvement in the photovoltaic performance of D–π–A conjugated polymers via π-bridge engineering.25–27 Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridges enhance the photovoltaic properties of D–π–A copolymers by reducing their bandgaps to harvest solar light energy more effectively.25–27 At the same time, the UV-visible absorption of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-bridged polymers is red shifted compared to that of the corresponding thiophene-bridged polymers, which makes them less suitable as bottom-cell materials in tandem OPVs. Therefore, in this work, we introduced a 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge in order to induce a blue shift in the UV-visible absorption and utilized the steric effect of the alkyl chain. Based on the aforementioned merits of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges, we synthesized four medium bandgap conjugated polymers composed of alkyloxy-substituted BDT (BDT) or alkylthienyl-substituted BDT (BDTT) and thiophene π-bridged TPD (TPD) or 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridged TPD (tt-TPD) derivatives. Poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PBDT–TPD), poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(6-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PBDT–ttTPD), poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PBDTT–TPD), and poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(6-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione} (PBDTT–ttTPD) were synthesized as medium bandgap conjugated polymers for OPVs. Of these alternating copolymers, PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD showed excellent photovoltaic performance in single junction devices with PCEs over 6.81%. When PBDTT–ttTPD, which showed the highest PCE in single junction devices, was used as the active layer in the bottom cell of solution-processed inverted tandem photovoltaic cells, PCEs over 9.35% were achieved. The synthetic routes and chemical structures of the polymers are shown in Scheme 1 (synthetic routes to the monomers are shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI†).

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The synthesis of 1,3-bis(5-bromo-6-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (tt-TPD) is depicted in the Experimental section and monomers 2,6-bis-(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT), and 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) were synthesized according to reported methods.28,29 As shown in Scheme 1, PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD were synthesized by Stille coupling in high yields using palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) (Pd(PPh3)4) as the catalyst (Scheme 1). The crude copolymers were purified by successive washing with hot methanol, hexane, and acetone using a Soxhlet extractor. The copolymers were soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The structures of the copolymers were determined by elemental analysis and spectroscopy, which gave results consistent with the proposed structures. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with calibration against polystyrene standards. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD were found to be 26000, 33000, 25000, and 47000 g mol−1 with PDIs of 1.85, 1.94, 1.80, and 2.13, respectively.
The thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td; 5% weight loss) of 333, 393, 397, and 434 °C, respectively. tt-TPD-containing polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) showed higher Tds than the TPD-containing polymers. No clear phase transitions were observed for PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD in the DSC measurements up to 300 °C. Interestingly, clear melting temperatures (Tm) at 267 and 280 °C on the heating process, and recrystallization points (Tcr) at 262 and 266 °C on the cooling process were observed for PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD, respectively, indicating that the polymers are highly crystalline in nature. The molecular weights and thermal properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 2.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the absorption spectra of the copolymers in chloroform (1 mg per 100 mL) and as spin-coated films on quartz substrates. Table 2 summarizes the optical data including the absorption peak wavelengths (λabs), absorption edge wavelengths (λedge), and optical band gaps (Eoptg). All copolymers showed a distinct shoulder peak next to their absorption maxima in solution and as thin films, which was similar to those of TPD-based polymers.20,21 The absorption onsets of the resulting polymers in the thin films were slightly red shifted as compared to their absorption in solution. Notably, copolymers containing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges generally showed red shifts of about 20 nm in their absorption edges, as compared to analogous polymers containing thiophene π-bridges due to the stronger π–π stacking and more extended aromatic systems.25 However, in this work, the λedge only showed a 3–5 nm red shift from PBDT–TPD to PBDT–ttTPD and a 7 nm red shift from PBDTT–TPD to PBDTT–ttTPD, which could be attributed to the steric effect of the alkyl side chain in the 6-position of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. We also confirmed this through DFT calculations (as described below). The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridged polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) exhibited much higher absorption coefficients compared to the corresponding thiophene-bridged polymers (PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD), which is highly favorable for effectively harvesting solar photons and may potentially lead to more photo-induced carriers and higher Jsc values.25,30 The shapes of the absorption bands of the polymer films were quite similar to the absorption spectrum of a P3HT film (Eg ∼1.9 eV, Fig. 1(b)), indicating that the copolymers with a bandgap similar to that of P3HT could satisfy the requirement for bottom-cell materials in tandem OPVs. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the polymer thin films were determined from their UV-visible absorption edges to be 650 nm (1.91 eV) for PBDT–TPD, 653 nm (1.90 eV) for PBDT–ttTPD, 660 nm (1.88 eV) for PBDTT–TPD, and 667 nm (1.86 eV) for PBDTT–ttTPD.

To determine the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the resulting polymers, the electrochemical characteristics of the polymers films on a Pt electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) as the supporting electrolyte and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode.
To obtain the oxidation potentials, the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), which has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV with respect to the vacuum level; the potential of this external standard under the same conditions was 0.092 eV. Accordingly, the HOMO values (EHOMO) were calculated using the following equation: EHOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.70) eV, where Eonsetox is the onset oxidation potential versus Ag/Ag+. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD were 0.62, 0.58, 0.64, and 0.60, corresponding to HOMO energy levels of −5.32, −5.28, −5.34, and −5.30 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of BDTT-containing polymers (PBDTT–TPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) were ∼0.02 eV lower than those of the BDT-containing polymers (PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD).31 On the other hand, there was a considerable difference (∼0.04 eV) in the HOMO energy levels of PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD compared with PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD, indicating that the π-bridges had a more significant effect on the HOMO energy levels than the substituents on the BDT units of the D–π–A copolymers.25 In addition, the lower lying HOMO energy levels of PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD as compared to those of PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD were expected to increase the Voc of the OPVs utilizing them.14 Meanwhile, the LUMO levels of the polymers were determined from the HOMO levels obtained from the CV measurements and the Eoptg values obtained from the UV-visible absorption edges. The LUMO energy levels of PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD were very similar, suggesting that different π-bridges did not significantly affect the LUMO energy levels of the D–π–A polymers.25 The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were within a suitable range (from −3.38 to −3.46 eV) and were higher-lying than that of PC71BM (ca.−4.30 eV); thus, efficient charge transfer (exciton dissociation) could be expected in their corresponding devices.32 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are illustrated in Fig. 2. The UV-visible absorption properties, Eoptg values, and HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers are summarized in Table 2.

2.3. Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis sets to better understand the electronic structures of the polymer and, in particular, the effect of the introduction of the side chains onto the π-conjugated bridge units. Since it is impractical and prohibited to simulate real polymer molecules, D–A–D–A type dimeric model systems, BDT–ttTPD–BDT–ttTPD, BDTT–TPD–BDTT–TPD, and BDTT–ttTPD–BDTT–ttTPD, were employed instead. Though these calculations using the simple model compounds sometimes fail to capture many of the important physical characteristics of the polymers,33 they still provide useful information on trends in specific properties among the corresponding polymers. Calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 program package.34 The measured HOMO energy levels of the polymers were consistent with the simulation results for the corresponding model compounds. Our calculations indicated that the LUMOs were primarily localized at the TPD or ttTPD units, whereas the HOMOs were distributed along the entire molecules, as shown in Fig. 2. In the case of BDTT–TPD–BDTT–TPD and BDTT–ttTPD–BDTT–ttTPD, the wave functions of the HOMO energy levels were delocalized onto their thienyl side chains, implying that the π-electrons were delocalized by the introduction of the 2D conjugated structure. The resulting extension in the conjugation decreased the bandgap of the polymers, resulting in the improved absorption of light at long wavelengths.
Dihedral angles between composing donor and acceptor units were calculated to assess the impact of side chains on the conformational structures of polymers (Table S1 in the ESI†). In the case of BDT–TPD dimeric units, the dihedral angles A1, A2, and A3 were calculated to be 16.66°, 3.72°, and 10.74°, respectively. Similarly, those of the BDTT–TPD dimer were 21.73°, 13.31°, and 1.89°, respectively. This means TPD-containing polymers with the thiophene bridge possess a relatively planar structure. Upon replacing TPD units with ttTPD ones, on the other hand, dihedral angles between composing units notably increase to be in the range of 35.76° to 47.19°, which points to the steric hindrance induced by alkyl side chains on the thiophene bridge. In addition, the presence of side chains on the bridge also appears to influence backbone linearity; polymers with TPD units are rather straight while their ttTPD counterparts are a bit curvy. These structural changes make their UV-visible spectrum similar to that of P3HT; however, the impacts of side chains turned out not to be such severe that film crystallinity and charge carrier mobility remain high.
2.4. Performances and film morphologies of inverted single layer BHJ OPVs
To demonstrate the potential applications of the conjugated polymers PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD in inverted OPVs, we utilized PC71BM as an electron acceptor, and a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/electron transport layer (ETL)/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. In this work, ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE)35,36 and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were used as the ETLs. We investigated the performance of the inverted OPV materials under a variety of conditions (see the ESI†). The active layers were spin-coated from a solution of the donor polymers and acceptor in chloroform. For inverted OPVs based on PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD, the ratio of the polymer to PC71BM was adjusted from 1.0:0.8 to 1.0:1.5 (w/w); the optimized weight ratio between the copolymer and PC71BM was 1.0:1.0. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO, 3 vol%) was used as a processing additive to optimize the morphology of the active blend (for details, please see the ESI†).37 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and device performance data are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 3(a), PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD devices fabricated with a PEIE electron transport layer exhibited moderate PCEs of 3.84, 5.57, 4.22, and 6.63%, respectively. Thiophene-π-bridged polymers (PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD) exhibited a Voc of 0.85 and 0.86 V, which was ∼0.04 V higher than that of 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-π-bridged polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) and could be attributed to the lower lying HOMO energy level. However, higher photocurrents, superior fill factors, and enhanced device performances were obtained from 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-π-bridged polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD). Generally, the Jsc of OPVs is affected by many factors including the absorption properties of the blending layer, charge carrier mobility, crystallinity, and morphology. Interestingly, the Jsc of OPVs based on 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridged polymers increased from 6.70 to 9.69 mA cm−2, and from 6.72 to 11.49 mA cm−2, which was consistent with the other trends observed depending on the π-bridge. The difference in the Jsc values of the devices likely originated from the different polymer crystallinities, charge carrier mobilities, and p–n heterojunction morphologies of the active layers.
Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) was performed in order to gain insight into the characteristics of the polymer nanostructures in the pure and blend films including the crystallite orientation, crystal coherence length, and intermolecular distance.21,38Fig. 4 shows the 2D-GIXD images of the pure polymers and polymer:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blends. Fig. 4(b) and (d) show the 2D-GIXD images of the PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD films. Interestingly, the PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD films showed (100), (200), and (300) peaks with pronounced reflections, indicating that the polymer stacks in the film had a high degree of structural organization. The PBDT–ttTPD film showed an intense X-ray reflection at Qz = 0.30 Å−1, which corresponded to the (100) crystal peak with a layer spacing, d(100), of 20.9 Å. Additionally, a strong X-ray reflection peak corresponding to the (010) crystal planes stacked via intermolecular π–π interactions was located at Qz = 1.68 Å−1, which indicated a d(010) of 3.74 Å. Similarly, the 2D-GIXD pattern of the PBDTT–ttTPD film showed reflection peaks along the Qz axis with measured d(100) and d(010) values of 20.2 and 3.73 Å, respectively. By contrast, the 2D-GIXD patterns of the PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD films showed only diffuse rings at both low and high Q values without any crystal diffraction, indicating that PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD had amorphous-like structures in the films (Fig. 4(a) and (c)). Fig. 4(e)–(h) present the 2D-GIXD results for the polymer/PC71BM blend films. The 2D-GIXD patterns of the PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1 w/w) films clearly display enhanced crystallinity and indicate that the polymer chain in the blend film is primarily oriented “face-on” with respect to the substrate (Fig. 4(f) and (h)). The 2D-GIXD images of the active layers provide evidence for the origin of the higher Jsc values of the OPV devices fabricated using PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM as compared to those of the devices fabricated using PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD:PC71BM.

To elucidate the hole conduction properties of the OPV devices, we fabricated hole-only devices composed of the pure polymer and blend films and determined their hole mobilities using space charge limited current (SCLC). The hole mobilities of the pure PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD films were 1.34 × 10−5, 2.41 × 10−4, 3.90 × 10−5, and 7.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, at an electric field of 500 (V cm−1)1/2, as shown in Fig. 5. The measured hole mobilities of the PBDT–TPD:PC71BM (1:1, w/w), PBDT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1, w/w), PBDTT–TPD:PC71BM (1:1, w/w), and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) blends were 4.73 × 10−6, 2.53 × 10−5, 6.20 × 10−6, and 3.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. According to the 2D-GIXD analysis, 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-π-bridged polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) demonstrated high crystallinity, while thiophene π-bridged polymers (PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD) were amorphous or only weakly crystalline. We would expect that the films with a higher crystallinity and “face-on” orientation (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM) would induce a higher hole mobility than the PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD:PC71BM films in the vertically structured OPV cells. Therefore, the measured SCLC mobilities were consistent with the crystal structures of the active layers. The higher hole mobility of the 6-alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-π-bridged polymers (PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD) were also consistent with their higher Jsc and FF values, as compared to those of the corresponding devices using PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD. The mobilities extracted from SCLC are summarized in Table S5 in the ESI.†

The increase in the PCE originated from the introduction of the ZnO NP ETL layer (ca. 30 nm). ZnO NPs were used as the electron-transport material because their work-function matches well with the acceptors and because of their high electron mobility.9 The ZnO NP devices fabricated using PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD exhibited an increased FF. As shown in Fig. 3(b), PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD devices fabricated with a ZnO NP electron transport layer exhibited moderate PCEs of 3.99, 6.09, 4.40, and 6.81%, respectively. Notably, the FF of 73% is among the highest values ever reported for regular single layer OPVs, suggesting that no significant carrier recombination loss occurred within the active layer upon addition of DIO.22
A well-organized p–n heterojunction of the active layer is important for efficient charge dissociation and transport.39 Energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) images and nitrogen mapping electron spectroscopy imaging (ESI) images were obtained to investigate the morphology of the active layers (polymer:PC71BM = 1:1 w/w) processed with 3 vol% DIO. In the zero-loss TEM images (Fig. 6(a)–(d)), the dark and light regions correspond to PC71BM and polymer domains, respectively, while the light regions correspond to the position of nitrogen atoms in the nitrogen mapping ESI images (Fig. 6(a′)–(d′)). PBDT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1 w/w, 3 vol% DIO) and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1 w/w, 3 vol% DIO) blend films (Fig. 6(b and b′) and (d and d′)) contained a uniform and well-organized bi-continuous network, indicating suitable miscibility between the alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridged polymers and PC71BM. By contrast, the PBDT–TPD:PC71BM (1:1 w/w, 3 vol% DIO) and PBDTT–TPD:PC71BM (1:1 w/w, 3 vol% DIO) blend films (Fig. 6(a and a′) and (c and c′)) exhibited much larger p–n junction domains. These large-scale domains are not favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and lead to relatively low Jsc values. The TEM results also supported the higher Jsc of the devices fabricated using alkyl-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridged polymers as compared to the devices containing thiophene π-bridged polymers.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured to further confirm the accuracy of the measurements. The EQE curves are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). All devices exhibited efficient photo-conversion efficiencies in the wavelength range of 400–650 nm, with EQE values of 40–70%. The Jsc values of all devices integrated from the EQE curves were consistent (less than 5% error) with the values obtained by the J–V measurements.
2.5. Performance of inverted tandem photovoltaic cells
The versatile photovoltaic applications of PBDTT–ttTPD were demonstrated by its use in solution-processed inverted tandem photovoltaic cells. As mentioned above, the tandem photovoltaic cell architecture, which consists of a bottom cell with a medium bandgap material, a charge recombination layer, and a top cell with a low bandgap material, is an effective way to harvest more of the solar spectrum and make more efficient use of the photonic energy as compared to regular single junction structures. In this paper, we report a highly efficient solution-processed inverted tandem device fabricated using PBDTT–ttTPD in place of P3HT as the bottom cell active material. Recently, other groups reported high PCEs from OPVs using the low bandgap polymer poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}-alt-{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7). PTB7 has a low bandgap of 1.55 eV and broad light absorption in the range of 300–800 nm. Inverted OPVs using this polymer produced PCEs of ∼9.0%.40 Accordingly, in this study, we used PTB7 as the top cell low bandgap material in inverted tandem OPVs. In order to compare the bottom cell properties of P3HT and PBDTT–ttTPD as the bottom cell materials, we also fabricated P3HT:IC60BA-based tandem OPV devices.
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the inverted tandem OPVs fabricated for this study had an inverted architecture with a conducting polymer layer of PEDOT:PSS coated with ZnO NPs as the charge recombination layer. The structure of the fabricated tandem OPVs was ITO/ZnO NPs/P3HT:IC60BA or PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO NPs/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The J–V characteristics of the tandem OPVs and performance parameters are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 4. The device based on P3HT:IC60BA-based tandem OPVs exhibited a PCE of 8.47% with Voc = 1.56 V, Jsc = 8.12 mA cm−2, and FF = 67%. On the other hand, the PBDTT–ttTPD-based tandem cells exhibited maximum PCEs as high as 9.35%, and devices with a Voc of 1.58 V, a Jsc of 8.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of greater than 74% were achieved. All devices showed a Voc of 1.58 V, which was equal to the sum of the bottom and top cell voltages. In addition, a Jsc of 8.00 mA cm−2 and a FF above 74% were achieved, which led to high PCEs for the inverted tandem devices. Notably, the difference in FF between the tandem and single cells was not as big as that between the regular single junction devices (73% for bottom cells and 73% for tandem cells), because the FF of a tandem device is determined by the combined behavior of the two sub-cells.

The optimization of tandem cells requires matching the photocurrents of the two component cells. In this work, PBDTT–ttTPD showed superior performance as a bottom cell material as compared to P3HT:IC60BA. The PCE of the bottom cell in the tandem cell (6.81%) is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest ever reported in tandem OPV devices. Moreover, the FF of the fabricated tandem cell is also the highest reported for tandem OPVs.
To further confirm the Jsc, the EQEs of the two sub-cells in the tandem device were measured using a previously reported method. The EQE curves of P3HT:IC60BA/PTB7:PC71BM and PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM/PTB7:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). The bottom cell with a P3HT:IC60BA-based tandem OPV exhibited quantum efficiency from 300 to 650 nm, with a maximum EQE of 70% at about 520 nm; the integrated Jsc was calculated to be 8.17 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the PBDTT–ttTPD-based tandem OPV exhibited a maximum quantum efficiency from 300 to 700 nm, with a maximum EQE of 71% at about 550 nm; the integrated Jsc was calculated to be 10.16 mA cm−2. The top cell based on PTB7 exhibited a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm. The maximum EQE was over 60% from 650 to 750 nm. From the EQE curve, the integrated Jsc was determined to be 7.70 (P3HT-based tandem cell) and 7.35 mA cm−2 (PBDTT–ttTPD-based tandem cell). A tandem cell's current is typically determined by the sub-cell with the lowest Jsc. Therefore, the measured Jsc of 8.00 mA cm−2 was very close to the integrated Jsc of 7.35 mA cm−2 from the top cell. PTB7 used as the top cell showed a narrower absorption region as compared to other reported top cell materials, which explains the low Jsc value. In other words, if the low bandgap polymer used in the top cell can absorb strongly up to 900 nm, a tandem OPV with record efficiency should be obtained.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a series of D–π–A copolymers based on BDT donor units and TPD acceptor units with thiophene and 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges (PBDT–TPD, PBDT–ttTPD, PBDTT–TPD, and PBDTT–ttTPD) by Pd-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization for applications in solution-processed tandem OPVs. The only structural difference between the four polymers is that PBDT–ttTPD and PBDTT–ttTPD bear a 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge as opposed to a thiophene π-bridge as in PBDT–TPD and PBDTT–TPD. The novel polymers all showed a medium bandgap, high crystallinity, and high hole mobility, suggesting that they can produce high Jsc, and high FF values in photovoltaic devices fabricated using different combinations of the polymers with fullerene derivatives. A power conversion efficiency of 6.81% was achieved from the regular inverted single device based on a PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM blend film with 3 vol% DIO. In combination with PTB7 as the top cell material, PBDTT–ttTPD exhibited a superior performance as a bottom cell material as compared to P3HT:IC60BA with inverted tandem OPVs, showing high PCEs of up to 9.35%. Consequently, our design strategy was proven to be a feasible and successful approach to develop efficient photovoltaic polymers. Moreover, PBDTT–ttTPD is a promising polymer donor with potential for commercial applications in large-area tandem OPVs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
All organic starting materials were purchased from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or TCI Korea and were used without further purification. Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)chloride and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) were purchased from Strem. [6,6]-Phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was purchased from EM-index. Solvents were dried and purified by fractional distillation over sodium/benzophenone and handled under a moisture-free atmosphere. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60 63-200 MYM SC). 1,3-Dibromo-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione, 2,6-bis-(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) were synthesized according to methods described in previous reports.9,40
Measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus 300 MHz spectrometer and the chemical shifts were recorded in units of ppm with chloroform as the internal standard. Elemental analysis was carried out using a Vario Micro Cube in the Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan, Korea). Absorption spectra were measured using a JASCO JP/V-570 model. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) relative to a polystyrene standard using a Waters high-pressure GPC assembly (model M590). Thermal analyses were carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e under a N2 atmosphere at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyzer. The CV measurements were carried out in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumtetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) as the supporting electrolyte using Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a platinum working electrode. The nanoscale morphology of the polymer films was measured using an Ultra Corrected Energy Filtering Transmission Electron Microscope (UC-EF-TEM) (Libra 200 HT Mc Cs TEM, (200 kV, Carl Zeiss)).
Two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) experiments
Two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were performed under vacuum at the 3C beamline in the Pohang Light Source, Korea. To obtain results comparable to those of the OPV devices, the samples were prepared on PEDOT:PSS-modified Si substrates under the same conditions as those used for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The wavelength of the X-ray was 0.1651 nm and the incidence angle (the angle between the critical angle of the sample and that of Si) was 0.13°. The 2D-GIXD patterns were recorded using a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165), and the X-ray irradiation time was set at 0.5–10 s depending on the saturation level of the detector. The 2D-GIXD images from the films were analyzed according to the relationship between the scattering vector q and the d spacing, q = 2π/d.
Fabrication of inverted photovoltaic devices

Inverted PEIE-based devices. 
Inverted BHJ OPV devices with ITO/PEIE (ethoxylated polyethylenimine)/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structures were fabricated. The PEIE solution was spin-coated on ITO substrates at a speed of 5000 rpm for 1 min at an acceleration of 1000 rpm s−1 and the substrates were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min on a hot plate in ambient air. The thickness of PEIE was estimated to be 10 nm. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glove box. The polymer:PC71BM active layer was prepared by spin coating the solution (97% chloroform–3% DIO mixture) at a speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s. The device was solvent-annealed for 1 h at ambient temperature in the glove box. After spin-coating the active layer, the samples were transferred into the evaporation chamber for fabrication of the MoO3/Ag electrode as the anode in vacuo at a base pressure of 3 × 10−6 Torr. The effective area of the device was 0.09 cm2.


Inverted ZnO NP-based devices. 
Inverted BHJ OPV devices with ITO/ZnO NPs/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structures were fabricated. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were first treated with ultraviolet–ozone for 15 min. ZnO NPs were spin-coated on the ITO substrates. The synthetic process of ZnO NPs can be found in reports by You et al.,41 Sun and Sirringhaus,42 and Beek et al.43 The active layer was spin-coated on the ZnO surface, after the active layer and MoO3/Ag were fabricated in similar ways according to the methods described in inverted PEIE-based devices. The effective area of the device was 0.09 cm2.

Inverted tandem cells
The device architecture of the tandem photovoltaic cell is shown in Fig. 7. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV–ozone. PBDTT–ttTPD:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) in chloroform with DIO or P3HT:IC60BA (1:1, w/w) in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was spin-coated on top of a layer of ZnO. The films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS (modified using the method described in ref. 41) was spin-coated on the first active layer and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. A thin layer of the ZnO film was then spin-cast, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the top active layer of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w in chlorobenzene with 3 vol% DIO) was deposited by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 20 s. The thickness of PTB7:PC71BM was estimated to be 100 nm. The device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag as the anode under vacuum at a base pressure of 3 × 10−6 Torr. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.09 cm2.
Measurements of OPV devices
The thickness of the active layer was measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-step IQ surface profilometer. The current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the polymer photovoltaic cells were determined by illuminating the cells with simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using an Oriel 1000 W solar simulator. Electronic data were recorded using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit. The measurements were carried out after masking all but the active cell area of the fabricated device. All characterizations were carried out under ambient conditions. The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector from PV Measurements Inc., which was calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The EQE was measured as a function of wavelength in the range between 300 and 1100 nm using a xenon short arc lamp as the light source (McScience K3100 EQX); calibration was performed using a Si reference photodiode. Characterization was performed under ambient conditions. To measure the EQE of tandem cells, a chopper and a lock-in amplifier were connected to the Xe lamp as a main light source while a bias light was illuminated to the other sub-cell. The EQE was selectively extracted from each sub-cell in the tandem device using a halogen lamp (LEESOS (Inc.)) as the bias light source with a light intensity of about 14.64 mW cm−2. The wavelength of the bias light was controlled with optical filters (MONOCLE). The EQEs of the bottom sub-cell and the top sub-cell in the tandem device were obtained using a longpass filter (>700 nm) and a shortpass filter (<700 nm), respectively.
Mobility measurements
The hole mobilities of the active layer were determined by applying the space charge limited current (SCLC) model to the J–V measurements of the devices. Hole-only devices of the polymers were fabricated on top of a pre-patterned ITO substrate. After cleaning the ITO with aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol, UV–ozone treatment was applied for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios™ P VP AI4083) was spin-coated from an aqueous dispersion to form a 30 nm-thick layer. The coated substrate was then baked at 120 °C for 60 min. After baking, a solution of the copolymer in chloroform was spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce a layer with a thickness of 90 nm, and the samples were dried for 6 h at room temperature under vacuum. The device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Al as the anode in vacuo at a base pressure of 3 × 10−6 Torr. A similar method was employed to measure the hole only mobility of the polymer:PC71BM blend through the SCLC method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Au. The hole mobilities were calculated from the SCLC using the following equation:JSCLC = (9/8)εrε0μ(V2/L3)where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymers, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, μ is the hole mobility, L is the film thickness of the blend films, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in voltage which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and cathode.

The reaction mixture was cooled to approximately 50 °C and 200 mL of methanol was added slowly under vigorous stirring. The polymer fibers were collected by filtration and were re-precipitated from methanol and acetone. The polymers were then purified further by washing for 1 day in a Soxhlet apparatus with acetone to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. Column chromatography with chloroform was then performed. Re-precipitation in chloroform/methanol was repeated several times. The resulting polymers were soluble in common organic solvents.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaic cells are a particularly attractive technology to convert solar energy into electricity because they can potentially be fabricated as large area devices at low cost using high yield roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. Tandem photovoltaic cells, wherein two single junction solar cells are connected in series by a conducting layer known as a recombination layer, have the potential of reaching higher performance than their single junction counterparts. This is because tandem solar cells can overcome many of the shortcomings of single junction solar cells, such as limited optical absorption and low open-circuit voltages. In this work, we designed a series of medium bandgap D–π–A system copolymers consisting of BDT and TPD units with a 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge, and then successfully tested these polymers in tandem cells as bottom cell materials. We found that using the 6-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge in place of the thiophene π-bridge to the TPD unit produced further improvement of the devices' FF, Jsc, and PCE due to the new polymers possessing higher absorption coefficients, enhanced crystallinity, and higher hole mobility values. In combination with the PTB7 polymer as the top cell material, the polymer PBDTT–ttTPD showed superior performance as the bottom cell material than P3HT:IC60BA, with inverted tandem OPVs showing high PCEs of up to 9.35%.
