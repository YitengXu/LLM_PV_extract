    , Accepted 16th April 2018First published on 18th April 2018AbstractRecently, two-dimensional (2D) layered organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted a huge amount of interest due to their unique layered structure, and potential optical properties. However, amongst researchers it has long been disputed as to whether it is suitable for use as a photovoltaic material or light-emitting device. Here, we present a detailed theoretical investigation to discuss the photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties of a novel synthetic 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. Based on the calculated geometric and electronic structure, charge carrier mobilities of the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 are predicted theoretically. In addition, the linear dichroism and exciton binding energies are also calculated. We found that the carrier mobilities of the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 reach the same order of magnitude as those of the optoelectronic material MoS2, but smaller than those of the photovoltaic material MAPbI3 and Si crystal, whereas exciton binding energies (Eb) enlarge with the thinning layers, being obviously higher than MAPbI3 and Si crystal. Moreover, the system exhibits a strong linear dichroism, suggesting weak absorption along the c axis in the visible spectrum, which is detrimental to photovoltaics. Our work provides a theoretical basis to prove that ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials may be potential candidates for optoelectronic detection devices, rather than solar absorbers.
1. Introduction
Three dimensional (3D) hybrid halide perovskites have achieved great success in the field of photovoltaics due to their superior photovoltaic properties, such as the tunable band gap,1,2 long electron–hole diffusion lengths,3,4 low recombination rates5 and their low-cost manufacture.6 Until now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 has only reached 22%,7 and it has only taken 3 years to reach the same efficiency as the typical photovoltaic silicon-based solar cell.8 Despite these achievements, three dimensional hybrid perovskite also faces a severe challenge, device degrading and performance regression when exposed to the oxygen and moisture. Inspired and motivated by the great success of the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),9,10 black phosphorus,11 boron nitride (BN) and graphene12 in the field of optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs) and photodetectors, many researchers have begun to focus on ultrathin 2D hybrid perovskites. Experimentally, Yang et al. first reported the colloidal synthesis of single- and few-unit-cell thick single-crystalline 2D perovskites (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4, confirming the presence of 2D perovskites by separating the individual layers of PbBr4−.13 They proposed that the electronic structure of 2D perovskite differs from the bulk crystal due to the structural relaxation. Tsai et al. fabricated near-single-crystalline 2D perovskites (BA)2PbI4 and gained an efficiency of about 12% when used as solar absorbers, demonstrating 2D perovskite is more stable with a high efficiency.14 In addition, the light–matter interaction, photoluminescence, and photoresponse of 2D perovskite are also reported in some references, suggesting 2D perovskites can be suitable for optoelectronic detection devices.15–17 In theory, Liu et al. have explored the electronic structures and optical properties of (MA)2PbI4, indicating the thin 2D film can be used as highly-efficient solar absorbers.18 Zeng et al. investigated the single layered BA2GeI4 and BA2SnI4, indicating the potential application for photovoltaic or light emitting devices due to the suitable band gap and exciton effect.19,20 Xiao et al. predicted that the 2D perovskite seem to be a weak candidate for a high-efficiency solar cell, limited to the low electronic dimension.21,22 Zhang et al. have explored the intrinsic properties of 2D layered perovskite Cs2PbI4 and (MA)2PbI4, and they investigated how the band gaps, Rashba spin-splitting, and charge effective masses vary with layers of N, indicating the ultrathin 2D materials appear to be an effective candidate for nano-optoelectronic detection devices.23
As discussed above, there has been controversy over whether 2D layered perovskite is more suitable for photovoltaic solar cells or optoelectronic detection devices. Focusing on this topic, this paper strives to cover the deficiencies of previous work, which mainly emphasize the direct observation of the macro performance, such as the photoelectric conversion efficiency, luminescence efficiency as solar cells or as a light-emitting device. The paper is organized as follows: (1) firstly, charge carrier mobilities are predicted quantitatively, as charge transport properties are the key factors governing semiconductor devices. Previous theoretical work is inadequate as charge transport properties of 2D perovskite have only been evaluated by effective masses. (2) Exciton binding energies of the ultrathin 2D perovskite will be discussed in detail, as this property directly determines the electron–hole pair recombination rates, thus influencing diffusion length. As far as we know, the exciton binding energies for a 2D layered perovskite system have never been analyzed theoretically previously. (3) Investigations on the optical properties, for example the linear dichroism, are still lacking for 2D layered perovskites, which can also be utilized to assess the photovoltaic performance. In other primary 2D materials, for example MoS2 and black phosphorus, the linear dichroism has been theoretically discussed in detail.24
In this paper, we focus on the novel 2D layered phenylethylammonium lead halide perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 and construct the model previously synthesized by Yang et al.25 By using the first principle calculations, geometric and electronic structures are investigated by varying the layers (N). The charge carrier mobilities along with elastic modulus C2D, deformation potential E1, and relaxation time τ of the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 are quantitatively analyzed with variation of the number of atomic layers. In addition, linear dichroism of incident light and exciton binding energies are discussed in detail. Taking (PEA)2PbI4 as the representative 2D layered perovskite, we compared the transport and optical properties and exciton energies with those of typical optoelectronic materials, MoS2 and graphene, and with the photovoltaic materials CH3NH3PbI3 and Si crystal to summarize the merits and demerits, hoping to provide a theoretical basis to clarify the dispute between the photovoltaic or the optoelectronic.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Geometric structure
Starting from the experimental data, the optimized atomic structure of the bulk and 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are shown in Fig. 1a and b.25 While modelling the single or few layered two dimensional perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, a 15 Å vacuum was added along c axis to prevent neighboring slabs from interacting. In Fig. 1b, we defined one layer as a sandwich, where the organic groups PEA in the middle are clamped by the bilateral octahedral PbI6− framework, and the symmetrical surface can eliminate the influence of polarization. Fig. 1b demonstrates a total of three layers here. Fig. 1c presents the schematic diagram of the minimum unit, where the molecular formula (PEA)2PbI4 consists of an inorganic octahedral framework PbI6− and an organic group PEA, where the organic group PEA is made up of toluene (C6H5CH3) and methylamino (MA = CH3NH3). Fig. 1d shows the First Brillouin zone (FBZ) of the bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, in which the high-symmetric k points are taken from the Material studio software to calculate the band structure. The G–X and G–Y in reciprocal space indicates the a and b direction in the real space for considering the calculation of the transport property along these two directions. Table S1† lists the calculated lattice parameters of the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4, varying from one to three layer with different thickness, as well as the bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. The optimized lattice parameters a (8.55 Å) and b (9.15 Å) of the bulk (PEA)2PbI4 agree well with the experimental data a (8.79 Å) and b (9.39 Å) within only 2.5% and 2.7% deviations, respectively. When the thickness of the hybrid perovskite sheets increases from one layer to three layer, the lattice constant a and b expand from 8.30 Å, 8.97 Å to 8.34 Å, 9.00 Å, respectively owing to the structural relaxation. This change has also been observed in a similar system, (BA)2PbBr4−, and has also been reported in the literature.13 However, the interplayer distance Δc oscillates near 14.44 Å revealing the interaction force of the adjacent atomic layer has hardly changed.

2.2 Electronic structure and charge carrier mobility

Fig. 2a demonstrates an atomic structure of a 2D few-layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 in the a–b plane, where the primitive cell is enclosed with red lines and the axis directions are indicated by the red arrows a0, b0. Fig. 2b shows the calculated band structure of the bulk and 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. The system has a direct band gap at the high symmetric G point, and the band gap increases from 1.63 eV to 2.02 eV when the thickness decreases in the 2D layered perovskite, as shown in Fig. 2c. Our calculated band gaps for the 2D monolayer and bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are 2.02 eV and 2.08 eV, respectively, which are consistent with those of a monolayer (2.24 eV) and bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 (2.36 eV) reported in previous work.26,27 On the one hand, the reason for the band gap decreasing with the increasing number of layers in the 2D layered perovskite can be attributed to the structural change. On the other hand, the wider band gap 2.02 eV for the monolayer perovskite is due to the elimination of the conduction band minimum (CBM) owing to the lack of middle layer inorganic parts PbI6−, as the band edges of the CBM are mainly occupied by the electronic states of iodine and lead atoms in the middle layer. Fig. S1a† clearly exhibits that the edge states of the monolayer near the conduction band are much less, compared with the edge states of the bilayer and trilayer perovskite shown in Fig. S1b and c, and Fig. S2† provides the interpretation. Here, we calculated the band structures by using a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) potential, as the functional has been proven to evaluate the band gap with a relatively high accuracy for Pb-based perovskites.28 Based on the electronic structure, the charge carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 were evaluated according to eqn (1): . Fig. 2d and e present the band edge energy of the valence band minimum (VBM) and CBM shift of the monolayer perovskite at the high symmetric G point as the function of the dilated lattice along the a, b direction according to eqn (2), and the slope is the deformation potential constant E1. Fig. 2f shows the total energy as the function of the lattice dilation with parabola fittings along the a and b directions according to eqn (3), which gives the elastic modulus C2D. The computational details for the corresponding deformation potential (DP) constant E1 and stretching modulus C2D of bilayer and trilayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are given in Fig. S3 and S4.†

Solid lines represent the linear fit, which defines DP constants. (f) The total energy related to the lattice deformation along the a and b directions. Solid lines indicates parabola fittings, which give elastic modulus C2D. 

Fig. 3a shows the calculated DP constants E1 enlarge as the number of layers increases. The value of the DP constants E1 for the electron increases from 7.7 eV to 9.9 eV along the a direction, while the value varies from 7.328 eV to 8.4 eV along the b direction with the layers changing from a monolayer to a trilayer. For the hole, the value also exhibits a linear positive correction with the number of layers (6.374–10.82 eV) in the a–b plane. The results reveal that the DP constants E1 for the monolayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are a little larger than those of other primary single layer 2D materials such as phosphorus24 (about 2–5 eV), or graphdiyne sheet29 (2–6 eV) (see Table S2†). By fitting the band edge according to eqn (4), the electron and hole effective masses of the 2D layered and bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 were calculated, as shown in Fig. 3b. The results show the charge carrier effective masses of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 basically decrease with the increment of layers (N) due to the more disperse band edge at the high symmetric G point. Except for the values along the a direction, the electron–hole effective masses (0.45–0.76m0) of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are larger than those of the monolayer MoS230 (0.46–0.60m0) and bulk MAPbI331 (0.26m0 for the electron, 0.30m0 for the hole). Fig. 3c shows that the stretching modulus C2D of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 varies when the number of layers changes. The results reveal that the stretching modulus C2D of the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 enlarges from 284 N m−1, 209 N m−1 to 626 N m−1, 599 N m−1 along the a, b direction, respectively, as the thickness increases from the monolayer to the trilayer. The values for the 2D layered (PEA)2PbI4 along two directions are larger than those of the primary monolayer 2D materials: graphdiyne (145 N m−1, 158 N m−1),29 MoS2 (127 N m−1, 128 N m−1)30 and phosphorous (29 N m−1, 102 N m−1)22 (see Table S2†), contributing to the improvement of the transport property. In order to interpret the difference of deformation potential E1 between the electron and the hole, the charge density of the VBM and the CBM for the monolayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 at the high symmetric G point were calculated, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. Here we can see the VBM is composed of a Pb s orbital and an I p orbital where the hybrization states between the s and p orbital are localized, whereas the CBM is occupied by the Pb p orbital solely, and the electronic states in the conduction band are delocalized. Thus, the localized VBM (hole state) is scattered more strongly by the acoustic phonon than the CBM (electron state), hence resulting in larger DP constants E1.

Fig. 4a and b exhibit the electron and hole carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 with the variation of layers based on the calculated variable E1, m*, C2D, in comparison with those of the monolayer MoS2,30 bulk MAPbI332 and Si crystal.33 The electron mobilities for the monolayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are from 459 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the a axis and 95 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the b axis, increasing to 731 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 591 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the trilayer, respectively, while the hole carrier mobilities increase from 241 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 114 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 301 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the a axis and 207 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the b axis for the trilayer, respectively. The electron and hole carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 along the a, b axis are obviously a little smaller than those of the 3D MAPbI3 (1500 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron, 800 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole) and Si crystal (1350 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron, 480 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole). Comparing with the monolayer MoS2, the electron and hole carrier mobilities for the monolayer (PEA)2PbI4 along the a axis are both larger, while the hole carrier mobility along the b axis is a little smaller than that of the monolayer MoS2 (152 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole). The smaller hole carrier mobility of the monolayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is mainly due to the larger deformation potential E1 (7.572 eV) and effective mass m* (0.67m0) compared with the smaller values (5.77 eV for E1, 0.60m0 for m*) of the monolayer MoS2. It is well known that MAPbI3 and Si crystal are superior photovoltaic materials, and that MoS2 is an excellent nano optoelectronic material, thus the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 may not be considered as a suitable photovoltaic material in terms of the charge transport properties. All of the calculated values for the DP constants E1, stretching modulus C2D, effective masses (, ) and charge carrier mobility μ of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, graphdiyne, phosphorous, MoS2, MAPbI3 and Si crystal are listed in Table 1 and Table S2, and the computational details are also provided in the ESI.†

2.3 Exciton binding energies and optical properties
Exciton binding energies (Eb) are calculated according to eqn (5) as the exciton energies directly influence the electron–hole pair recombination rates and diffusion length. Fig. 5a shows the calculated Eb of the ground state (n = 1) for the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 in comparison with those of Si, MAPbI3 crystal and the 2D layered perovskite (C6H13CH3)PbI4. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Eb of perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 decreases from the monolayer (272 meV) to the bulk (193 meV) when the layers increase, and this variation trend from the monolayer to the bulk for (PEA)2PbI4 is in agreement with the previous experiments for similar 2D layered perovskite (C6H13CH3)PbI4.34 These values are much larger than those of the Si (20 meV) and MAPbI3 (45 meV) crystal.35,36 It should be stressed that the dielectric constant value ε∞ of the few-layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is simply replaced to evaluate the exciton binding energy by that of the 3D perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 due to limited computing resources. However, the actual dielectric constant value ε∞ for the 2D material is generally less than that of the 3D structure, which has also been reported by other studies.23,36 Thus the calculated values underestimate the real value of Eb, and the actual exciton binding energies Eb for the 2D layered perovskite are larger than the calculated results (193–272 meV). The exciton binding energies can be defined as Eb = Eg − ħω, in which Eg and ħω represent the band gap and photon energy, respectively, this is illustrated in Fig. 5b. To distinguish from the intrinsic absorption, the incident photon energy below the band gap can still be absorbed if there is a high exciton energy. Fig. 5c demonstrates the optical absorption spectra of the bulk, monolayer, bilayer and trilayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. There are obvious absorption peaks located at 1.7–1.9 eV for the monolayer, bilayer and trilayer indicated by the A, B, C arrows, in which the electron transition below the band gap should have been banned as the incident photon energy is ħω < Eg. We ascribe this as the reason for the high exciton binding energies Eb in the 2D layered perovskite. Conversely there is hardly any absorption peaks below the band gap for the bulk perovskite, indicated by the red lines, owing to the low Eb (193 meV), but a relatively low exciton absorption peak is still present near the band gap. Therefore, the exciton absorption peaks decrease due to the reduced exciton energy Eb when the number of layers increase. The calculated absorption spectra trend is basically in accordance with the experiments, where the obvious exciton absorption peak is also detected. This is slightly different from the theoretical results in which the experimental exciton absorption peak becomes blue shifted, and we ascribe the reason to be that the experimental band gap (2.36 eV) for the ultrathin (PEA)2PbI4 is a little larger than that of the theoretical results (2.08 eV). It is noteworthy that the exciton absorption may broaden the absorption edge, but it barely produces more electron–hole pairs due to the strong Coulomb potential between the excitons, and thus has no contribution to the photovoltaic performance. Inversely, the high exciton energies may accelerate the electron hole pairs recombination, hence obtaining a stronger photoluminescence spectra. According to the above discussions, the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is inadequate as a solar absorber in view of high exciton binding energies. However, this system may be suitable for use in light emission diodes (OLEDs), which benefit from the high exciton energies. The detailed data on the calculation of the exciton binding energies are listed in Table S2 provided in the ESI.†

(b) Illustration of the relationship between the exciton binding energy Eb and the optical band gap ℏω. (c) Calculated absorption spectra of the bulk, monolayer, bilayer and trilayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 in comparison with the experimental results of the (PEA)2PbI4 crystal indicated by red, blue, yellow, purple and green lines, respectively, and the arrows show the exciton peaks. 

Fig. 6a shows the schematic illustration of an experimental geometry to detect polarized light in a chosen orientation by utilizing the anisotropic electronic properties, in which the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is the absorbing layer, and ‘S’ and ‘D’ represent the source and drain electrodes. The optical absorption spectra of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are predicted according to eqn (6). Fig. 6b–e indicate the absorption spectra of polarized light in the x(a0), y(b0) and z(c0) directions for the bulk, monolayer, bilayer and trilayer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, respectively. For the bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, absorption coefficients of polarized light in the x and y directions (here x and y refer to a0, b0 axis respectively) are almost identical, and both are much higher than those in the z direction in the visible spectrum. When the incident light energies are between 3.5–4.5 eV, the absorption coefficients of polarized light in the y direction exceed those in the x direction. While the incident photon energy exceeds 4 eV, this material exhibits a much strong absorption ability in the polarized z direction than those of the x and y direction. Thus, there is a strong linear dichroism between the x, y direction and z direction in the visible spectra. In the ultraviolet spectrum, the absorption spectrum of polarized light along the three directions all exhibit strong anisotropy. Fig. 7a and b demonstrate the band decomposed charge densities of the VBM and CBM for the bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. The results reveal the charge density is mainly distributed in the x–y plane, and this may mean that the higher absorption coefficients of light are along the x, y direction. For the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, the absorption coefficients of polarized light in the x and y direction are similarly higher than those of polarized light in the z direction. The reason is probably that the charge densities of the VBM and CBM are basically localized in the x–y plane, as shown in Fig. 7c and d, hence the absorption coefficients are inferior in the z direction. Unlike the very low absorption coefficients for the bulk perovskite, there is still an obvious absorption peak for polarization light along the the z direction in the 2.2 eV region for the 2D layered perovskite. When the number of layers increases from the monolayer to the trilayer, and then to the bulk, the absorption coefficients of polarized light in the z direction descend until they disappear in the visible spectrum. We ascribe this phenomenon to the higher exciton absorption in the few-layer perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 compared with the bulk perovskite (PEA)2PbI4. Based on the above discussion, the polarized light in the z direction is hardly absorbed and can easily be distinguished from the polarized light along the x and y direction. The calculated results reveal that the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is not suitable for use in photovoltaic materials, taking into consideration the poor absorption ability in the z direction. These above results demonstrate a strong linear dichroism for the layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, and this property may be utilized as a polarized light detector, rather than as superior solar absorbers.

3. Summary
In summary, we investigated geometric structures of layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 which varied by the number of layers. Compared to the bulk crystal, the sheets exhibit structural relaxation, and the results reveal that the lattice constants enlarge from the monolayer to the bulk when the number of layers increase, leading to electronic structure changes. Based on the electronic structures, the charge carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite were firstly evaluated along with effective masses (me, mh) and elastic modulus C2D, as well as the deformation potential E1. In comparison with optoelectronic materials such as MoS2 sheets, the charge carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 are considerably appreciable, obtaining the same order of magnitude (95–731 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron, 114–363 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole). However, these values are obviously smaller than those of the main photovoltaic materials, for example CH3NH3PbI3, Si crystal. Thus, the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 is not a potential competitor for photovoltaic materials in terms of carrier mobilities. With the number of layers varying from the monolayer to the trilayer, the carrier mobilities of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 basically increase, which indicates a higher dimension is conductive to improving the transport. Furthermore, the exciton binding energies of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 were also calculated from the monolayer (272 meV) to the bulk (193 meV). These values are larger than those of the best photovoltaic materials such as bulk Si (20 meV), and MAPbI3 (45 meV) crystal, and being in good agreement with the experiments.34 As the material thinned from bulk to few-layers in the perovskite (PEA)2PbI4, the exciton binding energy enlarges, suggesting a higher electron–hole recombination and shorter diffusion length. Hence, the high exciton binding energy in the 2D layered perovskite is not conducive to photovoltaic materials, but these shortages may contribute to enhancing the light emission when the material is used for OLEDs in the field of optoelectronic field, turning the shortages into advantages. Also, the absorption spectra of polarized light for 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 along the a, b and c axis were investigated, and the results demonstrate extremely weak absorption along the c axis. Thus, the properties contribute little to the strong optical absorption as solar absorbers. However, the properties may be utilized as other optoelectronic materials, such as polarized light detectors.
In brief, taking the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 as an example, theoretical research suggests that this type of 2D layered perovskite is inadequate in the photovoltaic field due to the relatively low charge carrier mobility, high electron–hole recombination rates and inferior optical absorption coefficients. However, this type of 2D layered perovskite may become promising rivals for other materials as optoelectronic devices, such as photo detectors, OLEDs and so forth, owing to the high exciton energies and unique optical properties.
4. Methods
4.1 DFT calculation
DFT calculations were performed by using the GGA exchange–correlation potential with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.37,38 The energy cutoff for the plane-wave cutoff was set to 400 eV in all calculations.39 A 5 × 5 × 1 and 5 × 5 × 3 k-mesh sampling Monkhorst–Park scheme was used in the full optimization for the 2D and bulk layered perovskite, respectively, until the energy convergence threshold per each atom was less than 1.0 × 10−5 eV. In optimizing the system, van der Waals interactions were adopted within vdw-DF to describe the interaction between the atomic layers.40 A 15 Å vacuum along the c axis was added to remove the interactions between neighboring layers. Herein, none of the HSE06 functional and spin orbit coupling (SOC) were considered for the calculation of the electronic structures due to the error cancellation, as the GGA potential usually underestimated the band gap owing to the self-correlation error of electrons while relativistic effects such as spin–orbit coupling (SOC) for heavy metal Pb 6p also reduce the band gap. The figures are plotted in VESTA and Origin.
4.2 Carrier mobility
For 2D materials, the transport properties can be evaluated by using a simple approach based on the DP theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley41,42 with the following forms:43 (1)
In which E1 is the DP constant, which represents the energy shift ∂Eedg of the VBM for the hole or the CBM for the electron induced by the strain δ derived from the form: (2)
The elastic modulus C caused by the acoustic phonon in the propagation directions is defined as: (3)
In which E and S0 are the total energy and the area of the cell, respectively. δ indicates the applied uniaxial train. ℏ, e, kB is the reduced Planck constant, element charge and Boltzmann constant, respectively, and temperature T is set to 300 K for the carrier mobility calculation.
The m* represents the charge effective mass in-plane expressed as (4)
In which the k is the wave vector along transport direction and the ε(k) represents the energy band eigenvalues.
4.3 Exciton binding energy
Based on the Wannier exciton model, the exciton binding energies are given as the formula:44 (5)where  is reduced exciton mass derived from the equation: , ε∞ is the static dielectric constants contributed from electron, which can be evaluated by using density functional perturbation theory.45–62 Value n is exciton energy levels. For example, n equals one, which indicates the exciton ground state energy.
4.4 Optical property
Absorption coefficients are calculated from the dielectric function expressed as: (6)ω is the light frequency, ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. As the ε1 and ε2 are the matrix tensor indicating the electric field vector. Hence, polarized light along the a(x), b(y) and c(z) direction can be obtained from εxx, εyy and εzz separately.
