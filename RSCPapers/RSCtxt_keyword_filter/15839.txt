    , Accepted 29th March 2023First published on 1st April 2023AbstractPbI2 films as templates are essential to the quality of perovskite (PVK) film in a two-step sequential deposition process. Herein, we demonstrate that PbI2 microcrystal powder (P-PbI2) of micrometer size is beneficial for preparing higher-quality PbI2 films in contrast to millimeter-sized PbI2 crystals (C-PbI2) under low relative humidity (RH) conditions. Surprisingly, C-PbI2 allowed the growth of denser films than P-PbI2 under heavy RH conditions. Ultimately, P-PbI2 gave PVK solar cells (PSCs) a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.30% under a low RH of 30 ± 5%, and C-PbI2 derived an impressive PCE of 21.09% when fabricated under conditions with RH = 50 ± 5%. This work provides ideas for the selection of lead iodide for the fabrication of PSCs under air conditions.
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show a prosperous outlook in the photovoltaic field with their unique advantages. A highest certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% has been achieved,1 which could rival silicon solar cells in just a decade or so. With advances in the commercialization of PSC modules, it is widely recognized that the quality of PbI2 raw materials greatly affects the deposition of perovskite (PVK) films, as well as device performance.2 Meanwhile, the source of lead has received particular attention in terms of its toxicity. Numerous studies have reported methods to recover lead and synthesize lead halides, including our previously proposed PbI2 preparation from waste lead acid batteries.3–6 However, the tailoring of PbI2 properties and the correlation between PbI2 properties and PSC performance have still not been investigated in detail.
In addition, for the industrial manufacture of PVK films, the two-step sequential deposition method has excellent operability and vast application potential, thanks to the feasibility of better morphology control by PbI2 templates.7 Generally, PbI2 films are prepared in a process of annealing at low temperature (usually 70 °C), thus causing amorphous and minute (001) crystalline clusters to coexist in PbI2 films.8 After the ammonium salts drop down, the PbI2 (001) facet orientation will be further crystallized before the formation of perovskite phases, which was demonstrated in several reports.9,10 This means that PbI2 with higher crystallinity before the participation of ammonium salts will shorten the subsequent formation of PVK, and will be conducive to obtaining higher-quality PVK films. Based on this, to date, several studies have been reported on the optimization of PbI2 templates including additive engineering,11 interface modification12 and crystallization control.13 However, few reports have studied the nucleation and crystallization of PbI2 film effected by PbI2 raw material self-properties (e.g., crystal size or morphology).
Herein, we demonstrate a regulation method for PbI2 film by tailoring the crystal size of PbI2 raw materials: PbI2 microcrystal powder with an average size of 10 μm (abbreviated to P-PbI2) and large-size PbI2 crystals with a size of over 100 μm (abbreviated to C-PbI2). We reveal that P-PbI2 can lead to the formation of higher-quality PbI2 films and consequent PVK films than C-PbI2, owing to small colloid clusters in the P-PbI2 precursor solution optimizing the crystallization of PbI2 films. However, this conclusion applies only to the deposition of PbI2 films and PVK films under the condition of low relative humidity (RH). Under heavy RH conditions, the advantages of P-PbI2 were not as obvious due to moisture erosion. But surprisingly, C-PbI2 allowed the growth of better PVK films thanks to its large colloid clusters resisting moisture erosion during the deposition of PbI2 films. Ultimately, the PVK film fabricated from P-PbI2 under low RH conditions delivered a relatively higher device PCE of 23.30%, while the C-PbI2-based device achieved a PCE of only 22.22%. When PVK film were fabricated under heavy RH conditions, the advantages of resistance to moisture of C-PbI2 can deliver a high PCE of over 21%, while P-PbI2-based devices reached a maximum PCE of only 18%. This work reveals how the particle size of PbI2 raw materials influences the formation of PVK in a two-step sequential deposition process for the first time.
To tailor the PbI2 particle size, we employed a feasible method proposed in our previous work.6 This method prepared a large quantity of PbI2 (process (i) in Fig. 1a) with a smooth fine powder texture (P-PbI2). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and photograph show a sheet morphology with a size of around 10 μm (Fig. 1b). To obtain large-sized PbI2 crystals, a recrystallization process was proposed, as shown in processes (ii and iii) in Fig. 1a. The details of the experiment are given in the ESI.† The SEM image and photograph show that the PbI2 crystals are sparkly and the size of crystals is over 100 μm (Fig. 1c). The largest PbI2 crystal even reached a centimeter in size (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, C-PbI2 shows only four apparent peaks corresponding to (001), (101), (003) and (004) facets, respectively, and no other impurity peaks are found (Fig. 1d). The highest (001) diffraction intensity indicates that the proportion of (001) facet increases with PbI2 recrystallization, owing to the two-dimensional layer structured nature of PbI2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). From X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) measurement, both P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 show two peaks of Pb2+ at binding energies of 137.9 eV assigned to Pb 4f5/2a and 142.8 eV assigned to Pb 4f7/2. It is noteworthy that both types of PbI2 also exhibited Pb0 peaks in the XPS spectra, which resulted from the decomposition of PbI2 under X-ray radiation during XPS testing but did not exist in the initial P-PbI2 and C-PbI2.14 Furthermore, the purity trace metals basis of P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 were determined to be 99.99% and 99.999% by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP), indicating a higher purity of PbI2 after recrystallization (Table S1, ESI†).

We then prepared PbI2 film under low RH = 35 ± 5% conditions. The PbI2 precursor solutions measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 2a) showed that the PbI2 solution from C-PbI2 exhibited a broader colloid size distribution than that from P-PbI2. The XRD carried out on P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 films showed that P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 films exhibited high (001) and (003) peak intensities (Fig. 2b). However, P-PbI2 film showed slightly higher peak intensity and narrower width at half maximum (FWHM) than C-PbI2 film, indicating the higher crystallinity of P-PbI2 film. Moreover, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was carried out to investigate the crystallinity and orientation of the PbI2 film surface in detail. GIXRD with an incidence angle of 0.5° showed high (001) peak intensity for both PbI2 films (Fig. 2c). The P-PbI2 film exhibited higher (001) peak intensity with a narrower FWHM of 0.185 than that of C-PbI2 film with an FWHM of 0.203, further demonstrating the better crystallization and larger grain size of PbI2 in P-PbI2-based film. From the SEM images of P-PbI2 (Fig. 2d) and C-PbI2 films (Fig. 2e), the PbI2 grain size in P-PbI2 film is significantly greater than that in C-PbI2 film, which is in accordance with the XRD results. The atomic force microscope (AFM) showed the roughness of the P-PbI2 film (Fig. 2f) was less than that of C-PbI2 film (Fig. 2g). And Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements indicated that the surface potential of the P-PbI2 film was evenly distributed, while some low-potential areas in C-PbI2 film were obvious (Fig. 2h and i). These results demonstrated that P-PbI2 film was smoother than C-PbI2 film. A P-PbI2 film with high crystallinity and smoothness acting as a template will lead to the subsequent growth of large and homogeneous PVK grains. To explain why P-PbI2 with small colloid clusters is better for forming high crystallinity and smooth film than its C-PbI2 counterpart, we employed classical nucleation theory to analyze the process of nuclei formation. P-PbI2 with small colloid clusters implied slightly smaller free energy (ΔG*) and critical radius (r*), which means less nucleation resistance for P-PbI2 and further crystallization for P-PbI2 film. Detailed analysis is exhibited in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

The PVK films were formed under low RH conditions by the penetration of ammonium salts into PbI2 films. The top-view SEM (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†) showed that PVK films fabricated from P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 were compact. The P-PbI2 PVK grains were enlarged according to the statistical distribution of PVK grain size (Fig. S5, ESI†). The XRD result (Fig. S6, ESI†) indicated that both P-PbI2 PVK and C-PbI2 PVK had a strong (001) peak intensity. But the FWHM of P-PbI2 PVK was smaller than that of C-PbI2 PVK, implying better crystallization and larger crystal size for P-PbI2 PVK. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the PVK films are compared in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Both P-PbI2 PVK and C-PbI2 PVK films showed a PL peak at 820 nm which was consistent with previous reports for (FAxMA1−x)PbI3 PVK.15 Moreover, the PL intensity of P-PbI2 PVK film was evidently higher, suggesting that non-radiative recombination was relatively weak. Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of carrier recombination was realized in time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (Fig. S8, ESI†), where the calculated average carrier lifetimes of 281.65 ns for P-PbI2 PVK film and 190.96 ns for C-PbI2 PVK film were fitted to TRPL curves. The function and curve-fitting parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It is clear that the carrier lifetime of P-PbI2 PVK film was much longer than that of C-PbI2 PVK film, suggesting its weak non-radiative recombination. Moreover, space-charge limited-current (SCLC) measurement was also employed based on electron-only devices. The trap-state density was determined by the trap filled limit voltage (VTFL).16 The P-PbI2 PVK sample displayed a VTFL of 0.12 V while the C-PbI2 PVK sample displayed a VTFL of 0.18 V (Fig. S9, ESI†), implying that the P-PbI2 PVK film has lower electron trap density and less nonradiative recombination loss.
Surprisingly, we also found that C-PbI2 was favorable for preparing uniform PVK films under heavy RH = 55 ± 5% conditions. As depicted in Fig. 3a, PbI2 films are eroded by water molecules under heavy RH conditions, and we think that the P-PbI2 wet film with small colloid clusters is more vulnerable to erosion by water molecules, but the C-PbI2 wet film can resist water molecules by having large colloid clusters. Both P-PbI2 wet film and C-PbI2 wet film exhibited poor hydrophilicity with water contact angles of 76.51° and 84.82°, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†), indicating that the C-PbI2 wet film with large colloid clusters indeed prevents moisture. In consequence, P-PbI2 film with a disordered mesoporous morphology and C-PbI2 film with a relatively smooth and compact morphology were obtained (Fig. S11, ESI† and Fig. 3b). Subsequently, PVK films were fabricated under a constant RH of 55 ± 5%. Top and cross-sectional SEM images showed lots of obvious holes in the P-PbI2 PVK film, which were caused by multihole P-PbI2 film (Fig. 3c and d). But the C-PbI2 PVK film was still smooth and compact. As depicted in the XRD pattern (Fig. S12, ESI†), the (001) peak intensity of P-PbI2 PVK film is lower than that of C-PbI2 PVK film, indicating moisture-induced poor crystallinity for P-PbI2 PVK film. Then, steady-state PL, TRPL and SCLC measurements were conducted to compare the photoelectric properties. The C-PbI2 PVK film showed a stronger PL emission and longer PL decay lifetime of 163.20 ns than P-PbI2 PVK film with a PL decay lifetime of 36.86 ns (Fig. 3e and f). For the SCLC result, the VTFL of the C-PbI2 cell was 0.14 V, whereas the VTFL of the P-PbI2 cell was around 0.25 V. The low trap density for the C-PbI2 cell indicated the superior PVK film and greater effectiveness in defect passivation, demonstrating the C-PbI2 film with stronger resistance to moisture can deliver a high-quality film under heavy RH conditions.

PSC devices were fabricated (Fig. S13, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that, except for the evaporation of the Ag electrode, the whole process of PSC device fabrication was operated under moist conditions. First, PSC devices fabricated from P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 under low RH = 30 ± 5% conditions were investigated. The P-PbI2-based device exhibited a reverse PCE of 23.30% and a lower forward PCE of 22.77%, corresponding to a calculated hysteresis factor of 2.2% (Fig. 4a). The C-PbI2-based device displayed a lower reverse PCE of 22.22% and a forward PCE of 21.80%, corresponding to a calculated hysteresis factor of 1.9% (Fig. 4b). The other parameters are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The integrated JSC from the external quantum efficiency spectra (EQE) of P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 based devices matched well with the measured value from the J–V curve (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the P-PbI2-based device maintained a higher steady-state PCE of approximately 23.01% than that of C-PbI2-based devices under a steady power output (SPO) test (Fig. S14, ESI†). The light intensity dependence of VOC (Fig. 4d) shows the slope of the P-PbI2-based device (1.59 KT q−1) is lower than that of the C-PbI2-based device (1.74 KT q−1), attributed to the presence of weaker nonradiative trap-assisted recombination.

(i) Statistical distribution of PCE for P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 based PSCs. 
We also compared PSC devices in which the PVK films were fabricated under heavy RH = 50 ± 5% conditions. The best P-PbI2-based device delivered lower performance with the best PCE of 18.31%, whereas the C-PbI2-based device delivered the best PCE of 21.09% (Fig. 4e). The EQE spectra (Fig. S15, ESI†) matched well with the measured value from the J–V curve. Further statistical distribution of the PCEs (Fig. 4f) shows that the overall efficiency of the P-PbI2-based devices is much higher than that of the C-PbI2-based devices under low RH conditions, whereas C-PbI2-based devices yield higher PCEs under heavy RH conditions. The statistical distributions of the other parameters are displayed in Fig. S16 (ESI†). After storing in an ambient atmosphere (25 °C, RH ∼ 30%) for around 30 days, unencapsulated PSCs fabricated from both P-PbI2 and C-PbI2 under low RH = 30 ± 5% conditions maintained over 90% of their initial PCE (Fig. S17a, ESI†). However, the PCE of unencapsulated PSCs fabricated from P-PbI2 under high RH = 50 ± 5% conditions dropped to 80% of its initial PCE after 25 days (Fig. S17b, ESI†).
In summary, we prepared two different particles sizes of PbI2 in aqueous solution. The PbI2 films and subsequent PVK fabricated from P-PbI2 exhibited better crystallization in contrast to C-PbI2 under low RH conditions. Hence, the best P-PbI2-based device delivered a high PCE of 23.30% and the C-PbI2 device delivered a relatively low PCE of 22.22% under low RH conditions. In addition, we found that C-PbI2 generated more compact PVK films under heavy RH conditions attributed to the large-sized colloids preventing water molecules from eroding the film. Ultimately, the C-PbI2-based devices still achieved a PCE of over 21%. Whereas P-PbI2 delivered a best PCE of only 18.31%. This work provides ideas for the selection of lead iodide in the industrialized production of PSCs.
