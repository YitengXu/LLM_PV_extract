    , Accepted 27th August 2019First published on 27th August 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have favorable stability and unique photoelectric properties in comparison with three-dimensional (3D) counterparts and have become a new topic in the field of materials. However, the environmental toxicity of lead is still a major obstacle to their commercialization. In this regard, 2D lead-free halide perovskites come into being and will be the main concern for future commercial applications. Here, we first introduce the synthesis strategies, crystal structure and basic optoelectronic properties of 2D lead-free halide perovskite materials. Subsequently, the application status of solar cells and light-emitting diodes in recent years is summarized. Finally, the existing problems and future development prospects of these kinds of materials are discussed, which provide a reference for the design and preparation of high-performance 2D lead-free halide perovskite optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
The origin of perovskites can be traced back to Count Lev Aleksevich von Perovski's first discovery of this structure in the ore calcium titanate (CaTiO3) in 1839,1 and thereafter, materials with similar structures are called perovskite materials. Lead halide perovskites have a structure similar to an oxide perovskite with a formula of APbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I). In 2009, Kojima et al. firstly used the hybrid halide perovskite material MAPbI3 as a light absorbing layer in dye sensitized solar cells.2 Though the power conversion efficiency was as low as 3.8% at that time, it boosted the applications of lead halide perovskite materials in optoelectronic devices. The true rise of halide perovskites occurred after a series of studies on solid state perovskite solar cells.3–5 Since then, 3D lead halide perovskite materials have been widely studied due to their excellent characteristics including a long exciton diffusion length, suitable charge carrier lifetime, high light absorption coefficient, low-temperature solution processing capability and low non-radiative carrier recombination rate.6–9 In recent years, the photovoltaic performance of hybrid halide perovskite materials has developed rapidly, especially the power conversion efficiency of 3D perovskite solar cells has reached 25.2% in just a few years.10,11 In addition to solar cells, the excellent optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites make them widely used in other applications, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs),12 field effect transistors (FETs),13 lasers,14 radiation detectors,15etc. However, the stability and lead toxicity of traditional perovskite materials need to be addressed before large-scale commercialization.
2D layered lead halide perovskite structures obtained by 3D dimensionality reduction can be regarded as a nanoscale encapsulation of the traditional “perovskite layer” with large organic cations to prevent the infiltration of air and water molecules,16 which results in good stability of 2D layered perovskite materials in comparison with traditional 3D perovskites. Actually, a lead-based halide perovskite exhibits good photovoltaic performance not only because of high electronic dimensions and symmetry of the perovskite structure but also due to the unique electronic configuration of lead ions with lone pair electrons in the Pb 6s orbital and inactive electrons in the Pb 6p orbital, which are involved in the formation of valence and conduction bands in the perovskite, respectively.17 Strong spin–orbit coupling also exists. Besides, the difference of organic cations and the properties of halogen ions are also indispensable in all of the better-performing halide perovskite optoelectronic devices to date. Unfortunately, lead is highly toxic. After coming into contact with water or humid air, it can form a water-soluble compound of lead, which inevitably accumulates in the food chain and eventually enters into blood circulation through the diet.18 In the past three years, researchers have tried to replace the toxic Pb element in 2D perovskites by other elements to solve the problem of stability and toxicity at the same time.19 Mentioning the elimination of Pb will inevitably lead to the use of the other divalent elements such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and so on.20–23 Studies have shown that the ion size affects the formation of the perovskite structure, for example the ion sizes of Mg2+ and Ba2+ are not appropriate to form a stable perovskite phase. In addition, because Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions do not contain lone pairs of electrons, the band gap of the perovskite material or the effective mass of the carrier is too large, which affects the light absorption and carrier transport.24 Besides, strong hygroscopicity is another disadvantage. At present, Sn2+ and Ge2+ are usually divalent substitutes for Pb. However, these two elements are only less toxic than Pb and the more important problem is that they can be easily oxidized to Sn4+ and Ge4+, which will further lead to phase transformation and even decomposition of perovskites.23,25,26 Adding adjuvants can alleviate this oxidation behavior, which will be described in detail later.
Different spatial structures and relevant characteristics of lead-free 2D halide perovskites were widely reported in the 1980s by Mitzi's group.27–32 Until now, the topic was lead-free 2D halide perovskites used in optoelectronic device surfaces. In this review, we attempt to summarize recent advances in the synthesis of these emerging 2D lead-free halide perovskites, illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of different synthetic methods. Furthermore, the general types of 2D perovskites based on the (100), (110), and (111) orientations are introduced. Furthermore, a comprehensive description of the structural types of multilayer (100) oriented perovskites is presented, including Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phases, Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phases and alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) types. Some important characteristics including the effects of values of n, bandgap, optical properties, excitonic behaviors, and different spacers on the optical and electrical properties of 2D lead-free halide perovskites will be also discussed. Finally, we summarize the applications and research progress of 2D lead-free halide perovskites in LEDs and solar cells. Outlook and future directions will be presented to boost the potential of 2D lead-free halide perovskites in optoelectronics.
2. Structural types and synthetic strategies of 2D lead-free halide perovskites
2.1 Structural types of 2D lead-free halide perovskites
A halide perovskite is a compound with AMX3 formula, where M is generally a divalent metal element, forming an octahedral structure coordinated to six halide ions X−. Eight octahedra are connected through corner-sharing to form a 3D inorganic skeleton [MX3]− inhabited by non-bonded A+. The stable crystal structure may be limited by the size, shape and charge distribution of the A cation, which is determined by the so-called tolerance factor  of the perovskite, where RA, RB, and RX are the radii of A, B, and X ions. In the case of an ideal perovskite, the value of t satisfies 0.80 < t < 1 to form a stable 3D structure, while the cations with t < 0.8 or t > 1 cannot form a 3D perovskite structure and instead adopt a low-dimensional structural type. Actually, 2D halide perovskites can be regarded as a product of cutting along a specific plane of the 3D parent compound with a formula of (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1, where R represents large organic functional groups and n is the number of stacked corner-shared octahedral layers. In general, n = 1 corresponds to a pure two-dimensional layered structure, n = ∞ constitutes a three-dimensional structure, and when n is any other integer, it corresponds to a quasi-two-dimensional layered structure,33 as shown in Fig. 1a. Based on the orientation of the crystalline layer slice in the 3D framework, 2D perovskites can be classified into three classifications: (100), (110) and (111) oriented perovskites,34 as shown in Fig. 1b–d. Among these three categories, (100) oriented 2D perovskites with (A′)(A)n−1BnX3n+1 where A′ represents divalent cations or A′2An−1MnX3n+1 where A′ represents monovalent cations have been extensively studied so far.35

Structural comparison among n = 3 crystal structures of RP, DJ, and ACI phases is shown in Fig. 2.33 As shown in Fig. 2a, RP perovskites have attracted considerable attention and interest in the (100) orientation owing to their large-size organic cations with hydrophobic groups and van der Waals interactions between layers, which can improve the stability of perovskite materials to a certain extent. The less common type of perovskite is DJ phases. Different from the RP phase in that the organic spacing material is composed of two interacting monovalent cations like RNH3+, the septum of the DJ phase is replaced by a bivalent organic spacer composition, as shown in Fig. 2b. There is no van der Waals interaction between layers and the organic cations are connected with inorganic perovskite layers by hydrogen bonds at both ends of the molecules, so they have better structural stability and excellent carrier charge transfer properties. In terms of the crystal structure, the relative displacement of the DJ phase along the ab-plane can be (1/2, 0) shift or (0,0) shift in the perovskite layer, contrary to the RP phase with a common displacement of (1/2, 1/2) shift. In 2D hybrid halide perovskites, organic cations act as an insulating barrier. Due to the different stereoscopic requirements of organic cations, the distortion level of the quasi-two-dimensional layered perovskite crystal structure is determined by the competition between organic cations and the shared inorganic skeleton.

The ACI type is a new structure existing only in halide perovskites. As shown in Fig. 2c, it combines stacking characteristics of RP and DJ structural types, and the displacement is (1/2, 0) shift. For ACI phases, the obvious difference from RP phases is that the “perovskitizer” cation such as MA+, FA+, and Cs+ at the A-site resides both in the perovskite plates and the interlayer along with the designated spacing cation A. Numerous studies have shown that guanidinium (GA+) is the only A′-cation that can form an ACI structure in virtue of an appropriate size, which is similar to the “perovskitizer” cation.
2.2 Synthesis of 2D lead-free halide perovskites
A large number of studies have made the framework of lead-free perovskite systems clear. At present, the common 2D lead-free halide perovskite system can be divided into the following two categories: equivalent lead substitutes like Sn2+ and Ge2+, and heterovalent lead substitutes, such as Bi3+/Ag+.36 Studies on the structural and optical properties of lead-free layered metal halides had been reported early in the 1960s.37,38 Since then, other transition metal halides perovskites, such as (RNH3)2CrCl4, had also been synthesized in the 1970s.39–41 It is noteworthy that in 1962, red photoluminescence was observed in Mn-based layered perovskites.42 Sn–I and Ge–I based perovskites were synthesized as early as from 1993 to 1996 by Mitzi et al. using various organic cations as templates.27 Double perovskites, which were obtained by using an alternative like Bi3+/Ag+ to isovalent lead, were studied in the 1930s,43 while the experimental characteristics of 2D homologues are lacking, except the layered perovskites of mixed-valent gold(I)/gold(III) iodides reported in 2003 by Laura. Moreover, the composition and characterization of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 was reported recently.44
In order to prepare 2D lead-free halide perovskite nanomaterials with favorable properties, various strategies have been studied, such as mechanical peeling, spin coating, thermal injection and vapor deposition. The first 2D material widely studied is graphene,45,46 which is usually synthesized by the exfoliation method. Inspired by this, researchers made studies on the preparation of 2D lead-free halide perovskites by exfoliation. For example, Shen et al. synthesized (PEA)2CsSn2I7 crystals for the first time. Benefiting from the layered property of the samples, they obtained the layered structure by mechanical exfoliation and further fabricated it into micro-devices. Optical microscopy images of the as-synthesized (PEA)2CsSn2I7 perovskite crystals and a piece of the exfoliated flake with a rather smooth surface were shown in Fig. 3a.47 They transferred exfoliated (PEA)2CsSn2I7 thin-flakes to prefabricated double probe electrodes to fabricate microplate electronic devices with high conductivity and a high field-effect hole mobility of 34 cm2 V−1 s−1. What should be pointed out is that it is difficult to control the fragmentation process and to obtain perovskite nanosheets with controllable layers and sizes using this strategy.

The thermal injection method of perovskites was first reported by the Maksym V. Kovalenko group,48 which can carefully adjust the thickness of nanoplatelets. Bismuth-based perovskites are non-toxic and stable and are often used as a substitute for toxic lead. Lian et al. prepared colloidal Cs3Bi2Br9 by injecting cesium oleate into a solution mixture of 1-octadecene (ODE), bismuth tribromide (BiBr3), and oleic acid (OA) at a high reaction temperature using classical heat injection technology.49 The growth mechanism and TEM images of the products are shown in Fig. 3b. The obtained Cs3Bi2Br9 nanoplatelets exhibit a parallelogram layered structure and each layer consists of two Bi–Br octahedral layers. The length of nanosheets varies from 60 to 250 nm, and the thickness of nanosheets is uniform at around 9 nm. Subsequently, the anion-exchange reaction was used to regulate halogen ions in perovskite crystals. It is demonstrated that the disparity between the direct and indirect band gap of Cs3Bi2X9 is extremely small and can be equalized by thermal energy at room temperature. The limitation of colloidal methods is that it is difficult to prepare larger thin layers because they tend to fracture or aggregate in colloidal suspensions.
To date, solution processing is the most widely used way to prepare perovskite nanomaterials due to its convenience and ease of operation compared with the two methods mentioned above. The results show that as another alternative to lead, Sn-based perovskites and Bi-based perovskites have also been extensively studied. Mitzi et al. synthesized a family of organic layered Sn-based halides perovskites, (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–5), by solution processing for the first time, and proved that the organic modulation layer can flexibly change the electrical properties of halide perovskite nanosheets.50 The prepared plate-like crystals are single crystals for n = 1–4, whereas for n = 5, the samples are ∼90% pure. Electrical transport measurements in Fig. 3c show a transition from semiconducting to metallic at n = 3. In order to overcome the problem that Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+, recently, using a similar approach, Chen et al. reported the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of a new type of low-dimensional Dion–Jacobson Sn-based halides perovskite, (4AMP)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1, where FA is formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+), 4AMP is 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium.51 Through the study of samples with different n values, it is found that with the increase of n, the absorption edges and PL peaks of the materials are red-shifted systematically, and the dimension is changed from two-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional. The PL lifetime of these samples is as high as 18.56 ns, which is much longer than that observed in other Sn-based perovskite materials.
3. Optical and electrical characteristics of 2D lead-free perovskites
Besides satisfying the structural stability, a suitable band gap is required for absorption materials with excellent performance, so as to maximize the optical absorption. Theoretically, with narrowing of the band gap, the range of visible light absorption becomes wider and the efficiency of light utilization becomes higher. However, when the band gap is too narrow, the electrons and holes can easily recombine. Previous studies have indicated that a material with a bandgap between 1.34 eV and 1.5 eV can effectively absorb visible light.52 The energy band diagram of common 3D perovskite materials is shown in Fig. 4a,53 which satisfies the requirement pretty well. Dimensionality reduction provides more adjustable lines, while it enlarges the material band gap and most of the proposed layered perovskites have a band gap larger than 1.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 4b. Therefore, band gap control is very important for applications of 2D lead-free halide perovskites in optoelectronic devices.

Previous studies suggested that with the increase of perovskite layers (n value), the bandgap Eg of the perovskite decreases gradually, which can be understood by the quantum confinement effect. 2D layered perovskites can be regarded as natural quantum wells,54 as shown in Fig. 5a, where inorganic layers act as potential wells and insulating organic layers as potential barriers. The decrease of inorganic layers leads to the increase of the band gap. Take (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1GenI3n+1 for example: band gaps decrease monotonically with increasing n values, from 1.88 eV (n = 1), to 1.83 eV (n = 2), to 1.69 eV (n = 3), and then to 1.57 eV (n = ∞) according to first-principles calculations, consistent with the photoluminescence peak at 690 nm (1.80 eV) in the experiment. The band structures are shown in Fig. 5b,55 where green represents the state originating from Ge(I). All compounds have direct band gaps, in which the conduction band is mainly from the contribution of Ge and the valence band mainly originates from iodine contribution. In slightly thicker nanosheets (n > 3), the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is usually >70%, while for n = 2 and n = 3 nanosheets, it is only about 5–20% and for n = 1 nanosheets, it is less than 1%. This may be due to the weak dielectric shielding effect, which makes the scattering of polarized photons at defects difficult to be shielded.

Optical properties of perovskite materials can be affected by the transformation of components. So far, researchers have tried a lot of different atoms and organic clusters in the preparation of perovskites to further explore the influence of different components on the properties of layered perovskites, including cation A+, metal ion B2+ and halide ion X−, respectively. With respect to the synthesis process, the ratios of halogens in the perovskite can be changed by mixing different halide precursors and the band gap can be tuned systematically from deep ultraviolet, across the visible, into the near-infrared region. Sn, as another alternative to Pb, has also been extensively studied and most of the results show that the quality of the obtained films is not very good, and the corresponding device parameters such as the fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency are found to be relatively low. Fig. 6a–d exhibit temperature dependent PL mapping images between cooling and heating circulation of 2D (BA)2SnI4 and (BA)2SnI4−xClx with a ratio of I:Cl = 1:8 in the precursor solution, excited with a 473 nm continuous wave laser, respectively.56 DSC measurements in Fig. 6e confirm the incorporation of Cl. Cao et al. introduced the use of triethylphosphine, an effective antioxidant which suppresses the doping level of 2D (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1SnnI3n+1 films and improves film morphology. Based on n = 3 (BA)2(MA)2Sn3I10 and n = 4 (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 perovskites, solar cells were prepared and device performance results are shown in Table 1.57 The PCE of the champion device is 2.53% and over 90% of the initial performance of the packaged Sn4I13 device was maintained after one month, and only decreased to 50% after four months. However, one of main concernings in aforementioned solar cells is that actual open-circuit voltages are much smaller than the band gap values of Sn-based perovskites.

Actually, Weidman et al. have given systematic conclusions before carrying out experiments. They mentioned that modifying n, B, or X in halide perovskites can lead to great changes in emission and absorption energy, while the variation of A cations can only lead to slight changes but significantly influences the nanosheet stability and the corresponding PLQY. Fig. 6f presents the absorption and PL emission curves of n = 2 L2[APbBr3]PbBr4 nanosheets, in which A denotes Cs, MA, and FA. With the increase of the cluster size in perovskites (cation size: Cs < MA < FA), the band gap of materials decreases slightly. A similar behavior is also observed in L2[APbI3]PbI4 nanosheets (Fig. 6g). Whether for bromide or iodide nanosheets, the full width at half maximum of the emission peaks follows the tendency MA > Cs > FA, as listed in Table 2. The PLQY of nanoplatelets is listed in Table 3, indicating that when synthesized with FA rather than MA, the PLQY tends to be greatly improved, from 6% to 22%.58

Because of the quantum well structure in 2D perovskites, the excited electrons and holes are bound in the inorganic layer (potential wells). The diffusion of excitons is restricted by the organic barrier layer, which results in the bonding of electrons and holes more easily. Therefore, 2D lead-free halide perovskite materials have a relatively large exciton binding energy. Previous studies have shown that the exciton type of halide perovskite materials belongs to Wannier excitons, also named free excitons. According to the classical theory of the quantum confinement effect, in two-dimensional quantum well structures, the exciton binding energy is generally four times as much as the exciton binding energy of bulk materials. To meet the requirement that carriers can diffuse effectively, perovskite materials used in photovoltaic devices usually have small exciton binding energies, while LEDs usually need large binding energies to facilitate radiation recombination.
4. Light-emitting diodes based on 2D lead-free halide perovskites
Because of the large exciton binding energy of 2D layered perovskites, their radiation recombination process is more advantageous than that of three-dimensional perovskites, and the composition of two-dimensional layered perovskites is more adjustable. Therefore, 2D layered halide perovskite materials have great potential in light emitting diode devices.
As early as 1994, there were reports about 2D layered perovskite light-emitting diodes and the structure of an EL device made from the layered perovskite compound (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4(PAPI) as shown in Fig. 7a and b.59 Intense green light emission can be observed at liquid nitrogen temperature. The EL spectrum of the device agrees well with the photoluminescence spectrum of the PAPI film and the emission peak reaches its maximum at 520 nm and the half-width is about 10 nm, as shown in Fig. 7c. The EL intensity can reach over 10000 cd m−2 when the current density is 2 A cm−2 and the voltage applied to the device is 24 V. Practical application of this device is limited by the high working voltage and working temperature of liquid nitrogen. In 1999, Chondroudis et al. synthesized a 2D layered perovskite AEQTPbCl4 material using dye molecules (AEQT) as organic cations and the prepared LED device realized room temperature electroluminescence.60 Since then, research on layered perovskite light-emitting diodes has made great progress: the external quantum efficiency (EQE), luminance and PLQY have been continuously improved, and red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes have also been realized one after another.

Although traditional 2D lead-halide perovskites in which toxic lead can cause great damage to the environment and human body have been criticized more and more, the study of 2D lead-free halide perovskite light-emitting diodes is still at an early stage. Lanzetta et al. explored the use of the 2D lead-free halide perovskite (PEA)2SnIxBr4−x in LEDs for the first time, where PEA = C6H5CH2CH2NH3+.61 The structure of the device is shown in Fig. 8a, where (PEA)2SnI4 films were deposited on ITO glass substrates with PEDOT:PSS coated by the spin coating process. Following the deposition of F8 as electron injection layers, a LiF/Al top contact was evaporated as a cathode. Electroluminescent spectra are shown in Fig. 8b, with a photograph of the device provided in the inset. From the EL spectrum, it can be concluded that the emission wavelength is in the red region, representing the first visible EL for 2D lead-free halide perovskites. The current density–voltage curve in Fig. 8c shows that the turn-on voltage is about 3.6 V, and the brightness increases with the applied bias voltage. The maximum luminance is 0.15 cd m−2, corresponding to a voltage and a current density of 6 V and 4.7 mA cm−2, respectively. However, the authors indicate that this is not the optimal value due to (PEA)2SnI4 forming micron-sized islands on F8, which can result in incomplete coverage. Further morphology optimization and interface engineering are expected to improve device performance.

Very recently, an orange LED based on 2D (OAm)2SnBr4 realized a maximum luminance of 350 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.1%, as shown in Fig. 8e and f.62 In this material, the formation of the interlayer electron band of the [SnBr6]4− octahedron was prevented because of the quantum confinement effect provided by insulated organic oleamine cationic (C18H35NH3, OAM). The absolute PLQYs (excitation at 365 nm) of orange emission from the colloidal suspension and film were 88% and 68%. The device structure of the LED is composed of patterned ITO-coated glass (cathode), a ZnO/PEI bilayer (electron transport layer, ETL), an emitting layer of the 2D (OAm)2SnBr4 perovskite film, TCTA (hole transport layer, HTL), and MoO3/Au (anode), and the corresponding energy level position is shown in Fig. 8d. The current density at maximum brightness is 844 mA cm−2, and the turn-on voltage is as low as 2.2 V, which is the best performance of lead-free perovskite light emitting diodes so far.
The interface barrier between the carrier transport layer and perovskite layer determines the charge injection efficiency. In general, defects in films are mainly distributed on the grain boundary and interface between the charge injection layer and perovskite emission layer, which can result in the formation of nonradiative recombination centers and the suppression of LED device performance. PEI mentioned above can improve electron injection into the ETL of ZnO, thus realizing matching optimization with the energy level of the luminescent layer. Previous reports have shown that PVK and poly-TPD are widely used as a hole transport layer. While the precursor solution of the perovskite is not wetted on these HTLs, the film coverage is very low. Zou et al. used an amphiphilic conjugated polymer of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluoene)] (PFN) to modify the interface between the HTL and perovskite layer.63 The charge injection rate of the perovskite LEDs is balanced, and a green LED with high efficiency is obtained with a maximum current efficiency of 45.2 cd A−1 and a highest EQE of 14.4%, and then the working lifetime of the device is greatly improved.
5. 2D lead-free halide perovskite based solar cells
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are potential light absorbing materials for solar cells. However, traditional three-dimensional perovskite materials do not have decent stability in air and water and at high temperature.64 Using 2D layered perovskites as an absorber layer can effectively prevent degradation in air. However, research on 2D lead-free perovskites as the light absorber is still in its infancy, and the related reports are rare. Shortly after the work mentioned above, Cao et al. reported efficient 2D lead-free halide perovskite solar cells,57 and Liao and co-workers realized the directional growth of quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite films by adding PEA to FASnI3.16 Adjusting the amount of PEA, the morphology of the films was optimized. It was found that 20% PEA is beneficial to the growth of grains perpendicular to the orientation of the substrate, which promoted the formation of compact and smooth films and prevented the oxidation of films. (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 was also employed as the photoactive layer to prepare solar cells and the corresponding device structure is shown in Fig. 9a, where PCBM and NiOx act as electron and hole transport layers.63 When the SnF2 concentration in the precursor solution was 10% and the PEA content was 20%, the device yielded an optimal PCE of 5.94% with a VOC of 0.59 V and a Jsc of 14.44 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 9. Importantly, this recipe has good repeatability. Without encapsulation, 96% PCE of the device can be maintained in a N2 atmosphere for more than 100 hours, which is superior to 3D FASnI3. This improved stability is attributed to the introduction of PEA at the boundary of nanolayers and favorable morphology of the film without pinholes.

The main reason for the instability of Sn-based perovskites is Sn2+. Kim and co-workers proposed that the coordination of Sn2+ with appropriate ligands can prevent its reaction with oxygen, thus effectively inhibiting oxidation.65 Therefore, an additive agent, formamide thiocyanate (FASCN) was added to the quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite. They found that SCN− could interact with the vacant orbital of Sn2+ and this phenomenon contributes to the formation and morphology improvement of chemically stable Sn-based perovskites, which leads to reduction of tin vacancy defects and improvement of charge transfer characteristics. As a result, the device exhibited good photovoltaic performance with the increase of FASCN content. Device parameters of the champion device with 5 mol% FASCN are shown in Fig. 9e–h. Specifically, the Jsc is 22.5 mA cm−2, VOC is 0.53 V, FF is 68.3%, and the corresponding PCE is 8.17%.
The stability of the 2D layered perovskite solar cell is generally better than that of traditional 3D perovskite solar cells, but its PCE is generally lower due to its large band gap and poor charge transport characteristics. Recently, a 2D lead-free halide double perovskite was proposed, and theoretical calculations show that the band gap of Cs4In3/2Sb3/2I10 can be as low as 1.29 eV.66 As for CsInSbI- and CsInSbCl/CsCuBiCl-based heterostructures, the absorption coefficient in the visible-light region is comparable to that of bulk MAPbI3, and the mobilities of electrons and holes can even reach 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are three or four orders of magnitude larger than those of MAPbI3.
6. Stability
In brief, different synthesis methods, organic cationic ligands, halogen ions, etc. will affect the performance parameters of 2D lead-free halide perovskite materials. We summarize the results of relevant studies in Table 4. Long-term stability of materials and devices is the key issue before large-scale application of 2D lead-free halide perovskites to photovoltaic devices. Some results have shown that hydrophobic long-chain organic amines in two-dimensional perovskites can effectively isolate water and oxygen, thus significantly improving device stability. A lot of work has also proved this conclusion through actual experiments.

Cheng et al.67 used X-ray powder diffraction to compare the moisture stability of 3D MAGeI3 and 2D (PEA)2GeI4. They exposed two powders to stability test conditions at an ambient temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 60%. From Fig. 10a, we can see the obvious characteristic peaks of MAI and GeI4, which represent the products formed by the oxidation and decomposition of MAGeI3 after storing for 2 days, while the spectral peaks of (PEA)2GeI4 almost have no change, as shown in Fig. 10b. This means that the hydrophobic long chain of PEA acts as a barrier to the direct contact between water and the perovskite, thus delaying water degradation and subsequent oxidation. When stored in an inert atmosphere, (PEA)2GeI4 has higher stability and no sign of decomposition.

Qiu et al.68 studied the effects of controlled crystal growth on the stability of photovoltaic devices by adjusting the mixing ratio of two spaced cations, PEA and BA. All the devices were stored in a N2 atmosphere as shown in Fig. 10c. 3D Sn-based devices can only maintain ∼20% initial PCE after 8 days. 2D devices with single BA or PEA retain 50% and 59% initial efficiencies after 8 days, respectively. However, the devices with BA + PEA maintained ∼60% initial PCE even after 24 days. The perovskite films obtained by mixing cationic ligands exhibit smoothness, high orientation and fewer defects, and thus their efficiency and stability are improved.
Cao et al.57 investigated the effect of encapsulation on device stability. As shown in Fig. 10d and e, the stability of 2D devices is better than that of 3D based devices, clearly indicating that encapsulation helps improve stability. The encapsulated 2D Sn4I13 device maintained over 90% initial performance after 1 month, which reduced to 50% after 4 months. While for devices without encapsulation, only after a few minutes, the device performance began to decline dramatically.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
The proposal of 2D lead-free halide perovskites provides a good foundation for future large-scale applications of perovskite optoelectronic devices, and it has also been extended to other technical fields such as lasers, detectors, transistors and so on. This paper mainly concentrates on the structural categories, photoelectric properties and typical application progress of 2D lead-free perovskites. However, current research on 2D lead-free perovskites is still in the early stage, and there is a long way to go to realize high-performance 2D lead-free perovskite optoelectronic devices. In response to this, we expect that the following scientific questions need to be addressed in the near future: (1) exploring new 2D lead-free perovskite materials with a high throughput screening method by artificial intelligence; (2) unveiling the rules of orientated growth for 2D layered lead-free perovskites; (3) balancing high device performance and slightly high n value; (4) new synthetic approaches for air-stable 2D lead-free perovskites; and (5) clarifying the exciton behaviors and mechanism in natural quantum wells. We believe that solving these problems will greatly increase the potential of 2D lead-free halide perovskite materials in practical applications.
