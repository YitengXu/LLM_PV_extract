Here, we investigated the cooperation of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid by combining commercial bis-PCBM mixed isomers as the Lewis acid in the antisolvent and N-(4-bromophenyl)thiourea (BrPh-ThR) as the Lewis base in the perovskite solution precursor. The combination of the Lewis base and the Lewis acid synergistically passivates Pb2+ and PbX3− antisite defects, enlarges the perovskite grain size, and improves charge-carrier separation and transport, leading to improved device efficiency from 19.3% to 21.7%. In addition, this Lewis base and acid combination also suppresses moisture incursion and passivates pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. The unsealed devices remained at 93% of the initial efficiency value in ambient air (10–20% relative humidity) after 3600 h at 20–25 °C and dropped by 10% after 1500 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination and 55 °C in nitrogen with maximum power-point tracking.

Broader context
Rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) during the past several years has made this photovoltaic (PV) technology a serious contender for potential large-scale deployment in the PV market. Achieving long term operational stability at a high efficiency level for PSCs is the most challenging issue toward commercialization of this emerging PV technology. Here, we demonstrate PSCs with simultaneously improved device performance and stability by combining Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM during device fabrication for the first time. Using both a Lewis base and acid can enhance resistance to moisture incursion, passivate defects in the absorber layer, and suppress pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. The combination of Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM positively enhances the crystallization, mobility, and conductivity of perovskites, leading to improved device efficiency from 19.3% to 21.7%. The unsealed devices remained at 93% of the initial efficiency value in ambient air (10–20% relative humidity) after 3600 h at 20–25 °C and dropped by 10% after 1500 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination and 55 °C in nitrogen with maximum power-point tracking. This promising approach provides a simple route for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potential low cost. In only eight years, their PCEs have increased dramatically from 3.8% to more than 22%.1–4 To date, many fabrication methods have been proposed and demonstrated to produce high-quality perovskite films.5–10 Among them, the antisolvent-assisted one-step method is a well-proven effective strategy for obtaining perovskite films with good uniformity and suitable grain sizes.5,10
In high-quality perovskite polycrystalline films, the bulk defect densities are often lower than the surface trap densities, contributing to the high PCE of PSCs.11 Grain boundaries (GBs) as well as the surfaces in the perovskite thin films can significantly affect charge transport, recombination kinetics, device performance, and stability.12 Owing to the ionic character of solution-processed perovskite semiconductors, the inherent ionic defects in the perovskite can also bring some undesired issues, such as hysteresis behavior and device instability.13,14 These and other results indicate that defect-induced electronic trap states at the perovskite surface and GBs should be minimized for optimal device performance. Post-passivation treatment has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce the defect density in the perovskite films via bonding with uncoordinated halide or metal ions from perovskite crystals.15,16 It was demonstrated that the treatment of perovskite crystal surfaces with Lewis base molecules (such as thiophene, pyridine, thiourea, TDZDT, IT-M, 2-pyridylthiourea, DR3T etc.) could efficiently passivate the under-coordinated Pb atoms and thus improve performance and stability.15,17–27 Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM),28–30 potassium iodide (KI),31,32 and zinc chloride (ZnCl)33 as Lewis acids were also applied in the perovskite-solution precursor to improve film formation and increase environmental stability. Realizing stability at these efficiencies is critical to advancing PSCs, and the degradation in perovskite-based solar cells can stem from a myriad of sources within the device.34 The deleterious impact of the intrusion of water/oxygen molecules into the perovskite active-layer is well documented but can be relieved via engineering of the interfaces within the device stack.35 Moreover, recent studies show that defects, likely prevalent at GBs, play an important role in triggering the moisture-induced degradation process.
In this paper, we applied commercial bis-PCBM mixed isomers as the Lewis acid in the antisolvent and N-(4-bromophenyl)thiourea (BrPh-ThR) as the Lewis base in the perovskite-solution precursor to investigate the cooperation of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid. Lewis acids can accept an electron from the negatively-charged Pb–I antisite defects (PbI3−) or under-coordinated halide ions, and thus, passivate the halide-induced deep traps.36–38 Lewis bases usually function as electron donors, which can bind to the positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+ ions.17–22 However, most of these passivation molecules should only passivate one type of defect. Our results show that the synergistic combination of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid can passivate both defects, enlarge the perovskite grain size, and improve charge-carrier separation and transport. Thus, compared with 19.3% for the control, a PCE of 20.4% is obtained for only using BrPh-ThR in the precursor, 20.5% for only using bis-PCBM in the antisolvent, and a PCE of 21.7% when combining the bis-PCBM-laced antisolvent along with BrPh-ThR in the precursor. Importantly, this PCE remained at 93% and 90% of the initial value, respectively, after 3600 h in ambient air (10–20% relative humidity) at 20–25 °C and after 1500 h under continuous full-sun illumination with maximum power-point tracking.
Result and discussion
A schematic illustration of the Lewis acid- and Lewis base-assisted growth process for the perovskite layer is shown in Fig. 1. The mixed-cation perovskite [(FAI)0.81(PbI2)0.85(MABr)0.15(PbBr2)0.15] precursor is prepared from a solution of formamidinium iodide (FAI), PbI2, methylammonium bromide (MABr), and PbBr2 in a mixed solvent of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with 1.35 M Pb2+ (PbI2 and PbBr2) and certain amount of BrPh-ThR. This precursor is then spin-coated on mesoporous TiO2. During the last 15 s of a second spin-coating step, 110 μL of bis-PCBM containing chlorobenzene (CB) is dropped onto the above film to promote the formation of an intermediate phase and the cooperation of Lewis base BrPh-ThR. BrPh-ThR as an S-donor has a strong ability to coordinate with PbI2 to gain the flexibility of tuning the coordination strength which is beneficial for the perovskite formation process and passivating the Pb2+ defects as a bifunctional Lewis base. The bis-PCBM is expected to improve the grain size and facilitate perovskite growth in its preferred direction. The intermolecular force of BrPh-ThR with a benzene ring may cause the molecular polymerization to destroy the ordered structure and affect the electron transport. The bis-PCBM can also passivate the key PbX3− antisite defects and lead to better dispersion of BrPh-ThR. As a result, the interaction of the two molecules can work synergistically.

To examine this hypothesis, we performed liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy and the results are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). When adding some PbI2 in the solution, the signals of –NH– and –NH2 in the BrPh-ThR and –CH3 in bis-PCBM were all shifted, indicating the formation of –CS–˙Pb and –CO–R–CO–˙Pb, respectively. The presence of [(FAI)0.81(PbI2)0.85(MABr)0.15(PbBr2)0.15] induces a stronger chemical shift than that in the PbI2 solution, indicating the possible formation of MA(FA)I(Br)˙Br–CS–˙Pb and MA(FA)I(Br)˙–CO–R–CO–˙Pb, respectively. When we added BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM in the perovskite solution at the same time, the chemical shift was larger than that using either BrPh-ThR or bis-PCBM, indicating the synergistic effect from the cooperation of these two compounds.
To get insight into the surface-defect passivation effect of BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM for perovskite films, we performed photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements for the corresponding samples on a glass substrate. When compared with the pristine perovskite film, the normalized steady-state PL spectra, shown in Fig. 2a, indicate blue shifting of 4 nm, 5 nm, and 7 nm, respectively, for BrPh-ThR-containing (referred to as Type A), bis-PCBM-containing (referred to as Type B), and BrPh-ThR along with bis-PCBM-containing (referred to as Type C) perovskite layers as shown in Fig. 2a. Such blue shifting and line narrowing is attributed to a decrease of spontaneous non-radiative recombination from trap states, which could account for the increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).39 TRPL decay data are presented in Fig. 2b and fitted to eqn (S3) derived in the ESI.†40 This equation was reduced to an exponential rate law at longer times. Linear fits of the curves in the time domain are excellent, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and yield the lifetimes for nonradiative carrier recombination listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The lifetimes follow the order: Type C film > Type B film > Type A film > pristine control perovskite film. This further confirms the synergistic effect of using both a Lewis base (BrPh-ThR) and a Lewis acid (bis-PCBM) on passivating defects in perovskite films, which again is consistent with the higher Voc and FF of the corresponding PSC.41

To assess the defect density and charge transport, we conducted space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements of the corresponding perovskite films; the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the different devices are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and corresponding data are summarized in Fig. 2c. Typical three region I–V curves were observed in both devices in a log–log representation. In the low-bias region, the current density is proportional to voltage, which reflects an ohmic contact with the electrode. With increasing bias, the current density increased abruptly, corresponding to a trap-filled limit (TFL) current.42 We calculated the trap-state density (Nt) using the TFL voltage equation Nt = 2εε0VTFL/qd2, where ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, q is the elementary charge, d is the thickness of the perovskite film, and is determined from the J–V curve.43 The presumptions of this analysis may be questioned in the context of the halide perovskite materials; however, it provides a relative measure of the trap densities and we can estimate the trap densities for corresponding perovskite films. The trap density of the Type C perovskite film is substantially lower than that of the other three films, which is consistent with the PL/TRPL results as well as the higher Voc and FF in PSCs. We also calculated the mobility of the different perovskite films using the equation J = 9εε0μV2/8d2. The mobility values were estimated to be 9.26, 13.71, 16.52, and 20.91 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite films. The improved mobility and lifetime are consistent with the higher short-circuit voltage (Jsc) and FF of the corresponding PSCs.44
It is generally established that localized defects in the perovskite GBs and grain interiors (GIs) may serve as recombination centers, which are detrimental to PSC performance. Moreover, these localized defects may result in inefficient photo carrier separation and transport, leading to poor conducting properties of perovskite films.22,45 We carried out conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) to investigate the conducting properties of the corresponding perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S5c–f (ESI†), the control sample showed comparatively low current signal, which indicates poor electrical conductivity of the perovskite films. In contrast, the perovskite films with BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM present a significantly increased current signal at both the GBs and GIs, which suggests that surface trap states can be efficiently passivated with BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM; this correlates well with decreased trap density (SCLC) and improved carrier lifetime (TRPL). It is worth noting that the GBs show brighter contrast than GIs, revealing relatively higher current flow associated with more efficient charge transfer, which is in good agreement with the previous report.46
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to study the crystalline structure of perovskite films on m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO substrates (Fig. 2d). The XRD patterns depict a set of characteristic peaks, which indicate tetragonal perovskite structure. XRD spectra exhibit similar, strong, and sharp perovskite characteristic peaks. The intensity of the Type C perovskite film at the (110) peak becomes stronger and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased (Fig. S6a and b, ESI†) when compared with the pristine/Type B/Type C perovskite films; it shows that bis-PCBM and BrPh-ThR can improve the crystallization of the perovskite and/or more-preferred (110) orientation. We attribute the improved crystallization process to the templating effect of bis-PCBM and BrPh-ThR on the crystal growth. We ascribe the high-quality crystallization as one of the main factors for improved device performance.47
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the corresponding perovskite films deposited on m-TiO2/c-TiO2/FTO substrates are presented in Fig. 3. As illustrated from the top-view SEM, the change in morphology is consistent with an increase in the grain size of the perovskite film with the use of either BrPh-ThR or bis-PCBM, and it directs most GBs to assume a perpendicular orientation to the substrate. After the use of both, the grain size becomes larger and thus it reduces the GB density. Hence, BrPh-ThR along with bis-PCBM appears to improve the grain size and facilitate perovskite growth with the preferred direction. The morphologies of the perovskite thin films with and without BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM were further studied by AFM, as shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†). It can be found that with BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM, the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the perovskite film became smaller than that of the control films. The result shows that with the cooperation of BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM, the perovskite thin film can be smoother and more uniform, which are beneficial for effective charge transport and higher photovoltaic performance.48 Fig. S6c (ESI†) presents the absorption spectra of the corresponding films. Compared with the pristine control perovskite film, obvious absorption enhancement is observed in almost the entire visible-light region for perovskite films using BrPh-ThR and/or bis-PCBM; this enhancement likely originates from the contribution of their impact on the larger grain size and more uniform crystal formation of the perovskite. These results could contribute to the much enhanced Jsc in the corresponding PSCs.

Fig. 4a shows contact-angle measurements of a deionized water droplet with the corresponding perovskite film. The derived contact angles are 57.6°, 68.1°, 69.2°, and 77.8°, respectively, for the pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C films. This trend reflects a strong increase in the hydrophobicity of the perovskite upon incorporation of the BrPh-ThR along with bis-PCBM, resulting in its greatly enhanced stability against degradation in humid air. We exposed unsealed films of pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite thin films to an ambient environment of 45% relative humidity, and periodically recorded their XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 4b. The decomposition of perovskite in moist air is known to lead to the formation of a PbI2 phase. The ratio of PbI2 (2θ = 12.5°) to perovskite (2θ = 13.8°) of the pristine control perovskite increases faster than that of Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite films after 30 days. The Type C perovskite film turned out to be the most stable one in this test environment, indicating that stability is improved after the Lewis acid and Lewis base cooperation. The enhanced stability of the Type C perovskite film can also be seen from Fig. 4c which shows that the color of the Type C perovskite film remains persistent; whereas, those of the Type A and Type B perovskite films change slightly and the pristine control perovskite film almost turned to yellow.

The cell architecture in this study adopted the traditional mesoporous structure with a full device stack Au/spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/mesoporous TiO2/compact TiO2/FTO. The typical J–V curves of pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite-based PSCs under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5a–d, and corresponding data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The control device delivers a champion PCE of 19.3%, with a Voc of 1.10 V, Jsc of 23.13 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.73, which is consistent with a previous report.49 In contrast, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite-based devices displayed better performance with PCEs of 20.4%, 20.5%, and 21.7%, respectively. As previously reported,19,28 Lewis acid bis-PCBM or Lewis base thiourea plays a critical role in improving the quality of the active layer with larger grains and fewer grain boundaries, which result in obviously enhanced Jsc and FF. This study shows that the combination of a Lewis base and a Lewis acid substantially enhances cell performance. We ascribed the improved Jsc and FF with the Type C perovskite to mainly the higher conductivity (Fig. S5, ESI†), higher mobility (Fig. 2c and Table S3, ESI†), lower trap density, and larger grains and fewer grain boundaries. The hysteresis losses calculated from the equation  of devices based on pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite films are 2.08%, 0.49%, 0.48%, and 0.46%, respectively. The origination of hysteresis in PSCs is reported to be due to the trap state of charge carriers, ion charge carriers, ion migration, and ferroelectricity, which are related to grain size and defect density.50,51 The Type C perovskite with the combination of the Lewis base and the Lewis acid shows the largest grain size, lowest trap density, highest carrier mobility, and highest conductivity resulting in the most negligible hysteresis. The stabilized power outputs from devices based on pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite films are 19.1%, 20.3%, 20.4%, and 21.5%, respectively (Fig. 5e), which are consistent with the obtained PCEs.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells based on the corresponding perovskite layers are presented in Fig. 5f. The integrated current densities estimated from the IPCE spectra are: 21.6, 22.1, 22.2, and 22.7 mA cm−2 for pristine, Type A, Type B, and Type C perovskite film-based solar cells, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. The reproducibility of the device performance was evaluated by characterizing about 20 cells. Histograms of the PCE parameters of these devices (Fig. 6a–d) indicate excellent reproducibility.

The long-term stability of PSCs is a challenging issue and can be significantly impacted by the choice of device architecture that will modulate the role of the atmosphere.52 The initial stability data of PSCs are shown in Fig. 6e, f and Fig. S8 (ESI†) for tests of the corresponding PSCs without encapsulation under an ambient environment of 10–20% relative humidity at 20–25 °C and under continuous full-sun illumination with maximum power-point tracking in a nitrogen atmosphere at 55 °C. These studies provide clear evidence that the use of bis-PCBM and BrPh-ThR does not introduce any additional instability for the active layers in this device architecture, and the device based on the combination of BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM presents a further, very substantial increase in stability over the control device. For example, Fig. 6e shows the Type C device using the combination of BrPh-ThR and bis-PCBM maintained 93.2% of its initial PCE after 3600 h without encapsulation; under the same conditions, the measured PCEs decreased to 71.7%, 67.6%, and 32.6% of their initial values, respectively, in the Type B, Type A, and pristine perovskite-based devices. Stability data presented in Fig. 6f indicate that there is only a 10% efficiency drop after 1500 h of continuous 1-sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere with maximum power-point tracking for a Type C PSC. At the same time, the PCEs decreased by 23.6%, 32.1% and 86.1% of their initial values, respectively, in the Type B, Type A, and pristine perovskite-based solar cells. The Type C perovskite solar cells also presented better stability than that of Type B, Type A, and pristine perovskite-based solar cells at 85 °C in the dark in an ambient environment of 10–20% relative humidity without any encapsulation as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The improved efficiency without compromise in stability for these device architectures indicates the use of both Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM in perovskite preparation can further enhance PSC stability and technological viability. This is consistent with the ability of this treatment to limit defect-enhanced interaction between organic species (MA and FA), impacting the [PbX6]4− (X: Br and I) octahedral as well as limiting the other moisture-sensitive defects (Pb2+). The structural, morphological, and hydrophobicity that result in defect passivation also appear to result in practical improvements that aid stability (e.g., fewer pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD layer (Fig. S10, ESI†), larger grain size, and less pronounced boundaries), which should translate into improvements in other device architectures.22,49,50,53,54
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated PSCs with simultaneously improved device performance and stability by combining Lewis base BrPh-ThR in the perovskite-solution precursor and Lewis acid bis-PCBM in the antisolvent during the device fabrication for the first time. The Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM can enhance resistance to moisture incursion, passivate the defects in the absorber layer, and suppress pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. The combination of Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM positively enhances the crystallization, mobility, and conductivity of perovskites. These beneficial factors lead to much improved device performance and stability. This promising approach provides a simple route for fabricating highly efficient and stable bulk-heterojunction PSCs.

Broader context
Rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) during the past several years has made this photovoltaic (PV) technology a serious contender for potential large-scale deployment in the PV market. Achieving long term operational stability at a high efficiency level for PSCs is the most challenging issue toward commercialization of this emerging PV technology. Here, we demonstrate PSCs with simultaneously improved device performance and stability by combining Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM during device fabrication for the first time. Using both a Lewis base and acid can enhance resistance to moisture incursion, passivate defects in the absorber layer, and suppress pinholes generated in the hole-transporting layer. The combination of Lewis base BrPh-ThR and Lewis acid bis-PCBM positively enhances the crystallization, mobility, and conductivity of perovskites, leading to improved device efficiency from 19.3% to 21.7%. The unsealed devices remained at 93% of the initial efficiency value in ambient air (10–20% relative humidity) after 3600 h at 20–25 °C and dropped by 10% after 1500 h under continuous operation at 1-sun illumination and 55 °C in nitrogen with maximum power-point tracking. This promising approach provides a simple route for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs.
