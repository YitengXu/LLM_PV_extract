    , Accepted 27th March 2023First published on 28th March 2023AbstractAchieving efficient exciton dissociation and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) becomes a great challenge when the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) reaches an upper limit value of 1.3 V or higher. The balanced intermolecular interactions of donor/donor (D/D), acceptor/acceptor (A/A) and donor/acceptor (D/A) determine the molecular stacking, crystallinity, morphology and subsequent exciton dissociation, but there is a lack of relevant material design guidelines to simultaneously modulate the three interactions. Herein, we rationally design a terpolymer E18 by introducing a 20% proportion of the side chain with a chlorine atom and bulky alkyl chain to the classic p-type polymer D18, and we also obtain a non-fullerene acceptor BTA3-4F by adding four fluorine atoms on the side chain of the middle D unit of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type molecule BTA3. As expected, the collaborative material design guarantees that E18:BTA3-4F achieves the balanced A/A, D/D and D/A intermolecular interactions in the blend film, resulting in tighter large-area molecular stacking and excellent vertical phase separation. Thus, the nonhalogenated solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) processed OPV device based on E18:BTA3-4F realizes the highest PCE of 10.03% with a VOC of 1.30 V and a non-radiative energy loss (ΔE3) of 0.18 eV. In contrast, the E18:BTA3 combination exhibits a VOC of 1.32 V and a ΔE3 of 0.12 eV with an inferior PCE of 4.98%. Our results provide wide bandgap material design guidelines to optimize intermolecular interactions, and thus realize efficient exciton dissociation for the OPV devices with a VOC of 1.3 V or higher.

Broader context
Exploring the upper limit of open-circuit voltage (VOC) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is important, which not only provides insight into the mechanism of exciton dissociation but also expands the applications in indoor photovoltaics, ternary devices and tandem devices. However, the boost of VOC is usually at the expense of a significant loss of JSC and PCE. When VOC reaches 1.3 V or higher, their performance is always restricted to a low level below 6% because efficient exciton dissociation becomes a huge challenge in this case. Herein, we co-designed the donor and acceptor materials to accurately modulate the D/A, A/A and D/D intermolecular interactions and obtained a more regular molecular arrangement. The improved vertical phase separation of the bulk heterojunction contributes to a long exciton lifetime and fast exciton dissociation. The non-halogenated solvent THF-processed photovoltaic device of E18:BTA3-4F achieved a recorded efficiency of 10.04% with a VOC of 1.3 V. Our results emphasize that the precise modulation of intermolecular interactions is an effective strategy to achieve efficient exciton dissociation at a low energy level offset.

Introduction
For bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is well known that the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is determined by the energy offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor (ΔEHOMO(D)–LUMO(A)). However, the increased ΔEHOMO(D)–LUMO(A) inevitably decreases the energy offset of HOMO (ΔEHOMO) or LUMO (ΔELUMO) between the donor and acceptor, resulting in inefficient exciton dissociation.1,2 Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that OPVs containing narrow bandgap (NBG) acceptors, represented by Y6 with a small ΔEHOMO, can also provide efficient exciton dissociation to achieve a high performance of approximately 19%.3–7 The researchers conclude that this may be mainly related to the high crystallinity induced by the π–π stacking of the three-dimensional interpenetrating network formed by the strong intermolecular interactions of the Y-series molecules,8–10 which can trigger the generation of weakly bound intra-moiety excited (i-EX)11 states that can promote hole transfer for charge separation rather than relying on the formation of interfacial charge transfer (CT) states for interfacial exciton dissociation. Furthermore, Xiao et al. proved that ultrafast hole transfer in OPVs based on medium bandgap (MBG) polymers, such as N2200, is attributed to intermolecular interaction and morphology-mediated intra-moiety polaron pairs (iPPs) generated upon optical excitation.12 These results strongly suggest that preferable intermolecular interaction is the pivotal factor for efficient and fast charge generation at a low-energy offset.
In fact, compared to the NBG Y-series molecules and MBG N2200 acceptor, wide bandgap (WBG) acceptors are also a very important category, especially for the wide application in ternary devices, tandem devices and indoor photovoltaics.13–15 Among them, A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type molecules, represented by O-IDTBR16 and BTA3,17 can realize relatively high VOC (1.05–1.24 V)13,18–25 owing to their WBG and low energy loss. However, as shown in Fig. 1a, when OPVs reach an upper limit VOC of 1.3 V or higher, their performance is always restricted to a very low level (PCE = 0.07–6.0%), which is usually attributed to the sharply decreased JSC resulting from the small ΔEHOMO or ΔELUMO. In fact, photovoltaic devices, such as inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs), could realize a high VOC beyond 1.3 V with promising PCEs of 16–18%,26–28 because the photogenerated excitons in PSCs can effectively dissociate without energy offset because of the small exciton binding energy. Thus, it is imperative to clarify the decisive factors that influence the realization of efficient exciton dissociation in WBG OPV systems. The implementation of high-performance OPVs with a VOC of 1.3 V or higher could provide promising front sub-cell for tandem devices and show large potential for application under indoor light. In addition, the deep mechanism understanding of efficient exciton dissociation at 1.3 V VOC also helps to promote the further improvement of PCE to a level above 20%.

However, the aforementioned issues are still not extensively studied and understood because of technical difficulties. First, the global analysis of the charge dynamic of excited species is greatly hampered by the extreme overlap of absorption spectra between the WBG donors and acceptors. Second, the relatively weak crystallization of most WBG acceptors makes it difficult to obtain a complete single-crystal structure, which is important for understanding the factors responsible for efficient exciton dissociation. Finally, promising WBG electron acceptors and synthesis strategies are lacking, leading to a poor understanding of the structure–properties relationship. Therefore, it is crucial to synergistically develop novel WBG donor polymers and NFAs and unravel the intermolecular interactions associated with the film morphology, molecular stacking and crystallinity.29–31 In principle, the balanced A/A, D/D and D/A intermolecular interactions are important for constructing ideal molecular stacking and modulating the BHJ micromorphology to enhance the device performance. However, how to control the intermolecular interactions by material design, and thus affect the molecular stacking and subsequent charge separation and transport paths, is unclear, particularly for high VOC OPV systems.
Obviously, it is a great challenge for the synergistic design of the combined D/A photovoltaic materials to realize an upper limit VOC of 1.3 V or higher with a high PCE. The energy levels of the D/A should be fine-tuned, especially the HOMO of donors and the LUMO of acceptors, to ensure a theoretically ultra-high VOC of 1.3 V and above. However, there should be suitable molecular engineering to fine-tune the properties of D/A materials, which contributes to achieving appropriate intermolecular interactions to construct superior BHJ morphologies. Of course, it is more desirable if the solubility of the relevant combined D/A materials is suitable for non-halogenated solvent processing. Based on all the above considerations, in this study, we collaboratively design a p-type terpolymer and n-type small molecule material. For the p-type donor, we maintain the conjugated backbone of highly crystalline polymer D1832 and introduce a 20% proportion conjugated thiophene side chain containing a chlorine atom and a large side chain, as shown in Fig. 1b. The molecular design of terpolymer E18 is based on the following considerations: (1) chlorine atom substitution was applied to obtain the deeper HOMO to realize a higher VOC;33 (2) extended bulky alkyl chains were employed to regulate the crystallinity34 and increase the solubility in tetrahydrofuran (THF); (3) terpolymerization diminishes the obvious changes in the crystallinity and photoelectric properties of the initial D18 but achieves fine-tuning of energy levels as well as intermolecular interactions between D/D or D/A.35
For the design of the acceptor, we chose a WBG acceptor BTA317 with a higher LUMO to combine with E18, providing a theoretically high VOC. Herein, we utilized a fluorine substitution strategy on the side chain to systematically investigate the effect of fine-tuned intermolecular interactions on device performance mainly for the following reasons. First, for A–DA′D–A type NBG NFAs, fluorine or chlorine substitution on the terminal A unit is a commonly used strategy to regulate molecular crystallinity and intermolecular stacking.36 However, this modification on the molecular backbone significantly downshifts the molecular energy levels owing to the strong electron-withdrawing ability, resulting in a significant decrease in VOC.37 On the contrary, fluorination on the side chain should have less impact on the electrical and optical properties of the molecule because its distance is far from the conjugated backbone. Hence, we obtained BTA3-4F by fluorine substitution on the benzene side chains of the central core of BTA3 (Fig. 1b). Finally, we matched BTA3 and BTA3-4F with E18 to investigate the effects of A/A, D/D and D/A intermolecular interactions on the exciton dissociation and photovoltaic performance in the case of ∼1.3 V VOC with low ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO.
The research results suggest that fluorine-substituted BTA3-4F exhibits a slightly downshifted energy level and a slight absorption blue shift than BTA3. However, BTA3-4F counterintuitively exhibits reduced crystallinity in the pristine film but with stronger intermolecular interactions induced by the fluorine-substituted side chain on unit D. The introduction of the designed terpolymer E18 excitingly enhances the ordered stacking of BTA3-4F in blend film, which may be attributed to the balanced intermolecular interactions between A/A and D/A that occurred in the blend film of E18:BTA3-4F, thus providing a suitable phase separation scale favorable for charge separation and transport. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results show that the E18:BTA3-4F-based blend film exhibits a large area parallel and ordered π–π stacking with a shorter D/A spacing distance of 3.73 Å and a higher g(r) peak intensity. These data suggest that it possesses enhanced D/A intermolecular interactions and increased D/A interfaces, which contribute to providing additional exciton dissociation and charge transport channels. Consequently, the non-halogenated solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF)-processed device based on E18:BTA3-4F exhibits an excellent PCE of 10.03% with a VOC of 1.30 V, which is by far the highest performance with a VOC of up to 1.3 V (as shown in Fig. 1a). The optimal device based on E18:BTA3 exhibits a PCE of 4.98% with a slightly higher VOC of 1.32 V, affording the minimum non-radiative energy loss of 0.12 eV, which is one of the lowest values for OPVs. It is thus clear that the precise design of the D/A structure can synergistically optimize the intermolecular interactions of A/A, D/D and D/A to obtain the desired molecular stacking, D/A spacing distance and blend film morphology for improving exciton dissociation and free charge transport efficiency, which is meaningful for balancing VOC and JSC to achieve high-performance OPVs with a super-high VOC of 1.3 V.
Results and discussion
Structure characterization, optical and electrochemical properties
The chemical structures of donors and acceptors are shown in Fig. 1b, and the synthesis routes of the terpolymer E18 and the small molecule acceptor BTA3-4F are presented in ESI;† the corresponding 1H NMR and 13C NMR are shown in Fig. S1–S7 (ESI†). The average molecular weight (Mn) of the terpolymer E18 is 22.7 kDa with an appropriate PDI of 2.2 (Fig. S8, ESI†). In addition, the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) is 375 °C for E18 and 394 °C for both BTA3 and BTA3-4F (Fig. S9, ESI†). The same Td for both acceptors indicates that fluorine substitution does not change the thermal stability of the molecule.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the relevant materials in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and thin film processed by THF are shown in Fig. S10a and Fig. 2a (ESI†). The maximum absorption peaks of E18, BTA3 and BTA3-4F in the THF solution state are 552, 588 and 580 nm, respectively (Fig. S10a, ESI†). The maximum absorption peaks of the acceptor molecules in the film processed by THF are significantly red-shifted compared to those in the THF solution, which are 585/635 nm for the BTA3 film and 580/620 nm for the BTA3-4F film, respectively, indicating that the solid film presents stronger intermolecular interaction. Compared with the BTA3 film, the slightly blue-shifted absorption band edge of the BTA3-4F film may be due to its increased band gap and weaker molecular stacking. However, the blend film based on E18:BTA3-4F shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†) exhibits stronger absorption than that based on E18:BTA3 in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm, indicating its higher photon absorption. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of E18, BTA3 and BTA3-4F is 1.99 eV, 1.75 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively, obtained from the absorption onset of the film. The temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption in solution of CB and THF illustrated in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI†) indicates that BTA3 and BTA3-4F possess similar molecular preaggregation characteristics, which often occur in many high-performance photovoltaic materials.38 The relevant optical properties are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed to characterize the electrochemical potential of the three materials (Fig. S13, ESI†). The detailed EHOMO and ELUMO are demonstrated in Table S2 in the ESI.† As depicted in Fig. 2b, for the energy levels of the relevant molecules, the EHOMO/ELUMO is −5.54/−3.64 eV for E18, −5.59/−3.71 eV for BTA3 and −5.63/−3.74 eV for BTA3-4F. The ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO between E18 and BTA3/BTA3-4F exhibit small differences, both located within 0.1 eV, suggesting that the slight change in energy level caused by fluorine substitution might not be the main factor affecting its carrier dynamics. Furthermore, Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows the calculated optimal conformation and electron cloud distribution of the frontier molecular orbital of the donor polymer and two small molecule acceptors by density functional theory (DFT) based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set.39 The similar and small dihedral angles of the BTA3 and BTA3-4F shown in Fig. S14a and b (ESI†) indicate that the central core side chain fluorine substitution exhibits a negligible effect on the molecular planarity. However, the donor molecule exhibits a slightly distorted conformation with a larger dihedral angle. Moreover, fluorine substitution slightly affects the molecular electron cloud distribution, as shown in Fig. S14c (ESI†). The EHOMO and ELUMO energy levels are −4.93/−2.63 eV for E18, and those based on BTA3-4F are −5.32/−3.19 eV, which is lower than that of BTA3, which is −5.21/−3.13 eV. Ultimately, the calculated band gap of BTA3-4F is 2.13 eV, which is slightly greater than that of BTA3 (2.08 eV). The results of the DFT calculation and CV test indicate that fluorine substitutions have minimal changes in the energy levels of the acceptor molecules, suggesting that the differences in the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices may originate primarily from the morphology and intermolecular interactions. Fig. 2c shows the structure of the conventional devices applied in this study.
Intermolecular interaction between A/A and D/A
Density functional theory (DFT) based on the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) basis set39 was applied to investigate the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and intermolecular interactions between A/A or D/A. Fig. 2d shows the ESP distribution of the donors and acceptors. The surface electrostatic potential of the donor E18 is predominantly negative with the most negative ESP on the dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6] benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) unit, indicating that this is the region where intermolecular interactions are most likely to occur. Furthermore, both small molecule acceptor surfaces exhibit relatively strong positive potentials, and the fluorine substitution slightly affects the ESP of the conjugated molecular backbone but primarily affects the ESP distribution of the side chains. Compared to that of BTA3, the side chains based on BTA3-4F have more negative potential, mainly attributed to the stronger attraction of fluorine atoms to the electron cloud. Moreover, the dipole moment (μ) of BTA3-4F is 1.70 D, which is greater than that of BTA3 (μ = 0.26 D), implying that it may inspire stronger intermolecular interactions between A/A and D/A and thus achieve efficient charge transfer.40
Furthermore, the side and top views based on the optimized intermolecular stacking between A/A and D/A are illustrated in Fig. 2e–h and Fig. S15 (ESI†), respectively. The fluorine substitution does not affect the molecular stacking between A/A, which mainly adopts the heteronuclear stacking mode between π-bridged BTA and the end-group of 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine (RCN). The intermolecular interactions between D/A mainly originate from the π–π stacking between the electron-deficient terminal groups of the RCN or BTA π-bridge and the DTBT electron-rich core backbone, where there exists a larger electrostatic potential difference. Thus, this type of molecular stacking is relatively reasonable. The higher interaction energy of −52.31 kcal mol−1 for the A/A stacking based on BTA3-4F than that of −50.23 kcal mol−1 for BTA3 indicates the presence of a stronger intermolecular interaction in the film of BTA3-4F, which may be attributed to the fact that the central nuclear side chain fluorine substitution forms hydrogen bonding interactions between D-units but weakens the π–π stacking of the terminal groups.41 Thus, BTA3-4F exhibits a slightly larger π–π stacking distance of 3.16 Å than that of 3.14 Å for BTA3. However, compared to the respective A/A interaction energy, the D/A interaction energy between E18 and BTA3 is higher, whereas the D/A interaction energy between E18 and BTA3-4F is slightly lower, suggesting that more balanced intermolecular interaction and favorable molecular stacking are achieved in the E18:BTA3-4F-based blend film. However, the higher D/A interaction energy between E18 and BTA3 may damage the molecular packing of BTA3. Notably, the slightly greater interaction energy of A/A based on BTA3-4F indicates that BTA3-4F may form larger pure acceptor domains and more regular molecular arrangements in the blend film of E18:BTA3-4F.
In addition to the theoretical simulation calculations, we attempted to obtain single crystals of small molecule acceptors for the analysis of actual intermolecular interactions and π–π stacking, but the poor crystallinity of BTA3 and BTA3-4F as well as their long alkyl chains in the side chains makes it very difficult to obtain an entire single crystal. Hence, in this study, we performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the analysis of the actual molecular intermolecular interactions. We focus on the effect of fluorine substitution on A/A molecular intermolecular interactions, while D/A and D/D molecular interactions are discussed below. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), DSC results show that compared to BTA3 with a melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of 44.88 J g−1, the fluorine substituted acceptor BTA3-4F exhibits a slightly higher ΔHm of 45.33 J g−1, indicating its more compact crystalline state probably caused by its stronger intermolecular interaction. This stronger intermolecular interaction of BTA3-4F may result from the larger dipole between fluorine-substituted side chains on the D unit.42 This result agrees well with the DFT calculation. Conversely, the greater crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) of 19.45 J g−1 for BTA3, while 8.87 J g−1 for BTA3-4F, demonstrates the presence of stronger crystallinity in the BTA3 molecule, which is consistent with the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results and is discussed later.
D/A molecular stacking and spacing distances
To further investigate the effect of structure-dependent intermolecular interactions on the molecular stacking of blend films, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations43 were performed in this study. Fig. 3a and b shows the workflow of model construction, where a single repetitive unit model was constructed by adopting the D/A mass ratio of 1:1; then, 20 repetitive units were subjected to MD simulations. The individual conformation and D/A intermolecular interaction analysis extracted from the MD simulation results are shown in Fig. 3c and d. The MD simulation results show that the separate conformation extracted from E18:BTA3-based MD simulation presents a spherical stacking similar to that of fullerene clusters. In contrast, the molecular chain based on E18:BTA3-4F stretches out to fill the entire space, enabling the D/A molecular conjugate skeleton close to parallel and facilitating the realization of the tight and large parallel π–π stacking between E18 and BTA3-4F. In addition, to quantify the D/A interactions, the center of mass radial distribution function (RDF) between D/A was plotted (Fig. 3e). The two blend systems exhibit similar RDF curves, but compared to the BTA3 system with a D/A spacing distance of 4.05 Å, the BTA3-4F-based system exhibits a smaller D/A spacing distance of 3.73 Å and correspondingly larger peak intensity. We suspect that this may be attributed to the improved D/A intermolecular interactions by F-substituted side chains, providing more additional permeation paths of D/A interfacial contacts for exciton dissociation and charge transport, accordingly resulting in impressive performance in E18:BTA3-4F-based devices.

Film morphology and crystallinity
Intermolecular interactions can induce the multiple film morphology of BHJ, which plays an important role in exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the effects of bulk and surface morphology related to intermolecular interactions on photovoltaic performance. The active layer samples shown in Fig. 4 are all the annealed samples. Fig. 4a shows a TEM image of the blend film. Significant phase separation can be observed in the bulk morphology based on E18:BTA3-4F, which may be attributed to the fact that the BTA3-4F small molecule acceptor has a certain molecular stacking in the blend film, forming pure domain phase regions, as proven by the DFT and GIWAXS data. The formation of continuous charge transport channels in E18:BTA3-4F film contributes to its high JSC and FF values.44 However, the film based on E18:BTA3 exhibits a relatively homogeneous bulk morphology and weak phase separation. This excessive weak phase separation can predispose to a severe loss of charge recombination, thus leading to lower FF and JSC values.

In addition, the AFM height images are shown in Fig. 4b. Compared with the E18:BTA3 (root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.48 nm), the film based on E18:BTA3-4F shows a slightly larger RMS of 1.78 nm, indicating its slightly stronger molecular aggregation characteristics, which can also be observed in the line profiles extracted from the AFM height images (Fig. 4c). The line profiles clearly illustrate that the aggregation amplitude of the BTA3-4F-based film is significantly greater than that of the BTA3-based film. As shown in the AFM height images and line profiles based on donor and acceptor neat films (placed in Fig. S17, ESI†), donor E18 exhibits a maximum RMS of 2.26 nm, BTA3-4F exhibits a minimum RMS of 1.04 nm, and BTA3 shows a moderate RMS of 1.26 nm. The line profiles indicate that the donor has greater aggregation characteristics. Intriguingly, compared with BTA3, the film based on BTA3-4F exhibits slightly weaker aggregation, which is completely opposite to the blend films. We speculate that this is because the improved intermolecular interaction between A/A and D/A optimized the ordered molecular stacking of BTA3-4F in the blend film, which can be verified in GIWAXS. Thus, the blend film based on E18:BTA3-4F exhibits slightly stronger aggregation characteristics and appropriate phase separation scales to facilitate the achievement of high JSC and FF values.45
The vertical phase distribution of BHJ also plays an important role in exciton dissociation, carrier transport and extraction. Therefore, film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy (FLAS)46 was performed to analyze the effect of fluorine substitution on the distribution of D/A components in the vertical direction along the film-depth. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the FLAS results indicate that the absorption peaks of both blend films exhibit a slight shift in the wavelength range of 550–650 nm, implying that some fluctuations in the spatial distribution exist in the HOMO/LUMO energy level. However, the E18:BTA3-based blend film exhibits more pronounced peak fluctuations than that based on E18:BTA3-4F, indicating that its energy level changes depend on the film depth, which may form the sub-energy trap states to increase charge recombination and impede charge transport.47

The exciton generation contours of the corresponding blend films in Fig. 5c and d show that both blend films generate most of their excitons at a wavelength of about 650 nm. Furthermore, the exciton generation rates simulated from the FLAS in Fig. 5e and f indicate that excitons in the E18:BTA3-based film are mainly generated at a depth of 50 nm close to the anode, suggesting that the dissociated excitons in the active layer need to transport a longer distance to reach the cathode. There is no doubt that the charge recombination probability of this process increases, thereby further blocking electron transport. In contrast, the E18:BTA3-4F-based film produces the most excitons at a depth of 45 nm, close to the middle of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 5g and h, the line profiles of the film-depth-dependent component distribution extracted from the FLAS illustrate more visually that the electron transport based on the BTA3 system is severely hindered owing to its almost zero acceptor component on the top surface in direct contact with the cathode. In contrast, the E18:BTA3-4F-based film possesses richer acceptor components on the top surface, and the acceptor-rich top surface of this BHJ can greatly improve the electron transport and cathode electron collection efficiency.48 Therefore, the FLAS results indicate that fluorine substitution improves the vertical phase distribution of the BHJ, thus partially explaining its more favorable charge transport and carrier extraction.
In addition, we performed GIWAXS to analyze the role of molecular crystallinity related to intermolecular interactions in charge transport and recombination. Fig. 6 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns and line profiles of the relevant molecules. The 2D GIWAXS of the neat films shown in Fig. 6a indicates that all three molecules feature (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of plane (OOP) direction, indicating the adoption of the face-on orientation. However, unsatisfactorily, the fluorine-substituted molecule BTA3-4F exhibits a weaker (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.75 Å−1 than the BTA3 with (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1. The crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of BTA3 and BTA3-4F are 28.44 Å and 6.10 Å, respectively, indicating that the fluorine-substituted BTA3-4F possesses slightly weaker crystallization with smaller CCL compared to BTA3. Notably, compared with D18,49 the terpolymer E18 exhibits only face-on orientation with a (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.66 Å−1 in the OOP direction instead of both face-on and edge-on orientation, and the highly ordered (001) diffraction peak featured by D18 is not observed in the in-plane (IP) direction, which suggests that the D/D intermolecular interactions of terpolymer E18 are modulated by fine-tuning the D18 structure. The reduced D/D intermolecular interactions of E18 facilitate processing with non-halogenated solvents while optimizing the morphology of blend films and enhancing the molecular stacking of D/A.

Moreover, when blending with E18, the blend film based on BTA3-4F exhibits a significantly enhanced (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. 6b and c), which is even stronger than that of the blend film based on BTA3 with (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction. The line profiles obviously reveal that both blend films exhibit (010) diffraction peaks at the same position as the small molecule acceptor in the OOP direction, suggesting that this diffraction peak originates from the acceptor rather than the donor E18. This smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.58 Å for E18:BTA3-4F (while 3.61 Å for E18:BTA3) indicates a tighter molecular stacking prevalent in the blend film. Importantly, the BTA3-4F-based blend film shows a new diffraction peak at qz = 0.46 Å−1 in the OOP direction similar to that of the BTA3 neat film, which was not observed in the BTA3-4F neat film. In contrast, this diffraction peak located at qz = 0.46 Å−1 observed in the BTA3 neat film disappears in the BTA3-based blend film. This observation illustrates that the more orderly molecular stacking and purer domains of BTA3-4F are reconstituted in the blend film compared to BTA3. Hence, the GIWAXS results suggest that although side chain fluorine substitution may decrease molecular crystallinity, the crystallinity of blend films can be enhanced and the molecular stacking as well as domain purity can be optimized by proper modulation of the A/A, D/D and D/A intermolecular interactions, thereby resulting in high-performance photovoltaic devices.
Summarizing all the above morphological characterization results related to intermolecular interactions, we schematically depict the nanoscale morphology of the two NFAs and their mixtures with terpolymer E18, as depicted in Fig. S18 (ESI†). Clearly, the D-unit side chain fluorine substitution significantly reduces the ordered molecular stacking of BTA3-4F, resulting in its low crystallinity. However, the A/A interactions between BTA3-4F molecules were alleviated by the insertion of the elaborated terpolymer E18, and excellent ordered molecular stacking was achieved in the blended films. The resultant blend films based on E18:BTA3-4F realized favorable crystallographic molecular orientation and appropriate scale nanophase separation. Moreover, smaller phase separation and poor molecular stacking were induced owing to the stronger D/A interaction between E18 and BTA3 than the A/A interaction between BTA3. From this analysis, we further conclude that the precise design of the molecular structure can modulate the intermolecular interactions, fine-tune the blend film morphology and eventually change the ordered stacking of crystalline molecules.
Photovoltaic performance and energy loss
Conventional devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al (Fig. 2c) were constructed to investigate the effect of fluorine substitution on photovoltaic performance. Notably, the terpolymer was elaborately designed to enable the device process with a non-halogenated solvent THF, which can facilitate the commercialization of OPVs. In addition, the optimal device performance was presented, as illustrated in Table 1, which can be achieved without any additives, and the detailed optimization process is shown in Tables S3–S6 (ESI†). Remarkably enhanced FF and JSC values are observed in the J–V curves depicted in Fig. 7a, indicating that the fluorine substitution on the central core D-unit greatly improves the performance of the E18:BTA3-4F-based device. The final device based on E18:BTA3-4F obtained a significantly boosted PCE of 10.03% with an increased JSC value of 11.22 mA cm−2 and an FF value of 68.98%, which is significantly higher than that of E18:BTA3 with a PCE value of 4.98%, a JSC value of 6.39 mA cm−2 and an FF value of 58.98%. Compared to the E18:BTA3-based device with a VOC of 1.32 V, the E18:BTA3-4F-based device exhibits a slightly lower VOC of 1.30 V; it achieves a maximum PCE value of 10.03% with a VOC above 1.3 V simultaneously.

The JSC difference between the two devices is more evident in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum plot, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. Both devices exhibit an EQE response in the same wavelength range of 300–700 nm. However, compared to BTA3, the BTA3-4F-based device exhibits a significantly higher EQE value in the full wavelength range with a maximum EQE value of approximately 70%, which is twice the maximum EQE value of 34% for BTA3. Hence, the EQE results illustrate that the BTA3-4F-based system provides a more efficient photon conversion efficiency, which promotes a significant increase in its JSC.
Furthermore, we performed electroluminescent (EL) spectroscopy on the relevant devices to investigate the effect of the fluorine substitution of BTA3 on device voltage loss. Fig. S19 (ESI†) shows the EL spectra of the devices, and both devices exhibit red-shifted EL spectra compared to the neat acceptor devices, indicating that enhanced intermolecular interactions occurred in the blend films. Remarkably, compared to the BTA3 system, a larger red-shift in the EL spectra occurred between the BTA3-4F-only and E18:BTA3-4F-based devices, indicating that the doping of the terpolymer donor E18 significantly enhances the intermolecular interactions in the E18 and BTA3-4F blended films, enabling the EL emission peaks closer to those of the BTA3 system. Based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory model,50 the energy loss can be divided into three parts: ΔETotal = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3, where ΔE1 is the unavoidable radiative recombination loss above the bandgap triggered by entropy enthalpy change, ΔE2 is the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap caused by the charge recombination associated with the bandgap of the blend film, and ΔE3 is the non-radiative recombination loss, which depends on the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the device.
The energy loss analysis results show that fluorine substitution does not affect ΔE1, which is 0.289 eV for both E18:BTA3/BTA3-4F-based devices. However, compared to the E18:BTA3-based device with ΔE2 of 0.097 eV, the BTA3-4F-based device exhibits a slightly larger ΔE2 of 0.098 eV owing to its larger bandgap. In addition, the ΔE3 of the device can be quantified by measuring the EQEEL using the following formula: ΔE3 = −kTln (EQEEL) (see Fig. 7c).51 Compared to the E18:BTA3-4F-based device with an EQEEL of 8.19 × 10−4 and a corresponding ΔE3 of 0.183 eV, the E18:BTA3 device possesses a higher EQEEL of 8.25 × 10−3 and thus exhibits a lower ΔE3 of 0.124 eV, which is one of the smallest values in OPV devices and symbolizes the great potential for applications in reducing energy loss of devices. The partial energy losses and total energy losses are summarized in Fig. S20 and Table S7 (ESI†), respectively.
Exciton dissociation, charge transport and charge recombination

Fig. 7d and Fig. S21 (ESI†) show the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the relevant films excited at 620 nm and 530 nm, respectively. Apparently, as shown in Fig. 7d, the PL emission peak of BTA3-4F from E18:BTA3-4F blend film is significantly quenched with a quenching rate of 90.3%, while the quenching rate of E18:BTA3 is only 27.5% owing to the smaller difference of PL emission peak between E18:BTA3 and neat BTA3. The same PL quenching phenomenon occurred in the PL of the excited donor (Fig. S21, ESI†), that is E18:BTA3-4F shows a higher donor PL quenching rate than E18:BTA3. The main reason for the lower PL quenching rates that occurred in E18:BTA3 may be attributed to its weak molecular stacking and undesirable film morphology, generating inefficient exciton dissociation. Furthermore, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) depicted in Fig. 7e allows for the analysis of the carrier kinetics at the nanosecond time scale. According to the biexponential fit of the TRPL curve, the average PL lifetime (τave) of the BTA3-4F neat film is 1.38 ns, which is longer than the BTA3 neat film with a τave of 1.27 ns, indicating that longer-lived photogenerated excitons exist in BTA3-4F, which can facilitate exciton diffusion to the D/A interface and reduce recombination loss. Compared to the τave of 905 ps for E18:BTA3, the shorter τave of 658 ps for E18:BTA3-4F suggests that faster exciton dissociation occurs in the E18:BTA3-4F blend.
We also performed femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy tests on the corresponding films, as shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†), where the ground state bleaching (GSB) signals of the neat and blend films in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm are almost located at the same position owing to the overlapping UV-vis absorption between donor and acceptor in this range, which covers up the signal peaks of the hole transfer. Similarly, the excited state absorption (ESA) signals of neat and blend films in the long wavelength range of 800–1300 nm were also observed at almost the same position. Hence, we applied a tri-exponential decay function to fit the decay lifetimes of the ESA based on the neat and blend films to roughly analyze the transition rate of the single exciton (S1) species. The corresponding decay constants obtained are illustrated in Table S8 (ESI†). The decay lifetime of the ESA feature at 1130 nm for E18:BTA3-4F is shorter at 4.18 ps compared to that for E18:BTA3 at 17.26 ps (Fig. 7f), indicating the faster transition from S1 to other excited species for efficient exciton dissociation. Conversely, the decay lifetime of the ESA feature at 1120 nm for the BTA3-4F neat film is longer than that for BTA3 (see Fig. S23, ESI†), favoring an increase in exciton diffusion length. The similar PL and TAS analysis results suggest that the longer exciton lifetimes, faster exciton dissociation and efficient charge transfer occur in the E18:BTA3-4F system may greatly contribute to its enhancement of JSC and FF.
The linear fit graphs of JSC and VOCversus light intensity dependent are plotted in Fig. 7g and h to analyze the effect of charge recombination behavior on photovoltaic device parameters. The JSCversus light intensity dependent plot depicted in Fig. 7g indicates that fluorine substitution insignificantly affects bimolecular recombination in BHJ films, which can be confirmed by the smaller differences in the α value of 0.942 for E18:BTA3 and 0.945 for E18:BTA3-4F. Importantly, the n value obtained via the equation VOC = nkT/qlnPlight52 exhibits significant differences between the BTA3-based and BTA3-4F-based systems (Fig. 7h). Compared to E18:BTA3 with an n value of 1.62, the device based on E18:BTA3-4F shows a smaller n value of 1.27, indicating its lower single-molecule recombination or trap-assisted recombination loss, where the trap recombination loss mainly comprises undissociated exciton recombination and dissociated free carrier recombination. Hence, the light intensity-dependent results indicate that in the BTA3-based system, most of the photogenerated excitons are recombined before reaching the D/A interface, inducing a bulk of trap recombination.
The electron-only and hole-only devices were fabricated to obtain carrier mobilities (Fig. S24, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 7i, the electron mobility (μe) values of the BTA3-based device are 5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of the BTA3-4F-based device with μe of 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This may be attributed to the stronger π–π stacking and strong crystallinity of BTA3. Conversely, after blending with the terpolymer E18, the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) values of the E18:BTA3-4F-based device is 3.2 × 10−5/2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of 2.0 × 10−5/0.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the E18:BTA3 device. Moreover, the ratio of μe/μh is 1.28 for E18:BTA3-4F and 2.5 for E18:BTA3. The higher and more balanced carrier mobility of the E18:BTA3-4F-based blend film device indicates that the fluorine substitution effectively modulates the intermolecular interaction and achieves a more regular molecular stacking, which is favorable for carrier transport and mobility enhancement. In addition, the carrier mobility of the whole system is at a low level of the order of 10−5; perhaps in the future, we can consider the introduction of high crystalline units into the material design to enhance the carrier mobility for performance improvement.
Conclusions
We elaborately designed a pair of donor and acceptor materials to realize efficient exciton dissociation at VOC up to 1.3 V. The terpolymer E18 comes from classic D18 by introducing a 20% proportion of the side chain with a chlorine atom and bulky alkyl chain, and the NFA BTA3-4F is derived from BTA3 by adding four fluorine atoms to the side chain of the middle D unit of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type molecule. The obtained BTA3-4F exhibit electrical and optical properties similar to those of BTA3, with slightly blue-shifted absorption spectra and down-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels but larger dipole moments and completely different intermolecular interactions and crystallinity. It is worth mentioning that when blended with the well-designed terpolymer E18, the E18:BTA3-4F-based film exhibits surprisingly high crystallinity and tightly parallel π–π stacking. The π–π stacking belonging to BTA3-4F is significantly enhanced in blend films, and a new diffraction peak located at qz = 0.46 Å−1 is similar to that of the neat film of BTA3, which appears in the OOP direction in the blend film based on E18:BTA3-4F, both of which indicate that the ordered molecular stacking and purer domains of BTA3-4F are reconstituted in the blend film by balancing intermolecular interactions between A/A and D/A. This contributes to the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the corresponding blend film of E18:BTA3-4F with the optimal vertical phase separation and the shorter intermolecular stacking distance. Excitingly, the E18:BTA3-4F-based device achieves the highest PCE of 10.03% with a VOC of 1.30 V mainly because of its efficient and fast exciton dissociation (average PL lifetime of 658 ps) induced by balanced A/A, D/D and D/A interactions. However, the E18:BTA3-based device achieves a PCE of 4.98% owing to larger trap-assistant recombination as well as inefficient and slow exciton dissociation (average PL lifetime of 905 ps). Our study demonstrates that at a limiting VOC above 1.3 V, the determined factor of OPV performance might be balanced A/A, D/D, and D/A intermolecular interactions, which can be achieved by synergistic and precise molecular engineering of donor and acceptor materials.

Broader context
Exploring the upper limit of open-circuit voltage (VOC) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is important, which not only provides insight into the mechanism of exciton dissociation but also expands the applications in indoor photovoltaics, ternary devices and tandem devices. However, the boost of VOC is usually at the expense of a significant loss of JSC and PCE. When VOC reaches 1.3 V or higher, their performance is always restricted to a low level below 6% because efficient exciton dissociation becomes a huge challenge in this case. Herein, we co-designed the donor and acceptor materials to accurately modulate the D/A, A/A and D/D intermolecular interactions and obtained a more regular molecular arrangement. The improved vertical phase separation of the bulk heterojunction contributes to a long exciton lifetime and fast exciton dissociation. The non-halogenated solvent THF-processed photovoltaic device of E18:BTA3-4F achieved a recorded efficiency of 10.04% with a VOC of 1.3 V. Our results emphasize that the precise modulation of intermolecular interactions is an effective strategy to achieve efficient exciton dissociation at a low energy level offset.
