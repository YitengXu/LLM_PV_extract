    , Accepted 23rd February 2018First published on 24th February 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells using titanium dioxide (TiO2) for electron extraction have achieved high efficiency, but tend to degrade under full spectral illumination due to ultraviolet (UV) photocatalysis. PCBM might be an alternative candidate to overcome this instability issue, however, its PSC efficiency is still low due to relatively poor electrical conductivity and contact interface barriers with the electrode. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of C60 and self-organized PFN to PCBM as a ternary electron transport layer (ETL) can effectively improve the device performance by enhancing the conductivity and buffering the interfacial contact simultaneously. As a result, the highest hysteresis-free power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% has been achieved. Furthermore, the device based on ternary PCBM:C60:PFN can retain 91.3% of its initial PCE over 1056 hours of continuous full spectral illumination after a “burn in” period and thus shows a more stable performance than TiO2 based PSCs. This low-temperature (≤100 °C) prepared ternary material may offer the possibility of roll-to-roll mass production on flexible substrates and achieve highly photo-stable PSCs under full spectral illumination without the requirement of an additional UV filter.
Introduction
The inorganic-organic hybrid perovskite solar cell (PSC) has achieved tremendous success in terms of its high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >22.1% in the past 7 years.1–5 Most highly efficient PSCs are based on a N–I–P structure in which a layer of high temperature processed meso-TiO2 is usually used as a N-type electron transport layer (ETL).5–8 To overcome high temperature processing, researchers also developed low-temperature (<180 °C) solution-processed ETLs for planar N–I–P PSCs and recently, planar PSCs have achieved a high efficiency of >20%.9–13
However, stability under long-term operation is still the biggest challenge for practical application. To date, most stability studies reported the effect of moisture under dark conditions, but the effect of full spectral illumination was identified relatively less .14–22 It is noted that the TiO2 based PSCs need to filter UV light out during the constant full spectrum illumination test because the photocatalysis reaction degrades the stability.9,23 This means that the PSC still needs to overcome the UV instability under natural sunlight.24,25 For typical N–I–P PSCs based on TiO2, several methods have been reported to improve the photo-stability by TiO2, such as insertion of interfacial layers,26–29 reduction of the UV-induced photocatalysis of TiO2,30,31 and introduction of a down-converting layer.32,33 Recently, some inorganic materials with inferior UV photocatalytic capability, such as LBSO and α-Fe2O3, have successfully replaced TiO2 to achieve highly photostable PSCs under full spectral illumination.24,34
As one of the most successful organic ETLs, low-temperature (<100 °C) processable PCBM has been used to obtain hysteresis free N–I–P perovskite solar cells,35–39 which were generally used in P–I–N architectural devices before.40,41 However, the efficiency of PCBM PSCs lagged behind due to their intrinsically low electrical conductivity and the large interfacial energy barrier with the electrode.38,42 Recently, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were reported to effectively improve the electrical properties of PCBM, thus enhancing the performance of N–I–P planar PSCs.39 To reduce the energy barrier between PCBM and the electrode, several interlayers such as PCBDAN, PEI and PEIE, have been applied to improve the performance of this type of PSC.35–38 In particular, we have developed the self-organized PCBDAN interlayer between PCBM and the electrode simultaneously by a one-step solution process, which not only largely simplifies the fabrication process, but also improves the interlayer quality with ease.35 Thus, further development of highly conductive ETLs free of the interface energy barrier is expected to improve the performance of this type of PSC. In addition to performance, the stability of the PCBM-based PSCs under full spectrum illumination for a long time (>1000 h) is also critical for practical application.24
Here, we adopt a ternary organic ETL of PCBM:C60:PFN to address the above-mentioned problems using a one-step solution process and obtain photostable PSCs with high performance. The (poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) PFN is used to decrease the energy barrier at the ETL/ITO interface through self-organization and a certain amount of C60 additive is incorporated to effectively improve the conductivity of the ETL. The ternary ETL can not only improve the perovskite film quality but also effectively enhances the electron extraction and transport efficiency. As a result, the highest hysteresis-free power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% has been achieved. Compared with PSCs based on TiO2, the PCBM:C60:PFN PSC shows excellent stability under full sunlight illumination (including UV radiation) for more than 1056 h after a burn-in period.
Results and discussion
A schematic diagram of ternary ETL based PSCs is presented in Fig. 1a, with an ITO/PCBM:C60:PFN/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure. The triple-component mixed PCBM:C60:PFN layer was deposited by one-step spin-coating. Due to vertical phase separation between PFN and fullerene, an ITO/PFN/PCBM:C60 structure was formed during the spin-coating. Fig. 1a, right also shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, together with the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings for the PCBM:C60:PFN layer on ITO. N exists in PFN but not in PCBM:C60 and ITO. Thus, we can confirm that the PFN interlayer is formed between the PCBM:C60 layer and ITO judging from the distribution of N between C and In.

First we show some advantages of the self-organized ternary PCBM:C60:PFN ETL. Fig. 1b shows a schematic diagram of the vertical phase separation in the ternary PCBM:C60:PFN blend, in which PFN has a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic ionic functional groups. To minimize the total system energy and maintain a thermodynamic equilibrium, the PFN molecules anchor to the hydrophilic ITO surface through hydrophilic ionic functional groups, and thus improve the film formation for the ternary ETL. Fig. 1c illustrates the energy band diagram for PCBM:C60:PFN based PSCs. The self-organized PFN is expected to reduce the work function (WF) of ITO by creating ionic dipoles at the ITO/PCBM:C60 interface and facilitate electron transfer from the PCBM:C60 to ITO. Fig. 1d shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the optimized PSC with a PCBM:C60:PFN ETL, CH3NH3PbI3, and spiro-OMeTAD HTL with thicknesses of ∼40, 520, and 230 nm, respectively. We can see each layer has uniform thickness and film morphology, owing to the well-designed starting ternary ETLs. Such thin and uniform film quality is expected to be beneficial to obtaining hysteresis-free and high performance devices.
To confirm our assumption, we first examined whether the self-organized PFN could effectively change the WF of the ITO cathode using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The surface potentials of ITO coated by different materials are shown in Fig. 2a–f. The result shows that the surface potential of ITO could be largely reduced after the modification of self-organized PFN (Fig. 2a and d). The ITO WF can be obtained by the equation ϕITO = ϕt − eVSP, where ϕt is the work function (WF) of the conductive tip and VSP is the measured surface potential. Histograms of ϕITO coated with different materials were plotted to find the mean WF for all of the samples. The result shows that ϕITO is reduced from 4.70 eV to 4.16 eV after PFN modification, due to the presence of a negative interfacial dipole between ITO and PFN. It is found that the WFs of the ITO/PCBM:PFN (4.06 eV) and ITO/PCBM:C60:PFN (4.03 eV) samples exhibit smaller values compared to that of the ITO/PFN (4.16 eV) sample, illustrating the effective self-organization of PFN. To double-check, the WFs of these samples were also measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). They were found to be consistent with each other (Fig. S1†). Based on these results, we achieved ohmic contact between PCBM:C60 and ITO via PFN, which is beneficial for the improvement in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the PSC device. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show that all the ITO/ETLs had very little surface roughness with the root mean square of <1.5 nm (Fig. S2†), indicating that those ETLs were uniform and pin-hole free. This high-quality film will be good for perovskite film formation in the following deposition.

The improved conductivity for ternary ETLs is also demonstrated by an electron only device. The current–voltage characteristics were used to study the conductivity of ETLs and electron injection efficiency at the ITO/ETL interfaces. The structure of electron-only devices was ITO/ETLs/Ag, and these devices were biased from −2 V to 2 V. As shown in Fig. 2h, it is clear that the conductivity of the PCBM film has been improved significantly after the addition of C60. The highest conductivity of the ETLs was achieved by optimizing the C60 concentration at 25% (weight percentage), as shown in Fig. S3.† When the C60 content increases above 25%, the electron-only devices showed breakdown, which might be due to the inhomogeneity of the films (Fig. S4†). In addition, it is found that the electron current density significantly increased (up to 2 times) for the PFN based devices when injected from the ITO/PCBM:C60 (ITO/PCBM) electrode but remained the same when injected from the Ag/PCBM:C60 (Ag/PCBM) electrode. This improvement confirms that the increase in electron current density is due to the enhanced injection efficiency of the ITO electrode. It is in agreement with a reduced injection barrier at the ITO/PCBM:C60 interface thanks to the modification by self-organized PFN.
Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were used to study the charge transfer kinetics between the perovskite and ETLs. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL intensity of the perovskite film on PCBM decreases in contrast to glass due to electron transfer to the ETL. It is found that addition of both C60 and PFN to PCBM could result in a much lower PL intensity of the perovskite. The strongest PL quenching was observed for the sample based on the PCBM:C60:PFN layer, demonstrating the highest charge transfer efficiency among the ETLs. This comparison is more clearly illustrated by the time-resolved PL spectra, as shown in Fig. 3b. The PL decay time and amplitudes are modeled using a bi-exponential eqn (1):43 f(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + B(1)where Ai is the decay amplitude, τ1 is the fast decay lifetime, τ2 is the slow decay life time and B is a constant for the base-line offset. Table S1† lists all above mentioned parameters obtained from the analysis. For the glass/perovskite, τ2 was 164.4 ns, illustrating a good crystalline quality for the perovskite resulting in long exciton lifetime. The τ1 of perovskite on PCBM, PCBM:C60, PCBM:PFN and PCBM:C60:PFN layers was 10.2, 5.9, 6.7 and 5.2 ns, respectively. The fast component is related to the charge transfer to different ETLs. The charge transfer rate (kct) can be obtained using the difference in reciprocal global lifetime for the perovskite with and without an ETL in eqn (2) and listed in Table S1.†44,45 kct = 1/τ(ETL-perovskite) − 1/τ0(glass-perovskite)(2)where τ(ETL-perovskite) is the global lifetime for different ETLs and τ0(glass-perovskite) is the global lifetime for the perovskite on glass substrate. We can see the ternary PCBM:C60:PFN ETL has a much larger charge transfer rate (0.0814 ns−1) than binary PCBM:C60 (0.0719 ns−1), PCBM:PFN (0.0547 ns−1), and single component PCBM (0.0395 ns−1). The result shows that the addition of C60 into PCBM can improve the electron transfer efficiency due to the better conductivity of C60. The self-organized PFN can also facilitate electron transfer from the ETL to ITO due to the formation of a dipole interface. The enhanced charge transfer rate at the interface after adding C60 and PFN is expected to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the devices in the following.

Fig. 4a shows the performance enhancement by the ternary ETL. The effect of adding C60 and PFN to ETLs on the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs were measured under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight. Both the addition of C60 and PFN to PCBM reduced the RS and improved the FF, and to a certain extent JSC and VOC. The device based on the bare PCBM ETL shows a large RS which can be obtained from the shape of the J–V curves in the forward bias range from 0.6 to 1.0 V (Fig. 4a, black line). The large RS is due to the low conductivity of PCBM and the Schottky barrier type contact between PCBM and Ag, which strongly restricts efficient electron collection. On one hand, the addition of C60 to PCBM reduces the electron transfer resistance and facilitates electron transport, decreasing the RS and thus improving the FF. The improvement of conductivity in ETLs is also beneficial in increasing the JSC of the devices (Fig. 4a, blue line). On the other hand, the addition of PFN could decrease the barrier height at the ITO/PCBM interface and thus strongly improve the electron extraction from PCBM to ITO. Thus, it also effectively increases the FF and the photocurrent, especially in the 0.6 to 1.1 V forward bias regions (Fig. 4a, green line). The enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) can be interpreted as a consequence of the reduced potential loss at the Ag/PCBM interface due to the suitable energy level alignment. As a result, the device with simultaneous addition of C60 and PFN can achieve the best performance (Fig. 4a, red line). To make a comparison, we have also fabricated a device based on a PFN/PCBM:C60 bilayer through two-step spin-coating, which shows no obvious improvement over the device using a bare PCBM:C60 layer. This is associated with the re-dissolution of the PFN layer by the chlorobenzene solution during the second-step of the spin-coating process (Fig. S5†).

Fig. 4b presents the statistical PCE distribution of devices with different ETLs. The other photovoltaic metrics of these PSCs are shown in Fig. S6.† The average PCE of the devices with PCBM, PCBM:C60, PCBM:PFN and PCBM:C60:PFN ETLs are 13.3%, 15.4%, 16.4% and 17.5%, respectively. The device based on PCBM:C60:PFN can achieve the best performance with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.10 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.78 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.3%, leading to a PCE of 19.3%. In addition, all the devices with fullerene-based ETLs are almost hysteresis free due to defect suppression for the perovskite (Fig. 4c and Table S2†). The steady-state PCE of the champion device was measured as a function of time when the cell was biased at the maximum power point (Vmp). It shows that the steady-state PCE is 18.9% and has a rapid response to the light, confirming the hysteresis-free effect in our device (Fig. S7†). Fig. 4d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device with PCBM:C60:PFN. The integrated photocurrent density from the EQE is 21.1 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the corresponding photocurrent in J–V measurements in Fig. 4c. In addition, the ternary organic ETL can also be applied in the fabrication of flexible solar cells. The best efficiency of a PSC with a PCBM:C60:PFN ETL on the PET substrate was 14.8%, which is much higher than that based on bare PCBM (11.2%, Fig. S8†).
One of the most important requirements for a solar cell is photostability under full spectrum illumination. We performed long-term stability measurements on the PSCs with TiO2 and ternary PCBM:C60:PFN ETLs. The unpackaged devices were tested under constant light illumination (AM1.5 G, full spectrum) in a glove-box without any UV filter. The performance of the PSCs with TiO2 ETLs is shown in Fig. S9†and is similar to our previous reports.35 The perovskite film grown directly on the PCBM:C60:PFN surface shows a slightly larger grain size and lower trap density compared to that grown on the TiO2, which might be beneficial in improving the device performance and stability (Fig. S10 and S11†). Fig. 4a shows the normalized PCEs as a function of testing time under constant AM1.5 G illumination. The PCE of the TiO2 based PSC degrades to almost zero within 408 h, which is similar to the previous report with a similar device structure and testing conditions.24 In contrast, the PCE of the PCBM:C60:PFN based PSC showed a ≈31% drop after 144 h and then decreased to 63% of its original highest value slowly after another 1056 h, which is much more stable than that with a TiO2 ETL. A significant initial loss of performance under sunlight exposure before stabilizing might be related to the “burn in” degradation which could have several possible origins, including photo-induced fullerene dimerization and photo-generation of electronic trap states etc.46,47 A similar burn-in degradation phase has been observed in organic solar cells.46,48,49 It has been demonstrated that the carrier mobility of PCBM will be deceased after illumination, thus, it was suggested that this reason could constitute a possible device degradation mechanism.48 It is noted that device stability is typically measured in the linear decay period once the burn-in has ended and therefore we define the point at the beginning of the linear decay period as an initial PCE.49 As a result, the PCBM:C60:PFN based PSC can maintain 91.3% of its efficiency for more than 1056 h under full spectrum illumination.
To scrutinize the mechanisms of degradation for the PSCs based on TiO2, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of these devices with different ETLs were taken before and after light illumination. As shown in Fig. S12,† the new diffraction peak at 12.6° corresponding to PbI2 can be observed in the XRD pattern for the device based on TiO2. This phenomenon is associated with the decomposition of the perovskite induced by TiO2, which has photocatalytic activity. Schematic diagrams illustrating the degradation mechanism of TiO2-based devices are shown in Fig. S13.† The PbI2 layer at the perovskite/metallic oxide interface hinders electron transport from the perovskite active layer and results in serious recombination. Therefore, the VOC, JSC and FF of the device based on TiO2 obviously decrease (Fig. 5b–d). In comparison, the device based on the triple-component ETL of PCBM:C60:PFN shows good stability (after a “burn in” period), because there is no obvious decomposition of perovskite even after 1200 hours of full spectrum illumination. These results demonstrate that the stability of PSCs is mainly affected by the TiO2 ETL when exposed to full spectrum illumination. To further confirm that, we prepared an ETL-free device with a structure of ITO/Perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and tested its photostability under the same illumination conditions as before. The result shows that the ETL-free device has much better stability than that with a TiO2 ETL (Fig. S14† and 5).

Conclusions
In summary, a one-step solution processed ternary ETL consisting of a PCBM:C60:PFN blend has been successfully developed, achieving efficient and photostable N–I–P PSCs. It is demonstrated that the conductivity improvement of ETLs and the interface barrier reduction are responsible for the high performance of the PSCs. As a result, the highest hysteresis-free power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% has been achieved. Furthermore, the PCBM:C60:PFN ternary ETL based PSC shows much higher photostability than a TiO2 based PSC under full spectrum illumination. This deliberate ternary material facilitates the formation of high-performance perovskite solar cells and the development of multicomponent ETL materials, which may further achieve highly photostable PSCs under full spectral illumination without the requirement of an additional UV filter.
