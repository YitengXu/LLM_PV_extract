    , Accepted 3rd March 2009First published on 27th March 2009AbstractWe report the preparation of conformational coatings of the titania electrode by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and its influence on the efficiency of dye sensitised solar cells. We have observed that the TFA creates a hydrophobic barrier on the titania surface preventing direct contact with the electrolyte. Interestingly, when N719 is used as sensitiser, the presence of TFA accelerates the recombination reactions between photo-injected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidised electrolyte.
Introduction
The increasing efficiency and stability of dye sensitised solar cells (DSSC) has always been a major task for researchers in the field of molecular photovoltaics. Indeed, recent advances in the design and synthesis of new dyes have made it possible to overcome the 10% “barrier” for light-to-energy conversion when using TiO2 mesoporous films sensitised with ruthenium polypyridyl complexes.1–3 In fact, Grätzel et al. have shown that 11.3% devices can be made when using heteroleptic ruthenium complexes bearing thiophene moieties conjugated with the bipyridine ligand: the so-called C101dye (chemical name: NaRu (4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2), Scheme 1.4 Moreover, a growing number of research groups are challenging the ruthenium complexes using organic dyes, which show excellent light harvesting properties. Device efficiencies higher than 7% have been already reported.4–10 Yet, basic and fundamental knowledge of the parameters that are influencing the critical back electron transfer reactions that limit the device performance is essential. For example, it has been shown recently that some dyes can accelerate the recombination reaction between the photo-injected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidised electrolyte, reducing the device efficiency drastically.11 Furthermore, our group have also investigated such interesting effect in ruthenium complexes and found that certain chemical functional groups like the amino group can also induce faster recombination dynamics.12
 Scheme 1  Molecular structure of the C101 (left) and N719 (right) dyes. 
In the last five years, several approaches were described to reduce the interfacial e−-TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination reaction including the use of conformally coated nanocrystalline TiO2 particles with metal oxide insulators13–15 or dyes with long alkyl chains to prevent the oxidised species in the electrolyte from coming close to the semiconductor nanoparticle surface.16 In the light of such experimental evidence, we decided to study the effect that a “hydrophobic” inorganic layer, conformally deposited on the TiO2nanoparticles, will have over the interfacial recombination reactions at the device. In this paper we describe the synthesis and the structural and photophysical characterization of a “hydrophobic barrier” as well as its effects on the device performance.
Experimental

Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%), ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Riedel-de Häen. Glacial acetic acid (99–100%) and nitric acid (65%) were purchased from J.T. Baker. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate and lithium perchlorate of electrochemical grade were purchased from Fluka. N719 was purchased at Solaronix SA (commercial name ruthenium 535-bisTBA, chemical name cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) bis-(tetrabutylammonium), Scheme 1). MilliQ purified water was used throughout the study. The reactants were used as received.
TiO2nanoparticle synthesis and paste preparation
TiO2 anatase nanoparticles were prepared as previously reported.17Titanium isopropoxide (40 mL, 0.13 mol) was added to glacial acetic acid (9.12 g) under stirring. The resulting solution was cooled in an ice-bath and 240 mL of 0.1M HNO3 were added under vigorous stirring. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 8 h. Then it was allowed to cool to room temperature and then filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. The filtrate was diluted to 5% weight of TiO2 by the addition of water. Then, the solution was placed into a high-pressure autoclave at 220 °C for 12h. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was decanted and the solid residue was rinsed four times with ethanol. The aggregates were broken using an ultrasonic horn and the solvent was removed. The nanoparticles were dispersed in a solution of terpineol containing 5% of ethyl cellulose and the paste was homogenised by ball milling.
To prepare the so-called aqueous paste, the nanoparticles obtained after the autoclave were redispersed by an ultrasonic horn, and concentrated until 12.5% in weight of TiO2, then 2% in weight of hydroxypropyl cellulose was added and the paste was homogenised by ball milling.
Film preparation and post-functionalization
Nanocrystalline TiO2 was deposited onto a FTO conducting glass substrate (Hafordt glass© TEC 15 Ohms/cm2 resistance) by the well known doctor blade technique. The resulting thickness was 4µm and the device active area was 1 cm2. The resulting electrodes were gradually heated under airflow at 325 °C for 5 min., 375 °C for 5 min., 450 °C for 15 min. and 500 °C for 15 min.
For functionalization, the as-prepared TiO2 films were soaked for 12h in an aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 0.25 M or 0.7 M, washed with water, dried, and heated at 220 °C for 1h.
Device preparation
The platinised counter electrode was made by applying a drop of 5 × 10−3 M of H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol dry solution and spreading it onto the conducting glass substrate (FTO). The coated glass was heated under airflow at 390 °C for 15 min.
The films prepared from the organic paste were immersed in a solution of N719 (1 × 10−3 M) in ACN:tBuOH 1:1 at room temperature until desired absorbance values were reached. The sensitised electrodes were assembled by sandwiching the working and the counter electrode using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn©) frame that melts at 100 °C. The liquid electrolyte was elaborated using 0.6 M of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), 0.03 M of iodine (I2), and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15).
The cells were filled with the electrolyte through a hole previously made in the back of a platinized counter electrode. Then, the hole was sealed with a thermoplastic polymer and a cover slide glass. Finally, a drop of silver conductive paint was spread at the electrode contacts to increase the conductivity.
Materials characterization
The surface analysis was carried out with an Autosorb 1-MP Quantachrome apparatus and the X-ray power diffraction measurements were acquired with a Bruker Siemens Smart CCD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). The crystallite size was calculated by the X-ray line-width analysis using the Scherrer formula. The size particle was also measured with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) JEOL 1011. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL JSM-6400 was used to verify the uniformity and homogeneity of prepared films. The contact angle was monitored through the measurement of the water contact angle on the film surface by employing a contact-angle meter. The thermal decomposition of TFA adsorbed on the surface was monitored using a DTA/TGA instrument Mettler TOLEDO TGA/SDTA851e.
Spectroscopic characterization
The measurements were done using aqueous titania paste, unless in complete devices where the “organic” paste was used. The UV-Visible spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. When the absorption spectrum was registered for dye sensitised films we used the same film without dye to measure the instrument blank and ensure that the light scatter effects have been minimised. Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments were carried out with a Lifespec-red picosecond fluorescence lifetime spectrophotometer from Edinburgh Instruments© equipped with lasers as excitation sources. The instrument response was always shorter than 300 ps measured at the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The transient absorbance experiments were recorded using a home-built system as reported before.18 The films were sensitised with the same dye load (absorbance of 0.6 a.u.) and measured with a probe wavelength of 760 nm and an excitation source of 535 nm.

Chronoamperometry

The studies on the films prepared from the aqueous paste were conducted as reported previously in a three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell and an HCH Instruments Electrochemical Potentiostat-Galvanostat.19 The ACN-based redox-inactive electrolyte contained 0.1M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) and 0.1M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4). The films of 0.5 cm2 that were held by platinum clips acted as working electrodes. The counter electrode was fine platinum mesh and the reference was 0.01M Ag/AgNO3. Argon was bubbled throughout the electrolyte between readings to maintain an anaerobic atmosphere and to ensure proper mixture of the electrolyte during the experiment. To reach equilibrium in the cell, the applied voltage was kept constant for 10 min prior to measurement. A bias step of −25 mV was then applied, and the current transient was recorded and integrated. This procedure was repeated at 100 mV intervals for all the samples.
Device characterization
The photoelectrochemical measurement were carried out with an ORIEL 150 W xenon light source equipped with the correct set of filters to achieve the solar spectrum AM 1.5 G. The light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW/cm2, the equivalent of 1 sun, using a calibrated Si photodiode. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley model 2600 digital source meter. The current to voltage (I–V curve) was measured automatically with home-built Labview© software. The charge extraction and photovoltage decay was carried out with a system set-up as previously reported by O'Regan et al.20 using a Tektronix TDS2022 oscilloscope and TTi TGP110 pulse generator. For the measurement of transient photovoltage, the cell is connected to an oscilloscope, and then, pulses of 20 μs are applied with red LEDs and the transient decay recorded. Each decay is measured under several light biases, applied with a set of white LEDs, and taking care of having each time an increase of 6 mV due to the pulse.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization of the films
The films were prepared to be as structurally similar as possible. Thus, in order to ensure that this is the case we did perform a wide range of measurements. (i) X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the films after calcination, with and without TFA, allowed us to verify that all the samples are made of anatase nanoparticles of 15 ± 1 nm, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Therefore, the addition of TFA on the surface did not affect the bulk nanocrystalline composition. (ii) The mesoporous nature of the samples was studied by nitrogen adsorption and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) calculations. All the samples displayed a narrow pore size distribution while the isotherm curves show a sharp decline in the desorption branch indicative of mesoporosity. The addition of TFA onto the nanoparticles surface did not change the porous properties of the films, therefore pore size, porous volume and the surface area remain unaltered after functionalization. The calculated values for both films were 12 nm, 0.36 cm3/g and 100 m2/g, respectively. (iii) Contact angle measurement carried out with a small drop of water deposited on top of a film permitted the hydrophilic nature of the sample surface to be studied. Pure anatase films are known to show water affinity due to the hydroxyl groups bound to the Ti(IV) atoms on the surface, giving rise to small angles (15° in our case). When coating the nanoparticles with TFA, this angle increases to 50°, which is due to the more hydrophobic trifluoroacetate moieties adsorbed on the surface. Finally, (iv) the thermal decomposition behaviour of TFA adsorbed on TiO2 was also checked by thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The comparative results of TGA are shown in Fig. 1. The TGA curves can be divided into three stages for TiO2 or four stages for TFA modified TiO2 samples. The first step comprises from room temperature to 100 °C and corresponds to a mass loss of 0.76% for TiO2 film and 1.17% for TFA-TiO2. The second stage, centred at 190 °C, indicates a mass loss of 0.35% for both samples while the last one, centred at 430 °C, represents 0.1%. Regarding the peak on the TFA-TiO2 sample at 292 °C, the mass loss is of 0.9%. Further information can be obtained from the DTA curves in which there is a broad endothermic peak below 100 °C that is assigned to desorption of the physically adsorbed water and TFA, so from the TGA results we can infer that 0.4% of this weight loss corresponds to the physisorbed TFA. Between 150 and 210 °C there is a second endothermic peak due to the evaporation of impurities, the nature of which remains unclear but can be attributed to air exposure, and finally, there is a third endothermic peak centred at 430 °C that can be assigned to further crystallization of anatase phase. The main difference between the two samples is an exothermic signal found at 292 °C observed only on the TFA-modified powders. This peak is assigned to the loss of chemisorbed TFA, as has been observed previously.21 Therefore, and in order to favour the formation of chemical bonds between TFA and the TiO2 surface, and avoid the calcination of the fluorinated group, the samples were thermally treated at 220 °C after post-functionalization.

The stability of the TFA bonding to TiO2 films is a main concern in this study. From the TGA-DTA results shown above, we can deduce that the TFA is chemically bonded to the TiO2 surface. In addition, we have checked the presence of TFA by FTIR (see ESI‡). Thus, we believe that the changes in the behaviour of the samples are attributable exclusively to the TFA coating.
Electron-density studies on thin films
Chronoamperometric measurements were carried out in order to measure the electron occupancy in the nanocrystalline metal oxide films.22 The electron densities derived from the potential step chronoamperometry of the TiO2 and TFA-TiO2 modified films are presented in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Plot of the electron density of TiO2 (■) and 0.25 M TFA-modified TiO2 films (○) over the bias shown. The potential was measured using Ag/AgNO3 as reference electrode. 
As can be observed, at negative bias (V < −0.3V vs. Ag/AgNO3) the TiO2–TFA film data are slightly shifted to more positive potentials compared to TiO2. We assign this displacement to the shift of the Fermi level due to the influence of TFA, as will be further demonstrated later in the manuscript when complete devices are studied using photo-induced charge extraction methods.
Device characterization
The performance of the transparent 4µm thick DSSCs is shown in Fig. 3 and the most important parameters are listed in Table 1. From the I–V curves we can already see that the TFA treated cells display lower Voc and lower photocurrent than the non-treated devices. Moreover, the treatment with higher TFA concentrations results in worse efficiencies. Although the shift of the Fermi level, due to the presence of trifluoroacetate on the surface, may explain the lower Voc, an increase in the photocurrent was expected as occurs when an acid treatment is performed onto the TiO2 film. However, this is not the case and more complex interfacial reactions are taking place, which affect the voltage and the cell photocurrent. Hence, it was necessary to fully characterize the cell properties in order to understand the reasons for these results.

Charge injection and charge recombination measurements
We have analysed the charge transfer processes that occur in the DSSC by different techniques. Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is a method that follows the decay lifetime of the excited-state emission of dye molecules anchored to films and can be used to estimate the electron injection yield from the photoexcited dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor. Therefore, to have comparable results the treated and non-treated metal oxides must be sensitized with the same N719dye load. The emission of the non-treated N719/TiO2 sensitized film was recorded during a fixed acquisition time (1320 seconds). We used this measurement as our blank or control experiment. After, the luminescence of the N719/TiO2-TFA treated films was recorded during 1320 seconds, resulting in comparable kinetics. The emission lifetime for both set of samples are listed in Table 2. As can be seen, the increasing of TFA on the TiO2 surface directly affects the emission excited state lifetime of N719 which becomes much faster and, thus, it may induce a kinetic competition with the primary process of photo-induced electron injection.

The dye cation/TiO2 recombination dynamics were analysed using laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS). Fig. 4 illustrates electron recombination dynamics in the absence (Fig. 4A) and presence (Fig. 4B) of red/ox active I−/I3− electrolyte. The back electron transfer half-times (t1/2) measured at full width at half maximum (FWHM) are summarised in Table 3. It is clear that in this case, the charge transfer process is not affected by the presence of TFA on the surface of the nanoparticles. Moreover, the three curves display the same amplitude, thus, within the resolution time of our system, we can ensure that the despite the acceleration of the emission decay dynamics measured by TCSPC, the electron injection yield is not drastically affected.

 Fig. 4  Recombination dynamics for 4 µm thick dye-sensitised N719/TiO2 and N719/TiO2-TFA films (A) and in complete devices (B). The excitation wavelength was 535 nm and the probe wavelength 760 nm. The solid lines in A correspond to the stretched exponential fit. 
As has been reported before for L-TAS measurements on N719 samples, in the presence of electrolyte the dynamics are biphasic. The fast phase (<100 µs) is assigned to the recombination reaction between photoinjected electrons and the oxidised dye (it is quicker due to the fact that the dye ground state regeneration occurs much faster). The slow phase (100 μs–0.1 s) is assigned primarily to the absorption of either electrons at the TiO2 or I2−˙ radical species formed during the regeneration.23 Once again, we can observe that the three devices give similar results. Taking into account that the intensity of the signal is proportional to the amount of dye cations present in the film, and that the same dye load and electrolyte was used for all the DSSC, we can conclude that the modification with TFA does not affect significantly the rate of the regeneration process and the e−-TiO2/dye+ recombination kinetics.
So far we can conclude that neither the electron injection nor the interfacial charge transfer process involving the N719dye are strongly affected by the TFA coating. Hence, the lower device performance must be related to the interfacial charge recombination process between the photo-injected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidised electrolyte (electrolyte+/TiO2). Several authors have already shown that this process can be primary studied by transient photovoltage measurements, also called Voc decays.24,25 To ensure the correct measurement of the electrolyte+/TiO2 recombination kinetics we must determine first the charge density on the devices. Fig. 5 shows the curves obtained for the different samples. As can be seen, the N719/TiO2-TFA devices are slightly displaced towards more positive potentials in good agreement with the chronoamperometric measurements reported above.

On the other hand, we have determined that at 550 mV the three devices posses the same charge density so, consequently, we performed the transient photovoltage measurements at this light bias. Fig. 6 illustrates the Voc decay for the cells with and without TFA treatment. It is clear that the non-treated sample displays slower recombination dynamics.

The results from the Voc decays strongly indicate that the recombination between the photoinjected electrons and the oxidised electrolyte is enhanced with the presence of TFA on the surface of TiO2nanoparticles. Therefore the presence of TFA creates a path that avoids the charges from reaching the electrodes and being collected, probably by the formation of a complex with the electrolyte.
In order to shed some light on this hypothesis we prepared devices without N719dye and measured the cell performance under dark conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 7. We can observe that the TFA coating creates an effective barrier between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte as we expected in our initial hypothesis. In principle this observation seems in contradiction with the results obtained for the electrolyte+/TiO2 recombination reaction in complete functional cells sensitised with N719.

Nevertheless, we must take into account the role that the dye can also play in the presence of the electrolyte when the cell is under working conditions (illumination). In fact, comparing both experiments the only difference is the presence of the N719dye. We have shown that the N719 in the presence of the TFA coating enhances the recombination between the photoinjected electrons and the oxidised electrolyte decreasing the cell efficiency. This effect must be mediated by the formation of a gradient of I3− near to the surface due to the presence of the electronegative trifluoroacetate groups, which interact with the cationic nature of the dye excited state. Although our group and others have not been able to achieve direct evidence of the complex formation when using N719 as sensitiser, it is worthy to notice that previous studies using photo-induced transient spectroscopy and also high level theoretical calculations either show or predict the formation of a complex between the dye and the red/ox species present at the DSC electrolyte.11,26–28
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a conformally coated layer onto mesoporous metal oxides using trifluoroacetic acid as a coating agent. Moreover, the contact angle measurements demonstrated the hydrophobicity of this coating.
After analysing the results on the different interfacial charge transfer reactions occurring at the N719 sensitised films, we have demonstrated that the TFA coating does not affect the electron injection or the e-TiO2/dye+ electron recombination reaction. However, in complete functional devices and under illumination the combination of N719 and the TFA, as a coating, increases the e−-TiO2/electrolyte+ charge recombination reaction. Despite the good blocking properties of the TFA coating shown in non-sensitised DSSCs, this enhancement of the reaction could be motivated by the formation of a complex between the electrolyte and the coadsorbed molecules (both the dye and TFA), which will favour the leakage of electrons. Reducing this unfavourable effect, using for example chemical groups at the sensitiser to avoid the interaction or formation of the complex, will improve the cell Voc and, therefore, the overall device efficiency.
