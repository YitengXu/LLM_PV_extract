    , Accepted 15th December 2017First published on 21st December 2017AbstractA selective and efficient method to afford a monobrominated benzothioxanthene (Br-BTXI) derivative is reported. Br-BTXI was extensively employed in common palladium catalyzed coupling reactions. Finally, as a proof of concept, a BTXI based molecular donor was synthesized and evaluated in bulk heterojunction solar cells.
Since the advent of organic electronics, various classes of π-conjugated molecular and macromolecular semiconductors have been reported.1–6 Among them, imide-containing rylenes have attracted considerable research attention due to their redox, electron-withdrawing, and charge-carrier transport properties, as well as their excellent chemical, thermal, and photochemical stabilities.7–9 Naphthalene diimide (NDI)10–13 and perylene diimide (PDI)14–18 can be unequivocally recognized as the most studied imide based building blocks for the preparation of high-performance electron transporting optoelectronic materials (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure of NDI, PDI and BTXI. 
Within these wide-ranging studies, considerable effort has been undertaken to functionalize both the bay positions and the nitrogen atoms constituting the imide groups (N-positions) to bring solubility, tune the molecular (opto)electronic characteristics, and build extended π-conjugated architectures.19–24 Though it possesses interesting fluorescent properties, the N-(alkyl)benzothioxanthene-3,4-dicarboximide (BTXI), a sulfur containing rylene-imide dye (Fig. 1), has not yet triggered such interest. Exclusively used in bioimaging, BTXI has been solely functionalized on the N-position for post-grafting purposes and/or to increase solubility.25–28 To extend the functionality of BTXI, we report the bromination of the BTXI rylene core. Owing to this simple but highly efficient and selective method, various synthetic metal-catalyzed reactions, namely the Sonogashira, Suzuki–Miyaura, Stille and direct (hetero)arylation coupling reactions were subsequently and successfully applied as a key step towards the preparation of new π-conjugated semiconductors for organic electronics applications.
As depicted in Scheme 1, the commercially available benzothioxanthene dicarboxylic anhydride (BTXA) was first treated with 3-aminopentane in molten imidazole before being exposed to the conventional N-bromosuccinimide (NBS).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to the isolated brominated BTXI dye. 
Regardless of the concentration, nature of the solvent, and reaction time, no trace of a brominated compound was detected and only the starting imide-based derivative BTXI was systematically recovered after purification. However, when exposed to a dilute solution of bromine (gas), the formation of a single product could be efficiently monitored by simple thin layer chromatography. Interestingly, increasing the concentration of Br2 (from one to five equivalents) speeds-up the conversion without generating other species. Once analyzed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR spectroscopy), the isolated compound, afforded in very good yield, appeared to be monobrominated (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Comparison and evolution of the 1H NMR spectra from the BTXI (top) to the Br-BTXI compound (bottom). 
Complementary computational and experimental techniques were employed to determine the position of the bromine atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the OT-ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) level of theory,29–32 where the range-separation parameter was optimally tuned (OT) via a gap fitting procedure33–35 for each molecular species considered (see Table S1, ESI†). We note that the alkyl group was truncated to a methyl group to reduce the computational cost. Eight monobrominated derivatives were identified, and the geometries were optimized and confirmed to be minima on the potential energy surface through normal mode analyses (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Relative energy of monobrominated (left) and dibrominated (right) Br-BTXI derivatives calculated at the OT-ωB97X-D/6-31g(d,p) level of theory. 
The DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy Br-BTXI has the bromine atom located on the rylene core at the β-position with regards to the sulphur atom (position 7). The free energy (ΔG) for the reaction is −44.20 kcal mol−1 (see Table S2, ESI†). Further DFT calculations were carried out to understand why additional bromine in the reaction mixture did not lead to further BTXI bromination. Starting with the low-energy monobrominated BTXI, a second bromine atom was added at the remaining carbon atoms. Inspection of the Br-BTXI HOMO shows that there is considerable electron density at most of the remaining free carbon atoms (see Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting that bromination could occur at any of these locations. The thermodynamically favored position for the formation of a dibrominated BTXI is at the 5 position; notably, this position is the second most favorable when considering monobromination (Fig. 3). The free energy for reaction to form (stepwise) 5,7-dibrominated BTXI is −32.17 kcal mol−1 (Table S3, ESI†). Given the favorable thermodynamic driving force for the addition of a second bromine, it is hypothesized that it is a kinetic barrier that is responsible for the lack of formation of the dibrominated system.
In parallel, single crystals, obtained from vapor diffusion of hexanes into a chloroform solution of the monobrominated Br-BTXI derivative were isolated and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The molecular X-ray structure confirmed the DFT results that bromination occurs at the β position (Fig. 4).

Subsequently, to assess its reactivity, the structurally solved Br-BTXI was then engaged in several pallado-catalyzed reactions. As depicted in Scheme 2, the major cross-coupling reactions, namely the Stille, Suzuki–Miyaura, Sonogashira and direct (hetero)arylation were successfully applied demonstrating the versatility of the Br-BTXI to afford simple and original molecular structures in high yields.

As a proof of concept for BTXI-based molecular materials, the indacenodithiophene (IDT) derivative 4 was selected for its solubility in common organic solvents, optical and electrochemical properties to be embedded into an organic solar cell. The latter indeed exhibits in solution a maximum absorption wavelength centered at 409 nm associated to a molar extinction coefficient of ca. 60000 L mol−1 cm−1 (Fig. 5a).

Once spun-cast onto glass-sheets, the absorption profile shifts towards the lower energies with an absorption onset measured at ca. 570 nm, corresponding to an optical energy gap (Eoptg) of 2.17 eV (Table 1).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane using Bu4NPF6 as supporting electrolyte (Fig. 5b) reveals that compound 4 exhibits two one-electron reversible oxidation waves peaking at 0.62 V and 0.79 V respectively. These oxidation peaks are assigned to the formation of a stable radical cation and dication respectively on the IDT core. In the negative potential region, a quasi-reversible two-electron process peaking at −1.78 V was monitored and attributed to the radical anion localized on each of the end-capped BTXI moieties. Based on the onsets of the first oxidation and reduction potentials, 4 would appear to be compatible as an electron donor with the archetypal electron-acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Hence, for preliminary tests, bulk heterojunction solar cells with the architecture: ITO/PEDOT-PSS/4:PC61BM/LiF/Al were fabricated. Maximum power conversion efficiencies were reached with films spun-cast at 1000 rpm from chloroform solution containing 10 mg mL−1 of 4 and PC61BM in a 1:3 weight to weight ratio. In these conditions, the average short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill-factor (FF) were 6.74 mA cm−2, 1.03 V, and 28% respectively. Though the devices were not optimized promising average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.91% was reached with a maximum PCE of 2.08% (Fig. 6).

While the FF are modest, suggesting a need for a more thorough optimization, it is noteworthy that a Voc > 1 V was consistently reached.
To conclude, the selective and efficient bromination of the benzothioxanthene dye reported here opens new doors to the design of new π-conjugated materials useful in optoelectronics. Indeed, the resulting mono-brominated BTXI derivative shows good compatibility with the most commonly used palladium catalyzed coupling reactions. Finally, as an early stage proof of concept, a molecular system, built by grafting two BTXI on a central indacenodithiophene core was synthesized and used as donor material demonstrating promising photovoltaic activity.
