    , Accepted 15th September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractPb- or Sn-based halide perovskites usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, arising from their low electrical conductivity or oxidation state instability. It is highly desired to search for new halide perovskites with good thermoelectric properties. In this work, the thermally stable mixed-valence halide perovskite Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is revealed to be a highly promising thermoelectric material with high in-plane power factor and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity using first-principles calculations. The high in-plane power factor is achieved due to the novel two-dimensional electronic structure near the Fermi level driven by the weak interaction between AuI-5d and I-p orbitals. In addition, the small group velocities and short phonon lifetimes give rise to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. These excellent electronic and thermal properties lead to a high ZT value, which is close to 1 at 300 K and ∼4 at 800 K. Our results suggest that the 2D electronic structure from the weak interaction between d and p crystal orbitals is a promising route to design high-efficiency halide double perovskite thermoelectric materials.
I. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs)1 exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%2 as solar cell materials due to their bandgap tunability,3 long carrier lifetime,4 and superior carrier mobility.5 Their ultralow thermal conductivity6,7 combined with decent carrier mobility and Seebeck coefficient8,9 make them attractive for technological applications in thermoelectric (TE) energy conversion devices beyond solar cells. For example, Pb-based MHPs, in the case of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) single crystals, not only have a high positive Seebeck coefficient of 920 ± 91 μV K−1 at 300 K,9 but also have a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.14 ± 0.02 W K−1 m−1 at 300 K10 due to the resonant bonding within the inorganic lattice as well as the lattice coupling with the dipole order of the MA (CH3NH3) cations.11,12 However, the toxicity of Pb element and low electrical conductivities (10−7 S cm−1 to 10−4 S cm−1)10,13,14 limit their potential TE application. In contrast to the low electrical conductivities of Pb-based MHPs, Sn-based MHPs with decent electrical conductivities (∼10−2 S cm−1)15,16 are promising candidates for achieving high TE performance, attributed to the self-doping product of air exposure through the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.17 High electrical conductivities of 300 S cm−1 from Cl-doped CsSnBr3−xIx compounds18 at room temperature and 282 S cm−1 from CsSnI3 nanowires19 were reported. Yet, these Sn-based MHPs generally suffer from chemical stability issues, owing to the reactive nature of Sn in the air.20 Other metal cations, such as bismuth (Bi) and copper (Cu), have successfully formed perovskites as nontoxic thermoelectric candidates. For example, the C6H4NH2CuBr2I film can simultaneously exhibit a high electrical conductivity of 3.6 × 103 S cm−1 and a Seebeck coefficient of −70 mV K−1 at room temperature.21 The high stability methylammonium bismuth iodide (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 crystal possesses ultralow thermal conductivity (0.23 ± 0.02 W K−1 m−1)22 and highest Seebeck coefficients (+2600 ± 200 V K)23 in the classic semiconductors.
Recently, many halide double perovskites24,25 (HDPs), mutating two Pb2+ with a monovalent metal cation and a trivalent metal cation, such as Cs2AgBiX626 (X = Cl, Br) and CsInAgX6,27 were revealed with high stability28,29 and can sustain high operating temperatures.20 Moreover, charge disproportionation on metal cations can also form HDPs. For example, Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 with two valence states Au+ and Au3+ is a HDP material.30 This material has been synthesized and reported in experiments,31 exhibiting high chemical and dynamical stability.32 Furthermore, previous theoretical studies show that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 could be a good n-type photovoltaic absorber with a carrier concentration of up to 1 × 1020 cm−3 if it is grown under I-poor conditions.33 Recently, Tang et al.34 revealed that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 features (i) semiconductor behavior; (ii) higher in-plane effective masses and carrier mobility; and (iii) two-dimensional (2D) electrical gas due to the weak interaction between Au-d and I-p orbitals. Similar 2D electrical structures driven by weak hybridization of d–p orbitals have been found in some bulk TE materials, such as Fe2YZ full Heusler35 and Bi2PdO4 compounds (hybridization between Pd-dz2 and O-px/py orbitals),36 contributing to a high power factor (PF), thanks to the coexistence of high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. This feature is referred to as the “flat-and-dispersive” or “pudding-mold” band37 and “low-dimensional transport”35 in bulk TE materials. Yet, whether the 2D electrical structure can induce a promising power factor in the halide double perovskite Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 system is still unclear due to the lack of systematic research on its electrical and thermal transport properties.
In this work, using first-principles calculations and electron–phonon interaction (EPI) limited Boltzmann transport theory, a comprehensive study on the electrical transport properties and lattice thermal conductivity of p- and n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is presented. The electron relaxation time and electrical transport coefficient are calculated in the framework of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The appearance of the 2D electrical structure near the valence band edge makes Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 possess a high in-plane PF of up to almost 3.3 μW K−2 cm−1. Optimizing the carrier concentration can increase the PF up to 9.41 μW K−2 cm−1 for p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 and 5.94 μW K−2 cm−1 for n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. The thermal transport calculations show that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 has ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, resulting from its low phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime. Finally, superior ZT values are obtained, close to 1 at 300 K and 3–4 at 800 K in Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. These results demonstrate that the 2D electrical structure is an effective method to improve the electrical transport properties of HDPs, providing a promising n- and p-type halide double perovskite TE material.
II. Computational details
First-principles calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory as implemented in the Quantum Espresso package.38 Fully relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials39,40 were employed, together with a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 60 Ry. The exchange-correlation potential chosen was the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.41 Coarse 8 × 8 × 8 and 4 × 4 × 4 q-point grids were used to sample the first Brillouin zone for DFT and DFPT calculations, respectively. The optimized lattice constants are a = 8.38 and c = 12.34 Å and are converged until the force on each atom is less than 1 meV Å−1, close to the experimental lattice constants a = 8.28 and c = 12.09 Å.42 The Wannier functions for the Au-eg and I-p orbitals were constructed from Bloch states on a coarse 8 × 8 × 8 k-point grid using the Wannier90 code.43 Ultrafine Brillouin zone grids were used to calculate electron–phonon coupling (e–ph) matrix elements by Wannier interpolation,44 obtaining the electron relaxation time. The electrical transport coefficients were computed employing the Perturbo code,45 which uses an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to efficiently calculate the e–ph scattering rates and electron mobility. With the use of the ShengBTE code46 based on Boltzmann transport equations, the lattice thermal conductivity was computed by employing the second- and third-order interatomic force constants (IFCs) as the input. The harmonic force constants and third-order interatomic force constants were calculated in a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell.
The Perturbo code was employed for the accurate calculations of charge transport, including the conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and mobility as functions of temperature and carrier concentration, within an iterative solution of the linearized BTE. The BTE for transport at the steady state gives the expression of the electrical conductivity tensor:45,47 (1)

The Seebeck coefficient S can be obtained from the transport distribution function (TDF) and electrical conductivity tensor: (2)The e–ph scattering probability involving both phonon emission and absorption processes in the expression of electrical transport coefficients is defined as (3)where the key quantities e–ph matrix elements for e–ph scattering44,48 are given by (4)Here n is the band index, υnk are the band velocities, μ is the chemical potential, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge, S is the spin degeneracy, Nk is the total number of k points in the first Brillouin zone, α and β are the Cartesian directions, and Ω is the volume of the unit cell. f0nk stands for the equilibrium Fermi–Dirac distribution function of the nk state with n being the band branch and k the wave vector. εnk and ℏωvq are the energies of electron quasiparticles and phonons with wavevector q and mode index ν.
III. Results and discussion
The tetragonal phase Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 (I4/mmm, No. 139) is composed of a framework of the compressed ([AuII6]) and elongated ([AuIIII6]) octahedrons, as shown in Fig. 1a. The mixed-valence AuI (+1) and AuIII (+3) atoms surrounded by six I atoms constitute two types of octahedrons, in which the AuIII–I bond lengths are longer than AuI–I bond lengths due to the Jahn–Teller effect.49 It is understood from the view of valence electron occupation that the unoccupied 5dx2−y2 orbitals of AuIII atoms (Fig. 1c) shorten the AuIII–I (in-plane) bond lengths due to Coulomb attraction,50 resulting in elongated octahedra (Fig. 1b), accompanied by lengthening of the bond lengths between AuI (fully filled d orbitals) and I (in-plane) atoms because of geometry deformation.
 Fig. 1  (a) Crystal structure of the mixed-valence halide perovskite Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. The in-plane Au–I bond lengths in elongated [AuIIII6] and compressed [AuII6] octahedrons are 2.70 and 3.28 Å, and out-of-plane Au–I bond lengths in elongated [AuIIII6] and compressed [AuII6] octahedrons are 3.64 and 2.62 Å in the right panel. (b) Schematic diagram of the elongated [AuIIII6] octahedral structure and (c) the corresponding energy order and electron occupation of AuIII-5d orbitals, where E is the energy of d orbitals. 

Fig. 2a shows the band structure of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 along the high-symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone. The valence band maximum along the Γ–Z [001] direction is flat due to the weak hybridization between AuI-5dz2 and I-px/py orbitals, resulting in a high density of states (DOS) (Fig. 2b) near the Fermi level. On the other hand, the very dispersive valence band maximum (VBM) along the Γ–Σ [100] direction indicates a small electron effective mass. The hole effective mass 34 from the flat valence band is about two orders of magnitude heavier than that of the dispersive valence band  along the Γ–Σ direction, leading to a complicated cylindrical Fermi surface (Fig. 2c). The cylindrical Fermi surface indicates the two dimensional nature of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6, similar to 3D bulk TE materials, such as the SrTiO3 system,51 Fe2YZ full Heusler35 and Bi2PdO4.36 Therefore, Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is expected to exhibit high in-plane TE performance, especially a high PF. The two-dimensional (2D) electronic structure gives rise to a PF of up to ∼3.3 μW K−2 cm−1 along the dispersive in-plane direction, which is much larger than that in the out-of-plane direction, as shown in Fig. 2e. The in-plane PF of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is almost three times larger than that of F4-TCNQ doped FASnI3 thin films, which has shown the highest ZT value (0.19)52 among halide perovskite systems so far. However, the PF of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is much smaller than that of Fe2YZ full Heusler and Bi2PdO4. It is expected to further increase the PF of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 by doping which is one of the most effective approaches for improving TE performance.

The in-plane electronic transport coefficients (σ, S and PF) as a function of temperature for Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 with the hole concentrations changing from 1 × 1018 cm−3 to 1 × 1021 cm−3 are plotted in Fig. 3. The room temperature electrical conductivity increases from 5.39 S cm−1 to 2923.03 S cm−1 as the hole concentration changes from 1 × 1018 cm−3 to 1 × 1021 cm−3 at 300 K, and exhibits temperature dependent semiconductor-like behavior53 (Fig. 3a). In contrast to electrical conductivity, the positive Seebeck coefficients show the opposite trend with hole concentration and temperature due to the inverse relationship between them (as shown in eqn (2)). A higher Seebeck coefficient of 304.3 μV K−1 at 300 K for a hole concentration of 1 × 1019 cm−3 (Fig. 3b) is obtained and is three times larger than that of Cl-doped CsSnI3−xClx perovskite thin films (103.0 ± 1.0 μV K−1) with similar carrier concentrations (1.06 × 1019 cm−3),52 and then it increases to 239.26 μV K−1 at 800 K. The combination of the high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of hole-doped Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 results in a maximal PF of up to 9.63 μW K−2 cm−1 at 400 K due to the 2D electronic structure, which is about eight times as high as that of F4-TCNQ doped FASnI3 thin films (1.3 μW K−2 cm−1).52 The PF remains at a high value of 7.65 μW K−2 cm−1 at 800 K. The out-of-plane electronic transport coefficients are obviously inferior to in-plane electronic transport coefficients, especially the electrical conductivity and PF due to the absence of “flat-and-dispersive” bands. The out-of-plane results for p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 are given in the ESI† (as shown in Fig. S1 and S3).

Previous defect theory reveals that a high carrier concentration close to 1 × 1020 cm−3 can be achieved in n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 under I-poor conditions,33 indicating the promising electronic transport coefficients. Fig. 4 displays the in-plane electronic transport coefficients as functions of the electron concentration and temperature of n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6, and the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient show similar trends to the p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. A high absolute value of the negative Seebeck coefficient of n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 (Fig. 4b) at high temperature is obtained due to the heavy band effective mass, which is supported by band degeneracy, thanks to the small energy difference between CBM (conduction band minimum) and CBM1 (ΔECBM1–CBM = 0.012 eV) (Fig. 2a). A maximal PF of 5.97 μW K−2 cm−1 at 400 K (Fig. 4c) is achieved, exceeding those of Pb- and Sn-based halide perovskites. The out-of-plane electronic transport coefficients are comparable to in-plane electronic transport coefficients and the out-of-plane results for n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 are given in the ESI† (as shown in Fig. S2 and S4).

Fig. 5a and b display the phonon dispersion along high-symmetry directions in the first Brillouin zone and phonon density of states (PDOS) below 10 meV of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 and the full energy phonon dispersion can be found in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The absence of an imaginary mode in the whole Brillouin zone (BZ) implies that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is dynamically stable. The energy of longitudinal acoustic (LA) branches along Γ–X and Γ–Z directions is as low as 3 meV and the optical branches below 5 meV form a bunch of “flat branches” (Fig. 5a), which overlap with the acoustic branches. The atom-projected DOS reveals that I and Cs elements dominate the low-energy branches between 2 meV and 5 meV.

The temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivity indicates that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 possesses ultralow lattice thermal conductivity along in-plane (x-axis) and out-of-plane (z-axis) directions. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 at room temperature is close to that of metal halide perovskites19 and lower than those of the most outstanding thermoelectric materials PbTe (2 W K−1 m−1 at 300 K)54 and SnSe (0.34 W K−1 m−1 along the aaxis at 773 K)55 with intrinsically low thermal conductivity.
To reveal the origin of the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6, the related parameters (cλ, υλ, τλ) in the expression of lattice thermal conductivity56 based on the BTE are calculated: (5)where λ is the phonon branch with index p and wave vector q, cλ is the heat capacity, υλ is the group velocity of phonon mode λ, and τλ is the phonon lifetime. Fig. 6a shows that the group velocities of acoustic branches along the Γ–X direction and Γ–Z direction are relatively small, and are even smaller than that of Ag8SnSe6 (1522 m s−1) with a complex structure and low thermal conductivity.57 The small group velocities result in a low thermal conductivity in Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. Moreover, the large phonon scattering rates, i.e. short phonon lifetimes, are another reason for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, as shown in Fig. 6b. The phonon scattering space weighted by the phonon occupation factor (WP3)56 illustrates that a large WP3 below 5 meV (Fig. 6b) leads to strong phonon–phonon scattering due to the dense overlap between the flat optical and acoustic branches (Fig. 5a). Therefore, the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity originates from the synergistic effect of small group velocity and strong phonon–phonon scattering between the flat optical and acoustic phonons.

Based on the above analysis of electrical and thermal transport properties, decent ZT values are expected to be obtained because Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 possesses a superior power factor and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity.
The ZT values of p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 with increasing temperature and carrier concentration are shown in Fig. 7a and b. At room temperature, the maximum ZTx value reaches 1 under an optimal carrier concentration of 1 × 1019 cm−3, close to the ZT values of typical thermoelectric materials n-type Bi2Te2.79Se0.21 (ZT = 1.2)58 and p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (ZT = 1.2)59 at 300 K. With this optimum carrier concentration of 1 × 1019 cm−3, the ZTx values of p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 increase linearly with temperature and reach ∼4 at 800 K theoretically. These high ZTx values of p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 originate from its high power factor driven by the existence of the two-dimensional electronic structure of the valence band near the Fermi energy, as well as the ultralow in-plane lattice thermal conductivity. Along the out-of-plane direction, the ZTz values of p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 are relatively small, and the optimum carrier concentration is 1 × 1019 cm−3 and then changes to 1 × 1020 cm−3 beyond 550 K. Compared to the ZTx values, the lower ZTz values are caused by the extremely low carrier mobility corresponding to the flat valence band near the Fermi level along the out-of-plane direction.
 Fig. 7  Temperature and carrier concentration dependent dimensionless figure of merit ZT along in-plane and out-of-plane directions for p-type (a and b) and n-type (c and d) Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6. 
For n-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6, the ZT values vary with carrier concentration and temperature in a similar way to p-type Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6, as shown in Fig. 7c and d. Similarly, the ZTx values at room temperature are close to 1, and the ZTx values can exceed 3 at 800 K, which suggests that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is a potential p- and n-type high-performance thermoelectric material. The results indicate that it is an effective method to improve the electrical transport properties of halide perovskites by using the two-dimensional electronic structure induced by the weak interaction between orthogonal d/p orbitals.
IV. Conclusions
In summary, the first-principles calculations of thermoelectric transport properties reveal that Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 is a promising p- and n-type TE material, as reflected in its high in-plane power factor and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. The high power factor and ultralow lattice thermal conductivity result in superior ZT values, which approach 1 at 300 K and 3–4 at 800 K. The high power factor originates from the 2D electronic structure near the Fermi level due to the weak interaction between AuI-5d and I-p orbitals, while the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity results from the small group velocity and the short phonon lifetime. Our results demonstrate that the 2D electronic structure driven by d–p orbitals can realize the coexistence of high in-plane electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, i.e. high in-plane power factor, improving the thermoelectric performance of halide double perovskites. The underlying mechanism reported in this work provides guidance for searching for potential perovskite thermoelectric materials. Finally, it is worth mentioning that since Cs2Au(I)Au(III)I6 contains a noble metal, it is necessary to find more suitable and low-cost materials with a similar mechanism for practical thermoelectric applications.
