    , Accepted 12th May 2013First published on 14th May 2013AbstractA highly uniform and predesigned ZnO nanostructure fabricated by single step direct nanoimprinting was used as the efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. Improved photovoltaic cell efficiency with long-term stability can be observed due to the large interface between the active layer and nanostructured ZnO ETL.
For ultimate utilization of organic solar cells (OSC), more efforts are still required to further increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and to enhance the working lifetime of the OSC.1,2 Previous reports have shown that conventional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSC cause stability issues since the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer is acidic and corrosive to indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.3 To overcome the problem of conventional structure, OSC having an inverted structure, in which the positions of the anode and the cathode are reversed, have been demonstrated. In this architecture, air-stable and solution processable high work function metals (Au, Ag) are used as anodes to collect holes and ITO is used as the cathode to collect electrons. The cathode is composed of either PEDOT:PSS or certain high work function transition metal oxides (vanadium oxide (V2O5), molybdenum oxide (MoO3), etc.) covered by a stable metal electrode such as Au or Ag.4 One of the key components in the inverted OSC is the electron transport layer (ETL) materials on ITO electrodes such as titanium oxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3).5 Among them, air stable ZnO has been regarded as one of the promising candidates for the electron selective and hole blocking layer because of its high electron mobility and transmittance.6 In general, a sol–gel derived or physically deposited ZnO thin film is used for the inverted OSC.7 However, recent studies have revealed that nanostructured ZnO such as nanowires, wrinkles, and rods can dramatically enhance the PCE.8–10 Consequently, there is a need to develop a simple and high-resolution method for fabricating the nanostructured ZnO. Recently, metal oxide direct nanoimprint lithography (NIL) using a photosensitive sol–gel precursor has been introduced as a high-resolution, high throughput and low cost lithographic tool.11–13 It could offer reproducible ultra-large area functional nanostructures with a minimum feature size below 100 nm.
In this study, we report that highly uniform and predesigned ZnO nanostructures fabricated by a direct metal oxide nanoimprinting method are capable of creating highly efficient large area ETLs for inverted OSC. This direct metal oxide imprinting approach could not only improve the photovoltaic efficiency but also minimize process steps for fabricating ETLs because etching or deposition steps were eliminated during the formation of ETLs which should include inevitably a residual layer between the active layer and ITO.

Fig. 1a shows the device configuration of the inverted OSC composed of an ITO/ZnO/active layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag electrode. The ZnO layer on the top of the ITO electrode was used as the effective ETL of inverted OSC. The nanostructured ZnO layer and the reference layer without patterns used in the present study were fabricated using a solution precursor comprised of zinc acetate, 2-methoxyethanol and ethanolamine as a solvent and a stabilizer. Especially, photosensitive 2-nitrobenzaldehyde was introduced into the solution precursors in order to form a cross-linked network structure during photochemical reaction.14 A photosensitive precursor film was firstly spin coated on a patterned ITO substrate at 3000–5000 rpm and subsequently baked on a hotplate at 75 °C for 1 min in order to remove residual solvent. For the metal oxide direct imprint, an PFPE (perfluoropolyether) soft mold was utilized to improve filling and release characteristics based on the low surface energy.15 The PFPE mold duplicated from Si master (line width: 200 nm, space width: 600 nm) was then pressed against the Zn precursor film at a pressure of 3 bar for 5 min using a UV nanoimprintor (52 mW cm−2 with a major wavelength peak of 365 nm). After demolding, post-UV illumination was conducted additionally on the nanopattern for 10 min. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the imprinted ZnO nanopattern.

Subsequently, the ZnO nanopattern was treated at different annealing temperatures (from 250 °C to 400 °C) for removing the residual organic compounds and crystallization of ZnO. Next, for the preparation of the bulk-heterojunction solar cell, a P3HT:PCBM blended solution (2.0:2.0 by weight) was spin-coated on the top of the ZnO surface (∼200 nm) and dried at room temperature in a glove box for 2–3 h. As the hole transport layer, PEDOT:PSS solution was formed onto the active layer with a thickness of about 40 nm and baked at 150 °C for 5 min. Finally, a silver (Ag) anode electrode deposited about 100 nm under high vacuum (5.0 × 10−6 Torr) using a thermal evaporation system. As clearly seen in the cross-sectional view of the device (Fig. 1c), the active layer, PEDOT:PSS and the Ag electrode were conformally stacked on the ZnO line without air gap or defects. The photovoltaic performances of the devices were measured using an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (Oriel 500 W) at 100 mW cm−2 light illumination.
The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of devices incorporating ZnO nanopatterns treated with different annealing temperatures are compared in Fig. 2. Device identification and their performances are summarized in Table 1. As seen in Fig. 2, the device annealed at 300 °C (PH300) exhibited a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.25 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.59 V and a fill factor (FF) of 52.7%, resulting in a PCE of 3.21%. However, the device with the ZnO layer annealed at a temperature lower than 300 °C did not show any photovoltaic properties. It implies that an annealing temperature of 300 °C is required to remove the organic residues in the UV-irradiated ZnO film and to convert the amorphous ZnO film to crystalline. The insets show the comparison between patterned and planar devices (PH300).

When the annealing temperature was further increased to 330 °C (PH330) and 350 °C (PH350), as a result of reduced values of all factors of device performance, the PCE of PH330 and PH350 was decreased to 2.88% and 2.71%, respectively. The device with the ZnO pattern annealed at 400 °C (PH400) shows a reduced PCE (1.72%) with a Jsc of 7.70 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.55 V and a FF of 40.9%. It indicates that the enhanced crystallinity of the ZnO layer due to the increased annealing temperature plays a minor role in the electron transport. The degradation of the device performance with increasing annealing temperature could be attributed not only to the grain size alteration in the ZnO layer but also to the resistance change of the ITO layer. For example, the transparent and conducting ITO layer has an initial resistance of 10 Ω□−1, but it was increased up to 60 Ω□−1 after annealing at 400 °C for 1 h. In spite of the degradation with respect to the annealing temperature, it is worthwhile to note that the devices modified with the nanostructured ZnO layer had always a positive effect on the OSC performance compared with the reference device with a planar ZnO thin film, including a significant improvement of the Jsc and FF, while the Voc was similar to that of the reference device. Therefore, it is evident that the nanostructured ZnO layer directly contributes to the improvement of FF and Jsc. This result is in good agreement with the EQE plot which enhanced over the entire excitation of the spectral range as shown in Fig. 2b. Consequently, the nanopatterned ZnO layer worked as an electron carrier transport path to the ITO electrode by shortening the electron diffusion distance from the active layer, and thus the electron collection efficiency could be enhanced.
In addition to the electrical enhancement, optical enhancement could be the possible candidate for the enhanced photovoltaic properties of the nanostructured ZnO incorporated devices. To elucidate the effect of optical absorption on the enhanced PCE shown in Fig. 2, a three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was used to calculate the optical absorption in the P3HT:PCBM layer theoretically. In this calculation, the device architecture shown in Fig. 1a was used and the device is illuminated with a linearly polarized plane wave, which propagates from ITO to the Ag layer. A grid size of 0.1 nm was used in this simulation. Fig. 3 shows simulated absorption spectra as well as absorbed photon flux of the P3HT:PCBM layer for the planar and PH300 devices. The absorbed photon flux was calculated by multiplying the absorption in the P3HT:PCBM layer with AM1.5 solar spectral irradiance. Fig. 3 clearly shows that the number of absorbed photons in the P3HT:PCBM layer is slightly increased only around 600 nm wavelength. Note that the optical enhancement is only limited to the narrow spectral range between 500 nm and 630 nm compared to the EQE data shown in Fig. 2b. It implies that the optical enhancement plays a minor role in the observed enhanced Jsc, and it was overwhelmed by the electrical enhancements.

To confirm the universal Jsc gaining of the nanopatterned ZnO, an amorphous polymer of PBDTTT-C-T was employed as an active donor polymer in place of crystalline P3HT. PBDTTT-C-T was synthesized according to a known procedure16 and has a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 28.6 kDa. PBDTTT-C-T based devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM = 1:1.5/MoO3/Ag, where the active layer solution was prepared in chlorobenzene with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane as a solvent additive to optimize the active layer morphology. Fig. 4 shows the device structure of the inverted PBDTTT-C-T:PCBM solar cell and its J–V characteristics. Overall optoelectronic trends of PBDTTT-C-T based devices are exactly the same as those of the devices based on P3HT, Voc of both devices showed the same value of 0.73 V but the Jsc was increased from 11.92 to 12.95 mA cm−2 upon replacing the planar ZnO layer with the nanopatterned ZnO layer. The PCE was increased from 4.53% to 5.43% with the influence of increased Jsc as summarized in Table 1.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the nanostructured ZnO ETL fabricated by simple direct metal oxide imprinting can be used to enhance the photovoltaic performances of inverted BHJ OSC. This straightforward fabrication method provides a practical means for fabricating large-area reproducible ETLs to improve the performance of OSC by maximizing the charge collection efficiency regardless of the kind of active layer such as P3HT/PCBM and PBDTTT-C-T/PCBM.
