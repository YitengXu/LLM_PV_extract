1. Introduction
Advancing the present energy infrastructure and offering sustainable and clean energy are essential strategies to meet the huge energy demand and solve the environmental pollution issues caused by the consumption of conventional fossil fuel-based energy sources.1,2 Solar energy is one of the most abundant, sustainable and green energy. In the form of optoelectronic or opto-thermal conversion, solar energy is considered to be a major energy source for mankind in the future. The energy provided by the sun is approximately 10000 times more than the global demand (i.e., 3 × 1024 J per year).3 In other words, covering 0.1% of the earth's surface with solar cells that have an efficiency of 10% would fulfill our present energy needs.4 Solar cells are devices that use the photovoltaic effect to convert solar light directly into electricity.5–7 Photovoltaic (PV) cells are now regarded as the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity.8
The fundamental study and practical application of solar cells increased gradually over the past few years. First generation solar cells, monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon cells, can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 27% and have totally dominated the terrestrial PV market so far.9 However, the high production cost have hindered their widespread application and prompted the search for environmentally friendly and low-cost solar cell alternatives.10 Second generation solar cells, for instance, amorphous silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGSe), GaAs and CdTe, are based on thin film technologies.11–17 These second generation solar cells enrich the PV technology system and share comparable performance with conventional Si devices.9 Both first and second generation solar cells are based on single junction devices. Calculated thermodynamic efficiency limits in single junction solar cells (31%) assume that the absorption of an individual photon results in the formation of a single electron–hole pair and that all photon energy in excess of the energy gap is lost as heat.18 After approximately 20 years of research and development, third generation hybrid film solar cells emerged. This new generation of photovoltaic systems includes mainly dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs),19–22 organic photovoltaics,23,24 perovskite solar cells,25–27 quantum dot (QD) solar cells, etc.28–30 DSCs, made of simple materials and produced with inexpensive equipment, obtained a great breakthrough with an efficiency of 7.1% in 1991 and then have achieved a certified efficiency of 11.9% to date.31 Regarding organic photovoltaics, enabling low-cost fabrication on flexible substrates, diverse organic semiconductors have been synthesized and investigated to improve the PCE, and the best value of 11.5% was reported recently.31 Perovskite solar cells currently have a NREL certified record efficiency of 22.7%,31 showing a marked upward trend.
QD solar cells are attracting enormous attention because of the distinguished optoelectronic properties of QD light harvesting materials.19,33 QDs are single crystals of inorganic semiconductors with an electronic wave function quantum-confined in all three dimensions.34–36 As shown in Fig. 1, the nanometer scaled size attributes a quantum confinement effect to the particles, giving rise to tunable band gaps, high molar extinction coefficients, and large intrinsic dipole moments.32 The great interest in QD solar cells also arises from the phenomenon called multiexciton generation (MEG) that can be used for achieving higher efficiency solar cells.37Fig. 2 shows the typical cell device architectures employing QDs as light absorbers. The Schottky-junction solar cell is a simple device, in which an ultrathin film of colloidal QDs is sandwiched between two contacts for the extraction of photogenerated electrons and holes.38 In a basic Schottky-junction solar cell, an interface between a metal and a semiconductor provides the band bending necessary for charge separation.19 Schottky junction solar cells are the simplest photovoltaic device that can be fabricated. In addition, colloidal QD sensitized solar cells using a simple Schottky junction offer potentials where solution-processed QDs can be applied to achieve low-cost solar devices.40 The devices known as depleted-heterojunction solar cells take advantage of an n–p heterojunction between a transparent n-type TiO2 electrode and an active layer.39 These devices overcome the limitations of Schottky type cells associated with the low built-in voltages. Hybrid solar cells incorporating both organic and inorganic semiconducting materials aim to combine the advantages of both classes of materials. Hybrid photovoltaics have organic materials consisting of conjugated polymers to absorb light as the electron donor and transport holes. Inorganic QD materials in hybrid cells are used as the electron acceptor and transporter in the structure.41 Even though the efficiencies of organic and hybrid solar cells are still limited, it is expected that their efficiency will continue to increase. QDSCs are a straightforward extension of DSCs by inheriting their sandwiched device structure consisting of a photoanode, an infiltrating liquid electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE).1 QDSCs, having the advantages of a low-cost assembling process, economically viable materials, and intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QD sensitizers, are regarded as attractive candidates for low-cost third generation solar cells.34,42,43

QDSCs emerged from the foundations of DSCs and similarly took advantage of the high interfacial areas between a nanoporous transparent conductive oxide and light absorbing materials.45 The structure of QDSCs is shown in Fig. 3, which commonly contains three components: photoanode (QD sensitizers adsorbed on the surface of a wide-band gap semiconductor), electrolyte (containing a redox couple) or hole transport material (HTM), and CE. As demonstrated by the publication number on QDSCs (Fig. 4), more and more research studies on QDSCs have been reported, accompanied by a progressive increase in PCE.46–50 Since the concept of QD sensitized metal oxide nanocrystalline has been proposed in 1986,51 extensive efforts have been made for QDSCs in order to achieve high efficiency devices.52–54 In solar cell development, PCE and stability are always crucial issues for practical applications.55–57 The overall performance of QDSCs is dependent on the interplay of the charge excitation from the QD sensitizer, injection into the metal oxide (normally TiO2) substrate, and transport in the circuit, as well as the transfer of the photogenerated holes and regeneration of the redox couple.58–61 Therefore, a collaborative endeavor has been made to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs by optimizing the QD sensitizers, nanostructured TiO2, redox electrolyte, and CE.62–66

To obtain a high PCE, one of the important elements is the QD photosensitizer, which should possess a high absorption coefficient67 and an appropriate band gap to efficiently harvest solar light.10 Furthermore, an ideal QD sensitizer should possess a conduction band edge that is higher than that of the TiO2 substrate, so as to support the driving force for photo-generated electron injection from the conduction band of the QD sensitizer to the TiO2 electron acceptor. Many researchers have endeavored to synthesize QD photosensitizers, including CdS,68–70 CdSe,71–74 CdSeTe,75 CdSeS,76 CdTe,77 InAs,78 Bi2S3,79 CuInS2,80 Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe)81 and their diverse combinations. In QDSCs, the role of the CE is to transfer electrons coming from the external circuit and to catalyze the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolyte at the electrolyte/CE interface.82–85 The primary requirements for the CE materials are excellent stability, good electron catalytic activity for the reduction of the redox couple, and high conductivity for charge transport.86 Concretely, the CE materials are mainly classified into five types: noble metals, metallic compounds, carbon derivatives, polymers, and heterostructures consisting of combinations of the other four types.85 In recent reports, Cu2S was demonstrated to be a promising CE catalytic material due to its excellent catalytic activity towards the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, leading to highly efficient QDSCs.86–89 In addition, QDSCs also require an electrolyte with a redox mediator. The electrolyte plays a crucial role in the regeneration of the QDs and charge transfer between the photoanode and CE in QDSCs.90 A variety of electrolytes were investigated, among which, an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte had proved itself as the most competitive one. So far, a few systemic reviews of photoanodes and CEs have been reported,1,8–10,17,19,33,34,36,38,40,42–45,67,91–100 whereas a comprehensive review on electrolytes has not been presented. Therefore, this review is mainly focused on electrolytes for QDSCs.
2. Electrolytes
As the central component of a QDSC, the electrolyte redox couple is essential to regenerate QDs and transport holes to the CE.101 The efficiency of a QDSC device is determined by its short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). All of the three parameters will be significantly affected by the electrolyte in QDSCs, and by the interaction of the electrolyte with the electrode interfaces. For instance, Jsc is dependent on the transport of the redox couple in the electrolyte.1 The FF can be affected by the catalyzing ability of CE materials for the reduction of the redox couple.148,149 The Voc value is significantly affected by the redox potential of the electrolyte.3 Theoretically, Voc is determined by the energy difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 electron acceptor and the redox potential of the electrolyte. For the redox electrolyte to be effective, high solubility, high ionic mobility and fast electron transfer kinetics are crucial. In QDSCs, electrolyte systems are normally divided into liquid, quasi-solid, and solid-state electrolytes based on their physical state.102–104 The difference between quasi-solid and solid electrolytes is that quasi-solid electrolytes still contain a molecular redox system, but the liquid has been solidified using a gel, polymer, etc. The purely solid electrolytes are based on molecular or polymeric hole-conductors, and thus there is no extra redox system present.
2.1 Liquid electrolytes

2.1.1 Polysulfide redox couple electrolytes. 
In many studies of QDSCs, sodium sulfide (Na2S) and elemental sulfur (S) were used to obtain the polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple in aqueous electrolytes as they can prevent chalcogenide QDs from degradation in electrolytes. The working mechanism of this redox couple in the QDSC can be explained by the following processes.33 The reduced species (S2−) in the redox couple collect holes at the photoelectrode (TiO2/QDs), more precisely at the photoanode/electrolyte interface (reactions (1) and (2)). S2− + 2h+ → S(1) S + Sn−12− → Sn2−(2)
After the ion diffusion process in the polysulfide redox couple electrolyte, the oxidized species (Sn2− ions) are converted back to S2− by collecting electrons at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface (reaction (3)). Sn2− + 2e− → Sn−12− + S2−(3)
The S2−/Sn2− redox couple is able to mediate the carrier for cadmium chalcogenide QDSCs efficiently. Most of the high efficiency QDSCs reported used the polysulfide aqueous electrolyte. However, it was evidenced that the polysulfide redox couple electrolyte was not suitable for lead sulfide (PbS) QDs because of the photo-corrosion problem.91 On the basis of previous research, Zhong's group obtained an unprecedented new PCE record.105 As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the constructed Cd-free green Cu–In–S–Zn (CIS-Z) solar cell shows a best PCE of 7.04% based on the polysulfide aqueous electrolyte.105 Recently, the highest efficiency of 12.57% in QDSCs was also achieved by Zhong's group employing ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7 under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination (Fig. 5c and d).106 It should be noted that the solar cell devices were also constructed by assembling the sensitized photoanodes and the counter electrode filled with the polysulfide redox couple electrolyte.

However, other studies indicated that it is difficult for the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte system to penetrate into the nanostructure due to the high surface tension of water, giving rise to inefficient contact between the photoanode and electrolyte and thus a poor cell performance.107–109 Using other lower surface tension solvents, such as methanol, can lead to a polysulfide electrolyte with better penetration, but the ion dissociation abilities of the electrolyte prepared with methanol is less than that prepared with water.110–112 Considering the better ion dissociation ability of water and the better penetration of methanol, water–methanol mixed solution was proposed as a co-solvent to prepare the polysulfide electrolyte. In our previous studies, polysulfide electrolyte solution containing 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in a methanol–water (3:7, v/v) solution was used to fabricate QDSCs.113 Specifically, the QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were facilely prepared by pipetting a MPA-capped CdS/CdSe QD aqueous solution onto the TiO2 film, followed by a covering process with a ZnS layer and a post-sintering process. The polysulfide electrolyte and Cu2S counter electrode were used to provide higher photocurrents and fill factors for the constructed cell devices. The resulting CdS/CdSe sensitized solar cells show a photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.32%.113 In addition, a polysulfide electrolyte system was investigated and optimized by Liao and co-workers.109 In their work, water–methanol mixed solution was taken as the solvent for this polysulfide electrolyte, considering simultaneously the penetration ability and the ion dissociation of the electrolyte. The optimal ratio of the ingredients contained in the electrolyte was determined based on the performance of the QDSCs. With this optimized methanol/water ratio, the efficiency of the QDSC was enhanced by around 40%, caused by a good balance between the penetration ability of the solvent and ion dissociation in the electrolyte.109 The work facilitates the development of a highly efficient electrolyte in the general field of QDSCs. Overall, the introduction of methanol could not only improve electron injection efficiency by lowering the Fermi level of the TiO2 film but also lead to better contact between the QDs and the electrolyte due to improved wetting.72,114,115 However, some researchers considered that methanol potentially acts as a sacrificial electron donor to the redox system by scavenging photogenerated holes.116–118 As a result, the methanol oxidization at the photoelectrode is nonregenerative.117
To date, the most-widely used electrolyte for QDSCs is polysulfide redox couple aqueous solution, because of its good compatibility with sensitizers and superior hole-extraction ability from the valence band (VB) of semiconductor sensitizers.119 This leads to good performance in many types of QDSCs. The photovoltaic parameters and photoactive materials of QDSCs based on polysulfide electrolytes are illustrated in Table 1.

2.1.2 Additives. 
As discussed above, the polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple aqueous solution electrolyte is commonly used in QDSCs since this electrolyte medium can stabilize the commonly used chalcogenide QD sensitizers and can also offer an acceptable photovoltaic performance to the resultant QDSCs. However, because of the relatively high redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte, the obtained Voc values in QDSCs, usually less than 0.65 V, are substantially lower than those in DSCs. New redox couple systems, such as I−/I3− and Co2+/3+ complexes and organic redox couples, have been tested in QDSCs, yet failed to achieve higher PCEs because of the incompatibility of QDs in these electrolytes or the severe charge recombination present.5,150–152 In order to get the desired high PCE, at present, it is wise to rely on the typical polysulfide electrolyte with modifications.
In DSC systems, a common method to enhance the photovoltaic properties is the introduction of additives into iodide/triiodide electrolytes, such as deoxycholic acid,153 4-tert-butylpyridine154 and guanidinium thiocyanate.155 It has been demonstrated that these additives can suppress the charge recombination and tune the Fermi level of TiO2.156 Consequently, the photovoltaic performance of DSC devices can be increased remarkably. Related mechanisms and techniques have been well investigated, and three beneficial effects could be summarized.157,158 It can adjust the potential of the redox couple and passivate the surface trap states of the metal oxide substrate, retarding charge recombination processes. Moreover, the conduction band edge of the metal oxide substrate will be shifted. These ideas were borrowed to modify the polysulfide electrolyte with electrolyte additives to improve the performance of the resultant QDSCs. However, the additives that were applied in DSCs cannot be directly used in QDSCs since these electrolytes are two different systems. Specifically, the nitrile solvents used in DSCs are polar aprotic organic solvents, in which the nitrogen-containing additives are stable and exist in a nearly “naked” state to exert a satisfactory nucleophilic ability, which favors them to be adsorbed on target sites and perform their functions. However, the nucleophilic ability of nitrogen-containing species is dramatically weakened in aqueous polysulfide electrolyte systems. This is the reason that the application of additives in polysulfide electrolytes is rather limited.
A research study where guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) was incorporated into a polysulfide electrolyte to fabricate a CdS-based QDSC was reported by Ho et al.159 The PCE could be enhanced from 1.79% to 2.01% with the addition of GuSCN to the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte of the solar cell. Based on early research, an unprecedented PCE of 6.74% for CdSe-based QDSCs was obtained by using a modified polysulfide electrolyte with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the additive (Fig. 6a and b) by Zhong's group.71 The PEG additive in the polysulfide electrolyte can serve as a barrier layer over both TiO2 and QD surfaces by inducing the steric hindrance effect, consequently retarding the charge recombination between the photoanode and the electrolyte and improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs (Fig. 6c). A similar discovery was reported by adding poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte.75 The average PCE was improved by 9% for CdSexTe1−x based solar cells. As shown in Fig. 6d, the PVP modified electrolyte was applied to various QD sensitizer based QDSCs. Meanwhile, the voltage decay rates for the cells with the polysulfide electrolyte containing PVP additives were much slower than those of the reference cell without the PVP additive (Fig. 6e) and the electron lifetime of cells using the PVP modified polysulfide electrolyte was obviously longer than that of the cell without the PVP additive (Fig. 6f).

Polyelectrolytes bearing electrolyte groups are charged polymers, dissociating readily in aqueous solutions and their solution possesses not only the ionic conductivity of electrolytes but also the cohesive properties of polymers. Based on the above theory, Jovanovski et al.160 designed and synthesized a novel pyrrolidinium based ionic liquid (IL), which was introduced into the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte to investigate the PV efficiency of CdSe-sensitized solar cells in 2011. The PCE reached a promising 1.86% under 1 sun illumination, with excellent photoanode stability over 10 days. These results showed similar photocurrents but a decrease in FF and Voc using the IL compared with the previous aqueous polysulfide electrolyte.161 Subsequently, some additives such as sodium polyacrylate (PAAS-Na) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) with ionic conductivity were added to a polysulfide electrolyte by Zhong's group.162,163 The typical negatively charged polyelectrolytes possess hydrophilic groups and a three-dimensional network, by which a large quantity of water can be rapidly absorbed into the framework of additives. Experimental results revealed that the ionic conductivity of additive based electrolytes is comparable to that of aqueous polysulfide electrolyte solutions.163 In addition, the additives led to the gelation of the electrolyte and expedited cell stability without degrading the solar cell performance. Recently, similar work was reported by Meng's group in 2016.164 They studied for the first time photo-chemically and electro-chemically stable silica nanoparticles (NPs),164 which were introduced as an additive into a polysulfide electrolyte to modify the QD/TiO2 surface for high-efficiency CdSexTe1−x QDSCs (Fig. 6h). Research illustrated that the cell device with a PEG (6.0 wt%) composite electrolyte presented a lower PCE than that of the device with the corresponding SiO2 composite electrolyte (Fig. 6g).164 When silica is dispersed in a polysulfide electrolyte, isolated silanols may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules to give a three-dimensional (3D) network gel structure.164 A PCE of 11.23% has been achieved and the cell stability has been significantly improved as well.164 Unlike conventional gelating liquid electrolytes, the existence of SiO2 mainly restrains interfacial recombination and thereby improves the performance of QDSCs.
In brief, the electrolyte additives can be mainly divided into two types according to whether the additives possess free charge. Generally, similar PCE to that of the pristine polysulfide electrolyte without additives can be obtained for the additives with free charge, but better stability.162,163 However, the uncharged additives can not only improve the stability but also increase the PV efficiency of the cells.71,75,90 It should be noted that the addition of some additives makes the electrolyte transform into a quasi-gel state. Although the detailed mechanism of how the various additives in the polysulfide electrolyte affect the performance of the cell is not clear at this moment, this approach of improving the performance including PCE and stability is noteworthy. In recent years, other different additives were used to modified the electrolyte and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters and photoactive materials of QDSCs are summarized in Table 2.

2.1.3 Other redox couple electrolytes. 
The utilization of a Sn2−/S2− aqueous solution electrolyte for QDSCs enables fast scavenging of photoinduced holes and stabilizing chalcogenide QD light absorbers. Compared to the commonly used I−/I3− redox couple in DSCs, the polysulfide electrolyte presents an undesirable high redox potential, thus resulting in a relatively low open-circuit photovoltage in the QDSC system. In order to obtain higher efficiency in QDSCs, it is required to have a suitable redox couple in an electrolyte mediator.
It is known that some disadvantages still exist for the polysulfide redox electrolyte.166,167 For example, the Voc of the resultant QDSCs is usually lower than 0.65 V due to the relatively high redox potential of the polysulfide redox couple. The FF and Voc were further increased by selecting an appropriate redox couple electrolyte, such as replacing the S2−/Sn2− redox couple with [(CH3)4N]2S/[(CH3)4N]2Sn in an organic solvent, yielding an impressive Voc of 1.2 V.168 Recently, an electrolyte of the Co2+/Co3+ redox system is used to improve the Voc due to the relatively low redox potential compared to the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, whereas the photocurrents are still lower than that of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple. Moreover, Fe2+/Fe3+ the Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− redox systems are also investigated in CdS sensitized solar cells.169 The photovoltaic parameters and photoactive materials of QDSCs based on other electrolytes are shown in Table 3.

Great achievements have been made in QDSCs, but the long-term stability is also important in realizing the commercialization of QDSCs. The volatilization of the liquid electrolyte and the permeation of oxygen molecules lead to the rapid degradation of performance during the operation of the device. By addressing this issue, an effective approach to solve such a problem can be achieved by replacing the volatile liquid electrolyte with quasi-solid-state or solid-state electrolytes.

2.2 Quasi-solid-state electrolytes
Generally, liquid electrolytes are used in QDSCs. Despite the high conversion efficiency of QDSCs, photovoltaic devices that employ a liquid electrolyte may have other problems, including flammability, difficulty in handling, leakage, easy vaporization and performance instability.172–175 Thus, the presence of a liquid electrolyte in conventional devices may also result in some practical limitations for sealing and long term stability.162,163 To improve the stability and sealing ability of liquid-junction QDSCs, an alternative solution, quasi-solid-state solar cells using organic polymer gelators and inorganic gelators, was attempted.162,176–182 A quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte shows high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability and favorable penetration ability into nanocrystalline porous TiO2 films, and thus it has been widely used in QDSCs.176,178–181,183–186 In general, a liquid electrolyte is trapped in the network to form a homogeneous quasi-solid-state electrolyte. For a better comparison, the digital images of each electrolyte condition are shown in Fig. 7a.178 In addition, several solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) have been tried in QDSCs. The performance of GPE based QDSCs is much better compared to that of the SPE based QDSCs. This is because SPEs suffer from ionic transport limitations and have low conductivity.

Yu and co-workers used a chemically crosslinked polyacrylamide-based hydrogel as the polymer matrix to prepare a quasi-solid-state polysulfide electrolyte for the first time for CdS/CdSe QDSCs and an efficiency of 4.0% was achieved.182 Yong's group used a three-dimensional ZnO nanostructured photoelectrode modified with CdS and CdSe QDs.178 Using an Au deposited CE, the cells exhibited ∼4.68% photon-to-current conversion efficiency with a methanol/water mixed polysulfide electrolyte under 1 sun irradiation. In the study, they successfully improved the cell stability using an oligomer-based gel electrolyte. The sandwich assembled QDSC system is shown in Fig. 7c. The photoresponse parameters of PEGDME-containing electrolyte-based quantum dot coupled ZnO nanostructures are shown in Fig. 7d. The modified gel electrolyte showed comparable photo-response properties to those of a liquid electrolyte. Huo et al. investigated the transition temperature (Tgel) of gel to liquid, a parameter that can be used to reflect the gelation strength and intrinsic stability of a hydrogel.177 As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the hydrogel remains in the gel state below 96 °C, which will contribute to the long-term stability of the QDSCs. A polyelectrolyte with superior water-absorbing and water-holding capacity, sodium polyacrylate (PAAS), was attempted to gelate conventional aqueous polysulfide electrolytes to construct quasi-solid state QDSCs by Zhong's group.162 For further exploring the effect of gelation on the performance of QDSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 8, the similar Cμ values of both cells demonstrate that the gelation of the liquid polysulfide electrolyte does not affect the level of the conduction band or the density of states of TiO2. In addition, the gel-QDSCs and liquid-QDSCs present similar Rs (the series resistance) and RCE (the charge transfer resistance at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface), indicating that the gelation of the electrolyte by sodium polyacrylate has no negative effects on the charge transfer between the interfaces of electrode/electrolyte and TiO2/QDs/electrolyte. Table 4 summarizes some of the results for QDSCs based on quasi-solid-state electrolytes. So far, the highest PCE reported for QDSCs based on quasi-solid-state electrolytes is 9.17% by Zhong's group.163

2.3 Solid-state electrolytes (hole-transport materials, HTMs)
When it comes to discussing the topic of commercial application of solar cell devices, the stability issue remains a barrier.188 It is known that the volatilization and leakage of liquid electrolytes are among the main factors that restrict the long-term stability of liquid-junction solar cell devices. In order to tackle this problem, significant achievements have been made by employing quasi-solid-state and solid-state electrolytes.189 Thus, a crucial factor to advance the efficiency is to improve the conductivity and penetration ability of the electrolyte. For example, gel electrolytes from mesoporous silica nanoparticles and polyacrylamide have displayed a high charge transfer ability similar to that of liquid electrolytes. Although the photovoltaic performances of quasi-solid-state QDSCs have been markedly enhanced, their long-term stability is still unsatisfactory. With further increasing the stability of QDSCs, solid-state electrolytes and hole conductors have been used to replace the liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolytes in QDSCs.190,191 However, the conversion efficiency is relatively lower than that of those based on liquid electrolytes (Table 5). The main reasons for unsatisfactory photovoltaic behavior can be attributed to the weak penetration ability of polymer solid-state electrolytes into mesoporous TiO2 films as well as the relatively inferior electron conductivity, which limits the film thickness of solid electrolytes and lowers the light harvesting efficiency.

In recent research studies, many solid-state organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) have been evaluated due to their advantages including good thermal stability and facile manufacture, such as poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT),192 3,3′′′-didodecyl-quaterthiophene (QT12),193 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),20,194–196 benzimidazolium (Ben),197 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorine (spiro-OMeTAD)198–200 and inorganic p-type materials such as CuSCN201 have been investigated to substitute the liquid electrolyte.
The application of an all solid-state electrolyte with a benzimidazolium salt-based conductor was reported by Dang et al. for the first time197 (Fig. 9a and b). The QDSC employing a 1,3-dihexylbenzimidazolium thiocyanate-based electrolyte yielded an optimized PCE of 4.26% and a Jsc of 12.58 mA cm−2.197 Chang et al. fabricated solid state QDSCs based on Pb5Sb8S17 nanoparticles using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM202 (Fig. 9c and d). The best cell yielded a Jsc of 11.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.48 V, a FF of 0.31, and a PCE of 1.76% under 1 sun.202 Zhang et al. demonstrated an environmentally friendly solid-state QDSC using ZnO@Ag2S core–shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) as the photoanode in combination with the conducting polymer P3HT and the device with 8 SILAR cycles for QD formation exhibited a Jsc of 2.021 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.363% (ref. 203) (Fig. 10). Park et al. synthesized PbS QDs embedded with CuS (PbS(CuS) QDs) by rapid injection of a sulfur precursor into a lead precursor solution followed by cation exchange of Pb with Cu ions.204 The mesoscopic PbS/CuS solid-state QDSC showed a Voc of 0.6 V, a Jsc of 20.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.65, and an overall PCE of 8.07% under 1 sun illumination. Although an efficiency of 8.07% for P3HT-containing QDSCs is reported, it depends largely on the PbS QD sensitizer, providing a wider absorption range for the incident light.204 Small molecule based solid-state HTMs, as a facilely prepared and low-cost alternative to solid-state electrolytes for QDSCs, have received little attention in addition to several plastic crystalline and p-type semiconductors. For other HTMs, spiro-OMeTAD demands a lengthy synthesis and is obtained in a low yield, whereas P3HT-based QDSCs require the time-consuming either thermal or solvent annealing to reach maximum performance. The performance parameters of cells fabricated with different solid-state HTMs are summarized in Table 5. Therefore, so far, solid-state QDSCs have still shown much lower efficiency because of the mass transport limitation. Although the research on all-solid-state HTMs for QDSC applications is in a primary stage, the promising peculiarity will trigger researchers to explore more efficient and stable QDSC materials and devices.

3. Summary and outlook
Many new and interesting scientific advances have been made in recent years along with significant progress in attaining higher PCE for QDSCs. Systematic optimization of each of its components has been carried out based on a thorough understanding of the working principles and bottlenecks of QDSCs, including designing and synthesizing appropriate QD sensitizers, designing nanostructured semiconductor oxide scaffolds to increase the QD loading amount and facilitate charge separation and transportation, developing QD compatible electrolytes, and fabricating high performance CEs. To date, significantly improved device performances have been achieved with a record PCE of 12.57% by Zhong's group.106 However, the current photovoltaic performance is still not comparable to that of other photovoltaic devices.
This review highlights the utilization of various redox couple liquid-junction electrolytes for QDSCs and their corresponding performances. Apart from improving the conversion efficiency, the long-term stability is also necessary to be taken into account. Generally, polymer gel electrolytes and solid-state hole conductors as quasi-state and solid-state electrolytes are utilized in QDSCs. However, the properties of the QDSCs employing quasi-state electrolytes and solid-state electrolytes are still poorer than that of those based on liquid-junction electrolytes. Currently, the polysulfide/sulfide redox couple aqueous electrolyte has remained a preferred choice for most liquid-junction QDSCs because it can stabilize the commonly used chalcogenide QD light-harvesting materials and offer a moderate performance for the resulting cell devices. In order to further improve the performance of QDSCs in the future, new redox couples with low redox potential should be exploited for QDSCs. However, both the chemical corrosion of the QDs and the slow QD regeneration rate limit the adoption of other common redox couples such as Co2+/3+ complexes and I−/I3−. Besides exploiting new redox couples, the utilization of electrolyte additives is another strategy to modify the electrochemical properties of electrolytes. Solid-state QDSCs are expected to be a promising direction to solve the stability problem of QDSCs, since the liquid-junction devices suffer from the problems of electrolyte leakage and anodic corrosion. In this case, p-type semiconductors with high hole mobility, such as CuSCN, CsSnI3 and Cs2SnI6, are good choices as hole transfer materials for solid-state QDSCs.
