    , Accepted 25th January 2016First published on 27th January 2016AbstractPerovskites have recently emerged as promising materials for high-performance, low-cost photovoltaic devices. Here, we report a one-step, solvent-induced, fast crystallization method based on sec-butyl alcohol to produce flat, uniform CH3NH3PbI3 films. sec-Butyl alcohol has proven to be a suitable solvent not only for the CH3NH3PbI3 fast crystallization deposition process, but also for adjusting the amount of CH3NH3I in CH3NH3PbI3 films. Planar heterojunction solar cells with flat and pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 films yielded an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1 ± 1.2% and the highest PCE of 14.3%; no hysteresis was observed by changing the scan direction in our devices under standard AM 1.5 illumination. Remarkably, we found that the presence of CH3NH3I in CH3NH3PbI3 films has a positive effect on the photovoltaic device performance.
Introduction
Perovskites have recently emerged as promising materials for high-performance, low-cost photovoltaic devices.1–10 Recently, organometallic lead-halide perovskite solar cells have shown one of the most rapid growths ever in photovoltaic history.11–13 Within a short period of time, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has already exceeded 20%.14
To boost the solar cell efficiency, perovskite films can be adopted in various types of solar cell architectures including perovskite-sensitized solar cells,15 meso-superstructured solar cells, and planar p–i–n heterojunction solar cells.16,17 The latter, which have a device architecture resembling that of polymer solar cells, are particularly attractive for potential commercialization because of the simplicity of the device structure and low-temperature solution processability.17–21 To avoid shunting in such planar devices, a pinhole-free homogenous perovskite film must be deposited. One-step spin coating is among the simplest methods adopted to fabricate low-cost solar cell devices; however, the formation of nonporous homogenous perovskite films by spin coating the directly mixed blend precursor solution—consisting of lead iodine (PbI2) and methylammonium halide (MAI, CH3NH3I)—is very challenging.22–24
Recently, a new solvent engineering method was proposed in one-step spin coating to fabricate perovskite layers with planar geometry; after spin coating a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of CH3NH3PbI3, the wet film was immediately exposed to chlorobenzene to induce fast crystallization.25–27 This method, based on the use of toluene or chlorobenzene, produced smooth and homogeneous films. However, these perovskite cells with toluene or chlorobenzene as solvents are not applicable for mass production due to their high toxicity and cost. Therefore, a solution processing technique based on nontoxic solvents, which can regulate the perovskite crystallization process and produce high-quality films with controllable morphology, is highly desirable for the standardized preparation of planar devices.
In this paper, we verified the validity by using sec-butyl alcohol as a new solvent to contribute to flat, pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 films. The corresponding processing procedure is also described in detail. In the process, sec-butyl alcohol was used to induce CH3NH3PbI3 fast crystallization and obtain an appropriate MAI content in CH3NH3PbI3 films. Since MAI can also be removed partially during the sec-butyl alcohol washing step, an excess of MAI was dissolved in a mixture solution to compensate for the decrease of MAI in the washing and soaking step, and to increase the solubility of PbI2 in DMF. Then, the excess MAI can be removed by accurately controlling the soaking time in sec-butyl alcohol. Finally, a heating process was carried out to remove the residual sec-butyl alcohol solvent, and to further promote the crystallization. Planar heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with a maximum PCE of 14.3%, and no hysteresis was observed by changing the scan direction. An average PCE of 13.1% was achieved upon analysis of 40 cells.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the adopted fabrication process. The mixture solution was spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 6000 rpm and, after several seconds of delay time (the delay time depended on the concentration of PbI2 and the PbI2:MAI molar ratio), the wet film was selectively washed with sec-butyl alcohol (washing step). Here, a high spin rate was used to accelerate the DMF evaporation and reduce the roughness of the perovskite films. After the spinning stopped, the film was soaked with sec-butyl alcohol (soaking step). The soaking time was optimized depending on the MAI concentration. Then, the sample was dried by spin coating at 6000 rpm for 30 s. The films were annealed in ambient air at 100 °C for 30 min to remove any residual solvent and MAI, and to further promote the crystallization (heating step). More descriptions on the experimental process can be found in the ESI.†

In the washing step, we tested several solvents including toluene, chlorobenzene, and sec-butyl alcohol. The latter was eventually found to perform better than the other solvents, showing fewer pinholes and higher reproducibility. Three films were prepared from the same solution with a PbI2:MAI precursor molar ratio of 1:1 (SEM images in Fig. 2a–c). Although all three solvents produced smooth and homogeneous CH3NH3PbI3 films, toluene and chlorobenzene led to higher roughness and more pinholes. Absorption spectra and XRD patterns—shown in Fig. 2d–e—were also obtained to evaluate the perovskite films produced using the three solvents. As shown in Fig. 2d, the absorption spectra of the films based on toluene and chlorobenzene are considerably similar; the presence of more pinholes only gives a slight decrease in the wavelength range of 600–700 nm. However, the absorption of the film based on sec-butyl alcohol was significantly lower than that of the films based on the other solvents. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2e clarify the reason behind this different behavior; in contrast to the other films, the sec-butyl alcohol film exhibits a strong PbI2 diffraction peak at nearly 12.6°. The appearance of the PbI2 diffraction peak implies that the sec-butyl alcohol washing step can remove a considerable quantity of MAI, leading to a lower absorption, which is not consistent with the morphology analysis results.

Perovskite solar cells with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al were fabricated on three films as shown in Fig. 2. The photocurrent curves of the devices based on three solvents are very similar (see Fig. 3). All curves exhibited a small VOC (∼0.8 V). The awful properties of devices using toluene and chlorobenzene as solvents could have resulted from the massive pinholes in the films (see Fig. S1(a) and (b)†). However, the device properties using sec-butyl alcohol solvent were also so-so due to the lack of MAI as mentioned earlier (see Fig. 2e). The corresponding PCEs of the devices using toluene, chlorobenzene, and sec-butyl alcohol as solvents are 6.86%, 7.77%, and 7.68%, respectively, which were slightly lower than those in other reports.25 There are two possible causes for the above results: the low solution concentration and high humidity environment (nearly 15%).

To correct this problem, MAI (excess, 1:2 PbI2:MAI molar ratio) was added to the mixture solution. The higher MAI concentration compensates for the decrease of MAI during the sec-butyl alcohol washing step and increases the solubility of PbI2 in DMF, which may enhance the coverage. However, as the excess of MAI hinders the formation of perovskite,28 superfluous MAI present in the film was further removed during the next soaking process. The SEM images of the film show the actual process. The morphology of the film fabricated without the soaking step appears very flat and with high coverage, but the irregular cracks reveal that the thin film does not consist of a perovskite crystal (Fig. 4a). The morphology changes after the sec-butyl alcohol soaking step, as shown in Fig. 4b–d; an increased soaking time (5 s, 10 s, and 15 s) causes a gradual formation of the perovskite crystal. After 15 s of soaking time, the film is clearly stacked with fine crystals. The absorption spectra and XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4e and f reveal the effect of the soaking step. The absorption spectra of the film without sec-butyl alcohol soaking are largely different from the typical perovskite absorption spectra, exhibiting low absorption at long wavelengths (Fig. 4e). The XRD patterns of the same film exhibited impurity peaks at approximately 11.5° and weak CH3NH3PbI3 crystal lattice diffraction peaks (Fig. 4f). This suggests that the excess of MAI hinders the formation of perovskite. When the film was soaked with sec-butyl alcohol for longer than 5 s, a typical absorption trend across the UV-visible range indicated the formation of perovskite. The impurity peaks in the XRD pattern disappeared, while the intensity of the CH3NH3PbI3 peaks increased, as superfluous MAI was removed during the soaking step. Therefore, an increased soaking time causes a slight increase in the absorption and intensity of the CH3NH3PbI3 peaks.

We produced perovskite films with excellent morphology, crystallization, and absorption properties; however, the influence of the sec-butyl alcohol soaking time needs to be further discussed, as the change of soaking time causes little variation in absorption and XRD patterns. For this reason, perovskite solar cells with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al were fabricated to evaluate the films. The perovskite films were fabricated by the same process, using a mixture solution with a 1:2 PbI2:MAI molar ratio. Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent curves of the devices fabricated using the same procedure, but with different sec-butyl alcohol soaking times (0 s, 3 s, 8 s, 10 s, 12 s, and 15 s). In the devices with increased soaking time (below 12 s), the formation of more perovskite provides an increase in short-circuit current density (JSC), while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) slightly decreases. At this stage, the PCEs of the devices clearly increased. The maximum PCE of 13.3% was achieved after 10 s of soaking. Substantial changes occurred after 12 s of soaking time, as the JSC reached the maximum value of 21.23 mA cm−2; however, the VOC decreased by a large margin, which led to a decrease of the PCE. After 15 s of soaking, the JSC and VOC decreased simultaneously. Table 1 summarizes the calculated JSC, VOC, and fill factor (FF) values. The dark current densities of the same devices are shown in Fig. 5b to illustrate the variations discussed above. The device fabricated without the soaking step exhibits an extremely low leakage current density (<10−4 mA cm−2 under a small reverse bias of 0.1 V). When the soaking time was less than 12 s, the device exhibited a slight growth in the leakage current density. In this process, the soaking rarely enlarged the gaps between the perovskite grains, while the VOC of the devices slightly decreased. After 12 s of soaking, with the rapid enlargement of gaps, the dark current rapidly increased, while the JSC and VOC decreased by a large margin. This is in good agreement with the results of the SEM morphological study (Fig. 4a–d): a longer soaking time in the process generally increases the roughness, as an increasing number of gaps appear on the surface.

Note that no diffraction peak from PbI2 can be observed in the XRD pattern after 15 s of soaking (Fig. 4f). This means that residual MAI in the perovskite film has possibly a positive effect on the photoelectric properties of the final device. Under current solution engineering, residual MAI in the film is helpful to reduce the leakage current density and improve the photovoltaic performance. From Table 1, one can see that the excess of MAI can contribute to a maximal PCE enhancement up to 5.62% by using the optimal soaking time.
Similar conclusions, i.e., the excess of MAI is helpful to enhance the PCE, have also been discussed in Wang's works for CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells based on a one-step spin coating process.28 However, the conclusions in Chen's works are directly opposed to Wang's and our own, where they have shown that the presence of PbI2 in perovskite films improved carrier electric properties and furthermore enhanced the device performances.29 They determined that a suitable amount of PbI2 species in the CH3NH3PbI3 film can lead to improved carrier behavior possibly due to the reduced recombination in the grain boundaries (GBs).29 However, Chen's works were carried out based on a two-step process. Based on the process, perovskite films are flatter and more compact than those based on the one-step process. By thermal annealing, a compositional/structural conversion from CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2 occurred mostly at the GBs of the film without destroying its original crystalline state. Although partial MAI components will evaporate from the perovskite film to form some local PbI2 crystals during the annealing process, little changes can be found in other zones of the perovskite layer, where the film still kept compact and uniform. However, in Wang's and our studies, the crystallization behavior is totally different due to the adoption of a simpler one-step solution coating. For the coating process, the perovskite morphology is very sensitive to the composition variation of precursor solvents, which could be attributed to the difference in the crystallization rate between the low solubility PbI2 and the high solubility MAI. Then, both the roughness of films and the number of embrittlement cracks (i.e., separations occur along grain boundaries) will increase as the amount of MAI in the films decreases. The increase in the number of cracks on the film surface with the amount of MAI drop can clearly be seen in the SEM images of the perovskite film (see Fig. 4a–d). These cracks can cause more leakage currents and defects in the films. Under current solution engineering, residual MAI in the film is helpful to reduce the leakage current density and improve the photovoltaic performance. In brief, we considered that an excess of MAI was beneficial to enhance the PCE of perovskite solar cells for typical one-step coating technology.
As previously mentioned, it has been proved that the amount of MAI in the film has a critical effect on the device performance. Whether soaking with sec-butyl alcohol solvent could affect the content of MAI in the perovskite film has not been confirmed from the slight variations of the absorption spectra and the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f). Variations in the mixture solution composition have also been further researched, which could help clarify the effect of MAI. The PbI2:MAI molar ratios used in the mixture solution were 1:2.5, 1:2.2, 1:2, 1:1.8, and 1:1.5. At first, the devices were fabricated using the same soaking time. The photocurrent curves of the devices (Fig. 6a) reveal that, in the devices with a decreased MAI concentration, more perovskite was formed, causing larger JSC, while the VOC slightly decreased. Until the MAI concentration reached the value of 1.5 M, the device JSC and VOC decreased at the same time. Clearly, the results obtained using different PbI2:MAI molar ratios and different soaking times are very similar. In addition, considering that, to achieve the best performance, different molar ratios need different soaking times, we found the optimal soaking time for each molar ratio. The photocurrent curves of the devices with five different molar ratios are shown in Fig. 6b; all devices were fabricated by optimizing the soaking time. The photocurrent curves of the devices fabricated using different ratios are very similar, except some minor differences reported in Table 2.

It is noted that very similar research has previously been reported, where the effectiveness of an excess of MAI on the enhancement of PCE has also been proven based on a simple one-step spin coating method without any solvents used.28 In their work, the PbI2:MAI molar ratios have an obvious influence on the film morphology (i.e. the crack number). And the more excessive MAI, the flatter the film surface (or the less the cracks). However, we had achieved different conclusions because of using the various spin-coating processes, where a solvent engineering method based on sec-butyl alcohol was proposed in the present paper (see Fig. 1). First, benefiting from the faster crystallization by the sec-butyl alcohol assisted film growth, we obtained better outcomes for both the film morphology and photovoltaic properties than those given in ref. 28. Second, in this work, an excess of MAI was dissolved in the mixture solution merely to supplement the decrease of MAI in the washing and soaking step. Therefore, the photovoltaic properties were insensitive to the specific concentration variation of the excess of MAI in the mixture solution (see Fig. 6b), which is markedly different from that concluded in ref. 28. The huge difference between the two studies can be attributed to the present sec-butyl alcohol assisted solvent engineering method.
Furthermore, we also measured the photocurrent curves using a similar procedure shown in Fig. 5a, but used toluene and chlorobenzene as solvents in the soaking process (see Fig. S2†). The results indicate that a similar soaking process has no effects on the PCE by using these solvents. This is because by using both toluene and chlorobenzene as non-polar solvents it is very difficult to dissolve MAI, and thus the excess of MAI in the films cannot be removed. In contrast, sec-butyl alcohol could remove the excess of MAI because of its higher ability to dissolve macromolecular components. Similarly, we have also carried out experiments by using other alcoholic solvents, e.g., n-butyl alcohol, iso-butyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol. The corresponding photocurrent curves can be found in Fig. S3.† From the figure, one can see that most of the alcoholic solvents can be used in the soaking process to remove the excess of MAI. However, sec-butyl alcohol is still the most suitable solvent for the current application, which not only could effectively remove the excess of MAI, but also avoid deterioration of the quality of perovskite films, thus achieving the maximal PCE.
Note that all perovskite films in the previous experiments have a thickness less than 300 nm. The devices with different film thicknesses were also fabricated and measured. The corresponding photocurrent curves are shown in Fig. S4.† For a given film thickness, the optimal PCE can be achieved by optimizing the fabrication process shown in Fig. 1. Photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells based on five different thicknesses are summarized in Table S1.† The perovskite film with a thickness of 450 nm can contribute to a maximum PCE of ∼14.4%. Here, 450 nm-thick perovskite films were fabricated by increasing the PbI2 concentration to 1.5 M. Increasing the thickness of the film requires reducing the content of MAI to avoid an excessively prolonged soaking time. We tried several different PbI2:MAI molar ratios, but 2.25 M (1:1.5 molar ratio) MAI was eventually found to be superior to other ratios. Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic performance along with the SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 surface and the cross-sectional full cell. The plan-view SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3 film, obtained using an adjustment process, shows a uniform and pinhole-free surface (Fig. 7a); the cross-sectional SEM image of the full cell with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al configuration is shown in Fig. 6b. The best performing device, as shown in Fig. 7c, exhibited a JSC of 20.6 mA cm−2, FF of 71.0%, VOC of 0.99 V, and PCE of 14.4%. Fig. 7d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device. The calculated JSC from the EQE spectra is 19.7 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the J–V measurement except for a small difference resulting from the encapsulation degradation. The statistics of the FF, JSC, VOC, and PCE based on 40 devices are shown in Fig. 7e. An average JSC of 19.74 ± 0.56 mA cm−2, FF of 0.687 ± 0.018, VOC of 0.969 ± 0.016 V, and PCE of 13.11 ± 0.50% were obtained. Hence, sec-butyl alcohol assisted perovskite fabrication exhibits a small standard deviation of photovoltaic characteristics. The outstanding repeatability in this work is derived from the strict control on all process parameters. As an example of devices shown in Fig. 7, all process parameters are as follows: the mixture solution was spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 6000 rpm and after 12 s delay time, the wet film was washed with 500 μL of sec-butyl alcohol. After 30 s spin-coating stopped, 200 μL sec-butyl alcohol were dropped onto the perovskite film and 40 s soaking is an optimal time in this step. After the sec-butyl alcohol soaking step, the films were spun on the perovskite layer at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed in ambient air at 100 °C for 30 min. In the above process, the final photovoltaic properties are mostly attributed to the optimization and control of the soaking time for a given MAI amount and the dropped sec-butyl alcohol amount. Moreover, no obvious photocurrent hysteresis was observed by changing the scan direction in our devices, which exhibited a PCE of 14.4% in the forward scan and 14.2% in the backward scan; the small reduction resulted from the high humidity present in the test environment (nearly 60%).

Conclusions
We demonstrated that excess MAI has a positive effect on the photoelectric properties of perovskite devices. An abundance or shortage of MAI in the films results in the degradation of the photoelectric properties. sec-Butyl alcohol was proved to be a solvent not only suitable for the CH3NH3PbI3 fast crystallization deposition process, but also for adjusting the amount of MAI in CH3NH3PbI3 films. The application of these films in solar cell fabrication yielded an average PCE of 13.1 ± 0.5% and the highest PCE of 14.3%; in our devices, no hysteresis was observed by changing the scan direction. Based on our results, we believe that this method may provide a fresh and effective approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells.
