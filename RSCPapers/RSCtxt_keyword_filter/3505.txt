    , Accepted 2nd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractMinimizing the trade-off between JSC and VOC has been identified as a critical strategy for optimizing the device performance with the advance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, two regioisomerically brominated fused-ring electron acceptors, namely BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6, were synthesized and the effects of the bromination position on the basic optoelectronic properties, physiochemical properties, charge transport properties, BHJ morphologies, and the photovoltaic performance were investigated. It was found that BTPIC-2Br-6, which had one bromine substitution at the 6-position, showed a narrower absorption, upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels in comparison with BTPIC-2Br-5. Such a minute variation provides an opportunity for fine-tuning the VOC–JSC trade-off for a better solar cell. The results showed that the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device realized a very high PCE of over 15% because the higher JSC and FF compensated for the VOC decline. The detailed morphology study revealed that the BTPIC-2Br-6-based blend film had a better phase separation, which mainly resulted in a more balanced charge transport and weaker trap-assisted recombination in the device. The interaction parameter determination for the material combinations further manifested that BTPIC-2Br-6 tends to easily form an intermixed morphology, which established a material structure–morphology relationship. This study underlines the regioisomeric bromination effect of FREAs on the material optoelectronic properties and miscibility, thereby optimizing the photovoltaic efficiency.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as an alternative photovoltaic technology to utilize solar energy due to their advantages of lightweight, flexibility, low cost, and solution processability.1–5 In the past years, fullerene derivatives were the dominant acceptors of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, and the intense research efforts have boosted the PSCs based on a fullerene acceptor to realize power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11%.6–9 However, the recent discovery of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), for example, indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT),10,11 has brought about a new milestone growth in the efficiency of PSC, which outperformed the fullerene acceptor-based counterparts.12,13 This remarkable performance increase is generally attributed to the unique advantages of FREA, such as enhanced absorption in the visible and even near-infrared (NIR) regions, tunable energy levels, good device stability, and easy synthesis and purification.14–17
Since the first report of the high-performance electron acceptor ITIC,10 numerous diverse structural variants appeared and pulled up the efficiencies of PSCs over 17%.18–24 Some effective strategies were also developed, including the design of an electron-donating fused ring, end-capping groups (EGs), and side chains.25–29 Among them, the halogenation of end-capping groups of FREAs are gradually playing important roles in optimizing the photovoltaic performance by fine-tuning the basic optoelectronic properties, crystallization behavior, and morphologies.30–33 Typically, fluorine/chlorine substitution can narrow the absorption and downshift the energy levels of acceptor molecules due to the large electronegativity (or including the empty 3d orbital of chlorine atoms), and compaction of the intra-/intermolecular packing, leading to improved charge transport properties.34–37 Brominated EGs also exhibited similar capability to modulate the optical absorption and energy levels of FREAs,38,39 but have received less attention in comparison with fluorinated/chlorinated EGs. In addition, brominated EGs had some advantages such as simple synthesis, low cost, and easy to post-modification.40 Recently, Wang et al. discovered that introducing one bromine atom on the acceptor molecule, instead of dibromination, tends to have more suitable crystallization in the acceptor phase, resulting in better device efficiency.41 Li et al. also introduced the brominated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (BrIC) into the A–(D–A–D)–A type FREAs, which matched with polymer donor PTQ11 to realize the solar cells with over 16% efficiency.42 Despite this, it needs to be noted that these acceptor molecules with one bromine atom are in fact a mixture of three regioisomers. This is because BrIC has two isomers without thorough chemical separation, and then randomly appear in one acceptor molecule, thus leading to three isomeric molecules with an indefinite composition ratio. Actually, the isomeric bromination effect impedes us to investigate explicitly the structure–property relationship. Besides, the batch-to-batch variation might also bring about a certain deviation in the performance of PSCs. Recently, He et al. purified one BrIC isomer to prepare the structure-definite brominated acceptor molecule, ITIC-2Br-γ, which realized the better photovoltaic efficiency in comparison with the mixture counterpart.43 Regrettably, to the best of our knowledge, no reports were published about the other isomer-free BrIC and the relevant acceptor molecules. It is very probable that the regioisomeric bromination of acceptor molecules might have a delicate impact on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic properties for better solar cells.
On this basis, we attempted to synthesize two pure EG isomers, namely BrIC-5 and BrIC-6, where “5” or “6” denotes the substituted position of bromine atoms in the IUPAC method, and then prepared two isomer-free acceptor molecules, namely BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6. The results showed that BTPIC-2Br-6 had narrower absorption, upshifted HOMO, and downshifted LUMO energy levels in comparison with BTPIC-2Br-5. Such a minute variation provides an opportunity for fine-tuning the VOC–JSC trade-off for a better solar cell. As expected, the BTPIC-2B-6 based device realized a very high PCE of over 15% because the higher JSC and FF compensated for the VOC decline. The detailed morphology study demonstrated that the BTPIC-2Br-6-based blend film had a better phase separation, which mainly resulted in the more balanced charge transport and weaker trap-assisted recombination in the device. The interaction parameter determination for the material combinations further revealed that BTPIC-2Br-6 tends to easily form a more intermixed morphology, which established a material structure–morphology relationship. This study highlights the regioisomeric bromination effect of FREAs on the material optoelectronic properties and miscibility, thereby optimizing the photovoltaic efficiency.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of two isomeric acceptor molecules are shown in Scheme 1. The brominated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (BrIC) was prepared in analogy to a literature procedure and the isomer BrIC-5 was purified by recrystallizing from the chloroform solution of the mixture according to the published method.43,44 The remaining filtrate was purified via silica gel column chromatography to give the BrIC-6-rich component, and then it was further recrystallized from 1,2-dichloroethane to yield the pure product. Interestingly, we found that the two isomeric EGs had very different solubilities in organic solvents due to the diverse interactions (shown in Table S1†), which might deliver to the target acceptor molecules. Furthermore, via the simple Knoevenagel condensation, two pure target acceptors, BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6, can be obtained in a high yield. Their chemical structures were fully characterized via1H/13C-NMR and high-resolution MS (MALDI-TOF) (shown in Fig. S8–S13†). In fact, during the purification of two acceptor molecules by column chromatography, the majority of BTPIC-2Br-6 was tightly dragged in the column when it was eluted using dichloromethane (DCM). The residual product at the top of the column needs to be dissolved by heating and then it can be washed out in portions. On the contrary, that is not the case with BTPIC-2Br-5. The results indicated the poorer solubility of BTPIC-2Br-6 in DCM.45 Since the solubility is correlated with solubility parameter (δ) difference of solutes and solvent, it can be speculated that BTPIC-2Br-6 should have a different solubility parameter, which is farther from DCM at the axis of δ order compared with BTPIC-2Br-5, as shown in Fig. S1.† This also suggests that the small difference might affect the morphology of the blended film in the PSCs. In addition, the thermal properties of the two acceptor molecules were measured via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 2d. The results demonstrated that BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6 had good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) up to 353 °C and 347 °C, respectively, which are favorable for the fabrication of PSCs.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6 in diluted chloroform and as films are shown in Fig. 1a and b, and the optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The two acceptor molecules exhibited similar absorption profiles, with an absorption in the range of 300–800 nm and 300–950 nm in chloroform and solid states, respectively. However, BTPIC-2Br-6 displayed a slightly bathochromic absorption peak in solution in comparison with BTPIC-2Br-5 and the redshift was enlarged to 9 nm in solid states. This indicated that introducing bromine at the 6-position will affect intramolecular and inter-molecular interactions. They also showed very high and comparable absorption coefficients at their peaks, which will be helpful to harvest sunlight in PSCs. The optical bandgap of BTPIC-2Br-6 was slightly smaller than that of BTPIC-2Br-5. This contributes to fine-tuning the trade-off between short-circuit current (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) to improve the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells. The electrochemical properties were studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. 1c). The results are listed in Table 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of BTPIC-2Br-6 slightly upshifted and downshifted compared with those of BTPIC-2Br-5, respectively, which are in line with the trend of the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels (shown in Table S2†).

To comparatively evaluate the isomer effect of brominated acceptor molecules on the photovoltaic performance, we selected the widely used PM6 as the polymer donor for the solar cell fabrication. The device configuration of the solar cells is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN–Br)/Ag (Fig. 2a). The device optimization, including donor:acceptor (D/A) weight ratio, additive ratio, thermal annealing, and layer thickness, was implemented, and the results are summarized in Tables S3–S6.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the optimized solar cells are displayed in Fig. 2c and d, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device based on the isomer BTPIC-2Br-5 showed the maximum PCE of 13.96% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 22.91 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 67.74%. On the other hand, the BTPIC-2Br-6-based solar cell delivered an excellent PCE of 15.03% with a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 24.07 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.43%. Clearly, the VOC value of the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device is lower than that of BTPIC-2Br-5, but the higher JSC and FF counteracted the VOC decline in comparison with BTPIC-2Br-5, thus leading to a more decent device performance. It can be speculated that the lower VOC of the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device was probably related to slightly lower-lying LUMO energy levels of the acceptor molecule (Fig. 2b).46 From the EQE curves, we can observe that the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device exhibited a broader and stronger photoresponse at 800–950 nm, which is consistent with the absorption of blend films (shown in Fig. S2†). This also accounted for the higher JSC in the relevant device. These results demonstrated that the introduced bromine atom at a different position can delicately adjust the absorption and energy levels, thus fine-tuning the JSC–VOC trade-off for better solar cells.

To explicitly understand charge recombination properties in the solar cells, JSCversus the light intensity (Plight) of BTPIC-2Br-5- and BTPIC-2Br-6-based devices were investigated, which is shown in Fig. 3a. The relationship between JSC and Plight is defined as the equation JSC ∝ Plightα.47 When the exponential factor (α) is close to 1, the charge recombination in the device is negligible. It was shown that the devices based on the two isomeric acceptors had an equally high α value of 0.98. This revealed that the bimolecular recombination was very weak in the solar cells. Besides, the relationship between VOC and Plight was also measured to investigate the trap-assisted recombination losses, as shown in Fig. 3b. In general, the slope is equal to 1.0kT/q when the trap-assisted recombination losses are negligible in devices.48 The slopes for VOC as a function of Plight in BTPIC-2Br-5- and BTPIC-2Br-6-based devices are 1.15kT/q and 1.11kT/q, respectively. The smaller slope in the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device means the weaker trap-assisted recombination, which will reduce the photocurrent loss in the device.

The space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was performed to evaluate the charge transport properties in the solar cells, which is shown in Fig. 4. The data are summarized in Table 2. The hole and electron mobilities in the BTPIC-2Br-6-based blend film were calculated to be 2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which has same order of magnitude as the values of the blend film based on BTPIC-2Br-5 (1.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). However, the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device had the μh/μe value close to 1 in comparison with the BTPIC-2Br-5-based device (μh/μe = 0.87). This suggests that the balanced hole/electron mobility can more effectively suppress charge recombination in the BTPIC-2Br-6-based device, leading to the higher JSC and FF, which is in line with the device results.

In order to investigate the correlation between blend morphologies and the device performance based on BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted. As is depicted in Fig. 5, similar smooth surfaces can be observed in both blend films with the root-mean-square roughness of 1.52 nm for BTPIC-2Br-5 and 1.75 nm for BTPIC-2Br-6, respectively. In the TEM image, the BTPIC-2Br-5-based blend film exhibited densely distributed and dark phase separation with large size, which might induce an unfavorable charge recombination in the device. Conversely, the BTPIC-2Br-5-based blend film was shown to be uniform and has stripe-like nanofibers. Such a morphology was beneficial for the efficient charge separation and transport, thus resulting in the device efficiency improvement. In addition, the 2D grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also used to evaluate the molecular packing and orientation in the BTPIC-2Br-5- and BTPIC-2Br-6-based devices. The relevant 2D WAXS images and integrated scattering profiles are shown in Fig. 6. In the pristine films, the pronounced scattering peaks at 1.75 and 1.77 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction were the results of the π–π molecular stacking for BTPIC-2Br-5 and BTPIC-2Br-6, respectively, representing their preferable face-on orientation. The stronger scattering intensity and smaller peak position in the BTPIC-2Br-5-based film indicate a larger crystal size but a bit looser π–π molecular stacking. In spite of such a difference, their crystallization behaviors changed when both acceptor molecules were blended with polymer donor PM6. The scattering signal in the out-of-plane direction for the BTPIC-2Br-6-based blend film was very close to that of BTPIC-2Br-5. The inherited face-on molecular orientations can be conductive to realize better charge transport properties in the relevant devices.

It is well-known that the BHJ morphologies in devices are correlated with the interaction parameters (χ) of the polymer donor and acceptor from the thermodynamic point of view.49,50 To clearly understand the impact of miscibilities of the acceptor molecules on the morphology formation of blend films, we measured the interaction parameters between PM6 and two acceptor molecules. For the binary polymer donor–acceptor molecule combination, the interaction parameter can be calculated by the equation:51  where δD/δA denotes the solubility parameter of the polymer donor or acceptor, respectively, V0 is the geometric mean of the polymer segment molar volume, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. χ reflects the binary miscibility, and the smaller χ value means better miscibility. Despite that we have qualitatively judged the order of the solubility parameter of the two isomeric acceptor molecules from the different solubility in DCM, that is not enough to calculate χ. Here, we have further calculated the solubility parameter from the equation:  where γ is the surface energy of the material, K is the proportionality constant (K = 116 × 103 m−1/2).52–54 The surface energy of PM6, BTPIC-2Br-5, and BTPIC-2Br-6 are evaluated from contact angle measurements (Fig. S3†). The relevant parameters for the materials are summarized in Tables 3 and S7.† The results showed that the χ value in PM6:BTPIC-2Br-6 blend was smaller than that of PM6:BTPIC-2Br-5, indicating the improved miscibility, which resulted in the more intermixed morphology in the blend film. Inversely, the higher χ value was consistent with the improper phase separation in the PM6:BTPIC-2Br-6 combination. Here, it should be noted that numerous other factors, such as additive, thermal annealing, and crystallization, will impact the BHJ phase separation equilibrium state. The comparative study about the solubility parameter just attempts to give a relatively reasonable explanation to the morphology characteristics from the viewpoint of material miscibility.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two regioisomeric fused-ring electron acceptors by introducing one bromine atom at the 5 or 6 position of the end-capping group, and realized a high-performance PSC with PCE over 15%. The results revealed that BTPIC-2Br-6, which had one bromine substitution at the 6-position, showed the narrower absorption, upshifted HOMO, and downshifted LUMO energy levels in comparison with BTPIC-2Br-5. Such a minute variation provides a chance for fine-tuning the VOC–JSC trade-off for better solar cells. Besides, the smaller interaction parameter in the PM6:BTPIC-2Br-6 combination was beneficial to the formation of the better phase separation, which mainly resulted in the more balanced charge transport and weaker trap-assisted recombination in the device. It is expected that better solar cells based on the isomer-free acceptor molecule BTPIC-2Br-6 can achieve over 16% efficiency (or even higher) when paired with a suitable polymer donor (such as PTQ 11). Our work highlights the bromination regioisomeric effect of FREAs on the material optoelectronic properties, miscibility, morphology, and photovoltaic performance, which provides a unique insight into the design of highly efficient electron acceptors. This study will also give a certain reference and guidance to the subsequent studies based on the better brominated FREAs and polymer acceptors through post-polymerization.
