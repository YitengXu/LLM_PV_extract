    , Accepted 13th October 2020First published on 14th October 2020AbstractThe control of intramolecular charge transfer between the fused-ring core and terminal unit by selecting a suitable π-bridge has a strong impact on the photovoltaic performance of A–π–D–π–A type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Here, we used a strong electron-deficient unit, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), as a π-bridge to synthesize a new NFA, TPD8, which exhibited a low optical bandgap of 1.46 eV. Organic solar cells based on PTQ10:TPD8 gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.4% with a relatively high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V and low energy loss of 0.55 eV. This work proved that electron-deficient units were also a good choice for the construction of high-performance A–π–D–π–A type NFAs.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are regarded as one of the promising renewable and clean energy conversion devices for converting solar energy to electricity due to their unique merits of lightweight, flexibility, convenient roll-to-roll printing and low-cost manufacturing.1–4 In recent years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) due to their strong absorption in the visible region, easily tunable energy levels, efficient exciton dissociation and low voltage loss.5 Recently, NFAs have promoted the rapid progress of OSCs and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art OSCs has surpassed 18%.6–9
Besides the classic A–D–A type backbone, insertion of π-bridges between the middle D unit and the terminal A segments to construct an A–π–D–π–A skeleton is also an efficient way to finetune the properties of NFAs.10–12 Generally, introducing π-bridges can extend the conjugation length, adjust the intramolecular charge-transfer properties, and tune the absorption, energy levels and crystallinity. Historically, indacenodithiophene (IDT) and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) are the most classic middle D unit and terminal A segments in the design of A–π–D–π–A type NFAs (Scheme 1). In 2015, Zhan and co-workers reported a novel acceptor DC-IDT2T with the thiophene ring as a π-bridge. The photovoltaic device based on PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2T delivered a moderate PCE of 3.93%.13 After introducing a 2-ethylhexyl on the bridged thiophene, a new NFA named IEIC was synthesized. IEIC showed an improved solubility, better morphology for the blend film and a higher PCE of 6.31%.14 Subsequently, by replacing the alkyl side chains with alkoxy side chains, Hou and co-workers designed and synthesized a low bandgap acceptor named as IEICO. With respect to IEIC, IEICO exhibited a very narrow optical bandgap of 1.34 eV with a high-lying LUMO level of −3.95 eV. In addition, IEICO showed an improved rigidity of the backbone and charge mobility than IEIC. The IEICO-based fullerene-free OSCs showed a maximum PCE of 8.4%.15 By inserting a 3-carboxylated thiophene as the bridge, the acceptor IDT-3MT was developed by Cho's group, which exhibited relatively low-lying energy levels and a red-shifted absorption spectrum. The OSCs based on the PBDBT:IDT-3MT blend film exhibited a higher PCE of 8.4%.16 In addition, furan, selenophene, thiazole, 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene (EDOT), thiophene–vinylene–thiophene (TVT), ethylene, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and bis(alkoxy)-substituted benzene have also been utilized as π bridges in the design of NFAs with an IC–π–IDT–π–IC backbone, and these molecules demonstrated PCEs in the range of 3.08–9.60%,17–24 as shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  The reported A–π–D–π–A type small molecules with IDT as the core and IC as the end-capped unit. 
As mentioned above, almost all the reported π-bridge modifications in IC–π–IDT–π–IC type NFAs are based on the electron-donating units. Unfortunately, for this system, the effect of the electron-withdrawing π-bridges on the photovoltaic performance is rarely reported. Recently, Peng's group reported a new 3D NFA, TrBTIC, which flanks an electron-rich truxene core with benzothiadiazole (BT) combined IC as the end groups. Due to the strong withdrawing ability of BT and IC, a high PCE of 8.25%25 was achieved, which is a new record for poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based devices. In addition, BT,26–28 benzotriazole (BTA)10,29–32 and quinoxaline (Qx)33,34 have been widely used as the A1 unit to construct A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs, where rhodanine (R) and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN) are used as terminal A2 units. Therefore, we firmly believed that introducing a strong electron-withdrawing unit as a π-bridge into the IC–π–IDT–π–IC type NFAs can improve their photovoltaic performance.
Among the various electron-withdrawing building blocks, the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit has a relatively strong electron-withdrawing property due to the imide at the 3,4-positions of TPD. The intramolecular noncovalent S⋯O interactions between the oxygen atoms on TPD and the sulfur or hydrogen atoms of adjacent thiophene rings will improve the molecular planarity and promote the ICT effect.35–37 In addition, by introducing different alkyl chains on the imide of the TPD unit, the solubilities of TPD-based small molecule acceptors can be easily modulated. Thus, in this work, we introduced this strong electron-withdrawing unit of TPD as a π-bridge to design a new small molecular acceptor, TPD8. The chemical structure of TPD8 is shown in Fig. 1a. This acceptor exhibits intense absorption in the region of 600–900 nm with a low optical band gap  of 1.46 eV. PTQ1038 was employed as the electron donor material for the fabrication of solar cells, which has complementary absorption and matched energy levels with the acceptor material. The optimized OSCs based on PTQ10:TPD8 showed a high PCE of 10.40% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 18.20 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 62.81%, which are higher than those of the reported NFAs with an electron-donating unit as a π-bridge. The results indicate that the insertion of electron-withdrawing units as π-bridges between the D core and A terminal is an effective strategy to enhance their photovoltaic performance.

TPD8 was synthesized in two-steps, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The 1-formyl-3-bromo-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione was prepared as previously reported.36 The corresponding intermediates and TPD8 were fully characterized using 1H-NMR and MALDI–TOF MS (Fig. S1, ESI†), as shown in the ESI.†TPD8 shows excellent thermal stability (up to 364 °C with 5% weight loss) (Fig. S2, ESI†) and is readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) or o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).
The normalized absorption spectra of TPD8 in chloroform solution and film are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption spectrum of TPD8 solution exhibits a broad absorption band in the range of 500 to 800 nm and a maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.6 × 105 L·mol−1·cm−1 at 702 nm, whereas the TPD8 film displays a red-shifted absorption band ranging from 550 to 850 nm and a maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 8 × 104 cm−1 at 740 nm. The characteristic peak located at ≈480 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of TPD8, while the other one around 700–800 nm corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the core unit and terminal units. Compared with the absorption in solution, the TPD8 film shows a red-shifted absorption of 50 nm and a strong shoulder peak, implying the existence of molecular aggregation. TPD8 has a narrow optical bandgap of 1.46 eV, calculated from the absorption edge (850 nm).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to ascertain the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of TPD8. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the onset oxidation potentials were used to calculate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) were determined according to ELUMO = EHOMO +  eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.60 and −4.10 eV for TPD8, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTQ10 are taken from the literature.38 The HOMO offset between PTQ10 and TPD8 is as small as 0.06 eV, which may bring a small energy loss and the highest VOC.39,40
The photovoltaic properties of TPD8 were investigated through a traditional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. We chose PTQ10 as the donor polymer to optimize the photovoltaic performance. The donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios (w/w) in the active layer were optimized in the range from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5. As we can see from Table S1 (ESI†), the optimum D/A weight ratio was found to be 1:1.5 with a PCE of 7.21%. Then the effects of thermal annealing (TA) on the device performance were investigated. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), when the TA temperature increased from 100 to 180 °C, the PCE was improved from 7.21% to 9.68%; however, with a further increase from 180 to 210 °C, the PCE decreased to 8.01%. In addition, when 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was tested as a solvent additive, the PCEs slightly increased. Finally, PTQ10:TPD8 gave the highest PCE of 10.40% (VOC = 0.91 V, JSC = 18.20 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.63) with an average value of 10.25%, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The detailed optimal conditions include: a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5, thermal annealing at 180 °C, chloroform as the solvent with 1% DIO as a solvent additive. The thickness of the active layer is 105 nm, measured using a profilometer. We believe that the photovoltaic performance of TPD8 could be further improved by pairing with other promising p-type polymers.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device is shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE curve of the device covers a broad response of 300–850 nm, which is in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 1a. The maximum EQE value of the device is 70% at 600 nm. The JSC calculated from the integration of the EQE spectrum using the AM 1.5G reference spectrum is 17.4 mA cm2, which matches well with the value obtained from J–V measurements. In our previous work,36 we speculated that when adopting strong electron-deficient units such as IC or IC-4F as the terminal A2, the JSC of TPD-based NFAs can be largely improved. In this work, the JSC of TPD8 (18.2 mA cm−2) is much higher than TPD3 (12.69 mA cm−2), which uses RCN as the terminal unit.

To get deeper insights into the molecular geometry and molecular frontier orbitals of TPD8, theoretical calculations were conducted via density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set) (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The electron density of the HOMO is mainly delocalized on the central unit and TPD unit, while the electron density of the LUMO level is mainly populated within the end-capped groups and TPD segment. TPD8 shows small dihedral angles of 0.6° and 7.5° between the IDT–TPD and TPD–IC parts, which indicates the high planarity of the molecule. Then, the intramolecular O⋯S distance between IDT and TPD is calculated to be 2.97 Å, which is obviously smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur and oxygen (3.32 Å), which indicates a relatively strong O⋯S noncovalent interaction. Moreover, we also performed theoretical calculations on the dimer molecule model using DFT at the WB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level to evaluate the intermolecular interactions and the intermolecular binding energies. It is widely accepted that in A–D–A type NFAs, electron transport depends on the intermolecular π–π stacking and aggregation of the A units with the adjoining molecules A part.41,42 Then we set the original dimer molecule model with IC–IC type intermolecular interaction to optimize the lowest energy state models. The results show that the lowest energy state model was IC–TPD type intermolecular interaction (as shown in Fig. 3b). The results indicate that the intermolecular interaction between the IC and TPD is much stronger than traditional IC–IC interaction in the A–D–A type SMAs.

To understand the charge carrier transport ability of the TPD8-based devices, hole and electron mobilities of blend films were estimated using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/TiOx/active layer/Al were employed to investigate the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the determined hole and electron mobilities of the TPD8-based device were 1.16 × 10−5 and 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The low hole mobility and the high μe/μh (11.7) value increase the charge recombination, decrease JSC and result in a low FF of 62%. To get high FF and JSC, further study should also focus on finding suitable polymer donors to match with TPD8 to get more balanced μe/μh.

To investigate the influence of DIO treatment on the film morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. The morphology of the PTQ10:TPD8 film shows the root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.76 nm, which is smoother than that of the blend film (3.09 nm) with 1% DIO treatment, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The higher RMS of the 1% DIO treatment device would be beneficial to construct bi-continuous interpenetrating networks. It is essential to generate efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and yield relatively high JSC and FF values.
In summary, a new low bandgap A–π–D–π–A type NFA TPD8 was designed and synthesized by introducing TPD as a π-bridge between the IDT core and the IC end-capping group. OSCs based on PTQ10:TPD8 achieved a high PCE of 10.40% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 18.20 mA cm−2 and a relatively high FF of 62.81%. The high performance was attributed to their strong light-harvesting capability and high planar conformation due to noncovalent conformational locks36 between the TPD and central core of IDT. The PCE of a TPD8-based device is higher than that of the reported IC–π–IDT–π–IC type acceptors with electron-rich π-bridges. These results have illustrated that introducing TPD units into IDT-core type NFAs can achieve high performance OSCs.
