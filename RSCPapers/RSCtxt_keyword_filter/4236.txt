It is found that the solution component plays an important role in the morphology and the crystallinity of the active layers as confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), resulting in obviously difference in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices. The crystallinity of ITIC acceptor in the active layer is further found to correlate with the energy of charge transfer states (CTS) of the devices according to the Electroluminescence (EL) Spectrometry measurements. The CTS energy shift caused by the crystallinity variation is directly related to the enhanced VOC in this study.
Introduction
In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of single-junction organic bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has increased rapidly to values exceeding 16%.1 However, one of the major limitations to the performance of OSCs to date is the open-circuit voltage (VOC), which is only less than half of the incident photo energy.2 Few OSCs with PCE over 10% can afford VOC lager than 1.10 V and VLOSS less than 0.50 V.3 As the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) approaching 100%4,5 and the FF exceeding 80%,6 it is in urge need to study the mechanism of VOC to optimize the device performance.7,8 In the case of polymer: PCBM based OSCs, the empirical relationship of VOC: eVOC = Eg − 0.3 eV was given by Scharber et al. after studying a wide range of materials combination.9 Here, Eg is the donor–acceptor energy gap defined by the difference between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, and e is the elementary charge. However, the empirical relationship fails in fully understanding the VOC changes by using different ration PCBM or different active layer morphology.10 It is commonly believed that there are many other factors affecting the open-circuit voltage of the device besides the energy gap, such as charge transfer states, donor–acceptor interface, microstructure, energetic disorder, carrier density and so on.11–17 The charge transfer (CT) complexes were found to play a crucial role in the VOC.18–21 CT states are molecular species with electrons located at the acceptor phase near the interface and holes leaving behind the donor phase, which is the vital intermediate step between singlet exciton dissociation and free charge generation.11 The energy of CT states was related to their electroluminescence emission peak.22,23 The energy of the CT state (ECT) has been widely observed to correlate well with VOC,18 determining the maximum value of the open circuit voltage.11 The CT energy was also found to be influenced by the intermolecular distance, molecules orientation and the blend film microstructure and so on.24–27 On the other hand, many studies have shown that the microstructure of active layer can be optimized by multifarious morphology control ways in organic solar cells, such as using additives,28–31 choosing different host solvents,32–36 thermal annealing,37–40 solvent annealing,41–43 and so on. Under this circumstance, the VOC of the devices was found to be affected to some extent by the morphology.44–47 However, in-detail explanations to the change of the open-circuit voltage by various morphology control ways were inadequate in these works. Moreover, it was found that the crystallinity of the widely used high efficiency non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC, IDIC and so on, was more sensitive to the solution properties.48,49 But surprisingly, few of these studies had devoted enough attention to the influence of the active layers morphology on the VOC of the devices, though obvious variations of VOC with the active layer morphology were indeed observed in these systems.50–52 It is therefore an important issue but still a significant challenge to understand the influence of film morphology on VOC of the devices, especially in non-fullerene acceptor systems.
In this work, we study the origin of the VOC variation by changing the components of solutions in non-fullerene acceptor based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, with special focus on the film morphology and the crystallinity of the non-fullerene acceptor phase. The well-known donor material PTB7-Th (also named as PCE10, Fig. 1a) and the well-studied non-fullerene acceptor ITIC (Fig. 1b) were used. As can be seen from Table 1, the incorporation of additive DIO in the high boiling point solvent chlorobenzene (CB) causes no obvious effect on the VOC of the devices. However, the VOC is increased from 0.71 V to 0.84 V after 0.6 v% DIO is added into the low boiling point chloroform (CF). It is noteworthy that, the influence effect of the additives in CF on the VOC in the non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs is contrary to that in fullerene based OSCs, in which the VOC usually decreased after incorporation of additives.53,54 Therefore, understanding the effects of the solution property on the VOC is significant for optimizing the device performance. To investigate the mechanism, several analytical techniques are carried out. AFM is conducted to study the film morphology of the active layers. GIWAXS is used to analyse the crystallinity of the non-fullerene acceptor phase. The Electroluminescence (EL) Spectrometry is carried out to identify the energy level change of the device by different solution combinations.

Experimental section
Materials and solution preparation
The sol–gel ZnO precursor solution was prepared by the conventional sol–gel method as reported elsewhere.55–57 PTB7-Th and ITIC were purchased from 1-Materials, Canada, and Solarmer Incorporation, USA, respectively. The solvent of CB, CF and DIO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with purity greater than 99%. A 20.7 mg mL−1 and 18.4 mg mL−1 PTB7-Th: ITIC solutions were prepared with a weight ratio of 1:1.3(w/w) in CB and CF, respectively. Then the solutions were heated and stirred overnight on a 50 degree heating table. And 0.6 v% DIO as additive was added into dissolved solutions half an hour before spinning coating active layer.
Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass was cleaned with detergent, deionized water and isopropanol in order under sonication for 30 mins each and dried at 70 degree in a baking oven overnight. The ZnO layer was prepared by spin-coating the sol–gel ZnO precursor solution onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 2600 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 200 degree for 1 hour in air. The devices were fabricated on the pre-clean prepatterned ZnO/ITO/glass substrates by spin-casting the solutions in the nitrogen atmosphere glove boxes with a thickness of 120 nm. Then transfer the film to the vacuum unit for an hour. The top electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of a 8 nm thick molybdenum oxide (MOO3) interlayer followed with a 100 nm thick Ag top electrode in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of around 3 × 10−4 Pa.
Device measurement and characterization
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristic was measured using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under an AM 1.5G simulated sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated by a silicon reference diode. Typical cells have devices area of 16 mm2, defined by a metal mask with aperture aligned with the device area. The Electroluminescence (EL) spectrometry of the solar cells was determined by measuring the emitted photons of devices in all directions through an integrated sphere by using a calibrated spectrometer (QE Pro, Ocean Optics), under a constant current density provided by a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering(GIWAXS) measurements were performed with a manufacture from Xenocs, France. Samples were prepared on Si substrates using identical blend solutions as those used in devices. The X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.2 degree. The scattered X-rays were detected using a Dectris Pilatus3R 1 M photon counting detector. The atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Digital Instrumental Multimode Nanoscope IIIa in the tapping mode.
Results and discussion
To investigate the relationship between the blend microstructure and the VOC, we induced different active layer morphologies of PTB7-Th: ITIC based OSCs by using solvents with different features. Two host solvents are used: the low boiling point solvent CF and the high boiling point solvent CB. Moreover, in order to optimize active layer morphology, a small doping content of 0.6 v% DIO is added into corresponding two host solvents. The energy level diagrams of PTB7-Th and ITIC are shown in Fig. 1c. The inverted device configuration is chosen with a structure of: ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th: ITIC/MOO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1d. The photovoltaic parameters are as summarized in Table 1 and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of OSCs are as shown in Fig. 2a. The device shows a highest PCE of 3.19% with the low boiling point solvent CF. The PCE is increased from 3.19% to 5.81% when the host solvent is doped with 0.6 v% DIO. When instead the high boiling point solvent of CB is used as solvent, a best PCE of 7.92% is achieved with 0.6 v% DIO, which is one of the highest efficiency for the PTB7-Th: ITIC system in the published literatures to our knowledge. In this case, all the three parameters (VOC, JSC, FF) show no obvious difference with the additive as can be seen from Table 1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs with different solvent strategies were consistent with the JSC and PCE as shown in Fig. 2b. And the calculated JSC from EQE values is consistent with that derived from photovoltaic performance.

The improved performance of the devices fabricated with 0.6 v% DIO doped CF solvent is supposed to origin from the optimized active layer morphology, which usually results in the enhanced charge transportation,58–60 as indicated by the improved JSC and FF. The DIO additive in CF can make a great difference in the active layer morphology, and subsequently optimizing the charge transportation properties of PTB7-Th: ITIC base devices according to enhanced carrier mobilities, as is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It should be pointed out that similar improvement in devices performance by doping DIO to PTB7:PCBM blend has also been previously found elsewhere.61 As can be seen in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†), the carriers life time of the devices slightly decreased with DIO in CF as revealed by the Transient Photovoltage (TPV) study. Therefore, the possibility that the different charge transportation affects the VOC in this system can be ruled out. Because, in principle, a decreased VOC should be expected as a result of the improved charge transportation and the decreased carriers life time, owing to the lower quasi-Fermi levels for both carriers due to the depleted steady carriers density, as reported in the polymer:PCBM system.52,62–64 However, contrary to the former works mentioned above, the VOC of PTB7-Th: ITIC base devices is improved by 18% after adding DIO to CF solvent herein, though the charge transportation property has been indeed enhanced and the carriers life time has been reduced according to the charge transportation studies. It is therefore important to elucidate the origin of this interesting result as will be described below.
To study the morphology difference caused by the additive DIO in different solvents, we carried out the atomic force microscope (AFM) with the films fabricated by different solution combinations. As shown in Fig. 3, a significant difference in morphology is observed for the films deposited from different solvents. When using CB as solvent, the roughness of the active layer shows little difference without DIO (1.62 nm) and with DIO (1.64 nm), corresponding to the small difference in JSC and FF in the devices. When instead using CF as solvent, the surface morphology of the film formed with DIO is rougher for than that formed with pure CF (roughness changed from 1.22 to 1.57 nm). It is very plausible that larger phase segregation emerges by incorporating DIO. A high degree of phase segregation between PTB7-Th and ITIC can provide more favorable D:A interfaces for charge dissociation and carrier transportation in the device, resulting in the improved device performance.

To gain more insight into the microstructure of the active layers, we further conducted the grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 4 and 5. Stronger scattering peaks from the blend films are obviously observed in the out-of-plane direction after doping DIO in the CF solvent than that in pure CF solvent, indicating a stronger preference for the face-on orientation in the blend films. Predominantly face-on ordering is commonly correlated with higher device performance.66 The carries transportation can be improved in the vertical direction and a larger absorption strength can be also expected when the thin films comprise a face-on orientation.65 In the case of CB solvents, no obvious difference is observed. This again is consistent with the results from the devices performance and the AFM study above.

 Fig. 5  The line cut profiles of the GIWAXS 2D patterns. The solid lines represent out-of-plane direction and the dotted lines represent in-plane direction. 
To learn more details about the crystallinity of the film, the corresponding GIWAXS out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cuts of the polymer: ITIC blends with different solvent strategies are shown in Fig. 5. A strong diffraction peak at 0.5 Å−1 arises in the out-of-plane direction, which is supposed to come from the ITIC packing structure.67 The more pronounced peaks at 0.5 Å−1 indicates that the crystallinity of ITIC is enhanced in the active layer formed by DIO containing solution. The diffraction peaks located between 1.4 Å−1 and 2.0 Å−1 should be contributed by the π–π stacking from both PTB7-Th and ITIC, which is consistent with the previous report.68 Notably, although no direct relation between active layer morphology and the VOC can be identified at this point, a clear trend of between the VOC and the crystallinity prevails. The low crystallization film leads to a low open-circuit voltage, while the higher crystallization film results in an enhanced open circuit voltage.
To further understand the role of the film crystallinity on the open circuit voltage, we use Electroluminescence (EL) Spectrometry to study the energy of CTSs of the devices. The EL spectra of the devices with different solvent strategies are shown in Fig. 6. The positions of emission peaks of CT states vary with different solvents, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3 (ESI†). The ECT of the devices fabricated from CB solvent either with DIO or without DIO remains almost the same at around 1.45 eV, which is consistent with the similar VOC in the devices. However, the ECT is increased from 1.35 eV to 1.46 eV after doping 0.6 v% DIO into the CF host solvent as estimated from the EL spectra, which is in good accordance with the enhanced VOC of the devices (0.71 V to 0.84 V). This can be attributed to the increased population of the higher energy states due to the reduced energetic disorder by the increased crystallinity in the active layer with DIO.10,22

Conclusions
In summary, several analytical techniques (AFM, GIWAXS, EL) are carried out towards a better understanding to the influence of the film morphology on the charge transportation and the VOC of PTB7-Th: ITIC organic solar cells. For active layers prepared by pure CF as solvent, the films show a smoother morphology and less crystallize in the acceptor domains, while the films come out rougher and the crystallinity of the acceptor in the blend film increased in the films that formed by DIO doped CF solvent. It is this feature thus affects charge transportation of the devices, resulting in a higher JSC and FF. A clear trend of between the VOC and the crystallinity of the film also prevails according to the morphology and EL study. This can be attributed to the adjustable energy levels of the CT states through tuning the crystallinity of the active layers as confirmed by EL measurement. It is in this work hence apparent that the crystallinity of the active layer can affect the VOC of the devices through the energy of the CT states in non-fullerene organic solar cells.
