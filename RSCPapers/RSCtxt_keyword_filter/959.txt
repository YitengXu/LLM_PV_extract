    , Accepted 21st April 2015First published on 29th April 2015AbstractNovel star-shaped hole transporting materials (HTMs) with a bis-dimethylfluorenylamino moiety have been synthesized and evaluated for high performance perovskite solar cell applications. Maximum power conversion efficiency of 14.21% has been achieved by using the HTM with a fused TPA core and the long-term stability was also shown to be comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD.
Recently, organometal halide perovskite solar cells have received great attention due to their outstanding merits such as high efficiency, low cost and so on.1 The organometal halide perovskites (e.g. (RNH3)PbX3 (R = alkyl; X = Cl, Br, or I)) have special features such as direct band gap and strong light harvesting and are therefore considered as efficient light absorbers and electron–hole transporters for organic–inorganic hybrid thin-film photovoltaic devices.2 In the perovskite solar cells, hole transporting materials (HTMs) are some of the most important components dominating the photovoltaic characteristics. The development of cost-effective HTMs with both high efficiency and long stability is very essential. To date, solid-state p-type hole conductors, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),3 have been widely utilized for high performance perovskite solar cells that exhibit efficiencies surpassing 15%. Unfortunately, however, the high synthetic cost of spiro-OMeTAD may be a major obstacle to commercialize the perovskite solar cells. Various types of small molecular and polymeric HTMs have also been intensively developed and reported as potential alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD.4,5 The development of small molecule HTMs remains an attractive target because they are quite cheap and easy to purify compared to the spiro-OMeTAD. Recently, impressive photovoltaic performance has been obtained using small molecule HTMs such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-,5 pyrene-,6 linear π-conjugated-,7 butadiene-,8spiro-OMeTAD derivative-,9 carbazole derivative-,10 tetrahiafulvalene-,11 tetraphenyl- benzidine-,12 and oligothiophene derivative-13 based ones having efficiencies in the range of 11–15%. Recently, we have reported star-shaped triphenylamine based HTMs, which exhibit high energy conversion efficiency reaching 14%.14 Nevertheless, many small molecule HTMs often have low conversion efficiency and low operation stability compared to spiro-OMeTAD due to the formation of aggregates on the perovskite surface and the formation of unstable radical species, respectively. To attenuate these two properties, we have designed the novel small molecule HTMs, DMFA-FA and DMFA-TPA, that have a bis-dimethylfluorenyl amino moiety.15 The bis-dimethylfluorenyl moiety was introduced to prevent aggregation via molecular stacking by the bulky nonplanar structure and to ensure greater resistance to degradation due to the capability to form stable amorphous glasses with high glass-transition temperature16 when exposed to light.
Herein, we report two new hole transporting materials with peripheral bis-dimethylfluorenyl moiety. The molecular structures of the HTMs are shown in Fig. 1. The detailed methods and scheme (Fig. S1) for the material synthesis are also provided in the ESI.†

The UV-vis spectra of the two HTMs recorded in chlorobenzene are displayed in the inset of Fig. 2(a). As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), the UV-vis light absorption peaks of DMFA-FA and DMFA-TPA were observed at 377 nm and 371 nm, respectively. Consequently, the λabs of DMFA-FA was shown to be red-shifted by about 6 nm in contrast to that of DMFA-TPA. This bathochromic shift was attributed to the more planar configuration of DMFA-FA compared with that of DMFA-TPA. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum of DMFA-FA shows maximum emission at 434 nm and a smaller Stoke's shift (57 nm) compared with that of DMFA-TPA (59 nm), indicating the relatively small structural change in the excited state of DMFA-FA with a fused triphenylamine core.

Fig. 2(a) also exhibits the absorption spectra of the perovskite-coated mesoporous TiO2 films with the two HTMs. Experimental details of the fabrication and characterization of the photoelectrodes and perovskite solar cells are described in the ESI.†
The cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the prepared perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig. 2(b), exhibiting a well-defined hybrid structure with clear interfaces. The thickness of the TiO2 film incorporated with perovskite and the HTM layer was observed to be about 520 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Fig. 2(c) shows a comparative diagram of the energy levels for mp-TiO2, perovskite (i.e. CH3NH3PbI3), and HTMs. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Table 1, the HOMO levels of DMFA-FA and DMFA-TPA are revealed to be very comparable (−5.21 and −5.25 eV, respectively) to that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV), which are well matched with that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV).

Fig. 3(a) shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells employing different HTMs. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. It has been well known that the use of dopant additives, such as 4-tert-butylpiridine (TBP), lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III),17 can largely enhance the energy conversion efficiency of solid-state perovskite solar cells by increasing the hole-conductivity of HTMs. Therefore, we have employed the additives for the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells. As a result, the cell employing DMFA-FA exhibited almost comparable photovoltaic performance with those of a spiro-OMeTAD based reference cell. We fabricated 30 solar cells. The histogram of the efficiency of the cells is displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The resulting device performances yielded average efficiencies of 12.47%, 10.82%, and 13.35% for DMFA-FA, DMFA-TPA, and spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells, as shown in Table 1. The best energy conversion efficiency of the solid-state solar cell with DMFA-FA was 14.21% under one sun illumination. In the case of DMFA-TPA, the photovoltaic performance was observed to be somewhat degraded compared to those of DMFA-FA and spiro-OMeTAD mostly owing to the low fill factor. The fill factors in the devices followed a similar trend with the hole conductivities, resulting in a reduced series resistance in the three HTMs.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the solar cells fabricated with three different HTMs are also compared with each other in Fig. 3(b). The integrated photocurrent densities of DMFA-FA, DMFA-TPA, and spiro-OMeTAD were shown to be 20.66, 19.44, and 20.86 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well consistent with the Jsc values evaluated from the J–V curves (summarized in Table 1). As a result, DMFA-FA exhibits more predominant IPCEs in the whole wavelength range compared to those of DMFA-TPA due to the broad and red-shifted absorption properties. The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) and the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) spectra, which were obtained from the corresponding LHE and IPCE data, are also provided in the ESI† (Fig. S3).
The hole mobilities of the HTMs were measured from the space charge limitation of current (SCLC) in the J–V characteristics obtained under dark conditions as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The result shows that the hole mobilities of DMFA-FA and DMFA-TPA evaluated using the Mott–Gurney law were revealed to be 1.76 × 10−4 and 8.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The high fill factor of the DMFA-FA solar cell, which is much better than that of the cell employing DMFA-TPA, could be explained by the difference in the hole mobilities of the two HTMs.
We have also checked the thermal stability of the HTMs via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), much enhanced thermal stability of DMFA-FA was observed compared to that of DMFA-TPA, demonstrating that the introduction of the fused triphenylamine core could stabilize the molecular structure thereby inducing the improved thermal stability of the HTM.
The hysteresis characteristics in the J–V curves have also been evaluated and the results are summarized in the ESI.† We could not find any significant difference among the devices with the three HTMs. More detailed studies on the hysteresis mitigation are in progress.

Fig. 4 displays the changes in the photovoltaic performances during the long-term stability test for the perovskite solar cells. The device with DMFA-FA showed excellent durability, which is nearly comparable with that of the reference cell employing spiro-OMeTAD. After aging under one sun illumination for 250 hours, the initial efficiency of the DMFA-FA solar cell (14.2%) was degraded to 13.2%, giving 7.04% reduction, which is comparable to that (7.02%) of a spiro-OMeTAD based cell. However, in the case of the test cell including DMFA-TPA, the photovoltaic performance was more predominantly degraded during the test compared to those of DMFA-FA and spiro-OMeTAD based cells. The better stability of DMFA-FA compared with that of DMFA-TPA may be attributable to the enhanced molecular stability as well as the excellent packing on the MAPb3I layer owing to a planar molecular configuration by employing the fused triphenylamine core.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized novel HTMs including fused/non-fused triphenylamine cores and bis-dimethylfluorenylamino moiety (DMFA-FA and DMFA-TPA) for high performance perovskite solar cell applications. Their photovoltaic characteristics were systematically compared with those of a conventional HTM (spiro-OMeTAD). The prepared HTMs exhibited appropriate HOMO levels which are very comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD and well matched with that of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. DMFA-FA including a fused triphenylamine core showed predominant properties compared with those of DMFA-TPA with a non-fused one. The use of a fused triphenylamine core significantly enhanced the hole mobility and molecular stability of the HTM. We have achieved the best energy conversion efficiency of 14.21% under one sun illumination with a perovskite solar cell using DMFA-FA, which is comparable to that (14.67%) of the spiro-OMeTAD based cell. Moreover, DMFA-FA exhibited excellent durability, which is nearly comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD, during the long-term stability test for 250 hours. From the results, it is believed that our new materials could be some of the most promising alternatives to highly expensive traditional HTMs.
