    , Accepted 23rd August 2021First published on 23rd August 2021AbstractFloating photovoltaic (FPV) systems are gaining attention across the world, which make an important contribution to the green energy revolution and diffuse the heated debate on use of land worldwide. Large-scale FPV systems generally deploy crystalline silicon panels that are brittle, heavy and difficult to integrate. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the emerging PV technologies to date. The potential deployment of PSCs on bodies of water can combine the unique advantages of organic electronics, which allow them to become semitransparent and simultaneously provide controlled shading and green electricity. So far, little attention has been paid to the impacts of FPV technologies on water bodies and their ecosystems. In this study, we propose a new concept of extending semitransparent PSCs (ST-PSCs) to the field of FPV and focus on exploring the environmental impacts and benefits of placing high-performance ST-PSCs on bodies of water. We demonstrate for the first time that the specific transmittance windows with controlled light intensities provided by ST-PSCs can scale up solar energy generation and regulate the growth of four representative microalgae that are widely distributed in diverse aquatic habitats. This work provides insight into environmentally responsible FPV systems for sustainable management of the important primary production in the aquatic ecosystem, instead of simply blocking the sunlight with conventional opaque solar panels.
1. Introduction
Our earth receives thousands of times more solar energy from the sun every day as compared to all climate-damaging fossil fuels use combined. Solar energy is a clean, renewable and abundant source of energy in efforts to address the global energy crisis and climate changes. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is a sustainable and elegant technology that directly converts unlimited sun rays into electric power, which has become a vital part of the global energy transformation.1,2 When it comes to large-scale solar systems, solar PV is generally used at a utility scale with thousands of large panels in arrays. Such solar farms (solar parks) are deployed in deserts, on military bases and atop closed landfills. For small-scale and residential applications, buildings integrated with photovoltaics and solar photovoltaic shingles have spread rapidly, which mimic the appearance and function of building materials while generating electric power. Such land-mounted PV projects are a common sight, which generally require relatively large areas, and the space needs to be committed for a period of ∼20 years.3 For many land-scarce and densely populated countries, the vast deployment of solar farms is often hindered by the strain on land that is devoted to agriculture and residence.
It is worth noting that solar PV systems do not necessarily have to be mounted on land. As an emerging technology, floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) can be mounted on platforms that float on unused bodies of water and scale-up solar energy conversion without taking up valuable space on land (Fig. 1a).4 So far, the number of FPV installations has grown rapidly across the world. Market reports predict that FPV installations are increasing with an annual growth rate of around 20–30% in the coming years. FPV can deploy on several application scenarios such as mineral extraction pits, reservoirs, lakes and unmanned gliders to maximize the use of water bodies (Fig. 1b).5,6 If conditions are right, “nearshore” FPV plants are expected to sit in bays, harbors and adjacent to wind and oil platforms.7 Being regarded as a third pillar of the solar PV sector, FPV creates a new opportunity to scale-up solar energy harvest and electricity generation, which helps land-constrained countries dealing with competing land use pressures.8

Current FPV installations are generally based on crystalline silicon-based PV panels. The band-like absorption (300–1300 nm) and thick active layers (∼300 μm) result in opaque and bulky solar PV cells.9 As silicon PV technologies have reached the efficiency limits, our solar PV community is looking for alternatives to advance solar power generation. After a dizzying decade of development, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated unique advantages of being low-cost, light-weight, flexible, compatible for large-scale manufacturing with a short energy payback time, and become increasingly efficient with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over 19%.10–26 High-performance PSCs generally feature a thin bulk-heterojunction active layer (∼100 nm) with high absorption coefficients (∼105 cm−1) and tunable absorption (∼300–1100 nm) through synergistic material and device engineering.27–30 These properties have promoted extensive research on the development of semitransparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs), delivering unique practical and aesthetic values for solar-power smart windows and greenhouses.31–43 Recently, this design concept has been implemented in the field of floating and underwater applications.44,45 In 2019, our group has reported efficient evaporation-mitigating and heat-insulating properties of ST-PSCs on bodies of water.46 The reduction in water evaporation through FPV systems should be particularly beneficial for water conservation in arid areas, increasing water availability and hydropower production of artificial water reservoirs. Taking into account the aquatic ecosystem, eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria as microscopic photosynthetic organisms represent a major group of primary producers in a variety of water environments. Opaque PV arrays that are constructed from crystalline silicon PV cells block the sunlight on water bodies. Although conventional FPV farms are generally thought to prevent algae blooms and improve water quality, temperature variations, decreased amount of dissolved oxygen and anaerobic decomposition that occur in aquatic ecosystems have raised concerns and require more environmental assessments. On the other hand, ST-PSCs can offer intriguing functions that are lacking in opaque crystalline silicon-based PV cells. Control of sunlight that travels through ST-PSCs represents a possibility – chance to regulate solar power generation, water temperature, aquatic environments and organisms rather than simply shading the entire bodies of water. In 2020, our group has demonstrated that high-performance ST-PSCs can offer controlled transmittance windows to regulate the growth of a cosmopolitan genus Chlorella (green algae).47 Related research is still beyond reach, because various species of algae are vastly different in pigmentations, tolerance and chosen environments. More verified data is considered necessary for studies on representative species of algae that live in diverse habitats.
In this contribution, a feasibility study was conducted to evaluate high-performing ST-PSCs for potential FPV applications, focusing on systematic characterization of a variety of algal growth with respect to the transmission windows of ST-PSCs. Opaque PSCs with high PCEs of ∼16.6% were obtained by employing a combination of a terpolymer as electron donor and a small molecule as electron acceptor. The corresponding ST-PSCs attained a high PCE of ∼11.2% with good visible transmittance over 20%, exhibiting an ideal trade-off between the solar power generation and the transmission windows for aquatic ecosystem. Four representative species of algae (beneficial or harmful) that live in different water environments (offshore, nearshore and inland waters) were taken as model algae. In addition to single-junction ST-PSCs, ST-PSCs were also integrated into multi-junction systems and properly placed on bodies of water. Photo-to-electricity conversion of ST-PSCs, growth and photosynthetic parameters of the algae were carefully characterized via a set of designed experimental approaches. Associated with the efficient solar energy generation, this work aims to understand the environmental impacts and benefits of ST-PSCs on aquatic life for potential FPV applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Optical properties and photovoltaic performance of ST-PSCs
In general, PSCs incorporate a bulk-heterojunction active layer, which comprises a blend of an electron-donor and an electron-acceptor. A terpolymer PBDB-TF-T10 was synthesized based on our previous report and was employed as an electron donor.48 In comparison to the commercial alternating copolymer (named PBDB-TF or PM6), the merits of our copolymerization strategy and structural engineering can be rationalized as follows: (i) the donor–acceptor 1–donor–acceptor 2 (D–A1–D–A2)-type backbone of PBDB-TF-T10 enabled us to broaden its absorption spectrum and increase its structural disorder and solubility for solution-processing; (ii) incorporation of double-ester-substituted thiophenes as the third building block down-shifted the energy levels of PBDB-TF-T10, affording higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs; (iii) PBDB-TF-T10 retained the polymer ordering and π–π stacking of PBDB-TF, yet featured higher dielectric constant, and optimized miscibility and morphology in blend films; (iv) PBDB-TF-T10 can mitigate the batch-to-batch effects of donor polymers on the photovoltaic performance and offer a wide molecular weight window for high PCEs over 16%. As one of the most representative non-fullerene acceptors, the small molecular Y6 was in combination with PBDB-TF-T10 in this study.49–51 The chemical structures of PBDB-TF-T10 and Y6 were depicted in Fig. 2a. The absorption of PBDB-TF-T10 in film ranged from 350 to 750 nm with a maximum absorption coefficient of ∼6.4 × 104 cm−1 at 610 nm. The absorption of Y6 in film was in a wavelength range of 600–1000 nm with the highest absorption coefficient of ∼11.0 × 104 cm−1 at 825 nm (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The complementary absorption of PBDB-TF-T10 and Y6 afforded broad absorption (350–950 nm) in the blend film to cover the solar spectrum (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The transmittance of PBDB-TF-T10 and Y6 agreed well with their absorbance and leaded to three high transmission bands ranging from 380–625 nm, 625–800 nm and 800–1000 nm (Fig. 2b). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBDB-TF-T10 were −5.50 and −3.74 eV, respectively. Y6 showed down-shifted HOMO (−5.64 eV) and LUMO (−4.10 eV) levels as compared to PBDB-TF-T10.48

The opaque and ST-PSCs with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-TF-T10:Y6/PDINO/Ag were fabricated and characterized under 1 sun (Fig. S2, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 2c and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 PSC with a small active area of 0.07 cm2 attained a Voc of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 27.0 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.73, resulting in a high PCE of 16.6%. Based on the best-performing opaque PSCs, ST-PSCs were fabricated by employing the same device configuration and lowering the thickness of Ag electrode from 80 to 15 nm. The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSCs attained a high PCE of 11.2% (Fig. 2d and Table 1). Both opaque PSCs and ST-PSCs showed broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) profiles in a wavelength region of 300–1000 nm (Fig. 2e). For all opaque PSCs and ST-PSCs, the calculated photocurrents from the EQE curves agreed well with the measured Jsc, and confirmed the accuracy of the J–V characterization. The hygroscopic and acidic properties of PEDOT:PSS inevitably led to moisture related defects (interfacial passivation and electrode corrosion), lowering the long-term stability of conventional PSCs for real-world applications. Advanced methods to protect floating solar panels from specific environmental conditions on bodies of water (high humidity and warm temperature) are required for future design of FPVs.

Exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and recombination losses of ST-PSCs were studied via a set of experiments. Exciton dissociation was characterized by measuring the characteristic photocurrent (Jph) and photovoltage (Veff) and Jph/Jsat was defined as the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss). The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC showed a high Pdiss of 91.2%, which reveals that a majority of hole-electron pairs were dissociated to free charges under a short-circuit condition (Fig. S3, ESI†). The comparable hole mobilities (3.35 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobilities (4.50 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) indicate the balanced charge carrier transport in the PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 blend (Fig. S4, ESI†). The measurements on the dependence of Jsc and Voc upon the intensity of incident light suggest that the bimolecular recombination in PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC was negligible and most charge carriers should be swept out prior to recombination under a short-circuit condition (Fig. S5a, ESI†). On the other hand, monomolecular and trap-assisted recombination losses occurred in the ST-PSC under an open-circuit condition (Fig. S5b, ESI†).
Large-area PSCs were fabricated to place ST-PSCs on bodies of algal cultures and evaluate the beneath algal growth. The opaque PSCs and ST-PSCs with an active area of 0.97 cm2 afforded high PCEs of 9.7% and 7.5%, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S6, ESI†). In addition to solar energy conversion, several critical parameters such as average visible transmittance (AVT), visible light transmittance (VLT), color coordinate and color rendering index (CRI) were measured to represent the brightness and color perception of ST-PSCs.52 AVT quantifies the average amount of sunlight (380–760 nm) that passes through the ST-PSC. Taking into account the human eye photopic response (380–760 nm), VLT reflects the brightness of an object that is perceived by human eyes. The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC with 15 nm Ag cathode showed good transparency with high AVT and VLT of 24.1% and 21.7%, respectively. The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC faithfully reproduced the colors of the background images (duckweeds on water) without significant color aberration (Fig. 2f). The color coordinate (x, y) of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC was marked in the Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram (Fig. S7, ESI†). The color coordinate of (0.28, 0.28) and the high CRI of 94 have verified the good color rendering ability of ST-PSC.
Instead of human eyes, algae are the “observers” for the sunlight passing through ST-PSCs in this study. As a result, the transmittance of ST-PSC and absorptance of the major pigments in common algae are plotted in Fig. 2g and Fig. S8, ESI.† The PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC exhibited broad transmission bands in wavelength ranges of 380–550 nm, 625–750 nm and 850–1000 nm. In general, chlorophyll, carotenoid and phycobilin are the three major classes of photosynthetic pigments in most algae. Chlorophyll a and b are the major types of green pigments. β-Carotene and fucoxanthin from diatoms are red-orange pigments and the major members of carotenoids. Phycobilins were a main group of accessory pigments that occur in red and blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), which generally show the major absorption band in the wavelength range of 520–670 nm. The absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b, β-carotene, fucoxanthin, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin in aqueous solutions are partially overlapped with the transmittance spectrum of the PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC, specifically in the wavelength ranges of 380–525 nm and 550–725 nm. This result discloses that the sunlight transmitted through the PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC can be absorbed by most algae, supporting the photosynthesis and algal growth.
2.2 Algal growth and photosynthesis characterization
There are more than 5000 species of algae worldwide, which are incredibly diverse in shapes, sizes, growth patterns and chosen environments. As one of the major primary producers in water, microalgae use photosynthesis to turn sunlight and carbon dioxide into energy, and release oxygen back into the water and atmosphere. They form the basis of the aquatic food web, support the entire aquatic ecosystem, and are also a substitute for fossil fuels. Most microalgae are beneficial and benign, but few of them can trigger harmful algal blooms, which release toxins that create “dead zones” in water, pose risks in human health and threaten drinking-water supplies. In order to assess the ecological influence of ST-PSCs on aquatic ecosystem, four representative microalgal species belonging to green algae, dinoflagellate, diatom and cyanobacteria were selected to conduct biological simulation experiments in this study. These microalgae have different pigmentations and ecological niches, and represent the most important and dominant microalgae in aquatic ecosystem worldwide. All algae were cultivated until their population entered exponential phases in this study, which reflect the period when algae are actively dividing and increasing at a constant rate.
Sunlight is the primary source of energy and critical factor that controls the algal growth and photosynthetic reactions. The photosynthetic parameters that characterize algal growth are generally divided into three phases (known as photo-limitation, photo-saturation and photo-inhibition). In a photo-limitation period, the light intensity does not reach a saturation point or on an optimum level, and the algal growth and photosynthetic efficiency increase with the light intensity. After the light is saturated and becomes no longer a limiting factor, photosynthetic parameters do not change over time and a photo-saturation phase is reached. Further increase in light intensity leads to photo-damage to algae because of the photo-oxidation reactions occurred in chloroplasts, which reduces the photosynthetic efficiency in the photo-inhibition phase.

2.2.1 Green alga Chlorella in fresh water. 

Chlorophyta is a taxon of green algae, which is widely distributed in aquatic environments (most in freshwater and ∼10% in seawater). Chlorella sp. selected in this study is one of the most widely distributed and cultivated green algae worldwide. The main photosynthetic pigments in Chlorella sp. are chlorophyll a and b. The absorption spectra of the two pigments are shown in Fig. S8a, ESI.† In order to evaluate how ST-PSC affect the growth of Chlorella sp., the transmittance of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC was weighted by the standard solar spectrum and absorption spectrum of photosynthetic pigments in Chlorella sp. An algal growth factor (G) can be expressed by using eqn (1), (1)where T(λ) is the transmittance spectrum of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC, S(λ) is the AM 1.5 G solar irradiation spectrum and a(λ) is the absorption spectrum (400–750 nm) of the photosynthetic pigments extracted from Chlorella sp. (Fig. S9, ESI†). The single-junction ST-PSC gave a high G of ∼28.0%. The value is comparable to several reported growth factors of higher plants, where ST-PSCs were evaluated for greenhouse appolications.42,53Fig. 3a illustrates the experimental setup for algal proliferation characterization in this study. The four algae were first cultivated in a light incubator until the population entered an exponential phase. After that, large-area PSCs (active area of 0.97 cm2) were placed on the culture solutions of algae. All PSCs were placed 1 cm higher than the surface of culture solutions. We point out that parallel measurements were conducted, where three culture solutions of each alga were measured under each group of PSCs (opaque and semitransparent) at the same conditions. The growth curves of algae were recorded over a long period of time. The growth rate was calculated by the exponential growth equation, which can be expressed by using eqn (2), Ct = C0eμexpt(2)where C0 and Ct are the cell concentrations at time 0 and t, respectively. μexp is the specific growth rate. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the culture solutions of Chlorella sp. gradually turned green under continuous illumination (∼6000 lux) in a period of 72 h. Chlorella sp. is a single-celled alga with a spherical shape of ∼3–10 μm under the microscope. The population explosion of Chlorella sp. over time resulted in the bodies of “green water”. The growth curves of Chlorella sp. were plotted in Fig. 3c. The histogram in Fig. 3d summarizes all μexp of Chlorella sp. that measured under different PSCs after 72 h. The control groups without any cover on water showed the fastest μexp of 1.45 d−1. On the other hand, the slowest μexp of 0.75 d−1 was found in the culture solutions that were covered by the opaque PSCs, indicating a significant growth inhibition. The culture solutions covered by ST-PSCs presented a moderate μexp of 0.98 d−1, which reveals that the sunlight that transmit through ST-PSCs can improve the growth of Chlorella as compared to the opaque PSC.

Photosynthetic performance was characterized via a pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometer. In this scenario, a chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm was measured to assess the maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), which can be expressed by using eqn (3), Fv/Fm = (Fm − F0)/Fm(3)where F0 is the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence after dark adaptation, Fm is the maximum fluorescence after exposure to a saturating pulse of light, and the difference between Fm and F0 is defined as the variable fluorescence (Fv). In healthy algae, Fv/Fm generally ranges from 0.6 to 0.8. As summarized in Fig. 3d and Table S1, ESI,† the control groups of Chlorella sp. showed the lowest Fv/Fm after 72 h. In this case, Chlorella sp. tended to reduce the cellular chlorophyll contents for self-protection and showed the decreases in Fv/Fm. The opaque PSCs and ST-PSCs shaded portions of sunlight, which partially alleviated the photo-inhibition and activated the photosynthesis of Chlorella sp. Thus, PSCs and ST-PSCs can improve the Fv/Fm to 0.70 and 0.68, respectively. The similar photo-inhibition and photo-acclimation of Chlorella sp. were observed in our previous report.47


2.2.2 Dinoflagellate A. carterae in red tides. 
Dinoflagellates are a genus of unicellular protists, which are mostly known as marine plankton. In the oceans, dinoflagellates show good tolerance to low salinity conditions and are particularly adapted to nearshore environments such as epicontinental seas and estuaries worldwide. Triggered by a combination of conditions (high nutrients, low turbulence and warm temperature), some species of dinoflagellates can grow in massive quantities in surface water and lead to the infamous “red tides” in the coastal and estuarine water.54Amphidinium carterae (A. carterae) was selected and taken as a model alga in this section, which can produce hemolytic toxins that are fatal for coastal ecosystems and sicken humans. The main photosynthetic pigments in A. carterae are chlorophyll a and β-carotene. The absorption spectra of the two pigments are shown in Fig. S8b, ESI.† As depicted in Fig. 4a, A. carterae has an oval cell comprising two flagella and a medium size (12–17 μm in length and 7–10 μm in width). A population explosion of A. carterae was observed in culture solutions under continuous illumination (∼6000 lux) over 80 h. As summarized in Fig. 4b and c, the highest and lowest μexp (0.70 and 0.36 d−1) were observed in the control groups and the culture solutions under the opaque PSC, respectively. A moderate μexp of 0.48 d−1 was found in the culture solutions covered by ST-PSCs. Similar with Chlorella, the control groups of A. carterae gave the lowest Fv/Fm (0.62) as compared to the ST-PSCs (0.66) and opaque PSCs (0.69), which is due to the photo-acclimation of cells to bright light conditions (Table S1, ESI†).

2.2.3 Marine diatoms P. tricornutum in nearshore oceans. 
Marine diatoms are a genus of unicellular and silica-precipitating microalgae that are widely distributed in the sunlit oceans. They contribute substantially (∼40%) to net primary production in aquatic habitats, and become one of the most prominent primary producers on earth. They also account for over 50% of organic carbon burial (transfer particulate organic carbon from the ocean surface to deep ocean) in marine sediments, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle.55Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P. tricornutum) that found in coastal areas was taken as a model alga in this section. The main photosynthetic pigments in P. tricornutum are chlorophyll a, β-carotene and fucoxanthin. The absorption spectra of the three pigments are shown in Fig. S8c, ESI.† As depicted in Fig. 5a, P. tricornutum occurred in several shapes (oval, fusiform and triradiate) and showed a cell size of ∼10–30 μm in length and ∼3.5 μm in width. An explosive growth of P. tricornutum was observed and gradually turned the culture solution brown under continuous illumination (∼6000 lux) over 96 h. The P. tricornutum in the control groups grew at the highest μexp of 1.21 d−1 (Fig. 5b and c). The culture solutions under ST-PSCs showed a medium μexp of 0.97 d−1. The lowest μexp of 0.73 d−1 was recorded in the cultures under opaque PSCs. The variations of Fv/Fm were similar with Chlorella and A. carterae, suggesting the photo-acclimation of cells to bright light conditions (Table S1, ESI†).

2.2.4 Blue-green alga Synechococcus in offshore oceans. 
Different from the eukaryotic microalgae (Chlorella, A. carterae and P. tricornutum) that characterized above, cyanobacteria (known as blue-green algae) are an oxygen-evolving species of photosynthetic Gram-negative prokaryotes, and are one of the oldest living organism on earth. In addition to being photosynthetic in a wide variety of moist soils and water, some cyanobacteria can transform the gaseous nitrogen of the air into bioactive compounds. Marine cyanobacteria constitute ∼10% of the total marine picoplankton in the upper water (∼200 m) and are responsible for ∼25% of net primary productivity in the oceans. Specifically, Synechococcus is a globally significant genus of cyanobacteria that is widespread in many marine environments. It accounts for substantial fraction (∼25%) of global marine primary production and plays a key role in regulating marine microbial food web.56Synechococcus is among the smallest photosynthetic organisms on earth with a diameter of 0.8–1.2 μm, the large specific surface area and low nutrient requirement enable it to take up nutrient efficiently and become dominant in nutrient-limited oceanic waters. On the other hand, common phytoplankton with larger cell sizes (e.g., dinoflagellates and diatoms) are abundant in the eutrophic coastal and inland waters. The main photosynthetic pigments in Synechococcus are chlorophyll a, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. The absorption spectra of the three pigments are shown in Fig. S8d, ESI.† It is reported that Synechococcus is more adapted to lower light conditions as compared to common eukaryotic microalgae.57 The concentration of cells was counted after staining with an asymmetrical cyanine dye (SYBR green I, which binds to the DNA of cells and emits green light) via a flow cytometry analyzer equipped with an argon laser. As depicted in the 2D dot-plots, each red dot in the cluster represents an algal cell in the culture (Fig. 6a and Fig. S10, ESI†). The growth of Synechococcus is different from the eukaryotic algae, as summarized in Fig. 6b and c. The lowest μexp of 0.32 d−1 was observed in the control groups, indicating clear photo-inhibition. The reduced light intensity generated by opaque PSCs increased μexp to 0.37 d−1. Interestingly, the highest μexp of 0.66 d−1 was recorded from the ST-PSCs and negligible photo-inhibition was observed. This differs with the reduced growth rates of the three microalgae under the ST-PSCs that charactered above. This is because Synechococcus is more adapted to lower light conditions and has a lower optimal light level for growth as compared to common eukaryotic microalgae. The result suggests that the PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC provided an ideal grow light for the growth of Synechococcus.

2.3 Algal growth control and potential environmental impacts
The wavelength, intensity and photoperiod of sunlight should be the three crucial factors that affect growth and photosynthetic reactions of common algae. In general, algae use several primary and accessory pigments to accomplish photosynthetic and photoprotective processes. For the four microalgae selected in this study, the chloroplasts of Chlorella mainly contain two green pigments chlorophyll a and b, leading to its bright green color. Most dinoflagellates mainly contain green pigments chlorophyll a and c2, a carotenoid β-carotene and a unique group of xanthophylls, leading to the typical brown color. The chloroplasts of diatoms are generally yellowish-brown. This coloration is due to the presence of chlorophyll a and c, fucoxanthin and a group of photo-protective carotenoids. Cyanobacteria mainly contain chlorophyll a, a blue pigment phycocyanin or a red pigment phycoerythrin, several yellowish carotenoids, resulting in the typical blue-green or pink color. Although the content of pigments is a specific feature of each species, it is noted that there are three major classes of photosynthetic pigments, which are chlorophyll, carotenoid and phycobilin. As illustrated in Fig. 2g, the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and b, β-carotene and phycocyanin are partially overlapped with the transmittance of the PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC, specifically in the broad transmission bands of 380–525 nm and 550–725 nm. The results indicate that the sunlight transmitted through ST-PSC can be absorbed by these algae and support the growth and photosynthesis.
In addition to the wavelengths of photosynthetic pigments, light intensity is another important cultivation parameter. In nature, microalgae have varied light requirements and can only grow well by taking the advantages of niches in the aquatic ecosystem. Increases in light intensity generally improve growth rates of common algae to a photo-inhibitory threshold, yet this threshold and the strength of photo-inhibition vary among species of algae. When the cultivation is under some stress conditions (low and high light intensity), decreases in growth rates occur. Among the eukaryotic microalgae (Chlorella sp., A. carterae and P. tricornutum) used in this study, Chlorella has relatively higher chlorophyll contents, which can grow in a broad range of light intensity (∼150–300 μmol m−2 s−1) and can be adapted to even brighter light conditions. A. carterae and P. tricornutum can be cultivated in medium light intensity of ∼50–200 μmol m−2 s−1. On the other hand, Synechococcus requires relative lower light intensity of ∼30–100 μmol m−2 s−1. We point out that the varied light requirements of each alga in the ecological niche were taken into account in this study. The cultivation of Chlorella, A. carterae and P. tricornutum were performed in a light incubator under continuous illumination of ∼6000 lux. The corresponding algal growth characterization was performed by using a solar simulator with continuous light (∼9.5 mW cm−2 and ∼6000 lux). Lower light intensity of (∼0.5 mW cm−2 and ∼300 lux) was used to cultivate and evaluate the growth of Synechococcus.
Taking into account the growth and optical properties together, the single-junction ST-PSC did not entirely inhibit the algal growth of the typical eukaryotic microalgae and improved the algal growth by 20–32% as compared with the opaque PSC. It suggests that the selected transmission of sunlight by using ST-PSCs can sustain the growth of the beneficial eukaryotic microalgae that are widely distributed in most coastal and inland waters. On the other hand, the ST-PSC reduced the growth of the eukaryotic microalgae by 31–33% because of shading, as compared to the control groups. In particular, the prolific growth of A. carterae that found in red tides was restricted in the shade of ST-PSC, indicating the deployment of ST-PSCs in nearshore and inland waters can potentially prevent rapid increases in the harmful algae population. For the beneficial Synechococcus that found in oceanic waters, ST-PSCs can avoid the potential photo-inhibition and open a proper transmission window to maximize the algal growth as compared to both the control group and opaque PSC. As cyanobacteria (typically Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus) generally dominate the oceanic waters with low nutrients and low productivity, the deployment of ST-PSCs on offshore oceans can potentially increase the carbon fixation and primary production in the surface oligotrophic ecosystem by shading the strong sunlight at surface water. These results disclose the potential of using ST-PSCs to sustain the primary production in different habitats and eliminate the factors that kick-start harmful algal blooms. Future work could be devoted to investigate a range of conjugated materials with distinct absorption profiles and varied active layer thicknesses to modulate desired transmittance intensities, delivering rational control of specific algal growth (i.e. in a photo-saturation stage for “good” algae, yet in a photo-inhibition stage for “bad” algae).
2.4 Integrated ST-PSC systems
Associated with the modulations of single-junction ST-PSCs, control of the number of junctions is thought to be another method to easily modulate the entire transparency (photon loss) and PCE (photon gain) of the entire ST-PSC systems. Based on the best-performing single-junction ST-PSC, a series of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSCs (active area: 0.07 cm2) were integrated and formed two- and three-junctions as illustrated in Fig. 7a. The photons that pass through the top device (ST-PSC-1) can be reused by the second or third devices. Notably, the two-junction systems can afford higher PCEs of 14.6% as compared to the single-junction ST-PSC, which is because the anode (ITO) of the beneath cell can reflect portions of photons back to the top cell and improve the sunlight absorption. A high PCE of 16.3% was recorded in the three-junction ST-PSC, approaching to the PCE (16.6%) of the opaque PSC (Fig. 7b and Fig. S11, ESI†). Increases in junctions of ST-PSCs gradually reduce the transmittance (Fig. 7c). Weighted with the AM 1.5 G solar spectrum, the effective transmittance (ET) of ST-PSCs (active area: 0.97 cm2) in the wavelength range of 380–760 nm can be expressed by using eqn (4). (4)where T(λ) is the transmittance spectrum of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 ST-PSC, S(λ) is the AM 1.5 G solar irradiation spectrum. The two-junction ST-PSC decreased ET to ∼17.8% as compared to the single-junction ST-PSC (ET = ∼24.1%). The three-junction ST-PSC showed a negligible ET of ∼2.7%, which was nearly opaque. The measurements on transmission were in good agreement with the photovoltaic performance of ST-PSCs.

(d) Growth curves and (e) summary of μexp and Fv/Fm of Chlorella sp. under continues illumination over 72 h under two- and three-junction ST-PSCs. 
The integrated ST-PSCs (active area: 0.97 cm2) were placed on the culture solutions of Chlorella sp. and the corresponding growth curves were plotted in Fig. 7d. As compared to a high G (∼28.0%) obtained in the single-junction ST-PSC, the two-junction ST-PSC retained a moderate G of ∼20.2%, whereas the three-junction ST-PSC significantly lowered G to ∼3.9%. The histogram in Fig. 7e summarizes the all μexp and Fv/Fm of Chlorella sp. after 72 h. The control group without any cover showed the fastest μexp of 0.83 d−1 and a proper Fv/Fm of 0.66. On the other hand, the three-junction system significant suppressed the growth and photosynthesis of Chlorella, exhibiting the lowest μexp and Fv/Fm. Notably, no clear decline on μexp was found in the two-junction system as compared to the single-junction ST-PSC, and both of which presented Fv/Fm of 0.73 in a health range. Notably, the two-junction ST-PSC system can synergistically retain the growth and photosynthesis of Chlorella and enhance the total PCE by ∼29% as compared to the single-junction PSCs. The results disclose the potential of using integrated ST-PSC systems to synergistically regulate the growth and photosynthesis of algae and enhance solar energy generation.
3. Conclusion
In summary, high-performance and large-area ST-PSCs based on PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 were fabricated and demonstrated for synergistic control of solar energy generation and algal growth in typical aquatic environments. The newly designed experimental approaches and systematic characterization reveal the merits of ST-PSCs for potential FPV applications, which are rationalized as follows: (i) the small- and large-scale ST-PSCs attained high PCEs of 11.2% and 7.5%, respectively, exhibiting good VLTs over 20%. Ideal trade-off between PCE and VLT delivered both efficient photo-to-electricity conversion and selected transparency of ST-PSCs, which is among the best-performing ST-PSCs reported so far. (ii) ST-PSCs provided specific transmittance windows and controlled light intensities that were matched well with the common photosynthetic pigments in most algae, thereby regulating the growth of four representative microalgae (Chlorella sp., A. carterae, P. tricornutum and Synechococcus) found in different aquatic habitats (offshore, nearshore and inland waters). The results disclose the potential of ST-PSCs to sustain the primary productivity that is fundamental for aquatic food chains and to restrict explosive growth of harmful algae (e.g. A. carterae) in versatile application scenarios. It opens an interesting research field of FPVs, where the transmittance (wavelength and intensity) of floating solar panels can be modulated to target the growth of specific algae. (iii) The integrated ST-PSC system with two-junctions can sustain the algal growth and boost the solar energy generation by ∼29% as compared to single-junction ST-PSCs, highlighting a new avenue of scaling-up solar energy output. This work paves an intriguing prospect of developing high-performance ST-PSCs for potential FPV applications, not merely taking the advantages of conventional FPV systems, but also delivering additional co-benefits for the management and sustainability of the algae ecosystem, food web and biogeochemical cycles.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Fabrication of opaque and ST-PSCs
All PSCs were fabricated and tested in a glove box with temperature: ∼22 °C, oxygen: ∼0.1 ppm and water: ∼0.1 ppm. The PSCs were fabricated by using a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(CLEVIOS™ PVP AI 4083)/active layer/PDINO/Ag. A aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on ITO at 4000 rpm for 60 s and thermal-annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, the active layer (∼110 nm) was deposited by spin-coating a chloroform solution consisting of PBDB-TF-T10:Y6 (1:1.2 w/w, 16 mg mL−1 in total) with 0.5 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additives at 4500 rpm for 30 s, followed by a thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glove box. Subsequently, a methanol solution of PDINO (1 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 25 s. For opaque PSCs, Ag (80 nm) was deposited on PDINO via a mask under 3 × 10−4 Pa vacuum. ST-PSCs were fabricated by following a similar procedure with opaque PSCs, where a 15 nm of Ag was deposited as the top electrode in each device. The active area of PSC was defined by the overlap of the ITO and Ag electrode, which was measured via a microscope.
4.2 Algal growth and photosynthesis measurements
The four microalgae were cultivated in the f/2 medium at 20 °C in an incubator, until the population of cells entered the exponential phase. Circular tubes were placed under opaque PSCs and ST-PSCs (active area: 0.97 cm2), respectively. Triplicates were conducted in each measurement. Another three circular tubes without any cover served as the control groups. The cultivations and growth measurements of Chlorella sp., A. carterae and P. tricornutum were performed under continuous light (∼9.5 mW cm−2 and ∼6000 lux) over time. The cultivations and growth measurements of Synechococcus were performed under continuous light (∼0.5 mW cm−2 and ∼300 lux) over time. All culture solutions were gently mixed for several times in a day to prevent the cells from sinking. For algal growth characterization, 1 mL of algal solution was taken from each tube every 8–12 h and immediately mixed with 50 μL of paraformaldehyde. The number of algal cells was enumerated via a microscope (Olympus CKX41) or a flow cytometer (CytoFLEX). The average growth rate of each alga was calculated from the three tubes in each shading condition (opaque PSCs, ST-PSCs and control groups).
The maximum photochemical efficiencies of PSII (Fv/Fm) of the four microalgae were determined by a pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometer (Water-PAM, WALZ) at different time. Specifically, Chlorella sp. was measured at 0 h, 36 h and 72 h. A. carterae was measured at 0 h, 40 h and 80 h. P. tricornutum was measured at 0 h, 48 h and 96 h. Synechococcus was measured at 0 h, 60 h and 120 h. All samples were adapted at dark for ∼10 min at in situ temperature before all measurements. All data processing were performed by following the manufacturer's protocols.
