    , Accepted 3rd November 2016First published on 3rd November 2016AbstractLateral heterostructures have attracted a great deal of attention due to their advanced properties, which may open up unforeseen opportunities in materials science and device physics. Here, we demonstrate a novel type of lateral heterostructure within monolayer indium monochalcogenides. The thermal stability of the structure is obtained based on the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. Our results reveal that the proposed lateral heterostructures have direct bandgaps, tunable electronic properties, and type-II band alignment. In addition, the predicted carrier mobilities exceed 103 cm2 (V s)−1, which are 1–2 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) materials. For the first time, the photoresponse and photovoltaic performance of such lateral heterostructures are evaluated based on the first-principles calculations. Upon illumination, the photoinduced current is generated throughout the heterojunction, with an external quantum efficiency up to 7.1%. These results make indium monochalcogenide lateral heterostructures promising candidates for next-generation of electronic and optoelectronic devices.
1 Introduction
Inspired by the successful synthesis of graphene, extensive studies have been devoted to two-dimensional (2D) materials.1–3 More and more 2D structures have been experimentally fabricated or theoretically predicted, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs, e.g. MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2),4–6 GeH,7 and black phosphorus (BP).8,9 As a class of layered semiconducting materials, indium monochalcogenides (InX with X = S, Se, Te) have attracted intense interest due to their exotic electronic structures and optical properties, which hold potential applications in fields such as optoelectronics, field-effect transistors, and solar energy conversion.10–12
To improve their electronic and optical properties, heterostructures with a staggered gap are developed by coupling different materials together.13,14 These 2D heterojunctions with type II band alignment are reported to facilitate the applications with promoted charge separation efficiencies due to the formation of built-in potentials at the junction interface, which play crucial roles in electronic, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic devices.15–19 Considering the particularity of the 2D structures, there are two types of 2D heterostructures, that is the vertical and lateral ones. The vertical case, also known as a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, is commonly achieved by stacking multiple monolayers vertically layer-by-layer. Such heterostructures have been demonstrated in various enhanced devices.16,17 However, these kinds of heterostructures often suffer from the poor quality of the interface, where a large density of defects/trap states is present in the junction region.20
In 2014, a new kind of heterostructure, namely a lateral heterostructure, is successfully fabricated in TMD materials.19,21,22 The individual monolayers can be adjoined laterally to construct an in-plane heterostructure by one-step or two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In the CVD process, the second material is epitaxially grown from the edge of the first one with the formation of a seamless in-plane heterojunction. With the formation of one-dimensional (1D) interfaces of two constituent materials, lateral heterostructures realize the ultimate thickness limit for junctions between semiconducting materials. Different from the vertical vdW heterostructure, the interface in the lateral heterostructure is reduced from 2D to 1D, finally becoming an interline. Moreover, the lateral boundary is connected via covalent bonds with an atomically sharp interface despite a large lattice mismatch, guaranteeing very high crystalline quality.19,23 Nevertheless, the studies on lateral heterostructures are still scarce. Hence, it becomes significant and challenging to search for advanced novel lateral heterostructures beyond the limited existing 2D systems.
In the present work, we propose the brand-new lateral heterostructures within monolayer indium monochalcogenides. Our results show that a type II band alignment is formed within the lateral heterojunctions, and the maximum valence and minimum conduction bands are spatially separated on opposite sides, which facilitate the separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs. Further calculations indicate that the carrier mobilities could become 1–2 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of TMD materials.24 In addition, the photocurrent is calculated using first-principles density functional theory within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF-DFT). Upon illumination, the photoinduced current is generated throughout the heterojunction region, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 7.1%, which is about 24 times higher than that of the BP–MoS2 vdW heterojunction.25 The photovoltaic power conversion efficiency reaches a peak value of 0.56%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the photoresponse and photovoltaic performance are evaluated in such lateral heterostructures by first-principles calculations, which provide theoretical reference for the design of new 2D composite based nano-devices.
2 Computational methods
2.1 DFT calculations
The DFT calculations are carried out using the projector augmented wave (PAW)26 scheme with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional,27 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).28,29 The cutoff energy for the basis set is chosen to be 500 eV, and the Brillouin zone is sampled with a Monkhorst–Pack grid of 18 × 18 × 1 for monolayer InX (X = S, Se, Te).30 In order to simulate the lateral heterojunctions, super-lattice models are adopted, and the k-point grids are adjusted accordingly.
In all the reported calculations, the atomic positions and the supercell size are fully relaxed using a conjugate-gradient (CG) method to an energy convergence of 10−5 eV and a force convergence of 10−2 eV Å−1. The vacuum space is set to 20 Å, which gives well-converged results. To account for the underestimation of the band gap in standard DFT calculations, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) is employed in this study,31,32 in which the hybrid functional is mixed with 25% exact Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange. To accurately account for dispersion interactions, a damped vdW correction based on Grimme's scheme is also incorporated to better describe the nonbonding interaction.33

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed in the canonical ensemble using a standard Nosé thermostat. The heterostructure systems are heated to 500 K for 10 ps with a 1 fs time step.
2.2 Carrier mobility calculation
The carrier mobility in 2D materials is dominated by acoustic phonon scattering via intra- and inter-valley deformation potential (DP) coupling at room temperature.34 The carrier mobility is given by the expression:9,35 (1)where e is the electron charge, m* is the carrier effective mass, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Ed is the DP constant, which is defined as Ed = dVedge/dε. Here Vedge is the energy change of the band edge (VBM for holes and CBM for electrons) induced by the strains. The isotropic strain ε is defined as ε = Δa/a0, where a0 is the equilibrium lattice constant without strain. The elastic modulus C is derived from (∂2E/∂ε2)/S0, where E is the total energy and S0 is the area for the heterojunction. The temperature used in this study for the mobility calculations is 300 K.
The effective masses of electrons (holes) are calculated by fitting parabolic functions of the CBM (VBM), which can be expressed as follows: (2)where k is the wave vector and Ek is the energy corresponding to the wave vector k.
2.3 Absorption coefficient calculation
The absorption coefficient (α(E)) is evaluated according to the following expression:36 (3)where ε1 and ε2 represent the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The imaginary part is calculated by a summation over empty states using the equation:37 (4)where the indices c and v refer to conduction and valence band states, respectively. μck represents the cell periodic part of the wavefunctions at the k point. The real part of the dielectric tensor ε1(ω) is obtained by a Kramers–Kronig transformation.
2.4 Photocurrent calculation
In this study, the photoinduced current is carried out in the framework of DFT calculations within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF-DFT).38,39 We first calculate the Hamiltonian Ĥe of the system without photons. After Ĥe is self-consistent, the electron–photon interaction Ĥe–ph is added to Ĥe as a perturbation for the subsequent analysis of photocurrent. The total Hamiltonian is written as: (5)where  is the momentum of the electron and A is the electromagnetic vector potential. For linear polarized light, A can be expressed in terms of the bosonic annihilation and creation operators, b and b†, as:40 (6)where r, r and  are the relative susceptibility, relative dielectric constant, and absolute dielectric constant, respectively. â represents the polarization of the field, and Iω is the photon flux defined as the number of photons per unit time per unit area. In the Hilbert space of the atomic orbital, the self-energy due to electron–photon interaction is:41,42 (7)where the matrix elements Mlm is defined as: (8)By employing the Keldysh equation,41,43 the zeroth order approximations of the lesser and greater Green's functions are written as:G< = Gr0(iΓLfL + iΓRfR + Σ<ph)Ga0 G> = Gr0(iΓL(1 − fL) + iΓR(1 − fR) + Σ>ph)Ga0(9)where Γα represents the line-width function of the electrodes α (α = L, R), and fα is the Fermi function. Gr0 and Ga0 are the retarded and advanced Green's functions (without photons), respectively. Finally, the photocurrent is calculated as follows:41–43 (10)where Tα(E) is the effective transmission coefficient.
3 Results and discussion
The lateral heterointerfaces are constructed via a superlattice model, where periodic boundary conditions are employed such that the supercell contains two heterointerfaces. To avoid the interactions between interfaces, a sufficiently large supercell is used, in which the width is up to 70 Å. In this work, two types of in-plane heterostructures are taken into account, i.e. the InS–InSe and InSe–InTe heterostructures. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the typical lattice structures of periodic lateral heterojunctions. To examine the thermal stability of lateral heterostructures, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations are carried out in this work. After heating the system at 500 K for 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs, no geometric reconstructions or broken bonds are found. Despite some small distortions, the hexagonal honeycomb structures are distinguished from the top and side views, and the interface boundary remains clean and clear as shown in Fig. 1(b). In Fig. 1(c), we plot the evolution of free energy for the InSe–InTe lateral heterointerface during AIMD simulation at 500 K, which clearly shows that the variation in free energy of the system is considerably small. These results demonstrate that the studied lateral heterostructures are stable even at temperatures up to 500 K.

The band structures of InS–InSe and InSe–InTe lateral heterostructures at their optimized structures are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Based on the orbital characteristics, the band structures are plotted using different colors, ranging from red (contributed by InSe) to blue (contributed by InS or InTe). Note that InX monolayers are indirect band-gap semiconductors (see the ESI†). However, for InX lateral heterostructures, the transition between indirect and direct band gaps is observed, in which the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are located at the Γ-point. The direct-band-gap lateral heterostructures are expected to have high solar energy conversion efficiency compared to indirect-band-gap monolayers. The calculated band gaps at the PBE level for InS–InSe and InSe–InTe heterostructures are 2.0 eV and 1.26 eV, respectively, which are moderately larger compared to the value of the MoSe2–WS2 (1.14 eV) lateral heterostructure.44 When the lattice constants deviate from their optimized structures, the band gap will decrease simultaneously (see the ESI†). In comparison to InS, InSe and InTe monolayers, in-plane InX heterostructures have smaller band gaps, which can be understood based on the fact that the band offset in the heterostructure regions is type II band alignment.

Unlike the vertical heterostructures where different layers are linked via the vdW interactions, lateral heterostructures are connected by the covalent bonds. In Fig. 2(c), the charge density difference of the InSe–InTe heterostructure is plotted, which is obtained by subtracting the charge density of the hybrid InSe–InTe heterostructure from that of the independent InSe and InTe monolayers. The results indicate that electrons accumulate at the InSe side. In atoms provide electrons to covalently bond with Se atoms, and the charge redistribution is localized within the interface region. To further illustrate the influence of the lateral heterostructure on the charge distributions, we plot in Fig. 2(d) and (e) the band-decomposed charge density of the VBM and the CBM at the Γ-point for the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure. From the results, we observe that the VBM is confined at the InTe side, while the CBM is confined at the InSe side. These results indicate that type II band alignment is formed in the heterojunction regions. Therefore, it is expected that in InX lateral heterostructures, the photoexcited electrons and holes will be efficiently separated, which is suited for optoelectronics and solar energy conversion.
To further understand the trends of band offset in InX heterostructures, we analyze the physical origin of the atomic orbitals at the band edge positions. The InSe–InTe lateral heterointerface is taken as an example. Fig. 3 shows that at the InSe side, the CBM is dominated by the In 5s* and Se 4p* states, while the VBM is mainly composed of the Se 4p-states. Meanwhile, at the InTe side, the CBM is dominated by the In 5s* and Te 5p* states, while the VBM is mainly composed of the Te 5p-orbitals (see Fig. S2 in the ESI† for more information). As the chalcogen species changes from Se to Te, the energy of the 5p orbital of Te is higher than that of the 4p orbital of Se, and therefore, the CBM and the VBM of InTe are higher than those of InSe, which leads to band bending at the lateral heterojunctions.

As illustrated in Fig. 3, the photo-generated electrons move from the InTe side to the InSe side, while holes move in the opposite direction, which significantly reduces the probability of carrier recombination, and eventually gives rise to the electron flow from the InTe to the InSe side of the lateral heterojunction. Note that in low-dimensional materials, excitonic effects have a strong influence on the optical properties due to the formation of excitions with large binding energy, which hinders the separation of election–hole pairs.45 In InSe and InTe monolayers, the strong interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes enhances the possibility of recombination. In the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructures, charge redistribution occurs at the interface. Using Bader charge analysis, we obtain the value of the charge transfer at the interface, which is about 0.32 e. When the charge redistribution reaches equilibrium, a built-in electric field is induced. Such an induced electric field can weaken the Coulomb interactions between the photoexcited electrons and holes and facilitate the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. The electrons and holes are physically separated and distribute on opposite constituents of the heterostructure. As a result, the lateral heterointerface acts as a charge separator, resulting in the enhancement of exciton dissociation. In this viewpoint, the promising characteristics of InSe–InTe lateral heterojunctions make them extremely appealing for applications in solar energy conversion and optoelectronic technology. Similar electronic band structures can also be verified in the InS–InSe lateral heterostructure.
In addition to the appropriate band structures and effective charge separations, charge mobility is another critical factor. In this study, the effective masses of electrons (me*) and holes (mh*) are studied, which can give a quantitative description of the transfer ability of electrons and holes along specific directions. The calculated me* and mh* values of the CBM and the VBM along the X → Γ direction are listed in Table 1. The predicated me* and mh* values are generally smaller than those of other 2D materials. For example, previous studies reported that the effective masses of electrons at the K point are 0.54 m0* (where m0* is the free-electron mass) for the MoS2 monolayer,46 which is almost 4 times larger than that of the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure (me* = 0.14 m0*).

To further examine the mobility properties of the lateral heterostructures, we provide theoretical prediction for the carrier mobility (μ). μ is estimated by the deformation potential (DP) model proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.47 The calculated μ as well as two important factors, namely the deformation potential Ed and the elastic modulus, C are presented in Table 1. For the InS–InSe lateral heterostructure, the hole mobility at the VBM along the interface direction is up to 1.14 × 103 cm2 (V s)−1 at the temperature of 300 K, which is about 2.6 times higher than the electron mobility. This could be ascribed to the smaller deformation potential of holes compared to that of the electrons. For the InSe–InTe heterostructure, the electron mobility is close to the hole mobility, both of which exceed 103 cm2 (V s)−1. The carrier mobilities of the studied lateral heterostructures are 1–2 orders of magnitude higher compared to those of MoS2.24 As a result, electrons and holes are easy to transfer in the opposite directions, leading to small probability of recombination for photogenerated carriers.
We now investigate the photovoltaic properties of InX lateral heterostructures. To this end, the scattering region is irradiated with linearly polarized light which propagates perpendicular to the heterointerface. The calculated photocurrent (Jph) at zero bias is shown in Fig. 4(a). In contrast to carbon nanotubes, which show discrete transitions between different bands,48 the induced photocurrents in InX heterostructures are smooth over a wide energy range. When an electron from the valence band adsorbs a photon with energy Eph and is excited to the conduction band, the electron–hole pairs are generated. These electron–hole pairs can be efficiently separated in the junction region and contribute to the photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the photocurrent of the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure is considerably larger compared to the value of the InS–InSe system, which can be ascribed to the small effective masses (see eqn (8)), enhanced optical absorption ability, low electron–hole recombination rate, and suitable energy alignment at the interface.

The incident light power density is 0.2 μW mm−2. (c) Averaged effective potential profile along the transport direction. Blue and red dashed lines represent the levels in the left and right electrodes, respectively. 
To get deeper insight into the details affecting the photocurrent, we calculate the optical absorption spectrum of InX lateral heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure shows an enhanced absorption in the visible light range, with the integrated intensity up to two times larger than the InS–InTe lateral heterostructure, indicating that the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure can harvest the visible light more efficiently. In addition, the photocurrents increase constantly as the wavelength decreases, and reach the maximum values at 485 nm for InSe–InTe and 535 nm for InS–InSe (see Fig. 4(a)). This trend is consistent with the optical absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 4(b). Note that in spite of higher absorption coefficient at the short-wavelength side, the photocurrents become smaller. This can be understood in terms of the high electron–hole recombination rate. When the heterojunction adsorbs a photon with high energy, the electron at the deep energy level of the valence band is excited to the conduction band, and recombines with the hole rapidly, leading to the large dark current density.49
Another important factor that influences the photocurrent is the energy band alignment. As has been discussed above, the presence of the band bending in the heterointerface region provides driving force and pushes electrons and holes to move in the opposite direction. This can be reflected in the average effective potential shown in Fig. 4(c). The potential difference between InSe and InTe sides is about 1.1 eV at the interface, which is over 2.4 times larger compared to the value of the InS–InSe heterostructure (the oscillation is due to the ionic potential). Obviously, if photon adsorption occurs in the junction region, the photoinduced electrons flow along the potential rise and holes move in the opposite direction. The photocurrent is therefore generated more easily in the InSe–InTe lateral heterointerface due to the larger effective potential difference.
To better compare our theoretical results with the experiments, we take the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure as an example and discuss its photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 5(a), an external bias voltage Vd is applied across the central region. The Jph–Vd curves of the InSe–InTe lateral heterointerface with the incident light power density (Pin) varying from 0.1 to 1 μW mm−2 are plotted in Fig. 5(b). A 485 nm laser is used as a light source in our simulations. Jsc and Voc are short-current and open-circuit voltage, which can be obtained from the intercepts of the curves in Fig. 5(b). The obtained Jsc as a function of Pin is plotted in Fig. 5(c). It can be seen that as Pin increases, Jsc increases linearly, whereas Voc (∼0.41 V) is found to be independent of the laser power. This is consistent with previous experiments.16,17 With these data, the output power density generated by the lateral heterojunction can be calculated by Pout = JphVd, which is shown in Fig. 5(d). As seen, under Pin = 1 μW mm−2, it peaks at a maximum value Pmaxout = 5.6 nW mm−2. Then, the photovoltaic performance can be evaluated by calculating the photoresponse (Rph), EQE, and energy conversion efficiency (η):20,52 (11)where e is the electron charge. Fph is the photon flux defined as the number of photons per unit time per unit area. (12)where h, c, and λ are Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the wavelength of light, respectively. η = Pout/Pin(13)

Table 2 summarizes the calculated results based on the NEGF-DFT theoretical method for the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure. For comparison, the values of several other reported 2D layered heterostructures are also listed. The fill factor (FF) is obtained based on the expression FF = Pmaxout/JscVoc. The maximum FF is 0.46, and the peak EQE in this device is up to 7.1%. The summarised results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate that the InSe–InTe lateral heterostructure shows better performance than TMD based heterojunctions, suggesting powerful potential in optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the electronic structures and optoelectronic properties of InX (X = S, Se, and Te) lateral heterointerfaces. Our results show that the studied systems remain stable at temperatures up to 500 K. A transition between indirect and direct band gaps is observed in our work, which is greatly favorable for the adsorption of the light. The proposed InX lateral heterostructures have type II band alignment, in which the VBM and the CBM are confined at different sides. In addition, the predicted small effective masses and high carrier mobilities suggest that charges are easy to transfer in the opposite directions. As a result, the use of lateral heterojunctions is an effective approach to enhance charge–hole separation and reduce their recombination. For the first time, we have evaluated the photoresponse and photovoltaic performance of the lateral heterostructure based on the first-principles calculations. Under illumination, an obvious photovoltaic effect with an EQE as high as 7.1% is observed. Further analysis indicates that the photocurrent can be influenced by the effective masses, optical absorption ability, electron–hole recombination rate, and energy alignment at the interface. The results presented here provide important fundamental insight into the nature of photogenerated charge carriers of lateral heterostructures within monolayer indium monochalcogenides, and provide theoretical reference for the design of new 2D composite based nano-devices.
