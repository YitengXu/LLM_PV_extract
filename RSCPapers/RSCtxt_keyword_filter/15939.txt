    , Accepted 12th March 2018First published on 13th March 2018AbstractA new wide bandgap copolymer (PBZ-m-CF3) based on meta-trifluoromethyl-p-alkoxyphenyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDTP-m-CF3) and difluorobenzotriazole (FBTZ) was successfully designed and synthesized for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). As a comparative material, a wide bandgap copolymer (PBZ1) based on p-alkoxyphenyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDTP) and FBTZ was synthesized by the same method. It was found that introducing trifluoromethyl into the meta-position of the phenyl group led to PBZ-m-CF3 possessing a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.49 eV, a wider optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.99 eV with a higher extinction coefficient of 6.51 × 104 cm−1 at 533 nm and a suitable hole mobility of 7.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with PBZ1 (a HOMO level of −5.27 eV, an Eoptg of 1.96 eV with an extinction coefficient of 5.23 × 104 cm−1 at 539 nm and a hole mobility of 7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Non-fullerene bulk heterojunction PSCs based on PBZ-m-CF3 as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor were fabricated by using toluene as the solvent and showed a higher PCE of 10.4% with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.2% compared with PSCs based on PBZ1: ITIC (a PCE of 5.8% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 49.8%). These results demonstrate that a benzodithiophene unit with meta-trifluoromethyl-p-alkoxyphenyl side chains is a promising candidate as an electron-rich building block for high performance PSCs.
Introduction
In the past two decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, easy fabrication and capability to be fabricated into large area and flexible devices through roll-to-roll processing.1–4 To date, PSCs based on an active layer that consists of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type organic semiconductor as the acceptor have been well studied and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have been reported for single junction solar cells.5–10 Compared to fullerene derivatives as the acceptor in PSCs, non-fullerene acceptors are becoming more and more competitive because of their advantages of easy synthesis, easily tunable energy levels, strong absorption in the visible region and good stability.11–13 It is very important to have complementary absorption spectra between the donor and the acceptor materials for highly efficient non-fullerene PSCs. Since many excellent non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC,14 IDIC,15,16 IEIC17 and others18 exhibit strong absorption in the range of 600–800 nm, the use of wide bandgap (WBG) polymers as donor materials will ensure that their spectra match well and they are able to make full use of sunlight. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient WBG polymer donors to improve the performance of non-fullerene PSCs.
As is well known, it is important that donor materials have appropriate energy levels, strong absorption spectra and high mobilities, which will directly affect the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) of the PSCs.19,20 For donor materials, a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is usually beneficial to obtaining a high Voc, which mainly depends on the HOMO energy level of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor.21,22 Benzodithiophene (BDT) is a good electron-donating unit with a large planar structure and has been extensively studied for donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers in high efficiency PSCs.23–25 Among the various polymer donor materials based on the BDT unit, thiophene-substituted BDT and phenyl-substituted BDT have been widely studied and found to demonstrate excellent performance in BDT-based two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers.26–30 Moreover, in order to improve the material performance, the thiophene and phenyl conjugated side chains in the BDT unit have been further modified, and good results have been achieved. For example, Zhang et al.31 introduced fluorine atoms into the thiophene conjugated side chain, which yielded a deeper HOMO energy level and higher PCE. Meanwhile, the modification of the phenyl conjugated side chain has also been well developed. For example, the meta-alkoxy-phenyl side group based on the BDT unit in D–A polymers exhibits a deeper HOMO level and higher Voc and PCE according to Zhang's report.32,33 The introduction of fluorine atoms into the phenyl conjugated side chain has also yielded a deeper HOMO level and higher Voc according to the literature.34–36 As a fluorinated functional group, the trifluoromethyl group has a strong electron-withdrawing effect and has attracted considerable interest in chemical, pharmaceutical and materials science because it can be used to adjust some important properties of materials, such as solubility, thermal and chemical stability and redox potentials.37–39 However, there is still very little research on it in PSCs.40 Therefore, we introduce the trifluoromethyl group into the phenyl conjugated side chain in the BDT unit and expect to obtain a deeper HOMO energy level and high Voc.
In this work, a novel 2D BDT monomer containing the trifluoromethyl group (BDTP-m-CF3) was designed and synthesized by introducing trifluoromethyl into the meta-position of the phenyl group. A new wide bandgap copolymer (PBZ-m-CF3) was synthesized using a Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between the BDTP-m-CF3 and difluorobenzotriazole (FBTZ) units. Meanwhile, as a control material, a wide bandgap copolymer (PBZ1) based on p-alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT (BDTP) as the donor unit and FBTZ as the acceptor unit was synthesized by the same method. It was found that introducing trifluoromethyl into the meta-position of the phenyl group led to PBZ-m-CF3 possessing a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.49 eV, a wider optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.99 eV with a higher extinction coefficient of 6.51 × 104 cm−1 at 533 nm and a suitable hole mobility of 7.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with PBZ1 (a HOMO level of −5.27 eV, an Eoptg of 1.96 eV with an extinction coefficient of 5.23 × 104 cm−1 at 539 nm and a hole mobility of 7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Non-fullerene bulk heterojunction PSCs based on PBZ-m-CF3 (and PBZ1) as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor were fabricated by using toluene as the solvent. As a result, the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based devices exhibit a higher PCE of 10.4% with a higher Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.2% compared with a PCE of 5.8% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 49.8% for the PBZ1: ITIC-based devices. This work demonstrates that a BDT unit with a meta-trifluoromethyl-p-alkoxyphenyl side chain is a promising candidate as an electron-rich building block for high performance PSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PBZ-m-CF3, PBZ1 and ITIC are shown in Fig. 1a. PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The detailed synthesis procedure and characterization of the monomer, BDTP-m-CF3, and the polymers, PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1, are described in the ESI.† High temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to measure the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the dispersity (Đ) of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1. The Mn of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 is 33.6 kDa and 27.3 kDa with a Đ of 1.74 and 1.88, respectively, which were measured by GPC with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the solvent and polystyrene as a standard at 160 °C. The two polymers exhibit excellent solubility in toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The thermal stability of the two polymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S1a in the ESI,† the two polymers have good thermal stability for application in PSCs with decomposition temperatures of over 390 °C at 5% weight loss. The DSC plots of the two polymers are shown in Fig. S1b in the ESI;† no obvious exotherms and endotherms were observed from 30 °C to 300 °C.

Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level were performed to predict the influence of the trifluoromethyl group on the properties of the frontier molecular orbitals, the dipole moment and the UV-vis absorption spectra. All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 package.41 The DFT hybrid model with the B3LYP function was used for the gas-phase geometry optimizations, and the 6-31G (d, p) basis set was used for all atoms. In order to simplify the calculation, we replaced the long side chains with methyl groups. We calculated the monomer (structures A and B) and one repeat unit (structures C and D), respectively. The calculated frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S2† and the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels and the dipole moment are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.06 eV/−1.01 eV, −5.35 eV/−1.30 eV, −4.97 eV/−1.85 eV, and −5.13 eV/−1.99 eV for structures A, B, C and D, respectively. The calculated results show that the trifluoromethyl-substituted structures have deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared with the unsubstituted analogues. With the introduction of trifluoromethyl, the dipole moment decreases from 2.0217 to 0.0012 Debye for structures A and B; however, the dipole moment increases from 1.5282 to 3.6063 Debye for structures C and D, respectively. Meanwhile, we calculated the UV-vis absorption spectra of one repeat unit (structures C and D) by TD-DFT theoretical calculation. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† we can see that the absorption intensity of structure D with the trifluoromethyl group is higher than that of structure C, suggesting that the introduction of the trifluoromethyl group is beneficial to the absorptivity.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of the two polymers in thin films, and their absorption spectra in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. S4a.† In solution, the polymers show similar absorption spectra, but PBZ-m-CF3 shows a stronger shoulder peak at 571 nm, which indicates that PBZ-m-CF3 can exhibit strong intermolecular aggregation in solution at room temperature. In the solid film, PBZ-m-CF3 shows a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum and a stronger shoulder peak compared to PBZ1. The maximum absorption peak of PBZ-m-CF3 is at 533 nm and a shoulder peak can be observed at 575 nm, which indicates that there is strong intermolecular π–π stacking interaction in the thin film. Meanwhile, the PBZ-m-CF3 film has a higher extinction coefficient of 6.51 × 104 cm−1 at 533 nm compared with that of the PBZ1 film (5.23 × 104 cm−1 at 539 nm) (see Fig. S4b in the ESI†), which is consistent with the calculation results obtained by TD-DFT theoretical calculation. The absorption edge (λonset) of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 is located at 622 nm and 632 nm in the thin films, respectively, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.99 eV and 1.96 eV, which is beneficial for complementary absorption with the narrow bandgap acceptor ITIC from 300 to 800 nm. PBZ-m-CF3 shows a higher hole mobility of 7.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBZ1) measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†); the high mobility may be due to enhanced intermolecular interaction.
The electrochemical properties of the two polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a standard three electrode electrochemical cell. Fig. S5† shows the cyclic voltammograms of the two polymers films. The onset oxidation potentials (φox) of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 are 0.78 V and 0.56 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 are determined to be −5.49 eV and −5.27 eV, respectively, according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV). The onset reduction potentials (φred) of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 are −1.49 V and −1.65 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 are determined to be −3.22 eV and −3.06 eV, respectively, according to the equation ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBZ-m-CF3 have dropped due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the trifluoromethyl group, which is consistent with the results obtained by DFT theoretical calculation. Compared with PBZ1, PBZ-m-CF3 possesses a deeper HOMO energy level, which is beneficial for achieving high Voc when the polymer is blended with ITIC as the active layer.
In order to investigate the crystallinity of the two polymers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1 films. The PBZ-m-CF3 film showed a sharper and intense (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.7°, which corresponds to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl side chains with a d-spacing value of 23.8 Å. In contrast, the PBZ1 film exhibited weak diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 4.8° with a d-spacing value of 18.4 Å. Moreover, both polymers exhibited clear and strong (010) diffraction peaks. (010) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.1° and 2θ = 24.7° were observed for PBZ-m-CF3 and PBZ1, respectively, which correspond to π–π stacking distances of 3.69 Å and 3.60 Å, indicating the strong intermolecular interaction between the polymer backbones.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the two polymers, PSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. The active layer with the polymer as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor was spin-coated from toluene solution. The detailed optimization processes of the devices based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC are recorded in Fig. S7 and Table S3† for the D/A blend ratios, Fig. S8 and Table S4† for the thermal annealing temperature and Fig. S9 and Table S5† for the thermal annealing time. The optimal D/A weight ratio in the blend active layer is 1:1 (w/w). As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based PSCs without any post-treatment present a PCE of 7.9% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 15.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 52.3%. In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, the thermal annealing treatment was carried out. We can see that the devices with thermal annealing treatment at 160 °C for 10 min display the highest PCE of 10.4% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a higher Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 60.2%. As a control material, when the D/A weight ratio in the blend active layer is 1:1 (w/w), the PBZ1: ITIC-based PSCs without any post-treatment present a PCE of 4.3% with a lower Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 14.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 39.5%. After thermal annealing treatment at 160 °C for 10 min, a PCE of 5.8% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 49.8% is obtained. It is obvious that the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based devices show higher Voc, Jsc, and FF in comparison with the PBZ1: ITIC-based devices. Furthermore, we investigated the thermal stability of the devices based on polymers: ITIC in a glovebox (see Fig. S10 in the ESI†). After being heated at 80 °C for 14 h, the devices based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC still retain 81% of their original PCE; however, the PCE of the devices based on PBZ1: ITIC drops to 52% of the original value. These results indicate that the introduction of the trifluoromethyl group is beneficial for the thermal stability of the device. Since the meta-alkoxy position has been proven to be the optimum for higher PCE compared to the para-alkoxy-phenyl side group,32,33, we also compared the photovoltaic performance of PBZ-m-CF3 with that of the m-alkoxy-phenyl substituted analogue (PBFZ-OP)42 under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S6 in the ESI,† the PSCs based on PBFZ-OP: ITIC (1:1, w/w) showed a decreased PCE of 9.6% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 17.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58.9%. The high Jsc values of the devices with thermal annealing treatment can be confirmed from the EQE spectra in Fig. 2c. The devices show a broad photo-response from 300 nm to 800 nm, and the maximum EQE value reached 84% for the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based devices and 72% for the PBZ1: ITIC-based devices with thermal annealing, which indicates efficient photon-harvesting and charge collection in the active layer. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra are in agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves within 5% error.

The charge carrier mobilities of the blend films were measured by the SCLC method. The hole mobility (μh) was measured with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. The electron mobility (μe) was measured with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S2 in the ESI,† the μh of the blend film based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC is calculated to be 3.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (3.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBZ1: ITIC) and 5.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (4.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBZ1: ITIC) for the as-cast devices and the thermally annealed devices, respectively. The μe of the blend film is calculated to be 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (1.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBZ1: ITIC) and 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBZ1: ITIC) for the as-cast devices and the thermally annealed devices, respectively. The PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based devices showed a higher and more balanced μh/μe ratio (1.28) compared with the PBZ1: ITIC-based devices with a μh/μe ratio of 1.46 after the thermal annealing treatment, which is beneficial to obtaining higher Jsc and FF.
The relationship between Voc and Jph values and different light intensities (Plight) was measured to study the charge recombination mechanism with or without the thermal annealing treatment. The slope of Vocversus log(Plight) could indicate the charge recombination mechanism. If the slope is equal to 2kT/q, it indicates that trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination is dominant, while if the slope is equal to 1kT/q, it indicates that bimolecular recombination is dominant.43 As shown in Fig. 2d, the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based device shows a slope of 1.32kT/q (1.80kT/q for PBZ1: ITIC) without the annealing treatment and a slope of 1.25kT/q (1.52kT/q for PBZ1: ITIC) with the thermal annealing treatment. The results indicate that the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based devices showed weaker trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination compared to the PBZ1: ITIC-based devices and trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination could be suppressed by the thermal annealing treatment compared to that without the annealing treatment. The relationship between Jph and Plight can be described by Jph∝(Plight)S, where S denotes the extent of bimolecular recombination. S values close to 1 indicate that the bimolecular recombination is weak.44 As shown in Fig. 3a, S values of 0.93 based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC and 0.83 based on PBZ1: ITIC for the non-annealed devices and S values of 0.99 based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC and 0.90 based on PBZ1: ITIC for the thermally annealed devices were obtained, indicating that the thermal annealing treatment can inhibit the bimolecular recombination and the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC-based device showed weaker bimolecular recombination compared with the PBZ1: ITIC-based device. These results suggest that bimolecular recombination can be significantly suppressed by introducing trifluoromethyl into the polymer. The weaker bimolecular recombination should be beneficial to obtaining the higher Jsc and FF.

A photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was carried out to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior between the polymers and ITIC in the blend films. As shown in Fig. 3b–d, the selected excitation wavelengths of PBZ-m-CF3, PBZ1 and ITIC were 530 nm, 530 nm and 690 nm according to their maximum absorptions, respectively. Compared with the PL spectra of pure PBZ-m-CF3, PBZ1 and ITIC, those of the polymer: ITIC blend films display more than 85% PL quenching without any post-treatment. Moreover, the blend films show higher PL quenching after thermal annealing. Additionally, the devices based on PBZ-m-CF3 show higher quenching efficiency compared with the devices based on PBZ1. The high PL quenching efficiency indicates that the devices exhibit effective photo-induced charge transfer between the polymer and ITIC, which is consistent with the high Jsc values in the devices.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to investigate the surface and bulk morphology of the active layers. As shown in Fig. 4, in the AFM images, the surface of the blend films without thermal annealing is relatively rough with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 1.81 nm and 1.25 nm for PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC and PBZ1: ITIC, respectively. After the thermal annealing treatment, the blend films exhibit a lower RMS roughness value of 0.96 nm and 1.23 nm for PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC and PBZ1: ITIC, respectively. Furthermore, after the thermal annealing treatment, the PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC blend films show a more ordered and smaller phase separation in the phase images. In the TEM images, the blend films based on PBZ-m-CF3: ITIC show a more fibrillar structure with interpenetrating networks than the blend films based on PBZ1: ITIC, which is beneficial to charge separation and transport, and thus a higher and more balanced charge carrier mobility can be achieved.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel wide bandgap copolymer (PBZ-m-CF3) based on BDTP-m-CF3 as the donor unit and FBTZ as the acceptor unit was successfully designed and synthesized for efficient non-fullerene PSCs. It was found that introducing trifluoromethyl into the meta-position of the phenyl group led to PBZ-m-CF3 possessing a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.49 eV, a wider optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.99 eV with a higher extinction coefficient of 6.51 × 104 cm−1 at 533 nm and a suitable hole mobility of 7.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with PBZ1 (a HOMO level of −5.27 eV, an Eoptg of 1.96 eV with an extinction coefficient of 5.23 × 104 cm−1 at 539 nm and a hole mobility of 7.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Non-fullerene bulk heterojunction PSCs based on PBZ-m-CF3 as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor were fabricated by using toluene as the solvent and showed a higher PCE of 10.4% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.2% compared with the PSCs based on PBZ1: ITIC (a PCE of 5.8% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 49.8%). These results demonstrate that a BDT unit with meta-trifluoromethyl-p-alkoxyphenyl side chains is a promising candidate as an electron-rich building block for high performance PSCs.
