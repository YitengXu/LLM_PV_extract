    , Accepted 23rd April 2015First published on 23rd April 2015AbstractFour benzodithiophene (BDT)–thiophene (T) copolymers with conjugated side chains containing electron-withdrawing ethylrhodanine acceptor units, PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, were designed and synthesized for investigating the effect of side chains on the physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of the conjugated polymers. All the four copolymers possess an identical conjugated backbone of alternative benzodithiophene–thiophene, but different side chains on BDT and thiophene units, respectively. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with these polymers as donors and PC70BM as acceptors exhibit an initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.61% for PHDBDT-T-R, 2.32% for PEHBDT-T-R, 1.46% for PHDBDT-T-TR, and 2.36% for PEHBDT-T-TR. After the treatment with 3 vol% DIO additive and with methanol, the highest PCE was increased up to 1.01%, 4.04%, 3.47%, and 4.25% for PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, respectively, with significantly increased Jsc and FF. The effects of methanol treatment on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs can be ascribed to the increased carrier transport, improved exciton dissociation and optimized phase separation of the active layer. This work indicates that side-chain engineering plays a key role in molecular structures and optoelectronic properties.
Introduction
Solar energy as a green energy resource has attracted great attention. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been developed rapidly in recent years owing to their advantages of low cost, light weight, easy fabrication and the ability to be fabricated into large area flexible devices.1–5 The most successful PSCs to date are devices based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend active layer of conjugated polymer electron donors and fullerene derivative electron acceptors (such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM)).6 The priority in the studies of PSCs is how to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices. PCE is proportional to the values of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the PSC. The Jsc depends on the efficiencies of light absorption of the active layer, exciton diffusion to and dissociation at the D–A interface, charge transportation in the active layer, and charge collection on the electrodes. Voc is mainly proportional to the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor (e.g. PC70BM) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymer donor. FF is related to the charge carrier mobilities and device fabrication conditions. In order to increase the PCE of the PSCs, it is very important to design and synthesize new conjugated polymer donors with a narrower bandgap (broader absorption) for higher Jsc, relatively lower-lying HOMO energy level for higher Voc, and higher hole mobility for higher Jsc and larger FF.
Among high performance conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer photovoltaic materials, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely investigated and used as a donor unit due to its good electron-donating properties, rigid coplanar structure with stronger π–π intermolecular interactions, and the possibility of side chain manipulation for suitable solubility and processability.7–9 3-Ethylrhodanine is a dye unit, usually used as an electron-withdrawing group, which could greatly improve the light absorption ability, and thus, a high Jsc value could be achieved in the corresponding photovoltaic devices.10
Equally important is that some studies have been directed towards understanding the effects of side chains on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on D–A copolymers. Recent work suggests that for the same conjugated polymer backbone the type (alkyl, alkoxy, aryl), shape, topology (linear, branched) and distribution (uniform, alternating, random) of side chains have a large impact on the morphology (crystallinity, π-stacking orientations), charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the polymers.11–17 Thus the side chain effect should also be fully explored in the design of new copolymers for highly efficient solar cells. In previous work, our group has reported some side chain engineering of the BDT–bithiazole-based D–A copolymers and a PCE of 3.71% was achieved in combination with the PC70BM acceptor.11 It is worth mentioning that high PCEs of 8–10% were achieved just by the side chain engineering of BDT–T–S and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene copolymers.8,17,18
On the basis of the above consideration, we herein designed and synthesized four main chain–side chain D–A polymers (PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, Fig. 1) based on BDT and thiophene with alkoxy side chains onto the BDT unit and an end-capping ethylrhodanine group as an electro-withdrawing conjugated side chain on the thiophene unit. Notably, during the preparation of this manuscript, the synthesis of the polymer based on 3-ethylrhodanine was independently reported by Tan and co-workers.19 For the four polymers, we chose 2-hexyldecyloxy (HD) and 2-ethylhexyloxy (EH) as side chains on the BDT unit to systematically investigate the effects of side chain shape and size (EH vs. HD) on the solubility, light absorption, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and charge transport properties of the resulting polymers as well as on the morphology and photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. On the other hand, the inserted thienylvinyl between thiophene and end-capping 3-ethylrhodanine group gives a chance to study the influence of the extended conjugated side chain on the optoelectronic properties of the copolymers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures and synthesis routes of monomers and the four polymers are outlined in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR have an identical BDT–thiophene copolymer backbone but different side chains attached on BDT and thiophene units. PEHBDT-T-R and PEHBDT-T-TR have ethylhexyloxyl side chains, while PHDBDT-T-R and PHDBDT-T-TR have more branched hexyloctyloxyl side chains attached on the BDT unit to further improve the solubility of the resulting polymers (Fig. 1). 3-Ethylrhodanine was chosen as an end-capping side chain to build these main chain–side chain type D–A copolymers due to its intrinsic electron-deficient character. Compared with PEHBDT-T-R and PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-TR and PHDBDT-T-TR possess extended conjugated side chains with the aim of red-shifting the absorption spectra and lowering the bandgaps of the polymers. The choice of these different side chains is convenient for fine-tuning of the optoelectronic properties of the resulting polymers.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of the monomers and the four copolymers. 
As outlined in Scheme 1, two monomers M3 and M4 based on the BDT unit were prepared according to the procedure in the literature.20 Compound 1 was synthesized by the bromination reaction of thiophene-3-carbaldehyde. Then thiophene-based monomer M1 containing the 3-ethylrhodanine moiety was synthesized by the Knoevenagel reaction between compound 1 and 3-ethylrhodanine. Monomer M2 with an extended thienylvinyl moiety was synthesized via the stepwise synthetic protocol. First, compound 2 was synthesized according to published procedures.21 Next this compound was converted into compound 3via the Vilsmeier reaction. Monomer M2 was subsequently obtained by the Knoevenagel reaction like M1. Compounds 1–3, M1, and M2 were satisfactorily characterized by 1H NMR and EI or MALDI-TOF spectroscopies. The four new D–A copolymers were synthesized successfully via the Stille-type copolymerization of a distannane monomer (M3 or M4) with 3-ethylrhodanine-based monomers M1 and M2. Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results and thermal properties of the copolymers.

The polymers can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature or with slight heating. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) values of the four polymers were measured by the GPC method (against polystyrene standards) in chloroform at room temperature (Table 1). Among the four copolymers, PHDBDT-T-R gives the lowest weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 17.7 kDa with a PDI of 1.86 (Table 1), whereas PEHBDT-T-R shows the highest Mw of 50.8 kDa with a moderate PDI of 2.68 (Table 1). PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-TR have a moderate Mw of 39.5 kDa and 25.2 kDa, respectively.
The thermal stability of conjugated polymers is very important for their application in optoelectronic devices. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement. The four polymers have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss (Td) at above 290 °C, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. PHDBDT-T-R and PEHBDT-T-R show relatively high Td of 327 °C and 329 °C, respectively (Fig. 2), which are higher than those of PHDBDT-T-TR (316 °C) and PEHBDT-T-TR (299 °C). The results suggest that the absence of a thienylvinyl moiety between the thiophene and 3-ethylrhodanine as conjugated side chains benefits improvement of the thermal stability of the resulting polymers. Obviously, the thermal stability of the polymers is adequate for applications in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

Optical properties
Optical properties of these polymers have been investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in dilute chloroform solution and as thin solid films (Fig. 3). The detailed absorption data including the absorption maximum wavelength (λmax) in both solution and films, the absorption edge (onset wavelength of the absorption peak, λedge) of the polymer films, and optical bandgaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3a, in solution PEHBDT-T-R exhibits two distinct absorption bands. The first absorption band with a λmax at 435 nm is assigned to the delocalized excitonic π–π* transition. The second absorption band located in a longer wavelength range with a λmax at 538 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states between the main-chain donor and side-chain acceptor.22 As for PHDBDT-T-R, it shows a similar absorption shape to that of PEHBDT-T-R except for a shoulder peak at the longer wavelength range. In comparison with PHDBDT-T-R and PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-TR with extended side chains have just one broad absorption band ranging from 300 to 700 nm with λmax of 471 and 475 nm, respectively. This can be explained as that the introduction of a thienylvinyl moiety between thiophene and 3-ethylrhodanine weakens the ICT absorption between the main-chain donor and side-chain acceptor. The weakened ICT absorption leads to a blue-shifted ICT band, which overlaps with the π–π* transition absorption band and finally exhibits one broad absorption band. Compared to the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions, the absorption spectra of the films are broadened and the λmax values are red-shifted (Fig. 3b). This phenomenon results from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid films, which may be related to the increased extent of π–π* stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the film, or both.23 The absorption edges (λedge) of PEHBDT-T-R and PEHBDT-T-TR films are ∼20 nm red-shifted compared to those of the PHDBDT-T-R and PHDBDT-T-TR films, respectively. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR are 1.92, 1.86, 1.90, and 1.84 eV, respectively, calculated from λedge of their solid state films (Table 2). Obviously, the polymers with EH as a side chain possess lower bandgaps than those of HD as a side chain. It may be due to that the more branched HD side chain on the BDT unit damaged the coplanarity of the main chain. On the other hand, the result showed that the extended conjugated side chains attached onto the thiophene unit can red-shift the absorption edges and lower the bandgaps, which are favorable for improving the Jsc of PSCs based on these polymers (e.g.PHDBDT-T-Rvs.PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-Rvs.PEHBDT-T-TR) as donors.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure the electronic energy levels of conjugated polymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers are crucial for application as photovoltaic materials in PSCs, which can be estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox/red) in the voltammograms. The CVs of the four polymer films were measured on a Pt electrode in a 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6–acetonitrile solution (Fig. 4). The results of the electrochemical properties are also summarized in Table 2. The CV curve was recorded by using an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference, which was calibrated against the redox potential of a ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+ measured as 0.39 V vs. Ag/AgCl), whose energy level was assumed to be 4.80 eV below the vacuum level. Thus, HOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.41) (eV), where Eox/red is the oxidation/reduction onset potential of the sample vs. Ag/AgCl.

The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR are observed to be 1.15, 1.07, 1.10, and 1.04 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, and the corresponding HOMO energy levels calculated according to the above equation are −5.56, −5.48, −5.51, and −5.45 eV, respectively. Regarding the threshold HOMO energy level for air stable conjugated polymers, it is estimated to be −5.2 eV.24 The deep HOMO energy levels of the four copolymers can be beneficial for their chemical stability in ambient conditions. Moreover, the lower-lying HOMO energy levels of the copolymers are expected for higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs with the copolymers as donor materials because the Voc is usually proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.25 Among them, the HOMO energy level of PEHBDT-T-TR is the highest, implying that this polymer could show a relatively lower Voc compared to the other three polymers. Additionally, the HOMO energy levels of PHDBDT-T-R (−5.56 eV) and PHDBDT-T-TR (−5.51 eV) with HD as a side chain on BDT unit are lower than their analogues PEHBDT-T-R (−5.48 eV) and PEHBDT-T-TR (−5.45 eV) with EH as a side chain, which indicates that the bulky and more branched alkoxyl can deepen the HOMO energy levels.9
On the other hand, the onset reduction potential (Ered) values are observed as −1.02, −1.08, −0.95, and −1.03 V vs. Ag/AgCl for PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, respectively (Fig. 4b). Accordingly, the calculated LUMO energy levels of the polymers are −3.39, −3.33, −3.46, and −3.38 eV, respectively. Evidently, the different side chains both on BDT and thiophene units have some effects on the LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers. Moreover, the LUMO energy levels of the polymers are all located within a suitable range and are much higher than that of PC70BM (ca. −3.91 eV),26 thus, efficient exciton dissociation could be expected to occur in their corresponding PSCs. A complete picture of the energy levels and band structure of the four polymers and PC70BM is presented in Fig. 5. As can be seen from Fig. 5, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers are close to the ideal range.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the effects of different side chains on the photovoltaic properties of the BDT–thiophene-based copolymers, bulk heterojunction PSC devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The active layers were spin-coated from DCB solution of the polymer:PC70BM blend. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin-coating process and measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 6 shows the typical current density–voltage curves (J–V) of the PSCs based on the blends of polymer:PC70BM under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and Fig. 7 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs.

First, the blend ratio of the polymer donor and PC70BM acceptor was optimized. For example, when the mixing ratio of PHDBDT-T-R and PC70BM increased from 1:1 to 1:2 to 1:3, the PCE of the device continuously increased from 0.17% to 0.25% to 0.61% (Table 3). It can be observed that an increase in the PC70BM content resulted in a slight increase in Voc and also elevated Jsc and FF. It is obvious that the optimal blend ratio for this polymer was determined to be around 1:3. The blend ratio of the other three polymers was also optimized. It is found that the different polymers have their own optimal blend ratio and the determined optimal blend ratios are 1:2, 1:2 and 1:1.5, for PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-TR, respectively. For each optimal blend ratio, the best PCE of the four polymers are 0.61%, 2.32%, 1.46% and 2.36%, respectively.
Next, we investigated the effect of the high boiling point additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) on the photovoltaic properties of the copolymers (Table 3). Except for PHDBDT-T-R, the other three polymers achieved improved PCEs. For example, the Voc, Jsc and FF values of PEHBDT-T-R were improved significantly, when a small amount of DIO (3%, by volume) was added, resulting in remarkable improvement of PCE (Table 3). While when 3 vol% DIO was added to the PEHBDT-T-TR based cell, the Jsc value improved, whereas Voc and FF values remained unchanged. Under these optimized conditions, the maximal PCEs of 3.31% (Voc = 0.87 V, Jsc = 7.79 mA cm−2, FF = 48.89%), 1.64% (Voc = 0.93 V, Jsc = 3.89 mA cm−2, FF = 45.33%) and 2.80% (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 8.79 mA cm−2, FF = 46.20%) were achieved for the PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-TR based devices (Table 3). Inspired by recent work27–32 on post-solvent treatment, we tried to employ a polar solvent methanol to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. From Table 3 and Fig. 6, one can see that the photovoltaic performance of all the copolymers had been enhanced after the solvent treatment. For instance, the PCE of PEHBDT-T-TR is further improved up to 4.25% with an increased Voc from 0.69 V to 0.87 V, a Jsc from 8.79 mA cm−2 to 9.36 mA cm−2, and a FF from 46.20% to 52.30%. The improved efficiency may originate from enhanced charge transport, or improved efficiency of carrier collection, which results from the creation of an optimal morphology under the conditions of DIO as the processing additive and treatment with methanol. This is supported by results of the hole mobility measurements, morphology studies, and photoluminescence (PL) quenching (vide infra). The highest PCE of 4.04% for PEHBDT-T-R with a small alkyl chain (EH) on BDT is significantly higher than that of the analogous polymer PHDBDT-T-R (1.01%) with a relatively bulky alkyl chain (HD) on BDT; similarly, the highest PCE of PEHBDT-T-TR (4.25%) is higher than that of PHDBDT-T-TR (3.47%). The results indicate that the alkyl chain on BDT has a great influence on the PCE of the copolymers. In addition, the PCEs of PHDBDT-T-TR (3.47%) and PEHBDT-T-TR (4.25%) are higher than the analogous polymers PHDBDT-T-R (1.01%) and PEHBDT-T-R (4.04%) mainly owing to the higher Jsc of the former, which shows that the introduction of the thienylvinyl unit to extend conjugated side chains is favorable for improving the Jsc and PCE.
One can observe that the best cells based on the four polymers show relatively high Voc values (above 0.85 V), which can be readily understood from their lower-lying HOMO energy levels (Table 2). The highest Jsc values of PSCs based on PEHBDT-T-R (8.61 mA cm−2) and PEHBDT-T-TR (9.36 mA cm−2) are higher than those of Jsc values based on PHDBDT-T-R (3.82 mA cm−2) and PHDBDT-T-TR (7.56 mA cm−2), which are consistent with the relatively broader absorption spectra and lower bandgaps (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Fig. 7 displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the photovoltaic devices under monochromatic light illumination. PSCs based on these polymers exhibit relatively broad EQE responses ranging from 300 to 700 nm with maximum EQE values of 20% at 488 nm, 43% at 460 nm, 46% at 465 nm and 63% at 468 nm for PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR and PEHBDT-T-TR, respectively. Compared to the absorption spectra of polymer films (Fig. 2b), the broadened EQE responses in the visible region can be attributed to both the intrinsic absorption of the polymers and the response of PC70BM. Although the EQE value is not very high, the response covers a reasonable broad spectrum (300–700 nm) and a relatively high EQE value over 50% around 470 nm, which elucidates the obviously higher Jsc of PEHBDT-T-TR-based cells relative to the other three polymers. Overall, the EQE results are consistent with the Jsc values of the corresponding PSCs.
Hole mobility
Hole mobility is an important parameter for photovoltaic donor materials. Here, hole mobilities of the four polymers/PC70BM blend film with the optimal D–A ratio were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Au and estimated through the Mott–Gurney equation.33 For the hole-only devices, SCLC is described by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3exp[0.891γ(V/L)0.5], where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymers, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, E0 is the characteristic field, J is the current density, and L is the thickness of the film. Fig. 8 shows the ln(JL3/V2) vs. (V/L)0.5 plots of the polymers measured by the SCLC method. According to the above equation and the curves shown in Fig. 8, the calculated hole mobilities are 1.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.04 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR blend films, respectively. The lower hole mobility of the PHDBDT-T-R-based blend film could be related to its lower molecular weight (see Table 1). This should be responsible for its poor photovoltaic performance. On the other hand, PEHBDT-T-TR-based blend film showed the highest mobility of all, which could contribute in part to the higher Jsc and FF values of the device.

Morphological studies
The morphology of the photoactive layer plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs along with other photo-physical properties and in several situations the photovoltaic performance of the device strongly depends on its morphological features. To explore the effects of methanol treatment on the morphology and device performance of polymer/PC70BM film, we observed the surface morphologies of the blend films using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig 9a, when 3 vol% DIO was added, the active layer of PEHBDT-T-TR displayed a root-mean-square (RMS) of 3.89 nm. After treating the active layer with methanol, regular columnar domains formed in the phase image, and the surface of the blend film based on PEHBDT-T-TR became relatively rough with an increased RMS of 8.07 nm (see Fig. 9b). As some of the polar solvent molecules penetrated the active layer, PC70BM particles redistributed and aggregated to reduce the contact areas with the polar solvents.34 As a result, solvent-dependent PC70BM migration within the polymer chains enabled the formation of nanoscale phase separation of the blend films (Fig. 9b). This relatively coarse surface and more ordered structure are beneficial to the charge transportation, thus leading to an increase in Jsc and FF as well as the device efficiency. Obviously, the appropriate domain sizes and phase separation can produce the best photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, similar results can be found from the other three polymers. Fig. 9c–e give the AFM height images of the other three polymers after methanol treatment. It can be seen that the active layers of PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, and PHDBDT-T-TR displayed RMS of 3.17, 5.31, and 4.60 nm, respectively. Obviously, the active layer of PEHBDT-T-R and PHDBDT-T-TR show relatively rougher surfaces than PHDBDT-T-R. In view of the superior photovoltaic performance of PEHBDT-T-R and PHDBDT-T-TR-based PSCs, the result further suggests that relatively larger phase separation is more favorable for improving the photovoltaic performance.

The imaging size is 3 μm × 3 μm for each panel. 
Photoluminescence
In order to gain more insight into methanol treatment for enhanced efficiency, PL quenching studies in the presence of the PC70BM acceptor were carried out.27,28,30 We chose PHDBDT-T-TR as an example because its PCE changed significantly after treating with methanol (see Table 3). Fig. 10 gives the PL spectra of the pristine PHDBDT-T-TR and PHDBDT-T-TR:PC70BM (3 vol% DIO) with and without methanol treatment. The pristine PHDBDT-T-TR displays emission bands in the range of 600–800 nm with a peak at 671 nm. Upon blending PHDBDT-T-TR with PC70BM, the PL is significantly quenched as shown in Fig. 10. The PL is further quenched after treating the PHDBDT-T-TR:PC70BM blend film with methanol. This effective PL quenching suggests that the exciton separation is highly efficient in polymer:PC70BM blend films. The more effective quenching in the PHDBDT-T-TR:PC70BM blend with methanol treatment than that without treatment implies that the feasibility of the exciton dissociation process in polymer:PC70BM blend film is increased further after the methanol treatment. Therefore, the PL quenching studies reveal that the polymer:PC70BM blend film with methanol treatment has more favorable features for a higher Jsc.

Conclusions
Four main chain–side chain D–A copolymers, PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, containing the same backbone of alternative BDT–thiophene but different side chains on BDT and thiophene units were designed, synthesized and utilized for BHJ PSCs. We found that the type and shape of the side chains have great influences on the solubility, light absorption, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and charge transport properties of the resulting polymers as well as the morphology and photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. Optical and electrochemical properties showed that the introduction of the thienylvinyl unit between the thiophene and 3-ethylrhodanine as conjugated side chains can slightly reduce bandgaps and elevate HOMO levels of the polymers. BHJ PSCs based on the four polymers were prepared and the device fabrication conditions, including the different blend ratios of the polymer donor and acceptor, the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and methanol treatment, have been optimized in detail. The effects of methanol treatment on the enhancement in photovoltaic performance especially for the Jsc and FF of the PSCs are demonstrated to originate from the increased exciton separation efficiency, charge carrier mobilities and the formation of fiber-like interpenetrating network morphologies. After systematically optimizing, the best PCEs were improved up to 1.01%, 4.04%, 3.47%, and 4.25% for PHDBDT-T-R, PEHBDT-T-R, PHDBDT-T-TR, and PEHBDT-T-TR, respectively, mainly due to significantly increased Jsc and FF. This work could provide some insight into side chain engineering to efficiently construct photovoltaic polymers.
Experimental section
Measurements and characterization
Solvents were dried and distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification. 1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and (CH3)3SiH as the internal reference. Mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrometer and MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were determined on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard and chloroform (CHCl3) as an eluent. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and under a nitrogen flow rate of 100 mL min−1. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation, with a glassy carbon disc coated with polymer film as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The morphology of blend films was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instrument Multimode Nanoscope IIIA) using the tapping mode.
PSC device fabrication and characterization
PSCs were fabricated with ITO glass as a positive electrode, Ca/Al as a negative electrode and the blend film of polymer/PC70BM between them as a photosensitive layer. The patterned ITO glass was precleaned by ultrasonication with detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol each for 20 min, then treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber (Jelight Co.) for 20 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin-cast on precleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevious P VP AI 4083 H. C. Stark, Germany) at 3000 rpm for 40 s and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air, and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was about 40 nm. After that, the device was transferred to a glovebox. The photosensitive layers, a blend solution of the polymer and PC70BM with the polymer concentration of 13.3 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), were spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Finally, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited in vacuum on the active layer under a pressure of ca. 9 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the investigated device was 5 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were studied on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit in a dry box under an inert atmosphere. A xenon lamp (150 W) coupled with an AM 1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The hole mobility was calculated by fitting the dark J–V curves for the hole-only devices to the SCLC model at low voltages, in which the current density is given by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3exp[0.891γ(V/L)0.5], where ε0εr represents the permittivity of the material, μ is the mobility, γ is the field activation factor, and L the thickness of the active layer. The applied bias voltage is corrected for the built-in potential so that V = Vapplied − Vbi.
