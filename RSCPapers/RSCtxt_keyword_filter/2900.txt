    , Accepted 10th May 2016First published on 10th May 2016AbstractThree novel 1,8-naphthalimide-based small molecular acceptors (NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8) were designed and synthesized. The LUMO levels of these three small molecules were high-lying, which significantly reduce the energy loss between the wide optical band gap polymer (WBGP) PBDTBT-C12 and the acceptors and result in a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells. In addition, these three acceptors are planar, crystalline and H-aggregated in the solid state, which can facilitate the electron transport in blend films and lead to superior electron mobility and short circuit current (Jsc). A PCE of 4.05% with a Voc of 1.08 V was obtained for PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) in an active layer thickness of 35 nm. Such a PCE is comparable to that of PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based optimized devices (4.07%) and better than devices with an active layer thickness of approximately 30 nm (2.72%). Besides, 35 nm is the thinnest active layer thickness for PSCs with a PCE above 4% and the absorption onset of PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-blend films was as low as 630 nm, leading to a significantly high average visible transmittance up to 76.1%. Ultimately, a relatively high PCE and ultrahigh transmittance were achieved simultaneously, demonstrating that 1,8-naphthalimide-based small molecules are promising acceptors for tandem or semi-transparent PSCs.
Introduction
Wide optical band gap polymers (WBGPs) (Eg > 1.80 eV) are often used as donor materials for the front cell of tandem bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), in which the WBGPs usually convert short wavelength sunlight to electricity and provide the overall cell a high open circuit voltage (Voc).1–3 Moreover, WBGPs have shown advantages for the fabrication of semi-transparent PSCs, which are of great interest for photovoltaic applications where a portion of light is required to be transmitted through the solar cell.4 Until now, most studies for semi-transparent PSCs focused on the transparency electrode; the investigation of the active layer of semi-transparent PSCs has been rare.5–7 Usually, semi-transparent PSCs adopt blend films of a narrow optical band gap polymer (NBGP) (Eg < 1.80 eV) and PC71BM as the active layers. The active layer of NBGP-based devices often possesses a broad absorption range, which would lead to a relatively low light transmittance.8,9 From this viewpoint, WBGPs are extremely advantageous for application in semi-transparent PSCs to obtain high transmittance and power conversion efficiency (PCE) simultaneously. However, the PCE of WBGP-based devices still lags behind that of NBGP-based devices.10–12 WBGP-based devices with a considerable PCE are therefore demanded for potential applications in tandem or semi-transparent PSCs.
In the last two decades, only a few WBGP-based, single-junction PSCs could obtain a PCE higher than 7%.4,10,11,13 The main obstacle of WBG-based PSCs was the energy level mismatch between WBGP donors and fullerene derivative acceptors, namely, the large offset between the generally high-lying LUMO level of WBG donors and the low-lying LUMO level of fullerene derivative acceptors usually leads to a large energy loss, which reduces the PCE of WBG-based PSCs. For example, for WBGPs with an optical band gap near 1.9 eV, the appropriate offset between the HOMO level of donors and the LUMO level of acceptors can reach 1.6 eV,14,15 the theoretical Voc of 1.3 V can therefore be acquired,15 but only a few devices using the fullerene derivative as the acceptor could obtain a Voc higher than 1 V.14,16 Fortunately, nonfullerene acceptors provide an easy tuneable LUMO level to match different polymer donors.17,18 In the last two years, nonfullerene acceptors have experienced rapid development, and PCE over 8% has been acquired.19–26 Although most nonfullerene acceptors incorporate di-imide derivatives (perylene diimide,21–23 naphthalene diimide,20 tetraazabenzodifluoranthenes19) or 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile24–26 as the electron withdrawing groups to supply high electron mobility, the low-lying LUMO levels of these acceptors make them inappropriate for WBGP-based PSCs. 1,8-Naphthalimide (NI)-based acceptors generally possess high-lying LUMO levels, which are more compatible with WBGP donors.27 In our previous studies, NI-based derivatives with high-lying LUMO levels were synthesized and applied as nonfullerene acceptors in WBGP-based PSCs, and a high Voc above 1 V and PCE of 2–3% with an active layer thickness of approximately 50 nm were obtained.28–30 However, the inferior electron mobilities of NI-based small molecular acceptors (SMA) impeded the further enhancement of the PCE for these devices.
We have demonstrated a strategy for designing NI-based planar small molecular acceptors to facilitate the electron mobility in WBGP-based PSCs.30 The planarity and the LUMO level of small molecules can be adjusted by structural modification.18,31 Appropriate solubility, crystallinity and suitable phase separation can be achieved by the side chain engineering.32,33 Motivated by this idea, we designed and synthesized three novel planar small molecule acceptors (NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8) with NI as the end group and alkynyl as the bridge. These three small molecules were planar, crystalline and H-aggregated in the solid state, which might be beneficial to the electron mobility in the blend films.33,34 Moreover, they all possessed high lying LUMO levels, which would significantly reduce the energy loss of WBGP-based devices and provide a high Voc.35 After optimization, a PCE of 4.05% with a Voc of 1.08 V and a very thin active layer of 35 nm were achieved for PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based devices, which is among the highest PCEs reported for PSCs with Voc higher than 1 V. To the best of our knowledge, 35 nm is the thinnest active layer for BHJ PSCs with a PCE above 4%. Such a PCE can rival the optimized devices based on PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM (4.07%, 73 nm). In comparison, only 2.2% of PCE was obtained for PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based devices with a film thickness of 30 nm. The average visible transmittance (AVT) of the PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based active layer was approximately 76%, making it a potential active layer for the front cells of tandem PSCs or semi-transparent PSCs.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds 2a–c were synthesized by the Sonogashira coupling reaction of compounds 1a–c and trimethylsilylacetylene with (PPh3)2PdCl2 and CuI as the catalyst precursors. Compounds 3a–c were acquired by the treatment of 2a–c with K2CO3 in methanol to remove the TMS group. The Sonogashira cross-coupling of 3a–c and 1a–c with (PPh3)2PdCl2 as the catalyst precursor afforded NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 in yields of 67%, 72% and 71%, respectively. All three SMAs exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. With a weight average molecular weight of 93.1 kg mol−1(Table S1, ESI†), conjugated polymer donor PCDTBT-C12 could be fully dissolved in DCB at 90 °C. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), wide angle XRD experiments demonstrated that NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 were crystalline in the solid state, and the crystallinity decreased with the increase of alkyl chains.

DFT calculations
The molecular geometry of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 in the isolated state was estimated by computational calculations via density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level and 6-31G (d) basis set. Because flexible chains do not significantly influence the calculated results, the alkyl chain was simplified as a methyl group to reduce the computational load. As shown in Fig. 1, the SMA tended to display a completely planar conformation in the optimized geometry, which was beneficial for the π–π stacking of NI groups and the electron transport in the solid state.35 In contrast to perylene diimide-based acceptors, which usually adopt twisted structures to prevent strong crystallization in the blend films,22 the crystallinity and electron mobility of NI-based SMAs is usually weak,22 and the planar structure is therefore preferable to enhance the crystallinity of SMAs to elevate the electron mobility when blended with donor materials.

Optical properties
In terms of the optical properties of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 (Fig. 2), these three SMAs displayed similar absorption spectra in DCB solutions, with a maximum peak at 401 nm. On going from solutions to films, the compounds all exhibited broader absorption, revealing their better packing properties as films. Additionally, a blue shift of approximately 10 nm for the maximum peak was observed, indicating that these SMAs formed H-aggregation in the solid state.29,36 The H-aggregated SMAs possess superior charge mobility compared to the J-aggregated SMAs, which might be beneficial to the charge transport when used as acceptors in PSCs. The absorption spectra of PCDTBT-C12 and SMAs were complementary, which would also increase the photocurrent.35 Evaluated from the onset absorption wavelength, the optical band gaps of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 were 2.50, 2.56 and 2.55 eV, respectively. Detailed data are summarized in Table 1.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed to estimate the electrochemical properties of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8. As shown in Fig. 3, the potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was 0.09 eV. The HOMO levels of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 were 6.05, 6.04 and 6.02 eV, respectively, based on the equation: EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)], and the LUMO levels of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 were −3.54, −3.48 and −3.47 eV, respectively, according to the equation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt. Compared with the LUMO level (−4.04 eV) of PC71BM, these SMAs possessed high-lying LUMO levels, matching better with the LUMO level of PCDTBT-C12 (−3.26 eV). When NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 were used as acceptor materials, the decreased offset values between the LUMO levels of PCDTBT-C12 and SMAs reduced the energy loss, resulting in higher Voc and PCE (vide infra) for the devices.29

Photovoltaic properties
To explore the potential of NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 as acceptors in PSCs, conventional devices with these three SMAs or PC71BM as the acceptor and PBDTBT-C12 as the donor in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of optimized PSCs are shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 2. For PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4-based blend film, typical cluster structures with boosted large domains could be observed by the naked eye, leading to a low PCE of 0.16%. PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6- and PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8-based active layers were relatively smooth, demonstrating that the miscibility of NI-A-C6 or NI-A-C8 with PCDTBT-C12 was better than that of NI-A-C4 with PCDTBT-C12. Higher PCEs of 2.90% and 2.74% were therefore acquired for PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6- and PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8-based plain devices, respectively. With further fine-tuning of the film-forming process using 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) as the additive, the PCE was improved to 4.05% for NI-A-C6-based devices with a film thickness of 35 nm and to 3.36% for NI-A-C8-based devices with a film thickness of 30 nm. The solubility and crystallinity of SMAs could influence the morphology of the blend films, leading to different photovoltaic performance (vide infra). It is worth noting that 4.05% is among the highest PCEs with a Voc higher than 1 V for PSCs, and 35 nm is the thinnest active layer thickness for BHJ PSCs with a PCE higher than 4%. A PCE of 4.05% can rival the PCE (4.07%, 73 nm) of optimized devices based on PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM (Table S2, ESI†). As a comparison, a PCE of only 2.72% was obtained for PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based devices with an active layer thickness of approximately 30 nm.

All devices based on SMA with or without 0.5% 1-CN as the additive displayed a Voc higher than 1.05 V, much higher than PC71BM-based devices (0.89 V), indicating that the energy loss due to the large offset between the LUMO energy levels of the donor and the acceptor was reduced. External quantum efficiency (EQE) experiments were also conducted to verify the accuracy of the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurement. As shown in Fig. 4b, the maximum EQE values of all SMA-based devices were approximately 400 nm, demonstrating that SMAs had a certain contribution to the generation of photocurrent. Additionally, the Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves all agreed roughly with those obtained from the J–V measurement.
For a deeper understanding of the charge recombination processes of various devices, the photocurrent density–effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of PBDTBT-C12:SMA-based devices fabricated with or without 0.5% 1-CN as the additive and PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based devices fabricated under optimized conditions were measured.37,38Jph was given by JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, Veff is defined as V0–V, where the effective voltage (V0) is the voltage where JL = JD, and V is the applied bias. Fig. 4c shows that the photocurrent of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4-based devices could not reach saturation (Jsat) even at a high voltage exceeding 3 V, demonstrating that the exciton dissociation probability of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4 was poor.38 For other devices, Jph reached Jsat at 2 V, suggesting that all photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free charge carriers and were collected by the electrodes.21 Therefore, the exciton dissociation and collection efficiency could be evaluated by the normalized photocurrent density (Jph/Jsat). For as prepared devices based on PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 and PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8, high Jph/Jsat values of 84.2% and 83.2% were achieved under short circuit conditions, demonstrating that the excitons could dissociate and be collected effectively. After using 0.5% 1-CN as the additive, the Jph/Jsat values of these two devices were further enhanced to 87.3% and 85.7%, respectively. The Jph/Jsat value of PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based devices fabricated with 0.5% 1-CN as the additive could rival the Jph/Jsat value of 85.6% for the PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based devices fabricated under optimized conditions, indicating the efficient exciton dissociation at the PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 interface.
Considering the ultrathin thickness of PCDTBT-C12:SMA-based active layers, the transmittance of the active layers was measured to exploit the potential application in semi-transparent PSCs. PCDTBT-C12 absorbed light in the range of 300–630 nm, which is conducive to the transmission of light compared with NBGPs, such as PTB7-Th. The optical transmittances of the devices are shown in Fig. 5a, and the images of different active layers on glass substrates are also displayed in Fig. 5b. The PCDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based active layer with a thickness of 75 nm showed an AVT of 57.1%, whereas the AVTs of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4-, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8- and PCDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based active layers with a thickness of approximately 30 nm were calculated to be 72.6%, 76.1%, 76.9% and 77.0% in the range from 300 to 800 nm, demonstrating that decreasing the thickness of the active layer could increase the AVT of devices. Photovoltaic experiments demonstrated that decreasing the film thickness of PCDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based devices would reduce the Jsc and result in a lower PCE. With a similar thickness of the active layer, when PC71BM was replaced by NI-A-C6 as the acceptor material, higher Jsc and Voc were acquired. Finally, a relatively high PCE of 4.05% was achieved with an ultrahigh transmittance active layer, making the PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 system a potential candidate for tandem or semi-transparent PSCs.

Transport properties
To investigate the influence of alkyl chains and the additive on the charge mobility of devices, hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT-C12:SMA/Au and electron-only devices with a configuration of FTO/PCDTBT-C12:SMA/Al were fabricated. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the devices were estimated from dark J–V curves by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S3 (ESI†), PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4-, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6- and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8-based plain devices exhibited μh of 5.92 × 10−7, 2.15 × 10−7 and 1.26 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas the μe of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4-, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6- and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8-based plain devices were 5.18 × 10−7, 1.07 × 10−8 and 6.45 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The decrease of μe from NI-A-C4 to NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 could be ascribed to the gradually decreasing crystallinity and domain size for SMAs in the blend films (vide infra). Although the aggregation of NI-A-C4 in the PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4 blend films was beneficial to the electron mobility of the devices, the oversize aggregates of NI-A-C4 would reduce the exciton diffusion and separation efficiency in the blend films, leading to lower Jsc and FF. For PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6- and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8-based devices, μe was lower than μh, leading to unbalanced charge transport.39,40 For NI-A-C6- and NI-A-C8-based devices fabricated with 0.5% 1-CN as the additive, μh was almost unchanged, but μe was markedly enhanced to 3.05 × 10−7 and 2.25 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The use of additives could promote the aggregation of NI-A-C6 or NI-A-C8 in the blend films, which is beneficial to the electron transport (vide infra). The enhancement of μe led to a more balanced hole and electron mobility, resulting in higher Jsc and FF.40 The μe of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based devices was similar to that of PCDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based thin devices, leading to a comparable Jsc.

Film morphology
To shed light on the morphology of the active layers comprising different acceptors, atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were performed in the tapping mode to probe the surface morphology. As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the prepared blend films of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8 all exhibited a relatively rough surface with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 21.5, 6.67 and 5.48 nm, respectively, due to the aggregation of crystalline SMAs. The formation of aggregation by SMAs could enhance the electron mobility of blend films, which is beneficial to the enhancement of Jsc.27 However, the strong crystallization tendency for NI-A-C4 led to the formation of large aggregates in the blend films, which could decrease the exciton diffusion and separation efficiency and result in lower PCE. Increasing the length of the side chains from butyl to hexyl and octyl chains gradually decreased the crystallinity of SMAs, resulting in smoother morphologies for the blend films. When using PC71BM as the acceptor, the blend films displayed a smooth surface with an RMS roughness value of only 0.39 nm (Fig. 7, Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†), demonstrating that the domains were quite small.41 Using 0.5% 1-CN as the additive could promote the aggregation of NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8 molecules, leading to bigger clusters, with RMS roughness values of 12.0 and 9.2 nm, respectively. PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based devices fabricated with 0.5% 1-CN exhibited the highest Jsc and FF, demonstrating that appropriate aggregation of SMA was beneficial for achieving high efficiency for nonfullerene PSCs. The above result demonstrated that adjusting the length of flexible chains and using additives could tune the aggregation of SMAs, optimize the film morphology and achieve higher efficiency.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was further employed to probe the phase separation in PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8 bulk blend films (Fig. 8).42,43 A photon energy of 286.8 eV was utilized to provide high material contrast.43 The location of the peaks represents the dominant domain spacing of the different components. All of the profiles showed two peaks. The peaks near q = 0.01 nm−1 originated from the surface roughness and were confirmed by the scattering at 270 eV, where the material:vacuum contrast is dominated by the scattering (Fig. S4, ESI†). The peaks at q = 0.35 nm−1 at the resonant energy of 286.8 eV indicated the phase separation between PCDTBT-C12 and NI-A-C6 or PCDTBT-C12 and NI-A-C8, and the peak at q = 0.06 nm−1 suggested the phase separation of PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4. The domain spacing of 90–120 nm was obtained for the PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C4 film, which is much bigger than the exciton diffusion length. In contrast, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 and PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8 exhibited reduced domain spacing values of 21.2 and 18.2 nm. Furthermore, the integration of the scattering intensity (TSI) reveals the relative composition variation over the length scales probed (referred to as the relative average domain purity) in a two-component blend. Compared with PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C8, the PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 blend film had a higher TSI, which implied increased domain purity.44 The purer domains are favourable for reducing bimolecular recombination.43,45 As a result, PCDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6 had furnished higher Jsc and FF, and thus higher PCE.

Conclusions
To reduce the energy loss of WBGP-based solar cells, three novel NI-based, small molecular acceptors (NI-A-C4, NI-A-C6 and NI-A-C8) with high-lying LUMO levels were designed and synthesized. In addition, these three small molecules possess planar structures and are crystalline, which are beneficial for achieving higher electron mobility in blend films. A PCE of 4.05% with a Voc of 1.08 V was obtained for PBDTBT-C12:NI-A-C6-based PSCs with a very thin active layer thickness of 35 nm. In addition, the PCE of 4.05% is comparable to PBDTBT-C12:PC71BM-based optimized devices (4.07%) and better than devices with an active layer thickness of approximately 30 nm (2.72%), demonstrating that NI-A-C6 could display better photovoltaic performance than PC71BM in WBGP-based solar cells. Most significantly, the thin active layer of 35 nm has average visible transmittance up to 76%. Ultimately, a relatively high PCE and an ultrahigh transmittance were achieved simultaneously, demonstrating that NI-based small molecules are promising acceptors for the front cell of tandem PSCs or semi-transparent PSCs.

General procedure for the preparation of NI-As
A mixture of compound 1 (1.00 mmol), 3 (2.00 mmol) and triethylamine (50 mL) was degassed before and after (PPh3)2PdCl2 (40 mg, 0.60 µmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was partitioned between water (100 mL) and DCM (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (50 mL × 3), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 mL × 3), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was further purified by chromatography on silica gel with petroleum ether/DCM (1:1, v/v) as an eluent to yield NI-As as a light yellow powder.

Film thickness measurement
A PEDOT:PSS thin layer was spin-coated on top of the cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 rpm s−1 for 50 s and was dried at 130 °C for 20 min on a hotplate. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was tested to be 35 nm. The active layer was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and therefore thermally evaporated with the LiF and Al electrode. After the active layer was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer, the total thickness of the PEDOT:PSS and active layer was estimated using a Dektak 6 M surface profiler. The film thickness of the active layer was therefore determined by the thickness of the whole film minus that of the PEDOT:PSS film.
