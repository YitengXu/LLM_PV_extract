    , Accepted 12th September 2019First published on 13th September 2019AbstractFullerenes are considered to be promising acceptor materials for the fabrication of bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. Herein, two novel fullerene derivatives with different specific functional groups, 2-benzylthiophene-C60 bis-adduct (BTCBA) and 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)thiophene-C60 bis-adduct (MBTCBA), were synthesized and utilized as acceptors for PSCs with the purpose of investigating the influence of the fullerene derivative substituents on the device performance. Compared with BTCBA, MBTCBA exhibits a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level due to the electron donating properties of the 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)thiophene functional group. Meanwhile, the appropriate intermolecular interaction of MBTCBA molecules promotes the favorable nanophase separation of the P3HT/MBTCBA based blending film, resulting in a higher electron mobility. Therefore, PSCs incorporating P3HT as a donor and MBTCBA as an acceptor yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.29% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V, which is obviously higher than those of BTCBA (3.54%) and PCBM (3.76%) based devices. Our work proves that the PSC performance can be readily improved by modification of fullerene acceptors using an electron donating group, tuning the LUMO energy level and the molecular packing behavior.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are moving to the forefront as one of the clean and renewable energy sources because of their advantages such as having low fabrication cost, being lightweight and flexible, and involving a simple and scalable fabrication process.1–4 The electron acceptor material is one of the key components of the active layer, and its molecular structure and properties are critical for the performance of PSCs. Therefore, designing new electron acceptors showing a good match with the donor materials is an important way for improving the device performance.5,6 In the last few years, non-fullerene acceptors have shown great potential in this regard.7–10 At present, the PCE of single-junction PSCs has rocketed to 16.5% through finely tuning the molecular structure of the non-fullerene acceptor.11 However, the planar molecular structure and anisotropic charge transport properties of the non-fullerene acceptor require careful optimization of the donor/acceptor blend film to prevent strong aggregation tendency and enhance the charge transportation.12–14
Fullerene derivatives, especially [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), have also attracted substantial interest for application in BHJ PSCs ever since their first photovoltaic application in 1995 because of the advantages of proficient electron affinity, high electron mobility, isotropic charge transport properties, and the capability of forming a favorable nano-morphology with conjugated polymer donors.5,15–17 Meanwhile, the fullerene acceptor is also one of the key components of many high-performance ternary and tandem PSCs.18,19 In particular, the use of fullerene acceptor materials as one of the key components yielded the highest efficiency of 17.3% in tandem PSCs.20 These features make fullerene derivatives still one of the most promising acceptors for PSCs.
However, the commonly-used PCBMs present several limitations such as weak light absorption in the visible region, limited generated photocurrent, and a relatively low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, suppressing the increase of VOC. These shortcomings can adversely affect the photovoltaic performance of PSC devices.21–25 Multi-functionalization on fullerene cages can enhance light absorption in the visible region and elevate the LUMO energy level of the fullerene derivative acceptors, which has been proven to be one of the most effective strategies for increasing the VOC and efficiency of PSCs.22,26–28 In particular, bis-adduct fullerene derivatives have been shown to exhibit a higher LUMO energy level and enhanced light absorption in the visible region.27 Devices using the universal model polymer P3HT as the donor and a bis-adduct fullerene derivative as the acceptor have shown a higher open-circuit voltage and efficiency in contrast to mono-adduct fullerene derivative based PSCs.21,29–36 It has also been demonstrated that the indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA) can also be used as the third component to enhance the energy cascade alignment, increasing the VOC without the compromise of a reduction in JSC and FF due to the bridging role of ICBA between the donor and acceptor components.37 However, the influence of the substitution groups of the bis-adduct fullerene acceptor on the performance of PSCs is still unclear. Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore novel structures of bis-adduct fullerenes and to reveal the fundamental principles that underlie their structure–property relationships.
In this work, we reported two fullerene derivatives the 2-benzylthiophene-C60 bis-adduct (BTCBA) and the 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)thiophene-C60 bis-adduct (MBTCBA) with slightly altered functional groups as well as their corresponding mono-adducts (BTCMA and MBTCMA). The influence of the functional groups on the molecular packing structure was unambiguously identified by X-ray crystallography analysis. MBTCBA with an electron-donating group showed a higher LUMO energy level and improved absorption of visible light.27 In PSCs fabricated using the universal model polymer P3HT, the MBTCBA-based device yielded a higher VOC of 0.81 V compared with the BTCBA-based device (0.78 V). Combined with an appropriate phase separation of the MBTCBA based blend film, MBTCBA based PSCs achieved a remarkable PCE of 5.29%, which was much higher than that of BTCBA (3.54%) and PCBM (3.76%) based devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
P3HT was purchased from Rieke metals. C60 (99.5 wt%), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), acetonitrile, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of fullerene derivatives

2.2.1. Synthesis of BTCMA and BTCBA. 
(1) Synthesis of 2-benzoylthiophene p-tosylhydrazone. The synthetic route is shown in Fig. 1. 2-Benzoylthiophene p-tosylhydrazone was synthesized according to the previous literature.38,39 A mixture of 2-benzoylthiophene (1.88 g, 10 mmol), p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (2.23 g, 12 mmol), methanol (40 ml), and a catalytic amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid was heated at reflux overnight. Afterwards it was cooled to room temperature and kept overnight in a refrigerator for crystallization of the product. The product was collected by filtration, washed with cold methanol and dried in air to yield p-tosylhydrazone as a white crystal (2.86 g, 80%). (2) A mixture of 2-benzoylthiophene p-tosylhydrazone (0.72 g, 2 mmol) and NaOMe (0.13 g, 2.4 mmol) in dry pyridine (15 ml) was stirred under a N2 atmosphere at room temperature. After stirring for 15 min, the reaction mixture was mixed with a solution of C60 (0.72 g, 1 mmol) in o-dichlorobenzene (40 ml) and stirred for 20 h at 80 °C. Afterwards it was heated to reflux overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The mixture compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography to remove most of the byproducts and BTCMA (260 mg, 29%) and BTCBA (285 mg, 26%) were obtained. BTCMA: APCI-MS: m/z calcd for C71H8S: 892 [M]−; found: 892. BTCBA: APCI-MS: m/z calcd for C82H16S2: 1064 [M]−; found: 1064.

2.2.2. Synthesis of MBTCMA and MBTCBA. 
(1) Synthesis of 2-(4-methoxybenzoyl)thiophene p-tosylhydrazone. Using a similar procedure to that described above for 2-benzoylthiophene p-tosylhydrazone, 2-(4-methoxybenzoyl)thiophene p-tosylhydrazone was obtained as a powder (3.18 g, 82%). (2) Using a similar procedure to that described for BTCMA, MBTCMA (196.4 mg, 21.3%) and MBTCBA (287.7 mg, 25.6%) were prepared by the reaction of 2-(4-methoxybenzoyl)thiophene p-tosylhydrazone and C60. MBTCMA: APCI-MS: m/z calcd for C72H10OS: 922 [M]−; found: 922. MBTCBA: APCI-MS: m/z calcd for C84H20O2S2:1124.1 [M]−, found: 1124.2.

2.3. Device fabrication
Using PCBM, BTCBA and MBTCBA as acceptors, PSCs with a typical configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor/Ca/Al were fabricated. The ITO substrate was cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol sequentially, dried with nitrogen gas and further treated with UV ozone for 15 min. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm thickness) of PEDOT:PSS was coated on the clean ITO glass by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then the PEDOT:PSS layer was heated at 150 °C in air for 20 min. For making the photoactive layer in a glove box, the blend solution of P3HT and fullerene derivatives in o-DCB (1:1 w/w, 34 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer at 600 rpm for 60 s. The wet blend film was put into a glass Petri dish to undergo a solvent (o-DCB) annealing process at room temperature for 3 hours, and then the photoactive layer was further annealed at 150 °C for 5 minutes. To complete the device fabrication, the top electrode cathode consisting of 20 nm of the Ca layer and 100 nm of the Al layer was deposited on the photoactive layer by thermal evaporation. All the devices were encapsulated by epoxy kits in a glove box.
2.4. Characterization
Fullerene derivatives were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker Biospin Advance III 500 MHz spectrometer. The molecular mass was determined using a mass spectrometer with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ion source (APCI-MS). The cyclic voltammetry experiment was conducted on a CHI-660C electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk (working electrode), a Pt wire (counter electrode), and a Ag/Ag+ electrode (reference electrode, 0.01 M AgNO3, 0.09 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile) in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)/acetonitrile (5:1) solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The diffraction data of compounds BTCMA and MBTCMA were collected using an Agilent SuperNova X-ray single-crystal diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) micro-focus X-ray sources at 100 K. The data were processed using CrysAlisPro, and the structure was solved and refined using a full-matrix least-squares method based on F2. CCDC 1907607 (for BTCMA) and CCDC 1907608 (for MBTCMA) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 using a 300 W Xenon solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar Simulators). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Merlin lock-in amplifier coupled with a CS260 monochromator and a 300 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
3. Results and discussion
The phenyl group can readily interact with the C60 cage and enhance the intermolecular interaction of its functionalized fullerene derivative as described in a previous report.28,40 The thienyl group was also used for tuning the molecular geometry of donor and acceptor materials.41 Meanwhile, the size of the 2-benzylthiophene and 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)thiophene groups are small, which may be beneficial for shortening the distance of the C60 cage and enhancing the electron mobility in their functionalized fullerene solid film. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a fullerene derivative with an electron donating substituent has a higher LUMO energy level than a fullerene derivative with an electron withdrawing functional group.42 This prompted us to design and synthesize 2-benzylthiophene (BT) and 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)thiophene (MBT) functionalized fullerene derivatives and explore their applications in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 1, four fullerene derivatives (BTCMA, BTCBA, MBTCMA and MBTCBA) were synthesized by a cycloaddition reaction. These compounds were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR technology (Fig. S1–S16, ESI†). In addition, we obtained crystals of BTCMA and MBTCMA by solvent evaporation of the corresponding toluene solution. The molecular structures of BTCMA and MBTCMA were unambiguously determined by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis. The detailed information of the BTCMA and MBTCMA crystals is summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†), respectively. As expected, the BT and MBT functional groups occupied the [6,6] carbon bond of the C60 cage (Fig. 2a and b), which was similar to that of the widely used PCBM. Meanwhile, the BTCMA and MBTCMA crystal structures provided the geometrical information of the packing pattern of the fullerene molecules. As shown in Fig. 2c, all the C60 cages of BTCMA molecules show short interactions with the adjacent C60 cages. Different from BTCMA, some C60 cages of MBTCMA molecules did not interact with their adjacent C60 cages, which can be ascribed to the larger size of the MBT functional group (Fig. 2d). As previously reported, the interactions between the C60 cages indicate that the adjacent molecules have overlapping electron clouds. The overlapping electron cloud of the adjacent molecules can effectively reduce the barrier of electron transfer to adjacent molecules.43 Therefore, compared with MBTCMA, the stronger interaction between BTCMA molecules will affect the phase separation and electron mobility in the blend films. Since BTCBA and MBTCBA have the same functional group as BTCMA and MBTCMA, respectively, the intermolecular interaction and aggregation tendency of BTCBA and MBTCBA molecules should be similar to those of their mono-adduct counterparts. In conclusion, BTCMA with a smaller size of BT leads to a more compact fullerene–fullerene contact than that of MBTCBA in its solid state, which mean that it is reasonable to speculate that BTCBA has more short contacts when compared with MBTCBA. It should be noted that due to the low solubility of BTCMA and MBTCMA, we did not conduct further studies on them.

We studied the electrochemical and photophysical properties of fullerene derivatives by cyclic voltammetry and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, PCBM, BTCBA and MBTCBA yielded similarly well-defined reversible reduction waves in the potential range of 0 to −2.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The half-wave potentials of the reduction process for the fullerene derivatives are listed in Table 1. It was found that the reduction potential of BTCBA and MBTCBA obviously shift negatively compared with that of PCBM. In accord with the previously reported equation: LUMO = −e(Eonred + 4.71) (eV),44 the LUMO energy levels of PCBM, BTCBA and MBTCBA were determined to be −3.91, −3.82 and −3.80 eV, respectively. Compared with PCBM, the LUMO energy levels of bis-adducts (BTCBA and MBTCBA) were higher with an increment of 0.09 and 0.11 eV, respectively. According to previous studies,5BTCBA and MBTCBA with upshifted LUMO energy levels are expected to improve VOC in PSC devices. Fig. 3b shows the absorption spectra of PCBM, BTCBA and MBTCBA in toluene solution at room temperature at a concentration of 10−5 mol L−1. PCBM only shows absorption in the region of 300–400 nm. In contrast, BTCBA and MBTCBA show a much stronger absorption than PCBM, not only in the UV region (300–400 nm) but also in the visible region (400–600). The enhanced absorption of the bis-adduct acceptor is expected to obtain a higher JSC in PSCs.21

To study the photovoltaic performance of different fullerene derivatives, we fabricated PSCs with a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene derivative/Ca/Al (Fig. 4a), where the universal model polymer P3HT was selected as the donor material. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the P3HT film are determined to be −5.15 eV and −3.25 eV, respectively. The energy-level alignment of the related compounds is shown in Fig. 4b. The higher LUMO energy levels of bis-adducts are expected for improving the VOC of the devices. Fig. 4c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with PCBM, BTCBA, and MBTCBA as electron acceptors, and the key parameters are summarized in Table 2. It is important to note that all the devices are fabricated via an identical process. The PCBM-based device yielded a decent PCE of 3.76%, with a VOC of 0.62 V, a JSC of 10.11 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.60, which are close to the values in the previously reported literature.25 The MBTCBA-based device yielded a remarkable PCE of 5.29%, with a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 9.95 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.654, which are close to the values of ICBA-based devices. Impressively, the VOC of MBTCBA based devices unexpectedly increases to 0.81 V, which is 190 mV higher than that of PCBM-based devices. For devices based on BTCBA as the acceptor, the VOC of 0.78 V was obviously improved, but a PCE of 3.54% was obtained due to its inferior JSC and FF. Overall, a PCE of 5.29% was obtained for MBTCBA based devices, which was comparable with that of best devices with a C60 bis-adduct acceptor and a P3HT donor.27

Fig. 4d displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on P3HT:PCBM, BTCBA, and MBTCBA. The maximum EQEs of PCBM-based devices showed higher values at ca. 520 nm than those of PSCs based on P3HT/BTCBA and P3HT/MBTCBA, which should be ascribed to the downshift of the electron mobilities of BTCBA and MBTCBA based films due to more functional groups. Compared with BTCBA based devices, the improved EQE value of MBTCBA based devices could be attributed to its suitable nanophase separation. Meanwhile, the integrated JSCs from the EQE spectra are in good agreement with the values obtained from the J–V curves.
To further investigate the difference in the device performance between the fullerene acceptors, we measured the carrier mobilities and nanomorphology of the P3HT/fullerene acceptor blend films, which heavily affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.45 For a fullerene acceptor, the electron mobility of the blend film profoundly relies on the interaction between fullerene cages. Based on the above discussions, the BTCBA acceptor exhibited a stronger intermolecular interaction when compared to MBTCBA. Therefore, the BTCBA based film should have a higher electron mobility. Then the electron mobilities of the fullerene acceptor based blend films were evaluated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and the Mott–Gurney law using the electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Cs2CO3/blend film/Ca/Al. As shown in Fig. 5a, BTCBA and MBTCBA films yielded electron mobilities of 6.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are lower than that of PCBM (4.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Meanwhile, the hole mobilities of P3HT/PCBM, P3HT/BTCBA and P3HT/MBTCBA films were also determined by the SCLC method using the hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/MoO3/Au. As provided in Fig. S18 (ESI†), P3HT/PCBM, P3HT/BTCBA and P3HT/MBTCBA films yielded hole mobilities of 5.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 2.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, the high and balanced electron and hole mobilities of the P3HT/PCBM and P3HT/MBTCBA blend films are beneficial for the carrier transport in their respective films, thus making their devices yield a higher JSC. However, MBTCBA-based blend films showed higher charge carrier mobilities than BTCBA-based films, which seems opposite to the tendency of their intermolecular interactions. In deed, the charge carrier mobility is not only affected by their intermolecular interactions but also determined by the nanophase separation of the blend films.46

As shown in Fig. 5b–d, the morphology of the blend films with the composition of P3HT/fullerene acceptors were studied by AFM. The P3HT/PCBM and P3HT/MBTCBA blend films displayed a surface root mean square (rms) roughness of 2.60 nm and 2.37 nm, respectively. A similar roughness suggests that the domain size of BMTCBA based blend films is approximately identical to that of PCBM, indicating that the BMTCBA based blend film exhibits a favorable phase separation for charge separation and transportation. In contrast, the P3HT/BTCBA based film showed a roughness of 3.39 nm, which is much higher than that of both PCBM and MBTCBA. The higher roughness of the BTCBA based blend film is reasonably ascribed to its stronger intermolecular interactions as revealed in the crystal structure of its mono-adduct analog. Therefore, the unfavorable phase separation not only leads to lower charge carrier mobilities of the P3HT/BTCBA based blend film, but poor device performance.47
4. Conclusions
Two bis-adduct fullerene acceptors, BTCBA and MBTCBA, were synthesized by a cyclopropanation reaction and used as acceptors to fabricate PSCs. BTCBA and MBTCBA showed LUMO energy levels of 0.09 and 0.11 eV higher than that of PCBM, respectively. The MBTCBA based PSCs yielded a PCE of 5.29% with a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 9.95 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.37%, superior to those of PCBM based control devices. In contrast, the BTCBA based devices only achieved an inferior PCE of 3.54%. The decent PCE of the MBTCBA based device was attributed to its higher LUMO energy, enhanced absorption and favorable phase separation due to its suitable intermolecular interactions. This work suggests that tuning the functional group of the fullerene acceptors is an effective method to improve the performance of PSCs.
