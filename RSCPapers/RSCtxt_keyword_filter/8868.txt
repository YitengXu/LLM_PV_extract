In particular aggressive annealing above the glass transition temperature results in a detrimental coarsening of the blend nanostructure. We demonstrate that mild annealing below the glass transition temperature is a viable avenue to control the nanostructure of a non-crystalline thiophene–quinoxaline copolymer:fullerene blend. Direct imaging methods indicate that coarsening of the blend nanostructure can be avoided. However, a combination of absorption and luminescence spectroscopy reveals that local changes in the polymer conformation as well as limited fullerene aggregation are permitted to occur. As a result, we are able to optimise the solar cell performance evenly across different positions of the coated area, which is a necessary criterion for large-scale, high throughput production.
1. Introduction
The need for climate neutral energy sources such as solar cells is surging due to a steady increase in the total global energy consumption. Currently, a number of thin-film solar cell technologies are under development that promise to provide a feasible solution.1 Polymer solar cells that consist of a conjugated polymer blended with a fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are a particularly promising candidate. Power conversion efficiencies of single-layer, lab-scale devices now reach more than 9%.2 Key to a good photovoltaic performance with a given material is careful optimisation of the blend nanostructure. Typically, a compromise has to be made between (i) a fine blend that provides a large contact area between donor and acceptor molecules for good charge generation and (ii) a coarse blend with percolating donor- and acceptor-rich domains for good charge transport to the electrodes. Increasing efforts are dedicated towards implementing continuous printing processes in order to realise a cost-effective technology.3,4
Some of the most promising polymer:fullerene blends that are currently under investigation comprise a poorly ordered conjugated polymer.5–8 The use of disordered materials offers good solubility in organic solvents, which eases polymer synthesis as well as processing, and results in a high open-circuit voltage of corresponding devices relative to more ordered equivalents.8 However, a major disadvantage is the unstable blend nanostructure that tends to rapidly coarsen when heated above the glass transition temperature of the blend Tblendg.9–11 Thus, it is necessary to tediously optimise the nanostructure directly during solvent removal and film formation, which remains frozen-in as long as the solar cell operating temperature does not approach Tblendg. Hence, post-deposition treatment of disordered blends above Tblendg by thermal or vapour annealing, which is routinely employed to optimise the nanostructure of blends comprising semi-crystalline donor polymers,12,13 has met with little success.
The lack of suitable annealing strategies for disordered polymer:fullerene blends is at odds with large-scale printing processes, for which solvent drying times will ultimately limit the production volumes. Ideally, ink deposition is followed by a heating cycle to enhance the solvent evaporation rate. As the optimal blend nanostructure is rarely at thermal equilibrium the heating cycle is prone to drive the blend towards phase separation. Therefore, it would be of benefit to develop robust processing schemes that result in a very fine mixture of donor and acceptor molecules, which is not necessarily the most optimal one. Then, a short annealing step can be implemented to optimise the blend nanostructure evenly across the entire coated area.
The possibility of mild annealing below Tblendg has not been investigated in much detail. Generally, cooling a material below its glass transition temperature Tg gradually limits molecular motion. As a result, in a molecular glass non-equilibrium conformations can be maintained. However, slow relaxation at temperatures close to Tg can occur, which is commonly described as physical ageing. In the case of linear macromolecules long-range motion of complete polymer chains is strongly suppressed below Tg. Instead, local relaxation of main chain segments or side chains can more readily take place. Therefore, it should be possible to develop mild thermal annealing protocols for polymer:fullerene blends below Tblendg that permit sufficient molecular motion to optimise the nanostructure. With this approach, local diffusion of PCBM molecules as well as segmental reorientation of the donor polymer can be facilitated whilst avoiding large-scale phase separation, which would be detrimental for the photovoltaic performance of the blend.
Here, we demonstrate that mild thermal annealing below Tblendg can be used to optimise the nanostructure of blends based on the non-crystalline donor poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1)8,14 and PCBM (see Fig. 1 for chemical structures). Previously, we have determined the glass transition temperature of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM blends by monitoring the onset of PCBM crystallisation and found a value of Tblendg ∼ 110 °C,10 which is in good agreement with the glass transition temperatures of the two blend components, TTQ1g ∼ 100 °C (ref. 15) and TPCBMg ∼ 110–140 °C.9,16,17 In the current study, we observe that after annealing below Tblendg ∼ 110 °C no changes in the nanostructure can be observed with direct imaging methods, while spectroscopic methods reveal a distinct conformational change of TQ1 as well as local aggregation of PCBM. We find that these local variations in the blend nanostructure lead to the desired increase in light-harvesting efficiency of corresponding solar cells.

2. Results and discussion
In a first set of experiments we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the nanostructure of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM thin films after annealing below and above Tblendg ∼ 110 °C.10 Thin films were spin-coated from ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which yields featureless AFM and TEM images (Fig. 2) and a low root mean square surface roughness Rrms ∼ 0.3 nm (Table 1). Corresponding electron diffraction patterns only reveal a broad, amorphous halo, which suggests that the fullerene material remains disordered. Furthermore, upon thermal annealing up to an annealing temperature Tanneal ∼ 100 °C no coarsening of the blend nanostructure or formation of crystalline PCBM is observed. This can be discerned from the recorded AFM and TEM images as well as electron diffraction patterns of samples annealed at 80 °C and 100 °C (Fig. 2). However, we note a slight increase in surface roughness to Rrms ∼ 0.4 nm after annealing at 100 °C. In most significant contrast, thin films annealed at 120 °C feature a markedly different nanostructure. The TEM image displayed in Fig. 2 indicates the break-up of the finely intermixed blend into a more coarse nanostructure that is characterised by PCBM-rich amorphous domains and isolated PCBM crystals (cf.ref. 10). We recorded single-crystal-like electron diffraction patterns of these entities, which are consistent with previous reports.10,18 Thus, it can be concluded that mild annealing at Tanneal ≤ 100 °C occurs sufficiently below Tblendg to avoid large-scale phase separation. Certainly, the blend nanostructure may have evolved on length scales that are not resolved by the recorded AFM and TEM images. The resolution limit of AFM is given by the diameter of the tip, which was 30 nm. Instead, the recorded TEM images reveal distinct structures down to a length scale of about 10 nm.

We carried out a detailed spectroscopic study in order to resolve structural changes on length scales that are not accessible with AFM and TEM. Initially, we annealed a neat TQ1 and a TQ1:PCBM film at gradually increasing temperatures and recorded UV-vis spectra at room temperature in between each annealing step. Intriguingly, we detect a distinct red-shift for Tanneal > 40 °C, which levels off at Tanneal ≥ 70 °C for neat TQ1 and Tanneal ≥ 100 °C for TQ1:PCBM (Fig. 3). We note that vacuum drying for ∼85 h at 40 °C and 12 mbar does not red-shift the UV-vis absorption spectrum, which rules out evaporation of the residual solvent as the underlying cause. In case of TQ1:PCBM the optical bandgap decreases from ED* ∼ 1.72 eV after spin-coating to ED* ∼ 1.65 eV after annealing at 100 °C (Table 2). The annealing induced red-shift can be explained with a local reorganisation of TQ1 that gives rise to (i) an increase in conjugation length along single polymer chains or (ii) local aggregation of several macromolecules.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra display a comparable red-shift (Fig. 4a). The PL peak emission, which is consistent with emission from neat TQ1,19 shifts from 1.75 eV for a neat, spin-coated film to 1.69 eV for a sample annealed at 100 °C. We note that emission of PCBM occurs at the same wavelength but with much lower PL efficiency.20 Further, the PL emission spectrum of the pristine, spin-coated sample features a shoulder at 1.40 eV, which we interpret as emission from a charge-transfer (CT) state. The CT emission is strongly quenched upon annealing at 100 °C, which indicates a reduction of the polymer:PCBM interfacial area.

(b) Electroluminescence (EL) spectra of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM devices with active layers annealed for 10 min at the indicated temperatures. The black line is a guide to the eye. Note that the emission quantum efficiency ratio between the CT state and neat polymer is on the order of 10−3 and that the external quantum efficiency of the polymer EL is low; EQEEL ∼ 10−3. Thus, due to the low signal strength we only consider relative changes between samples. 
Since the CT emission seen in the recorded PL spectra overlaps with the TQ1 emission tail, we recorded a set of electroluminescence (EL) spectra in order to observe the CT emission more clearly (Fig. 4b). EL emission arises when injected charge carriers recombine. As injected charge carriers are supposed to occupy low energetic states, radiative recombination is likely to occur via a CT state.14 EL spectra of TQ1:PCBM films annealed at temperatures ranging from 20–200 °C show two distinct emission peaks around 1.3 eV and 1.65 eV. These signals arise from the CT state, i.e. luminescent recombination of charge carriers at the donor–acceptor interfaces, and luminescent recombination in phase-pure domains, respectively. Presently, we are unable to determine the makeup of phase-separated domains since the peak EL signal of both, neat TQ1 and PCBM, occurs around 1.65 eV.19,21 The emission of pure phases in pristine, spin-coated TQ1:PCBM films is very weak, which is consistent with a fine blend nanostructure. Intriguingly, annealing above 60 °C results in a noticeable increase in emission at 1.65 eV, here expressed with respect to the peak EL emission from the CT state, ΦEL = EL1.65eV/ELCT. We deduce a low value of ΦEL < 0.1 for devices annealed at up to 80 °C, which is consistent with a finely intermixed blend. However, we observe a noticeable increase to ΦEL ∼ 0.3 after annealing at 100 °C and ΦEL ∼ 0.6 after annealing at 120 °C. We assign the increase in ΦEL after annealing below Tblendg to limited PCBM diffusion, which most likely leads to more phase-pure TQ1 domains as well as local PCBM aggregation. Instead, above Tblendg more extended coarsening of the blend nanostructure occurs. Finally, we note a clear red-shift in CT state emission for Tanneal > 60 °C, which can be ascribed to local reorganisation of TQ1 (cf. redshift of UV-vis and PL spectra in Fig. 3 and 4) as well as the formation of more phase-pure domains.
To further study the CT state energy of annealed devices a series of Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) measurements were performed. This technique can be used to determine the sub-bandgap external quantum efficiency (EQE) resulting from CT absorption. This permits to directly determine the energy of the CT state, ECT.22,23 The driving force for an electron to transfer from the donor to the acceptor is defined as ΔE = ED* − ECT, where ED* is the optical bandgap of the donor. For 1:1 TQ1:PCBM blends the driving force is 0.22 eV for pristine spin-coated blends as well as all films annealed at Tanneal ≤ 120 °C (Table 2; cf. Jablonski diagram in Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that mild annealing will not influence the driving force for charge separation in the blend studied here.
 Fig. 5  Jablonski diagram of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM after spin-coating (black) and annealing for 10 min at 100 °C (red). 
To investigate the effect of mild annealing below Tblendg on the photovoltaic performance a series of TQ1:PCBM solar cells annealed at Tanneal = 20–260 °C were characterised with four diodes on each substrate (Fig. 6 and ESI, Fig. S2†). Remarkably, an increase in both, the short-circuit current density Jsc and fill factor FF occurs for Tanneal ≤ 100 °C. Since our FTPS measurements rule out changes in the driving force for charge separation, we propose that changes in the local polymer conformation and fullerene aggregation enhance extraction of free charge carriers, e.g. due to an increase in local charge carrier mobility or the reduction of trap states and non-radiative recombination centres. In addition, the red-shift of the absorption spectrum is likely to contribute to the increase in photocurrent. Optimum device performance is obtained after annealing at 100 °C, which results in a 25% increase of the power output at the maximum power point MPP up to 4.4 mW cm−2. The high Jsc ∼ 9 mA cm−2 of optimum devices is close to the maximum Jsc ∼ 10.5 mA cm−2 for the investigated device geometry as calculated by transfer matrix modelling24 based on the optical constants of a pristine, spin-coated TQ1:PCBM film. Previously, we have shown that the photocurrent across spin-coated TQ1:fullerene films can vary by as much as 25%.25 In the present study, spin-coated films also show this effect (Fig. S2†). However, all diodes positioned on the same substrate display a more uniform device performance after annealing at 80 °C and 100 °C as evident from the strongly reduced error bars of the MPP (Fig. 6). It appears that mild annealing induces a more homogenous morphology over the entire substrate. As anticipated, more aggressive annealing above Tblendg ∼ 110 °C leads to a rapid decrease in Jsc due to coarsening of the blend nanostructure and the formation of micrometre-sized PCBM crystals.

Error bars indicate the standard deviation of 4 devices on the same substrate. Red dashed lines are a guide to the eye. 
The slight reduction of the open-circuit voltage Voc that occurs when increasing the annealing temperature from 60 °C to 120 °C is consistent with the observed decrease in ECT (Table 2). In agreement with the literature we confirm a linear relationship and find ECT − qVoc = 0.58 ± 0.01 eV, where q is the elementary charge (ESI Fig. S3†).26 In order to establish to what extent the observed changes in Voc can be assigned to changes in the polymer conformation, we prepared pure TQ1 diodes. These devices performed poorly with respect to photo-current generation but displayed a high Voc (Fig. 7). We obtain a Voc ∼ 1.37 V for a pristine, spin-coated device whereas annealing at 100 °C yielded a device with a slightly lower Voc ∼ 1.29 V. Thus, for neat TQ1 diodes we find a ΔVoc ∼ −80 mV, which is in good agreement with the ΔqVoc = ΔECT ∼ −70 meV of corresponding blend devices. We conclude that the observed decrease in Voc is predominantly caused by increased local intra- and or inter-chain order of the polymer. Further, the constant driving force for electron transfer combined with the reduction of Voc with increasing annealing temperature indicate that this local change in ordering mainly affects the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer.

3. Conclusions
We have demonstrated that mild thermal annealing of TQ1:PCBM blends below the glass transition temperature Tblendg ∼ 110 °C can be employed to optimise the photovoltaic performance of corresponding solar cells. Direct imaging methods (AFM and TEM) indicate that large-scale coarsening of the blend nanostructure is prevented. At the same time, spectroscopic methods (UV-vis, PL, EL and FTPS) suggest that below the resolution limit of AFM and TEM, local changes of the polymer conformation as well as fullerene aggregation occur. The driving force for charge separation is unaffected. Thus, we propose that an increase in local charge-carrier mobility, assisted by a slight red-shift in absorption, is responsible for the increase in the fill factor FF and short-circuit current density Jsc. The slight decrease in open-circuit voltage Voc could be correlated with the increased local order of TQ1, as evidenced by a distinct red-shift that is observed with all employed spectroscopic techniques. Importantly, the overall solar cell performance is optimised evenly across different positions of the active layer, which is a necessary criterion for large-scale, high throughput production.
4. Experimental
Materials
PCBM (purity >99%) was purchased from Solenne BV. TQ1 was prepared according to previously published procedures.14 All experiments were performed with the same TQ1 batch (number-average molecular weight of Mn ∼ 71 kg mol−1; polydispersity index PDI ∼ 3.7) apart from UV-vis spectroscopy (Mn ∼ 56 kg mol−1; PDI ∼ 3.0).
Thin film preparation
Films were spin-coated from ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solutions (total material content 25 g L−1). For spectroscopy and AFM glass substrates (cleaned by sonicating in acetone and then isopropanol followed by rinsing with water, acetone, dichloromethane and then isopropanol) were used. For TEM poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Heraeus, Clevios P VP Al 4083) coated glass substrates were used. The film thickness was ∼95 nm as measured by AFM. Spin-coated films were allowed to dry for at least 15 hours to remove the residual solvent. Annealing was carried out at ambient atmosphere but in the absence of light. A heating plate was calibrated with K-type self-adhesive thermocouples from Omega (estimated error ±5 °C; time to reach stable temperature ∼ 30 s).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
Measurements were done with a Digital Instrument Nanoscope IIIa equipped with a type G scanner (Digital Instrument Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The measurements were done in tapping mode and in air using a Micro Masch NSC 15 silicon cantilever.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Samples were prepared by floating off spin-coated films on PEDOT:PSS coated glass substrates in water, followed by collection with TEM copper mesh grids. TEM images were recorded with a G2 T20 Tecnai instrument operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy
Measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrophotometer.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
PL spectra of thin films were recorded using an Oriel liquid light guide and a Shamrock SR 303i spectrograph coupled to a Newton EMCCD silicon detector. The films were excited using a blue PMM-208G-VT laser pump (4 mW cm−2) with a wavelength of 405 nm.
Electroluminescence (EL) spectroscopy
EL spectra of solar cells were recorded using an Oriel liquid light guide and a Shamrock SR 303i spectrograph coupled to a Newton EMCCD silicon detector. The devices were kept at 5 mA.
Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS)
FTPS was performed using a Vertex 70 from Bruker Optics with a QTH lamp, quartz beamsplitter and external detector option. The photocurrent produced upon illumination of the photovoltaic devices with light modulated by the FTIR is amplified with a low noise current amplifier (SR570). The external detector port of the FTIR was used to collect the output voltage of the current amplifier.
Photovoltaic devices
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on PEDOT:PSS coated (spin-coated from Heraeus, Clevios P VP Al 4083, and treated at 120 °C for 15 min, thickness ∼ 40–50 nm) patterned ITO-coated glass substrates. Blend active layers (film thickness ∼ 110–130 nm) were spin-coated from o-DCB. Annealing of the active layer for 10 min was carried out in darkness under a nitrogen atmosphere before deposition of top electrodes. A LiF layer (thickness ∼ 6 Å) and aluminium (thickness ∼ 90 nm) top electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation under vacuum (below 4 × 10−6 mbar). J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (Model SS50A, Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). The light source used was a 180 watt xenon arc lamp solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech.); the intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon photodiode calibrated at the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN).

 	Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis absorbance spectra of a spin-coated 1:1 TQ1:PCBM thin film (black) that has been stepwise annealed for 5 min every 5 °C up to 80 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C (red). Note the distinct red-shift upon annealing (red arrow). (b) UV-vis absorbance at λ = 675 nm as a function of annealing temperature Tanneal of a TQ1 (red circles) and 1:1 TQ1:PCBM thin film (blue diamonds).

 	Fig. 4  (a) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of a spin-coated 1:1 TQ1:PCBM thin film (black) that was annealed for 10 min at 100 °C (red). (b) Electroluminescence (EL) spectra of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM devices with active layers annealed for 10 min at the indicated temperatures. The black line is a guide to the eye. Note that the emission quantum efficiency ratio between the CT state and neat polymer is on the order of 10−3 and that the external quantum efficiency of the polymer EL is low; EQEEL ∼ 10−3. Thus, due to the low signal strength we only consider relative changes between samples.	 

 	Fig. 5  Jablonski diagram of 1:1 TQ1:PCBM after spin-coating (black) and annealing for 10 min at 100 °C (red).	 

 	Fig. 6  Solar cell device parameters (cf. ESI Fig. S2† for J–V-curves) as a function of annealing temperature Tanneal of the TQ1:PCBM active layer: (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF and (d) MPP. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of 4 devices on the same substrate. Red dashed lines are a guide to the eye.	 

 	Fig. 7  
J–V-curves of neat TQ1 diodes with a pristine, spin-coated active layer (black) and an active layer annealed at 100 °C (red). Note the decrease in Voc of ∼−80 mV.
