    , Accepted 21st October 2010First published on 12th November 2010AbstractWe report on a three-step, continuous-flow synthesis of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid tert-butyl ester (PCBtB), a promising electron-acceptor methanofullerene for solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells, through the integrated use of three elements in a microstructured flow-reactor that eliminate the need of isolation steps, with a definite safety and environmental advantage.

Broader context
The paper reports the synthesis of methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid tert-butyl ester (colloquially termed PCBtB) in a microstructured flow-reactor. PCBtB is structurally related to PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) which is used as electron-acceptor in most state-of-the-art polymer solar cells. The choice of PCBtB, although dictated originally by some incompatibility of PCBM intermediates with microfluidic downstream steps, was further corroborated by the fact that solar cells, based on regioregular poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT), showed photovoltaic parameters comparable to those of the benchmark system P3HT:PCBM under the same conditions. The proposed synthesis of PCBtB has been considered as an entity, instead of a series of independent reaction steps, with a definite safety and environmental advantage. Oxidation of hydrazone starting material, within a renewable nickel peroxide cartridge, gives a reactive diazocompound that, in the presence of [60]fullerene, produces in a few minutes a fulleroid stream which is immediately relayed into a photoreactor for a quantitative isomerization to PCBtB with the aid of a white-light, LED array under unprecedented mild conditions and short times.

Introduction
Photovoltaics is offering an important contribution to the quest of alternative energy sources that replace conventional fossil fuels through a variety of solar cell devices based on inorganic semiconductors.1 Since this technology, in its current stage of development, is not economically viable to allow a wide diffusion of solar energy conversion in the absence of government incentives, the last few years have seen huge efforts to introduce organic materials2 as an alternative to inorganic semiconductors for the fabrication of flexible, lightweight organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) though cost-effective techniques, such as roll-to-roll coating or ink-jet printing.3–6
One of the most popular OPV device is that based on the so-called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)7 which is a blend made of a semiconducting polymer, acting as an electron-donor, and an electron-accepting component, typically C60 or C70 PCBMs8,9 ([C60]PCBM = 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, colloquially termed PCBM).8,10 Power conversion efficiencies in the range of 6–7.4% have been reported for solution-processed BHJ solar cells by using methanofullerenes PCBMs and new polymeric donor structures with an extended absorption in the visible/near-infrared range.11–13 The prospects of BHJ cells as valid candidates for solar energy conversion would be further reinforced if a scalable and high throughput chemical synthesis of the active fullerene-based materials would be available. To this end, we report here the first continuous-flow synthesis of a methanofullerene using a microstructured flow-reactor (MFR) setup. A wide variety of chemical reactions have been already carried out in MFRs offering selectivity control by suppression of by-product formation and safer processing, which is mainly related to improved heat, mass transfer and mixing.14,15 Furthermore, microreactor technology enables rapid reaction optimization and screening using relatively small amount of reagents. This is of importance not only for [60]fullerene, as in the present case, but also in view of the functionalization and screening of less abundant fullerenes (C70, C84) or endofullerenes (Sc3N@C80, Lu3N@C80).16,17
Results and discussion
The conventional flask synthesis of PCBM generally involves the addition to [60]fullerene of 1-phenyl-1-(3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl)diazomethane that is produced in situ through the base-induced decomposition of the corresponding sodium salt of methyl-4-benzoylbutyrate tosylhydrazone at a temperature of about 70 °C.18 Essentially, one of the possible [5,6]-open fulleroids is formed and then converted into the thermodynamically more stable [6,6]-closed isomer by thermal processing. For solubility reasons, the decomposition of tosylhydrazone causes a few technical problems when it is carried out in a MFR. Therefore, a different route to diazoalkanes was studied that, eventually, led to methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid tert-butyl ester 1 (PCBtB)10 whose synthesis could be profitably adapted to continuous flow conditions.

Scheme 1 shows the sequence that has been used in this work to carry out the synthesis of PCBtB 1 in a MFR (steps b–d). With respect to the published procedure,10 diazocompound 4 was produced through the nickel peroxide (NiO2)-promoted oxidation of tert-butyl-4-benzoylbutyrate hydrazone 3 at room temperature.19NiO2 can be efficiently loaded into cartridges for serial processing in flow and the exhausted NiO2, after the oxidation, can be renewed with 6% sodium hypochlorite solution and repeatedly employed, with a definite economic and environmental advantage.20 In turn, compound 3 was prepared, under batch-reactor conditions, from tert-butyl-4-benzoylbutyrate 2 and hydrazine hydrate in 81% yield. It should be recognized that the choice of tert-butyl substituent, and thus the departure from PCBM, has been dictated by the known reactivity of n-alkyl esters, such as that of methyl-4-benzoylbutyrate which is the substrate for PCBM synthesis, towards hydrazine. On the other hand, the bulky tert-butyl ester does not react with hydrazine, yielding eventually PCBtB 1. Hydrazone 3 (IR = 3400 cm−1) was used for the next oxidation step, after evaporation of the solvent, without further purification. Oxidation of a solution of 3 in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), that was performed at room temperature into a flow tube packed with NiO2 (Fig. S1, ESI†), gave diazoester 4 (IR = 2030–2080 cm−1). The solution of 4 was introduced through inlet A into the MR-1 whereas a solution of [60]fullerene in ODCB was added through inlet B (Fig. 1 and S1, ESI†).

Conditions: (a) excess hydrazine hydrate, EtOH at reflux temperature, 4.5 h, 81%; (b) nickel peroxide, ODCB, room temperature; (c) [60]fullerene, ODCB, room temperature, 6 min, 37% (HPLC); (d) photochemical isomerization: ODCB, room temperature, >95% (c–d: 30% isolated yield of 1 after column chromatography).

1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of 4 to [60]fullerene ([4]/[C60] = 1.2) gave fulleroid 5 in 37% yield (HPLC) in only 6 minutes at room temperature, along with unreacted [60]fullerene and traces of polyaddition byproducts. The yield of 5 could be increased up to 53% working with excess diazoester 4 ([4]/[C60] = 4.9). However, the amount of fullerene polyadducts rises up to 6% as well.
The fulleroid-to-methanofullerene 1 conversion was carried out into the photochemical MR-2 connected in series through the outlet of MR-1. (Fig. S1, ESI†). We and others have recently demostrated that MFRs represent an interesting alternative to conventional photoreactors because the small size of fluidic channels leads to higher spatial illumination homogeneity and better light penetration through the entire reactor depth.21 As a result, the 5 to 1 conversion proceeded smoothly under white light emitting diodes (LEDs) as a cold, low-power illumination source. An analytical sample of 1 was obtained through semipreparative HPLC on a SiO2 column. NMR spectroscopy and mass determination data (Fig. S2–S5, ESI†) matched those reported in the literature10 and agree with the proposed molecular structure of PCBtB 1. With a total flow rate of 1.5 ml h−1 the productivity was about 6 mg of crude mixture per hour. However, achieving high productivity was not the scope of this investigation. Higher productivities could be obtained through the optimization of the operating conditions, MFR design or by the addition of more identical MFRs in parallel. The PCBtB choice, although dictated by synthetic convenience originally, was further corroborated by the fact that polymer solar cells, based on regioregular poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) and PCBtB, showed photovoltaic parameters similar to those of the benchmark system P3HT:PCBM under air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) irradiation of 100 mW cm−2: power conversion efficiency η = 4%, short circuit current JSC = 11.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.59 V and fill factor FF = 62%.22
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the effectiveness of microstructured flow reactors to prepare methanofullerene PCBtB 1 for OPV applications through the integrated use of three fluidic elements in which a potentially hazardous diazoalkane intermediate forms in situ through the oxidation of the corresponding hydrazone with NiO2, and very quickly reacts with [60]fullerenes to give a fulleroid which is then photolyzed to the target methanofullerene. Interestingly, the fulleroid-to-methanofullerene conversion proceeds nicely under white LED illumination. PCBtB, in combination with P3HT, yields bulk-heterojunction solar cells showing the same performance of devices fabricated with the benchmark system P3HT:PCBM. Whether PCBtB leads to more efficient charge generation than PCBM is subject of current research.
Experimental
Materials

          [60]Fullerene was purchased from Bucky USA (99.5%). All solvents were distilled prior to use according to literature procedures. tert-Butyl-4-benzoylbutyrate 2 was prepared as previously reported.10 Synthesis and selected analytical data for tert-butyl-4-benzoylbutyrate hydrazone 3 are reported in the ESI†. All other reagents were used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Characterization of compounds

1H (250.1 MHz) and 13C (62.9 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC-F 250 spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 spectrophotometer. Oily compounds were measured between KBr windows; powders were measured making KBr pellets. HPLC analysis of 1 was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-10AT instrument, equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-10A detector at 340 nm, using a Cosmosil Buckyprep (Nacalai Tesque, 4.6 × 250 mm, eluent: toluene/n-hexane 7:3, 1 ml min−1). Semipreparative separations were carried out on the same HPLC station with a SiO2 Phenomenex Luna column (250 × 10 mm, 5 µm, eluent: toluene/n-hexane 8:2, flow rate: 2 ml min−1). ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a LC-MSD-Trap-SL (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA). Samples were dissolved in methanol (∼10−5 M) and injected in a stream of the same solvent at 50 µl min−1 (nitrogen nebulizing gas pressure = 20 psi; flow = 5 l min−1; T = 325 °C). APPI-MS spectrum of derivative 1 was recorded on the same instrument (nitrogen nebulizing gas pressure = 30 psi; flow = 4 l min−1; T = 325 °C; vaporizer T = 350 °C). The sample, dissolved in cyclohexane (∼10−5 M), was directly infused in the APPI source through a syringe pump (100 µl min−1).
Synthesis of PCBtB 1 in flow
The microreactors used in this work were fabricated as previously reported.21 The light source for the photochemical microreactor (MR-2) was an array of 75 commercial white LED (45 V, 30 mA, Fig. S1, ESI†). Two flow streams driven by syringe pumps (NE-300, New Era Pump Systems Inc.) bearing separate 5 ml syringes (GasTight, Hamilton); stream 1 containing a solution of [60]fullerene (23.3 mM) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and stream 2 containing the diazoester 4 in ODCB (57.5 mM). On the basis of previous oxidation experiments, it is assumed a quantitative conversion of hydrazone 3 into diazoester 4 after passing a solution of 3 in ODCB through a flow tube (Omnifit, 10 mm × 10 mm) packed with excess NiO2 at room temperature. In particular, the tube was packed with 1.5 g of technical-grade NiO2 and 3 g of glass microspheres that were used as filling material. The yield reported in the text for PCBtB 1 refers to a [60]fullerene flow rate equal to 1.0 ml h−1 and diazoester 4 flow rate = 0.5 ml h−1.
