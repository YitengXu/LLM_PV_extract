    , Accepted 23rd March 2009First published on 20th April 2009AbstractA supramolecular phthalocyanine–squaraine ensemble which exhibits a large coverage of the solar spectrum from 850 to 250 nm has been prepared and characterized both photophysically and in bulk heterojunction solar cells.
The limitations of fossil fuels, increased energy demands, and the low potential cost of solar energy have given great impetus to photovoltaic research. In particular, the high cost of manufacturing crystalline silicon and the vast know-how accumulated in recent years on semiconducting polymer design and synthesis1 have directed the attention of the scientific community towards organic materials. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures have afforded the highest power conversion efficiencies to date for solution processable organic polymer-based devices. In this type of device, fullerene derivatives are generally used as acceptor component.2 Materials based on small molecules offer the same facile processing associated with polymers, but present some specific advantages such as easier purification since they are intrinsically monodisperse. This raises the interesting question of whether it might be possible to replace polymers by small molecules in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials, while still employing simple and cheap solution deposition processes typical of polymeric donors.3

Phthalocyanines (Pcs)4 and squaraines (Sqs)5 possess attractive properties for the preparation of small molecule-based BHJ solar cells. They are both highly versatile, stable classes of molecules with a very rich and tunable chemistry and photophysics, making them, alone or in combination with other electro- and photoactive moieties, ideal building blocks for constructing molecular materials having designed electronic and optical properties.6
Panchromatic optical absorption is a highly desirable materials property for enhancing the efficiency of organic solar cells. A priori, the ability to cover large portions of the solar spectrum with a single compound should afford significantly enhanced efficiency because of the low losses of photons.7 To date, Pcs and Sqs have never been arranged in a single supramolecular assembly able to absorb a large portion of the solar spectrum.
In this communication we report the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a squaraine–phthalocyanine (Pc–Sq–Pc) ensemble and the use of this supramolecule as donor material in solution processable BHJ-OPVs. The squaraine fragment (Sq-PEP) was synthesized via a modification of previously reported procedures.8
Condensation of the appropriate 1-(4-pyridyl)-2-(N-alkyl-pyrrol-2-yl)ethylenic derivative (PEP) with squaric acid in BuOH–toluene afforded Sq-PEP in 35% yield (Scheme 1). Ruthenium phthalocyanine (Ru(CO)Pc) was prepared according to literature,9 and Pc–Sq–Pc was assembled in 50% yield by reacting 3 equiv. of Ru(CO)Pc with 1 equiv. of bidentate pyridine ligand Sq-PEP in refluxing chloroform (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to squaraine–RuPc ensembles: (i) squaric acid, BuOH–toluene, reflux, 3 h, (ii) Ru(CO)Pc (3 equiv.), CHCl3, reflux, 4 h. 
The final Pc–Sq–Pc ensemble was characterized by conventional spectroscopic methodologies: HRMS, 1H NMR and UV-Vis. The MS (EI, MeOH + 1% TFA) displays a cluster at m/z = 864.3–870.3 corresponding to the [Ru(CO)Pc]+ fragment and a peak at m/z = 755 assigned to the Sq unit. More importantly, well resolved 1H NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 solution. Typical diagnostic signals at 5.3 and 2.0 ppm for the pyridyl substituents coordinated to the axial positions of the fragment Ru(CO)Pc were clearly observed (see ESI‡ ).

Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis spectra of Pc–Sq–Pc in CHCl3 solution compared with those of Sq-PEP and Ru(CO)Pc references. The hybrid Pc–Sq–Pc molecule has an absorption spectrum which is essentially the sum of its molecular Pc and Sq constituents, and effectively spans the entire 550–850 nm region. Additional high energy features are also present in the 270–400 nm region. The most intense absorption at 646 nm is assignable to a Ru(CO)Pc π–π* transition and remains almost unchanged in the dyad. The band centered at 706 nm is attributed exclusively to the squaraine fragment and experiences a red-shift of ca. 25 nm from the free Sq to the ensemble, accounting for the electronic interaction between the squaraine pyridic nitrogens and the ruthenium ion in the ground state.

As separate components, squaraines and phthalocyanines have already been studied in BHJ solar cells.10 However, they have never been incorporated in the form of a single molecule such as Pc–Sq–Pc. Thus, prior to exploring the OPV performance of Pc–Sq–Pc, we carried out photophysical studies—steady-state/time-resolved fluorescence and time-resolved transient absorption measurements—to gain insight into the intramolecular processes taking place upon Pc–Sq–Pc optical excitation.
These studies confirm the occurrence of an intramolecular charge transfer process within the Pc–Sq–Pc ensemble fragments upon photoexcitation in toluene, THF, and dichloromethane. In particular, the fluorescence quantum yield of Sq-PEP (0.3, toluene) is significantly reduced in Pc–Sq–Pc (0.003, toluene).11 Despite this marked difference in quantum yield, the fluorescence pattern of Sq-PEP, namely, a strong *0–0 transition at 695 nm, remains unperturbed in Pc–Sq–Pc. A similar conclusion is derived from time-resolved measurements, where lifetimes of 1380 ps (i.e., toluene) and 853 ps (i.e., THF) were derived for Sq-PEP, while for Pc–Sq–Pc, no fluorescing component is discernible within the 100 ps time resolution of our apparatus. Kinetic and spectroscopic insight into the charge transfer come from transient absorption measurements. Thus, Sq-PEP, excited at 680 nm, reveals a transient spectrum with the following characteristics: minimum at 690 nm and maxima at 585, 740, 860 and 1070 nm, which we assign to the singlet excited state of Sq. From a multi-wavelength study we have determined a lifetime of 762 ± 50 ps for this singlet excited state. In contrast, the situation for the Sq portion of the simultaneously generated Pc–Sq–Pc singlet excited state (i.e., maxima at 740, 860, and 1070 nm) is quite different immediately after the femtosecond excitation. Firstly, the singlet excited state decay is 67 ± 5 ps, much faster than in Sq-PEP. Secondly, a new transient evolves, for which minima and maxima are noted at 650, 680 nm and at 520, 730, 1070 nm, respectively. Here, a spectral comparison with radiolytically generated Pc˙+ (i.e., minimum at 650 nm and maxima at 520 and 720 nm) and Sq˙− species (i.e., minimum at 680 and maximum at 1050 nm) is in reasonable agreement. This, in turn, leads us to conclude that the photoexcited Sq unit in Pc–Sq–Pc evolves, upon photoexcitation, into a radical ion pair state, Pc–Sq˙−–Pc˙+.12 From the combined femtosecond (Fig. 2) and nanosecond experiments (Fig. S4, ESI‡ ) we derive a lifetime for the latter state of 24 ± 2 μs. BHJ-OPV cells13 were fabricated in a standard configuration to explore the Pc–Sq–Pc ensemble performance by spin-coating a blend of Pc–Sq–Pc : PCBM (1 : x wt/wt ratio, x = 1, 3, 4) from CHCl3 onto tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)-coated glass anodes, modified by first spin-coating on PEDOT–PSS [poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate] as a hole injection/electron-blocking layer (∼30 nm). Results are presented in Table 1. These preliminary studies reveal an efficiency of ∼0.3%, attributable to a low short circuit current, commonly ascribed to low active layer mobility (typical of the component materials).14 Nevertheless, by reducing the film thickness from 80 to 60 nm, it is possible to decrease the recombination losses and therefore increase the short circuit current. The present Voc values (0.5–0.6 V) are quite similar to high-efficiency P3HT/PCBM devices,15 not unexpectedly reflecting the redox potentials of the Pc–Sq–Pc ensemble (see ESI‡ ).16

Rational tailoring of the redox properties of the bridging squaraine, beyond the scope of the present communication, should allow a further enhancement of these parameters. Finally, a common optimization strategy employed in polymeric systems involves increasing the PCBM ratio in the blend. Indeed, we find that the 1 : 4 (wt/wt) ratio is the optimum trade-off between short circuit current gain and FF loss. This leads, as expected, to an increase in the Jsc; the same trend is observed for the power conversion efficiency (see Table S1 of the ESI‡ for data). These cells exhibit a good rectification ratio in the dark (>103 at 1.0 V for 1 : 3 ratio device and 102 for 1 : 4), even though there are high dark currents. A further rationale for performance enhancement upon increasing the PCBM ratio is provided by tapping mode AFM images (Fig. S6, ESI‡ ).
We observe good quality films with an δRSM roughness ∼0.30 nm. Indeed, δRSM increases upon increasing the PCBM content. It has been reported15 that rough surfaces are a signature of molecular self-organization, a feature associated with increased Jsc.
In conclusion, we have synthesized the first squaraine–phthalocyanine supramolecule by binding two Ru(II)phthalocyanine molecules to a single squaraine possessing two coordinating sites. The ensemble optical absorption corresponds to the sum of the absorption of the individual components with a large coverage of the visible spectrum. This supramolecular Pc–Sq ensemble represents an example of a robust panchromatic sensitizer. Photophysical studies reveal a radical ion pair state, Pc–Sq˙−–Pc˙+, with a long lifetime of 24 ± 2 μs. BHJ solar cells made with Pc–Sq–Pc show a very low Jsc that it is possible to increase by enhancing the PCBM content of the blend. However, the high dark leakage current is probably the principal reason for the low device PCE. Studies are currently underway to better define and optimize processing–microstructure–photovoltaic response relationships, in particular focusing on different solvent and post-deposition treatment.

Photoexcitation of Pc is not further considered, since its weakly fluorescing and short-lived nature (i.e., fluorescence quantum yield: 1.5 × 10−4; singlet excited state lifetime: 60 ± 0.2 ps) renders its participation unlikely and, if at all, difficult to dissect). For further details on fluorescence measurements, see ESI‡.
Mechanistic proof for the radical ion pair formation came from electron transfer quenching experiments of the reduced squarine with molecular oxygen to yield an activation controlled rate constant of 4.2 ± 0.5 × 108 M−1 s−1 in toluene.
