    , Accepted 28th February 2023First published on 6th March 2023AbstractNaphthalenediimide (NDI) and its π-extended derivatives have been one of the most important building blocks to constitute n-type organic semiconductors. To further explore new materials in the NDI family, an angular-shaped naphthodithiophene diimide (aNDTI) containing an electron-rich angular-shaped naphthodithiophene core fused with two electron-deficient 5-membered maleimide rings was designed and synthesized. The key synthetic step is to furnish the central naphthalene ring of aNDTI by two-step electrophilic and photochemical cyclizations. The optical and electrochemical properties of the new aNDTI and its isomeric lNDTI counterpart were compared theoretically and experimentally. The coplanar aNDTI monomers can serve as a moderate electron-deficient acceptor to prepare two new donor–acceptor copolymers PBM and PFBM. By doping 0.05 wt% PBM and PFBM as nonvolatile polymer additives into the PM6:Y6 blend, the devices achieved enhanced PCEs of 16.1% and 16.0%, respectively, which outperformed the pristine PM6:Y6 device with an original PCE of 15.1%. The improvement of PCEs primarily results from the increase in the FF and Jsc. The GIWAXS measurements reveal that the lamella spacing (dl) of the side-chain interdigitation of PM6 is slightly reduced and Y6 crystallinity is enhanced in the presence of PBM and PFBM additives, leading to enhanced electron (μe) and hole mobility (μh) in the SCLC measurements and higher fill factor (FF) values in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Furthermore, more efficient photo-induced intermolecular charge transfer between PM6 and Y6 was observed in photoluminescence spectroscopy of the additive-incorporated thin films. This work demonstrates that utilization of polymer donors as nonvolatile additives to mediate morphology is an effective and practical strategy for boosting the efficiency of OPV devices.
1 Introduction
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenediimide (NDI)1–8 where a central naphthalene ring is linked with diimides to form two 6-membered imide rings has been proven to be a superior building block to make n-type organic semiconductor materials (Fig. 1) applied for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).8–21 The NDI core can be easily π-extended at 2,6-positions via metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to yield a variety of NDI-based small molecules and donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers for high-performance optoelectronic devices. A representative NDI-based polymer, P(NDI2OD-T2) reported by Facchetti and coworkers, achieved a high OFET electron mobility of 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. Another important π-extension strategy is to make NDI-embedded ladder-type architectures where a NDI core is further fused with aromatic or heteroaromatic rings at 2,3-, and 6,7-junctions of the naphthalene ring, taking into account that the high coplanarity of the multifused ring structures reduces reorganization energies and strengthens intermolecular π–π overlap for efficient carrier transport in the solid state.22–27 Takimiya et al. reported a thiophene-fused NDI,28,29 denoted as linear-shaped naphthodithiophene diimide (lNDTI, Fig. 1), using a linear-shaped naphthodithiophene (lNDT) as the conjugated framework (Fig. 1). The NDTI-based D–A copolymer, PNDTI-BT-DT, having an ambipolar character, exhibited both appreciable hole and electron OFET mobilities of 0.1 and 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.28

Depending on the fused junction between the thiophene and naphthalene moieties, naphthodithiophenes (NDT) can have linear- and angular-shaped isomeric structures.30–42 It was demonstrated by Takimiya and Osaka et al. that the molecular packing of NDT-based polymers is strongly influenced by the geometry of isomeric NDTs.43 Copolymers with a “zigzag” angular-shaped NDT (aNDT) motif turn out to have more ordered solid-state structures and thus higher OFET mobilities than the polymers incorporating its linear-shaped naphthodithiophene (lNDT) counterpart.30,40,44 It is therefore of interest to explore another isomeric structure of NDTI, i.e. angular-shaped naphthodithiophene diimide (aNDTI) containing an electron-rich angular-shaped naphthodithiophene core fused with two electron-deficient 5-membered maleimide rings.
In this work, we wish to report a well-designed synthetic approach to constructing a new aNDTI building block. The diiodo-aNDTI was copolymerized with 2,6-di-2-thienyl-4,8-di-2-thienylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T) and fluorinated BDT-T (FBDT-T) monomers to form two new D–A copolymers PBM and PFBM, respectively (Fig. 1). PBM and PFBM were employed as organic semiconductors for OFETs, showing p-channel characteristics with moderate hole mobilities. On the other hand, PBM and PFBM with low molecular weights are suitably utilized as nonvolatile additives to improve the active layer morphology of the PM6:Y6-based organic photovoltaics (see structures in Fig. 1).45–49 The effect of the additives on the thin-film morphology associated with charge transport in the active layers of the OPVs has been thoroughly investigated. With the addition of 0.05 wt% of PBM or PFBM, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PM6:Y6 devices can be improved to be over 16% as a result of the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc). The synthesis, comparison of the two isomeric monomers, materials properties, and device characterization will be discussed.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
Synthesis of aNDTI derivatives is depicted in Scheme 1. Nucleophilic addition of n-octylamine or 2-butyloctyl amine to maleic anhydride furnished a ring-opening intermediate which underwent a ring-closure reaction in the presence of ZnBr2/hexamethyldisilazane to give 1a and 1b, respectively. Bromination of the olefin group in 1a and 1b followed by NEt3-promoted HBr elimination generated 2a and 2b, respectively. On the other hand, Sonogashira coupling of trimethylsilylacetylene with 3-bromo-2-iodo-thiophene (3), derived from iodination of 3-bromothiophene, yielded 1,2-bis(3-bromo-2-thienyl)acetylene (4). Deprotonation of 4 at the 5 and 5′ positions by lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) afforded a lithiated intermediate which was quenched by chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) to produce 1,2-bis(3-bromo-5-trimethylsilyl-2-thienyl)acetylene (5). 5 was treated with n-BuLi to furnish a di-lithiated intermediate which underwent nucleophilic substitution with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane to give compound 6 in a 60% yield. Compound 7 was acquired by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 2 with 6. Under the irradiation of a mercury lamp in the presence of iodine, compound 7 underwent double cyclization to form the central naphthalene ring of TMS-aNDTI-C8 and TMS-aNDTI-C4C8 in 40% and 32% yields, respectively. The mechanism is supposed to undergo sequential electrophilic and photochemical cyclizations similar to the synthesis of the tetrathienonaphthalene derivatives reported by Yamaguchi et al.50 Iodination of TMS-aNDTI-C8 and TMS-aNDTI-C4C8 by ICl afforded I-aNDTI-C8 and I-aNDTI-C8C4 in 66% and 71% yields.

I-aNDTI-C8 and I-aNDTI-C8C4 were copolymerized with BDT-T-Sn and FBDT-T-Sn, respectively, to furnish PBM (Mn = 2558 with PDI = 1.4) and PFBM (Mn = 5622 with PDI = 1.2) D–A copolymers (Scheme 2). After several trials of polymerization, the molecular weights of the resulting polymers were relatively low presumably due to their limited solubility.

2.2 Comparison of aNDTI with NDTI building blocks
UV-Vis absorption spectra of aNDTI (TMS-aNDTI-C8 was used to represent aNDTI) and lNDTI28 are shown in Fig. 2 for comparison. The two molecules exhibited dissimilar absorption profiles. aNDTI showed absorption λmax at 320 and 440 nm whereas lNDTI exhibited three major peaks at 290, 440, and 550 nm. It is noteworthy that the absorption profiles bear a resemblance to their corresponding non-imide analogues, i.e. angular naphthodithiophenes (aNDT) and linear naphthodithiophenes (lNDT).28 Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, optical energy gap (Eoptg), electrochemical energy gap (Eeleg), and extinction coefficient (ε) are summarized in Table 1.

Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) using TD-MPW1PW91/6-311G(d,p)/PCM=CH2Cl2//CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) was employed to gain insight into the electronic transition for aNDTI and lNDTI. The aliphatic moieties are simplified using methyl groups in order to reduce the computational time. Good agreement can be identified between the experimental and theoretical UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 2). Contours of frontier orbitals reveal that aNDTI and lNDTI have dissimilar HOMO and LUMO electron-density distribution (Fig. 3). As shown in the LUMO plots in Fig. 3, the 6-membered ring diimide moieties have obvious orbital interactions with the lNDT core, whereas the 5-membered ring diimides have weak interactions with the thiophene units in the aNDTI, being responsible for distinct energy levels and absorption features. The lNDTI with a lower LUMO level should exhibit greater n-type characteristics than the aNDTI with a higher LUMO level. Other calculated properties, such as HOMO/LUMO energy, absorption maximum, oscillator strength, and configuration of the excited states are summarized in Table 2. At wavelengths longer than 350 nm, aNDTI gave one absorption band with λmax = 439 nm and lNDTI exhibited two main absorption bands with λmax = 441 and 548 nm. On the basis of the TD-DFT results, the absorption band of aNDTI with λmax = 439 nm should primarily result from the electronic transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. On the other hand, for lNDTI, the absorption band with λmax = 548 nm is attributed to the electronic transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. The electronic transition from HOMO−2 to the LUMO is the major contribution to the absorption band with λmax = 441 nm.

2.3 Optical and electrochemical properties of PBM and PFBM
The absorption spectra of PBM and PFBM in chlorobenzene (CB) and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4. In the solution state, both PBM and PFBM exhibited a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) at 472 nm. In the film state, PBM and PFBM displayed λmax at 489 nm and 482 nm, respectively. On the basis of the onset of the thin film absorption, the Eoptg of PBM and PFBM is estimated to be 2.05 eV and 2.08 eV, respectively. In comparison with PBM, the fluorinated PFBM showed a slightly blue-shifted λmax and Eoptg.

The oxidation potential and reduction potential of PBM and PFBM were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 5). The HOMO energy level and LUMO energy level of PBM were calculated to be −5.64 eV and −3.77 eV, respectively. The fluorinated PFBM exhibited a lower-lying HOMO energy of −5.77 eV and a LUMO energy of −3.90 eV (Table 1).

2.4 OFET device performance
Bottom-gate/top-contact OFETs were fabricated to evaluate the charge mobility of two solution-processed aNDTI-based PBM and PFBM semiconductors (Fig. 6). The OFET parameters are shown in Table 3. Details of device fabrication are included in the ESI.† The transfer and output curves of the PBM- and PFBM-based OFETs are shown in Fig. 6. Both polymers exhibited typical p-channel transistor characteristics. The maximum OFET mobility (μh) in the saturated regime was calculated to be 6.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBM and 2.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PFBM. Neither PBM- nor PFBM-based OFETs showed n-channel characteristics, indicating that the 5-membered ring imide moieties in aNDTI do not enable ambipolar characters for the aNDTI-based polymers.

2.5 
          PBM and PFBM as the nonvolatile polymer additives for OPVs
In addition to p-type and n-type materials in the active layer of OPV devices, incorporation of a nonvolatile additive has been used to tailor donor/acceptor interactions to obtain the optimized morphology.51–71 Additives enabling suppression of phase separation and stabilizing the morphology in the active layer can enhance the device performance and stability. Yan and coworkers introduced a polymer additive into a PM6:Y6-based solar device to achieve a PCE of 16.76% which is better than a pristine device of 15.87%.65 Development of nonvolatile polymer additives has become imperative and promising for OPV research.64–71 Due to the limitation of low molecular weight, PBM and PFBM are not ideal to function as p-type polymer materials for OPVs. Instead, we envisioned that PBM and PFBM can function as nonvolatile additives to modulate the morphology of the active layer in OPV devices. State-of-the-art PM6:Y6-based OPVs (ITO/ZnO/PM6:Y6/MoO3/Ag) were used to demonstrate this possibility. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating a chloroform solution of PM6 and Y6 (in 1:1.2 wt%), with or without adding 0.05 wt% of the PBM/PFBM additive. The thin films were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 13 min. The J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 7, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 4. The pristine device exhibited a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 26.88 mA cm−2 and an FF of 67.49%, delivering a PCE of 15.1%, which is comparable to the value reported in the literature. In comparison to the pristine device, the PBM-incorporated device showed an improved Jsc from 26.88 to 27.48 mA cm−2 and an FF from 67.49% to 70.31%, achieving a higher PCE of 16.1%. The improved photocurrent is a result of an increased shunt resistance of 22.9 kohm. On the other hand, the PFBM-incorporated device exhibited a similar Jsc but a higher FF of 71.48%, leading to an enhanced PCE of 16.0%. It should be noted that the Voc values associated with the energy loss72–75 (Eloss, see in the ESI and Table S2†) remain unaffected among the devices.

2.6 Charge recombination analysis
The α value in Jsc ∝ Plightα, where Plight is the light intensity, is indicative of bimolecular recombination.76Fig. 8a depicts the plots of Jsc against Plight. The α values for the devices with and without the polymer additives are close to 1, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination is negligible in the devices. The linear relationship between Voc and Plight is described in Fig. 8b. The slope is proportional to 1.18 kT/q for PM6:Y6, 1.21 kT/q for PM6:Y6:PBM, and 1.07 kT/q for PM6:Y6:PFBM. The closer to 1 kT/q the slope is, the less the degree of charge recombination is. The PM6:Y6:PFBM device exhibited the smallest slope, accounting for the improved FF in this device. Photocurrent density (Jph) could be acquired by subtracting the dark current density from the illuminated current density. Effective voltage (Veff) is the voltage at Jph = 0 minus the applied bias voltage. Fig. 8c depicting the relation between Jph and Veff reveals that the saturation currents (Jsat) of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:PBM, and PM6:Y6:PFBM are 27.25, 26.93, and 26.97 mA cm−2, respectively. Jph divided by Jsat yields the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T), which is electric field- and temperature-dependent. P(E,T) approaching 100% suggests that the excitons can be separated effectively to yield free charges. The P(E,T) values of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:PBM, and PM6:Y6:PFBM blends are 98.94%, 99.39%, and 98.30%, respectively. The PM6:Y6:PBM device has the greatest P(E,T), which might account for the enhanced FF in the device.

2.7 SCLC measurements
Hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron-only ITO/Al/active layer/Al devices were fabricated to estimate the charge mobilities in the vertical direction using the SCLC model (Fig. 9). The PM6:Y6 active layer exhibited an electron mobility (μe) of 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility (μh) of 1.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Subsequent to the introduction of PBM and PFBM, both μe and μh became greater. The device with PBM gave μe = 2.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 4.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and that with PFBM yielded μe = 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh = 4.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. More balanced μe/μh ratios were found in the presence of PBM and PFBM (Table 5). The results are in resonance with the higher FF values in the OPV devices after the addition of PBM and PFBM.

2.8 GIWAXS measurements
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to understand the molecular packing in the active layers. Fig. 10 displays the two-dimensional GIWAXS images and the corresponding one-dimensional line cuts along the in-plane direction (qxy) and the out-of-plane direction (qz). PM6:Y6 exhibits a broad peak of π–π packing from 1.5 to 2.0 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a lamellar layer packing at qxy = 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. Considering the fact that the PM6 neat film also shows a broad peak at qz from 1.5 to 2.0 Å−1, while the Y6 neat film shows two sharper peaks at higher qz values = 1.83 Å−1 and 1.88 Å−1 (Fig. S4(e)†), the broad diffraction peak in the OOP direction observed for the PM6:Y6 blend film is attributed mainly to the face-on π–π stacking bilayer structure of the PM6 polymer. When PBM and PFBM additives were introduced to the PM6:Y6 blend, additional sharper peaks at higher qz = 1.89 and 1.86 Å−1 were observed, respectively, which can be ascribed to Y6 characteristic peaks. These changes imply that crystallization of Y6 is enhanced in the presence of additives.53 Furthermore, the PM6:Y6:PBM and PM6:Y6:PFBM thin films also show the lamella diffractions at higher qxy of 0.32 Å−1 and 0.33 Å−1 compared to PM6:Y6 with a peak at qxy of 0.31 Å−1 in the IP direction, indicating the decreased lamella spacing (dl) corresponding to the side-chain interdigitation of PM6. The enhanced Y6 crystallinity and reduced dl can facilitate charge carrier transport, accounting for the enhanced electron and hole mobility of PM6:Y6:PBM and PM6:Y6:PFBM observed in the SCLC measurements.

2.9 Surface topography analysis
An atomic force microscope (AFM) was utilized to investigate the surface morphology of the active layer. Sample preparation is described in the ESI.† Polymer fibers and noticeable phase separation were observed on the PM6:Y6 surface (Fig. 11). The bright fibril diameter was approximately estimated to be ca. 200–250 nm. Similar surface patterns were found for the PM6:Y6:PBM and PM6:Y6:PFBM surfaces, suggesting that the additives have an insignificant effect on the surface morphology. Nevertheless, the root mean square roughness (Rq) varied from 2.43 nm for PM6:Y6 to 2.92 nm for PM6:Y6:PBM and 2.91 nm for PM6:Y6:PFBM. The larger Rq might result in better morphology for the OPV devices.77,78

2.10 Photoluminescence spectroscopy
Photo-induced charge transfer in the thin films was studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Fig. 12a depicts the PL spectra upon excitation at 569 nm. The neat PM6 film showed emissions ranging from 585 nm to 930 nm. When PM6 was blended with Y6, its photoluminescence intensity was greatly reduced. In comparison to the integrated emission intensity of PM6 that was set to be 100%, the quenching efficiency after adding Y6 was estimated to be 93.4%, implying efficient intermolecular charge transfer.79 The presence of PBM slightly increased the quenching efficiency to 93.6%. As for PFBM, the quenching efficiency was 97.4%, and noticeably reduced emission intensity above 800 nm was observed.

Fig. 12b depicts the PL spectra upon excitation at 767 nm. The neat Y6 film exhibited emissions spanning from 800 nm to 1200 nm. When Y6 was blended with PM6, its photoluminescence intensity was reduced significantly. In a similar manner, the integrated emission intensity of Y6 was set to be 100%. The quenching efficiency after adding PM6 was approximated to be 97.4%, indicating again efficient intermolecular charge transfer. Introducing PBM or PFBM increased the quenching efficiency to 99.1% or 99.6%, suggesting that intermolecular charge transfer can be further facilitated in the presence of the polymer additives.
3 Conclusions
A well-designed synthetic approach to synthesizing an angular-shaped aNDTI building block has been established. The key step to construct the central naphthalene core in aNDTI involves sequential electrophilic and photochemical cyclizations. The optical and electrochemical properties of angular-shaped aNDTI and linear-shaped lNDTI were compared theoretically and experimentally. The isomeric aNDTI and lNDTI exhibit distinct energy levels and absorption features. The aNDTI building blocks were used to synthesize two donor–acceptor copolymers PBM and PFBM. The Eoptg of PBM and PFBM was estimated to be 2.05 eV and 2.08 eV. PFBM (HOMO = −5.77 eV and LUMO = −3.90 eV) exhibits lower frontier-orbital energies than PBM (HOMO = −5.64 eV and LUMO = −3.77 eV) due to the fluorine substituent. The OFET μh is determined to be 6.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBM and 2.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PFBM. PBM and PFBM were utilized as nonvolatile polymer additives for the PM6:Y6-based OPVs. A pristine PM6:Y6 device yielded a PCE of 15.1% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 26.88 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.49%. With the nonvolatile polymer additives, the PM6:Y6:PBM device exhibited an improved PCE of 16.1% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 27.48 mA cm−2, an FF of 70.31%, while the PM6:Y6:PFBM device furnished a PCE of 16.0% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 26.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.48%. The improvement of PCEs primarily results from the increase in the FF and Jsc. Incorporation of PBM and PFBM has a marginal effect on Eloss, rationalizing the constant Voc values. From the GIWAXS measurements, it was found that the PBM- and PFBM-incorporated thin films exhibited enhanced Y6 crystallinity and reduced side-chain interdigitation lamella spacing of PM6, which are beneficial for charge transport to enhance μe and μh in the SCLC measurements, accounting for the higher FF values in the OPV devices. PL spectroscopy suggests that photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and Y6 is more efficient in the presence of PBM or PFBM. Further development of aNDTI-based semiconductor polymers or small molecules for optoelectronic applications is currently underway in our laboratory.
