    , Accepted 26th September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractIt is urgent to exploit the ability of water–energy co-generation technologies to address the challenges and opportunities for the water–energy nexus. This report presents a cuboid-shaped interfacial solar steam generator made of a selective solar absorber-coated aluminum sheet with filter paper strips attached to its four outer walls as the evaporating surfaces and water-conducting paths for simultaneous freshwater and electricity generation from saltwater (3.5 wt% of NaCl). Connecting all four strips in series, a device with an illumination area of only 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 can generate an open-circuit voltage of 2.7 V with sufficient power to continuously glow an LED during evaporation, without any energy storage devices, in addition to an evaporation efficiency of 88%. For the first time, we could generate sufficient electricity from a single evaporator in a continuous manner to realize practical applications without scaling up, even in the dark. Our device promotes interface solar steam generation as a promising alternative to the solar-driven water–energy nexus.
Introduction
Water scarcity and energy scarcity are major global concerns that are often interconnected.1–3 However, water and energy technologies are independent, and combining these two with separate infrastructures will ultimately lead to high cost and low energy utilization efficiency. Hence, it is crucial to find a synergetic low-cost solution to overcome water and energy shortage.
Interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG) has emerged as a promising environment-friendly, low-cost, and sustainable approach for freshwater generation by enhancing solar evaporation using sunlight as the sole energy source.4–8 Furthermore, different forms of energy are produced during ISSG, making it a futuristic technology for synergistic energy and freshwater production. Considering such advantages of ISSG, simultaneous generation of electricity and freshwater has recently gained tremendous interest.9–16 For instance, the internal enthalpy of the hot steam produced during ISSG has been scavenged into electricity by Zhu's group and they achieved an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 4.15 V and short-circuit current (ISC) of 0.61 A at a solar intensity of 30 kW m−2.17 In addition to thermal energy, the kinetic energy of the steam has also been utilized for electricity production. Ho's group used a ferroelectric fluoropolymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) cantilever for harvesting the thermo-mechanical energy of the steam and achieved the highest power density of 240.7 μW m−2 under 1 sun.18 The temperature gradient created by interfacial evaporation has also been utilized to generate electricity along with freshwater production. In this direction, Ho's group used a thermoelectric module to harvest the energy from the temperature gradient and achieved a power density of 0.4 W m−2 under 1 sun illumination.19 Further, the energy contained in the salinity gradient of the solution between the evaporation interface and the underlying bulk water caused by the evaporation was utilized by Zhou's group through a Nafion membrane.20 Recently, Meng et al. reported the co-generation of freshwater and electricity using a thermogalvanic cell and achieved a maximum power output of ∼1.6 mW m−2.21 However, all the above-discussed systems require high illumination intensity to maintain a sufficient temperature or salinity gradient, which restricts their performance only under illumination. Furthermore, in these cases, the power was insufficient to continuously operate a practical device (like an LED) without using energy storage devices, limiting their large-scale application. Therefore, it is essential to find an alternative system that can produce sufficient power to run functional devices without using any energy storage devices under normal solar illumination or even in the dark.
Recently, another form of energy from water has emerged based on the electrokinetic phenomena induced by osmotic pressure.22 In this technique, an electrolyte solution is passed through a capillary channel, forming an electric double layer (EDL) to generate the so-called streaming potential and current.23–26 An interfacial solar steam generator (ISSGr) generally requires capillary channels to maintain controlled wastewater transport from the bulk to the absorber surface for evaporation. Considering seawater as the electrolyte and transporting it through capillary channels of steam generators, freshwater and electricity can be synergistically produced.
Here, we have developed a cuboid-shaped ISSGr with an illumination area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 made of a selective solar absorber (SSA)-coated aluminum sheet. Four filter paper strips acting as the evaporation-induced electricity generators were attached to the outer walls of the cuboid. Using 3.5 wt% of saltwater, the device showed an evaporation rate of 0.5 kg m−2 h−1 in the dark and 1.9 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination corresponding to an evaporation efficiency of 88%. Further, a single water-conducting strip generates a VOC of ∼0.7 V and ISC ∼26 μA. Combining all four strips in series, it generates a VOC of ∼2.7 V and sufficient power to run an LED or a digital calculator without the help of any energy storage devices, irrespective of the illumination conditions. Also, the device could run a digital watch when two pairs of series-connected strips were connected in parallel. This integrated strategy shows a significant advancement in simultaneous freshwater and electricity production.
Results and discussion
Conducting electrolytes through capillary channels of cellulose fibers produces electricity.22,23 Attaching such voltage-generating channels to an ISSGr to transport saltwater from the reservoir to the evaporator surface will be an effective strategy for water–electricity co-generation. Fig. 1a shows the schematic arrangement of a cuboid-shaped ISSGr with four independent water-conducting strips attached to its outer walls, and the lower ends of the strips are dipped vertically into the reservoir. Here we prepared a similar ISSGr with a projected area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 and a height of 2.5 cm using SSA-coated aluminum as the photothermal layer and Whatman filter paper strips as the water-conducting channels to transport saltwater (3.5 wt% NaCl solution, average salinity of seawater), as shown in Fig. S1.† The details are given in the Experimental section of ESI, Note S1.† On illumination, the ISSGr absorbed >96% of the incident light (Fig. S2 and Note S2†) and converted it into heat via the photothermal effect27 and used it to evaporate the saltwater. The evaporation performance of the device was monitored under a light intensity of 1 sun from a AAA solar simulator, and the whole setup was placed on an analytical weighing balance to measure the real-time weight losses. As shown in Fig. 1b, the device shows evaporation rates of 0.5 kg m−2 h−1 and 1.9 kg m−2 h−1 under darkness and 1 sun illumination, respectively, which are faster than that of pure water. Furthermore, we estimated a solar evaporation efficiency η of 88% using the following equation: (1)where ṁ is the net evaporation rate, LVC is the enthalpy of vaporization of water–vapor phase change, and Pin is the total solar irradiation. To ensure that the evaporation rate is contributed only by the cuboid-shaped evaporator, we covered the lower part of the device with aluminum foil (Fig. S3†).

The flow-induced electricity was measured continuously using a Keithley source meter. The voltage starts to appear immediately after the fluid touches the upper electrode of the strip and gradually rises and reaches a maximum, followed by a steady state. Each water-conducting strip saturates at an approximate VOC and ISC of 0.7 V and 26 μA, respectively (Fig. S4†). Connecting all the strips in parallel, we achieved a VOC of ∼0.7 V and an ISC of ∼85 μA, whereas a series combination shows a maximum VOC of ∼2.7 V and ISC of ∼26 μA, as shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. It is important to mention that for the parallel combination, all four strips can be dipped in a single reservoir (inset of Fig. 1c), but to get a series combination, separate reservoirs are required, as given in the inset of Fig. 1d. The combined series voltage of 2.7 V is the highest value reported so far for a single evaporator, as plotted in Fig. 1e.28–34 The device was also operated continuously for 6 h in the dark followed by 6 h in constant light (1 sun) to study the long-term light dependence. Although the evaporation rate jumps to 1.9 kg m−2 h−1 on illumination from the dark value, the VOC does not show any significant change from its maximum value for the entire measurement duration of 12 h (Fig. 1f), indicating an additional advantage of the all-day-long electricity production capacity of our ISSGr. We observed that during 12 hours of continuous operation, the salt precipitated on the outer surface, which was removed simply with a stainless steel scraper (Fig. S5†).27 Furthermore, we have tested the device performance by increasing the height to 5 cm and keeping the same projected area. The evaporation rate increased to 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination due to the increased dark evaporation rate of 0.7 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. S6†), with a maintained evaporation efficiency of 88%. No change in the VOC and ISC was observed, as plotted in Fig. S7.†
The applicability of the generated electricity from our device was verified by operating small electronic appliances. In a series combination, our device was able to light up an LED continuously (Fig. 2a) and run a digital calculator (Fig. 2b) in the dark. The device also ran a digital watch (Fig. 2c) under dark conditions when the two pairs of series-connected strips were connected in parallel. Video S1 in the ESI† confirms the capacity of a single device to generate an appreciable power that can glow an LED of different colors (green, yellow, and red), perform operations in a calculator, and can also run a digital watch directly without using any energy storage devices. For the first time, we could generate sufficient electricity from a single device to realize such practical applications without scaling up in situ with solar steam generation.

(c) Photo of the digital watch run by the device with two pairs of series-connected strips connected in parallel. Variation of output (d) voltage and current, and (e) power density of the ISSGr measured as a function of external load resistance when all four strips were connected in series. 
Further, to comprehensively characterize our device as a power source, the output performance of the device was evaluated by adding various load resistances across the output circuit when all four strips were electrically connected in series. The summarized results in Fig. 2d show that the current drops from 26 to 0 μA, while the voltage increases from 0 to 2.7 V with the increase in load resistance. Considering the electrode area as the active area, the maximum output power density was estimated as 1.2 W m−2, at a load resistance of 40 kΩ, as given in Fig. 2e.35 However, we feel that the illumination area will be the effective area of electricity generation and the maximum output power of the device was 96 mW m−2 considering the projected area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2.
Electrokinetics is a well-known phenomenon, and the origin of electricity generation within the water-conducting channels has also been extensively explained elsewhere.23,36–41 In brief, when the microchannel of the filter paper comes in contact with an electrically neutral solution, the surface acquires some negative charge due to the negatively charged free surface groups (such as –COOH and –OH) of cellulose filter paper. When the ionic liquid flows through the microchannels, the negatively charged ions (co-ions) are repelled away from the surface while the positively charged ions (counter ions) are attracted towards the surface, forming a static positively charged layer and hence forming an EDL with free surface groups, as shown in red dotted rectangles of Fig. 3a. Due to the presence of an EDL at the solid–liquid interface, the saltwater flowing through a microchannel by capillary-driven pressure can result in a streaming potential between the two ends of microchannels due to the accumulation of ions or charges.41 The detailed discussion is given in Note S3 and Fig. S8 of the ESI.† No voltage was observed along the width of the strips, as shown in Fig. S9.† Similar results have also been observed in our previous report.42 So, in our case, the device uses the interactions between electrokinetics and microfluidics to directly convert the capillary-driven pressure of a liquid into electrical work.

(b) Time response of VOC with different flow rates originating from varying the evaporation rate with change in illumination intensities. (c) Measurement of VOC and ISC for a single strip of different electrolyte solutions. 
The effect of strip width on the VOC was studied and is plotted in Fig. S10.† The VOC increases with the strip width because of the decreased channel hydraulic resistance; however, a further rise in strip width may amplify the channel impedance, reducing VOC.23 Hence to design an ISSGr of large surface area, it is recommended to use multiple strips with small widths. Moreover, the variation of VOC was estimated at different concentrations of saltwater and different materials and is given in Fig. S11.† Although a maximum VOC was achieved at a lower salt concentration, we focused our experiment on 3.5 wt%, as we are dealing with seawater desalination. We also study the flow rate dependence of electricity production by measuring the VOC with different evaporation rates achieved by changing the illumination intensities. Fig. 3b shows that the evaporation rate increases almost linearly with the increase in solar intensities. However, the VOC remained almost constant at all illumination intensities (blue line in Fig. 3b), showing that the voltage generation is independent of the electrolyte flow rate, and it only depends on the interaction between mobile ions of the electrolyte and cellulose fibers of the filter paper. Our proposition was further confirmed by using different electrolytes with similar concentrations to that of saltwater, and we found that all electrolytes can produce sufficient voltages along the microfluidic channels of the filter paper. The variation of VOC with change in electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 3c, can be explained by the variation of the zeta potential of the filter paper.23 However, it is important to mention that a minimum flow rate is essential to maintain a continuous voltage that can be provided by dark evaporation. Restricting the evaporation by taping the whole conducting strip leads to a drastic fall in the voltage generation, as plotted in Fig. S12.†
To verify the desalination capacity of our devices, we condensed the water vapors using a homemade condenser made of a glass cover and a Petri dish (Fig. S13†), and the salinity of the water was measured by measuring the resistance of the condensed water using a multimeter. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the resistance value of the saltwater (95 kΩ) rises to 1.3 MΩ after condensation, indicating the evaporator's high saltwater purification ability. Furthermore, for actual seawater desalination, we have used seawater from the Bay of Bengal. No significant changes in the electricity production were observed, and the desalination capability of our device was confirmed by the substantial reduction of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 4c) below the salinity levels defined by the World Health Organization.43

Conclusions
In summary, we designed a device that produces freshwater from saltwater using solar light and simultaneously generates sufficient electricity that can run small electronic appliances continuously. The device consists of a cuboid-shaped ISSGr made of an SSA-coated aluminum sheet for photothermal conversion and four filter paper strips on its outer walls for water transportation. The device shows an evaporation rate of 1.9 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination leading to an evaporation efficiency of 88% using 3.5 wt% of saltwater. In addition, each strip can generate a VOC of 0.7 V and an ISC of 26 μA both under light and darkness. Further, we achieved a VOC of ∼2.7 V and an output power density of 1.2 W m−2 when all four strips were electrically connected in series. The output power obtained was enough to glow a green LED and to run a calculator continuously without using any energy storage devices. This work would open a new avenue for the synergistic production of freshwater and electricity to meet the ever-increasing demand for clean water and energy.
