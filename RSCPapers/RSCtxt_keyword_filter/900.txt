    , Accepted 10th March 2021First published on 25th March 2021AbstractThe fabrication of highly efficient flexible and semitransparent large-area organic solar cells (OSCs) is an utmost requirement for the effective commercialization and industrialization of this technology. However, obtaining such large-area flexible devices with high transparency and high performance is a tremendous task. Herein, a series of high performing devices, with more than 8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for large-area (1.25 cm2) flexible semitransparent OSCs have been successfully developed. The semitransparency has been maintained at around 16–24% average visible light transmittance (AVT), whereas even after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10 mm, the corresponding devices still maintained about 95% of their initial efficiency. This outstanding performance has been attributed to the rather unique top and bottom silver grid architecture. The bottom transparent flexible silver grid substrate (bottom electrode) produces the cavity effect with the top silver electrode, resulting in enhanced device performance with high transparency. Furthermore, the top metal electrode, which is composed of laser processed semitransparent charge-transporting busbars over the thin metal surface, guarantees efficient transmittance while enhancing the charge collection ability. Hence, such top busbar structures might be a general solution for overcoming the trade-off between the AVT and the PCE. Overall, this study provides a promising strategy for the transfer of large-area flexible semitransparent OSCs into practical industrial applications.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is gradually becoming one of the best alternative clean energy sources with the development of photovoltaic technology. Organic solar cells (OSCs), as a low-cost photovoltaic technology, have shown great promise mainly due to their abundant synthesis material resources, solution-processing abilities, the compatibility with flexible substrates,1–4 and the roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques.5 Furthermore, the selective light absorption of organic materials enables optical semitransparency, which shows their great potential applications in smart windows, or more commonly in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs).6–11 Typically, for fabricating such semi-transparent devices, the organic materials with transmittance in the visible light range and photon harvesting in the near-infrared (NIR) range are carefully selected to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and reasonable light transmittance (AVT).12–14
To date, through synergistic efforts such as electrode innovation, device engineering and optical simulation, the small area (0.04 cm2) flexible semi-transparent organic solar cells have seen rapid progress.15–21 However, the performance of their large-area (>1.00 cm2) counterparts has not been quite up to the mark,22,23 which limits the industrial research and development. In Table S1 (ESI†), the current large-area flexible semi-transparent OSC performance has been summarized where the best device can only exhibit a modest 3.9% PCE with an area of 1.1 cm2.23 To obtain high performing flexible semi-transparent devices, the bottom and top electrodes require high electrical conductivity, low sheet resistance, and suitable mechanical flexibility simultaneously. Similarly, the AVT, PCE, and CIE (International Commission on Illumination) colours, which are the significant factors for producing highly efficient large-area flexible semi-transparent OSCs, can also be systematically tuned by device engineering.
For the rigid devices, the ITO electrodes are widely used as the bottom electrode. However, the formation of cracks in the ITO electrodes renders them unsuitable for flexible devices. Similarly, the bottom electrode with modified conducting polymers has a relatively high sheet resistance that limits the large-area PCEs, along with the inherent acidity issue that causes device degradation.5,24–28 In comparison with the silver nanowire bottom electrode, the CNTs/graphene bottom electrode does show an advantage in terms of both cost and processing, yet they both suffer from poor electrical connections and stability problems.29–31 Likewise, despite the top electrodes based on PEDOT, CNTs/graphene, and nanowires having some prospective exploration, there are still several problems associated with such systems such as low conductivity, poor stability, and ultimately, limited performance. Yet, another top electrode choice, an ultrathin metal film (UTMF), which possesses the advantages of relatively low sheet resistance and good flexibility, and generally follows the Volmer–Weber growth mode, seems like a potential alternate.32 However, the AVT–PCE trade-off of such systems still needs to be optimized. Typically, the scaled-up devices always bring large current accumulations. Similarly, to obtain higher AVT, the devices are usually combined with Fabry–Perot cavity/dielectric mirror structures, etc., which requires the evaporation process to be repeated several times.
Typically, the performance of the semi-transparent devices can be boosted through the improved photo-absorption as a consequence of the microcavity effect. Furthermore, the utilization of charge transporting busbars with UTMF integrated as a top electrode offers a great trade-off between the AVT and PCE of the corresponding devices.6,33–36 Thus, combining the microcavity effect approach and the transporting busbars would be an effective strategy to reduce the PCE losses in the scaled-up devices.
In this work, a sliver grid bottom electrode and a sliver UTMF top electrode have been used to form a light-trapping structure with the microcavity effect. The highly efficient PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC:PC61BM ternary system has been selected as a base organic layer system,37 whereas the corresponding efficiency comparison has been summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Interestingly, according to the architectural aesthetic standards, people are more inclined to choose the blue colour for their structural designs, making the Coi8DFIC small molecule an appropriate choice as its transmitted light just fits this colour segment, as per the CIE, Fig. 1e.23,38 For the bottom electrode, PET/silver grids with a resistance of <1 Ω sq−1 and 90% transparency have been used. For the top electrode, a specially customized busbar that covers the UTMF has been utilized that improves the corresponding carrier collection ability. Hence, this top electrode busbar enabled the flexible semi-transparent large-area (1.25 cm2) OSCs to achieve a PCE of 3.45 times its initial value with only 9.8% AVT loss. To our knowledge, this is the highest recorded PCE for such devices.23 Furthermore, after 1000 bending cycles, the devices with the customized top electrode were able to maintain 95% of their initial PCEs as compared to the 80% retention from the conventionally prepared devices,39 indicating that bottom and top grid architectures enable the devices to show excellent comprehensive performance.

2. Experimental
Device fabrication
PTB7-Th has been purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (Canada) while the COi8DFIC and PC61BM have been purchased from Hyper, Inc. (China). Fig. S1 (ESI†) lists the overall device process where the silver grids have been patterned on PET substrates (square resistance <1.0 Ω sq−1, T ≥ 84%) to serve as the bottom electrode. After repeated isopropanol cleaning, the substrate underwent proper surface treatment where plasma is used for a very short time to increase the wettability (Yocto, Diener Electronic, Germany) of the substrate. Then, a highly conductive PH1000 (Clevios Heraeus, Germany) solution has been used to completely and evenly cover the substrate at a speed of 1800 rpm. Afterward, the hybrid electrodes have been annealed at 150 °C in ambient conditions for 10 minutes. The ZnO nanoparticles, prepared via ZnO sol-gel with isopropanol solvent (15 mg ml−1 concentration) have further been utilized as the electron transport layer (ETL). The PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC61BM active layer solutions with a ratio of 1:1:0.4 (w/w) and a concentration of 18 mg ml−1 have been prepared in chlorobenzene, or halogen-free solvent, o-xylene, along with 0.4% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive, at 60 °C with overnight stirring. The consequent solution was then spin-coated on substrates at 1600 rpm to form the organic layer with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. The samples were then transferred into a vacuum evaporation chamber to deposit the UTMF. Thus, at a vacuum level of ca. 1.0 × 10−5 mbar, a thin layer of MoO3 (20 nm) and Ag with different thickness (10–160 nm) has been thermally evaporated onto the samples, by carefully optimizing the rate of different media during the evaporation process. A laser has also been used to engrave the grid-like transmission part on a special paper.23 Eventually, the charge transporting grids are prepared by the second evaporation and finally form a complete device (Fig. S1, ESI†). The four types of UTMF + Busbar were fabricated by a template which was obtained by laser cutting technology with industrially compatible laser equipment (USA Newport Laser μFAB/Spirit ps 1040-10). The laser cutting process is shown in Fig. S1c and d (ESI†). Then, the template is placed on the top of the UTMF as a mask.
Device performance measurement
The J–V characteristics of the devices have been assessed under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−1) with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91159A solar simulator. The light intensity has been calibrated with a Newport oriel PN 91150V Si-based solar cell, while the J–V characteristics have been recorded with a Kiethley 2400 source meter unit. The EQEs have been performed in air with an Oriel Newport system (Model 66902) equipped with a standard Si diode, whereas, the monochromatic light has been generated from a Newport 300 W lamp source. The effective area of the device has been calibrated at 0.04 cm2 or 1.25 cm2 using a shadow mask. The Rsheet of the electrodes has been measured by the four points probe.
Characterization
The film absorption spectra have been measured using the UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda750, PerkinElmer, USA), whereas the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images have been measured via Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN. The thicknesses of the active layer have been measured by the Alpha-Step D-120 stylus profilometer (Kla-Tencor). For the large-area semitransparent devices, the active layers were obtained by the same condition (same solution concentration, same spin-coating speed). The thickness of the active layer is ca. 110 nm.
Optical simulation
The optical simulation based on the transfer matrix method has been used to calculate the forward and backward propagating waves at each interface within the stratified devices. Furthermore, the wavelength-dependent optical properties of each layer have been represented by the refraction index (ñ = n + ik) of each material, acquired by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). All the simulations have been based on Maxwell's assumption of planar interfaces and total isotropy for all layers. Also, 100% internal quantum efficiency and the AM1.5 intensity spectrum (ASTM G173-03) have been assumed to calculate the theoretically maximum photocurrent density.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b exhibit the chemical structure and energy level of the involved components. Since both the PTB7-Th polymer and the Coi8DFIC small molecule are low-bandgap entities, they can be termed suitable for the semi-transparent OSCs. Likewise, as the PC61BM absorbs photons from the short-wavelength region, it does not have a big impact on the visible AVT area but helps in improving the overall efficiency due to enhanced electron transportation. From Fig. 1c, it can be seen that the inclusion of the additives leads to a redshift in the system whereas the aggregation effect happens during the hot spin coating process, which ultimately enhances the overall absorption spectrum and the PCE.17
Inverted device architecture consisting of PET/silver grid/PH1000/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag/Ag busbars has been correspondingly employed, while the effective area of the devices has been set to 0.04 cm2 and 1.25 cm2 for small and large area devices, respectively. The schematic diagram of the large-area flexible semi-transparent device structure is shown in Fig. 1d. The devices show a very good blue colour as shown in Fig. 1e. It is worth mentioning that we have additionally used photonic crystals (PC) to obtain higher AVT (31%). The photograph of the semitransparent devices is presented in Fig. 1f, showing its high transparency and blue colour. Fig. S2a (ESI†) exhibits the complete bottom electrode configuration, where the hexagonal grids can be seen from the optical microscope images (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Fig. S2c (ESI†) reveals the length and width of the flexible large-area device to be 1.25 cm and 1 cm, respectively.

Table 1 lists the performances of OSCs based on the rigid and flexible substrates, from where it can be seen that the small-area rigid devices (0.04 cm2) were able to produce a PCE of 11.19%, with a Voc of 0.716 V, Jsc of 23.78 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.71%, whereas, the hot spin-coating process boosted the PCE to 11.93% as a consequence of enhanced Jsc of 26.16 mA cm−2. Hence, these results reveal the hot spin coating method to be effective in enhancing the PCE, which is as per the published data.17 Thus, the hot spin coating procedure was used to fabricate the other devices. Ultimately, for the small-area semitransparent devices, PCEs of 10.68% and 10.27% were successfully achieved by using 30 nm and 20 nm silver thin film as the top electrode, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 2a and b demonstrate the J–V and EQE curves of the corresponding devices, respectively, from where it can be seen that the Jsc calculated from the EQE graphs matched well with the values obtained by the J–V curves, ensuring the measurement accuracy for the semi-transparent devices. Furthermore, as compared to the opaque devices, a slight PCE drop of approximately 10% has been observed for the semi-transparent devices, rendering this system to be quite suitable for semi-transparent device fabrication.

(d) Exciton generation difference between the PET/ITO substrate and silver grid substrate. 
Likewise, the opaque large-area flexible devices fabricated using the PET/ITO substrate were only able to produce a modest PCE of 5.16%, with a Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.69 V, 17.54 mA cm−2 and 42.66%, respectively, while, an excellent PCE of 10.29% has been attained for the devices with PET/silver grid as the bottom electrode. Hence, the opaque large-area devices, fabricated using a PET/silver grid substrate reached over 90% efficiency of the small-area devices (PCE: 11.93%), indicating a significant suppression of the PCE losses. In contrast, the PET/ITO based large-area devices were only able to maintain less than 50% PCE of the small-area devices, revealing the PET/silver grid to be better than the PET/ITO as the bottom substrate. Furthermore, by comparing the absorption/transmittance/reflection data of the traditional PET/ITO with the silver grid bottom electrode (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3a, ESI†), a similar optical trend and overall transmittance (≥84%) have been observed. However, the measured square resistance for the silver grid bottom electrode (ca. 1 Ω sq−1) turned out to be much smaller than the ITO electrodes on the conventional flexible PET system (ca. 30 Ω sq−1). Thus, with the high transmittance and low resistance, the PET/silver grid is selected as a bottom electrode for fabricating the large-area semi-transparent and flexible OSCs.
In addition to the high FF, the PET/silver grid-based devices show higher Jsc as well (Table 1). Similarly, as the transmittance of the two flexible substrates is almost similar, more photos can be converted to electricity by using the PET/silver grid substrate. Since the FF and Jsc depend on the morphology of the active layer, the AFM and TEM techniques have been utilized (Fig. S3a–d, ESI†), which, however, revealed a similar morphology for the two systems. To understand the reason, the transfer matrix model has been employed to simulate and calculate the photon absorption in the different substrates. Fig. S4a and b (ESI†) contains the photon absorption distributions for the devices using PET/ITO and PET/silver grid as the bottom electrode, respectively. A calculated Jsc of 28.2 mA cm−2 has thus been achieved for the PET/ITO substrate-based devices, which is less than that of the device using the sliver grid substrate (32.50 mA cm−2). These Jsc values are higher than those calculated from the J–V curves as in the model, it's been assumed that there is no loss from photons to excitons, and the excitons are 100% converted into carriers. Fig. S4c (ESI†) shows that the EQE based on the PET/silver substrate is better than that of the PET/ITO substrate, and the EQE of the UTMF 20 nm semi-transparent device is close to that of the PET/ITO substrate, which further reflects the superiority of this electrode. Fig. 2d shows the photo-absorption difference for the above two cases, where the improvement in the carrier generation rate is quite obvious. This noticeable enhancement can be observed from ca. 400 to 500 nm range, as well as in the large wavelength range (ca. 800 nm to 1100 nm), which is beneficial from the narrow bandgap Coi8DFIC small molecule. It can be seen that the silver grids (bottom electrode) and the silver film (top electrode) generate an approximate resonant cavity effect, indicating enhanced light-harvesting due to microcavity-induced light trapping. Hence, more photons can be used by the active layer with PET/silver grid/active layer/silver architecture, resulting in a higher Jsc than the PET/ITO based structure. Also, from Fig. 2d, the enhanced absorption of semi-transparent devices at short wavelengths can be observed which can help break through the photon absorption bottleneck while maintaining good AVT.
Compared with the opaque large-area flexible devices, the Jsc and FF drop dramatically in the semi-transparent devices, especially for the devices with a 10 nm UTMF electrode, due to the significantly high resistance of the UTMFs. A trend has been observed for the semi-transparent devices such that, the thinner the UTMF, the lower the conductivity, the greater the square resistance, and thus, the greater the thermal dissipation energy losses.40 On the other hand, a tremendous bias voltage drop-induced excessive charge recombination is observed for the large area semi-transparent devices, a widely known scale-up device performance drop, as a consequence of the UTMF's high resistance as well.41,42
Therefore, to enhance the conductivity of the UTMF electrode, charge collection and transportation busbars have been utilized. Thus, with the integrated charge-transporting busbars, the scaled-up device has been formed into several narrow strips, leading to a shortened photocurrent transmission distance and ultimately, reduced energy losses in the corresponding devices. However, the busbar structure's obvious shadows do result in slight optical losses in the system. Thus, the busbar distribution density and the height of the busbar will all have a correlation effect, and therefore, balancing the energy and optical losses from the busbar's structure has been a key parameter in obtaining high-performance large-area flexible and semi-transparent OSCs.
The complete laser preparation of the top grid process has been demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Depending on the paths ascribed, the lasers with different power levels draw straight lines with different spacing regularly on the special paper. Four types of charge-transporting (CT) busbars have been designed on the top UTMF electrode (Fig. 3a). To appropriately increase the conductivity without significantly affecting the transmittance of the UTMF electrode, the width of each busbar has been set to 100 μm. The busbar 1 and busbar 2 have been used to verify the relation of AVT loss and the density of the busbar, respectively, where busbar 1 is denser than busbar 2. For busbar 1 and busbar 2, the gap between each grid has been set to 20 μm and 40 μm, respectively, whereas the height is set to 100 nm for each grid. For busbar 3 and busbar 4, the gap between each busbar is set to 500 μm, while the height for each busbar has been set to 10 and 20 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) The design of the busbars. (b)–(d) Device parameters of the studied organic solar cells with different types of top electrodes (UTMF or UTMF + busbars). 
For the semi-transparent devices with 20 nm UTMF (Fig. 3b), the utilization of busbar 1 led to an enhancement in the charge collection ability of the corresponding system as a 2% increment in PCE has been observed (from 8.05% to 8.23%) with a 17.6% AVT loss (from 16.69% to 13.75%). Likewise, for busbar 2, similar results have been obtained as a 1% increase in the PCE with 3.8% AVT loss has been observed. Thus, a negative effect on the trade-off between PCE and AVT has been attained for both busbar 1 and busbar 2 due to the high charge collection ability of the 20 nm UTMF, as its resistance is only 5 Ω sq−1 which is already quite low.
For the semitransparent devices with 15 nm UTMF (Fig. 3c), the busbar 1 and busbar 2 revealed almost no influence on the PCE and AVT trade-off of the devices, since the improvement of PCE with the similar loss of the AVT. However, the utilization of busbar 3 and busbar 4 led to an improvement of 4% and 6% in PCE for the AVT losses of only 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively. Interestingly, the gain in the PCE appeared to be higher than the losses in the AVT. Consequently, the best PCE of 7.13% has been attained for the semi-transparent devices with an AVT of 20.4%.
For the semi-transparent devices with 10 nm UTMF (Fig. 3d), a quite shallow PCE of 1.17%, with very low Jsc and FF has been observed, due to its very high resistance (ca. >60 Ω sq−1) induced weak charge collection ability. Conversely, for the busbar 3 system, a boosted PCE of 4.09% (3.45 times of 1.17%), with an AVT loss of only 9.82% (from 25.14% to 22.67%) has been observed. Thus, a significant PCE with very low AVT loss has been attained as a consequence of busbar utilization to assist the charge collection. Hence, the proper application of such busbars with rational designs would enable the corresponding systems to achieve a better balance between the optical loss and PCE gain. For specific numerical details, see Table S3 (ESI†).
The flexibility test has further been carried out by bending the consequent devices (with a bending radius of 10 mm) whose normalized device parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) after every 200 bending cycles until 1000 cycles have been recorded in Fig. 4. The original (unbent) PCE of the corresponding ternary system came out to be 7.93%, which got slightly reduced to 7.6% after being subjected to a cylinder (Fig. 4) with a radius of 10 mm for 1000 bending cycles, which accumulates to a remarkable 95% of the initial value. Interestingly, during the bending process, the Voc and Jsc of the devices turned out to be quite similar to the unbent devices. Thus, the small decrease in efficiency can mainly be attributed to reducing FF during the bending test. Overall, it can be concluded that the mechanical bending performance of the flexible silver grid bottom electrode has been quite outstanding, where even after 1000 bending cycles, the efficiency of the flexible devices remained higher than 95% of its initial PCE.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated large-area flexible and semi-transparent OSCs with PCEs more than 8%, with 16–24% AVT, on a 1.25 cm2 flexible substrate. Furthermore, the PCE after 1000 bending cycles (r = 10 mm) has still been maintained at about 95% of the initial value. Moreover, the trade-off between PCE and transparency for the semitransparent devices has partially been overcome via the cavity effect for light absorption, by using silver grid bottom and silver busbar/UTMF top electrodes. We believe that fabricating the semitransparent OSCs in this manner is a promising strategy to better balance the PCE and optical losses of the corresponding semitransparent devices.
