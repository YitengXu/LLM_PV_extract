Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention because of their low cost, high efficiency, simple fabrication processes and environmentally friendly features.1 Key components of a DSSC include a dye-sensitized porous TiO2 film as the working electrode and a platinized conductive substrate as the counter electrode. Sandwiched between these two electrodes is the redox couple based electrolyte. The redox shuttle has functions of donating electrons to the oxidized dye for dye regeneration and accepting electrons from the counter electrode for circuit completion.
For practical applications, DSSCs should not only have high efficiency but also exhibit good long-term stability. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes possess both cohesive properties of solid materials and good diffusion properties of liquid electrolytes.2 Therefore, quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (QSS-DSSCs) are able to achieve good long-term stability at a high efficiency level. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes can be prepared by solidifying organic solvent-based liquid electrolytes3–13 and ionic liquid based electrolytes14–20 with polymer gelators or metal oxide nanoparticles.
Recently, we developed functionalized ionic conductors (ICs) through the introduction of ester, propargyl and hydroxyethyl groups into the imidazolium ring, respectively, for solid-state DSSCs.21–24 In this work, we designed and synthesized three ICs (MPhII, MT2II and MT3II, inset in Fig. 1) by linking aromatic groups, such as phenyl or thienyl (position-2 and position-3), to the imidazolium ring, respectively, for highly efficient and stable QSS-DSSCs. The intention of linking an aromatic group to the imidazolium ring is to expand the π conjugation,25–27 which can cause strong π–π interactions between imidazolium cations. As a result, the distance between neighboring iodides can be shortened, which is conducive to promoting charge transfer between adjacent iodides and hence increasing the ionic conductivity. The IC-containing solutions solidified with SiO2 nanoparticles can be used as quasi-solid-state electrolytes for QSS-DSSCs. We find that the conductivity of these quasi-solid-state electrolytes shows a great difference, depending on the substituent and the substitution site. Analysis of single-crystal structures for the three ICs shows that the distances of adjacent iodides in their crystal packing structures are distinctive, which correlates well with the conductivity sequence. Among them, MPhII possesses the highest conductivity due to the shortest distance between neighboring iodides and the lamellar structure. Interestingly, the conductivity of MT2II is much higher than that of MT3II due to the different substitution position of thiophene. As a consequence, the QSS-DSSC with the MPhII-based quasi-solid-state electrolyte achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.36% under global air-mass (AM 1.5G) sunlight (100 mW cm−2), with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 15.22 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 782 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, which also exhibits good long-term stability under one-sun soaking for more than 2000 h.

Experimental
Synthesis of ionic conductors
ICs were synthesized in two steps, as shown in Fig. S1a:† first, by replacing the hydrogen atom on one nitrogen atom of imidazole with phenyl28 or thienyl29 and then by quaternizing the other nitrogen atom with methyl iodide. Specific steps are as follows:
Synthesis of intermediates

1-Phenyl-1H-imidazole28. 
A mixture of iodobenzene (1 mmol), imidazole (1.5 mmol), KOH (2.0 mmol), DMSO (1.5 mL) and CuI (0.2 mmol) was charged into a 100 mL two-necked flask under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred at 120 °C for 24 h. The cooled mixture was diluted with H2O and extracted with ethyl acetate. After being dried over MgSO4, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation until viscous oil remained. Silica gel chromatography with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (10/1, v/v) as the eluent afforded the pure product as a viscous yellow oil (yield, 70%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 7.85 (s, 1H), 7.49–7.43 (m, 2H), 7.37–7.33 (m, 3H), 7.27 (s, 1H), 7.21 (s, 1H).


1-(2-Thienyl)-1H-imidazole29. 
This compound was obtained with the same procedure as for 1-phenyl-1H-imidazole, except that the starting materials iodobenzene, KOH and CuI were replaced with 2-bromothiophene, CsCO3 and Cu(OAc)2·H2O, respectively. The yield was 66%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 7.71 (s, 1H), 7.15 (s, 1H), 7.12 (s, 1H), 7.09 (dd, J = 5.1, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 6.94 (dd, J = 7.9, 2.6 Hz, 2H).


1-(3-Thienyl)-1H-imidazole29. 
This compound was obtained with the same procedure as for 1-(2-thienyl)-1H-imidazole, except that the starting material 2-bromothiophene was replaced with 3-bromothiophene. The yield was 62%. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 7.82 (s, 1H), 7.43 (dd, J = 5.2, 3.2 Hz, 1H), 7.24 (d, J = 1.1 Hz, 1H), 7.21 (dd, J = 3.2, 1.4 Hz, 1H), 7.18 (dd, J = 5.2, 1.4 Hz, 2H).

Synthesis of the ionic conductors
One of the above-mentioned compounds (0.02 mol), 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and iodomethane (0.04 mol) were charged into a 50 mL three-necked flask equipped with a condenser tube and stirred at 50 °C for 48 h. Then, the reaction mixture was precipitated to produce the ICs of MPhII, MT2II and MT3II as white powders (Fig. S1b†) with yield greater than 90%. The stretching vibration peaks of phenyl and thienyl groups appear at 1600–1400 cm−1 and 1639 cm−1, respectively, while the peaks at 3055 cm−1 and 3138 cm−1 are identified as the C–H stretching vibration of the aryl lateral group (Fig. S2†).

Preparation of quasi-solid-state electrolytes and fabrication of QSS-DSSCs
The mixtures of IC, I2, LiI, and TBP at a molar ratio of 12:1:2:10 were first dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and methanol (1/1, v/v), and then the liquid electrolytes were solidified by adding 4 wt% SiO2 to the system. Finally, the mass ratio of the solvent in the quasi-solid-state electrolyte is about 18%. The quasi-solid-state electrolytes containing different ICs are indicated as QSS-IC, such as QSS-MPhII, QSS-MT2II, and QSS-MT3II. For comparison, the IC is replaced with 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) to prepare the reference quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSS-DMPII) at the same ratios.
15 μm-thick TiO2 films on the FTO substrates were obtained with a screen-printing method. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The films were then treated with TiCl4 (0.05 M) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. When cooled down to around 120 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into N719 dye solutions (0.3 mM) for 20 h at room temperature. The dye-loaded TiO2 film functioning as the working electrode and the Pt-coated FTO as the counter electrode were separated with a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. The quasi-solid-state electrolyte was injected between the working and counter electrodes at 80 °C from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the predrilled holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
Characterization
ICs were characterized by 1H NMR (Varian 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometer). Mass spectra were obtained on a microTOF II-10257 (Bruker Compass Data Analysis 4.0). Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed on a simultaneous thermal analyzer SDT-Q600 system (TA Instruments, America) with nitrogen as purge gas (80 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of 20–700 °C. Fourier transition infrared (FT-IR) measurements were performed on FT-IR spectrometer IRAffinity-1 (Shimadzu Corporation). Crystal structures of ICs were acquired on a Bruker SMART diffractometer equipped with an APEX(II)-CCD area detector using graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a Keithley 2420 source meter (A Tektronic Company) under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G solar light (Newport-94043A). The simulated light was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Oriel PN 91150 V) equipped with a KG5 filter. The action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were recorded using an SM-250 Hyper Mono-Light system (Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (S1337-1010BQ). The electrolytes were sandwiched in dummy cells between two platinized FTO electrodes, which were used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in a frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz and for Tafel polarization measurements at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with an electrochemical workstation (Zahner CIMPS-1, Germany).
Results and discussion
The single crystals of ICs can grow from the mixed solvent solution of methanol and diethyl ether in a fridge. The three single crystals are transparent and colorless. Crystal structure analyses (Tables S1–S3†) reveal that MPhII (CCDC 1523312†) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c, while the MT3II (CCDC 1517957†) and MT2II (CCDC 1523955†) crystals belong to the orthorhombic space groups of Pca21 and Pna21, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the single crystal structures of the three ICs. For MPhII, the phenyl ring and the imidazolium ring are approximately coplanar with a dihedral angle of 10.51° (Fig. S3a†). However, the thiophene ring and the imidazolium ring form a larger dihedral angle of 36.84° (Fig. S3b†) for MT2II, which results from the repulsive interaction between the S and N atoms. When the substitution site is changed from position-2 to position-3, that is from MT2II to MT3II, the repulsion between the S atom and the N atom diminishes due to the increased distance between them, leading to weakened torsion tension between the thiophene ring and the imidazolium ring. As a result, the dihedral angle decreases from 36.84° for MT2II (Fig. S3b†) to 10.31° for MT3II (Fig. S3c†). The coplanarity between the imidazolium ring and the thiophene ring is influenced by the substitution position of thiophene.
The packing configurations of the three ICs are distinct, as shown in Fig. 2, which shows the packing orientation of the imidazolium cation and the location of iodide. The neighboring cations (that is the coplanar phenyl imidazolium) in the MPhII crystal are stacked together in parallel, forming a lamellar structure (Fig. 2a). For MT2II, the nonplanar 2-thienyl imidazolium cations are arranged with the neighboring imidazolium rings in parallel, but the neighboring thiophene rings are in a cross arrangement (Fig. 2b), due to the interaction between the S atoms in the thiophene ring. However, the adjacent coplanar 3-thienyl imidazolium cations in the MT3II crystal are arranged in a V-shape orientation (Fig. 2c), which is again attributed to the interaction between the S atoms in the thiophene ring. The packing structures suggest that the π–π interactions increase in the order of MT3II < MT2II < MPhII. The shortest path of electron transfer between adjacent iodides, which is indicated by green labels in Fig. 2, increases in the order of MPhII (5.3 and 6.4 Å) < MT2II (6.3 Å) < MT3II (7.9 Å). This implies that a strong π–π interaction is favorable for reducing the distance between neighboring iodides in the shortest path. The electron transfer rate is expected to increase with decreasing the distance between neighboring iodides.

TG and DSC measurements were carried out to determine the thermal properties of the three ICs. Fig. 3a shows the TG curves of the three ICs. The temperature at 2% weight loss is regarded as the decomposition temperature (Td), which is determined to be 222, 227 and 234 °C for MT2II, MPhII and MT3II, respectively. As the three ICs have the same anion, the thermal stability depends on the imidazolium cation, which is affected by the substituent. For MPhII and MT3II, which have comparable dihedral angles (Fig. S3†) between the imidazolium and phenyl (or thienyl) rings, the positive charge on the imidazolium ring is a major factor influencing the thermal stability. Compared to the phenyl substitution, the S atom with two free electrons in MT3II reduces the positive charge of the imidazolium cation, which is likely responsible for the higher decomposition temperature (or higher thermal stability) for MT3II. As for MT2II, the strong torsional strain between the thienyl ring and the imidazolium ring, as revealed by its larger dihedral angle (Fig. S3†), decreases the thermal stability. Therefore, the decomposition temperature of MT2II is lower than that of MT3II and even lower than that of MPhII. The high decomposition temperatures ensure that these ICs do not decompose for outdoor applications, in which the maximum temperature is usually 80 °C.
 Fig. 3  (a) TG and (b) DSC curves of the three ICs. 

Fig. 3b displays the DSC curves of the three ICs, where two endothermic peaks are observed for each IC. The left peak is attributed to the phase transition from solid to liquid, while the right one is due to the decomposition of matter. Melting points determined from the left DSC peak are 117, 158 and 166 °C for MPhII, MT2II and MT3II, respectively. The difference of melting points for the three ICs is likely attributed to their different unit cell volumes.2 Usually, a smaller unit cell volume brings about a higher melting point for similar compounds. Since the unit cell volume decreases in the order of MPhII (4477.1 Å3) > MT2II (2141.3 Å3) > MT3II (2100.1 Å3), as shown in Tables S1–S3,† it is reasonable that the melting point increases in the order of MPhII (117 °C) < MT2II (158 °C) < MT3II (166 °C).30
The ionic conductivity of the three IC-based quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSS-MPhII, QSS-MT2II, and QSS-MT3II) was determined through EIS analysis of the dummy cells with the FTO/Pt/electrolyte/Pt/FTO configuration. Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots of the three quasi-solid-state electrolytes, which can be explained by the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, according to the literature.31 The series resistance (Rs) is determined by the real axis intercept in the high frequency region. The left semicircle located in the high-frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct for one electrode and 2 Rct for two electrodes) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the corresponding constant phase angle element (CPE). The right semicircle in the low-frequency region corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte.32 The electrochemical parameters for each electrolyte are obtained by fitting the EIS spectra, which are shown in Table 1. Rs is the same for all the three electrolytes because the same electrodes are used for the EIS measurements. The ionic conductivity (σ) of the electrolyte can be calculated from ZN following the equation: σ = d/(ZN × A), where d is the distance between the two electrodes (here 30 μm) and A is the active area (here 0.36 cm2) of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte. QSS-MPhII has the smallest ZN (1.0 Ω), corresponding to the highest conductivity of 8.3 mS cm−1 among the three QSS-IC electrolytes. For the two isomers, QSS-MT2II shows a lower ZN (1.3 Ω) than QSS-MT3II (2.0 Ω), indicating that the former exhibits higher conductivity (6.4 mS cm−1) than the latter (4.2 mS cm−1). On the basis of these results, we conclude that benzene substituted imidazolium iodide is better than the thiophene substituted imidazolium iodide, and the second position substitution is better than the third substitution of thiophene in terms of conductivity. For comparison, the conductivity of QSS-DMPII is determined to be 3.0 mS cm−1 (Fig. S4a†), which is lower than those of the QSS-ICs.

The main contribution to the ionic conductivity of imidazolium iodide based quasi-solid-state electrolytes comes from the charge transfer along the polyiodide chain according to the relay-type Grotthuss mechanism.33 The Grotthuss charge exchange is influenced by the distance between adjacent iodides, which can be revealed by the packing structures of a single crystal22,23 (Fig. 2). The shortest charge transfer path between iodine atoms in MPhII follows a zigzag pattern, where the transfer distance is 5.3 and 6.4 Å alternately (Fig. 2). Similarly, the distance of the shortest charge transfer path is 6.3 and 7.9 Å for MT2II and MT3II, respectively. As the Grotthuss charge transfer rate is inversely correlated with the I−–I− distance, the conductivity thus increases in the order of QSS-MT3II < QSS-MT2II < QSS-MPhII. On the other hand, the lamellar structure of the MPhII cation (Fig. 2) is also favorable for stronger π–π interactions, which can promote faster charge transfer.34 Interestingly, the conductivity of QSS-MT2II is about 50% higher than that of QSS-MT3II due to the different I−–I− distance arising from the different substitution position.
The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity is shown in Fig. 4b. The conductivity (σ) increases with the temperature following the Arrhenius equation: σ = σ0exp(−Ea/RT), where σ0 is a constant, Ea is the activation energy, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.35 The linear dependence of lnσ on 1/T indicates that these IC-based electrolytes are ionically conductive, which is attributed to the charge transfer along the polyiodide chain according to the relay-type Grotthuss mechanism.33 A lower slope of the linear dependence of lnσ on 1/T represents a smaller Ea, the energy barrier that must be overcome for charge transfer. According to the literature report,36 a shorter distance between iodide/polyiodide species can promote Grotthuss bond exchange (I−+ I3− = I3− + I−) and thus leads to efficient charge transfer. As the distance between adjacent iodide/polyiodide species decreases in the order of MT3II > MT2II > MPhII (Fig. 2), the charge transfer becomes more efficient in the sequence of MT3II < MT2II < MPhII. For this reason, the obtained Ea (16.7 kJ mol−1) for QSS-MT3II is larger than that for QSS-MT2II (11.3 kJ mol−1), and the latter is larger than that for QSS-MPhII (8.1 kJ mol−1). The sequence of ionic conductivity at RT is QSS-MT3II < QSS-MT2II < QSS-MPhII for the same reason.
Tafel polarization is a convincing electrochemical characterization method to test the diffusion rate of the electrolyte. Fig. 5 shows the Tafel polarization curves of the three QSS-IC electrolytes, where the limiting diffusion of I3− takes place in the high-potential region. The limiting current densities (Jlim), which are summarized in Table 1, decrease in the order of QSS-MPhII (178 mA cm−2) > QSS-MT2II (142 mA cm−2) > QSS-MT3II (89 mA cm−2). Jlim is proportional to the diffusion coefficient of I3−, D(I3−), according to the equation: Jlim = 2ne0D(I3−)c(I3−)NA/d, where n is the number of exchanged electrons, e0 is the elementary charge, c(I3−) is the triiodide concentration, NA is the Avogadro number and d is the distance between the two electrodes.31D(I3−) is calculated to be 2.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, 2.3 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and 1.4 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for QSS-MPhII, QSS-MT2II, and QSS-MT3II, respectively (Table 1). As the concentrations of ICs and other additives are same in the three QSS-IC electrolytes, the difference of D(I3−) is believed to arise from their different crystal structures (Fig. 2). The larger D(I3−) stems from the shorter distance between the neighboring iodides. Because the distance between neighboring iodides decreases in the order of MT3II > MT2II > MPhII, D(I3−) increases in the same order. The electrolyte based on phenyl substituted imidazolium iodide shows the highest ionic conductivity as a result of its highest D(I3−). For comparison, QSS-DMPII shows a Jlim of 72 mA cm−2 and a D(I3−) of 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 (Fig. S4b†), which are lower than those of QSS-ICs.

The Tafel curve also provides information on the exchange current density (J0) from the slope in the middle potential region.37 Here, J0 represents the reduction rate of I3−. QSS-MPhII and QSS-MT2II show a larger slope than QSS-MT3II according to Fig. 5, indicating that the interfacial reaction I3− + 2e− → 3I− occurs at a faster rate for QSS-MPhII and QSS-MT2II than for QSS-MT3II. More I3− species of QSS-MPhII and QSS-MT2II can move to the interface between the counter electrode and the electrolyte than those of QSS-MT3II due to the higher D(I3−) for the former two electrolytes, accounting for the larger J0 for the former two electrolytes. We can conclude that the charge transfer at the counter-electrode/electrolyte interface is more effective for QSS-MPhII and QSS-MT2II than for QSS-MT3II. The result is consistent with the Rct data that also reflect the interfacial charge transfer behavior.
The photocurrent density–voltage curves of the three QSS-ICs-based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6a, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The QSS-MPhII based DSSCs exhibited a Jsc of 15.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 782 mV, and an FF of 0.70, corresponding to a PCE of 8.36%. Under the same conditions, the QSS-MT2II and QSS-MT3II based DSSCs showed efficiencies of 7.92% (Jsc = 14.95 mA cm−2, Voc = 779 mV, and FF = 0.69) and 6.81% (Jsc = 14.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 750 mV, and FF = 0.64), respectively. Evidently, the substituent group on the imidazolium ring exerts a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance. By comparison, the phenyl substitution is able to yield higher Jsc and PCE than the thienyl substitution. For the thienyl-substituted isomers, the position-2 substitution is better than the position-3 substitution in terms of all photovoltaic performance parameters. The difference of Jsc among the three quasi-solid-state electrolytes is attributed to their different ionic conductivities. The QSS-MT3II electrolyte shows the lowest FF as a result of its largest Rct. The lowest Voc is the result of its lowest Jsc. Owing to the highest conductivity and lowest Rct, the QSS-MPhII electrolyte produces the highest PCE and FF among the three electrolytes.

For comparison, the photovoltaic data of the reported quasi-solid-state electrolytes gelated with SiO2 nanoparticles in combination with the N719 dye are also included in Table 2. The ethanol solution of LiI, I2 and TBP solidified with SiO2 nanoparticles yielded a PCE of 6.1% under illumination of 91.3 mW cm−2.38 The propylene carbonate based gel electrolyte containing 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII), iodine, N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) and Triton X-100 and SiO2 nanoparticles showed a PCE of 5.4%.39 The ionic gel electrolyte with SiO2 nanoparticles containing LiI, I2, NMBI, and MPII dissolved in 3-methoxypropionitrile generated a PCE of 6.71%.40 By comparison, the QSS-MPhII evidently demonstrates an improvement over the reported SiO2 based quasi-solid-state electrolytes.37–40 As compared to other quasi-solid-state electrolytes, such as polymer gel,12,13,16,41 graphene tailored polymer gel42 and Al(III)-TBP based metal–organic gel,43 the QSS-MPhII shows better or comparable PCE using the same dye sensitizer. Under the same conditions, the DSSC with the QSS-DMPII electrolyte produced a PCE of 6.51% (Fig. S5†). Direct comparison reveals that the QSS-MPhII gel developed in this work demonstrates advantages over the QSS-DMPII and most reported gel electrolytes and is a promising quasi-solid state electrolyte for highly efficient QSS-DSSCs.

Fig. 6b shows IPCE as a function of wavelength. The IPCE value in the visible region reflects the dye regeneration rate in different IC-based DSSCs. The IPCE increases in the order of MT3II < MT2II < MPhII, which is consistent with the Jsc tendency. Significantly, the highest IPCE of the QSS-MPhII based DSSCs reaches 83%, which echoes the highest conductivity of QSS-MPhII.
To detect the long-term stability, the QSS-DSSC based on QSS-MPhII was soaked under one-sun illumination for 2012 h. In the light soaking period, the J–V curves of the QSS-DSSC based on QSS-MPhII were frequently recorded under AM 1.5G illumination, and the photovoltaic performance parameters are plotted against time, as shown in Fig. 7. At the initial illumination for 100 h, Jsc, Voc and FF increased to some extent, resulting in an increment of PCE in this period, because aging of the QSS-DSSC is favorable for the infiltration of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte into the photoanode for improved interfacial contact. After the initial 100 h, Voc and FF remained unchanged basically up to 2012 h, while Jsc first decreased from 100 to 300 h followed by a plateau up to 2012 h. As a consequence, the PCE gradually increased at the initial 100 h, presented a decline until 300 h, and then was almost constant up to 2012 h. After light soaking for 2012 h, the PCE was still 7.62%, which was 97% of the initial value (7.84%). In a word, all the four photovoltaic performance parameters remained nearly constant from 300 to 2012 h, confirming that the DSSCs based on QSS-MPhII had good long-term stability.

Conclusions
We have synthesized three imidazole-based ICs by linking aromatic groups to the imidazolium ring and obtained their single crystal structures. When applied as quasi-solid-state electrolytes, the QSS-DSSCs exhibit different photovoltaic performances due to the different ionic conductivities of the electrolytes. The difference of ionic conductivity arises from the different crystal packing structures. The smallest distance between adjacent iodides and the approximately planar structure of MPhII are favorable for efficient charge exchange along the polyiodide chain, which endows QSS-MPhII with higher conductivity than thienyl substituted imidazolium iodides. The substitution position of the thienyl group can also affect the conductivity. MT2II possesses higher conductivity than MT3II because the former has a shorter distance between adjacent iodides than the latter. Owing to the highest conductivity among the three QSS-IC electrolytes, QSS-MPhII-based DSSCs exhibit the highest PCE of 8.36%. Interestingly, the PCE of QSS-DSSCs increased by 16.3% from 6.81% to 7.92% when the substitution position of the thienyl group was changed from position-3 to position-2. The experimental results indicate that the conductivity of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte and the corresponding photovoltaic performance depend largely on the substituent and the substitution position. Importantly, the QSS-MPhII-based DSSC presents good long-term stability under one-sun soaking for 2012 h. These findings may introduce an effective strategy to design ionic conductors with high conductivity for application in highly efficient and stable QSS-DSSCs.
