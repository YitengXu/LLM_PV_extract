    , Accepted 6th January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractOrganic based graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) can be good candidates as carrier extraction interlayers for organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, owing to the possibility of tuning the band edge energy levels through varying the width and the type of edge functionalization. By using the density functional theory (DFT) method, the electronic structures of H or F edge functionalized armchair type GNRs on MAPbI3(001) are calculated. It is shown that the electronic structure of H- or F-passivated GNRs is almost undisrupted by the non-covalent interaction with the PbI2 surface layer of MAPbI3(001), thereby one can tune the width and edge chemistry of GNRs to enhance the carrier extraction or blocking. Especially all H-GNRs five to ten carbon atoms wide exhibit good matching for hole extraction, while F-GNRs require a specific width for electron extraction. Exploiting the unzipping synthesis of carbon nanotubes in the solution phase, our result provides a facile strategy for efficient carrier extraction.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells have improved enormously in power conversion efficiency during the last ten years, from initially 3.8% based on CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I)1 to a recently certified efficiency of 25.2%,2 owing to a lot of efforts such as solvent engineering for fewer defects,3 band-gap tuning by mixed anions or organic cations,4 morphology control into a thin film,5 and so on. Compared to commonly used Si based solar cells, cheaper solution processing makes them very promising for mass production and commercialization, even though there still remain some issues such as Pb-free materials, large area growth and long term efficiency.6 In spite of the sizable amount of impurities expected in solution based synthesis, the observed high efficiency is attributed to the intriguing electronic properties, for example, defect tolerance,7 and polaron behavior of carriers,8 which result in a carrier diffusion length exceeding 1 μm.9 The organic cations in the perovskite light absorber are one of the essential components for desirable electronic properties, but they are known to impede the long-term stability where the initial performance tends to drop significantly due to charge accumulation,10 moisture attack,11 UV irradiation12 or poor thermal stability of adopted carrier extraction materials. The overall performance is crucially affected by the detailed structure of the interface between the light absorber and electron-transporting material (ETM) or hole-transporting material (HTM). By using La-doped BaSnO3 as an ETM13 or inorganic CuCSN14 replacing commonly used organic HTMs (Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS), the long-term stability has been improved up to one thousand hours, which indicates the important role of carrier extraction materials.
To protect the perovskite light absorber, many studies have used graphene derivatives, usually graphene oxides (GO), as an interlayer.15 For example, NH3 modified GO has been inserted between MAPbI3−xClx and PEDOT:PSS,16 or GO between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD.17 Reduced GO (rGO) between Spiro-OMeTAD and Au,18 rGO added to mp-TiO2,19 N-doped GO nanoribbons between MAPbI3 and FTO,20 GO between MAPbI3−xClx and ITO,21 a GO + PEDOT:PSS composite HTL,22 and graphene flakes in a mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold23 also have been studied. Some performance improvement observed by those studies has been explained by several aspects: mostly good matching of the band alignment, good wettability via oxygen bonding to Pb as well as carbon's π–π interaction with organic Spiro-OMeTAD HTL,24 and the hydrophobic characteristic of graphene or its fluorinated flakes.25 It was also shown that rGO is beneficial for both transporting carriers and prohibiting potential-induced chemical reactions between the Au electrode and CuSCN HTM.14 Furthermore, graphene or porous carbon can be used as hole electrodes.26–28 However, in most studies with graphene-based interlayers, the atomic structures are not clearly identified, so that the electronic structure at the interface is rarely understood. By controlling the morphology and chemistry of graphene-based materials, one might be able to gain further improvement. It has been shown that weakly interacting van der Waals interfaces are very helpful for rational design of novel electronic properties.29–31 In particular, semi-metallic graphene results in a Schottky barrier when it is interfaced with a semiconductor, while semiconducting graphene nanoribbons can show type I or II junction behaviour depending on the energy gap and electron affinity. In this paper, we propose to use graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) as the interlayers. GNRs can be synthesized in the solution phase by unzipping carbon nanotubes,32 which can be easily employed in MAPbI3 growth and device fabrication. Additionally, GNRs can be bottom-up synthesized with atomically straight edges and their band gaps can be tailored by varying the width through the quantum confinement effect.33 In addition to tuning the band gap, one can functionalize the GNR edges in order to have a good band offset and good binding between the perovskite and HTM or ETM.
Here, we report the electronic structure of the hetero-interface between edge functionalized armchair-edge GNRs and MAPbI3. Edge functionalization by hydrogen and fluorine is considered to study the band alignment with respect to MAPbI3(001) as well as the width variation to tune the band gap.
Computational section
All calculations have been performed by using the DFT method as implemented in the VASP code.34 A plane wave energy cutoff of 400 eV was used with the PBE parameterization of the GGA exchange–correlation functional.35 In the case of bulk MAPbI3, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is included. For a reliable prediction of the band gap and band edges, an accurate description of the screened exchange interaction is needed. The most efficient method in terms of accuracy and computational cost has been the hybrid functional approach with including a fraction of exact exchange. Among various forms, two kinds have been widely used for condensed materials, modified HSE36,37 and PBE0α.38,39 Since two parameters, α (the fraction of exact exchange) and μ (the inverse of the dielectric screening length), need to be found for modified HSE, we here use PBE0α with the value of α to be found self-consistently by calculating the dielectric constant (α = 1/ε∞). For a large size system like heterostructures reaching up to six hundred atoms in one unit cell, PBE0α calculations are still a formidable task. We follow the method of exchange–correlation energy correction with reference to the electrostatic potential in the bulk or vacuum region.40
For the MAPbI3 crystal, the room temperature tetragonal phase (I4/mcm)41 is considered with the lattice parameters a = 8.80 Å and c = 12.69 Å, where the C–N bond axis of organic cations is directed along the cubic [110] axis, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Our net dipole moment of the cations is chosen to be zero along the x and y directions, but we confirmed that the band structure remains nearly the same for other configurations of [110] dipoles. For the armchair edge GNRs, a width of seven carbon atoms along the transverse direction is considered for computational convenience, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c) for the hydrogen (H-GNR) and fluorine (F-GNR) passivated cases, respectively, where other widths of GNRs are also explored to study the band alignment between edge-functionalized GNRs and MAPbI3. For H-GNR, the minimum energy lattice constant is found to be 4.26 Å. For F-GNR, the ribbon shape is not perfectly flat like H-GNR, but it is rippled to minimize the Coulomb repulsion between in-plane p orbital electrons of F, thus we examined the primitive cell and supercells extended by three and six times. It is found that the band edge levels have almost converged values when the cell size is tripled (Fig. S1, ESI†). The minimum energy lattice parameter of F-GNR is 12.87 Å.
 Fig. 1  Atomic structures of (a) MAPbI3 (I4/mcm), (b) H-GNR, and (c) F-GNR. For each, the top view along [001] and side view along [100] are shown. 
For the MAPbI3 surface, we consider PbI2 terminated MAPbI3(001) as it is relevant to efficiency enhancement.42 It is modeled by a symmetric six-layer slab with a vacuum size of 15 Å as shown in Fig. 3(a). The in-plane lattice size is extended to  of the tetragonal unit with a lattice parameter 12.45 Å, which is smaller than that of the tripled unit (3 × 4.26 = 12.78 Å) of H-GNR or one unit (12.87 Å) of F-GNR by 2.5% or 3.2%, respectively. For the hetero-interface of MAPbI3 and an edge functionalized GNR, the effects of the lattice mismatch on the binding energy and the electronic structure are examined. The orientational configuration of the MA dipoles is chosen to be that of the bulk and is mirror-reflected with respect to the central PbI2 layer. The dipole correction is included to avoid an unphysical interaction between periodic images. The atomic positions of the central PbI2 layer and the adjacent MAI layers are fixed as the bulk positions.
The used k-mesh is 2 × 2 × 1 for the tetragonal MAPbI3, 9 × 1 × 1 for H-GNR and 3 × 1 × 1 for F-GNR. All the atomic positions are optimized until the force is less than 0.01 eV Å−1, including the van der Waals correction by the Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) method.43 For the slab structures, the optimization is done with one k-point (Γ) mesh, afterwards a 2 × 2 × 1 k-mesh is used for the density of states (DOS).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the band structures of the tetragonal MAPbI3, H-GNR and F-GNR by the PBE and PBE0α methods, where spin orbit coupling (SOC) is considered for MAPbI3. The PBE method is known to underestimate the band gap significantly, where our results are 0.69 eV for MAPbI3, 1.67 eV for H-GNR, and 1.07 eV for F-GNR. In the PBE0α method, the fraction of exact exchange is obtained self-consistently by calculating the electronic dielectric constant (α = 1/ε∞). In the case of MAPbI3, the PBE result without SOC (α = 0.187 = 1/5.36) is adopted for the PBE0α + SOC calculation, because it gives almost the same value as that reported by PBE0α + SOC (α = 0.188 = 1/5.32).39 Our calculated value of ε∞ = 5.36 is consistent with other theoretical and experimental values varying from 4.5 to 6.5.44 With using almost the same value of α, our calculated band gap of 1.49 eV within PBE0α + SOC is reasonably consistent with reported values.39,45 For H-GNR and F-GNR, the values of α = 1/ε∞ that we found self-consistently within PBE0α are 0.54 = 1/1.84 and 0.49 = 1/2.04, respectively. The band gaps are 3.58 eV for H-GNR, and 2.86 eV for F-GNR. For H-GNR, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) states at Γ are doubly degenerate, while they are split for F-GNR. This is due to the additional presence of the out-of-plane pz orbital of F, which forms a π bond with the edge carbon atoms’ pz orbitals.

The electronic structure of PbI2-terminated MAPbI3(001) within the PBE method is studied by using the symmetric slab model shown in Fig. 3(a). In order to eliminate the artificial dipole potential caused by the periodic images, each of the lower atomic layers including the organic cations is obtained by the mirror reflection of the associated upper layer about the central PbI2 atomic layer. It has been reported that orientationally ordered organic cations are energetically preferred with a significant bending of the band edges along the net dipole moment direction,46 but here we exclude such an effect by making the net dipole moment vanish to focus on the interface electronic structure. As shown in the side view of Fig. 3(a), the surface layer atoms are relaxed significantly with the Pb or I atoms displaced inward or outward, respectively. To compare the electronic structures between MAPbI3(001) and the bulk, we choose a reference of the bulk electrostatic potential. In the plot of Ves(z) in Fig. 3(b), the potential is averaged from the central layer to the layer denoted by (S-4), where 〈Ves〉 = −2.4 V. When the local density of states (LDOS) for each layer is plotted against this reference, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the LDOS at the layer (S-4) is almost the same as that of the bulk shown in the lowest panel. It indicates that our model is good enough to analyze the variation of the electronic structure from the bulk to the surface region. As we move from the bulk or (S-4) to the surface layer (S), the VBM mainly driven by I shifts higher in energy, while the CBM mainly driven by Pb almost remains the same. In the literature, these two levels are commonly chosen as the band edges. But, here we consider the surface states as they are mainly responsible for most chemical reactions including carrier extraction or injection. It is noted that the CBM of surface Pb is likely to be an exponential tail of the bulk conduction band edge states lying at the (S-2) or (S-4) layer, while the VBM of surface I is the surface state. From the contribution of surface atomic orbitals, a state is regarded as a surface state when the surface Pb or I orbitals contribute more than half. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the filled surface state (FSS) appears at −5.65 eV, and the empty surface state (ESS) at −3.70 eV, both relative to the vacuum potential energy (Evac ∼ 5.0 eV).

Fig. 4 shows the optimized hetero-structure of H-GNR or F-GNR adsorbed onto MAPbI3(001). By the unavoidable lattice mismatch along the ribbon axis, we considered two kinds of lattice parameter ahet for each structure, corresponding to either MAPbI3(001) or {H,F}-GNR, that is ahet = 12.45 or 12.78 Å for H-GNR@MAPbI3(001), and ahet = 12.45 or 12.87 Å for F-GNR@MAPbI3(001). Our calculated binding energy and the layer roughness are listed in Table 1. By the adsorbate–surface interaction, the surface layer roughness ΔzPbI2 is changed to 1.04 and 1.06 Å or 1.33 and 1.58 Å for the H-GNR or F-GNR case, respectively, where it was 1.02 Å for the clean surface. When ahet = 12.45 Å is used, the ribbon is significantly rippled, ΔzGNR = 1.52 or 3.28 Å for H-GNR or F-GNR, respectively, mainly due to the compressive strain. When ahet is fitted to the lattice constant of the isolated GNR, the rippling is suppressed to ΔzGNR = 0.94 or 1.99 Å for H-GNR or F-GNR, respectively, but substantially differs from that of the isolated GNR (ΔzGNR = 0.0 or 2.78 Å for the isolated H-GNR or F-GNR, respectively). It indicates a significant interatomic interaction. For F-GNR on MAPbI3(001), the shortest interatomic distance between the edge F and the surface PbI2 is 3.21 Å for F–Pb, and 3.46 Å for F–I, and the C atoms of F-GNR have shortest interface distances of 3.86 Å for C–Pb, and 3.67 Å for C–I. In the case of H-GNR on MAPbI3(001), they are 3.52 Å for C–Pb, and 3.79 Å for C–I. An H atom of H-GNR has shortest distances of 3.90 Å for H–Pb, and 3.34 Å for H–I. The average vertical distance (havg in Table 1) from the PbI2 surface layer is 3.36 and 3.54 Å for H-GNR and F-GNR, respectively. The optimized interface structure suggests that a covalent type interaction is unlikely. The calculated binding energy, using ahet corresponding to the isolated GNR in Table 1, is −3.56 eV or −3.50 eV per unit cell for H-GNR or F-GNR, respectively, which is defined as Eb = EX-GNR@MAPbI3(001) − EX-GNR − EMAPbI3(001) where EX-GNR@MAPbI3(001), EX-GNR and EMAPbI3(001) are the total energies of the hetero-structure, the isolated GNR and the clean surface, with X = H or F, by using the same value of ahet. When ahet = 12.45 Å, the calculated binding energies are −3.89 and −3.58 eV u.c.−1 for H-GNR and F-GNR, respectively. When divided by the number of C atoms (42) of the GNRs per unit cell, they are as small as ∼−0.08 and −0.09 eV C−1 for both H-GNR and F-GNR. From the atomic charges within the radius 0.863 Å of C, there is a ∼0.1 electron deficiency for the edge C bonded to F as compared to inner C atoms while all the C atoms have the same value for H-GNR, thus the binding energy of F-GNR@MAPbI3(001) is expected to be greater than that of H-GNR@MAPbI3(001) due to the ionic interaction at the interface. However, from our result, the interface bonding is greater for H-GNR than F-GNR, that is −3.56 versus −3.50 eV u.c.−1, respectively. The opposite result is attributed to the van der Waals interaction being more dominant than the ionic interaction. For example, by decomposing the total energies into the PBE energy and the TS dispersion energy, their individual contributions to the total binding energy are 0.26 and −3.82 eV u.c.−1, respectively, for H-GNR@MAPbI3(001), and 0.18 and −3.50 eV u.c.−1 for F-GNR@MAPbI3(001). The enhanced binding by the dispersion interaction for H-GNR might be due to the less rippled shape of H-GNR than F-GNR when GNRs are adsorbed on MAPbI3(001). From our analysis, the interface is formed mainly by the non-covalent interaction, which maintains the intrinsic electronic structures, as will be seen in the following.

The interface electronic structures are calculated by the PBE method. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the band structures with the indicated contributions of the surface Pb or I atoms, and GNR carbon atoms, where the energy levels are relative to the bulk average electrostatic potential as in Fig. 3(c). The surface states of MAPbI3(001) are chosen similar to the case of the clean surface (Fig. S2, ESI†), whose filled and empty levels are indicated by the arrows in Fig. 5. The energy levels of FSS and ESS are almost unchanged when the adsorbed species are changed from H-GNR to F-GNR, consistent with the non-covalent interaction between the GNRs and MAPbI3. But the VBM and CBM of F-GNR lie substantially lower than those of H-GNR due to the high electronegativity of F. It is noted that the energy levels shift down overall by ∼0.1 eV when the value of ahet = 12.45 Å is adjusted to that of {H,F}-GNR (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†), which makes the band offset remain nearly the same under strain.

The lattice parameter is ahet = 12.45 Å. The energy levels are in reference to the average electrostatic potential at the center layers as in Fig. 3(c). The indicated arrows are the extracted main peaks of the surface states (more than 50% contribution of the surface layer atoms) for the valence and conduction bands (Fig. S3, ESI†). 
For accurate prediction of the band alignment, we correct the band edge levels of the heterostructures calculated by PBE. In the case of GNRs, a shift by PBE0α with reference to the vacuum level calculated for the free standing GNRs is applied. In the case of MAPbI3(001) surface states, a shift by PBE0α + SOC with reference to the bulk electrostatic potential (〈Ves〉) calculated for the tetragonal MAPbI3 is applied. Our levels before and after the corrections relative to the vacuum level are listed in Table 2 for the H-GNR or F-GNR heterostructure. In the case of H-GNR@MAPbI3(001), the VBM of H-GNR lies very close to the FSS of MAPbI3(001), while the CBM lies 1.9 eV higher than the ESS, which is good for electron blocking. In the case of F-GNR@MAPbI3(001), the VBM of F-GNR lies 0.4 eV lower than the FSS of MAPbI3(001), while the CBM lies 0.6 eV higher than the ESS. It is noted that both the FSS and ESS levels shift upward by ∼0.1 eV as the adsorbate is changed from H-GNR to F-GNR, probably due to the more repulsive electrostatic potential by electron-rich F than H.

The valence and conduction band states of GNRs, which are composed of carbon π orbitals, exhibit the quantum confinement effect with the ribbon width. With increasing the width, the energy gap decreases. Fig. 6 shows our calculated energy levels of the VBM and CBM for H-GNR and F-GNR with varying the width Wn from five to ten, which denotes the number of carbon atoms along the transverse zigzag chain. When Wn = 3p + 2, where p is an integer, the size of the gap is smaller than the other cases (Wn = 3p and 3p + 1). Also, for the same type of Wn, the gap decreases gradually due to the quantum confinement effect. For H-GNR, shown in Fig. 6(a), the overall level of the CBM (VBM) is higher than that of the PBE0α + SOC corrected ESS (FSS) of clean MAPbI3(001), −4.24 (−6.03) eV indicated by the horizontal dashed line. This indicates that H-GNR is good for an electron-blocking and hole-extraction interlayer. In the case of F-GNR, the periodicity is a bit different from that of H-GNR. This is due to additional coupling of pz orbitals of edge fluorine atoms to the existing carbon π bond network, where nearly the same behavior is observed for the flat F-GNR. However, this effect is less noticeable as the width of F-GNR is increased. The CBM varies around the ESS as Wn increases, and the VBM does around the FSS, although the CBM and VBM shift down significantly compared to those of H-GNR. Thus it is not good enough for either electron or hole extraction. However, it has been shown that the energy levels are significantly influenced by the termination types of MAPbI3(001), where both the valence and conduction band edges increase by ∼1.0 eV when the termination type is changed from PbI2 to MAI type.47 Considering a mixture of two termination types, we indicate the average surface state levels of MAPbI3(001) in Fig. 7 with a variation of 0.5 eV upward or downward. By tailoring the width of each GNR, we can obtain desirable interface electronic structures. To be specific, H-GNR with Wn = 5, 8, 9 can work as a hole transfer layer at the interface. Electron transfer is also feasible for the F-GNR/MAPbI3 interface when F-GNR with Wn = 5 or 9 is chosen.

The horizontal dashed lines denote the levels of the filled (−6.03 eV) and empty (−4.24 eV) surface states of MAPbI3(001) after the PBE0α + SOC correction.

Horizontal dashed lines depict the occupied (−5.53 eV) and empty (−3.74 eV) surface state levels of clean MAPbI3(001) with a variation of 0.5 eV due to the two termination types. Wn = 5 is chosen for the hole-extraction or electron-blocking by H-GNR, while Wn = 9 is for electron-extraction or hole-blocking by F-GNR. 
Furthermore, recent work shows that fluorine incorporation in the HTL (Spiro-OMeTAD) can improve the efficiency and the stability of PSCs.48 However, according to our calculations, F-GNR does not allow hole transfer, though electron transfer may still be feasible. It is noted that graphene is good for hydrophicity,49 but it can allow both hole50 and electron51 transfer. Our result shows that H-GNR is clearly advantageous since it blocks electrons and allows holes to transfer. Thus using Spiro-OMeTAD/H-GNR/MAPbI3 can be more beneficial than using only Spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI3 or inserting GO at the interface, since the H-GNR interlayer will provide stability against moisture while maintaining the efficiency of the hole transfer (electron blockage) process, which is not possible with a graphene interlayer. This result is fairly robust since the ability of H-GNR to act as a hole transfer layer is independent of its width (Fig. 6a).
Conclusion
DFT and hybrid-functional based calculations were performed to study the interface electronic structures between edge functionalized armchair edge GNRs and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3(001). It was shown that hydrogen or fluorine edge passivation leads to non-covalent type interactions with MAPbI3(001) where the electronic structure of the H- or F-passivated GNR is almost undisrupted. The calculated adsorption energy is −3.56 or −3.50 eV per surface unit cell for H- or F-passivated GNRs, respectively. For the studied types of GNRs, H-GNRs five to ten carbon atoms wide exhibit good matching for hole extraction, while F-GNRs require a specific width for electron extraction. This work paves the way towards further improvement of efficiency by adopting armchair edge GNRs with proper edge groups and width as the carrier extraction interlayers.

 	Fig. 2  Band structures of (a) MAPbI3, (b) H-GNR, and (c) F-GNR by the PBE and PBE0α methods with spin orbit coupling (SOC) included for MAPbI3.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Top and side views of clean MAPbI3(001). The indicated lateral unit cell corresponds to  of the bulk tetragonal cell. From the outmost surface layer, denoted by (S), to the fourth atomic layers, denoted by (S-4), all the atomic positions of the upper and lower parts are optimized, while the central three atomic layers are fixed as the bulk positions. (b) In-plane averaged electrostatic potential against the out-plane-coordinate. (c) Layer-resolved local density of states (LDOS) for Pb and I atoms by PBE, in comparison with those of the tetragonal bulk, with an energy level reference of the average electrostatic potential (e〈Ves〉) over the central layer for MAPbI3(001) or the unit cell for the tetragonal. Filled and empty curves denote the valence and conduction band states, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Top and side views of the optimized structure of (a) H-GNR@MAPbI3(001), and (b) H-GNR@MAPbI3(001). In the top view, only the surface and ribbon layers are shown for clarity.
