    , Accepted 23rd October 2020First published on 24th October 2020AbstractTwo types of small molecule nonfullerene acceptors (IDICO1 and IDICO2) based on 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC) are synthesized by attaching octyl side-chains onto terminal end groups. The alkyl substitution increases the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (−3.81 to −3.86 eV) of the two acceptors, compared to that of IDIC (−3.94 eV). Interestingly, the IDICO1 and IDICO2 films have higher integrated absorption coefficients (1.49 × 107 cm−1) than the IDIC (1.29 × 107 cm−1) film. Also, the electron mobilities of IDICO1 and IDICO2 are approximately twice as high as that of IDIC. The terminal octyl substitution also improves the miscibility with a donor polymer (PBDB-T) to form well-intermixed blends with a decreased π–π stacking distance. As a result, their photovoltaic devices exhibit significant improvements in both the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, compared to those of the reference PBDB-T:IDIC device, exhibiting maximum power conversion efficiencies of up to 9.64%, 20.4%, and 1.68% under 1-sun, 1000-lx LED, and halogen lamp illumination, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of PBDB-T:IDIC (7.2%, 11.7%, and 1.2%, respectively). It is worth noting that a maximum power density of 141.4 μW cm−2 is achieved for the PBDB-T:IDICO2-based device under a halogen lamp, which is the highest value reported to date among those achieved under indoor lighting conditions.
1. Introduction
Recently, there has been a remarkable increase (over 17%) in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) because of the introduction of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), which feature exceptional optical and electrical properties.1–5 In addition to harvesting outdoor light, OPVs exhibit large potential in terms of indoor power generation under various artificial lightings, such as fluorescent (FL) lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and halogen lamps, owing to their large absorption coefficient, highly tunable optical absorption, and small leakage currents under dim lighting conditions.6,7 Furthermore, their light weight and mechanical flexibility make them shape-adaptable and suitable for power sources of various types of indoor Internet of Things (IoT) wireless sensors.8–16 Indoor light has a significantly narrower spectrum and lower light intensity than natural light.17–19 With regard to the design of efficient OPVs for indoor applications, the photoactive layers should have well-matched absorption with indoor lightings and high charge transport properties to maximize light harvesting while minimizing the leakage current.7,20,21
Significant improvements in the PCEs of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) of up to 28% under a 1000-lx FL lamp and 26.1% under a 1000-lx LED have been reported.22,23 However, the direct comparison of PCEs for indoor light harvesting has not been very successful, given that their emission spectra are different, depending on the sources of indoor lightings. Instead, the output power is the more important parameter to be considered in terms of the practical application of IPV devices. Research on the use of IPVs under halogen lamps has been relatively limited, although halogen lamps are more advantageous for power generation than other types of indoor lighting resources, because of their relatively high input power density and broad spectrum, and they exhibit monotonically increasing spectral irradiance from visible light to near infrared (IR) regions. For example, even though the PCEs of IPV cells remain as low as 0.8% under halogen lamps due to the spectral mismatch between the absorption of the photoactive layer and the irradiance spectrum of the halogen lamps (Table S1†), a relatively high power output of 66.5 μW cm−2 was achieved (note the highest output powers of 78.8 μW cm−2 under a 1000-lx LED and 91.0 μW cm−2 under 1000-lx FL lamps reported so far).23,24 Therefore, it is important to develop photoactive materials with the light-absorption coverage of the spectral range of halogen lamps. Low band gap acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type NFAs with strong light absorption in the NIR region can be ideal candidates for high-performance IPV devices under halogen lamps.25–28
The reduced open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) values under indoor conditions, compared to those under 1-sun conditions, are critical issues that need to be addressed because the photocurrent (or JSC) is linearly proportional to the incident photon flux (i.e., light intensity), and the VOC is logarithmically proportional to the photocurrent. Therefore, low band gap A–D–A NFAs should be designed carefully to optimize the JSC and VOC at the same time when they are applied to IPVs under halogen lamps. To optimize the light absorption in the NIR region with minimized leakage currents, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and crystalline morphology with tight packing must be considered in the molecular design to increase the JSC.29–33 Electronegative halogen substituents, such as fluorine and chlorine, are often introduced to modulate the ICT and intermolecular packing via noncovalent coulombic interactions.34–38 However, halogen substitution often leads to VOC loss because of the down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), compared to that of the unsubstituted mother structure. As an alternative route, the choice of alkyl side-chains and their substitution patterns can significantly influence the solution processability and aggregated nanostructures in films.27,39–42 In particular, the incorporation of electron-releasing alkyl (or alkoxy) side-chains can elevate the LUMO and change the packing structure in the film state.43,44 Thus, it is expected that the incorporation of alkyl chains at judiciously chosen positions on NFAs can simultaneously improve the VOC and JSC by increasing the LUMO level, light absorption and electron mobility with enhanced crystalline packing.
In this study, we synthesized two types of n-type NFAs (IDICO1 and IDICO2) based on 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC) by attaching octyl side-chains onto the 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile (INCN) terminal moieties. Their optical, structural, and photovoltaic characteristics under 1-sun and indoor lightings (LED and halogen lamps) were studied by comparing them with those of IDIC. The incorporation of alkyl substituents increased the LUMO of IDICO1 and IDICO2, compared to that of IDIC, and significantly modified the crystalline packing structures in films, as evidenced by the results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Therefore, the pristine IDICO1 and IDICO2 films had electron mobility that was approximately twice as high as that of the reference IDIC film. Interestingly, IDICO1 and IDICO2 exhibited significantly enhanced integrated absorption coefficients in the film state (1.49 × 107 cm−1), compared to that of IDIC (1.29 × 107 cm−1). The combined enhancements of the light absorption and electrical properties of IDICO1 and IDICO2 significantly impacted the photovoltaic properties with substantial improvements in both VOC and JSC under both outdoor and indoor conditions. With a polymer donor of poly[2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T), the OPV devices with IDICO1 (or 2) had much higher PCEs (up to 9.6%, 20.4%, and 1.68%) than the IDIC-based device (7.2%, 11.7%, and 1.2%) under 1-sun conditions, LED and halogen lamp lighting, respectively. In particular, under the conditions of 1000-lx halogen lamp illumination, the PBDB-T:IDICO2 devices delivered state-of-the-art photovoltaic performance with a maximum power output (Pmax) of 141.4 μW cm−2, which is the highest reported value under indoor conditions to date. This study presents an interesting example wherein the trade-off relationship between the VOC and JSC is overcome by tailoring the molecular design and modulating the packing structures in a solid state.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
We synthesized two IDIC derivatives by incorporating octyl side-chains onto the terminal INCN end groups at 6 or 5 position to yield IDICO1 and IDICO2, respectively (Scheme 1). First, the IDIC core was substituted with hexyl side-chains through a reaction with 1-bromohexane using potassium tert-butoxide in dimethylsulfoxide. Thereafter, it was converted into 4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-dicarboxaldehyde (ID-CHO) in 55% yield via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with POCl3 and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Two types of terminal INCN moieties of 6-octyl-3-dicycanovinylindan-1-one (INCNO1) and 5-octyl-3-dicycanovinylindan-1-one (INCNO2) were prepared by following our previous report.45 The ID-CHO and terminal INCNO1 (or INCNO2) moiety were reacted to yield IDICO1 (or IDICO2) in approximately 70% via the Knoevenagel condensation. The molecular structures of IDICO1 and IDICO2 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 2D Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry as shown in the ESI.† The detailed synthetic procedures and the corresponding characterization data are presented in the Experimental section.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2 in dilute chlorobenzene solution and film are presented in Fig. 1a and Table 1. In solution, all three NFAs exhibited almost identical spectra with similar maximum absorption at λabs = 655 to 660 nm and a molar absorption coefficient (εsol) of approximately 3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In the film state, the spectra were substantially red-shifted by approximately 50–60 nm, compared to those in the solution, thereby exhibiting an extended conjugation by strong intermolecular interactions in the solid state. IDICO1 and IDICO2 exhibited slightly blue-shifted absorption maxima (λabs = 709 and 707 nm, respectively), compared to that of IDIC (λabs = 721 nm). The absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption wavelength (λabs = 709, 707, and 721 nm) were determined to be 1.56 × 105 cm−1 for IDICO1, 0.97 × 105 cm−1 for IDICO2, and 0.91 × 105 cm−1 for IDIC. It is worth noting that the IDICO1 and IDICO2 films exhibited significantly higher absorption coefficients than the IDIC film. The integrated absorption coefficients (within the range of 300 to 900 nm) were measured to be the same (1.49 × 107 cm−1) for IDICO1 and IDICO2, which was significantly higher than that of IDIC (1.29 × 107 cm−1). The optical bandgaps of the three molecules deduced from the absorption edges in the film state were determined to be 1.59, 1.65, and 1.60 eV for IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2, respectively. With regard to the donor polymer, PBDB-T exhibited two main absorption peaks at 575 and 606 nm, as shown in Fig. S1.†

The blend films of PBDB-T:IDIC NFAs (1:1 by weight) were prepared under the same conditions as for optimized devices, and their absorption coefficients were likewise measured. Seven blend films for each D:A pair were prepared by varying the film thickness, and their absorbances were carefully measured (Fig. 1b). The integrated absorption coefficients (within the range of 300 to 900 nm) of the blend films were determined to be 1.48 × 107 cm−1 for PBDB-T:IDICO1, 1.46 × 107 cm−1 for PBDB-T:IDICO2, and 1.37 × 107 cm−1 for PBDB-T:IDIC. Even after blending with the donor polymer, the PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 films exhibited higher absorption coefficients than the PBDB-T:IDIC film. The stronger absorption of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 may have originated from the different film morphology, increasing the number of molecules per unit thickness, which will be discussed in the following section.
The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of the three molecules were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1c), relative to an internal standard (ferrocene/ferrocenium, Fc/Fc+ couple). It is worth noting that IDICO1 and IDICO2 exhibited elevated LUMOs (−3.81 and −3.86 eV, respectively), compared to that of the reference IDIC (−3.94 eV). The higher LUMOs of IDICO1 and IDICO2 were mainly attributed to the electron-donating effect of the alkyl substituents on the terminal INCNs.43,45 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of IDIC, IDICO1 and IDICO2 were determined to be −5.64, −5.69 and −5.74 eV, respectively. Thus, the elevated LUMOs and increased absorption coefficients of IDICO1 and IDICO2 in the film state are expected to increase both the VOC and JSC of their OPV devices. The FMO electronic structures were also calculated via density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level. Based on the optimized geometries, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.76 and −5.98 eV, respectively, for IDIC. With the introduction of the electron-donating octyl substituents, IDICO1 and IDICO2 exhibited higher LUMO (−3.65 and −3.66 eV, respectively) energy levels than IDIC (−3.76 eV); these results are consistent with the experimental results. As presented in Fig. S2,† the planar conformations were calculated for all three structures. The incorporation of alkyl side-chains onto the terminal INCN unit did not disturb the planar geometry, with negligible changes in torsional angles along the molecular backbone.
Using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the decomposition temperatures (with 5% weight loss) of all three NFAs were measured to be approximately 320 °C, thereby showing similar thermal stabilities (Fig. S3†). DSC was used to investigate the melting and crystallization behavior of the three NFAs (Fig. 1d). The second heating/cooling cycle is shown after the thermal history was removed. By incorporation of the octyl substituents at different positions, the melting points were significantly changed: 236 °C (enthalpy change of melting, ΔHm = 38.6 J g−1) for IDIC, 249 °C (ΔHm = 44.5 J g−1) for IDICO1, and 216 °C (ΔHm = 22.8 J g−1) for IDICO2. It is worth noting that the crystallization transitions in the cooling scan were measured only for IDICO1 and IDICO2. The crystallization temperatures were measured to be 183 °C (enthalpy change of crystallization, ΔHc = 28.6 J g−1) for IDICO1 and 175 °C (ΔHc = 20.5 J g−1) for IDICO2. In contrast, IDIC showed a cold crystallization, rather than a cooling crystallization, during the heating scan, which was measured at 126 °C.46 It may indicate that IDIC does not crystallize completely during the first cooling process at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1, which is the same scanning rate as that of IDICO1 and IDICO2.47 It further indicates that IDICO1 and IDICO2 have a higher tendency to crystallize, which will be discussed in detail in the GIWAXS measurements. It is inferred that the different melting and crystallization behavior must influence the intermolecular packing properties. Moreover, the cooling crystallization in IDICO1 and IDICO2 indicates a more favorable formation of ordered packing structures in the presence of terminal alkyl substituents, thereby influencing the crystalline film morphology.48,49
2.2. Photovoltaic characteristics under outdoor and indoor conditions
The photovoltaic properties of the IDIC derivatives were characterized under 1-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) and two 1000-lx indoor lighting conditions, i.e., LED (0.28 mW cm−2) and halogen (8.4 mW cm−2) lamps (Fig. 2). The OPV devices were prepared in a conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br50/Ag. Blend solutions were prepared in o-dichlorobenzene (D:A = 1:1, weight ratio) with a concentration of 16–22 mg mL−1 without the use of processing additives. It is noted that no post-treatment methods, such as thermal and solvent annealing, were applied. The optimized active layer thicknesses were 83, 104, and 105 nm (with standard deviations less than 5 nm) for PBDB-T:IDIC, PBDB-T:IDICO1, and PBDB-T:IDICO2, respectively. A substantial improvement in the photovoltaic performance under 1-sun illumination was observed for the IDICO1- and IDICO2-based OPV devices. The PBDB-T:IDICO1 and the PBDB-T:IDICO2 blend-based devices exhibited maximum PCE values of 9.60% (VOC of 0.92 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 15.1 ± 0.47 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.68 ± 0.02) and 9.64% (VOC of 0.92 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 14.8 ± 0.24 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.69 ± 0.02). In contrast, the reference device based on the PBDB-T:IDIC blend exhibited a relatively low photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE value of only 7.23% (VOC of 0.85 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 11.5 ± 0.35 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.71 ± 0.01). The enhancements of the PCE values for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2, compared to that of PBDB-T:IDIC, corresponded to increases in the VOC and JSC values. The increase in VOC from 0.85 to 0.92 V was ascribed to the up-shifted LUMO levels of IDICO1 and IDICO2 because the VOC is closely associated with the energy offset between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.51,52 The JSC increment in PBDB-T:IDICO1 (or 2), in relation to that in PBDB-T:IDIC, was confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement of the devices using an incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) system (Fig. 2d). The EQE spectra under 1-sun conditions revealed stronger spectral responses in the range of 400–700 nm for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2, compared to that for PBDB-T:IDIC. The calculated JSC values from the EQE data were 11.11 mA cm−2 for PBDB-T:IDIC, 14.98 mA cm−2 for PBDB-T:IDICO1, and 15.07 mA cm−2 for PBDB-T:IDICO2, respectively, demonstrating consistency with the measured JSC values (Table 2). The higher EQE and calculated JSC (approximately 15 mA cm−2) for PBDB-T:IDICO1 (or 2), compared to those of PBDB-T:IDIC, were ascribed to the larger absorption of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 than that of PBDB-T:IDIC. As discussed previously, the absorption coefficients of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 (1.46 to 1.48 × 107 cm−1) were significantly larger than that of PBDB-T:IDIC (1.37 × 107 cm−1). Furthermore, the optimized devices were thicker for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 than that for PBDB-T:IDIC, where the different optimum thicknesses of blend films must be related to the film morphology. The optimized devices of the three NFAs exhibited similar exciton separation, charge transport, and electron–hole recombination characteristics, which are discussed in the following section. The combined effect of the higher absorption coefficient and thicker active layer in the IDICO1 and IDICO2 blended devices can increase their light absorption by ∼1.35 times compared to that of PBDB-T:IDIC. The measured JSC values (∼15 mA cm−2) of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 under 1 sun conditions were ∼1.3 times larger than that (11.5 mA cm−2) of PBDB-T:IDIC, showing a good agreement.

A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation was carried out to examine the light absorption characteristics of three devices. Refractive optical constants (n, k) were extracted using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (Fig. S4 and S5†). The FDTD simulation considers not only the primary light absorption but also the interference with light reflected from a metal electrode; this allows us to estimate the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside the device architecture. The absorption density distributions for the devices with three different photoactive layers are exhibited in Fig. S6.†53,54 Similar to the absorption spectra of the blend films, PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 exhibited higher absorption density in the range of 300–800 nm compared to that of PBDB-T:IDIC. Interestingly, larger absorption around 400 nm was also observed from PBDB-T:IDICO1- and PBDB-T:IDICO2-based devices, where all three blend films have negligible absorption (see Fig. 1b). Depending on the thickness values of the photoactive layers, the light interference and distribution in the devices can be varied. In this context, the different thickness values of the PBDB-T:IDIC, PBDB-T:IDICO1, and PBDB-T:IDICO2 layers (83, 104, and 105 nm, respectively) are believed to induce distinctive light distribution, leading to the different absorption profiles in the wavelength range around 400 nm. These results show a good agreement with the EQE data, supporting the higher JSC values of the two devices.
The photovoltaic characteristics under indoor lightings (LED and halogen) were studied by varying the light intensity from 200 to 2000 lx (Tables S2 and S3†). A relatively low VOC reduction was observed as the light source changed from 1-sun to LED illumination, whereas JSC decreased by approximately 3 orders of magnitude, compared to that under 1-sun illumination. These changes can be explained using the equivalent circuit model for solar cells, wherein the VOC is logarithmically proportional to the photocurrent, and the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the incident photon flux (i.e., light intensity).55 Under LED lighting (1000-lx, 0.28 mW cm−2), the PBDB-T:IDIC-based device had a VOC of 0.67 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 73.6 ± 8.0 μA cm−2, and FF of 0.57 ± 0.03, thereby yielding a maximum PCE of 11.71%. In comparison, the PBDB-T:IDICO1-based and PBDB-T:IDICO2-based devices exhibited remarkably higher photovoltaic PCEs of 20.41% (VOC of 0.76 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 120.7 ± 9.0 μA cm−2, and FF of 0.61 ± 0.04) and 19.16% (VOC of 0.74 ± 0.02 V, JSC of 112.7 ± 14.3 μA cm−2, and FF of 0.59 ± 0.05), respectively (Table 2). Similar to the device performances under 1-sun conditions, the PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2-based devices had significantly larger VOC and JSC values than the IDIC-based devices under LED illumination. In particular, the JSC of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 increased by ∼1.5 times compared to that of PBDB-T:IDIC. It is consistent with the result of higher absorption within the range of 300–800 nm for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 in the FDTD calculation result, which is the main irradiance wavelength range under LED illumination. Thus, the maximum power output significantly increased from 32.8 μW cm−2 for PBDB-T:IDIC to 57.2 and 53.7 μW cm−2 for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2, respectively. With increasing the luminance of LED lightings, the VOC, JSC and output powers increased gradually for all devices. For PBDB-T:IDIC, the VOC and JSC increased from 0.59 to 0.69 V and from 22.5 to 154.2 μA cm−2 at 200 lx and 2000 lx, respectively. The PBDB-T:IDICO1 (or 2) devices also showed significantly improved VOC and JSC values with increasing the intensity of LED lightings (VOC: 0.65–0.67 to 0.76–0.77 V, JSC: 37.5–41.2 to 233 μA cm−2 at 200 and 2000 lx, respectively). It is noteworthy to mention that the same trend was measured irrespective of the light intensities (Table S2†): substantially higher VOC and JSC were measured for PBDB-T:IDICO1 (or 2) than for PBDB-T:IDIC.
Under halogen lighting (1000-lx, 8.4 mW cm−2), the maximum PCEs of 1.22%, 1.58%, and 1.68% were measured for PBDB-T:IDIC, PBDB-T:IDICO1, and PBDB-T:IDICO2, respectively. Consistent with the trends under 1-sun and LED illumination conditions, higher VOC (0.77 V) and JSC values (252 to 271 μA cm−2) for the PBDB-T:IDICO1- and PBDB-T:IDICO2-based devices were observed compared with those of the IDIC-based device (0.71 V and 203 μA cm−2). A similar trend was also observed under the varied luminance (200–2000 lx) of halogen lightings (Table S3†). These PCE values under the halogen lighting conditions were not high because of the strong output spectrum of the halogen lamp, which exceeds 800 nm, thereby causing a strong mismatch between the absorption of the photoactive layers and the irradiance spectrum of the halogen lamp (Fig. 2b). However, the viable output power densities under halogen lighting can be significantly greater than those under other indoor light sources such as LEDs and FL lamps. For instance, the irradiance power of a halogen lamp (8.4 mW cm−2) is around 30 times that of an LED (0.28 mW cm−2) at the same level of luminance (1000 lx). We compared the power densities of the three different OPV devices under a halogen lamp. The PBDB-T:IDICO1- and PBDB-T:IDICO2-based devices exhibited remarkably high Pmax of 132.4 and 141.4 μW cm−2, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the Pmax of 141.4 μW cm−2 from PBDB-T:IDICO2 is the highest power density of an OPV device under indoor lighting thus far. The power output under halogen lighting is high enough to operate low-power-consumption indoor electronics such as radio frequency identification devices (RFID), smoke detectors, and motion detectors, which typically consume power within the range of 1–100 μW when on stand-by.9,56,57
To elucidate the charge generation, recombination, and transport characteristics in the devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) was measured with respect to the effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 3a.33 The photocurrent is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively; Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is 0, and V represents the applied voltage.58 The Jph was significantly higher for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 than for PBDB-T:IDIC, thereby exhibiting consistency with the measured J–V characteristics. The exciton separation probability P(E,T) was calculated via the following equation: P(E,T) = JSC/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density. The Jsat values (at Veff = 3 V) were measured to be 12.1, 16.0, and 15.5 mA cm−2 for the IDIC-, IDICO1-, and IDICO2-based devices and the resulting P(E,T) values were determined to be 95.0%, 94.0%, and 95.6%, respectively. The comparable P(E,T) values indicate that the charge-generation efficiencies are nearly identical for all three blended devices, which can be excluded from the viable origins for the differences in the measured JSC values.
 Fig. 3  (a) Jphversus Veff, (b) JSCversus light intensity and (c) VOCversus light intensity for PBDB-T:NFA blends. 
Thereafter, the light intensity (Plight)-dependent JSC and VOC characteristics were explored to understand the charge recombination features. Under short-circuit conditions, the JSCvs. Plight curves were measured, and were analyzed using JSC ∝ Plightα, where α represents the power factor. A negligible bimolecular recombination is expected when α is 1.58 In Fig. 3b, all the devices with IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2 blends had almost identical α values of approximately 0.91, thereby indicating that all three blends exhibited similar bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. The bimolecular recombination was similar even though the charge-generation was increased for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 due to the enhanced light absorption as a result of their larger absorption coefficient and thicker active layer, compared with those for PBDB-T:IDIC. The VOC characteristics, by varying the Plight under open-circuit conditions, were likewise investigated. The foregoing was based on the equation VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively (Fig. 3c).58 The value of n represents the existence of carrier traps in the photoactive layer. When n is close to 1, it indicates that bimolecular recombination is predominant. When n is greater than 1, it indicates the existence of trap-assisted recombination and tail-state recombination inside the band gap.59,60 The three devices exhibited comparable n values of 1.06 to 1.24, thereby suggesting similar trap-assisted charge recombination for all three devices.
Lastly, the charge-transport properties were also investigated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements with hole- and electron-only devices.61 The hole- and electron-only devices were fabricated with the device configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)]/Al, respectively. The electron mobilities (μe) for the pristine films of the IDIC derivatives were measured to be 4.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDICO1 and 4.76 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDICO2, thereby exhibiting values twice as high as that for IDIC (1.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher μe of IDICO1 and IDICO2 may be ascribed to the different crystalline packing structure in the solid state, which will be discussed in detail in the following section. Furthermore, the hole mobilities (μh) and μe values were obtained for all the blend films. As shown in Table S4,† the hole/electron mobilities are 2.27 × 10−4/3.52 × 10−5, 2.02 × 10−4/4.50 × 10−5, and 1.28 × 10−4/2.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:IDIC (μh/μe = 6.45), PBDB-T:IDICO1 (μh/μe = 4.49), and PBDB-T:IDICO2 (μh/μe = 5.40), respectively. A more balanced charge mobility in the PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICIO2-based devices allowed the FF to be maintained despite an increase in the charge generation of the thicker devices.
2.3. Film morphologies and packing structure analysis
To understand the crystalline packing and molecular stacking orientations of the three SMAs in detail, GIWAXS measurements were performed for the pristine and blend films of IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2 (Fig. 4). In the pristine films, IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2 exhibited clearly different scattering patterns. IDIC was reported to have a 2D brickwork structure via the π–π stacking of the terminal INCN end groups of neighboring IDIC molecules.62 For all three molecules, a strong peak at qz = 0.57–0.68 Å−1 was observed showing a layer spacing of 9.31, 10.65 and 11.12 Å for IDIC, IDICO1, and IDICO2 thin films, respectively, suggesting that hexyl side chains at the indacenodithiophene core are perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. S7†). Since the hexyl substituents are located in both the upward and downward directions, the conjugated plane is expected to be tilted slightly. In the packing structures, a d-spacing of 9–11 Å corresponds to approximately 1/2 of the molecular length in the vertical direction, taking into account some degree of interdigitation of hexyl side chains and the tilted packing structures. Here, the qz direction is assigned as the [100] crystal direction. In the qz profile (at qxy = 0 Å−1), the reason why only peaks with a d-spacing corresponding to 1/2 of the total layer spacing are observed is because the packing structure has a 2-fold screw axis along the qz direction. In a structure having such a symmetry element (21 screw axis), only ‘h = even’ peaks are observed among (h00) diffraction peaks due to systematic absences. Therefore, the first peak is assigned as the (200) peak. IDIC shows a strong π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.72 Å−1 (with a d-spacing of 3.66 Å) along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. In contrast to IDIC, IDICO1 and IDICO2 exhibited several dotted scatterings in the vertical direction, thereby suggesting a clearly enhanced crystalline ordering with a 3D reticular packing structure.62–64 In the case of the IDICO1 film, a strong π–π stacking peak (qxy = 0.54 Å−1, qz = 1.59 Å−1) was observed in a tilted direction (approximately 17°) from the z axis, thereby suggesting that the cofacial π–π stacking had an inclined orientation relative to the substrate. The IDICO2 film exhibited similar but more well-resolved scattering patterns, compared to IDICO1. IDICO2 also showed a strong π–π stacking (qxy = 0.58 Å−1, qz = 1.55 Å−1) in a tilted direction (approximately 20°) from the z axis. In the case of in-plane (IP) 1D GIWAXS profiles, many scattering peaks were observed for IDICO1 and IDICO2 films (Fig. S8 and S9†). Although we could not assign all the peaks, a peak at qxy = 0.40 Å−1 and its higher order peaks show a d-spacing of 15.55 Å which is 1/2 of the molecular length (31.1 Å) along the parallel direction. Similarly, IDICO2 also shows a peak at qxy = 0.39 Å−1 and its higher order peaks which are related to the molecular length (32.48 Å). The additional IP scattering peaks (together with higher order peaks) of pristine IDICO1 and IDICO2 films may suggest higher crystallinity compared to IDIC, but it can also be interpreted as having multiple phases or multiple orientations at the same time. It is worth noting that the octyl substituent in the terminal INCN moieties caused a drastic change in the molecular packing structures, which must be ascribed to the larger absorption coefficients of IDICO1 and IDICO2. The remarkably improved crystalline ordering in the IDICO1 and IDICO2 pristine films is consistent with the electron mobility of pristine films in the SCLC measurements (Table S4†). In the case of the pristine PBDB-T film, a clear (010) peak at 1.62 Å−1 (dπ–π of 3.88 Å) in the OOP direction and a (100) peak at 0.27 Å−1 (dlamellar of 23 Å) in the IP direction were measured to show a predominant face-on orientation (Fig. S10†).
 Fig. 4  2D GIWAXS images of pristine acceptor films of (a) IDIC, (b) IDICO1 and (c) IDICO2, and blend films of (d) PBDB-T:IDIC, (e) PBDB-T:IDICO1 and (f) PBDB-T:IDICO2. 
All the blend films of the three SMAs exhibited a strong and broad (010) peak in the OOP direction, together with a lamellar scattering in the IP direction, thereby showing a face-on-dominated orientation (Fig. 4d–f). We carefully analyzed the (010) scattering of the blend films, which was deconvoluted by multiple-peak Gaussian fitting (Fig. S11 and Table S5†). The (010) peak in PBDB-T:IDIC was deconvoluted into two peaks at qz = 1.57 and 1.71 Å−1, where a main peak at qz = 1.57 Å−1 showed a π–π stacking distance of 3.99 Å. The strong IP scattering at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 (dlamellar of 22.3 Å) was measured from the PBDB-T lamellar packing, and multiple peaks from IDIC were also intensified (compared to that for the IDIC pristine film) in the IP direction. This suggests that PBDB-T and IDIC may suffer from poor miscibility in their blends. In contrast, many dotted scattering spots from IDICO1 and IDICO2 disappeared and they lost their orientation in the blends of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2. Moreover, the lamellar peak of PBDB-T at qxy = 0.28 Å−1 became hump-shaped, thereby suggesting that PBDB-T and IDICO1 (or 2) have better miscibility than PBDB-T:IDIC. In the case of PBDB-T:IDICO1, the OOP (010) peak was deconvoluted, and the strongest (010) scattering was measured at qz = 1.66 Å−1 (dπ–π spacing of 3.80 Å). A smaller dπ–π spacing with tighter cofacial intermolecular stacking was observed, compared to that for PBDB-T:IDIC. Similarly, PBDB-T:IDICO2 presented two main (010) scatterings at qz = 1.68 and 1.79 Å−1 (with dπ–π spacings of 3.74 and 3.52 Å, respectively) in the OOP direction, thereby showing a much densely packed structure than PBDB-T:IDIC. The terminal octyl substitution significantly influenced the miscibility and blend morphology with PBDB-T as well as the intermolecular packing of IDICO1 and IDICO2 in their pristine films. Interestingly, although both the IDICO1 and IDICO2 pristine films showed higher crystalline packing, relative to IDIC, they demonstrated better miscibility with the donor polymer PBDB-T to form well-intermixed and face-on oriented blends with a significantly decreased π–π stacking distance, thereby suggesting an important role of terminal octyl substituents in IDIC in terms of the packing and miscibility with PBDB-T.
The surface morphology of active layers was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, the as-cast PBDB-T:IDIC, PBDB-T:IDICO1, and PBDB-T:IDICO2 blend films demonstrated comparable root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (within the range of 1.33 to 1.45 nm). There is no clear difference in the height images for the three films. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were also performed to investigate the blend morphologies (Fig. 5d–f). The PBDB-T:IDIC film exhibited the largest phase separation, compared to those of the other two blend films, which may be attributed to the poor miscibility of PBDB-T and IDIC, as discussed in the previous section.46,65 The TEM images of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 exhibit a well-intermixed and interpenetrating blend morphology, thereby suggesting that efficient charge-transport channels are formed, even in films thicker than the PBDB-T:IDIC film.

3. Conclusions
A minor structural modification of the IDIC-based NFAs by introducing terminal alkyl substituents induced significant changes in the FMO energy levels, intermolecular packing structures, and the resulting optical and electrical properties, compared to those of the IDIC mother structure. The three NFAs exhibited almost identical UV-vis spectra with a maximum absorption at λabs = 655 to 660 nm and similar molar absorption coefficients of approximately 3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution. However, significantly higher integrated absorption coefficients in the film state (up to approximately 1.5 × 107 cm−1) were measured for IDICO1 and IDICO2, compared to that for IDIC (approximately 1.3 × 107 cm−1). The IDICO1 and IDICO2 pristine films likewise exhibited electron mobilities that were approximately twice as high as that of IDIC. The different optical and electrical properties of IDICO1 and IDICO2, compared to those of IDIC, are ascribed to their more crystalline and tightly packed structures. The LUMO levels of IDICO1 and IDICO2 structures were also increased owing to the electron-releasing effect of the octyl substituents. The photovoltaic properties of the IDIC derivatives were investigated under 1-sun illumination and two indoor lighting conditions (i.e., LED and halogen lamps). Among the devices, PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 exhibited significantly enhanced VOC and JSC values relative to PBDB-T:IDIC. Although the exciton separation, carrier transport, and recombination exhibited no noticeable differences between the three blends, substantially higher photovoltaic performances were measured for PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2, compared to those for PBDB-T:IDIC, thereby showing maximum PCEs of up to 9.64%, 20.4%, and 1.68% under 1-sun, LED, and halogen lamp illumination, respectively. The elevated LUMO and enhanced light absorption of PBDB-T:IDICO1 and PBDB-T:IDICO2 in the film state increased both VOC and JSC simultaneously, thereby overcoming the trade-off relationship between these two parameters. In particular, the maximum power density of 141.4 μW cm−2 was measured for PBDB-T:IDICO2 under a halogen lamp, which is the highest value reported thus far in relation to indoor lighting conditions. Careful modification of the alkyl substituent position in NFAs may serve as an efficient strategy to finely modulate their packing structures, FMO energy levels and miscibility in blends for further optimizing the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells.
4. Experimental section

ID-CHO, INCNO1, and INCNO2 were synthesized following procedures that were previously reported.25,26,45

4.1.3 Organic photovoltaic device fabrication. 
The OPV devices were fabricated using a conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned with acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol via ultrasonication and dried in an oven at 85 °C for 30 min. PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS AI4083) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm onto the ITO substrate and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Blend solutions were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (D:A = 1:1 weight ratio) with a blend solution concentration of 16 to 22 mg mL−1 and stirred at 110 °C for 8 h. The substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were transferred into a glove box, and then, the active layers were spin-coated at 1800 rpm. The active layer was dried for 2 h under vacuum (1 × 10−6 Torr), and the PNDIT-F3N-Br solution (1 mg mL−1) in methanol was spin-coated at 2500 rpm as an interlayer. Finally, a 120 nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited through a shadow mask using a thermal evaporator under vacuum (1 × 10−6 Torr). The active area of devices was 0.164 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PBDB-T:IDIC, PBDB-T:IDICO1, and PBDB-T:IDICO2 were measured using a solar simulator (K201 LAB55, McScience) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) conditions. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured using a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience). The luminance and irradiance of the indoor light sources were accurately measured using a Sun spectroradiometer (S-2441C, HIDAMARI mini II, Japan). With regard to indoor photovoltaic characterization, a halogen lamp (OSRAM ECO PRO CLASSIC 64543 A 240V 46W E27; OSRAM, Munich, Germany) with an irradiance of 8.4 mW cm−2 (luminance of 1000-lx) and an LED lamp (McScience, Republic of Korea) with an irradiance of 0.28 mW cm−2 (luminance of 1000-lx) were utilized. The light intensities of the two indoor lighting conditions were controlled by utilizing a slidac voltage regulator (SD-1000; DSELECTRON, Republic of Korea).
