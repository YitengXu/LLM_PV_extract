    , Accepted 1st March 2019First published on 1st March 2019AbstractThere remains a grand challenge to develop sustainable and pollution-free energy to replace the current dominant but gradually “depleting” fossil fuels. Electrochemical energy conversion presents a promising “bridge” to mitigate energy shortage issues and minimize the ecological implications by synergy with the ever-increasing sustainable energies (e.g., wind and solar). It thus calls for exploring high-activity, low-cost, and long-durability electrocatalysts to facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in electrochemical energy conversion systems. This review focuses on summarizing the recent progress in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for several important electrochemical redox reactions which are critical to implement conversion between electrical energy and chemical energy, especially for bifunctional electrocatalysts applied in a single electrochemical conversion system, including water electrolyzers with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), zinc–air batteries with the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and fuel cells with small molecule (e.g., glucose, urea, and hydrazine hydrate) oxidation reactions (MOR) and the ORR. Special emphasis has been placed on investigating the progress of electrocatalyst synthesis and strategies for improving the electrocatalytic performance and the associated devices' performance in terms of activity, stability, power density etc. We also put forward the major challenges and prospects in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for potential applications in a variety of energy devices.Huimin XuHuimin Xu is now pursuing her M.S. degree at Nanchang Hangkong University.

1. Introduction
Owing to the overexploitation of fossil fuels, the energy crisis has become one of the most critical threats to human development, thus it is extremely pressing for us to develop environment-friendly and renewable energy. The energy conversion between electricity and chemical energy represents a promising pathway for harvesting gradually increased eco-friendly and renewable energy. For instance, renewable energy from solar or wind is plentiful but is intermittent and unpredictable. Fortunately, the generated electrical energy can be potentially stored as chemical energy through an electrolysis strategy, and the energy stored in the chemical bond can be then released in an environmentally friendly manner through a fuel cell or battery device. On the other hand, electrocatalysts play a vital role in energy conversion systems implementing mutual conversion between electricity and chemical energy. One of the most critical tasks to implement these kinds of conversion is to develop high-activity and durable electrocatalysts to facilitate reactions at the anode and cathode in the related energy conversion devices. Particularly, when a bifunctional electrocatalyst is applied as both the anode and cathode in a single electrochemical device, the related energy consumption and cost can be expected to be lowered correspondingly. In this regard, exploring high-activity and cost-effective electrocatalysts is imperatively desirable.
Over the past few years, quite a few outstanding reviews have already reported the development of non-noble metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts in overall water splitting1–3 and reversible oxygen electrodes,4,5 and they presented some recent methods for preparation with the direction of tuning the performance of electrocatalysts. However, most of the reviews only include one pair of bifunctional electrochemical systems, and reviews that report several couples of bifunctional electrochemical reactions systematically are still scarce. This review however emphasizes the overview of the recent development of bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts for electrochemical conversion systems, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in overall water splitting, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal–air batteries, and small molecule (such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, urea, and hydrazine) oxidation reactions (MOR) coupled with the HER in the new electrolysis cell. For instance, the HER and OER are the two half reactions involved in a water splitting system. A conventional integrated water splitting device which uses two different kinds of catalysts at the two electrodes can be fabricated since the two catalysts typically require different working conditions or environments. As for a two-electrode electrolyzer system which utilizes bifunctional electrocatalysts as both the anode and cathode, the complexity of the electrolytic cell can be expected to be greatly reduced.6 For example, it does not require using proton exchange membranes or bipolar membranes because the two electrodes can be assembled in an identical electrolyte. Meanwhile, the cost of manufacturing catalysts will be relatively decreased. On the other hand, given that the currently developed earth-abundant HER and OER catalysts have not reached an equivalent level to Pt-, Ir- or Ru-based catalysts, the bifunctional strategies summarized here may provide a valuable reference for catalyst design and optimization, which may lead to a future breakthrough in catalyst development, not only for water splitting but also for other important electrochemical reactions. Subsequently, we introduce the design and synthesis of bifunctional MOR/HER and ORR/OER electrocatalysts; the former reaction can be an ideal substitute of the sluggish OER producing value-added products. The latter one is an important part of the promising metal–air battery for the development of next-generation power for electric cars and electronic devices,7 in which the catalysis toward both the ORR and OER play a critical role in the performance of the associated devices, including the current density, potential gap, charge–discharge rate, energy efficiency, and cycling life. All the bifunctional electrocatalysts mentioned above are based on earth-abundant resources like Fe, Ni, Co, S, C, N and so on, which include metal oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, nitrides, carbides, and so on. They indicate a promising direction to the energy conversion for the production of clean energy. Finally, a conclusion and perspective remark are given for the future development of highly efficient bifunctional/multifunctional electrocatalysts.
2. Electrochemical water splitting
Hydrogen is considered as a promising alternative to fossil fuels owing to its abundance and easy availability.8 Electrochemically splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is an ideal and promising way to produce hydrogen gas in a sustainable manner.9 Jan and Troostwijk developed an electrostatic machine to generate electricity for the first time, which was discharged on a gold electrode in a Leyden jar with water in 1789.10 Thereafter, a voltaic pile was invented in the 1800s,11 and a few weeks later after this invention William and Anthony used it for the electrolysis of water,12 which made electrolysis of water well known. Electrochemical water splitting includes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has come to light that platinum (Pt)-based catalysts are the most active catalysts for the HER,13 and ruthenium (Ru) or iridium (Ir) and their oxides are effective catalysts for the OER.14,15 However, the limited availability and high cost of these precious metals greatly hinder their large-scale production. Thus, it is extremely urgent to design and develop non-noble metal catalysts with low cost and superior performance towards electrochemical water splitting. Water electrolysis is a representative conversion of electricity to chemical energy, which is an environmentally benign technology and has been studied extensively.
2.1 Water electrolysis mechanism
Electrocatalytic water splitting consists of two half-reactions, namely the HER at the cathode and OER at the anode, as described in the following equations:
In acidic electrolyte Cathode: 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2, φθ = 0 V(R1) Anode: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−, φθ = 1.23 V(R2)
In alkaline electrolyte Cathode: 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−, φθ = −0.828 V(R3) Anode: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−, φθ = 0.402 V(R4)
The overall reaction is 2H2O → O2 +2H2, Eθ = 1.23 V(R5)
Under standard conditions (25 °C, 1 atm), the thermodynamic voltage for water splitting is 1.23 V. However, in practice, the cell voltage for water splitting is far higher than the theoretical value of 1.23 V owing to the overpotential (η), which is caused by the kinetic barriers occurring at the cathode (ηc) and anode (ηa), as well as the resistance from solution and contact (ηother). The ηa and ηc can be minimized by decorating electrodes with highly active electrocatalysts for the OER and HER, while optimizing the electrolytic device configuration can lower ηother. In addition, it is vital to develop highly efficient precious metal alternative earth-abundant catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting to lower its cost.

2.1.1 HER mechanism. 
Having been explored extensively, HER is normally divided into three steps in acidic medium and alkaline medium, respectively:16
Volmer reaction. 

 
H3O+ + e− → Hads + H2O, Volmer reaction (acidic)
(R6)
 
H2O + e− → Hads + OH−, Volmer reaction (alkaline)
(R7)
              In this step, the electrons transfer onto the surface of the catalyst and combine with the protons absorbed on the catalyst's vacancy active sites, leading to the formation of absorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads, “ads” represents the absorption on the catalyst surface).
Heyrovsky reaction. 
The second electron coupled with another proton transfer to the absorbed hydrogen atom region, and then combines with the adsorbed hydrogen atoms to generate hydrogen. Hads + H3O+ + e− → H2 + H2O, Heyrovsky reaction (acidic)(R8) Hads + H2O + e− → H2 + OH−, Heyrovsky reaction (alkaline)(R9)
Tafel reaction. 
Another possible process is the as-called Tafel reaction (R10) in which two absorbed hydrogen atoms combine on the catalyst's surface and immediately produce hydrogen. Hads + Hads → H2, Tafel reaction (acidic and alkaline)(R10)
It is crucial to figure out the rate-determining step in the HER, which is generally defined as the elementary reaction step with the highest kinetic activation barrier.17,18 Given that the Volmer reaction is the rate-determining step, the electrode material with more cavities and edges on its surface will benefit the adsorption of hydrogen for facilitating electron transfer. However if the Heyrovsky reaction or the Tafel reaction is the rate determining step, the rate of electrolysis can be improved by increasing the reaction area, which can be achieved by electrode perforation to enhance the surface roughness.16 No matter how the HER takes place, the absorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) always participate in the reaction. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst is an important parameter to describe the catalysts for the HER, which determines the catalysts' intrinsic activity.19–21 A plot of exchange current densities against ΔGH has a volcano shape, as shown in Fig. 1.22 Because of the chemical adsorption and desorption of H atoms on an electrode surface are competitive processes, a good HER catalyst should not only form a sufficiently strong bond with adsorbed H atoms for facilitating the proton-electron-transfer process, but also should be weak enough to assure facile bond breaking and the release of the gaseous H2 product.23 Thus, the optimal catalysts lie at the summit of the volcano, such as Pt group metals, whose ΔGH value is close to zero.

2.1.2 OER mechanism. 
Under the standard conditions, the thermodynamic potential of the OER is 1.23 V, while additional overpotential is inevitable in practical operation. It is found that besides IrO2, the elementary steps of the OER occurring over all catalysts usually involve the absorption of OH and O species on the catalyst's surface.24,25 The process is similar to the HER and generally takes place in alkaline solutions: OH− + * → OHads + e−;(R11) OHads + OH− → H2O + Oads + e−(R12)where * represents the hydroxyl ion adsorption site of the catalyst surface, and there exist two possible reaction paths to produce O2 (ref. 26) as follows:
One step generation Oads + Oads → O2(R13)where two Oads intermediates couple directly to form O2.
Indirect generation Oads + OH−→ OOHads + e−;(R14) OOHads + OH− → O2 +H2O + e−(R15)
The Oads reacts first with OH− to generate OOHads and subsequently couples with OH− to produce O2. The one-step reaction often requires a higher thermodynamic barrier than the indirect reaction.
Although tremendous efforts have been directed to understand the OER process,27 the mechanism of the OER has remained unclear so far. Trasatti28 put forward the mechanism of oxide electrodes of RuO2, IrO2, MnO2, and Co3O4 in the early 1980s. He proposed that the enthalpy of the reaction MOx + O → MOx+1 was correlated with the OER activity that gave rise to a “volcano plot” and drew a conclusion that the M–O bond strength seems to correlate well with catalytic activity for different catalysts; besides, only catalysts with moderate enthalpy for OER are conducive to the electrocatalysis reaction. J. Rossmeisl et al.24 applied density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the most stable (110) faces of three rutile-type oxides (IrO2, RuO2, and TiO2) and further proved the volcano-type relationships.


2.1.3 Evaluation of bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. 
An excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting should possess overpotentials as low as possible towards both the HER and OER. Evaluation of overpotentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 is a common electrochemical measurement to estimate the efficiency of water splitting electrocatalysts, a lower overpotential means the better performance of the electrocatalyst, which can be obtained according to the following equation: η = a + blog(j).(1)where η is the overpotential, j is the exchange current density that illustrates the tentative rate of electron transfer at the electrode interface, and b represents the Tafel slope which is related to the electrode reaction mechanism. An ideal bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting requires a high j value and small b value.29 a is the Tafel constant that is dependent on several factors, such as the properties of the electrode material, the roughness of the electrode, the consistency of electrolyte, temperature, etc., which can be applied to estimate the feasibility during the electron transfer procedure in various electrode systems.
Besides the fundamental parameters related to the development of bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts, it is also necessary to explore earth-abundant and inexpensive electrocatalysts, and the preparation procedures need to be simply equipped and provident. Furthermore, a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst ought to be highly conductive, stable and durable in a wide pH range, and possess a low overpotential with high current density. In some cases, the cost of manufacturing electrocatalysts may surpass the use value. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to fabricate low-cost nonprecious metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts for the development of energy conversion systems.

2.2 Bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (HER & OER)
Non-noble transition metal-based materials have attracted great attention as valid electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. The representatives, such as Fe, Co, and Ni, have been intensively investigated as bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalysts, owing to their merits of natural abundance, low cost, favorable electroconductivity, and satisfactory electrochemical activity. Moreover, though most of them perform inferior to the state-of-art noble metal electrocatalysts, some even surpass. Herein, the synthesis and electrochemical performance of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be expatiated in the following sections.

2.2.1 Graphene-based electrocatalysts. 
Graphene has attracted enormous interest in electrochemical water splitting due to its high surface area, high conductivity, and robust stability.30 Graphene with different structures and dimensions can exhibit different properties.31–33 For example, 0D graphene oxide quantum dots can be doped with nitrogen to fabricate a photocatalyst with both p- and n-type conduction which can drive overall water splitting under visible light illumination.34 Based on the electronegativity theory, heteroatom doped graphene has been proved to be more efficient for anchoring metal atoms. Some outstanding studies had been reported by Francesco and Maher et al.32,35 They've summarized in detail that graphene is an ideal material for energy storage in batteries, supercapacitors and so on. Herein, we collected non-noble metal-based material coupled graphene for efficient overwater electrolysis and made a brief description about the function of graphene in electrochemical reactions. For example, Yue and co-workers reported a chemical-etching method to synthesize nitrogen and fluorine dual doped porous graphene-like nanosheets (NFPGNS) as bifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline medium.36 By utilizing NFPGNS as both the anode and cathode electrocatalyst, the electrolyzer presented decent performance with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.90 V. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the NFPGNS can be attributed to the doped heteroatoms which changed the electronegativity of adjacent C atoms, leading to stronger adsorption strength and consequently lowering the absolute value of ΔG (Gibbs free energy). This work provides a viable avenue to explore metal-free catalysts for overall water splitting.
Non-noble metal-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to their low cost, abundance, and high activities for water splitting, and graphene was generally employed as a support to enhance the conductivity, reinforce the stability and durability of this kind of catalyst. For example, Wang et al. prepared trifunctional graphene composites with cobalt sulfide electrocatalysts for oxygen reversible catalysis and hydrogen production by simple thermal annealing of graphene oxides with cobalt nitrate and thiourea in an ammonium atmosphere37 (Fig. 2a). The nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene loaded Co9S8 (NS/rGO-Co) was confirmed to contribute to the trifunctional activity. As the catalytic activity is related to the available amount and number of active sites, while the cobalt salt inserted in the graphene sheets increased the exposure of active sites on Co9S8 it lowered the number of active sites on graphene. Therefore, regulating an appropriate proportion of the cobalt salt was extremely vital to optimize catalytic activity. Among the set of catalysts, the NS/rGO-Co4, due to the synergetic effect between Co9S8 and N, S doped graphene, it has benign conductivity, the sample exhibited the best performance towards the ORR, OER, and HER (Fig. 2b and c), and the overall water splitting only need an overpotential (at both the anode and cathode) of 450 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution (Fig. 2d). From the graphene-based functional materials, we can conclude that the catalytic activity can be improved by doping non-metal heteroatoms. In addition to graphene, tremendous efforts have been devoted to synthesizing earth-abundant transition metals for overall water splitting, especially the first-row transition metals like Fe, Co, and Ni. Other compounds, such as metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal sulfides and so on, have been reported to show outstanding performance surpassing some excellent rare noble metals electrocatalysts such as Pt and IrO2. In the subsequent paragraphs, some of the Fe, Co, and Ni-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting are summarized.

2.2.2 Single metal-based electrocatalysts. 
As one of the most abundant metal elements in the Earth's crust, Fe-based materials are promising for catalytic application owing to their cheapness, low toxicity, and considerable activity. Recent research has indicated that Fe-based electrocatalysts show preeminent activity toward both the OER and HER,38–41 while there are few discussions on bifunctional Fe-based electrocatalysts. Recently, Benjamin et al. synthesized three electrocatalysts only containing Fe metal with different morphologies,42 including FeOx nanorods, spherical metal Fe nanocrystals, and petal-like FeSx nanocrystals. These products showed surprising similar activity for OER catalysis, especially the overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 were all about 400 mV in 0.1 M KOH, and they have similar bias potentials of 0.36 V and 1.68 V (vs. RHE, at 10 mA cm−2) for the HER and OER, respectively. During the galvanostatic measurement, the FeOx exhibited a high stability over 3 days with only a minor potential increase (around 0.02 V) in the applied bias for overall water electrolysis.
Chakadola et al.43 reported the synthesis of a bifunctional electrocatalyst of FeSe2 by applying a “low-temperature molecular precursor” as the precursor,44 the synthesis is capable of controlling the composition and size distribution of nano-level catalysts. The obtained FeSe2 deposited on nickel foam (NF) showed high catalytic activity for both the OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte, with the overpotentials of only −262 mV for the HER and 308 mV for the OER to drive a current density of 100 mA cm−2. In addition, full water electrolysis can be launched at a very low voltage of only 1.52 V by applying the FeSe2/NF as both the anode and cathode, which achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.73 V with remarkable stability over a period of 24 h. Meanwhile, Li et al.45 synthesized FeB2 nanoparticles via converting FeCl2 to FeB2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by adding LiBH4 as a reducing agent, which is highly efficient for both the HER and OER. The as-prepared FeB2 required a low onset overpotential of 20 mV for the HER and can afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a very small overpotential of 61 mV. The catalysts also exhibited a low OER onset overpotential of nearly 250 mV (vs. RHE), such good performance is attributed to the formation of FeOOH/FeB2 heterojunctions during the reaction process. When FeB2 nanoparticles were deposited on nickel foam acting as the catalysts for the HER and OER in the overall water splitting device, an applied voltage of 1.57 V can initiate water electrolysis.
Besides Fe-based electrocatalysts, a great deal of research efforts have been made to develop and fabricate efficacious Co-based electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, such as cobalt sulfides or selenides,46–48 phosphates,49–51 and oxides.52–54 For example, Zhao and co-workers achieved meaningful seawater electrolysis by preparing bifunctional cobalt selenides consisting of CoSe and Co9Se8. By adjusting the mass ratio of Co to Se, the OER overpotential of the Co–Se1 sample and HER overpotential of the Co–Se4 sample at 100 mA cm−2 are 280 mV and −268 mV, respectively.55 When applied for overall seawater splitting, the Co–Se1‖ and the Co–Se4 catalysts required a cell voltage of 1.8 V to reach a current density of 10.3 mA cm−2. They claimed that this is promising for large-scale application of water splitting. However Liu et al. introduced an electrodeposition method56 to fabricate an amorphous CoSe film grown on a Ti mesh (α-CoSe/Ti) under strong alkaline conditions.57 Such α-CoSe/Ti electrodes displayed high activities for both the HER and OER, demanding an overpotential of −292 mV for the HER and 121 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. When used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, an electrolysis current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved at an applied voltage of 1.65 V with long-period operating stability. The results provide new insights into designing Co chalcogenide nanostructures as promising non-precious metal catalysts for electrochemical water splitting devices. CNTs have proven to be an ideal matrix with benign conductivity, stability and corrosion resistance, for example, Wang and co-workers fabricated a catalyst of cobalt disulphide encapsulated in S, N doped CNTs denoted as S, N-CNTs-CoS2@Co.58 The catalyst is prepared by first growing Co2+ ions on N-doped CNTs, followed by sulfurizing to obtain the product with a CoS2@Co core–shell structure. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, it showed satisfactory performance towards both the HER and OER, which required overpotentials of 112 mV and 340 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2. The good performance may be attributed to the semiconductor effect of the metal disulfide and the core–shell structure which leads to the electronic reorganization and hence the HER activity.
Cobalt phosphides have explored as promising electrocatalysts due to their high electrical conductivity and chemical stability, and capability for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) that proceeds in a similar mechanism to the HER, suggesting that they may have high activity for the HER as well.59 Yu's group developed a heterostructure CoP@a-CoOx plate via a facile combination of a solvothermal method and phosphorization, which required an applied voltage of 1.66 V to deliver an electrolysis current of 10 mA cm−2 and maintaining such a status for over 30 h.60 Yuan et al. synthesized a cobalt-rich phosphide directly grown on cobalt foil (Co2P/Co-foil) by one-step phosphorization of a pre-oxidized Co foil; the Co2P/Co-foil was studied as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and OER in alkaline medium,61 and showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of −157 mV for the HER and 319 mV for the OER with good stability and high activity. Moreover, an electrolyzer prototype constructed using the Co2P/Co-foil as both cathode and anode catalysts achieved considerable activity for water electrolysis in alkaline medium. The excellent HER performance of Co2P/Co-foil was attributed to the active sites on the top of P atoms in the CoP2, confirmed by DFT calculations.
Although a great amount of transition metal based electrocatalysts present outstanding activity for the HER and OER, it remains a challenge to find such catalysts for water electrolysis that can be utilized in a wide pH range rather than in strong acidic or alkaline medium. Recently, Xue et al. reported a controllable vacuum-diffusion method to prepare Janus Co/CoP nanoparticles as efficient Mott–Schottky electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, which showed favorable performance at a pH range of 0–14.62 The synthesis was implemented by first coating carbon on Co nanoparticles, followed by phosphorization with NaH2PO2 as the P source to form Janus Co/CoP nanoparticles. The CoP contents in Co/CoPx can be tuned by changing the weight ratios between NaH2PO2 and carbon coated Co nanoparticles; in this way, a set of samples, i.e., Co/CoP-x (x = 3, 5, 7), were prepared and studied as electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, manifesting excellent activity towards the HER and OER in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7). The electrolyzer required overpotentials of −138 mV and −206 mV to achieve current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mA cm−2 for the HER, respectively, while the OER potential was relatively high (2.6 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE). This work proposed an interesting conception to explore transition metal-based Mott–Schottky electrocatalysts for water splitting.
From the catalysts mentioned above, the Co-based phosphides are likely to not only have superb electrocatalytic activities towards the HER, but also could be applied as excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Though metal-rich borides used to be considered as poor stability materials in air or in the presence of moisture,63 there are still various transition metal borides that proved to be efficient catalysts for water splitting. For instance, Lu et al. reported a 3D bifunctional Co-B@CoO/Ti catalyst that presented excellent durability for both the HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte.64 The Co-B@CoO/Ti electrode obtained a current density of 50 mA cm−2 by applying a cell voltage of only 1.67 V, and the electrolyzer only showed 19% degradation in current density after a 20-hour electrolysis process. Furthermore, Qiao's group reported a hollow Co3O4 microtube arrays (Co3O4-MTA) towards full water splitting.65
Due to its hollow interior and porous shells that bring about abundant active sites and enhanced mass transport, the catalytic activities toward both the HER and OER were impressive with low overpotentials. Zhang et al. reported a feasible anion-exchange method to transfer 1D Co3O4 nanowires into CoP porous nanowires for the OER and HER,66 which can be driven by a single-cell “AA” battery with overpotentials of −147 mV and 326 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER, respectively.
Besides Fe and Co-based materials, Ni-based electrocatalysts also received considerable interest. For example, Chen and coworkers reported a simple process for modifying by acid pretreatment, followed by phosphorization and sulfuration.67 The obtained self-supported product Ni/Ni8P3 and Ni/Ni9S8, especially the former, exhibited outstanding performance as bifunctional electrodes for the OER and HER. Moreover, Wu et al. reported a facile and scalable method to prepare partially oxidized Ni particles on Ni–N co-doped carbon nanofibers.68 The mesoporous and nanofiber network structure made it a robust electrocatalyst for the HER and OER in alkaline medium, and released a current of 10 mA cm−2 at an applied voltage of 1.69 V for overall water splitting. In addition, Gao's group developed nickel/nickel (oxy)hydroxide hybrid films by a potentiostatic electrodeposition approach, and the defect-rich structure accounted to a high performance of the OER.69 Xing and co-workers reported the fabrication of a nano-porous nickel hydroxide@nickel film on carbon cloth (Ni(OH)2@Ni/CC) by a two-step electrodeposition method: (1) directly electrodepositing Ni(OH)2 on CC (1 cm × 2 cm) in 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2 at a persistent potential of −0.1 V (vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE)); (2) Ni was electrodeposited by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 20 cycles with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M NiSO4·6H2O.70 The extraordinary activity of the catalysts was also confirmed by the DFT calculation that the catalyst possesses a very low free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH = 0.147 eV).
Nickel selenides have also aroused research interest due to their novel electronic and magnetic properties.71 In recent years, their electrocatalytic properties for the HER and OER have obtained increasing attention due to the flourishing research about transition metal chalcogenide materials. Gong's group reported Ni foam supported Se-(NiCo)Sx/(OH)x that showed high activity and robust stability.72 The material was prepared by a Se-induced hydrothermal method. To minimize the influence of oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+, the potential range was swept from high to low. When applied as a HER electrode, the Se-(NiCo)Sx/(OH)x produced a cathodic current of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of −103 mV and a high stability of 80 h in 1.0 M KOH. The Se addition resulted in abundant defects and disorder, which helped to assimilate OH−/H2O and thus to improve the OER performance. Therefore, the electrolyzer built using the bifunctional electrocatalyst needed an applied cell voltage of 1.6 V to attain 10 mA cm−2. Chen et al. introduced economical NiSe–Ni0.85Se nanowires on carbon paper (NiSe–Ni0.85Se/CP) for alkaline overall water electrolysis.73 Owing to the abundant catalytic sites (Fig. 3a), the electrocatalyst showed good performance for both the OER and HER in 1 M KOH, achieving overpotentials of 300 mV and −101 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, it only required 1.62 V to obtain 10 mA cm−2 when applied in a full water splitting system (Fig. 3b and c). Swesi and co-workers prepared a textured NiSe2 by electrodeposition with high energy efficiency for overall water splitting,74 while the preferential growth direction of the NiSe2 that determines the exposure amount of catalytic sites in the electrolyte would be influenced by the surface chemistry and phase purity. The as-prepared NiSe2 presented a surprisingly high catalytic activity for the OER with an overpotential of 140 mV in alkaline medium; the authors claimed the textured NiSe2 surpasses all the other OER electrocatalysts reported previously. The catalyst was also active to the HER, and delivered a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at −170 mV. The water splitting electrolyzer equipped with NiSe2-decorated electrodes as the anode and cathode only needed 1.43 V to achieve 100 mA cm−2 with an electrolysis energy efficiency of 83%, which was one of the most high-performing electrolyzers among the existing ones.

Meanwhile, Wang's group fabricated fullerene-like nickel oxysulfide hollow nanospheres (FNHNs) via a simple solvothermal method.75 The electrocatalytic activities enhanced dramatically by in situ growth on the nickel foam (denoted as FNHNs/NF), requiring a voltage of 1.55 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in a two-electrode cell configuration.
In short, the transition metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) based bifunctional electrocatalysts showed similarities in high activities for the HER and OER, pointing out an unambiguous direction on modifying the morphology and the structure of the electrocatalysts to enhance the number of active sites for further enhancing the activity and properties of water electrolysis catalysts.


2.2.3 Multicomponent metal electrocatalysts and other emerging electrocatalysts. 
Though many unary metal electrocatalysts exhibit attractive electrochemical performance, it seems that adding second metal elements may further help to improve the activity of water splitting. For example, researchers found that Fe3+ could replace Ni2+ in the Ni(OH)2 lattice with formation of a stable layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure, which could enhance the electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation reaction76–78 Meanwhile, combining the features of HER favorable and OER supporting materials may contribute to a synergistic effect that can simultaneously promote the performance during the OER and HER.79,80 Transition metal elements, such as Ni, Fe, Co, Mo, etc. are especially widely investigated as outstanding electrocatalysts.81–88
Recently, Wu et al. reported the synthesis of MoS2/Fe5Ni4S8/FeNi foam by coupling MoS2 on an FeNi substrate with vulcanization, which was reported to be conducive to the absorption of H atoms and OH groups, and thus exhibited comparable performance to Pt for water splitting.89 In addition, Duraisamy et al. proposed NH2-MIL-88B (Fe2Ni) MOFs as an excellent bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis, which overcame the defects of MOFs (low electrical conductivity and stability) and showed overpotentials of 240 mV and −87 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER, respectively.90 Liang et al. designed 2D layered CoNiPS3 nanosheets incorporated with N-doped carbon (CoNiPS3/C) for robust electrochemical water splitting. This single-phase electrocatalyst had lower energy barriers, abundant exposed edges, and faster electron and mass transfer, which accounted to the excellent performance of CoNiPS3/C.91 Peng et al. developed a novel “adsorption calcination reduction” method that introduced oxygen vacancies and synthesized multi-shelled hollow structured NiCo2O4 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER.92 Recently, Yu's group fabricated Ni0.1Co0.9P as a Janus electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral-pH medium.93 Huang and co-workers introduced Fe in morphology controlled Ni2P (Fig. 4a) on a conductive 2D carbon fiber (CF) substrate (Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF), which possessed more accessible active sites and open structures that could accelerate both the HER and OER.94 The 3D Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF electrode showed the best activity among various samples with different Fe/Ni atomic ratios, because the proper impaction of Fe in Ni2P decreased the grain size, leading to a more regular structure and the formation of electronic states, thus improving the electrochemical catalytic activity. The supposition was further proved by a controllable synthetic experiment. The flat sheet structured Ni2P, sphere-shaped structured Fe2P with different sizes, and the as-prepared partial sphere-shaped structure constituted by nanosheets were synthesized. The doped Fe decreased the grain size, and the as-made Ni1.33Fe0.67P, Ni1.5Fe0.5P, and Ni1.67Fe0.33P samples all showed a sphere-shaped structure comprising honeycomb and rough texture sheets radially growing from the centre. Owing to this nanosheet-containing sphere structure, the catalytic activity of Ni2P was improved significantly for more active site exposure and faster mass transfer, and the activities varied for different ratios of NixFe2−xP. Among the as-prepared electrocatalysts, the Ni1.5Fe0.5P exhibited the best OER performance with an overpotential as low as 264 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b). Besides, the Ni1.5Fe0.5P also showed preeminent activity towards the HER, attaining a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of −282 mV (Fig. 4c). Hence, the Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF had good performance as both the anode and cathode catalysts for overall water splitting (Fig. 4d). Likewise, Liu's group put forward a self-supported laminar catalyst NiCo2Px/CNTs anchoring Ni2+ and Co2+ ions on CNTs by simply annealing and phosphorization treatment.95 The CNTs were first pretreated in order to grow oxygen functional groups, so that they can attract the Ni2+ and Co2+ ions to be anchored. In 1 M KOH, the NiCo2Px/CNTs presented extremely high activity towards both the HER and OER. It was explained that CNTs contribute to the promotion of conductivity and prevent the metal nanoparticles from collapse and aggregation, which significantly enriches the specific area and effective oxygen release. Through rationally designing the structure and components to develop new electrocatalysts prior to the synthesis is a smart strategy for the sake of improving the activity and durability. Kim's group demonstrated a precisely designed synthesis of a 3D doughnut-like quaternary Co–Ni–S–P compound coupled with a graphene electrocatalyst,96 which was prepared by a facile wet chemical method to gain the precursor (Fig. 5a) with further vulcanization and phosphidation (Fig. 5b–e). Due to the elaborate preparation, the product presented outstanding performance for overall water splitting. By the way, the authors also mentioned that introducing of bifunctional electrocatalysts into an integrated electrolyzer rather than coupling different kinds of electrocatalysts has the advantages of being more convenient and cost-effective.

Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have attracted great attention due to their outstanding mechanical strength and hardness, high melting point and chemical stabilities, and good corrosion resistance. The special simple metallic structures with small carbon atoms inserted in the interstitial voids of the densely packed host lattice are competent to apply in electrochemical reactions. For example, Ouyang et al. prepared a hybrid of Co and β-MoC2 encapsulated in N-CNTs (denoted as Co/β-MoC2@N-CNTs), which was demonstrated to be a great success as both the OER and HER electrocatalyst obtaining overpotentials of 170 mV and 246 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively.97 It was explained that the cooperation among Co, β-MoC2 and N-CNTs resulted in the excellent electrochemical performance and stability owing to the fact that N-CNTs protected the metal nanoparticles from corrosion and provided rapid electron transfer. Recently, Fan and co-workers reported a two dimensional (2D) bifunctional electrocatalyst by introducing 2 at% Fe-doped Ni3C nanodots into N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe–Ni3C-2%) through a facile co-precipitation method.98 When applied for the HER, the Fe–Ni3C-2% only demanded an overpotential of −178 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, far lower than that of Ni3C (−235 mV). When applied for the OER in 1.0 M KOH, the Fe–Ni3C-2% exhibited a good catalytic activity with an onset potential of 1.43 V (vs. RHE), driving a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a small overpotential of only 275 mV. They supposed that the appropriate doping of Fe might generate new active sites and nickel vacancies, thus enhancing the electronic properties and surface composition of Ni3C. Similarly, Wang et al. proposed the incorporation of highly crystalline Mo2C nanoparticles on carbon sheets (Mo2C@CS) for overall water electrolysis.99 To optimize the morphology and catalytic performance of the products, the precursor (ammonium molybdate and glucose) ratio was tuned. The products obtained with the mass ratio of ammonium molybdate and glucose of 1:2 showed the best catalytic activities for the HER and OER, and had small Tafel slopes and low overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 (−60 mV for the HER and 380 mV for the OER), long-term stability, and large electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC). Furthermore, the unique lamellar structure with more exposed active sites on carbon sheets also contributed to the excellent activity.
The overall water splitting activity of the transition metal nitride-based materials have also been explored. For instance, Yin et al. reported the fabrication of Ni–Mo nitride (NiMoN-550) nanotubes with a diameter of around 300 nm by a two-step method with a hydrothermal method and further annealing in an NH3 atmosphere, which was demonstrated as a highly active electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.100 The MoN2 in NiMo-550 played a vital role in facilitating the charge transfer and H2O adsorption, thus further enhanced HER activity. Shu's group developed a fabulous porous WO2 supported on nickel foam with a hexahedral network structure (WO2 HN/NF),101 which showed a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at −48 mV for the HER and an overpotential of 300 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. The catalyst was prepared by a conventional hydrothermal method followed by annealing in a H2 atmosphere. The authors studied the growth mechanism by observing the morphology after hydrothermal treatments for different reaction times (i.e., 2 h, 12 h, and 24 h) (Fig. 6a–c). With increasing reaction time, the hexahedra were getting bigger and the edges were becoming smoother (Fig. 6d). The annealing treatment did not destroy the hexahedron morphology but roughed the surface and got a porous structure. To exclude the influence of the substrate, the electrochemical activities of Ni foam were also tested. Surprisingly, the porous WO2 HN/NF exhibited superb performance with an overpotential of only around −48 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the HER with remarkable stability and durability. Besides, the OER performance was determined in 1.0 M N2-saturated KOH solution at room temperature, and the WO2 HN/NF required overpotentials of 300 and 330 mV to attain a current density of 10 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. The electrolyzer device with the WO2 HN/NF as the anode and cathode could deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an applied voltage of 1.59 V and had long term stability (Fig. 6e–g). The fabulous catalytic activities can be ascribed to the porous structure that can facilitate gas diffusion and decrease ion transport resistance. Besides, Li and co-workers introduced a novel spray-pyrolysis method to prepare yolk–shell Ni3Fe/Ni3FeN as an efficient electrocatalyst for full water splitting.102 Moreover, the catalyst was also applied as the cathode of Zn–air battery, and the experimental results not only indicated a promising direction for the development of functional electrocatalysts for water electrolysis, but also presented the possibility for their commercial applications. For practical application, it would be better if the bifunctional electrocatalysts could be adapted to media with a universal pH range. Herein, Liu's group coupled three components of Ni3N, CoN and NiCo2O4 onto graphite fibers (denoted NiCo-nitrides/NiCo2O4/GF), which is able to work in a broad pH.103 The obtained fiber supported catalyst could directly work as electrodes for the HER and OER with satisfactory properties possessing overpotentials of 71 mV and 183 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, and corresponding Tafel slopes of 62 mV dec−1 and 56 mV dec−1, respectively. The NiCo-nitrides/NiCo2O4/GF also showed favorable performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), which indicated a promising direction for the exploration of the mechanism of the HER and OER in acidic and neutral solutions.

Cu-based materials have been widely investigated as excellent catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction; moreover, they are earth abundant and efficient.104 In recent years, Cu-doped electrocatalysts also have emerged as catalysts for water splitting. For instance, Chen's group developed a catalyst of Cu sulfide on Cu foam (denoted Cu2S@Cu) as both the anode and cathode for water splitting.105 It exhibited considerable excellent ability for the OER with a low overpotential of 345 mV at 20 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope for the HER of 76 mV dec−1. Even though the earlier progress was not very prosperous as many Cu-based electrocatalysts required high overpotentials of 345–780 mV at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 for the OER,106–109 the latest pioneering studies did demonstrate that Cu could be a promising dopant for water electrolysis. Ren et al. reported a 3D NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NiFe LDH NSs) grown on Cu nanowire cores of Cu foams (3D core–shell Cu NWs@NiFe LDH), presenting exceptional activities for the OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte. After electrodeposition treatment, the NiFe LDH nanosheets were coated uniformly and vertically on the surface of Cu foams, forming a highly porous surface morphology. It was an exceptional active electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline electrolyte.110 Such bifunctional electrocatalysts achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 1.54 V for water splitting, far lower than that of the IrO2 (anode)‖Pt (cathode) two electrode system (1.63 V), and exhibited a prominent stability at 10 mA cm−2 sustaining 48 h. The prominent performance was thought to derive from the special core–shell structure of the catalyst which provided many exposed edges and thus more exposed active sites and good electron transport. We here have introduced various Ni, Co, and Fe based materials that have been widely studied in electrochemical water splitting; as can be seen, these bifunctional electrocatalysts have demonstrated excellent performances and their properties might be dependent on the morphology and the amount of the active sites. In order to make it more clear, Table 1 shows a brief comparison of bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts' performance.

3. Bifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER and small organic molecule oxidation reactions (HER & MOR)
In addition to the need for outstanding electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution remains the main bottleneck in hindering the development of hydrogen production, and the OER product of O2 is not of significant value. Furthermore, the possible formation of an explosive H2/O2 mixture and reactive oxygen species (ROS) degrading PEM impedes the development of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Therefore, finding an effective strategy to replace the OER by a more thermodynamically favorable reaction at the anode is a promising concept to develop renewable energy, which not merely achieves an energy-saving hydrogen production, but also may obtain value-added products and/or alleviated wastewater pollution. In the following contents, we will introduce the significant small molecule oxidation reaction (MOR) and summarize the development of bifunctional electrochemical catalysts for the HER and MOR.13
Recently, Sun's group proposed a general concept of integrating oxidative biomass upgrading reactions with decoupled H2 production from water splitting by using a non-noble bifunctional catalyst, in which the biomass possesses a relatively lower oxidation potential than the OER and its oxidized products were nongaseous and more valuable.111–114 Among the biomass intermediates, the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was a representative one regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals for the production of fine chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, and liquid fuels.115 And one of its oxidized products, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is more valuable and considered as a promising material for its wide application in many areas, particularly in the synthesis of useful polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, and polyurethanes.116
In one of the research studies, the NixB with high surface area showed high selectivity for FDCA production with a large faradaic efficiency of 98.5%,117 and the reaction pathway was investigated by operando electrochemistry-coupled attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (EC-ATR-IR), and they confirmed that the oxidation order was HMF < 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furan-carboxylic acid (HMFCA) < 2-formyl-5-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) < FDCA. Moreover, the electrocatalyst could reach a current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a low potential of 1.45 V (vs. RHE). In another study, 3D Ni2P nanoparticle arrays grown on nickel foam (Ni2P NPA/NF) presented a much higher activity for selectively oxidizing HMF to FDCA than the OER (Fig. 7a), which showed an onset potential of 1.35 V and a rapid increase of current density within 1.40 V for HMF oxidation, in contrast to the OER onset potential of 1.50 V.114 Owing to the two possible reaction paths of the HMF oxidation to FDCA (Fig. 7b), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) suggested the catalytic reaction tended to proceed following the HMFCA route, and that the HMF is firstly oxidized to the intermediate 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HFCA) and then converts into 5-formylfuran-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) prior to FDCA. When catalyzed by Ni2P NPA/NF, the selectivity of HMF oxidation to FDCA could reach a faradaic efficiency of 98%. In addition, in order to eliminate the influence for the HER from the possible migration of HMF from the anode to the cathode, the HER performance of Ni2P NPA/NF in the presence of HMF was also examined. It was revealed that the HMF had little influence on HER activity. When the Ni2P NPA/NF was employed as both the anode and cathode in 1.0 M KOH with 10 mM HMF to obtain co-instantaneous hydrogen and FDCA production, the electrolyzer only required a cell voltage of 1.44 V for generating a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7c), suggesting its extraordinary activity towards the HER and HMF oxidation. This research introduced a new-fangled conception of utilizing more flexible thermodynamic and kinetic oxidation of HMF to replace the sluggish OER, by which this reaction not only required lower overpotential, but also the oxidation product of FDCA was more valuable than primitive HMF or O2. Thus, this strategy is very promising and practical for future energy conversion technology. Its stimulated studies used many other hydrocarbon oxidation reactions to merge with the HER in multifarious energy-related devices. As far as we are concerned, HMF is not very stable under ambient conditions, so we recommend the preparation and conservation of HMF-containing solution should be at low temperature such as utilizing ice bags and refrigerators, and it is better to use the solution immediately after it was prepared.

In addition, urea is abundantly distributed in industrial and human wastewater from urea synthesis, which brings health problems to humans because of its naturally decomposed product (e.g., nitrate and toxic ammonia), polluting groundwater and atmosphere. Moreover, the products of electrochemical oxidation of urea in alkaline aqueous solution in harmless N2 and CO2, which could be captured by alkaline medium with formation of carbonate. Therefore, electrochemical UOR can achieve the best effect in two aspects, namely, fixing environmental pollution and enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen production. Zhu and co-workers synthesized a bimetallic Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam for overall urea electrolysis by a wet-chemistry topotactic conversion.118 The electrolyzer with bimetallic Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam not only required a low cell voltage for overall water electrolysis (1.6 V@10 mA cm−2), but also needed a voltage of only 1.46 V to realize full urea electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the same group also developed a catalyst electrode with NiCo2S4 nanowires growing on carbon cloth for simultaneously electrolyzing water and urea in alkaline electrolyte.119 Besides, Li et al. reported heteroporous MoS2/Ni3S2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for full urea splitting, which required a low voltage of 1.45 V for 20 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH containing 0.33 M urea.86 Our group recently reported a pH gradient concentration electrolyzer by using CuCl/rGO nanohybrids for alkaline UOR and acidic HER.120 The optimal combination is 2 M KOH at the anode and 0.5 M H2SO4 at the cathode, which required only 0.83 V for 10 mA cm−2 to fulfill the overall urea splitting. Sun et al. have investigated alternative oxidation reactions to the oxygen evolution reaction towards energy-efficient hydrogen production.121,122 They investigated the performance of nickel phosphide nanoflake arrays on carbon cloth (Ni2P NF/CC) as a bifunctional catalyst for urea oxidation and the HER in alkaline medium containing urea.122 The Ni2P NF/CC prepared via a low temperature phosphorylation treatment of NiO NF/CC showed high activity for the HER, which just required a cell voltage of 1.39 V to obtain a current density of 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH.123 The Ni2P NF/CC also showed an excellent performance for urea oxidation, which only demanded a potential of 0.388 V (vs. SCE) to obtain a current density of 60 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. The overall reaction of the UOR and HER was tested on a two-electrode electrolyzer constructed by using Ni2P NF/CC as both the anode and cathode, and a cell voltage of 1.35 V was required to attain 50 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea.
Meanwhile, there are other promising candidate reactions to replace the OER. Compared to the OER, the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) requires a much lower theoretical decomposition voltage of −0.33 V, the oxidation product is non-poisonous, and it can be applied in a fuel cell with high energy density.124–127 In one research, Zhang's team developed tubular CoSe2 nanosheets for substituting the HzOR, which showed a low overpotential of −84 mV for the HER to reach 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH and −17 mV for the HzOR in 0.5 M hydrazine electrolyte.128 You et al. designed Ni2P nanoarrays grown in situ on nickel foam (Ni2P/NF) as a high-performance non-noble metal electrocatalyst for the HzOR and HER in alkaline electrolytes. The Ni2P/NF exhibited excellent activity as a catalyst at both the anode and cathode, which achieved a current density of 500 mA cm−2 at an applied cell voltage of 1.0 V, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER was nearly 100%. Except for the Ni2P/NF, the CoS2 nanoarray on a Ti mesh (CoS2/TiM) as a bifunctional catalyst for both the HER and HzOR also showed high activity, which only required a low cell voltage of 0.81 V to drive both the HER and HzOR in a two-electrode cell at 100 mA cm−2.129 A similar study has been done to investigate aloe extract oxidation reaction (AOR) for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation using an Fe-doped CoP nanosheet array on carbon cloth (Fe-CoP/CC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the AOR and HER.130 In 1.0 M KOH containing aloe, the Fe-CoP/CC two-electrode system could be operated continuously at a voltage of 1.51 V to drive 20 mA cm−2 (vs. RHE) with 100% faradaic efficiency for the HER. The oxidation of HMF, urea, and hydrazine not only has lower decomposition potentials than 1.23 V but also can convert into more valuable or harmless oxidation products. For example, HMF can convert into FDCA, urea can convert into harmless N2 and CO2, and hydrazine has a much lower oxidation potential of −0.33 V which can greatly reduce the external voltage. However under the actual operation conditions, we need to realize that HMF is poisonous and has strong reducibility, which means it isn't very stable at normal temperature and pressure, and we should preserve it well. On the other hand, though the oxidation product FDCA of HMF is of high-value, the HMF itself is relatively expensive compared with other raw materials.
4. Reversible electrical–chemical energy conversion systems
Additionally, the use of metal–air batteries has been regarded as a promising energy technique for diverse electronic devices to satisfy their energy requirements, which typically consists of pure metal as the anode, an ambient air cathode, and either aqueous or organic electrolyte. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER are vital parts of metal–air batteries. During the discharge process, the metal anode is oxidized and delivers electrons to the cathode to reduce the oxygen at the same time. While the charging process is opposite, the air electrode acts as the anode and oxygen generates on the electrode surface.131,132 The overall oxygen electrode activity was examined by a vital parameter ΔE (ΔE = Ej=10 − E1/2, where ΔE is the potential difference, representing the oxygen redox catalytic index of the catalyst, Ej=10 is the OER operating potential at 10 mA cm−2, E1/2 is the half-wave potential in the ORR). The smaller the potential difference is, the more suitable the material is for practical application. The ORR activities were measured using a potential corresponding to half of the limiting current density, while OER activities were evaluated using the potential required at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.133 Metal–air batteries have the advantages of high energy density, low price, and environment-friendly operating conditions. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics, high overpotential, and poor reversibility in electrochemical reaction of oxygen are still huge obstacles for the development of rechargeable metal–air batteries, which requires manufacture of efficient and high durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Even though Pt-based and Ru-based materials have the optimal activities towards the ORR and OER, the major shortcomings are their rarity and extremely high price. It is consequently highly desirable to design bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts from earth-abundant non-precious metals.
4.1 Bifunctional oxygen electrodes (OER & ORR)
Some excellent reviews reported previously focused on bifunctional oxygen electrodes like transition metal oxides or perovskite oxides.134,135 This review included not only metal oxides, but metal carbides, selenide, sulfide, etc. We provide a shallow description about the fundamental of the OER and ORR; moreover, the application of bifunctional oxygen electrodes to metal–air batteries has also been mentioned. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as the preferred reaction on the cathode in all types of full cells (FC) and metal–air batteries, which are environment-friendly and high-efficiency devices directly converting chemical energy into electricity.136–138 Until now, varieties of transition metal based materials have been reported as ORR electrocatalysts.139–146 However, the ORR has sluggish kinetics at the cathode, which is considered as a long-term impediment to the development of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)147,148 and metal–air batteries.149,150 Pt-based compounds are the state-of-the-art for the ORR in FC, while they suffer from disadvantages of scarcity, high cost, and poor durability. Consequently, much effort needs to be devoted to the exploitation of non-noble materials to realize high-efficiency energy conversion and storage devices.
The ORR on oxide electrodes can be conducted in the following two possible parallel reactions:131,151,152
(1) Direct four electron reaction: O2 (ads) + 2H2O +4e− ↔ 4OH−(R16)
(2) Indirect (peroxide) pathway: O2 (ads) + H2O +2e− ↔ OH− + HO2−(R17)which followed by the further reduction of peroxide ions: HO2− + H2O + 2e− ↔ 3OH−(R18)
Or the catalytic decomposition of peroxide: HO2− (ads) → 1/2O2 + OH−(R19)
The ORR pathways and the mechanism are dependent on the catalysts utilized, and even can vary from the same catalyst because the ORR is a structure-sensitive reaction. These two pathways are also competitive reactions and may arise simultaneously. In fact, the ORR is supposed to undergo the four electron reaction to fulfill an efficient reduction of oxygen. The mechanism of the OER has been mentioned in the previous section.

4.1.1 Cobalt-based electrocatalysts. 
Co-based heterogeneous electrocatalysts not only presented a favorable performance for water electrolysis but also can be utilized as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen electrodes.153–156 Sun and co-workers recently reported spontaneously assembled sandwich-like rGO/carbon black/cobalt borate nanocomposites as active bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the ORR and OER. The combination of rGO and carbon black improved the conductivity and obtained a high surface area nanostructure with hierarchically porous channels. The catalyst enabled a rechargeable Zn–air battery with a voltage gap of 0.86 V at 10 mA cm−2.157 Zhang et al. reported N doped C flake arrays based on carbon cloth which combined with mesoporous hierarchical P-doped CoSe2 (P-CoSe2/N-C Fas) as advanced oxygen electrodes for Zn–air batteries.158 DFT calculations identified that the increase of the local density of electron states and decrease of free energy of the potential-limiting step for both the OER and ORR can be attributed to P-doping. Furthermore, P-CoSe2/N-C Fas can be applied as the cathode of Zn–air batteries with an open circuit voltage of around 1.3 V. Recently, Qiu et al. reported a bifunctional electrocatalyst of double-shelled hybrid nanocages (DSNCs) for the OER and ORR. The DSNCs were derived from core–shell zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), in which the outer shell of Co-decorated N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (Co-NGC) was derived from ZIF-67 while the inner shell of N-doped microporous carbon (NC) was derived from ZIF-8, and the resulting sample was termed NC@Co-NGC DSNCs.159 The ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 core–shell structures possess a hierarchically micro/mesoporous structure and a high surface area, accounting for the good conductivity and facile diffusion kinetics.160,161 The ΔE of the NC@Co-NGC DSNCs was 0.82 V, which is better than that of the excellent Pt/C (0.94 V), RuO2 (1.0 V), and Co-NGC (0.95 V). This outstanding performance was derived largely from the Co-NGC shell in the NC@Co-NGC DSNCs and the hollow nanostructure enhanced the reaction kinetics. Amiinu also prepared a kind of Co-Nx/C nanorod array which derived from 3D ZIF crystals,162 owing to the high surface area of the precursor, the resultant product turned out to be both active for the OER and ORR. Moreover, when applied in a solid-state Zn–air battery (Fig. 8c), it exhibited high activity with high open-circuit voltage around 1.42 V (Fig. 8a) and stability for 80 h at 50 mA DSNCs was derived from core–shell zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), in which the outer shell of Co-decorated N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (Co-NGC) was derived from ZIF-67 while the inner shell of N-doped microporous carbon (NC) was derived from ZIF-8, and the resulting sample was termed NC@Co-NGC DSNCs.159 The ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 core–shell structures possess a hierarchically micro/mesoporous structure and a high surface area, accounting for the good conductivity and facile diffusion kinetics.160,161 The ΔE of the NC@Co-NGC DSNCs was 0.82 V, which is better than that of the excellent Pt/C (0.94 V), RuO2 (1.0 V), and Co-NGC (0.95 V). This outstanding performance was derived largely from the Co-NGC shell in the NC@Co-NGC DSNCs and the hollow nanostructure enhanced the reaction kinetics. Amiinu also prepared a kind of Co-Nx/C nanorod array which derived from 3D ZIF crystals,162 owing to the high surface area of the precursor, the resultant product turned out to be both active for the OER and ORR. Moreover, when applied in a solid-state Zn–air battery (Fig. 8c), it exhibited high activity with high open-circuit voltage around 1.42 V (Fig. 8a) and stability for 80 h at 50 mA cm−2 with 2 h per circle (Fig. 8b and f). Interestingly, when the authors connected three little batteries in series, they could light a LED (Fig. 8e); besides, when recycling through charge and self-discharge stages (Fig. 8f), the battery still maintained a high voltage of 75.3–79.2%, which indicates a promising exploration of cost-effective and robust electrodes for high-energy Zn–air batteries' applications.

Similarly, Qiao and co-workers reported synthesis of catalyst embedding cobalt sulfide hollow nanospheres in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanoholes (Co1−xS/N–S-G) for both ORR and OER catalysis with outstanding performance and durability, which could be attributed to the high specific surface area and porous structure of the catalyst.163 As a result, the as-prepared Co1−xS/N–S-G exhibited excellent bifunctional activity with a potential gap (ΔE) of 0.76 V between the ORR and OER. Panagiotis et al. synthesized cobalt and nitrogen co-doped 3D hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) as an excellent catalyst for both the OER and ORR by a facile vacuum-assisted impregnation method.164 The hybrid catalyst exhibited comparable OER activity to RuO2, and higher ORR activity (with an onset-potential of 0.962 V at 5.55 mA cm−2) than Pt/C with an onset-potential of 0.955 V at 4.75 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the Co-N@HCS catalyst displayed outstanding methanol tolerance.
Biomass materials, which are widely distributed on the earth, are a kind of environment-friendly source of carbon and nitrogen with moderate price and could be further converted to hierarchically porous carbon networks. Recently, Wang and coworkers introduced a biomass-derived electrocatalyst for bifunctional ORR and OER catalysis. The electrocatalyst was prepared by anchoring Co3O4 nanoparticles on a cattle-bone-derived nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (denoted as Co3O4/NHPC).165 The Co3O4/NHPC product not only showed excellent ORR/OER activities, but can also be used as an ideal cathode for Zn–air batteries, which displayed an open-circuit potential of 1.39 V, and a specific capacity of 795 mA h g−1 at 2 mA cm−2. The utilization of ordinary cattle bone for preparing catalysts made good use of waste materials, which is considered as a suitable green synthesis method for high specific surface carbon materials. Besides, Liao et al. prepared a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst by using a biomass of Chlorella to synthesis N-doped CNTs and cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nanotubes by pyrolyzing a mixture of Chlorella, melamine, and cobaltous acetate (Fig. 9a).166 One of the products under pyrolysis at 900 °C (denoted as Co/M-Chlorella-900) exhibited high OER/ORR activities in 0.1 M KOH with a potential gap of 0.708 V between the OER and ORR, superior to Pt/C and IrO2 (Fig. 9b and c).

4.1.2 Fe-based electrocatalysts. 
Fe-related materials also can be utilized as excellent electrocatalysts for bifunctional oxygen electrodes. Many Fe-base sulfide/oxides,167,168 nitrides,169,170 perovskites,171 and carbon-based matrix compounds170 have been widely studied to expedite the sluggish ORR/OER kinetic energy. Recently, Zhao et al. applied multifunctional amorphous ferric borate assembled on Ni foam (am-Fe-Bi/NF) for rechargeable Zn–air batteries and water electrolysis.172 Moreover, the am-Fe-Bi/NF showed outstanding catalytic performance with a mass activity of 158.16 A g−1 and specific activity of 55.07 mA and required overpotentials of only 158 mV and 143 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Chen and co-workers developed a bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalyst of Fe-nitrogen species atomically dispersed on N and S co-decorated hierarchical carbon layers (S, N-Fe/N/C-CNT).173 The addition of CNT enhanced the durability of the catalyst in an acidic medium, and Fe atoms were atomically dispersed in the carbon layers. Compared with N-Fe/N/C-CNT, the addition of S helped to improve the catalyst's dissolution in acidic medium, which resulted in the increment in the surface area's exposure and active sites. The dissolution in acidic medium was improved by S addition and the surface area exposure increased as well, thus enhancing the exposure of active sites. Due to the synergistic effect between the unique N-doping and hierarchical morphology, the obtained material even shows a better electrocatalytic performance for the ORR and OER than commercial Pt/C. The authors stated that the Fe-Nx in S, N-Fe/N/C-CNT acted as highly active sites. Ravi et al. further reported the synthesis bifunctional electrocatalyst which combined N-enriched CNT with Fe–Fe3C co-embedded nanostructures in B-doped mesoporous carbon nanostructures (BFNCNTs) for bifunctional ORR/OER.174 For the OER, the BFNCNTs showed a low potential of 561 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 96 mV dec−1, which was superior to those of the boron doped carbon coated NCNTs (BNCNTs, 616 mV, 142 mV dec−1) and Fe–Fe3C containing carbon-coated NCNTs (598 mV, 141 mV dec−1). The authors proposed that the modification between the C–N bond and O–O bond by the graphitic N and the interaction of N and B with carbon are responsible for the high activity of the ORR, and the porous structure that offers an appropriate gas outlet is responsible for the OER. In addition, when applying a BFNCNTs@carbon paper (CNP) as the air cathode of a prototype metal–air battery, it could power a light emitting diode (LED), suggesting that the BFNCNTs could be practically utilized in battery applications.


4.1.3 Multicomponent metal electrocatalysts. 
Besides these monometallic electrocatalysts, some alloy compounds can also be applied as useful electrocatalysts for both the ORR and OER. For example, Gyutae and co-workers prepared a ternary Ni46Co40Fe14 nanoalloy with a carbon matrix as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER/ORR.175 The Ni46Co40Fe14 based Zn–air batteries showed a charge–discharge voltage of 0.8 V for a long period of 100 h. Likewise, Liu's group reported typical FeCo based nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nanotubes named N-GCNT/FeCo.176 A set of hybrid bifunctional electrocatalysts were fabricated by inserting FeSb alloy nanoparticles in N-doped carbon layers (termed FeSb-N-CLs) for Zn–air batteries.177 The FeSb-N-CLs-50 showed the best performance towards both the OER and ORR, with an open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V and a current density of 90 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V. Meanwhile, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the specific capacity and corresponding energy density of FeSb-N-CLs-50 were up to 714 mA h gzinc−1 (normalized to the mass of consumed zinc) and 864 W h kg−1, which were even higher than that of the Pt/C-based battery (647 mA h gzinc−1 and 790 W h kg−1). Moreover, it obtained a current density of 50 mA cm−2 with a potential difference of only 1.15 V between charge and discharge. Additionally, Zhang et al. reported a Co-based hydroxide as a precursor for synthesizing hydrosulphide Co3FeS1.5(OH)6 as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst,178 which showed outstanding activities with a 0.867 V overpotential gap for the OER/ORR in 0.1 M KOH. When applied as the cathode of Zn–air batteries, a specific capacity of 898 mA h g−1 was obtained, surpassing noble Pt/C (843 mA h g−1). Qiao et al. designed 3D hollow sphere Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs as bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and OER for rechargeable Zn–air batteries.179 Among all of the prepared products, Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs-350 had the excellent activities for both the ORR and OER. It showed an ORR onset potential of 0.87 V and demonstrated a high kinetic current density of 5.6 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V (Fig. 10a). The interface effect of the MnO2 nanotubes, Co3O4 nanoparticles, and CNT networks might explain the perfect ORR performance. As for the OER, the Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs-350 launched reaction at 1.59 V, driving a current density of 30 mA cm−2 at 2.0 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 10b). Meanwhile, the Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs-350 coating on a carbon fiber paper electrode was developed as an air cathode in a real Zn–air battery system. The electrode applied in the practical Zn–air battery system possessed an open circuit voltage of ∼1.47 V and could attain a current density of 233 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V, with a specific capacity of 775 mA h g−1, and an excellent energy density of 992 W h kg−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10c). Most importantly, the potential gap between charge and discharge was only 1.47 V (Fig. 10d).

During the preparation of catalysts, a variety of conductive substrates have been applied as current collectors and supports for directly growing electrocatalysts, which not only reduce the resistance of the carbon matrix but also provide more active sites, thus improving the electrochemical performance. The CuCo2O4 nanoparticles uniformly grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CuCo2O4/N-CNTs) exhibited bifunctional performance for both the OER and ORR.180 With a high specific area value of 116.18 m2 g−1, the CuCo2O4/N-CNTs showed excellent ORR activity with a positive onset potential of −0.04 V vs. SCE and a favorable Tafel slope of 76.53 mV dec−1. The doping of Cu into Co3O4 greatly enhanced the ORR activities and the use of CNTs as a matrix remarkably improved the conductivity of CuCo2O4 and improved the ORR/OER activities. The outstanding performance of the CuCo2O4/N-CNTs as a cathode for ORR application showed great promise for the large-scale production of metal–air batteries. The CuCo2O4/N-CNTs also showed decent activity for the OER with a potential of 10 mA cm−2 at 0.69 V (vs. SCE). Also, the Zn–air battery assembled with using CuCo2O4/N-CNTs as the air cathode displayed a specific capacitance of 817.4 mA h g−1 with a gravimetric energy density of 653.9 W h kg−1, suggesting potential for practical application in Zn–air batteries. A similar study was performed by another group, in which, NiFe-LDH was decorated on the Co, N co-doped carbon nanoframes (NiFe-LDH/Co, N-CNF) as bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable Zn–air batteries, as shown in Fig. 11a.181 Though the NiFe-LDH showed poor conductivity, the Co, N-CNF could compensate that drawback. This not only showed low charge voltage and high discharge voltage which were superior than those of other control samples (Fig. 11b) but also exhibited long term robustness around 80 h at a high current density of 25 mA cm−2 in the charge–discharge cycling test (Fig. 11c).

Since non-noble metal electrocatalysts are relatively expensive for commercial applications and some of them lack durability and high catalytic efficiency, carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts recently have attracted abundant research interests due to their favorable, stable and durable properties and merit of being cost-effective. Hu and Dai reported N, S co-doped graphitic sheets with stereoscopic holes over the graphite surface (SHG), which possessed trifunctional catalytic abilities towards the ORR, OER, and HER.182Fig. 12a shows the schematic of the preparation of SHG; after a series of treatment such as washing and freeze-drying, stereoscopic holes can still be observed in graphene sheets from both SEM (Fig. 12b) and TEM images (Fig. 12c and d). The SHG exhibited excellent ORR activity with a characteristic oxygen reduction peak at about 0.88 V, an onset potential of only around 1.01 V, a diffusion-limited current density of ≈5.10 mA cm−2, and half-wave potential of ≈0.87 V (Fig. 12e), which were comparable to those of the Pt/C electrode. As for the OER, it showed a small onset potential of 1.49 V and obtained a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a potential of only 1.56 V (Fig. 12f). Moreover, the Tafel slope of the SHG was as low as 71 mV dec−1, which meant more favorable kinetics toward the OER on the SHG electrode.183 In total, the potential difference ΔE between the ORR and OER was only 0.77 V, comparable with other carbon-based materials,184–186 revealing that the SHG seemed to be a promising oxygen electrode for metal–air batteries or fuel cells. Besides, the HER activities of the SHG were also determined in a three-electrode system with an onset potential of around 230 mV, the overpotential corresponding to 10 mA cm−2 was 310 mV (Fig. 12g), and the Tafel slope was 112 mV dec−1. In addition, the SHG also showed a stable activity for 20 h without degradation. Similarly, we reported the synthesis of a complex substance of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNTs) for multifunctional HER, ORR, OER, and glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) with high performance and excellent durability.187 Furthermore, the as-prepared Co@NCNTs can be applied as air cathode materials for Zn–air batteries with an open circuit voltage of ∼1.5 V and a maximum power density of ∼138.82 mW cm−2. As for HER catalysis, they obtained a Tafel slope of 93 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and exhibited good selectivity and sensitivity for the detection of glucose. For a legitimate comparison, Table 2 shows some bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the OER and ORR in alkaline electrolyte.

5. Conclusions and outlook
The exhaustive exploitation of fossil fuels and the stringent environmental issues force us to research and develop alternative and viable sources of energy to maintain sustainable development. While some renewable clean energies, such as solar, wind, tide and other natural resources, have increasingly become the feasible approaches for energy generation, it should be noted that these sources are seasonal and therefore require large-scale energy technologies to fulfill their efficient utilization. The energy conversion system represents a highly competitive technique to convert these renewable energies into energy carriers (e.g., H2) or value-added chemicals, and can complement each other perfectly with energy storage technologies, such as batteries and supercapacitors.
This review mainly focuses on transition metal (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe, and Mo) based bifunctional electrocatalysts; one thing for sure is that these catalysts have been researched widely and most of them present satisfying ability for electrochemical conversions compared with the state-of-art materials based on precious metals. In particular, non-precious metal-based oxides, sulfides, selenides, nitrides, carbides, etc. have been demonstrated as typical catalysts. From the studies mentioned above, we can discover that when adding another metallic element or more, the performance will be improved in most cases. In addition, some post processing like vulcanization and phosphorization can also enhance the electrochemical ability of precursors like metal hydroxides; however sometimes these treatments could lead to the collapse of the sheet structure, and thus the addition of highly conductive and stable substrates (e.g., graphene, CNTs, and Ni foam) is necessary. Despite these merits, the current status of utilizing bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion system still needed to be improved; moreover, there is still room for the increment of bifunctional non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts. Devising the morphology to enlarge the specific area with more active sites is vital, so the mastery of morphology engineering which largely depends on theoretical calculation is essential.188,189 Developing highly efficient and low cost bifunctional electrocatalysts is therefore highly desirable because it can significantly simplify the process of materials preparation and electrode fabrication when applied in a single energy conversion cell. And indeed, precious metal-free electrocatalysts, according to the research work reported so far, show highly desirable catalytic activity toward reactions involved in a single energy conversion device. The present review summarizes several categories of bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, use as bifunctional oxygen electrodes, HER & MOR, etc. We would emphasize that there are still huge spaces for further improving the catalytic performance by either exploring new electrocatalysts or optimizing the existing bifunctional electrocatalysts, and the challenges faced in this topic mainly include but are not limited to the below points: first, we need to balance catalytic performance of the bifunctional electrocatalyst toward the associated oxidation reaction and reduction reaction, so that the energy conversion device can perform to an extreme; second, special attention should be paid to the stability of the bifunctional electrocatalysts, since the redox catalytic process would inevitably induce “deactivation” or even decomposition of the catalyst, especially most energy conversion devices run in a highly aggressive acidic or alkaline environment; in the view of practical or commercial applications, we need to strive to develop general, reliable and scalable routes to fabricating high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst electrodes, the in situ growth of bifunctional electrocatalysts on current collectors, such as carbon fiber cloth and metal foam, could be the most ideal strategy due to its advantages of being binder free, low contact resistance, and simple preparation; in addition, more efforts need to be devoted to understanding what the active sites are in bifunctional electrocatalysts and how they function when independently catalyzing oxidation and reduction reactions; in this regard, in situ online techniques are desirable by coupling with theoretically calculations to achieve a better understanding of the exact catalytic mechanism at the atomic scale. Last but not least, the effects of the other factors, such as the supporting matrix, operating temperature, and electrolyte pH, on the catalytic performance should be extensively studied as most of the devices tend to run in varied environments. We hope that the present brief review can not only educate the new researchers to start exploration of bifunctional electrocatalysts, but also bring forth inspiring points with experienced researchers to contribute to this promising field.
