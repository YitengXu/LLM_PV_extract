    , Accepted 7th January 2014First published on 18th February 2014AbstractGrayscale (halftone) laser printing is developed as a low-cost and solution processable fabrication method for ITO-free, semi-transparent and conducting Ag electrodes extendable over large area on a flexible substrate. The transmittance and sheet resistance is easily tunable by varying the grayscale value of the color fill between 10% to 20%. The operation of electrodes is demonstrated by fabricating a transparent push button, an electrochromic window and a solar cell.
Introduction
It has long been dreamt that organic and flexible electronics will become an integral part of our day to day life in the form of wearable clothes, e-paper, displays, tablets, smartphones etc.1,2 The future of electronics relies on flexible and transparent devices that can probably fit anywhere while being nearly inconspicuous. There is world-wide effort in developing invisible TFTs, microheaters, electrochromic devices, photovoltaics, LCDs, LEDs, memory devices etc.3–9 using functional materials with transparent and conducting (TC) layers as central part of those devices. Indium tin oxide (ITO) has long remained indispensible as the material of choice and with fast growing IT technology, finding a suitable alternate to ITO has become a billion dollar challenge.10 Nanostructured materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, metal nanowires, metal oxides are some of the widely explored materials for alternatives to ITO.11–16 The interplay between sheet resistance and transmittance of the emerging new TC electrodes is always an issue.17,18 In addition to the desired optical and electrical properties, there is much importance given these days to other attributes such as uniformity over a large area and flexibility of the TC electrode.19 In order not to compromise the cost, researchers in this field are eagerly on the lookout for simple, inexpensive, solution-based processes requiring minimal infrastructure yet are amenable to high throughput and scalability.20 If one can satisfy these stringent but essential requirements simultaneously, a winning solution to ITO replacement can be reached.
Depending on the application – voltage or current driven – a compromise is reached with respect to the TC electrode.21 In voltage-driven devices such as touch screens on LCD displays, higher transmittance of the TC electrode is desired and a low sheet resistance is not mandatory. In these cases, graphene and carbon nanotube networks could be suitable as TC materials, enabling optical transmission beyond 90% (sheet resistance, >100 Ω sq−1).22 In applications requiring current collection, one usually compromises on transmittance in order to achieve low sheet resistance. Ultra thin metal films, networked metal nanowire films, graphene and conducting polymers etc., in combination with a metal grid have shown great potential in recent studies.23–28 However, micron-size printed grids have the drawback that they are easily visible and therefore not suitable for touch screen type applications.29
Towards these goals, we have developed a method of designing Ag electrodes that can be practically adopted to any laboratory or to industry. The technique is based on grayscale xerographic lithography, which has not been explored in this context. Our method requires a standard office laser printer and a pack of A4 size PET (polyethylene terephthalate) sheets, which are ubiquitous at all workplaces. A region of interest is printed at a desired gray level without defining any internal features. In the following step, a direct full layer coating of the Ag precursor ink is printed over the PET sheet. A detailed study on the metallization of Ag ink is given in the ESI,† Fig. S1. Highly conducting patterns (<10 Ω sq−1) are obtained after thermolysing the precursor in an oven and lifting-off the toner. By far, this is a relatively simple patterning technique compared to other procedures either involving special printing methods or customized Ag ink (vide infra). The efficacy of the prepared TC electrodes was demonstrated by fabricating a transparent push button, an electrochromic device and polymer solar cell device.
Most laser printers can print on transparency sheets by changing the printing preferences during the print job. The laser printing method adopted in most commercial printers is illustrated in the ESI,† Fig. S2. This method has been previously applied for fabricating photolithography masks, etch masks, microfluidics etc.30–34 We used the toner printed by the laser printer as a negative template, which is then developed with a conducting Ag ink followed by the toner lift-off. Keeping high transparency through the conductive patterns as the main objective, the design to be printed was optimised to have a spatial resolution as fine as possible. The maximum resolution achievable for printing with a 1200 dpi printer is at best 100 μm, below which the feature becomes ill-defined (see ESI,† Fig. S3). Here, we employed a trickier approach of grayscale printing (digital halftoning) to define high-resolution patterns. Usually, the halftoning technique is used to produce a grayscale effect by converting the digital image into a pattern of black dots by a binary process to produce the continuous tones of the original image. The arrangement of dots can vary from printer to printer depending on the applied screening algorithm. There are 256 gray levels known, that can all be printed with just one black toner by adjusting the size and spacing between the dots so as to create an illusive mix that the human eye perceives as gray.35 Obviously, for lighter gray shades, the density of black dots decreases whereas darker shades contain more or larger black dots with closer spacing. A carefully chosen grayscale level can define a patterned array of dots with the highest possible resolution.
Experimental section
Fabrication of electrode and related characterization
The patterns were prepared by designing areas of interest on an A4-sized layout with different gray levels using Adobe Illustrator software CS6 and printing on transparencies (Oddy Transparency Film, Polyester Product Code: CT100A4100) with a Xerox Workcentre-7345 Digital Printer (1200 dpi) using only black toner. This resulted in a dot pattern of toner on the PET sheet. Ag precursor ink (SC-100, 20 wt%, Kunshan Hisense Electronics Co., Ltd., China) was filtered with a 0.45 μm size filter and diluted by adding 3 times the volume of isopropanol. The Ag ink solution was then coated on the laser printed PET sheet (used as a template) using an automated motor controlled rod coater (K-101 control coater, RK Print Coat Instruments Ltd, UK) with a rod wire diameter of 0.15 mm, resulting in a wet layer thickness of ∼12 μm. The Ag ink was decomposed to Ag by heating inside oven at 120 °C for 30 min. The toner was removed by mildly sonicating in toluene at 80 Hz for 1 min and the PET carrying the patterned Ag film was rinsed with isopropanol followed by drying under N2.
Characterization
The patterns were photographed with a digital camera (Sony Cyber-shot, DSC H70). An optical microscope (Laben, India) was used for measuring the feature sizes. Surface profilometry was carried out using a contactless, 3D, white light interferometer (Veeco Wyko NT9100). The morphology of Ag was analyzed in air using an atomic force microscopy (Di Innova SPM, Bruker) under contact mode using standard cantilevers. SEM imaging was done using a Nova NanoSEM 600 instrument (FEI Co., The Netherlands). The transmittance of the film was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV/visible/near-IR spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere. Sheet resistance was measured using 4-Point Probe Station (Jandel Model RM3, UK).
Electrochromic display
Electrochromic devices were fabricated by spin coating the electrochromic polymers and electrolyte gel onto the transparent Ag electrodes. The two electrodes were prepared by following the procedure reported by some of us previously.36 Briefly, the two electrodes were spin coated with a 20 mg ml−1 toluene solution of poly(2,2-bis(2-ethylhexyloxymethyl)-propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-thiophene-2,5-diyl (ECP-magenta) and poly(N-octadecyl-(propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-pyrrole-2,5-diyl) also called a minimally color changing polymer (MCCP) at 800 rpm (∼200 nm layer thickness) onto the primary and secondary electrodes respectively. An electrolyte gel comprising PMMA and 1-ethyl-2-methyl-imidazolium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was spin coated at 1500 rpm onto both electrodes. The two electrodes were placed on top of each other and the devices were encapsulated using pressure sensitive adhesive (3M 467MP) with a double layer absorption of ∼30%. A Keithley 2400 Source meter was used for monitoring and switching of the device and the transmittance was measured simultaneously using a Pharma Spec UV-1700 from Shimadzu.
Normal geometry polymer solar cell
A mixture of P3HT and PCBM in 1,2-chlorobenzene (1:1 ratio, 20 mg mL−1) was prepared by stirring at 60 °C overnight. The grayscale printed transparent Ag electrode was spin coated with PEDOT:PSS (Clevious 4083 from Heraeus) at 3000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 130 °C for 5 minutes. The P3HT:PCBM solution was deposited at 500 rpm for 45 s resulting in 300 nm thick film. The Al electrode was evaporated using the shadow mask. Before the solar cell was characterized, it was annealed at 140 °C for 5 minutes. The measurement was done with a Keithley 2400 source meter under a KHS 575 solar simulator with an AM 1.5G 1000 W m−2 intensity.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic of the steps involved in the fabrication of Ag electrodes by digital grayscale printing. Briefly, a gray level is defined with the help of software and toner is printed on the PET sheet using a common laser printer. Ag ink is coated on a toner printed PET sheet either by spin coating or rod coating and thermolysed at 120 °C for 30 min in a hot air oven. Subsequently, the toner is removed by sonicating in toluene resulting in highly conducting patterns. Fig. 1b–e show the patterns obtained by grayscale printing of different gray levels from 10% to 40%. As shown in Fig. 1b, a 10% gray level results in well-separated dots of toner with a diameter of ∼90 μm and spacing of ∼40 μm. As the grayscale level increased, the spacing between the dots decreased. For 20% gradient, the distance between the dots became ill-defined due to spreading at the edges (Fig. 1c). On further increasing the gradient to 30% and 40% (Fig. 1d and e, respectively), the printed black dots begin to overlap resulting in diamond shaped discontinuous patterns. The optical profiler images in Fig. 1f and g show the morphology and roughness of the Ag on PET after developing for 10% and 20% gradient fills respectively. The Ag surface exhibits an average roughness of ∼20 nm with a few spikes of ∼180 nm high at the edge of the holes probably due to some unwashed toner. A number of grayscale printed patterns were prepared in this range (12%, 14%, 16% and 18%) and beyond (22%), and in each case, the toner fill fraction and the spacing between holes after lift-off was estimated (Fig. 1h). We realise that the gray level should be chosen correctly to give an unbroken Ag network generated after the toner lift-off. The toner fill fraction is in the range of 60% to 80% for the printed gray level of 10% to 22%. This implies that Ag area coverage varies between 20%–40%, which ultimately decides the transparency (discussed later in detail).

A large area electrode prepared by rod coating with Ag ink on a laser printed PET sheet with a 12% gray level is shown in Fig. 2. The uniformity of electrodes was examined by studying the distribution of sheet resistance and compiling the resistance map across a 90 mm × 90 mm square area with a pixel size of 5 mm2, as shown in Fig. 2b. The mean value for the sheet resistance across the entire area was calculated to be 45.3 Ω sq−1 with some areas with a low resistance of 5 Ω sq−1 (blue) and higher resistance of 150 Ω sq−1 (red) at the edges (see Fig. 2b). Over large areas, the resistance is uniform except for a few defective areas where the resistance was observed to be slightly higher. High transmittance is one of the desired properties for the new generation of device electrodes. High visible clarity ensures less optical loss and better performance. The transmittance of the film was studied in the visible range from 350–800 nm for the Ag patterned films of different grayscale as shown in Fig. 2c. The transmittance spectra exhibit a sharp peak at 320 nm and are nearly flat over the broad wavelength range with a maximum transmission of 78% corresponding to a printed gray level of 22%. The experimental transmittance is greater than the expected value based on the fill fraction, because of the additional transmittance gain of ∼10% from nanostructured holes present in the Ag film (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The sheet resistance and transmittance variations with respect to different gray levels are shown in Fig. 2d. With increasing gray values from 10% to 22%, the transmittance of the films decreased from 72% to 45% and the sheet resistance dropped from 210 to 7 Ω sq−1. The relation of transmittance with sheet resistance can be seen readily in Fig. 2e. There is a gradual increase in transmission that reaches saturation at higher resistance values. It is interesting to find out the value for the figure of merit using an equation based on σDC/σOP (ratio of DC conductivity and optical conductivity), mostly employed for new generation electrodes. As seen from Fig. 2f, a value of 49.5 was obtained which is slightly higher than the industrial standard of 35 (calculated based on T = 90% and Rs = 100 Ω sq−1). These electrodes exhibit excellent mechanical properties as seen by the bendability test shown in Fig. S4.† The electrode (12% gray) was bent to different bending angles by fixing one end and moving around glass vials of known diameters. The sheet resistance was simply unaffected in spite of a large number of bending cycles. The Ag ink strongly adheres to the PET substrate (Fig. S5†) resulting in extremely stable electrodes that can sustain harsh treatments such as sonication and exposure to organic vapor. The extreme stability of these electrodes would be of immense importance in flexible device applications.

The transparent conducting electrodes can be used in wide variety of applications; a few of them are demonstrated in Fig. 3. A simple resistive transparent push button is fabricated by bringing in the flexible Ag/PET sheet (20% gray) against a rigid transparent ITO surface separated by an air gap. This is connected to a circuit with a power supply such that the touching of the surface is registered by glowing of an LED light. When pressure is applied to the top flexible screen using a finger or stylus, the flexible electrode comes in contact with the rigid ITO/glass substrate and forms an electrical contact. This completes the circuit and the LED is switched on. As soon as the finger is removed, the LED switches off and this could be done across every coordinate with 100% success. The fabricated push button screen exhibits good transparency as seen by the optical photograph in Fig. 3a. The electrochromic device (ECD) configuration is shown in the schematic in Fig. 3c. The two different polymers were spin coated on printed Ag electrodes (20% gray) acting as the anode and cathode and separated with the solid electrolyte layer. The device could be switched from a magenta to bleached state by applying a negative potential of −0.5 V and reversed by application of +1 V as shown in Fig. 3d. The bleaching of the device results in an increase of transmittance by ∼12.5% as seen by the transmittance spectra in Fig. 3e. The optical modulation in transmission was monitored at 550 nm for repeated switching cycles as shown in Fig. 3f. Due to the presence of non-conductive holes in the gradient printed pattern, the electrical field in the electrode plane may become non-homogeneous affecting the device performance. We see tapering of the switching profile and slightly uneven switching. The electrochromic response time during the coloring and bleaching processes was ∼8 s, comparable to ITO based devices.

A conventional P3HT:PCBM based polymer solar cell was fabricated in the normal geometry configuration using the flexible gradient electrode on PET as shown in Fig. 4a. Here, the Ag gradient pattern serves as a current collecting electrode. The J–V characteristics of the device with 12% printed gray level electrode (Fig. 4b) gave a VOC of 0.46 V, a current density JSC of −4.14 mA cm−2 and FF (fill factor) of 35.61% resulting in an efficiency of 0.67%. The fill factor and short circuit current values are somewhat lower for this prototype device, but rigorous optimization should result in a better performance.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown how a simple method of grayscale printing can be adopted for producing large area transparent conducting metal electrodes to be employed directly in organic electronics. Based on the application need, these electrodes can be obtained with optimized sheet resistance and transmission by tuning the gray level. The presence of nanoholes is an additional attribute, giving rise to enhanced transmission even at relatively high fill factors something unique to the precursor ink used. Transmission over 70% can be obtained with sheet resistance below 100 Ω sq−1 depending on the fill. A higher DPI printer (>1200 dpi) would probably give better transmittance without affecting the sheet resistance. This is a low cost alternative to ITO for laboratory-based research and prototyping of TCE devices. We demonstrate the applicability of these electrodes by way of fabricating a push button screen, an electrochromic window and a solar cell. Future scope of this work may involve a two-level patterning producing Ag line and area patterns with varied grayscale fill. This procedure enables anyone to quickly pursue experiments exploring new ideas for active layers and electrode design. It is yet another technique in the area of printed electronics that not only ensures flexibility and fast production in ambient conditions but also is low cost and less time consuming. We envisage that this development tool will enable rapid scaling once a successful electrode outline or device is developed.
