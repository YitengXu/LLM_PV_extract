    , Accepted 19th June 2012First published on 22nd June 2012AbstractWe have demonstrated an efficient one-step synthesis of pyrene end-capped thiophene oligomers as active materials for organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and donor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). In particular, the OTFT device based on 5,5′′-di(pyren-1-yl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3s) exhibited a reasonable field effect mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.20% was achieved when 3s was used as active materials in OSCs. These pyrene end-capped thiophene oligomers are considered to be good organic semiconducting materials for OTFTs and OSCs.
Introduction
Organic semiconducting materials have been extensively investigated as building blocks for organic electronic devices such as organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs), organic solar cells (OSCs), sensors, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags.1–26 Linearly fused aromatic compounds such as pentacene, tetracene, and oligothiophene derivatives have been widely studied as organic semiconductors due to their effective charge carrier transport properties.1–26 The good fluorescent quantum yield and solid state π–π stacking properties of pyrene derivatives have been exploited in biological probes,27 electrogenerated chemiluminescent (ECL) materials,28 active OTFT materials,29 and blue light-emitting30 and electron transporting31 materials in OLEDs.32 Recently, Fages et al. reported new active materials for OTFTs, consisting of oligothiophene and pyrene moieties linked with conjugated bonds. The devices fabricated using pyrene-substituted thiophene oligomers as p-type OTFTs exhibited field-effect mobility values in the range of 10−3–10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.33 Furthermore, only a few pyrene derivatives have been studied as donor materials for OSCs34 and organic dye materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).35 To the best of our knowledge, pyrene-based organic materials have not so far been simultaneously utilized as both donor materials in OSCs and active materials in OTFTs. In this paper, we report new organic semiconducting materials 2,5-di(pyren-1-yl)thiophene (1s) and 5,5′′-di(pyren-1-yl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3s), consisting of oligothiophene and pyrene, as active materials for OTFTs and donor materials for OSCs. A fabricated OTFT device based on 3s exhibited a field-effect mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.2% was achieved in OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and instruments
All chemicals, including octadecyltrichlorosilane, 2,5-dibromothiophene, 5,5′′-dibromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene, 1-pyreneboronic acid, and palladium tetrakisphenyl phosphonate, were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received unless otherwise specified. 1H spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 using an Advance 300 MHz and 600 MHz Bruker spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer from Bruker. Elemental analysis was performed using a Carlo-Erba model EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TGA Q-5000-IR (TA instrument) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed on a DSC-Q-1000 (TA instrument) at 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco FP-7500 spectrophotometer. For solid-state measurements, the materials were thermally vapor deposited onto quartz plates in a vacuum chamber to form 50 nm thick films. The cyclic voltammetric apparatus used was a CH Instruments model 700 C electrochemical workstation. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at room temperature in a three-electrode cell with a working electrode (Au), a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), and a counter electrode (Pt), in dichlorobenzene containing tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. All potentials were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. MO calculations were carried out by DFT methods at the B3LYP-6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian03 program. AFM experiments were performed using an Asylum MFP-3D instrument in AC mode with Si3N4 cantilevers. XRD analyses were carried out at room temperature at 40 kV and 100 mA using a Mac Science (M18XHF-22) diffractometer with CuKα radiation as the X-ray source. Data were collected in the conventional θ–2θ configuration (3–30°).

OTFT fabrication
Transistors based on two kinds of pyrene end-capped thiophene derivatives were fabricated with the top contact geometry. A heavily doped Si wafer was used as the gate electrode and either a non-pretreated or OTS-treated SiO2 layer (thickness, ca. 300 nm) was used as the gate dielectric. Prior to deposition, 1s or 3s was purified by temperature gradient vacuum sublimation to improve the purity of the active layer. The films (ca. 500 Å) were then grown by vacuum sublimation using a home-made apparatus, at a rate of 0.8 Å s−1 under a working pressure in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 × 10−6 Torr. Gold source–drain electrodes were vapor deposited on top of the films through a shadow mask with a channel length (L) of 50 μm and a channel width (W) of 1000 μm. Electrical characterization of the transistors was performed at room temperature in air using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor analyzer. The field-effect mobility (μ) was calculated in the saturation region (VDS = −100 V) from the plot of the square root of drain current vs. VGS using the following equation: IDS = (WCiμ(VGS − VT)2)/2L, where IDS is the source–drain saturation current; Ci (1.1 × 10−8 F) is the capacitance of the SiO2 insulator; W/L is the ratio of the width to the channel length; VGS and VT are the gate–source and threshold voltages, respectively.
OSC fabrication
MoO3 of 10 nm thickness was used as a hole injection layer (HIL). Thin films of 1s and 3s with thicknesses from 10 nm to 30 nm were prepared by a vapor deposition process. A fullerene (C60) layer of 40 nm thickness, used as an acceptor, was then vapor deposited. Next, a 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) layer of 10 nm thickness as an exciton blocking layer (EBL) was vapor deposited, and finally, an aluminum layer of 100 nm thickness was vapor deposited onto the BCP layer. The current–voltage measurements of the devices were performed on a Keithley 237 instrument. The device performances were characterized under uniform illumination (AM 1.5G illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Newport, 91160A). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using the standard Si solar cell as a reference.
Results and discussion
Compounds 1s and 3s were easily synthesized by the palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction between dibromothiophene (or dibromoterthiophene) and 1-pyreneboronic acid (Scheme 1). Compounds 1s and 3s were identified by 1H NMR, HR-mass and EA analyses. The thermal, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of 1s and 3s are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 1 shows the absorption (UV) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CH2Cl2 solutions and solid films of 1s and 3s. The UV spectra of 1s and 3s show absorption maximum bands at 372 nm and 412 nm in CH2Cl2, respectively, which correspond to the π–π* transition of pyrene and oligothiophene, respectively. The UV spectra of 1s and 3s show absorption maximum bands at 324 nm and 391 nm in film, which are 48 nm and 21 nm blue-shifted when compared to the absorption in solution. The blue shift in the solid state is presumably caused by the formation of H-type aggregates.36 Emission maxima were observed at 482 nm and 519 nm in the PL spectra of 1s and 3s in CH2Cl2. The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of 1s and 3s were 369 °C and 433 °C, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicative of the high thermal stability of both species. The HOMO and LUMO energies of 1s and 3s were determined from UV, PL, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The measured HOMO energy levels of 1s and 3s were 5.45 eV and 5.26 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy levels are consistent with the results derived from DFT calculations (Fig. S4, ESI†). The crystalline and morphological characteristics of 1s and 3s were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The XRD patterns of 1s and 3s deposited on an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO2/Si substrate at various substrate temperatures (Tsub) are shown in Fig. 2. The thin-film XRD patterns of 1s and 3s displayed primary diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.40° and 3.50°, respectively, with multi-orders (Fig. 2). The XRD patterns were indicative of lamellar ordering on the OTS-treated substrate. The d-spacings of 1s and 3s obtained from reflection data were 20.06 Å, and 25.22 Å, respectively, which were comparable to the molecular lengths obtained from MM2 calculations (19.22 Å and 26.63 Å). These results indicated a near-perpendicular alignment of the molecules relative to the OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrate.

Fig. 3 shows the respective AFM images of 50 nm thick films of 1s and 3s deposited on the OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrate at various temperatures (Tsub). Marked differences in the morphology of the thin-films of 1s and 3s were observed. The 1s films exhibited fiber-like grains, when grown on the OTS-treated substrate at Tsub = 20 °C, and two-dimensional layered morphologies with crystalline grains at Tsub = 75 °C and 110 °C, respectively. However, the crystalline grains were incompletely interconnected in the films formed at Tsub = 110 °C, making these films OTFT inactive. These results indicated that molecular ordering in the solid state was dramatically influenced by differences in the substrate temperature during deposition. The 3s films exhibited small dot like grains, when grown on the OTS-treated substrate at Tsub = 20 °C, and at Tsub = 110 °C. On the other hand, the grain size of the 3s film at Tsub = 75 °C is much bigger than that in films deposited at Tsub = 20 °C, and at Tsub = 110 °C.

The field effect properties of 1s and 3s were investigated in fabricated OTFT devices having the top-contact geometry. We fabricated twelve OTFT devices under the same conditions. Among the device data collected, we reported the highest field effect mobility values. Thin films of the compounds were formed by vapor deposition onto either untreated or OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates at various temperatures (Tsub = 20 °C, 75 °C, and 110 °C). All of the OTFTs showed typical p-channel TFT characteristics. Fig. 4 shows the output and transfer characteristics of the 3s-based OTFTs grown at Tsub = 75 °C. The OTFTs exhibited p-type field effect mobility (μFET) with a value of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 3.0 × 106 and a threshold voltage (Vth) of −8.9 V in a saturation regime. The electrical performance of OTFTs based on these pyrene end-capped thiophene oligomers depends critically on the fabrication conditions. The 1s-based OTFTs had lower mobilities than 3s-based OTFTs, in the range of 3.2 × 10−6–6.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5, ESI†). In contrast, the 3s-based OTFTs showed higher mobilities in the range of 2.4 × 10−5–0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1. This field-effect mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 is considered to be good compared to oligothiophene and pyrene-based active materials for OTFTs.33 The device performance data are summarized in Table 2.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of 1s and 3s, we fabricated OSC devices with the configuration of ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/1s or 3s (10–30 nm)/C60 (30 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/1s or 3s:C60 (40 nm)/BCP (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The thicknesses of 1s and 3s were varied from 10 nm to 30 nm. We fabricated four OSC devices under the same conditions. Among the device data, we reported the highest power conversion efficiency values. Fig. 5(a) shows the current density vs. voltage (I–V) characteristics of the heterojunction solar cells. All of the OSCs exhibit the heterojunction solar cell behavior. The optimized 15 nm 1s-based device had a short circuit current (Isc) of 2.12 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.56; from these data, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was determined to be 0.83% (Fig. S6a (ESI†) and Table 3). Similarly, the optimized 15 nm 3s-based device had a short circuit current of 2.24 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.70 V, and a fill factor of 0.63; from these data, the power conversion efficiency was determined to be 1.0% (Fig. 5(a) and Table 3). Generally, varying the thickness of the 1s and 3s films in the active layer resulted in a change in the power conversion efficiency between 0.8% and 1.0%. Fig. 5(b) shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) characteristics of heterojunction solar cells utilizing 3s. In the optimized heterojunction solar cells, compounds 1s and 3s show IPCE values with a maximum of 25% at 450 nm for 1s and 31% at 450 nm for 3s (Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S6b (ESI†)). The IPCE maxima are in agreement with the thin film absorption spectra. The higher short circuit current and power conversion efficiency for the device based on 3s compared to the device based on 1s are reflected in the higher IPCE values in the long wavelength region and higher hole mobility. In particular, the 40 nm 3s and C60 co-deposited device had a short circuit current of 3.24 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.85 V, and a fill factor of 0.44; from these data, the power conversion efficiency was determined to be 1.2% when annealed at 60 °C for 10 min after device fabrication (Fig. 6 and Table 3). The maximum power conversion efficiency (1.2%) is reasonably good among OSC devices fabricated using other small molecule derivatives.23 Compound 3s can be regarded as a suitable active material for heterojunction solar cells. The power conversion efficiency of 1.2% and a field-effect mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 are considered to be good compared to quarterthiophene-based active materials for OTFTs and OSCs.37 The overall device performance data based on 1s/C60 or 3s/C60 are summarized in Table 3.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated an efficient one-step synthesis of pyrene end-capped thiophene oligomers as active materials for OTFTs and donor materials for OSCs. In particular, the OTFT device based on 3s exhibited a reasonable field effect mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.20% was achieved when 3s was used as active materials in OSCs. These pyrene end-capped thiophene oligomers are considered to be good organic semiconducting materials for OTFTs and OSCs. Further studies on pyrene end-capped oligoacene derivatives are in progress.
