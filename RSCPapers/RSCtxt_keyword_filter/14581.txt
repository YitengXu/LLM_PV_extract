    , Accepted 6th August 2020First published on 10th August 2020AbstractIn this study, we investigate two copolymers as electron donors in photovoltaic devices, PFO-DBT (poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole]) and its analogue with Si, PSiF-DBT (poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-dibenzosilole)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole]). The results discussed here are related to the influence of heavy atoms on the electrical and morphological properties of the devices. Charge transfer dynamics in the polymeric films were evaluated using the core–hole clock method. Besides that, using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods, we investigate the electronic structure and charge transfer properties of the two systems. The charge transfer rates were estimated in the framework of the semiclassical Marcus/Hush theory. We found that the better stacking between the polymer chains for PSiF-DBT provides higher solar absorption capacity in regions of higher wavelengths and faster hole transfer rates. We also obtain a faster electron transfer rate at the PSiF-DBT/C60 interface compared to the PFO-DBT/C60 interface that is mainly related to the difference in the driving force between the two systems. These features help to explain why the organic photovoltaic devices using PSiF-DBT as the active layer exhibited a higher performance compared to devices using PFO-DBT. Here, we show that our results are able to provide important insights about the parameters that can influence the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Introduction
The development of new broad absorption conjugated polymers has become extremely important to achieve better organic photovoltaic device performance.1,2 In this context, conjugated copolymers using the donor/acceptor (D/A) approach have been shown to be promising due to improved solar radiation absorption capacity and charge mobility.3–6 D/A copolymers have the characteristic of alternating donor and acceptor electron units. This feature has been proven to be an effective approach to reduce the copolymer band gap through internal charge transfer (ICT), improving the absorption spectrum. In addition, ICT leads to a more delocalized electronic density, making the conjugated backbone more planar, which promotes a better π-stacking, allowing a more efficient charge transport.7–9
Studies also show that small changes in the chemical structure of materials can cause major changes in device performance.10–14 In particular, silicon bridging in the copolymer backbone has shown higher crystallinity and better stacking between chains compared to analogous but carbon bridged copolymers. In this context, studies with carbon bridged copolymer C-PCPDTBT and silicon bridged Si-PCPDTBT were reported. Si-PCPDTBT exhibits a larger crystalline part corresponding to a crystal structure more favorable to high hole mobilities when compared to C-PCPDTBT. When mixed with fullerene derivatives and applied to organic solar cells, silicon bridges materials showed improved charge transport properties, reduced bimolecular recombination, and reduced formation of charge transfer complexes.15–17
Here, we investigated the optical, morphological and performance properties of organic photovoltaic devices with films composed of PSiF-DBT (poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-dibenzosilole)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole]) copolymer and its Si-free analog PFO-DBT (poly[2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole]) copolymer, whose chemical structures are outlined in Fig. 1a and b. The devices were fabricated in a fixed geometry suitable for comparison, that is, in the bilayer heterojunction structure (Fig. 1c). The idea is avoiding possible differences in polymer/fullerene blend nanostructures due to phase separation, which is responsible for the number of interfaces where the exciton dissociation occurs.

We studied the charge transfer dynamics using the core–hole clock method and modelled the system using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods18 to better understand the correlation between morphology, electronic properties and photovoltaic response.5,19
Experimental methods
Films with electron donor semiconductor materials, PSiF-DBT (purchased from Sigma Aldrich®) and PFO-DBT (purchased from Sigma Aldrich®) were prepared using o-dichlorobenzene (O-DCB). A concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was prepared for PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT. The solutions were kept stirring until the materials dissolved. Afterwards, the films were deposited on previously washed substrates, by spin coating.
Optical characterization was performed using a quartz substrate. The UV-vis spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer model NIR 2101. Fluorog® – 3 spectrofluorometer equipment was used for photoluminescence measurements, and the films were excited at 550 nm.
For the manufacture of organic photovoltaic devices, glass substrates with indium tin oxide (ITO) were used. On the previously cleaned glass/ITO substrate, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxithiophene):poly(4-sulfonated styrene) (PEDOT:PSS®-Sigma Aldrich) was deposited by the spin coating method, obtaining homogeneous films with thicknesses around 40 nm. These films were thermally treated at 100 °C for 20 minutes in a vacuum oven. Then, also by the spin coating method, the active electron donor layer of PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT prepared as previously presented was deposited. This structure was taken through the evaporation process of C60 and aluminum layers with the approximate thicknesses of 30 nm and 100 nm, respectively.
Photovoltaic characterization was carried out by solar simulation using an Oriel 6902 xenon lamp with a power of 150 W, an AM 1.5 air filter, 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), and a voltage-coupled peak-ammeter (Keithley, model 6487).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were also performed. The operating mode of the microscope used was intermittent contact through the Shimadzu microscope, model SPM-9700. The AFM images were obtained on films with the same structure used to manufacture the devices.
In this study, spectroscopic experiments were performed at the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy (SXS) beamline at Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in Campinas, São Paulo. With the aim of getting insight into the morphological structure of the films on the surface and in the bulk, the photoabsorption experiments were carried out in both total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence yield (FY) modes, respectively. The drain current was used to obtain the total electron yield (TEY) spectra and a photodiode detector was utilized to measure the spectra in the fluorescence yield (FY) mode. The photon flux was simultaneously monitored by an Au grid, which is used to normalize the final data to correct for fluctuations of the beam intensity. In order to explore the polarization dependency, photoabsorption spectra were measured at different X-ray incident angles. A Si(111) double-crystal monochromator with energy resolution of 0.38 eV was employed to measure the sulfur 1s absorption edge and its photon energy was calibrated by LIII transition (2p3/2 → 4d) of metallic molybdenum. NEXAFS data were finally analyzed using the Origin and Athena softwares. Resonant Auger spectroscopy (RAS) was performed to calculate the charge transfer time. A hemispherical electron energy analyzer with a pass energy of 20 eV was utilized to obtain the RAS spectra and the final data were treated by the CasaXPS software using the Gaussian (G) and Lorentzian (L) peak shape functions.
Computational methods
The charge transfer rate between two semiconductor molecules can be estimated in the framework of the semiclassical Marcus/Hush theory through the following equation:18 (1)
In this equation kB, T, λh/e, β and ΔGh/e‡ are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, reorganization energy, electronic coupling between molecular orbitals (transfer integral) and activation energy for charge transfer, given by: (2)where ΔGh/e is the driving force (site energy difference).20,21 For two equal molecules we have ΔGh/e equals zero and ΔGh/e‡ = λh/e/4. The subscripts h and e are associated to the hole and electron transfer process.
The intramolecular reorganization energy was estimated using the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the neutral and charged molecules.22,23 For the calculations we consider the donor polymer with 2 mers and use the B3LYP24 functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set due to the high concordance of the theoretical results and experimental measurements verified in ref. 25. It is known that the outer component of the reorganization energy (λs) is very small compared to the internal component due to the low static dielectric constant of organic molecules.26,27 Some studies neglect this parameter as a first approximation for condensed-state systems.28–30 In this work we add 36 meV to the intramolecular component to account for λs in the calculations, which is a physically plausible parameter for the external component.31,32
To obtain β we have to find the most stable configuration of the molecular complexes. For this we first obtain the ground state geometry of the isolated acceptor and donor polymer and afterwards redo a geometry optimization to find the most stable complex geometry. In this work we consider complexes of donor/donor and donor/acceptor. All energy minimization to find the most stable complex geometry was done with the ωb97XD33 functional that includes corrections to describe the influence of long-range dispersion forces, suitable for dealing with molecular complexes,34 in combination with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The electronic coupling, β, between the frontier molecular orbitals involved in the charge transition was obtained with the fragment orbital method15 implemented with the AOMix35,36 software. To obtain the absorption spectra of the most stable complex geometry we perform a TD-DFT calculation using the M0637 functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set according to previous works that showed a good agreement with experimental results.12,38–40 Finally we also calculate the intermolecular binding energy of the complexes, defined as the energy difference between the isolated fragments and the whole structure, a quantity related to the stability of the formed complexes.41
Results and discussion
When comparing the absorption spectra of PFO-DBT and PSiF-DBT films in Fig. 2, a red shift is observed for the PSiF-DBT film. This effect is related to a higher tendency for packing of Si-based copolymers. It was seen that the significantly longer C–Si bond than C–C bond can result in a decrease of steric hindrance between the side groups and the main chain,16 favoring packing of polymers. In Fig. 3 we present a comparison of the PFO-DBT and PSiF-DBT repeat units and observe that the C–Si bond is 0.37 Å longer than the C–C bond moving the side group away from the main chain. Another effect of the longer C–Si bond is to make the SiF group more linear and longer than the FO group.

In order to theoretically study whether the modification of the FO group with the addition of Si tends to approximate the polymer chains, we obtained the optimized geometry of the complexes involving two monomers. After that we scanned the total energy of the complex as a function of the distance between the centers of mass, see the results in Fig. 4. We found that both the complexes give very similar potential energy profile, but the energy minimum for the PSiF-DBT complex lies in a shorter distance compared to that of the PFO-DBT complex. This result shows that the significantly longer C–Si bond than C–C bond can really decrease the steric hindrance between the side groups and the main chain, which brings the polymeric chains closer together.

The absorption spectra of PFO-DBT and PSiF-DBT films have two well-defined maximums S1 and S2, as shown in Fig. 2. The PFO-DBT film has the S1 peak at 390 nm and S2 peak at 550 nm. The PSiF-DBT film shows the S1 peak at 400 nm and S2 peak at 570 nm. For both materials, the S1 peak can be attributed to the π–π* transition, while the S2 peak is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the copolymer donor unit, FO or SiF, and the copolymer acceptor unit, DBT.42,43 This behavior was also obtained for the theoretical result with TD-DFT calculations considering complexes involving two oligomers with two mers each (dashed lines in Fig. 2). We can see in Fig. 5 the main molecular orbitals contributing to the S1 and S2 electronic transitions. Note that for both the copolymers the S1 electronic transition occurs between delocalized molecular orbitals over both donor and acceptor units. In the case of S2 electronic transition, the unoccupied molecular orbitals are mainly located over the DBT unit, giving an ICT character to this band.
 Fig. 5  TD-DFT results of the main molecular orbitals contributing to the S1 and S2 electronic transitions for complexes involving two oligomers with two mers each of (a) PFO-DBT and (b) PSiF-DBT (isovalues 0.03). 
With the simulation of the molecular complexes, we can obtain other quantities that help in the interpretation of the experimental results, see Table 1. Our theoretical analysis showed that the PSiF-DBT complex has a superior intermolecular binding energy compared to that of PFO-DBT. This result is related to a higher tendency for packing of PSiF-DBT and explains the red shift in the absorption spectra (higher molecular orbital delocalization). We also found a much higher electronic coupling between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs), βH–H, for the PSiF-DBT complex. This makes the hole transfer rate, kh, one order of magnitude greater for PSiF-DBT, even though it had a slightly higher reorganization energy for hole transfer (λh) than that of PFO-DBT. These factors highlight the importance of the Si atom to induce a better packing along the π–π direction, which improves the light absorption and hole transport properties of the film.

Fig. 6 shows the AFM images of the films with PSiF-DBT (Fig. 3(bottom)) and PFO-DBT (Fig. 3(top)) deposited on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS. AFM images show a homogeneous appearance for both the PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT films. On the other hand, the PSiF-DBT film had a 34% higher mean square roughness compared to the PFO-DBT film.

The properties of the PFO-DBT and PSiF-DBT copolymers were investigated as an active layer in organic photovoltaic devices in the bilayer heterojunction structure (glass/ITO/PFO-DBT or PSiF-DBT/C60/Al), as shown in Fig. 1c. One may note that the cathode is simply aluminum evaporated at the same time for all the devices. It was chosen in order to decrease the number of interlayers, improving the methodology with fixed geometry for comparisons. These numbers are the average numbers of efficiencies reported in other studies.3,5Fig. 7a shows the J–V curves that represent the results of the devices and the comparison of the photovoltaic parameters is summarized in Table 2. In the inset of Fig. 7a it is possible to observe the J–V curves in the dark on a log–log scale. Note that mainly for high voltages in the dark, the devices using the PSiF-DBT presented the highest values of current density and this is related to better conditions for charge transport.

From Table 2 it is also possible to highlight that the PSiF-DBT devices exhibited a higher short circuit current density (JSC) than that in the PFO-DBT films implying a maximum power conversion efficiency of (η) 2.4% (29% higher compared to that of the PFO-DBT device). The current density values also agree with the IPCE (incident photon-to-current efficiency) curves of the devices, as shown in Fig. 7b. A wider spectrum was observed for the PSiF-DBT device, which may contribute to better photon collection and consequently interfere in the increase of JSC. Better performances have also been reported with other copolymers having a silicon atom in their chemical structures compared to their carbon atom analogs.16,17
This increase in JSC can be explained by the morphology of the films. As shown, the PSiF-DBT film exhibited a 34% higher roughness than the PFO-DBT film. Higher roughness can effectively increase the contact area of the donor material with the electron acceptor material and may improve the dissociation of the exciton.3 Therefore, as C60 fullerene used as an acceptor material may diffuse during the sublimation process, a higher roughness may increase the PSiF-DBT/C60 intermixed layer resulting in an increase in JSC and therefore performance of devices.
The results of electronic properties and photovoltaic response motivated us to conduct an investigation of the intrinsic properties of the polymers, using the NEXAFS technique, and through the simulation of D/A complexes it was possible to study the PSiF-DBT/C60 and PFO-DBT/C60 interfaces.
Angle-dependent NEXAFS spectra of PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT in both TEY and FY modes are depicted in Fig. 8. The spectra clearly show features corresponding to the transitions of thiophene and benzothiadiazole, whose assignments were already fully discussed in previous works.44 Besides, another strong feature is seen at about 2480 eV. Since PEDOT:PSS was used in the manufacturing of the thin films as the hole transport layer, this feature is assigned to S–O transitions of the PSS dopant.
 Fig. 8  TEY and FY NEXAFS spectra of PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT obtained at grazing and normal incident angles. 
NEXAFS spectra were obtained at two different incident angles, grazing and normal, in order to investigate the molecular ordering and orientation of the polymeric thin films. Since the transitions in thiophene and benzothiadiazole show a very weak dichroism, any specific molecular orientation cannot be suggested. The lack of ordering of the polymeric chains may be due to the presence of the PEDOT:PSS and/or the deposition method. One point to highlight here is that the energy region of the transitions of thiophene and benzothiadiazole is also the energy region expected for PEDOT, which is also a thiophene derivative. This may hinder proper analysis of the NEXAFS dichroism.
Although it was not possible to extract molecular orientation of the NEXAFS results, they bring further insights into the polymeric films. The spectra corresponding to PFO-DBT show higher content of PSS in both TEY and FY modes, bringing a more insulator character to the PFO-DBT thin film. NEXAFS spectra of PSiF-DBT in TEY mode also show a relevant contribution of PSS, but in the FY mode we can observe a drastic reduction of it coinciding with the increase of the copolymer features. Based on these observations, it can be suggested that the thin films of PSiF-DBT have a more conducting character in comparison with PFO-DBT thin films.
Sulfur KL2,3L2,3 Auger decay spectra were obtained for both PSiF-DBT and PFO-DBT at different photon energies to gain insight into electron transfer dynamics using the core–hole clock (CHC) method. This method was applied successfully in previous studies of PSiF-DBT,43,45 which was performed by considering the ratio between the spectator and the normal Auger signals multiplied by the sulfur 1s core–hole lifetime (1.27 fs).46Table 3 reports the calculated charge transfer delocalisation times for both copolymers obtained at different photon energies.

According to the calculated results, PSiF-DBT demonstrates a faster charge transfer process, indicating better electrical characteristics in comparison with PFO-DBT, to be applied in photovoltaic devices.
An interesting result of Table 2 is the higher VOC for devices with PSiF-DBT. In part this result can be related with the higher PL emission of PSiF-DBT film compared to that of its analog with a carbon atom (see Fig. 2). The higher PL emission of PSiF-DBT film indicates that the nonradiative decay rate of excited states is lower in this system.38,47 This is an advantage for application in photovoltaic devices to decrease the voltage losses.20 However, the driving force for charge transfer (ΔG) of the donor/acceptor blend can also influence VOC.48 Higher ΔG values can increase the voltage losses of the device.49 From the energy levels of the isolated materials it is possible to obtain ΔG. The driving force for electron transfer (ΔGe) can be obtained from the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the donor and acceptor materials. On the other hand, the driving force for hole transfer (ΔGh) can be obtained from the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and acceptor materials. The copolymers PFO-DBT and PSiF-DBT have the same HOMO energy of 5.40 eV, but different LUMO energies of 3.53 eV and 3.60 eV.50–52 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of C60 are equal to 6.35 eV and 4.10 eV, respectively.53,54 Therefore the PFO-DBT/C60 and PSiF-DBT/C60 blends have the same ΔGh of 0.95 eV, but different ΔGe of 0.57 eV and 0.50 eV, respectively. Note that for the PSiF-DBT/C60 blend ΔGe is 0.07 eV smaller compared to the PFO-DBT/C60 blend. This difference can decrease the voltage losses of the PSiF-DBT/C60 device and help explain its higher VOC energy.
We also simulate donor/acceptor complexes to obtain the electronic coupling between the LUMO of the donor copolymer (LUMOD) with the three low-lying LUMOs of C60 (LUMOA, LUMOA+1 and LUMOA+2), βL–L, βL–L+1 and βL–L+2, see Fig. 9 and Table 4. On average, the electronic coupling values obtained for the two complexes are similar. This result may be related to the fact that the LUMOD is mainly located in the DBT chemical group for the two copolymers. In this case, the interaction of the acceptor LUMOs with the LUMOD is not related to FO or SiF chemical groups. This shows that the charge transfer state is formed mainly by the interaction of C60 with the DBT group. The reorganization energy for electron transfer, λe, calculated for the two complexes are also very similar. Therefore, the magnitude of the energy barrier for electron transfer, ΔGe‡, and the Marcus/Hush electron transfer rate, ke (from the LUMOD to each of the three low-lying LUMOs of C60) will be defined by ΔGe of each blend. These parameters and the sum of ke for each electronic transition are presented in Table 4. The lower ΔGh/e‡ for the PSiF-DBT/C60 blend, related to its lower ΔGe, makes the sum of ke one order of magnitude greater for this blend compared to the result obtained for the PFO-DBT/C60 blend. This result shows that the electron transfer dynamics is faster at the PSiF-DBT/C60 interface compared to that at the PFO-DBT/C60 interface. Therefore, the major contributions to the difference in JSC (see Table 2) must be related to morphological effects in the donor layer that facilitate the charge transport as previously discussed and also to the difference in the electron transfer dynamics at the donor/acceptor interface.

Conclusions
Overall, the comparative study between the PFO-DBT copolymer and its silicon analog PSiF-DBT applied in bilayer organic solar cells showed the importance of the Si atom to increase the performance of the devices. We first observe that the change of a carbon atom by a silicon atom in the chemical structure induced a red shift in the absorption spectrum of the polymeric film. This behavior was also obtained for the theoretical result with TD-DFT calculations. Our theoretical analysis showed that the significantly longer C–Si bond than C–C bond can decrease the steric hindrance between the side groups and the main chain, bringing the polymeric chains closer together. This result is related to a higher tendency for packing along the π–π direction of PSiF-DBT, which provides a red shift of the absorption spectrum and better charge transport characteristics. Thus, an increase in device power conversion efficiency of approximately 29% was obtained when PFO-DBT was replaced by PSiF-DBT. Additional analysis through the core–hole clock method demonstrates a faster charge transfer process in PSiF-DBT, also indicating better electrical characteristics in comparison with PFO-DBT. Finally, with the energy level analysis and the simulation of D/A complexes it was possible to verify that voltage losses related to the driving force and the electron transfer dynamics in the interfaces of PSiF-DBT/C60 and PFO-DBT/C60 are different for both systems. Therefore, the major contributions to the difference in JSC must be related to morphological effects in the donor layer, which facilitate the charge transport and to the faster electron transfer rate at the PSiF-DBT/C60 interface compared to that at the PFO-DBT/C60 interface. From our analysis it was possible to provide important insights into how a small modification in the chemical structure of the copolymer led to changes in the performance of the photovoltaic device.
