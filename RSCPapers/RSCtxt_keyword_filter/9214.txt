    , Accepted 9th July 2012First published on 10th July 2012AbstractIn this communication, we report a simple method for a covalent band-forming reaction to change the hybridization of carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3, to introduce a band gap in pristine graphene. Graphene with well-defined functionality was synthesized, and the resulting material was soluble in organic solvent. The LUMO of functionalized graphene was below the LUMO of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and close to that of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), indicating its suitability as an electron acceptor for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications. We further show the P3HT/functionalized graphene composite as the active layer in a solar cell, with device efficiency of 1.1%.
Recently, organic photovoltaic devices have attracted attention in solar energy research, due to their unique features including light weight, high bendability and low cost.1–4 Especially the applications of graphene in organic photovoltaic devices are remarkable, for example as transparent electrodes,5–9 because of good flexibility, transparency and conductivity, and as active layer materials,10–16 owing to good optoelectronic properties. As a material consisting of a two-dimensional atomic layer of sp2 carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, graphene has emerged as a nanoscale material receiving tremendous attention due to its wide range of unique properties.17,18 In order to realize the many potential applications that graphene can offer, it is critically important to produce graphene with well-defined and controllable surface and interface properties. For pristine graphene, the valence and conduction bands touch at the Fermi level, and such zero band-gap structures cannot be effectively switched to a low conductance state and the application of a gate voltage produces small changes in the device output.19,20 Graphene band-gap engineering therefore becomes crucial. So far the research efforts have mainly focused on the use of lithographic methods to open a band gap in graphene, however the lithography process involves highly energetic electron beams, which have been shown to alter the intrinsic chemical structure of graphene.21 Therefore, employing chemical means to engineer a band gap into graphene becomes an appealing alternative.
Despite numerous studies on the properties and potential of graphene, robust chemical methods for producing functionalized graphene from pristine graphene are still attractive.22–25 The most common chemical method for functionalizing graphene is achieved by employing graphene oxide, which has good solubility and processability, and has already found application in electronic devices. For instance, because of its electron-transport properties, graphene oxide has been applied in organic photovoltaic cells as an electron acceptor.26 Nevertheless, the oxidation process produces various oxygen-containing species, the nature and density of which are difficult to control. This could potentially degrade the electronic properties of the materials, as well as leading to poor device reproducibility.
Because of the absence of reactive functional groups, covalent functionalization of pristine graphene poses considerable challenges. Covalent carbon–carbon bond forming reactions, on the other hand, can be used to change the hybridization of the carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3. This approach modifies the conjugation length of the delocalized carbon lattice, and has been shown as an effective way to introduce a band gap in single-walled carbon nanotubes.27,28
In this work, to achieve a covalent carbon–carbon bond formation reaction, the aryl diazonium salt reaction was chosen to graft the group of benzoic acid onto pristine graphene29–33 to improve the solubility and to open a band gap of the resultant graphene. The pristine graphene was prepared by exfoliation of graphite in the mixed solvent of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and toluene; however, due to intense sonication, it inevitably has defects as shown in the Raman spectra below.34 The graphene derivative, abbreviated as BCFG (graphene functionalized with benzoic acid), which was produced by pristine graphene functionalized with benzoic acid via the aryl diazonium salt reaction, was esterified with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-octanol to obtain the compound we expected, abbreviated as BCFG-F (BCFG esterified with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-octanol) shown in Scheme 1a. The detailed synthesis procedures and the FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectra) and TGA (Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer) characterization results of the compounds are provided in the ESI.† As shown as in Scheme 1b, BCFG shows very good dispersity in water, as seen in the left bottle, due to the introduction of the group of the carboxylic acid, while BCFG-F produced by esterification can be dispersed in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) instead of water, as shown in the right bottle (water in upper layer and DCB in lower layer).

The functionalized graphene was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements, as shown in Fig. 1a. The survey scan spectrum, which shows the presence of C and O atoms, was analyzed using casaXPS processing software. The C 1s spectra of FG shows three peaks centered at 284.6, 286.3 and 287.8, corresponding to the C–C, C–O, and CO bonds, respectively.35Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectra of few-layers pristine graphene (PG) and functionalized graphene (FG), respectively. Unfortunately, it is not able to identify single-layer graphene, which has a very sharp and symmetric band, likely due to aggregation of graphene.36 Nevertheless, by the position and shape of the 2D band37–40 it shows that the number of layers of PG and FG should be less than five. The D band is due to the A1g breathing vibrations of six-membered sp2 carbon rings and will become Raman active after the symmetry of the nearby lattice is reduced by introduction of defects or functionalities in graphitic materials. Hence the ratio of the D- and G-band intensities (ID/IG) is a useful index of the degree of functionalization.41,42 After the chemical reaction, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands, ID/IG, attributed to the increase in the number of isolated sp2 domains generated by the hybridization of the carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3 at functionalized places, increases from 0.5 to 0.85. UV-vis normalized absorption spectra of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and P3HT/BCFG-F blend with a ratio of 10 wt% (BCFG-F/P3HT) are depicted in Fig. 1c. It can be seen that the P3HT/BCFG-F composite film has almost the same absorption as that of pure P3HT film in the wavelength range of 350–650 nm, except that the absorption of the P3HT/BCFG-F composite film shows a slight red shift. The PL spectra of pure P3HT and P3HT/BCFG-F composite (10 wt% BCFG-F) films are also shown in Fig. 1d. It can be seen that the photoluminescence is remarkably reduced after the introduction of BCFG-F, showing that efficient charge transfer occurs along the P3HT/BCFG-F interface.26

The morphology of the BCFG-F films were further analyzed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2 shows typical tapping-mode AFM and TEM images of the BCFG-F film. The TEM image further confirms the existence of the BCFG-F sheet. The wrinkled BCFG-F sheets are also observed in Fig. 2a. The overlap and slight corrugations are due to the large aspect ratio of the BCFG-F.23 Moreover, the thickness of the BCFG-F sheet can be measured from the height profile of AFM image, as shown in Fig. 2b. The thickness value of 1.4 nm suggests that the sheet is a single layer of BCFG-F.24,35,43,44

In order to demonstrate the potential application of the new functionalized graphene (BCFG-F) in photovoltaic cells, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements45 to obtain the position of the LUMO and HOMO of BCFG-F (Fig. S3, ESI†). The LUMO position of BCFG-F is around −4.0 eV, which is below the LUMO of P3HT and close to that of PCBM, indicating its suitability as an electron-acceptor for OPV applications (details of fabrication of OPV are given in the ESI†). By utilizing the P3HT/BCFG-F mixture as the active layer, the hybrid solar cells were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) (40 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/Al (100 nm), as shown in Fig. 3a. For comparison, the solar cells of P3HT/BCFG-F with FG content of 5 wt%, 7.5 wt%, 10 wt% and 12.5 wt% (ratio to P3HT) were also fabricated, and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for these solar cells after annealing treatment (155 °C, 30 min) are shown in Fig. 3b.

The obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 1.

As shown as Table 1, there are different values of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for different BCFG-F contents in the P3HT/BCFG-F composites, with a peak value at the BCFG-F content of 10 wt% in the composite. In order to realize the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the BCFG-F content, we investigated the surface morphology of the P3HT/BCFG-F composite films with different BCFG-F contents, 5 wt%, 10 wt% and 15 wt%, by the use of atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4.

In the P3HT/BCFG-F composite film containing 5 wt% BCFG-F, only a few functionalized graphene sheets can be seen embedded in the P3HT matrix. Therefore, for low BCFG-F content, it can not form enough P3HT/BCFG-F interfaces, at which the separation of excitons occurs, and continuous pathways in the P3HT matrix for the effective electron transport.46 In the composite film with 10 wt% BCFG-F there are more graphene sheets than in the film with 5 wt% and they are well dispersed in the P3HT matrix, to form abundant P3HT/BCFG-F interfaces for charge generation and interpenetrating networks. For the film of the composite with a BCFG-F content of 15 wt%, the morphology of this film demonstrates great agglomerates formed by aggregated graphene sheets, which could have a deleterious effect on exciton separation and charge transport in the active layer.11,14,16,26 So, with the optimized BCFG-F concentration, a peak value of PCE can be obtained at 10 wt% BCFG-F in the P3HT matrix.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a method to change the hybridization of the carbon atoms from sp2 to sp3 to introduce a suitable band gap into pristine graphene. The functionalized graphene materials exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, making their manipulation very easy. The interaction between the functionalized graphene and P3HT makes this composite work well as the active layer in bulk heterojunction polymeric solar cells. Controlled BCFG-F concentration in graphene/P3HT composite can improve the OPV device performance, and a best power conversion efficiency of 1.1% was obtained.
