    , Accepted 17th March 2014First published on 17th March 2014AbstractWith the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells (PSCs) approaching the milestone value of 10%, their instability associated with a low work function metal cathode, particularly in the presence of oxygen and moisture, becomes a critical issue for real applications. To alleviate the air-sensitive problem, two easy-accessible solution-processed, environmentally friendly organic small-molecule cathode interlayers, with perylene diimides (PDI) as the core and amino (PDIN) or amino N-oxide (PDINO) as the terminal substituent, are explored. Benefitting from the extended planar structure of the PDI units, the two interlayer materials show high conductivities of ∼10−5 S cm−1, which make them capable of functioning efficiently in a wide thickness range of 6 to 25 nm. This is the first time that thickness-insensitive small-molecule-based cathode interlayers are reported. It is also found that the work function tuning effect of the two PDI-based interlayers allows high work function metals (such as Au and Ag) to act as the cathode. With the conventional device structure with PTB7 as a donor and PC70BM as an acceptor, the PDINO-based devices exhibit an efficiency of 8.24% with Al as the top electrode and 8.16% with Ag as the top electrode, much higher than that of the corresponding Ca/Al-based device (6.98%). The high efficiency of 8.35% is also achieved in the device with PTB7-Th as the donor. The success of the two PDI-interlayers indicates that π-delocalized planar structures with high electron affinities could be particularly useful in developing high-performance organic interlayer materials.

Broader context
Nowadays, developing solution-processed stable organic cathode interlayers (to replace the active metal cathode and enhance the device stability) is an important topic in the field of organic solar cells. A number of efficient organic cathode interlayers have already been reported, however they are generally very thickness-sensitive (usually less than 10 nm). The thickness-sensitive problem excludes their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology, which is required for low-cost flexible organic solar cells. It is thus highly desirable to find thickness-insensitive organic cathode interlayers. In this paper, for the first time thickness-insensitive small-molecule-based cathode interlayers are reported. Notably, the two solution-processed cathode interlayers we designed and developed here are easy-accessible using environmentally friendly reagents, and they exhibit promising performances in photovoltaic applications.

1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the photoactive layer of the conjugated polymer donor and the fullerene acceptor can be fabricated on light-weight flexible plastic substrates, and are promising in providing low-cost green energy in the future.1 With the power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching the milestone value of 10%,2 their instability, particularly in the presence of oxygen and moisture, becomes a critical issue for real applications. For the standard device geometry of PSCs, the active layer is normally sandwiched between transparent indium tin oxide (ITO), coated with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (as the bottom anode), and low work function metals (normally Ca/Al) (as the top cathode), which are very chemically active in air. In order to alleviate the air-sensitive problem associated with such cathodes,3 a number of n-type metal oxides (e.g., ZnO, TiO2, and CsCO3) have been used as cathode interlayers to replace Ca (inserted between the photoactive layer and the less air-sensitive cathode),2g,4 they can also function as a hole blocking layer, an optical spacer and a self-encapsulation layer. However, these inorganic interlayers could have poor interfacial contact with the organic active layer, which will result in poor electron extraction. Thus finding solution-processed organic interlayers become an important issue in the field of organic solar cells.5
Organic interlayers include polymer-based ones and small-molecule-based ones. The latter ones are more attractive because of their several intrinsic advantages over the conjugated polymer counterpart in terms of easy purification, monodispersity, and well-defined structures without end group contaminants and better batch-to-batch reproducibility. Various small-molecule-interlayers have already been explored with the most prominent success of fullerene derivatives.6–17 For example, fullerenes functionalized with different polar groups of amino,7,8 ammonium salt,6,8,9 phosphonate,10 fluorinated alkyl11 and poly(ethylene glycol)10,12 have been successfully designed. Fullerenes containing thermal13 or electro-14 crosslinkable groups have also been used as efficient cathode interlayers. Other successful small-molecular interlayers are rhodamine with inner salt,15 quinacridone tethered with sodium sulfonate16 and triphenylamine–fluorene core featuring a phosphonate side chain.17 These interlayers proved comparable to or even better than the conventional Ca interlayer. However, induced by their low conductivities they are very sensitive to thickness and only work well at a critical ultrathin thickness (less than 10 nm).6–9 Moreover, they either contain counter-anions (which would migrate in the device and hence damage the device performance) or are complex in synthesis. This motivates us to explore high-conductivity, counter-anion free and environmentally friendly small-molecule cathode interlayer materials.
Herein, we report two perylene diimide (PDI) derivative cathode interlayers, differing only in the presence of either amino (PDIN) or amino N-oxide (PDINO) terminal substituent (Fig. 1b). The exploration of perylene diimides as the central core is inspired by their several fascinating properties, such as photochemical stability, high electron affinities, easy functionalization and high conductivities.18 Especially, the high conductivity benefitted from their self-organized π-stacks in solid could overcome the thickness limitation (usually less than 10 nm) of current reported organic interlayers, which excludes their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing where certain thickness variation is unavoidable. The insensitivity of the interlayer thickness to the photovoltaic performance could also provide feasible optical field modulation to maximize the light-harvesting capabilities of the active layer. To carry out our design concept, two PDIs, as outlined in Fig. 1b, were selected as model compounds for such investigations. Two counter-anion free polar groups, amino and amino N-oxide,19 are introduced to the PDI core via facile synthesis procedures with high yields using easily available, inexpensive and eco-friendly reagents (Fig. 1b).

Moreover, the PDI devices also perform well when high work function (WF) metals (such as Au and Ag) are used as cathodes.

2. Results and discussion
Physicochemical properties
The two PDIs are alcohol soluble, while PDIN needs the assistance of acetic acid (2% in volume). Both PDIs are insoluble in chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, which is very important for multilayer-device fabrication. Their physicochemical properties are collected in Table 1 and their absorption spectra are provided in Fig. 1c. In methanol, the absorption spectra of PDIN and PDINO are dominated by characteristic π–π* transitions and resemble with each other. While in solid films, their absorptions are broadened with more prominent redshift for PDINO, suggesting a lower optical bandgap. Based on the onset reduction potential (−0.80 V, Fig. 1d), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PDIN and PDINO are estimated respectively to be −3.63 eV and −3.72 eV.21 The LUMOs of these two PDIs are very close to those of PCBM and PC70BM (about −3.85 eV),7 which could smoothly bridge electrons to transport from the fullerene acceptor to the cathode side. From the onset oxidation potential (Fig. 1d), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PDIN and PDINO are estimated to be −6.05 eV and −6.21 eV, respectively. These low-lying HOMOs are sufficiently low to block holes from various donors.5d

The primary requirement of interlayers lies in their ability to produce large interfacial dipoles that induce a vacuum-level shift which can modify the WF of the electrode.4b To test this, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to probe the electronic properties of PDI-interlayers. Fig. 2c displays the results of UPS measurements on a series of electrodes with different work function φ, namely Al (φ = 4.3 eV), Ag (φ = 4.3 eV) and Au (φ = 5.1 eV). After deposition of an ultrathin layer (5 nm) of PDIs, for the Al electrode, the WF is always pinned at 3.5 eV, irrespective of the PDI-interlayer deposited. While for Au and Ag electrodes, their WFs depend on the nature of the deposited PDI-interlayer. That is, PDIN treated electrodes show a WF of 3.93 eV, while for the PDINO treated electrodes, the WFs are pinned at 3.60 eV. The difference in WF between the two PDI treated electrodes is related to the polar nature of the terminal polar group and it suggests that amino N-oxide derivatives can provide larger dipole moment than the amine group does. The low WF values of PDI/electrodes (about 3.60–3.93 eV) allow them to form ohmic contacts with the fullerene acceptor.4 The lowered WFs of PDI/metal cathodes also increase the built-in field used to break the electrical symmetry inside of the cells (as shown schematically in Fig. 2b), beneficial to charge extraction efficiency and reduce recombination losses. These results encouraged us to explore the PDIs as cathode interlayers with high WF metals (Ag and Au).
The effect of the PDI-interlayer was first evaluated using Al as the top electrode with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC70BM/PDI-interlayer/Al (Fig. 1a). The optimal thicknesses were found to be 14 nm for PDIN and 10 nm for PDINO. For PDINO-based devices, the highest PCE we obtained is 8.24%, which is nearly two times higher than that (4.44%) of the Al-only device (device with an Al cathode without any interlayer). Notably, this value is even significantly higher than the value (6.98%) of the Ca/Al device (standard device with the Ca/Al cathode) (see Fig. 3a and Table 2). Compared to the Ca/Al device (Fig. 3a and Table 2), the remarkable improvement in PCE is a result of a simultaneous increase of JSC (from 14.5 mA cm−2 to 15.00 mA cm−2), FF (from 67.67% to 73.30%) and most notably VOC (from 0.712 V to 0.749 V). The PDIN/Al device also exhibits good performance: a VOC of 0.755 V, a JSC of 14.29 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.23% and a noticeable PCE of 7.68%.

To better understand the VOC increase in the PDI based devices (compared to the Ca/Al device), various device parameters, including saturation current density (Jo) and ideality factor (n), were extracted from the dark J–V curve based on the equivalent circuit (Fig. S1†).22 With pristine Al as the electrode, the low built-in field results in serious carrier accumulation and severe carrier recombination inside the cell, thus leading to large saturation current density Jo (in the order of 10−5 mA cm−2).4 When low WF Ca is used as the cathode, the built-in field is largely increased, thereby carrier accumulation and recombination are greatly suppressed, leading to three orders of magnitude reduction in the Jo value (in the order of 10−8 mA cm−2). However, carrier traps resulted from damage by the hot Ca atoms during thermal evaporation are unavoidable, which can catch carriers and cause carrier accumulation and carrier recombination.4 For the solution-processed PDI-interlayers, such traps can be greatly reduced, thus carrier accumulation and recombination are further suppressed, leading to a further reduction in Jo (in the order of 10−9 mA cm−2) by one order of magnitude.
Another possible reason for the lowered Jo value is the hole blocking effect of the PDI-interlayer, which forms electron selective contact with the active blend layer.5d,7 Here, such hole blocking effect induced carrier selectivity can greatly benefit FF,23 and is originated from their deep HOMO energy levels (below −6.0 eV), which is about 0.5 eV lower than that of PTB7 (−5.15 eV).20 According to the well-known equation22 of VOC ≈ (nKT/q)ln(JSC/J0), lower J0 is beneficial to larger VOC, thus the increase in VOC of the PDI-interlayer device is quite understandable. The calculated VOC values based on the above equation are given in Table 2, it is seen that their variation trend is in good agreement with that of the measured VOC.
We further examined the effect of the PDI-interlayer thickness on the performance of the PSCs. The main drawback of increasing the interlayer thickness is that it will inevitably increase the bulk resistance of the interlayer, which is detrimental to electron extraction and hence the device performance. Interestingly, the performance of the PDI-based PSC is not that sensitive to the PDI-interlayer thickness, especially for the PDINO interlayer. For example, the optimized PDINO interlayer thickness (10 nm) yields a peak PCE value of 8.24% with a low series resistance Rs of 3.37 Ω cm2 (Table 3 and Fig. 3c). When the PDINO interlayer thickness is increased to 25 nm, the series resistance Rs is only slightly increased to 4.25 Ω cm2, and the PCE still maintains at a high value of 8.05%. For PDIN, although its performance is not as prominent as PDINO, at a quite large thickness of 25 nm a respective PCE of 7.15% (FF = 68.12%) is still achieved, which is very close to the peak value of 7.68% (FF = 71.23%) at an optimal thickness of 14 nm (Table 3 and Fig. 3d).

To explain this interesting phenomenon, the conductivities of PDINO and PDIN were measured (Fig. S2†). The measured conductivity of PDIN is 0.8 × 10−5 S cm−1 and that of PDINO is 7.6 × 10−5 S cm−1. It is worth noting that benefitting from their extended planar structure of the PDI units, the conductivities of the two PDI-interlayers are nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of the well-known cathode interlayer PFN (6.9 × 10−9 S cm−1, polyfluorene tethered with an amino group).5f The high conductivity can also account for the observed low Rs values and high FF values of these two-PDI based devices (see Table 3),24 with more prominent performance for PDINO-based devices due to the higher conductivity of PDINO, which is also the reason for their less performance dependence on the PDI-interlayer thickness (Table 3). Notably, upon variation of the PDI-interlayer thickness, the optical space effect might weigh in. However understanding such an effect and the effect of the interlayer absorption is outside the scope of current work and will be discussed later.
To better understand the importance of the high conductivity of the PDI-interlayers, a controlled experiment was carried out on the PFN treated devices for comparison (Fig. S3†). With an optimized PFN thickness of 5 nm, the PFN-based device exhibits a PCE of 7.40% with a VOC of 0.749 V and a FF of 66.43%. While at a PFN interlayer thickness of 25 nm, serious S-shaped kinks can be clearly seen in the J–V curve, which gives a severely degraded FF of 23.39% and a much deteriorated PCE of 2.35%. The S-shaped J–V curve is related to the carrier accumulation effect, and it is common in devices with low-conductivity interlayers when the interlayer thickness is beyond its optimal value, which can significantly enhance the series resistance Rs. This is evidenced by about a 50-fold increase in series resistance Rs when the PFN thickness is increased from 5 nm to 25 nm (5.70 Ω cm2 for the 5 nm PFN treated device and 289.18 Ω cm2 for the 25 nm PFN treated device). During preparation of this manuscript, we noticed an interesting report of a Hg-containing polymer as an efficient cathode interlayer.25 Benefitting from its metal–metal interaction, good device performance was achieved over a wide range of interlayer thickness.25 Our results here suggest that thickness-insensitive cathode interlayers can also be realized without using such a toxic metal-containing polymer: just developing π-delocalized planar structures with high electron affinities (such as perylene diimide used here) to promote π-orbital interaction and hence to achieve high conductivity.
Furthermore, metals with high WFs (Au and Ag) were also used to replace Al as the top cathode. The J–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. S4† and the device parameters are collected in Table 4. All the devices with the PDI interlayers demonstrate excellent photovoltaic properties with PCE values over 7.0% (Table 4). Despite the large difference in WF, VOC values of Au-based devices (0.747 V for PDINO and 0.756 V for PDINO) and Ag-based devices (0.758 V for PDINO and 0.734 V for PDINO) are actually very close. These VOC values are higher than the Ca/Al device (0.712 V). Notably, with Ag as the top electrode, a high PCE over 8.0% is achieved for the PDINO-based device (FF = 71.35%), indicative of the great potential of the two PDI-interlayers in PSCs.

With the success of PDINO as CBL in the PTB7 system, we further tested its performance in the PTB7-Th system (with thiophene side chains on the PTB7 backbone, the structure is also provide in Fig. 2a). Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the investigated devices: the Ca/Al device and the PDINO/Al device. The Ca/Al device exhibits a PCE of 7.52% with a JSC of 15.39 mA cm−2, while the PDINO/Al device performs much better with a PCE of 8.36% and a JSC of 15.45 mA cm−2. Such a significant improvement in the PCE is induced by the simultaneous increase of VOC (0.740 V to 0.800 V) and FF (66.0% to 67.6%). The incident-photon-to-converted-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two devices are shown in Fig. 4b. It is seen that the PDINO/Al device shows a higher IPCE value, which is consistent with the value obtained from J–V curves.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, two easy-accessible organic small-molecule cathode interlayers, with perylene diimides as the core and amino (PDIN) or amino N-oxide (PDINO) as the terminal substituent, are developed for high performance PSCs. Their high conductivities, appropriate energy levels and work function tuning effects make the PSCs work well on a wide range of interlayer thickness, especially for PDINO-based devices. For PTB7 based devices, prominent PCEs as high as 8.05–8.24% are achieved within a wide range of the PDI-interlayer thickness (10–25 nm), much higher than that of the Al-only device (4.43%) and the Ca/Al device (6.98%). The two PDI cathode-interlayers also allow high work function metals (such as Au and Ag) to act as efficient cathodes. A high efficiency of 8.35% is also achieved in the PTB7-Th system. The success of the two PDI-interlayers indicates that amino or amino N-oxide group functionalized imides bearing π-delocalized planar structures could be particularly useful in developing high-performance organic interlayer materials. The specific properties of PDI-interlayers might also make them potential candidates as electrode modification layers in solution-processed inorganic–organic hybrid photovoltaic devices.
4. Experimental
Characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 or Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were carried out on a flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation, in a 0.1 mol L−1 acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode.

Synthesis of PDINO. 
To a stirred suspension of PDIN26 (200 mg, 0.356 mmol) in 50 mL ethanol, 0.36 mL H2O2 (30 percent, 3.56 mmol) was added dropwise under the protection of an argon atmosphere. And this reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min followed by refluxing for 3 h until the solution became clear. After cooling to room temperature, solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The purple residue was then further purified by washing sequentially with acetone and hexane each three times, and the powder product (190 mg) was obtained with a yield of 90%.

Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) was deposited through spin-coating on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass with a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 2000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air, then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layer of the polymer and fullerene derivative was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. For PTB7:PC70BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin coating with ODCB solution containing 10 mg mL−1 PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 PC70BM. 1,8-Diiodooctane with a 3% volume ratio was added to the ODCB solutions and stirred before use. To optimized the interlayer thickness, methanol solution of PDIs at varied concentrations (from 0.5 mg mL−1 to 5 mg mL−1) was then deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, top electrodes were deposited in a vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device was 4.4 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source-Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G solar spectrum filter was used as the light source, and the optical power was 100 mW cm−2. The thickness of the interlayer was determined using a Profilometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2), in combination with extrapolation from an absorbance–thickness curve that assumed a linear dependence of absorbance at 468 nm for PDIN and 480 for PDINO on the film thickness. The bulk resistance of samples (R) was calculated from Ohm's law: R = V/I, with at least five separate measurements made for each sample.

Broader context
Nowadays, developing solution-processed stable organic cathode interlayers (to replace the active metal cathode and enhance the device stability) is an important topic in the field of organic solar cells. A number of efficient organic cathode interlayers have already been reported, however they are generally very thickness-sensitive (usually less than 10 nm). The thickness-sensitive problem excludes their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology, which is required for low-cost flexible organic solar cells. It is thus highly desirable to find thickness-insensitive organic cathode interlayers. In this paper, for the first time thickness-insensitive small-molecule-based cathode interlayers are reported. Notably, the two solution-processed cathode interlayers we designed and developed here are easy-accessible using environmentally friendly reagents, and they exhibit promising performances in photovoltaic applications.
