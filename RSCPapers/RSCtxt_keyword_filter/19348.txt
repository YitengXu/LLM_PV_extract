    , Accepted 18th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractExtensive progress has been made in electrocatalytic water splitting technologies powered by direct electricity or solar cells. However, obtaining electric energy from the power grid or sunlight with intermittent nature will inevitably lead to external energy loss and limit the operation of water splitting. Therefore, a novel energy system that uses only clean solar energy to produce H2 while overcoming the restrictions of intermittent sunlight is highly desirable. In this work, trifunctional Co0.85Se/NC catalysts have been synthesized, exhibiting promising OER, ORR and HER performance. On the basis of Co0.85Se/NC catalysts, a self-powered energy system was constructed through connecting a silicon solar cell, zinc–air batteries and a water splitting device to achieve significant H2 generation. The energy source of the whole system is solar energy. A zinc–air battery is charged by a solar cell for power storage during the day, and discharges consistently to provide a steady power supply for water splitting at night. Simultaneously, water splitting can also be driven directly by solar energy, which ensures uninterrupted power supply for efficient H2 generation, eliminating sunlight intermittency. The conversion efficiency of the solar-to-water splitting device and solar-to-H2 is 5.36% and 4.34%, respectively. This work presents a novel and intriguing approach to green renewable energy generation, as well as energy conversion and storage.
1. Introduction
In view of the growing demand for energy and increasing awareness of environmental pollution, the development of clean and sustainable energy and renewable technologies is urgent.1,2 Hydrogen energy has the characteristics of high energy density, environmental protection and no-pollution, which is believed to be an alternative energy to traditional fossil fuels.3,4 Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting, involving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), has the advantages of a clean process, abundant resources and high hydrogen production, which is recognized as an ideal route to produce hydrogen and solve the problem of sustainable energy development.5,6 Significant progress has been made in electrocatalytic water splitting techniques driven by direct electrification. However, getting electricity from the grid is both energy-consuming and uneconomical.7,8 In recent years, renewable energy power generation such as solar energy has gradually become a large-scale power generation technology. Some studies have reported the use of solar energy to drive electrocatalytic water splitting through solar cells.9–11 However, it currently requires connections to complex energy storage devices and relies heavily on light, which is time-limited. In this regard, the design of a new energy-efficient power generation energy system for hydrogen production from water splitting is significant, which is expected to be driven entirely by solar power to overcome the intermittency of the optical duration. Zinc–air batteries (ZABs), as a promising energy storage and conversion device, have attracted extensive attention based on attractive features including environmental friendliness, safety and high theoretical specific energy for obtaining free oxygen from the natural atmosphere.12–15 ZABs can realize a cyclic charging and discharging process, involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively, which means that it could be considered as both an energy storage and an energy supply. Considering the overpotentials for the OER and HER, the required voltage of the electrocatalytic water splitting process is 1.5–2.3 V, which can be driven by two ZABs in series.16,17 Therefore, ZABs can be considered as an intermediary energy system that can convert solar energy into electricity during the day and release electricity to drive water splitting at night, thus taking full advantage of intermittent sunlight and eliminating sunlight limitation. The only power source in the entire system is natural solar power, which is energy efficient and environmentally friendly.
In order to facilitate the stable and efficient operation of the novel system described above, electrocatalysts with HER, OER and ORR functional catalytic activity and stability are urgently required. To date, Pt-based precious metal catalysts have been believed to be highly active for the ORR and HER, while Ir- and Ru-based oxides are very efficient for the OER.18–20 However, the limited reserves and high costs of noble metal catalysts preclude their practical application in renewable energy technologies.18,21 Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative catalysts with earth-abundant reserves and satisfactory trifunctional activity for the OER, ORR and HER. Therefore, the exploration of alternative catalysts with earth-abundant reserves and satisfactory trifunctional activity for the OER, ORR and HER is highly desirable. In recent years, transition metals (i.e. Fe, Co, Ni or Cu) and their derivatives (i.e. transition metal hydro/oxides, sulfides, and carbides) have received great attention as promising alternatives to precious metals, on account of their cost-effectiveness, abundant reserves, and unique electronic properties.22–24 Among them, transition metal selenides possess similar structures to the corresponding sulfides, but have higher electrical conductivity, which can provide accelerated electron-transfer kinetics of electrocatalysis.25–27 Moreover, it has been reported that selenides have lower H-desorption bond energies compared to the corresponding sulfides, making them great candidates for HER electrocatalysts.26,28 At the same time, selenides also show promising intrinsic catalytic ability for the OER,27 and Tan et al. reported the presence of localized negative charge at the Se site, and that the electronegativity of selenium is smaller than that of O element.26,29 In addition, the ORR properties of selenides have been reported. Gui et al.27 have reported Co0.85Se particles embedded in carbon nanofibers, which display promising ORR activity, comparable to Pt/C catalysts. Among transition metal selenides, cobalt selenide has a variety of crystal morphologies and characteristics, including CoSe2, Co3Se4, Co0.85Se, CoSe, and Co9Se8, among which CoSe2 and Co0.85Se have been widely studied in electrochemical reactions in recent years.30–33 Significantly, the valence of Co has been reported to play a major role in the activity and conductivity for selenide electrocatalysts.34 It has been reported that Co3+ with octahedral and square symmetric intermediate spins is regarded as an active site for the catalytic OER on account of the low coordination number of H2O molecules and the large adsorption energy.35 Xu et al.36 implied that the ORR performance of cobalt selenides was related to the amount and activity of Co3+ exposed on the surface. In this regard, it is very necessary and meaningful to explore the trifunctional catalytic activities of cobalt-based selenides with different configurations and understand the reactive active sites, which also promotes the application of selenides in electrocatalysis fields.
Herein, ultrafine cobalt selenide particles (Co0.85Se/NC and CoSe2/NC) uniformly distributed on nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets were prepared through simple one-step selenylation-carbonization methods and display a large specific surface area, more exposed active sites and an accelerated charge transfer process. Profiting from abundant high oxidation state Co species, Co0.85Se/NC achieves superior electrocatalytic OER performance, which also exhibits considerable ORR and HER activity. As a result, based on trifunctional Co0.85Se/NC collaborated electrocatalysts, a two-electrode water splitting electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.70 V with a faradaic efficiency of 98%, while the assembled liquid ZAB also displays a maximum power density of 108 mW cm−2, as well as robust durability. Remarkably, a novel self-powered energy system was proposed and successfully constructed to sustainably extract H2, which integrates water splitting devices, ZABs and silicon solar cells, with a solar-to-overall water splitting efficiency of 5.36% and solar-to-H2 conversion efficiency of 4.34%. In this system, the energy source to drive the water splitting comes entirely from solar energy, and through storing the electricity converted from solar energy by the ZAB, the H2 production can be achieved without the limitation of intermittent sunlight, so as to achieve energy and material recycling. This novel energy system based on trifunctional electrocatalysts offers a promising avenue for the development of renewable energy and clean fuels.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis

2.1.1 Synthesis of Co0.85Se/NC. 
Co0.85Se/NC was prepared via a simple one-step pyrolysis process without any surfactants. Briefly, 5 g g-C3N4 and 1 ml aniline were added into 100 ml HCl (1 mol l−1) solution with stirring under an ice bath for 30 min. At the same time, another solution was obtained through adding 1.5 g ammonium persulfate in 30 ml HCl (1 mol l−1) under an ice bath. Then, solutions were completely mixed and stirred for 12 hours. In addition, 1.0 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Se powder and the obtained product were added into 30 ml of deionized water. The prepared product was collected by using a water bath at 100 °C until the solvent was completely volatilized. Co0.85Se/NC samples were finally prepared after the calcination in a N2 atmosphere of the as-obtained product at 900 °C for 3 h.


2.1.2 Synthesis of CoSe2/NC. 
The above obtained Co0.85Se/NC and Se powder were placed in the same ceramic boat with a mass ratio of 1:3, and calcined for 2 h at 400 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, where Se powder was placed upstream. The resulting product is named CoSe2/NC.


2.1.3 Synthesis of CoO/NC. 
The CoO/NC sample was synthesized by a similar procedure to Co0.85Se/NC, without the addition of Se powder.

2.2 Physical characterization
The microstructure was evaluated by microstructure field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Jeol JSM-7800 and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a Jeol JEM-2800. A Rigaku Smart Lab 3 kW was employed to collect the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome Nova 2000e sorption instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using a standard three-electrode system on a WaveDriver 20 Bipotentiostat/Galvanostat (Pine Research Instrumentation, USA), with a graphitic rod and Ag/AgCl serving as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 5 mg catalyst was added into 980 μl of mixed solution containing isopropyl alcohol/deionized water (v/v = 4:1) with 20 μl Nafion. Next, 10 μl ink was added dropwise onto a glass carbon disk (GCD) electrode, with a loading mass of 0.25 mg cm−2. Measured potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) was calibrated with a reversible hydrogen electrode according to E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH.
As for oxygen evolution reaction measurements, all linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves were obtained in 1.0 M KOH after iR compensation. The electrical double layer capacitance (Cdl) values were calculated in terms of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at different scan rates from 10 to 20 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a Zahner IM6eX with an amplitude of 5 mV.
As for oxygen reduction reaction measurements, CV tests were executed in O2- and N2-saturated solutions. LSV tests were conducted under 1600 rpm. The electron transfer number (n) for the ORR was obtained through executing LSV tests at rotating speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm, in accordance with the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation: 1/J = 1/JK + 1/JL = 1/JK + 1/Bω1/2(1)where J, JK and JL are the measured current density, kinetic current density, and diffusion limiting current density, respectively. ω is the rotation speed. B is determined from the slope of the K–L plots based on the Levich equation as given below: B = 0.2nFCo(Do)2/3ν−1/6(2)where F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1). The bulk concentration (CO) and diffusion coefficient (DO) of dissolved O2 are determined to be 1.21 × 10−6 mol cm−3 and 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, respectively. v is the solution viscosity (0.01 cm2 s−1). The constant 0.2 is adopted when the rotation speed is expressed in rpm.
Through rotation ring-disk electrode (RRDE) tests, hydrogen peroxide yields (HO2−%) and n were calculated, following the equations below: HO2−% = 200Ir/(IdN + Ir)(3) n = 4Id/(Id + Ir/N)(4)where Ir is the ring current density and Id is the disk current density. The current collection efficiency of the Pt ring (N) is determined to be 0.37.
As for hydrogen evolution reaction measurements, all the LSV polarization measurements were carried out under 1600 rpm with a scan rate of 5 mA s−1, in an electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH.
The overall water splitting properties were investigated using a two-electrode construction. A liquid zinc–air battery was constructed with carbon paper coated with catalysts, and the electrolyte is 6.0 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2 mixed solution.
3. Results and discussion
3 1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic process of Co0.85Se/NC is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. First, polyaniline coated g-C3N4 (g-C3N4@PANI) was fabricated by a facile low-temperature polymerization process, in which ammonium persulfate served as the initiator to induce the self-polymerization of aniline, and g-C3N4 was used as the template to enable the polyaniline to form a porous carbon nanosheet structure. Then, the nitrates of cobalt and selenium powder were introduced into g-C3N4@PANI. The polymer was subsequently pyrolyzed at 900 °C, undergoing a carbonization-selenization process. During high-temperature pyrolysis, with the decomposition of the self-sacrificing template of g-C3N4 accompanied by the improved porosity, the polyaniline was converted to well-developed porous N-doped carbon nanosheets. Meanwhile, the selenium powder was transformed into selenium vapor, reacting with cobalt ions, which promotes the uniform distribution of cobalt selenide particles in the N-doped carbon matrix.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of Co0.85Se/NC and CoSe2/NC. 
To investigate the morphology and microstructure of the prepared catalysts, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. As is shown in the SEM images (Fig. 1a and b), Co0.85Se/NC presents an interconnected nanosheet structure accompanied by uniform dispersion of nanoparticles. From TEM images (Fig. 1c and d), ultrathin corrugated nanosheets with a porous structure are also observed, in which ultrafine metal nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed. Such a structure would provide sufficient active sites and a large accessible active area, resulting in enhancing catalytic activity and reaction kinetics. The dark-field scanning TEM (DF-STEM) (Fig. 1f) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 1g) disclose the uniform distribution of C and N elements in the matrix. Besides, there is a high spatial correlation between Co and Se elements in the particles, manifesting the formation of cobalt selenide on the N-doped carbon matrix.

The crystalline nature of the prepared catalysts was investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD). From Fig. 2a, according to PDF #48-1719, the main diffraction peaks at 33.3°, 44.7°, 50.1°, 60.4° and 61.9° are indexed to the crystal planes of (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112), which match well with the structure of Co0.85Se shown in Fig. 2b. And the weak signal peak at 42.4° is attributed to CoO (PDF #48-1719), maybe due to the presence of incomplete selenylation or partial surface oxidation of samples. In order to investigate the effect of Co valence states in selenides on electrocatalytic activity, a CoSe2/NC sample was prepared through a re-selenization process of Co0.85Se/NC. From the XRD pattern of CoSe2/NC (Fig. 2a), obvious peaks are indexed to the CoSe2 phase (PDF #09-0234), and SEM images also show a stacked nanosheet structure, similar to that of Co0.85Se/NC, in which CoSe2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed (Fig. S1†). In addition, in order to highlight the role of metal selenides, the oxides commonly used in electrocatalytic reactions were also prepared for comparison. A CoO/NC sample was synthesized without the addition of Se powder, where only the CoO phase exists, as observed from the XRD pattern (Fig. 2a). As for the NC sample, the broad peak located at around 26° is attributed to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon (Fig. 2a). Both CoO/NC (Fig. S2†) and NC (Fig. S3†) samples also exhibit an ultrathin nanosheet structure similar to that of Co0.85Se/NC.

(e) Co 2p XPS high-resolution spectra of Co0.85Se/NC and CoSe2/NC. (f) Se 3d XPS high-resolution spectra of Co0.85Se/NC and CoSe2/NC. 
According to N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S4†), Co0.85Se/NC displays a graded porous structure with a specific surface area of 302 m2 g−1, calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. This hierarchical porous structure with a large specific surface area can facilitate electrolyte infiltration, reactant diffusion and product escape. The surface chemical composition and electronic structure of the developed catalysts were further detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S5†) reveals the existence of C, N, O, Se and Co elements in Co0.85Se/NC, with an atomic content of 80.98 at%, 6.54 at%, 7.68 at%, 1.90 at%, and 2.90 at%, respectively. As shown in the detailed C 1s spectra of Co0.85Se/NC (Fig. 2c), there are three peaks situated at 284.8, 285.5 and 286.5 eV, belonging to C–C, N–C/NC and OCO bonds, respectively.37,38 The detailed N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 2d) of Co0.85Se/NC display four peaks, including pyridinic N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic N (399.1 eV), graphitic N (400.8 eV), and oxidized N (402.9 eV), revealing N-doping in the carbon matrix.37,39 As for detailed Co 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 2e), both Co0.85Se/NC and CoSe2/NC samples show two core-level peaks, responsible for Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, accompanied by their satellite peaks at relatively higher binding energies, respectively. After deconvolution, two peaks situated at 780.1 and 782.3 eV for Co 2p3/2 are ascribed to Co3+ and Co2+, along with the peaks at 795.7 and 797.6 eV attributed to Co3+ and Co2+ for Co 2p1/2, respectively.40,41 Significantly, the relative mole ratio of Co3+/Co2+ is 1.9 for Co0.85Se/NC, higher than that of CoSe2/NC (1.1), which means that the secondary selenization process will result in a decrease in the Co3+ content and an increase in the Co2+ content. The high-resolution Se 3d XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2f, where two peaks located at 55.9 and 56.7 eV are attributed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively.42 The attached broad peak at 60.1 eV is responsible for SeOx, indicating the presence of trace SeO2 due to surface oxidation. As for a positive shift in the binding energy of Se 3d XPS compared to CoSe2/NC, it can be attributed to the formation of the orthorhombic CoSe2 phase of CoSe2/NC transformed from Co0.85Se/NC, thus resulting in a changed coordination number of Se.
3.2 Electrochemical measurements

3.2.1 OER performance. 
The electrocatalytic performance was determined using a standard three-electrode system. OER activity was first investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 3a, Co0.85Se/NC shows a potential (Ej=10) of 1.505 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than that of CoSe2/NC (Ej=10 = 1.520 V) and CoO/NC (Ej=10 = 1.586 V), even lower than that of precious metal IrO2 (Ej=10 = 1.516 V). Additionally, the overpotential of Co0.85Se/NC at 100 mA cm−2 (406 mV) is slightly higher than that of IrO2 (367 mV), but markedly lower than those of CoSe2 (436 mV) and CoO (506 mV) (Fig. 3b). The OER activity of Co0.85Se/NC is superior to that of most reported Co-based electrocatalysts (Table S1†), revealing a potential practical value for the OER process. The OER electrocatalytic kinetics is investigated by using Tafel plots (Fig. 3c), where the Tafel slope of Co0.85Se/NC is 93 mV dec−1, lower than that of CoSe2/NC (108 mV dec−1) and CoO/NC (117 mV dec−1), implying accelerated OER kinetics for the Co0.85Se/NC electrode. The smallest Tafel slope indicates that Co0.85Se/NC has a good affinity for OH− intermediates, which can promote the formation of intermediates and equilibrium electroadsorption. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis was further executed to investigate the charge transfer performance of the prepared catalysts. As depicted in Fig. 3d, compared with CoSe2/NC and CoO/NC catalysts, Co0.85Se/NC exhibits the smallest Nyquist semicircle diameter, indicating the lowest charge transfer impedance, manifesting effectively improved charge transfer capacity between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte. In order to explore the exposed electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) during the electrocatalytic process, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) values were estimated through CV tests at different scan speeds (Fig. S6†). The Cdl value of Co0.85Se/NC is 39.75 mF cm−2 (Fig. 3e), which was larger than that of CoSe2/NC (23.1 mF cm−2) and CoO/NC (12.5 mF cm−2), demonstrating a larger ESCA (385.0 cm−2ECSA, Fig. S6†) with abundant active sites in the electrocatalytic reaction for Co0.85Se/NC. The normalized current density by both the ECSA and the loading mass is displayed in Fig. S7,† and the Co0.85Se/NC catalyst still shows the best performance. Cobalt selenides display an improved ECSA compared to that of oxides, revealing the promoting effect on OER activity, and Co0.85Se/NC displays higher intrinsic catalytic activity than CoSe2/NC. It promotes sufficient contact with the electrolyte and efficient material transport, which is beneficial to improving the activity of the OER.

(d) Electrochemical impedance spectra of the prepared catalysts. (e) The electrochemical double-layer capacitance values. (f) The chronoamperometry responses of Co0.85Se/NC operated at 1.60 V (vs. RHE), and the inset shows the polarization curve before and after 1000 CV cycles. 
Based on OER electrocatalytic measurements of Co0.85Se/NC and other control samples, the overpotentials to reach the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 decrease from Co0.85Se/NC to CoSe2/NC and to CoO/NC, and the corresponding Tafel slopes, charge transfer properties, and specific activities based on the ESCA almost follow a similar tendency. The above results demonstrate the excellent OER catalytic properties of cobalt selenides. As for the superior OER activity of Co0.85Se/NC compared to CoSe2/NC, it is generally accepted that the introduction of metal cations with higher oxidation states into the electrocatalyst would promote the OER, and existing high-valent metal ions are considered to be the true electrocatalytic centers.26 From XPS analysis results (Fig. 2e), the relative molar ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in Co0.85Se/NC (1.9) is higher than that in CoSe2/NC (1.1), manifesting that Co0.85Se/NC contains a higher content of highly oxidized Co. And existing highly oxidized Co species enable superior OER properties of Co0.85Se/NC compared to CoSe2/NC. After the OER test, the used Co0.85Se/NC catalyst was characterized by XRD to investigate the changes in the structure. From the XRD pattern (Fig. S8a†), the Co0.85Se phase still remained after stability measurements, thus demonstrating its promising OER stability. A more detailed study related to the high-resolution XPS technique was used to detect the chemical states of the used Co0.85Se/NC catalysts after stability tests. For Co 2p XPS high-resolution spectra (Fig. S8b†), Co0.85Se/NC after the OER process shows a positively shifted centered peak associated with an enhanced shoulder in comparison with the original one, indicating a transition from the original low oxidation state to a high oxidation state during a long-term OER test. The above results just verify that Co0.85Se/NC catalysts with more highly oxidized Co species possess higher intrinsic catalytic activity, which exhibits more efficient OER catalytic activity. In addition, the OER mechanism of transition metal electrocatalysts consists of the following four steps:26 (1) * + OH− → *OH + e−; (2) *OH + OH− → H2O + *O + e−; (3) *O + OH− → *OOH + e−; (4) *OOH + OH− → * + O2 + e−. While the third step in the formation of the *OOH intermediate is a key step in the OER, selenides with more high-valence species are favorable for the adsorption of OH− ions.43 Therefore, Co0.85Se/NC with a higher molar ratio of Co3+/Co2+ exhibits enhanced OER activity compared to that of CoSe2/NC. Additionally, Co0.85Se/NC with a nanosheet structure displays a large specific surface area and exposes abundant surface active sites, which is conducive to a full contact between the reaction site and electrolyte and also facilitates the electrocatalytic reaction.
The long-term durability of Co0.85Se/NC during the OER process is estimated by chronoamperometry measurements (Fig. 3f). After continuous operation under 1.60 V (vs. RHE) for more than 30000 s, the current only displays a weak current attenuation, retaining 91.5% of the initial current value. Additionally, after 1000 cycles, there is no significant difference between the anode current density and the initial one, confirming the excellent stability of Co0.85Se/NC for the OER.


3.2.2 ORR performance. 
The ORR performance of the prepared catalysts was investigated in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, with the precious metal Pt/C benchmark as the reference. From cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements (Fig. 4a), typical oxygen reduction peaks are observed with the presence of O2, which is significantly different from the CV curves operated in N2-saturated electrolyte, indicating intrinsic catalytic activity toward the ORR of all prepared samples. As is shown in the LSV curve (Fig. 4b), Co0.85Se/NC delivers a positive onset potential (Eonset) of 0.901 V, which is slightly higher than that of CoSe2/NC (0.879 V), but obviously higher than that of CoO/NC (0.769 V) and NC (0.724 V) samples. The half-wave potential (E1/2) of Co0.85Se/NC is 0.797 V, which is slightly lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.825 V), but higher than that of CoSe2/NC (0.767 V), CoO/NC (0.679 V) and NC (0.626 V), indicating promising ORR activity. The corresponding Tafel plots are displayed in Fig. 4c, and Co0.85Se/NC exhibits a lower Tafel slope value (86 mV dec−1) than CoSe2/NC (105 mV dec−1), which is even lower than that of Pt/C (99 mV dec−1), manifesting the effectively accelerated ORR kinetics of Co0.85Se/NC. The above results demonstrate the improved ORR activity of cobalt selenides in comparison with cobalt oxide, and Co0.85Se/NC exhibits superior ORR properties with enhanced ORR kinetics.

In order to elucidate the ORR mechanism, a series of LSVs were executed under various rotation speeds ranging from 400 to 2025 rpm (Fig. 4d). There is a great linear relationship shown in K–L plots from the LSVs (Fig. 4d, inset), suggesting the first-order ORR kinetics of the reaction rate with the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The calculated average electron transfer number (n) for Co0.85Se/NC is 3.64–3.78 in the region of 0.3–0.5 V, implying that the ORR process occurring on Co0.85Se/NC catalysts follows a near four-electron pathway. Furthermore, RRDE tests were carried out (Fig. 4e). Co0.85Se/NC exhibits a high n value (3.81–3.89), associated with the peroxide yield (HO2−%) below 10%, which are both comparable to those of Pt/C catalysts, thus demonstrating high catalytic efficiency with a favorable reaction pathway for Co0.85Se/NC. In addition, the charge transfer properties of the prepared catalysts during the ORR process were also evaluated (Fig. S9†). Among the prepared catalysts, Co0.85Se/NC has the smallest Nyquist semicircles, suggesting the lowest charge-transfer impedance, which reveals an effective charge-transfer ability between the electrocatalyst and electrolyte during the ORR process. From the above results, Co0.85Se/NC displays a lower E1/2, larger diffusion current density, and lower Tafel value, in comparison with CoSe2/NC, which manifests the more efficient catalytic capability of Co0.85Se for the ORR process than CoSe2. Co0.85Se/NC possesses accelerated ORR kinetics and improved intrinsic catalytic activity, a large exposed electrochemically active surface area (higher electrochemical double-layer capacitance shown in Fig. 3e), and better charge transfer properties (lower charge transfer resistance as shown in Fig. S9†), which explain the high ORR catalytic properties of Co0.85Se/NC. In addition, there is a large number of active N species including pyridinic-N (2.73%) with graphitic-N (4.88%) for Co0.85Se/NC (Fig. S10†). Previous studies have shown that pyridine N can be considered as the active site for the ORR,44 and graphite N species can affect the limit current density,45 both of which are beneficial for electrocatalytic reactions. To further detect the active sites associated with excellent electrocatalytic activity, the high-resolution XPS analysis of Co0.85Se/NC after the ORR test was also carried out. As shown in Fig. S11a,† no obvious changes can be found in Co 2p XPS high-resolution spectra between the used Co0.85Se/NC catalyst after the ORR test and the initial one, demonstrating the reduction process of surface species during the ORR process, which also suggests the high stability of Co0.85Se/NC. As for N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. S11b†), there is a negative shift in the binding energy of pyridine-N species for Co0.85Se/NC after the ORR test, compared with that of the initial one. It can be attributed to the transfer of electrons from the electron-rich OH to pyridine-N active sites, followed by the release of protons to form intermediate products, such as O*.37 The results obtained from XPS observations just suggest that pyridine-N can also be considered as an active site to catalyze an alkaline ORR. And reported theoretical calculations46,47 have manifested that pyridinic-N sites have a large binding energy for O2 adsorption, which can be considered as the active functional group to promote O2 adsorption, thereby accelerating the ORR process. Therefore, profiting from the synergistic effect between well-dispersed Co0.85Se particles and N-doped carbon with abundant pyridinic-N and graphitic-N dopants, Co0.85Se/NC catalysts displays enhanced ORR activity. Furthermore, the porous carbon nanosheet architecture of Co0.85Se/NC is also beneficial to accelerating the ORR, which promotes the adequate contacts of active sites and the electrolyte, and provides rich and short diffusion channels for electron/ion transfer in electrochemical reactions.
To estimate the stability during the ORR process, chronoamperometry measurements were thus performed (Fig. 4f). After 36000 s of continuous operation under constant 0.7 V (vs. RH) conditions, Co0.85Se/NC displays better ORR stability with retaining 84.6% of initial current, while Pt/C exhibits a higher cathodic current decay (25.1%) under the same measurement conditions. Besides, the cathodic current of Co0.85Se/NC changed slightly after methanol was added to the electrolyte, which is significantly different from Pt/C catalysts. The results manifest an excellent methanol tolerance capacity for Co0.85Se/NC (Fig. 4f, inset), also showing the application potential as an efficient catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.
In consideration of the efficient activity towards the OER and ORR of Co0.85Se/NC, the overall oxygen catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts was also assessed. Fig. S12† displays the potential gap values (Egap = Ej=10 − E1/2) of catalysts. The Egap of Co0.85Se/NC (0.708 V) is slightly higher than that of precious Pt/C and IrO2 composite catalysts (0.691 V), but obviously lower than that of CoSe2/NC (0.753 V) and CoO/NC (0.907 V), as well as other reported bifunctional Co-based catalysts (Table S1†), such as Co/S/N-800 (0.76 V),48 FeCo–N/C (0.77 V),49 Co9S8@MoS2 (0.786 V)50 and so on, which indicates superior oxygen electrocatalytic activity for Co0.85Se/NC.


3.2.3 HER performance. 
In order to verify the availability of Co0.85Se in the self-powered energy system, the HER performance was further investigated, which was measured in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a three-electrode setup, and the polarization curve of commercially available Pt/C (20 wt%) is also recorded for comparison. The recorded LSV curves of the prepared samples after iR correction are shown in Fig. 5a, with the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) and 50 mA cm−2 (η50) for catalysts shown on the histogram (Fig. 5b). From LSV curves, the Pt/C benchmark shows excellent HER performance with the lowest overpotential (η10 and η50). Among all the prepared samples, Co0.85Se/NC delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of 216 mV, obviously lower than that of CoSe2/NC (268 mV), CoO/NC (308 mV) and NC (357 mV). We further normalized the current density with the ECSA. As shown in Fig. S13,† the Co0.85Se/NC catalyst still shows the best HER activity, indicating the higher intrinsic HER activity of Co0.85Se/NC than the other samples. Besides, Co0.85Se/NC also has a small Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c), which is slightly larger than that of Pt/C (66 mV dec−1), but much smaller than that of CoSe2/NC (115 mV dec−1) and CoO/NC (147 mV dec−1), demonstrating the accelerated kinetics of Co0.85Se/NC for the HER. The charge-transfer resistance is revealed by EIS analysis as shown in Fig. S14.† The charge transfer resistance of Co0.85Se/NC is much smaller than that of CoSe2/NC and CoO/NC catalysts, confirming that the Co0.85Se/NC catalyst has enhanced conductivity during the HER process. From the above results, cobalt selenides have exhibited more efficient HER catalytic activity than cobalt oxides. Among them, Co0.85Se/NC is further superior to CoSe2/NC in catalytic HER properties. The results reveal the high intrinsic catalytic activity of Co0.85Se, which confirms the reliability of Co0.85Se as a promising HER catalyst. High-resolution XPS analyses were further performed and further provide design principles for efficient catalysts. The Co0.85Se/NC catalysts after the HER test display little difference in the Co 2p spectrum, in comparison with the original chemical state (Fig. S15†), which demonstrates the reduction process on surface species during the HER process. Such results also show that the prepared Co0.85Se/NC catalysts possess outstanding structural stability for hydrogen production. The reaction mechanism for the HER over electrocatalysts in the alkaline media is considered as below30,32: Volmer step: M + H2O + e− → MHads + OH−; Heyrovsky step: MHads + e− + H2O → H2↑+ M + OH−; Tafel step: 2MHads → 2M + H2↑. Under certain reaction conditions, when the Volmer reaction is the HER rate-determining step, the Tafel slope is 120 mV dec−1. While the rate-limiting step corresponds to the Heyrovsky and Tafel reaction stages, the Tafel slope is 40 and 30 mV dec−1, respectively.32 As displayed in Fig. 5c, the Tafel slope of Co0.85Se/NC (74 mV dec−1) is lower than that of CoSe2/NC (115 mV dec−1), which indicates that Co0.85Se/NC follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism during the HER process. The HER operation stability of Co0.85Se/NC was estimated by chronoamperometry measurement under −0.2 V (vs. RHE) and continuous CV cycling tests (Fig. 5d). The Co0.85Se/NC catalyst maintains a stable current density for over 30000 s with only a minor current drop of 2.4%, with an inconspicuous difference between the initial current density and the one after 1000 CV cycles (Fig. 5d, inset), thus manifesting the strong stability of Co0.85Se/NC for the HER. The considerable electrocatalytic activity as well as robust stability of the Co0.85Se/NC catalyst may enable its application potential in the electrocatalytic HER, and also lays a foundation for the construction and operation of the subsequent self-powered energy system.

3.2.4 Overall water splitting and Zn–air battery performance. 
Combined with efficient activity towards the OER and HER of Co0.85Se/NC, the actual overall water splitting capability was further evaluated. We accordingly constructed a water electrolyzer with a two-electrode device in 1.0 M KOH, as illustrated in Fig. 6a, where the as-prepared Co0.85Se/NC catalysts were used for both the anode and the cathode. For comparison, an electrolytic cell was also inspected with Pt/C and IrO2 as the anode and the cathode, respectively. The electrolytic cell based on the noble metal Pt/C//IrO2 electrode is capable of displaying a low voltage of 1.64 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The Co0.85Se/NC electrode couple can deliver overall water splitting with a voltage of 1.70 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to other reported non-precious metal electrocatalysts for water splitting (Table S2†). Then, the actual H2 production and O2 production from overall water splitting is obtained by using a water-gas displacing instrument (Fig. S16†) for HER and OER processes, where continuous H2 and O2 bubbles can be observed from the anode and cathode electrodes (Fig. 6c, inset). Fig. S17† displays the optical images of the gas collection tubes of the cathode and anode at fifteen-minute intervals over a two-hour period. The final results of the measured volumes of H2 and O2versus time are shown in Table S3† and depicted Fig. 6c, which shows a good match with the theoretical values for overall water splitting under different operating times. Concurrently, the Faraday efficiencies for both H2 and O2 production are close to 100% (Fig. S18a†), exhibiting highly efficient water splitting performance. Additionally, there is a linear relationship that can be observed for both H2 and O2 production versus times, demonstrating the robust practical operation stability of the assembled electrolyzer with the Co0.85Se/NC electrode couple. Moreover, when operated at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, only a slight voltage increase is observed over 20000 s (Fig. S18b†), further proving a high durability of the long-term electrochemical process. In addition, the actual overall water splitting performance of Co0.85Se/NC catalysts operated at high temperature was also investigated. The polarization curve of the Co0.85Se/NC//Co0.85Se/NC cell in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at 70 °C is shown in Fig. S19a.† To drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 20 mA cm−2 in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at 70 °C, the electrolyzer based on Co0.85Se/NC as both the anode and the cathode requires a voltage of 1.78 V and 1.83 V, respectively, verifying good water splitting properties under actual high temperature conditions, to a certain extent. Then, the stability of the electrolyzer was also investigated at high temperatures. The chronopotentiometry responses of the Co0.85Se/NC//Co0.85Se/NC electrolyzer were determined at 70 °C, as shown in Fig. S19b.† Only a slight voltage elevation can be observed at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 20000 s continuous testing, exhibiting impressive stability of the practical alkaline electrolyzers operated at 70 °C. Such water splitting properties of Co0.85Se/NC endow it with great potential for practical electrochemical hydrogen production.

(i) Photograph of a LED powered by three ZABs. 
A reliable external power source is essential to drive the proposed self-powered energy system. Profiting from the promising oxygen electrocatalytic activity for the OER and ORR of Co0.85Se/NC, a rechargeable zinc–air battery (ZAB) was constructed based on Co0.85Se/NC as the air cathode, according to the model diagram (Fig. 6d). The charge transfer performance of the assembled ZAB devices based on the prepared catalysts was also measured, as shown in Fig. S20.† Co0.85Se/NC based ZABs display the smallest Nyquist semicircles with the lowest charge-transfer impedance, showing a promising charge-transfer capability, which is conducive to exhibiting good charge–discharge performance for actual assembled ZAB devices. As shown in Fig. 6e, the Co0.85Se/NC based ZAB can deliver an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.44 V. Polarization tests are carried out, illustrated in Fig. 6c. For benchmark comparison, a mixture of Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts was loaded onto carbon paper and measured under the same conditions. The ZAB assembled with Co0.85Se/NC exhibits a charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.91 V at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 and 1.20 V at 50 mA cm−2, which are smaller than that equipped with the Pt/C–IrO2 electrode (0.93 V at 20 mA cm−2 and 1.25 V at 50 mA cm−2), manifesting the excellent charge–discharge capability and high round-trip efficiency of the Co0.85Se/NC based ZAB. Furthermore, the peak power density of the Co0.85Se/NC-assembled ZAB is up to 108 mW cm−2 at 190 mA cm−2, exceeding that of the ZAB with the Pt/C–IrO2 counterpart (68 mW cm−2 at 118 mA cm−2), and widely reported ZABs constructed with transition metal electrocatalysts (Table S4†). The charge–discharge cycling durability of the ZAB is also one of the important indicators affecting the practical application. During galvanostatic measurements at 20 mA cm−2 with 40 min each cycle (Fig. 6g), the Co0.85Se/NC-based ZAB maintains a stable charge–discharge potential without significant decay, with a stable platform after 160 h continuous cycling measurement. In sharp contrast, the ZAB based on precious metal Pt/C + IrO2 displays a gradual increase in the charge–discharge potential gap after 65 h, and the battery performance is even lost completely after more than 106 h. In addition, when the charge and discharge interval is extended to 4 h, the Co0.85Se/NC-based ZAB still maintains excellent stability after 180 h (Fig. 6h), showing strong durability and reversibility. In addition, as displayed in Fig. 6i, three ZABs based on Co0.85Se/NC catalysts are connected in series, and can successfully light up a LED panel showing the NK structure, revealing a prospect of practical application in a realistic environment. Therefore, the assembled ZAB with Co0.85Se/NC as the air cathode exhibits a low over-potential, large peak power density and robust stability, which makes it a promising driving power source with high efficiency and strong durability applied in self-powered systems.
Based on multifunctional Co0.85Se/NC electrocatalysts, a self-powered energy conversion and storage system was constructed. Firstly, the schematic diagram of the light reaction part in this self-powered energy system is illustrated in Fig. 7a, wherein a silicon photovoltaic solar cell converts solar energy into electricity, and charges the Co0.85Se/NC based ZAB to realize the storage of electricity energy during the day. Under stable sunlight, a solar cell can deliver a charging voltage of 2.0 V for the ZAB (Fig. S21†). As is shown in Fig. 7b, after being charged by sustainable solar energy, the assembled ZAB can exhibit an OCV of about 1.43 V, and achieve a stable output voltage for over 260 min at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, when the discharge current density increases from 2, 5 to 10 mA cm−2, it can also display stable discharging plateaus at 1.29, 1.28, and 1.25 V, respectively, demonstrating the remarkable capability of sustainable energy conversion in practical energy conversion installations, and validating the feasibility and reliability of the solar-charged ZAB. The ZAB stores intermittent solar energy during the light reaction, and then releases electrical energy to drive H2 generation under unassisted light reaction conditions, for instance, at night, as illustrated in Fig. 7d. Fig. S22† presents the optical image of the overall water splitting electrolyzer powered by two assembled ZABs connected in series, where the driven voltage of the ZAB for water splitting is maintained at 1.96 V. Then, the H2 and O2 yields from water splitting electrolyzer powered ZABs are measured (Table S5†), and the optical images of gas collection tubes for 40 minutes are collected in Fig. S23.† As shown in Fig. 7e, there is a good agreement of the measured hydrogen and oxygen production values with the corresponding theoretical values. Concurrently, the calculated faradaic efficiency is about 96.49–99.42% for ZAB powered overall water splitting (Fig. 7f), and obvious H2/O2 bubbles can be observed on the electrode surface, demonstrating the practicability and successful operation of water splitting driven by our assembled ZABs. In this regard, ZAB realizes electrical energy storage from solar energy under abundant sunlight, and then provides electrical power continually for overall water splitting during an unassisted light reaction. The efficiency of solar-to-overall water splitting and solar-to-H2 conversion is calculated to be 5.36% and 4.34%, respectively, superior to most reported studies (Table S6†). Notably, the produced O2 from the anode during the water splitting process can also be reused and transported to the air cathode of the ZAB as the reactant active component, facilitating the ORR discharge reaction, thus achieving energy and substance circulation. Additionally, the water splitting can also be directly performed under stable sunlight with the electricity energy provided by a solar cell, as illustrated in Fig. S24a.† During the process, the voltage of overall water splitting driven by a solar cell is maintained at 2.02 V (Fig. S24b†). The H2 and O2 yields during the solar-driven water splitting process were also measured (Fig. S25†), and the obtained H2 and O2 volume and calculated faradaic efficiency are shown in Fig. S26† and Table S7.† The faradaic efficiency is up to 94.30–99.74% for hydrogen production, and 92.11–99.67% for oxygen production, respectively, and the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency in the process is determined to be 6.01%. The above results manifest the successful construction of the self-powered energy conversion and storage system. The solar energy can directly drive the water splitting when the sunlight is available, while the ZAB synchronizes the storage of electrical energy converted from solar energy, to ensure the smooth operation of water splitting even under unassisted sunlight. In this way, on the basis of multifunctional Co0.85Se/NC catalysts, the hydrogen production in the whole system is completely powered by solar energy and the limitation of intermittent sunlight is eliminated (Fig. 7g). It makes full use of solar power to convert renewable electricity for H2 generation, without external non-solar power sources or environmental pollution by-products, which enables the recycling of energy and materials, and provides a feasible way of energy conversion, storage and efficient clean fuel production.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a trifunctional Co0.85Se/NC catalyst has been synthesized through a simple selenylation-carbonization method, which exhibits promising OER, ORR and HER performance. On account of Co0.85Se/NC catalysts, a self-powered energy system was successfully assembled through connecting silicon solar cells, zinc–air batteries and water splitting devices. The energy source of the whole system is solar energy. Under a light reaction, the water splitting can be directly driven by solar energy, and simultaneously, the ZAB synchronizes the storage of electrical energy converted from solar energy. When under an unassisted light reaction, the ZAB supplies power to drive the water splitting, and the conversion efficiency of the solar-to-water splitting device and solar-to-H2 was 5.36% and 4.34%, respectively, which ensures uninterrupted power supply for H2 generation. Besides, the oxygen produced by water splitting can be collected and continuously supplied to the ZAB as the active component of the cathode during the discharge process, which can realize the circulation of both energy and substances. Therefore, through direct or intermittent storage of solar energy, the water splitting is achieved to produce clean H2 fuel, eliminating the limitation of intermittent sunlight, without the need for complex installations and other external energy supply. This work provides new insights into the research of renewable electricity and clean fuel, which is instructive to the future research on more practical energy systems.
