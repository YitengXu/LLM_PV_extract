    , Accepted 7th November 2015First published on 12th January 2016AbstractWe report a comprehensive study probing the influence of polymer blending on the large scale phase separation by the use of electroluminescence imaging (ELI) and light-beam induced current (LBIC) measurements. The study is based on a semi-crystalline and an amorphous analogue of anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE–PPV) copolymer (AnE-PVs) blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Since the semi-crystalline polymer AnE-PVab strongly phase separates from PCBM, whereas the amorphous polymer AnE-PVba intimately mixes with PCBM, the phase separation is precisely controlled by blending both polymers in distinct ratios. The analysis of electroluminescence images and light-beam induced current scans allowed us to conclude about the domain size of the phase separated bulk material and intermixed regions, respectively, with the advantage of probing the whole active layer of the device at once.
Introduction
The morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layers is supposed to crucially influence the device efficiency of polymer based organic photovoltaics (OPV).1–4 Since the development of the BHJ concept,5–7 the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells steadily increased, lately exceeding 10%.8–10 This increase is not only originating from the consequent material development of new high performing donor polymers and acceptor fullerene derivatives but also due to precise control of morphology in terms of phase separation between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) as well as the interface between both.9,11–15 Even though progress has been made concerning alternative acceptor materials,16–19 PCBM is still the most universal and commonly used fullerene derivative. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that the intermixed phase of polymer and PCBM yields high exciton dissociation rates and the phase separated pristine and primarily crystalline phases of polymer and PCBM support the charge transport of free holes and electrons by the formation of an interpenetrating network.20–22 This three phase system of an amorphous intimately mixed polymer:PCBM phase, locally separating the pristine crystalline polymer and a pristine crystalline PCBM phase, is crucial for the design of highly efficient OPV by preventing recombination of free charges across the heterojunction due to energetic relaxation.23–25 Hence the energetic differences between energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) in crystalline and amorphous polymers and acceptors facilitate the charge separation process.15,26,27 Usually, the bulk morphology is quantitatively probed by X-ray scattering techniques, e.g. gracing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GiWAXS) for investigating the crystallinity and orientation of crystals and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) for measuring interface roughness, domain size and purity,9,28–31 whilst atomic force microscopy (AFM) is commonly used to probe the surface morphology which may also propagate into the bulk.32–34 Unfortunately, such techniques are only suitable for investigating the phase separation on a nanoscale of comparably small areas. Furthermore, steady-state optical spectroscopy measurements, such as absorption and photoluminescence, qualitatively provide insight into the polymer order and domain size and offers the opportunity to average over large areas, but lacks local resolution.35–39 To observe morphological changes or differences on large scale areas, optical microscopy40 or photography can be used, but there is in general no detailed information about material properties available. Since the electronic properties – generation, recombination and current extraction – of the active layer are directly linked to the morphology, it is conceivable to use spatially resolved optoelectronic measurement techniques to allusively resolve the morphology. By quantitative evaluation of such measurements, it is possible to extract the local electronic properties, such as dark saturation current and series resistance of the active layer.41,42 To investigate large scale variations in morphology on large area devices, imaging techniques like electroluminescence imaging (ELI) and scanning techniques like light-beam induced current (LBIC) measurements can be applied. Several studies report about investigating the morphology and phase separation by high-resolution imaging methods.43–47 Commonly such techniques are used in order to investigate and discuss a small-sized sample region of interest on the device. In the present study we report about large scale phase separation and investigate the whole sample. A large phase separation is generally containing concentration gradients between the pristine phases and can be resolved by imaging and scanning techniques, allowing us to deduce the requirements directed to highly efficient BHJ morphologies.
Experimental
The herein investigated polymer solar cells were based on two anthracene-containing PPE–PPV (poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene)) alternating copolymers: the first copolymer substituted with linear octyloxy side-chains at the PPE-part and branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side-chains at the PPV-part (AnE-PVab) and the second copolymer substituted with branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side-chains at the PPE-part and linear octyloxy side-chains at the PPV-part (AnE-PVba). AnE-PVab is characterized by a semi-crystalline morphology and AnE-PVba by an amorphous morphology. Synthesis and material properties of those copolymers are described in a previous study.48 The initial results, optoelectronic and optical data, of polymer:PCBM blends and polymer:polymer:PCBM blends and the corresponding preparation protocols are detailed in ref. 49. Furthermore, time-resolved spectroscopy50,51 and structural property analysis52 were carried out as well.
LBIC scans were conducted with a home-built setup using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit to extract the local short-circuit currents at a resolution of 100 μm. The laser excitation wavelength used was 445 nm in order to excite both the polymer and the PCBM. To selectively excite the polymer, additional scans at 532 nm were carried out. By comparing both measurements, obtained at 445 nm and 532 nm, the contribution of the polymer and PCBM to the extracted short-circuit currents could be estimated and the phase separation was determined.
ELI measurements were performed with a cooled silicon charge-coupled-device (Si-CCD) camera with enhanced NIR sensitivity as described before.53,54 To verify the phase separation, ELI measurements with spectral selection of the pristine donor and D/A-interface emission were performed by using a long-pass filter with a cut-off wavelength of 840 nm. All ELI measurements were background corrected by subtraction of corresponding measurements without excitation. For more details on the calculation of phase separation, see ref. 42.
Electroluminescence spectra were recorded with an Avantes AvaSpec ULS-2048 fiber spectrometer in a home-built setup. A Keithley 2601 Source Measure Unit was used for excitation of the samples with a 100 mA injection current under forward bias.
Photographs were taken with an ordinary digital camera Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ3.
Results
At first glance we characterized the spatial phase separation by photography, as shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, the phase separation took place on a remarkably large extent and is directly determined by the blending ratio of semi-crystalline AnE-PVab and amorphous AnE-PVba.
 Fig. 1  Photographs of solar cell active layers for various AnE-PVab:AnE-PVba:PCBM blends. The bright spots are due to residual dust on the samples. 
In binary AnE-PVab:PCBM blends, phase separation occurred to a large extent, but domains became smaller and evenly distributed upon the addition of 10% AnE-PVba. The bright trenches within the active layers originate from the aluminium back contact due to large local film thickness variation. The active layers seemed to form islands by local dewetting of the active layer from the substrate during fabrication. In contrast, 90% and larger concentrations of AnE-PVba led to apparently homogeneous films.
To gain deeper insight into local phase separation, which might be non-detectable by photography, and its influence on local optoelectronic properties, LBIC and ELI measurements were conducted. Fig. 2 depicts LBIC scans of the fabricated solar cells for two different excitation wavelengths, 445 nm for the dominant absorption of PCBM and 532 nm for the dominant absorption of AnE-PV. The scans for 0%, 10% and 50% AnE-PVba show clearly visible differences for the two different excitation wavelengths and manifest the strong phase separation. Hence the two different excitations mostly led to complementary successful photocurrent generation. For 90% and 100% AnE-PVba, no inhomogeneity from phase separation is detected. Only spots of lower photocurrent are observed at mutually coinciding positions, thus they were likely caused by local degradation or processing defects.53

Scans were taken for two different excitation wavelengths to primarily excite the PCBM at 445 nm and the polymers at 532 nm. Short-circuit currents were normalized to the respective maximal value: 0% ba: 2.0 μA @ 445 nm (1 μA @ 532 nm), 10% ba: 1.3 μA (1.5 μA), 50% ba: 2.6 μA (0.9 μA), 90% ba: 2.6 μA (3 μA), and 100% ba: 2.2 μA (2.5 μA). 
In Fig. 3 the electroluminescence spectra of the various blends investigated are depicted. The spectra can be generally divided into emissions arising from pristine – and potentially large scale phase separated – polymer domains in the range between 580 and 750 nm, and those emissions arising from charge transfer (CT) excitons originating from the intimately intermixed phase in the range between 750 and 1150 nm.49,50 Employing the spectrally resolved information within the electroluminescence imaging setup by the use of long-pass cut-off filters, phase separation can be readily detected as shown in Fig. 4. Whereas increased EL emission of the polymer phase was observed for zero and moderate ba-concentrations, no such phase separation was observed for 90% and 100% of AnE-PVba. Furthermore, the contrast due to phase separation became less pronounced upon increasing ba-concentration.

 Fig. 4  ELI pictures of solar cells fabricated from various AnE-PVab:AnE-PVba:PCBM ternary blends. The left hand side shows ELI measurements without spectral selection while on the right hand the calculated relative polymer emission is shown. 
By spectral selection of the EL signal with a long-pass filter, the relative increase of the emission of the polymer phase was calculated.42 The corresponding images are depicted in Fig. 4 in the right column. The shorter wavelength EL emission strongly depends on the local AnE-PVba concentration. The trenches observed by photography and LBIC were resolved by ELI as well.
Of further importance is the size of polymer domains, which controls charge generation and hole transport.50,52 If the polymer domain size exceeds the exciton diffusion length, the charge generation process is locally impeded under illumination whilst only monopolar hole transport may occur under forward injection. If the polymer domains are small enough for allowing exciton diffusion to an adjacent D/A interface, and at the same time large enough for sufficient hole transport, the maximum photocurrent is expected from that favourable morphology. To elucidate the impact of local pristine polymer phase enrichment on charge generation and extraction, Fig. 5 depicts differential polymer maps by (LBIC532-LBIC445)/LBIC532 in comparison to the corresponding polymer emission obtained from ELI. Whereas ELI displays all percolating polymer phases, independent of their domain size, the differential LBIC displays the polymer domain size dependent charge collection as the sum of charge generation and transport. Hence the comparison between LBIC and ELI allows us to roughly estimate polymer domain sizes: either they support generation and percolation or percolation only. The differential LBIC shown in Fig. 5 mostly coincides with the ELI, but local variations can be observed. Taking a closer look further reveals that several intense structures observed in differential LBIC are parallel-translated against the structures detected by ELI (red markers in Fig. 5). Hence they might be at the edges of pristine polymer domains. The blue rim for the 90% and 100% ba results from slightly mismatched position of the sample between the measurements and is only visible as the differential signal is almost zero (compare with Fig. 2).

Discussion
Since charge generation takes place at the polymer:PCBM interface, LBIC maps the local mixing/demixing of the polymer and PCBM or the local size of the interfacial area, respectively. Regions generating low photocurrent for both polymer and PCBM dominant excitation (532 nm and 445 nm) reflect the single material enriched phases, but also bulk depleted regions of locally very thin active layer. In the present case the regions with low generation for both excitations fit to the trenches observed by photography. Comparing both LBIC measurements (445 nm and 532 nm) the photocurrent generation is similarly large at the rim of trenches (green colour in Fig. 5), pointing towards an optimal phase separation to dominantly generated excitons in both materials, AnE-PV and PCBM, which then split at the interface. Comparing the emission spectra shown in Fig. 3 it is conclusive that the relatively increased emission extracted from spectrally selective ELI dominantly originates from polymer emission as PCBM emission (at around 720 nm) is substantially low and only shows very small shoulder peaks for 0%, 10% and 50% AnE-PVba. Interestingly, the polymer emission maps follow the trenches as observed by LBIC and photography, but do not exactly fit. Furthermore, the emission is weak inside the trenches, but large at the rim of trenches. The relationship between the pristine polymer phase and charge generation/extraction becomes conclusive if comparing the differential polymer map of (LBIC532-LBIC445)/LBIC532 and the corresponding ELI. Only polymer phases with proper domain sizes and dispersion, not exceeding the exciton diffusion length and facilitating the necessary interfacial area for splitting the excitons, contribute to the maximum charge generation as well as charge percolation. These regions appear dominant for both differential LBIC and ELI. The regions with large EL emission and reduced charge generation point onto large polymer domains, where excitons cannot reach the interface. Hence percolation is improved, but free charge generation is impeded due to the reduced interfacial area. The spatial ratio of the sufficiently percolating polymer phase to homogeneously intermixed phase gradually changes with the concentration of AnE-PVba. This is not astonishing since the increase in the amorphous polymer fraction reduces the phase separation ability.49 The PCBM becomes dissolved within the amorphous polymer and the crystalline polymer phase totally shrinks as its concentration decreases. Interestingly, the domain size of the percolating polymer phase evolves more “fine-meshed” upon the addition of 10% amorphous AnE-PVba. Hence a more favoured phase separation is achieved, which provides both hole percolation and free charge generation.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the detection of large scale phase separation in ternary polymer:polymer:PCBM blends. The combination of light-beam induced current measurements and electroluminescence imaging enables investigation of large scale phase separation and domain size evolution, which are not detectable with conventional structural analysis subject to area averaging. Spectrally selective measurements allowed us to differentiate between pristine phases and intimately mixed phases of polymer and PCBM. Furthermore, the comparison of LBIC and ELI allowed us to confine the percolating polymer phase from the charge generation supporting phase and thus visualize the spatial distribution of pristine polymer domains.
