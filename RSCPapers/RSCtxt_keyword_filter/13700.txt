    , Accepted 3rd September 2021First published on 3rd September 2021AbstractThe energetic disorder in conjugated polymer films plays a crucial role in determining the charge separation and recombination process at donor/acceptor heterojunctions, and thus dominates the photocurrent and photovoltage in organic solar cells. However, how the polymer molecular packing structure influences the energetic disorder is still mysterious, hindering the promotion of device performance in term of morphological control. In this work, we employed a J71/N2200 planar heterojunction model to construct the relationship between the molecular packing structure and interfacial energetic disorder. Both J71 and N2200 films exhibit a remarkable transformation of the molecular orientation from nearly pure face-on to mixed face-on/edge-on by the incorporation of the DIO additive, in which J71 has a larger degree of disorder in the mixed orientation than N2200. The simultaneously increased coherence length (CL) in the J71 crystalline domains with mixed molecular orientation probably creates enlarged grain boundaries and thus an enriched density of morphological defects, while the decreased CL in the N2200 crystalline domains, compared to their J71 counterparts, would produce a relatively small amount of grain boundaries and thus moderately enhanced defects in N2200 films. Therefore, the supreme interfacial energetic disorder can be found in the bilayer device consisting of the J71 component with mixed orientation as revealed by the characterization of the Urbach energy (Eu) and effective bandgap (Eeffg), which results in severe charge recombination and a shortened charge carrier lifetime. Our results indicate that the pure molecular orientation of the conjugated polymer is vital to the reduction of the interfacial energetic disorder at the heterojunction.
1. Introduction
Conjugated polymers have attracted much attention for decades due to their favorable optoelectronic properties as well as various advantages, including being solution processable, light weight, and flexible, and therefore can be applied in many fields, such as energy conversion and storage, biosensors, and wearable electronic devices.1–6 Improving the conjugated polymer-based device performance is becoming a significant concern in order to realize their commercial application.7,8 Due to the kinks and defects of conjugated polymer chains, their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be considered as consisting of different energy states with a typical Gaussian distribution, in which the distribution breadth of the density of states (DOS) is named the energetic disorder.9,10 It has been shown that the value of the energetic disorder in conjugated polymer films is directly related to their optoelectronic properties.11,12 Charge transport usually occurs via electron hopping between the adjacent localized states in semicrystalline polymer films,13 and low energetic disorder in the crystalline domains will give a dense DOS distribution and thus facilitate high charge carrier mobility.14–16 On the other hand, charge separation at the heterojunction in photovoltaic devices is also affected by the energetic disorder.17,18 An increased charge-transfer (CT) state lifetime can be found in systems with low energetic disorder, which promotes the CT state dissociation instead of recombination and thus is favorable to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices with negligible driving force.19,20 Therefore, control of the energetic disorder becomes one feasible strategy to improve the conjugated polymer-based device performance.
The chemical structure of conjugated polymers primarily affects the energetic disorder of thin films, considering the versatile ability to adjust the degree of conjugation and electron delocalization by substituting different kinds of structural units along the polymer main and side chains.21 For example, Reynold et al.22 found that the polar side chain groups could generate strong local permanent dipoles and thus lead to increased energetic disorder. Besides, Nguyen et al.23 employed three different methods to demonstrate that the energetic disorder of PTB7-th was lower than that of MEH-PPV, which resulted from their crystalline difference induced by the chemical structures. On the other hand, solution-processed conjugated polymer films will be easily frozen in different thermodynamic states during the solidification process,24–26 in which the molecular packing structure of thin films generally influences the π-electron delocalization as well as the trap density and thus the energetic disorder.27–30 As the structural element of the film morphology, the chain conformation of the conjugated polymer principally decides the value of the energetic disorder. A planar and torsion-free backbone conformation is believed to readily achieve disorder-free transport as concluded by Sirringhaus et al.15 Besides, the amorphous and crystalline domains in films also need to be considered. Majkova et al.31 indicated an exponential increase of the defect density of states in P3HT films with an enhanced fraction of amorphous domains, suggesting increased energetic disorder, while Salleo et al.14 concluded that the paracrystallinity in the crystalline domains should be the limiting step for charge transport in a high-molecular-weight conjugated polymer, considering that the width of the DOS tail increases exponentially with the paracrystallinity.32 Recently, we found that the extended coherence length in PM7 films with mixed orientation would enrich the grain boundary and thus lead to increased energetic disorder.33 Those conclusions strengthen the effect of the morphology on the distribution of electronic states in conjugated polymer films. However, how to reduce the energetic disorder in conjugated polymer films is still mysterious, especially for those with different crystallinity and molecular orientation, which inevitably inhibits the charge generation process at the conjugated polymer-based donor/acceptor heterojunction.
In this work, two conjugated polymers J71 and N2200 (the chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1a) are chosen as the donor and acceptor to construct a planar heterojunction, which is employed as the model system to reveal the relationship between the molecular packing structure and interfacial energetic disorder. By using different contents of the DIO additive, both the J71 and N2200 films exhibit a remarkable transformation of the molecular orientation from nearly pure face-on to mixed face-on/edge-on, and the J71 films afford more comparable proportions of face-on and edge-on orientation than those of the N2200 films. Meanwhile, an increased coherence length (CL) in the J71 crystalline domains and a conversely decreasing trend in the N2200 films can be observed. After analyzing their Urbach energy (Eu) and effective bandgap (Eeffg), large interfacial energetic disorder can be found in the bilayer device consisting of the J71 component with mixed orientation, which results in severe charge recombination and a shortened charge carrier lifetime, and thus a dramatically decreased short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The main reason is ascribed to the significantly increased density of morphological defects in J71 films with mixed orientation, and only a moderate enhancement in N2200 films due to less mixed orientation with a decreased CL simultaneously.

2. Experimental section
Materials and solvents
J71 (Mw = 35 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.0) was purchased from VIZUCHEM Co. Ltd and N2200 (Mw = 152 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.4) was synthesized in our lab. Chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Device fabrication. 
The J71/N2200 bilayer devices were fabricated in a conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, and ultrasonicated in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 min, and then a PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated at 5500 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermal annealing at 140 °C for 15 min. The pure J71 and N2200 solutions were prepared by dissolving them into CB, CB + 1% DIO (volume ratio), and CB + 3% DIO with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, respectively. When fully dissolved, the pure J71 solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce a nearly 38 nm thick layer. The pure N2200 solution was spin-coated onto an Si substrate to produce a nearly 34 nm thick layer. The residual DIO was removed by putting those films into a vacuum for 6 h. Next, the N2200 neat films were adhered onto PDMS substrates, and subsequently transferred onto the J71 films to produce the bilayer structures, which were left in a vacuum for 2 h. The buffer layer PDINO was spin-coated onto the active layers and Al with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum under 10−4 Pa. The effective area of the solar cells is 0.04 cm2.


Device characterization. 

I–V curves were obtained in an N2 glovebox under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using an AAA solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enli Technology Co., Ltd) equipped with a KG5 filter and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Before using it, calibration should be done with a standard photovoltaic cell. The EQE was obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3018 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd) and a standard Si photovoltaic cell was employed to calibrate the light intensity.

GIWAXS characterization
GIWAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS/WAXS beamline, Australian Synchrotron ANSTO. Samples were prepared on Si substrates using the same solutions as those used in preparing the bilayer devices. The 15.2 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.08°–0.12°, selected to maximize the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected using a Dectris Pilatus 2 M photon counting detector.
EL, EQE-EL, sensitive-EQE (SEQE) and TPV measurements
The electroluminescence measurements utilized a direct-current meter (PWS2326, Tectronix) to offer a bias voltage to the device, and then the luminous signals were collected using a fluorescence spectrometer (KYMERA-328I-B2, Andor technology LTD). The EQE-EL measurements were implemented using a system including a Keithley 2400 digital source meter, a Keithley 6482 picoammeter, and a standard Si detector (S1337-1010Br). For the sensitive-EQE measurements, the light from a halogen light source (LSH-75, Newport) became monochromatic light by using a monochromator (CS260-RG-3-MC-A, Newport), and was focused on the device to generate electrical signals. Then the signals were amplified by a front-end current amplifier (SR570, Stanford) and finally collected by a phase-locked amplifier (Newport). TPV measurements are used to measure the lifetime of the carriers. The background illumination was provided by a normal LED light source, and pulsed light was provided by an arbitrary wave generator (AFG322C, Tektronix), and eventually the transient photovoltage signals for the device were collected using an oscilloscope (MDO4104C, Tektronix).
Temperature-dependent Voc measurements
The temperature-dependent Voc was measured using a homemade setup. The bilayer devices were put into the sample holder in a chamber, which was pumped into the vacuum state. Next, the sample holder was kept at a different temperature (280, 260, 240, 220, 200, 180, 160, 140, 120, and 100 K) for 20 min by using a liquid nitrogen temperature controller, and then the corresponding I–V curves upon illumination at one sun were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
3. Results and discussion
Conjugated polymers usually feature mixed molecular orientation when processed with different kinds of solvents,30 while J71 and N2200 could readily assemble into pure molecular orientation and thus become a proper model system to investigate the relationship between the molecular packing structure and energetic disorder.34 We firstly used solvent additive DIO to adjust the molecular packing structure of J71 and N2200, respectively. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) with three different grazing incidence angles (α = 0.08°, 0.10°, and 0.12°) was used to investigate the film depth-dependent polymer molecular packing structure. Usually, the X-ray penetration depth in conjugated polymer films will be smaller than 15 nm when α < 0.115° and it will penetrate the entire depth of the conjugated polymer films when α > 0.15°.35 As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the GIWAXS profiles with a grazing incidence angle of 0.08° (corresponding to a depth of ∼5 nm) exhibit similar molecular orientation and coherence length to the other GIWAXS profiles (α = 0.10° and 0.12°), suggesting that the polymer films have a relatively uniform molecular packing structure in the vertical direction. Therefore, the GIWAXS data can reflect the interfacial structure of the conjugated polymer films. We next analyzed the detailed molecular packing structure revealed by the GIWAXS profiles (α = 0.10°). As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the chlorobenzene (CB)-processed J71 film exhibits a (010) diffraction peak at q = 1.68 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and a (100) diffraction peak at q = 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting a pure face-on orientation. Meanwhile, after the incorporation of 1% and 3% (volume ratio) DIO, obvious (100) and (010) diffraction peaks arise in the OOP and IP direction, respectively, which indicates the coexistence of edge-on and face-on orientation (an illustration is shown in Fig. 1c). Besides, an increasing value of the coherence length (CL) can be found in both the OOP (010) and IP (100) diffraction peaks with the use of the DIO additive, ranging from 25.34 to 32.63 Å and from 50.75 to 80.47 Å (Table S1, ESI†), respectively. On the other hand, the N2200 films show a similar transformation of the molecular orientation compared to their J71 counterparts. The as cast N2200 film exhibits a (100) diffraction peak at q = 0.25 Å−1 in the IP direction and a (010) diffraction peak at q = 1.61 Å−1 in the OOP direction. With the incorporation of DIO, the (100) diffraction peak at q = 0.25 Å−1 appears in the OOP direction, which implies that the face-on orientation in the as cast N2200 film rearranges into mixed molecular orientation. However, decreased CL values, from 37.03 to 21.00 Å and from 299.15 to 196.35 Å, can be observed for both the OOP (010) and IP (100) diffraction peaks with the use of DIO, respectively, which is opposite to the J71 films. Kim et al.36 previously observed increased CL values with pure face-on orientation after the incorporation of DIO in N2200 blend films; we note that the different trend with the present results is probably ascribed to the molecular weight difference. We also calculated the amount of edge-on vs. face-on in the J71 and N2200 films (see Fig. S3, ESI†), and found that the J71 films exhibit more comparable proportions between the different orientations than those of the N2200 films after the incorporation of DIO. This indicates a more mixed degree of edge-on and face-on orientation in the J71 films. As discussed in our previous work,33 the increased CL values with the mixed molecular orientation will possibly lead to morphological defects due to the emergence of grain boundaries. Here, the J71 and N2200 films are systematically controlled to assemble from nearly pure face-on to mixed molecular orientation, in which the CL values exhibit a reverse trend between the J71 and N2200 films. Therefore, it needs to be clarified how the different molecular packing structures affect the optoelectronic properties and energetic disorder at the donor/acceptor heterojunction.
We use a PDMS-template-transfer method37 to construct the J71/N2200 planar heterojunction (the device geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1a), in which the comparison of the device performance is implemented by individually changing the molecular packing structure of one component while keeping the other one invariable. The cross-section morphology characterizations (Fig. S4, ESI†) and previous studies33,38 have shown that the bilayer structure prepared with the PDMS-template-transfer method will have a sharp interface between the two polymer layers, which eliminates the effect of molecular diffusion at the interface on the device performance. The I–V curves for different bilayer devices are characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. With the transformation of the molecular orientation from pure face-on to mixed face-on/edge-on in the J71 films and the invariable face-on orientation in the N2200 films, the values of Voc and Jsc both decrease obviously, ranging from 0.946 to 0.758 V and from 2.09 to 0.66 mA cm−2, respectively. This leads to a tremendous reduction of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 1.29% to 0.31%. On the other hand, when the molecular packing changes from pure face-on to mixed face-on/edge-on in the N2200 films and the J71 films keep the invariable face-on orientation, the values of Voc are fairly comparable around 0.94 V while the values of Jsc decrease from 2.09 to 1.34 mA cm−2, and thus the PCE shows a relative reduction from 1.29% to 0.73%. Besides, we also measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for different bilayer devices. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQE values decrease dramatically with the transformation of the molecular packing in the J71 layers, while a slightly reduced EQE value can be found in the devices with the molecular packing changes in the N2200 layers. This further confirms the Jsc variation trend obtained from the I–V curves.

Previous work has found that the molecular orientation will have crucial impacts on the device performance. For example, Nguyen et al.39 found that devices with donor molecules face-on exhibit a higher CT state energy and less non-radiative recombination, while devices with donor molecules edge-on are more efficient at charge generation. Cho et al.40 revealed that in P3HT/PCBM bilayer devices photocurrent generation is more efficient at the face-on donor–acceptor interface than at the edge-on interface. Those finding suggest that the molecular packing structure will determine the charge generation and energy loss in the OSCs. We thereby tried to investigate the possible reasons for this performance difference in our bilayer devices. The surface roughness of the J71 and N2200 films at the heterojunction would affect the device performance and thus should be primarily identified. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed to analyze the surface morphology of the J71 and N2200 films at the heterojunction. As shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), the J71 films exhibit an increasing value of the root mean squared (RMS) roughness from 0.65 nm (pure face-on) to 2.15 nm (mixed face-on/edge-on), while the N2200 films show a similar trend and generally larger RMS values (from 3.52 to 5.82 nm) compared to their J71 counterparts. This suggests that the values of the surface roughness in the J71 and N2200 layers both increase and thus should not be responsible for the device performance difference. Besides, we analyzed the charge carrier lifetime in different bilayer devices by measuring their transient photovoltage (TPV).41,42 As shown in Fig. 2c, when the molecular packing structure changes from pure face-on to mixed orientation in the J71 films, the charge carrier lifetime decreases generally at the overall photovoltage. On the contrary, the charge carrier lifetime nearly keeps constant with the molecular packing transformation in the N2200 films in the test photovoltage range, which is different from their J71 counterparts. The dramatically different charge carrier lifetime in the bilayer device should be one possible reason leading to the severely reduced Jsc when changing the molecular packing structure in the J71 films.
In addition, the charge recombination process was also examined in the bilayer devices with different molecular packing structure by measuring their light intensity-dependent Jsc and Voc. The power law dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) can be expressed as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where α is the exponential factor. When the bimolecular recombination is weak, the α value is commonly close to unity.43 As shown in Fig. 3a, the Jsc values reduce with the change of the light intensity for all bilayer devices. After fitting those profiles, the obtained α value is found to decrease gradually from 0.97 to 0.92 with the molecular packing transformation in the J71 films, indicating severe bimolecular recombination in the devices with mixed J71 molecular orientation, while the α values also reduce slightly from 0.97 to 0.94 with the molecular packing transformation in the N2200 films, which suggests slightly increased bimolecular recombination. Besides, the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity (kT/q) can manifest the bimolecular recombination at open circuit. It has been proved that this value would be bigger than kT/q if additional trap-assisted recombination is involved.44 As shown in Fig. 3b, the fitted slope value improved from 1.23 to 1.69 and 1.85 kT/q with the molecular packing transformation in the J71 films. However, it nearly remain unchanged (1.23, 1.22, and 1.19 kT/q) with the molecular packing transformation in the N2200 films. Combined with the charge carrier lifetime analysis, those provide evidence that mixed orientation in J71 films will produce more traps than that of N2200 films and thus lead to a dramatic Jsc drop in the bilayer devices.

The origin of the Voc difference was also studied by analyzing the energy loss in the bilayer devices. Typically, the Voc value is determined by two parts of energy losses resulting from charge transfer (Eg − Ect) and the charge recombination process (Ect − qVoc).45 Here, Eg is the optical bandgap of the low bandgap component in the bilayer devices, which can be obtained by identifying the intersection point from the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the J71 and N2200 films (see Fig. S7, ESI†). Ect is the energy of the charge transfer states at the heterojunction and can be obtained by fitting the curves of the sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) and the electroluminescence (EL) (see Fig. S8, ESI†). Besides, charge recombination loss can arise in the form of radiative (Δrad) and non-radiative (Δnon-rad), in which the radiative recombination loss is unavoidable and the non-radiative recombination loss can be derived from the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQE-EL) (Fig. 3c).46,47 The detailed values for each part of the energy loss and the relative fitting data are listed in Table 2 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The values of Eg − Ect in different bilayer devices exhibit a small difference of ∼0.02 eV when changing the molecular packing in the J71 or N2200 films. In addition, all the bilayer devices have a comparable Δrad around 0.15–0.16 eV, while it is the obviously different Δnon-rad values that result in the Voc variations. With the transformation of the molecular packing from pure face-on to mixed orientation in the J71 films, the Δnon-rad values increase gradually from 0.27 to 0.39 and 0.42 eV. However, changing the molecular packing structure in the N2200 films can hardly influence the Δnon-rad values (around 0.26–0.27 eV). This suggests that the dramatic Voc difference in the bilayer devices should be ascribed to the non-radiative recombination loss caused by the mixed orientation in the J71 films. On the other hand, Nguyen et al.48 indicated that the trend in the voltage-dependent-EQE-EL curves probably reflects the trap density in the films. Here, higher voltage dependence can be found in the devices with J71 mixed orientation than the pure face-on device, while it shows a similar trend with the molecular packing transformation in the N2200 films (see Fig. 3c). This further confirms the increasing traps caused by the J71 films. Fig. 3d depicts the effect of the molecular packing structure on the different kinds of charge recombination process in the bilayer devices, which manifests that the molecular packing transformation in the J71 films would lead to more severe charge recombination compared to their N2200 counterparts.

The interfacial energetic disorder at the heterojunction is subsequently analyzed to explain this phenomenon. The value of the Urbach energy (Eu), which reflects the energetic disorder, can be obtained by fitting the EQE curves at the energy around the CT states (∼1.35 eV) based on the equation:49,50 EQE(E) ∝ α(E) ∝ exp(E/Eu)(1)where E is the incident photon energy and α is the absorption coefficient. As shown in Fig. 4a, the fitted value of Eu is 58.1 meV for the as cast bilayer device and it increases to 69.2 meV when changing the molecular packing structure of the J71 films. However, the Eu value merely has a slightly increase to 59.5 meV with the molecular packing transformation in the N2200 films. We also compared the present interfacial Eu values with reported ones in bulk heterojunction systems. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), all the fullerene-based blend systems showed relatively lower interfacial Eu values compared to the present polymer/polymer heterojunction. This probably results from the higher crystallinity of fullerene molecules, which facilitates ordered packing at the donor/acceptor interfaces. In addition, we also employed the effective bandgap (Eeffg) to derive the interfacial energetic disorder. Generally, the Voc of organic solar cells can be written as:51,52 (2)where EHOMO,D and ELUMO,A are the HOMO energy of the donor and LUMO energy of the acceptor, respectively. Δ is related to the energetic disorder at the heterojunction, from which the Gaussian width of the DOS (σ) can be obtained based on the expression Δ = σ2/kBT. The value of (EHOMO,D – ELUMO,A − Δ) can be regarded as the effective bandgap corrected by the energetic disorder. kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, G is the electron–hole pair generation rate, γ is the recombination rate coefficient, and Nh and Ne are the total density of states for holes and electrons, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, all the Voc values of different bilayer devices increase linearly with decreasing temperature. By extrapolating Voc to T = 0 K we obtain the intercepts, which can be regarded as Eeffg in each bilayer device according to eqn (2). Besides, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to measure the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for J71 and N2200 with different molecular packing structures (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†),53 and subsequently the Δ and σ values can be obtained (Table 3). We found that the σ value in the as cast bilayer device is 94.9 meV and it increases to 119.1 and 99.0 meV when changing the molecular packing structure in the J71 and N2200 films, respectively. This trend is similar to the Eu values and indicates that mixed molecular orientation in both the J71 and N2200 films can generate morphological defects at the heterojunction, while simultaneously increasing CL values in the J71 films lead to the creation of more defects than in the N2200 films with decreasing CL values.

It has been proved that the interfacial energetic disorder will largely influence Jsc and Voc in OSCs. Friend et al.19 found that low energetic disorder would extend the lifetime of CT states and thus facilitate the separation of those CT states by avoiding being trapped in the tail of the DOS. They also observed that the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton (T1) forms following bimolecular recombination, suggesting the generation of CT states with both spin-singlet (1CT) and spin-triplet (3CT) characters, and the relaxation of 3CT to T1 states could be suppressed when the energetic disorder is low.20,54 This indicates that the energetic disorder at the heterojunction determines both the charge separation and recombination processes. Here, with the increased number of grain boundaries induced by the transformation of the J71 and N2200 molecular orientation, the corresponding values of the interfacial energetic disorder in the bilayer devices both increase, though to different extents, as proved by two different methods. Therefore, a decreased charge carrier lifetime and severe charge recombination can be found in the bilayer devices with mixed molecular orientation of the J71 films, which leads to a dramatic Jsc reduction, while the slightly enhanced energetic disorder in the bilayer devices with the molecular orientation transformation of the N2200 films seemly has limited influence on the charge carrier lifetime and merely promotes the bimolecular recombination process. Meanwhile, we also measured the charge carrier mobility for J71 and N2200 films with different molecular packing structure based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.55,56 As shown in Fig. S10 and Table S5 (ESI†), the hole and electron mobility both decrease with the molecular packing transformation, which becomes another possible reason leading to the Jsc reduction. On the other hand, the Voc value is also affected by the energetic disorder at the heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 4c, in addition to the energy losses caused by exciton splitting (Δ1) and the CT state binding energy (Δ2), the interfacial disorder could produce an inevitable energy loss (Δ3) ranging from 75 to 225 meV, which results in a smaller value of the experimentally measured Ect than the intrinsic Ect values.57 Here, the gradually decreasing Ect values from 1.36 to 1.34 eV with the molecular packing transformation of the J71 films probably partly reflect the energy loss induced by the interfacial energetic disorder.50 In addition, we infer that the decreased CL values with less mixed molecular orientation in the N2200 films, which should produce fewer grain boundaries and morphological defects than their J71 counterparts, are responsible for the relatively less changed device performance.
4. Conclusions
We have shown that the different types of molecular orientations in both J71 and N2200 films can be successfully controlled, which paves the way to accurately reveal the decreased or enhanced energetic disorder induced by various molecular packing structures. Besides, the variation of the interfacial energetic disorder is largely related to the molecular packing transformation in the J71 layer rather than in the N2200 layer. This provides a new insight that the molecular packing structures of the donor and acceptor should be considered separately to decrease the interfacial energetic disorder. Moreover, decreased interfacial energetic disorder has been found to readily inhibit charge recombination and extend the charge carrier lifetime, which suggests a new strategy to improve the device performance by minimizing the interfacial energetic disorder. Our results provide strong evidence that the pure molecular orientation in conjugated polymer films is crucial to decrease the interfacial energetic disorder at a planar heterojunction. Considering the more complex yet similar interfacial morphology in a bulk heterojunction, it seems reasonable to infer that the molecular packing induced interfacial energetic disorder should also be carefully considered towards an efficient charge generation process and thus high PCE in bulk heterojunctions.
