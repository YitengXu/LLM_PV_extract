    , Accepted 24th August 2020First published on 31st August 2020AbstractWe have theoretically examined the geometries, electronic density of states and band structures of cubic and hexagonal A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) using meta-GGA SCAN-rVV10. The optimized lattice density was found to vary between 2.68 and 4.08 g cm−3 for cubic-A2AgCrCl6, with the fundamental electronic bandgap (direct) in the range of 0.66–0.69 eV. The cell density of hexagonal A2AgCrCl6 was between 2.97 and 3.93 g cm−3, but with an indirect bandgap of 0.93–1.02 eV. The valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum of A2AgCrCl6 were confirmed to be essentially of Cr(3d) character, but the contributions from the orbital states of Cl(3p) to the VBM were also appreciable. Cubic A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) was identified to possess genuine perovskite stoichiometry, evaluated using various geometry-based indices (viz. octahedral factor, tolerance factor, and global instability index). This was not so for A2AgCrCl6 (A = Na, Li), and was due to the small size of Na and Li cations that caused the critical strain of CrCl6 octahedra and a significant decrease in the cell volume. However, all the five A2AgCrCl6 displayed nearly similar optical properties, including the nature of the oscillator peaks in the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, photoconductivity, reflectivity, and Tauc spectra. The zero-limit of the refractive index was calculated around 2.25 and 2.00 for cubic and hexagonal A2AgCrCl6, respectively, and the extinction coefficient was very small for all cases. The nature of the optical bandgap and transition peaks discussed in this study of cubic and hexagonal Cs2AgCrCl6 agreed well with the experiment. The examination of phonon band dispersion led to the conclusion that cubic-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb) are the only halide double perovskites of the entire series that are dynamically stable.
1. Introduction
Lead-free halide based double perovskites with the chemical formula A2B′B′′X6 are undoubtedly an important class of materials for photovoltaics, light emission devices and optoelectronics,1–8 analogous to single halide perovskites.9 In A2B′B′′X6, A is a monovalent inorganic/organic cation (viz. Cs+, Rb+, methylammonium), B′ is a monovalent transition metal or an alkali metal cation (viz. Na+, K+, Ag+, Cu+, Tl+), B′′ is a trivalent transition metal or a non-transition metal cation (viz. In3+, Sb3+, Bi3+, Cr3+, Au3+), and X is a monovalent halide anion (X = Cl−, Br−, I−).
A great number of halide based double perovskites have been demonstrated in recent years. They are not only stable against heat and light,10 but are also environmentally friendly and nontoxic.11 Indeed, this is in comparison to the most efficient light absorber MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium).12–15 MAPbI3 has been regarded as a blockbuster photovoltaic material, with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) that has increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2020.16
The low PCE, long term stability, and high toxicity characteristics of most lead-based halide perovskites9 have already created a roadmap for discovering new materials. To this end, numerous halide double perovskites have been theoretically proposed using high-throughput computational studies.17–20 Many of them have also been experimentally synthesized and their material properties were characterized.6,11,15 Such attempts were made to increase the diversity of metal ion substitutions at B′ and B′′ sites in A2B′B′′X6 and to examine the resulting changes in the lattice size, shape, bandgap, and optical properties.17–20 The underlying reason for such theoretical and experimental attempts was to find materials that are suitable not only for photovoltaics and photocatalysis, but also for the development of phosphor-converted light-emitting devices for bioimaging and biomonitoring, among others.17–20,21
The use of a trivalent B′′-site cation in A2B′B′′X6, which was initially restricted to the pnictogen group (p-block elements, viz. In3+ and Bi3+),1–4,6,11 was later replaced by d-block transition metal elements. The Cs2AgCrCl6 halide double perovskite is one of those transition-metal based systems.21 While this system is cubic (space group Fmm),18 its hexagonal polytype (Rm) was recently experimentally synthesized, thereby its crystal structure, optical properties, thermal behavior, and magnetic properties are known.21 It was observed that the material is paramagnetic, and displays optical transition features in the near-infrared to the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Similarly, Zhao et al.22 have examined a Cr3+-doped halide perovskite called Cs2AgInCl6:Cr3+. It exhibited broadband near-infrared emission ranging from 850 to 1350 nm centered at 1010 nm. Its excitation bands were observed at 353, 565, and 800 nm. These bands were attributed to the absorption of the Cs2AgInCl6 host, the Cr3+ d–d spin-allowed transitions 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2, respectively.22
This work theoretically investigates the electronic structure, stability, density of states, and band dispersion of cubic A2AgCrCl6 that have a double perovskite stoichiometry, where A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, and Li. The motivation for this work is to elucidate how alkali substitution modulates the crystal lattice and electronic, geometrical, and optical properties, and to examine whether each of the five members of the A2AgCrCl6 series has a stable perovskite structure. We investigate the orbital origin of the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum (VBM and CBM, respectively) of A2AgCrCl6 and discuss the effect of the alkali atom at the A site on the mobility of charge carriers. Linear response properties, i.e. the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, photoconductivity, reflectivity and complex refractive index spectra, are evaluated and compared. The phonon-based band dispersion and density of states analyses are performed to explore the dynamical stability of A2AgCrCl6. The same properties simulated for hexagonal A2AgCrCl6 are also included and compared with that known experimentally.21
2. Computational methods
The primitive- and conventional unit-cell geometries of cubic and hexagonal A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) were relaxed within the framework of the meta-generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) using SCAN-rVV10. SCAN is “Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed”, and is paired with the non-local correlation part from the rVV10 vdW density functional.23–28 This pairing was shown to provide superior performance over the non-empirical Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.29 For instance, the results of SCAN-rVV10 have already assisted in gaining correct insight into the chemical bonding, intermediate-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction, and interlayer binding energies and spacing, as well as intralayer lattice constants.23 In any case, a k-point mesh 8 × 8 × 8 centered at Γ was used for sampling the first Brillouin zone. The projector augmented wave method30 was used for all elements of A2AgCrCl6. The energy cut-off used for geometry relaxation was 520 eV. The average forces on ions were minimized to 0.005 eV Å−1. Hereafter, we label cubic and hexagonal A2AgCrCl6 as c-A2AgCrCl6 and h-A2AgCrCl6, respectively.
Calculations of the band dispersion (E–k diagram) were performed using the same functional as above; the primitive cells were used. The high-symmetry band labels of the Fmm (no. 225) and Rm (no. 166) space groups31 were used for c-A2AgCrCl6 and h-A2AgCrCl6, respectively. These include k-paths Γ → X → W → L and Γ → T → H2/H1 → L → S0/S2 → F, respectively. The calculation of the density of states (DOS) was performed with the same computational approach, but with a high dense k-point mesh 11 × 11 × 11. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections detailed in the manual32 of Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)33,34 was used. The DOS/band structures were analyzed using the Pyband35 and Sumo packages.36
The effective masses m* of the charge carriers associated with the VBM and CBM of A2AgCrCl6 were determined using the parabolic fitting of the band edges. The relationship  was used, where E(k) is the energy of the band edge as a function of the wave vector k that defines the local curvature of the band dispersion, ħ is the Plank's constant, and the + and − sign refers to electrons and holes, respectively.37
The linear response properties of A2AgCrCl6 were analyzed by calculating the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function ε(ω), where ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) = ε(1)αβ(ω) + iε(2)αβ(ω). The Kramers–Kronig transformation was utilized for the calculation of the real part of the dielectric function, ε1(ω) (ε1(ω) = ε(1)αβ(ω)), and is related to ε2(ω) (ε2(ω) = ε(2)αβ(ω)) via the relationship given by38, where P denotes the principal value and η is a small complex shift, in which, a larger η results in a slight smoothing of the real part of the dielectric function. Similarly, the Kubo–Greenwood formula  implemented in VASP5.433,34 was used for the calculation of ε(2)αβ(ω), where the subscripts in italics c and υ refer to conduction and valence band states, respectively, and uck is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point k. In all cases, the number of empty conduction band states was doubled and the number of grid points on which to compute DOS was set at a recommended value of 2000.
It is worth noting that the linear response properties cannot be calculated with the SCAN-rVV10 functional, which is obviously due to the fact that VASP5.433,34 does not support calculation of such properties with meta-GGA functionals. We thereby employed the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method39 to calculate such properties, and in this case, the relaxed SCAN-rVV10 geometries of A2AgCrCl6 were used. Other optical properties such as the absorption coefficient α(ω), reflectivity R(ω), refractive index n(ω), and extinction coefficient κ(ω) spectra were calculated using the relationships given by eqn (1)–(4):40–43 (1) (2) (3) (4)where c and ω are the light velocity in vacuum and the frequency of the light wave, respectively. All calculations were performed using VASP 5.4.33,34
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometry
Experimentally, the Rm geometry of Cs2AgCrCl6 was confirmed to be paramagnetic.22 Based on this, and given that the system contains a 3d3 transition metal, both spin-polarized and non-spin polarized calculations were performed to energy minimize the antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic and nonmagnetic configurations of c-A2AgCrCl6 conventional cells. Similar to that reported elsewhere for other perovskite systems,18b the total energy was found to be virtually the same for all the magnetic and non-magnetic configurations of each system (all within 1.6 meV per unit formula). The small energy difference between the different configurations of each system may mean that Cs2AgCrCl6 is paramagnetic at room temperature. Thus, the results of spin-polarized paramagnetic configurations of c- and h-A2AgCrCl6, without any specific bias to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orderings, are discussed below.

Fig. 1a and b display the relaxed conventional and primitive unit-cells of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 containing 40 and 10 atoms, respectively, which are similar to that found for the corresponding cells of the other four members of the series c-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Rb, K, Na, Li). The Cr–Cl (2.369 Å), Ag–Cl (2.697 Å), and Cs–Cl (3.586 Å) bond distances and the cis-Cl–B′/B′′–Cl (all 90°) and trans-Cr–Cl–Ag angles (all 180°) obtained for c-Cs2AgCrCl6 suggest the 3D-nature of the system. This is consistent with the predicted lattice constants of c-Cs2AgCrCl6, in which, a = b = c and α = β = γ = 90° (Table 1), revealing that the Fmm space group symmetry is adequate to describe c-Cs2AgCrCl6. The conclusion is transferable to the lighter members of the series.

Alkali replacement in c-A2AgCrCl6 caused a systematic decrease in the metal–Cl and alkali–Cl bond distances (Table 2). The change may not be unexpected since the decrease of the size of the alkali cation from Cs through Rb to K to Na to Li marginally influences the octahedral coordination environment of the Ag and Cr ions in c-A2AgCrCl6, resulting in the shrinking of the crystal lattice. Concomitant with this decrease is the decrease of the cell volume that reduces appreciably passing down the series (Table 1). For instance, the cell volume is found to be the largest for c-Cs2AgCrCl6 (V =1040.2 Å3) and the least for c-Li2AgCrCl6 (V = 956.7 Å3).

The relaxed Rm geometry of Cs2AgCrCl6 is shown in Fig. 1c, whereas the relaxed lattice constants of h-Cs2AgCrCl6 are listed in Table 1. The data show that the lattice constants of Cs2AgCrCl6 are slightly underestimated compared to experiment.22 In particular, each of the lattice constants a and b is underestimated by 0.07 Å, whereas the lattice constant c is underestimated by 0.36 Å. The underestimation accounts for the concomitant decrease in the cell volume by 49.18 Å3, compared to experiment (V = 1667.7(2) Å3). The A-site substitution in h-A2AgCrCl6 by Rb, K, Na or Li decreases the lattice constants a and b, and increases c, and is accompanied by a decrease in the cell volume.
The bonding details of h-A2AgCrCl6 summarized in Table 2 show a monotonic decrease in the bond type across the series, analogous to that found for c-A2AgCrCl6. However, in the present case, the AgCl6 octahedra, compared to the CrCl6 octahedra, are significantly distorted from regular octahedra. This is reminiscent of the trans-∠Cl–Ag–Cl and -∠Cl–Cr–Cl angles, in which the former are far from 180°, and is in agreement with experiment.
The cell-density ρ (ρ = mass/volume) of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 is predicted to be the largest of 4.08 g cm−3. Alkali substitution at the A-site significantly reduces the density of the A2AgCrCl6 lattice, giving rise to a value of 2.68 g cm−3 for Li2AgCrCl6 (Table 1). Although the former value may be comparable with that of Cs2AgBiCl6 (ρ = 4.22 g cm−3),44 the density of the remaining members of A2AgCrCl6 is relatively low, meaning they are relatively light-weight. A similar decreasing trend in the density is also noticeable from Table 1 for h-A2AgCrCl6, especially when passing down the series from h-Cs2AgCrCl6 to h-Li2AgCrCl6. The experimental density of h-Cs2AgCrCl6 was reported to be 3.814 g cm−3.
The magnetic moment localized on each Cr of c-A2AgCrCl6 and h-A2AgCrCl6 was in the range of 2.91–2.2 μB and 2.90–2.94 μB per formula unit, respectively, where μB is the Bohr magneton. This indicates that the cation Cr in these systems has a formal charge of +3, thereby explaining the electrical neutrality of A2AgCrCl6.
The experimental effective magnetic moment μeff for h-A2AgCrCl6 was 3.78(1) μB per formula unit, which was determined from the inverse magnetic susceptibility measurements.22 Clearly, the SCAN-rVV10 functional underestimates the localized magnetic moment of the Cr cation. Nevertheless, the experimentally determined μeff was consistent with the expected free-ion magnetic moment of 3.87 μB that can be estimated from the spin-only magnetic moment formula, , or from the relation , where S = 3/2 and n = 3 represent the total electron-spin and the number of (three) unpaired electrons of the free Cr3+ ion, respectively.
3.2 Perovskite stability
The combination of the octahedral factor μ (μ = rB/rX)45,46 and the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor t47 has been widely used to assess the geometrical stability and perovskite nature of ABX3 and AB′B′′X6 systems, where rA, rB and rX refer to the ionic radii of sites A, B and X, respectively. For AB′B′′X6 double perovskites, rB = (rB′ + rB′′)/2. A t value between 0.813 and 1.107 and a μ value in the range of 0.410 < μ < 0.895 (i.e., μ > 0.41) have been suggested to result in stable perovskite structures.18,45,46,48 Thereby, considering Shannon's radii for the ions,49 our calculations gave a μ of 0.49 for A2AgCrCl6 (Table 3), which is within the range recommended for μ.18 On the other hand, the tolerance factor for the first four members of the series, A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na), varies between 0.84 and 0.97 (Table 3). This shows that A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na) adopts a perovskite structure. This is not the case for Li2AgCrCl6, which can be understandable as t for this system is 0.72.

Bartel and coworkers18a have recently argued that the recommended range for t does not guarantee the formation of the perovskite structure since it gives a high false-positive rate (51%) in the region of t (0.825 < t < 1.059) where the geometry of the perovskite is expected. It was added further that whereas μ may fall within the range where BX6 octahedra are expected based on geometric considerations (0.414 < μ < 0.732), the observed structures they examined were identified to be non-perovskite. They, therefore, proposed a modified version of the tolerance factor τ to judge the perovskite nature of ABX3 and A2B′B′′X6, which is given by , where nA is the oxidation state of A, ri is the ionic radius of ion i, and rA > rB by definition. Accordingly, Bartel et al. have suggested that chemical systems with τ < 4.18 indicates a perovskite structure, which was based on the fact that this can result in a high overall accuracy of 92% for the experimental set they tested (94% for a randomly chosen test set of 116 compounds). Not only this, but a nearly uniform performance was observed for systems with five different anions evaluated [oxides (92% accuracy), fluorides (92%), chlorides (90%), bromides (93%), and iodides (91%)]. Nevertheless, and using the relationship described above for τ, we found that A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) are indeed stable perovskites (3.87 < τ < 4.05, Table 3). However, Na2AgCrCl6 may not be regarded as a perovskite since τ for this system (τ = 4.52) is beyond the recommended range (τ < 4.18). The same argument is applicable to Li2AgCrCl6 (τ = 26.10). The unusually large τ found for Li2AgCrCl6 indicates that there is significant instability in the perovskite structure that might not be stable under ambient conditions, arising from an insufficiently small Li+ cation at the A-site that somehow destabilizes the CrCl6 and AgCl6 octahedra.
Because of the inconsistency between the values of the tolerance factors above, we carried out further analysis of the stability using the so-called Global Instability Index (GII).50 It was previously applied to various cubic perovskite oxides to explore the stability feature.51 The GII is defined as the root mean square of the bond discrepancy index in the unit cell, and is given by , where n is the number of ions and d is the bond discrepancy factor defined as the deviation of the bond valence sum from the formal valence. Our GII data are summarized in Table 3. They suggest that the first three members of the series, viz. A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K), with GII values between 0.10 and 0.13 valence unit (v.u.), are marginally deviated from ideal perovskite stoichiometry. This does not apply to Na2AgCrCl6 and Li2AgCrCl6. For them, the GII values were 0.35 and 0.41 v.u., respectively, meaning that their geometries are significantly distorted. This conclusion is based on the rationale that GII is 0.0 v.u. for a geometrically stable structure, and GII > 0.2 v.u. for empirically unstable structures. The observation that Na2AgCrCl6 and Li2AgCrCl6 are non-perovskites (significantly distorted) is consistent with the conclusion reached using the new tolerance factor τ (see above).
3.3 Energy stability

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were previously performed to understand the thermodynamic stability of solid systems at specific temperatures,85,86 but the energy differences between reactants and products can also provide insights into stability phenomena.9 Experimentally, the quaternary halide perovskite Cs2AgCrCl6 was prepared in the form of dark purple crystals by the reaction of CsCl, AgCl, and CrCl3 at 700 °C. Therefore, considering the experimentally reported prospective reactants above, the change in total energy ΔEr (ΔEr = E(product) − E(reactants)) between the reactants and products was calculated to assess the thermodynamic stability. The following reaction pathway was assumed: 2(Cs2AgCrCl6) → 2(AgCl) + 4(CsCl) + 2(CrCl3). As such, our spin-polarized calculation yielded ΔEr values of −1.65 and −1.63 eV for cubic and hexagonal Cs2AgCrCl6, respectively, where the total energy E per formula unit of the reactants and product was used. This result indicates that the double perovskite systems investigated are much more stable than their constituent fragments, suggesting thermodynamic stability. We have also calculated ΔEr for the other four perovskite systems of the series assuming a similar reaction pathway (e.g., 2(A2AgCrCl6) → 2(AgCl) + 4(ACl) + 2(CrCl3) (A = Rb, K, Na, Li)). The ΔEr values were found to be −1.27 (−1.05) and −0.57 (−0.35) eV for cubic (hexagonal) Rb2AgCrCl6 and K2AgCrCl6, respectively, providing theoretical evidence of their thermodynamic stability. This was not the case, however, for the other two lighter members of the series since the ΔEr were found to be 1.78 (1.19) and 3.07 (0.82) eV for cubic (hexagonal) Na2AgCrCl6 and Li2AgCrCl6, respectively.
While there can be several different decomposing pathways, we have also examined the energies of the c-Cs2AgCrCl6 double perovskite and the fragments in the competing phases following the pathway (2(Cs2AgCrCl6) → Cs3Cr2Cl9 + 2AgCl + CsCl) to shed some light on the thermodynamic stability of Cs2AgCrCl6, where each subunit represents the formula unit. Our calculation gave a ΔEr of 0.36 eV for the reaction, indicating thermodynamic instability. The decomposition pathway is similar to what has been reported for other systems, viz. Cs2AgBiI6 (2(Cs2AgBiI6) → Cs3Bi2I9 + 2AgI + CsI)9a and MAPbI3 (MAPbI3 → MAI + PbI2),9b in which, these perovskite systems were found to be intrinsically unstable with respect to their respective phase separations. Savory and coworkers have demonstrated that whereas these latter systems might be synthesizable, they do suffer from instability issues in devices.9a The authors have also examined a number of such single perovskites (viz. MABX3, CsBX3 (B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br)) and have found that when I in MABI3 and CsBI3 is replaced by Br and Cl, the reactions become endothermic for all these systems regardless of the nature of DFT functionals employed (PBE and vDW), thereby leading to the interpretation that these systems have a lesser tendency for phase separation.
We have also calculated the relative energy stability ΔE between hexagonal and cubic A2AgCrCl6 using the following relation: ΔE = E(Fmm) − E(Rm), where E represents the total energy per unit formula of individual species. It was found that the Fmm geometry is slightly more stable than the Rm geometry for A = Cs, Rb, K. The stability trend was opposite when A = Na and Li. In other terms, the relative energies of cubic Cs2AgCrCl6, Rb2AgCrCl6, and K2AgCrCl6 were approximately −0.012, −0.109, and −0.107 eV greater than those of their corresponding Rm analogues, respectively. Similarly, the energies of cubic Na2AgCrCl6 and Li2AgCrCl6 were about 0.294 and 1.129 eV less than those of their corresponding Rm counterparts, respectively.
3.4 Density of states and band structure

Fig. 2 compares the orbital- and atom-projected partial DOS of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 with c-Rb2AgCrCl6, showing a virtually similar nature of their DOS. The data suggest that the Cs(5p/6s)/Rb(4p/5s) and Ag(5s) states are not responsible for the formation of the frontier bands (cf.Fig. 2a-a′ and b-b′). The eg (4dz2 and 4dx2−y2) and t2g (4dxy, 4dyz, and 4dzx) orbital states of Ag are contributing non-negligibly to the dispersion of the HOMO band (Fig. 2c-c′). The contributions from the 3p orbital states of Cl (Fig. 2d-d′) and the eg and t2g orbital states of Cr(3d) (Fig. 2e-e′ and f-f′, respectively) to the HOMO band are significant. They are collectively responsible for the dispersed HOMO band.

(g and g′) Comparison of the atom-projected partial and total DOS for the corresponding systems, respectively. The Fermi level EF is marked at 0 eV. The primitive unit-cell was used. 
The above view is consistent with the normalized orbital contributions calculated using each atom type, summarized in Table 4. (The details of how this was evaluated are given in Table S1 of the ESI† for c-Cs2AgCrCl6.) As can be seen, the HOMO and LUMO bands in the DOS plot (Fig. 2g-g′) are not purely of 3d states of Cr3+, as indicated elsewhere.21 In fact, the VBM is about 71.7–78.3% Cr(3d) character, and is mixed roughly with 19% 3p orbital states of Cl and 2.3–8.8% orbital states of Ag (4d). Apparently, changing the alkali atom at the A site of c-A2AgCrCl6 has a small effect on the VBM.
In contrast, the CBM is predominantly of Cr(3d) character (62–65%), with a non-negligible contribution from the orbital states of Cl(3p) (∼19–20%). Similar to the case of the VBM, the A-site cation contributes nothing to the CBM. A similar conclusion may be reached about the predominance of Cl/Cr energy states leading to the formation of the CBM and VBM, especially when conventional cell geometries were used for the evaluation of the DOS. The large occupancy of the 3d orbital is in line with the fact that the octahedral symmetry causes a split of the Cr3+ 3d-orbitals into t32ge0g, comprising of low-energy t2g triplet (dxy, dxz and dyz) and a high-energy eg doublet (dz2 and dx2−y2) states.

Fig. 3 compares the band dispersion of c-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, K) with h-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, K), showing that the bandgap transition between the VBM and CBM in the former is direct (Fig. 3a and b) and in the latter indirect (Fig. 3c and d). The bandgap transition is centered at the high symmetry X-valley for Fmm systems, and between the L- and F-valleys for Rm systems. Because the CBM and VBM are predominantly of metallic origin (Cr-centered orbitals), one would conclude that the bandgap transition predominantly involves metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT). A similar feature has also been observed for many double perovskites.3b,c
 Fig. 3  Comparison of the atom-projected band structure of c-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, K) with h-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, K). The primitive unit-cells were used. The tiny circles in red and green represent the CBM and VBM, respectively. k-Paths representing the Fmm and Rm space-groups were taken from Bilbao31a and seeK-path (Materials Cloud)31b crystallographic database servers, respectively. 
The calculated fundamental bandgaps Eg for c-A2AgCrCl6 were found to vary between 0.66 and 0.69 eV (Table 4). The Eg values for h-A2AgCrCl6 were between 0.93 eV (Cs2AgCrCl6) and 1.02 eV (Na2AgCrCl6). The small variation in Eg for each series suggests that the bandgap is nearly invariant with respect to the nature of alkali substitution at the A-site. In any case, our calculation did not give a secondary bandgap, as observed for cubic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6.52 For example, the two near (optical) bandgap transitions for Cs2AgBiBr6 were experimentally observed at energies of 1.917 eV and 2.054 eV.
The dispersive valence band of c-A2AgCrCl6 is doubly degenerate over the spin-up channels. From the parabolic fitting of the band edges,36,37 it was found that the mean effective mass of holes (mh*) is heavier along the X → Γ path than along the X → W path (Table 5). An exactly similar trend is observed for the spin-up electrons (me*) along these directions, associated with the CBM. For all cases, the hole mass is found is to be negative and the magnitude is larger than that of the electron. The negative sign is not unexpected as the hole moves opposite of the electron, and is ideal for most semiconductors.37 From the data in Table 5, it may also be said that the mobility of spin-up holes/electrons is reasonably slower along X → Γ than along the transport direction X → W. This insight was gained based on the simple Drude model53 that suggests that mobility is inversely proportional to the effective mass of the charge carrier. The dissimilar nature of charge carriers (see the ratio |mh*/me* (average)| in Table 5) may be typical with many semiconductors,54–58 for instance, PbTe, PbS, diamond, etc., for which the hole mobility is larger than the electron mobility.59

As discussed above, there is a slight variation in the perovskite stoichiometry caused by the A-site substitution in c-A2AgCrCl6. This leads to subtle changes in the lattice constants and band curvatures, with the latter reflected in the effective carrier masses. This is in accordance with the data in Table 5 that show a gradual decrease in both hole and electron masses as one passes from c-Cs2AgCrCl6 through c-Rb2AgCrCl6 to c-K2AgCrCl6 to c-Na2AgCrCl6 to c-Li2AgCrCl6. Note that the effective carrier masses of h-A2AgCrCl6 were not markedly different from those of c-Cs2AgCrCl6. For instance, mh* and me* were calculated to be −2.56 and 0.47m0 along the path L → Γ for h-Cs2AgCrCl6, respectively. These were −2.62 and 0.40m0 along the path F → Γ for h-Rb2AgCrCl6, respectively, showing that the mobility trend found between the holes and electrons of c-A2AgCrCl6 persists in h-A2AgCrCl6.
3.5 Optical properties

Fig. 4a depicts the plots of the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function ε(ω) for Cs2AgCrCl6, evaluated using k-mesh 8 × 8 × 8. Although a denser k-point mesh is often invoked for the calculation of accurate and fully converged dielectric function features,61–64 we have compared in Fig. 4b the plots of the dielectric function obtained using k-point meshes 8 × 8 × 8, 11 × 11 × 11 and 21 × 21 × 21. The graphs enable us to conclude that the transition peaks of the dielectric function obtained using a relatively small k-point mesh (8 × 8 × 8) are marginally affected.
 Fig. 4  (a) The dependence of the real and imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε1(ω) and ε2(ω), respectively) on the photon energy for cubic A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li), obtained with k-mesh 8 × 8 × 8. (b) The dependence of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) on the size of the k-mesh for c-Cs2AgCrCl6. (c) The dependence of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) on the photon energy for h-Rb2AgCrCl6, showing significant polarization along the z-direction. (d) Comparison of the average spectra of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) for c- and h-Rb2AgCrCl6 (k-mesh 8 × 8 × 8). The ε2(ω) region marked by an ellipse in (b) represents a shoulder, which might represent a spin-allowed transition (see text). 
From Fig. 4a, it is clear that the principal components of real and imaginary parts of the ε tensor were not anisotropic (i.e., ε(1)xx = ε(1)yy = ε(1)zz and ε(2)xx = ε(2)yy = ε(2)zz), which is expected of any cubic lattice. The imaginary part of the dielectric function, a measure of the extent of light absorption,40,64,65 shows a transition around 2.1 eV for c-Cs2AgCrCl6, but the absorption region is broad. There is also a weak shoulder in the ε2(ω) curve, appearing around 2.3 eV. This, together with the stronger peak at 2.1 eV, should be regarded as the spin-allowed transitions. While the weak transition is not very transparent in the ε2(ω) spectrum in Fig. 4b that was obtained using dense k-meshes, the first onset of absorption is observed roughly around 1.6 eV. This is not close to the non-SCF (direct) bandgap of 0.66 eV (Table 4), but is close to the SCF bandgap of 1.83 eV.8c
Alkali substitution did not significantly change the positional occurrence of the transition peaks. The weak peaks were observed at energies in the range from 2.3 to 2.4 eV, whereas the strong peaks were observed at energies around 2.1 eV. In all cases, the onset of absorption lies between 1.5 and 1.6 eV. This may mean that the optical characteristics do not depend on the perovskite nature of A2AgCrCl6. Rather, these depend on the nature of the atomic compositions involved. The marginal change in the shape, peak position and height due to alkali substitution is concordant with the nature of the variation of the fundamental bandgaps summarized in Table 4 for c-A2AgCrCl6. Note that we have recently examined the A2AgCrBr6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) and Cs2AgCrX6 (X = Cl, I) systems that have double perovskite compositions.8c Their physical, electronic, bandgap, and optical properties were explored on their respective conventional cells. The study did not consider band unfolding to provide an accurate view on the nature of the band structure and charge carriers, yet the dielectric spectra reported using the conventional cell of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 are in decent agreement with that shown in Fig. 4a.
Nevertheless, the nature of the bandgap transitions illustrated in Fig. 4 matches reasonably well with those observed in the UV/Vis/NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum of hexagonal Cs2AgCrCl6.21 In particular, these transitions were observed at energies of 1.6 and 2.2 eV, respectively. It was argued that these are characteristic of d–d transitions, arising basically from the octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ ions in weak ligand fields of the Cl ions. Such absorption bands were also observed at 565 and 800 nm (1.55 and 2.2 eV, respectively) in the corresponding spectrum of Cr3+ doped Cs2AgInCl6, and were attributed to the Cr3+ d–d transitions of 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2, respectively.22 Our results presented in Fig. 4b clearly suggest that the use of a denser k-point mesh may not always be necessary to infer accurately the characteristics of the important absorption peaks of c-Cs2AgCrCl6.

Fig. 4c depicts the dielectric spectrum of h-Rb2AgCrCl6. Its nature is almost the same as that found for the remaining members of the series h-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, K, Na, Li). It shows the anisotropic nature of the principal components of both ε1 and ε2 (i.e., ε(1)xx = ε(1)yy ≠ ε(1)zz and ε(2)xx = ε(2)yy ≠ ε(2)zz). The zz polarization is remarkably large, which contributes significantly to the dielectric function. Although the resonances in the spectrum are weak, they were found around 1.7 and 2.3 eV, respectively, which are close to that reported experimentally.21 That is, the bandgap transition energies for h-Cs2AgCrCl6 were observed at 1.6 and 2.2 eV, respectively.21Fig. 4d compares the average spectra of ε(1) and ε(2) of c-Rb2AgCrCl6 with h-Rb2AgCrCl6.
The zero-limit of the real part of the dielectric constant, ε∞,60,66 is calculated to be 5.1 and 4.2 for c-Rb2AgCrCl6 and h-Cs2AgCrCl6, respectively, and is virtually affected upon alkali substitution at the A-site. The experimentally measured frequency-dependent dielectric function is not known; thus our results cannot be directly comparable. However, our ε∞ for A2AgCrCl6 may be comparable with that of CsGeI3 (ε∞ = 5.0)68 and MAPbI3 (4.0 < ε∞ < 7.1),69 showing that the electronic contribution to the frequency-dependent dielectric function is not insignificant. Since the ionic contribution to the relative dielectric constant67a,b and the extent of its difference with respect to the high-frequency dielectric constant were not assessed in this study, it would rather be difficult to provide views on whether polarons would be formed in these materials leading to the determination of their photovoltaic efficiencies.70,71
The absorption coefficient, Tauc and reflectivity plots for c-A2AgCrCl6 are shown in Fig. 5, in which the former and latter properties were calculated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively. These plots convey transition features that replicate the resonance peaks of dielectric spectra shown in Fig. 4a. While the Tauc plot reflects the rise of the absorption feature starting around the fundamental bandgap, the plot in Fig. 5a shows that the absorption coefficient of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 is indeed large compared to that of the widely investigated chalcogenide thin-film photovoltaic absorbers CIGS, CdTe, and CZTS in the visible region (1.5–3.0 eV) of large solar irradiance.64,65 The replacement of the Cs cation with lighter alkali cations in c-Cs2AgCrCl6 slightly increases the absorption coefficient. For instance, the highest absorption coefficient of c-Cs2AgCrCl6 in the region 1.5–3.5 eV is 3.2 × 105 cm−1, whereas that of c-Rb2AgCrCl6, c-K2AgCrCl6 and c-Li2AgCrCl6 is 3.6 × 105 cm−1, 3.7 × 105 cm−1, and 3.9 × 105 cm−1, respectively. Polycrystalline films of (CH3NH3)2SnI6 have a direct bandgap of 1.81 eV, with a strong absorption coefficient of ∼7 × 104 cm−1.72

The photoconductivity σ(ω) spectrum was calculated using the relationship , where E is the energy of the light in eV, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum in C2 N−1 m−2, and e is the charge of an electron in Coulombs.73Fig. 6a depicts the σ(ω) plot for c-A2AgCrCl6. The nature of the photoconductivity curve, as well as the peak positions, for Cs2AgCrCl6 is not indifferent from that calculated for the other members of the series. The σ(ω) spectrum is also similar to the imaginary part of the dielectric function and absorption coefficient spectra depicted in Fig. 4a and 5a, respectively. This is logical given that σ(ω) is calculated using ε2.

The plots of the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index are shown in Fig. 6b. They were calculated using eqn (3) and (4), respectively. It is obvious from the plot that the maximum value of n lying between 2.9 (c-Cs2AgCrCl6) and 3.1 (c-Li2AgCrCl6) is centered at an energy around 2.0 eV, whereas the minimum of n is around 1.6. The zero-limit of n is approximately 2.25 and 2.00 for c-A2AgCrCl6 and h-A2AgCrCl6, respectively, and is consistent with the corresponding nature of ε∞ discussed already above. Such appreciable values of n over the spectral region below 4.5 eV suggest that A2AgCrCl6 is opaque against light. This, together with the very low extinction coefficient κ at the first onset (Fig. 6b), indicates that A2AgCrCl6 represents a series of lead-free optical semiconductors that might be suitable for device applications. For planar CH3NH3PbI3, n was 2.611 at 1.96 eV. This feature has enabled Löper et al. to suggest that CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells are ideally suited for the top cell in monolithic silicon-based tandem solar cells.74 Similar demonstrations have been provided for other halide perovskites.75
3.6 Phonon features: nature of dynamical stability
The phonon band structure and (total) phonon density of states of Fmm and Rm A2AgCrCl6 were examined using linear response density functional perturbation theory39 and the finite difference method (FDM).76 To evaluate the finite size effects77 on the nature of phonon dispersion, we used a number of geometries including the primitive unit-cell, conventional unit-cell and the 2 × 2 × 2 super-cell of the former for c-Cs2AgCrCl6. These consisted of 10, 40 and 80 atoms, respectively, which were used individually to build and calculate the dynamical matrix of the Fmm structure of Cs2AgCrCl6. For Rm Cs2AgCrCl6, the conventional cell comprising 60 atoms was used for the said purpose. Similarly, for c- and h-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Rb, K, Na, Li), the dynamical matrices were constructed using their respective primitive- and conventional-cells, meaning that these cell geometries were utilized for the evaluation of the second derivative of energy with respect to the atomic displacements. We used k-mesh 4 × 4 × 4 for sampling the Brillouin zone in the reciprocal space for the primitive, conventional and supercell structures for Fmm lattices, and k-mesh 3 × 3 × 1 for h-A2AgCrCl6. The kinetic energy cut-offs for the plane wave were 520 eV, with a tightly converged electronic wavefunction (within 10−8 eV). FDM accounted for the only symmetry inequivalent displacements of ions, together with SCAN-rVV10, to compute forces. Both VASP and Phonopy78,79 software were used.
From the phonon band structures and DOS illustrated in Fig. 7a, it is apparent that the Fmm structure of Cs2AgCrCl6 is dynamically stable. This applies regardless of the cell-type and computational approaches utilized. Our claim is based on the fact that there is no soft phonon mode (negative frequency) associated with the acoustic and optical phonons at the zone-center and across the zone boundary. A similar stability feature was obtained when the conventional cell was used (not shown), suggesting that there was no self-interaction of the displaced atom with respect to itself for the supercell used (Fig. 7). Since the primitive cell of c-A2AgCrCl6 contains 10 atoms, each system comprises 30 phonon modes. Of these, three are typically acoustic modes with frequencies close to zero. In fact, our calculations yielded three degenerate acoustic modes at a frequency of 0.02 THz. The use of the 40-atom conventional cells has resulted in a large number of optical modes, thereby causing the phonon dispersion denser. Nevertheless, and in all cases, the longitudinal and transverse acoustic modes are stable throughout the Brillouin zone path, with the minimum found at the center of the zone (Γ-point). Interestingly, the above nature of the phonon modes across the Brillouin zone is not the same as that found for h-Cs2AgCrCl6 and for other members of the same series. This is because there were several soft modes throughout the Brillouin zone, especially at the L- and F-points, leading to the conclusion that h-Cs2AgCrCl6 and its sister analogues are dynamically unstable.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of FDM level phonon dispersion and total phonon density of states (a.u.) of Fmm Cs2AgCrCl6 with that of Rb2AgCrCl6, obtained using the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell geometries constructed of their respective primitive cells. 
As explained above, systematic replacement of the A-site cation with four other light elements of the alkali-group (one type at a time) results in the critical lattice strain exhibited by GII and τ (Table 3). A result of this is that c-Rb2AgCrCl6 was still found to be dynamically stable (Fig. 7b), but the low-frequency optical modes are shallow near the center of the zone. These modes are likely to be affected by external agencies such as temperature and pressure. The above features are not the same for the remaining three systems of the series. This is because soft phonon modes have appeared for all of them. These modes became prominent when the lattice changed its properties from perovskite to non-perovskite (largely distorted). For example, soft mode occurs at frequencies of approximately −44.2, −49.6, −67.3 and −68.2 cm−1 for K2AgCrCl6. Several such modes were found between −13.0 and −102.1 cm−1 for Na2AgCrCl6. The imaginary modes seen at the zone boundaries are clearly the result of instability caused by sub-lattice mismatches and are a common feature of halide-based perovskite structures.80–83 These have been linked with anti-ferroelectric distortions caused by rotations and/or tiling of the octahedra in neighboring unit cells.84 It is worth noting that our phonon calculations were performed within the harmonic approximation. Obviously, the effect of anharmonicity on the eigenmodes at the center of the Brillouin zone has not been investigated, so it is not possible to speculate how it will contribute to explain the stability of the A2AgCrCl6 (A = K, Na, Li) lattices investigated.
4. Conclusion
This study examined the physical and optical properties of the series c-A2AgCrCl6 using SCAN-rVV10. The combined analysis of the geometrical indices, including the octahedral factor μ, Goldschmidt's tolerance factor t, and the newly proposed tolerance factor τ, has enabled us to demonstrate that the first three members of the series, c-A2AgCrCl6 (A = Cs, Rb, K), possess stable perovskite stoichiometry. Both μ and t recognized c-Na2AgCrCl6 to possess a perovskite structure, but the new tolerance factor τ rejected such a possibility.18 On the other hand, c-Li2AgCrCl6 was found to be a significantly unstable distorted perovskite structure. These conclusions were in agreement with that inferred from the Global Instability Index GII, and the application of this index, together with τ, may be regarded superior over t and μ in detecting the perovskite nature of unknown ABX3 and A2B′B′′X6 systems. Although h-Cs2AgCrCl6 was recently synthesized, it was found to be energetically less stable than its cubic counterpart.
In addition, we have shown that all the five Fmm systems, c-A2AgCrCl6, exhibit nearly identical electronic and optical characteristics, which are reminiscent of any semiconducting material. In particular, we have shown that they display similar transition features in the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, conductivity, and refractive index spectra. Alkali substitution did not significantly change the magnitude of the bandgap, although it has populated and/or depopulated the occupancies of specific (orbital) energy states responsible for the development of the dispersed VBM. The effective masses of spin-up charge carriers were small, which led to the suggestion that c-A2AgCrCl6 possesses high mobility. The magnitude and direct nature of the bandgap revealed with the meta-GGA functional and the optical transition features revealed using DFPT for c-Cs2AgCrCl6 were in good agreement with the experiment. The Rm Cs2AgCrCl6 perovskite and its sister analogues had similar properties with indirect bandgaps, but were found to be dynamically unstable. Among the lattices investigated, the cubic Cs2AgCrCl6 and Rb2AgCrCl6 double perovskites were shown to be dynamically (phonon) stable within the harmonic approximation, thus welcoming experimentalists for their subsequent synthesis and characterization.
