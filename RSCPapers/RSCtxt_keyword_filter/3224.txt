    , Accepted 25th August 2021First published on 26th August 2021AbstractIn the last decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the lab-scale has reached an incredible level of 25.5%. Generally, PSCs are composed of a stack consisting of a perovskite thin-film sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole transporting layer (HTL). Although the quality of the ETL and HTL interfaces with the perovskite thin-film is important, the quality of the perovskite thin-film is also critical to achieving high-performance PSCs. Low-temperature deposition of organic–inorganic perovskite thin-films by simple solution processes is one of the significant advantages of PSCs compared to other well-developed semiconductors for manufacturing solar cells. However, growing highly uniform and crystalline solution-processed perovskite thin-films is very challenging due to multiple phenomena during film formation, including solvent evaporation, wetting effects, inhomogeneous film stress and uncontrolled nucleation and growth. Therefore, understanding the different stages of perovskite crystallization is critical for achieving high-quality films and realizing higher PCEs. On the other hand, switching to large-scale solar modules leads to a substantial loss in performance, decreasing the chance of commercialization of this technology. Therefore, developing large-scale deposition techniques for reliable perovskite crystallization is very vital for scaling up PSCs. So far, several solution-processed methods such as anti-solvent and two-step processes have been developed for lab-scale perovskite thin-films deposition. However, these methods are not applicable for large-scale perovskite deposition. This review explores various scalable solution-processed perovskite deposition techniques. Moreover, different solvent quenching techniques as the most critical step of large-scale perovskite crystallization are discussed to provide a comprehensive view for achieving high-quality perovskite thin-films with large areas. Finally, the existing challenges and opportunities to push forward the commercialization of PSCs are discussed.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites exhibit interesting properties, such as long carrier diffusion length, large absorption coefficient, and low exciton binding energy. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in lab-scale has increased from 3.8% to 25.5% in just one decade due to improvements in device structure via various techniques such as compositional engineering, morphological control of the thin-film, charge transport layers optimization, defect passivation, and interface modification. However, despite tremendous performance achievements in small-scale PSCs (∼0.1 cm2), large-scale processed PSCs still lag behind other well-developed PV technologies such as silicon (Si) PV or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). The success of large-scale processed PSCs is highly dependent on achieving cost-effective deposition of high-quality perovskite thin-films, especially through solution processes. This review discusses the recent developments in scalable solution-processed perovskite deposition techniques, including blade, slot-die, spray coating, and inkjet printing, focusing on nucleation and crystal growth fundamentals for fabricating high-quality perovskite thin-films. Moreover, the existing challenges and opportunities to push forward the scale-up of PSCs are discussed. Finally, an outlook and the state-of-the-art performance charts for large-scale PSCs are presented.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskites have emerged as interesting optoelectronic materials due to their exceptional optical and electronic properties such as long carrier diffusion length, large absorption coefficient, and low exciton binding energy.1–4 In 2009, Miyasaka et al. reported the first perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.3 Afterwards, tremendous efforts have been made to optimize different parts of PSCs by compositional engineering,5,6 morphological modulation of the thin-film,7,8 charge transport layers optimization,9–12 defect passivation,13–15 and interface modification,16,17 reaching a PCE of up to 25.5% in one decade.18,19 The key advantage of PSCs compared to other well-developed photovoltaic (PV) technologies such as silicon (Si) PV is their solution processability by facile and cost-effective methods. Moreover, PSCs have achieved the top position among emerging PVs such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs),20,21 quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs)22,23 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).24–31 However, despite these tremendous achievements in this short period, there are still many issues to be solved for application in both academia and industry, such as lead toxicity,32 and moisture,33–37 thermal,38,39 light,40 and performance41,42 instabilities.
Thermal evaporation and solution-processing have been investigated as the most common methods for perovskite thin-film fabrication over the years.43 Although the thermal evaporation method presents a set of advantages such as the possibility of multilayer perovskite deposition, and solvent- and annealing-free processing, the PCEs of the fabricated PSCs using this method still lag behind those of solution-processed PSCs.44 Inexpensive integration in a laboratory environment without the need for complex vacuum systems, simple processing, and the possibility of introducing additives into the perovskite ink are the key advantages of the solution-processed method, making it a popular method for fabricating high-quality perovskite thin-films.45 Moreover, this method promises low-cost production for industrialized large-scale fabrication of PSCs.46
The morphology and crystallinity of perovskite thin-films play a vital role in determining the efficiencies of PSCs.47,48 It is widely acknowledged that obtaining a uniform, large grain sized, dense and pinhole-free perovskite thin-film is essential to minimize structural defects and achieve high PCEs.49,50 Therefore, fully understanding the crystallization process is very important to develop highly efficient PSCs.
Another issue affecting the PCEs of PSCs is perovskite composition. In principle, the perovskite precursor for the solution-processed method can be easily prepared by precisely weighing chemical powders followed by dissolving in appropriate solvents. However, unintentional deficit or excess of the precursor components may lead to changing the stoichiometry of the perovskite solution, resulting in significant variations in the perovskite thin-film properties and PCE of the fabricated PSCs subsequently.51 Therefore, controlling perovskite composition also is very important to develop high-performance solution-processed PSCs.
On the other hand, the record efficiencies predominately were achieved by solution-processed spin-coated perovskite thin-films in laboratory fabricated small-scale PSCs (∼0.1 cm2),18,19 which are not suitable for commercialization and lag behind other well-developed PV technologies such as silicon (Si) PV or copper indium gallium selenide.52 Therefore, the scalability of PSCs should be considered as an important issue for further development of this technology. In this regard, efforts have been made to scaling up perovskite thin-films in the past few years.52,53
As shown in Scheme 1, besides the spin coating method, well-developed large-scale deposition techniques such as blade coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing and spray coating have been developed for perovskite thin-film deposition, which is very promising as the roll-to-roll manufacturing processes for upscaling the perovskite PV technology via printing methods. However, despite the impressive progress of perovskite thin-film deposition by these techniques, the PCEs of large-scale deposited PSCs are lower than those of small area devices. Providing a fine and homogeneous perovskite thin-film formation is one of the critical challenges in large-scale deposition techniques to reduce series resistance and increase shunt resistance, thereby improving the PSC performance.

In this review, we summarize recent developments in scalable solution-processed perovskite deposition techniques, including blade coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing and spray coating, focusing on perovskite crystallization. Moreover, the existing challenges and opportunities to push forward the commercialization of PSCs will be discussed. Specifically, different perovskite crystallization protocols such as hot-casting, gas quenching, and vacuum extraction will be carefully addressed for large-scale deposition techniques, focusing on the challenges for achieving dense and uniform perovskite thin-films. Additionally, new lab-scale perovskite thin-film processing approaches compatible with upscaling technologies will be discussed. Finally, we provide an outlook and the state-of-the-art performance charts for the large-scale deposition techniques.
2. Perovskite crystallization
Archiving high-quality perovskite thin-films is highly related to completely understanding the nucleation and crystal growth steps of perovskite crystallization, enabling the modulation of perovskite thin-film morphology in small area devices and large area solar modules. In the last decade, various solution-processed perovskite thin-films have been investigated by spin coating techniques. As shown in Scheme 2, one-step, two-step, and antisolvent methods have been used frequently for perovskite thin-film deposition.43 Firstly, a one-step method was used for perovskite thin-film processing, which deposits the premixed all perovskite precursors onto the substrate following thermal annealing.43 Unfortunately, obtaining a uniform and pinhole-free perovskite thin-film using this method is very difficult due to uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth. As a result, a two-step method was introduced as an alternative approach for perovskite deposition, which deposits a PbI2 precursor in the first step, followed by the deposition of organic cations in the second step by dipping the PbI2 film into an organic cation precursor solution54,55 or by spin coating this solution onto the PbI2 film.56 Although the two-step method showed great potential to achieve high-performance PSCs, the perovskite thin-films fabricated using this method faced some challenges such as a rough morphology and incomplete PbI2 conversion to perovskite. In 2016, the antisolvent method (solvent engineering approach) was introduced by the Seok group,57 which remains the most common approach in the perovskite community to date, and the best small-scale PSC efficiencies were achieved using this method. In this method, perovskite precursor is deposited in one step onto a substrate; however, an antisolvent is applied during the spin coating process to promote perovskite crystallization more efficiently.
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the most common solution-processing methods for perovskite thin-film deposition. 

Scheme 3a presents a summary of the different stages of crystallization in the antisolvent method. Firstly, in step ①, perovskite ink should be carefully prepared according to the bandgap target by changing the stoichiometry of different elements of the general ABX3 perovskite formula, which consists of B (central metal ions; Pb2+ or Sn2+), X (halides atoms; Cl−, Br− or I−) and A (cations MA+, FA+ or Cs+). In step ②, perovskite ink is deposited on a charge transport layer coated-TCO (transparent conductive oxide) glass using the spin coating technique. By drop-casting the antisolvent onto the wet perovskite thin-film during spin coating, the primary solvent of perovskite ink is extracted or quenched, resulting in the acceleration of the nucleation process (steps ③ and ④). Chlorobenzene (CB), toluene and anisole are the mostly used antisolvents in this method and have a lower polarity than perovskite ink solvents, e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the annealing step (⑤) will facilitate the crystal growth, resulting in formed crystalline perovskite thin-films.
 Scheme 3  (a) Schematic illustration of the typical steps of perovskite crystallization in the antisolvent method. (b) The LaMer model of nucleation and crystal growth.53 
It is well accepted that the quality of the perovskite thin-films is highly dependent on controlling the nucleation and growth rates, i.e. steps ④ and ⑤, which are in direct relationship to the precursor concentration and induce supersaturation in wet films. The LaMer diagram qualitatively explains the variation of the precursor concentration as a function of time (Scheme 3b).53 As it can be seen, due to the evaporation of the perovskite ink solvent, the concentration of the perovskite precursor is increased in the wet film, reaching a saturation concentration (Cs) at a certain time (t1). However, nucleation will be started when the precursor concentration is increased to a critical point (Cc) at a certain time t2, by overcoming the energy barrier of nucleation. Crystal growth will be started at a higher concentration than Cc, along with nucleation. Faster perovskite solvent evaporation leads to increased supersaturation, increasing the nucleation rate and density (more nuclei); therefore, antisolvent could help a lot in this regard. The precursor concentration decreases and finally drops below Cc by evaporating the solvent and consuming the solute by crystal growth. After this stage, nucleation will be stopped entirely, but grains will continuously grow until the concentration drops below Cs, resulting in formed final perovskite thin-films. Altogether, given the crucial role of high-quality perovskite thin-films in achieving high-performance PSCs, developing reliable and repeatable crystallization processes is necessary for large-scale processing as well.
3. Large-scale processing of perovskite thin-films
The fabrication of pinhole-free, compact, and continuous perovskite thin-films is essential for upscaling and roll-to-roll PSC production, which can be realized by controlling the nucleation and growth steps in different deposition methods. This section will focus on the state-of-the-art most critical large-scale processes such as blade coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing, and spray coating for perovskite thin-film deposition. Moreover, we discuss the mechanism of perovskite crystallization in these methods to achieve high-quality perovskite thin-films, focusing on solvent quenching of perovskite ink, including physical approaches, such as hot casting, gas quenching, and vacuum quenching, and chemical approaches, such as compositional engineering, additive engineering, and solvent engineering.
3.1. Blade coating
Blade coating or knife coating is a facile, cost-effective and compatible deposition method with the potential of upscaling and roll-to-roll processing of thin-films.58,59 In this method, a certain amount of ink solution is poured in front of the blade, which moves over the substrate at a specific speed.60 With the emerging of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials as a new solution processing photovoltaic thin-film technology, the blade coating method has attracted significant attention for the upscaling of this class of solar cells, owing to its easy compatibility with a wide variety of perovskite compositions, substrates and device structures.61–64
In the blade coating method, the thickness and quality of perovskite thin-films can be controlled by changing the blade and substrate distance, solvent quenching strategy, swiping speed, substrate wettability, the shape of the blade, and ink concentration.61,65 Firstly, Deng et al. reported the MAPbI3 perovskite thin-film deposition by the blade coating method.61 They controlled the thickness of the perovskite thin-film by tuning the ink stoichiometry, i.e. the methylammonium iodide (MAI):PbI2 ratio, and the substrate's temperature, leading to a PCE of 15.1%.
It has been demonstrated that solvent quenching is the main parameter that controls perovskite nucleation and crystallization, thus contributing to the best film morphology.61,65 As mentioned in Section 2, fast supersaturation and nucleation, followed by slow crystallization, are essential to forming pinhole-free, uniform, and continuous perovskite thin-films.66,67 The quick solvent extraction or solvent quenching can be controlled by physical methods such as hot casting,67–70 gas quenching,63,71,72 and vacuum quenching60,73–77 or chemical methods such as compositional engineering,64,66,69,78–80 additive engineering and solvent engineering6,8,13,17,20,23,25–29 or a combination thereof.69–75,78,80–82 We discuss the state-of-the-art solvent quenching strategies for achieving the best perovskite crystallization by the blade coating method.
Typically, the hot casting approach speeds up the film's drying rate, accelerating the nucleation step and promoting the perovskite crystallization step during the solution-to-solid phase conversion.83 As shown in Fig. 1a, when the substrate temperature (80–100 °C) is less than the boiling point (BP) of perovskite ink solvent (i.e. DMF with a BP of 153 °C), solvent quenching takes a long time of up to 2 h, leading to a non-uniform needle-like morphology with low PCEs of ∼10%.84,85 On the other hand, the long heating time is not cost- and time-effective, thus undesirable for roll-to-roll film production. Therefore, to bypass this limitation, a hot casting process at elevated temperatures67–69 or a combination of the hot casting process and chemical methods (compositional, additive and solvent engineering)64,66,69,75,78,81,82,86–88 have been considered. As shown in Fig. 1a, at higher temperatures >100 °C, the solvent evaporation rate will increase the supersaturation of the perovskite ink, inducing fast nucleation and slow crystallization, resulting in a PCE of 17.54% with an active area of 0.09 cm2 for heating the substrates at 150 °C.67

It should be considered that during the hot casting process, some of the volatile organic components of MAPbI3 perovskite tend to decompose into PbI2, CH3NH2I and HI compounds, which creates defect states in the final films.91 Hence, balancing the hot casting temperature and chemical composition of perovskite materials is very important for achieving a high-quality perovskite thin-film without decomposition using the blade coating process. Therefore, formulation64,66,69 and additive engineering64,72,75,78,81,82,86,87 of perovskite ink can positively affect the morphology and stability of perovskite thin-films during hot casting solvent quenching. In this regard, Deng et al. demonstrated that by replacing some portion of MA with formamidinium (FA) cations (i.e. MAPbI3 to FA0.4MA0.6PbI3), the PCE of the blade-coated perovskite thin-film with hot-casted solvent quenching at 145 °C during the swiping step increased from 16.9% to 18.3%.66 In another study, Huang et al. added a small amount of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (LP) to the MAPbI3 perovskite ink to change the fluid drying dynamics, to improve the wettability of the perovskite ink on polytriarylamine (PTAA), as well as passivate perovskite thin-film defects.86 Subsequently, the hot-casted blade-coated perovskite thin-film at 145 °C demonstrated PCEs of 20% and 14.6% for a small area of 0.075 cm2 and a perovskite module aperture area of 57.2 cm2, respectively. Later, this research group81 used the strategy with a more efficient additive, i.e. phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl), to increase the solvent removal rate, passivate the defect states and improve the Cs0.05FA0.70MA0.25PbI3 perovskite thin-film quality, leading to a PCE of 22% for a cell area of 0.08 cm2 (Fig. 1b).
Besides, the dry air or N2 gas-assisted quenching method has been introduced to extract solvents from the as-coated wet film within a few seconds. In this method, an air knife moves with the blade simultaneously and blows the gas on the wet perovskite thin-film to quench the ink solvent and consequently induce fast nucleation.89,92,93 Moreover, after gas blowing, a post-annealing process is needed to ensure the complete liquid-to-solid conversion.63,71,72,89,92 In this regard, Hue et al. conducted a study using N2 gas-assisted quenching to fabricate high quality, pinhole-free Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite thin-films (Fig. 1d), followed by post-annealing at 105 °C for 60 min, reporting a PCE of 20.26% for a 0.06 cm2 PSC.89 Later, Chen et al. developed perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells on textured silicon films,72 provided by N2 gas-assisted blade-coated Cs0.1MA0.9Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 perovskite at room temperature, followed by post-annealing at 70 °C for 10 min and then at 100 °C for 15 min, reaching a PCE of 26% for ∼0.08 cm2 efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (Fig. 1d). Particularly, to evaluate the promising scalability of the gas quenching method, Dai et al. blade-coated MAPbI3 on flexible substrates by employing N2 gas to remove the residual perovskite ink solvent.63 Nevertheless, a small amount of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was added to the perovskite ink to form hydrogen bonds with PbI2, retarding perovskite nucleation and enabling the growth of a smooth, compact perovskite thin-film from the bottom to top. As a result, PCEs of 19.72% and 15.86% were achieved for flexible solar cells with the areas of 0.08 cm2 and 42.9 cm2, respectively.
Vacuum quenching is another innovative approach to reach the supersaturation level quickly by removing the perovskite ink solvent effectively (Fig. 1e).73–76 Notably, this method was able to deposit the uttermost crystalline perovskite thin-films with a shiny-surface at a high humidity level of >70% within a short time of 30 s,73,74 resulting in achieved PCEs of 10.1% and 15.1% for vacuum-assisted blade-coated MAPI3 and CS0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(Pb0.17I0.83)3 PSCs with an active area of 0.1 cm2, respectively, which were reported by Parvazian et al. Remarkably, Hu et al. utilized this method to deposit 2D/3D stable perovskite thin-films, leading to high PCEs of 20.14% and 15.38% for a small area and module PSCs with active areas of 0.09 cm2 and 10.08 cm2, respectively.75
Solvent engineering of perovskite ink has been highlighted as an efficient approach to tuning the crystallization in the blade coating method by combining solvents with different boiling points to control the solvent quenching process directly.6,8,13,17,32,39,43,47 Unfortunately, as the most common solvent of perovskite inks, DMF has a high vapour pressure (VP) of 2.6 mmHg at 20 °C, which can quickly evaporate during or after blade coating perovskite thin-films.81,88 Therefore, employing high boiling point and low vapor pressure solvents/co-solvents such as DMSO (BP = 189 °C; VP = 0.42 mmHg), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (BP = 202 °C; VP = 0.3 mmHg at 20 °C) and GBL (BP = 204 °C; VP = 1.5 mmHg at 20 °C) has been recommended.62,68,81,86,88 Furthermore, Yang et al. utilized a mixture of DMSO:DMF (9:8 v-v) and NMP:DMF (9:1 v-v) to prolong the timing window of the wet film stage from seconds to 2 min and 8 min, respectively. As a result, the fabricated PSCs showed 19% and 13.3% performances for the small and large areas of 0.12 cm2 and 11.06 cm2, respectively.81 Interestingly, due to the difference in the thermal convection flow direction of DMSO and GBL, their mixture can reduce the surface tension of MAPbI3 ink, inducing smooth perovskite thin-films with larger grains and lower defect densities.62,88 As a consequence, Lee et al. attained high quality blade-coated MAPbI3 films with DMSO:GBL (9:1 v-v) ink solvent, achieving PCEs of 17.55% and 13.03% for 0.16 cm2 and 10.56 cm2 cell areas, respectively (Fig. 1f).62 2-Methoxy ethanol (2-ME) with a BP of 124 °C and acetonitrile (ACN) with a low BP of 82 °C have also been used as co-solvents with DMF and DMSO to reduce the drying time, introducing as an efficient way to deposit uniform and dense perovskite thin-films.90,94 Following this, Deng et al. used ACN/2-ME (6:4 v-v) with a tiny amount of highly coordinating DMSO as the solvent into the MAPbI3 perovskite ink.90 The N2 gas assisted blade-coated perovskite thin-films boosted the PCEs to 21.3% and 16.9% for a small area of 0.08 cm2 and a large area of 63.9 cm2 in a flexible mini-module PSC (Fig. 1g). However, PbI2 cannot be dissolved in pure ACN and 2-ME, confining their application as the main solvent of perovskite inks.94
In summary, rapid progress in improving device performance validates that blade coating perovskite thin-films can be considered as a suitable path towards upscaling technology. The main controllable parameter to obtain a highly crystalline, pinhole-free blade-coated perovskite thin-film is solvent quenching via various strategies, including hot casting, gas quenching, vacuum quenching, additive engineering, and solvent engineering. In addition, the literature reports show that the main challenges of controlling crystallization to obtain high-quality blade-coated perovskite thin-films can be considered as the non-uniform surface coverage and substrate wettability which can also be overcome by monitoring the blade geometry, the viscosity of the ink, substrate temperature and swiping speed. In terms of performance, blade-coated PSCs have shown PCEs more than 22% for small area and >15% for large area (42.9 cm2) solar cells so far.
3.2. Slot-die coating
Slot-die coating has been introduced as one of the most promising methods for roll-to-roll perovskite deposition95–97 and is similar to the blade coating method (Scheme 1).98–100 Typically, a continuous meniscus liquid spreads on the substrates uniformly utilizing a coating head in both methods. However, in the slot-die coating, the perovskite ink comes out from a thin slit between two pressed metal blocks of coating head, which is the only difference between these methods.101,102 Although slot-die coating consumes a bit more perovskite ink than the blade coating, the resulting perovskite thin-film has higher quality and reproducibility.103 Hwang et al. were the first group that used slot-die coating for perovskite thin-film deposition.104 They deposited PbI2 solution on ITO (indium tin oxide) glass/ZnO by this method followed by dipping in MAI solution to form MAPbI3 film, leading to a PCE of 11.96% with an active area of 0.1 cm2.
The thickness and morphology of the slot-die-coated perovskite thin-films strongly depend on the supplied ink concentration, meniscus size, and speed of the slot-die head.104–108 Similar to blade coating, solvent quenching plays a vital role in achieving uniform perovskite thin-films with adequate surface coverage. Physical quenching approaches such as hot casting102,109–115 and gas quenching,95,105,110 or chemical quenching approaches such as compositional, additive and solvent engineering95,116–120 have been frequently used for slot-die coating; however, a combination of physical and chemical quenching can be used as well.97,106,111,116 Here, we review the state-of-the-art perovskite deposition by slot-die coating.
Hot casting is typically considered as a promising solvent quenching approach to control thin-film quality in roll-to-roll processing. Similar to blade coating, at substrate temperatures below 100 °C, the solvent evaporation rate in the wet slot-die-coated perovskite thin-films is inefficient; as a result, a low surface coverage film with non-uniform grains will be formed (Fig. 2a).102,105 By increasing the substrate temperature to 100 °C, fast supersaturation, quick solvent evaporation, and rapid crystallization occurred, leading to the growth of perovskite grains swiftly and formation of some crystalline textures containing circular patterns (Fig. 2a).102,105,121 However, at substrate temperatures above 100 °C, the crystallisation rate will be reduced due to the quick diffusion of ink in the growth process, improving film morphology and decreased surface roughness.102,105,111 In this regard, Kim et al. demonstrated that 130 °C is the optimum substrate temperature for a high-quality slot-die-coated MA0.6FA0.38Cs0.02PbI2.975Br0.025 film, achieving a PCE of 14.6% with an active area of 0.1 cm2.102 Presently, Huang et al. reported that increasing the substrate temperature from 110 °C to 170 °C can improve the PCE of slot-die-coated MAPbI3 PSC from 1.6% to 14.9% with an active area of 0.09 cm2.111

Noticeably, to further accelerate the solvent-extraction rate, an additional air or N2 gas knife was implemented in the slot-die coating system, improving the surface coverage and morphology by confining the overgrown crystal formation.97,105,110,117,124–126 Furthermore, Gong et al. introduced a sequential roll-to-roll slot-die coating to prepare triple-cation mixed halide perovskite thin-films under ambient air.97 As shown in Fig. 2b, PbI2/CsI precursor solution was deposited onto flexible substrates by the microgravure printing method followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. In the second step, a cation mixture solution of FAI/MABr/MACl was coated on the PbI2/CsI films using a slot-die machine equipped with a N2 gas knife followed by post-annealing at 150 °C for 20 min (see Fig. 2b). Eventually, for flexible PSCs, a PCE of up to 10.57% was achieved for an active area of 0.07 cm2. In another study, Hu et al. used a 180 °C hot N2 gas for slot-die coating of MAPbI3 films without any post-annealing step, attaining PCEs of 15.1% and 11.6% for 0.09 cm2 and 1 cm2 cell areas.105
Additive engineering of perovskite inks, similar to the blade coating method, can effectively control the perovskite thin-film quality in the slot-die coating method.59,95,97,102,108,116–118,120,122,127,128 For example, Angmo et al. added a small amount of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (LP) as a surfactant to triple-cation mixed halide perovskite ink, for controlling the uniformity and enlargement of the perovskite grains up to 100 μm (Fig. 2c), achieving PCEs of 13.36% and 11.15% for rigid and flexible PSCs with a 0.1 cm2 active area, respectively.122 In another study, Zho et al. developed slot-die-coated MAPbI3 films using NH4Cl as the additive followed by N2 gas quenching, producing PCEs of 15% and 11.16% for rigid and flexible-based PSCs with an area of 0.1 cm2.118 The role of NH4Cl additive in perovskite ink has already been discussed in the blade coating part. Moreover, Xu et al. developed slot-die-coated MAPbI3 mini-module PSC by adding 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) to the perovskite ink.108 They demonstrated that 5-AVAI aids the capillary infiltration of perovskite ink into the mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon triple-layer, leading to PCEs of 15.27% for a small device area of 0.1 cm2 and 12.87% for 60.08 cm2 mini-module (Fig. 2d). Recently, Xu et al. fabricated high-quality slot-die-coated perovskite thin-films by incorporating potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) into the MAPbI3 ink to improve crystallization.129 The SCN− ions retard the nucleation step, leading to increased average grain sizes from 0.23 μm (pristine MAPbI3) to 11.2 μm (KSCN-modified MAPbI3). On the other hand, they demonstrated that K+ ions reduce the cation vacancies in perovskite thin-film, increasing the carrier lifetime from 0.16 μs to 1.89 μs. As a result, the PCE of a slot-die-coated KSCN-modified PSC was improved from 14.3% to 21.38% for an active area of 0.089 cm2. Very recently, Bu et al. used potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) as an additive to the FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 perovskite ink.120 KPF6 reduced trap-induced or nonradiative recombination by defect passivation. As a result, slot-die-coated solar minimodules showed PCEs of 20.42% and 19.54% for areas of 17.1 cm2 and 65.0 cm2, respectively.
Solvent engineering is another approach to further control perovskite crystallization and fabrication of high-quality perovskite thin-films by slot-die coating. So far, slot-die-coated perovskite thin-films with DMF:DMSO (9:1 v-v)130 and NMP:DMF (9:8 v-v)106 solvents showed a maximum PCE of ∼18%. Similar to other perovskite coating methods, fast solvent quenching and short drying times are essential to achieve a smooth and compact film via the slot-die coating method. To balance the solvent–extraction rate and crystallization timing window, mixing low BP solvents such as 2-ME and ACN with high BP solvents such as DMF and DMSO can remarkably improve the quality of coated perovskite thin-films.59,112,113,123,129,131 For example, Li et al. incorporated a small amount of DMSO in 2-ME as the primary solvent of MAPbI3 perovskite ink to fabricate a dense and continuous slot-die-coated perovskite thin-film. Nevertheless, N2 gas quenching was used to improve crystallization, achieving a PCE of 20.8% for an active area of 0.105 cm2.131 In another study, Subbiah et al. provided MAPbI3 ink solution in a mixture of ACN and methylamine (dissolved in methanol) (6:4 v/v)123 for better perovskite dissolution.59,94,123 The perovskite ink was slot-die-coated on substrates at 70 °C followed by post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min to ensure crystallization is completed, resulting in achieving a PCE of 18.1% for an active area of 0.1 cm2. Alternatively, they used LP as an additive to increase the perovskite ink wettability, leading to high PCEs of 21.8% and 14.4% for active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 6.8 cm2, respectively. Besides this, they also fabricated perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells on the textured silicon film by using this method, producing a promising PCE of 23.8% for a 1.0 cm2 device active area (Fig. 2e).
To summarize, the slot-die coating method can be considered as one of the most compatible methods to establish industrial and roll-to-roll deposition techniques. The coating process can be easily controlled by solvent quenching approaches such as hot casting, additive engineering, and solvent engineering. In terms of performance, slot-die-coated PSCs have exhibited PCEs over 21% and >14% on rigid and flexible substrates for small area and >19.0% for 65.0 cm2 mini-module PSCs. Similar to blade coating, in the slot-die coating method, the major challenges including nucleation and crystallization could be overcome by controlling the substrate temperature, meniscus size, and the speed of the slot-die head. Comparing to the blade coating method, consuming more ink is one disadvantage of slot-die coating method. But this method shows better performance and reproducibility for fabricating uniform and crystalline perovskite thin-films with good morphology.
3.3. Inkjet printing
Inkjet printing is a fast, facile, economic and material-efficient approach to form desired patterns and printed shapes for large-scale coating of thin-film photovoltaics.132–138 Originally, this coating technique is a digital management technology inspired by typical office printers. Based on ink droplet production, the inkjet printing technique could be classified into two main categories: continuous inkjet (CIJ) printing and drop-on-demand (DoD) printing (Fig. 3a).133 Compared to CIJ printing, DoD printing has negligible ink waste, which is beneficial and compatible for upscaling and commercialization.133 Since there is no report on CIJ printing in perovskite PV, we focus on the DoD printing method in this part. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the DoD printing machine comprises a printer nozzle, an ink reservoir, and a printing table. Regarding the performing mechanism, first, pushing forward the ink using a mechanical force from a piezoelectric transducer or resistive-heater; second, ejecting a certain amount of the ink from the nozzle to form droplets; third, spreading the ink over the substrate. It should be taken into account that printing with the aid of a resistive heater is material-consuming. In contrast, printing using a piezoelectric DoD printing machine is controllable over drop size and speed.133

Generally, controlling drop size is predominantly vital to attain smooth films with uniform thickness. Nevertheless, controlling the inject printing parameters such as ink concentration and viscosity, droplet spreading, droplet wetting behaviour, surface tension and roughness of the substrates, and solvent quenching of perovskite ink should be considered to achieve high-quality perovskite thin-films.83,99,133 As the first study on inkjet-printed perovskite thin-films, Wei et al. deposited MAI + Carbon ink via inkjet printing on spin-coated-PbI2 films to generate MAPbI3 films in a two-step deposition process, leading to a PCE of 11.6% for a 0.15 cm2 area.134
Similar to other large-scale deposition methods, rapid solvent quenching during film deposition and slowing down the crystallization rate are the crucial keys to achieving uniform films by the inkjet printing method.135 Accordingly, solvent quenching can be readily performed by physical methods such as hot casting134,136,141–143 and vacuum quenching132,137,139 or chemical methods such as compositional, additive and solvent engineering138,140,144–149 or a combination of physical and chemical processes.137,139,140,145,148
As mentioned in the previous parts, hot casting is an efficient approach to accelerate solvent quenching and rapid supersaturation, applicable for inkjet printing.132,136,137,142 Thus, Li et al. demonstrated that an optimized printing substrate temperature of 50 °C could speed up the solvent evaporation rate and achieve large MAPbI3 perovskite grains, exhibiting a PCE of 12.3% for a small area of 0.04 cm2.136 Very recently, Zhang et al. inkjet-printed MAPbI3−xClx films on a preheated substrate at 70 °C, followed by post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, to make a continuous and compact perovskite layer, producing a PCE of 16.64% for an active area of 0.1 cm2.150
Similarly, vacuum quenching can also quickly initiate nucleation by facilitating supersaturation, improving the quality of the inject-printed perovskite thin-films.137,140 During the vacuum process, ink solvent would evaporate swiftly, supersaturating the perovskite wet film and initiating the crystallization process.137 Mathies et al. used vacuum quenching to extract solvent from wet inject-printed perovskite thin-films, followed by a post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min under N2 flow, resulting in PCEs of 11.3% and 15.3% for MAPbI3140 and triple-cation mixed halide137 perovskite thin-films with a cell area of 0.09 cm2, respectively. Moreover, vacuum-assisted thermal annealing is another creative way to form the intermediate phase effectively, creating compact and uniform perovskite thin-films (Fig. 3b).139 Therefore, Liang et al. inkjet-printed MAPbI3 films139 by vacuum-assisted thermal annealing at 90 °C for 2 min, improving film quality and device performances, 17.04% and 13.27% for cell areas of 0.04 cm2 and 4.0 cm2, respectively.
Compositional engineering and additive engineering can effectively achieve high-quality perovskite thin-films by the inkjet printing method.144,145,150 For example, Chen et al. inkjet-printed numerous perovskite thin-films by tuning the perovskite ink composition (FAxMA1−xPbBryI3−y).145 The inkjet-printed MAPbBr0.75I2.25 and FA0.75MA0.25PbBr0.75I2.25 films on substrates at a temperature of 50 °C, followed by 20 min post-annealing at 110–150 °C, provided the PCEs of 9.48% and 7.31% on 0.08 cm2 cell areas, respectively. In a similar study, Gheno et al. inject printed MAI:PbCl2 (3:1) ink to make MAPbI3−xClx film, followed by post-annealing at 150 °C for 1 h, achieving a PCE of 10.7% for a small cell area of 0.08 cm2.151 So far, several groups have developed a mesoporous TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon structure by adding 5-AVAI into the MAPbI3 perovskite ink.138,146 Thus, Hashmi et al. inkjet-printed perovskite ink at 30 °C printing temperature.138 After printing, the perovskite thin-films were utilized in PSC devices to show a PCE of 8.47% for an area of 0.16 cm2. Generally, due to the fast solvent evaporation rate during printing, perovskite ink tends to clog the inkjet nozzle head.147–149 Therefore, solvent engineering of perovskite ink showed a great potential to minimize this major challenge by preventing agglomeration during printing and creating dense perovskite thin-films.136 Therefore, Li et al. prepared a triple-cation mixed halide perovskite ink with the DMF:NMP (1:1 v-v) solvent.135 However, it should be noted that a small amount of DMSO was added to perovskite ink to facilitate the formation of the intermediate phase and fabricate high-quality perovskite thin-films consequently. In fact, NMP with a high BP can significantly improve perovskite morphology by retarding the crystallization time by changing the viscosity and surface energy of perovskite ink (Fig. 3c). The vacuum-assisted inkjet-printed perovskite thin-films showed PCEs of 19.6% and 14.5% for areas of 0.04 cm2 and 4.04% cm2. Similarly, Eggers et al. prepared a triple-cation mixed halide perovskite ink with the DMF:DMSO:GBL (28:26:46 v-v:v) solvent to control the nucleation and crystallization of wet films.140 The vacuum-assisted inject-printed perovskite thin-films yielded PCEs of 21.6% and 10.6% for areas of 0.105 cm2 and 1.0 cm2, respectively (Fig. 3d). A year later, they applied this procedure to fabricate all inject-printed PSCs, including perovskite thin-film and charge transport layers, achieving PCEs of 15.3% and 12.3% for areas of 0.105 cm2 and 1.0 cm2, respectively.148
In short, inkjet printing is a suitable method to make patterns as small as 0.04 cm2 and large areas. Similar to the other large-scale deposition methods, solvent quenching approaches such as hot casting, vacuum quenching and solvent engineering are essential to control perovskite crystallization. Regarding performance, inkjet-printed PSCs have shown PCEs more than 21% for small area and 14.0% for 4.04 cm2 PSCs. In addition to physical and chemical methods to control the nucleation and crystallization, to realize a high crystalline perovskite thin-films by the inkjet printing method, considering some other critical challenges is necessary. The printing speed in inkjet printing is slower than other coating methods. The long printing process could lead to non-uniform perovskite thin-films. Also, applying antisolvent techniques is hard to control the crystallization. Utilizing vacuum-assisted process and thermal annealing posttreatment can be helpful to overcome these limitations. Moreover, finding the exact wetting behaviour of the ink is an important key to developing suitable inks. Also, to get a uniform film, ink dispersing can be controlled by nozzles and droplet size.
3.4. Spray coating
Spray coating is a solution-processed, material-conserving, non-contact, droplet-based deposition method (Fig. 4a), which is widely used for producing thin-film photovoltaics and PSCs in recent years.152–154 This method has four different stages, including, first, generating a steam of tiny droplets with the assistance of air or N2 carrier gas; second, transferring the droplets to the substrate by injecting a low-pressure gas stream; third, spreading the droplets over the substrate and then merging to create a wet film; fourth, evaporating the ink solvent and film crystallization.155 As the first study, Barrows et al. demonstrated the effect of substrate temperature and ink solvent volatility on crystallization and thickness of spray-coated MAPbI3−xClx film, achieving a PCE of 11% for a small area of 0.025 cm2.154

Similar to other mentioned scalable methods, controlling the ink concentration, viscosity, droplet size, surface tension, nozzle spray angle, scanning speed, applied electrical potential, and solvent quenching is vital to attain smooth, uniform and crystalline perovskite thin-films by the spray coating method.52,100 Almost similar to previous mass-production methods, in spray coating, perovskite crystallization is significantly affected by solvent quenching, which can be controlled by physical methods, including hot casting,154,157–159,166–176 vacuum quenching161,177,178 and rapid spray plasma processing,162,179 and chemical methods including compositional engineering163,164,178,180–186 and solvent engineering157,165,167,187–192 and/or a combination of both methods.158,160,164,177,178,192
In the spray coating method, hot casting, including deposition and post-annealing temperatures, can determine the solvent removal rate and perovskite crystallization. This approach is usually performed at a temperature in the range of 30–90 °C; however, deposition temperature is strongly affected by other parameters such as the solvent and solutes of the perovskite ink. At low deposition temperatures (<30 °C), due to the slow evaporation rate and dewetting of the substrate, a discontinuous film with a low surface coverage will be formed.158,166,167 At high deposition temperatures (>90 °C), the substrate wetting is short, and due to swift solvent evaporation, the incomplete merging and drying of droplets will happen before reaching the substrate (Fig. 4b and c).156–159,166,167,176 In Fig. 4b, the deposition temperature is 70 °C while the post-annealing temperature is between 90 and 130 °C for 30 min157 and in Fig. 4c the deposition temperature is varied from 20 to 60 °C with the post-annealing at 120 °C for 2 min.158 Generally, the post-annealing temperature is >100 °C to ensure the complete crystal growth and crystallization (Fig. 4b).156–158,167,176 Considering these key factors, Chou et al. fabricated MAPbI3 films by spray coating the substrate at a temperature of 80 °C and post-annealing temperature at 120 °C for 30 min. Moreover, they showed 12.3% and 7.01% PCEs for 1 cm2 and 3 cm2 devices areas, respectively.156 In a similar study, Kim et al. spray-coated a MAPbI3−xClx film at a substrate temperature of 30 °C, followed by a post-annealing at 120 °C for 2 min, reaching PCEs up to 17.14% and 10.67% for 0.096 cm2 small cell and 100 cm2 PSC module, respectively (Fig. 4c).158 Apparently, even at optimum deposition and post-annealing temperatures, still, it is challenging to achieve pinhole-free perovskite thin-films, resulting in poor efficiencies.159
Hot air blowing spray coating has been highlighted as a creative way to form high-quality and continuous perovskite thin-films.159 As shown in Fig. 4d, MAPbI3−xClx ink was spray-coated over the substrate at room temperature, followed by hot air treatment at 120 °C for 15 s to remove the solvent and dry the perovskite thin-film. Consequently, perovskite thin-films fabricated by hot air blowing spray coating showed much better surface coverage and an average PCE of 11.12%, which is almost twice higher than that of those fabricated by spray coating at a substrate temperature of 70 °C.
Besides, room-temperature solvent–solvent extraction approaches have been introduced to form high-quality perovskite thin-films.7,160,193 In this case, Cai et al. immersed spray-coated films into a diethyl ether bath to extract the ink solvent and create an intermediate phase, followed by post-annealing at 90 °C for 30 min to complete the crystallization of perovskite thin-films (Fig. 4e). As a result, a PCE of 20.6% was achieved for a triple-cation perovskite thin-film on a device area of 0.13 cm2.193 Similarly, Su et al. used a diethyl ether bath for the fabrication of perovskite thin-films, resulting in PCEs of 18.8% and 15.07% on ITO glass, 16.15% and 13.21% on flexible substrates for active areas of 0.13 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively.160
Vacuum quenching and vacuum annealing have been used for solvent extraction and perovskite crystallization of spray-coated wet films.161,177,178 For example, Bishop et al. spray-coated triple-cation perovskite ink onto the 40 °C preheated substrates to control the surface wetting of films (Fig. 4f),161,177 followed by vacuum treatment (80 Pa) for 1 min and post-annealing at 120 °C for 20 min to finalize the crystallization ultimately.177 Beyond this, all spray-coated perovskite and charge transport layers showed PCEs of 16.3% and 12.7% for device areas of 0.154 cm2 and 1.08 cm2, respectively.177 Moreover, vacuum quenching can be replaced by vacuum-assisted thermal annealing to control crystallization and create uniform perovskite thin-films, leading to improving the PCE. For example, Guo et al. spray-coated MAPbI2.91Br0.09 perovskite thin-films, followed by vacuum annealing at 110 °C for 3 min to make uniform and smooth perovskite thin-films.178 Consequently, PCEs of 17.07% and 15.6% on an active area of 0.09 cm2 with vacuum-assisted thermal annealing and thermal annealing were achieved, respectively. Recently, a new method has been used to dry and form spray-coated perovskite thin-films, named rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP).162,179 As shown in Fig. 4g, the spray-coated perovskite thin-film is exposed to N2 and/or dry air plasma.162,179 Therefore, the required thermal energy to form perovskite thin-films can be provided by atmospheric plasma, in which reactive species (i.e. ions, photons, etc.) and convective thermal energy produced by atmospheric plasma can transfer energy to perovskite solvates. Following this, Hilt et al. used RSPP to deposit a pinhole-free MAPbI3 film and gained a PCE of 15.7% on a 2.4 cm2 device area.179 In a similar study, Rolston et al. employed the RSPP method to deposit Cs0.17FA0.83PbI3 films, fabricating a PSC mini-module with PCE of 15.2% for a 5.9 cm2 area.162
Besides, compositional engineering as an efficient approach has been increasingly used in the spray coating method to attain highly crystalline and pinhole-free perovskite thin-films, increasing the performance and stability of PSCs.163,164,178,180–186 So far, mixed cation perovskite thin-films showed the highest performance in perovskite photovoltaics;19 therefore, many efforts have been made to spray coat this class of perovskites. In this regard, Chou et al. spray-coated MA1−xFAxPbI3 films with different MA/FA ratios.163 As shown in Fig. 4h, the spray-coated MAPbI3 (x = 0) and FAPbI3 (x = 1) perovskites have various grain-sized flower-like and uneven feather-like morphologies, respectively. Remarkably, by adding FA to MAPbI3 composition, uniform and pinhole-free MA0.75FA0.25PbI3 (x = 0.25) perovskite thin-films were formed. Fabricated PSCs with spray-coated MA0.75FA0.25PbI3 demonstrated a higher PCE of 15.61% compared to pure MAPbI3 (13.97%) and FAPbI3 for a small area of 0.09 cm2. In another study, Yu et al. deposited CsxFA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite in a two-step deposition process183 including CsI/PbI2 evaporation and spray coating FAI/FABr (1:1) solution followed by post-annealing at 160 °C for 1 h, resulting in PCEs of 18.2% and 14.7% for 0.16 cm2 and 10 cm2 mini-module areas, respectively. In addition to organic–inorganic perovskites, all-inorganic perovskites with excellent thermal and light stabilities have attracted significant attention to be deposited in spray-coated PSCs.164,184–186 Very recently, Heo et al. fabricated graded CsPbI3−xBrxvia successive spray coating of CsPbI2Br and CsPbI3 inks at a deposition temperature of 150 °C, producing impressive PCEs of 16.81% and 13.82% for a 0.096 cm2 small device and a module with a large area aperture of 112 cm2, respectively (Fig. 4i).164 Interestingly, the fabricated all-inorganic module retained 91.7% of the initial performance after 1000 h under 1 sun illumination in N2 atmosphere at room temperature (Table 1).

Besides, solvent engineering is an essential factor for controlling the solvent evaporation rate and crystallization in the spray coating method.156,157,165,167,187–192 Generally, to prolong the crystallization timing window, the duration of the wet-stage and the balance of the inward flux of the perovskite ink and the outward flux of solvents, using high BP solvents play an important role in spray coating to achieve a high-quality film.165,189 Typically, a mixture of low and high BP solvents (in the optimized ratio) can provide an appropriate viscosity for spray coating perovskite inks with a wide-range of flow rate and good surface wettability.165,189 For example, Uličná et al.189 used mixed NMP:DMF (9:8 v-v) solvents to prepare a proper MAPbI3 ink for spray coating perovskite thin-films, producing a PCE of 17.3% for a small area of 0.06 cm2. In another study, Heo et al. spray-coated FA0.95−yMA0.05+yPbI3−x−yBrxCly perovskite ink in DMF:DMSO (4:1 v-v) on TiO2 nanorods, obtaining 17.62% PCE on a 0.096 cm2 small-scale device.191 Similarly, Heo et al. optimized the DMF:GBL volume ratio in MAPbI3−xClx perovskite ink.165 Adding GBL with a high BP into the ink retarded crystallization during heating at a temperature of 120 °C. Beyond this, they achieved a promising PCE of 18.3% for a small area of 0.16 cm2 and 15.5% for an aperture area of 100 cm2 mini-module PSCs (Fig. 4j).
In brief, spray coating is a very appropriate method for the mass production of perovskite thin-films. Regarding crystallization, the most critical challenges in this method are thickness variation, a slow solvent evaporation rate and dewetting the substrate, leading to low surface coverage and poor crystallinity. The abovementioned challenges can precisely be reduced by controlling the head height, the scanning speed, the ink concentration, the nozzle spray angle, the flow rate, the deposition temperature, and thermal post-annealing. The wet film will be too thick with a low drying rate and is subjected to dewetting and/or uncontrolled growth. At a high drying rate, the wet film will be too thin, which leads to drying of droplets before coalescing and the formation of a non-uniform perovskite thin-film with poor surface coverage. Moreover, compositional engineering and solvent engineering are two approaches to control solvent quenching and perovskite crystallization. In terms of performance, spray-coated PSCs have shown PCEs more than 20% for a small area of 0.13 cm2 and 13.0% for 112 cm2 module PSCs.
Overall, we have summarized the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of all the mentioned scale-up methods in Table 2.

4. Additives for large-scale perovskite deposition
One of the major bottlenecks of various large area deposition methods is homogeneity and uniform surface coverage of perovskite film on the substrates. It is well documented in the small area perovskite thin-films that the introduction of various additives in the perovskite ink has improved the morphology of the perovskite thin-films, as well as, passivation of the defect states, leading to highly efficient PSCs.195 These additives have also been used in scalable methods for improving the quality of large area perovskite thin-films.
Since the early stage of PSCs, chlorine-based molecules (MACl) have been widely used as an additive to fabricate high-quality perovskite films.196,197 In this regard, Zhu et al. employed the blade coating method to deposit the perovskite with MACl as an additive to achieve a highly crystalline perovskite film with reduced thermal annealing requirements.81 As a result, a stabilized PCE of 13.3% for a 12.6 cm2 four-cell module was achieved. Afterwards, Dai et al. introduced ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) into the perovskite ink to form hydrogen bonds with PbI2 colloids, retarding perovskite nucleation and enabling the growth of a smooth, compact perovskite film.63 As a result, PCEs of 19.72% and 15.86% were achieved for flexible solar cells with areas of 0.08 cm2 and 42.9 cm2, respectively. Similarly, Xu et al. have improved perovskite crystallinity by incorporating Br− ions into perovskite ink by using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) molecules.198 They achieved a certified PCE of 15.79% for a 16 cm2 four-cell module by the blade coating method. Also, using this additive led to the improvement of the long-term stability over 1000 h with 85% of initial PCE by passivation of the surface defects of the perovskite film. Recently, many advances have been made using the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure.199,200 In this regard, Grancini et al. used a aminovaleric acid (5-AVA) iodide as an additive into MAPbI3 perovskite ink, leading to a 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite film. They fabricated a fully printable 100 cm2 module with a stable efficiency of 11.2% over 10000 h.33
Full coverage and pinhole-free deposition of perovskite thin-films are crucial to achieving high-performance large area perovskite solar modules. Adding a small amount of lead-based salts such as lead chloride (PbCl2), lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2), and lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) to perovskite ink has been introduced as an efficient strategy to improve the perovskite thin-film morphology and crystallinity in the small-scale methods, i.e., spin coating and deposition method.201–203 However, this strategy has been used for large-scale perovskite film deposition methods as well. For example, Kim et al. used PbCl2 and PbAc2 as additives to improve the slot-die-coated perovskite film quality.117 They emphasized that adding such a mixture of lead salts in perovskite ink leads to more efficient perovskite film crystallization than the additive-free ink. As a result, a PCE of 8.3% was achieved for a large area module of 10 cm2. In addition, Zhang et al. used similar additives, i.e., PbCl2 and Pb(Ac)2, for inkjet printing MAPbI3 perovskite film.150 They demonstrated that introducing these additives lead to a preference in the vertical orientation of the perovskite grains on the inverted planar PEDOT:PSS substrate, obtaining a PCE of 16.6% (with 0.1 cm2 area) under ambient conditions. Very recently, Xu et al. fabricated high-quality slot-die-coated perovskite thin-films by incorporating potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) into the MAPbI3 ink to improve the crystallization process.129 They demonstrated that SCN− ions retard the nucleation step, leading to increasing the average grain sizes from 0.23 μm (pristine MAPbI3) to 11.2 μm (KSCN-modified MAPbI3). On the other hand, K+ ions reduce the cation vacancies in perovskite film, increasing the carrier lifetime from 0.16 μs to 1.89 μs. As a result, the PCE of slot-die-coated KSCN-modified PSC was improved from 14.3% to 21.38% for an active area of 0.09 cm2.
In addition to the additives mentioned above, acids and their salts have also been used as additives for scalable deposition techniques to achieve a uniform and defect-free perovskite thin-film. In 2018, Deng et al. used a high-speed blade coating process (180 m h−1) to deposit a large area of the perovskite film by incorporating L-α-phosphatidylcholine (LP) in the perovskite ink.86 They demonstrated that a small amount of such an additive (20 ppm) helps to improve the wettability of the perovskite ink on the underlying hydrophobic substrate. In addition to this function, LP could passivate the defect states of the perovskite film after the crystallization process. Finally, PCEs of over 20% for a small area device and 15.3% for a module with an area of 33.0 cm2 were obtained. In 2020, Cao et al. added zwitterion, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (PPS), as a bifunctional additive to perovskite ink for blade coating of α-Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite thin-films.204 The fabricated PSCs with this doped perovskite film delivered PCEs of 18.9% and 16.2% for 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2 areas, respectively. The improvement in the MA-free FA based devices is hypothesized to be due to the anchoring of these bifunctional molecules to the surface defects and thus inhibiting the undesired phase transition from the photoactive α-phase to non-perovskite δ-phase under ambient conditions.
Besides, cross-linking polymers and small molecules have shown great potential as promising additives to passivate perovskite thin-films and enhance the long term stability of PSCs.205–207 For example, Kim et al. used a non-electroactive polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO), as an additive for deposition of perovskite thin-films via the slot-die coating method.102 The authors employed a blowing-free hot deposition method by heating the substrate at 130 °C to reduce the exposure time of the substrate to ambient air. The hydrogen bonding between the (MA+) cations and O atoms in the PEO molecule retarded hydrate formation under high humid conditions and positioned the hydrophobic ethylene groups on the perovskite surface. As a result, high PCEs of 14.7% and 11.7% were achieved for rigid and flexible (roll-to-roll) PSCs, respectively, in a high humidity deposition environment (55 ± 5% RH). In 2020, Chang et al. added a multifunctional molecular additive, Zn(C6F5)2, to all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite ink and deposited perovskite thin-films via the blade coating method.208 Unlike most additives, where the additives make an interface between the perovskite and the HTL, Zn(C6F5)2 suppressed the defect formation in the perovskite/ETL interface. The fabricated PSCs showed a PCE of 19.00% for 0.09 cm2 with a loss of only 2% efficiency after 700 h under ambient conditions without encapsulation.
In summary, an appropriate selection of additives is one of the key considerations for upscaling perovskite thin-films. We have summarized the additives used for large-scale deposition of perovskite thin-films and their effects on the PV parameters of PSCs in Table 3. The additives have been shown to affect the crystal growth kinetics, resulting in improving the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite thin-films. Although these additives are added to the bulk perovskite ink, they have been shown to be efficient in passivating the surface defects and enhancing the efficiency of PSCs. Furthermore, the compatibility of these additives with the upscaling methods has also shown strong improvements in the long-term operational stability of PSCs in the ambient atmosphere.

5. New perovskite thin-film processing approaches compatible with upscaling technologies
As explained in the previous sections, perovskite nucleation and crystal growth are the two main parameters to obtain high-quality perovskite thin-films, achieving high performance devices. The nucleation step usually starts after solvent removal, i.e. the supersaturation point, by the antisolvent, heating, gas quenching and/or vacuum quenching processes. Generally, thermal annealing will occur after the nucleation step to complete perovskite thin-film crystallization by growing the crystals. Generally, post-annealing is performed on a hot plate and/or in an oven and requires various annealing time ranges of 5–120 min,6,7,11,12,16,209–218 which is cost- and time-consuming. To answer this challenge, commercial heating procedures and sources have been used to reduce the nucleation and crystal growth timing window to several seconds.219–226 For example, Troughton et al. used near-infrared (NIR) radiation for crystallization of the as-deposited perovskite thin-films within 2.5 s, achieving a PCE of 10.0% and a comparable thermally-annealed PSC with a PCE of 10.9%.219 So far, many fast and contactless annealing approaches, including rapid thermal annealing (RTA),220,227 near-infrared (NIR) annealing,111,219,221 flash infrared annealing (FIRA),222–226,228 photonic curing or intense pulse light (IPL) annealing,229–235 radiative thermal annealing,236,237 laser annealing,238–242 microwave annealing,243 and ultraviolet (UV) annealing244 have been used for perovskite thin-film crystallization (Table 4).

The perovskite annealing temperature and duration significantly affect the perovskite grain size.245–247 Although increasing the annealing temperature or the annealing time enhances perovskite grain sizes, it also increases the risk of formation of defect states247 and perovskite decomposition245,246 due to the evaporation of volatile organic components. Therefore, applying high temperatures for a few seconds on wet perovskite thin-films could prohibit these challenges, improving perovskite crystallinity and cell efficiency. Thus, Ouyang et al. blade-coated MAPbI3 perovskite thin-films followed by annealing at 140 °C for 20 s via the RTA approach.220 The fabricated PSC showed a PCE of 18.47% for an active area of 0.105 cm2, which is much higher than the PCE achieved (16.67%) for perovskite thin-films annealed at 140 °C for 2 min using a hot plate. A schematic of RTA is shown in Fig. 5a.227

Typically, in both NIR and FIRA annealing approaches, the FTO glass substrates absorb the IR radiation readily,219,222,223 leading to a rapid temperature increase of the substrates to 480 °C within 2 s.222,223 Then, FTO dissipates heat and cools down by transferring heat to the perovskite thin-films in a few seconds.219,226 Generally, in the NIR and FIRA annealing approaches, the heating time is only a few seconds, and due to lower supersaturation, the nucleation rate would be lower than that in the antisolvent method and also the crystal growth in NIR and FIRA is faster compared to the crystal growth in the antisolvent method, totally resulting in fabricating large and dense crystal domains and much better performance.222–224,228 However, in FIRA, short pulse IR flashes are utilized, and the pulse length determines the nucleation density, which is beneficial for PSC performance.223,224,228 In this regard, Huang et al. used NIR annealing to fabricate slot-die-coated MAPbI3 perovskite thin-films within 16 s irradiation to improve solvent evaporation and perovskite crystallization, leading to 12.13% PCE on an active area of 0.09 cm2 (Fig. 5b).111 In another study on FIRA, Sánchez et al. applied FIRA for 1.7 s to provide antisolvent-free high-quality MAPbI3 perovskite thin-film.223 As shown in Fig. 5c, the grain diameters of the perovskite thin-film fabricated via FIRA reached up to 40 μm due to low nucleation, which is much bigger than the perovskite grain size of 500 nm achieved via the antisolvent method. As a result, a PCE of ∼19% for an active area of 0.16 cm2 was reached through both FIRA and antisolvent methods. One year later, the same research group developed triple-cation (MAFACs) perovskite thin-film by FIRA in an even shorter time of 1.2 s, resulting in a PCE of 18.1% on an active area of 0.09 cm2.224 Moreover, they prepared FA0.8Cs0.15Ga0.05PbI3 perovskite thin-film via spin coating followed by a 1.6 s exposure to IR irradiation and 10 s under FIRA, achieving PCEs of 20.1% and 17.0% for areas of 0.1 and 1.4 cm2, respectively.225
The IPL or photonic curing as a localized, non-contact rapid thermal annealing approach can be provided by a Xenon lamp with broad spectral output from 190 and 1100 nm to fabricate pinhole-free, uniform, and continuous perovskite thin-films.232,234,248 Remarkably, flash pulses absorbed by the perovskite thin-film increase the film temperature and significantly change the perovskite thin-film morphology without transferring the high temperature into the underneath layers and the absorbed energy is rapidly dissipated on the same time scale.230–232 Moreover, one of the advantages of IPL is the possibility of thermal annealing of large areas in less than 2 ms (Fig. 5d).230 In this regard, Lavery et al. used IPL to fabricate MAPbI3 perovskite thin-film.230 They demonstrated that compact perovskite morphologies could be achieved using an energy pulse of 2000 J pulse−1, resulting in 11.5% PCE. In a similar study, Ghahremani et al. fabricated Cs0.05(MA0.85FA0.15)0.95PbI3 perovskite thin-films via spin-coating, followed by heating at 110 °C for 20 s and then exposure to an IPL machine with 1.4 kJ pulse−1 (totally five pulses), yielding a PCE of 11.98% for an active area of 0.12 cm2.235
Another novel approach for perovskite annealing is radiative thermal annealing using a halogen lamp.236,237 In this approach, the temperature can rise with a controlled ramp rate of 10 °C s−1. Since radiative heat originates in all directions from the glass substrate (for example, heat coming from the hot plate), the heat transfer is much efficient, resulting in larger perovskite grain sizes and better PSC performances than samples annealed using a hot plate.236,237 With this regard, Pool et al. fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite thin-films using a hot plate at 170 °C for 10 min and radiative thermal annealing at 170 °C for 10 s, and final devices exhibited PCEs of 13.8% and 14.15% for an active area of 0.06 cm2, respectively.237 Similarly, Dou et al. employed radiative thermal annealing at 100 °C for 3 min to fabricate MAPbI3 perovskite thin-films, achieving PCE up to 18% for an active area of 0.059 cm2, similar to the best performance of 17.6% from the heating processes at 100 °C for 10 min using a hot plate (Fig. 5e).236
Laser annealing is another approach to induce rapid perovskite crystallization, producing pinhole-free, dense and homogeneous perovskite thin-films. Meanwhile, perovskite grain sizes strongly depend on the laser scan speed and laser power density.238–241 In one study, Li et al.240 employed laser irradiation (a wavelength of 450 nm) to transform the as-coated wet films into dark MAPbI3 perovskite thin-films. Due to the faster crystallization of perovskite thin-films in laser annealing than in thermal annealing, the laser-annealed perovskite thin-films showed less recombination than hot plate-annealed perovskite Voc from 1.097 to 1.146 V and PCE from 16.5% to 17.8% for a 0.09 cm2 device area. Notably, You et al. utilized laser irradiation with different wavelengths (405, 450 and 660 nm) to increase the temperature of the perovskite thin-films to 100 °C within 1.5 s.239 As shown in Fig. 5f, perovskite crystal grains created by laser annealing were much larger than those made by thermal annealing. Therefore fabricated MAPbI3 and triple-cation mixed halide PSCs exhibited PCEs of 20.98% and 21.50% for an area of 0.06 cm2, respectively, while thermally-annealed PSCs showed only PCEs of 18.10% and 19.01%, respectively.
In 2016, Xu et al. introduced microwave annealing as an RTA approach to fabricate perovskite thin-films by controlling the microwave irradiation power and irradiation time, a PCE of 10.2% (area 0.07 cm2) was achieved in 6 min exposing time at a power of 320 W.243 Perovskite thin-film annealing can be more efficiently performed by using an ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) instead of other light sources (IR, xenon, etc.), since it does not damage the underneath layers by overheating and, consequently, the perovskite thin-films can absorb a vast majority of photons.244 Hence, Ouyang et al. annealed MAPbI3 films by utilizing 365 nm LEDs that match the absorption of MAPbI3 in the UV range at 354 nm. Thus, PSC annealed using UV for 11 s showed a PCE of 18.66% for an active area of 0.142 cm2, which is much higher than the thermally-annealed PSC with PCE of 14.5%.
Briefly, promising results from PSCs created by all RTA processes indicate that replacing the conventional thermal heating processes with RTA processes can be more energy- and time-saving for scaling up photovoltaics. Using RTA to form perovskite reduces the thermal heating from over 1 h to several seconds. So far, perovskite thin-films heated by RTA showed the maximum efficiencies of 21.50% for small area and 17.6% for mini-module with an active area of 2.7 cm2 PSCs.
6. Toward commercialization of solution-processed PSCs
Besides achieving high efficiencies, PSCs showed great potential to markedly reduce manufacturing costs due to easy solution-based processing, which is very beneficial for commercialization.
So far, several universities and photovoltaic companies have made attempts to scale up PSCs toward commercialization along with the development of PSCs. In this regard, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China fabricated the large area of 10 serially connected cell module (100 cm2) with the mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon triple-layer via the screen printing method, achieving a 10.4% PCE (Fig. 6a).249 In another report by Swansea University, the mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon triple-layer structure was used to fabricate all printable 198 cm2 solar modules with PCEs of ∼4%.250 Similarly, Solliance (Netherlands) manufactured a low-temperature processable (<135 °C) perovskite solar module (PSM) with an area of 169 cm2, which is compatible with roll-to-roll processing, yielding 10% PCE (Fig. 6b).127 Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC; Belgium)251 achieved 23.9% PCE for an area of 4 cm2 for a perovskite/Si tandem mini-module solar cell. Moreover, Microquanta Semiconductor (China)252 boosted the performance of the 19.3 cm2 PSC mini-module (Fig. 6c) to 18.04% in 2020. WonderSolar (China)253 developed screen-printed mesoscopic triple-layer tandem PSMs with 110 m2 perovskite panels. Saule Technologies254 developed flexible inkjet-printed PSMs for roofs of houses and factories with a weight of less than 1 kg m−2, as well as rigid PSMs for the building walls and car charging station (Fig. 6d). The car charging station available at Solar Carport (Poland)214 consists of 12 photovoltaic panels prepared by inkjet printing and a nominal power PV of 2.26 kW with a PCE of 16%. Oxford PV255 recorded a certified PCE of 29.5% for a perovskite/Si tandem solar cell, which is the best result for this device structure so far. Moreover, they are researching to increase the performance to more than 30%. Very recently, Wuxi Utmost Light Technology Co., Ltd (UtmoLight) in China256 announced a certified PCE of 20.5% for a 63.98 cm2 perovskite solar mini-module, which is the highest record for PSMs in the world (Fig. 6e). Recently, Tandem PV (the United States)257 was awarded a $2M R&D grant to manufacture 2 m2 perovskite/Si tandem solar panels. Solar-Tectic LLC (the United States)258 is developing a perovskite/Si tandem solar module to achieve up to 30% efficiency. Toshiba (Japan)259 and New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO; Japan)260 fabricated a perovskite module with 11.7% PCE for a large area of 703 cm2 by applying meniscus printing technology to deposit the MAPbI3 perovskite thin-film. In 2020, NEDO and Panasonic (Japan)261 developed a lightweight technology utilizing a large area of 802 cm2 by the inkjet printing method to reduce power generation costs of perovskite modules, obtaining 16.09% PCE on glass substrates.

7. Cost evaluation of solution-processed PSCs
Toward commercialization of PSMs, assessing the manufacturing cost of modules is a critical factor. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)162,274–276 and life-cycle assessment (LCA)224,277–283 should be considered to produce low-cost PSMs. The LCOE is the cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour (kWh) over the lifetime of the generated PV technology and strongly depends on system design, maintenance, grid limit, labour, utilities, materials, tax and interests, location, and depreciation.162,275,276 In this regard, the researchers employ several financial models such as the system advisor model (SAM)162,274 to calculate the cost and performance of renewable energy assignments using computer models based on hypothesized device stacks. For example, Song et al.274 chose an inverted perovskite solar structure based on low-cost inorganic metal oxides of NiO and ZnO as the HTL and ETL, respectively, to reduce the device cost in a database of bottom-up cost model with a sequence manufacturing process flow illustration as shown in Fig. 7a. They estimated a LCOE value in the range of 4.93–7.90 US cents per kW h with the system lifetime of 30 years at a working PCE of 16%. The use of the minimum sustainable price (MSP) model274 to estimate the total cost of PV modules (Fig. 7b) shows an MSP of $0.41 per Wp for perovskite PV modules at an operating PCE of 16%, which is lower than $0.60, $0.67, $0.64–0.76, and $0.57 per Wp for the cadmium telluride (CdTe), CIGS, crystalline silicon (c-Si), and n–i–p perovskite modules, respectively (Fig. 7b).

The LCA is a powerful tool to analyze the environmental impacts and the sustainability of a particular solar PV technology. It depends on three standard metrics: cumulative energy demand (CED), energy pay-back time (EPBT), and global warming potential (GWP).278,281,282 The CED refers to the amount of primary energy used within the entire life cycle of the product. The EPBT is the time needed for a particular solar PV technology to produce equivalent energy that is consumed to generate it. The GWP is a useful index to determine the effects of a particular solar PV technology on global warming and quantifies greenhouse gas emissions in kg of CO2 equivalents.

Table 5 provides a summary of LCA studies with different materials and perovskite deposition processes for single-junction PSCs.274,278,280,283 However, we did not find any study on blade coating of perovskite thin-films. Comparing the CED of other coating methods demonstrates that the inkjet printing method on the triple mesoscopic structure has the lowest CED. Because of more material wastage during coating, spray coating has the highest CED. According to Table 5, the EPBT of perovskite solar technology (∼1 year) is short, making perovskite a great candidate in the energy generation market. Also, among the different coating methods, inkjet printing has the lowest generation of CO2. All of these mentioned indices strongly depend on module lifetime, module efficiency, and stack structure and can be varied.

8. Conclusion and outlook
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a strong opponent for the commercially available terrestrial photovoltaic technologies, including Si, CdTe, and CIGS. Despite the extensive effort and significant progress in the large area fabrication of PSCs, their efficiency still lags behind those of small area devices. One of the main reasons for this gap between large and small area PSCs is the difficulty in large area processing of uniform and high-quality perovskite thin-films. This review emphasizes that a comprehensive understanding of nucleation and crystal growth fundamentals is essential to fabricate homogeneous, pinhole-free and large grain-sized perovskite thin-films. Various scalable printing methods, including blade coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing and spray coating, were systematically reviewed. As shown in Fig. 8, up to now, all the mentioned printing methods reached a PCE of >20% for small-sized PSC devices and >15% PCE for large-scale perovskite mini-modules.
 Fig. 8  Power conversion efficiency records of champion PSCs and perovskite solar modules on (a) low-scale and (b) large-scale fabrication. The numbers mentioned in the brackets are the device area in cm2 and reference(s), respectively. 
We discussed the promising large-scale methods/composition of perovskite thin-films for the highest achieved PCEs. Regarding the blade coating method, the best PCEs of 22.0% and 16.9% for small area Cs0.05FA0.70MA0.25PbI3 PSC (0.08 cm2)87 and large rea MAPbI3 PSCs (63.7 cm2)90 were achieved, respectively. The record PCEs of 21.8% and 19.54% were achieved for slot-die-coated small area MAPbI3 PSC (0.1 cm2)123 and large area FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 PSCs (65.0 cm2),120 respectively. The high PCEs of 21.6% and 16.1% were reported for inject printed small area Cs0.10FA0.75MA0.15Pb(Br0.15I0.85)3 PSC (0.1 cm2)140 and large area MAPbI3 PSCs (802 cm2),259,260 respectively. Finally, the PCEs of 20.6% and 15.7% were reported for spray-coated CsI0.05((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr)0.15)0.95 PSC with a small area (0.13 cm2)193 and MAPbI3 PSC with a large area (2.4 cm2),179 respectively. Altogether, inject printing has demonstrated great potential as a promising technique for large-scale deposition of perovskite thin-films to fabricate highly efficient PSCs.
To improve the wettability, quality and crystallinity of perovskite thin-films, the mechanism of perovskite crystallization by hot casting, gas quenching, vacuum quenching, and chemical approaches in large-scale deposition techniques was carefully discussed for each scalable deposition method. Also, to control solvent quenching, nucleation and crystallization, the standard thermal annealing step can be replaced by rapid thermal annealing, which does not need a hot plate and/or an oven. The success of these techniques is also highly dependent on instrumentations that can implement the planned nucleation and growth processes for perovskite deposition. For example, to realize highly crystalline perovskite thin-films by blade coating and slot-die coating, beyond all said physical and chemical methods, controlling the substrate temperature, meniscus size, and scanning speed is necessary. In inkjet printing, the slower printing speed compared to other upscaling methods is a critical issue that should be considered. This limitation can be overcome using the physical and chemical methods, especially vacuum-assisted process and thermal annealing posttreatment. In spray coating, monitoring the head height, the scanning speed, the ink concentration, the nozzle spray angle, the flow rate, the deposition temperature, and thermal post-annealing can tune the perovskite thin-film crystallization. The perovskite photovoltaic research is developing very fast, which can promote PSCs into the PV market soon.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites exhibit interesting properties, such as long carrier diffusion length, large absorption coefficient, and low exciton binding energy. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in lab-scale has increased from 3.8% to 25.5% in just one decade due to improvements in device structure via various techniques such as compositional engineering, morphological control of the thin-film, charge transport layers optimization, defect passivation, and interface modification. However, despite tremendous performance achievements in small-scale PSCs (∼0.1 cm2), large-scale processed PSCs still lag behind other well-developed PV technologies such as silicon (Si) PV or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). The success of large-scale processed PSCs is highly dependent on achieving cost-effective deposition of high-quality perovskite thin-films, especially through solution processes. This review discusses the recent developments in scalable solution-processed perovskite deposition techniques, including blade, slot-die, spray coating, and inkjet printing, focusing on nucleation and crystal growth fundamentals for fabricating high-quality perovskite thin-films. Moreover, the existing challenges and opportunities to push forward the scale-up of PSCs are discussed. Finally, an outlook and the state-of-the-art performance charts for large-scale PSCs are presented.

Spin coating	• Uniform layers with high film thickness and reproducibility	• Only small-scale
• Low investment cost for setup	• Difficulty in controlling the deposition of different layers

	• Material wastage
Blade coating	• Adapted for continuous fabrication with roll-to-roll setup	• Contact between the substrate and the blade
• Low material usage	

• Inexpensive printing method can be performed in an ambient atmosphere	

Slot-die coating	• Adapted for continuous fabrication with roll-to-roll setup	• Contact between the substrate and the blade
• Low material usage	

• Inexpensive printing method can be performed in an ambient atmosphere	

Inkjet printing	• Absence of physical contact, so the method is suitable to print any material that is sufficiently fluid and conductive or any solute that is soluble in a conducting fluid vehicle	• Inevitable waste of inkjet material during deposition

	• Require a flow-mask or a shadow mask to achieve some patterning
• Patterning allows 2D freedom-of-design	

• Ability to choose different solvents and nozzles to increase resolution	

• Can be performed in an ambient atmosphere	

Spray coating	• Deposition of large area films	• A shadow mask used in spray-coating can allow 2D design
• Can be performed in an ambient atmosphere	• High material wastage
