    , Accepted 22nd February 2019First published on 25th February 2019AbstractWe synthesized and characterized a series of new random terpolymers composed of two electron-accepting blocks, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and benzothiadiazolequinoxaline (BTQx), and one electron-donating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit with different molar ratios of the BTQx block to DPP block (25%, 50%, and 75% BTQx). The random terpolymers compositional effects on the physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performances were studied. Different compositions of DPP and BTQx blocks in the conjugated backbone of the terpolymers had a crucial effect on the electrochemical and optical properties of the random terpolymers. These terpolymers were employed as a donor along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution-processed polymer solar cells. Among all the terpolymers, P13 (BDT–DPP50–BTQx50) with a monomer composition of BTQx and DPP (50:50) blocks showed excellent light-collecting ability, high charge-carrier mobility, and a low-lying HOMO energy level. PSCs based on P13 (BDT–DPP50–BTQx50) exhibited a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 15.74 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.68, leading to a high PCE of 9.20%, which is higher than that for D–A copolymers, i.e., P11 (7.37%) and P15 (8.11%). These results demonstrate that random terpolymerization is a simple and practical approach for optimization of a conjugated polymer donor for efficient polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Due to growing demand for energy over the past decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as promising renewable sources of energy due to their low cost, light weight, and possibility of using flexible devices with a large area.1–3 Recently, PSCs with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) have demonstrated an efficiency (PCE) of more than 11% with fullerene4,5 and 13–14% with non-fullerene acceptors.6,7 This rapid increase in efficiency is mainly due to the development of highly efficient D–A polymers by optimizing the donor (D) and acceptor (A) blocks.8–12 However, PSCs are still far from commercial application due to their low PCE values and short service life for large area devices.13 The relatively narrow absorption width of active PSC layers compared to inorganic solar cells14 is one of the key factors limiting further improvement of the photocurrent and PCE.15 For their commercialization, it is necessary to further improve PSCs’ light harvesting ability using active layers in order to effectively overlap the solar spectrum with a high absorption coefficient. Ideal polymers should have a strong absorption band covering the visible and near-infrared ranges of the solar spectrum and relatively low HOMO levels to maximize the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and high hole mobility. Narrow bandgap polymers are demanded to collect long-wave photons. However, at least two problems may arise for narrow bandgap polymers in the harvesting of long-wave photons. First, a bandgap decrease can lead to one or both the LUMO and HOMO levels shifting, which will inevitably lead to a Voc decrease, since the energy difference between the acceptor LUMO and the donor HOMO is closely correlated with the Voc value.16 Second is related to the need to obtain a minimum exciton dissociation driving force equal to the donor and acceptor LUMO difference (>0.3 eV).17 The optimized photovoltaic properties of polymeric materials exhibit a high short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) resulting in a high PCE. Unfortunately, most D–A alternating polymers are unable to obtain a high PCE value due to an imbalance between the Jsc and Voc.18 One of the effective approaches to further improving the PCE is the development of random ternary polymers containing three different monomers with broad, strong, and complementary absorption spectra in the visible and near-IR regions, as well as the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels to achieve an open-circuit voltage high value and effective charge separation.19–22 The advantage of random terpolymers is that their physicochemical properties can be easily tuned by varying the monomers ratio during polymerization. They can exhibit synergistic effects due to an appropriate selection and optimization of the molar ratios of the three components, demonstrating such advantages as a broad absorption, low-lying (HOMO), high charge mobility, and good solubility.23–25 Kim and co-workers synthesized and characterized a series of benzodithiophene-based random terpolymers (BDT) as an electron-donating block and two different electron-acceptor blocks: diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thienopyrrolodione (TPD).26 They controlled the optical bandgap and energy levels of the random ternary copolymers by varying the TPD/DPP molar ratios in the polymer chain. The terpolymer with the TPD/DPP optimal molar ratio showed a high PCE of 6.33%. A high short-circuit current density (Jsc) was obtained by inserting a DPP block into the BDT/TPD polymer chain. However, the Voc was relatively low (0.76 V) due to the strong electron-acceptor effect of the DPP block. To improve the photovoltaic characteristics of the terpolymers (BDT/TPD), they replaced the DPP block with dithienosilole (DTS), which led to an increase in the Voc. D–A copolymers based on DTS and TPD showed an improved Voc value (0.85 V). Therefore, BDT and DTS blocks inclusion may be an ideal approach to achieve a high Voc value for high-performance PSCs. Jo and colleagues developed a series of random conjugated terpolymers by varying the molar ratio between diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo. This terpolymer showed a PCE of 6.04% with a Voc of 0.77 V, Jsc of 13.52 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.58.27 Wei et al. synthesized another class of D–A terpolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT)-benzoxadiazole–DPP and achieved a high PCE value of 6.8% with a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 17.00 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.55 via changing the ratio of the two electron-acceptor blocks.28 Similarly, other terpolymers were presented by Lim and colleagues29 with a maximum PCE of 8.25% and Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 14.51 mA cm−2, and FF of 55.0%. In addition, Jo also reported a TDPP:PyDPP terpolymer, which showed a high PCE of 8.11%, greater than that of the corresponding maternal homopolymers PTDPP2T (6.70%) and PPyDPP2T (4.14%).30 Leclerc et al. developed and synthesized a series of highly efficient random terpolymers based on benzodithiophene as a donor and thiadiazole-isoindoledione and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as acceptor blocks and achieved a PCE above 7.3% due to the wider absorption range and low-lying HOMO level.31 Liu and others successfully synthesized and characterized a series of high-performance BDT-containing ternary copolymers by varying the molar ratio of benzothiadiazole (BT) and diketopyrrolpyrrole (DPP). Via varying the molar ratios of BT/DPP acceptors in the backbone, the absorption, energy levels, molecular aggregation, and charge mobility could be tuned, which led to impressive results. The effectiveness of the polymer (BT:DPP = 0.7:0.3) showed the greatest efficiency of 9.01% with a Voc = 0.73V, Jsc = 18.45 mA cm−2, and FF = 66.9%, which was 48.7% higher than for initial homopolymers, thus showing the great potential for photovoltaic applications.32
Inspired by the above-mentioned work, we synthesized and studied the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic characteristics of three new random conjugated D–A terpolymers. We developed and synthesized the BDT–DPP–BTQx basic terpolymers P12–P14, where DPP and BTQx were used as acceptors (A1 and A2, respectively) and BDT acted as a donor block (D) (Scheme 1). Recently, DPP acceptors have been intensively studied in PSCs due to their attractive properties, such as large planar structure, strong electron-acceptor ability, and tendency toward aggregation, which lead to high PCEs.26–32 In addition, the suitable alkyl block in BDT provides solubility and polymer inter-chain packing. However, the majority of polymers based on DPP have shown a limited absorption width (∼700 nm), which hinders further PCE growth.26–32 In response, we chose the electron-acceptor BTQx as a second acceptor (A2) due to its structural versatility. Recently, we presented some copolymers based on BTQx (as an acceptor) with various bandgaps from 1.13 to 1.3 eV.33–35 Compared to other D–A polymers, BTQx-containing polymers exhibit lower bandgaps (∼1.2 eV), absorbing up to the near-infrared range (>1200 nm). Further correlation studies of the structures and physicochemical properties of BTQx-containing D–A polymers alternating with different D blocks may provide some insight into new narrow bandgap polymers development.

In this article, we report on a series of new random and conjugated terpolymers with a donor (D)–acceptor (A1)–donor (D)–acceptor (A2) (P11–P15) configuration for PSCs, in which DPP and BTQx were used as the first (A1) and second (A2) electron-accepting units and BDT as the electron-donating unit. The molar ratio between the DPP and BTQx was varied from 0% to 100% to synthesize the different polymers. BDT is a weak donor with a structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system, which can enhance the electron delocalization and interchain interaction to improve the charge carrier mobility. It was found that DPP/BTQx molar ratio variation in the polymer backbone has a great influence on the electrochemical properties of random terpolymers. In addition, the photoelectric characteristics of random based PSCs strongly depended on the DPP and BTQx blocks composition in the polymer chain. Among the three random terpolymers, P13-based PSC showed a PCE of 9.10%, which is higher than that for PSCs based on regular copolymer P11 (7.37%) and P15 (8.11%) PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Intermediate compounds 1–3, monomer M3,36 and monomers M137 and M238 were synthesized as reported in the literature. The synthesis of the statistical random terpolymers P11–P15 was carried out under Stille-cross-coupling reaction conditions in toluene at 110 °C for 48 h using Pd(Ph3P)4 as a catalyst, as shown in Scheme 1. The process proceeded under homogeneous conditions and allowed obtaining terpolymers with a high molecular weight in the form of dark purple powders with yields in the range of 78–93%. The obtained terpolymers were purified from residues of metal complex catalyst, organics, and low molecular impurities twice by precipitating from solution with methanol and subsequent extraction with methanol, hexane, acetone, and finally with chloroform. Three statistical terpolymers with different DPP to BTQx molar ratios (DPP/BTQx = 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3) were synthesized to study the compositional effect of the properties of the statistical terpolymers.
The chemical structure of these terpolymers was confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. In particular, the broad peaks between 8.5–7.0 ppm belong to the aromatic ring protons, the two broad peaks from 4.5–3.4 ppm were attributed to the protons of the methylene group connected to the nitrogen atom, and alkoxy groups, respectively, and the peaks from 0.5–2.5 ppm corresponded to the protons of the long alkyl chains. The absence of the characteristic singlet peak at 0.4 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum revealed that there were no trimethyltin end groups present in all the polymers (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†).
When we tried to determine the DPP and BTQx composition in the random copolymers from 1H NMR spectra analysis (Fig. 1), we understood that it was not accurate to measure the proton intensity ratio of random polymers because the proton intensities were too weak and wide to be accurately determined. Therefore, we determined the DPP and BTQx compositions using elemental analysis and found that the composition was almost equal to the DPP/BTQx molar loading ratio, which indicated that the two monomers reactivities were the same. The molecular weight distribution of the statistical terpolymers P11–P15 was determined using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Toluene was used as a standard and chloroform was used as the eluent. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of the P11–P15 terpolymers found by GPC varied between 11300–14800 and 1.82–2.50, respectively (Table 1). All the polymers were fairly high molecular-weight with narrow distributions and were well soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). TGA revealed that the decomposition temperature (Td) of P11 (BDT–DPP), P12, P13, P14, and P15 (BTD-BTQx) (5% weight loss) were 358 °C, 342 °C, 339 °C, 335 °C, and 330 °C, respectively. The results showed that the thermal stability of the polymers improved as the BTQx content was increased. All the polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability. These results indicated that these polymers are suitable for fabricating organic photoelectronic devices.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution and in thin films are displayed in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2a. All the random terpolymers P11–P15 in solution exhibited two or three absorption bands ranging from 300 to 1100 nm, a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor blocks. The first absorption band around 300–500 nm corresponded to the polymer backbone π–π* transition and the other, a broader band in the long-wavelength range from 600 to 1100 nm corresponded to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the BTQx or DPP acceptor blocks and the BDT donor blocks. The copolymer P11, in which only DPP was incorporated as an acceptor block, displayed two absorption bands: one at 300–600 nm, which was assigned to localized π–π* transitions, and a second broader band at 600–900 nm in the long wavelength range, which corresponded to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the DPP acceptor and BDT donor.

In the case of the copolymer P15, which consists of BTQx as an acceptor and BDT as a donor, the localized π–π* transition band was at 300–600 nm, while the absorption band resulting from ICT between the BDT donor and TQx acceptor was in the range of 600–1100 nm. It has been shown that BTQx has a coplanar structure, which generally leads to better π-electron delocalization in conjugated copolymers and hence a lower bandgap between the HOMO and LUMO. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the P15 copolymer has absorption that extends to the NIR region with an optical band gap as low as 1.14 eV, whereas the P11 copolymer exhibited absorption only up to 900 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.34 eV. It is clear that the D–A terpolymer with a BTQx-containing structure as the acceptor block has a longer conjugation length and better π-electron delocalization and hence a lower bandgap than one incorporating DPP as the acceptor block. By introducing these two acceptor blocks into one D–A conjugated polymer and systematically changing the components ratios from 3:1 to 1:3, we were able to tune the absorption properties as well as the bandgaps of the resulting random copolymers. When the BTQx/DPP ratio was over 1:1, the main absorption in the longer-wavelength region tends to stabilize, while absorption in the shorter-wavelength region will increase dramatically. On the contrary, when the BTQx/DPP ratio was less than 1:1, the absorption in the longer-wavelength region tends to stabilize, but it decreases dramatically in shorter-wavelength region. In addition, terpolymers shoulder absorption increases gradually around 700 nm, which is due to strong aggregation of these DPP-based copolymers. Therefore, there is a balance between the absorption and molecular aggregation during blended film formation. Absorption intensity between 300 and 600 nm improved with BTQx content increasing. Meanwhile, ICT bands from BDT to DPP around 600–900 nm gradually decreased with BTQx content increasing. As expected, strong and broad absorption in the 300–1100 nm range was demonstrated for the as-synthesized terpolymers P13 and P14. Such broad absorption would be favorable for a high Jsc. Compared to their absorption in solution, all of the terpolymer in thin films showed similar absorption peaks but broader absorption between 300–1100 nm due to the stronger interchain aggregation. In addition, a trend in absorption onset was observed with a gradual blue-shift from P14 to P11 as the BTQx content became lower, which was due to the weaker DPP electron-acceptor character compared to BTQx. Interestingly, the terpolymers reported here had relatively strong absorption in the entire visible to NIR region when the BTQx to DPP ratios were between 3:1 and 1:1 (Fig. 3b). The absorption profile arose from two complementary ICT absorption bands generated by the two different acceptor blocks in the terpolymers. Furthermore, the specific compositions resulted in a balanced absorption of those bands. This unique feature of absorption may lead to a better performance of the polymers in photovoltaic applications. When we calculated the full-width half-maxima (FWHMs) of the absorption spectra to quantitatively compare the absorption broadness of the random terpolymers (having compositions of 4:4:0, 4:3:1, 4:2:2, 4:1:3, and 4:0:4), the FWHMs of P11, P2, P13, P14, and P15 were 186, 179, 357, 414, and 264 nm, respectively (Table 2), implying that the random terpolymers would absorb more of the solar spectrum than those of two copolymers. In particular, the P14 absorption spectrum was nearly equal to the sum of P11 and P15 absorptions (Fig. 3a and b, Table 2). Therefore, the random terpolymers with extended light absorption would provide a strong potential for achieving panchromatic PSCs. The optical bandgaps of P11–P15 were estimated to be 1.34, 1.30, 1.16, 1.15, and 1.14 eV, respectively, calculated from the absorption edges (λedge) of solid-state films (Table 2). The absorption onset of P11 was blue-shifted compared to P15, which was due to the weaker electron-accepting character of DPP compared to BTQx. Upon comparison of P12–P14, a similar trend for absorption onset was observed with a gradual blue-shift from P14 to P12 with higher DPP content. In varying the electron-acceptor blocks composition, broad absorptions of the P13–P14 random copolymers were observed from 300 to 1100 nm compared to the P11 initial polymer, indicating that incorporating two different electron-deficient blocks into the polymer backbone is an effective method to broaden the absorption band and tailor the optical bandgap.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the redox behavior, the BTQx/DPP ratio effect on energy levels, and to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, the polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the results are shown in Fig. 3. All the CV measurements were recorded in a solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 in nitrogen-saturated anhydrous acetonitrile at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The results of electrochemical measurements are listed in Table 2b. From the oxidation potential (Eox) and reduction potential (Ered) onsets of the polymers, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as bandgaps of the polymers were calculated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.80 eV below vacuum level) as an external standard according to the equations:EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.48) (eV)ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.48) (eV).Egech = EHOMO − ELUMO (eV)The HOMO energy levels of the P11–P15 copolymers with DPP/BTQx compositions of 1/0, 3/1, 1/1 1/3, and 0/1 were of −5.23, −5.24, −5.26, −5.28, and −5.30 eV, respectively, implying that they varied with respect to the modulated ICT strengths resulting from the presence of electron-acceptor blocks with various electron-accepting abilities. We observed that increasing the BTQx strong acceptor content could lower the HOMO energy level, which favored a high Voc and good air stability of the PSCs. It is well known that a low-lying HOMO level would contribute to achieving a high Voc, while broader absorption would favor obtaining a higher Jsc in PSCs. Therefore, satisfactory device performance requires balancing the rational energy level control and absorption manipulation in terpolymers. The LUMO energy levels of the copolymers P11–P15 were all located within a reasonable range (from −3.60 to −3.73 eV) and were significantly greater than that of PC71BM (ca. 4.2 eV); suggesting that charge transfer from the polymer to PC71BM would be effective, affording a LUMO–LUMO offset between polymers and PC71BM (−4.2 eV) of over 0.3 eV, which would ensure efficient exciton dissociation.39,40 In addition, the electrochemical bandgaps (Eq) of the copolymers P11–P15 as estimated from differences between the potential onsets for oxidation and reduction were in the 1.57–1.63 eV range; that is, they were higher than the corresponding optical bandgaps. This discrepancy between the electrochemical and optical bandgaps presumably resulted from the polymers’ exciton binding energies and/or interface barriers for charge injection.
Photovoltaic properties
In order to explore the possibilities of these random terpolymers as a donor, PSCs with the conventional structure of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al were fabricated. In order to optimize the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, these polymers were blended with the PC71BM acceptor in different weight ratios of terpolymers and PC71BM and finally SVA treatment of the optimized active layers was performed. The best performance was achieved with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment in tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 40 s. The current–voltage characteristics under illumination are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding parameters are compiled in Table 3. The overall PCEs of the PSCs based on P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15 were about 7.37%, 7.87%, 9.20%, 8.68%, and 8.11%, respectively. Compared to P11 and P15, the random polymers P12, P13, and P14, which differ considerably in composition, showed higher PCEs that the reference copolymers. The value of Voc was in order P11 < P12 < P13 < P14 < P15, which is in accordance with the values of the HOMO energy levels of these polymers. We can easily explain the correlation between the content of BTQx and Voc by dependence of the HOMO energy level on the copolymer composition. The value of Jsc for the PSC based on P12, P13, and P14 was higher than for the copolymer counterparts. The PSC based on P13 showed the highest values of Jsc and FF.

The improvement in Jsc for the PSC based on the random terpolymers as compared to the PSC based on P11 and P15 was further confirmed by IPCE measurements as shown in Fig. 4b. The PSC based on P11 without the BTQx unit exhibited an IPCE response up to 900 nm with the highest value of 52%. The IPCE response of the PSC based on random terpolymers was extended with the increase in BTQx content. The random terpolymer P13 with 1:1 DPP/BTQx showed wider IPCE spectra with the highest value of IPCE of around 67.3%. The PSC based on P14 showed smaller values of IPCE in the overall spectrum range, except in the shorter wavelength region, regardless of its good absorption in the longer wavelength region. This may originate from its inferior morphology for effective exciton dissociation and charge transportation. The IPCE spectra of the P15-based polymer showed a dip in the wavelength region 550–850 nm, which may be the reason for the low value of Jsc for this device. The Jsc values of the PSCs estimated from integration of the IPCE spectra are shown in Table 3 and are in good agreement with the values observed in the J–V characteristics under illumination.
In order to get information about the hole and electron mobilities, the dark current–voltage characteristics of hole- and electron-only devices were estimated by fitting them with the space charge limited current model.41 The dark J–V characteristics of hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 5. Similar characteristics were also observed for electron-only devices. The charge-carrier mobility followed the same trends to their Jsc variation. P11 without BTQx exhibited a hole/electron mobility of 8.4 × 10−5/2.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while P15 without DPP showed a relatively small value of hole/electron mobility of 7.2 × 10−5/2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the DPP/BTQx ratio was 3/1 (P12) and 1/1 (P13), the hole/electron mobility was improved to 1.34 × 10−4/2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.98 × 10−4/2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When the DPP/BTQx ratio was 1/3 (P14), the value of hole/electron mobility was reduced to 1.16 × 10−4/2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ratio of electron to hole mobility (μe/μh) was 1.81 and 1.23 for P12 and P13—these values are less than that for P11 (2.75) and P15 (3.14), indicating that with the increase in the content of BTQx, the charge transport is more balanced, which is consistent with the trends in the values of Jsc.42,43

In order to get information about the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss), and charge-collection efficiency (Pcoll), we plotted the variation of the photocurrent density (Jph) with the effective voltage (Veff)44,45 for the PSCs and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The Jph is expressed as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is determined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage.46 It can be seen from Fig. 7 that at low values of Veff, the Jph linearly increases with the increase of Veff and approaches a saturation value (Jphsat) at a high value of Veff, indicating that all the photogenerated excitons are sufficiently dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. Moreover, the Jph is independent of the internal electric field and only depends on the light-harvesting efficiency of the active layer. The value of Gmax is determined as Gmax = Jphsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The values of Gmax were 1.02 × 1028 m−3 s−1, 1.05 × 1028 m−3 s−1, 1.12 × 1028 m−3 s−1, 1.07 × 1028 m−3 s−1, and 1.08 × 1028 m−3 s−1, for PSCs based on P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15, respectively which is consistent with the absorption profile of the respective random polymers. The highest value of Gmax for the P13-based PSC is consistent with the value of Jsc. The values of exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss)/charge-collection efficiency (Pcoll) were estimated from the Jph/Jphsat at short-circuit conditions/maximum power point, respectively and were 0.92/0.73, 0.935/0.75, 0.964/0.79, 0.954/0.76, and 0.975/0.746 for the PSCs based on P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15, respectively. These results indicate that by adjusting the ratio of BTQ and DPP acceptors in the random copolymers, exciton dissociation and charge collection can be controlled. The highest values of both Pdiss and Pcoll for P13 is consistent with the values of Jsc and FF, and therefore we conclude that the most effective charge dissociation and collection occur in the PSC based on the P13:PC71BM active layer. Moreover, the Jph value tends to saturate at a low value of Veff for the PSC based on the P13:PC71BM active layer, indicating that for this device, a low value of effective internal field is required to sweep out the photo-charge carriers toward the electrodes as compared to for the other PSCs.47,48
 Fig. 6  Variation of photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for the PSCs. 
 Fig. 7  Variation of (a) Jsc and (b) Voc with illumination intensity (Pin) for the PSCs. 
Assuming that Pdiss is strongly related to the germinate recombination kinetics in the active layers, we investigated the dependence of Voc with the illumination intensity (Pin) (Fig. 7b) and following the relationship Voc ∝ (nkT/q)lnPin, where n is the diode ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge.45 When the value of n was two, it implied that the device had bimolecular recombination, whereas when the slope was equal to unity, then trap-assisted recombination was dominant in the device. As shown in Fig. 7b, the slopes for the P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15 were 1.29, 1.23, 1.12, 1.18, and 1.23kT/q, respectively. This indicates that the P13:PC71BM-based PSC exhibited the lowest germinate recombination rate among all the PSCs.48,49 The variation of Jsc with Pin (Fig. 7a) showed the power law relationship as Jsc ∝ (Pin)γ, where γ is the exponent factor. When the value of γ is close to unity, it demonstrates that efficient charge extraction occurred in the device prior to recombination in the active layer. The values of γ for PSCs based on P11, P12, P13, P14, and P15 were 0.92, 0.932, 0.96, 0.952, and 0.941, respectively and were well in accord with the values of FF. This implies that the PSC based on the P13:PC71BM active layer had the weakest charge-carrier losses for non-germinate recombination under short-circuit conditions.50,51 The overall effective exciton generation and their dissociation into free charge carriers and the extraction of charges with less recombination were in accordance with a synergetic enhancement in the values of FF and Jsc for the PSC based on P13 as compared to others.
Moreover, the X-ray diffraction pattern for the optimized P11: or P13: or P15:PC71BM were measured to investigate the molecular ordering and crystalline nature of the active layers and the results are shown in Fig. 8. A sharp and intense peak (100) was observed for all the thin films located at 2θ = 4.86°, corresponding to a lamellar stacking distance of about 1.82 nm. A second peak (010) corresponding to π–π stacking (2θ = 23.21°) was also observed for all the active layers with a π–π stacking distance of 0.375 nm. In addition to these two peak, one additional peak located at 2θ = 18.45° also appeared, corresponding to the diffraction peak of PC71BM. Among these three active layers, the P13:PC71BM thin film showed the strongest and sharpest lamellar and π–π stacking diffraction peaks as compared to P11:PC71BM and P15:PC71BM thin films. These results demonstrate that the intermolecular stacking was better ordered in the P13:PC71BM thin film as compared to the other films, which is beneficial for the charge transport in the PSCs and leads to an improvement in the FF and in the overall PCE.52,53

Conclusion
We synthesized a number of new narrow bandgap D–A copolymers containing two acceptor blocks (DPP and BTQx) with varied molar ratios. The P13 copolymer with a DPP:BTQx = 1:1 molar ratio showed a relatively strong absorption covering the entire visible and near NIR ranges. The P13:PC71BM-based PSCs showed a higher value of PCE of about 9.20% among all the polymers. Moreover, the P13- and P14-based random polymers showed higher values of PCE than the corresponding D–A copolymer counterparts, i.e., P11 and P15. This may be related to the more balanced charge transport, increased exciton generation rate and charge collection, and reduced germinate recombination. As shown above, systematic variation of the ratio of the two acceptors made it possible to finely tune the HOMO/LUMO levels and bandgaps of the copolymers. Currently these polymers are being integrated into organic photovoltaic devices Also, this approach is being applied to other D–A systems. Therefore, the design of a terpolymer donor consisting of two donors and two acceptors in the same molecular backbone is more favorable for PSCs as compared to ternary PSCs, in which the active layer consists of either two donors/one acceptor or one donor/two acceptors.
Experimental part

Instruments and characterization methods. 

1H NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 500VHz spectrometer (CDCl3 as solvent). The number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) polymers’ molecular weights were measured through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Waters 717-2410 instrument with polystyrene as the reference standard and chloroform as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted under dry nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 on a PerkinElmer TGA 7. UV-Vis spectra of the dilute chloroform solution (10−5 M) were recorded using an Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. A solid film for UV-Vis analysis was obtained by spin-coating of the polymer solutions onto quartz substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymer films was performed using a “BAS-100” electrochemical analyzer operated at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The solvent was acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBACIO4 as the supporting electrolyte. Potentials were measured against a Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgCI) reference electrode. Fe/Fe+ was used as the internal standard (0.32 V).

Synthesis of the monomers and polymers
Toluene was dried and distilled over sodium/benzophenone. CHCI3 and CH3CN were dried with CaH2 and distilled prior to use. All the chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. All the chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (200–300 mesh). Compound 1 4,7-bis(4,5-didodecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole-5,6-diamine, compound 236 and monomer M3,36 2,6-di(trimethylstin)-4,8-di(dodecyloxo)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene (M1),37 and 2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)pyrrolo-[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (M2)38 were prepared according to the reported procedures.

Then, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was slowly poured into methanol (400 mL). The polymer was collected by filtration and then purified via Soxhlet extraction by washing sequentially with methanol, hexane, and chloroform for 20 h. The polymer was obtained from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation to yield the final polymer P11 as a dark solid with a 93% yield.

Device fabrication and characterization
The PSCs were fabricated on glass substrates patterned with indium tin oxide (ITO) with a resistivity of 10 Ω sq−1 with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al. The ITO patterned glass was cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonication for 10 min each. After drying in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h, the substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 30 min. The poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, VP AI 4083, Clevious) (∼40 nm) was spin-coated on clean ITO substrates at 3500 rpm for 30 s as a hole-transport layer and then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in air. An active layer solution mixture of the polymers and PC71BM (different weight ratios) (total concentration of 14 mg mL−1) in chloroform solvent was prepared, which was then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer under ambient conditions and dried at 50 °C for 2 h in order to remove the solvent residue. For the solvent vapour annealing, the active layers were placed in a Petri-dish containing THF for 40 s and then removed A methanol solution of PFN with a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was then spin-coated onto the top of the photoactive layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and was then dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h. Finally, an aluminum (Al) top electrode was deposited onto the top of the PFN buffer layer by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 1 × 10−5 Pa through a shadow mask area of 20 mm2.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under stimulated AM1.5G at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and the monochromator, and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions. The hole mobilities of the active layers were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of space charge limited current (SCLC) in the hole-only device with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au. The active layers were deposited under the same conditions as for the corresponding solar cells.
