    , Accepted 4th April 2019First published on 5th April 2019AbstractBased on the first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that a GeSe/SnSe heterostructure has type-II band alignment and a direct band gap, which can effectively prevent the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure also exhibits strong optical absorption intensity, which can reach the order of 105 cm−1. Our predicted photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) for the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure reaches 21.47%. We also found that the hole carrier mobility of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure along the x direction has been significantly improved to 6.42 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of black phosphorus (1 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1). By applying a vertical external electric field, we found that the band gap and band offset of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction can be effectively tuned. The revealed type-II band alignment, strong optical absorption, superior PCE and superior hole carrier mobility of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure imply that this new proposed material has broad application prospects in solar cells.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable interest owing to their unique properties and promising applications in many fields.1–3 In particular, graphene,2,3 an sp2-hybridized carbon monolayer with high carrier mobility, is considered to have great potential applications in nanoelectronics. However, the absence of an intrinsic band gap remains an obstacle to its application.4 Therefore, many new 2D materials have been investigated, such as the phosphorene5 and transition metal monochalcogenides.2 However, studies show that no single 2D material possesses perfect properties for practical applications. For example, phosphorene, the monolayer of black phosphorus, has an inherent direct band gap with high mobility charge carriers and can be easily exfoliated.6 But black phosphorus is easily oxidized when it is exposed to air.7,8 Therefore, various methods such as adsorption, application of an electric field or strain, and construction of heterojunctions have been proposed.9,10 Among these methods, heterostructuring is considered to be the most effective method as it retains the properties of both compounds well and is easily implemented in experiments.11 Heterostructures based on 2D layered materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),12 are considered to be useful as materials for next-generation solar cells. However, the photovoltaic efficiency of heterojunction solar cells that have been prepared is still not ideal.13
Recently, group-IV monochalcogenides (GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe) have attracted much attentions14,15 due to their high stability, low toxicity16,17 and analogous structure to that of phosphorene. A previous report18 had predicted the unique optical and electronic properties of monolayer GeSe and SnSe. Notably, using a GeSe thin-film as the material in a solar cell, the device exhibited very high stability and high photoelectric conversion efficiency. Using mechanical exfoliation and a laser thinning method, monolayer GeSe has been successfully fabricated recently by our group.19 Photoluminescence (PL) experiments of few-layer GeSe showed that eight continuous peaks from visible to infrared wavebands are present, which is highly preferred in the application of solar cells.19 Our first-principles calculations predicted that few layer GeSe with a layer number smaller than three exhibits a direct band gap. Moreover, the direct band gap in bilayer GeSe can be tuned in a wide range by applying strains along the armchair direction.20 Recently, Cheng et al.21 found by theoretical calculations that the heterojunction formed by the combination of group-III monochalcogenides has good photoelectric conversion efficiency. Especially, the InS/InSe heterostructure has a photoelectric conversion efficiency of up to 20%. For group-IV monochalcogenides, Lv et al.22 found that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the GeSe/SnS heterostructure reaches ∼18%. Theoretical studies by Xia et al.23 revealed a high optical absorption coefficient in the GeSe/SnS heterostructure, and in its components. The optical absorption coefficient was further improved after the formation of the heterojunction. This indicated that the heterojunction formed by group-IV monochalcogenides may have promising prospects in the applications of solar cells. It should be noted that, among the heterostructures formed between group-IV monochalcogenides, only the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction had been successfully prepared in experiments.24 For monolayer GeSe and SnSe, previous theoretical and experimental studies14,18 found that they have similar electronic properties and have excellent optical properties. Exploring the potential photovoltaic properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction is a fundamental method to obtain its possible application in solar cells. However, a study on the electronic and optical properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction is still absent. In this work, based on first-principles calculations, we studied the electronic and optical properties of a bilayer heterostructure composed of a GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer. We found that the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure has a direct band gap. Moreover, it exhibits high photoelectric conversion efficiency and unique optoelectronic properties.
Computational method
To study the structure and electronic properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, the open source code QUANTUM ESPRESSO25 based on the density functional theory (DFT)26 is used. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to describe the exchange and correlation potential.27,28 To correctly describe the effect of vdW interaction, the semi-empirical dispersion-corrected D3 scheme (DFT-D3) proposed by Grimme was used,29 which has been demonstrated to give a reliable description of the vdW heterostructure. A sufficiently large vacuum region of 20 Å is used to separate any interaction between neighboring layers along the y axis. The structure was optimized by using the method of Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS).30 The Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in a plane-wave basis with a cutoff energy of 70 Ry. The Brillouin zone (BZ) is sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack31 mesh with 13 × 1 × 13 k-points. In addition, the projected augmented wave potential is used to study the ion–electron interactions. The HSE06 (ref. 32) hybrid functional is also used to calculate the band structures. The electronic properties of the heterojunction under external electric fields and vertical strains are calculated by using the PBE method. Binding energy is defined as Eb = EGeSe/SnSe − (EGeSe + ESnSe), where EGeSe/SnSe is the total energy of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, and EGeSe and ESnSe are the total energies of monolayer GeSe and SnSe, respectively. To study the optical absorption properties, the optical absorption coefficient α(ω) is obtained by using the formula:  where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real part and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function, respectively.
The carrier mobility of the 2D GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is calculated based on the deformation potential (DP) theory,33 which is expressed as  where e is the electron charge, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature (300 K). The elastic modulus C2D is derived from C2D = [∂2E/∂(Δl/l)2]/S0, where E is the total energy and S0 is the area of the optimized supercell. m* is the effective mass in the transport direction. md is the average effective mass. The deformation potential constant E1 is expressed as E1 = ΔV/(Δl/l0), where ΔV represents the energy change of the band edge under strain.
The estimated photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is obtained using Scharber's method,34 in which the upper limit of the PCE in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed as following:  where βFF is the band fill factor, which is supposed to have a value of 0.65. The maximum open circuit voltage Voc is estimated using Edg − ΔEc − 0.3, where Edg is the band gap of the donor and ΔEc is the conduction band offset (CBO). P(ℏω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏω.
For comparison, we performed test calculations on the PCE and related parameters of GeSe/SnS heterostructures. The results are summarized in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. The comparison between our tested results obtained using the current method and related reported results in the literature proves that the method proposed here is robust.
Results and discussion
A. Geometric structure
Both GeSe and SnSe35 monolayers have an orthorhombic structure with four atoms per unit cell. By optimizing their unit cell, we obtained the lattice constants a = 4.26 Å and b = 3.99 Å in monolayer GeSe, and a = 4.36 Å and b = 4.28 Å in monolayer SnSe, respectively. Our obtained lattice constants agree well with previous theoretical35 and experimental results.14 In experiments, using a solution-mediated growth method, a vertical structure of GeSe/SnSe heterostructure has been prepared.24 For this reason, we only considered the vertical stacking of the possible GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. In order to explore the possible heterostructures through the stacking of single layer configurations of GeSe and SnSe, we built different stacking models for GeSe/SnSe heterostructures. In bilayer GeSe, it was proved that there is only a minor difference in energy between the configurations of AA stacking and AB stacking.36 In the SnSe bilayer, the AB-stacking was regarded as its stable ground state. Based on these considerations, we constructed three different stacking structures of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. As shown in previous reports, for AA-stacking, the top SnSe layer is directly stacked on the bottom GeSe monolayer. For AB-stacking, compared with AA-stacking, the top layer is shifted by half of the cell along the x and y directions, respectively. AC-stacking can be seen as the rotation of the top layer of the AA-stacking along the x axis for 180°. Their relaxed configurations are shown in Fig. 1. The lattice mismatches along the armchair and zigzag directions are about 1.1% and 3.1%, respectively, which are relatively small in the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. To evaluate the stability of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, we calculated the binding energies for the three proposed configurations. According to our calculations, the lowest binding energy is −33 meV Å−2, which is achieved in the configuration of AB-stacking. The configuration of AC-stacking has highest binding energy, which is −18 meV Å−2. In the case of AA-stacking, the binding energy is −23 meV Å−2. These binding energies have the same order of magnitude as other typical vdW crystals such as bilayer graphene (50 meV),37 graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (53 meV),38 graphene/phosphorene heterostructures (60 meV),39etc. Therefore, our results confirm that the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure in AB stacking is implementable. In a reported experiment,24 the specific stacking configuration of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure was unknown. Our calculation predicts a preferred configuration for the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, which is important for its future application in device design. In addition, the equilibrium distance between the interlayer of the GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer is 2.97 Å in AB-stacking configuration. To further explore the thermal stability of the AB-stacking GeSe/SnSe, we evaluate the evolution curves of the total energies by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As indicated in the ESI (Fig. S1†), our MD simulation indicates that the variation of free energy has only a slight oscillation along with the running steps. This proves that the thermal stability of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is robust under room temperature. The calculated phonon dispersions of monolayer GeSe, monolayer SnSe and the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure shown in Fig. S4† also verify their dynamic stability.

B. Electronic structures
To understand the electronic properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, we first calculated the band structures of monolayer GeSe and monolayer SnSe. As indicated in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the calculated band structure indicates that monolayer GeSe possesses a direct band gap of 1.71 eV, while monolayer SnSe exhibits an indirect band gap of 1.49 eV. Our obtained band gaps as given above are in good agreement with those in previous reports.19,35 For the GeSe/SnSe vdW heterostructure, the projected band structure is shown in Fig. 2(c). It indicates that the electronic structures of monolayer GeSe and monolayer SnSe are both well preserved in this heterostructure. Moreover, the formed heterostructure has a direct gap of 0.89 eV. This band gap is vital for the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure to achieve a high luminous effect due to its electronic transitions without the need for additional absorption or release of phonons. Meanwhile, the predicted 0.89 eV band gap in the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is suitable for possible optoelectronic conversion. Thus, the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is expected to have potential applications in optoelectronic devices. We can also observe from the projected band structure that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is dominated by the electronic states of the GeSe layer (red line), while the valence band maximum (VBM) is dominated by the electronic states of the SnSe layer (blue line). Moreover, our detailed analysis indicated that 89% component of the CBM originated from the states of GeSe monolayer and the remaining 11% component originated from the states of SnSe. For the VBM, it is found that only about 4% of the component originated from the states of the GeSe monolayer, while the remaining 96% originated from the states of the SnSe monolayer. The above characteristics indicate that the GeSe and SnSe monolayers form a type-II heterostructure. It was observed that the type-II heterostructure can facilitate the spontaneous separation of holes and electrons, which is preferable in the semiconductor industry. In addition, the band alignment and band offset of the heterostructure are crucial factors in the application of electronic devices. In our calculations, the band alignment of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is obtained using the vacuum level as a common energy reference. As shown in Fig. 2(d), our result indicates that both the CBM and VBM of GeSe are lower in energy than those of SnSe, which further demonstrates that the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is a type-II heterostructure. According to the Anderson limit,40 the CBO and valence band offset (VBO) of the heterostructure can be directly computed from the difference in electron affinity (along the x direction) or ionization energy between the components of hetero 2D materials. In our case, the evaluated CBO and VBO of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure are 0.06 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively.

The projected band structure of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is plotted in (c). The red and blue circle sizes reflect the weight of monolayer GeSe and SnSe in the band structure of the GeSe/SnSe configuration. (d) represents the band alignment of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. 
To further explain the electronic structure of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, we show the partial density of states (PDOS) and partial charge densities of the CBM and the VBM in Fig. 3. From the PDOS shown in Fig. 3(a), it can be observed that the upper valence band (VB) and bottom conduction band (CB) of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure are contributed by both s and p orbitals, while the main component of the DOS is the p orbitals. It can be found from Fig. 3(b) that the VBM and CBM of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure are dominated by the 4p states of the Se atoms and 4p states of the Ge atoms, respectively. Moreover, the partial charge densities indicate that the charge density of the VBM is mainly located around the Se atoms in the SnSe layer. The charge density of the CBM is mainly attributed to the localization of charge density around the Ge atoms in the GeSe layer. These findings for the VBM and CBM are in agreement with the above PDOS analysis. In addition, the work functions of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure and its components are obtained using the following formula:ϕ = Evac − EFwhere Evac is the energy level of a stationary electron in the vacuum near the surface and EF is the Fermi level. Our calculated results show that the work functions for the GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer are 4.66 eV and 4.33 eV, respectively. In contrast, the work function of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is 4.71 eV. The difference in work functions between GeSe and SnSe indicates that the electrons flow from the GeSe layer to the SnSe layer.

(b) represents the front view of the isosurface of the differential charge density with an isovalue of 1.5 × 10−3e Å−3. The blue and red colours represent loss and gain of electrons, respectively. 
In order to understand the charge transfer between the GeSe layer and SnSe layer, we calculated the plane differential charge density (DCD) Δρ(y) along the direction normal to the surface, which is defined as follows:Δρ(y) = ∫ρGeSe/SnSe(x, y, z)dxdz − ∫ρGeSe(x, y, z)dxdz − ∫ρSnSe(x, y, z)dxdzwhere ρGeSe/SnSe(x, y, z), ρGeSe(x, y, z), and ρSnSe(x, y, z) are the charge densities at the (x, y, z) point of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 3(c), charge is accumulated near the side of monolayer GeSe while it is depleted on the side of the SnSe monolayer. Therefore, charge rearrangement occurs at the interface of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. Moreover, our Lowdin charge analysis proves that there is 0.046e per atom transferred from the SnSe layer to the GeSe layer.
Previous theoretical and experimental studies indicated that monolayer GeSe and monolayer SnSe have excellent optical properties, which have potential applications in the field of flexible photovoltaics. Moreover, Xue et al.18 found that the constructed model of CdS/GeSe heterojunction thin-film solar cells exhibited a PCE of 1.48%. Stimulated by these investigations, we studied the optoelectronic properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), we obtained the optical absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength along the armchair and zigzag directions of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. Our results show that both the GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer exhibit a high absorption coefficient from visible light to ultraviolet light. Our results show that the optical absorption intensity of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure can reach a magnitude of ∼105 cm−1. Moreover, the absorption coefficient of monolayer GeSe and monolayer SnSe along the armchair direction is higher than that along the zigzag direction, indicating anisotropic characteristics. For the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, the light absorption intensity is significantly improved when compared to that for the GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer. Moreover, the light absorption intensity along the armchair direction is different from that along the zigzag direction, and exhibits similar characteristics to that in the corresponding monolayer components. Since the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure has strong optical absorption intensity combined with type-II band alignment, it shows great application prospects in solar cells. We further studied its PCE following Scharber's method.34Fig. 4(c) shows the PCE contour plots of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. It can be found that the value of PCE is affected by the CBO and the donor band gap. As mentioned in our analysis of the band structure, the donor layer is monolayer SnSe with a band gap of 1.49 eV, and the value of the CBO of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is 0.06 eV. Following the PCE definition mentioned in the part of computational method, we found that the PCE of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure reaches 21.47%. This result is higher than the theoretical value for many other heterostructures, such as bilayer phosphorene/MoS2 (16–18%)41 and GeSe/SnS (18%)22 heterostructures. The obtained high PCE in the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is even comparable to the PCE of polycrystalline CdTe thin films (21.5%)42 and perovskite (22.1%).43 Since the two compounds of the same family are similar in atomic structure and electronic properties, the value of the CBO will be relatively small after forming a heterojunction, such as in the cases of GeSe/SnS (0.23 eV)22 and WeS2/MoTe2 (0.14 eV) heterojunctions. More importantly, compared to TMD based heterostructures or phosphorene-based heterostructures, group-IV monochalcogenides exhibit a more suitable donor band gap (1–1.73 eV). In particular, the band gap of SnSe, which is more suitable as a donor layer, is 1.49 eV. Thus, the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure has a higher PCE than its component monolayers. By analyzing the optical absorption coefficient and PCE of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, it can be proved that the heterostructure composed of the GeSe monolayer and SnSe monolayer is very suitable for application in solar cells. Based on the experimental results reported by Xue et al.,18 we propose a solar cell model of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 4(d), we use Au and ITO as the electrode materials, with the GeSe layer as the acceptor and the SnSe layer as the donor, respectively. Once photons are absorbed, electron transition could happen between the donor and acceptor.

(c) Contour plot of power conversion efficiency (%) of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure. (d) Schematic illustration of the thin-film solar cell. 
The carrier mobility is also a critical factor in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, based on the deformation potential theory33 proposed by Bardeen and Shockley, we use the Takagi model to calculate the carrier mobility. The calculated carrier mobilities of monolayer GeSe and SnSe and their heterostructure are summarized in Table 1. We can find that the mobility of single-layer GeSe and single-layer SnSe is anisotropic along the zigzag direction and armchair direction, respectively. They exhibit a high electron mobility up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the zigzag direction. The electron mobility of monolayer GeSe and monolayer SnSe in the armchair direction is lower than that along the zigzag direction. This is because the electron mobility along the zigzag direction is more sensitive to the changes of the energy band caused by lattice deformation than that along the armchair direction. Moreover, the hole mobility of single-layer GeSe and SnSe is an order of magnitude smaller than the electron mobility. The calculated results are in good agreement with previous results.44,45 For the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, electron mobility is reduced compared to that in the single layer structures. However, the hole mobility has been improved relative to that in their corresponding single-layer structures. The hole mobility reaches 6.42 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the zigzag direction, which is even higher than the hole mobility of phosphorene (1.31 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the hole mobility of β-GeSe (2.93 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1). The main reason for the large increase in the hole mobility is that the energy of the VBM of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure undergoes only minor changes when subjected to lattice deformation, hence the value of the deformation potential also becomes very small. However, DP theory still exists limitation in describing the mobility.46 The specific value should be verified from the experiment.

In vertical heterojunctions, electric fields can be used as an effective way to tune their electronic properties. Here, we have performed simulations by applying electric fields from −0.2 V Å−1 to 0.4 V Å−1 in the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction along the vertical direction (y direction). The positive electric field is applied from the upper GeSe layer to the bottom SnSe layer, while the negative electric field is applied in the opposite direction with an interval step of 0.05 V Å−1. The plots in Fig. 5 show how the electronic properties of GeSe/SnSe heterojunctions are influenced by applying electric fields. The evolution of the band gap value as a function of the electric field is shown in Fig. 5(a). When a electric field along y axis is applied, the energy band gap of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction is transferred from a direct band gap to an indirect band gap. Meanwhile, the type of band gap is also changed from type-II to type-I. It can be found that the band gap first increases with the increase of the electric fields and then decreases slowly. Our results show that the band gap is decreased rapidly after the electric field becomes larger than 0.2 V Å−1. If the applied electric field is negative, the characteristics of the direct band gap in the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction are retained. This means that the band type of type-II is also retained. The band gap is decreased linearly with an increasing applied electric field along the negative direction. Under an electric field of 0.15 V Å−1, the band gap is decreased to zero, which means the transition from semiconductor to metal is occur in the heterostructure. Hence, it can be found that the band gap of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction is sensitive to the applied electric fields. In particular, the band type under electric fields applied along the positive direction is mainly affected by the small CBO of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction. When electric fields along the negative direction are applied, the distribution of electrons between layers will change. Due to this reason, the corresponding changes of band gap in the component layers are different. As shown in Fig. 5(b), when an electric field along the negative direction is applied, the energy band of SnSe and the energy band of GeSe are decreased linearly with the increase of electric fields. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the CBO and VBO of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction are also increased with the increase of the negative electric field. So the type of the band is still type-II. When the electric field becomes positive, the band gap of SnSe and GeSe is increased first and then is decreased rapidly. As shown in Fig. 5(d), CBO starts to decrease when the electric field is increased from 0.0 V Å−1 to 0.05 V Å−1. Under these electric fields, the CBM of GeSe is larger than the CBM of SnSe. Therefore, the band type has been changed from type-II to type-I and the CBO size tends to be stable when the applied electric field is gradually increased to 0.22 V Å−1.

Conclusions
We investigate the structural, optical and electronic properties of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure based on DFT calculations. Our results demonstrated that the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is highly stable at room temperature. The type-II band alignment and a direct band gap are found in the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure, and can effectively prevent the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure also exhibits strong optical absorption intensity, which can reach the order of 105. Notably, the predicted PCE for the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure can reach 21.47%. Our predicted PCE for the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure is even higher than that for many other reported heterostructures. We also found that the hole carrier mobility of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure along the x direction has been significantly improved to 6.42 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of black phosphorus (1 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1). By applying a vertical external electric field, we found that the band gap and band offset of the GeSe/SnSe heterojunction can be effectively tuned. Moreover, the type of band alignment will be transferred from type-II to type-I under electric fields applied along the negative y direction. The revealed type-II band alignment, strong optical absorption, superior PCE and superior hole carrier mobility of the GeSe/SnSe heterostructure imply that this new proposed material has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells.
