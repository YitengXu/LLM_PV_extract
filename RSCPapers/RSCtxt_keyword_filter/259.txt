    , Accepted 18th November 2021First published on 19th November 2021AbstractAs sandwiched hole transporting material (HTM) layers are in direct contact with up-coated perovskite layers and bottom electrodes in p–i–n structured perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs), the film quality of HTMs determines the morphological properties of the perovskite absorbent. To achieve excellent surface morphology of HTM films, two asymmetric structured HTMs featuring methoxytriphenylamine electron donors and imidazole cores, were successfully developed through two simple reactions of cyclization and Buchwald–Hartwig coupling. DI-TPA was designed by incorporating an extra methoxytriphenylamine unit in the C2 site of the imidazole core, whereas an isolated benzene ring was introduced for DI–Ar. The asymmetrical conformation contributes to high glass transition temperatures and supports thermal-stable amorphous properties in both HTM films. Compared with DI–Ar, DI-TPA featuring with an extended backbone realizes more effective capability of hole extraction arising from the enhanced intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state. Consequently, the i-PSC with DI-TPA as a dopant-free HTM generates an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 16.54%, significantly exceeding that with DI-Ar (13.77%). It should be noted that the efficiency is shown to outperform that of commercial dopant-free HTM PEDOT:PSS (13.41%) under the same condition. This work offers a fundamental strategy by reinforcing electron donation to improve the hole mobility of asymmetric HTMs for dopant-free p–i–n structured inverted PSCs.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown skyrocketing development with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) surging from 3.8% to a certified 25.5%.1–6 To date, two typical device configurations are explored as n–i–p structured regular PSCs (r-PSCs) and p–i–n structured inverted PSCs (i-PSCs).7–13 Compared with r-PSCs, the i-PSCs with low-temperature fabrication processing and suppressed hysteresis effects exhibit promising applications in large-scale flexible devices and laminated Si-PSCs.13–16 In i-PSCs, the hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play a vital role in hole extraction and transport. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as a HTM in i-PSCs. However, PEDOT:PSS with a mismatching energy level and hygroscopicity results in poor efficiency and stability of the i-PSC devices.14,17 Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel HTMs that could replace PEDOT:PSS to improve device performance and stability.
It should be noted that as the sandwiched HTM layers are in direct contact with up-coated perovskite layers and bottom ITO electrodes in p–i–n structured PSCs, the film quality of HTMs also determines the morphological properties of the upper perovskite absorbent. Therefore, in addition to thermal stability, suitable energy level and good solubility, the essential prerequisite for efficient i-PSCs is to employ HTMs with superior uniformity morphology and high hole mobility.
To achieve excellent surface morphology of HTM films, lower/non-symmetric structural HTMs have attracted extensive research attention. Wong and co-workers18 presented a twisted molecule XY1 achieving an uniform and smoother film, which afforded a PCE of 17.82% and 18.87% in large-area (1.00 cm2) and small-area devices, respectively. Kim et al.19 incorporated a trifluoropropoxy-substituted asymmetric carbazole derivative cited as SCT-405s, exhibiting a stable amorphous state and possessing a high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 183 °C. Li’ groups20 propose a strategy of lowering the molecular symmetry to improve amorphous morphological films. In this work, a spirobisindane structured core was used to construct HTM spiro-I, which forms a uniform amorphous film with stable morphology. However, Li et al. also stated that the twisted structure of Spiro-I is likely to cause low hole mobility due to the poor π–π interaction. Therefore, it is of importance to seek a balance between good film morphology and effective carrier transport for HTMs.
Imidazole is a five-membered heterocycle with two distinct nitrogen atoms, severally exhibiting pyrrole-like electron-rich and pyridine-like electron-deficient properties. This disparate electronic property makes the imidazole moiety present an asymmetric structure. Thus, the imidazole core is suitable for building asymmetric molecules. Triphenylamine (TPA) possesses strong electron-donating capabilities and intramolecular charge transfer ability, which is a versatile unit for organic chromophores in PSCs, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), etc.21,22 In addition, Huang23 referred that driven by the properties of electron delocalization, the electron of TPA group was able to be delocalized through a π-bridge, and further formed radical cations. The para-substituted methoxy groups in per radical TPA units provide resonance stabilization for charge and radical in HTMs. Furthermore, it was also reported that oxidizing the nitrogen in TPA units to a radical cation could favor to enhance the conductivity of HTMs.24,25 Therefore, the introduction of quantified TPA donors to the asymmetric imidazole core is expected to avoid the demerit of low hole mobility of asymmetric molecules and construct efficient HTMs for i-PSCs.
Herein, we incorporated triphenylamine (TPA) donors into the imidazole building core to construct two asymmetric HTMs, cited as DI-TPA and DI-Ar (Fig. 1a), respectively. DI-TPA has been reported as a reference in our previous work.26 The introduction of extra TPA units into DI-TPA aims to reinforce the electron-donation ability and further enhance the hole mobility of HTM. In this work, the effects of donors like phenyl ring for DI-Ar and triphenylamine (TPA) for DI-TPA were investigated. In addition, their optoelectronic property, conductivity, hole mobility, and thermal and photovoltaic properties were systematically studied. It is demonstrated that the reinforced electron-donation of DI-TPA not only enhances its hole mobility but also decreases charge recombination within the i-PSCs. These make i-PSCs endowed with DI-TPA as a dopant-free HTM generating a champion PCE of 16.54%, surpassing those with DI-Ar (13.77%) and PEDOT:PSS (13.41%).

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Chemical synthesis
The designed synthetic procedures of DI-Ar and DI-TPA are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). DI-Ar and DI-TPA were synthesized via two simple steps of cyclization and Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction with total yields of 88% and 90%, respectively. All chemicals and solvents were of pure grade and used without further purification. The structures of HTMs were characterized by the NMR method and the corresponding spectrograms are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S6–S8).
2.2 Material characterization and device fabrication
The fabrication process of devices and the characterization of materials including differential scanning calorimetry, ultraviolet-visible measurement, fluorescence spectra, cyclic voltammetry, hole mobility, conductivity, emission scanning electron microscopy, and steady-state photoluminescence are described in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The molecular orbital levels of HTMs matching with perovskite are a fundamental basis for evaluating their potential in i-PSCs. Therefore, UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL) spectra and cyclic voltammograms of DI-Ar and DI-TPA in CH2Cl2 (DCM) were characterized. As shown in Fig. 2b, DI-Ar shows one maximum absorption peak at 313 nm, while DI-TPA presents a major peak at 300 nm and a shoulder peak at 345 nm. The broadened absorption spectrum indicates that an extended π-conjugation exists in DI-TPA molecules.27 The band gaps (Eg) of DI-Ar and DI-TPA in DCM (10−5 M) were estimated from the intersection point of normalized UV-vis absorption and PL spectra curves (λint) with 3.17 eV and 3.11 eV for DI-Ar and DI-TPA, respectively. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared with DI-Ar, the relatively narrow Eg of DI-TPA suggests an increased conjugated length in molecules, which is consistent with UV-vis absorption results.

Alternatively, the electrochemical property of two HTMs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene as the internal standard (Fig. S1, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbitals (EHOMO) were determined to be −5.10 eV and −5.05 eV for Di-Ar and DI-TPA, respectively. These obtained EHOMO data are lower than that of the reference PEDOT:PSS (−5.00 eV), which is beneficial for obtaining a higher voltage in HTM-based i-PSCs.28,29 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELOMO) were calculated to be −1.93 eV for DI-Ar and −1.96 eV for DI-TPA according to the equation Eg = ELUMO − EHOMO, respectively. Obviously, as presented in Fig. 2d, the energy level of DI-Ar and DI-TPA matches well with that of the perovskite layer (MAPbI3, −5.4 to −3.9 eV), implying that these two HTMs possess good hole capture ability and effectively inhibit the electron transfer from the perovskite to the electrode.
In order to gain insights into the geometrical configurations and electrostatic potential surface (ESP) of two HTMs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the electronegative area (marked by red) spreads throughout the “CN” moiety of imidazole, and the electropositive area (marked by blue) is distributed over the side electron-donor units. The extra installation of triphenylamine (TPA) donor contributes more electropositive area, which favors molecular polarization and charge delocalization. According to reports,23,24 the decrease of electrons of methoxy in TPA units could promote the electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM layer (Fig. 1b). The calculated molecular conformations from the side view are shown in Fig. 2a. In comparison with DI-Ar, the DI-TPA exhibits a relatively planar π-conjugated backbone due to the weakened twisted configuration. This improved planarity of the backbone in DI-TPA could enhance intramolecular charge delocalization and intermolecular π–π interaction. As depicted in Fig. 2c, compared to the absorption in solution, both HTM films exhibit bathochromic shifting with peaks located at 356 nm for DI-Ar and 363 nm for DI-TPA, respectively. The more obvious red-shift of DI-TPA in relation to DI-Ar could arise due to the effective intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state.30
3.2 Thermal stability, hole mobility, conductivity, film wettability
As presented in Fig. 3a, the glass-transition temperature (Tg) value of DI-TPA is observed at 109 °C, higher than that of DI-Ar (101 °C). This result indicates that both DI-Ar and DI-TPA exhibit amorphous properties in the film state.
 Fig. 3  (a) Different scanning calorimetry of HTMs. (b) Hole mobility measured by the SCLC method. (c) Conductivity measurements. 
High hole mobility and conductivity of HTMs are the keys for PSCs to obtain excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). In order to understand the influence of extra electron-donating methoxytriphenylamine as the peripheral unit, the hole mobility (μh) measurements of HTM films were performed by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method under dark conditions. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 3b, the hole mobility of DI-TPA and DI-Ar films was determined to be 2.43 × 10−5 cm2 v−1 s−1 and 6.32 × 10−6 cm2 v−1s−1, respectively. Compared with DI-Ar, the higher hole mobility of the DI-TPA film is probably due to the introduction of an extra TPA arm, which significantly enhances intramolecular charge delocalization and intermolecular π–π interactions. Similarly, the conductivity value of the undoped DI-TPA film was 7.07 × 10−4 S cm−1, which outperformed that of DI-Ar (4.39 × 10−5 S cm−1). In addition, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the fluorescence of the two HTMs gradually decreased as the water ratio increased in the mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water, which is consistent with the phenomenon of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).31,32 When the percentage of water reaches 80%, DI-Ar in the aggregated state retains more fluorescence in comparison to DI-TPA. This result indicates that more energy in DI-Ar molecules is lost in the way of fluorescence emission. In contrast, this kind of energy loss was reduced for charge transport in DI-TPA molecules. Hence, the undoped DI-TPA presents good charge carrier capability in the film state, which enables it to be an effective HTM in i-PSCs.
The surface wettability of HTMs is responsible for perovskite crystallization.13,33–35 Thus, we probed the water and perovskite precursor (MAPbI3) contact angle on these two HTM films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the water and perovskite precursor contact angle of DI-TPA were determined to be 90.9° and 36.2°, respectively, which were comparable to that of DI-Ar (90.6° and 35.6°, severally). It is suggested that the surface hydrophobicity of the two HTMs could enable effective deposition of the perovskite precursor with full film coverage. Alternatively, the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) surface images show that the perovskite films grown on DI-TPA and DI-Ar exhibit approximate crystal morphology in terms of grain sizes (about 150–350 nm) and dense films (Fig. 4b). The cross-sectional SEM images of ITO/HTMs/Perovskite were acquired, and they are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Since the concentration of HTMs is low (∼ 3–5 mg mL−1) and the HTM layer is very thin, it is difficult to clearly distinguish the difference among HTMs. In addition, the perovskite deposited on the HTM layers show a similar sharp crystal. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were further used to test the crystallinity of perovskite films deposited on all HTLs. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the perovskite films deposited on these three HTMs display the same space group of I4/mcm, which is a tetragonal MAPbI3 structure.36 In addition, Fig. S4b (ESI†) implies that the DI-TPA-based perovskite exhibits a slightly higher intensity and a smaller full width at half maxima (FWHM) peaks in contrast to DI-Ar in the (110) plane. These results demonstrate DI-TPA-based perovskite films with improved crystallinity. In addition, the peak intensity of PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite solar cells is lower than that of DI-Ar and DI-TPA.

3.3 Photovoltaic performance
Based on the aforementioned experiments, DI-TPA demonstrates its characteristics as a promising efficient hole-transporting material in i-PSCs. Thus, the planar p–i–n PSCs with an architecture of ITO/HTMs/Perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance, in which MAPbI3 was used as the perovskite active layer (Fig. 5a). HTM DI-Ar was used as a control. The details of the device fabrication method are described in the ESI.†Fig. 5b illustrates the Current density–Voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing i-PSCs devices collected under the AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. It is found that the best-performing i-PSC device using DI-TPA as the HTM delivers an encouraging PCE up to 16.54% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 22.28 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73%. In contrast, the optimized reference devices based on DI-Ar and PEDOT:PSS as HTMs yield much lower PCEs of 13.77% and 13.41%, respectively, under similar processing conditions. Although the PCE of PEDOT:PSS-based i-PSCs is lower than that reported,37 DI-TPA with an improved PCE relative to PEDOT:PSS shows a promising application in i-PSCs. In addition, the J–V curves of devices based on DI-TPA show a small current hysteresis, which is similar to that of PEDOT:PSS and much better than that of DI-Ar (Fig. S5, ESI†).

Fig. 5d shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of two HTM-based devices. It can be clearly seen that DI-Ar and DI-TPA exhibit good IPCE performance with more than 75% response in 400–750 nm. The integrated photocurrent is 20.63 mA cm−2 for DI-Ar, 21.33 mA cm−2 for DI-TPA, and 19.98 mA cm−2 for PEDOT:PSS respectively. Herein the integrated Jsc values are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5c, DI-TPA-based devices exhibit high reproducibility demonstrated by its narrow PCE distribution. The average PCE of i-PSCs with DI-TPA is 15.32%, exceeding those of DI-Ar (12.55%) and PEDOT:PSS (12.91%). The significantly improved PCE of DI-TPA arises from its higher Jsc, Voc and FF.
The charge transfer dynamic between HTM layers and perovskite films has susceptibility to the Jsc. Therefore, the hole-extracting capability of different HTMs was investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements with the excitation at 500 nm. The experiment was performed based on a structure of ITO/HTMs/perovskite and the pristine perovskite film coated on the ITO substrate as the control. As presented in Fig. 5e, the broad PL band of the pristine perovskite film was concentrated at 756 nm. After incorporation with HTMs, the PL intensity was quenched by 72% for DI-TPA, 66% for DI-Ar, and 27% for PEDOT:PSS. DI-TPA shows the strongest PL quenching ability, implying efficient hole extraction/transfer between the interface of MAPbI3 and HTMs layers. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5f and Table S2 (ESI†), it is obvious that the charge lifetime (τagv) is in the order of DI-TPA < DI-Ar < PEDOT:PSS. The results are consistent with the steady-state PL spectra. The better hole extraction ability of DI-TPA may be partly caused by the larger hole mobility as well as better film morphology. The better hole transfer ability of DI-TPA resulted in improved Jsc.
Although DI-Ar possess a deeper HOMO energy level, its Voc is much lower than that of DI-TPA. This could result from a detrimental charge recombination.11,17,38 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to expedite the recombination dynamic inside i-PSCs, and the Nyquist plots were fitted by a conventional equivalent circuit inserted in Fig. 6a. The recombination resistances (Rrec) of DI-TPA-based i-PSCs are higher than that of DI-Ar, indicating that the charge recombination behaviour was restrained. The above-mentioned results imply that the extended triphenylamine donor in DI-TPA is favourable for increasing the hole transfer ability and retards interfacial carrier recombination, further contributing to enhanced Voc for i-PSCs.

The inserted image is the selected equivalent circuit. (b) Device stability test of i-PSCs with DI-Ar and PEDOT:PSS stored in RH 40% and 30 °C environment. 
According to the report, FF is closely related to the low series resistances (Rs) in PSCs.39 Improving the conductivity and hole mobility of HTM favors enhancement in the FF. As shown in Fig. 3b–c and 5f, the higher conductivity and mobility result in a faster hole extraction for DI-TPA-based i-PSCs. In addition, better crystal quality of perovskites coated on DI-TPA (Fig. S4, ESI†) leads to low charge recombination and higher FF. The increased FF further triggers the performance improvement for DI-TPA.
In addition to PCE, device stability is one of key parameters to evaluate a promising HTM for PSCs. The designed HTM with improved performance, DI-TPA, was used for the device stability test. The commercialized HTM PEDOT:PSS was used as the control. As presented in Fig. 6b, after storing in an environment with 40% RH at 30 °C, the unencapsulated i-PSCs with PEDOT:PSS maintain 55% of the initial PCE over 144 h. In contrast, the i-PSCs with DI-TPA show better stability with 66% value of the initial efficiency. As reported,14,17 the inherent hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS deleteriously accelerates the decomposition of perovskites and weakens the device stability.
4 Conclusions
In summary, two asymmetric HTMs, namely, DI-TPA and DI-Ar, with imidazole as the central core have been successfully synthesized and applied as dopant-free HTMs in p–i–n structured PSCs. It was found that DI-TPA with the extended electron donor methoxytriphenylamine into the imidazole core delivers a more planar backbone than that of reference DI-Ar with an isolated benzene ring as the peripheral unit. The DI-TPA shows a superior hole transport ability. Consequently, the i-PSC device with DI-TPA generates an encouraging PCE of 16.54%, surpassing those with DI-Ar (13.77%) and commercial HTM PEDOT:PSS (13.41%). These results indicated that reinforcing electron donation can achieve effective HTMs to be utilized in p–i–n structured PSCs without any dopant.
