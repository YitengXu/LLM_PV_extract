    , Accepted 1st June 2022First published on 1st June 2022AbstractA series of new conjugated polymers has been synthesized and investigated as absorber and hole-transport layer materials, respectively, in organic and perovskite solar cells (OSCs and PSCs). Organic solar cells were assembled using fullerene ([C60]PCBM) and in some cases also non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC-M, EH-IDTBR and O-IDTBR. A strong impact of the chemical structure of the synthesized polymers on the performance of organic solar cells has been revealed. The introduction of fluorine atoms in the thiophene rings and, in particular, using fluorinated phenyl substituents in the benzodithiophene fragment resulted in improved open-circuit voltages as compared to those of structurally similar polymers comprising neither fluorine atoms nor phenyl residues. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of OSCs were correlated with the nanoscale morphology of the composite films revealed by atomic force microscopy and infrared scattering near-field optical microscopy (IR s-SNOM) techniques. The polymer film uniformity also impacted the performance of perovskite solar cells, and so the highest efficiency of 18.8% was obtained using a conjugated polymer with the best film formation properties induced by branched solubilizing side chains. Thus, the obtained results improve the understanding of the relationship between the polymer structure and the device photovoltaic performance, which is of crucial importance for the rational design of new polymeric materials for efficient and stable OSCs and PSCs.
Introduction
Organic π-conjugated polymers, due to their excellent optical, electronic, and charge-transport properties, have found many applications in various organic and hybrid electronic devices, in particular, in solar cells. Indeed, conjugated polymers have been actively explored as absorber components in organic solar cells (OSCs) and as hole- and electron-transport layer materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
The main advantages of polymeric materials are the tunability of their optical and electronic properties, high thermal stability, efficient light absorption and high solubility enabling the use of liquid-phase printing and coating methods for depositing the photoactive layer.1,2 In addition, electronic devices based on polymeric materials are characterized by high mechanical strength, flexibility and light weight, which opens up new possibilities for their practical use.3,4 Last, but not least, conjugated polymers are considered as environmentally friendly materials.
The use of the push–pull concept represents one of the most promising strategies for the development of high-performance donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with tailored optical and electronic properties.5 Recently, a record-breaking light conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.6% was reported for OSCs based on a D–A polymer and non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) material, which narrows the efficiency gap between organic solar cells and mainstream inorganic PV technologies using crystalline silicon or metal chalcogenides.6
The optimal choice of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing fragments enables efficient tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energies, the band gap, and the charge-carrier mobilities of the material. All these parameters are important in the design of polymer-based absorber materials, as they have a significant impact on the device performance and stability.7 In particular, deep-lying HOMO energy levels and a small band gap of conjugated polymers could lead to a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and efficient photocurrent generation in OSCs.8–13
Tuning the frontier energy levels of conjugated polymers is also crucially important for the development of polymeric hole-transport layer (HTL) materials for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.14–16 In particular, it is necessary to align the HOMO energy of the polymeric HTL material with the perovskite valence band to ensure efficient and selective extraction of holes from the absorber layer of PSCs.17,18
Most of the electron donor moieties used in the design of efficient D–A conjugated polymers are based on thiophene derivatives since they enable an optimal combination of physicochemical and optoelectronic properties.19 Similarly, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is one of the most commonly used electron-withdrawing units since it is characterized by easy synthesis, excellent photochemical and oxidative stability and optimal frontier energy levels.20–22 Previously, we demonstrated that alternation of thiophene (T) and benzothiadiazole (B) units leads to conjugated oligomers (e.g. TBTBT23) and polymers such as (XTBTBT)n and (XTTBTBTT)n with advanced optoelectronic properties.20 The systematic variation of the X unit in the polymer structure showed great promise in designing polymers with benzodithiophene (BDT) blocks.24,25 Indeed, BDT derivatives represent one of the most widely utilized families of electron donor building blocks, which were used to design many highly efficient absorber materials for organic photovoltaics.26–29
Although a lot of research has been devoted to the synthesis and investigation of different types of conjugated polymers, there is still no clear understanding of the relationships between the chemical structure of the materials and their photovoltaic performance. In this regard, we present here the synthesis and systematic study of a series of structurally similar conjugated polymers P1–P8, which have the same conjugated backbone (BDTTTBTBTT)n and differ only in the substituents at the BDT core (Scheme 1). We analyse thoroughly the relationships between the structure of these polymers and their optical and electronic properties, morphology and uniformity of the polymer and composite films and the impact of all these parameters on the performance of the materials in OSCs and PSCs.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of polymers P1–P8. 
Experimental
All solvents and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers (Acros Organics, Sigma-Aldrich) and were either used as received or purified using standard methods. Monomers D1 and D4–D6 are commercially available and could be synthesized by standard methods.27,30,31 All obtained compounds were purified to achieve a purity of at least 99.5% according to HPLC or GC, as well as NMR spectroscopy. Thermal gravimetry analysis was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+ instrument (Mettler-Toledo AG, Analytical, Switzerland) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. PL spectra were measured using a QE Pro High-Performance Spectrometer Ocean Insight fiber spectrometer and a 405 nm diode laser (10 mW) as the excitation source. Charge carrier mobilities were estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and the hole-only ITO/VOx(30 nm)/polymer/VOx(30 nm)/Al(100 nm) device architecture following a procedure described previously.32 The AFM and IR s-SNOM images were obtained using a Neaspec system (Germany) as reported previously.33
Synthesis of polymers P1–P6
Monomers A1 and A2 (0.14 mmol) and one of D1–D8 (0.14 mmol) were introduced into a degassed and argon-filled round-bottom three-necked 50 ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a thermometer. Anhydrous toluene (20 ml), tris(dibenzylidenacetone)dipalladium(0) (7 mg) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (12 mg) were added to the monomers in a flow of argon. The flask was immersed in an oil bath and heated at reflux for 2–3 hours. The molecular weight characteristics of the formed polymer were monitored every 30 min by analytical gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). After the growth of polymer chains was self-terminated or the appropriate molecular weights were reached, 2-(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (0.75 mmol; 0.18 g) and 30 min later bromobenzene (0.9 mmol; 0.14 g) were added to the mixture and the heating at reflux was continued for 2 h. Then the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 50 mL of methanol. The precipitate was filtered and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with acetone, heptane, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Subsequently, the chlorobenzene (P3, P4, P7 and P8) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (P1, P2, P5 and P6) fractions were concentrated to ≈20 ml, treated with 3-mercaptopropionic acid for 3 hours and precipitated again with methanol (≈30 ml). The precipitate was collected by filtration and dried in vacuum. The total yield of the purified polymers P1–P8 was 70–90%.
Organic solar cells
The laser-patterned ITO/glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned by using deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min sequentially, and then dried with a stream of nitrogen and treated by using RF air-plasma for 5 min. The cleaned ITO substrates were coated with an aqueous solution (1:1) of the buffer layer PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) by spin-coating at 3500 rpm, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 165 °C in air for 10 min. A polymer solution (10 mg ml−1) in dichlorobenzene was added to the [60]PCBM or NFA powder and stirred until complete material dissolution. The resulting composite solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and used to coat the films using the doctor blade method (the baseplate temperature was 120 °C). The coated films were annealed at 120 °C (if not specified otherwise) in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes. Aluminium electrodes were evaporated through a shadow mask in a vacuum PVD chamber integrated inside a glove box (at a pressure of 10−6 mbar). Further details on the component ratios, using additives, film deposition and annealing regimes are given in Table S1, ESI.†
Perovskite solar cells
The perovskite solar cells were assembled in an ITO/SnOx/PCBA/perovskite/HTL/VOy/Ag n–i–p configuration following the procedure reported previously.33 To form a hole-transport layer (HTL), polymer solutions were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 s. More details on the polymer solution preparation and film coating conditions are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The solar cell characterization was performed as reported elsewhere.33
Results and discussion
The synthesis of conjugated polymers P1–P8 was accomplished from monomers A1, A2 (ref. 34 and 35) and D1–D8via the Stille polycondensation reaction as shown in Scheme 1. To control the course of the polycondensation reaction, dynamic GPC was used. Purification of the obtained polymers from low molecular weight impurities was carried out by sequential Soxhlet extraction using a set of solvents: heptane, acetone, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The polymer fractions obtained by extraction with chlorobenzene or 1,2-dichlorobenzene were used for the manufacture of solar cells. The relative molecular weight characteristics of polymers P1–P8 are presented in Table 1.

The optical properties of the obtained polymers P1–P8 were studied in solution and in thin films using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1a and b). The absorption bands in the range of 300–500 nm are characteristic of π–π* electronic transitions of conjugated polymers P1–P8. Low-energy absorption features in the range of 500–800 nm are associated with intramolecular charge transfer between donor and acceptor fragments. Polymers P1, P2, P4, P6, and P8 demonstrated shoulders in the long-wavelength absorption bands, which are most probably due to the aggregation of macromolecules in the solution at room temperature.

Considering the absorption spectra of the films of all the obtained polymers, a significant broadening of the bands is observed in comparison with the spectra in solution. Interestingly, if the polymers P1–P8 have quite different optical characteristics in solution, their thin films show very similar spectral features. The low energy onsets of the absorption bands of all P1–P8 polymers are located at 760–820 nm. The Eg values for the P1–P8 polymers were determined using the Tauc plots (Table 1, Fig. 1d). The highest Eg values of 1.67 and 1.69 eV were obtained for polymers P6 and P8 containing fluorinated phenyl and benzothiadiazole units, respectively. The band gap values of other polymers range from 1.61 to 1.64 eV. The maxima in the photoluminescence spectra of P1–P8 thin films lie in the energy range of 1.56–1.62 eV (Fig. 1c), which is close to the band gaps of these materials.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies for all obtained P1–P8 polymers were estimated using cyclic voltammetry for thin films deposited on glassy carbon disc electrodes considering the oxidation wave onset potential and using the standard recalculation approach: EHOMO = −[Eox(onset vs. Fc+/Fc) + 5.1] (eV). The cyclic voltammograms for polymers P1–P8 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The LUMO energies of polymers were calculated using ELUMO = Eg + EHOMO (eV) (Table 1).
Polymer P1 exhibits anomalous behaviour due to its exceptionally strong intermolecular aggregation. In particular, even at low molecular weights (16 kDa), this polymer is absolutely insoluble in toluene and chlorobenzene, and noticeably dissolves in 1,2-dichlorobenzene only upon heating; slightly better solubility is observed in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Despite the low Mw, polymer P1 exhibits a low band gap and an unusually high HOMO energy of −5.41 eV. Apparently, this is a consequence of strong intermolecular interactions leading to effective overlapping of the π-orbitals of neighbouring macromolecules in solid films. Such properties point to the prospects of using polymer P1 as a semiconductor material for field-effect transistors. Indeed, this polymer shows the highest hole mobilities μh among all the studied materials (Table 1). However, the use of P1 as an electron donor component in organic solar cells will be limited by low open-circuit voltages, at least in combination with classical fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors.
It should be noted that almost all the designed polymers demonstrate acceptable charge-transport characteristics. The charge carrier mobilities estimated using the pulsed SCLC (space charge limited current) method vary in the range from 1.1 × 10−4 (P3) to 5.8 × 10−4 (P1) for all polymers except P4 (2.0 × 10−6). Given that all the polymers have been subjected to equally thorough purification, the lower mobility for P4 is unlikely to be attributed to impurities. Most likely, some structural features are limiting the charge transport properties of this material, e.g. a predominant edge-on orientation of the chains on the substrate, which essentially blocks charge transport in a vertical direction.
Thermal properties of polymers P1–P8 were studied using thermal gravimetry (TGA). All the materials showed high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to a 5% mass loss ranging from 348 °C to 449 °C (Fig. S5a–f†).
All synthesized polymers P1–P8 were studied in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells using fullerene ([60]PCBM) and, in some cases, also non-fullerene acceptors (Fig. 2a and b). The standard procedure for optimizing the material performance in devices includes varying the ratios of the donor and acceptor components in thin films, the composite film thickness and the conditions used for their processing, the concentration and type of processing additives, postfabrication device treatment conditions, e.g. solvent vapor annealing, and the use of various acceptor materials. Below, we will briefly discuss the data obtained for each of the studied conjugated polymers while optimizing their performance in organic solar cells.

When optimizing solar cells based on P1, the ratio between the donor and acceptor components in the composite film was systematically varied. As a result, the light conversion efficiency could be increased from 1.13% (non-optimal ratio 1:1) to 2.40% (optimal ratio 1:2). Using processing additives such as chloronaphthalene (CN), diphenyl ether (DPE), 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) had a significant effect on the device performance. Indeed, an efficiency close to 5% was obtained with ODT and DIO. The open-circuit voltage of P1-based solar cells did not exceed 650 mV, which is a consequence of its high HOMO energy (Fig. 2d).
The initial photovoltaic performance of polymer P2 was quite low: the PCE was only 1.1%. Optimization of the D:A ratio slightly increased the device efficiency up to 1.4%, and the use of ODT, the best of the studied additives, further improved the PCE up to 2.4% (Table 2). These results suggested that polymer P2 has a limited potential as electron donor material for organic solar cells.

Polymer P3 delivered an efficiency of about 2.4% without any optimization. Variation of the D:A ratio and the use of diphenyl ether as an additive increased the PCE up to 4.2%. The replacement of [60]PCBM with non-fullerene acceptors did not improve the solar cell parameters: the best efficiency of ∼4.0% was obtained using EH-IDTBR as the acceptor. Similarly, polymer P4 in combination with [60]PCBM showed a PCE of ∼4% in OSCs, whereas the use of other acceptors, including non-fullerene ones, did not allow an increase in the efficiency of the devices. Apparently, the performance of P4 in organic solar cells is limited by its low solubility in organic solvents, which prevents it from achieving an optimal morphology of the photoactive layer. It is worth noting that polymers P2–P4 have linear side chains attached to the benzodithiophene units, which promotes molecular self-assembling in thin films with a predominantly edge-on orientation, which is not favourable for vertical charge transport required for OSC operation.36
In contrast, polymer P5 has branched side chains and fairly high solubility in organic solvents, which result in a significantly higher compatibility with non-fullerene acceptors. In particular, the best results were obtained using ITIC-M and EH-IDTBR, which provided PCEs of about 5.3%. Using EH-IDTBR in combination with P5 provides the highest open circuit voltages combined with high short circuit current densities. Increasing the fill factors by optimizing the morphology of the composites might allow one to further increase the efficiency of solar cells based on these materials.
The study of polymer P6 in organic solar cells was complicated by its extremely low solubility in organic solvents, despite its low molecular weights (Table 1). However, this polymer is clearly promising, since the very first experiments delivered relatively high open-circuit voltages and a decent power conversion efficiency of about 4% in combination with the classical [60]PCBM material. Therefore, the design of conjugated polymers with a structure similar to P6, but with longer solubilizing alkyl chains, could be a promising research direction to ensure proper solubility of the material in organic solvents and, hence, improved photovoltaic performance.
The devices based on P7 also showed low fill factors with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors, with EH-IDTBR being the best. Despite the extensive optimization carried out, the best device efficiency was 3.6% only.
In contrast, the P8 polymer turned out to be one of the most promising materials. Optimization of the composition of the films, their deposition conditions, heating temperature, and the use of processing additives delivered an efficiency of ca. 6.5% in combination with a fullerene acceptor [60]PCBM. The use of non-fullerene acceptors increased the open-circuit voltages, whereas the short-circuit current densities and fill factors decreased, thus resulting in lower efficiencies. The best among the studied NFA acceptors was ITIC-4F, which provided an efficiency of ∼3%.
The most representative data characterizing the performance of P1–P8 in organic solar cells are summarized in Table 1. It is known that the photovoltaic characteristics of composite systems depend very strongly on their morphology. The exciton diffusion length in organic materials rarely exceeds 20 nm; therefore, the size of the domains of individual materials in films must be of the same order for efficient charge generation.37,38 On the other hand, if the donor and acceptor materials are completely mixed, an ideal situation is realized from the point of view of charge photogeneration. However, the lack of percolation pathways for the transport of charge carriers does not allow them to be efficiently delivered to the electrodes of the device. Therefore, optimal nanoscale phase separation with a high degree of domain ordering should be reached for efficient operation of organic solar cells.
Herein, to study the morphology of photoactive composite films, we used not only atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provides basic information about the topography of the film surface, but also the IR s-SNOM technique, which enables mapping of the films at characteristic vibration frequencies in the IR spectra of a donor material (polymer) and acceptor component (fullerene derivative or NFA) to visualize their distribution with a lateral resolution of about 20 nm. The obtained results for composites of P1–P8 with [60]PCBM are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). It can be seen that almost all systems have an optimal morphology with a uniform distribution of nanosized domains of the donor and acceptor components in the films.

Fig. 3 shows the AFM and IR s-SNOM images for the composites of P4 with two different acceptor materials: [60]PCBM and O-IDTBR. Notably, P4/[60]PCBM films demonstrate a very uniform distribution of the donor and acceptor components, which correlates with the relatively high photovoltaic efficiency of this system (Table 2). In contrast, P4 composites with O-IDTBR clearly show a large-scale phase separation, which leads to their inferior performance in devices. Interestingly, P4 tends to form separate domains located in the composite matrix. Therefore, the highest contrast is observed while scanning at the frequency corresponding to the IR absorption of the polymer, since these domains do not contain much of the acceptor material (Fig. 3).

Polymer P5 showed good compatibility with the fullerene derivative [60]PCBM and both non-fullerene acceptors ITIC-M and EH-IDTBR, as evidenced by the high degree of homogeneity of their thin films (Fig. S9, ESI†). The optimal morphology of these composite systems predetermines their efficient operation in photovoltaic cells (Table 2).
Polymers P1–P8, in addition to being used as electron-donor components of organic solar cells (Fig. 2c–f), are promising materials to form the hole-transport layer of perovskite solar cells. To fabricate such devices, a tin oxide electron transport layer was deposited from a colloidal solution atop ITO electrodes and then was passivated by using a thin layer of phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA).39 Next, an absorber layer of methylammonium iodoplumbate (MAPbI3) was grown using the antisolvent quenching method. Afterwards, a hole-transport polymer layer was deposited by spin-coating followed by evaporation of an electron-blocking layer of vanadium oxide atop the Ag electrode (Fig. 4a and b). Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(4′-methylphenyl)amine) (PTA) was used as a reference hole-transport material, which is commonly used in n–i–p perovskite solar cells.

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the fabricated solar cells and their EQE spectra, whereas the device parameters are given in Table 3. Perovskite solar cells using any of the investigated conjugated polymers showed power conversion efficiencies above 10%. The best results were obtained for devices with polymers P5 and P8 delivering PCEs of 17.6–18.8%. Polymer P3 also provided a high efficiency of 17%, which exceeds the performance of reference devices made using PTA as a hole-transport material.

The morphology and uniformity of the polymer films deposited over a perovskite absorber layer were studied using AFM and IR s-SNOM techniques (Fig. 5). Ideally, scanning the film at the polymer IR absorption frequency should give a uniformly high signal intensity, visualized as a red colour on the maps shown in the central column of Fig. 5, thus indicating a complete coverage of the perovskite by the hole-transport material.
 Fig. 5  Topographic images of P1–P8 films deposited atop the perovskite absorber layer (left), and the results of their IR s-SNOM mappings at the characteristic IR absorption frequencies of the conjugated polymer (center) and MAPbI3 perovskite (right). 
At the same time, scanning at the IR frequency of the perovskite material should give an equally low signal intensity over the entire surface of the film. The appearance of an intense signal in these images (Fig. 5, right column) indicates the presence of “islands” of perovskite, uncoated with the polymeric hole-transport material. Obviously, such defects enable a direct contact of MAPbI3 with VOx and the top electrode, which most negatively affects the efficiency and stability of the fabricated perovskite solar cells.
The data presented in Fig. 5 indicate a high degree of uniformity (a single defect is observed) of coatings formed by polymers P2, P4, P5, P7 and P8. These polymers incorporate alkyl (P5, P7 and P8), alkoxy (P2) and (P4) thioalkyl substituents attached to the benzodithiophene core, and enable high efficiencies and fill factors of perovskite solar cells (Table 3). For polymer P5, a strong influence of the material concentration, varied between 5 and 10 mg mL−1, on the morphology and uniformity of thin films is observed. The most uniform film was obtained while using 10 mg mL−1 solution of P5 (Fig. S10†), whereas a further increase in the concentration is not possible due to the solubility limit of this material.
Conclusion
In this work, we have synthesized and systematically investigated a series of new push–pull electron donor (BDT-TTBTBTT)n polymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) blocks and alternating thiophene (T) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (B) units. The obtained polymers were investigated as electron donor components in organic solar cells and materials to form hole-transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Systematic variation of the substituents in the polymer backbone allowed us to find some important correlations between the structure of P1–P8 polymers and their photovoltaic performance in OSCs. In particular, polymers incorporating fluorine atoms in the BDT moiety (P1 and P6) deliver improved Voc values as compared to the fluorine-free polymers. The attachment of branched alkylthiophene or thioalkylthiophene units to the BDT fragment results in improved miscibility of polymers with [60]PCBM, and, consequently, in optimal composite film morphology and improved fill factors. Thus, P1 and P3–P8 demonstrated promising characteristics in OSCs using [60]PCBM as an acceptor (6.5%), whereas using non-fullerene acceptors delivered PCEs up to 5.3%.
The perovskite solar cells using P1–P8 as hole-transport materials delivered much higher efficiencies than OSCs approaching 17–19%. In particular, polymers P1, P3, P5, P7, and P8 enabled improved the Voc and FF in PSCs as compared to the reference cells with PTA as the hole-transport material. Using the IR s-SNOM technique, we found that the high degree of homogeneity and uniformity of polymer films grown above the perovskite absorber layer correlates with the best device performance. We strongly believe that the revealed correlations between the structure of the studied materials and their photovoltaic performance may be very useful in the design of new high-performance conjugated polymers for OSCs and PSCs.
