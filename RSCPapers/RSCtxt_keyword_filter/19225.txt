An overview of the recent advances in the photophysical properties of MNCs is presented in this review. To begin with, we illustrate general synthesis methodologies of MNCs using direct reduction, chemical etching, ligand exchange, metal exchange and intercluster reaction. Due to strong quantum confinement, the NCs possess unique electronic properties such as discrete optical absorption, intense photoluminescence (PL), molecular-like electron dynamics and non-linear optical behavior. Discussions have also been carried out to unveil the influence of the core size, nature of ligands, heteroatom doping, and surrounding environments on the optical absorption and photophysical properties of metal clusters. Recent findings reveal that the excited-state dynamics, nonlinear optical properties and aggregation induced emission of metal clusters offer exciting opportunities for potential applications. We discuss briefly about their versatile applications in optoelectronics, sensing, catalysis and bio-imaging.

1. Introduction
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a new class of functional materials because of their unique photophysical properties which differ from those of metal nanoparticles.1–7 Metal clusters consist of a few to several hundreds of metal atoms with a diameter of <2 nm and they are in between the atomic regime and plasmonic metal nanoparticles (MNPs).1,6,8 As the size approaches the Fermi wavelength of metals (<1 nm), the quantum size effect originates in the NCs which culminates molecular like behavior such as discrete HOMO–LUMO gaps, intense luminescence, unusual redox behavior, chirality, and intrinsic magnetism.1,9–14 In MNCs, the free electrons of metal atoms do not collectively oscillate in the presence of an electric field like metal nanoparticles.8,15 They exhibit distinct step-like absorption bands and intense photoluminescence (PL) due to quantized energy levels.8,9,16 Thus, a fundamental understanding of the origin of the photophysical properties of metal clusters is an important topic of research.10,17–19 Due to superior resistance towards oxidation, gold has become the centre of attention in the synthesis of nanoscale particles.20–22 In 1857, Michael Faraday synthesized a ruby red colored gold colloid via reduction of a gold salt with white phosphorus in a biphasic system.23 Mie solved Maxwell's equation to understand the interaction of light with a single gold NP and developed the electronic band theory of metals in 1960 for understanding the nature of electronic transitions in gold and other MNPs.24,25 The monodispersity of particles is an important concern in nanoscience and eventually controls the photophysical properties. Brust et al. have reported the synthesis of thiol protected gold nanoparticles in a two phase synthesis which is a seminal work in nanoscience.22,26 This synthesis includes the phase transfer of the gold(III) salt by the reduction of Au(III) to Au(I) and then further reduction of Au(I) to Au(0) is caused by NaBH4 to form Aun(SR)m where tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr) is used as a phase transfer agent.22,26 The extremely stable thiolate protected NPs can be stored for a long time in powder form that can be re-dissolved in a solvent.22,27 Generally, NPs are synthesized using thiol ligands such as long chain alkylthiols,27 arenethiols,28 and ω-substituted alkylthiols.29 Whetten and coworkers have reported sub-2 nm-sized Au NPs with a thiol:Au ratio of 3:1 and their synthesis method is now a universal method for thiolated Au NC synthesis.30 Magic sized Au NCs such as Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, Au102(SR)44, and Au144(SR)60 NCs have been reported with their thermodynamic stability.31–35 Later on, peptides, proteins, DNAs, amino acids and small water soluble ligands have been employed as capping ligands in aqueous phase synthesis of NCs.11,21,36–40 Despite the lowered stability in the reduced state, adequate attention has been given to synthesize monodisperse Ag and Cu NCs owing to their higher abundance and better cost effectiveness.41,42 The photophysics of the particles becomes distinct with the diameter approaching 2 nm, inducing magnificent optical behavior such as intense PL, discrete electronic transitions, molecular-like relaxation of the excited state and two photon absorption and fluorescence in MNCs.16,43,44
The atomically precise composition of MNCs enables the investigation on the structure–property relationship upon light irradiation. Among the other optical properties, PL is most important which empowers the NCs as a potential candidate for optoelectronic,45,46 photocatalytic,47,48 bio-labeling7,49 and sensing18,50–52 applications. Traditional luminescent materials such as semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots, organic fluorophores, and perovskite nanocrystals often have solubility and toxicity issues.3,53 In contrast, atomically precise NCs provide superior bio-compatibility, diverse solubility and good photostability.1,2 The tunable PL of metal clusters all over the visible and NIR region by controlling the core size and the nature of ligands has been reported.10,16,18,54 The PL mechanism is found to be controlled by metal–ligand interface chemistry.12,55 The applications of the structurally precise NCs are restricted because of their low QYs.3 Remarkable emphasis has been placed on controlling the photoemission of NCs and improving the QYs through selective control over the protecting ligand,56–58 heteroatom doping,59–61 temperature,62,63 solvent64,65 and pH.66 Now-a-days, aggregation induced emission (AIE) is an emerging method to enhance the PL emission.46,64,67,68 The fundamental understanding of excited state carrier dynamics of MNCs is very important for practical applications. Recently, several spectroscopic techniques have been used to understand the sharp transition from the metallic state of NPs to the excitonic state of NCs, the molecular-like internal conversion (IC), intersystem crossing (ISC), fluorescence and phosphorescence.17,69–71
The present review focuses on the photophysical behavior of atomically precise MNCs (M = Au, Ag and Cu). Firstly, we describe different synthetic methods such as direct reduction, chemical etching, ligand exchange, metal exchange and intercluster reaction for metal cluster synthesis. The basic understanding of photoinduced phenomena in NCs such as optical absorption, PL, ultrafast excited state relaxation dynamics and non-linear optical properties is discussed. The governing factors such as the core size, capping ligand, heterometal atom, temperature, pH and aggregation or self-assembly of NCs for the photophysical properties of metal clusters will be addressed. Finally, the optoelectronics, sensing, catalysis and biological applications of NCs are highlighted. We may have missed out some excellent studies from the finest scientists due to our limited knowledge. In a nutshell, the structurally correlated optical behavior and optical property based applications of atomically precise Au, Ag and Cu NCs are highlighted (Fig. 1).

2. Synthesis of metal nanoclusters
Mono-dispersity is the main concern in research on NCs as they are often considered as ‘nanomolecules’ having distinct molecular properties. Several synthetic methodologies have been developed to obtain a well-defined composition of NCs with rational tuning of chemical and physical parameters. Advanced characterization methods such as laser desorption ionization (LDI),30 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI),11,34,72 electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS),20,21,34 X-ray crystallography9,73 and post-synthetic separation techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC)74 and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)21,75 are being used for determining the composition and structures of the clusters. Using the LDI-MS technique, Schaaff and coworkers have characterized a series of clusters with core masses of 29–28k (1.7 nm, ∼146 atoms), 23–22k (1.5 nm, ∼101 atoms), 15–14k (1.3 nm, ∼75 atoms) and 8k (1.1 nm, ∼38 atoms) where k is 1000 atomic mass unit (amu).30 It is noted that the 8k species exhibited a distinct step-like absorption feature due to a strong quantum effect. Other methods such as softer ionization based electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry are being used to characterize the metal clusters. A hydrophilic tripeptide glutathione (GSH) was used to synthesize Au NCs in aqueous medium where the sterically hindered GSH controls the size of NCs.76 Tsukuda and coworkers have characterized a series of GSH and homoglutathione (h-GSH) protected Aun clusters (n = 10–39) using ESI MS and PAGE (Fig. 2).21 It is evident from PAGE that GSH protected NCs are better separated than h-GSH capped Au NCs (Fig. 2A). The nine different bands (1–9) in PAGE were identified using ESI-MS along with their corresponding isotopic distribution (Fig. 2B). The crude product contains a number of magic sized NCs ranging from Au10(SG)10 to Au39(SG)24. The number of GS-ligands vs. Au atoms is plotted in Fig. 2C and the stability of each NC is dependent on the valence electron count and electron shell closely associated with the specific composition. The fractionated clusters are found to be molecular in nature and exhibit size dependent optical characteristics. Major emphasis has been placed on thiolate protected Au NC synthesis and other Ag, Cu clusters etc. We will shed some light upon the synthesis of size specific NCs via different methodologies.

2.1. Direct reduction
The direct reduction method has been successfully employed to obtain Au, Ag, Cu and alloy NCs in both organic and aqueous media. The synthetic process includes rapid reductive growth of intermediate NCs and slow size focusing to monodisperse NCs in a NaBH4 reduction.77 With the advancement of characterization tools such as ESI-MS, MALDI-MS and X-ray crystallography, the atom by atom customization was made possible by careful modulation of each reaction parameter.78 Jin et al. have controlled the kinetics of the reduction reaction which led to the exclusive formation of phenylethanethiol (PET) capped Au25 through a two-step process. First Au(III) is reduced to Au(I) by thiols to form Au(I):SG intermediates and further reduction with NaBH4 turns Au(I) to Au(0) (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of Au(I):SG intermediate formation is critical towards monodispersity and controlled by maintaining very low temperature (0 °C).31 As an indispensible part of a NC, the protecting ligand exerts a massive impact toward dictating the atomic precision.79 In a one pot system, Au144(SR)60 NCs with different thiol ligands were obtained by subtle tuning of the Au to thiol ratio (≥4), the solvent (methanol), and the presence of O2 and tetraoctylammonium halide.35 The NC synthesis via direct reduction is very sensitive towards pH,80,81 the reducing agent,81,82 temperature,83 and the metal to thiol ratio.82 Instead of NaBH4, other reducing agents such as hydrazine hydrate,81 CO80,82 and ascorbic acid84 have been employed in bottom up NC synthesis. Water soluble Au25 with cysteine as a capping ligand is obtained using CO as a reducing agent.82 The reaction proceeds through the reduction of thiolate–Au(I) complexes to Au10–15 NCs, the growth of NCs from Au10–15 to Au16–25 NCs and the size-focusing of Au16–25 NCs to Au25 NCs. Recently, Chen et al. have rationalized the use of stoichiometric NaBH4 to obtain Au25(SG)18 NCs and predicted the balanced equation as follows: 32/x [Au(SR)]x + 8e− = [Au25(SR)18]− + 7 [Au(SR)2]− (SR = thiolate ligand). Only 8 electrons (supplied by the reducing agent) are sufficient to react with 32 Au atoms to form pure Au25(SR)18− NCs.85 Moreover, in a mild and well controlled reduction reaction, the synthesis of NCs with different nuclearity is monitored by pH. Tuning of NCs, Au10–12, Au15, Au18 and Au25 NCs was achieved by changing the reaction pH to 7, 9, 10 and 11, respectively.80 Xie and coworkers have investigated the role of NaOH in achieving monodispersity in the synthesis of mono-, bi- and tri-thiolate protected Au25 NCs.40 Temperature has a profound effect in deciding the composition of NCs in the direct synthesis process. In a typical synthesis of Au25(MHA)18 NCs (MHA = mercaptohexanoic acid), 40 °C is found to be optimum to achieve monodispersity, whereas the temperature more than 40 °C leads to mixed sized NCs.83 Xie and coworkers first reported bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein template magic sized Au25 NCs in a single step.11 BSA acts as both a protecting ligand and a reducing agent as tyrosine in BSA reduces Au(III) in basic pH (>10) and cysteine binds to Au atoms via the –SH group. The same group later developed a scalable synthesis of GSH protected Ag, Cu and Pt NCs through a phase transfer cycle (aqueous to organic to aqueous). The growth of NCs is controlled by the mild etching ability of the phase transfer agent. The as-prepared luminescent NCs in organic medium are again transferred to aqueous medium (Fig. 3B).86

Silver NCs, [Ag25(SR)18]−, analogous to magic sized [Au25(SR)18]−, are successfully synthesized in organic medium.87 Mercaptobenzoic acid was employed to synthesize luminescent Cu NCs and the position of –COOH dictates the composition and characteristics of NCs.56 In a one pot method, Ag and Cu NCs with a variety of ligands such as thiolates, DNAs, peptides, proteins and polymers have been synthesized.41,42 The redox potential difference in different metal ions allows us to control the composition of alloy NCs with rational tuning of metal–thiolate bonding and the reducing environment.88,89 Co-reduction of two or more metal salts in single medium leads to alloy NCs (AuAg, AuCu, AgCu etc.) with a variety of capping ligands.61,88,90–92 Medintz and coworkers synthesized a series of alloy AuAg NCs with different Au:Ag molar ratios.93 Besides the enhancement in PL, the average diameter increases from 1.5 nm to 1.6 nm upon 2% Ag doping (Fig. 4A and B). In most cases, the simultaneous reduction of metal ions results in a series of alloy NCs instead of a particular NC.88,94 In the alloying of Au25 NCs, maximum 9 Ag atoms and 5 Cu atoms were incorporated by varying the Au3+/Ag+ and Au3+/Cu2+ concentration ratios.88,94

Recent success in synthetic chemistry has yielded a number of precisely doped NCs such as [Au3Ag38(SCH2Ph)24X5]2− (X = Cl or Br),95 Au4Ag13(DPPM)3(SR)9 (DPPM = bis(diphenylphosphino) methane and HSR = 2,5-dimethylbenzenethiol),90 Au24Ag20(2-SPy)4(PhCC)20Cl2 (2-HSPy = 2-pyridylthiolate),91 [Ag28Cu12(SR)24]4− where (HSR = 2,4-dichlorobenzenethiol),92 and [AuAg28(DHLA)12]3− NCs.61 Due to the limited scope, we are not able to discuss all the NCs synthesized by this method. The mechanism, reaction control parameters and the role of capping ligands have been elaborately discussed in several review articles.41,42,79
2.2. Chemical etching
Though ‘one pot’ size focusing has emerged rapidly to achieve monodisperse MNCs, the complementary chemical etching is not far behind. Etching of NPs is presumably a process involving the removal of metal atoms from the outermost layer of an NP or NC core.96 The atomic structure and the electronic behavior experience a drastic change when the size of NPs is reduced to the sub-2 nm regime. In 2007, a ligand induced core size reduction i.e. core etching of gold nanocrystals to obtain a coordinating multivalent polymer was documented, PEI protected Au8 NCs with blue luminescence.19 Gold atoms from larger NCs can be removed sequentially to populate stable Aun NCs with lower nuclearity. The process is thermodynamically favorable as a series of polydisperse particles are converted to magic sized NCs. Excess ligand directed etching of a series of GSH protected Aun(SG)m clusters where [n, m] = [10, 10], [15, 13], [18, 14], [22, 16], [25, 18], [29, 20] and [33, 22] yielded Au25(SG)18 with n > 25 under aerobic conditions. The clusters with n < 25 are decomposed to Au(I)–SG complexes, whereas Au25(SG)18 remains unaffected due to its extraordinary stability.97 pH dependent etching of mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) protected Au NPs with GSH yields two different NCs, Au8 at pH 7–8 and Au25 at pH 3.98 Citrate capped charge-stabilized silver NPs are converted to red luminescent Ag NCs owing to the higher binding affinity of the thiol with Ag.99 Not only spherical nanoparticles but also the nanorods can be chopped down chemically with an excess ligand to sub-2 nm NCs.100 Au8 was synthesized from Au NPs and NRs with biomolecule (amino acid, protein, peptide and DNA) assisted etching.
Tsukuda and coworkers reported a synthesis of 8 kDa [Au38(SCn)24]z and 29 kDa [Au144(SCn)60]z (where z = charge states) through alkanethiol induced core etching.20 The Jin group reported a bulk scale preparative method of Au38(PET)24 NCs in a two phase ligand exchange cum core etching of Au:SG clusters.32 The yield was improved up to ∼25% by employing acetone as the solvent which regulates the complexation of Au with thiol (Fig. 5A). Polydispersed Aun (n = 38–102) protected with GSH was used as a precursor for phenylethanethiol directed core etching in toluene at 80 °C which yielded a truly monodisperse Au38(PET)24 as is evident from MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 5B).33 Au130(PET)50 NCs are found to be present during the synthesis of Au144(PET)60 clusters which is evident from the mass spectrometric study. Dass et al. have reported the synthesis of atomically pure Au130(SR)50 NCs from polydisperse Au NCs in excess ligand induced etching. The scalable synthesis also enables furnishing alloy Au130−xMx(SR)50 (M = Ag, Pd and R = –CH2CH2Ph, –C6H13 and –C12H25) NCs.101 The functional groups and their positions in the ligand are found to control the nuclearity in NCs. Using the core etching reaction with an excess ligand, a mixed sized product of Aun(MBT)m (MBT = methylbenzenethiol) was converted to highly monodisperse Au NCs (Fig. 5C). Depending on the position of –CH3 in the benzene ring, the magic sized NCs vary from Au130(p-MBT)50 to Au104(m-MBT)41 to Au40(o-MBT)24. The subtle change in the –CH3 position has a strong influence on the synthesis of the magic sized NCs due to a steric effect.72 GSH capped mixed sized Au NCs underwent a long time size reduction and yielded stable NCs in the presence of a small thiol ligand, mercaptopropionic acid.18 The number of Au atoms in NCs reduced from 15 to 12 to 6 with the progress of the ligand exchange cum core etching reaction. The size evolution is evident from TEM images as the average diameter of the NCs is decreased from 1.9 nm to 1.7 nm to 1.4 nm (Fig. 6A). A process of cyclic reduction–decomposition–reduction gave rise to Ag:SG intermediates which were converted to red and green emitting Ag NCs.102 The red (700, 720 nm), yellow (570 nm) and blue (450 nm) emitting silver NCs are synthesized by mono- or biphasic etching.36,103

Wang et al. have successfully synthesized GSH protected Cu NCs through a size focusing process.104 Recently, ammonia was utilized to etch Cu NPs to form green emitting Cu NCs.105 The Patra group has recently reported a digestive ripening process for the synthesis of a polydisperse mixture of Cu NCs using excess GSH. Weak red emission of Cu34–32(SG)16–13 NCs is obtained with room temperature reaction, whereas intense blue emission of monodisperse Cu25(SG)20 NCs is obtained at higher temperature.64 A core etching cum metal exchange reaction on Ag NPs with MSA and gold salts yielded alloy AgAu NCs capped with MSA (Fig. 6B). The core diameter of Ag NPs ranging between 3 and 60 nm was reduced to 1.8 nm of Ag NCs and further reduction occurred in the diameter to 1.5 nm after exchange with Au atoms (Fig. 6C).106 Thus, core etching does not require control over reduction assisted nucleation for synthesizing nanoclusters from larger polydisperse NPs.
2.3. Ligand exchange
Ligand exchange of a pre-synthesized NC has become a powerful method to modulate the structure and properties of NCs because the protecting ligands have a significant influence on the nuclearity, geometry, bonding and electronic transitions. Binding of the new incoming ligand can have an influence on the core size, geometry, solubility, and PL behavior because of the modification of the electronic interactions. Chiral Au38(PET)24 NCs undergo complete ligand exchange with 4-tert-butylbenzenethiol (TBBT) at 80 °C for more than 12 hours to form an entirely different FCC structured, achiral Au36(TBBT)24 NC.107 Later, Jin and coworkers proposed a mechanism for the ligand exchange reaction.108
Rod like Au38(PET)24 becomes structurally distorted and releases two Au atoms when bulkier TBBT approaches the cluster. In a dis-proportionation reaction, Au38(PET)24 NCs are converted to tetrahedral Au36(PET)24 and Au40(SR)24 (SR includes both PET and TBBT here) NCs (Fig. 7A). Au40(SR)24 NCs are transformed into extremely stable Au36(TBBT)24 in the presence of TBBT.108 Ligand exchange generally yields low nuclearity NCs with a fully reorganized surface environment. For example, Au20(TBBT)16 from Au25(PET)18− and Au133(TBBT)52 from Au144(PET)60 NCs were synthesized in the ligand exchange cum core conversion reaction with the TBBT ligand under different reaction conditions.109,110 On the other hand, the nuclearity of NCs increases when phosphine protected Au11 NCs undergo ligand exchange with GSH to form thermodynamically stable Au25(SG)18 NCs in aqueous medium.111 The increase in the core size is evident from the attainment of Au28(TBBT)20 from Au25(PET)18(TOA) and Au24(TBBT)20 from Au23(SC6H11)16(TOA) NCs.13,112 Several groups have used the ligand exchange assisted size focusing strategy to obtain a stable one sized NC from a mixture of NCs with a delicate control over the reaction kinetics.113,114 Thermo-chemical treatment of polydisperse Aun(SG)m NCs with excess PET and TBBT yields stable Au38(PET)24, Au36(TBBT)24 and Au30(TBBT)18 NCs.114 Single [Ag59(2,5-DCBT)32]3− NC (2,5-DCBT = 2,5-dichlorobenzenethiol) leads to three different Ag NCs as Ag44, Ag29, and Ag25 NCs upon exchange reaction with diverse thiol ligands.115 The hollow structure of [Ag44(4-FTP)30]4− (FTP = 4-fluorothiophenol) is converted to a non-hollow [Ag25(2,4-DMBT)18]−via a disproportionation mechanism. The reverse reaction between [Ag25(2,4-DMBT)18]− and 4-FTP results in [Ag44(4-FTP)30]4− by dimerization followed by a rearrangement reaction.116 The versatility of the ligand exchange strategy made it possible to synthesize bimetallic NCs through the selective replacement of –S–M–S- motifs.117,118 The surface motif exchange (SME) in the [Ag44(SR)30]4− cluster results in well-defined core–shell [Ag32@Au12(SR)30]4− NCs.118 Pre-synthesized Pt1Ag24(DMBT)18 undergoes SME with adamentanethiol (HS-Adm) and PPh3 to form Pt1Ag28(S-Adm)18(PPh3)4 having a Ag4(SR)6(PPh3)1 surface motif encoated with the FCC kernel of Pt1Ag12.119 Ligand exchange may turn out to be an alternative, where the direct reduction fails to yield single sized doped NCs. For example, [PtAg28(BDT)12(TPP)4]4− (BDT = benzenedithiol and TPP = triphenylphosphine) is obtained from a ligand exchange reaction with Pt2Ag23Cl7(TPP)10 and BDTH2, whereas the direct bottom up synthesis method results in a mixture of [Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4]3− and [PtAg28(BDT)12(TPP)4]4− NCs (Fig. 7B).120 The formation of single sized doped NCs was confirmed by ESI-MS (Fig. 7C). The GSH exchange reaction on the surface of N-acetylcysteine capped Au NCs is assisted by foreign silver atoms.121 Zhu et al. have developed an ‘in situ ligand exchange’ strategy to obtain Au20Ag1(TBBT)15, Au21−xAgx(TBBT)15 (x = 4–8), Au21−xCux(TBBT)15 (x = 0, 1), and Au21−xCux(TBBT)15 (x = 2–5) in a very short time which paves the way for reducing the time of the ligand exchange reaction.122 In spite of being a time consuming process, the ligand exchange methodology is found to be an efficient method to synthesize monodisperse homo- and heterometallic NCs.

2.4. Metal exchange
Metal exchange in a pre-synthesized NC or NP results in monodisperse doped NCs or a series of alloy NCs with different numbers of heteroatom doping. The number of dopant atoms, doping sites and the distribution in NCs are the key factors that control their luminescence, stability and catalytic activity.123 Metal exchange in atomically precise NCs is employed to obtain a number of structurally versatile alloy NCs.124 The galvanic replacement method based on the electrochemical potential difference of metals is a classical method of metal exchange. In this exchange process, M1 becomes oxidized with simultaneous reduction of M2 if M1 has a lower reduction potential than M2. Being reduced, M2 is accumulated on the surface of the M1 core resulting in an alloy NC.124 The process is schematically represented in Fig. 8A. Crown like Pd147 acts as a template in a galvanic exchange reaction where Au atoms are decorated in the corners of the crown forming a crown-jewel like structure (Fig. 8B) The controlled replacement of Pd with Au atoms in the crown-like Pd NCs is made possible due to the reduction potential difference of AuCl4−/Au (0.99 V) and Pd2+/Pd (0.95 V) and the surface energy difference of Pd atoms in the top, edge and face positions of the crown.125 Pradeep's group has demonstrated the formation of 13 atom AuAg alloy NCs in a galvanic exchange of Ag7,8 NCs with Au–SR complexes.126 Though the deciding factors for the composition are still not very clear, a number of alloy clusters protected with proteins,127 peptides128 and thiols106 have been synthesized through the redox reaction assisted exchange process.

The classical rule of oxidation–reduction based on the reduction potential fails below the 2 nm size regime owing to the strong quantum confinement effect. Then metal exchange does not comply with the metal activity sequence (i.e. Fe > Cd > Co > Ni > Pb > Cu > Hg > Ag > Pd > Pt > Au) and instead the exchange reactions in NCs are related to the structural stability and electron shell closing (Fig. 8A).129 In an early study, Negishi et al. have reported Pd doping in stable dodecanethiol (DT) protected Au25 to form Pd1Au24(DT)18 with higher stability.130 A succeeding report revealed two Pd atom doping in Au38(PET)24 to form Pd2Au36(PET)24 NCs.131 The more reactive Pd doped in thermodynamically stable Au25 and Au38 NCs goes through antigalvanic exchange. Antigalvanic exchange is a process of more reactive metal atom doping in NCs and is as effective as galvanic exchange to tailor the structure of doped NCs.123,132 In a typical experiment, a set of metal atoms (Cu, Ag, Cd, Hg etc.) with higher reactivity than Au was incorporated into Au25(SR)18− maintaining the core size of NCs.133 The MALDI mass spectra of the NCs after metal exchange in Au25 NCs reveal different metal atom incorporation for Ag, Cu, Cd and Hg, depending on the electron count and structural stability of doped NCs (Fig. 8C). Anti-galvanic replacement of Ag atoms in DNA template Ag NCs with Cu leads to an enhancement in luminescence.134 In both top down and bottom up approaches, AuAg alloy NCs with tunable emission were synthesized via an antigalvanic reaction between the AuNP and Ag+ or Au3+ and AgNP assisted by mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA).60 Trimetallic NCs were synthesized from bimetallic NCs by metal exchange.135–137 Zhu et al. have synthesized Pt2Au10Ag13(PPh3)10Br7 and Pt1Au6.4Ag17.6(SR)18 trimetallic NCs from bimetallic Pt1(Au)24(SR)18 NCs.137 In a recent account, the mechanism of exchange was studied by incorporating Ag and a Ag–thiol complex in Au25(PET)18 NCs. It revealed that all the surface metal atoms are not exchangeable.138 The metal exchange reaction enabled the achievement of atomically pure doped NCs with diverse novel properties.
2.5. Intercluster reaction
Since the behavior of nanoclusters is well established to be like that of a molecule, they may undergo reaction by breaking and making chemical bonds. This possibility was first explored by Pradeep's group with the reaction of very stable [Au25(PET)18]− and [Ag44(FTP)30]4− NCs (where, FTP = 4-fluorothiophenol).139 The structural purity of Au25(PET)18 was confirmed from the multiple absorption peaks at 397, 445, 552, 683 and 796 nm and a single molecular ion peak at m/z = 7391 upon negative mode ESI-MS (Fig. 9A). Apart from step-like absorption and a well-defined crystal structure, the ESI mass spectrum of the parent Ag44(FTP)30 NC displays a triply negative peak centered around m/z 2853 which completely matches with the isotopic distribution of [Ag44(FTP)30]3− (Fig. 9B). The absorption spectral feature and the crystal structure are completely changed upon mixing the two stable NCs (Fig. 9C). The mass spectrum of the product suggests the formation of [Au25−xAgx(PET)18−y(FTP)y]− NCs. Reactions at different molar ratios of two NCs yield diverse alloy NCs involving metal, ligand and metal–ligand fragment exchange.140 The number of incorporated Ag atoms into Au25(PET)18 NCs varies from 1–5, 2–7 and 8–13 when the molar ratios of Au25:Ag44 are 14:1, 7:1 and 1.7:1, respectively (Fig. 9D–F). The ESI mass spectra of alloy Au25−xAgx(PET)18−y(FTP)y NCs with isotopic distribution unambiguously confirm the composition of clusters where x and y are indicated in parentheses as (x, y). The method is more effective than adding metal salts during the synthesis of alloy NCs with conservation of the molecular formula.

Au25(PET)18 and Ag25(DMBT)18 NCs react with each other to form a dianionic intermediate [Ag25Au25(DMBT)18(PET)18]2− which is converted to bimetallic alloy NCs with time. A mass separation between consecutive peaks (m/z = 89) indicates the exchange of Au with Ag atoms resulting in an entire series of [AgmAun(SR)18] (n = 1–24; m + n = 25) NCs with a conserved structure.141 The reaction between two closed shell NCs with the same ligand, [Au25(FTP)18]− and [Ag44(FTP)30]4−, results in another closed shell [Au12Ag32(SR)30]4− alloy NCs with the structure, charge state and electronic configuration preserved. Incorporation of more than 12 Au atoms gives rise to a change in the charge state to 3− and 2− of alloy NCs.142 The previously existing literature reports mostly describe a series of alloy NCs with increasing number of incoming metal atoms, whereas precisely doped Au22Ir3(PET)18 was synthesized exclusively from the reaction of Au25(PET)18 and Ir9(PET)6 NCs.143 As the reaction goes through metal–ligand fragment exchange processes, the flexibility of the ligand is pivotal in dictating the product. By introducing bidentate benzenedithiol it was ensured that no ligand exchange took place. Instead, only metal exchange took place in the reaction of Ag29(BDT)12 and Au25(BuS)18 NCs leading to alloy NCs.144 The reaction of 1.4 nm copper NPs with Au25(capt)18 NCs resulting in CuAu alloy NCs reveals that MNPs can also take part in the interparticle reaction.145 In future, the interparticle reaction between atomically precise NCs will lead the path towards alloy NCs with the advancement of mechanistic studies.
3. Photophysical properties of nanoclusters
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the most prominent feature in UV-Vis absorption spectra in noble metal nanoparticles.15 The free electron model explains the electronic behavior of gold, silver and copper NPs quite well.8 Owing to the collective oscillation of free electrons in such a large number of metal atoms, SPR arises in nanoparticles. In contrast, when the size of NPs approaches the Fermi wavelength of the metal, the collective oscillation of free electrons reduces dramatically. The continuous band structure splits into discrete energy states and the free electrons are confined into those states. For small particles, where the number of particles is finite, the spacing of electronic levels becomes reasonable and inversely related to the size of the particle.8,146 MNCs comprise a class of tiny NPs which are a collection of a few metal atoms protected with a monolayer of a capping ligand. The unusual and molecular like photophysical behavior is our focus and will be discussed in the view of optical absorption, PL, ultrafast carrier dynamics of excited state and non-linear optical properties (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Schematic diagram of the major optical properties of NCs and the controlling factors of PL. 
3.1. Optical absorption
The correlation of the structure and optical properties in MNCs has emerged as a contemporary research topic in nanoparticle chemistry. The optical response of MNPs is dominated by the collective oscillation of free electrons which gives rise to an SPR band.8 On the other hand, the size reduction in NCs results in single electron transitions within the discrete energy levels which in turn display step like absorption spectra in NCs. Being an indispensible part of the NCs, each and every metal atom contributes towards the optical response. Atomically pure Au144(PET)60 NCs display absorption bands at 517 nm and 700 nm, whereas the size reduction to Au25(PET)18 NCs gives rise to different absorption bands altogether.35 The Au25(PET)18 NCs show distinct absorption bands at 400, 450 and 670 nm. The spacing between the discrete energy levels increases as the size of the particles decreases causing a blue shift in the absorption band.8 The size and optical absorption relationship is followed in a series of pepsin templated Au NCs.38 The core size reduction of Au NCs during the etching reaction results in the shifting of absorption bands from 410 nm to 386 nm.18 As the surface protecting ligands largely contribute towards the electronic structure of NCs, there is no linear relationship between the size and optical band gap.147 The nature of optical transitions in MNCs remained elusive until the crystal structures were reported. In 2008, the crystal structure of [Au25(SR)18] with anionic charge and with TOA+ counter-ions has been reported and a stable optimized structure was obtained from density functional theory (DFT).9,73,148 Zhu et al. reported the crystal structure of [Au25(SR)18][TOA] and time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations correlated the optical absorption peaks with electronic transitions (Fig. 11).9 The X-ray crystallographic study revealed that the Au25 NC is composed of a centered icosahedral Au13 core capped with an exterior shell of 12 Au atoms and 18 thiolate ligands. All thiolates are attached to the Au atoms via bridging binding mode instead of terminal binding mode. Each of the six Au–Au pairs is bridged by an –SR ligand and the remaining two –SR ligands are attached to exterior Au and the icosahedral core (Fig. 11A). The NCs show well-defined bands at 1.8, 2.75 and 3.1 eV in the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 11B).

TD-DFT calculations considering [Au25(SH)18]− as a model system suggest that the HOMO levels are triply degenerate, whereas the LUMO levels are doubly degenerate. The HOMO and the lowest three LUMOs are mainly contributed by 6sp atomic orbitals (AO) of Au and they constitute the sp band (Fig. 11C). HOMO−5 to HOMO−1 levels are composed of 5d AOs of Au; hence they constitute the d band together. In the theoretical absorption spectrum, the first peak at 1.52 eV (a) corresponds to the intraband sp–sp transition, whereas the peak at 2.63 eV (b) is from mixed intraband (sp–sp) and interband (d–sp) transitions. 2.91 eV (c) arises from the d–sp transition (Fig. 11B). As the HOMO, LUMO and other orbitals including HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 are composed of AOs of Au from the icosahedral Au13 core, the peak at 1.52 eV is due to electronic transitions from the Au13 core. The calculated peaks lie in the red region of the experimental absorption peaks (Fig. 11D). The electron donation from CH2CH2Ph causes more negative orbital energies leading to an increase in the HOMO–LUMO gap and blue shifting of absorption peaks. Anionic [Au25(SR)18]− is highly stable due to its structural robustness and the eight electron shell of delocalized Au (6s) electrons.9 Taking into account the spin–orbit coupling, the twin peaks at 1.67 eV and 1.90 eV in the absorption spectrum of Au25 can be explained as the triply degenerate HOMO orbitals split with a 0.2 eV energy difference.149 The HOMO–LUMO positions of [Au25(SCH2CH2PhX)18]− NCs were tuned by varying the substituent (X = H, F, Cl, Br, CH3, OCH3) in the para position of the aromatic ring of PET.150 The electronic absorption of Au25(SR)18 and Au38(SR)24 NCs was found to be dependent on temperature due to different electron–phonon and exciton–phonon interactions.151 The investigation revealed the appearance of vibronic feature, sharpening of peaks, shifting to higher energies and an increase in oscillator strength with the lowering in temperature.151
From X-ray crystallographic study, the structure of [Au23(SR)16]− NCs is found to be made of a cuboctahedron-based Au15 kernel, two trimeric Au3(SR)4 staple motifs on the top and bottom and two Au(SR)2 staples on the front and back (Fig. 12A).152 DFT calculations with a model [Au23(SCH3)16]− NC predict the absorption band at 530 nm which reasonably agrees with the experimental absorption peak at 570 nm (Fig. 12B and C). The peak originates from both the HOMO to LUMO and HOMO to LUMO+1 electronic transitions. The two surface Au atoms serve as ‘hubs’ which contribute towards the HOMO and LUMO (Fig. 12D and E). It indicates that the atomic packing is important in dictating the electronic structures of NCs. Besides core atoms, the protecting ligand shell exerts strong electronic perturbation in NCs. Negatively charged mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) and mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped Au25 NCs display absorption peaks at 670, 440 and 780 nm (Fig. 13A).147 With the introduction of positively charged cysteamine (Cystm), neutral mercaptoethanol (MetH) or neutral dithiol, 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (EDT), the peak at 780 nm becomes prominent and a new peak appears at 980 nm (Fig. 13A). The collocation of different ligands on the surface results in the surface charge anisotropy in the NCs which in turn influences the absorption profile.147 In a ligand exchange reaction with TBBT, rod like biicosahedral Au38(PET)24 NCs yield tetrahedral Au36(TBBT)24 NCs. Parent Au38(PET)24 NCs show absorption peaks at 490, 620, 750 and 1050 nm, whereas the Au36(TBBT)24 NCs show absorption peaks at 380 and 570 nm.108

A silver nanomolecule, Ag35(SG)18, with a sharp absorption band at 490 nm undergoes a ligand exchange assisted size conversion reaction to yield an Ag44(4-FTP)30 NC. The newly formed NC shows multiple absorption bands at 415, 487, 537, 644, 698 and 840 nm which are completely different from those of Ag35(SG)18 NCs (Fig. 13B).139,153 Single Au atom doping in Ag29(DHLA)12 NCs shows a blue shift of absorption bands due to the alteration in the electronic structure (Fig. 13C).61 The alteration in the electronic transition is due to doping or changes in the protecting ligand that affect the behavior in the excited state. Insight into the modulation of PL properties and the relaxation from the excited state is provided in the following sections.
3.2. Photoluminescence
Photoluminescence is one of the most attractive properties of nanomaterials due to the scope in diverse applications. In contrast to the traditional photoluminescent materials such as organic dyes, semiconductor QDs, and perovskite QDs, metal NCs exhibit extreme photostablity, superior biocompatibility and tunable emission.16 As the size approaches the Fermi wavelength of electrons, the electronic transitions in NCs become completely different from those in plasmonic NPs. The luminescence emerging from sub-2 nm sized NCs becomes the centre of attention due to its tunable nature over a wide range of the visible region.10,18 Owing to their precise structure, the influence of the core size and protecting ligand has been closely investigated in recent times. Moreover, the valence electron count, oxidation state of the metal, crystal structure, temperature, and pH are crucial to control the PL of NCs. Although the exact mechanism is yet to be fully established, we will highlight the major factors which regulate the PL behavior (Fig. 10).

3.2.1. Tuning of emission with core size. 
In 2003, Zheng et al. have reported atomically precise gold NCs encapsulated by PAMAM dendrimers with very bright luminescence. The as-synthesized NCs consist of 8 Au atoms and exhibit bright blue emission at 455 nm with 42% QY.154 Dickson et al. have reported the size tunable emission of Au NCs from the ultraviolet to visible green region with an increase in the Au atoms from Au5 to Au13. The comparatively large NCs, Au23 and Au31, exhibit photoemission in the visible red (760 nm) to NIR region (866 nm), respectively (Fig. 14A).10 The red shift of PL maxima with the increase in size indicates that the size of NCs has a profound effect on PL (Fig. 14B). The dependence of emission energy is quantitatively related to the number of atoms, N, by a relationship, (1)where EFermi is the energy of the Fermi level of the metal. The size dependence clearly indicates that the transitions in this series of NCs originate from sp–sp intraband transitions and not from d–sp interband transitions.54 Pepsin capped Au NCs showing tunable emission were synthesized by regulating the reaction pH. A mixture of Au5 and Au8 NCs obtained at pH 9 exhibits emission maxima at 402 nm and a shoulder hump at 480 nm, whereas acidic pH leads to Au13 NCs showing green emission (λmax = 510 nm). In highly basic medium, Au25 NCs are formed with red emission at 670 nm. The red shift of the emission maxima and the consequent decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap with the increase in the core size of Au NCs are evident from this study.38

Reprinted from ref. 10. Copyright 2004 American Physical Society. 
The size and emission energy relationship can be rationalized by considering the electronic perturbation exerted by the capping ligands. The participation of the ligand in the charge transfer to the metal core evidently influences the PL of Au NCs.155,156 A hyperbranched polymer was employed to etch out the large Au nanocrystals into smaller NCs (Fig. 15A). The size evolution from NPs to NCs gives rise to bright blue emission, but the emission has a substantial effect of charge transfer from the ligand to metal core (Fig. 15A).19 Mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) capped Au NPs undergo excess glutathione (GSH) induced etching reaction resulting in Au8 with bluish green emission at 465 nm and Au25 with red emission at 700 nm.98 GSH capped weakly luminescent Au NCs give rise to tunable emission by changing the number of core Au atoms in the presence of excess mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The blue shift of the emission maxima from 652 nm to 510 nm is achieved by decreasing the number of Au atoms from 15 to 6 (Fig. 15B). The weak red emission of Au15 turns into bright orange emission as the core size is reduced to Au12 due to the etching reaction. Finally, Au6 NCs exhibit green emission at 510 nm. The reduction in the core Au atoms gives rise to the tuning of emission from orange to green (Fig. 15B).18

Etching of silver NPs at the water–toluene interface with MSA ends up in a crude mixture of Ag7 and Ag8 NCs. After separation by gel electrophoresis, Ag7 NCs display bluish green emission at 440 nm while weak red emission at 650 nm is observed in Ag8 NCs.75 Luminescent NCs of cheaper and abundant metals such as Cu has been emerging in recent days. As the stability of Cu NCs has not been satisfactory to date, the modulation of PL is a challenging task. Recently, tunable Cu NC synthesis from a polydisperse mixture of Cu NPs by an excess GSH induced digestive ripening has been reported. Red emitting Cu34–32 NCs (emission maximum at 625 nm) have been synthesized at room temperature while the blue emitting Cu25 NCs (emission maximum at 442 nm) have been synthesized at 70 °C (Fig. 15C).64 The effect of size reduction is evident from the tuning of the emission colour.


3.2.2. Influence of ligands. 
It is seen that the protecting ligand influences the PL of NCs because of the electronic interactions. A variety of ligands such as long chain alkylthiols, phenylalkanethiols, peptides and proteins behaved similarly toward dictating the composition and structure of Au NCs (Au25(SR)18).11,31,40,97 Thus, the effect of the ligand on the optical properties of NCs has not been emphasized. With the revelation of different PL behavior in similar sized NCs, the effect of functional groups in capping ligands has been realized based on the electronic transitions of NCs.157,158 The emission wavelength varies from 700 nm to 1300 nm depending on the core atoms of Au clusters from 11 to 201 with different ligands.157 The participation of ligand to metal charge transfer towards the generation of PL was first evidenced in Au28(SG)16 NCs.156 Later, the composition was unambiguously assigned to Au25(SG)18 using the mass spectrometry and crystallographic study.9,21 Due to the lack of a suitable detector, the NIR emission of many Au NCs was not understood previously. Structurally precise Au25(SG)18 NCs exhibit both visible (800 nm) and NIR (1100 nm) luminescence owing to the relaxation from their excited state through fluorescence and phosphorescence with substantial contribution from the ligand shell.156 Whetten and coworkers used two different detectors for visible and IR (400–1550 nm) luminescence measurements. The first setup includes a thermoelectric coupled CCD camera gated with a programmable pulser. The other luminescence detector covering the infrared region was a Nicolet Fourier transform Raman spectrometer coupled with an InGaAs detector.
Au25L18 NCs protected with hexanethiol and GSH show very weak NIR and visible PL, respectively (Fig. 16A and B). The visible emission is attributed to the relaxation originating from the Au13 core, whereas the NIR luminescence arises from the contribution of –S–Au–S–Au–S– semi-ring states (Fig. 16C).55 Zhu et al. reported 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanethiolate (NAPS) protected Au25 NCs ([Au25(NAPS)18]−) with a similar Au13–Au12 core shell structure to [Au25(PET)18]−. But [Au25(NAPS)18]− NCs display a different PL behavior with two emission bands at 740 nm and 680 nm and 6.5 times higher QY than [Au25(PET)18]− NCs which exhibit one exclusive emission band at 740 nm. The band at 680 nm is due to the vibrations from naphthalen-2-yl groups which contribute towards the excited state relaxation involving the Au2S3 semi-ring motifs.159 PAMAM dendrimer templated Au8 NCs have been reported with intense blue emission at 450 nm with a 41% QY. The decay of excited states shows two components: 7.5 ns with 93% contribution is likely to arise from singlet transitions between low lying d bands and excited sp bands and another 2.8 μs component is due to an intraband triplet–singlet transition.154 Jin and coworkers have proposed that the charge transfer from the ligand to metal core occurs through two different ways: (1) charge transfer from the ligand to metal core of NCs through Au–S bonds and (2) direct donation of delocalized electrons from electron rich groups or atoms of the capping ligand to metal core (Fig. 17A–D).158 The PL intensity of Au25 NCs is directly proportional to the electron donation from the ligand to Au core through Au–S bonds. With the enhancement in the electron donating ability of ligands (C6H13 < C12H25 < PhCH2CH2), the PL intensity of NCs increases (Fig. 17A). The anionic [Au25(SR)18]− becomes oxidized in the presence of suitable oxidants and is converted to charge neutral and positive species. The increase in the charge state facilitates electron donation (LMCT) to the metal core leading to a 10 times enhancement in the QY of [Au25(SR)18]2+ than that of monoanionic species (Fig. 17D). In contrast, [Au25(SG)18]− NCs show 100 fold higher QY than [Au25(SC6H13)18]− NCs in spite of the presence of several electron withdrawing (–NH2 and COOH) groups in GSH. In addition, the PL intensity of GSH protected Au25 NCs decreases when they are oxidized to [Au25(SG)18]0. The simple LMCT mechanism cannot explain the phenomena, rather the electron rich –NH2 and –COOH directly donate electrons to the Au25 core which causes significant PL enhancement in [Au25(SG)18]− NCs. Following this direct charge donation mechanism, the fluorescence enhancement in Au38(PET)24 upon ligand exchange with thiolate poly(ethylene glycol) can be explained.160 A series of eight atom Au clusters co-protected with phosphine ligand dppp (Ph2P(CH2)3PPh2) and an arylthiolate, [Au8(dppp)4(SR)2]2+, exhibits emission maxima ranging from 604 nm to 621 nm in methanolic solution. In addition to PhSH, several pyridine based ligands such as (2-Py)SH, (3-Py)SH and (4-Py)SH and 4-nitrothiophenol were incorporated and the perturbations from the organic ligand suggest non-covalent interactions from the heteroatoms of ligands with the Au8 core. Upon acid treatment, the NCs show a PL enhancement for Au8 NCs and a red shift of the emission maxima for (2-Py)SH and (4-Py)SH co-protected Au8 NCs indicating an electron delocalization effect of the ligand.57 The ligand exchange with electron donating thiol induces PL enhancement of Au36(TBBT)24 NCs (TBBT = 4-t butylbenzenethiol). The PL intensity of ligand exchanged Au36 NCs is quenched with the decrease in the electron donating ability of incoming thiol ligands in the order CPT (cyclopentanethiol) > TBBT > BBT (4-bromobenzenethiol) > FBT (4-fluorobenzenethiol).58

Apart from the covalently bound thiol ligands, the secondary ligands substantially affect the electronic transitions with the metal core.161,162 The NIR emission of [Ag29(BDT)12(PPh3)4]3− NCs increases 30 fold when monophosphine ligands are replaced by diphosphines with increased chain length.161 A red emitting 8 atom alloy NC, Au2Cu6(S-Adm)6(PR3)2 (HS-Adm = 1-adamantanethiol), has been reported to have a considerable effect of LMCT involving phosphine ligands.162 When R is a phenyl group, the emission maxima centered at 660 nm with 12.2% QY, whereas the QY rises up to 17.7% with a slight 4 nm blue shift with the increase in the electron donating ability of the ligand (when R = Ph-OMe). On the other hand, the QY decreases to 5.7% with the emission maximum at 667 nm due to the introduction of the electron withdrawing group Ph–F in the ligand.162 The intense red emission of a tetracationic silver nanocluster, [Ag62S13(SBut)32](BF4)4, in both solid and solution phases is ascribed to the radiative decay from an excited state incorporating charge transfer from S 3p to Ag 5s which is perturbed by Ag(I)⋯Ag(I) interactions. The lifetime in the microsecond time scale (31.7 μs in the solid state, λem = 621 nm and 1.5 μs in methanolic solution, λem = 613 nm) confirms the involvement of a triplet excited state.163 Later a comparative study revealed that [Ag62S12(SBut)32]2+ NCs have much higher QY than [Ag62S13(SBut)32]4+ NCs due to the difference in the valence electron count (Fig. 17E and F). The 4 free valence electrons in [Ag62S13(SBut)32]4+ cause luminescence quenching as the LMCT gets hindered, whereas [Ag62S12(SBut)32]2+ exhibits intense PL owing to the absence of free valence electrons (Fig. 17E).164 Near infrared (NIR) emission of PET capped Au38 and hexanethiol protected Au140 increases linearly with the introduction of polar ligands which causes alteration in charge transfer.165 Chang and coworkers reported that the position of the electron withdrawing –COOH group in the positional isomers of mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) affects the emission of Cu NC aggregates.56 The NC aggregates capped with an o-isomer exhibit blue emission at 420 nm, whereas 4-MBA protected NCs show red emission at 646 nm. A new class of protein protected NCs i.e. bovine serum albumin protected Au25 NCs with bright red emission have been reported by Xie and coworkers.11 The temperature dependent PL study reveals that the red emission at 640 nm is due to prompt fluorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (Fig. 18A). A reversible intersystem crossover takes place as the singlet state and Au(I)–S centered triplet state energy gap is very small which results in lifetimes in both nanosecond and microsecond ranges (Fig. 18B).166

The intrinsic structure–fluorescence relationship has been investigated with fluorescent Au24(SR)20 NCs (where R = CH2Ph, C2H4Ph and CH2C6H4tBu) where three of them have similar structures with a bitetrahedral Au8 kernel protected with Au4(SR)5 units.167 Two interlocked pairs of Au4(SR)5 reduce the vibrational loss of emission energy and Au8, being fully bound to thiolates, enhances the effective charge transfer to the metal core through Au–S bonds. The rigid structure triggers intense luminescence in Au24(SR)20 NCs, whereas the Au–Se bond restricts the electron transfer process in Au24(SePh)20 NCs leading to a very weak emission. Additionally, the QY increases from 0.3% to 1.5% and 2% with the increase in the electron donating ability of the ligand from C2H4Ph to CH2Ph and CH2C6H4tBu, respectively.167 Chiral ligand captopril capped Au25 NCs display 1.7 times intense PL than Au25(SG)18 NCs due to the steric effect exerted by captopril.37 The ligand exchange leads to a decrease in the QY of NIR luminescence due to the influence of the binding mode of ligand.168 The electronic perturbation from protecting ligands not only enables wide range PL tuning but also regulates the stability, solubility and chemical reactivity of MNCs.


3.2.3. Influence of alloying. 
The incorporation of a heteroatom in homometallic NCs has been proved to be an effective method for the modulation of the geometric and electronic structures. The composition as well as the electronic behavior of alloy NCs can be engineered precisely.123,133 Bootharaju et al. reported an enhancement (25 fold) of PL intensity in doped AuAg24(DMBT)18 compared to undoped Ag25 NCs.59 A series of Ag atoms are incorporated into rod shaped Au25 NCs which unveils that the position of the Ag atom influences the photophysical properties.169 Alloying up to 12 Ag atoms (AgxAu25−x, x = 1–12) does not affect the PL significantly, whereas incorporation of 13 Ag atoms drastically increases the PL QY 200 times. In the alloy Ag13Au12 NCs, the 13th Ag atom occupies the central position of biicosaheral Ag13Au12 NCs and the HOMO and LUMO position is modified. The strong sd hybridization in Au25 NCs weakens in Ag13Au12 NCs leading to higher electron mobility with faster electron hole recombination.169 Wu et al. investigated the PL of a series of doped MAg24 (M = Pd, Pt, Au and Ag) NCs with the dopant atom occupying the central position of the metal core in both crystal and solution phases.65 A blue shift of the PL band (1042 nm) of Ag25(DMBT)18 NCs is observed upon doping. Interestingly, the luminescence intensity increases 270% and 83% for Au and Pt doping, respectively, whereas the PL intensity decreases 40% upon Pd doping (Fig. 19A). The sequence of the PL intensity PdAg24(DMBT)18 < Ag25(DMBT)18 < PtAg24(DMBT)18 < AuAg24(DMBT)18 is exactly correlated with the electron affinity of the core atom which manifests the contribution of core atom directed LMCT in photoemission.65 Antigalvanic reaction in Au25 leads to the collocation of two Ag atoms to form Au25Ag2 NCs with a blue shift of PL and enhancement of luminescence. A red shift of the PL spectrum of Au25−xAgx NCs is observed when more than 3 Ag atoms are doped into Au25.170 The PL emission maxima shift from 1065 nm to 930 nm with continuous incorporation of Ag atoms into dodecanethiol capped Au25 NCs.88 The alloy NCs with broad PL tunability from 608 nm to 444 nm were synthesized through metal exchange and direct reduction reaction.60 MUA capped monometallic Au NCs formed via a one pot approach show orange-red emission at 608 nm. Bottom up synthesis of the AuAg alloy with MUA gives blue emitting NCs with emission maxima at 444 nm and the reaction of Ag NPs with Au3+. The schematic of all reactions is given in Fig. 19B.60 Reactions of Ag NPs with captopril protected Au NCs yield alloy NCs with intense PL.145 Dithiol protected NCs undergo alloying or doping reactions which affect their structure and electronic transitions of NCs.171 Au doping up to 5 atoms results in a 26 times enhancement in the PL intensity of Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4 NCs. Though the structural integrity of parent Ag29 remains unaltered, the PL becomes visible to the naked eye as moving from undoped to doped NCs (Fig. 19C). The emission maxima are red shifted from 658 nm (10% Au) to 668 nm (40% Au) with an increase in the Au concentration, whereas the absorption peaks shift toward the blue region (Fig. 19D).171

Xie and coworkers theoretically investigated the structural correlation with PL and analysis reveals that the relativistic effect of Au and the heteronuclear Au–Ag bond influences the stability and PL of alloy NCs.172 Single Au atom doping in DHLA capped Ag29 NCs causes a blue shift of the PL band and high QY.61,173 Trimetallic NCs have also been reported to modulate PL emission over a range. The reaction of an Au(PPh3)Br precursor with monodoped PtAg24 gives rise to Pt2Au10Ag13 exhibiting strong emission at 648 nm with 14.7% QY.137 Alloying and doping are the most efficient strategies for regulating the luminescence maxima and the intensity with precise control.


3.2.4. Influence of the surrounding environment. 
Apart from the core size and protecting ligand, the PL behavior of NCs is altered by different external factors such as temperature, solvent, pH etc. Strong temperature dependent emission of Au25(PET)18 and Au38(DT)24 arises due to the charge transfer from the ligand to metal core.174 The emission maxima of buckyball like Ag180 NCs shifts from 723 nm to 623 nm and enhances the PL intensity with lowering of the temperature from 293 K to 93 K.62 Phosphine and thiolate co-protected Ag18 NCs display red emission (690 nm) at 298 K while dual emission at 585 nm and 690 nm is observed at 88 K (Fig. 20A).175 The microsecond and nanosecond scale lifetimes indicate two different emissive states; one from spin forbidden triplet phosphorescence and the other one for LMCT from the S or P 3p to Ag 5s orbital, respectively. The enhancement of the lifetime with the decrease in temperature indicates a decrease in the non-radiative decay pathways of excited states and consequently an increase in the emission intensity.175 Ag12 NCs with a naphthalene-based thiol ligand also exhibit temperature responsive dual emission.63 The thermochromism of NCs is essentially based on the restriction of non-radiative energy dissipation of the excited state by hindering the intra- and inter-NC vibrations and facilitating radiative decay upon cooling.63 GSH protected Au25 showing solid state emission at 700 nm experiences PL quenching with a decrease in temperature. The decrease in emission intensity at lower temperature is attributed to the open shell structure of Au25 leading to non-radiative loss of emission energy.113 Temperature responsive luminescence of MNCs can be considered as a molecular thermometer with an enhanced application perspective.

MNCs, being composed of diverse functional groups in the surface ligand, often display solvent specific optical behavior. The nature of the solvent (polarity, protic or aprotic, coordinating or non-coordinating) controls the electronic properties which eventually influence the emission of NCs.65,176,177 Water soluble hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI) templated Ag NCs were dispersed in different solvents including alcohols, DMF, DMSO, THF etc.177 The intense blue emission of Ag NCs turns into an intense yellow emission as the solvent is changed from water to THF. They show green emission when dispersed in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME). The dipolar change in THF affects only the excited state by redistribution of energy from PEI to the Ag core.177 DNA coated Ag NCs have also been reported to exhibit solvatochromism due to the change in the shape of NCs and dielectric alteration in close proximity in solution.178 The emission of doped NCs is found to be solvent dependent as the PL intensity of PtAg24 NCs increases 100 fold in CH3CN than in DCM.65 A number of NCs are susceptible to aggregation when exposed to a different dispersion medium.68 The change in the solvent polarity reorients the M(I)–S shell in the core–shell type NCs resulting in aggregation and consequent enhancement or quenching of emission.64,68,179 The solvent directed aggregation of NCs will be discussed in the next section.
The QYs of most NCs have been found to be quite low to date in spite of the advancement of designing luminescent MNC synthesis. The limitation has been partly resolved by several researchers through a modification of the ligand shell in NCs. The Xie group has developed a biphasic synthetic strategy for Au, Ag, Cu and Pt NCs by introducing a hydrophobic salt.86 This phase transfer agent provides a mild etching environment which leads to highly luminescent NCs. Lee and coworkers observed the temperature dependent luminescence of Au22(SG)18 controlled by the rigidity of the ligand shell. To rigidify the Au(I)–thiolate shell a tetraoctylammonium cation was allowed to react with the carboxyl groups of GSH. The PL QY of TOA bound Au22 in toluene is enhanced to 60% with a blue shift from 670 nm to 630 nm.180 Afterwards, the same group reported a 37 fold enhancement of emission of an Au22-Py-TOA (Py = aminopyrene) conjugate system through photoinduced energy transfer and rigidification of the ligand shell.181 On the other hand, BSA protected Au25 exhibits red emission at 650 nm with higher QY due to the rigid interlocked structure compared to other Au25 NCs with open chain ligands. Enzyme digestion of BSA-Au25 weakens the compact structure of NCs leading to PL quenching while the rigidification of the ligand shell in Au10(SG)10 with the TOA cation enhances the PL intensity and excited state lifetime.182 Ion pairing in alloy [PtAg28(BDT)12(PPh3)4]4− NCs increases the QY up to 17.6% and the bulkier counter ion (TOA) is proved to be more effective by covering the maximum surface of NCs and making the structure more rigid.183 Most of the surface engineering aids the transfer of NCs to organic media, whereas Deng et al. utilized host–guest recognition to modify the surface of ATT-AuNCs (ATT = 6-aza-2-thiothymine) by L-arginine in aqueous medium.184 The guanine group in arginine forms H-bonds with ATT resulting in the suppression of non-radiative energy loss in the excited state via hindering the rotation and vibration of ligands. Consequently, the PL intensity at 528 nm becomes 34 times higher than that in ATT-AuNCs and the excited state lifetime increases from 13 ns to 86 ns. A schematic of the probable mechanism of PL enhancement is depicted in Fig. 20B.184 A post-synthetic pH adjustment of Au25(Capt)18 (Capt = Captopril) results in different NCs. Upon HCl treatment, the PL emission intensity at 700 nm of the newly formed NCs increases 10 times due to the transformation of the core size and the ligand shell.66 Trypsin template Cu NCs synthesized at pH > 7 display blue emission, whereas a bright yellow emission is observed in acidic pH.81 It has been reported that the NIR luminescence intensity of monothiol, MSA and tiopronin protected Au NCs increases with excess ligands and at 50 °C.185 The selective oxidation of a dithiolate layer upon purification of lipoic acid protected Au22LA12 NCs causes an enhancement of the QY from 1–2% to 10%. The six S atoms become oxidized to SO3− and another 18 S atoms form Au–S covalent bonds. The unfamiliar observation of emission enhancement upon oxidation of surface ligands will shed light on the contribution of ligand shell binding on the photophysical behavior.12


3.2.5. Aggregation induced emission. 
Aggregation induced emission (AIE) is a phenomenon of generation or enhancement of luminescence from non-luminescent or weakly luminescent materials, respectively. Tang et al. have proposed the AIE mechanism for the appearance of solid state emission of siloles (hexaphenylsilole-HPS) which is non-luminescent in the solvent.186 Based on their extensive research, it is now well established that the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM), restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) and restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) are responsible for the emission enhancement in aggregated states.187,188 The core shell structure of several NCs having long –S–M–S–M–S– motifs influences the emission mechanism.67,68,189 The extent of aggregation can be controlled by monitoring several chemical (polarity or pH) and physical (solid state or pressure) parameters.64,68,190–192 Xie and coworkers have described the AIE phenomenon for non-luminescent Au(I)–SG oligomers which turned out to be highly emissive in ethanol. The PL intensity of Au(I)–SG complexes is found to increase and the bright red-yellow emission appeared with the increase in the EtOH content in the medium. The Au(I)–SG complexes were allowed to condense on the Au (0) core to form a core–shell type NC with bright orange luminescence. A large Stokes shift (>200 nm) and microsecond lifetime suggest the contribution of charge transfer states in luminescence.179 Following the same analogy, the intense red emission at 665 nm of Au22(SG)18 was correlated with the mechanism of AIE.67 The optical behavior of Au22(SG)18 NCs is found to be different from those of Au22(SG)16 and Au22(SG)17. This contradiction arises due to a high SG/Au ratio (0.82) in Au22(SG)18 NCs and a core–staple structure consisting of a prolate Au8 core protected by two pairs of interlocked GS-[Au–SG]3 and GS-[Au–SG]4. With a precise formula, the reason behind the strong luminescence is ascribed to the aggregation of surface staples on the Au (0) core.67
AuAg and CuAu alloy NCs have been reported to show AIE involving the surface staples on the M(0) core.189,193–195 The controlled aggregation of Cu(I)–SR complexes on Au(0) results in soluble Au2Cu6 NCs showing red luminescence with 11.7% QY. The intense luminescence is attributed to the LMCT from the aromatic moiety of the ligands to the Cu(I) motifs on the surface.193 The surface motif regulated AIE mechanism is also evident in Cu NCs by regulating the solvent polarity64,104 and pH.191 Water soluble, polydisperse Cu34–32(SG)16–13 NCs exhibit emission enhancement upon freezing which eventually manifests the restriction of intramolecular motion. The motion of surface motifs was regulated by gradually changing the solvent environment with the introduction of EtOH in aqueous medium. In a 90% EtOH–water mixture, the emission maxima shifted from 625 nm to 597 nm with a 36 fold increase in PL intensity (Fig. 21A–C). The hydration shell around the solvated NCs gets disrupted in a less polar environment and the NCs come closer due to Cu(I)–Cu(I) interactions forming compact aggregates. A mechanism based on LMCT via Cu–S bonds has been proposed because of the 265 nm Stokes shift and long lifetime (115.9 ns) of Cu34–32(SG)16–13 NCs. Finally, the lifetime increases to 239.5 ns in 40% EtOH–water solution (Fig. 21D). The dynamics in the excited state involves an intersystem crossing from S1 to T1 followed by the relaxation to a low lying triplet state T2. Being a charge transfer state, T2 is stable in polar media and loses its stability in less polar media. Afterwards, phosphorescence takes place directly from T1 resulting in a blue shift and reinforcement in the emission intensity (Fig. 21E).64

Self-assembly of NCs has made progress in the accomplishment of emission enhancement with the alteration in pH and temperature. The cysteine protected Cu NCs displays a stable red emission at 620 nm at pH 3.0. The hybrid nanostructure becomes weakly luminescent when the pH is less than 1.5 and greater than 4.0 which indicates that the self-assembly triggers emission in a particular environment in solution.192 Besides post-synthetic modification, the synthesis of self-assembled NCs was demonstrated with very high QYs.45,46,196–198 The Yang group has developed several strategies to assemble NCs into organized compact morphologies with thermochromic and mechanochromic properties.46,199,200 Dodecanethiol protected Cu NCs assembled into a nanoribbon emit a cyan color at 490 nm, whereas their greater compactness leads to nanosheets with yellow (547 nm) emission. The spectral changes were attributed to the decrease in the Cu(I)–Cu(I) distance and redistribution of surface ligands from ribbons to sheets. They have also accomplished the destruction and reconstruction of assemblies by mechanical grinding and temperature alteration.46 Red emitting ribbon like self-assemblies are attained with different aromatic thiol capped Cu NCs. An increase in the electron donating ability of functionalities from –F to –OCH3 on the aromatic ring results in a red shift of the emission maxima from 548 nm to 698 nm with reduced full width at half maximum (fwhm) (Fig. 22A and B).199 Temperature controlled emission in a sheet like assembly of Cu NCs is assigned to the LMCT involving a defect state related to Cu(I).200 In this background, Au(I) was doped on the Cu nanosheets to gain a more stable defect state. Owing to the facile Au(I)–Cu(I) interactions, charge transfer from the ligand to Cu to Au leads to the enhancement in the emission intensity (Fig. 22C and D).196 A non-thiolate ligand, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorothiophenol (TFTP) is employed to obtain a bright saffron yellow (590 nm) emission from self-assembled Cu NCs.197 An unfamiliar approach based on the ‘restriction of dissociation-aggregation’ of the surface ligands on the NC core has been proposed to enhance the emission behavior. The PL intensity of Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4 increases 13 fold (QY: from 0.9% to 11.7%) by promoting the aggregation of TPP on the NC surface (Fig. 22E and F). The dissociation and aggregation of TPP are restricted by lowering the temperature. In both the cases, radiative pathways of excited state relaxation become favorable which leads to the emission enhancement.201 In a nutshell, diverse strategies to attain intense and stable luminescence from the NCs have been developed and the extensive control over their emission allows their manifold applications in LEDs, sensing and biology.

3.3. Excited state dynamics
The fundamental understanding of the nature of the excited state in NCs is a foremost task of spectroscopic research. The metallic to non-metallic transition in a series of thiolate-protected Au25, Au38, Au144, Au333, Au∼520 and Au∼940 was investigated using pump power dependent transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The metallic to non-metallic transition between Au144 and Au333 is revealed by the difference in electron–phonon coupling.17 Giant 246 atom Au NC was evidenced to possess non-metallic behavior.202 With distinct absorption peaks at 400, 460, 600 and 800 nm, the Au246(SR)80 (SR = p-methylbenzenethiolate) NCs did not show any pump power dependence like metal NPs. The ground state bleaching (GSB) occurs at 10 ps which is in accordance with the absorption peaks while the broad excited state absorption (ESA) is observed from 650 to 800 nm. After global fitting, three decay parameters were obtained: 1.9 ps for internal conversion (IC) to lower excited states, 4.6 ps for relaxation to the ground state and 73 ps for direct relaxation of the hot excited state. The pump fluence independence and oscillatory wave packet motion on the ground state potential energy surface revealed the non-metallic behavior of Au246.202 The sharp non-metallic to metallic transition takes place within the size regime of Au246 to Au279.203 Considering Au25(PET)18− as a superatom, the relaxation of excited states was correlated with the electronic structure. After excitation, a rapid internal conversion (<200 fs) within the multiple electronic levels of the Au13 core takes place and core to semi-ring relaxation occurs in 1.2 ps.204 Mono-anionic Au25(SR)18− NCs exhibit a decay time 1000 times faster than the neutral [Au25(SR)18]0 NCs while both of them show strong electron–phonon coupling.205 In contrast to anionic NCs, Au25(SR)180 exhibits pump wavelength independent TA spectra though the GSB is in coherence with the absorption spectrum. The correlation of optical transitions with the crystal structure was investigated with the comparison of rod shaped Au25 and spherical Au25 and rod shaped Au38 NCs.206 The temperature dependent optical absorption of Au25 NCs reveals smaller electron–phonon coupling and a minimal increase in oscillator strength indicating negligible involvement of shell-gold phonons with core-gold excitons. Additionally, wavelength dependent decay dynamics of spherical Au25 and rod shaped Au38 NCs arises due to cascade relaxation from the core to shell of NCs while that of Au25 rods is wavelength independent.206 Two structural isomers of Au38(PET)24 NCs, thermodynamically stable Au38Q and low temperature stable Au38T showed distinctly different relaxation dynamics owing to their different atomic structures (Fig. 23).207 Bi-icosahedral Au38Q having a Au23 core shows a 1.5 ps decay time followed by nanosecond relaxation to the ground state. The rapid decay component becomes faster by 50% (1 ps) in the Au38T isomer. The picosecond decay arises due to core–shell charge transfer or an electronic rearrangement within the metal core. The unique mono-icosahedral Au13 capped by an Au12 tri-tetrahedron by sharing two atoms in Au38T helps accelerate the decay (Fig. 23).

A structurally precise Au37 NC which consists of three icosahedron sharing vertex Au atoms forms a rod like structure.208 Upon excitation to the S1 electronic state, electrons in Au37 show ∼100 ps localization from the two vertexes of three icosahedra to one vertex and form a long-lived S1* state which is absent in Au25 (dimer) and Au13 (monomer). Two vibration mode frequencies of 20 and 70 cm−1 traced are assigned to axial and radial breathing modes. The structural distortion in the excited state by strong coherent vibrations is the reason behind the electron localization in Au37 NCs.208p-Mercaptobenzoic acid capped Au130 NCs show multiple peaks at 700, 605, 490 and 390 nm in their UV-Vis absorption spectrum indicating the presence of multiple transitions from different energy states. Two decay components of 2 and 180 ps were observed after global analysis. Unlike NPs, their relaxation dynamics is independent of pump fluence. The authors predicted an energy diagram for Au130(p-MBA)50 NCs with the help of electrochemical experiments.71 Using vis pump-mid IR TA spectroscopy, the complete carrier dynamics of Au130(p-MBA)44 NCs was investigated.209 Apart from manifold electronic relaxation processes including IC, ISC and vibronic cooling, the NC features a long lived triplet state population which may induce unique magnetic properties. Coupled with DFT calculations, visible and NIR pump-mid IR probe TA spectroscopy provides a complete picture of excited state relaxation in water soluble Au102(p-MBA)44 NCs.210 After single photon excitation, the NC electronically relaxes to the ground state within 0.5–1.5 ps and the vibrational cooling occurs in 6.8 ps time. The intersystem crossing (ISC) occurring at 84 ps is faster than the internal conversion (∼ 3.5 ns) to the ground state. The anomalous faster relaxation of the triplet state compared to that of the singlet state is due to the S0–T1 crossover in the Au102(p-MBA)44 NC. A comparative study of Au25(SR)18 NCs protected with hexanethiol and GSH reveals that the growth time is independent of the passivating ligand, whereas the luminescence decay kinetics depends on them due to the involvement of –S–Au–S–Au–S– semi-ring states.55 The excited state decay proceeds through manifold electronic transitions which is evident from wavelength dependent decay and growth kinetics and from the presence of long lived higher excited states.
The periodic FCC series of Au28(SR)20, Au36(SR)24, Au44(SR)28 and Au52(SR)32 NCs (SR = SPh-tBu) exhibit unique characteristics compared to icosahedral Au25(SR)18 and Au38(SR)24 NCs.69 TA spectra of all four NCs feature broad excited state absorption (ESA) spanning over the visible range and the GSB corresponding to the ground state absorption (600 nm for Au28 and Au36, 700 nm for Au44 and 800 nm for Au52) of the NCs. In general, a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap gives rise to faster carrier recombination, whereas global analysis of the TA spectra reveals that the excited state lifetime increases from 59 to 135 ns with a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap from 1.77 eV (for Au28) to 1.39 eV (for Au52) (Fig. 24A). The evolution of the lifetime with the band gap is plotted in Fig. 24B. In Au28 and Au36, the excited state experiences an ultrafast Sn → S1 internal conversion (250 fs), and then structural relaxation occurs within picoseconds followed by the nanosecond decay from S1 → S0. In Au44 and Au52, the IC becomes delayed up to 400–800 fs and the final radiative relaxation becomes slower (Fig. 24C). The appearance of molecular like IC rather than core–shell relaxation along with the slower hot carrier relaxation and band edge recombination with increasing size suggest the absence of surface trap states and the exclusive contribution of the metal core.69 Cysteine protected Cu7 (Cu7L3) NCs possess similar dynamics which was probed by ultrafast upconversion spectroscopy. The fastest decay within 326.8 fs occurs due to the internal conversion from the S4 state to the S1 state just after photo-excitation (Fig. 24D). The following components of 4.8 ps and 1.02 ns were assigned based on theoretical and spectroscopic studies. In the S1 state, structural reorganization occurs in trigonal bipyramidal Cu7L3 NCs within 4.8 ps due to changes in Cu–Cu bond lengths (Fig. 24E). The nanosecond decay parameter signifies the relaxation to the ground state (S0) resulting in intense fluorescence.70 A comparative study was performed for Au25(SR)18− NCs with two different ligands upon interband (400 nm) and intraband excitation (800 nm). The higher energy excitation (400 nm) causes the rise of an electron to the high energy states in the sp band from the ligand band. Afterwards it comes down to the LUMO on a time scale of 700 fs which was achieved from the positive ESA component of 0.69 ± 0.17 ps and the hole in the ligand band relaxes nonradiatively in 4 ps. The corresponding component of 4.92 ps is found to be dependent on the dielectric medium of the solvent and the ligand environment which eventually influence the carrier relaxation dynamics. The longest component (>100 ps) arises due to radiative recombination of holes and electrons. The intraband excitation energy is not sufficient to promote electrons from the ligand band, instead electrons from the HOMO and HOMO−n (superatomic p) move to superatomic d LUMO+n. The solvent and ligand independent dynamics in intraband excitation suggests the involvement of the Au core exclusively.211

The alteration in the structure of NCs by doping influences the carrier relaxation dynamics which was studied by femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. Pd and Pt doped M1Au24 NCs go through a deactivation of the excited state via very fast relaxation within core states (<0.6 ps) followed by core to shell relaxation (3–5 ps) and subsequent decay to the ground state (>1 ns). The excited state dynamics of charge neutral Au25(SR)18 NCs is different from that of Pd1Au24(SR)18 where Pt assists in the core–shell coupling due to the hybridization of the d orbital with 5d and 6s orbitals of Au, resulting in a faster 3.8 ps core shell relaxation component compared to that in PdAu24(SR)18 NCs (5.0 ps) (Fig. 25).212

The effect of Cd and Hg doping is completely different from that of Pd and Pt as the number of valence electrons is 8 for the former atoms. Cd doping strengthens the electron–phonon coupling and increases the phonon frequency while Hg doping behaves oppositely. The 8 electronic Cd/Hg doped NCs show a strong internal conversion in <1 ps, weak decay in 2–4 ps and dominant electron–hole recombination in 50–200 ns. The reports reveal that the number of valence electrons plays the vital role in the relaxation dynamics of NCs (Fig. 25).213 Increased electron–phonon coupling and strong core–shell interactions are evident in Pt and Hg doping in Au NCs owing to the change in the structure and electronic levels.214 Recently, Stoll et al. have used two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to achieve state resolved electron dynamics of Au25(SC8H9)18 NCs which is a new method.215 Distinguishing hot electron relaxation within manifold superatomic D states from the hot hole relaxation within the superatomic P state is made possible. Mechanistic insight into the excited state relaxation by several high-end spectroscopic techniques will solve a number of long standing problems regarding the electronic behavior of NCs.
3.4. Nonlinear optical properties
In 1908, Gustav Mie investigated the interaction of light with gold nanoparticles.24 From then to date, scientists have made tremendous effort to investigate the non-linear optical (NLO) response of gold nanocrystals i.e. nanoparticles having a quasi-continuous band structure. On the other hand, Au NCs having a diameter <2 nm possess discrete energy levels and molecular like HOMO–LUMO transitions. The evolution of the optical properties from NPs to NCs is a strong function of the size and the NLO properties emerged as the primary attention of investigation to reveal the transition from the nanocluster to nanocrystalline state. As a consequence, two photon absorption (TPA), two photon fluorescence (TPF), second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) are extensively studied.43,216 Goodson and coworkers have reported two photon fluorescence of hexanethiolate protected Au25 NCs centered at 830 nm with 1290 nm excitation (Fig. 26A).217 The pump power dependence of fluorescence gave a slope of 2 which signifies the occurrence of TPF (Fig. 26B). The measured TPA absorption cross section at 1290 nm is 2700 GM (1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s photon−1) which is higher than those of many organic chromophores. The pump power dependence of 510 nm emission has a slope of 2 (Fig. 26C and D) and the TPA cross-section increases with the increase in the size of the cluster from Au25 (1.1 nm) to Au2406 (4 nm) (Fig. 26E). The singularity between Au309 (2.2 nm) and Au976 (3 nm) in the TPA cross-section plot with the size of NCs reveals the transition from the NC to nanoparticle regime (Fig. 26F).217 Thomas and coworkers have carried out an investigation on optical nonlinearity with a series of Au NCs such as, Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24 and Au144(SR)60 (R = CH2CH2Ph) and compared with 4 nm Au NPs. The study revealed that NCs are indeed good optical limiters as they do not suffer absorption saturation when excited at the SPR wavelength.218

The NLO properties make Au NCs a suitable candidate for deep tissue imaging and theranostics applications. Antoine et al. carried out hyperpolarizability measurements in addition to TPA and TPF experiments of Au15 and Au25 NCs. The first hyperpolarizability, β, for Au15 (509 × 10−30 esu) is larger compared to that of Au25 (128 × 10−30 esu) which signifies that the NCs show a strong nonlinear response as the number of atoms decreases.219 The NLO responses such as SHG and THG are intricately related to the chirality of NCs. At a fundamental wavelength of 800 nm, Au25(PET)18 NCs do not show any SHG signal, whereas Au38(PET)24 NCs respond significantly. The stark contrast is due to the presence of an inversion centre in Au25 which makes them centrosymmetric. Au38 NCs with a prolate Au23 core and a chiral protecting (RS-Au)x-SR unit (x = 1, 2) exhibit intrinsic chirality. By introducing a chiral ligand captopril, Au25(capt)18 generates a significant SHG signal which confirms the role of chirality on NLO properties.44 Knoppe and coworkers further extended the idea of symmetry breaking by heteroatom doping in Au NCs and it drastically affected the hyperpolarizability value.14 Several theoretical studies also reveal the fact that the symmetry in NCs, maybe inherent or induced by ligand or heteroatom doping, has a very critical influence in generating 2nd order non-linear responses.220,221 Selective exchange of one ligand in NCs can induce chirality in NCs and the possibility is investigated with [Au25(SCH3)17(SR)1]−, where SR is the para substituted benzenethiolate. The substituents are screened over a variety of electron donating (–CH3, –tBu, –NH2, –OH etc.) and electron accepting (–Br, –CF3, –COOH, –CHO, –NO2etc.) groups. The electron donating or accepting ability of the surface ligand largely alters the hyperpolarizability of NCs. A set of ‘push pull’ like systems [Au25(SCH3)16(SPh 4-X)1(SPh 4-X′)1]− (where X = –M substituent and X′ = –M substituent) is designed to quantify the effect on hyperpolarizability due to substitution. The first hyperpolarizability was found to be 284.2 × 10−30 esu (when X = –NO2 and X′ = –NH2) which exceeds the sum of individual –NO2 substituted (157.6 × 10−30 esu) and –NH2 substituted (4.1 × 10−30 esu) analogues. The excess hyperpolarizability is the consequence of the effective charge transfer in this donor acceptor system.221 The investigation is not limited to Au NCs, rather the NLO properties of Ag NCs and AuAg bimetallic NCs are closely investigated.222,223 Two photon absorption is a process of direct transition to high lying excited states by absorbing two incident photons simultaneously. TPA promotes a large number of electrons to the excited states and the low lying states gradually become exhausted. In this situation the absorption cannot increase further and it is called TPA saturation. NL absorption and refraction of Ag29 NCs were studied with the close and open aperture Z scan method at 532 nm. With the increase in the incident light intensity, a valley at Z = 0 indicates the TPA process (Fig. 27). The rational tuning of the concentration and incident light intensity may help achieve TPA saturation. The sample with the lowest concentration (10−4 M) among three different concentrations 10−4, 6.6 × 10−4 and 10−3 M shows a saturation of the valley in Z scan curves and the formation of new peaks in the region near Z = 0. Further increase in effective transmission indicates saturation of the TPA process.223 Atomically precise MNCs are a promising candidate in high resolution multi-photon imaging, deep tissue imaging and optical limiting applications due to their unprecedented NLO properties.14,224

4. Applications
Tunable luminescence properties, photostability and the biocompatible nature of metal nanoclusters have enthralled the scientific community for their applicability in versatile applications such as optoelectronics, sensing, catalysis and bioimaging.1,3,4,45,49,52 Here, we will highlight the use of MNCs in various emerging fields such as optoelectronics, catalysis and sensing areas (Fig. 28).
 Fig. 28  Pictorial representation of the different applications of MNCs. 
4.1. Light harvesting applications
MNCs are being used for optoelectronic applications using solar energy conversion where photocurrent generation occurs due to the migration of photogenerated electrons and holes towards opposite electrodes. The discrete molecular like energy levels of NCs are favorable for designing feasible light-driven applications. Recently, pyrene functionalized Au25 NCs have been used for light-energy conversion where Au25 NCs can act as the electron donor and an anion radical of pyrene allows the directional movement of electrons.225 Tatsuma has demonstrated photon–electron conversion by using a series of GSH-Au NCs adsorbed on TiO2.226 Several research groups have designed Au NC sensitized TiO2 based solar cells where photoexcited electrons are transferred to the LUMO of TiO2 and the holes are transferred to a suitable hole acceptor leading to the light to current conversion.227,228 The size of Au NCs is significant in the Au NC sensitized solar cells due to the difference in charge injection and recombination kinetics and light absorbing ability. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.8% is achieved by using Au10, Au15, Au18 and Au25, Au18(SG)14 NCs (Fig. 29A).228 The mobility of electrons among discrete energy states has been utilized in a nanocomposite system of cysteine protected Cu7L3 with functionalized reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Photoexcited electrons from the LUMO of a Cu NC (−3.7 eV) are transferred to the RGO energy level (−4.42 eV) which is evident from ultrafast spectroscopy.70 Again, Au NCs have been reported to act as electron acceptors in an Au NC–GO hybrid system.229 The photoinduced electron transfer from Cu NCs to methyl viologen derivatives is utilized in determining the characteristics of the pockets of BSA.230 The transport of electrons in MNCs generates an electron–hole pair upon excitation and the unidirectional transfer of electrons or holes to suitable materials gives rise to a photocatalytic redox reaction and will be discussed in the catalysis section.

It is already known that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a donor–acceptor system is a classic method for versatile artificial light harvesting applications in nanoscience. A suitable donor and acceptor pair with spectral overlap between the emission peaks of the donor and absorption peaks of the acceptor with perfect orientation is needed for a successful energy transfer process.3 Pacific blue (PB) dye attached BSA protected Au NCs are found to be suitable for efficient energy transfer where pacific blue (PB) acts as an energy acceptor and the luminescence intensity increases two fold after the energy transfer process. Moreover, the same NCs can act as an energy donor when they are attached with a NIR emitting dye, Dy-750. The FRET process has been used for studying DNA hybridization, molecular beacons and biological labeling where clusters are used as probe molecules.231 GSH protected Au25 NCs and AlexaFlour 488 (A 488) attached to the opposite end of DNA showed energy transfer from A 488 to the Au NC. The externally added Ag+ ions bind with the cytosine residue of DNA and destruct the rigid structure. As a result, the FRET efficiency decreases in the presence of Ag+ due to a change of the distance between the donor and acceptor which helps in probing the conformation of DNA (Fig. 29B).232 An Alexa546-ssDNA templated Ag15 dyad has been reported to manifest 94% FRET efficiency.233 The fluorescence quenching of a DNA-intercalated dye has been reported with Au25 which is wavelength dependent and distinctly different from that of Au NPs.234 pH dependent energy transfer takes place in a conjugate of GSH Au22-fluorescein which was able to probe intracellular pH (Fig. 29C).235 Several semiconductor QD-MNC hybrids have been designed for successful FRET processes for understanding the influence of capping agents.5,236 The FRET efficiency in an Au25 NC-CdTe hybrid is sensitive to the capping ligand present, GSH, cysteine and BSA because the number of Au NCs attached per CdTe varies with ligands. The maximum energy transfer efficiency of 83% was observed in a BSA-Au25 NC-CdTe composite which was dependent on the nature of the ligand (Fig. 29D).237 A BSA capped Au25-coumarin–carbon dot hybrid system has been designed for white light generation by using cascade energy transfer.238 Coumarin dye serves as a bridge between donor carbon dots and acceptor Au NCs enhancing the FRET efficiency from 63% to 83%. The triad assembly gives rise to successful white light generation with 19% QY.238 Moreover, the AIE characteristics i.e. long lifetimes and large Stokes shifts of MNCs are beneficial for designing LEDs using several composites of chitosan,239 polyurethane,240 substituted tetraphenylethene,241 and substituted biphenyl compounds.242 Self-assembled Cu NCs have been incorporated as phosphors in colour conversion layers of LEDs owing to their strong and tunable emission.45,46,196,199 The tunable emission of self-assembled Cu nanosheets was achieved with different Au(I) doping and a white LED was fabricated by combining the differently emissive nanosheets (Fig. 29E).196 The constantly improving emission properties and excited state behavior will enable us to design more efficient light harvesting systems based on metal clusters.
4.2. Sensing applications
The design of metal cluster based sensors is another active field of research in nanoscience where analytes are recognized by the change in the optical behavior of NCs.52 PL quenching occurs due to analyte induced aggregation when analytes bind through metallophilic interactions. On the other hand, PL enhancement is found when metal deposition occurs on the NC surface. It is found that MUA capped Au NCs interact with Hg(II) via carboxyl groups of MUA which causes fluorescence quenching and the limit of detection (LOD) of Hg(II) is found to be 5.0 nM.243 Cu2+ detection has been reported with poly(methylmethacrylic) acid (PMAA) protected Ag NCs.244 Al3+ sensing by PEGylate MSA AuAg NCs,106 and detection of Zn2+ by histidine and MPA co-protected Au NCs245 have been reported through ligand induced aggregation. The red emission of BSA protected Au NCs is completely quenched in the presence of Hg(II) owing to the interaction of Hg2+ and Au+ and the LOD is found to be 0.5 nM.246 The luminescence quenching of GSH and MPA co-protected Au NCs occurs in the presence of Pb2+ and the detection limit is found to be very low as 10 nM (Fig. 30A and B).18 The deposition of any foreign metal atom in the core of MNCs may lead to the galvanic or anti-galvanic exchange which eventually modifies the absorption and luminescence properties.50,247,248 FRET based systems have been designed using metal clusters to recognize a specific toxic ion. A composite of BSA capped Au NCs and GSH protected CdTe QDs is being used to detect both Hg2+ and F− ions as the emission of CdTe QDs at 553 nm is quenched upon addition of Hg2+ and an enhancement of the PL intensity occurs in the presence of F−. The quenching of the emission intensity in the composite is attributed to the salt induced aggregation leading to the selective detection of Hg2+ with an LOD of 9 nM (Fig. 30C). On the other hand, F− ions disrupt the H-bonding between GSH and BSA preventing the energy transfer from QDs to Au NCs and the probe is able to detect F− with an LOD of 117 nM by the restoration of QD emission (Fig. 30D).51

Using energy transfer from CdTe to GSH Au NCs in the composite system, cysteine was selectively detected with a detection limit of 192 nM. Here, cysteine binds to the surface of Au NCs by replacing GSH which etches the Au core, inhibits the energy transfer from QDs to NCs and causes an enhancement in the emission of QDs (Fig. 31A).249 Based on nano surface energy transfer (NSET) from an organic dye to Ag NPs, a sensitive Hg2+ sensor was developed.250 A DNA metal base pair based on/off probe was designed by Patra et al. which enabled selective recognition and removal of Hg2+ ions.251 Hoechst (HOE), a minor groove binder dye, was attached to DNA via hydrophobic interactions. The PL turn off of HOE is observed upon incorporation of Hg2+ due to thymine–Hg2+ bond formation. Au NCs act as scavengers and bind with Hg2+ owing to metallophilic interactions. The turn on of HOE emission is achieved when Hg2+ is free from DNA (Fig. 31B).251 Small anions such as nitrite and cyanide were identified by hyperbranched polyethyleneimine protected Ag NCs and thiosalicylic acid protected Cu NCs, respectively.56,252

Several biomolecules have been detected based on the interaction with ligands or several enzymatic reactions. Luminescence of DPA capped Cu NCs was quenched in the presence of H2O2 and this was utilized to detect H2O2 and glucose through an enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase.191 C-Reactive protein and proteases were detected through luminescence quenching of Au NCs.253,254 Explosive trinitrotoluene was detected by luminescence quenching in a BSA-Ag15 NC and silica coated Au mesoflower composite (Fig. 31C).255 AuAg bimetallic NCs are proved to be a potential sensor of several toxic gases such as CO, HCN and NO.256 Several hazardous pesticides and herbicides have been detected by employing the luminescence of NCs.257,258 Thus, metal cluster based sensors have potential for the detection of toxic metal cations and anions and other bio-hazardous molecules which is beneficial for the healthcare and environmental sectors.
4.3. Biological applications
Biomolecules such as DNA,259 amino acid,70 protein,11 peptide260 and enzyme81 are used as templates in the synthesis of NCs to increase their biocompatibility. Their superior biocompatibility, water solubility, sub-nanometer size, large Stokes shift, and NIR emission allow us to construct luminescent probes for bioimaging applications with MNCs. Luminescent metal clusters are found to have potential for bio-imaging and other applications.7,49,261 BSA protected Au NCs conjugated with Herceptin act as a fluorescent probe for imaging and specific targeting in overexpressive breast cancer cells (Fig. 32A).262 After attachment with folic acid, the same BSA Au NCs detect carcinoma cells by staining while leaving the unaffected cells unstained.263

Nienhaus et al. have utilized DPA capped Au NCs as nanoprobes in bio-imaging. Their internalization by HeLa cells and low cytotoxicity were revealed by trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 32B).264 MSA capped Au NCs functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) participated in lifetime imaging in single cell and subcellular levels. Compared to the organic dye Alexa 488, Au NCs exhibits better photostability in a cellular environment.265 MPA protected Au NCs are found to be more active towards cellular uptake and reactive oxygen species generation and response towards NCM460 human colon epithelial cells that Au NCs protected with GSH.266 The Häkkinen group reported covalently attached functionalized linkers that bridge Au102(p-MBA)44 to cysteine residues on the surface of enteroviruses echovirus 1 (EV1) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) without compromising the infectivity of the viruses.267 ds-DNA hosted Cu NCs were used for early stage cancer detection using the mismatch dependent PL at room temperature (Fig. 32C).259 Antibody and protein templated Ag NCs were employed for staining the NIH 3T3 cell surface and their subsequent internalization inside the cells was monitored.268 As lysozomes can destroy the bacterial cell walls by attacking peptidoglycans abundant in Gram positive bacteria, lysozome-Au NCs proved their ability to target pathogenic bacteria, including pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), S. aureus, and E. coli.269 The Xie group reported GSH protected Ag NCs which display superior bactericidal efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.102 Au25 NCs protected with biocompatible ligands (GSH and BSA) show higher tumor accumulation owing to an enhanced permeability and retention effect and act as a stronger radiosensitizer. The high ability of radiotherapy is due to DNA damage caused by the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering of the Au25 NCs.260 Manifestation of a synergistic effect in GSH capped Au NCs toward the tumor uptake and specific targeting by the improved EPR effect was reported by Xie et al.270 The biomedicinal applications of NCs will flourish to address the real world issues.
4.4 Catalytic applications
Structurally precise MNCs have been proved to be a class of model catalysts owing to their monodispersity, high surface to volume ratios, versatile crystal packing, presence of low-coordinated sites and sharp electronic changes upon atomic level doping.4 Compared to bulk gold, discrete energy levels of Aum(SR)n NCs ignited the scope of electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and organic catalysis. The appearance of non-metallic behavior in sub-2 nm particles i.e. MNCs indeed enhances their catalytic activity compared to their larger analogues.17,271 The exhaustive use of fossil fuels in industrial and transport purposes has caused the depletion of conventional energy sources and poses severe threat to the environment. The photocatalysis and electrocatalysis of MNCs have emerged because of the requirement of green, sustainable alternative energy sources.
The directional movement of electrons in NCs upon light irradiation has been utilized in different photocatalytic reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction and dye degradation. Photoinduced electron transfer takes place from ZnO NPs to Au NCs in their composites where the electron transfer rate is dependent on the size of NCs.272 Among Au25, Au144 and Au807, Au807(SG)163 NCs shows the maximum catalytic activity in the degradation of the organic pollutant, thionine. In this visible light driven photocatalysis, the Au25(SR)18 NC showed 1.6 times higher photocatalytic activity of TiO2 (Fig. 33A and B).48 TiO2 nanotube arrays were attached with Au NCs and the composite systems were found to be suitable for water splitting, organic pollutant decomposition and solar cell sensitization under a solar light simulator (Fig. 33C).47 GSH protected Au NCs act as a cocatalyst in the water splitting reaction using BaLa4Ti4O15 as a photocatalyst.273 The Xiong group has covalently grafted metal cations (Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) via a bridging ligand cysteine. The whole assembly was utilized in CO2 photoreduction with visible light and the d band of the transition metal regulates CO2 activation by dictating electron transfer from Au NCs and CO2 activation.274 The architecture of a suitable nanostructure with MNCs can gear up the applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction or hydrogen generation. Au25(PET)18 loaded on TiO2 acts as a semiconductor with a small band gap to absorb visible light, facilitates electron–hole separation and produces singlet oxygen (1O2) causing dye degradation.275 Upon aerial exposure, the stable anionic [Au25(PET)18]− undergoes oxidation to the neutral form which has different electronic and crystal structures and the redox reaction is found to be reversible.276 The reversible redox behavior of Au NCs was utilized in catalytic oxidation of CO and conversion of CO2 and many other reactions. Au25 acted as a catalyst in the CO2 → CO conversion reaction with a 90 mV formal potential and showed peak CO production at −1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.277 The negatively charged Au25(PET)18− stabilized CO2 and H+ and promoted the reaction CO2 + H+ + 2e → CO + H2O, whereas the cationic Au25(PET)18+ promoted CO oxidation, CO + 2OH− − 2e → CO2 + H2O, by stabilizing coadsorbed CO and OH−. This study revealed the role of charged active sites in the catalytic activity of NCs.278 Later, the Jin group designed a carbon negative CO2 management technology using the Au NCs as the catalyst.279 Theoretical calculations suggest that the Au NCs facilitate CO2 reduction by partial removal of thiol ligands and opening of active sites.280 The charge state of Au25(DT)18 NCs affects the electroreduction of O2 to form H2O2 and the negatively charged NCs were found to exhibit the maximum catalytic activity.281 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by silver NCs proved to be a potential candidate for alkaline fuel cells.282 A composite of Aun/CoSe2 (n = 25, 144 and 333) enhances the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting involving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Au25/CoSe2 displays a much improved overpotential (∼0.43 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) compared to plain CoSe2 (∼0.52 V) due to successful formation of an OOH intermediate and desorption of oxygen molecules (Fig. 32A).283 The HER has been reported to be catalyzed by MoS2 in the presence of an Au NC cocatalyst.284 DNA templated Au NCs integrated with carbon nanotubes enhance the performance of bilirubin oxidase (BOD) catalyzed enzymatic ORR by improving the electronic interactions between the electrode and the enzyme active site.285 pH dependent electrocatalytic activity of GSH protected Au25 NCs helps in atmospheric sensing by catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbic acid and dopamine.286

Heterogeneous catalysis in organic reactions is indispensible in industrial large scale synthesis and MNCs have been proved to be an unrivalled candidate due to their superior surface activity.4 Aerobic oxidation of alcohol,287,288 carbon monoxide,289,290 thiophenol,291 and hydrocarbons292,293 has been reported to be catalyzed by Au NCs integrated with different support materials such as carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, Al2O3, CeO2, TiO2etc. Gold atoms supported on functionalized carbon nanotubes become aggregated to NCs and display enhanced catalytic activity in thiophenol oxidation than single gold atom or gold NPs.291 Single Pd atom doping in Au25(DT)18 significantly promotes the rate of aerial oxidation of benzyl alcohol due to intracluster electron transfer from Pd to Au (Fig. 34B).287 Bimetallic AuCu NCs (Au13Cu2, Au13Cu4, and Au13Cu8) with an icosahedral Au13 core and various Cu shells capped by thiolate and phosphine ligands undergo selective release of ligands at high temperature, thereby opening the active sites of catalysts.288 The monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic NCs show different activity depending on the coordination and decomposition of ligands and synergistic effects exerted by the heteroatom.288,289,292,294 Gold NCs have proved their potential in chemo- and stereoselective oxidation and reduction and C–C cross coupling reactions.295 Depending on the nuclearity of Aun(SR)m, catalytic oxidation of styrene yields alcohol, ketone and epoxide in different ratios. Aun(SR)m also successfully catalyzes the chemoselective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones (Fig. 34C).296 Together with the high surface activity of NCs, the rational design of catalytic sites by tuning the ligand, doping and support material would be useful for electro-, photo- and organic catalytic applications.

5. Conclusion and perspective
Quantum sized metal NCs formulated as Mn(SR)m (M = Au, Ag and Cu) have been proven to be potential functional novel nanomaterials. The major concern in synthesizing metal clusters is molecular purity and understanding their structure–property relationship for future applications. We have summarized several well-developed methodologies such as direct reduction, chemical etching, ligand and metal exchange and intercluster reactions to obtain monodisperse homometallic and heterometallic NCs. The crystal structure of metal clusters eventually controls the electronic transition and physical properties of metal clusters. The photophysical properties of these clusters are found to be dependent on the core size and the nature of ligands because the charge transfer from the ligand to metal core is found to be influenced by the electronic structure, functional groups, electronegativity of the metal, valence state and presence of heteroatoms. Apart from these structural parameters, surrounding parameters such as temperature, pH, solvent and modification of the surface also play an important role in the photophysical properties of the metal clusters. Aggregation induced emission is a contemporary topic of research to improve the QY of the NCs and control the emission over the wide range of visible and NIR regions. The investigation on the excited state relaxation process with femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy enlightens the molecular like processes in NCs. Moreover the non-linear optical behavior enables several optical limiting applications of NCs. We have covered the optical transition based applications in photovoltaics, photocatalysis, white light generation, luminescence based sensing, bioimaging and catalysis. Application of luminescent metal nanoclusters is still in the embryonic stage, and further investigations in this field are necessary for an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon. The determination of molecular purity is a challenge because of the difficulties of crystallization of NCs due to the presence of a number of functional groups at the surface. Additionally, Cu NCs are very difficult to stabilize in solution for a long time due to their susceptibility to aerial oxidation. Though diverse strategies such as surface modification and AIE have been developed to improve the PL behavior, the QYs of most NCs reported to date are not satisfactory. Moreover, the exact mechanism of PL is not known as the core size, oxidation state, protecting ligand and surrounding parameters collectively dictate the emission. The particular influence of the M(0) core, M(I)–S surface motifs and bonding interactions with the ligand is still elusive. The LMCT process needs more attention which can be served by studying excited state relaxation in an ultrafast time scale. The photovoltaic application is hindered as most of the NCs have maximum absorption in the UV range of the spectrum. More NCs with visible range absorption still need to be developed. Biological applications require hydrophilic NCs with very high PL QY, whereas the catalytic applications demand a structurally precise formula of NCs. We hope that the efforts devoted by researchers will overcome the difficulties in the coming years. Therefore, such atomically precise luminescent metal clusters would be beneficial for future applications in efficient light harvesting or chemical sensing applications.
