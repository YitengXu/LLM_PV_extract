    , Accepted 9th February 2015First published on 27th February 2015AbstractOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) were fabricated with blended active layers of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]:[6,6]-phenylC71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM). The active layers were prepared in chlorobenzene (CB) with different additives of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1,8-dibromooctane and different concentrations using a wet process with spin coating. The effects of different solvent additives were studied with respect to photovoltaic parameters such as fill factor, short circuit current density, and power conversion efficiency. The absorption and surface morphology of the active layers were investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), respectively. The results indicated that structural and morphological changes were induced by the solvent additives. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) of PTB7/PC71BM prepared by a spin coating method using DIO and 1,8-dibromooctane showed more improved PCE of 6.76%. The enhancement of performance of PSCs could be mainly attributed to the absorption enhancement and the improved charge carrier transportation.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been developed rapidly over the last decade because of their high possibility for commercialization based on a solution process.1–3 Recent progress in organic solar cell development has demonstrated an impressive improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) which has already reached 9.35%.4
Poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) is a promising electron donor material, which could be blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor material and yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 8% in a single bulk hetero-junction device structure.5 Due to its low-band-gap, PTB7 can efficiently absorb photons at long wavelengths. However, in order to be commercially comparable with other types of photovoltaic devices, further effort is still required to further improve the PCEs of OPVs.6,7
Several approaches have been considered in an effort to further improve the PCE of polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells which include synthesizing new active materials, varying the donor–acceptor ratio, using solvent additives,8–10 and so on. Among them, the solvent additive approach has been widely adopted because of their simpler inclusion in experimental operations as compared with conventional thermal annealing processes, and an ideal bulk heterojunction may be achieved in an active layer.11 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is one of the most popular solvent additives that has been used to improve the morphology of the active layer of BHJ solar cells, especially for OPVs with low-band-gap polymers such as poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]] (PCPDTBT) and poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT).8,12 On the other hand, 1,8-dibromooctane, 1,8-dioctanedithiol, and 1,8-octanedithiol are also used as solvent additives to improve the PCE of BHJ solar cells.12
In this letter, 1,8-dibromooctane was used as the solvent additive to fabricate BHJ polymer solar cells based on PTB7/PC71BM as the active layer. The concentration of DIO and/or 1,8-dibromooctane was varied with different ratios during the solution preparation of the organic active layer. The effect of the solvent additives was investigated in PTB7:PC71BM blended films. The morphology of the active layer with different solvent additive ratios has been studied and the related OPV device performance has also been reported.
For the convenience of discussion, different films and devices were named and prepared to compare their performances:
Film 1: PTB7:PC71BM.
Film 2: PTB7:PC71BM, 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane.
Film 3: PTB7:PC71BM, 3 v/v% DIO.
Film 4: PTB7:PC71BM, 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane and 3 v/v% DIO.
Device 1: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/film1/LiF/Al.
Device 2: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/film2/LiF/Al.
Device 3: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/film3/LiF/Al.
Device 4: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/film4/LiF/Al.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Fabrication of solar cells
PC71BM and 1,8-dibromooctane were purchased from nano-C and Sigma-Aldrich respectively. PTB7 was supplied by 1-material with a molecular weight of ∼200 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity of ∼4. PTB7 and PC71BM were co-dissolved in chlorobenzene at 20 mg ml−1 with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 to form a mixed solution. Moreover, organic materials were weighed and dissolved under ambient air conditions. The devices were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/PTB7:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 were cleaned consecutively in ultrasonic baths containing glass lotion, ethanol and de-ionized water, and then dried using high purity nitrogen gas. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were then treated by UV-ozone for 5 min for further cleaning the substrates and improving the work function of ITO substrates. The PEDOT:PSS (purchased from Clevios AI 4083) was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rounds per minute (rpm) for 50 s. Then PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates were dried in air at 150 °C for 20 min. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. On the other hand, in order to fabricate the different devices as designed in experiment, 1%, 3% and 5% of 1,8-dibromooctane by volume were added to PTB7/PC71BM mixed solution, respectively. The active layers with different ratios of 1,8-dibromooctane were then formed by spin-coating on PEDOT:PSS with the same spin-coating parameters: 1 s for acceleration and 120 s with a rotation speed of 1000 rpm. On the top of the active layer, a 0.8 nm interfacial layer of LiF was deposited under 4 × 10−4 Pa vacuum conditions. The thickness of LiF was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance. An aluminum cathode layer of about 100 nm was then deposited on the LiF layer under 4 × 104 Pa vacuum conditions. The active area was defined by the vertical overlap of the ITO anode and the Al cathode which is about 9 mm2.
2.2. Photovoltaic characterization
The absorption spectra of films were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. The film thickness was measured using a KLA Tencor P6 stylus profiler. The thickness of films 1–4 were 89 nm, 83 nm, 71 nm and 59 nm respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum with the power of 100 mW cm−2 generated by a ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator. The C–V measurements were carried out in the dark. For C–V measurements, the dc bias voltage sweep (−2 V to 1.5 V) was superimposed by a low frequency (2 kHz) ac voltage with a small amplitude (100 mV) to prevent any influence of the ac signal on the measured capacitance. The corresponding J–V curves were recorded from −1 V to 1 V with an interval of 0.01 V. An incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded on a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. The morphology of the films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a multimode Nanoscope IIIa operated in tapping mode. All the samples were measured with scan sizes of 5 × 5 μm2. The secondary ion mass spectrum was obtained by using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer TOF-SIMS 5 from ION-TOF GmbH (Munster, Germany). A Bi1+ liquid metal ion gun operating at a 30 keV beam voltage with a 45° incident angle was used. The depth profiling experiment was performed using a gas cluster ion gun Ar1700+ with an analyzed area of 100 × 100 μm inside an etching area of 500 × 500 μm. All analyses were carried out at 256 × 256 pixels. Charge compensation with an electron flood gun was used during the analysis cycles. Negative ion mode spectra were calibrated on the C−, CH−, C2− and C2H− peaks. Moreover, all the tests were carried out under ambient air conditions.
3. Results and discussion
The J–V characteristic curves of PSCs with different 1,8-dibromooctane ratios are shown in Fig. 1a. The PV performances of PSCs were summarized according to J–V curves and are listed in Table 1. Among all the different ratios, it can be found that the device with 3 v/v% of 1,8-dibromooctane demonstrated the highest median of 4.70% for PCE along with a short-circuit current Jsc of 11.11 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.75 V, and a FF of 56.50%. This PCE was 71.5% higher than that of the control device which was 2.74%. The data in Table 1 show that the PCE improvement was mainly attributed to the enhancement in Jsc and FF, where Jsc increased from 7.22 mA cm−2 to 11.11 mA cm−2 with 53.9% increase while FF increased from 49.98% to 56.50% with 13.0% increase. To further investigate the mechanism responsible for the enhanced performance of the PSCs with the 1,8-dibromooctane additive, the optimized volume ratio of 3% was used.

The J–V curves of PSCs with different solvent additives under illumination of simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 1b and Table 2 summarizes the device performance results. Device 1 demonstrated a PCE of 2.74% with a Jsc of 7.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V, and a FF of 50.0%. As shown in Table 2, with the addition of 3 vol% 1,8-dibromooctane (volume fraction of chlorobenzene) in Device 2, Jsc increased to 11.11 mA cm−2 and FF increased to 56.50%, which resulted in a PCE of 4.70%. If both 3.0 v/v% DIO and 3.0 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane were added to the solution prior to spin casting, the PCE of device 4 was further increased to 6.76% along with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 14.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.4%. The improved Jsc value was confirmed by measuring the incident photon converted electron ratios (IPCE) (Fig. 1c). The maximum IPCE value of the PSCs without an additive was 39.4%, and it increased to 68.8% for PSCs with 3 v/v% DIO and 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane. Note that theoretical Jsc obtained by integrating the product of the IPCE data in Fig. 1c and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum (7.65 mA cm−2 and 14.63 mA cm−2 for the devices without an additive and with 3 v/v% DIO and 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane respectively), which are in good agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 1b, Table 2).5 The single logarithmic dark current curves show that the devices 4, 3 and 2 have a smaller leakage current compared with device 1, as shown in Fig. 1d. It is well-known that the leakage current is determined by the shunt resistance (Rsh).13 The larger Rsh indicates a lower charge carrier recombination in the active layer. This indicates that DIO and/or 1,8-dibromooctane can effectively restrain the leakage current under reverse bias, which may provide effective charge carrier transport in the blend layers, resulting in the increase in Jsc, compared to that of device 1. The smaller Rs indicates a lower resistance of the semiconductor bulk resistance and a better metal/semiconductor interface connection induced by using co-additives.13

We also investigated the effect of PTB7:PC71BM system solar cells without or with 3 v/v% DIO and/or 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane by measuring the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics (Fig. 2). The accumulated space charge inside the device can increase its capacitance. As the applied voltage increases, the capacitance tends to increase to a peak and then decrease. The Vbi is correlated with the voltage Vpeak at the peak capacitance as14,15 (1)where Vbi is the built-in potential in the devices, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the magnitude of the electron charge. In photovoltaic devices, a higher Vpeak implies a higher Vbi and thus a higher Voc.16,17 The tendency of Vpeak without or with 3 v/v% DIO and/or 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane obtained in Fig. 2 perfectly matches the Voc measured from J–V characteristics.

To understand the role of solvent additives in the mixture of PTB7 and PC71BM, further characterization was carried out to study the surface morphology, optical and electrical properties of the blended films without or with 3 v/v% DIO and/or 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane. The absorption spectra of the neat PC71BM and PTB7 films are shown in Fig. 3a. PC71BM has two apparent absorption peaks at 375 nm and 480 nm, which widen the active layer absorption in the short wavelength range. The absorption spectra of PTB7 shows an apparent complementary absorption in the range from 550 nm to 750 nm. Two broad absorption peaks at around 624 and 682 nm are attributed to the characteristic π–π* transition of the PTB7 polymer.9,18,19 Comparing the absorption spectra of the films prepared with and without solvent additives, there was no obvious peak shift both in the films prepared with organic additives and in the films prepared with pristine CB, as shown in Fig. 3b. This indicates that the thin films prepared with additives have an amorphous phase. On the other hand, it can be found that there is an obvious increase of relative absorption intensity in the region of 300–800 nm for films 2–4. This result indicated that the films with solvent additives can harvest solar photons more effectively than the film without solvent additives under the same conditions. The more the light absorption the higher the photocurrent generation.20 This is the reason why the Jsc increased with solvent additives. On the basis of IPCE and absorption results, it is clear that DIO and 1,8-dibromooctane as co-additives greatly broaden the wavelength range for absorption enhancement compared with either 1,8-dibromooctane or DIO.
 Fig. 3  (a) The absorption spectra of neat PTB7 and PC71BM films; (b) absorption spectra of PTB7/PC71BM films cast from solvents with or without DIO and/or 1,8-dibromooctane additives. The data was normalized by the film thickness. 
In order to investigate the effect of DIO and/or 1,8-dibromooctane on the morphology of blend films, the surface topography and phase images of the blend films were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (5 μm × 5 μm). Fig. 4 shows atomic force microscope (AFM) images of films 1–4. It has been found that film 1 was formed by uniformly distributed grains with a grain size from ≈50 nm to 300 nm, which are identified as large PC71BM rich domains embedded in a polymer matrix, appearing as a dark region in the images, in agreement with many other research studies on the polymer:fullerene BHJ system.9,21,22 It can indicate that PTB7 and PC71BM might not have good mutual solubility so that the fullerenes actually aggregated to a certain degree.23–25 When 3 v/v% of 1,8-dibromooctane was added, the number of grains was reduced dramatically although the grain size increased to about 400 nm, which implies that the mutual solubility of polymers increased with the help of 1,8-dibromooctane, however, it was still not sufficient enough to avoid aggregation of fullerenes during the film formation. A mutual interaction between the molecules might have an influence on the blend film formation.26 On the other hand, film 3 reveals no obvious grain on the surface, indicating that there is sufficient mutual solubility of polymers which leads to an interpenetrated blending through excellent percolation of the polymers. The polymer chains of PTB7 and PC71BM are fully extended and entangled with each other. No obvious aggregation can be observed. This will definitely prevent carriers from recombination and improve the carrier transport, which could have contributed to the distinctively enhanced PCE (5.80%) of the resulting OPV.9,27 It can also be the reason why device 2 reveals a moderate PCE of 4.46%, which is distinctively lower than that of device 3, although it is rather higher than device 1. For device 4, it can be seen that the roughness (RMS) of film 4 has been increased slightly compared to that of film 3, which implies that the co-additive effect might have resulted in a moderate formation of the nanomorphology of molecules, which leads to further improvement of PCE of the OPV to 6.76%.28

The surface of the film prepared with additives appeared to be smoother than that of the film prepared without additives, which suggested a well-mixed heterojunction. We next characterized the chemical composition of the blends as a function of the sputter time, using surface mapping analysis. Fig. 5 shows the yield of fluoride ions (F−) as a function of the sputter time, obtained using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS). The F− ions are unique to PTB7.29,30 The F− ion yield of film 1 induced a more obvious reduction than that of films 2–4, from 5 s to 150 s, as indicated in both Fig. 5 and Table 3. The results gave evidence that the distribution of PTB7 molecules in the film with additives was more evenly distributed than that of PTB7 molecules in the film without additives in the vertical direction. Meanwhile, they also demonstrated an even distribution of PC71BM. What is more, the PTB7 domains with additives were more evenly distributed along the vertical direction compared with domains of those without additives. This suggested that the chemical composition of the blend along the vertical direction changed, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Fig. 7 reveals the effect of the additive treatment on the photocurrent density (Jph). The value of Jph is calculated using the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the plot of Jph with respect to the effective voltage Veff = Vo−V, where Vo is the compensation voltage at which Jph equals zero and V is the applied voltage. The saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons if we assume that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes at a high Veff;31,32Jsat is 8.0 mA cm−2 for device 1, 12.3 mA cm−2 for device 2, 13.2 mA cm−2 for device 3, and 15.2 mA cm−2 for device 4. The increased Jsat should be attributed to the effective charge carrier transport and collection for the PSCs with additive treatment.33 To gain more insight into the influence of the additives on exciton generation, we measured the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of our PSC devices. Gmax could then be calculated using Jph = eGmaxL, where L is the thickness of the active layer. From Fig. 5, the values of Gmax for the devices 1–4 are found to be 5.62 × 1027 m−3 s−1, 9.26 × 1027 m−3 s−1, 1.16 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.61 × 1028 m−3 s−1 respectively. Gmax slightly increased after the addition of additives, suggesting increased light absorption in device with additives.32 This matches well with increased absorption as determined by the absorption spectra.

In order to further investigate the solvent additive effect on the charge carrier transport, the hole-only devices were fabricated based on pristine PTB7 films and blend PTB7:PC71BM films with/without additives. The high-work-function material gold (Au) is used as the cathode to block the back injection of electrons. The dark J–V curves of the hole-only devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7/Au and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Au were measured and shown in Fig. 8. The hole transport through the polymer film is limited due to the accumulation of space charge when a sufficient voltage is applied to this hole-only device. The space charge limited current (SCLC) is described by the equation34,35 (2)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the blend material, μ is the hole mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device and d is the active layer thickness. The parameter εr was assumed to be 3, which is a typical value for conjugated polymers. The hole will be collected by the ITO electrode, which is very similar to the hole transport process in the PSCs. The J–V characteristics of neat PTB7 and PTB7:PC71BM with/without co-additives of 3 v/v% DIO and 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane fully agree with the SCLC model. According to the J–V curves, the hole current density of hole-only devices with 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane is larger than that of hole-only devices without any additive; and the hole current density of hole-only devices with 3 v/v% DIO is larger than that of hole-only devices with 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane. Moreover, the hole current density of hole-only devices with a co-additive of both 3 v/v% DIO and 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane is larger than that of hole-only devices with only 3 v/v% DIO. This means that the hole carrier transport in hole-only devices with 3 v/v% DIO and/or 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane has been improved compared with that of hole-only devices without any additive. The enhanced current density of the hole-only device with 3 v/v% DIO and/or 3 v/v% 1,8-dibromooctane further demonstrates that the improved hole carrier transport could be the main reason for the increased Jsc of PSCs.35,36

4. Conclusion
A series of PSCs with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer were fabricated to investigate the solvent additive effect on the performance of PSCs. DIO and 1,8-dibromooctane were used as the solvent additives. The experimental result of photovoltaic performance reveals an enhancement of Jsc from 7.22 to 14.35 mA cm−2 and a FF from 50.0% to 65.4% by adding DIO and 1,8-dibromooctane as co-additives. As a result, the PCEs of PSCs were improved from 2.74% to 6.76%, with 146.7% improvement compared with PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM without additives. The positive effect of DIO and 1,8-dibromooctane additives on the performance of PSCs should be attributed to the absorption enhancement and the increased charge carrier transport and collection.
