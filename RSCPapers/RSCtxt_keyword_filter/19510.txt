    , Accepted 26th July 2016First published on 26th July 2016AbstractWith efficiencies exceeding 20% and low production costs, lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become potential candidates for future commercial applications. However, there are serious concerns about their long-term stability and environmental friendliness, heavily related to their commercial viability. Herein, we present a theoretical investigation based on the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the effects of sunlight and moisture on the structures and properties of MAPbI3 perovskites. AIMD simulations have been performed to simulate the impact of a few water molecules on the structures of MAPbI3 surfaces terminated in three different ways. The evolution of geometric and electronic structures as well as the absorption spectra has been shown. It is found that the PbI2-terminated surface is the most stable while both the MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces undergo structural reconstruction, leading to the formation of hydrated compounds in a humid environment. The moisture-induced weakening of photoabsorption is closely related to the formation of hydrated species, and the hydrated crystals MAPbI3·H2O and MA4PbI6·2H2O scarcely absorb the visible light. The electronic excitation in the bare and water-absorbed MAPbI3 nanoparticles tends to weaken Pb–I bonds, especially those around water molecules, and the maximal decrease of photoexcitation-induced bond order can reach up to 20% in the excited state in which the water molecules are involved in the electronic excitation, indicating the accelerated decomposition of perovskites in the presence of sunlight and moisture. This work is valuable for understanding the mechanism of chemical or photochemical instability of MAPbI3 perovskites in the presence of moisture.
I. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, introduced in 2009 by Kojima et al.1 into solar cells, have attracted a great deal of attention in the field of alternative photovoltaics. PSCs have the capability to efficiently convert sunlight to electricity, and the claimed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the corresponding perovskite devices have exceeded 20%.2–8 The rapid progression of PCE raises the hope that the established technology will lead to the manufacture of highly efficient photovoltaic devices. Meanwhile, many strategies over the past few years have been proposed to avoid the toxicity of MAPbI3 by developing Pb-free PSCs.9–15 And some potential alternatives have been developed by using metal substitution.
Despite the major improvements in device efficiency and fabrication methods made over the last few years, there are still some challenges to make PSCs commercially viable and one of the most serious concerns for PSCs is their long-term stability. To increase the chemical stability of PSCs, some reports have suggested to replace methylammonium with formamidinium in iodide-based perovskites,16,17 or adding a dash of cesium to the perovskite recipes.18–20 The recent advances toward the long-term viability of PSCs have been highlighted.21–25 Although great progress on enhancing the long-term stability of PSCs has been made in recent few years, it seems that the mechanism of degradation of perovskite materials when subjected to environmental stresses such as moisture and heating cycles has not been fully understood. It is of significant importance to understand the mechanism of degradation of perovskites in detail so that more efficient strategies can be developed to prolong the lifetime of PSCs. So far, it has been found that the water-solubility of the organic constituent of the absorber material makes PSC devices highly prone to rapid degradation in moist environments.26 The origin of such moisture-related degradation is likely related to the formation of hydrated species whose formation has been found to be favored by photoexcited carriers, weakening the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and PbI6 octahedra. For example, Frost et al.27 suggested that the presence of water catalyzes the irreversible decomposition of MAPbI3 into aqueous HI, solid PbI2 and CH3NH2. Leguy et al.28 found that in the presence of water vapor the irreversible decomposition of MAPbI3 only occurs significantly once a grain has been fully converted to the monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O. Both Yang et al.29 and Christians et al.30 in their reports indicated that the hydrated intermediate constitutes a key step in the degradation of HOIPs in the humid environment. More recently, Mosconi et al.31 performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the interface between MAPbI3 and a liquid water and confirmed the formation of hydrated complexes at the atomistic scale. Besides moisture instability, it has also been shown that the embodiment of devices in which a mesoporous TiO2 layer is sensitized with the perovskite absorber exhibits UV light induced instability.32
In a number of earlier reports, PSCs employing perovskites have been shown to be stable for many hundreds of hours without any encapsulation in the dark.3,33 It seems that the PSCs aged more quickly under sunlight, which has been proved by a recent investigation.30 Most recently, Christians et al. investigated the interaction between MAPbI3 and H2O vapor by characterizing the ground-state and excited-state optical absorption properties, and probing morphology and crystal structure. Their results revealed that the moisture in the atmosphere reacts with the perovskite in both the dark and sunlight, but perovskite films undergo a faster decay under sunlight.30
While some works on perovskite hydration have been presented in the context of degradation of the material, what is still lacking is the atomic details of surface evolution of MAPbI3 when exposed to moist ambient air and sunlight. Although many theoretical works have been performed to demonstrate the microscopic reaction mechanism between water and MAPbI3,34–38 the role of photoexcitation in the instability of the material is not fully understood in the presence of moisture. To reveal the origin of such a moisture-induced weakening of photoabsorption, identification of the hydrated species and exploration of the bond-strength changes induced by electron excitation are needed; herein, we present a theoretical investigation by combining ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations with the first-principles DFT calculations. At first, we perform AIMD simulations to demonstrate the effect of moisture on the geometrical and electronic structures of MAPbI3. The evolution of MAPbI3 surface structures in the humid environment will be demonstrated. Then, based on the structures of snapshots taken from the MD trajectories and experimentally-identified crystals of MAPbI3·H2O and MA4PbI6·2H2O, we calculate the photophysical properties, and demonstrate the impacts of H2O on the electronic properties of MAPbI3 through comparison with those of perfect crystals of MAPbI3. Since the MAPbI3 perovskite becomes extremely unstable in a damp environment under light irradiation, finally, we turn our attention to the effect of photoexcitation on the structural changes to find a quantitative relationship between stability and sunlight. The stability of the material often has a close relationship with its bond order; we thus perform a Wiberg bond index analysis for the ground and excited states of bare ((MAPbI3)8) and water-absorbed ((MAPbI3)8·nH2O, n is the number of water molecules) nanoparticles to reveal the effect of both light and moisture on the decomposition of MAPbI3.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly introduces the theoretical methods and the computational details. Sections III A and III B present the evolution of geometrical and electronic structures, and the optical absorption spectra of MAPbI3 in a moisture environment, respectively. The Wiberg bond index analysis of the ground and excited states of the bare ((MAPbI3)8) and water-absorbed ((MAPbI3)8·nH2O) nanoparticles is performed in Section III C. Finally, a concluding remark is given in Section IV.
II. Models and computational details
Three different exposed surfaces of MAPbI3(001) planes, named the MAI-terminated, PbI2-defective and PbI2-terminated surfaces (see Fig. 1), were considered in this work. The MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces are obtained by removing four and one PbI2 units from the PbI2-terminated surface, respectively. The applied slab cell dimensions are a = b = 17.82 Å, corresponding to twice the optimized tetragonal cell parameters of a = b and c = 45 Å. A humid environment is considered by absorbing four water molecules on the three different terminated surfaces, respectively (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Regarding surface treatment, the bottom layer of the models is fixed and the other atoms are active.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) of a periodic cubic cell, conducted under NVT conditions, has been carried out using the CP2K package39–41 and using the hybrid Gaussian and plane waves method (GPW) implemented in the Quickstep module. The control of temperature was implemented for the ionic degrees of freedom by using Nose–Hoover thermostats.42,43 The PBE functional with the Grimme correction scheme44 to account for the dispersion interactions was adopted in our molecular dynamics. Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in a Gaussian basis set (DZVP-MOLOPT for Pb, I, C, N, O, H)45 and the norm-conserving GTH pseudopotentials.46,47 The orbital transformation method48,49 was adopted for minimization. The auxiliary plane wave basis set was defined by the energy cutoff of 300 Ry and the time step of the integration of the dynamic equations was set to 1 fs.
The periodic electronic structure calculations were carried out within the projected augmented wave (PAW) plane-wave basis implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).50–52 The atomic positions were optimized using the conjugate gradient scheme until the maximum force on each of them is less than 0.02 eV Å−1 and tolerance for energy convergence is less than 10−5 eV. An energy cutoff of 520 eV was employed. Compounds MAPbI3 perovskites with crystal symmetries Pnma and I4cm were modeled with 6 × 4 × 6 and 6 × 6 × 4 Γ-center grids for κ-point sampling, respectively. Meanwhile, the hydrates of the MAPbI3 perovskite, MA4PbI6·2H2O and MAPbI3·H2O, were modeled with 5 × 5 × 5 and 5 × 10 × 5, respectively. The hybrid DFT XC functional PBE0 combined with the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect was adopted to describe the photoelectric properties of MAPbI3 and its hydrated compound because it was found that SOC has a significant effect on the band gap of the hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite, especially on the conduction band.53 The PBE0 functional includes a fraction α, of screened, HF exchange to improve the derivative discontinuity of the Kohn–Sham potential for integer electron numbers. Here, we set α = 0.248 since the value can yield a good band gap in accord with experimental results for MAPbI3 with a tetragonal symmetry (I4cm).54 There is a consensus that the calculations with the hybrid functional are extremely expensive. Thus, the PBE functional was adopted for geometrical optimizations of all structures and the PBE0 functional with SOC was applied for the calculations of electronic and optical properties. Moreover, 2 × 2 × 1, 2 × 1 × 2 and 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-center grids were employed for the calculations of I4cm and Pnma phases and two hydrated species MA4PbI6·2H2O and MAPbI3·H2O, respectively.
The absorption spectrum was obtained by calculating the frequency dependent dielectric matrix in VASP. The imaginary part of the dielectric tensor ε(2)αβ(ω) is determined by a summation over empty states using the equation:55,56 (1)where indices c and v refer to conduction and valence band states, respectively, and uck is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point k.
To further investigate how photoexcitation affects the decomposition of MAPbI3, the bond order analysis of the ground and excited states of finite-size systems was performed. The Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) were calculated using the NBO 6.0 program57 interfaced with the Gaussian09 program58 by the semi-empirical quantum chemistry method PM6.59 In the orthonormal atomic-orbital basis set, the WBI between atoms A and B is defined as63 (2)where ρ is the total reduced one-electron density matrix in orthonormal atomic orbital basis {μ}. The MAPbI3 cluster was modeled by a neutral stoichiometric (MAPbI3)8, extracted directly from the stable I4cm configuration and optimized within the VASP package. The water-absorbed MAPbI3 clusters were represented by (MAPbI3)8·nH2O (n = 1, 2, 3). Because it is difficult to obtain the geometries of adiabatic excited states for the large size cluster, here the excitation refers to the vertical electronic excitation not the adiabatic excited state, indicating that the ground-state equilibrium conformation is adopted in the bond-order analysis of both ground and excited states.
III. Results and discussion
A. Evolution of the geometric and electronic structures of MAPbI3 when exposed to the humid environment
To get insight into the chemical instability of MAPbI3 caused by moisture, AIMD simulations are performed for the water-absorbed surfaces at a room temperature of 293 K. The total simulation time exceeds 40 ps and the radial distribution functions (RDFs) are calculated and averaged over the last 20 ps of simulations. Fig. S2(a) in the ESI† shows the RDFs of Pb–I pairs in the “sur” component of three water-absorbed surfaces. Compared with the RDFs in the PbI2-terminated surface, those in MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces are slightly broader, meaning that there are more degrees of disorders in the surface structures of water-absorbed MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces. From Fig. S2(b) in the ESI,† it is found that there are some distributions of H–O pairs in the range of 1.5 to 4 Å for MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces, and no distribution of H–O pairs is found in this range for the PbI2-terminated surface, indicating that the MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces become disordered due to the interaction with water molecules. Meanwhile, the changes in Pb–Pb distances and dihedral angles selected in three water-absorbed surfaces versus the simulated time are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† It is observed that the ranges of the fluctuation distributions of Pb–Pb distances and dihedral angles in the MAI-terminated surface are wider than those in the others, suggesting that the water-absorbed MAI-terminated surface most likely lacks chemical stability, whereas the PbI2-defective and PbI2-terminated surfaces seem to be more stable in the humid environment.
To get further information about the interaction between water molecules and MAPbI3 surfaces, we extract the snapshots from the AIMD trajectories. Fig. 2 shows that the order structure of the outmost layer in the water-absorbed MAI-terminated surface is destroyed with the time evolution, and the water molecules diffuse in a fairly wide range on the surface. Contrary to the MAI-terminated surface, the water molecules absorbed on the PbI2-defective surface stride over the PbI2-layer and reach the cavity formed between the outmost and second PbI2-layers, leading to the formation of hydrated compounds (see Fig. 2a). Our finding about the formation of hydrated compound agrees with Leguy et al.'s experimental work,28 in which they suggested that the hydrated crystal phase MAPbI3·H2O can be formed on the surface of MAPbI3 in the presence of water vapor at room temperature. However, due to the bonds formed between Pb and O, the PbI2-terminated surface seems to be stable in the presence of a few water molecules and the water molecules are localized around Pb with the time evolution (see Fig. 2c and d), which is different with Mosconi et al.'s investigation31 in which the interface between liquid water and MAPbI3 was treated, whereas in our case only a few water molecules interact with the surfaces.

We now turn our attention to the impact of water molecules on the electronic structures of MAPbI3, which are the most important properties for the performance of PSCs. In Fig. 3, we show the distributions of VBM–CBM energy gaps of the water-absorbed surfaces calculated every 10 fs along the last 20 ps simulation trajectories. The comparison is made with the bare surfaces. The calculated energy gaps fluctuate around 1.879, 1.648 and 1.578 eV for the water-absorbed MAI-terminated, PbI2-defective and PbI2-terminated surfaces, corresponding to the standard deviations of 0.210, 0.128 and 0.094 eV, respectively (see Fig. 3). Compared with those of bare surfaces, it is clear that due to the strong surface reconstruction induced by water molecules, the energy gaps of water-absorbed MAI-terminated surfaces are distributed in the wider range, however their average energy gap is nearly equal to that of the bare surface. The VBM and CBM are not dominantly contributed by the states of the outmost layers. However, the average energy gap shifts from 1.573 to 1.648 eV with the impact of water for the PbI2-defective surface and the standard deviation of the distribution is nearly equal to that of the bare surface (standard deviation of 0.134 eV). Similar to the PbI2-defective surface, the average energy gap of the PbI2-terminated surface also shifts to 1.578 eV and the range of distribution is not affected by water molecules. Since the dominant contribution of the VBM comes from the outermost layers for PbI2-defective and PbI2-terminated surfaces and the charge transfer induced by the water molecules adsorbed on the surfaces, the valence band of the surfaces is down-shifted, resulting in the wider band gaps, which had been reported in the previous work.31
 Fig. 3  The energy-gap distributions of three water-absorbed surfaces (blue lines) for the last 20 ps of simulations at 293 K. The comparison is made with those of bare surfaces (black lines). The lines are the best fit using the normal distribution. 
To get more information about the electronic structures, we plot the partial density of states (PDOSs) of three surfaces for the snapshot at 40 ps (see Fig. 4). It is found that all the PDOSs curves are similar. Since the surface structures are retained, the PDOS of water-absorbed PbI2-terminated surface is similar to that of the bare surface. In the water-absorbed MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces, surface reconstruction gives rise to shallow surface states, which may trap the photogenerated holes. Fortunately, the surface states only localize around the VBM and do not intrude in the band gap of MAPbI3, implying that MAPbI3 has an intrinsic property of defect tolerance and is an ideal material for fabrication of solar cells.

B. Evolution of the absorption spectra of MAPbI3 when exposed to a moisture environment
The interacted water molecules change the geometric and electronic structures of MAPbI3 and will definitely influence the optical properties of the material. Here we thus calculate the absorption spectra with respect to the structures of the snapshots taken from MD trajectories, and the experimentally-identified hydrated crystals MAPbI3·H2O and MA4PbI6·2H2O. Based on the experimental works and our AIMD simulations noted above, hydrated crystal phases MAPbI3·H2O28 and MA4PbI6·2H2O60 can be formed when MAPbI3 is exposed to humid air. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of a few snapshots taken from MD simulation. The details about the evolution of geometries and spectra are shown in Fig. S4–S6 in the ESI.† At the beginning of the simulation, the initial slab shows a similar light response to the bulk phase. With the evolution of the simulation time, perovskite structures change obviously since water molecules penetrate into the internal slabs of the MAI-terminated and PbI2-defective surfaces, and the absorption under visible light decreases dramatically, especially the absorption around 550 nm. However, the situation is slightly different on the water-absorbed PbI2-terminated surface. At the very beginning, the absorption decreases dramatically, and then it remains stable as time evolves, indicating that the PbI2-terminated surface is relatively stable. Since the three kinds of different terminated surfaces may exist in the MAPbI3 perovskite, overall the absorption of perovskite decreases in the visible-light region when it is exposed to the humid environment. The evolution of absorption as the simulation of time indicates that the interacted water molecules gradually destroy the structures of perovskite and subsequently reduce the performance of PSC devices, in good agreement with Kamat's group's experimental observation61 that the absorption of perovskite decreases as the exposure time to the damp environment gets longer and longer in the dark.
 Fig. 5  The evolution of absorption spectra of water-absorbed PbI2-defective (a), MAI-terminated (b) and PbI2-terminated surfaces (c) with the simulated time. 
We also study the properties of hydrated products MAPbI3·H2O and MA4PbI6·2H2O. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. The optical absorption curves of I4cm- and Pnma-phase perovskites are also shown in Fig. 6b for comparison. The two different phases of MAPbI3 have a similar light response though there are slight differences in peak locations. Compared with the optical gap of MAPbI3, those of MA4PbI6·2H2O and MAPbI3·H2O increase largely, reaching 3.8 and 3.5 eV, respectively. For example, MA4PbI6·2H2O begins to absorb the light when the photon energy is larger than 3.8 eV, indicating that it hardly absorbs visible light. Hence, the compounds MA4PbI6·2H2O and MAPbI3·H2O need to be avoided for enhancing the performance of PSCs. Analogous to MAPbI3, VBMs of MA4PbI6·2H2O and MAPbI3·H2O possess the characteristics of I atoms, whereas CBMs have the characteristics of Pb and I atoms. In the presence of H2O, the photon-induced charge-transfer channels, Pb–I–Pb, are destroyed, leading to the degradation of MAPbI3 perovskites.

C. WBI analysis of the ground and excited states of (MAPbI3)8·nH2O and (MAPbI3)8 nanoparticles
The MAPbI3 perovskite becomes extremely unstable in a damp environment under light irradiation. Sunlight seems to accelerate the degradation of the MAPbI3 perovskite as proposed by Wang's group.62 Finally, we thus turn our attention to the effect of photoexcitation on the structural changes to find a quantitative relationship between stability and sunlight. Since the stability of a material often has a close relationship with its bond order, we thus analyse the changes in bond order induced by electronic excitation. The Wiberg bond indices of nanoclusters (MAPbI)8 and (MAPbI)8·nH2O (see Fig. 8) have been calculated.
 Fig. 8  MAPbI3 cluster and MAPbI3 hydrates with 1, 2, 3 water molecules attached (front and top views). The green, blue and red balls denote the Pb, I and O atoms, respectively. 
For the (MAPbI3)8 nanocluster, there were three strong absorption peaks centered at 309, 374 and 386 nm as shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI.† When a few water molecules are attached to the surface of (MAPbI3)8, the intensities of those main absorption peaks in the higher energy region slightly decrease. Similar phenomena have been theoretically and experimentally observed in the absorption spectra of bulk systems in the presence of water molecules as addressed above.
The bond orders of ground and excited states for the (MAPbI3)8 and (MAPbI3)8·H2O clusters have been listed in Table 1, and those of (MAPbI3)8·2H2O and (MAPbI3)8·3H2O are shown in Tables S2 and S3 in the ESI.† From the results of (MAPbI3)8, we observe that the bond strengths of some Pb–I bonds in the excited states are weaker than those in the ground state, which indicates that electronic excitation weakens the strength of Pb–I bonds. Meanwhile, we observe that when the water molecules are attached to (MAPbI3)8, the bond strengths of all the Pb–I bonds around the water molecules are further decreased by electronic excitation, especially those in the excited states in which the water molecules get involved in electronic excitation (see the properties of excited states shown in Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†), which indicates that the humidity is a key factor affecting the material's instability, and it tends to degrade MAPbI3 through Pb–I bond breaking. Based on these results, we conclude that the MAPbI3 perovskite suffers from the photochemical degradation to PbI2 due to the Pb–I bond weakening when exposed to humid air under light irradiation. Our calculation provides a theoretical insight into the mechanism of photochemical degradation of MAPbI3.

IV. Concluding remarks
In conclusion, we have combined AIMD simulations and first-principles DFT calculations to investigate the geometric and electronic structures of MAPbI3 perovskite material under the interaction of water molecules and light illumination. The evolution of geometric and electronic structures of different terminated MAPbI3 surfaces under the impact of water molecules, the photophysical properties of the snapshots taken from MD simulations and experimentally-identified hydrated species as well as the changes of electronic excitation-induced Pb–I bond strength for the bare and water-absorbed MAPbI3 nanoparticles have been demonstrated. The following conclusions can be reached.
(1) The interaction of water molecules with MAPbI3 surfaces induces surface reconstruction and the formation of hydrated compounds. In a humid environment, the MAI-terminated surface is decomposed, and the hydrated product MAPbI3·H2O is formed on the PbI2-defective surface, in agreement with the previous work.31 Conversely, the PbI2-terminated surface is the most stable surface and retains the fundamental structure of the surface with the evolution of simulation time. The band gaps of water-absorbed surfaces show fluctuation with time evolution due to thermal motion. The band alignments induced by the thermal motions seem to accelerate the separation of holes and electrons. There are no obvious defective states intruding in the band gaps that undergo the process of reconstruction induced by water molecules and only a few defective states are found around the VBM, which suggests that the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have an intrinsic property of defect tolerance and are ideal materials for fabrication of solar cells.
(2) The experimentally-observed moisture-induced weakening of photoabsorption is related to the formation of hydrated species, whose formation causes a dramatic decrease in the intensity of optical absorption in the visible region, and the hydrated crystals MAPbI3·H2O and MA4PbI6·2H2O scarcely absorb the visible light because the photo-induced charge transfer channels, Pb–I–Pb, are ruined in the presence of water molecules, which accounts for the observed degradation of the MAPbI3 perovskite.
(3) The electronic excitation tends to weaken Pb–I bonds, especially those around water molecules and in the excited states in which water molecules are involved in electronic excitation. The decrease in the observed large bond strength of Pb–I bonds around water molecules induced by electronic excitation explains the experimental observation that hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are more easily degraded in humid air when exposed to sunlight.
Through the above analysis, it is obvious that humidity is a crucial factor determining the stability of PSCs. To increase the stability of this class of materials, the development of inexpensive encapsulation techniques and water-proof perovskite materials is required. It is observed that the stability of PSCs can be improved by introducing 2D perovskite absorbers in solar cells, as suggested by Karunadasa.64
