    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractIn this work, three dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol fused-ring electron acceptors (IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F) have been successfully developed as efficient asymmetric nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). The molecular conformation of these NFAs can be subtly tuned by extending the donating cores with thiophene rings. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate the crucial role of the conformation change in asymmetric NFAs played in the aggregation of their blend films with PBDB-T. Indeed, the blend films with S-shaped IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F reveal less trap-assisted recombination and better microphase separation compared with C-shaped IPTT-2F. Decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 14% and 12.3% were achieved for IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based OSCs, respectively. Our results indicate the S-shaped conformation of asymmetric NFAs locked via S⋯O interactions is advantageous to fine-tune the morphology in the active layer for more efficient OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown ever-increasing potential for solar energy harvesting because of their evident advantages of light weight, flexibility, transparency and low-cost fabrication.1–4 With the great development of polymer donors, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) and device technology, OSCs have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15% and 16% in single-junction binary and ternary devices, respectively.5–9 Especially, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) adopting an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have triggered rapid progress and surpassed fullerene-based acceptors, owing to their enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) to promote light absorption and electron mobility, suitable intermolecular stacking and aggregation to optimize the morphology of blends with donors, and better solution processability.10,11 For molecular engineering of NFAs, most strategies focus on the fused donating core by adding or removing the same aromatic rings on both sides to form a symmetric structure. The classic ITIC or INIC series FREAs have been designed with conjugation extending on both sides of the indacenodithiophene (IDT) core by fusing thiophene (T) or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units.12–16 To maintain the symmetry, two same electron-donating units are exploited to flank the core on both sides.17–19 For more precise regulation of FREAs' properties, asymmetric NFAs have been proposed as a subtle modification by changing only one side of the D core. Importantly, the asymmetry is found to induce a larger dipole moment in NFAs, leading to enhanced ICT and stronger intermolecular binding energy.20 Under the actuation and induction of the dipole moment, asymmetric NFAs can thus reinforce the molecular interactions to form a compact and well-organized intermolecular stacking.21 As such, asymmetric FREAs have been designed and synthesized by flanking one side of D cores with an electron-donating unit such as T, TT, and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (TTT).22–27 The as-designed asymmetric NFAs have enabled high PCEs (10–13%) and fill factor (FF) (70–79%) in OSCs.22–27
Recently, our group have successfully explored dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol (DTP) as a good donating block28,29 to construct indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) (INP) based FREAs.30–32 The conjugation of occupied p orbitals of N and S heteroatoms with p orbitals of aromatic rings offers DTP with strong electron-donating capability, while electron-rich N atoms help to narrow down the bandgap and act as ideal sites for sidechain engineering.30,32 The INP-cored symmetric FREA (INPIC-4F) featuring a 1.39 eV bandgap delivered 13.13% PCE and 71.5% FF when blended with PBDB-T as a polymer donor.30–32 The single-junction devices were further optimized by using an asymmetric NFA (MeIC1) as the third component in ternary OSCs. An impressive PCE of 13.73% was achieved by matching absorption and photovoltaic parameters for the corresponding two binary OSCs.33 However, the crystallization of INPIC-4F needed to be decreased by casting the blend films from hot substrates or binary solvents to encourage suitable π–π stacking,34,35 which is challenging for large-scale solution processing of OSCs. To address this, we have thus designed asymmetric FREAs by replacing the DTP on one side of the INP core with a smaller and weaker electron-donating unit including T, TT, and TTT, which are designated as IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F, respectively (Scheme 1). To match the weakened donating core, only a single fluorinated 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) accepting terminal was adopted for the asymmetric FREAs. The consequence of breaking asymmetry in the fused donating core intrigues us to explore the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the resultant FREAs.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route to our designed asymmetric FREAs is shown in Scheme 1a. The asymmetric D cores (IPT, IPTT, and IPTTT) by flanking indeno(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol) with T, TT or TTT units were constructed with a two-step approach involving Stille coupling and Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization. The subsequent Vilsmeier reaction afforded the corresponding di-aldehydes in ∼88% yields. The targets IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F were finally synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation between di-aldehydes and 2-(5/6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-F). The optimized condensation must be conducted under the catalysis of β-alanine at 50–60 °C to realize higher yields (>80%). The synthetic details and characterization data are presented in the ESI (Scheme S1, Fig. S1–S30, ESI†). Three NFAs have good solubility in common solvents and thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) of over 330 °C (corresponding to 5% weight loss in thermogravimetric analysis, Fig. S31a, ESI†).
Three asymmetric FREAs exhibit different molecular conformations due to the flanking of different thiophene fused rings in the central core (Scheme 1b). It's known that the S atoms from thiophene ends in IPT (or IPTT, IPTT) cores can form noncovalent interactions with O atoms from IC-F.36–38 These weak intramolecular S⋯O “conformational locks” afford a planar structure to promote π–π stacking and molecular packing in the solid state. A C-shaped conformation is observed for IPTT-2F, where two IC-F end groups aren't parallelly aligned on the same side of the IPTT core axis. Importantly, IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F adopt an S-shaped conformation due to the parallel alignment of IC-F terminals. To further understand and confirm the preferred S-shaped or C-shaped conformation, we simulated the molecular surface electrostatic potential of the three acceptors with Multiwfn39,40 and VMD. As shown in Fig. 1, the negative electrostatic potentials of O atoms diffuse and penetrate to the surface of S atoms. Moreover, the van der Waals mutual penetration distance (d) (O⋯S) was calculated as the difference between the sum of non-bonded atomic radii and the actual distance of O⋯S. The d values (O⋯S) of the three acceptors are all over 1 Å together with the electrostatic potential diffusion, which indicates the existence of considerably weak interactions.41,42 Relaxed potential surface energy scans were further studied to understand the conformation energy of IPT-2F, IPTT-2F and IPTTT-2F. There are four potential rotamers in the acceptors, called DTP-ICF, T-ICF, TT-ICF and TTT-ICF, respectively (Fig. 1). The energy values of the rotamers in the acceptors at a torsion angle of 180° are all greater than those at 0° because of the steric hindrance effect of H atoms. These results confirm the stable and preferred S-shaped for IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F as well as C-shaped for IPTT-2F.

The optical spectra of the three NFAs are plotted in Fig. 2a, with characteristic data listed in Table 1. In chloroform solution, slightly redshifted absorptions along with an enhanced molar extinction coefficient are observed with the extension of π-conjugation to induce an intensified electron-donating ability from IPT to IPTT and IPTTT. Comparably, IPT-2F bearing the weakest donating core exhibits the largest red-shift (ca. 36 nm) in the maximum absorption peak from solution to films. This result is evidence for a more well-aligned and compact intermolecular stacking of IPT-2F molecules in the solid state. It is believed that extending π-conjugation with electron-donating units in a weaker fused D core commonly can narrow the optical bandgap (Eoptg), and expectantly increases the JSC. Song et al.22 successfully exploited asymmetric NFAs of TPT-2F, TPTT-2F, and TPTTT-2F with an obviously enhanced D core in sequence. Red-shifted film absorption effectively increased the JSC, providing space for PCE improvement. In this regard, the conformation reversals of the acceptors leading to transformations of molecular packing and aggregation shouldn't become a restricted factor for PCE enhancement. We hypothesized that the DTP unit is such a strong electron-donating block that our asymmetric NFAs show unchanged optical absorption in the film state, which even blue-shifted with the extension of π-conjugation from IPT-2F to IPTT-2F and IPTTT-2F. Similar results have been found for FREAs by extending the D core on the opposite side of TTT, which is used as the strong and dominant donor block. The resultant NFAs exhibit almost unchanged optical absorption when the flanking donating unit is changed from T to TT and TTT on the other side (Table S1 and the references inside, ESI†). For asymmetric FREAs bearing the same number of fused rings in the central core, our DTP-extended NFAs exhibit ∼50 nm red-shifted absorption compared to the corresponding TTT-extended ones,22 indicating effective bandgap narrowing for the DTP unit.29 The extended absorption can be attributed to the more intense ICT effect generated by the replacement of one thiophene ring in TTT with a pyrrole ring in DTP.

The energy level diagram of the three FREAs is shown in Fig. 2b, with cyclic voltammetry traces plotted in Fig. S31b (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels are calculated from ionization potentials and electron affinities and calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F show an elevation along with the extension of π-conjugation, while the LUMO energy levels show a down-shifting trend. The relatively subtle variations of the LUMO level do not correlate completely with the empirical rule that LUMO lifts when stronger electron-donating cores are used. Interestingly, the VOC values of the devices (presented below) show a gradual increase from IPT-2F, IPTT-2F to IPTTT-2F. A similar case is also found in asymmetric FREAs of TPTTT-2F and TTPTTT-2F.22,43 We consider that these phenomena are special properties, which are presented when asymmetric core extensions are conducted in the cores containing strong and dominant donor blocks such as DTP or TTT. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis shows that only IPT-2F has an obvious crystallization temperature (Tc) of 205.2 °C with a melting temperature (Tm) of 211.4 °C (Fig. S31c†). The result indicates that a shorter π-conjugation length of IPT-2F makes molecular relaxation easier. With larger donating cores, the rigid IPTT-2F and IPTTT-2F can't enjoy molecular relaxation and movement even when heated up to their decomposition temperatures. The particular molecular relaxation of IPT-2F may be a reason of the higher FF and JSC as discussed below.
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the asymmetric NFAs, OSCs were constructed with a conventional architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:acceptors/Phen-NaDPO/Ag.44 Optimum active layers were obtained by spin coating the PBDB-T:acceptor (1:1, w/w) blend solution in chlorobenzene (CB) with 0.5% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane as the solvent additive, followed by a thermal annealing step at 100 °C for 10 min. The optimization data of the devices are summarized in Tables S2–S4 (ESI†). Impressively, a champion PCE of 14.0% with a VOC of 860 mV and a JSC of 22.4 mA cm−2 along with a FF of 72.4% was obtained for the IPT-2F-based OSCs. A moderate PCE of 12.3% and a lower PCE of 11.4% were achieved for the IPTTT-2F- and IPTT-2F-based OSCs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, 14% PCE is by far the highest PCE value for binary OSCs with asymmetric FREAs (Table S5, ESI†). In comparison to literature-reported best FREAs bearing asymmetric D cores such as a-BTTIC,26 TPTTT-2F,22 and SePTTT-2F,27 our IPT-2F exhibits better PCE when blended with PBDB-T or its analogous polymer donors, which is largely attributed to its significantly higher JSC. This may indicate the advantage of incorporating a pyrrole unit inside the fused D core to induce an intense ICT effect. When compared with DTP-based FREAs (Table S6, ESI†), one can find that IPT-2F outperforms its symmetric counterparts with higher high JSC and FF values.
A close look at the photovoltaic parameters of our asymmetric FREAs indicates that the IPT-2F-based OSCs exhibited the highest JSC and FF. It's known that the JSC can be boosted by broadening the photoresponse range of the FREAs,22 which agrees well with the absorption results of IPT-2F in Fig. 2. The high JSC value may also be attributed to the crystalline nature of IPT-2F. The higher FF values of IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based OSCs are indicators of a better blend morphology formed in these S-shaped FREA blend systems. The low PCE along with an undesirable FF of 66.2% for the IPTT-2F-based OSCs was probably a result of heterogeneous blend aggregation induced by disadvantageous C-shaped conformation. We also investigated the storage stability under nitrogen conditions (Fig. S32, ESI†). IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based optimized OSCs retained 91% of their initial efficiency after 72 hours. In contrast, a lower PCE retention of 88% was observed for the IPTT-2F-based optimized devices under the same conditions. It is thus evident that the photovoltaic parameters and storage stability of asymmetric FREA based OSCs have direct relevance to their conformation tuning.
The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3a, with the key photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2. Compared with IPTT-2F and IPTTT-2F, the IPT-2F based OSCs yielded a slightly reduced VOC but dramatically increased JSC. As shown in Fig. 3b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three FREA based OSCs exhibited strong photoresponse across the whole spectral range, and a maximum EQE value of 82% is observed for the IPT-2F-based OSCs at 810 nm. The integrated JSC values of IPT-2F-, IPTT-2F-, and IPTTT-2F-based OSCs are 21.2, 19.0, and 19.2 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the JSC values obtained in the J–V measurements (within 5% mismatch).

To investigate the influence of the conformation reversal on the charge transport properties of the three asymmetric FREA based blend films, we obtained the electron/hole mobilities (μe/μh) with space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. The μe/μh of PBDB-T blend films with IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F is 3.26 × 10−4/3.17 × 10−4, 3.31 × 10−4/3.96 × 10−4, and 4.48 × 10−4/4.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to a μe/μh value of 1.03, 0.84, and 0.96, respectively (Fig. S33, ESI†). Both μe and μh are enhanced with the extension of π-conjugation. However, the JSC does not follow this tendency in OSCs. Even so, the μe/μh values of blend films based on S-shaped IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F are more balanced than those of the C-shaped IPTT-2F blend film. A balanced μe/μh value serves to yield high JSC and FF. A similar phenomenon can be found when comparing C-shaped TTPTTT-2F43 with S-shaped TPTTT-2F,22 where the latter shows lower charge mobilities but a more balanced μe/μh value to yield higher JSC and PCE in OSCs.
The effect of bimolecular recombination behaviour on current extraction can be described as JSC ∝ PS.45,46 A linear relationship between JSC and P (light intensity) represents a slope (S) equal to 1, which indicates an excellent ability of charge extraction. The devices based on IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F all have an approximate S of 0.99, which means that bimolecular recombination is not a key defect for the OSC performance (Fig. 3c). The trap-assisted recombination behaviours obtained from VOCversus light intensity have obvious pertinence to the conformation reversals. IPTT-2F-based OSCs feature a slope of 1.54 kT q−1, whereas we find smaller slopes of 1.34 and 1.42 kT q−1 for IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based OSCs, respectively (Fig. 3d). The smaller slopes for the S-shaped NFAs are indicative of less trap-assisted recombination,47 which means that the trap state in the active layer does less damage to the charge carrier, and thus conduces to a higher level of FF and JSC.48
GIWAXS was performed to investigate the aggregation behaviours of PBDB-T and the three acceptors in neat and blend films (Fig. S34 in the ESI,†Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. S34,† the neat films of IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F present (010) peaks at 1.8 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, and the C-shaped IPTT-2F shows a slightly enhanced (010) π–π stacking peak. However, in the in-plane (IP) direction, S-shaped IPT-2F and IPTTT-2F exhibit quite obvious (100) lamellar stacking at qr = 0.33 and 0.31 Å−1, corresponding to a similar separation distance of 1.9 and 2.0 nm via d = 2π/q, respectively. Meanwhile, the (100) lamellar stacking for C-shaped IPTT-2F obtains a lower qr of 0.25 Å−1 with a large separation distance of 2.5 nm, which represents an incompact lamellar stacking for the face-on packing structure. All three blend films have the (010) peak at approximately 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the (100) peak at 0.29 Å−1 in the IP direction. The obviously enhanced face-on π–π stacking of the blend system relative to the corresponding pure film, especially for the S-shaped IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based blends, can be attributed to the effective synergy coming from both the polymer donor and S-shaped NFAs. In general, the more well-organized and compact packing structure can be responsible for the less trap-assisted recombination and higher FF values in IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based devices. To understand the mesoscale morphology of these blend films, resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) with 284.8 eV photon energy is used to compare their compositional domain characteristics (Fig. 4c). A quite strong and broad scattering profile is presented by the PBDB-T:IPTT-2F blend film. And a scattering hump at ∼0.0055 A−1 is seen, which means that the average length-scale phase separation is 114 nm. Furthermore, the broad scattering profile represents a wide distribution of length-scale phase separation, which indicates the heterogeneity of the domain size. Yet the scattering profiles of PBDB-T:IPT-2F and PBDB-T:IPTTT-2F blends all show a weak but narrow peak with a scattering hump at ∼0.007 A−1 corresponding to a relatively small length-scale phase separation of 90 nm. These results indicate that the C-shaped IPTT-2F-based blend has an enhanced domain size and domain purity, but heterogeneous and large domain separation, thus leading to detrimental charge recombination. In contrast, S-shaped IPT-2F- and IPTT-2F-based blends obtain the best morphology with an appropriate domain size and uniformity, thus enabling the devices to achieve higher FF and JSC. In addition, compared to the IPTTT-2F-based blend, the PBDB-T:IPT-2F blend shows a preferred face-on orientation with a stronger π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction and a lamellar stacking peak in the IP direction according to the GIWAXS patterns and line cuts. The more dominant face-on orientation is more favourable for charge transport between the top and bottom electrodes of devices, which can explain the better performance of IPT-2F-based devices.

To intuitively understand the influence of molecular conformation on device performance, the morphology characteristics of the blend films were mapped by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 5, the blend films based on IPT-2F, IPTT-2F, and IPTTT-2F all have a small root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) value obtained from the respective height image. The PBDB-T:IPT-2F blend film assembled an order textures of long nanofibrils, thus benefiting exciton dissociation and charge transport in the active layer.49,50 The blend film of PBDB-T:IPTTT-2F formed a non-fibrous but ordered and homogeneous microphase separation on a small length scale, which is a suboptimal morphology for device performance. In sharp contrast to the morphologies above, the blend film based on C-shaped IPTT-2F presents an irregular macrophase separation and an unordered phase arrangement that make the blend lack enough channels for charge transport and generate large recombination losses.51 The TEM images show that IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based blends possess a relatively more fine structure of phase separation, while the IPTT-2F-based blend shows a heterogeneous morphology (Fig. S35 in the ESI†), which are consistent with the AFM and R-SoXS tests. The morphology results readily explain the significantly higher JSC and FF obtained for IPT-2F- and IPTTT-2F-based OSCs, i.e., appropriate NFA conformation tunes intermolecular interactions and aggregations in bulk heterojunction blends to promote the formation of a nanofibril morphology and thus better charge transport/separation. All experimental and simulation data agree well with the finding that molecular conformation tuning of asymmetric FREAs can induce better molecular packing, blend morphology and thus photovoltaic performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, for the first time we have introduced the concept of tuning the confirmation of asymmetric nonfullerene acceptors by developing dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol fused 7-, 8- and 9-ring structured electronic acceptors. The intermolecular weak S⋯O interactions induce molecular confirmation reversal when gradually extending the fused-ring core with the thiophene unit. The S-shaped NFAs with accepting terminals aligning in parallel along the core axis exhibit improved molecular packing in the solid state. Evident molecular conformation affecting the photovoltaic performance has been demonstrated in OSCs by blending DTP-based asymmetric NFAs with PBDB-T as a polymer donor. Importantly, PBDB-T blends with either IPT-2F or IPTTT-2F featuring S-shaped conformation exhibit a perfect nanofibril morphology with homogeneous and regular phase separation, while a heterogeneous blend phase structure was detected for C-shaped IPTT-2F. Impressively, IPT-2F-based binary OSCs exhibit a maximum PCE of 14% with a high JSC of 22.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 72.4%. These values, to the best of our knowledge, are among the highest ones for asymmetric NFA based devices. The enhanced performance is attributed to more balanced charge transport and reduced trap-assisted recombination in the devices. Our results indicate that conformation tuning to reinforce intermolecular interactions may open a new avenue for FREA design in pursuit of high-performance OSCs.
4. Experimental
4.1 Synthesis of IPT-2F
