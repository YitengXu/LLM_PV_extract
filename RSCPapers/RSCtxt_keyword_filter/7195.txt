    , Accepted 25th November 2016First published on 28th November 2016AbstractWe herein demonstrate novel inorganic–organic hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) composed of inorganic NPs, NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4, and an organic β-diketonate complex, Eu(TTA)3Phen, for energy harvesting applications. Both the systems maintain their core integrity and remain entangled through weak interacting forces. HNPs incorporate the characteristic optical behaviour of both the systems i.e. they give an intense red emission under UV excitation, due to Eu3+ in organic complexes, and efficient green upconversion emission of Er3+ in inorganic NPs for NIR (980 nm) excitation. However, (i) an energy transfer from Er3+ (inorganic NPs) to Eu3+ (organic complex) under NIR excitation, and (ii) an increase in the decay time of 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ for HNPs as compared to the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex, under different excitation wavelengths, are added optical characteristics which point to an important role of the interface between both the systems. Herein, the ultra-small size (6–9 nm) and spherical shape of the inorganic NPs offer a large surface area, which improves the weak interaction force between both the systems. Furthermore, the HNPs dispersed in the PMMA polymer have been successfully utilized for luminescent solar collector (LSC) applications.
1 Introduction
Luminescent materials doped with lanthanide ions have been broadly considered for a wide range of applications e.g. for solid state lighting,1,2 display panels,1,2 bio-imaging,3,4 luminescent solar collectors (LSCs),4–7etc. The ladder-like energy levels of lanthanides facilitate flexibility of photon absorption in a wide spectral region, energy transfer, cross relaxations, etc. in many ways.8,9 Therefore, lanthanides can emit through various processes, namely downshifting (DS), upconversion (UC) and downconversion (DC), which is unique in the sense that there is no other known activator/fluorophore which could emit through all the aforementioned multi-emission forms.8–10 Furthermore, lanthanide-based materials could be synthesized in solid (e.g. phosphor, organic complexes, hybrids, etc.) as well as liquid (nano-colloids) forms, which makes them indispensable for multifunctional applications.
Specifically, trivalent lanthanide ion (Ln3+) doped hosts are a promising class of materials for addressing the essential challenges in the LSC design.5–13 A major issue with photovoltaic (PV) cells, particularly silicon solar cells, is their poor conversion efficiency for ultraviolet and infrared parts of the solar spectrum. Ln3+ could convert both ultraviolet and near infrared light into visible light effectively by going through DS, DC and UC processes. In this context, more than one process of emission, for instance DS and UC, working together, could be more effective as far as LSC application is concerned. However, efficient materials displaying both DS and UC properties are much less investigated. This is because of the fact that it is technically hard to design an efficient lanthanide doped material, which could emit in the visible region viably through both DS and UC processes.
In point of fact, the effective emission through the UC process demands strictly a low phonon energy host.14 In this context, fluoride and chalcogenide hosts (crystals or glasses) are indeed attractive hosts.15–17 Specifically noteworthy are the NaYF4:Ln3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with the highest quantum yield reported so far.18,19 The best known lanthanides (Ln3+) for near infrared to visible UC emission are Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ when co-doped with Yb3+ ions.18–22 However, the host absorption band for most of the fluoride based hosts falls outside the AM 1.5G (Air Mass 1.5 is the standard spectrum of Sun at the Earth's surface with 100 W m−2 power, here G stands for global and includes both direct and diffuse radiations23) spectral range. While, on the other hand, lanthanides face problems of low absorption cross-sections. Therefore, this host–activator combination is not ideal for DS luminescence, particularly for the conversion of UV light into visible light for LSC applications.
In this context, lanthanide-based organic complexes (lanthanide β-diketonate) are better frameworks.24,25 In such complexes, Ln3+ ions remain usually coordinated to organic ligands, which enhances the absorption cross-section for intrinsic f–f transition. Organic materials act as antennas to absorb the ultraviolet light. The absorbed light is further transferred to the central lanthanide ion which gives efficient emission.26,27 These are regarded better candidates for application in LSCs due to their large Stokes shift (>200 nm) compared to those of organic dyes and QDs26,27 and significantly high quantum yield. The highest quantum yield value ever reported is for Eu3+ diketonate complexes.24,25 However, if one looks for the possibility of UC in such organic complexes, it is rare due to high energy vibrational modes of organic structures.
Thus, it is unlikely that a single organic or inorganic material can fulfil the need of getting emission through both UC and DC. One way to cope with the above challenge is by the use of a Ln3+-containing hybrid of inorganic UCNPs and organic complexes. The extraordinary optical property of both the materials would remain present in the hybrid structure. In such hybrids, weak interacting forces, e.g. van der Waals forces, play an important role in entangling both the systems. Such forces primarily depend on the distance between two interacting entities and their orientation. Ultrafine spherical NPs (diameter ≤10 nm), bearing a high surface to volume ratio, would lead to a better interaction with the organic counterpart. Thus, innovation lies in the control of the shape and size of the inorganic particles that would yield the functionality, property, or foreseen applications required.
This study put forward a design of the hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs hereafter) composed of inorganic upconversion NPs (NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4, particle size <10 nm, UCNPs hereafter) and Eu(TTA)3Phen organic complexes (ETP hereafter). Material efficiently emits in green and red regions on near infrared and UV excitation, respectively. The energy transfer between lanthanide ions of two different systems (Er3+ in inorganic UCNPs and Eu3+ in organic complexes) is unique. This points out that, the optical property of the organic–inorganic hybrid material is not merely the sum of the individual contributions of both organic and inorganic systems; but their inner interfaces also play an important role. Furthermore, the figure of merit of PV cell performance of the hybrid material is also quantified by measuring current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, after placing a thin layer of HNPs (embedded in a polymer matrix) on the front surface of the crystalline silicon cell. The study affirms that UV as well as white light is effectively harvested by the synthesized HNPs and could be used for LSC design.
2 Experimental methods
2.1. Materials
Europium(III) oxide (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), erbium oxide (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), ytterbium oxide (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), yttrium oxide (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), 1-octadecene (ODE, Alfa Aesar), 2-theonyltrifluoroacetone (99.5%, Otto Kemi), 1,10-phenanthroline (99.5%, Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd), NH4F (95%, Molychem), ethanol (Merck), sodium hydroxide (Qualigens, 99%), and PMMA (Himedia). Oleic acid (OA), hydrochloric acid, methanol, acetone, cyclohexane and diethyl ether were purchased from Fisher Scientific. These materials were used without further processing and purification.
2.2. Synthesis

2.2.1 Synthesis of UCNPs, NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4. 
The procedure for the synthesis of UCNPs is given in detail in our earlier work.28 Stoichiometric amounts of all rare-earth oxides are dissolved in a minimal amount of hydrochloric acid to obtain rare-earth chlorides. In the next step, the rare-earth chlorides are added into a three neck flask containing 55 mL of a solution of OA (15 mL) and ODE (40 mL). The mixture is then heated at 150 °C for 1 h under constant stirring to obtain oleate complexes. The solution is then allowed to cool to room temperature. A solution of stoichiometric amounts of NaOH and NH4F in methanol (20 mL) is prepared separately and added dropwise to the first one. The mixture is then heated at 80 °C to evaporate the methanol content. After complete evaporation of methanol, the flask is purged with N2 to remove any oxygen and the solution is then again heated at 250 °C under a gentle flow of N2. The solution is maintained at the same temperature for 1.5 h and finally cooled to room temperature. The NPs are collected by centrifugation and washed several times using ethanol. The material is dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the oleate capping on the NPs is removed by HCl treatment at pH 4.29


2.2.2 Synthesis of the organic complex, Eu(TTA)3Phen. 
A solution of EuCl3·6H2O (2 mmol) is prepared in 10 mL of distilled water (solution A). Another solution of 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (6 mmol), 1,10-phenanthroline (2 mmol) and 8 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide in 25 mL of ethanol (solution B) is prepared. In the next step, solution A is added into solution B dropwise under constant stirring. During this process, a white precipitate of the ETP complex is formed. The complex was purified by addition of ethanol and dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h.


2.2.3 Synthesis of hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs). 
In order to prepare a hybrid of inorganic UCNPs (NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4) and the organic complex ETP (Eu(TTA)3Phen), initially, a dispersion of the ETP complex in cyclohexane is prepared (colloidal suspension). Then, finally, UCNPs (200 mg) are dispersed in the colloidal suspension of the complex (0.02 M) in cyclohexane. Furthermore, the mixture is stirred vigorously for about 2–3 h and kept in an ultrasonic bath for about 1 h. Finally, the HNPs are collected using an ultracentrifuge and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. Fig. 1 shows a representative diagram of the formation of hybrid nanostructures.

2.3 Instrumentation
Phase identification of the prepared samples has been carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (model: Miniflex-II, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured using an FEI, Tecnai G2, S-Twin instrument operating at 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were performed in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 using a Spectrum-65 spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The absorption spectra were recorded using a Lambda-35 (Perkin Elmer) based UV-visible spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE), emission (PL) and decay time measurements were performed using a PL spectrometer (model: FL3-11, Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a 450 W CW lamp and a 25 W pulsed lamp. For the UC luminescence measurements, the 980 nm radiation from a diode laser (continuous mode, 2 W, power tunable) was used as the excitation source and a dispersive monochromator (model: iHR320, Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (model no. 1424M) was used as the detector. For the decay time measurements under the 980 nm excitation, the laser line was chopped by a mechanical chopper and the data were acquired using an oscilloscope (analog digital scope-HM1507) and software SP107. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the standard silicon based photovoltaic (PV) cells (normal as well as HNP coated) was measured using a Keithley dual channel system source meter (model no. 2612A) by making a proper biasing with the help of a 4″ Probe station (model no. PE-4RF, Everbeing, Taiwan). A standard white light source equipped with the instrument (fluorescent ring light, model no. PS-LR35F, 6 W) and a separate UV lamp (255 nm, 365 nm; 6 W) were used for illumination purposes.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization: interaction between UCNPs and organic complexes

Fig. 2(a) shows XRD patterns of inorganic UCNPs (NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4) and HNPs. All the major diffraction peaks of NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4 UCNPs are well indexed considering a face centered cubic lattice (space group Fmm) of NaYF4 crystals (JCPDS file no. 77-2042) having lattice parameters a = b = c = 5.47 Å. In addition, there are a few low intensity XRD peaks (marked with asterisks), which correspond to the secondary NaY(CO3)F2 phase (JCPDS file no. 89-8925), having its fraction <10%. The presence of the major cubic NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4 phase indicates effective doping of Er3+/Yb3+ ions at the Y3+ site. In the cubic crystal structure of NaYF4, high-symmetry cation sites are occupied by Na+ and Ln3+ (Y3+, Yb3+, Er3+) ions. The XRD pattern of HNPs is exactly similar to that of UCNPs.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of UCNPs and HNPs showing the presence of cubic NaYF4 as a major phase; (b) the face centered cubic crystal structure of NaYF4. 
Furthermore, to examine the microstructure, we carried out TEM measurements of UCNPs and HNPs. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of UCNPs at different magnifications along with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. It is obvious from images shown in Fig. 3(a & b) that NPs are ultrafine with an average diameter lying in the range of 6–9 nm. A typical high resolution TEM image demonstrates the presence of clear and damage-free lattice fringes, see Fig. 3(c). An enlarged portion of the same shows the estimated distance between two fringes, which is 0.32 nm, consistent with the (111) plane of the face centered cubic phase of NaYF4. In addition, the SAED pattern in the inset to Fig. 3(c) depicts the polycrystalline diffraction rings indexed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of NaYF4. Thus, HRTEM and SEAD patterns demonstrate that UCNPs have good crystalline properties along with the ultra-small size (<10 nm).
 Fig. 3  Microstructure of UCNPs: (a, b) TEM images at different magnifications showing the average diameter of particles in the range 6–9 nm, (c, d) HRTEM images show the lattice fringes with minimal distortions. Polycrystalline diffraction rings in the SAED pattern are shown in the inset of (c). 

Fig. 4(a & b) show the TEM images of the HNPs which reveal that the ultra-small UCNPs are fairly dispersed in the organic complex (ETP). UCNPs retain their crystalline nature in HNPs as well. A HRTEM image of HNPs shows the presence of clear and damage-free lattice fringes of UCNPs, see Fig. 4(c). Polycrystalline diffraction rings due to different planes of NaYF4 are also marked in the SAED pattern, see Fig. 4(d). Thus, XRD and TEM characterizations indicate that the crystalline nature of hybrid materials is due to UCNPs (NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4) and there are no changes due to their hybrid formation with organic complexes. The HNPs seem like a cluster of organic complexes around the UCNPs, which opens the possibility of a weak intersystem interaction between the two entities. Sheet like structures of UCNPs embedded in organic complexes cause lanthanide ions of the two different systems to come closer, which could help in energy transfer between them.

Furthermore, it seems imperative to see the effect of inorganic UCNPs on the structure of the organic complex (ETP), if any. We have explored it by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fig. 5 shows the FTIR spectra of ETP and HNPs. FTIR spectra of ETP contain a large number of peaks which are basically due to three constituent molecules in ETP, namely Phen, TTA and Eu–O. The main IR peak of TTA is observed at 1600 cm−1, which is assigned to the asymmetric stretching mode of CO.30 The thenoyl ring in the TTA structure points to 1413 cm−1 & 1540 cm−1 (νasCC–C) and 935 cm−1 (C–H in plane deformation). Some other peaks due to TTA are observed at 1359 cm−1 (νsCO), 1279 cm−1 (νasCF3), 1205 cm−1 & 1179 cm−1 (βsC–H) and 642 cm−1 (βsCF3).30 Characteristic peaks due to Phen are observed at 1604 cm−1 (νCN), 1509 cm−1 (νCC), 1413 cm−1 (νCC and νCN), 983 cm−1 (δC–H), 840 cm−1 (δCCH–C) and 713 cm−1 (δC–H).31 A peak corresponding to the stretching vibration of Eu–O appears at 581 cm−1. When UCNPs are added into the ETP to make HNPs, there is no change in the peak positions listed above. Some new peaks appear that are characteristic absorption peaks due to UCNPs. This indicates that there is no new bond formation and the organic structure also remains unaltered at the molecular level.

Thus, primarily it could be inferred that the interaction between inorganic and organic systems in HNPs is a weak interaction like van der Waals forces. It does not affect the atomic/molecular arrangements of inorganic UCNPs (i.e. crystal structure) as well as the molecular structure of ETP. The van der Waals forces are well known for anisotropic nature (except those between two noble gas atoms) and depend on the relative orientation and surface topography of the molecules/particles. The ultrafine particle size of the inorganic UCNPs in HNPs plays an important role. The ultrafine particles result in a greater total area of contact between UCNPs and ETP. This improves the van der Waals force of interaction as well as the tendency for mechanical interlocking between two systems in HNPs. Our optical studies point to two important optical effects, different from characteristic optical properties of both the individual systems, which also indicate a significant interaction between the two systems.
3.2 Steady state optical characterization: UV-visible absorption, photoluminescence, and photon-upconversion studies

Fig. 6 shows a detailed study of the optical properties of UCNPs, ETP and HNPs. The absorption spectrum of the HNPs shows broad band absorption in the UV region up to 400 nm, see Fig. 6(a). This broad absorption corresponds to the absorption of the organic complex ETP. A few sharp, although weak, absorption bands are marked in the NIR region, see the inset to Fig. 6(a). These sharp absorption peaks correspond to Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in UCNPs. The peak at 980 nm is the well-known absorption of Yb3+, which is used for near infrared to visible UC through the involvement of cooperative energy transfer from the Yb3+ ion pair. Therefore, it is obvious that the hybrid material could be excited using almost all the wavelengths in the UV region (for photoluminescence) and by some characteristic excitations in the NIR region (for UC luminescence) as well.
 Fig. 6  (a) Optical absorption spectrum of HNPs in the UV-visible-NIR region, (b) PL (DS) emission spectra of ETP and HNPs for λex = 395 nm, (c) UC luminescence spectra of UCNPs and HNPs for λex = 980 nm, and (d) overlap between the excitation band of the ETP (for λem = 611 nm) and the emission band of UCNPs (for λex = 980 nm). 
Photoluminescence (also called downshifting, DS) properties of the organic complex ETP have already been studied and reported in our earlier work.27 It is an excellent material for UV light absorption/sensitization and gives an intense emission of Eu3+ in the red region. Under UV excitation HNPs also show a similar PL spectrum as the ETP complex, see Fig. 6(b). The emission intensity of the HNPs is slightly smaller as compared to ETP, which is apparent. The emission of Eu3+ has been recorded by exciting the samples with different wavelengths between 200 and 400 nm, i.e. 275, 330, 390 nm (see ESI Fig. S1†). Under each excitation, the PL spectrum exhibits characteristic sharp emission peaks at 578, 591, 611, 649 and 702 nm corresponding to 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions of Eu3+ ions, respectively.26,27 Among all these transitions 5D0 → 7F2 transition peaking at 611 nm is the most intense one and is mainly responsible for the bright red emission from the ETP/HNPs. Furthermore, the emission intensity is maximum under 390 nm excitation wavelength. This is because of the combined effect of energy transfer from the ligand to Eu3+ ions and direct excitation of Eu3+ ions to the 5L6 level.26 The luminescence mechanism behind the red emission of Eu3+ is illustrated in the energy level diagram in Fig. 7. It is evident from Fig. 7(b & c) that the emission spectrum of Phen overlaps with the absorption spectrum of TTA, and subsequently the absorption spectrum of Eu3+ overlaps with the emission spectrum of TTA. This provides an opportunity for a cascade energy transfer from Phen to TTA and finally to Eu3+ ions through both radiative and non-radiative processes.32 Malta et al. have already given a mechanism according to which both the triplet and singlet states of Phen transfer their excitation energy to triplet and singlet states of TTA molecules, from where the energy is transferred to Eu3+ ions in their different excited states, as shown in Fig. 7.33,34 Finally, the characteristic 4f–4f transition of Eu3+ ions is observed through different channels. The intense PL from the ETP complex and HNPs under UV light makes it useful for LSC applications.

An energy transfer from Er3+ (of UCNPs) to Eu3+ (of the ETP complex) is also shown. (b) (i) Emission spectra of Phen and (ii) absorption spectra of TTA. (c) (i) Emission spectra of TTA and (ii) absorption spectra of EuCl3. 
In addition to the DS luminescence property, the UC luminescence property of the UCNPs and HNPs was also investigated in detail. For the UC luminescence, a 980 nm diode laser was used for excitation purposes. The emission spectrum of UCNPs (Fig. 6(c)) shows three dominant emission peaks at around 520, 540 and 653 nm corresponding to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively.35–38 Obviously the green transition around 520 and 540 nm is the most intense one. The log–log plot of laser input power versus emission intensity for the transitions at 520, 540, and 653 nm confirms the involvement of two photons for the particular UC process (see ESI Fig. S2†). The mechanism for the UC is also shown in the energy level diagram in Fig. 7(a). The 980 nm photons are first absorbed by the Er3+ ions as well as Yb3+ ions to populate the 4I11/2 state through ground state absorption (GSA) and energy transfer (ET) processes. Subsequently, the population of the 4I11/2 state is transferred to the 4I13/2 state non-radiatively. In the next step, the same 980 nm photon pumps atoms from 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states to the 4F7/2 and 4F9/2 states, respectively, through the excited state absorption (ESA) process. Another channel for populating the 4F7/2 level is the cooperative energy transfer (CET) process. In the co-operative process, two excited Yb3+ ions can transfer their excitation energy simultaneously to the 4F7/2 level of Er3+ ions. The atoms in the 4F9/2 state relax to the ground state through the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. The population of the 4F7/2 state relaxes non-radiatively to the lower lying 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 states, from where different radiative transitions (Er3+: 4S3/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2) are observed.
3.3 Time domain optical characterization: an energy transfer from Er3+ to Eu3+ ions
The UC spectrum of HNPs also shows the presence of all the bands listed above for UCNPs. However, along with all these bands, a new set of peaks (around 586 nm and 611 nm) is also observed in the UC spectrum, see the inset to Fig. 6(c). These peaks do not match any of the transitions of Er3+ in UCNPs. Instead, they are the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ ions (5D0 → 7F1,2). The presence of Eu3+ emission in HNPs, under the 980 nm excitation wavelength, is remarkable because Eu3+ cannot absorb 980 nm radiation as there is no energy level matching with this energy. Now, the emission of Eu3+ could be observed only through an energy transfer mechanism either from Yb3+ ions to Eu3+ ions or from Er3+ ions to Eu3+ ions. The first possibility i.e. an energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Eu3+ ions could be possible through cooperative energy sensitization of Eu3+ by the Yb3+ ion pair. There are a large number of reports on UC in the Eu3+–Yb3+ couple through a co-operative energy transfer process.39,40 The theory of cooperative optical processes was first given by Dexter.41,42 It was shown that the cooperative optical processes are two-centre processes and are essentially determined by the existence of strong interactions (electric multipole or super-exchange) between the two centers. However, in the present HNPs, Eu3+ and Yb3+ are the parts of two different hosts, which are entangled through a weak interaction force. So, this possibility cannot be accepted. Consequently, the second possible mechanism i.e. an energy transfer from Er3+ to Eu3+ ions seems more effective.

Fig. 6(d) shows an overlap of the emission spectrum of UCNPs (for λex = 980 nm) and the excitation spectrum of the ETP complex (for λem = 611 nm). Thus, it is feasible that the two photon UC process populates the 2H11/2/4S3/2 level of Er3+ from where the green emission is observed. This green emission may excite the 5D0,1 level of Eu3+ ions, and thus characteristic red emission of Eu3+ is observed. This has been further verified by lifetime measurements of related transitions in the ETP complex, UCNPs and HNPs using different excitation wavelengths. Under 980 nm excitation, the decay profiles of the UC based green transition of Er3+ in both UCNPs and HNPs are shown in Fig. 8(a). Curves are easily fitted with a mono-exponential function with high R2 values (0.9645 and 0.9647). The decay time decreases for HNPs (0.303 ms) as compared with UCNPs (0.326 ms). This indicates a feed of energy from the green level of Er3+ (donor) to an acceptor. Since 980 nm could not excite Eu3+, so the dynamics of the red emission of Eu3+ ions (5D0 → 7F2 transition) was performed using 523 nm and 543 nm excitations. These wavelengths can directly excite the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+, responsible for an energy transfer to Eu3+. The decay curves are fitted well using mono-exponential function, see Fig. 8(b & c). The lifetime of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition for ETP and HNPs shows an increase from 0.734 ms to 0.823 ms for λext = 523 nm and from 0.724 to 0.837 ms for λext = 543 nm, respectively. In summary, a decrease in the lifetime of the donor ion (Er3+) and an increase in the decay time of the acceptor ion (Eu3+) are observed, which supports an energy transfer from Er3+ to Eu3+ ions in HNPs.
 Fig. 8  (a) Decay profile of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ in UCNPs and HNPs under 980 nm excitation, (b–d) decay profile of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ in ETP and HNPs under 523 nm, 543 nm and 385 nm excitation, respectively. 
In addition to this, the decay profile of the red emission of Eu3+ under λext = 385 nm also shows a similar trend; see Fig. 8(d). In the case of the pure ETP complex, the lifetime was found to be 1.093 ms. However, for HNPs the lifetime is 1.185 ms. It is quite interesting to note an increase in the decay time under 385 nm excitation, as 385 nm does not excite Er3+ ions in UCNPs. Therefore, it is inferred that the increase in lifetime is not only due to an energy transfer but through other channels as well. One of the possibilities may be due to a decrease in non-radiative channels. Herein, ultrafine UCNPs play an important role in reducing the non-radiative channels for Eu3+ emission. The HNPs abide a large surface area and thus the volume of interaction between NPs and complex molecules is wide enough. Therefore, a considerably smaller surface of the complex molecules comes into direct contact with the external environment. This causes relatively low adsorption of quenching centres (OH, NOx, etc. from the environment may get adsorbed on the surface of the ETP complex) on the surface and thereby may improve the decay time. FTIR spectra of the ETP complex and HNPs also support this conjecture (see ESI Fig. S3†). Thus, the synthesized HNP material is an efficient optical material, which displays optical behaviour through DS, UC and energy transfer processes. This could help effectively in energy transformation and energy harvesting via spectral modification.
3.4 Energy harvesting application of HNPs
The energy conversion efficiency of a c-Si solar cell is very low (less than 15%) for UV-A (400–315 nm) and UV-B (315–280 nm) regions of the solar spectrum. Fig. 9 shows the spectral overlap of the absorption spectra of HNPs dispersed in a PMMA (2.5/97.5 wt%) polymer, the AM-1.5 solar terrestrial spectrum, and a light conversion efficiency curve of the c-Si solar cell. HNPs show strong absorption in the 250–400 nm region and can be used for energy harvesting application in principle. The absorption of HNPs in the UV region is basically due to the organic complex (ETP). Organic ligands (TTA and Phen) in ETP efficiently absorb the UV part of the solar radiation and transfer their energy to Eu3+ ions (the central metal ion) to give intense emission peaking at 611 nm. This red emission can be absorbed by a PV cell, which can create electron–hole pairs.

For this purpose, HNPs were first dispersed in a PMMA polymer matrix, which acts as a highly transparent waveguide matrix. Various concentrations of HNPs (2.5 and 5 wt%) were dispersed in PMMA using chloroform as a solvent. Furthermore, a thin film of this HNP embedded polymer was coated on the front surface of the c-Si solar cell and dried at room temperature for 24 h. Finally, standard c-Si solar cells having dimensions of 5 cm × 5 cm were biased properly and brought under different illuminations to measure the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics covering the voltage range −1 V to 1 V in 101 steps under ambient conditions. Fig. 10 shows the I–V curve of uncoated, 2.5 wt% and 5.0 wt% HNP dispersed PMMA coated PV cells under 255 nm, 365 nm and white light lamp illuminations. Various photovoltaic parameters such as short circuit current (ISC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (ff) have been calculated and are summarized in Table 1.

All the parameters for uncoated, 2.5 wt% HNP coated and 5.0 wt% HNP coated PV cells are significantly different and show a variation for different illuminations. For the 2.5 wt% HNP coated PV cell, under all the three different illuminations, the short circuit current values (0.37 mA cm−2, 1.47 mA cm−2 and 3.26 mA cm−2, respectively) and open circuit voltage values (262 mV, 442 mV and 487 mV, respectively) are significantly improved as compared to the uncoated cell. However, in the case of the 5 wt% HNP coated PV cell, the short circuit current values (0.04 mA cm−2, 1.13 mA cm−2 and 3.20 mA cm−2, respectively) and open circuit voltage values (41 mV, 417 mV and 485 mV, respectively) are moderately enhanced as compared to the uncoated cell. Likewise, fill factor values also show an improved response for the 2.5 wt% HNP coated PV cell as compared to uncoated cells under all three illuminations. The fill factor is enhanced by 61.5%, 7.5% and 4.1%, respectively. However, contrary to the case of the 2.5 wt% HNP coated PV cell, fill factors show a decreasing response as compared to uncoated cells for the 5 wt% HNP coated PV cell under all the three illuminations. The fill factor decreases by 53.8%, 7.5% and 10.6%, respectively. A decrease in the PV parameters for 5 wt% concentration of HNPs is due to the fact that dispersion of various concentrations of HNPs in PMMA affects the optical transparency. The maximum change in the fill factor is recorded for 255 nm illumination of 2.5 wt% HNP coated PV cells, which is 61.5%, whereas the maximum value of the fill factor (0.49) is obtained for white light illumination of 2.5 wt% HNP coated cells. So it is worth noting that the 2.5 wt% HNP coated PV cells yield better performance among all PV cells.
On the other hand, due to the presence of UCNPs, a hybrid material is capable of alignment of NIR radiation in the visible region as well. We could not realize this quantitatively; however, He et al. have already demonstrated the use of NaYF4:Yb/Er (UCNPs) for improving the conversion efficiency in organolead halide perovskite solar cells.43 They applied the 980 nm NIR laser on the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells containing NaYF4:Yb/Er UCNPs simultaneously with AM1.5G standard sunlight. They found that photocurrent density increased from 22.7 mA cm−2 to 23.1 mA cm−2 due to the upconversion effect. Therefore it is expected that the present HNPs can also operate under NIR radiation to minimize the non-absorption losses to improve the solar cell efficiency.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have synthesized a novel inorganic–organic hybrid nanoparticle composed of inorganic NPs, NaY0.78Er0.02Yb0.2F4, and an organic β-diketonate complex, Eu(TTA)3Phen. Both the systems remain entangled through weak interacting forces and maintain their core integrity i.e. their characteristic structural and optical properties remain invariant in HNPs as well. However, contrary to their characteristic properties, two important optical effects are observed: (i) a resonance energy transfer from Er3+ (inorganic NPs) to Eu3+ (organic complex) under NIR excitation, and (ii) an increase in the decay time of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ in HNPs. These effects are observed primarily due to the ultra-small size (6–9 nm) and spherical shape of the inorganic NPs which offer a large surface area for wide interaction with the organic complex. HNPs embedded in a PMMA polymer show potential for luminescent solar collector (LSCs) application.
