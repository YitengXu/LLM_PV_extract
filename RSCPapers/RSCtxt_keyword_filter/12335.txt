    , Accepted 16th May 2019First published on 17th May 2019AbstractDefects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) severely affect the efficiency and stability. The use of additives to passivate the defect states in perovskite films has proved feasible and effective. Metal acetates have been recognized as promising additives for PSCs and can passivate the trap states produced by undercoordinated ions and assist in film formation. In the fabrication process, additives are frequently used combined with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to regulate the optoelectronic properties and morphology of perovskite films. However, it has been reported that the stability of the devices may be affected by the introduction of DMSO due to its evaporation during film formation. The use of too many additives will complicate the fabrication process. Well-selected and suitable additives are still required to simplify the fabrication process and to improve the efficiency and the stability of PSCs. Here, we demonstrate that highly efficient and stable devices can be achieved by only using DMF as the solvent with liquid zirconium acetate (Zr(Ac)4) as the additive. The device with Zr(Ac)4 exhibits better film quality and lower defect states than that without Zr(Ac)4. A device with a structure of ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag achieves an efficiency of up to 20.9% with an optimum concentration of the dopant, maintains more than 98% of its initial performance after continuous max power point (MPP) output testing for 1700 minutes under a xenon lamp (AM1.5G, without a UV filter) and presents almost no decline after successive thermal heating at 90 °C for one month. Overall, this work presents the benign effects of regulating perovskite crystal growth and effectively passivating defects of perovskite films by the addition of liquid metal acetate.
Introduction
Impressive optoelectronic properties, such as a suitable optical band edge, high absorption coefficient, long carrier recombination lifetime and weak exaction binding energy, have made organic–inorganic halide perovskites a hot research topic in recent years.1–10 Due to extensive and profound research, including material design, interface engineering and preparation technologies, the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly exceeded 24%.11–23 However, the current perovskite films mainly comprise polycrystalline materials based on the general solution processing methods.24,25 As a result, there is still a large density of defects in the grain boundaries, which could act as recombination centres and greatly limit the performance of PSCs.26–28 Moreover, these defects can raise the possibility of the infiltration of moisture and oxygen into perovskite, which will promote the decomposition of the perovskite film and subsequently reduce device stability.29–31 Therefore, reducing the quantity of defects is highly desired for preparation of high-quality perovskite layers.
In perovskite films, ion migration is a severe problem that can most likely induce defects at the grain boundaries and surface.32–35 In addition, it has been revealed that the strong covalence between the Pb cations and I anions in the perovskite plane results in the existence of undercoordinated Pb dimers and I trimers, which could generate charge recombination centres.36 Ion migration and the existence of undercoordinated Pb/I ions are the main sources of defect states.32 The use of additives has proven to be an effective method to passivate these trap states.29,37 For instance, TMTA, PMMA, P3HT, MACl, PbCl2, fullerene derivatives, etc. are used to passivate the defects by coordinating with Pb ions or I ions.15,29,38–41 Recently, metal acetate has been studied, and is a promising additive that can passivate undercoordinated ions and assist in film formation. Pb acetate (Pb(Ac)2) has been used as a Pb source or additive to assist in the crystallization process, which can result in an ultra-smooth film surface.42 The CO group can coordinate with Pb in the precursor solution, which will volatilize during perovskite formation. Aluminium acetate was introduced as an impurity into the perovskite precursor solution to improve the crystal quality by reducing the microstrain and remarkably improving the photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency in the polycrystalline film.43 Europium acetate has also been demonstrated to be effective in defect passivation in a recent report.44 In order to achieve high device performance, these metal acetates as well as other additives are frequently used combined with DMSO in the fabrication process of PSCs to regulate the optoelectronic properties and the film morphology. However, the use of too many materials will complicate the fabrication process and may produce undesirable defects.45 Zheng et al. reported that the use of DMSO may affect the performance of PSCs due to its evaporation in the preparation process.46 Therefore, devices with metal acetate salts as additives still require further investigation.
Here, zirconium acetate (Zr(Ac)4) is introduced as an efficient additive into MAPbI3 PSCs to obtain high-efficiency and high-stability devices. The advantages of Zr(Ac)4 as an additive are summarized as follows: (1) Zr(Ac)4 is a polar liquid that can dissolve well in dimethylformamide (DMF), which can be used to replace dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to coordinate acetate with Pb ions; the liquid characteristics of Zr(Ac)4 with a high boiling point allows it to squeeze into the grain boundaries during the growth of perovskite. (2) Zr ions have smaller radii than lead ions (72 pm vs. 119 pm); therefore, substitutional doping within the crystal lattice is very difficult. (3) The Zr ions can capture free iodide ions, thereby passivating the defects caused by iodide ions. Due to the tetravalent Zr ions, the combination with iodide ions is more robust and the passivation effect is better than that at other lower valence states. In addition, alleviation of microstrain inside the perovskite film has been observed with the introduction of Zr(Ac)4. Releasing the microstrain is considered an effective way to reduce defects, thus leading to highly stable PSCs. A structure of ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag is fabricated to estimate the effect of the incorporation of Zr(Ac)4 in devices. A high PCE of 20.9% is achieved for a PSC with an optimized concentration of Zr(Ac)4, compared with a low PCE of ∼12% for the device without dopant passivation. More than 98% of the initial performance is retained after continuous MPP output testing for 1700 minutes under AM1.5G illumination (without a UV filter) for the device with Zr(Ac)4 and the device presents almost no decline after successive thermal heating at 90 °C for one month.
Results and discussion
To assess the impact of Zr(Ac)4 on the crystallization process and the final crystal structure of the resulting perovskite films, different concentrations (from 0 to 5 mol% of the Zr/Pb ratio) of Zr(Ac)4 are directly added into the as-prepared MAPbI3 precursor solutions. Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra for the as-deposited films. All XRD results demonstrate that the perovskite films crystallize in a typical tetragonal crystal (I4/mcm, a = b, ) structure.1,2Fig. 1b shows the changes in the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) and the intensities of the (110) plane with variations in the concentration. As the doping levels increased from 0 to 0.3 mol%, the intensities of the main perovskite peak (110) consecutively increased, and there is no obvious decrease in peak widths with a non-measurable shift in the position of the peak (Fig. S1†). As the doping concentration increases from 0.6 mol% to 1.2 mol%, the (110) peak intensities and the peak widths gradually decrease and broaden, respectively. With a further increase in the doping concentration to more than 2.5 mol%, the peak intensities and widths drastically decrease and seriously broaden with respect to the control sample, respectively. Broadening in the XRD peaks has been reported to be mainly caused by the microstrain effect.43 We quantify the microstrain in these perovskite films by analysing the peak broadening of the XRD diffraction patterns according to the modified Williamson–Hall method (where the microstrain ε is defined as ε = Δdε/d; Δdε is the width broadening due to the microstrain and d is the mean d-spacing).47 The microstrain of perovskite decreases with increasing concentration from 0 to 0.3 mol% and then increases after the addition level exceeds 0.3 mol% (Fig. 1c). This behaviour suggests that the introduction of small amounts of the Zr dopant can lead to a decrease in the microstrain. It has been suggested that releasing the microstrain is an effective way to reduce defects, thus improving lattice order for hybrid perovskite samples, leading to an improvement in stability.

Transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) and scanning TEM-high angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) measurements are employed to probe the remaining Zr ions and the location/distribution of the Zr ions in the annealed perovskite films (Fig. 2). The left bottom portion of the overlaid image is magnified for a detailed survey. In the red circles marked in the HAADF image, the crystal fringes can be clearly observed and Zr ions are mainly concentrated along the grain boundaries. The Zr ions are mostly distributed at the perovskite surface and grain boundaries during crystallization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Fig. S2†) further support the results of XRD. Both the interplanar distances obtained from the lattice fringes are 0.31 nm, which can be assigned to the (220) plane of the tetragonal crystal (Fig. S2a and b†).2,48 The inset images show the selected area diffraction patterns, which further confirm the analysis results above.

Fig. 3 presents top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite samples with different concentrations of Zr(Ac)4. For the image corresponding to the control film (Fig. 3a), microcracks and pinholes are observed and are distributed on the films. The grains grow gradually with doping levels ranging from 0.15 mol% to 0.3 mol%. No pinholes or microcracks are noticeably observed with respect to the control sample (Fig. 3c–e), which is consistent with the microstrain analysis above. By continuously increasing the doping level to more than 1.2 mol%, the polycrystalline grains become indistinct, and smaller domains begin to grow, as is clearly observed in Fig. 3g and h. When the doping level exceeds 2.5%, many small domains (white dots) on the film are observed (Fig. 3g and h). We hypothesize that too much Zr(Ac)4 additive may wrap the PbI2 and thus restrict the formation of perovskite. An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is used to further confirm the morphology of perovskite films with different concentrations of Zr(Ac)4. The images are displayed in Fig. S3† and are consistent with the SEM images. Therefore, the perovskite films can tolerate the addition of Zr ions into the precursor solution up to approximately 0.6 mol% before any negative impact on the morphology occurs.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of perovskite with different concentration levels of 0 mol%, 0.075 mol%, 0.15 mol%, 0.3 mol%, 0.6 mol%, 1.2 mol%, 2.5 mol% and 5 mol%, corresponding to the images from (a to h). 
No stretching vibration of the CO bond appears in the sample of perovskite with Zr(Ac)4, which is verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. S4†). In contrast to that in pristine Zr(Ac)4, the peak for the CO group intensely appears at ∼1720 cm−1. The FTIR results demonstrate the removal of the acetate group from the perovskite film after film formation. Thus, the halide anions in this system must balance the charge of the Zr ions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of perovskites with (w)/without (wo) doping of Zr(Ac)4 additive show the Zr 3p peak in the survey spectra, which indicates that Zr remains in the film (Fig. S5†). Fig. 4a shows the I 3d peaks of perovskite doped with or without Zr. The I 3d peaks of the sample doped with Zr shift towards lower binding energies in contrast to the sample without doping. This shift derives from the interaction between I and Zr. The interaction confirms the passivation of the I defects by Zr, which can favour device stability. Fig. 4b shows the Pb 4f spectra of perovskites with/without Zr doping. There are two main Pb peaks for both samples, while there are two small peaks attributed to the presence of metallic Pb in the film of perovskite without doping. The presence of metallic Pb further indicates the existence of iodide defects in the perovskite lattice, which act as recombination centres and cause the instability of this material.15 For the sample with the Zr(Ac)4 additive, the atomic Pb peak is greatly suppressed, indicating the effective passivation with the use of Zr(Ac)4.

In addition, we observe an almost one-fold increase in the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity with a blue shift, which is consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. 4c). The PL process in perovskite films mainly relies on the trap-assisted recombination at the grain boundaries and the radiative recombination of the grains inside. The increasing steady-state PL intensity indicates a reduction in the non-radiative recombination induced by the trap sites.49 To analyse the dynamic recombination, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements are performed. The TRPL decay curves are fitted with a bi-exponential decay model (Fig. 4d) by using the function y = A1exp(−x/τ1) + A2exp(−x/τ2) (where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively). The film with Zr(Ac)4 exhibits fast and slow phase lifetimes of τ1 = 22.8 ns (fraction A1 = 34%) and τ2 = 162.9 ns (fraction A2 = 66%), respectively. By contrast, the sample without Zr(Ac)4 gives τ1 = 13.1 ns (fraction A1 = 52%) and τ2 = 88.5 ns (fraction A2 = 48%), respectively. This result indicates that the charge carrier lifetime is prolonged by the addition of Zr(Ac)4, which results from a decreased defect density.
To quantitatively analyse the defect density, sandwich devices are fabricated by inserting the perovskite films between indium tin oxide (ITO) and gold (inset of Fig. 4e) and the evolution of the space-charge limited current (SCLC) is characterized for different bias voltages, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The defect density (Nt) is evaluated based on the SCLC measurements according to the following equation:26  where ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of perovskite and the vacuum permittivity, respectively, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, d is the thickness of the perovskite films (Fig. S6†), and e is the elementary charge. The defect densities are determined to be 4.24 × 1015 cm−3 and 8.36 × 1015 cm−3 for the 550 nm thick MAPbI3 film with and without Zr(Ac)4, respectively. The results further confirm the PL measurements showing that the additive of Zr(Ac)4 can passivate the film defects.
Inverted planar heterojunction PSCs (ITO/P3CT-N/MAPbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, Fig. 5a) are fabricated to evaluate whether these improved properties translate into enhancements in device performance. A clear trend of an enhancement in device performance is produced by the introduction of the Zr dopant into the perovskite precursor solution from 0 to 0.3 mol% (Fig. S7†). With increasing concentration ranging from 0.6 mol% to 5 mol%, the performance quickly decreases. For devices fabricated from the control precursor solution, the average Voc and short-circuit current density (Jsc) are 0.86 ± 0.02 V and 19.09 ± 0.60 mA cm−2, respectively (Table S1†). With the incorporation of the Zr dopant into the perovskite, both the Jsc and Voc increase up to average values of 1.09 ± 0.02 V and 22.28 ± 0.41 mA cm−2, respectively, peaking at 0.3 mol%. Furthermore, the average fill factor (FF) increases to 76.87 ± 3.09% with the addition of Zr up to 0.3 mol%, after which the FF begins to decrease. The optimized Zr doping improves all of the performance parameters (improvement percentage: Voc, 26.8%; Jsc, 16.7%; FF, 12.4% and PCE, 68.1%). Voc (26.8% improvement) is notably enhanced compared with that of the control devices, which may correlate with defect passivation by Zr doping. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is employed to investigate the electronic structures of the perovskite films with and without Zr(Ac)4; the Fermi level (EF) of the film with Zr(Ac)4 is shifted to higher binding energy relative to the film without dopant (Fig. 5b). According to the previous reports, the shift of EF indicates a more N-type nature of the film with the dopant and can result in the increase in Voc.24EF, the valence band (Ec) and the valence band energy (Ev) are determined using the equations: EF = 21.21 (He I) − Ecutoff, Ec = EF + Eonset, Ev = Ec − Eg. Eg is obtained from the Kubelka–Munk spectra corresponding to the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5c). The energy levels match well based on the results of UPS. The energy levels are summarized in the energy band diagram (Fig. 5d).

Fig. 5e shows the J–V curves of the most efficient device doped with Zr under standard simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with different scan directions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the PSC performance are given in Table 1. The measurement exhibits a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 22.84 mA cm−2, and an FF up to 83.17%, leading to a best PCE of 20.9%. The hysteresis is virtually negligible in our devices, as confirmed from the J–V curves shown in Fig. 5e. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained under AM1.5G solar spectra at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance to assess the Jsc of the device doped with Zr (Fig. 5f). The integrated Jsc over the full EQE spectra is 21.87 mA cm−2 which gives an accuracy of 4.25% in contrast to the J–V measurements under simulated sunlight. The accuracy may result from a small degradation of the device tested in air without encapsulation.

Fig. 6a illustrates the stabilized power output of devices while holding the devices at their MPP voltage under simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and measuring the photocurrent as a function of time. Here, the steady-state power is set to 0.91 V. The measurement reached the stabilized photocurrent within a very short time, which is indicative of negligible hysteresis. A stabilized photocurrent is achieved at 21.24 mA cm−2 and a stabilized PCE is achieved of 19.25%. For further evaluation of the stability of the device doped with Zr, we extend the test time of the MPP to 1700 minutes using a standard xenon lamp (Newport Oriel Sol3A solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2) without a UV filter. More than 98% of the device's initial performance is retained with a continuous output at the MPP (Fig. 6b). The hysteresis is negligible for the device with the dopant after MPP testing for a long time (Fig. S8a†). To measure the thermal stability of the device doped with Zr, the device is heated on a hotplate covered with a Petri dish at 90 °C. After successive thermal heating for one month, the device shows almost no degradation (Fig. 6d). The forward and reverse directions of J–V curves measured on different days overlap well (Fig. S8b†). The stability measurements indicate that the device with the Zr(Ac)4 additive exhibits impressive stability, which could be attributed to the benign film morphology and the robust interaction of Zr ions with halide ions.

To confirm the effects on device performance due to the addition of Zr ions or acetate ions, we also replace the Zr(Ac)4 dopant with Pb(Ac)2 and ZrI4. Samples with Pb(Ac)2 and Zr(Ac)4 present larger grains than the samples with dopants of ZrI4 (Fig. S9†), ascribed to the assistance of acetate ions during film formation. While microcracks and pinholes are still observed in the samples with Pb(Ac)2, the film surfaces doped with Zr(Ac)4 and ZrI4 present compact morphologies. A batch of devices are fabricated to assess the effect on performance (Fig. S10†). Devices with ZrI4 and Zr(Ac)4 present higher Voc compared with the devices with Pb(Ac)2, while Jsc of devices with ZrI4 and Zr(Ac)4 is comparatively lower. The fill factor (FF) of these devices is not very different. Overall, devices with Zr(Ac)4 present a higher PCE than those with Pb(Ac)2 and ZrI4, which indicates that on the one hand, the acetate ions contribute to the high-quality perovskite film during formation, and on the other hand, Zr ions show a more robust passivation of defects. Meanwhile, the liquid Lewis acid–base coordination complex may demonstrate better effects for passivation than the solid.
Experimental
Materials
ITO (Rs ≤ 15 Ω per square) and P3CT-N (synthesized in our lab according to previous reports),50 PbI2 (99.99%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%, Advanced Electionelection Technology Co., Ltd), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (IPA, 99.99%, Alfa Aesar), bathocuproine (BCP, 99.9%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), PC61BM (American Dye Source), zirconium acetate (Zr(Ac)4, Zr 15.0–16.0%, Aladdin), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%, Sigma).
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The ITO substrate (20 mm × 20 mm) is sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min, respectively. The cleaned substrates are dried under a N2 flow and then treated in O2 plasma for 3 min. The P3CT-N solution (1 mg mL−1 in methanol) is deposited on the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, 80 μL of a perovskite precursor solution (1 mmol of PbI2 and MAI was dissolved in 600 μL of DMF for 24 hours, Zr(Ac)4 was added and the mixture was filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter before spinning) was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s. During this spin coating process, 280 mL of CB was quickly dripped on the rotating substrate at 10 s. And then the prepared film was heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 40 min. Devices were prepared in a N2 filled glovebox with O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm, respectively. An inner temperature higher than 25 °C would be more appropriate. After the substrate cooled to room-temperature, a PC61BM solution (20 mg mL−1 in CB) was spin-coated on perovskite films at 1500 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. BCP (1 mg ml−1 in IPA) was then spin-coated on the PC61BM. At last, the device was transferred to vacuum chamber (<10−4 pa). 100 nm Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation using a metal shadow mask. The device area was 9 mm2.
Device characterization
The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2440 SourceMeter controlled using a computer. All the solar cells were measured under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW cm−2) with an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator. The EQE measurement was conducted using a Newport quantum efficiency measurement system (ORIEL IQE 200TM) combined with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated by one standard Si/Ge solar cell. EQE was measured in air at room temperature.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). 
FTIR samples are prepared by scraping off the perovskite layer from the substrate and then mixing with pre-dried KBr powder. FTIR spectra are recorded in transmittance mode using an IR spectrometer instrument (Thermo, Nicolet 6700).


Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
SEM images are recorded using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, S-4800) with an accelerating voltage of 8 kV.


Atomic force microscopy (AFM). 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Dimension 3100 V, Veeco, USA, tapping mode) was used to observe the surfaces of the perovskite materials.


XRD. 
The crystallinity of the as-prepared samples was analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Germany) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm).


Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
TEM images are recorded using a FEI Talos F200X. The grid was pre-treated with plasma for 1 min, and then the perovskite solution (0.1 M) was dropped onto the grid. The samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.


Photoluminescence (PL) spectra. 
PL spectra are recorded with a Fluorolog-Horiba fluorometer with excitation wavelength at 466 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, LabRAM HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon) decay measurements are conducted with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and emission wavelength of 760 nm.


UV-vis. 
UV-vis spectra were recorded on a GS54T spectrophotometer (Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co., China).


UPS/XPS. 
UPS and XPS were performed using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DLD XPS/UPS system. For XPS, survey scans to identify overall surface composition were performed using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). High-resolution scans to identify bonding states were performed at 20 eV pass energy and 50 meV channel width. All the spectra were adjusted according to the standard value of the C 1s peak at (284.7 ± 0.1) eV. UPS was carried out using He I radiation at 21.2 eV from a discharge lamp operated at 20 mA, a pass energy of 5 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. A −7.35 V bias was applied to the samples in order to separate the sample and analyzer low-kinetic-energy cutoffs.


Stability measurement. 
Maximum power output measurement was conducted under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW cm−2) with an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator without a light filter. Thermal stability: the device was heated on a hotplate covered with a Petri dish at 90 °C.

Conclusions
In summary, we have discovered that the optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3 films can be largely promoted by introducing a low level of liquid Zr(Ac)4 as an additive. With the addition of Zr(Ac)4, the film quality is improved due to the release of crystal microstrain. The Zr ions are concentrated along the grain boundaries and interact with I ions, which can effectively passivate I defects. Metallic Pb is largely restrained due to the addition of Zr(Ac)4. In addition, the doped device presents a longer TRPL decay time than the device without doping, which further demonstrates that the defects in the perovskite are effectively suppressed and passivated. For devices prepared with an optimum dopant concentration, an efficiency of up to 20.9% is achieved with negligible hysteresis. With regard to stability, the device prepared with Zr(Ac)4 retains more than 98% of its initial performance after continuous MPP testing for 1700 minutes under AM1.5G illumination (without a UV filter) and presents almost no decline after successive thermal heating at 90 °C for one month. This work demonstrates the effect of regulating perovskite crystal growth and effectively passivating defects in perovskite films by the addition of a liquid Zr(Ac)4.
