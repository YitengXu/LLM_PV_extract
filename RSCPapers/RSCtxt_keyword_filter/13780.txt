    , Accepted 30th November 2004First published on 10th January 2005AbstractTwo novel cyanine–fullerene dyads have been synthesized by means of the Prato reaction from the corresponding cyanine-aldehyde, N-methylglycine and C60. As well as a thorough characterization using MS-TOF, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and elemental analysis, the optical and electrochemical properties of these two dyads were investigated. The fluorescence of the cyanine–fullerene dyads was quenched efficiently as compared to the pristine cyanine, which we have attributed to photo-induced electron transfer from the cyanine to C60. The redox potentials obtained by cyclic voltammetry provide evidence that this electron transfer is energetically favorable. Single and double layer photovoltaic devices were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the dyad. The energetic conversion efficiency of the double layer device exceeds 0.1% under 3.1 mW cm−2 white light irradiation. The results show that cyanine–fullerene dyads are promising materials for photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
The field of organic photovoltaics has attracted considerable attention because of its low cost and simple, large-area manufacturing techniques. Although the overall conversion efficiency is still low as compared to inorganic photovoltaics, the recent developments in the field of organic photovoltaic devices are most promising. Since the discovery of ultrafast photo-induced electron transfer from conjugated polymers to buckminsterfullerene (C60)1 and the introduction of the “bulk heterojunction” concept,2 the efficiency of polymer photovoltaic devices has been improved steadily in recent years.3 The conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells was raised to 3.5% based on P3HT and PCBM.3e At the same time, the efficiency of heterojunction thin-film photovoltaics made from small molecules was also improved quickly and a value as high as 4.2% was achieved with a copper phthalocyanine/C60 double layer solar cell.4 These significant improvements could be achieved by both the development of advanced materials and the introduction of novel device concepts and architectures. One of the key problems for boosting the photovoltaic efficiency is the dissociation of the exciton into a positive and negative charge carrier. Excitons are formed upon photon absorption and are able to diffuse in the organic material until decay or dissociation by a charge transfer process occurs. In order to develop materials with high exciton dissociation efficiency, molecules were designed where C60 is covalently linked to the light-absorbing chromophore. Not only dyads but also polymers and oligomers were studied in this respect.5–7 Indeed, the “in phase” between absorption and photocurrent spectrum indicates that excitons are dissociated throughout the whole organic film and not just at a heterointerface. The recent work by Fukuzumi shows that the efficiency based on devices using porphyrin–fullerene dyads can reach nearly 1% for optimized devices.7g Among the different classes of dyes, cyanines have received only little attention in the field of photovoltaics. So far, cyanines have proven to exhibit high reliability as spectral sensitizers in photography, optical recording media in optical disks, laser dyes, photorefractive materials, and fluorescent biosensors.8 Only recently, cyanine dyes have also been used as highly efficient sensitizers in Grätzel type solar cells.9 In previous work, we have investigated the use of cyanine dyes to build thin film heterojunction photovoltaic devices by the spin coating method.10 Among the various advantages cyanines offer are the high extinction coefficients, the ease of solution processing as well as their advantageous electrochemical properties.
In this paper, we describe the synthesis as well as the optical and electrochemical properties of two novel cyanine–fullerene dyads 1a and 1b (see Fig. 1) and the preliminary investigation of photovoltaic devices based on the latter.

UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, while fluorescence spectra were measured using a FluoroMax-3. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal reference. TOF-MS spectra were recorded on a VG12-250. Elemental analysis data were obtained on a Perkin Elmer 240c instrument. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a EG&G Instruments VersaStat II with a three-electrode cell in dichloromethane solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The supporting electrolyte was tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M), the working electrode was glassy carbon, the counter electrode was Pt and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl.

A mixture of 0.69 mmol of aldehyde (7a, 7b and 2), 0.69 mmol C60, 5.62 mmol N-methylglycine and 200 mL chlorobenzene was refluxed under an atmosphere of argon for 20 h. Most of the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel). Elution with toluene afforded the unreacted C60, and further elution with dichloromethane–acetone (20 : 1, for 1a and 1b) or toluene–ethyl acetate (15 : 1, for 3) afforded the desired fraction. After washing with methanol, the desired product 1a, 1b and 3 was obtained with a yield of 38–42%.

Preparation and characterization of photovoltaic devices
A layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited by spin coating on precleaned ITO glass and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum. The cyanine–fullerene dyad (60 nm) was spin coated on top of PEDOT from chlorobenzene solution, heated to 35 °C under high vacuum and cooled down to room temperature. For double layer devices, a layer of C60 (40 nm) was deposited under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Finally, aluminium (75 nm) was deposited under high vacuum to form the cathode. The thicknesses of the films were measured using a Tencor Alpha-Step 550 Surface Profilometer. The photocurrent action spectrum was measured using monochromatic light from a JY HR 460 monochromator with a tungsten lamp source. The I–V curves were measured using a Keithley 236 source meter. White light from a tungsten halogen lamp was used to irradiate the device from the ITO side. The light intensity was varied using a Neutral Density (ND) filter. All measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis of the cyanine–fullerene dyads
The route for the synthesis of cyanine–fullerene dyads is shown in Fig. 2. The asymmetric cyanine dye (6a–b) was obtained through reaction of indolium iodide (4) with the corresponding aldehyde (5a–b) in acetic anhydride at 100–110 °C. The crude product obtained in the first step was refluxed with sodium perchlorate in ethanol to give the carboxyl acid cyanine (6a–b). This approach avoids the production of symmetric cyanines, allowing easy purification by recrystallization in ethanol as well as a high yield. The coupling of carboxyl acid cyanine (6a–b) with 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzaldehyde 2 was carried out in the presence of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) as catalyst in dichloromethane at room temperature in high yield. After completion of the reaction, the precipitated dicyclohexylurea was removed by filtration. The solution was washed with diluted HCl solution followed by aq. Na2CO3 and water, and then purified by column chromatography to give the cyanine-aldehyde (7a–b).
 Fig. 2  The synthetic routes of cyanine–fullerene dyads. 
The cyanine–fullerene dyads (1a–b) and fulleropyrrolidine (3) were synthesized by the Prato reaction14 from the corresponding aldehyde (7a–b and 2), N-methylglycine and C60 in chlorobenzene. The final products were isolated by column chromatography with a yield of 38–42%. The cyanine–fullerene dyads (1a–1b) can also be synthesized by the coupling of carboxylic acid cyanine (6a–b) with 3 in the presence of DCC and DMAP in dichloromethane. However, the difficulty of removing dicyclohexylurea from the final products reduces the yield and purity of the cyanine–fullerene dyads. The structure and purity of the cyanine–fullerene dyads were characterized with TOF-MS, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and elemental analysis.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 3 shows the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the cyanine–fullerene dyads (1a–b), pristine cyanine (6a–b) and the fulleropyrrolidine (3) in dichloromethane solution. Their respective optical data are shown in Table 1. In CH2Cl2 solution, the dyads (1a–b) exhibit maximum absorption at 556 nm and 580 nm with vibrational shoulder peaks at 524 nm and 546 nm, which is similar to the corresponding pristine cyanines (6a–b) in the visible region. The maximum absorption of 1b is red shifted by 24 nm compared with 1a due to the longer conjugation length. In the UV region, the absorption of the dyads is stronger than that of the corresponding pristine cyanine due to the presence of C60. From the insert figures of Fig. 3, we can see that the dyads (1a–b) show weak absorption at about 703 nm, which is the characteristic absorption of fulleropyrrolidine. The absorption spectra of the dyads (1a–b) are close to the superposition of the spectra of fulleropyrrolidine (3) and pristine cyanine (6a–b). This result means that the electronic properties of the cyanine do not change after connection with fullerene and charge transfer does not occur between the donor and the acceptor in their ground state.

Under excitation of the maximum absorption wavelength, the cyanine dyes (6a–b) show relatively strong fluorescence with maxima at 578 nm and 601 nm. Their fluorescence spectra are the mirror image of the absorption spectra. However, the fluorescence of the dyads (1a–b) is efficiently quenched compared to the pristine cyanine dyes with efficiencies of about 95% and 91%, which indicates the possibility of photo-induced electron transfer from the cyanine dyes to C60.
The reduction and oxidation (redox) potentials of the cyanine–fullerene dyads (1a–b), pristine cyanine (6a–b) and fulleropyrrolidine (3) were determined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 4) and the data are shown in Table 1. The reduction or oxidation potential for each couple peaks are calculated according to E = (Epc + Epa)/2, where Epc is the cathodic peak potential and Epa is the anodic peak potential.15
 Fig. 4  The cyclic voltammetry of fulleropyrrolidines (3), cyanine (6a–b) and cyanine–fullerene dyad (1a–b). 
In the range of −1.5 to 1.5 V, fulleropyrrolidine 3 shows two reversible reduction peaks at −0.62 V and −1.00 V. The pristine cyanine dye, 6a (or 6b), shows one quasi-reversible oxidation peak at 1.27 V (1.20 V for 6b) and one quasi-reversible reduction peak at −0.88 V (−0.88 V for 6b), while the dyad 1a (or 1b) shows three quasi-reversible reduction peaks at −0.61 V, −0.89 V and −1.01 V (−0.62 V, −0.91 V and −1.01 V for 1b), as well as one oxidation peak at 1.27 V (1.21 V for 1b). The cyanine–fullerene dyad (1a–b) and cyanine (6a–b) also exhibit shoulders in the oxidation region that are different from the main oxidation peaks and the reason for this is not clear yet.
On comparing these data, it appears that the redox potentials obtained for cyanine–fullerene dyads (1a–b) are precisely a combination of the values measured for fulleropyrrolidine (3) and pristine cyanine (6a–b). This means that the covalent linkage between the donor and the acceptor has not significantly altered the energy levels of cyanine and C60. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the cyanine is about 0.3 eV higher than that of fulleropyrrolidine, thus photo-induced electron transfer from the cyanine dye to the fullerene is energetically favorable. The strong fluorescence quenching in cyanine–fullerene dyads 1a and 1b is due to photo-induced electron transfer from the cyanine to C60.
Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the dyads, we chose cyanine–fullerene dyad 1b because of its good film-forming properties. Single layer devices with architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1b/Al) were fabricated. The absorption and IPCE spectra of the device are shown in Fig. 5. The film made from dyad 1b shows two obvious absorption peaks at 558 nm and 600 nm when spin coated from chlorobenzene solution, which we have attributed to the main absorption band and corresponding vibration band, respectively. Compared to the absorption in dichloromethane solution, the absorption peaks of the films are red-shifted by 11 nm and 20 nm, respectively. The relative intensity and the width of the peaks in the film are also different from those in dichloromethane solution. The difference between the solution and film spectra is due to a combination of solid state effects, amongst which the formation of small cyanine aggregates as well as the polarity of the organic solid are likely to play a dominant role.

The IPCE spectrum of the single layer device shows a “in phase” correlation to the absorption spectrum of the cyanine, indicating that charge carriers are generated within the bulk of the film under excitation by light. The maximum IPCE value of the device reaches 6%, which is higher than that of our previous cyanine/C60 two layer device.10 The increased photocurrent yield in the blue spectral region is due to photo-carriers generated by C60.16 The small IPCE feature at about 750 nm is assigned to the absorption of fulleropyrrolidine, as the cyanine has no absorption in this region.
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the single layer devices in the dark and under irradiation at different intensities are shown in Fig. 6. A tungsten lamp was used as white light source. The device shows good diode behavior in the dark with rectification ratios of 287 at ±1 V, which implies that the device does not have short circuit problem. When the irradiation intensity was increased from 0.31 mW cm−2 to 310 mW cm−2, the open circuit voltages (Voc) of the device increase from 0.18 V to 0.33 V, but the short circuit current increases in a sub-linear way. Clearly, the photo-current density in the device is not proportional to the irradiation intensity. The fill factor and conversion efficiency of the single layer devices is extremely low. Such behavior is usually found when the photodiode has a high series resistance. This resistance could been introduced at the aluminium cathode interface due to thermal degradation of the cyanine during thermal evaporation of the metal electrode. In order to avoid this problem, we have added a 40 nm thick C60 layer between the cathode and the cyanine–dyad layer such that diodes with (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1b/C60/Al) architecture were obtained.
 Fig. 6  Current–voltage characteristics under different white light irradiation intensities for the single layer device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1b/Al). The inset in the figure shows the current–voltage characteristics in the dark. 
As shown in Fig. 7, the open circuit voltage of the double layer device increased from 0.18 V to 0.33 V with increasing irradiation intensity, which is similar to a single layer device. However, the short circuit current and fill factor were much higher than those measured for single layer devices. Under white light excitation of 310 mW cm−2, the short-circuit current density reaches 1.2 mA cm−2 and the conversion efficiency is 0.041%. At lower light intensity, the efficiency exceeds 0.1%. We have attributed the better performance of the double layer device both to the protective effect of the C60 layer during cathode deposition and the advantageous interface formation between C60 and aluminium. The extremely low open circuit voltage for single and double layer devices can not be reasonably explained at this stage. Possibly, the formation of small cyanine aggregates leads to a distribution of energy levels that reduces the open circuit voltage. Further optimization of the device fabrication is needed to improve the open circuit voltage and short circuit current in order to increase the efficiency.

4. Conclusion
We have synthesized two novel cyanine–fullerene dyads by means of the Prato reaction and studied their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. The fluorescence of the cyanine–fullerene dyads was efficiently quenched as compared to the pristine cyanine. The redox potentials of the dyads show that photo-induced electron transfer from the cyanine dye to C60 is energetically favorable. By inserting a C60 layer between the dyad and Al, the short circuit current and fill factor were significantly improved when compared with the single layer device. The power conversion efficiency for the double layer device exceeds 0.1% at low irradiation intensity, indicating that cyanine–fullerene dyads reported here are promising materials for photovoltaic devices.
