    , Accepted 10th November 2017First published on 11th November 2017AbstractThe molecular design strategy for high-performance photoelectric materials emphasizes the intrinsic charge transfer/transport as well as the role of the polymer chemical structure and chain conformation. Here, we report a new interface engineering strategy for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) by employing highly conductive polyelectrolyte interface layers with a fluorinated conjugated backbone. The fluorine atom-induced strong n-type self-doping effect and optimized expanded conformation were observed to substantially improve their intrinsic charge mobility. An outstanding power conversion efficiency of 11.51% was obtained when applying the new polyelectrolyte interlayer in PSCs based on a PBDB-T:ITIC active layer.
1. Introduction
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are a class of macromolecules which are defined by π-conjugated backbones, coupled with pendant ionic functional groups on the side chains. As previously reported,1,2 CPEs possess the optical and charge transport properties of organic semiconductors; thus their physical properties can be fine-tuned by electrostatic interactions. In recent years, CPEs have attracted a large amount of attention because of these unique properties.3 The ionic groups on the side chain4–6 not only render CPEs soluble in environment-friendly polar solvents (e.g., methanol, water, etc.), but also further enable multilayer stacking without intermixing with adjacent material layers in the organic devices. Furthermore, the π-conjugated backbones display the characteristics of delocalized electronic structures,7–9 which endow CPE materials with semiconducting and light-harvesting properties, beneficial to the improvement of charge transport. Therefore, CPEs have been regarded as one of the most efficient types of electron injection or extraction layers between neutral organic layers and electrodes to improve charge transport in a wide range of applications, including improving the charge carrier mobility in field-effect transistors (OFETs),10 light emission efficiency in light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),11 and power conversion efficiency in polymer solar cells (PSCs),12–14 to cite just a few applications.
The backbone and side chain of CPEs can both exert great influence on their photoelectric properties.15–17 Great efforts have been made to understand the impact of polar side chains on the photoelectric properties of conjugated electrolytes,18–20 but only a limited number of studies have aimed at optimizing the π-conjugation backbone to improve the film microstructure and charge transport in CPEs.21 Compared to the traditional non-conjugated polymer electrolytes or p-type CPEs, n-type CPEs (n-CPEs) have superior electron transport properties.22,23 Apart from the dependence of the charge mobility/conductivity on the chemical polarity, the conformation and conjugation degree of the chain also have a significant impact on the properties.24 By increasing the co-planarity of the polymer backbone with a suitably expanded conformation, charge-transport along the backbone and inter-chain hopping can be greatly enhanced.
Since efficient charge transport is critical for obtaining high-efficiency organic electronic devices, recently, p-type or n-type doping has received more and more attention as a method to improve the charge transport of organic semiconductors.25–30 Doping is a charge transfer process, which occurs via admixing of organic semiconductors or organic molecules, resulting in high electron affinity or low ionization potential.31,32 Molecular doping via the introduction of free charge carriers (holes or electrons) into the valence or conduction band can markedly increase the carrier density and electrical conductivity in organic semiconductors.33 For example, ionic functional groups in CPEs were found to be able to regulate the concentration of the relevant p-type doping.27 However, compared to the advance of p-type doping strategies, the progress made in n-type doping has been limited, due to the low electron affinities of organic semiconductors (3 to 4 eV). Besides, n-type doped organic semiconductor materials have thus far been obtained by introducing extrinsic dopants, but the majority of these extrinsic dopants were unstable in ambient conditions.34 Recently, an attractive n-type self-doping strategy was demonstrated, based on introducing electron-rich moieties into electron-deficient organic semiconductors, where the dopants were attached to the host by covalent or ionic bonds.35,36
Among the n-type CPE materials, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based CPEs have attracted the most interest,37,38 due to their strong electron-withdrawing property and strongly interacting planar structure. Besides, the two amide and two aromatic groups of DPP can allow the polymers to be readily modified with different functional or substituent groups.39 In our previous studies, we have reported a series of conjugated electrolytes based on DPP, which exhibited excellent performance as electron transfer layers (ETLs) for fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PSCs).15,22,35 With a power conversion efficiency (PCE) >13%,40 a recently developed non-fullerene PSC showed a great potential for further advancing organic photovoltaic technology. However, systematic studies of the interfacial behavior of the CPEs in non-fullerene PSCs and their contributions to the device properties have rarely been reported.
Herein, three novel cationic n-CPEs based on DPP, namely, poly-2,5-bis-(6-bromo-hexyl)-3-thiophen-2-yl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-1,4-phenylene (PDPPTPT-N+Br−), poly-2,5-bis-(6-bromo-hexyl)-3-thiophen-2-yl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene (PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−), and poly-2,5-bis-(6-bromo-hexyl)-3-thiophen-2-yl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-alt-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-phenylene (PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−), were designed and synthesized by direct C–H arylation polymerization (DArP) (as shown in Scheme S1†). In the new CPEs, fluorine (F) atoms were introduced into the backbone to manipulate the photoelectron properties. As is well known, the F atom not only has a small atomic size (van der Waals radius, r = 1.35 Å, only slightly larger than hydrogen, r = 1.2 Å), but also has the highest Pauling electro-negativity of any element, 4.0.41 Thus, the electron-deficient F atom on the conjugated backbone in CPEs can affect the radical cation–anion coupling, which improves the conductivity. These n-CPEs all have the same quaternary ammonium pendants on the side chain, and differ only by the numbers of F atoms on the backbone. The three different bridging groups (benzene, 2,5-difluorobenzene, and tetrafluorobenzene groups) in the n-CPEs were found to significantly tune the doping concentration, film microstructure, and charge transport properties. Intriguingly, the photovoltaic performances were gradually improved with increasing numbers of F atoms incorporated into the electron transfer layers in the PSCs. An outstanding PCE of 11.51% was achieved by a non-fullerene PSC based on poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T): 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC).
2. Results and discussion
The molecular structures of the three n-CPEs PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− in this work are presented in Fig. 1. The synthetic routes to them are provided in Scheme S1.† As seen in the figures, the conjugated backbones of the three n-CPEs were alternately composed of DPP and benzene or fluorinated benzene where the substitution ratios of the F atoms (PDPPTPT-N+Br−:PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−:PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− = 0:2:4) could be readily adjusted by feeding the different congeners 1,4-diiodobenzene, 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene and 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The neutral precursor polymers PDPPTPT-Br, PDPPTPf2T-Br and PDPPTPf4T-Br were prepared by DArP. The DArP reaction by directly activating C–H bonds with palladium catalyst has emerged as a sustainable polymerization approach for synthesizing a variety of π-conjugated polymers.42,43 It needs fewer reaction steps and produces less toxic byproducts than conventional cross-couplings. The three copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform. The final blue-black solids isolated from chloroform were soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The molecular weight and poly-dispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1.† The purification of each polymer yielded similar number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PDPPTPT-Br (15.43 kg mol−1), PDPPTPf2T-Br (17.74 kg mol−1) and PDPPTPf4T-Br (13.29 kg mol−1) with PDIs of 2.18, 1.80 and 1.59, respectively. Then, the cationic functionalized pendants were introduced by post-polymerization quaternization with trimethylamine. Due to the existence of the ammonium salt polar pendant groups, the finally obtained three ionized n-CPEs PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− were soluble in environmentally friendly solvents such as water, methyl alcohol and alcohol, which would be very beneficial for further green processing. The detailed synthesis methods and related structural characterizations by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis are presented in the ESI Fig. S2–S6.†

In addition, schematic illustration of n-type self-doping effect in three n-CPEs by incorporating increasing numbers of F atoms, and plausible model of dipole formation between n-CPEs and ITO. 
Fig. S8† and Fig. 2 show the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the three n-CPEs. As clearly seen in Fig. 2a, the F (1s) peaks of PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− appeared at 687.13 and 686.63 eV, whereas there was no fluorine peak in PDPPTPT-N+Br−. Comparing PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− with PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−, the peak of F (1s) was shifted to a lower binding energy in the former, resulting from the higher negative charge density as the number of F atoms increased. Fig. 2b displays the O (1s) peaks from ITO toward PDPPTPT-N+Br− (530.60 eV), PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (530.13 eV), and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (529.62 eV), which were respectively shifted to a lower binding energy by 0.23, 0.70 and 1.21 eV relative to bare ITO (530.83 eV), indicative of the electrostatic interaction between the n-CPEs and the bare ITO. Similar shift trends of the Sn (3d) and In (3d) in the XPS spectra of ITO modified by the three n-CPEs are also observed in Fig. 2c and d, indicating the strong electrostatic interaction in the ITO/n-CPEs.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− in films had similar optical absorption peaks in the visible range, on account of the characteristic absorbance of π–π stacked layers in the backbones. However, as the number of F atoms increased, the maximum absorption wavelength of PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− exhibited more obviously red-shifted absorption in comparison with PDPPTPT-N+Br− in the films. This indicated that the intermolecular interaction of the π-conjugation skeleton was reinforced by introducing F atoms in the n-CPEs. Surprisingly, all of them had absorbance peaks around 1000 nm, and the absorbance of PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− gradually improved with the increasing number of F atoms. We speculated that the n-CPEs underwent radical cation–anion coupling, and yielded n-type self-doping. This relied on the electron-withdrawing conjugated backbone, which stabilized the ammonium cations through cation-π interactions. Moreover, to investigate the possible presence of polarons, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test was carried out.44 As plotted in Fig. 3b, we observed variation in the degrees of signal intensity: especially, PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−, with the highest loading of F atoms on the backbone, showed the highest signal intensity compared with PDPPTPT-N+Br− and PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−. The EPR signal intensity was proportional to the doping concentrations of the n-CPEs. Consequently, the trend in the EPR intensity was consistent with that in the UV-vis absorption spectra of the films (Fig. 3a). It was observed that all three n-CPEs underwent the n-type self-doped effect, and as the numbers of F atoms increased, the conjugated backbone became more electron-deficient, and the corresponding self-doping effect was thereby strengthened. According to the oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammetry45 (CV) curves (see Fig. S9†), the ionization potential (IP) and the electron affinity (EA) of the three n-CPEs were calculated, and are given in Table S2.† The IP and EA were 5.04 eV and 3.79 eV for PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−, 4.98 eV and 3.68 eV for PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−, and 4.95 eV and 3.60 eV for PDPPTPT-N+Br−, respectively. PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− possessed the largest EA (corresponding to the lowest LUMO energy level), indicating that it had a higher tendency to be reduced.46 Therefore, this further validated the conclusion that PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− was equipped with the strongest self-doping ability. In addition, the CV-determined energy gap (Ec0) values were consistent with those determined by optical absorption (Eoptg) according to the UV-vis absorption spectra.

To explore how the F atoms of the conjugated backbone affected the interfacial properties of the ITO/n-CPEs, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy47 (UPS) measurements of n-CPEs films spin-coated on ITO were performed to estimate the variation in work function (WF). The UPS spectra of ITO/PDPPTPT-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−, and the bare ITO are shown in Fig. 3c. With increasing numbers of F atoms on the conjugated backbone, the secondary cutoff (13–15 eV) of the n-CPE-covered ITO electrodes successively shifted to higher binding energies, indicating a monotonic decrease in the effective WF of the ITO. The calculated UPS data are presented in Table S3.† In comparison with bare ITO48 (4.7 eV), the WF of ITO/PDPPTPT-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and ITO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− were reduced to 4.52 eV, 4.31 eV and 4.18 eV, respectively. It could be clearly observed that the effective WF of the ITO gradually decreased with the increasing incorporation of F atoms in the n-CPEs (see Fig. S10†). The gradual change in WF was attributed to the formation of an interfacial bi-dipole effect at the ITO/n-CPEs interface, as illustrated in Fig. 1. When ITO was covered with PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−, the ionic pendant group of the n-CPEs could spontaneously induce electrostatic dipoles (μID), which comprised two point charges.49 More importantly, the n-type self-doping effect of the n-CPEs yielded new dipoles (μPD) with the direction pointing out of the ITO, which strongly enhanced the overall dipole moment (μD = μID + μPD). These results are consistent with the observation reported in the literature that the interfacial dipoles could be strengthened by doping.50 Furthermore, the strength of the polaron-induced dipoles is in proportion to the concentration of self-doping. Therefore, control over the interfacial dipoles was expected to be achieved by tuning the numbers of F atoms on the conjugated backbone via different doping concentrations. Kelvin probe microscopy further confirmed the effective changes in WF of the n-CPEs-covered ITO electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3d. The variation trend in the WF of ITO covered with PDPPTPT-N+Br− (4.58 eV), PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (4.37 eV), and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (4.22 eV) correlated well with the UPS results.
Generally, minimizing conformational and structural disorder as well as ensuring a high degree of short-range intermolecular interactions are the crucial factors to design high-mobility polymers.51,52 F atoms can induce strong inter- and intra-molecular interactions, which play an important role in ensuring a solid-state polymer organization with better co-planarity.53 The torsional angles (φ) of one repeating unit of each of the three n-CPEs have been calculated by density functional theory (DFT).54 As shown in Fig. 4, the torsional angles between the thiophene and the phenylene were quite different among the three n-CPEs. In contrast to PDPPTPT-N+Br− (φ = 27.56°), the φ of PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− were greatly decreased to 23.73° and 10.32°, as presented in Fig. 4a and c, respectively, due to the highly rigid skeleton created by introducing fluorine atoms. The torsional angles of all three n-CPEs were well within the limiting value of 30° that is required for the co-planarity of the chain backbone to induce enough intra-molecular π-overlap to generate an efficient conduction band.55 PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− had the smallest calculated φ among the three n-CPEs, giving distinct evidence that PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− had the highest co-planarity, which would be favorable for π–π stacking and contribute to better charge transport properties (Fig. 5).

To further investigate the topography of the n-CPEs as a function of the incorporation of F atoms on the conjugated backbone, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to explore the morphology of bare ITO, ITO/PDPPTPT-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−, and ITO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of bare ITO was 5.01 nm (Fig. S11†). As shown in Fig. 4, after spin-coating the n-CPEs on the ITO, the RMS of ITO/PDPPTPT-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and ITO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− decreased to 4.13 nm, 3.80 nm, and 2.59 nm, respectively. It was clear that the surface of all three n-CPEs became smoother in contrast with the bare ITO, and with increasing numbers of F atoms on the conjugated backbone, the films became more homogeneous. This can be attributed to the improved co-planarity of the n-CPEs after introducing F atoms on the conjugated backbone. Additionally, the contact angles were measured to investigate the surface hydrophilicity property of bare ITO and the three n-CPEs spin-coated on the ITO. From Fig. S12,† the contact angles of the bare ITO, ITO/PDPPTPT-N+Br−, ITO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br−, and ITO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− were 30.1°, 43.8°, 52.1° and 70.1°, respectively. Clearly, the deposition of the three n-CPEs made the ITO surfaces more hydrophobic, due to the hydrophobic F atoms. The hydrophobic property of ITO/n-CPEs would afford a more favorable contact with the upper active layer for inverted PSC devices.
For PSCs, the ease of charge carrier injection/collection plays a significant role in improving the efficiency of the devices, and is strongly related to the interfacial properties between the organic active layer and the electrode (cathode or anode).56 We evaluated the electron-transporting properties of PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− as ETLs in PSC devices with the inverted structure of glass/ITO/n-CPEs/active layer/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1. The details of the device fabrication process are provided in the ESI.† Furthermore, for comparison, AZO57,58 (Al-doped ZnO), which has high conductivity, was also employed as an ETL in reference devices. Owing to the ionic nature of the side chain, the n-CPEs had good solubility in methyl alcohol; the side chain seemed to provide a bridge between inorganic ITO and the organic active layer. Furthermore, all the n-CPEs showed satisfactory optical transmittance up to 80% (shown in Fig. S13†). Therefore, the absorption of photons by the n-CPEs was negligible, and these n-CPEs were suitable as interlayers.
Firstly, a typical device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was fabricated to evaluate the validity of these n-CPEs as interlayers. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on a P3HT:PC61BM active layer with n-CPEs as the ETLs are shown in Fig. S14a,† and the detailed photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. As we can observe from this diagram, all the devices with n-CPEs as ETLs exhibited substantial enhancement compared to the reference devices. The PCE gradually improved from 3.0% for AZO to 3.3% for PDPPTPT-N+Br− (thickness ∼30 nm), 3.4% for PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (thickness ∼32 nm), and 3.6% for PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (thickness ∼32 nm) with the numbers of F atoms increasing on the conjugated backbone. Furthermore, the improved PCE was ascribed to the simultaneously enhanced device parameters Jsc, FF and Voc. The alterations to the surface wettability and morphology of the ITO electrode by covering with n-CPEs (Fig. S12† and Fig. 4) resulted in an upper active layer with a smooth surface, which contributed to the Jsc and FF value enhancement. The device with PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− as the ETL exhibited the highest Voc, resulting from the dramatic reduction of the ITO work-function caused by the interfacial bi-dipole effect. The enhanced currents of the devices based on n-CPE ETLs were also confirmed by measurement of the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. S14b†) and the greatest suppression of leakage current in the dark J–V curves (Fig. S14c†).

In general, n-doping can increase the carrier density and electrical conductivity of materials.59 Therefore, the influence of the three n-CPEs on the electron transportation was further investigated by fabricating electron-only devices based on P3HT:PC61BM blends using a structure composed of ITO/n-CPEs/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The J–V characteristics were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model according to the Mott–Gurney equation law.60 As plotted in Fig. 6a and summarized in Table S4,† the electron mobility of the electron-only device with AZO was 3.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and that with PDPPTPT-N+Br− was 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, due to the intense self-doping effect of PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− caused by introducing F atoms on the backbone, gradual improvements in the electron mobility to 5.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed, respectively, even the PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (1.68 × 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1) is more than one order of magnitude over that of AZO (3.61 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1). We further evaluated the conductivity of PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−. As depicted in Fig. 6b, after insertion of the different n-CPEs between ITO and Au, PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− with the highest self-doping displayed superior conductivity (8.87 × 10−4 S cm−1) over PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (5.31 × 10−4 S cm−1), PDPPTPT-N+Br− (2.58 × 10−4 S cm−1), and AZO (3.27 × 10−4 S cm−1). Generally, n-type self-doping resulting from counter anions induces a partial electron transfer to the backbone, in which counter anions have been proposed to act as sacrificial electron donors. The high radical anion concentration in the conjugated backbone led to high conductivity. Therefore, the high electron mobility and conductivity of PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− mainly derived from the n-type self-doping character favored by F induced electron transfer.

To verify the universality of the PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− interlayers, inverted PSC devices based on the narrow band gap polymer polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithio-phene (PTB7) blended with (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were also fabricated. However, the HOMO level of PTB7 (−5.2 eV) is much lower than that of P3HT (−5.0 eV), making the n-CPEs unable to efficiently block the hole transfer and resulting in charge recombination at the interface. The devices with n-CPE mono-layers only showed very low efficiency. Therefore, we employed AZO/n-CPEs as a bi-interlayer in the ITO/AZO/n-CPEs/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag devices to produce a better energy alignment for more efficient hole blocking. The corresponding J–V characteristics and device parameters of the devices with AZO/n-CPEs interlayer are summarized in Fig. 7a and Table 1, respectively. As expected, the same trend as the P3HT-based active layer was observed: a prominent PCE of 8.68% (Jsc = 16.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.73 V, FF = 70.7%) with AZO/PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (thickness ∼15 nm) as ETL was realized. This device performance showed a great improvement in comparison to the devices based on bare AZO (7.62%), AZO/PDPPTPT-N+Br− (thickness ∼12 nm) (8.36%), and AZO/PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (thickness ∼14 nm) (8.57%). The notable efficiency of the device with the PTB7:PC71BM blend was mainly attributed to the overall improved device parameters. We also found that after PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− as ETLs were inserted, the roughness of the active layer surface decreased gradually (as shown in Fig. S15†). The EQE curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−-based device showed the highest EQE value of 75%, which was recorded at 490 nm. The integrated current density of PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− was 16.44 mA cm−2, 16.58 mA cm−2 and 16.62 mA cm−2, respectively, which matched with the corresponding Jsc values from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 7a) within 0.5% error. These results indicated that the three n-CPEs have good universality for PSCs based on narrow band gap polymer active layers.

With the development of the fullerene-based PSCs in the past few years, the LUMO level of fullerene has proven difficult to modify, which has limited the performance enhancement of PSCs. Recently, the PCEs of non-fullerene PSCs have been boosted up to 13%,40 representing great potential for further photovoltaic technology. Here, we also applied the three n-CPEs in non-fullerene PSCs using PBDB-T (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]) as a donor and ITIC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene)61 as an acceptor with the inverted device structure ITO/AZO/n-CPEs/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. The corresponding J–V characteristics and device parameters are summarized in Fig. 7c and Table 1. The device parameters Voc, Jsc and FF of the most efficient devices were 0.88 V, 17.92 mA cm−2 and 72.9%, respectively, yielding an outstanding PCE of 11.51% with PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− interlayer. In addition, decent PCEs of 11.24% and 10.66% were also obtained for the devices based on PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPT-N+Br−, respectively. Similarly, the three n-CPEs also favored more uniform morphology, especially for PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− with the highest F loading (Fig. S16†). The EQE spectra are displayed in Fig. 7d. All Jsc values calculated from the EQEs, for PDPPTPT-N+Br− (16.68 mA cm−2), PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− (17.12 mA cm−2), and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− (17.44 mA cm−2), were quite consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curves. Evidently, the devices with PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− showed the highest EQE values at 400–700 nm among these interlayers, which also contributed to the Jsc enhancement. Highly conductive thick interlayers are essential for the large-area manufacturing of PSCs, so we further examined the influence of the three n-CPEs as interlayers with various thicknesses on the performance of the PSCs. The J–V characteristics of the devices are provided in Fig. 8 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S5.† Very impressively, the PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br− interlayers retained over 90% of the value of the PCEs at a thickness of nearly 30 nm, which was attributed to the high electron mobility of the three n-CPEs. Therefore, based on their insensitivity to thickness, the three n-CPEs should be applicable to achieve high-performance devices without affecting the electron extraction property at the cathode interface.

3. Conclusions
To summarize, a series of DPP-based conjugated polyelectrolytes (PDPPTPT-N+Br−, PDPPTPf2T-N+Br− and PDPPTPf4T-N+Br−) with different numbers of F atoms on the backbone were designed and synthesized. By incorporation of electron-deficient F substituents onto the conjugated backbone, an increasing concentration of n-type self-doping was observed. As the substitution number of F atoms increased, the π-delocalized coplanar structure and the film morphology of the three n-CPEs was distinctly promoted. Through the combination of the n-type self-doping effect with planar structure, a high charge transport was obtained in these n-CPEs. Subsequently, a prominent PCE value as high as 11.51% was achieved for PSC devices containing these n-CPEs as ETLs. These findings indicated that the simple incorporation of “fluorine” substituents not only produces highly conductive electrolytes, but opens an avenue for the rational design of highly efficient electrolyte interlayer materials.
