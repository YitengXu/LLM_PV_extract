    , Accepted 28th February 2023First published on 1st March 2023AbstractPoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of its excellent hole transport capability and simple preparation process. According to theoretical studies, a thinner PEDOT:PSS HTL allows more incident light to enter the perovskite layer. However, the PEDOT:PSS HTL prepared by the traditional deposition process has some limitations, such as the thick HTL, abundant defects at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface, etc. Is there a preparation process that can achieve the thinning and modification of the PEDOT:PSS HTL in one-step process at the same time? In this work, inspired by the semiconductor etching process, an eco-friendly solvent etching technique is applied during the spin-coating process to fabricate an ultrathin PEDOT:PSS HTL and simultaneously introduce a green passivator (polyethylene glycol, PEG) as the bridge molecule on the HTL upper surface. In this process, the green PEG aqueous etchant can etch the excess bulk PEDOT:PSS away to form an ultrathin PEDOT:PSS HTL with PEG molecules and rich PEDOT domains remained on its surface (PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL). This well-designed HTL is successfully thinned to enhance its light transmission and can be better matched with the Sn–Pb perovskite layer. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of Sn–Pb PSCs using the PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL is improved from 20.52% of the reference to 21.58%, and the stability of Sn–Pb PSCs is dramatically enhanced as well.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties such as tunable energy band, good absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility, and long carrier lifetime.1–6 Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction Pb based PSCs has grown from 3.8% (ref. 7) to 25.7%,8 which shows their huge commercial potential. Nowadays, environmentally friendly regulations force researchers to replace or reduce the use of toxic lead, while tin (Sn) is an ideal alternative due to its low toxicity and the suitable band gap of Sn-based perovskites.9,10 According to the Shockley–Queisser limit,11 Sn–Pb PSCs with bandgaps of 1.1–1.4 eV (ref. 12–14) can deliver higher PCE than pure Pb PSCs theoretically. In addition, all-perovskite tandem solar cells composed of Sn–Pb PSCs and wide-bandgap PSCs15–20 have higher PCE (∼28.0% (ref. 8)) than single-junction PSCs. Therefore, research on efficient and stable Sn–Pb PSCs is of great value and has attracted extensive interest.
At present, high-efficiency Sn–Pb PSCs typically adopt inverted structures, in which the efficiency and stability are mainly affected by the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL). Generally, in order to improve the performance of Sn–Pb PSCs, additives such as tin powder,17 GuaSCN,18 formamidine sulfinic acid,19 SnF2,21 ethylenediamine22 and 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid23 are intentionally added into the Sn–Pb perovskite precursor solution to optimize the crystallization of the Sn–Pb perovskite layer and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+. Besides, although the HTLs used in Sn–Pb PSCs include NiOx,23,24 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),12,25,26 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)27,28 and [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl) ethyl] phosphonic acid (2PACz),29 PEDOT:PSS is the preferred choice owing to its excellent hole transport performance, good processibility, high thermal stability and good mechanical properties.30–34 However, disadvantages of PEDOT:PSS have been noted in many reports. First, the thick PEDOT:PSS layer prepared by the traditional spin coating process will form double refraction between the bottom electrode and the perovskite layer, which is not conducive for light to reach the perovskite layer. Second, there are many interface defects between the PEDOT:PSS layer and perovskite layer, which greatly hinder carrier extraction. Third, abundant active protons that come from the PSS of the PEDOT:PSS film diffuse into the perovskite to decompose the perovskite, which is harmful to the long-term stability of the device.35,36
To overcome these issues, one of the strategies is to intentionally add additives such as CuSCN,37 sodium citrate38 and polyethylene glycol (PEG)39,40 into the precursor of PEDOT:PSS to reduce the protons of PSS, but it does not improve the optical performance significantly. The other one is to insert a bridge-layer such as iso-pentylammonium tetrafluoroborate ([PNA]BF4)41 and PEG molecules42 between the PEDOT:PSS layer and perovskite layer, which can not only reduce the impact of PEDOT:PSS on the perovskite layer, but also passivate interface defects. Although good results have been achieved, this strategy adds complexity to industrial production and provides only limited improvement in optical performance. Optical simulation analysis has proved that a thick PEDOT:PSS layer would form double reflection, which is not conducive to optical transmission.43 So reducing the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer has been innovatively proposed as a new strategy. Thin PEDOT:PSS HTLs are intentionally prepared by solvent dilution (diluted with deionized water or other solvents),26,44 post-treatment (solvent washing)45–47 or soaking processes43 to enhance the performance of inverted PSCs. However, since the surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of ITO is about 3–4 nm, the spin coated PEDOT:PSS film with a precursor of excessive dilution ratio will unfortunately form undesirable holes, which cause severe recombination of carriers. Although post-treatment and soaking processes result in an ultrathin HTL without holes, they provide limited improvements to subsequent perovskite formation and increase additional process steps and time. In addition, the soaking process tends to affect other underneath functional layers as well when used to fabricate all-perovskite tandem solar cells.
So far, there is still no ideal solution that simultaneously addresses all the multiply complex problems affecting the optics, electricity and perovskite crystallization on the PEDOT:PSS HTL. In fact, the redundant bulk PEDOT:PSS in the thick PEDOT:PSS film has little effect on improving the performance of inverted PSCs, while the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS film can achieve the ideal optical transmission. In addition, the defects at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface also affect the charge transfer, thus limiting the perovskite performance. Therefore, it is very urgent to develop new compatible processes and improve the PCE of devices at the same time for the industrialization prospect of inverted PSCs.
In this work, inspired by the semiconductor etching process, we creatively introduce an eco-friendly solvent etching technique into a one-step spin coating process to fabricate an ultrathin PEDOT:PSS HTL with a passivated functional surface. Herein, PEG, a widely reported green material, is selected as both the etchant and passivator. The excess bulk PEDOT:PSS in the conventional spin coating process is etched using the PEG aqueous etchant to fabricate an ultrathin PEG-modified PEDOT:PSS HTL (PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL). After etching, PEG and more PEDOT domains on the surface can tune the work function of the HTL for better energy level matching. Meanwhile, the C–O–C bonds of PEG on the HTL interact with Pb2+ in the perovskite layer to passivate defects and promote perovskite crystallization. After using PEG-PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the champion PCE of device is increased to 21.58% from 20.52% of the reference. Furthermore, the stability of the device is improved from 60% of the initial value in the reference to about 75% of the initial value in the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device after storage in a nitrogen glove box (temperature around 20 °C, H2O content ≤ 0.1 ppm, O2 content ≤ 10 ppm) for 1300 h. By introducing a solvent etching technique and selecting an appropriate functionalized etchant, the thinning and modification strategies of PEDOT:PSS are simultaneously realized during the spin coating process, which basically solves all the above-mentioned problems (optics, electricity and perovskite crystallization).

Stannous iodide (SnI2 99.99%) was obtained from Energy Chemical & 3A materials. Polyethylene glycol (PEG-200, 400, 1000, 6000) was purchased from Aladdin. All the above chemicals were used directly without further purification.
2.2 Solution preparation

2.2.1 PEG solution. 
PEG was dissolved in deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) to prepare 2.0 mg mL−1 solution. Then, it was placed on a shaker overnight and then diluted to obtain 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg mL−1 PEG solutions, respectively.


2.2.2 HTL solution. 
According to the work of Yao et al.26,43 diluted PEDOT:PSS had good hole transport properties. Thus, commercial PEDOT:PSS diluted with water at the ratio of 1:6 (v/v) under ambient conditions (D6-PEDOT:PSS solution) was selected as the reference.


2.2.3 Perovskite precursor solution. 
A perovskite precursor (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 with a band gap of 1.25 eV was used in this work. SnI2 (447 mg), SnF2 (18.8 mg), Sn powder (5 mg), PbI2 (368.8 mg), Pb(SCN)2 (25.9 mg), FAI (206.4 mg) and MAI (127.2 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO = 4:1). The precursor solution was placed on a shaker overnight, and filtered with a PTFE filter (220 nm aperture) before spin coating.

2.3 Fabrication of solar cells

2.3.1 ITO substrate cleaning. 
The ITO glass was cleaned using an ultrasonic machine (40 kHz, 120 W) in mixed detergent (Decon 90:deionized water = 1:30) at 60 °C in a beaker, and then washed with deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) 5 times. High purity nitrogen was used to blow off excess water on the ITO surface to obtain a clean ITO substrate.


2.3.2 Fabrication of the HTL. 
A clean ITO substrate was placed on a spin coater, and 50 μL of D6-PEDOT:PSS solution was dropped onto the ITO surface, followed by a two-step spin coating method (300 rpm for 3 s, then 6000 rpm for 40 s). After the spin coating, the substrate was placed in a Petri dish and heated at 120 °C for 20 min to obtain the D6-PEDOT:PSS HTL. At the 15th s of the spin coating process, 30 μL PEG aqueous solution was added dropwise to etch excess bulk PEDOT:PSS, followed by heating at 120 °C for 20 min to acquire the PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL, as shown in Fig. 1a.

2.3.3 Fabrication of perovskite. 
After annealing, the substrate with the HTL was quickly transferred into a nitrogen glove box (temperature around 20 °C, H2O content ≤ 0.1 ppm, O2 content ≤ 10 ppm) for subsequent processing. The substrate was then spin-coated with 50 μL of the perovskite precursor solution by a two-step spin coating method (400 rpm for 3 s, then 5000 rpm for 40 s). After the start of spin coating, 200 μL antisolvent (chlorobenzene, CB) was added dropwise at the 25th s, resulting in a smooth and fully covered perovskite film. Then, the sample was heated at 50 °C for 2 min and further heated at 85 °C for 30 min.


2.3.4 ETL and contact electrode. 
Thermal evaporation was conducted by physical vapor deposition (PVD) to sequentially deposit 30 nm C60 (∼0.5 nm min−1), 7 nm BCP (∼0.3 nm min−1) and 120 nm Ag (∼4 nm min−1). The vacuum pressure was less than 2 × 10−5 Pa.

3. Results and discussion
The process for preparing the PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL is shown in Fig. 1a. First, 50 μL of D6-PEDOT:PSS solution is added to the clean ITO surface, and abundant PEDOT:PSS is adsorbed on the upper surface of ITO due to the electrostatic interaction between PEDOT:PSS and ITO. Second, a thick PEDOT:PSS film is initially formed on the ITO surface during the 15 s spin coating process. Then, dropping 30 μL of the PEG aqueous solution will instantly break the established equilibrium due to the physical dissolution effect, and then etch the excess bulk PEDOT:PSS away. It should be highlighted that the amount of etchant is very important to form the HTL without holes, and PEG-PSS interaction will destroy the electrostatic interaction between PEDOT and PSS.40 Finally, after the annealing process, a compact ultrathin PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL containing PEG and PEDOT-rich domains is formed, which is expected to improve its optical and electrical properties. The formation mechanism of PEG-PEDOT:PSS is schematically shown in Fig. 1b, which will be discussed in detail later.
The existence of PEG after solvent etching is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All peaks are calibrated by C 1s of XPS located at 284.80 eV (C–C) and the measured surveys of XPS are shown in Fig. S1.† As shown in the normalized C 1s spectra in Fig. 2a, the characteristic peak of PEG at 286.16 eV (C–O–C) can be clearly observed in pure PEG and the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film (etching by PEG-1000 of 0.75 mg mL−1), but not in D6-PEDOT:PSS (spin coating process) and WATER-PEDOT:PSS (solvent etching process without addition of PEG) films. After spin-coating the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film with organic solvents DMF and DMSO (PEG-PEDOT:PSS&SOLVENT), the characteristic peak of PEG is still present, which indicates that spin-coating of the perovskite precursor could not remove all PEG away (PEG does exist at the interface). Meanwhile, the change of In 3d peak intensity and position can also reflect the thickness reduction of the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the presence of PEG. As shown in Fig. 2b, the In 3d two peaks of bare ITO are at 444.36 and 451.92 eV respectively (black curve). After covered only with PEDOT:PSS (D6-PEDOT:PSS or WATER-PEDOT:PSS films), these two peaks shift to 444.67 and 452.28 eV (light and dark blue curves), but the intensity of the two peaks of the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film decreases less than that of the D6-PEDOT:PSS film, which suggests that the In element signal is increased after the etching process (that is, the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film is thinner). The two peaks of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film shift back to 444.56 and 452.16 eV (pink curve) relative to the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film but the peak intensity of the two samples is almost the same, indicating that the shift of peaks is due to the successful introduction of PEG and the film thicknesses are almost comparable. A similar peak shift can also be observed in Sn 3d spectra shown in Fig. 2c.

(d) Normalized and fitting S 2p spectra of the D6-PEDOT:PSS, WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films. 

Fig. 2d shows the normalized S 2p spectra, which exist only in PEDOT:PSS. Compared with the D6-PEDOT:PSS film, the relatively rough signals of WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films are explained by less PEDOT:PSS on the substrates. In addition, the two peaks at ∼164 and ∼168 eV can be assigned to PEDOT and PSS respectively. After normalizing the peak intensity of PSS at 168 eV, the peak intensity of PEDOT shows that WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films are almost the same, while the smallest intensity is observed for the D6-PEDOT:PSS film, indicating a higher content of PEDOT on the etched surface. PEDOT is conductive, which is one of the reasons why its carrier transport performance and work function change. As shown in Fig. S2,† the interaction between PEG and PEDOT:PSS is also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. After mixing PEG and PEDOT:PSS, the C–O–C bond of PEG (1108.1 cm−1) is red-shifted to 1105.5 cm−1, while the S–O bond of the sulfonic acid group (687.9 cm−1 (ref. 48)) is blue-shifted to 690.7 cm−1, which shows the existence of the hydrogen bonding between the C–O–C of PEG and the sulfonic acid group. Therefore, the results show that PEG does exist on the surface and connects to PSS via hydrogen bonding, supporting the mechanism proposed in Fig. 1b.
After the solvent etching process, the HTL surface will cause some effects obviously. The surface properties of ITO, D6-PEDOT:PSS, WATER-PEDOT:PSS, and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films are observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle (CA) measurements. It is worth noting that PSS and PEG are hydrophilic, while PEDOT is hydrophobic. As shown in Fig. 3a, the surface of ITO has clear grain boundaries, an RMS roughness of 3.17 nm and a CA of 41.2°. The surface topography of the D6-PEDOT:PSS film shows obvious polymer clusters, and the RMS roughness decreases to 1.52 nm, indicating that the thick PEDOT:PSS film remains on the surface. Meanwhile, the CA of the D6-PEDOT:PSS film drops to 16.3°, which is attributed to the large amount of hydrophilic SS on the surface (Fig. 3b). The surface morphology of the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film almost recovers to the ITO morphology and the RMS roughness changes to 1.77 nm, which indicate significant reduction of PEDOT:PSS. The CA of the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film increases to 24.1°, which indicates that there is a mass of hydrophobic PEDOT on the surface (Fig. 3c), consistent with the reported results.45 The surface morphology of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film is similar to that of the WATER-PEDOT:PSS film and the RMS roughness also changes to 2.18 nm, which also indicates that the PEDOT:PSS is significantly reduced. However, the CA of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film is further reduced to 13.4°, which is caused by the introduction of hydrophilic PEG onto the surface (Fig. 3d). Once the morphology has been known, it is important to confirm the thickness of the etched PEDOT:PSS film. In Fig. S3,† the thickness of In-PEDOT:PSS (the commercial PEDOT:PSS film by the spin coating process) is about 27.4 nm, while the thickness of the D6-PEDOT:PSS film is about 11.1 nm, which is consistent with other studies.43 However, due to the lower thickness of the WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films than the RMS roughness of the substrate, they cannot be distinguished. As shown in Fig. S4a and b,† conductive-AFM (C-AFM) is used to analyze the ultrathin WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films. After the solvent etching process, the surface conductivity is uniform with no current mutation points, indicating a compact film without pinholes. All the evidence shows that our solvent etching process succeeds in reducing the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS and introducing PEG on the surface as expected.

(e) Theoretical transmittance of PEDOT:PSS with different thicknesses in the Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS structure. (f) Actual measured transmittance of D6-PEDOT:PSS, WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films. 
Since the HTL is located at the light incident side, its high transmittance in the visible and near-infrared region is very important to obtain a high performance device. As shown in Fig. 3e, the transmittance of PEDOT:PSS films with different nanometer thicknesses is theoretically simulated by the transmission matrix method, and it is found that the thinner the film, the lower the transmittance at 400–500 nm. To verify this, the transmittances of D6-PEDOT:PSS, WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films are measured. Fig. 3f shows that the measured transmittances of WATER-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films at 400–500 nm are decreased relative to the D6-PEDOT:PSS film, which is consistent with the theoretical calculations and thus confirms the effectiveness of the solvent etching process.
In previous reports, the interaction between the C–O–C bond of PEG and Pb2+ in the perovskite has been verified.49–51 As shown in Fig. S5† by FTIR, the C–O–C bond (1108.1 cm−1) of pure PEG is red-shifted to 1100.6 cm−1 after adding PbI2, which is consistent with other studies. After the solution etching process, PEG on the surface of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film can interact with interfacial Pb2+ and promote the crystal growth of the perovskite. In Fig. 4a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite grown on D6-PEDOT:PSS and PEG-PEDOT:PSS films are compared. The (110), (113), (220), (122), (222) and (330) plane diffraction peaks of (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 respectively are located at 13.7°, 24.2°, 28.0°, 31.4°, 40.2° and 42.7°, corresponding to an orthorhombic lattice of the Amm2 space group, consistent with previous studies.12,22 As shown in Table S1†, the outstanding crystallinity of the perovskite grown on the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film is proved by the increased peak intensity and decreased half-peak width. From the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images shown in Fig. 4b and c, some pinholes can be observed on the perovskite film grown on the D6-PEDOT:PSS substrate, sharply in contrast with the compact film grown on the PEG-PEDOT:PSS substrate. As demonstrated in Fig. S6,† the average grain size of the perovskite increases statistically from 695.9 ± 249.4 (D6-PEDOT:PSS) to 742.3 ± 244.4 nm (PEG-PEDOT:PSS). More run-through perovskite grains can be obviously observed in the cross-sectional view of Fig. S7† with almost the same thickness of the two samples (Fig. S8†). The improved crystal quality of the perovskite can also be confirmed in the absorption curves (Fig. S9†).

(d) PL and (e) TRPL of perovskite films grown on different substrates. (f) Energy level diagram of different layers in devices. 
To understand the variation of perovskite defects, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are conducted. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PL peak intensity of Glass/ITO/PEG-PEDOT:PSS/Sn–Pb is slightly lower than that of Glass/ITO/D6-PEDOT:PSS/Sn–Pb near 1005 nm. The more PL quenching can be attributed to the better hole extraction capability, which is also verified by the TRPL presented in Fig. 4e. The average decay lifetime (τave) value of the perovskite film grown on the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film is 111.88 ns, less than that on the D6-PEDOT:PSS film (Table S2†, 133.97 ns). To exclude the possibility of PL quenching from the interface defects, PL of Quartz/Sn–Pb and Quartz/PEG/Sn–Pb is measured. The PL intensity of quartz/PEG/Sn–Pb is higher than that of Quartz/Sn–Pb near 1017 nm, suggesting that PEG can effectively promote the crystallization of the perovskite and reduce the defects. Due to more PEDOT and additional PEG on the surface of PEG-PEDOT:PSS, the wok function of the HTL may be altered. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum (UPS) shown in Fig. S10† gives values of the cut-off binding energy (Ecut-off) and Fermi edge (EF, edge), and the energy level arrangement diagram is obtained by simple calculation (Fig. 4f). Compared with the D6-PEDOT:PSS film, the PEG-PEDOT:PSS film has a better maximum of valence band (EVB) matching with the EVB of Sn–Pb perovskite, which reduces the voltage loss. The better energy alignment can produce a higher built-in potential (Vbi), which is also verified by the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics shown in Fig. S11.† Compared with the Vbi of the D6-PEDOT:PSS device (0.67 V), the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device whose structure shown in Fig. 5a has higher Vbi (0.72 V), explaining the improved Voc. From the above data, it is shown that the solution etching process not only changes its optical transmittance and electrical properties, but also introduces the bridge molecule PEG to passivate interface defects and improve crystal growth, which achieves our expected experimental goal.

It is found that the concentration of PEG in the etchant and its molecular weight play an important role in the performance of PSCs. We examine the impact of etching at different PEG-1000 concentrations (0 to 2 mg mL−1) on the device characteristics. All performance parameters show systematic improvement as the PEG-1000 concentration increases from 0 to 0.75 mg mL−1, followed by a decrease with a further increased concentration from 1 to 2 mg mL−1 (Table S3†). We also study the influence of PEG with different molecular weights on the performance. Using the same concentration (0.75 mg mL−1) of PEG solution with different molecular weights for etching, the device performance is the best when the PEG molecular weight is 1000 (Fig. S12†). In order to verify the doping effect of PEG-1000 on the perovskite precursor solution, different PEG concentrations are intentionally added to prepare the D6-PEDOT:PSS device. The results shown in Fig. S13† indicate that the trace PEG doping has little effect on the performance of the device. Since PEG is a non-conductive material, the charge transfer will be hindered with excessive PEG concentration.
As shown in Fig. 5b, after applying PEG-PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the champion PCE is 21.58% (Voc = 0.874 V, Jsc = 31.37 mA cm−2, FF = 78.75%). It is worth noting that compared with D6-PEDOT:PSS (Voc = 0.860 V, Jsc = 30.45 mA cm−2, FF = 78.32%, PCE = 20.52%) and WATER-PEDOT:PSS devices (Voc = 0.865 V, Jsc = 30.67 mA cm−2, FF = 78.48%, PCE = 20.82%), the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device has a significant improvement. According to the statistics of 40 samples, the average PCE is 19.2% for the D6-PEDOT:PSS device, 19.7% for the WATER-PEDOT:PSS device and 20.5% for the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device, which shows good reproducibility and the same trend with champion PCE (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device can achieve a high Voc of 0.889 V, and the hysteresis factor based on the formula in Peak's group52 is reduced from 0.024 of the reference to 0.016 (Table S4†). If more light can penetrate into the perovskite layer, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and its corresponding integral current should be higher. Based on the P–I–N structure (Fig. S14a†), the merit of the thinner HTL to obtain higher optical absorption has been verified by the theoretical simulation of the transmission matrix method, as shown in Fig. S14b.†43,53,54 The EQE of D6-PEDOT:PSS and WATER-PEDOT:PSS devices shown in Fig. S14c and d† reveals a similar trend to the absorption from simulation, which is another evidence of PEDOT:PSS thinning after the solvent etching process. As shown in Fig. 5e, compared with the D6-PEDOT:PSS device, the EQE of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device in the wavelength range of 500–900 nm is significantly improved, resulting in an improvement of integrated current (JEQE) from 29.27 to 30.46 mA cm−2. In Fig. 5f, under AM1.5G analog light, when the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device has a bias voltage of 0.75 V at the maximum power output point (MPP), it can output 21.28% PCE stably and keep a well-maintained Jsc of 28.35 mA cm−2. The significant performance increase of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device is largely ascribed to the enhancement of light penetration to the perovskite layer and improvement of perovskite crystal quality.
The conclusion of fewer defects and better hole extraction made in Fig. 4 needs to be further confirmed. Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) are used to further study the carrier migration process, carrier lifetime and recombination rate in PSCs.55 The better hole extraction capability of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device is confirmed by the faster TPC decay (0.85 μs compared to 1.18 μs of the D6-PEDOT:PSS device shown in Fig. 6a and Table S5†). As shown in Fig. 6b, the TPV decay of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device (18.29 μs) is significantly slower than that of the D6-PEDOT:PSS device (8.69 μs), which indicates less nonradiative recombination and longer carrier lifetime of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device. The fewer defects are also verified by the ideal factor (n) tests and the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. As presented in Fig. 6c, the n of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device is 1.30 compared to 1.47 of the D6-PEDOT:PSS device. Based on the SCLC measurement shown in Fig. 6d and e, the trap filling limiting voltages (VTFL) of the hole-only devices are 0.081 and 0.13 V with and without PEG etching, respectively. Then the calculated trap density (Nt) of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device is significantly reduced from 1.27 × 1015 cm−3 of D6-PEDOT:PSS device to 0.74 × 1015 cm−3. The interfacial charge transfer and recombination were further characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 3 Hz–100 kHz under AM1.5G simulated light. EIS results and the corresponding circuit model are shown in Fig. 6f. After PEG etching (Table S6†), the contact resistance (Rs) decreases from 36.72 Ω of the reference to 23.36 Ω and the transport resistance (Rtr) decreases from 1057 Ω of the reference to 974.9 Ω, which indicates that carriers have good transport at the interface. The composite resistance (Rrec) increases from 5513 Ω of the reference to 7870 Ω, which refers to the reduction of carrier recombination at the interface. These data again prove that the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device has fewer defects and better hole extraction capability.

To evaluate the shelf stability of our devices, the device is placed in a nitrogen glove box (temperature around 20 °C, H2O content ≤ 0.1 ppm, O2 content ≤ 10 ppm) for 1300 hours. As presented in Fig. 7, the PCE of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device remains about 75% of its initial value, in contrast to the 60% of its initial value in the D6-PEDOT:PSS device. The high stability of the PEG-PEDOT:PSS device could put down to the combination of less unpaired PSS, PEG passivation and crystallization optimization.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, inspired by the semiconductor etching process, we use green PEG as both the etchant and passivator, and creatively introduce an eco-friendly solvent etching technique into the spin coating process of PEDOT:PSS to fabricate an ultrathin HTL with passivated function in a simple one-step process. Compared with the D6-PEDOT:PSS HTL, this well-designed PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL can better match the perovskite layer and promote its crystallization with less interference. As a result, the PCE of Sn–Pb PSCs using the PEG-PEDOT:PSS HTL is improved to 21.58% from 20.52% of the reference, and the stability of Sn–Pb PSCs is also significantly enhanced. By developing an eco-friendly one-step solvent etching technique and selecting an appropriate functionalized etchant, we realize the thinning and modification strategy at the same time in the process of HTL fabrication, which basically solves the above-mentioned problems of optics, electricity and perovskite crystallization. The solvent etching technique with a functionalized etchant proposed in this work kills two birds with one stone, which provides new insights into fabricating multifunctional ultrathin PEDOT:PSS layers for application in optoelectronic devices.
