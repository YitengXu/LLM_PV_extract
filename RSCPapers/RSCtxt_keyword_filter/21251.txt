    , Accepted 9th April 2021First published on 9th April 2021AbstractThe surface, interfaces and grain boundaries of a halide perovskite film carry critical tasks in achieving as well as maintaining high solar cell performance due to the inherently defective nature across their regime. Passivating materials and felicitous process engineering approaches have significant ramifications in the resultant perovskite film, and the solar cell's overall macroscale properties as they dictate structural and optoelectronic properties. Herein, we exploit a vast number of defect engineering approaches aiming to increase the performance and the stability of perovskite solar cells, especially against humidity, continuous illumination, and heat. This review begins with the perovskite materials' fundamental structural properties followed by the advances made to induce higher stabilization in perovskite solar cells by fine-tuning materials chemistry design parameters. We continue by summarizing defect passivation strategies based on molecular entities' application, including suitable functional groups that enable sufficient surface, bulk and grain boundary passivation, morphology, and crystallinity control. We also present methods to control the density of defects through the variation of processing conditions, solvent annealing and solvent engineering approaches, gas-assisted deposition methods, and use of self-assembled monolayers, as well as colloidal engineering and coordination surface chemistry. Finally, we give our perspective on how a combined understanding of materials chemistry aspects and passivation mechanisms will further develop high-efficiency and stability perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
The quest to develop alternative renewable energy sources that can deliver high electrical power at low fabrication cost has fuelled the research of emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies, which bear the potential to disrupt the incumbent silicon (Si) PV market. Solar cells based on organic–inorganic halide perovskite absorbers (referred to as perovskite solar cells, PSCs) are among the most promising emerging PV technologies.1–4 These cells benefit from superior features exhibited by the halide perovskite absorber, such as exceptionally high light absorption coefficient up to 105 cm−1 and ultra-long electron–hole diffusion length of the order of few micrometres (μm) in polycrystalline films.5,6 Remarkably, within the last 10 years, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has rapidly increased from 3.8% in 2009,7 to 25.5% in single-junction and 29.5% in silicon/perovskite tandem cells.8 This breakthrough became possible thanks to pioneering works by the Nam Gyu Park9 and Snaith10 groups in Korea and the UK, respectively, reporting almost simultaneously in 2012 solid-state PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 9%.
Apart from their performance merits, PSCs have manufacturing advantages. They can be processed using low-cost precursor materials and solution-based fabrication methods compatible with flexible substrates. Together with their semi-transparency, they hold promise for entering the PV market soon. However, the major hurdle still to be surpassed is the concomitant increase of performance and long-term stability, with the latter being a vital issue for commercialisation. In particular, PSCs tend to degrade when exposed to environmental oxygen and moisture, heating and light illumination, and mechanical stress.9–20 The degradation of PSCs in a humid environment originates from the amine salt precursors' hygroscopic nature, such as methyl ammonium or formamidinium halides, used for the perovskite preparation.21 These salts facilitate the adsorption of water molecules from the surrounding environment, resulting in hydrate products. On the other hand, when perovskite films are exposed to light, relatively weak bonds in the perovskite layer can be broken to produce halide defects, such as halide vacancy-interstitial pairs.22 The latter enable halides to either migrate or react with molecular oxygen forming reactive superoxides.23 Moreover, heat can vaporise halide species that migrate towards metal contacts, while exposure to light increases mobility.24 Halide reaction with metals constitutes an additional PSC degradation factor.25 Perovskites may also undergo severe delamination due to stress caused by temperature changes because of their low fracture energy (lower than 1 J m−2) and thermal expansion coefficient much larger than that of the commonly used glass substrates.26 All factors above contribute to severe efficiency loss in PSCs. Addressing each of them individually or, more importantly, simultaneously is expected to lead to excellent and stable solar cells performance.
Efficiency stabilization has been heavily investigated in recent years, as proven by many research articles summarised in recently published reviews.6,9–21 Device encapsulation sufficiently prevents environmental-induced degradation of the perovskite absorber or the electrodes. Replacement of metal electrodes with either carbon or indium tin oxide (ITO) can provide non-reactive alternatives that create a barrier for moisture and oxygen penetration while also preventing volatile components in the perovskite layer from escaping to the environment. Addressing the intrinsic perovskite instability is among the most critical factors determining whether PSCs will find their way to practical applications. To this end, a huge amount of strategies already exists. These include sophisticated interface engineering, compositional tuning of the absorber, and passivation of bulk, surface, and grain boundary defects.27–32 The latter, when combined with regulation of morphology and crystallinity of the fabricated perovskite films, aim to impede or even prevent the formation of ionic defects, the migration of which is detrimental to device stability. Various passivation approaches, based on the application of functional molecules, post-deposition treatments and colloidal chemistry engineering, have been recently introduced, as they represent effective and easy to implement methodologies for the simultaneous enhancement of the device efficiency and stability.33–38
This review summarises advances made with perovskite materials, thin films, and solar cells to achieve a higher level of device performance and efficiency stabilization. We explore fine-tuning material chemistry aspects through passivation approaches and routes towards optimizing the morphology and crystallinity of the deposited films. The most successful methodologies include surface, interface and additive engineering, the variation of processing conditions, solvent annealing and solvent engineering approaches, gas-assisted deposition methods, the use of self-assembled monolayers, the formation of wide-bandgap perovskite capping layers, colloidal engineering and coordination surface chemistry. The remaining challenges and additional limitations that need to be addressed before the PSCs enter the PV market are also discussed.
2. Fundamental material limitations-tailoring of composition and dimensionality
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites are compounds of the chemical structure ABX3; A is either organic, such as methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+), formamidinium (CH3(NH2)2+, FA+) and guanidinium (CH6N3+, GA+), or inorganic, such as caesium (Cs+) and rubidium (Rb+) monovalent cation. B is a divalent metal cation, such as lead (Pb2+), tin (Sn2+), or germanium (Ge2+) and X is a halogen anion (Cl−, Br−, I−).39 In this structure, a three-dimensional (3D) framework is produced by BX6− octahedra sharing corners in all three orthogonal directions, whereas the A cation fills the 12-fold coordinated cubo-octahedral space. In contrast, the divalent metal atoms B (which are smaller in size than A cations) sit at the centres of the octahedra (Fig. 1a).40–42 Several perovskite structures usually correspond to a specific composition, depending on the temperature and preparation procedure. For example, the prototypical hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3), undergoes phase transformations from tetragonal to cubic at T = 54 °C and from tetragonal to orthorhombic at T = −111 °C during cooling.42,43

Perovskites with lower dimensionality, such as two- (2D) and one- (1D) dimensional bulk materials and zero- (0D) dimensional nanomaterials can also be produced (Fig. 1b). For example, the 2D framework is based on inorganic monolayers formed by corner-sharing BX6− octahedra, sandwiched between layers composed of large organic molecules. These are also known as organic–inorganic Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite materials, and have been thoroughly reviewed recently.44–48 The chemical formula of RP perovskites is An−1A2′BnX3n+1, includes a large monovalent cation A such as butylammonium (CH3(CH2)3NH3+, BA+) or phenethylammonium (C6H5(CH2)2NH3+, PEA+); A′ is the monovalent cation commonly forming the 3D perovskite structures. The long-chain alkylamines in the RP perovskites act as insulating buffers that prevent penetration of moisture into the crystal structure. As a result, PSCs based on RP perovskites are more stable than their 3D perovskite counterparts, albeit with lower efficiencies originated from the wider band gaps and lower carrier mobilities of the 2D structures. To prepare both efficient and stable PSCs by combining the advantages of 2D and 3D perovskites, strategies involving mixed phases of 2D/3D hybrid perovskites through efficient composition and structural engineering have been introduced and discussed below.
In general, the stability of PSCs critically depend on structural stability of the perovskites absorber, which can be predicted theoretically by calculating the tolerance factor,49t, a geometrical parameter introduced in 1926 by Goldschmidt:50 (1)with rA, rB and rX being the radii of A, B (generally, rA > rB) and X ions in the perovskite ABX3. The tolerance factor assesses whether the large A cation can fit within the space between BX6− octahedra in the perovskite framework.51 When the tolerance factor is unity, a perfect fit is expected. For 0.8 < t < 1 a stable perovskite phase is generally formed; compounds with a tolerance factor of 0.9 < t < 1 tend towards forming an ideal cubic structure, but for t close to 0.8 distorted perovskite structures with tilted octahedra (usually orthorhombic) are generally obtained. It is common in halide perovskite literature to denote the phase with cubic structure as α-phase and the phase with non-perovskite structures as δ-phase.40 If t > 1, the A cation is too large to fit within the framework and precludes the formation of stable perovskite phases. Finally, for t < 0.8, the A cation is too small, leading to alternative non-perovskite structures. Based on the above considerations, only three A cations known to date, namely Cs+, MA+ and FA+ (Fig. 1c), give tolerance values between 0.8 and 1 and are able to form a stabilized perovskite phases, either for Pb2+ or Sn2+ in the B site. Notably, Pb2+ perovskites are generally more stable than Sn2+ ones; the latter tend to oxidize even in the dark due to oxidation of Sn2+ to the Sn4+ state.52–62
Alkali metal cations (Na+, K+, Rb+) and NH4+ have a t < 0.8 thus not forming perovskite structures. However, all these cations in the “forbidden zones” (light blue areas in Fig. 1c) can serve as low concentration additives into the perovskite phases formed by MA, FA and Cs cations, aiming to achieve phase stabilization and defect passivation. To serve as perovskite phase stabilizers, these cations should posses large ionic size difference compared to the parent perovskite cations.63 However, for effective defect passivation small ionic size difference between these cations and perovskite ones is preferential. Moreover, intermixing different cations has be proven beneficial for the device performance and stability.64 The addition of MA+ to the FA+ dipping bath prevented the undesirable formation of the δ-phase and at the same time retained the bandgap edge of FAPbI3 adequately red-shifted.65–67 Caesium is the only inorganic elemental cation that it is large enough (rCs+ = 167 pm) to sustain the perovskite structure. Moreover, it has a considerably smaller ionic radius than MA+ and FA+ to enable its intermixing with FA+, which results in PSCs with enhanced photo- and moisture stability.68–71 The triple-cation perovskite films are thermally more stable and less affected by temperature, solvent vapours or heating during processing protocols. Cs+ increases the thermal stability for a fixed halide ratio, while increased Br− content also contributes considerably to thermal stability. Furthermore, incorporation of small amounts of Rb+ in mixed-cation perovskites leads to small photovoltage losses and stable device performance.72,73
Strategies to improve the performance and stability of PSCs also include substitution in the halide anion X− position. With this approach effective bandgap tuning can be achieved. The compounds with I− have the smallest bandgap (1.55–1.61 eV); perovskites with Br anions exhibit modest bandgap (2.0–2.44 eV), while those with Cl anions exhibit the highest bandgap (2.88–3.13 eV).74–78 The higher band gap, along with higher effective mass and lower charge carrier mobility of Br− and Cl− perovskites impede charge carrier transport in the perovskite film and, consequently, decrease the device performance. However, more stable structures were obtained through I substitution with smaller Br anions in mixed halide perovskites.79,80 An implication presented by mixed halide perovskites, however, is their photo-instability and the low obtained photovoltage.81 These were attributed to halide segregation under illumination, which results in the formation of two crystalline phases, namely iodide-rich minority and bromide-enriched majority domains. The emission from the minority domains with the high iodide content dominate the photoluminescence spectra of the mixed halide perovskite films even at low volume fractions. This is because the photogenerated carriers relax from the high energy states of the higher bandgap Br-rich majority domains into the lower energy states of the I-rich minority domains, where emission ultimately takes place. In the PSC devices, these domains may act as photogenerated carrier traps, facilitating non-radiative electron–hole recombination that induces voltage loss, while also has implications in the photostability of such devices. A more unconventional approach towards increased moisture stability involved replacement of two iodides with pseudohalide thiocyanate ions (SCN−) in MAPbI3.82 Comparing the spherical shape of I− ions with the linear shape of SCN− ions, the lone pairs of electrons from the S and N atoms in SCN− can interact strongly with the Pb2+ ion, which in turn stabilizes the frame structure of MAPb(SCN)2I, making it harder for water to form a hydrate phase in this crystal structure.83,84
Besides chemical composition, environmental factors such as water and oxygen molecules, concentrated light and heat represent notorious degradation factors of perovskite absorbers.85–92 Pressure–temperature phase transitions of MAPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, I) crystals have been also investigated through applying high pressure in the range between 0.1 Pa and 200 MPa.93 A triple point was found in each compound for pressures lower than 100 MPa (MAPbCl3: 75.1 MPa, 175.7 K, MAPbBr3: 43.2 MPa, 152.9 K, MAPbI3: 84.8 MPa, 176.2 K, Fig. 1d). The low-pressure phases of Cl− and Br− perovskites disappeared upon increasing pressure to the triple point, while a new phase appeared in the I− perovskite.
3. Perovskite defects and passivation approaches
Even though theoretical calculations predict highly ordered perovskite structures, in reality, even perovskite films of high quality possess significant intrinsic disorder mainly due to their relatively soft crystal structure.69 Moreover, due to their ionic character and the generally low defect formation energies, halide perovskites exhibit a wide variety of defects that are accommodated on the surface and at grain boundaries (GB) of the standard polycrystalline films.94 Also, ion migration within the perovskite film contributes to the formation of parasitic non-radiative recombination centres.69,95 Several types of defects are identified for the perovskite materials, divided into intrinsic and extrinsic defects. The former is also termed as native point defects and are always present in the perovskite framework and are commonly related to both the defective and incomplete lattice sites. These point defects can be summarized as follows for an ABX3 perovskite: vacancy defects VA, VB, VX, interstitial defects Ai, Bi, Xi and several types of substitutions (also known as antisites AB, AX, BA, BX, IA, IB), under-coordinated Pb2+, cation (such as MA+ and FA+) and mobile halide and MA species, metallic Pb, halide-excess and Pb-halogen antisites.96 Point defects can be combined to generate charge-neutral defect pairs such as Frenkel and Schottky defects. The former consists of a vacancy and an interstitial pair, whereas the latter consists of two vacancies of opposite charges. There are also 1D defects when lattice periodicity is discontinuous along a line, 2D surface defects and grain boundaries and 3D voids. For example, twelve types of intrinsic point defects have been reported for the prototypical MAPbI3 perovskite; these are MA, Pb and I vacancies (denoted as VMA, VPb and VI), interstitial MA, Pb and I (denoted as MAi, Pbi and Ii), and six substitutions, in particular, MA substituting Pb (MAPb), Pb replacing MA (PbMA) MA and Pb substituting I (MAI, PbI) and I substituting MA and Pb (IMA and IPb). Table 1 summarizes the most prevalent point defects in the lead and some in the tin halide perovskite films.

The calculated relative energies for most point defects in perovskites are very close to the band edges or even inside them. This indicates that perovskite materials are not prone to forming midgap states that are detrimental to the PSC. They act as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination sites, causing a significant reduction in photogenerated carrier lifetimes and concomitant drop of open-circuit voltage (VOC).115 Shallow trap states are most likely to be formed; they, however, induce reduced trapping times. The origin of such defect tolerance of perovskites is strongly related to the anti-bonding character of the molecular orbitals that constitute the bands' extrema (mostly Pb 6p orbitals in the conduction band minimum and X p-Pb 6s in the valence band maximum).116 Typically, vacancies of any type represent shallow defects, while interstitials and antisites form deep traps with increasing formation energy.117 For example, substantial non-radiative recombination losses have been determined in MAPbI3 that arise from the more profound defects in the perovskite bandgap, including interstitial Pb (Pbi) and antisite defects (MAI, PbI, IMA, and IPb). All these defects and the associated trap states exhibit a wide profile concerning their spatial and energetic distribution and densities. They are considered highly detrimental to PSC performance.118 Even shallower defects may act as useful, unintentional, doping sites, contributing to photocurrent hysteresis. Besides the anomalous hysteresis in current density–voltage characteristics, they are also the cause of phase segregation and long-term instability issues. By introducing compositional engineering and appropriate passivation methodologies, including surface and bulk passivation using additive engineering, solution chemistry engineering, colloidal and coordination chemistry approaches and post-deposition treatments, the number of in-depth and shallow defects can be effectively reduced.
Extrinsic point defects are caused by the perovskite dangling bonds on the surface and the surrounding environment; they can be categorized as surface and grain boundary defects. They represent a significant concern in the commonly used solution-processable grainy and polycrystalline halide perovskite films where trap densities of the order of 1016–1017 cm−3 (for MAPbI3) have been estimated, much higher than those of the ones found in single crystals (109–1010 cm−3).100 Defects at grain boundaries and the interfaces also present degradation sites as they serve as infiltration paths for moisture while also providing charge accumulation sites.119 Furthermore, the halide-terminated surfaces of those films usually form traps that usually provide favourable paths for halide ions' migration due to reduced steric hindrance.105 Surface and grain boundary defect passivation are of paramount importance to optimise and stabilise the device efficiency.120
Surface and interface passivation approach using small molecules (i.e., amine and carboxylic acids, Lewis bases and acids, porphyrins, pyridines, halide salts, electrolytes, multifunctional molecular modulators), self-assembled monolayers (SAMS), low dimensional perovskites and capping layers represent effective routes that aim to decrease defect density and charge trapping therein. Cross-linking of perovskite grains using organic small molecules or polymers and regulating perovskite film morphology and crystallinity using appropriate additives or post-treatment methods can synergistically contribute to a decrease in both intrinsic and extrinsic defect density, reduce charge accumulation and trapping and prevent the moisture attack effectively. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent achievements that have been made in the field of defect passivation approaches in perovskite films, including efforts on the surface and interface modification, modulation of grain boundaries, morphology and crystallinity control, and post-treatments leading to perovskite solar cells with improved performance attributes and stability. Fig. 2 illustrates intrinsic and extrinsic defects in the perovskite bulk and surface, as well as several successful passivation approaches discussed in this review.

3.1 Surface and interfacial defect passivation
The most crucial factor that dictates perovskite solar cells performance is the adopted procedure for the growth of perovskite thin films. The soft lattice of halide perovskites presents both unique challenges and opportunities in thin film fabrication. Many methods have already been developed for their efficient synthesis and processing, which can be divided to vacuum deposition methods, such as thermal evaporation, pulse laser deposition, chemical vapor deposition etc., and solution-based techniques, such as spin-coating, drop casting, solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis, solid-state reaction, precipitation reaction and so on. However, the current review focuses on the passivation and process engineering methods of the already deposited film and reviewing the large field of thin film growth methods is beyond the scope of this work. The reader can refer to the already published review papers that summarize recent approaches on the synthesis of perovskite films as well as advantages and obstacles encountered with each of these approaches.121–123

3.1.1 Organic small molecule induced passivation. 
A wide variety of organic small molecular materials combined with different strategies and processes have been applied to effectively passivate defects and trap states present in perovskite films' surface and interfaces. They generally adopt passivation schemes based on effective coordination or ionic bonding within the perovskite framework. To do so, they bear appropriate functional groups such as amines, carboxylates, halides, basic and acidic ones, and large aliphatic chains or hydrophobic moieties to render the perovskite film surface more resilient to water penetration. Small molecules, including carboxylate groups, possess the intrinsic tendency to coordinate with under-coordinated lead cations strongly.124 The binding interaction can be further strengthened in donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structures. An increase in electron density in carboxylate is obtained via an electron donor unit such as N,N-dibutylaminophenyl with superior donating ability.125 Non-volatile small molecules with aromatic mono-, di- and tri-carboxylic acid groups, such as benzoic acid (BA), p-phthalic acid (PTA), and trimesic acid (TA), respectively, are also found to coordinate with Pb and passivate surface traps effectively.126 The reduction in the density of defects and the concomitant decrease in carrier recombination therein by small-molecule coordination to perovskite led to higher device performance for all these molecules but to a different extent which was related to the –COOH content.
Amines were also useful in passivating surface defects in perovskite films. For example, N2,N2,N8,N8-tetrakis(4-(methylthio)phenyl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-2,8-diamine (abbreviated as DBTMT) interacted with MAPbI3 at the interface through the sulphur atoms in DBTMT to passivate surface and interface defects, improve the crystallinity and the Pb:I ratio, leading to a higher PCE and enhanced stability in planar p–i–n PSCs.127 Amines with long alkyl chains have demonstrated improved defect passivation ability and enhanced and stabilised device efficiency.128 Furthermore, the inclusion of hydrophobic entities in the passivation molecule further boosts the device resilience against moisture-induced degradation. A series of new organic molecules with strong hydrophobic nature synthesised by Zhao et al. were employed as surface passivation molecules in PSCs.129 Among them, N-((4-(N,N,N-triphenyl)phenyl)ethyl)ammonium bromide (TPA-PEABr) demonstrated the highest passivation effectiveness, as verified by the reduced surface defect density and a significantly improved efficiency and stability. Another hydrophobic tetratetracontane organic small molecule (TTC, CH3(CH2)42CH3) incorporated at the fullerene/perovskite interface of planar p–i–n PSCs reduced the surface and interface traps. It suppressed charge recombination, resulting in enhanced device performance and increased long-term stability.130 Fluorinated compounds, such as the polyfluoro organic compound tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron (TPFPB), played multiple roles in passivating surface defects, reducing surface defect densities, yielding large grains, increasing surface hydrophobicity and improving charge transport.131 The effective surface passivation of the perovskite absorber was also proven beneficial for device stability. PSCs with the TPFPB passivation retained a more considerable degree of their initial performance when exposed to ambient air and illumination with a xenon lamp. Furthermore, bidentate organic small molecules bearing hydrophobic moieties, such as pyrazines and porphyrins, have been proven capable of passivating surface defect states in the perovskite film through either a monodentate or a bridging bidentate bonding with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions while also acting as protecting buffers against moisture penetration.132,133
Besides instability issues, a significant concern in PSC technology is their low reproducibility which highly hampers their practical application. Effective passivation of defects in the perovskite film can also lead to repeatable performance attributes in the respective devices. A π-conjugated small molecule embedding bilateral carboxyl and thiophene groups, namely 2,5-di(thiophene-2-yl)terephthalic acid (DTA), effectively passivated perovskite defects which led to a significant performance, an improvement in environmental and thermal stability as well as increased device reproducibility with only small deviations from optimum device performance.134 In a similar approach, simultaneous enhancement in the device long-term stability and reproducibility was achieved by introducing a hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) into the precursor solution.135 This enabled morphological and structural control of the fabricated films while also created a hydrophobic “encapsulation” network on the perovskite surface through effective coordination of HMTA with under-coordinated Pb ions, boosting, apart from efficiency, the device stability and reproducibility. Except for being coordinated to lead cations, a small molecule with appropriate functional groups can also passivate halide ions. An iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) additive, for example, was capable of strong supramolecular halogen bond formation, thus passivating perovskite trap states.136 An ionic compound, namely 1-ethylpyridinium chloride (EPC), bearing nitrogen atom in the pyridine group, also acted as an effective surface defect passivation medium. The chlorine anions were also found to participate in the defect passivation process.137 Concerning interfacial passivation, a polar non-conjugated small-molecule electrolyte, namely 4,4′-(((methyl(4-sulphonatobutyl)ammonio)bis(propane-3,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl ammoniumdiyl))bis-(butane-1-sulfonate) (MSAPBS), initially introduced at the ITO/perovskite interface, was found not only to inhibit interface charge accumulation but also to passivate interfacial defects and suppress non-radiative recombination.138 Multi-zwitterionic small-molecule electrolytes were also served as useful as surface defect passivation agents while also interacted with bulk/interface defects. Synergistically, this resulted in performance enhancement with suppressed hysteresis and enhanced stability.139
The insertion of appropriate bulky hydrophobic tertiary and quaternary alkyl ammonium cations within the perovskite material enabled the formation of a moisture-resistant layer and improved the fabricated stability devices.140,141 The steric effects due to the bulky cations and the change of surface Pb5–I1c bonds effectively hindered water adsorption on the Pb5c sites. Various MA-based PSCs with the modified perovskite films yielded PCEs over 15% with excellent stability under very high RH (∼90%) over 30 days.140 Note that aprotic sulfonium cations have exhibited, apart from electrochemical, superior humidity stability than protic ammonium cations, emphasizing the cation basicity's role in PSC stability against moisture.141 Meanwhile, the coating of evaporated MAPbI3 thin films with different hydrophobic molecules, namely trioctyl phosphine oxide and tridodecyl methylammonium iodide, resulted in a remarkably mitigated degradation of MAPbI3 and formation of PbI2 and led to high efficiency and enhanced stability single-junction n–i–p PSCs.
To achieve the highest degree of defect passivation, multi-functional small molecular materials have recently been proposed as an effective means to passivate defects, regulate film crystallinity and enhance crystal grain size. A judiciously engineered bifunctional molecular modulator 3-(5-mercapto-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)benzenaminium iodide (SN), linking the mercapto-tetrazolium (S) and phenylammonium (N) moieties, was incorporated in formamidinium–caesium lead iodide-based PSCs by Grätzel and co-workers aiming at passivating surface defects and inducing the formation of large grain crystals with superior quality.142 As a result, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 20% for (FAI)0.9Cs0.1(PbI2)1.05 PSCs with a large area (exceeding 1 cm2) combined with high operational stability under ambient conditions was demonstrated. Moreover, a rationally designed multifunctional molecular modulator, 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI), with bulky tert-butyl groups, prevented aggregation by steric repulsion was recently applied as a surface modifier in PSCs. tBBAI significantly accelerated charge extraction, while it also retarded non-radiative charge carrier recombination by passivating interfacial defects.143 Furthermore, the tert-butyl groups enhanced surface hydrophobicity. They protected the perovskite film from moisture, leading to excellent cell operational stability retaining over 95% of the initial PCE after 500 h continuous solar illumination.
A molecular passivation treatment for perovskite films, using multifunctional molecular entities consisting of a small-sized hydrophobic aromatic group, i.e. a benzene ring in a benzylamine functional molecule, was also proposed to be an effective method to passivate perovskite defects. Proper steric edge-on arrangement of the benzene rings on the perovskite surface was considered responsible for efficiency stabilization and moisture-resistance (>4 months in ambient air) of the treated FAPbI3 PSCs.144 Generally, control of the degree and depth of interaction between perovskite and the employed molecules could tune the effectiveness of defect passivation.145 Understanding the underlying passivation mechanisms through interactions between the molecular functional groups and the perovskite defects can further advance this field. For example, a detailed study of passivation with caffeine, theophylline and theobromine treatment revealed that the primary passivation event, which is accomplished through CO binding on antisite Pb defects, can be assisted hydrogen-bond formation between N–H and iodine anions.146
The addition of a Lewis base is well known to reduce trap density and enhance the electron diffusion length in perovskites.147 Bifunctional group passivation with a hydrophobic molecule of thiosalicylic acid was recently demonstrated to double anchoring the acid functional groups to under-coordinated Pb ions.148 Rationally designed Lewis base small molecules with electron-rich nitrile (C–N) groups effectively reduced trap density of the Pb-exposed surface through coordination bonds and, thus, suppressing non-radiative recombination, resulting in an improved photostability in an inverted p–i–n configuration.149 Lewis acids and bases containing phosphorus, such as triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), tris(pentafluorophenyl) phosphine (TPFP) and tetraisopropyl methylenediphosphonate (TMPP), were also employed in multiple-cation lead mixed-halide perovskites to improve PSC efficiency and stability.150,151 Different functionalities, including defect passivation and suppression of phase segregation, resulted in reduced charge recombination, enhanced PCE and moisture resistance (Fig. 3).

Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as a (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC-Th) molecule,152 have also been proven as an effective class of additive materials. Similarly, pristine or functionalized fullerenes acceptors (FAs), such as a cross-linkable [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD), enabled effective surface and bulk passivation of perovskite films.153 These molecules could simultaneously address the poor crystallization issue of perovskites, passivate defect states and enhanced electron extraction efficiency.154 It was found that PSCs based on hybrid phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM):perovskite solids exhibited significantly reduced hysteresis and recombination losses.155 They proposed that PC61BM molecules passivated PbI3− antisite defects during the perovskite self-assembly. A thin interfacial modification layer of PC61BM employed at the Al-doped ZnO/perovskite interface was also an effective interfacial defect passivation layer. It lowered the defect activation energy and reduced the trap density, improving the cells PCE with a significant reduction in their hysteresis.156 Moreover, amino-functionalized PCBM has been very effective as passivation layer due to its electron-accepting ability that strongly inhibited ionic motion near the perovskite surface.157 A pyridine-functionalized fullerene additive (C60-PyP) also enabled coordination interactions with perovskite leading to passivated surface trap states, enlarged the grain size and improved film crystallization while also improved perovskite's resistance to degradation due to its hydrophobic nature.158,159Table 2 includes the maximum PCE obtained with PSCs incorporating small organic molecules as passivation agents, while the device architecture is also presented.

3.1.2 Polymer induced passivation. 
In addition to organic small molecules, conjugated or non-conjugated polymers have been recently applied to PSCs to function as passivation moieties for achieving improved and stabilized efficiencies. For example, donor–acceptor conjugated copolymers with carbazole and benzothiadiazole (BT) units bearing alkoxy side-chains in the BT unit were employed to function as perovskite surface passivation agents and dopant-free hole transport layers simultaneously. It was revealed that the methoxy side-chains on the BT unit introduced a surface defect passivation effect resulting in PSCs with superior PCE and stability compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based cells due to suppression of trap-induced recombination and cell degradation.160 Mixing MAPbIxCl3−x with a donor polymer [N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT),161 which contains lone electron pairs due to the presence of S and N atoms, also proved a practical trap state passivation approach. In contrast, the interaction between MAPbIxCl3−x and PCDTBT led to a more ordered orientation and high-quality film morphology. As a result, PCDTBT-modified PSCs demonstrated an improved and stabilized PCE with enhanced stability. Similarly, thiazole-bridged diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based semiconducting polymers have been recently applied as passivation agents in PSCs leading to PCEs up to 20.30%.162 A thin poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) layer deposited on top of an inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite film was also found to effectively and reproducibly passivate surface defect states and significantly reduce electron–hole recombination within the perovskite.163 A thin semiconducting poly(4-butylphenyldiphenylamine) polymer (PTPD) was also proved useful in interfacial passivation at the perovskite/HTL interface.164
Non-conjugated polymers, such as poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP), have also been applied as surface passivation layers in CsPbI3-based PSCs.165 Acylamino groups in PVP induced an electron cloud density enhancement on the perovskite surface due to chemical bonding between acylamino and CsPbI3, lowering its surface energy and stabilising CsPbI3 grains in the cubic phase. Similarly, poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP) effectively passivated the surface defects and grain boundaries upon coordination of lone pair electrons of nitrogen in pyridine with the under-coordinated Pb sites. The substantially reduced defect density led to reduced nonradiative recombination and extended electron diffusion length.166 In particular, PSCs with P4VP incorporation exhibited significantly enhanced moisture and thermal stabilities. Self-assembled surface-passivated FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3 perovskite thin films with a fluorinated polymer (FP) as an additive have also been incorporated in PCEs.167 Upon separation and aggregation of the FP phase at the perovskite layer's top surface during film formation, FP acted as a passivation layer and improved the PCE from 17.2% to 19.1%. Notably, the passivation of the upper interface in PSCs might in principle be more efficient than that of the lower interface. This hierarchy in interfacial passivation was attributed to the “reparation” effect of the utilized passivation medium on the perovskite layer, as it induced both “interfacial” and “bulk” effects by effectively filling the grain boundaries of the perovskite layer and reducing the trap state density in both the perovskite layer and the interface between it and the upper carrier transport layer.168 A PCE of 19.55% and a VOC of 1.133 V with negligible hysteresis and better long-term and thermal stability were achieved for the champion devices with an upper passivation layer of polystyrene (PS) or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Moreover, an ultrathin passivation layer consisting of a PMMA:PCBM mixture was highly effective in passivating interfacial defects near the perovskite/TiO2 interface, significantly suppressing interfacial recombination.169 A crosslinkable organic small molecule thioctic acid (TA) has been coordinated to both TiO2 and MAPbI3 and then in situ crosslinked to form a polymer (poly(TA)) network, which acted as bifacial passivation agent (Fig. 4).170Table 3 summarizes the perovskite passivation approaches using polymers and large molecular materials.

3.1.3 Inorganic material induced passivation. 
Inorganic materials have also been investigated as passivation agents in perovskites owing to their robustness and ease of processing. Organophosphorus ligands, TOPO and TPPO,148 have been used as passivation through interfacial modification of perovskite films upon Pb–O bonds forming under-coordinated Pb2+ ions.171 Core/shell colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have also been applied as passivation layers on perovskite surfaces.172 In particular, CdSe/ZnS QD layers decreased the surface trap density and stabilized the perovskite structure. Both surface and grain boundary defects were suppressed due to the Se2− anions inducing van der Waals interactions between the perovskite's organic and inorganic components.
Another novel approach for interfacial passivation and suppressed carrier recombination was demonstrated by Chen et al. in all-inorganic caesium tin–germanium triiodide (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3) PSCs. They showed that the Sn-containing stable GeO2 native-oxide layer that was spontaneously formed upon air exposure, fully covering the perovskite film, was highly effective in passivating the perovskite surface.59 Defect passivation in inorganic perovskites using oxygen molecules and atoms was also identified as a remarkably effective strategy to suppress defect-assisted recombination.173 Although oxygen molecule passivation occurs by physisorption on the perovskite's surface, oxygen atoms strongly interact with perovskites and provide enhanced passivation compared to O2. Significantly, dry-air processing conditions facilitate O2 dissociation into O upon annealing, enhancing CsPbI2Br-based PSCs efficiency and ambient stability.
In a similar approach, effective dual passivation of shallow and deep traps in an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite and at the ETL/perovskite interface was achieved by an alkaline chloride (namely potassium chloride, KCl) interfacial modification, leading to state-of-the-art PSCs with a superior PCE of 22.6%, reduced hysteresis and excellent long-term stability in the air (Fig. 5).174 Dual passivation strategies have also been regularly employed in PSCs based on methylammonium and mixed cation perovskites.196,197 Quaternary ammonium halides effectively passivated both positively charged cationic and negatively charged anionic defects, such as I− and MA+ vacancies, in several hybrid perovskites. Efficient defect healing reduced the charge trap density and elongated the carrier recombination lifetime, boosting the PCE to 20.59% and significantly enhancing ambient stability.175 Similarly, inorganic binary alkaline halide salts with their cations and anions were found to passivate several types of ionic defects simultaneously and significantly suppress recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface, contributing to the elimination of hysteresis and a high PCE of 20.5% in PSCs that further retained 90% of their initial performance after 30 days storage.176 Si et al. also demonstrated that incorporating ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) could result in the simultaneous passivation of negative- and positive-charged ionic defects, reducing the perovskite defect density, prolonging the carrier lifetime, enhancing film crystallinity and boosting the PCE to 21.38% with enhanced long-term stability.177 Lithium fluoride (LiF) is used for the passivation of interfaces of inverted perovskite solar cells and modules with a p–i–n structure.178,179 The insertion of a thin LiF interlayer enabled PCE values of 14.1% for a unit cell and 8.7% for the module.178Table 4 summarizes the inorganic molecular materials used as passivation agents in perovskite films.

3.1.4 Low-dimensional perovskites as passivating agents. 
It is commonly accepted that the perovskite film's surface is where defects are most easily formed. Therefore, the surface and interface defects' passivation is an important task to optimize PSCs' performance and stability. A distinct strategy was recently followed to passivate such defects that involved lower dimensionality perovskites as up-and-coming passivation agents in PSCs.180 Two-dimensional (2D) wide-bandgap perovskites such as phenethylammonium lead iodide (PEA2PbI4) and butylammonium lead iodide (BA2PbI4) are insulated materials that have been employed to passivate bulk, surface and interface dangling bonds in the perovskite film by exploiting the associated intermolecular interaction. For example, a double-sided (bifacial) passivation of 3D perovskite films could be successfully implemented with thin, discontinuous, semi-insulating surface layers of bulky organic cation-based halide compounds forming 2D layered perovskites.181 Highly efficient (22.77%) mixed-dimensional PSCs with a remarkable VOC of 1.2 V are reported for a perovskite film with a bandgap of ∼1.6 eV. Double-sided surface layers provide effective surface defect passivation and chemical passivation at both the ETL and HTL/perovskite interfaces, reducing surface recombination and suppressing interfacial charge recombination. 2D perovskites embedding phenylformamidinium (PFA) cations have been proven effective stabilizers of FA-based perovskites.182 Also, a 2D/3D perovskite stacking layer was fabricated by in situ growth of a 2D PEA2PbI4 capping layer on top of the 3D triple cation (Cs/MA/FA) perovskite absorber to improve the stability of the ensuing PSCs.183 Besides the remarkable efficiency stabilization of the fabricated cells that retained 90% of their initial PCE for more than 1000 h of exposure in ambient air, high efficiency of 18.51% was also obtained in the 2D/3D PSCs (PCE of the control device 17.02%). The 2D perovskite capping layer application induced more extensive Fermi level splitting under light illumination in the 2D/3D structure, resulting in a higher VOC than the pure 3D perovskite (1.11 versus 1.05 V). A record VOC of 1.31 V was also demonstrated in PSC using a 2D/3D layered perovskite architecture where a n-butylammonium bromide layer was coated atop the double-action perovskite absorber layer.184 The thin 2D perovskite layer mitigated non-radiative recombination in the absorber layer, enhancing VOC by 80 mV. Jiang et al., developed a different strategy to convert PEAI into a 2D layered PEA2PbI4 perovskite for effective passivation of a 3D perovskite layer, in particular, FA1−xMAxPbI3.185 The perovskite film was deposited using a two-step spin-coating method. It then introduced the 2D perovskite passivation layer by spin-coating a PEAI salt solution onto the 3D perovskite surface. PEAI formed on the perovskite surface enabled higher solar cell efficiency by filling iodine vacancies on the surface and the grain boundaries, reducing defects density and suppressing non-radiative recombination.
Hydrophobic, halogenated, low-dimensional perovskite capping layers by employing different benzylammonium-based aromatic cations were used for surface and interface passivation at the perovskite/HTL interface.186 Perovskite films with halogenated low-dimensional perovskite passivation layers displayed suppressed non-radiative recombination and reduced trap density, leading to significantly reduced voltage loss. As a result, optimal PSCs achieved a PCE as high as 21.13% with an enhanced VOC of 1.14 V combined with outstanding long-term stability when exposed to moisture, heat and continuous UV irradiation. Nazeeruddin and co-workers have chosen PEA and [(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]ammonium (FPEA) as 2D cations to formulate thin passivation layers of (PEA)2PbI4 or (FPEA)2PbI4 on top of the 3D perovskite.187 The 2D perovskite passivation layer neutralized surface defects of the 3D absorber, while also served as a protection layer of the latter preventing moisture penetration into it, demonstrating excellent device stability combined with an efficiency above 18%. 2-(4-Fluorophenyl)ethyl ammonium iodide (FPEAI) was also used for the in situ growth of a 2D perovskite, in particular, (p-FC6H4C2H4NH3)2[PbI4] on top of a Cs/FA/MA triple-cation 3D perovskite with an excess of PbI2.188 The thin 2D perovskite layer facilitated interfacial charge transport, reducing the non-radiative recombinations, while also acted as a protective capping layer for the 3D perovskite film. Based on this 3D/2D perovskite layered structure, PSCs attained a high PCE of 20.54% combined with superior moisture stability maintaining 99% of their initial PCE over a considerable stability test period of 36 days. Furthermore, four organic phenethylammonium iodide salts with different functional groups directly linking to the benzene ring were introduced on the surface of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3−yCly)x) perovskite films. It was found that the electron density of the benzene ring significantly influences the interfacial passivation; only phenethylammonium iodides with electron-donating groups (methoxyl and methyl) were favourable for interfacial passivation, which was attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the benzene ring and the under-coordinated Pb2+ ions.189 A remarkable PCE of 22.98% was achieved with a 1000 h stability under storage in dark ambient conditions. Besides, the chain length of organic ammonium iodide was found to affect the defect passivation effectiveness crucially. Compared to butylammonium iodide (BAI), hexylammonium iodide (HAI)-derived two-dimensional (2D) perovskite was more efficient in passivating interfacial defects, resulting in a notably enhanced photoluminescence lifetime and decreased interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the ultimate PCE reached 20.62% compared to 18.83% for the reference cell. The long-term PSC durability against humidity and heat was simultaneously improved (Fig. 6).190 Substituted thiazolium iodide (TMI) passivating agents were also employed to functionalize the perovskite surface and induce hydrophobicity.190 TMI treatment resulted in VOC and FF enhancement by reducing recombination paths at the perovskite/hole selective interface and by passivating shallow and deep bulk perovskite traps. As a result, a higher PCE was achieved, accompanied by remarkable long-term cell stability retaining ∼95% of its initial efficiency after 800 h storage.

In an alternative approach, a trilayered architecture consisting of a highly stable pure 2D (n = 1) perovskite layer formulated on top of a quasi-2D (n = 2) perovskite film capped a 3D perovskite absorber was demonstrated.191 By precisely controlling the surface structure and thickness of the 2D perovskites, PSCs with an efficiency of 18.5% and excellent moisture stability were obtained. The wide-bandgap perovskite capping layer approach was also adopted to develop 3D/3D layered structures consisting of wider bandgap perovskites deposited onto lower bandgap ones. For example, compositionally engineered FAPbBr3−xIx layer on top of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 film could create a compositional gradient at the perovskite/HTL interface and was proven to function as an effective passivating layer, reducing interfacial charge recombination and resulting in a high PCE of 21.3%.192
Besides 2D perovskite capping layers, 1D ones have also been developed atop or along with the 3D perovskite absorbers (forming a BHJ in the latter case) to function as thin surface passivation layers. Alkylammonium cations,193 phenylalkylamines,194 and pyrazolyl pyridine compounds195 have been found to coordinate bonds with the perovskite through proton exchange effectively. A novel 1D-3D hetero-structure was formed in the entire volume of the perovskite film with relaxed lattice mismatch. In particular, 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (PZPY) was introduced into Pb halide 3D perovskites, readily allowing 1D–3D hybrid perovskite materials to be obtained (Fig. 7a).195 The intrinsically stable 1D–3D perovskites demonstrated a thermodynamic self-healing ability induced by blocking the migration channels of A-site ions by the flexible 1D perovskite less densely close-packed structure. Moreover, they effectively passivated interfacial traps that could form during the crystal growth process, enabling a remarkably enhanced PL decay lifetime due to the suppressed carrier recombination compared to the 3D counterpart. The PSCs fabricated using these novel 1D–3D perovskites exhibited a higher reversible PCE under temperature cycling (25–85 °C) at 55% RH, mainly outperforming the pure 3D PSCs improved long-term stability. Another 1D perovskite, thiazole ammonium lead iodide (TAPbI3), served as an effective capping layer on 3D perovskite. This capping layer passivated surface defects, promoted charge transport, prolonged carrier lifetime and prevented the migration of iodide anions within the 3D perovskite hence improving the overall PSC performance and ambient stability (Fig. 7b).196 Similarly, sulfonium-based ionic materials have also been applied as capping layers in perovskite films due to their higher electrochemical stabilities.197,198

2D perovskites based on a phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA) cation, namely PTAMAPbI4, have also been applied as capping layers on the surface of MAPbI3 controllable PTAI intercalation via either spin-coating or soaking treatment. PTAMAPbI4 not only passivated MAPbI3 but also acted as an MA+ locker to inhibit MAI extraction and significantly enhance stability, enabling a champion PCE of 21.16% with only a 7% decrease 500 h continuous illumination (Fig. 7c).199 Treating the perovskite film surface with (semi)conducting perovskite quantum dots (QDs) to form a capping layer has been well documented to improve PSC performance.200 For example, a semiconducting diammonium porphyrin (ZnPy–NH3Br) was employed to treat CsPbBr3 nanocrystalline QDs coated a 3D perovskite film, thus constructing a stable 0D–2D perovskite capping layer (Fig. 7d). That assembly strategy resulted in large-scale nanocube perovskite crystals, whereas the capping layer improved charge transport and separation. Optimized devices reached a PCE of 20.0%, compared to 19.5% for the QD-modified PSCs and 19.1% for the control cells, which dropped by 15% and 35%, respectively when placed at 45% humidity (or illuminated for 450 h) and 85 °C for 1000 h.200

3.1.5 Coordination surface chemistry-use of self-assembled monolayers. 
Alternatively, surface ligand-modulation and treatment have been employed as surface passivation and trap density modification means in PSCs.201,202 Addition of specific hydrophobic ionic organic surface ligands, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), octyltrimethylammonium bromide (OTAB), dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide (CDAB) modulated the shape and distribution of excess PbI2 in perovskite films, leading to perovskite films with vertically distributed PbI2 nanosheets between the GBs and, thus, reducing perovskite trap density and non-radiative recombination. Ligand-modulated devices exhibited a PCE increase from 20% to 22% and more extended stability, retaining 72% of their initial efficiency after 360 h constant illumination.201 Surface ligands with different binding groups were found to either form a surface monolayer or penetrate the perovskite layer, depending on both the ligand tail and binding groups, as well as modulate the surface energetics, thus significantly impacting PSC characteristics, with increased performance demonstrated for ligands that create a more favourable energetic landscape for electron transfer from MAPbI3 to a C60 ETL.202 Surface treatment of perovskites by various nanocrystals (NCs) capped with oleylamine ligands was also found to be effective in lowering surface trap density and passivating trap states, upon forming a conformal coating on perovskite film, with its origin being oleylamine instead of the NCs.203
A common strategy to passivate/modify the interfaces between the perovskite absorber and the charge transporting layers to address both device stability and efficiency issues is incorporating suitable self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) at these interfaces.204–209 Thiols were first proposed as effective SAMs to chemically modify the interface of MAPbI3 with both a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transporting layer (ETL) and different hole transporting layers (HTLs) leading to enhanced performance and stability of PSCs.204 In particular, HOOC–Ph–SH thiol was incorporated at the TiO2/perovskite interface to facilitate perovskite crystal growth and electron transfer from perovskite to TiO2. A highly hydrophobic thiol, namely pentafluorobenzenethiol (HS-PhF5), modified the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface and remarkably improved device stability under storage and continuous illumination. Alternatively, hydrophobic small molecule-based SAMs have been effectively incorporated from solution in p–i–n or n–i–p planar heterojunction PSCs. For example, a novel small molecule V1036 without parasitic absorption was employed as a dopant-free hole-selective contact SAM in p–i–n PSCs.205 Its formation was achieved by immersing the substrate into a solution that could simply bind to the ITO surface due to its phosphonic anchoring group. Devices with a PCE of up to 17.8% were demonstrated. A perfluorinated SAM (p-SAM) passivated the perovskite surface and, at the same time, also drastically improved the perovskite film stability.206 As a result, p–i–n-type PSCs employing these SAM exhibited PCEs surpassing 21% with exceptional stability under elevated temperature or humid conditions (i.e. stable operation under standardized maximum-power point (MPP) operation at 85 °C in an inert atmosphere for more than 250 h and maintaining ∼95% of the initial efficiency upon storage in humid air over ∼3000 h).
Two other novel, versatile, hole-selective molecules based on carbazole bodies with phosphonic acid anchoring groups that can form SAMs on various oxides enabled conformal coverage of arbitrarily formed metal oxide surfaces for p–i–n PSCs.207 The SAMs created a favourable energy level alignment at the perovskite film interface without non-radiative losses. These SAMs were universally employed in three different perovskite compositions, to demonstrate interlayer-free PSCs with stabilized PCEs of up to 21.1% (Fig. 8).

Acids such as 3-aminopropanoic acid have been explored as SAMs on a poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) HTL.208 A much smoother perovskite surface morphology with increased film crystallinity and coverage was achieved for MAPbI3−xClx, resulting in an enhanced stabilized PCE. Concerning the ETL/perovskite interface in n–i–p PSCs, a fullerene SAM (C60SAM) was proposed to functionalize the interface between mesoporous TiO2 and the perovskite MAPbI3−xClx.209 C60SAM acted as an efficient electron acceptor but inhibited electron transfer to TiO2 due to energy level misalignment and low electronic coupling. However, thermalized electrons from C60SAM could be transferred through the perovskite. The formed “mesoporous electron acceptor” could represent a versatile strategy, resulting in PCEs of up to 11.7%.

3.2 Passivation of grain boundaries

3.2.1 Organic and inorganic small molecules. 
Engineering of grain boundaries (GBs) in perovskite thin films is the most effective method to passivate defects present therein, contributing to efficiency stabilization. Several types of semiconducting small molecules with Lewis acid or base functional groups were exceptionally useful in the passivation of perovskite GBs. They can be easily attached to under-coordinated ions present therein.210 Post-treatment of perovskite films with acids such as 2-aminoterephthalic acid produce efficient and stable PSCs with a remarkable PCE of 21.09% and improved stability. These improvements were attributed to the acid ability to act as a cross-linking agent that passivated the trap states at GBs thus inhibiting ion migration.211 Although organic ammonium iodide could be used to effectively passivate surface defects and GBs in perovskite thin films by forming a thin 2D perovskite layer,185,212 other organic213 and alkaline214 iodides were also explored for GB passivation. Phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr)213 was universally useful in fine-tuning the perovskite film morphology upon enlarging its grain size and passivating grain boundaries. These led to a reduced trap density in the modified perovskite film, negligible hysteresis and high-performance PSCs for various perovskites including MAPbI3 and triple-cation perovskites.213 On the other hand, potassium iodide (KI) incorporation into the perovskite absorber effectively passivated GBs and interfacial defects increased the crystal grain size and improved the film crystallinity.214 As a result, charge trapping and bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination were suppressed, leading to an improved VOC and FF and an optimized PCE.
Alternatively, small molecule (e.g. C60) induced GB passivation, along with perovskite surface passivation and enhanced electron transport, improved the PCE of planar MAPbI3 cells up to 19.1% and eliminated the photocurrent hysteresis.215 Fluorocarbon based molecules were another example of highly effective passivation agents for surface defects and grain boundaries. A representative example was 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) with excellent surface and GBs co-passivation capability. This co-passivation strategy led to a 53.3% PCE enhancement in MAPbI3 PSCs, with a champion PCE of 21.31% in CsFAMA-type PSCs, and exceptional stability with only 3% PCE loss after 2500 h of storage in 70% humidity.216 Acceptor-donor–acceptor type small molecules with carbazole as the core moiety, ester/amide as the acceptor unit and extended π-conjugation achieved through phenylene thiophene units at the 3,6-positions of carbazole were found to passivate traps/defects at the perovskite grain boundaries and result in larger perovskite grains.217 The multifunctional amide group exhibiting a Lewis base adduct character were attached to under-coordinated Pb2+ ions in the perovskite film, facilitating bifacial defect passivation and reducing the grain boundaries. The best performance was evidenced by a PCE of 18.96% which, after 1000 h storage in Ar atmosphere, retained 92% of the initial value.
Semiconducting squaraine molecules (SQ) with the zwitterionic structure were also demonstrated to interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions strongly. Simultaneous reduction of the deep level traps and passivation of GBs enhanced PSCs' efficiency, which retained 90% of their initial PCE after 600 h storage.218 Inorganic silanes constitute another excellent example for perovskite GB passivation. Trichloro(octyl)silane (TC-silane) modified the perovskite surface and passivated film GBs through cross-linking and forming a heat-resistive silicone layer, leading to a comprehensive improvement of PSC efficiency and stability against moisture and heat.219 TC-silane passivated PSCs delivered a PCE of 20.03% with only a 20% loss after more than 800 h at ∼75% RH in air and about 80 h under 85 °C thermal stress.
An approach to simultaneously control grain growth and passivate GBs in perovskite films was proposed by Lee et al. By adding the bifunctional non-volatile Lewis base additive urea (optimal concentration 4 mol%) to the perovskite precursor solution, a significant enhancement of grain size and homogeneity, as well as reduction in defect density, was achieved due to the increase of the activation energy to slow down crystal growth and the subsequent (after crystal growth formation) precipitation at the GBs to passivate defects.220 The high PL lifetime and elimination of trap mediated non-radiative recombination resulted in an improved PCE for MAPbI3 PSCs. Similarly, the bifunctional additive, biuret, and multiple Lewis base groups were highly beneficial in regulating perovskite crystallisation and passivating GB defects.221 Biuret interacted with under-coordinated Pb2+ and iodide ions from the iodoplumbate complex on two adjacent perovskite grains. The reader should also refer to recent articles that review the field of additive engineering of perovskite films and resultant solar cells.222


3.2.2 Polymer passivation. 
Conjugated or insulating polymers have also been applied to passivate GBs in perovskite thin films effectively. For example, a conjugated polymer additive, poly(bithiophene imide) (PBTI), was found to be effectively incorporated within GBs, resulting in reduced defect density and hence suppressed ion migration combined with an improved perovskite film crystallinity (Fig. 9).223 The successful defect passivation by PBTI yielded reduced recombination losses and high PCE and improved PSC stability. Optimized cells exhibited a PCE of 20.67% compared to 18.89% for the control devices, and they retained over 70% of initial efficiency after 600 h under illumination.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a well known organosilicon polymeric compound, was recently introduced during perovskite spin-coating to passivate perovskite grains and adjacent GBs simultaneously.224 It was found to promote the formation of lead oxide (PbO) bonding that prevented water reaction, while it simultaneously reduced the Pb defect density related to trap-assisted recombination. 0.04 wt% PDMS-passivated mixed-cation PSCs notably enhanced their performance with an average PCE of 15.44% and a higher than 90% of the initial PCE sustained after 5000 h storage under 70% RH.


3.2.3 Cross-linking of perovskite grains. 
A different though effective strategy to passivate defects generated at grain boundaries is through the formation of polymer–perovskite composites. This can be accomplished by cross-linking between polymer chains and perovskite using polymeric Lewis acid or bases.225 The non-radiative recombination centres present at the GBs are being passivated since the cross-linker acts as a bridge for the neighbouring perovskite grains. The resulting perovskite films and devices yield excellent environmental stability against moisture, light, and heat (Fig. 10a and b). Similar results can be obtained through the application of organic small molecules as cross-linkers. A representative example is the organic additive trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMTA) which was chemically anchored to perovskite GBs, and then in situ formed a robust continuous network polymer after thermal treatment.226 This strategy enabled significant enhancement in the modified perovskite films' thermal, water and light-resisting properties (Fig. 10c and d). PSCs using TMTA cross-linked perovskite films exhibited exceptional performance combined with operational stability, retaining almost 80% of their efficiency after continuous illumination for 400 h at the MPP tracking. Besides, under moisture or thermal (85 °C) conditions, excellent stability was attained with over 90% of their initial efficiency to be preserved after ageing for over 1000 h.

The amino acid iodide salt-based molecular cross-linker p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA·HI), upon adding to a perovskite precursor solution, was demonstrated to effectively interact with the Pb–I framework via hydrogen bonds with enhanced cross-linking efficiency. Its rigid molecular structure originated this compared to freely rotating flexible molecular cross-linkers. Consequently, efficient GB passivation by PABA·HI was achieved, and the PABA·HI-added PSCs yielded a PCE of 17.4% and retained 91% of the initial PCE when stored for 312 h at an RH of 75%.227 In a relevant approach, a trace amount of surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands (AALs) with different chain lengths were used as perovskite GB and interface modifiers in PSCs.228 Long-chain AALs added to the precursor solution resulted in a prominent (100) orientation, suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved the optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite films. The AAL modified films exhibited high carrier mobilities and long carrier diffusion lengths combined with suppressed surface and GB defects density. Their work function (WF) was significantly decreased, indicating an effective n-doping process and more efficient electron transport due to the change of the perovskite's surface termination upon AAL modification. These led to a certified stabilized PCE of 22.3% (23.0% for lab-measured cells) and stable cell operation for over 1000 h.
Moreover, low-dimensional perovskites (e.g. perovskite quantum wells, PQWs) with organic ligands were also utilized to protect the perovskite from degradation and improve PSC stability. Instead of employing van der Waals bonding between hydrophobic organic moieties of short-chain ligands to stabilize PSCs' perovskite interfaces, a chemically reactive ligand, namely 4-vinylbenzylammonium, was used to create well-ordered PQWs atop a 3D perovskite layer.229 The ligand's vinyl group was photochemically activated with UV light to form new covalent bonds among PQWs. UV-cross-linked 2D/3D devices showed improved operational stability and storage stability in the air with only a 10% loss of efficiency after 2300 h of dark ageing combined with an enhanced PCE of up to 20.4% and reduced hysteresis.


3.2.4 GB and surface co-passivation approaches. 
Simultaneous passivation of GBs and the fabricated perovskite films' surface is a practical approach that enables significant performance and stability enhancement in the perovskite solar cells. A universally applied double-side polymer-enabled GB defect passivation approach using ultrathin PMMA films resulted in exceptionally high-efficiency (∼20.8%) PSCs with one of the highest VOC (1.22 V).230 This was attributed to molecular interactions between different perovskites and PMMA, with the carbonyl (CO) groups on PMMA being solely responsible for the excellent passivation via Lewis-base electronic interactions with Pb2+ ions and the significant concomitant reduction in non-radiative recombination.
In a different approach, the number of GBs could be effectively reduced by merely introducing an appropriate (10 mol%) concentration of formamidinium (FAI) and chloride (PbCl2) ions into the MAPbI3 precursor solution.231 Inverted PSCs with larger grains and fewer GBs achieved a champion efficiency of 19.6% due to suppressing the rate of nonradiative recombination and lowering the trap state density. The synergy of the FA+ and Cl− ions led to a GB soldering process, which was highly beneficial to PCE enhancement. A similar strategy was followed by Xia et al., who proposed a novel chemical sintering with an NH4SCN solution as a fast (<1 min) and effective process to substantially reduce GB defects in different films of different PbI2-templated perovskites.232 Optimal sintering yielded PSCs with PCE of 19.68% with a 20% loss over 720 h in ambient air. Liu et al. further advanced GB engineering by proposing the construction of surface “patches” formed at the GBs via in situ conversion of residual PbI2 upon methimazole (MMI) treatment.233 The MMI–PbI2 complex's working mechanisms were the effective suppression of ion migration and the resulting passivation of GBs accompanied by an improved film quality and enhanced carrier transfer. As a result, MMI-treated PSCs exhibited a PCE of 20.10% with negligible hysteresis and prolonged lifetime, retaining ∼80% of the initial efficiency after 672 h continuous illumination. Concerning simultaneous GB and surface or interfacial defect passivation, recent efforts have focused on additive-based approaches. For example, GBs reduction and MAPbI3 surface passivation could be induced by a guanidinium thiocyanate (GITC)-assisted Ostwald ripening post-treatment.234 Formation of micron-sized grains and an enhanced interfacial recombination resistance with one order of magnitude longer carrier lifetime along with a more favourable energy level alignment with the adjacent SnO2 ETL led synergistically to PSCs with an enhanced PCE and mitigated hysteresis. Successful GB and interfacial defect passivation were alternatively realized by employing KCl as an additive in the SnO2 ETL.235 Specifically, K and Cl ions passivated the interfacial defects, whereas, meanwhile, K+ ions diffused through the perovskite film and passivated the GBs. A notable enhancement of the PCE from 20.2% to 22.2% was readily achieved for the SnO2–KCl modified PSCs.
Notably, compared with the widely applied polycrystalline perovskite thin films that need both GB and surface co-passivation approaches, single crystal perovskites present no GBs, indicating that they only require surface passivation methodologies.236 As a result, despite having being recently investigated, they show great potential for solar cells with high efficiency and stability especially when successful surface passivation approaches are also applied.237–239

4. Morphology and crystallinity control
The morphology of the perovskite film largely dictates the optoelectronic properties and, therefore, the performance of the fabricated solar cells. Morphology control represents an effective way to passivate defect states by obtaining highly crystalline, compact, pinhole-free perovskite films with optimized grain size and good substrate coverage. Several recent studies report on successful methodologies addressing the morphology engineering aspects, including a variation of the processing and post-treatment conditions, solvent annealing and solvent engineering approaches, gas-assisted deposition methods, use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), additive engineering, thermal annealing and some novel combinations. The compact, cohesive and highly crystalline perovskite films obtained with those methods result in enhanced PCE and improved long-term stability as well as reproducibility of the ensuing PSCs.
4.1 Methods to modify perovskite film morphology

4.1.1 Enlarged grain size using additives. 
Enlarged perovskite crystal size and preferential orientation of perovskites represent an effective way to increase thin film crystallization, obtain high-quality perovskite films with fewer grains, GBs and trap states, leading to significant enhancement to both efficiency and stability of PSCs. To achieve these goals, various strategies have been intensively investigated in recent years. Precursor additives have been vastly explored as a morphology/crystallinity modifiers as they modify the colloid distribution in the perovskite precursor and the coordination ability of lead cation and iodide anions present in the perovskite matrix through the formation of coordination bonds (i.e. hydrogen bond interactions) as these additives are incorporated within the perovskite lattice. The incorporation of hydrophobic sulfur (S) based ionic materials have been successfully employed in PSCs as morphology modifiers resulting in significant enhancement of the device performance.240 Moreover, the addition of solid iodine (I2) as precursor additive in a mixed-halide perovskite solution resulted in achieving large crystalline grain perovskite films with an optimized composition (i.e. homogeneous dispersion of MAPbCl3 and MAPbI3 throughout the film) and in improved efficiencies from 9.83% to 15.58%.241 Treating perovskite films with various iodide/chloride solutions or incorporating them into the precursor solutions led to different composition perovskite films with large grain sizes.242–245 For example, MA+-free FA+ and Cs+ mixed-cation perovskite thin films with micrometre-sized grains were fabricated upon treating the perovskite films with fluorinated ammonium iodide {4-fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide (4F-PEAI)} solution. This resulted in the formation of thin 2D (4F-PEA)2PbI4 films on the surface with a significant improvement in PL intensity and enhanced PCEs of 20.6% and 18.5% during reverse and forward scanning, respectively, compared to 18.6% and 17.0% for the untreated devices.242 Introduction of an optimized 3% concentration of caesium iodide to the precursor solution had a considerable effect on the morphology and optoelectronic properties of MAPbI3-based perovskite films. A high-quality, defect-free, smooth perovskite film with a large grain size of ∼1.8 mm was obtained, enabling the demonstration of mesoscopic MAPbI3 PSCs with a PCE of ∼19%, negligible hysteresis and enhanced stability under ambient conditions.243 Addition of guanidinium iodide into the perovskite precursor solution enabled the formation of high-quality perovskite films which endowed the ensuing PSCs with a reproducible photovoltage of 1.20 V. This was attributed to suppression of both non-radiative recombinations and interfacial charge accumulation.244
The influence of a chloride-anion based surface treatment using a perovskite precursor (MACl) acetonitrile solution to obtain high quality, homogeneous MAPbI3 films was examined by Uribe et al. MACl treatment had a dominant effect on increasing the grain size, passivating defects at GBs, enhancing crystallinity and improving PSC performance.245 Perovskite film treatment with hydrophobic fluorinated aliphatic amine hydroiodide compounds led to larger perovskite grains, a decreased number of GBs, suppressed carrier recombination and accelerated electron transfer. Thus, PCE of the amine-modified PSCs increased from 12.23% to 13.88%, maintaining this value by ∼85% after exposure to 50% RH for 10 days due to the enhanced film hydrophobicity.246 Addition of hydrohalic acids to the perovskite precursor solution initiated the dissolution of the lead polyhalide colloids present that provided nucleation sites for the perovskite crystallization, critically impacting morphology, crystal quality, and optoelectronic properties of a formamidinium–caesium mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite (Fig. 11a–d).247 Solution ageing time could control colloids' size and dispersion in the precursor solution, whereas highly ordered, and textured crystals were observed for films prepared from solutions with lower colloidal concentrations. As a result, an increase in the grain size, crystallinity, and texture could be achieved along with a two-fold increase in carrier mobilities leading to a PCE of 18.8%.

In a different approach, glucose was introduced in MAPbI3 to realize high-quality films, decreased defect density, enlarged grain size and a reduced amount of grain boundaries. PCE of inverted planar PSCs increased from 17.53% to 20.15%, accompanied by excellent reproducibility, suppressed hysteresis and enhanced stability in heat, light and moisture conditions.248 In a drastically different method, the addition of small dimethyl itaconate (DI) monomers into the PbI2 precursor solution triggered a polymerization-assisted grain growth during the PbI2 film annealing. During this process the bulkier polymers formed anchored on the GBs, effectively passivating under-coordinated lead ions and reducing the defect density (Fig. 11e–g).249 As a result, a champion PCE of 23.0% was obtained in FA1−xMAxPbI3 PSCs, together with a longer lifetime where 85.7% and 91.8% of the initial PCE remained after 504 hours continuous illumination and 2208 hours shelf storage, respectively. Furthermore, aniline,250 benzylamine144 and phenethylamine144 additives incorporated into the perovskite solution favour perovskite film quality.144,251 In that case, the degree of hydrophobicity arising from the aromatic group and the packing of the molecular additive (i.e. formation of j-aggregates) was the critical mechanisms for improved overall PSC performance. Another small molecule, pyrrole, was introduced into caesium containing triple cation perovskite precursor solution.251 It was demonstrated that pyrrole controlled the resulting film crystallinity and surface roughness, improved crystal quality, reduced trap density, and non-radiative recombination. The working mechanism combines its nitrogen atom with the lead–iodine (Pb–I) framework by either coordinating with the Pb ions or forming hydrogen bonds with the perovskite organic cation. Pyrrole-modified PSCs showed a high PCE of 20.07%, stabilized for more than 30 days storage at 10% RH. Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated an improved perovskite film quality by adding methylamine (MA) into the precursor solution.252 MA effectively passivated shallow electronic defects present at GBs, increasing carrier lifetime, upon molecular cross-linking on the perovskite grains through intense hydrogen bond interactions. Multiple functionalities of MA were unveiled; effective suppression of I2 impurities, acting as a Lewis base coordinating to Pb(II) to restrict I-rich iodoplumbate complexes, thus avoiding the disturbance of Pb/I stoichiometry, and interference with the film growth, leading to larger grains. Consequently, MA-treated PSCs reached an increased PCE with a peak value of 20.02%. Introduction of the bivalent alkyldiammonium cation ethylenediamine (EDA2+) into the perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3PbI3) film was found to form a triple cation perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 as a light absorber.253 PSCs fabricated with the optimized absorber with the composition (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 (x = 1.5%) achieved a PCE of 20.01% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the devices retained 96% of their initial efficiencies after 25 days of storage in an ambient atmosphere. Conjugated large-volume amines such as 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA) were later introduced in solution in formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) perovskite. The corresponding films showed an enlarged grain size, reduced trap density, preferential crystal orientation and enhanced structural stability. Efficient, self-healed, PSCs with negligible hysteresis and highly robust stability (maintaining 92% of the initial PCE after 1440 h) were demonstrated.253 Incorporation of bilateral alkylamine (BAA) additives and the associated anchoring of monolayer bilateral amino groups also led to surface defect passivation and enhanced stability by exposing the linking hydrophobic alkyl chain.254 A PCE of 21.5% with a record-small VOC deficit of 0.35 V and an improved device shelf lifetime to >1000 hours and operational stability to >500 hours under light, with 90% of the initial efficiency retained, were achieved.
Hydrogen halogens, such as hydroiodic and hydrobromic acids, have been shown to significantly affect the perovskite morphology by dissolving large perovskite particles into smaller ones with a more uniform distribution.255 As an example, Heo et al., fabricated uniform perovskite films by introducing HBr to the precursor solution.256 Inclusion of HBr aqueous solution in a MAPbBr3 DMF solution retarded the nucleation time during the spin-coating process due to the improved solubility. It resulted in dense perovskite films with higher surface coverage. Accordingly, planar HBr-modified MAPbBr3 PSCs exhibited the highest PCE with decreased hysteresis.
Additive-assisted perovskite crystal growth employing oxalic acid (OA) with two bifacial carboxylic acid groups into the perovskite precursor solution was also successful. It facilitated the crystallisation process's modulation leading to increased grain size, reduced GBs and trap states. Subsequently, OA-modified cells reached an enhanced PCE and demonstrated greatly enhanced thermal stability as they retained 70% of the initial efficiency after 19 hours.257 Similarly, Huang et al. employed hydrobromic acid to assist the crystallization and improve the surface coverage of MAPbI3−xClx.258 As a result, a superior quality perovskite layer with fewer pinholes and lower surface roughness was obtained, which led to improved and stabilized PSC performance.
A series of organic halide salts having different organic cations and halide anions to control the perovskite film morphology and crystallinity were also employed as additives in PSCs. For example, organic halide salts with other bulky aromatic organic cations and halide anions were applied as processing additives in a MAPbI3−xClx perovskite film. It was shown that both the perovskite film's morphology and crystallinity were critically dependent on the organic halide salts' types and concentrations. Among them, tetraphenylphosphonium iodide (TPPI) and chloride (TPPCl) were the most efficient in improving the film crystallinity, and surface coverage I− and Cl− anions chelated to the Pb2+ cations affected the kinetics of film formation. Consequently, the PCE reached ≈11.5% for the additive-enhanced cells.259 Upon incorporation of 5 mol% n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) in a FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05PbI2.5Br0.5 perovskite film, a two-dimensional (PA)2PbI4 with the Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite was formed through the reaction between PAI and PbI2.260 Furthermore, fewer –COOH (carboxyl) groups were present on the perovskite film surface containing (PA)2PbI4, indicating the suppressed penetration of oxygen and moisture into the perovskite. In contrast, the film also exhibited greatly enhanced hydrophobicity and an upshift of its conduction band minimum by 0.16 eV, leading to a more favourable interfacial energy alignment. Consequently, an improved PCE of up to 17.23% with suppressed hysteresis was obtained in PSCs that retained ∼50% of the initial efficiency after 2000 hours in the air under 45% RH.
Tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) addition into the perovskite (CsPbI2.4Br0.6) precursor solution also induced a larger grain size and increased crystallinity films.261 The fabricated PSCs exhibited a PCE of 15.21% while also retained over 93% of this efficiency upon storage in N2 for 1600 hours. Alternatively, a multifunctional 1,6-diaminohexane dihydrochloride (1,6-DD) additive was introduced into the precursor solution.262 A small amount of this additive modulated crystallization dynamics and yielded films with enhanced crystallinity and enlarged grain size. Notably, its two terminal –NH3+ groups passivated the vacancy defects at the perovskite crystal surface, suppressing charge recombination and facilitating charge transport. In contrast, its hydrophobic hexane alkyl chains increased the moisture resistance of the perovskite film. Furthermore, adjacent crystal surfaces were linked through the additive hexane alkyl chain, thus enhancing the interaction between perovskite grains and anchoring the perovskite film's microstructure. The modified cells' PCE was improved by 20%, while the efficiency maintained to above 90% of the initial value after exposure to air for 16 days. Meanwhile, simpler chloride molecules, like PbCl2, MACl, FACl, and CsCl that bear Cl− anions, also enabled effective passivation or doping of the perovskite material. Chlorine anion was shown to alter thin film morphology and crystallisation, providing larger grains with smooth discontinuities around them.263
Introduction of the lead thiocyanate Pb(SCN)2 additive up to 2 mol% concentration in a DMF precursor solution improved the mixed-cation lead mixed-halide crystallinity FA0.8Cs0.2PbI2.68Br0.32 perovskite and, overall, enhanced film quality by increasing grain-size, lowering the number of pinholes, and reducing trap density.264 Pb(SCN)2-modified PSCs showed a high PCE with reduced hysteresis and remarkably high moisture stability, maintaining ∼85% of their initial efficiency in the ambient environment (∼60% RH) after 45 days. Similarly, Pb(SCN)2 additive combined with DMF annealing markedly increased the grain size of the mixed-cation lead mixed-halide (FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3) perovskite thin films from 66 nm to 1036 nm with a 3-fold increase in carrier lifetime while avoiding excess PbI2 formation. As a result, the device exhibited an enhanced as well as stabilized PCE.265
Recently, a simple novel approach was proposed by Bai et al. regarding the practical use of ionic liquids (ILs) as additives in PSCs for the first time.266 In particular, incorporating 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) in a perovskite precursor solution led to the formation of lead halide/imidazolium halide complexes, enhanced crystallinity and reduced defects in the corresponding films. IL-Modified p–i–n planar heterojunction (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 PSCs exhibited outstanding long-term operational stability, as manifested by a decrease in performance of only ∼5% for encapsulated devices under continuous illumination for more than 1800 hours at ∼75 °C, and a high PCE of 19.8%. Another promising approach was introducing a stoichiometric amount of tropolone as a chelating agent for the lead, which facilitated the growth of a uniform mixed cation perovskite layer with excellent surface coverage. More specifically, tropolone was found to be present only during the colloidal liquid phase while absent from the perovskite film during its formation due to its unique characteristics of low melting and boiling temperatures. Devices with a maximum PCE of 20% were demonstrated, a 25% increase concerning the reference cells.267
Other highly encouraging approaches include the use of graphene,268 nanoparticles269 and polymer-based additives.270,271 Specifically, the addition of graphene oxide (GO) in the precursor solution led to improved quality MAIPbI3 films.268 1 vol% of GO was found to modulate the perovskite film growth by increasing the grain size and film uniformity and enhance film crystallization with preferential out-of-plane orientation. GO-Modified n–i–p planar heterojunction PSCs showed an enhanced PCE with reduced hysteresis. Introduction of CsPbBr3 nanoparticles (NPs) into the chlorobenzene antisolvent allowed them to act as nucleation centres in the MAPbI3 film growth process and considerably improved its quality in terms of film morphology and crystallinity, leading to reduced recombination and improved charge transfer.269 Furthermore, they induced the formation of a Cs1−yMAyPbI3−xBrx passivation layer on top of the perovskite layer, resulting in a much improved device performance with a PCE of 20.46% along with enhanced stability (Fig. 12).

Nanostructures, such as BiFeO3 (BFO) oxide perovskite one, incorporated as an additive in MAPbI3 during the spin-coating of the precursor solution were shown to serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites during the crystal growth of MAPbI3 film and, as a consequence, increased the perovskite crystal grain size, the film crystallinity and its uniformity.270 As a result, the trap density decreased, while the charge carrier mobility and electron diffusion length increased, leading to significant enhancement in JSC and the corresponding PCE. Incorporating sulfonated carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) in the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution resulted in several MAI molecules interacting with s-CNTs in the precursor solution and filling of the GBs during the spin-coating process. Upon heating of the film, this was followed by an increase of the grain size due to the continuous evolution of the perovskite grain growth.271 Meanwhile, solution-processed electron buffer layers such as PCBM among others could be used to assist in the growth of compact overlayer perovskite thin films. A stabilized PCE of 17.6% at the MPP with a VOC of 1.11 V was obtained for PCBM-modified devices.272
On the other hand, polymer modifiers with different coordinating groups, such as poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) were demonstrated to improve the electronic properties of the MAPbI3 films markedly and significantly enhance device PCE from 16.9% to 18.8% with a very high VOC of up to 1.16 V as well as shelf lifetime up to 90 days (retaining 85% of the initial efficiency).273 The mechanism behind this improvement was the changes of trap states which was highly dependent on the functional groups and their interaction with the perovskite. Pyridine group with high binding energy with Pb2+ was more effective in trap-state passivation than the carboxylic group with low coordination energy. Defect states could be effectively passivated by chemical groups that donate electron density, likely by sharing lone electron pairs with the empty 6p orbitals of under-coordinated Pb2+ sites. Another polymeric additive, namely polycaprolactone (PCL), was highly effective in enhancing the crystal grain size (>400 nm), reducing surface defects, ensuring uniform coverage and promoting the mechanical strength of entirely flexible PSCs.274 PCL exerted a substantial effect on crystal growth as the carbonyl groups in PCL formed an intermediate adduct with Pb2+. Champion cells exhibited a 38% enhancement in their PCE which was retained to ∼90% of the initial value after 300 bending cycles.
A synergistic strategy involved combining two additives, MACl and MAH2PO2, in the perovskite precursor solution for practical, synergistic, grain size engineering.275 MACl could enable preferential grain growth, increase the grain size and produce smoother films, while MAH2PO2 complimentarily suppressed non-radiative recombination at GBs. Together, they promoted grain growth further, lowered trap density and increased carrier recombination lifetime, enabling an enhanced device performance in tandem cells. Furthermore, simultaneous incorporation of fluoride and iodide based additives (SnF2 and GeI2) also revealed their strong impact in trap passivation FA0.75MA0.25Sn1−xGexI3 based PSCs by suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and reducing trap state density, respectively.276 As a result, a longer charge diffusion length (∼1 μm) and lifetime were obtained, coupled with considerable carrier mobility and a PCE of 7.9%.


4.1.2 Solvent annealing. 
MAPbI3 grain cluster size can also be tuned via solvent annealing, whereas perovskite film crystallization and the crystal orientation are near related to the substrate's surface chemistry and wettability. Solvent annealing (SA) has been demonstrated as a highly effective passivation method for controlling perovskite defect states and promoting grain growth and crystal size and orientation, as precursor ions may diffuse over long distances presence of solvent during annealing. Hydrophilic surfaces were favourable for the growth of large perovskite grains that showed an order of magnitude lower trap densities than smaller ones. As a result, large cluster sizes led to longer charge recombination lifetimes and higher device VOC.277 Note that the concentration of the perovskite solution may have a massive impact on the crystallite size and the rotation speed during the spin-coating process can determine the layer coverage of the perovskite film.278 Exposure of the complete PSCs to ambient air could be essential to obtain the highest PCE as, for example, in the case of methylammonium bismuth iodide (MBI) PSCs. For high-performance PSCs under ambient fabrication conditions, a novel pre-nucleation strategy was recently proposed in order to obtain a compact and uniform perovskite layer. Specifically, a programmed sample spinning and multiple antisolvent dripping methods to continuously form the PbI2·2DMSO and Pb2I4·2DMSO complexes and thus prolong the nucleation of the intermediates preventing the water-assisted growth into a too large size was employed.279 Conversion to a high-quality perovskite film could be simply achieved by heating or simply ageing at room temperature. Impressively, these PSCs achieved a highly reproducible PCE of 18.8% (more than a factor of 2 higher than the reference cells).
An organic solvent vapour atmosphere introduced during the spin-coating and formation of the perovskite film was proposed to alter MAPbI3 crystal orientation and the grain size. It was found that 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapour atmospheres were more useful to obtain slightly more extensive and more oriented MAPbI3 grains.280 Both DCB and DMSO treatment reduced the trap density and oriented the perovskite grains resulting in a longer charge recombination lifetime and high VOC, FF and PCE for PSCs (Fig. 13).

Another approach focused on the SA of the PbI2 precursor to facilitate its conversion to MAPbI3. Only DMSO led to porous PbI2 films from the employed solvents, which aided the complete conversion to the perovskite film with a larger grain size.281 On the other hand, DMF, acetone and 2-propanol (IPA) resulted in dense PbI2 films, which hindered the complete conversion to MAPbI3. Efficiencies of up to 18.5% were obtained for the DMSO-SA films. Mixed solvent vapour annealing was introduced as an alternative method to improve the performance of PSCs. A DMF/CB mixed solvent (1:20, v/v) for 6 min was the optimal treatment to obtain very smooth, crystalline, MAPbI3−xClx films and PSCs with an enhanced PCE combined with high reproducibility and stability.282 Similarly, a mixed antisolvent (IPA) and solvent (DMF) (100:1, v/v) vapour environment could significantly improve the perovskite film quality, increase the grain size and the film crystallinity and, consequently enhance as well as stabilize the PCE of MAPbI3 based PSCs.283 The same treatment also led to highly efficient MAPbI3−xClx cells with a PCE of up to 18.9% with improved storage stability. Other high boiling point solvents have also been highly successful in the SA treatment of PSCs. For example, a novel g-butyrolactone (GBL) solvent vapour post-annealing treatment on MAPbI3 improved the complete transformation of PbI2, increasing the crystal grain size and film crystallinity and reducing GBs. This effectively promoted charge dissociation and transport and boosted the performance of mesoporous MAPbI3 PSCs, mainly due to the significant increase of the JSC.284 Alternatively, n-butanol was employed in a mixed MAI/IPA solution. The obtained perovskite films exhibited an enhanced density and absorbance and larger grain size as n-butanol prevented the fast solvent evaporation in the MAI/IPA solution. SA-modified MAPbI3 PSCs reached an optimum stabilized PCE of 14.81%.285 SA has also recently been extended to preparing novel, high-quality 2D perovskite films. For example, enhanced crystallinity 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 thin films could be produced with denser, larger-crystal grains and increased carrier diffusion lengths, reaching promising device efficiencies.286


4.1.3 Template-induced film growth. 
In a different strategy, appropriate materials were used as templates to control perovskite film nucleation. For example, PMMA was recently used as a useful template to control perovskite nucleation and crystal growth. Polymer-templated heterogeneous nucleation and growth enabled smooth perovskite films of high quality with remarkably long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime to be obtained and stable PSCs with a PCE of 21.6% and excellent reproducibility to be realized.287 PMMA was found to slow down the perovskite crystal growth by forming an intermediate adduct with PbI2, allowing the randomly formed nuclei to adjust their orientation to minimize the total Gibbs free energy and grow in the thermodynamically preferred direction.
Wang et al. reported a templated growth mechanism of layered perovskites along the out-of-plane direction from 3D-like ones. This growth method enabled the achievement of enhanced carrier transport and improved PSC performance. The method involved incorporating additional ammonium halide salts in the precursor solution to suppress the nucleation of both layered and 3D perovskites inside the solution and force the film formation to start from the solution surface (Fig. 14).288 Fast drying of the solvent resulted in 3D-like perovskites which could surprisingly act as templates for the growth and nucleation of layered perovskites, enabled by the periodic corner-sharing octahedra networks on the surface of 3D-like perovskites and the lattice matching between layered perovskites and corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra chains.

In another approach, addition of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to perovskite films as additives functioned simultaneously as crystal growth templates and charge bridges between perovskite grains. SWNTs retarded the crystal growth and functioned as the cross-linker between perovskite grains.289
Also, sodium deoxycholates attached to the SWNTs passivated the GBs by forming Lewis adducts.290 As a result, more uniform perovskite films with larger crystal grains were obtained, and a high PCE of 19.5% was obtained. A soft template controlled growth method was proposed by introducing (adamantan-1-yl)methanammonium to control the nucleation and growth rate of CsPbI3 crystals. This method produced smooth, pinhole-free, CsPbI3 films with a crystal grain size on a micrometre scale, significantly reduced defect density and non-radiative charge recombination, and yielded PSCs remarkable efficiency of 16.04%, which retained 90% of the initial efficiency after 3000 hours of continuous illumination and heating.
The perovskite layer morphology can be effectively controlled by inserting appropriate interlayers underneath the perovskite absorber. For example, a hydrophilic groups (C–O and CO) grafted buffer layer (HGGBL) deposited on the non-wetting hole transporting material (HTM) resulted to a significant reduction of the surface potential and surface tension force and found to serve as morphology modifier for the perovskite overlayer, thus facilitating the growth of large perovskite crystals.291 In addition, the carbonyl groups tightly bonded with perovskite via Lewis base sites, inducing the formation of a compact, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite film with low bulk defect density. As a result, the fabricated inverted planar PSCs' photovoltaic performance was dramatically boosted with their PCE and reproducibility, additional merit of PSCs towards commercialization.


4.1.4 Colloidal engineering. 
Perovskite precursor solutions are generally colloidal dispersions, with a colloidal size up to the mesoscale, rather than real solutions. The soft colloid is made of a coordination complex in the form, for example, of a Pb polyhalide framework between organic and inorganic components, which can be structurally tuned by the coordination degree. Utilization of coordination engineering by employing additional MA halide in excess of the stoichiometric ratio for tuning the coordination degree and mode in the initial solution, along with a thermal treatment for the release of excess MA halides, led to conformal coverage, preferential orientation, and high purity perovskite thin films of exceptional quality.292 Furthermore, an excess organic component reduced the colloidal size and tuned the framework's morphology, whereas partial chlorine substitution accelerated the crystalline nucleation process. Combining colloidal chemistry and coordination engineering, planar PSCs with a PCE as high as 17% with suppressed hysteresis were demonstrated.
A simple treatment of the perovskite surface with various iodide, bromide or chloride-based perovskite solutions is an alternative method for controlling perovskite film quality.293,294 For example, methylammonium bromide (MABr) solution treatment via spin-coating with an optimized concentration was highly effective in forming large-grain, pinhole-free, MAPbI3−xBrx thin films, induced by the Br-related lower surface energy of perovskite crystallites facilitating a highly-selective Ostwald ripening process. High-efficiency PSCs based on compact MAPbI3−xBrx films with a ∼19% PCE and improved stability could be obtained.272 Phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) post-treatment notably stabilized CsPbI3-based PSC performance by both gradient halide (Br) doping and surface organic cation passivation. The PTABr treatment significantly stabilized the perovskite phase and enhanced the PSC performance combined with improved stability (Fig. 15a).294 Surface treatment of β-CsPbI3 films with choline iodide resulted in stable, highly crystalline, films upon surface trap state passivation with increased carrier lifetime and improved energy-level alignment in treated PSCs with stable efficiencies reaching 18.4% under 45 °C ambient conditions.24

Meanwhile, control of the perovskite film surface chemistry by applying a series of postdeposition ligand treatments on polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin films showed that a variety of Lewis bases acting as electron donors could markedly reduce non-radiative recombination, improve the bulk PLQE and increase the PL lifetime, 〈τ〉, with extensive enhancements concentrated at GBs. Thin-film PLQE as high as 35% and 〈τ〉 as long as 8.82 μs at solar equivalent carrier densities using tri-n-octylphosphine oxide-treated films were demonstrated.295 Further improvements have resulted in surface-treated MAPbI3 thin films with excellent passivation, thus reaching a very high quasi-Fermi-level splitting of 97.1% of the radiative limit and an internal PLQE of 91.9% under 1 sun illumination intensity, which sets a benchmark for perovskites.296 On the other hand, the colloidal clusters act as nucleation centres for growth and crystallization control of the perovskite, hence directly modulating the resultant film crystallization and morphology (Fig. 15b and c).297,298 Notably, through careful management of the colloidal precursor, highly reproducible and high performing (PCE > 21% in devices based in presynthesized FAPbI3) stable PSCs can be achieved.299

4.2 Control of perovskite film crystallinity
Precise control over the perovskite film crystallization process and its kinetics combined with uniform film formation and optimal surface coverage are highly critical factors to reduce trap density and boost fabricated devices' performance. It was previously demonstrated that nanoscale microstructural defects residing within individual grains of solution-processed MAPbI3 thin films are responsible for undesired interfacial recombination. Co-Annealing of the as-deposited MAPbI3 layer with PCBM that served as the electron transporting layer (ETL) could markedly eliminate interface defects and improve intragrain crystallinity by facilitating a highly coherent crystallographic orientation within individual grains.300 Compositional engineering of the perovskite absorber was also proven beneficial in providing superior crystalline quality films with fewer defects and enhanced photostability. For example, Cs incorporation within the efficient lead mixed halide perovskites significantly suppressed the unwanted halide segregation under photo-illumination, the cause of high PSC photoinstability. Snaith and co-workers optimised the Cs content to obtain perovskite films with high crystalline quality and long charge-carrier lifetimes.301 They showed that photo-induced halide segregation was significantly suppressed, leading to better device performance and superior photostability of the fabricated solar cells. In the following sections, we summarize recent advances in efficient control of perovskite films crystallinity to boost the overall PSC performance.

4.2.1 Crystallinity control through additives. 
The insertion of additives into the perovskite precursor solution has been found beneficial in terms of high crystallinity of the resultant perovskite film.302 Different processing additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)302 and diiodoperfluoroalkyl-based ones303 could modulate the crystal growth resulting in the deposition of perovskite films with high crystallinity. A notable example regards bidentate halogenated additives, capable of temporarily chelating with Pb2+ ions during crystal growth, thus facilitating homogenous nucleation and altering the kinetics of crystal growth. The ultimate result was much smoother and continuous film surfaces and a high PCE (∼19%) was obtained in MAPbI3−xClx PSCs.304 Addition of NH4SCN into the perovskite precursor solution also resulted in perovskite films with an increased crystal grain size, lower trap-state density, enhanced crystallinity and carrier transport, leading to PSCs with a champion PCE of 19.36% for triple-cation perovskites.305
An effective acetate mediation strategy for significantly retarding the crystallization process and thus the phase transformation in CsPbI2Br perovskite was demonstrated via the addition of acetate like cobalt(II) acetate (Co(Ac)2) or zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2).306 The proposed mechanism involved the growth of the perovskite crystal following the Ostwald ripening mechanism at 270 °C annealing temperature, during which the acetate would be left out from GBs. Both acetates led to forming a flat, dense and defect-free perovskite film and improved the device stabilized efficiency. Sub-micrometre swellable polymer colloid particles (i.e. microgels, MGs) were employed as additives to prepare uniform thin MAPbI3 perovskite films. MGs promoted high quality, pinhole-free, film formation with improved coverage by acting as colloidal sponges, thereby delaying perovskite crystallization.307 Moreover, Pb coordination by the MGs and passivation of MAPbI3 was also noted, resulting in improved performance MAPbI3 PSCs. A minimal amount (<0.1 wt%) of a non-volatile polymer additive, poly(ethylene glycol) tridecyl ether (PTE), could be incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution to control the film crystallization kinetics.308 A smoother film surface was obtained, combined with suppressed charge recombination both among free carriers and between trapped and free carriers. These led to an improved PCE and enhanced electrical operational stability for MAPbI3 PSCs. 2D-3D heterojunctions could be formed upon using a small amount of the organic halide salt (DMEDAI2) for perovskite surface functionalization and modulation of crystallization, resulting in the formation of an ultrathin wide-bandgap 2D perovskite layer on top of the 3D MAPbI3. Reduced surface defects and improved crystallinity led to PSCs with an exceptional PCE of ∼20.2% and enhanced stability.309
Polymers have also been applied as crystallinity modulators/template growth in perovskite films. A thin layer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a well-known hygroscopic polymer, enabled highly stable PSCs during operation and in a humid atmosphere when coated on top of the perovskite film.310 It was demonstrated that PEO chemically interacts with undercoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite surface, and thus passivates the corresponding defect sites. In the presence of PEO, unencapsulated PSCs retained more than 95% of their initial PCE over 15 h illumination in ambient atmosphere. In addition, polymer passivation layers could enhance the device VOC when inserted at the perovskite–charge transport layer interfaces.311 Similarly, an optimal amount of insulating polystyrene (PS) inserted in the perovskite precursor solution could also control film crystallization, improve surface coverage and result in smoother and more uniform perovskite thin films with larger grain size. PS-modified PSCs with a PCE exceeding 13% were realized along with improved stability.312 Different self-doped organic and inorganic components were also found to regulate perovskite film crystallization and electrical properties. Typically, the organic components enhanced conductivity and reduced hysteresis, while the inorganic components could effectively promote crystal growth, reduce GBs and surface defects. However, a critical composition was required to benefit perovskite crystallization with enhanced crystal size and pinhole-free morphology. The corresponding mixed-cation PSCs achieved a high efficiency over 19.14% and good stability.313 However, the size of perovskite crystallites could be decreased upon the addition of polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) due to phase separation in the perovskite–polymer mixture.314 Nevertheless, PAA highly suppressed the formation of hydrate perovskite phases, contributing to an improvement in the stability of perovskite films under humid air and ambient illumination. These results demonstrated that proper material choice to create a polymer–perovskite hybrid phase could significantly prolong the device lifetime.


4.2.2 Substrate controlled crystallization. 
The crystal growth process may be affected by external parameters, such as the substrate's wettability and roughness.315 For example, replacing the commonly used TiO2 bottom ETL in regular planar PSCs with lanthanum (La)-doped barium stannate (BaSnO3) (LBSO) layer which, besides its high electron mobility and appropriate electronic structure, initiated better crystallization of the MAPbI3 perovskite. As a result solar cells with a steady-state PCE of 21.2% and remarkable photostability (they retained 93% of the initial performance after 1000 hours of full sun illumination) were fabricated.316 Similarly, Yang et al., demonstrated the beneficial growth of CsPbIBr2 films deposited on an indium sulphide (In2S3) ETL.317 The reduced Gibbs free energy of the ETL surface promoted the formation of a compact, smooth and pinhole-free perovskite film with high crystallinity, which enabled good overall device performance. Tian et al., modified the surface wetting of the tin oxide (SnO2) bottom ETL in regular planar PSCs by coating a hydrophobic amino-functionalized polymer film, PN4N, onto its surface.318 With their method, the number of CsPbI2Br perovskite nuclei sites was significantly decreased, enabling larger crystals with fewer grain boundaries. The resultant perovskite film exhibited a high degree of crystallinity with low defect density, contributing to significant device performance improvement. Added to the merits, a high photostability was demonstrated for the fabricated cells, which retained more than 90% of the initial efficiency under continuous 1 sun illumination for 400 hours.
Besides altering the underlayer's wetting properties, the morphology and crystalline quality of the perovskite layer can be further controlled through adjustment of the substrate temperature. Zhang et al., demonstrated that by heating the substrate they could influence the crystallization process of a mixed cation mixed halide perovskite (in particular, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) through the formation of intermediate phases.319 Their results showed that elevating the substrate temperature can modify the perovskite film morphology from a pure dendritic to a dendritic/island structure (Fig. 16). The perovskite films with fewer islands also exhibited lower defect density and better device performance. Regarding more advanced perovskite structures, crystallization in the highly promising quantum well Ruddlesden–Popper phase halide perovskites could be controlled by managing their molecular stacking and crystal orientation. For example, 2D BA2MA3Pb4I13 perovskites depicted an enhanced vertical crystal orientation on a PTAA HTL, resulting in polycrystalline films with suppressed charge recombination and p–i–n PSCs displaying a champion PCE of 14.3% with negligible hysteresis.320

4.2.3 Post-deposition treatments. 
Post-deposition treatments can also affect crystallization control. For example, the temperature and duration of thermal post-treatment are key factors influencing the morphology, crystallization and optoelectronic properties of the resultant perovskite film. Post-annealing in a controlled (nitrogen) atmosphere played a decisive role in the crystallization and preferential orientation of perovskite films and improved PCE after optimizing the annealing time. Specifically, as-prepared films underwent a gradual transition from distinct, mainly precursor, crystalline structures into a highly ordered perovskite structure upon ramping the temperature followed by a re-crystallization process.321 Very recently, an unprecedented low-temperature (<80 °C) and ultrafast microwave (MW) annealing process was employed to yield, upon optimization of the power and the irradiation time, uniform, compact, and crystalline formamidinium–cesium mixed-cation lead mixed halide perovskite films with excellent coverage and micrometre-scale grains.322
Another alternative growth method, termed vertical recrystallization, was proposed, which used methylammonium chloride (MACl) to obtain compact mixed-cation formamidinium perovskites with high crystallinity in a vertical orientation, thus minimizing vertical GBs and trap sites.323 This yielded inverted-structure PSCs with an efficiency of up to 20.6% and light soaking and thermal stability as long as 500 hours. Additionally, a post-deposition reaction between a pre-existing perovskite film and methylamine (MA) gas has recently demonstrated the potential to improve film morphology and increase grain size drastically, boosting PSC performance.324 Furthermore, Zhang et al., employed a hot-air-flow (HAF) post-treatment method to control the crystallization of a CsPb2Br perovskite film.325 They succeeded in uniform rapid heating of the perovskite layer which induced rapid volatilization of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the vertical direction. In a different approach, Zai et al., expanded the spin-coating time and were able to enhance precursor mass transport in both directions (horizontal and vertical) directions, hence achieving better crystallization of the perovskite CsPbI2Br film.326


4.2.4 Solvent engineering. 
Solvent engineering is a widely applicable method to control nucleation and crystallization dynamics in perovskite thin films and effectively passivate traps. It is based on the principle that, during film deposition, the excess solvent is not removed. Still, a small quantity remains and assists in forming chemical adducts with the perovskite precursors that regulate nucleation, grain size and film growth. By adjusting the evaporation rate of solvent, the crystallization rate of perovskite could be controlled, and homogeneous pore filling in the mesoscopic structure was successfully achieved, leading to a PCE of 16.26% in ternary-cation based mesoscopic PSCs.327 A solvent-engineering approach successfully reduced the crystallization temperature of MAPbI3 single-crystal films (<90 °C) and in yielding improved crystalline quality grain-boundary-free, films with longer carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths. Following this approach, single-crystal inverted PSCs showed a markedly enhanced VOC of 1.15 V and a PCE of up to 21.9%, among the highest reported for MAPbI3-based cells.328 Applying ethyl acetate (EA) as an environment-friendly solvent treatment led to a dramatic improvement in PSCs' performance, with PCE as high as 18% with good stability. EA improved film morphology and crystallinity and, under optimized conditions, led to the formation of a self-induced textured structure that was highly beneficial for increasing the interface area between the perovskite layer and the HTL, thus enhancing photogenerated current density without affecting interfacial recombination.329 Similarly, acetic acid (Ac) was employed as an antisolvent in a one-step process to control perovskite crystallization (Fig. 17a–d).330 Ac reduced the film roughness and the amount of residual PbI2 and exerted a chemical passivation effect from the electron-rich carbonyl group (CO) in Ac, and regulated the perovskite film crystallization kinetics. PCEs of 22% and 23% were demonstrated for formamidinium–caesium mixed-cation lead mixed-halide PSCs (Cs0.05FA0.80MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) and (Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3, respectively, with negligible hysteresis and markedly enhanced device stabilities, maintaining even up to 96% of the initial efficiency after 2400 hours storage in the ambient environment. It has also been recognized that the precursor solution ageing time, before casting into a thin film, is an essential factor that critically affects the crystal formation, surface uniformity, and the trap state density of the perovskite film and overall device performance.331,332 Specifically, the precursor's progressive ageing for more than 24 hours dramatically promoted the efficient formation of larger crystals after the fast nucleation of smaller crystals. In contrast, hot-casting also led to the formation of perovskite films with superior crystallinity (Fig. 17e–g).331

The addition of formic acid significantly slowed down the degradation of dimethylformamide (DMF) involved in the precursor perovskite solution upon tuning the pH and hence the solution's colloid concentration.332 As a result, improved crystallization and optoelectronic quality of the resulting perovskite films with larger domains and more highly oriented crystals occurred, leading to devices with a record low loss in potential from bandgap to VOC of 0.36 V and PCEs of over 18% for MAPbI3−xClx based PSCs and up to 20% for mixed cation, mixed halide PSCs. This study identified a strong correlation between DMF degradation, solution pH, and perovskite crystallization, illustrating a fundamental mechanism that significantly impacted perovskite film crystallization.
Perhaps the most suitable solvent combination includes DMF and DMSO.333–336 This appropriate binary selection resulted in the formation of dense, compact, pinhole-free films of the mixed halide MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.1) hybrid perovskite with few GBs and grains with an average size of 450 nm and to the demonstration of PSCs with enhanced PCE.333 An optimal composition (volume ratio of 3:2) and precursor concentration also led to improved crystallization and pinhole-free film formation of inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite, thus achieving improved device performance and good stability under 100 °C stress and continuous light soaking.334 Similarly, it was applied to prepare high-performance planar 2D PSCs with efficiencies beyond 10% (up to 11.8%) and outstanding stability.335 In this method, the crystallization process includes two distinct steps. The first step is forming the flaky capping layer at the air–liquid interface, where heterogeneous nucleation primarily occurs as driven by fast DMF volatilization, with an intermediate product forming that retards crystallization. In the second step, the capping layer serves as a seed layer that forces the subsequent vertically growth and crystallization. Alternatively, acetonitrile/methylamine (ACN/MA) compound solvent system was explored in the precursor salt to deposit smooth, highly crystalline films of wide bandgap MAPbBr3 with the aid of a quaternary ammonium halide salt (choline chloride) as a passivating agent and yield PSCs with a PCE of up to 8.9%.336
Upon employing a two-step method, PbI2 and perovskite films were treated with isopropyl alcohol, acetone, diethyl ether and dichloromethane (Fig. 18a).337 Meanwhile, triethylenetetramine (TETA) was introduced as an alternative reagent to remove residual PbI2 altogether and prepare shiny, dense, pinhole-free films with sufficiently large grain sizes and enhanced crystallinity as well as PSCs with a 55% efficiency increase, compared to the other used solvents, in ambient air. A two-step sequential solvent engineering method including IPA in the first step and a mixed solvent of IPA/cyclohexane in the second step,338 facilitated the conversion of PbI2 to a compact MAPbI3 perovskite layer. The efficient and complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite involving different steps as diffusion, infiltration, contact, and the reaction is crucial, and their simultaneous optimization would facilitate high-quality film formation. As a result, a significant enhancement in device performance and reproducibility with a record PCE value of 14.38% for carbon-based PSCs was obtained owing mainly to the lower trap density, improved interfacial contact and faster charge transport (Fig. 18b). Asides from the conventional two-step deposition method, a three-step sequential coating method has been explored to prepare high-quality MAPbI3 layers based on solvent (isopropanol, lPA) substitution instead of annealing treatment. Stonehenge-like PbI2 films due to the volume expansion with controllable porosity and crystallinity were formed, allowing the complete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3. Consequently, PSCs with high reproducibility and a PCE of 17.78% was achieved.339

A different approach using solvent complexes in Bi-based perovskites resulted in compact films of methylammonium bismuth iodide (MABI), caesium bismuth iodide (CsBI), and formamidinium bismuth iodide (FABI). The selected complexes, DMF/DMSO and DMF/tBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) could increase the solubility of the Bi precursor, followed by a rapid onset of film nucleation via an antisolvent drip, thus effectively controlling growth and resulting in more uniform and dense Bi-based films with lower pinhole density during the spinning stage.340 Application of MABI as the photoactive component yielded devices with a PCE of 0.71%, the highest report value for MABI-based PSCs. Alternatively, antisolvent treatments can be utilized for the preparation of conformal, improved quality, perovskite films.341–347 For example, a simple antisolvent washing treatment using iodine modulation could significantly improve the MAPbI3 film quality and uniformity. The upgraded antisolvent enhanced the perovskite crystallization and passivated the under-coordinated Pb2+ ions. Modified planar heterojunction n–i–p PSCs showed an exceptional PCE of 21.33%, retaining 91% of its initial value in ambient after 30 days.341
An in situ tin(II) inorganic complex antisolvent process was proposed to tune the film nucleation and crystal growth process markedly. A unique formation of a quasi-core–shell structure of the Pb–Sn perovskite–tin(II) complex and heterojunction perovskite structure was achieved with the core–shell structure covered by a tin(II) complex at the GBs, effectively passivating trap states and suppressing nonradiative recombination.344 The mixed Pb–Sn low-bandgap PSCs delivered a remarkable PCE of 19.03% with a FF over 80% and outstanding operational stability of up to 560 h. Adjusting the ratio of two solvents in a mixed antisolvent could nicely regulate perovskite crystal quality and reduce surface defects associated with non-radiative recombination losses. For example, a volume ratio of 1:1 for toluene and diethyl ether was optimal for the fabrication of PSCs with a maximum PCE of 16.96%, negligible hysteresis and enhanced stability as the low boiling point and volatile diethyl ether solvent readily promoted the growth of perovskite grains.345
Green, environmentally friendly, solvents have received immense attention to replacing toxic antisolvents used in the fabrication of PSCs.346,347 In this regard, ethyl acetate (EA) demonstrated the potential to control film morphology in ambient humidity. Upon incorporating FAPbIBr2 into a MAPbI3 matrix, a very large grain size up to ∼1.5 μm could be achieved, resulting in reduced trap density and suppression of charge recombination. PCEs of optimized devices reached an impressive value of 20.93% with high stability as manifested by the very similar film morphologies and PCEs obtained under both dry and relatively high RH (50%) conditions due to the exceptional humidity resistance of EA.346 Another green, nonhalogenated, bifunctional (anti)solvent, methyl benzoate (MB), with a high boiling point and low volatility was developed as both an antisolvent to generate crystal seeds during spin-coating and as a digestive-ripening solvent for the perovskite precursor to prevent the loss of organic components during the thermal-annealing stage and suppress the formation of various lead halide phases (Fig. 19a–d).347 As a result, planar n–i–p PSCs achieved an outstanding PCE up to 22.37% with negligible hysteresis and >1300 hours stability. Solvent-antisolvent combination has been explored to exploit their advantages synergistically.348,349 Ambient processed MAPbI3−xClx thin films with substantial grains (>5 μm), minimal GBs, excellent crystallinity and surface coverage could, for example, be obtained upon using an optimized combination of chlorobenzene and ethanol (3:1 volume ratio) to produce PSCs with a PCE of up to 14.0%.233 Unique adducts formed between CsI and precursor solvents and antisolvents have been found for the inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 that were not observed for other A-site cation salts.

These adducts, as well as PbI2–DMSO adducts, controlled nucleation and film crystallization. In particular, the use of a green solvent, methyl acetate (MeOAc), could promote crystallization by forming a CsI–MeOAc adduct and resulting in PSCs with a PCE of 14.4%349 In another strategy, non-traditional solvent engineering was introduced for low-temperature perovskite film processing. Solvent coordination was explored by using DMSO as an additive instead of co-solvent and mixed 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and dimethylacetamide as the primary solvents for the perovskite precursor (Fig. 19e).350 The coordination strength established a trade-off between fast and retarded film crystallization with the mixed solvent with 30% DMSO depicting a uniform, compact perovskite layer and high efficiency of 18.19%. A ternary-mixed-solvent method for the growth of high-quality mixed-cation lead mixed-anion perovskite films was realized by introducing NMP into the precursor solution.351 NMP was found to readily control the rapid nucleation and slow down crystal growth via the intermediate phase PbI2-NMP (Lewis acid–base adduct). Consequently, dense, large grain, pinhole-free perovskite films with long carrier lifetime were obtained that yielded PSCs with an outstanding PCE of 19.61% upon optimising the precursor solvent composition.
Combining volatile non-coordinating solvents to Pb2+ and low-volatile coordinating solvents was recently demonstrated to lead to both fast drying and large perovskite grains with adequate crystallinity at room temperature with good reproducibility. It was successfully employed in the fabrication of blade-coated modules with a PCE of up to 16.4%.352 2D perovskites with improved morphology and crystalline quality and more favourable perpendicular orientation were made with a mixed DMF/DMSO solvent and a small amount of hydroiodic acid (HI) additive. Fabricated PSCs exhibited a champion PCE of 12.04% with a high FF of 81.04% and improved environmental stability, benefiting from the hydrophobic behaviour of the organic spacing cation employed.353 A volatile solid glycolic acid (HOCH2COOH, GA) in a FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 precursor solution was explored as an alternative route to regulate perovskite film quality (Fig. 20). This could be achieved by sublimating GA before 150 °C in the perovskite film without any residual after annealing. The proposed mechanism involved the strong interaction between GA and Pb2+, thus yielding a champion device PCE as high as 21.32% with excellent stability. On the other hand, the utilization of a non-volatile thioglycolic acid (HSCH2COOH, TGA) with a similar structure to GA also induced large perovskite grains but with pinholes, leading to an increased defect density and a 20% decline in PCE.354

Thermal annealing (TA) is an alternative route to produce high quality, crystalline, perovskite thin films employed in the fabrication of improved performance PSCs. Critical parameters are the time and temperature of the TA process.355–358 Alternative methods, such as radiative TA (RTA)359 and rapid TA using UV light360,361 have also been proposed as simple, fast, processes for improved PSC performance. For example, rapid TA using intense UV pulsed light (IPL) initiated a radiative thermal response enabled by a suitable alkyl halide (diiodomethane, CH2I2) additive to the MAI/PbI2 precursor.360 CH2I2 dissociated upon UV exposure releasing iodine ions in the film, influencing the perovskite formation and reducing defect states. Optimization of the concentration of CH2I2 and the IPL processing parameters led to PSCs with improved film morphology, which increased their efficiencies from 10% to 16.5%, a considerable improvement compared to previous reports using the IPL method without the additive.249 IPL was also utilized to quickly fabricate efficient PSCs by annealing of both the SnO2 ETL and the mixed triple cation perovskite thin films.361 CH2I2 slowed down the film crystallization and improved the surface morphology by only supplying iodine cleaved by UV light during the IPL process. Efficiency for the IPL-modified PSCs reached a maximum of 12.56% when processed in ambient conditions with an RH of 60%. A novel flash infrared annealing method was also recently proposed as a rapid (1.2 s), cost-effective method to fabricate planar heterojunction PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 18% without using antisolvent.362
Synergistic solvent-based crystallization with subsequent TA of the PbI2 precursor could also be applied to prepare high-performance mesoporous PSCs.363 This method regulated the driving force to the crystallization of PbI2. It resulted in perovskite films exhibiting voids and spaces that would be highly favourable for efficient infiltration of MAI solution, leading to rapid, complete perovskite conversion, which also showed an enhanced light-harvesting ability. Mesostructured PSCs showed a significant PCE improvement with less hysteresis due to all the photovoltaic parameters' simultaneous enhancement.363 Moreover, a vacuum-assisted method under room temperature conditions in air,364 a novel cryogenic process instead of the conventional antisolvent method and treatment of the perovskite film with ammonium iodide isopropanol solution induced a significant enhancement in grain size and crystallinity.365,366 Performance parameters of representative examples of PSCs employing molecular compounds to control thin film morphology, grain size and crystallinity are summarized in Table 5. Description of stability measurements and obtained results in PSCs embedding passivation approached described herein are summarized in Table 6.

5. Conclusions and future perspectives
The perovskite photovoltaics community has recently embarked on an evolutionary race to make high-efficiency solar cells. It feels that progress should be made fast enough to prevent climate change. The advancements in solar cells performance have been remarkable with high efficiencies comparable to silicon counterparts to have been achieved in less than a decade. However, further efficiency enhancement combined with substantially improved environmental long-term stability and photostability under continuous illumination and thermal stress will allow this new technology to gain its market entrance. Although several extrinsic factors influence the device stability upon air exposure, illumination, and thermal stress, such as interfacial layers and encapsulation methods, addressing the intrinsic/structural instability of the perovskite itself is a prerequisite to improve PSCs overall performance and stability. To overcome the limitation of instability issues, several cation and anion optimization strategies have already been explored and opened routes for the optimization of perovskites optoelectronic properties through compositional tuning.367 To this end, colloidal chemistry proved to be a key aspect as the chemical structure of colloids/clusters in the perovskite precursor solution strongly influences the compositional uniformity and crystallinity in the grown perovskite film and eventually the device performance variation and stability. As such, colloidal chemistry has its discrete and important role in stabilizing the perovskite structure and addressing the challenges of reproducibility.
However, the significant sources of intrinsic instability in perovskites are inherent defects arising from the soft nature of crystal lattice and poor polycrystalline morphology of the resultant films. These issues can be successfully addressed through defect passivation using additives bearing appropriate functional groups, surface and interface modification, solvent engineering, interface and capping layers, or employing suitable methods for controlling the perovskite films' growth precursor additives, substrate modification, post-treatments and solvent annealing. The detrimental ion migration can also be impeded by applying effective passivation strategies that significantly suppress or even prevent defect formation, hence contributing to prolonged device photostability.
The most successful perovskite passivation approaches centre on additives that target to heal defects at grain boundaries, surfaces, and interfaces of the perovskite film. Additives generally suppress the notorious degradation mechanisms such as ion migration and charge accumulation induced degradation, hydrolysis at grain boundaries, halide segregation etc. They include several types of functional molecules that can be either incorporated within the device structure or removed during the fabrication process. A vast variety of additives have already been integrated with success into the perovskite framework.368,369 Despite successful results in the obtained efficiency, to further advance the application of additives as passivation agents a deepen understanding of their function and interaction not only with perovskite defects but also with the charge transporting interfaces besides trial and error studies should be actively pursued. For example, a strong correlation between their molecular structure (i.e. exploration of donor–π–acceptor entities) and properties such as the number of hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor,370 halogen bond donor or acceptor,371 the length of alkyl chains, the topological polar surface area of the capping layer forming molecules etc., and the achieved passivation levels is urgently needed. This can be accomplished by extensive theoretical calculations combined with targeted photophysical studies to reveal the underlying passivation mechanism(s). Moreover, whether these additives are homogeneously incorporated into the interior or accumulate at the GBs or even form aggregates needs to be studied and correlated with the device performance data. Appropriate imaging methods, such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, can reveal the structure–property relationship of perovskite materials before and after the application of additives. Additional effects such as the alteration of perovskites’ electronic structure upon additives inclusion into their lattice should also be extensively investigated. Additive engineering could result in local p- or n-type doping, leading to the formation of lateral homojunctions within each individual grain having tremendous impact on the charge recombination lifetimes. The potential formation of lateral homojunction due to additive-induced doping along grain boundaries should be investigated in parallel to the passivation effects as it greatly enhances the charge carrier diffusion length within perovskite grain and along grain boundaries, thus reducing charge recombination in polycrystalline perovskite film based solar cells.
The above paradigm emphasizes the tremendous role of in-depth exploration of the passivation mechanism and additional effects caused by the inclusion of additives into the perovskite lattice, GBs and surface. Nevertheless, the tremendous role of the chemical structure of the applied passivation agent is undeniable. Materials bearing appropriate functional groups to simultaneously passivate several types of defects, alter the electronic structure, cross-link neighbouring grains, elongate carrier diffusion lengths and induce hydrophobic properties should be designed and come into fruition. More systematic investigations to simultaneous enhance the material composition and impede defect formation are necessary.368,369 This will become possible through interdisciplinary scientific collaboration and perhaps through input from machine learning,370 which will provide guidelines for further developments of material and processes aiming to simultaneously achieve the above goals while also stabilize the high performance levels of perovskite solar cells. Machine learning, not only can study the trend of passivation capability, potential reactivity, doping etc., of several types of different molecules but also can create models according to which prediction and design of novel materials would be possible.371 It can also outline experiments to identify the impact of degradation factors on the different passivation agents including perovskite compositions and propose paradigms for maximizing long-term performance of perovskite solar cells.372
It is noteworthy that besides the development of appropriate passivation materials with multiple functions, which will have been successfully predicted prior to design and verified using a large variety of synergistic methods, the adoption of reliable stability test protocols that researchers should subject their solar cells remains a critical issue.373 For example, measuring the device PCE upon exposing at 1 sun illumination either on ambient air (at RT) or at 45 °C represents the most popular test, but more aggressive measuring conditions are probably needed to fully evaluate the degradation parameters. Up to now, scientific publications lack consistency in stability measurement parameters adopted and this prevents the deeper understanding of mechanisms causing the severe device instability. Commonly applicable stability procedures will shed more light in different degradation features and provide important feedback to chemists and engineers that work on the optimization of materials and device fabrication methods. Despite the fact that researchers generally follow a more flexible experimental approach to reveal the degradation mechanism of parameters under study, the development of widely applicable standards for testing the perovskite solar cell stability is imperative. Any photovoltaic technology must pass the IEC 61646 protocol of stability and lifetime in order to become commercially available.374,375 The testing standards focus on environmental parameters such as thermal cycling tests, freeze tests, illumination tests and damp heat tests. Notably, to guarantee lifetimes of at least 25 years, it is necessary to pass the IEC test multiple times.374 Apart from these environmental condition requirements, there are also economical and marketing standards to be met such as facile fabrication using low-cost materials and processes. For the organic photovoltaic devices, these standards are known as ISOS protocols.376 The same protocols also apply for the perovskite solar cell technology, however, with even stronger requirements due to the high hysteresis and the metastable modification of their properties caused by polarization effects during PSC operation, which might reduce the PCE under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions.377,378 However, even if efficient and stable PSCs are fabricated, producing stable modules and panels are the main challenges that need to be faced in order to bring these devices closer to the market. Over the last years, there is a considerable effort to fabricate perovskite modules (mini modules with an area of ∼10–200 cm2, sub-modules ∼200–800 cm2, modules ≥800 cm2).379,380 Precursor ink formulation,381 adhesion of the precursor perovskite ink with the charge transporting underlayer,382 control over the interfaces,383 and precursor ink coating methods,384 are critical for the efficiency and stability of the resultant modules.
Because the control over the perovskite precursor's ink composition and intrinsic defects of the resultant film becomes more difficult in the large production scale, this affects the cost of the assembly besides the efficiency and stability of the modules. To this end, absolute control of stoichiometry, defect density, electronic structure, optoelectronic properties, morphology and crystallinity and establishment of commonly accepted processing protocols in small area devices are necessary as they can provide guidelines for the further development of modules and panels. In brief, further advancements on the perovskite solar cell technology requires strong progress not only in the composition together with colloidal chemistry of the perovskite materials, but also in the development of novel passivation materials and processes assisted by machine learning and theoretical calculations in tandem with extensive stability studies in both cells and modules according to well-established protocols.
