    , Accepted 12th October 2010First published on 23rd November 2010AbstractThe Ru(II) complexes [Ru(bpp)(dcbpy)Cl]+ (1), [Ru(tcbpp)(bpy)Cl]+ (2), and [Ru(tc′bpp)(bpy)Cl]+ (3) (bpp = 2,6-bis(N-pyrazolyl)pyridine, dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxyl-bipyridine, bpy = bipyridine, tcbpp = 4-carboxyl-2,6-bis(2-carboxyl-N-pyrazolyl)pyridine, tc′bpp = 4-carboxyl-2,6-bis(4-carboxyl-N-pyrazolyl)pyridine) are studied theoretically using density functional theory (DFT) techniques to explore their properties as dye in a solar cell. The calculated geometry structure and absorption spectrum of 1 are consistent with its experimental results. The calculation results indicate which sites the COOH groups attach to can significantly influence the electronic structure of the complex. By migrating the COOH groups from the bpy ligand in 1 to bpp ligand in 2 and 3, the nature of LUMO changes from bpy-localized to bpp dominated. The calculated low-lying absorptions at λ > 370 nm of the three complexes are categorized as metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions and the transition terminates at the orbital populated by the COOH appended ligand. The atomic spin density analysis also indicates that the ligand which is modified by the COOH groups is the ideal spot for the captured electron to situate. It can be predicted that the performance of 2 and 3 in the dye-sensitized solar cell can be enhanced as compared with 1.
1. Introduction
In recent years, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interests for conversion of sunlight into electricity because of their low cost and high efficiency.1–5 The DSSCs comprise four major parts: a nano-crystalline metal oxide semiconductor film, a dye sensitizer, and a redox electrolyte as well as a counter electrode. Among these four aspects, the dye sensitizer represents a critical component for achieving high power conversion efficiency. The ideal dye should absorb as much visible light as possible, have redox potentials matching the semiconductor and electrolyte for electron injection and regeneration, respectively, and sustain numerous redox turnovers under light irradiation.5
In the search for a promising sensitizer, a considerable number of complexes have been synthesized and analyzed.6–12 Among these dyes, cis-dithiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) and trithiocyanato(4,4′,4′′-tricarboxyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine)-ruthenium(II), named as red dye13 and black dye,14 respectively, are the most well-known. The red dye has been regarded as an efficient photo-sensitizer because of its relatively long-lived excited state and high thermal stability. Moreover, the presence of a terminal acidic carboxyl group makes the red dye stably anchor to the semiconductor surface.15 However, the narrow absorption region (313–534 nm) in the visible spectrum makes the red dye limited in application in DSSC. So numerous attempts have been made to enhance the dye’s response in the red region, but in vain, until Nazeeruddin et al.16 reported the black dye in 1997. The black dye is constituted by changing the bipyridyl to terpyridyl ligand based on the red dye and then the visible absorptions are extended to 920 nm. To further enhance the dye's properties, another tridenate analogue to the terpyridine ligand, 2,6-bis(3,5-dimethyl-N-pyrazolyl)pyridine (bdmpp)17 has been introduced to the Ru(II) metal center,18 giving out [Ru(dcbpyH2)(bdmpp)Cl]+19,20 (where, dcbpyH2 = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) with an overall energy conversion efficiency of 1.7% in DSSC application.19 Recently, Philippopoulos et al.3 synthesized and tested a series of Ru(II) molecular sensitizers using both the tridentate 2,6-bis(N-pyrazolyl)pyridine (bpp) and bidentate 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (dcbpyH2) ligands. Among these new developed sensitizers, the [Ru(bpp)(dcbpyH2)Cl]+, (denoted as 1 thereafter), has been proved to be a potential sensitizer, though lower in efficiency as compared with the famous red and black dye. Philippopoulos et al.3 have concluded that the photovoltaic performance of nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells sensitized by these new heteroleptic Ru(II) compounds depends remarkably on the number of the COOH functional groups. But they only studied the configuration with two COOH groups. It is unknown whether the dyes with more COOH groups could result in better photovoltaic performance or not. On the other hand, the dyes usually contact with the conductor via the COOH group, which acts as the anchoring point. Therefore, the charge in the excited state must localize near the COOH group(s) to facilitate the electronic coupling necessary for charge injection.2 In this regard, the suitable site of the anchoring group on the ring system should be also taken into account for dye design.10 Thus, not only the number, but also the position of the COOH groups on the ring ligand should be considered in designing new dyes. From the experimental point of view, the syntheses of new sensitizers are quite demanding. Whereas, it is a bit non-economical and time-consuming to synthesise all the possible configurations incorporating COOH groups with different positions and numbers. Therefore, one would like to predict beforehand the potential properties of possible candidates in order to screen out configurations without the desired qualities and find those systems worthy of testing experimentally. Indeed, computational studies can help us in realizing the assumption and providing some hints about some important aspects of the studies dyes.
Thus in this paper, we take [Ru(bpy)(bpp)Cl]+ as parent model, and theoretical calculations were employed to reform the system by adjusting the number of COOH groups and their attaching points on the ring ligand in order to enhance the performance of the dyes. Indeed, we performed theoretical calculations on all possible configurations, see Fig. ESI-1 reported in Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI)†. Then by comparing their absorption spectra and redox potentials, two new systems labelled as 2 and 3 with three COOH groups (see Fig. 1) were selected, which should have better performance due to more absorption peaks and better driving force compared with that of that of 1. Therefore, we report the investigation on these two new systems as well as the parent model 1 in detail in the following parts. In order to explore the performance and further understand the mechanism as dyes, the electronic structures, absorption spectrum, and atomic spin density as well as the redox potentials of the systems were calculated. In our simulation, the DSSC cell is structured as the typical cell described elsewhere,2 in which the semiconductor is TiO2 with valance band (vb) and conductive band (cb) of 2.5 and −0.7 V (vs SCE), respectively.

2. Computational details
It should be noted that the investigated three dye molecules have the COOH groups with different number and attaching sites. As illustrated in Fig. 1 there are two COOH groups appended to sites 4,4′ in bpy ligand in 1, while there are three COOH groups anchored to 4, 2′, 2′′ and 4, 4′, 4′′ in bpp ligand in 2 and 3, respectively.
2.1 Density functional theory calculations
All calculations have been performed with the Gaussian0321 suite of program, with a tight self-consistent filed convergence threshold (10−8 au). To carry out the computations, we have followed a well-established three-step approach: (1) the ground-state geometries have been optimised until the residual mean force is smaller than 1.0 × 10−5 au; (2) the vibrational frequencies are analytically determined to confirm that structures are actual minima in the whole potential energy surface; and (3) the vertical transition energies to the valence excited states are computed based on the optimised ground state geometry with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).22–24
The calculations were carried out at B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory,25,26 which is backed by previous investigations that the calculation at this level of theory can provide the converged geometrical parameters for numerous transition metal complexes.27–32
From TD-DFT calculation, two quantities which are related to the UV-Vis spectra were obtained: the energy of the vertical electronic excitations (En→m) and the corresponding oscillator strength (f). On the basis of En→m and f, the absorption spectra were afterwards simulated by using Gaussian functions, to have a intuitive comparison with the experimental data. Upon simulation a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), that is, the broadening of each peak (individual transition), of 0.10 eV was applied. More precisely, only spin-allowed transitions with oscillator strength larger than 0.011 were reported and discussed in this paper. The polarized continuum model (PCM)33–36 was adopted to simulate the solvent field of DMSO in TD-DFT calculation. Additionally the atomic spin density is obtained based on the default Mulliken charge analysis built-in in Gaussian03.
2.2 Solvation free energies and calculation of redox potential
The redox potentials of the systems in the ground state, E0, versus standard calomel electrode (SCE) were determined according to eqn (1). (1)where,
• ΔGaq, the Gibbs free energy change due to the oxidation of the investigated complex in aqueous solutions.
• ΔGSCE, the Gibbs free energy change of standard calomel electrode, ΔGSCE = − 4.1888 eV.37
• F, the Faraday constant, F = 23.06 kcal mol−1 V−1.
• n, the number of electrons involved in the redox couple [RuLL′X]2+/[RuLL′X]+. Here n = 1.
The values of ΔGaq were calculated according to the Born–Haber cycle, depicted in Fig. 2, as follows: ΔGaq = ΔGg + ΔG(2) − ΔG(1)(2)Here, ΔGg = ΔHg − TΔSg is the free energy change of the system due to the oxidation of the complex in gas phase, with ΔHg = ΔH(DFT) + ΔHZPE. The ΔH(DFT) is obtained at DFT level of theory for the complex in gas phase, whereas the changes of zero point energy ΔHZPE and the corrections of molecular entropy changes ΔSg were based on frequency calculations. The solvation free energies for the complexes in all oxidation states were evaluated by the PCM method in self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) approach.38,39 The thermal corrections for solute have been added to give the true free energy difference ΔG(1) and ΔG(2). Moreover, all of the related free energies were calculated under standard conditions, i.e., at 298.15 K and 1 atm. All redox potentials involved in this study are reported versus the SCE.

2.3 The DSSC efficiency
The efficiency of the DSSC, that is, the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), is a function of the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the efficient charge injection from the electronic excited state of dye into the conduction band of TiO2 (Φinj), and the charge collection efficiency (ηc). The IPCE can be expressed as: IPCE = LHE × Φinj × ηc(3)Here, Φinj depends on the thermodynamic driving force (D) of the vertical excitation: Φinj ∝ f(D)(4) D = |E0 − ΔE − Ecb|(5)where,
• Ecb, the conductive band of TiO2 (vs.SCE).
• ΔE, the vertical excitation energy, obtained from TD-DFT calculation.

All the three complexes show a distorted octahedral geometry around the ruthenium(II) metal center. The distortion can be seen from the constrained bite angle of N1–Ru–N2 ca. 157–158° and of N6–Ru–N7 ca. 78° in the tridentate and bidentate ligands, respectively. The similar distortion has been observed in [Ru(bdmpp)(bpy)Cl]Cl·1.25CHCl3 [the N–Ru–N bond angle is 79.8°(5)]40 and cis-[Ru(dcbpyH2)2(NCS)2]·5.0DMSO [the N–Ru–N bond angle is 79.8°(5)].41 As a result of the constrained bite angle of the bpp ligands, the bond distances of the Ru–N to the pyridine [Ru–N6, 2.082 Å, Ru–N7, 2.067 Å in 1; Ru–N6, 2.086 Å, Ru–N7, 2.081 Å in 3] are shorter than those attaching to the pyrazolyl substituent. Whereas, the opposite trend was found in 2, as shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the bpp and bpy ligand in all three systems are almost perpendicular to each other. The Ru–Cl bond lengths in the three complexes (Ru–Cl, 2.475 Å, 2.473 Å, and 2.477 Å for 1, 2, and 3, respectively) agree with the experimental data 2.403 Å of 13 and coincide with the expected range for the other related Ru(II) complexes, such as [Ru(bdmpp)(Me2bpy)Cl](PF6)·1.25CHCl3 [Ru–Cl, 2.445(2) Å].40 The dihedral angles between the COOH group and the bpy ligand deviate about 8° from the experimental value. The discrepancy of the dihedral angle data between the calculated and measured values is reasonable and acceptable since the chemical environments of the complex are different in the two cases: in experiment the molecule is in a tight crystal lattice with the bpy and bpp ligands are close in space, whereas in the calculation the molecule is free. In conclusion, the calculated geometry parameters of the three complexes are reasonable.
3.2 Frontier molecular orbital properties
It will be useful to examine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of these Ru complexes to provide the framework on the excited state.
The energy and compositions of the selected FMOs are given in Table ESI-1 reported in ESI†. From Table ESI-1, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the three complexes can be labelled as 4d(Ru) in character, but substantially mixed with the ligands with π character. When the COOH groups are anchored from the bpy ligand to bpp ligand, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels change in the order of 1 > 3 > 2, while the band gap changes with the reverse sequence. All the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the three complexes are mainly composed by the ligand with compositions larger than 90%. It can be noted, the LUMOs of 2 and 3 are similar not only in composition but also in energy level since both are dominated by bpp ligand. The LUMO of 1, however, is charged by the bpy ligand. This difference can be ascribed to the different numbers and positions of the COOH group to append on the ring system. When the two COOH groups are attached to bpy ligand in 1, the LUMO is mainly localized on bpy ligand; when the three COOH groups are appended on bpp ligand in 2 and 3, the LUMO is mastered by the bpp ligand, as illustrated in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Electron density diagrams for HOMO and LUMO positions of 1, 2, and 3 at B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory. 
From the above analysis, the frontier molecular orbitals are influenced by the COOH groups. Particularly, the LUMOs are all localized on the ligand attached by the COOH groups, see Fig. 4. This is an important feature for the complex to act as the dyes in DSSC. Since the complex can interact with the semi-conductor via the COOH group, the transferred electron can reach the conduction band of the semi-conductor via the virtual orbitals attached by COOH groups. This is vital for a larger ηc.
The compositions of other related frontier molecular orbitals are also listed in Table ESI-1 and the detailed analysis are given in ESI†.
3.3 Atomic spin density
The atomic spin density gives some hints about the possible pathways of the possible charge transition. For a qualified dye, the charge should transfer to the anchoring points to facilitate the charge injection. All the three Ru complexes here show a net atomic spin density of zero since all electrons in these system are paired. However, this kind of balance can be broken by introducing an extra electron to the Ru systems and the corresponding process can be denoted as 1(←e), 2(←e), and 3(←e), respectively. The calculated atomic spin densities (see Table 2) show that the bpy ligand in 1 and the bpp ligand in 2 and 3 exhibit the atomic spin density larger than 0.9 after obtaining an electron. Therefore, the introduced single electron should localize on the bpy ligand in 1 and bpp ligand in 2 and 3, which are all appended by the COOH groups. Thus we can predict that the charge should be transferred via the bpy ligand in 1 and bpp ligand in 2 and 3 in the cell. Indeed, this way is effective since the anchoring groups to the semiconductor append on these ligands. This is another vital factor to high ηc.

Moreover, the atomic spin density data also suggest that the target orbital should be that one populated by bpy in 1 and bpp in 2 and 3, respectively, upon charge transfer. This indicates that the lower energy unoccupied orbitals are those composed by the bpy and bpp ligand in 1 and 2 or 3, respectively. In the meantime, the bpy ligand in 1 and bpp ligands in 2 and 3 are attached by the COOH groups. These deductions coincide with the analysis of the frontier molecular orbitals and agree with the HOMO and LUMO position as illustrated in Fig. 4.
3.4 Absorption behavior in DMSO media
The calculated absorptions between 290–800 nm for 1, 2 and 3 in DMSO by TD-B3LYP method are listed in Table 3. For each complex only the dominant excitations in the absorption process are summarized. The experimental absorption data3 for 1 are presented for comparison with the calculated results. The simulated Gaussian type absorption spectra, together with the experimental spectrum of 1, are shown in Fig. 5.

First of all, the simulated and the experimental spectra of 1 resemble in profile but the simulated one shows better resolution. Three strong absorption bands were calculated with the absorption peaks at 311, 402, and 451 nm in 1, which are comparable to the measured values at 313, 388, and 438 nm,3 respectively. Another measured absorption band around 483 nm was reproduced in our calculation but degenerated into a shoulder band with weak oscillator strength.
For 1, the strongest absorption at 311 nm is contributed by excitation MO 123 → 130. As shown in Table ESI-1†, the MO 123 and the virtual orbital MO 130 are all localized on bpy ligand, therefore this excitation can be assigned as intra-ligand charge transfer (denoted as ILbpyCT). For the other two strong absorption at 451 and 402 nm, the excitations responsible for them originate from the different occupied orbital but terminate in the same virtual orbital 131. For the absorption at 451 nm, the excitation of MO 129 → 131 is in charge of it and can be assigned as metal-to-ligand (bpy) charge transfer (MLbpyCT) transition in which the sub-ligand COOH has some contributions. On the other hand, the excitation of MO 127 → 131 leads to the absorption at 402 nm and can also be assigned as MLbpyCT transition. The calculated weak absorption at 357 nm can not be differentiated in the measured spectrum, this maybe due to its weak oscillator strength (0.0119, the weakest among the calculated absorptions). According to the analysis about the FMOs, this weak absorption can be assigned as MLbpyCT character perturbed by MLbppCT component. The calculated lowest energy absorption at 646 nm is contributed by HOMO → LUMO excitation (MO 129 → 130). This excitation can be ascribed to the MLbpyCT transition character and the COOH groups taking part in the transition process. This calculated lowest energy absorption band should be related to the measured weak absorption between 600–700 nm.
The simulated absorption spectra of 2 and 3 are similar to that of 1 but with some difference in the oscillator strength. The calculated absorptions at λ > 370 nm of both 2 and 3 have the identical metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition character. But different from 1, the transitions terminate in the orbital localized on the bpp ligand, which is subligated by the COOH groups. Therefore, not only in 1 but also in 2 and 3, the absorption at λ > 370 nm all display MLCT character, and the transitions end in the orbital mastered by the ligand which is appended by the COOH groups. This point is consistent with the conclusion from the atomic spin density calculation that the low level orbitals to obtain electron are situated on the COOH attached ligand. The higher energy absorption bands at 337 nm for 2 and 331 nm for 3 both originate from the intra-ligand charger transfer transition (ILCT) within the bpp ligand. For 2, there is an extra shoulder absorption around 302 nm as compared with 1 and 3, which comes from the XLCT transition between Cl atom and bpp ligand.
Both 2 and 3 show an additional absorption band at 541 and 548 nm, respectively, in contrast to 1. Therefore, upon the COOH groups migrate from the bpy to the bpp ligand, the complex displays more absorption bands in the UV-visible region, namely the light harvesting capability of the complex can be improved. This improvement is helpful to enhance the IPCE of the dye.
To summarize, the calculated UV-visible absorptions of the three dyes all have relevance to the orbitals dominated by the ligands which is attached by the COOH groups. Therefore, these absorptions are helpful for charge transfer in DSSC.
3.5 The theoretical understanding on the complexes in DSSC
Now we assess the performance of the complexes to serve as sensitizers in solar cells from a theoretical point of view. We can explore which excited states are likely to inject electrons into the semiconductor and discuss the feasibility to apply the newly designed 2 and 3 in DSSC. In principle, to make the electronic transfer energetically favourable, on the one hand, the redox potential of the dye in the excited state, E*, should be higher than the conduction band of the semiconductor; on the other hand, the energetics of the excited states should be high enough to provide a thermodynamic driving force for charge injection (namely, larger D, see eqn (4)).
The calculated redox potential (see Table 4) of 1 in ground state is 3.1 V bellow the conduction band of TiO2. Thus, the molecule should absorb energy not less than 3.1 eV to excite an electron to the higher energy level orbital, through which to transfer the electron to the conduction band of TiO2. Among all the calculated absorptions of 1 only the transition band at 311 nm is both intense (f = 0.3614) and energetic enough (D = 0.88, see Table 3) to drive the electron into the conduction band, assuming injection takes place at or near the Frank-Condon region. Other calculated excitations of 1 cannot provide adequate energy (3.1 eV) to make a valid injection. Thus the sensitization of 1 to solar cell is limited. Here, we make the approximation that the energetics of the sensitizer are not too different whether it is in DMSO solution or bound to TiO2 film, which is backed by a previous study performed by Kuciauskas et al.42

As shown in Table 4, both 2 and 3 have the similar redox potential in ground state, 1.461 V and 1.463 V (vs SCE), respectively, which are about 2.2 V bellow the conduction band of TiO2. We thus take 2.2 eV as roughly the least energy a molecule must harvest (either thermalized or nonthermalized) to inject an electron into the semiconductor. Then we are delighted to announce that all the calculated singlet to singlet excitations, except the lowest energy ones, in 2 and 3 are sufficiently energetic. All of the virtual orbitals involved in the desired excitations are predominately anti-bonding π-orbital composed of bpp ligand attached by COOH group, which should facilitate the injection since the sensitizer is anchored to TiO2via the COOH ligand.2
Not all desired singlet excited states of the dyes, however, contribute equally to the cell due to the different absorption cross-section of the chromophore. In 2 only the singlet-singlet excitations at λ < 500 nm have the stronger oscillator strength (greater than 0.1) and large driving force to inject electron (D, from the lowest 0.44 V to the strongest 1.95 V, see Table 3). In 3, the efficient absorption bands are located at λ < 400 nm. These absorptions can make the corresponding excited states to be the possible candidate which can inject electron to the conduction band of TiO2.
Therefore, after the COOH group migrated from the bpy ligand in 1 to bpp ligand in 2 and 3, the restructured complexes are more suitable for serving as dyes in solar cell and the efficiency of the cell sensitized by 2 and 3 should be improved as compared to that by 1.
4. Conclusion
Theoretical calculations have been performed on the three Ru(II) complexes to reveal the electronic structures, optical properties, focusing on the theoretical prediction of their performance as sensitizers in DSSC. The calculation results indicate that the COOH functional group is a crucial factor which affects the atomic spin density distribution, electron transition nature, and the electron transport activity in DSSC. Once the ligand is appended by the COOH group, the electron transition can take place involving this ligand not only in the MLCT but also in the ILCT transition. Furthermore, the COOH group can make the attached ligand able to obtain an electron and display the required atomic spin density. Thus, the complex can serve as the medium through the COOH attached ligand during electron transfer. On the other hand, the newly designed complexes 2 and 3 with the bpp ligand attached by COOH group have more effective excited state than the parent molecule 1 and may play a better role in DSSC. These results should be helpful for designing new sensitizers in DSSC.
