    , Accepted 30th April 2013First published on 30th April 2013AbstractType-II core/shell CdTe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) are assembled onto TiO2 nanotube array (NTA) films using a bi-functional linker molecule with the help of a hydrothermal method coupled with successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process. Spatial separation of the electron and hole wave functions within the core/shell heterostructured nanocrystals appears to result in an extended charge separation state, resulting in a significant increase in photocurrent and excellent device stability. When only CdS or CdTe QDs are used as the sensitizer, the largest photocurrent densities are 1.31 mA cm−2 and 1.23 mA cm−2, respectively. For the core/shell CdTe/CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes the photocurrent density increases to ≈9.17 mA cm−2, dramatically larger than the values obtained with only one sensitizer. The core/shell CdTe/CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes provide a remarkable photoelectrochemical cell efficiency of 6.12%. To the best of our knowledge this photoconversion efficiency is the highest in the field of QD-sensitized photoelectrodes. A corresponding hydrogen evolution rate as high as 1560 μmol h−1 W−1 was achieved.
Introduction
The inter-related problems facing modern society of increasing world population, increasing per capita energy demand, and climate change related to fossil-fuel combustion motivate the development and implementation of environmentally clean, renewable energy resources.1 Our interest is in the efficient, low cost conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuel. Single crystal silicon photovoltaic devices deliver power from sunlight with an efficiency of approximately 15%, however these 1st generation devices suffer from relatively high manufacturing costs. So-called 2nd generation solar cells, for example amorphous silicon, copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(InGa)Se2), and CdTe are based on thin film technologies with, in comparison to crystalline silicon, reduced manufacturing costs, but lower photoconversion efficiencies. Our focus is on 3rd generation devices that offer the potential of low cost and high photoconversion efficiencies. Examples of 3rd generation solar cells include the Grätzel solar cell, based on dye-sensitized nanoporous semiconductor thin films,2 conjugated polymers,3 and quantum dot (QD) solar cells based on composite films of semiconductor nanoparticles.4 Inorganic semiconductor QD-based photovoltaic devices offer a number of potential advantages including: (1) high extinction coefficients, (2) excellent stability, (3) the possibility for making multilayer or hybrid sensitizers, and (4) multiple exciton generation.5 Further, the QD band gap can be readily modified through the control of particle size, allowing one to tune the radiation response of the same material composition from the visible through the infrared.
Titanium dioxide has been extensively investigated for many applications including water photoelectrolysis, photocatalysis, heterojunction solar cells, environmental purification, gas sensing, solar cells/batteries, field emission, and self-cleaning surfaces. For example, Wu6 and co-workers, constructed a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell by using TiO2/FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) as the photoanode to produce hydrogen with the PEC splitting of an aqueous solution of formic acid, and an energy efficiency up to 1.79% was achieved. In particular TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs), vertically oriented from the substrate, represent a unique one-dimensional nanostructure that orthogonalizes light absorption and charge separation.7,8 The photocatalytic9 and photoelectronic10 performance of TiO2 NTAs are known to exceed those of TiO2 nanoparticles.11 However, as is well-known anatase TiO2 has a band gap of 3.2 eV hence only wavelengths below ∼390 nm of the solar spectrum can be directly utilized. To improve the solar spectrum efficiency various methods have been developed to sensitize TiO2 with narrow bandgap semiconductor QD such as CdS,12 PbS,13 Bi2S3,14 CdSe,15 InP,16 PbSe,17 and InAs.18 Among the different QD compositions we are particularly interested in CdTe,19,20 a p-type semiconductor possessing a large absorption coefficient with a direct band gap of Eg = 1.56 eV. Further, the conduction band energy of CdTe (ECB = −1.0 V vs. NHE) is favorable for electron injection into TiO2.
The redox behavior of the sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) couple is known to be integral to stabilize the photoelectrochemical activity of metal chalcogenide electrodes.20 During the initial photoelectrochemical investigations of single crystal metal chalcogenide electrodes it was noted that the S2−/Sn2− redox couple can stabilize n-type CdS and CdSe, but not CdTe.21,22 For an illuminated CdTe system, sulfide ions dissolved in aqueous solutions are not capable of scavenging photogenerated holes resulting in dissolution of the CdTe and formation of CdS layers on the CdTe nanocrystal surface. Other redox couples have been investigated as possible replacements of the S2−/Sn2−couple, including: I3−/I−, ferrocene/ferrocene+, K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6 with/without KCN, Te2−/Te22−, and Co complexes ([CoII(Open)3](TFSI)2/[CoIII(Open)3](TFSI)3 where Open = 1,10-phenanthroline and TFSI = bis-trifluoromethane sulfoimide). None of these redox couples provide photostability for the CdTe QD-sensitized electrodes; in fact, most of them immediately corrode the CdTe QD, even under dark conditions. Hence, while CdTe is an excellent photovoltaic material, the choice of CdTe for the operation of photoelectrochemical cells currently poses a serious challenge.23
Compared with single composition QD, in core/shell QD nanoheterostructures, the relative positions of the conduction band and valence bands of the two components can be chosen to tailor the electron and hole distributions to control the single and multiple exciton lifetimes within the QD. For example, Lin24 and co-workers designed and fabricated a one-dimensional CdSe/CdS/TiO2 nanotube array co-sensitized quantum dots photoelectrode for solar cells application. achieving a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 2.74%. Meanwhile, the rate and efficiency of interfacial charge transfer to external acceptors can be further optimized.25–28 For n-type semiconductors, the electron transportation is more favorable than hole transfer. The p-type semiconductor is favorable for hole transportation, while the insufficient hole transfer may cause a serious carrier loss.29 Hence, a co-sensitization photoelectrode system with p-type and n-type semiconductor nanocrystals may be a good choice for facilitating the transportation of both electrons and holes. Specifically, CdTe exhibits p-type conductivity,20,30 and usually works with n-type CdS in thin film solar cells. The built-in electrical field in a p–n junction can promote charge separation, electron transfer and hole recovery.31 For example, Du and co-workers30 fabricated coaxial ZnO nanorods arrays by depositing n-type CdS and p-type CdTe nanocrystals sequentially on conductive glass substrates. An enhanced overall conversion efficiency of 1.05% was observed in the ZnO/CdS/CdTe electrode. Previous reports have shown that in ideal type II core/shell QD, such as CdSe/CdS QD,26,32,33 CdTe/CdSe,34 the spatially separated electron and hole wave functions reduced their coulomb interaction, increasing the lifetimes of single and multiple exciton states. On the other hand, shell-localized electrons and core localized holes could achieve ultrafast electron transfer (ET) to adsorbed acceptors while simultaneously retarding the charge recombination process.35 The combined properties of long single and multiple exciton states lifetimes, efficient charge separation, more chemical and thermal stability than the corresponding plain core nanocrystals36 and slow recombination in type II heterostructures suggest that these may be ideal materials for delivering electrons to catalysts or redox mediators in photoelectrochemical cells. There are several core/shell nanoheterostructures that have been prepared, such as, CdSe/CdS,37 CdS/ZnSe,38 ZnSe/ZnS,39 InAs/CdSe/ZnSe,40 CdTe/CdSe.41 However, in order to overcoat the cores with shells, almost all the methods include two hydrothermal reactions. This is very time-consuming and complicated. Meanwhile, little work has been done on the TiO2 nanotube-arrays and core/shell semiconductor QD-based composite structures.
In this work, we sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes first with core/shell CdTe/CdS QD by a hydrothermal method coupled with a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process (SILAR). In a common type II core/shell CdTe/CdS QD, the photo-excited electron is confined deeply within the CdS shell, and the hole is localized in the core. The spatial separation of the electron and hole within such type-II semiconductor heterostructures can result in a long-lived charge transfer (CT) state, which enhances the transfer of the electron from the QD to the TiO2 NTAs, resulting in a significantly improved photoelectrochemical cell efficiency (Scheme 1), as described by Burda.41 Further, the CdS shell, with its larger 2.24 eV bandgap42 and much lower oxidation potential than CdTe, results in low photooxidative degradation, surface defects,43 and the exchange of Te with S. Using a sulfide electrolyte we characterize the photoelectrochemical cells of such photoelectrodes as a function of QD size, achieving a saturated photocurrent density of 9.17 mA cm−2 and a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 6.12% under AM 1.5G illumination. The first batch of photoelectrochemical cells in our laboratory for water splitting using these photoelctrodes were fabricated, demonstrating a hydrogen generation rate of 1560 μmol h−1 W−1.

Experimental section
Fabrication of the TiO2 nanotube arrays
The TiO2 nanotube array samples were made by the anodization of titanium foil (>99.6%, 0.1 mm thick, Zhengxiang Metals). Prior to anodization, a titanium ribbon (0.4 × 3 cm2) was ultrasonically cleaned in HF solution for 5 min and ultrapure water for 5 min. The cleaned titanium ribbon was anodized at 20 V in an electrolyte containing 0.5 M NaF and 0.5 M NaHSO4 at room temperature for 1 h in a conventional two-electrode system with a platinum cathode. The working area of the anodized ribbon was 0.4 × 2.5 cm2. The TiO2 NTA samples were annealed for 3 h at 500 °C for crystallization.
Preparation of the CdTe QD
Water-soluble mercaptoacetic acid-capped CdTe QD were synthesized according to our previously reported method.44 Briefly, 40 mg mercaptoacetic acid was transferred to 100 ml ultrapure water containing 91.5 mg cadmium acetate under a nitrogen atmosphere. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 with 0.5 M NaOH. Under constant stirring, 175.5 mg trisodium citrate and 17.9 mg Na2TeO3 were added. Then, 10.5 mg NaBH4 was injected and bubbled with N2 for 10 min. Finally, 20 ml of this solution was placed in a high-pressure reaction kettle, and kept boiling at 120 °C for a specific duration (5, 15, 30, or 60 min). The QD were precipitated by acetone and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min then redissolved in ultrapure water. When stored at 4 °C they were stable for more than six months.
Fabrication of the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes
The TiO2 NTA films were first immersed in the CdTe QD solution at 25 °C for one day to ensure saturated adsorption, Then, the as-prepared CdTe QD-TiO2 NTAs were removed from the solution, rinsed with copious amounts of deionized water, and dried with N2. Second, the as-prepared photoelectrodes were immersed in 1 M mercaptoacetic acid solution for 6 hours. After that, the photoelectrodes were rinsed with copious amounts of deionized water and dried with N2 again. The photoelectrodes were then modified with CdS using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process.45 Briefly, 0.5 M cadmium nitrate in ethanol was used as the cation source and 0.5 M sodium sulfide in 1:1 methanol and water as the anion source. The CdTe QD-TiO2 NTA samples were dipped in a 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 solution for 5 min, rinsed with ethanol, then dipped for 5 min in a 0.5 M Na2S solution and then rinsed with methanol. The amount of CdS on the sample was increased by repeating such an operation process for several cycles. Meanwhile, the core/shell nanoheterostructures system transitions to a type-II system with a thicker shell (Scheme 2).41

Structural characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEM 2100 (JEOL, Japan) electron microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers (EDS) fitted to electron microscopes were used for elemental analysis.
The UV/vis absorption spectrum was recorded on a DU 800 Spectrophotometer (BECKMAN, USA). A Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermoelectron, USA) was used to collect the FT-IR spectra. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan).
PEC measurements and gas collection
Photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out in an aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.24 M Na2S (pH = 11.5) using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI660B, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd.) in a standard three-electrode system comprised of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter electrode (0.3 × 2.5 cm), and the sample electrode. The electrolyte was stirred and purged with N2 gas before the measurements. The photocurrent density (J)–time behavior was measured with no applied potential. The incident light from a 300 W Xe lamp was filtered to match the AM 1.5G spectrum with an intensity of 106 mW cm−2 as measured by a radiometer (OPHIR, Littleton, CO). Gas generated in water splitting was collected in a home-made device (Fig. S4†). This collected gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (SHIMADZU, GC-2010).
Results and discussion
Fig. S1† and 1 show the emission spectra (450 nm excitation) and absorption spectra of four different CdTe QD samples identified by their emission (absorbance) peaks at 541 nm (503 nm), 577 nm (523 nm), 599 nm (536 nm), and 627 nm (552 nm), respectively. By comparing the absorbance peaks to the absorption curve reported by Peng and co-workers,46 we identified the average particle diameters of these samples as being 2.4 nm, 2.9 nm, 3.1 nm, and 3.3 nm, respectively. As indicated by Fig. 1 and S1,† the emission onset and absorbance spectrum shift towards lower wavelengths with decreasing particle size. The large half-peak width of the emission spectrum indicates the wide range of the particle size. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was used to examine whether the CdTe QD were capped with mercaptoacetic acid.44 It can be observed from Fig. 1B that there is a strong stretching vibration of the carboxyl group at 1575 cm−1, implying that the carboxyl group turned into its anion and led to an intense symmetric vibration of the carboxyl anion at 1399 cm−1. Peaks in the region of 2969–2850 cm−1 can be attributed to the ν(C–H) vibrational modes of the –CH2-of the mercaptoacetic acid. Disappearance of the peaks at 2550 and 945 cm−1 corresponding to the S–H stretching and bending modes occur due to the cleavage of the S–H bond and the formation of a new S–Cd bond between mercaptoacetic acid and CdTe QD. All of this indicates that the mercaptoacetic acid binds to the surface of QD using the –SH group.

Fig. 2a is a TEM image of CdTe QD having an emission peak at 541 nm. The bright field TEM image of this specimen clearly indicates a spherical morphology. Meanwhile, by examining more than 100 QDs, we determined the size distribution and confirmed an average 2.4 nm diameter (inset of Fig. 2a). The main size distribution was 2.05 to 2.65 nm, the frequency of which was about 73%. This is consistent with the large half-peak width. CdTe QD with different diameters (different band gaps) can produce core/shell nanoheterostructures with different sizes, which can absorb different portions of the light. It should be possible to increase the effective capture of incident light in this way, the wide range of particle sizes may be good for the photoelectrochemical cells. However, the main diameter of 2.4 nm plays a crucial role for a high photoelectric response. To characterize the topology of the CdTe QD or core/shell CdS/CdTe QD (2.4 nm CdTe QD) upon the TiO2 NTA surface, a thin layer was dissolved in ethanol under ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min, then a few μL of the sample was dropped onto a copper grid for imaging. Fig. 2b shows the HRTEM image of the CdTe QD-TiO2 NTA. The figure clearly shows that there was still a big space (about 10 nm) between the CdTe QD even after 24 hours immersion of TiO2 NTA in CdTe QD solution. These gaps may produce insulating barriers between QD that militate against efficient carrier transport.47 Further modification with CdS QDs produces core/shell CdTe/CdS QD, CdS fills the gaps as shown in Fig. 2C1. Fig. 2C1 shows that the nanotubes are approximately 60 nm in diameter and 300 nm in length. Core/shell CdTe/CdS QD approximately 15 nm in diameter were uniformly dispersed on the inner and outer walls of the TiO2 NTAs. There is almost no space between the QDs, which is good for carrier transport without space barriers. Fig. 2 (C2–C4) (TEM and HRTEM image) clearly indicates the core/shell QD with a different core size and morphology. For those CdTe QDs anchored on the wall of the TiO2 NTAs, CdTe is not at the center of the core/shell QD, while for others, the core/shell structure is perfect with CdTe at the center, which agrees with Fig. 2b. The EDS spectrum, Fig. 2d, obtained at the point marked by the red arrow in the inset, exhibits the characteristic peaks of Cd, Te, S, Ti, O, and Cu due to the copper grid; the Te peak is very weak, with an elemental analysis corresponding to 0.20 atomic % of the film.

The inset of (a) is the histogram of the measured particle sizes. (d) EDS analysis of the site marked by a red arrow in the inset indicating the presence of Cd, S, and Te. The copper peaks are due to the supporting grid. 
We used bifunctional linker molecules (HOOC-R-SH) with carboxylate and thiol functional groups to facilitate the binding of CdTe QD to TiO2.48 Such an approach has successfully been used to link CdSe49 and Au nanoparticles50 to TiO2.51 In this work, the CdTe QD were capped with mercaptoacetic acid. The mercapto group was conjugated with the Cd2+ ion on the CdTe QD surface, and with the help of a carboxylate group the QD were directly absorbed by the TiO2 NTAs. In the following SILAR process, CdS QD were absorbed on the CdTe QD surface, as well as the TiO2 NTA surface, with the help of mercaptoacetic acid, the mercapto group and carboxylate group were conjugated with the Cd2+ ion on the CdS QD surface and the TiO2 NTA, respectively. In this way, CdS can adsorb on the CdTe QD to form the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD and fill the left space well. Filling the gaps facilitates the carrier transport because these gaps work as insulating barriers.

Fig. 3 shows the measured photocurrent as a function of CdTe particle size. The maximum photocurrent is seen with the 2.4 nm diameter CdTe QD. Decreasing the particle size shifts the conduction band to increasingly negative potentials, which in turn increases the driving force for charge injection. Since the effective electron mass (me = 0.13 mo) is much smaller than the hole mass (mh = 1.14 mo), most of the band gap increase is seen as a shift in the conduction band to more negative potentials versus NHE.52 Furthermore, in the presence of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple the conduction band energies shift negatively as the metal chalcogenide surface becomes negatively charged. For example, the conduction band energies of CdTe and CdS in the neutral electrolyte are, respectively, −1.0 and −0.8 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).53 When in contact with sulfide, however, these conduction bands shift to −1.25 and −1.0 V (vs. NHE), respectively.21

(B) The corresponding photocurrent response of the TiO2 nanotube array-CdTe electrodes after five cycles of the SILAR process of CdS. 
The CdTe QD were coated with CdS to minimize photocorrosion. Fig. S2† shows the photoelectrode performance as a function of the number of CdS SILAR cycles. The core/shell CdTe/CdS QD become larger in size with each SILAR cycle. For all CdTe QD sizes, 2.4 nm to 3.3 nm, the measured photocurrent increases with the number of SILAR cycles, reaching a maximum with five cycles. The maximum photocurrent response came from the 2.4 nm CdTe nanoparticles after five CdS SILAR cycles, 9.17 mA cm−2. Five CdS deposition cycles upon the 2.4 nm diameter CdTe QD were used for all photoelectrodes subsequently discussed in this work.

Fig. 4 shows the current density versus potential (J–V) curves for the QD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes measured in the dark and with 106 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination, respectively. The open circuit potentials deduced from the (J–V) curves without illumination, Fig. 4B, can be used to qualitatively evaluate the shift of the CdS QD and CdTe QD Fermi levels due to their contact. According to previous reports,19,20,54 the band gap and conductive band edges of TiO2, CdS and CdTe in bulk are 3.2, 2.24, 1.56 eV and −4.21, −3.98, −3.70 eV, respectively, and are schematically shown in Scheme 1. A cascade band edge structure similar to the TiO2–CdS–CdSe band structure, which has been discussed before,54 was observed in the core/shell QD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode. When CdS and CdTe are brought into contact in a redox couple solution, the Fermi levels of semiconductors and the redox couple solution will be identical after electrostatic equilibrium. The electrons will flow from n-type CdS to p-type CdTe due to the Fermi level difference between CdS and CdTe. Such a Fermi level alignment causes upward and downward shifts of the band edges for CdTe and CdS, respectively. The elevated conduction band edge of CdTe provides a higher driving force for the injection of photogenerated electrons from CdTe to CdS, as well as the injection of excited holes from CdS to CdTe. Importantly, this equilibrium Fermi level is equivalent to the open circuit potentials of an electrode measured without light illumination. The open circuit potentials measured for the CdS QDs-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode (−1.29 V) is lower than that of the CdTe–TiO2 NTA photoelectrode (−1.40 V). When the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD heterostructure is formed electrons will flow from CdTe to CdS until a new electronic equilibrium is formed, where the CdTe Fermi level is equal that of CdS. The open circuit potential measured for the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode was at −1.38 V, indicating a stepwise conduction band edge as shown in Scheme 1.54 That is to say, the conduction band edge of the shell material is located in the bandgap of the core, indicating the formation of the type-II semiconductor heterostructures. Upon excitation of the semiconductor nanocrystals, the resulting staggered band alignment leads to a spatial separation of the hole and electron which are strongly localized in the core and shell, respectively41 More importantly, the p-type CdTe is favorable for hole transportation. For the n-type CdS semiconductors, the electron transportation is more favorable than hole transfer. Thus, this stepwise band structure of TiO2/CdTe/CdS is advantageous to electron and hole transfer for both inner CdTe and outer CdS layers, and results in a lower electron transport resistance. The energy band segregates the hole to the core and the electron to the shell thus offering a high driving force for electron injection from QDs to TiO2.

(B) The I–V characteristics of the same electrodes measured in the dark. (C) The corresponding photoconversion efficiencies under one sun illumination. 
As seen in Fig. 4A the photocurrents demonstrate a strong dependence on the photoelectrode core/shell heterostructure. When only CdS or CdTe QD were used as the sensitizer, the largest photocurrent densities were 1.31 mA cm−2 and 1.23 mA cm−2, respectively. For the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes the photocurrent density increased to ≈9.17 mA cm−2, dramatically larger than the values obtained with only one sensitizer. The corresponding light to chemical energy conversion efficiencies are shown in Fig. 4C, which were calculated as follows:55 (1)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpE0rev the total power output, jp|Eapp| the electrical power input, and I0 the power density of the incident light (106 mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential which is 1.23 V/NHE, and the applied potential Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode at open circuit conditions, under the same illumination, and in the same electrolyte. The voltage at which the photocurrent becomes zero was taken as Eaoc.
The efficiencies measured for the CdS- and CdTe-QD sensitized cells were 0.51% at −0.76 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the irradiation and 0.45% at −0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the irradiation, respectively, the values are in agreement with previous reports.56 The slightly higher efficiency of the CdS sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes is attributed to its broader light absorption range which leads to a slightly higher short-circuit current density Jsc (1.31 mA cm−2) compared with that of the CdTe sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes (1.23 mA cm−2).57 For the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes, a saturated photocurrent density of ≈9.17 mA cm−2 represents a marked increase. This result is quite remarkable, considering the small length of the TiO2 NTA (≈300 nm), the maximum photoconversion efficiency obtained for this device was 6.12% at −0.98 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the irradiation. To the best of our knowledge the total photoconversion efficiency is the highest in the field of QD-sensitized photoelectrodes.58
The open-circuit dark-light-dark photovoltage responses were conducted to investigate the recombination kinetics of the different photoelectrodes by monitoring the Voc transient during relaxation from an illuminated quasi-equilibrium state to the dark equilibrium.59 When the AM-1.5 illumination on a photoelectrode at the open circuit is interrupted, the excess electrons are removed due to recombination, with the photovoltage decay rate directly related to the electron lifetime by the following expression: τn = [−kBT/e][dVoc/dt]−1(2)where kBT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVoc/dt is the open circuit voltage transient. Appropriate use of eqn (2) assumes that the recombination is linear with a first-order dependence on electron concentration and that electron recombination occurs only with the electrolyte.60
The open-circuit dark-light-dark photovoltage response of the different photoelectrodes is shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5B is the plot of the response time obtained by applying eqn (2) to the data in Fig. 5A. The photopotentials of the QD sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes are much higher than those of the unmodified TiO2 NTAs, indicating a greater accumulation of photogenerated electrons. The photopotential decays slowly after the samples are returned to the dark indicating long e− – h+ lifetimes, which is consistent with the character of the core/shell QD. QD sensitization of the TiO2 NTA results in a negative shift of the open circuit potentials from −0.91 V (TiO2 NTA) to −1.49 V (core/shell CdTe-CdS QD TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode), as shown in Fig. 4, indicating enhanced separation of the photogenerated charges.

Photoluminescence emission spectra have been widely used to investigate the excited-state interaction between semiconductor particles. Curve (a) of Fig. 6 shows the emission spectra of CdTe QD (2.4 nm) deposited on a glass slide, exhibiting an emission peak at 541 nm. When CdTe QDs were anchored onto a TiO2 NTA substrate, curve (b) of Fig. 6, a significant quenching of the emission was observed with the same peak value. The CdS QD TiO2 NTA (curve c) displays the same performance. This quenching behavior confirms the excited-state interaction between the two semiconductors, and demonstrates deactivation of the excited CdTe QD via electron transfer to the TiO2 NTAs. Whereas the electrons injected into the TiO2 NTAs were collected to generate photocurrent, it is necessary to employ a redox couple to scavenge holes that would otherwise lead to surface oxidation.61 In a typical photoelectrochemical cell such oxidation is minimized by using a sulfide electrolyte, but not so for CdTe QD. After the construction of the core/shell CdTe/CdS–TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode, the hybrid nanostructure exhibits a more obvious quenched emission, curve (d) of Fig. 6. The quenching behavior confirms that most of the excited electrons in the photoelectrode were transferred to the TiO2 NTAs, significantly improving the photovoltaic performance of the system. The lower photoluminescence intensity of the photoelectrodes suggests a lower density of recombination centers, and consequently a longer lifetime of photogenerated carriers resulted from the introduction of core/shell CdTe/CdS QD.

Furthermore, we investigated the water splitting and photostability of the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode. Under light illumination (106 mW cm−2), we observed gas production at both the photoanode and Pt cathode at the potential corresponding to the maximum efficiency (−0.98 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Fig. 7 shows the collected gas volume as a function of time within 240 min. We collected the gas three times every 60 min with a 10 ml measuring cylinder using a water replacement method under light illumination. Among the two gas collection processes, the light was cut off for 60 min. The hydrogen and oxygen evolved from the photoelectrochemical cell were demonstrated by a gas chromatograph. As shown in the Fig. 7A, the evolution rate stayed nearly constant in the entire 90 min measurement (the volumes of the three collection processes were 1.8, 3.5, 5.2 ml, respectively), suggesting a good stability of the photoelectrode. During the 90 min of exposure to 106 mW cm−2 light illumination, 225.4 μmol of hydrogen gas was generated. Normalizing this rate to time and incident power, we found a hydrogen generation rate of 1560 μmol h−1 W−1. The initial device performance was relatively poor partly due to the possible gas leakage, which could be solved by a better design of the gas collection device. The photostabilities for the different as-prepared photoelectrodes were also measured for 50 min under the continuous illumination (Fig. 7B). During the first 1 h of illumination, we observed delivery of a steady photocurrent from the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode, the drop in photocurrent was less than 5% during this entire period of illumination. While, the drops in photocurrent for the CdTe QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode and CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode were 41% and 17%, respectively. The photocurrent was essentially unchanged during the illumination for the TiO2 NTA photoelectrode.

The long-term stability of the photoelectrode was investigated by storing a core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode in a plastic centrifuge tube over four months. After four months, the total photoconversion efficiency was 4.57%, approximately 75% of the initial efficiency (Fig. S3†). We tested the performance of this photoelectrode three times every two hours, obtaining total photoconversion efficiency values of 4.57%, 4.47% and 4.50%, respectively. The relatively good stability of the photoelectrode is attributed to the CdS surface passivation. Up to now, the decay of conversion efficiency for QDs sensitized photoelectrode seems to be mainly caused by the corrosion of the QDs upon illumination during water splitting. The anodic corrosion is thermodynamically feasible as the photogenerated holes can participate in surface oxidation. Though the presence of S2−/SO32− as a sacrificial reagent (ESI†),62 stability is brought in because it scavenges the holes with competitive kinetics. If the scavenging of holes by the redox couple is kinetically slow, the anodic corrosion is expected to dominate the hole oxidation process.63 In other words, metal chalcogenides are prone to be unstable in electrolytes even in sulfide electrolyte. Though, the CdS shell, with a much lower oxidation potential than CdTe, results in low photooxidative degradation and surface defects, surface oxidation cannot be avoided. Meanwhile, what we should not ignore is that the TiO2 will be reduced to Ti with a standard electrode potential of −0.89 V, which can also corrode the photoelectrode ultimately under water splitting (ESI†). This should be studied in detail in future work for improving the photostability of the photoelectrode completely. According to previous reports, we know that surface modification with higher band gap QDs (such as, ZnS) used as a passivation layer, the photostability of the photoelectrode can be dramatically enhanced. In view of this, ZnS should be a proper candidate in modifying the as-prepared photoelectrode to improve the photostability in future work.
Conclusions
In conclusions, we show significant photoconversion efficiency from a core/shell CdTe/CdS quantum dot sensitized TiO2 NTA photoelectrode under AM 1.5G illumination, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.12%. The first batch of photoelectrochemical cells fabricated using the as-prepared photoelectrode for water splitting was also demonstrated. Under 106 mW cm−2 illumination of visible light, a hydrogen generation rate as high as 1560 μmol h−1 W−1 was achieved. The high efficiency of the photoelectrode was due to both the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD and CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrode, but the former was dominating. We believe the stepwise band-edge level, namely the type-II structure in the core/shell CdTe/CdS QD-TiO2 NTA photoelectrodes, was responsible for the excellent photoelectrode performance. After being stored for four months the photoelectrodes commonly retained approximately 75% of their initial photoconversion efficiency. These results confirm that the CdTe QD photodegradation is reduced when using a sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple, and reduced with construction and deposition of type-II core/shell CdTe/CdS heterostructured nanocrystals on TiO2 nanotube array photoelectrodes. Our results demonstrate that CdTe QD with CdS surface passivation can be used, on a practical basis, as solar cell photo-sensitizers.
