    , Accepted 31st July 2020First published on 31st July 2020AbstractComposition engineering is an active topic of research for optical and electronic (nano)crystals and functional materials. We here demonstrate the control over the ratios and distributions of selenium and sulfur in ternary Sb2(Se,S)3 alloy nanorods (NRs), which were synthesized from a molecular chalcogen precursor, selenium disulfide (SeS2). By increasing the anion/cation precursor ratios (SeS2/SbCl3) from 0.5:1 to 1:1 and 1.5:1, an increase in both the Se fractions and the lengths × diameters of NRs is achieved with the Se and S distributions in Sb2(Se,S)3 varying from homogeneity to inhomogeneity. Within the inhomogeneous NRs obtained at high SeS2/SbCl3 ratios containing excessive chalcogen (Se + S), S decreases but Se increases from the center to the periphery as revealed by EDS elemental analyses performed on individual NRs. In particular, the 1D growth anisotropy of NRs allows for a large chalcogen concentration gradient along the axial direction of the resulting NRs from their middle to the two ends. Such non-uniform Se and S distributions can be rationally interpreted by analyzing the growth kinetics and processes of Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs and would give rise to uncommon (opto)electronic properties towards future nanowire-based devices.
1. Introduction
The chemical composition is one of the critical parameters in regulating and optimizing the properties, functions, and applications of crystalline (nano)materials. Antimony(III) sulfide and selenide as well as their alloyed solid solutions (Sb2S3, Sb2Se3 and ternary Sb2Se3−xSx) are actively studied as kinds of promising semiconducting materials for photoelectric applications such as solar cells and photodetection.1–14 Alloying Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3via chalcogen–anion substitution (chalcogen = S and Se), which is favored by their isostructural nature and similar lattice parameters,11–16 allows for high flexibility in chalcogen composition engineering of ternary Sb2Se3−xSx (x = 0–3) with band gap (Eg) energies varying from 1.1 eV (Sb2Se3) to 1.7 eV (Sb2S3).11–14 An optimum Eg of ∼1.34 eV, a theoretical value for the maximum PCE (33.7% under AM1.5 solar illumination),17 can be accessible in Sb2Se3−xSx by rationally tuning the Se/S ratios. It has been predicted theoretically that the potential photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) may be around 18–29% for Sb2Se3−xSx-based solar cells,18 compared to 20–25% for Sb2S3 or Sb2Se3-sensitized solar cells.16 In this regard, the tunable composition of ternary Sb–Se–S alloyed materials is highly desirable for their band gap, electronic structure, and (opto)electronic property regulation.
To date, the preparation of ternary Sb2Se3−xSx with tunable composition has attracted much interest. For example, thermal evaporation of Sb2Se3−xSx polycrystalline ingots,19 Sb2S3/Sb2Se3 mixed powders,20 or Sb2Se3 film/S powder,21 followed by a deposition process onto a substrate, could produce ternary thin films. Alloying Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 thin layers22 and the post-selenization of Sb2S3 thin films using different selenium sources11,23,24 at elevated temperatures could both make Sb2Se3−xSx thin films. Furthermore, they could be prepared by spin-casting a soluble Sb, Se and S precursor solution on a substrate and then annealing it at elevated temperatures.25–27 Besides thin films, Sb2Se3−xSx bulk crystals were synthesized by sintering the Sb + S + Se elements in a vacuum-sealed silica vessel;19,28 Sb–Se–S single-crystal nanotubes with tunable composition and band gap energies were obtained by injecting a Sb(III) precursor into a Se + S paraffin liquid solution at 220 °C;29 the co-thermolysis of (Et2Sb)2S and (Et2Sb)2Se in 1,3-diisopropylbenzene produced ternary Sb2(S,Se)3 nanowires.30
In theory, if the diffusion of chalcogen anions is sufficient, the isostructure-favored alloying mechanism would result in a uniform, homogeneous S, Se and Sb distribution in Sb2Se3−xSx in the form of either thin films,25–27 bulk crystals,19,28 or free-standing nanotubes and nanowires.29,30 However, chalcogen anions have a relatively large radius, such as 184 pm for S2− and 198 pm for Se2−,31 and thus Se and S show low diffusivity relative to small-sized metal cations.32 Meanwhile, other factors including the differences in the reactivity of Se (H2Se) and S (H2S) precursors, the solubility product constants (Ksp) of Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 crystals,33 and the bond dissociation energies (BDEs) (or bond strengths) of Sb–S and Sb–Se bonds34 may thermodynamically and dynamically cause the inhomogeneous incorporations and distributions of the S and Se elements in Sb–Se–S. In recent years, Sb–Se–S thin films with a variable or graded Se and S concentration at different depths of the films have been successfully designed and prepared with the aim of promoting their photovoltaic performance.11,20,22
In this work, we demonstrate S and Se inhomogeneous distributions in free-standing Sb–Se–S nanorods (NRs), which were synthesized using selenium disulfide (SeS2) as a single-source chalcogen-anion precursor. Different molar ratios of the SeS2/SbCl3 precursors (0.5:1, 1:1 and 1.5:1) were employed and found to play key roles in tuning the lengths × diameters, the Se proportion, the lattice parameters and the optical band gaps of the resulting Sb–Se–S NRs. Based on the microscopic elemental analyses of individual NRs by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), it is interesting to find that the Se and S distributions in the Sb–Se–S NRs vary from homogeneity to inhomogeneity at high SeS2/SbCl3 ratios. For the compositionally inhomogeneous Sb–Se–S NRs, S is concentrated at the middle of the NRs and decreases from the center to the periphery, but Se shows an opposite distribution and dominates the two ends of the NRs. Furthermore, we will make a reasonable explanation for such a chalcogen distribution phenomenon in view of the growth dynamics of the Sb–Se–S NRs, wherein the sequence of S and Se incorporation into the crystal lattice and their concentration are changed with time.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Sb–Se–S nanorods
Antimony trichloride (SbCl3, 99.98% metals basis), selenium disulfide (SeS2, 97%), and oleylamine (OLA, C18H37N, C18: 80–90%) were purchased from Aladdin Chemicals (China) and were used as received. In a typical synthetic procedure, 0.5 mmol (0.1141 g) SbCl3 and 10 mL OLA were loaded into a 100 mL three-necked flask, and then the flask was heated to 200 °C under a nitrogen flow and magnetic stirring. After 30 min, different molar amounts of SeS2 solid powder (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mmol) were swiftly added into the above solution and the reaction continued at 200 °C for 2.5 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the solid products were precipitated by centrifuging at 8000 rpm, washed with ethanol/hexane three to four times, and dried at 60 °C for further characterization.
2.2 Sample characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded on a JEM F2100 electron microscope with a working voltage of 200 kV. The micro-area chemical composition of individual NRs was measured using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to the JEM F2100 TEM. SEM images were recorded on a JSM-7001F scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a D8 Advance diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, Bruker-AXS). The Sb, Se and S ratios of the Sb–Se–S NRs were measured using an Agilent 5100 ICP-OES. The NR samples were digested with 2 ml of nitric acid (HNO3, 65%) and the solution was diluted with deionized water to obtain a 10% HNO3 solution for the ICP-OES analysis. The absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450).
3. Results and discussion
SeS2 is a commercially available and ambient-stable chemical, and has been used as a non-toxic, active ingredient in antidandruff shampoos.35 It contains the Se and S elements simultaneously and can serve as a very good choice of single-source chalcogen-anion precursor to prepare ternary M–Se–S chalcogenides (M = metal). For instance, the use of SemSn (e.g., SeS4, SeS3, SeS2, SeS, and Se2S) to synthesize alloy PbSxSe1−x nanocrystals was introduced in an early work by Thomson and colleagues,36 where oleylamine (OLA) was selected as a high boiling-point solvent as well as a mild reductant to thermally reduce SeS2 to H2Se (Se2−) and H2S (S2−) at elevated temperatures. Herein, ternary Sb–Se–S is expected to be formed through the OLA-mediated reaction between an antimony(III) precursor (SbCl3) and SeS2.
In order to assess the effects of the molar ratios of the SeS2/SbCl3 precursors on the morphology, size and composition of the Sb–Se–S products, three typical SeS2/SbCl3 ratios were chosen, namely 0.5:1, 1:1 and 1.5:1, corresponding to the (Se + S)/Sb anion/cation ratios in the precursors being 1.5:1, 3:1 and 4.5:1 (Table 1), respectively. The total chalcogen (Se + S) amount in the first case is equal to the stoichiometric ratio of the product Sb2(Se,S)3, whereas that in the latter two cases is obviously excessive. Fig. 1a–c show the TEM images of the samples obtained at different SbCl3/SeS2 ratios. They all clearly exhibit a one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured morphology. Recently, Xia et al. proposed that 1D nanostructures (typically nanowires and nanorods) with an aspect ratio lower than 30 are called nanorods (NRs).37 According to the statistical TEM data based on not less than 100 Sb–Se–S individuals (Fig. 1 and S1 in the ESI†), while their average diameters and lengths increase as the amount of SeS2 increases, their aspect ratios only exhibit a minor change (Table 1). Because their aspect ratios are generally lower than 30 (Table 1), these 1D Sb–Se–S nanostructures are here defined as NRs.

The formation of a 1D rod-like shape for Sb–Se–S can be attributed to a structure-driven crystal growth mechanism, which is closely correlated with the highly anisotropic crystal structure of Sb2Ch3 (Ch = S and Se, as revealed by XRD shown in Fig. 2). As is known, binary Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 crystals are isostructural and crystallize in the orthorhombic Pbnm space group,3,12–14,26,29 and their lattice constants are very close, that is, a = 1.123 and 1.158 nm, b = 1.131 and 1.174 nm, and c = 0.3841 and 0.3955 nm for bulk Sb2S3 (JCPDS# 42-1393) and Sb2Se3 (JCPDS# 89-0821), respectively. As the basic building unit of Sb2Ch3, 1D [Sb4Ch6]n ribbons consisting of covalent Sb–Ch bonds run along the [001] direction and they are interlinked via the weak van der Waals forces in the [100] and [010] crystallographic orientations (see Fig. 5a and b).6,8–10 Such a 1D structural characteristic would drive Sb2Ch3 crystals to grow into 1D nanostructures along the running orientation of the [Sb4Ch6]n ribbons.8,9,29,30,38–40 As shown in Fig. 1d, the HRTEM studies confirm the [001]-oriented growth habit of the Sb–Se–S NRs, which is in good agreement with the above proposal. In the comparison experiments, binary Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 also both exhibit the 1D growth feature as expected. As displayed in Fig. S2,† Sb2S3 shows a rod-bundle shape composed of many secondary NRs8,41 and Sb2Se3 is in the form of NRs when elemental S and Se powders were respectively used for the synthesis of binary Sb2Ch3.

XRD measurements provide further evidence for the orthorhombic structure and high crystallinity/purity of the as-prepared Sb–Se–S NRs. According to the XRD patterns (Fig. 2a), all of them resemble the standard XRD models for binary crystalline Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 but the peak positions (2θ) show a certain degree of deviation from the standard lines (gray lines shown at the top and bottom of Fig. 2a; JCPDS# 42-1393 for Sb2S3 and JCPDS# 89-0821 for Sb2Se3). Such a deviation in peak positions indicates the formation of ternary solid-solution products containing different Se and S proportions.11,25–29 As seen from the enlarged XRD pattern parts between 14 and 19° (2θ) in Fig. 2b, the diffraction peak arising from the (120) plane shifts from 17.263° (d = 5.1325 Å) to 17.090° (d = 5.1840 Å) and 16.917° (d = 5.2366 Å) as the SeS2/SbCl3 ratio rises from 0.5:1 to 1:1 and 1.5:1. The shift of diffraction peaks towards the low 2θ-angle side indicates an increase in the lattice constants with the SeS2 amount, which is due to the increase of the Se fraction in the Sb–Se–S products (Fig. S3†)11,25–27,29 as the Se anion has a larger radius than S (Se: 0.198 nm vs. S: 0.184 nm (ref. 31)). The variable Se/S proportions in the resultant NRs also lead to the composition-dependent optical absorption and Eg values. As the Se fraction increases and the S fraction decreases, the Eg energies of the Sb–Se–S NRs red-shift from 1.42 to 1.28 and 1.15 eV (Fig. S3 and S4†), consistent with previous reports.11–14,19,21,22,25–27,29
As compared in Fig. 2, it is further seen that the (120) peak and other diffraction peaks exhibit a larger full width at half maximum (FWHM), namely a broadening trend at low SeS2/SbCl3 ratios (0.5:1 and 1:1), which is indicative of a relatively small average crystallite size (particularly the diameter) for the corresponding Sb–Se–S NRs, consistent with the TEM observations (Fig. 1 and S1;†Table 1). Meanwhile, because of their diffraction peaks with a sharper shape and higher intensities (Fig. 2), the Sb–Se–S NRs obtained at the 1.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio are of higher crystallinity than the NRs obtained at the 0.5:1 and 1:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratios. But, as revealed by HRTEM studies (Fig. 1d), the Sb–Se–S NRs formed at the latter two ratios are still of good crystallinity. It should be pointed out that the low peak intensity may be due to the inadequate amount of the samples for XRD measurements, not due to poor crystallinity.
ICP-OES measurements were further carried out to identify the detailed Sb, Se and S proportions of the Sb–Se–S products. The results are summarized in Table 1. In general, the ratios of anion/cation, i.e., (Se + S)/Sb, in the three samples all approach the 1.5:1 ratio of stoichiometric Sb2(Se,S)3; the Se content increases rapidly in the products with increasing SeS2/SbCl3 ratios from 0.5:1 to 1:1 and 1.5:1, which is consistent with the peak position shift to the small 2θ-angle side in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2). It is found that the Se/S proportions in all of the products are higher than the 1:2 Se/S ratio in the precursor SeS2. The higher Se fractions in the products suggest that Se is easier to incorporate into Sb–Se–S than S. A similar case has been reported for ternary PbSxSe1−x nanocrystals when SemSn acted as the chalcogen source,32 where the Se percent in the PbSxSe1−x products is higher than that in SemSn.
The Se and S ratios in the Sb–Se–S NRs, either evaluated from the d-value shift in the XRD patterns11,25–27,29 or directly detected by ICP-OES analysis, embody the macroscopic, collective information for the material composition. By contrast, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is a microscopic-area elemental analysis technique and is efficient to probe the chemical composition of a single nanoparticle. Thus, we employed EDS spectra to identify the details of the elemental composition and distributions of individual Sb–Se–S NRs obtained at various SeS2/SbCl3 ratios. Fig. 3a and b show a typical single Sb–Se–S NR synthesized from 0.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 precursors and the corresponding EDS spot-analysis spectra recorded on the middle and two-end parts of the NR. The Sb, Se and S elements are clearly detected in the EDS spectra and the relative intensities of signals from these three elements remain nearly constant at different regions of the NR, meaning that Sb, Se, and S are homogeneously distributed in the profiles of the Sb–Se–S NRs (Fig. 3a and b). More NRs obtained at 0.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 have also been examined and exhibit the composition homogeneity of the Sb, Se and S elements during EDS spot analyses (Fig. S5†). Since Sb–Se–S NRs are selected randomly for our EDS measurements, it can be considered that the ternary Sb–Se–S NRs prepared at the 0.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio generally display a homogeneous distribution of the Se and S elements.
 Fig. 3  TEM images and the corresponding EDS spectra of individual Sb–Se–S NRs prepared at SeS2/SbCl3 ratios of (a and b) 0.5:1 and (c and d) 1.5:1. 
However, Se and S inhomogeneous distributions are found in the Sb–Se–S NRs when higher SeS2/SbCl3 precursor ratios were used in the experiments, for example, 1:1 and 1.5:1. In these two cases, the amount of chalcogen elements (Se + S) in the precursor is obviously excessive relative to the theoretically stoichiometric Sb2Ch3. Based on the EDS spot-mode analysis data collected on more than 20 Sb–Se–S individual NRs obtained at the 1.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio, it is revealed that although Sb is uniformly distributed throughout the NRs, a higher content of S is present in or near the middle of the NRs and that their two ends contain less S or even no S element (Fig. 3c and d and S6†). Such a distribution of the S element is also proven by EDS line-scan elemental analyses (Fig. 4a–d and S7†) which were performed along both the longitudinal (axial) and transverse (radial) directions of the NRs. From the EDS spot and line-scan spectra, it can be concluded that the S concentration within a NR decreases from the center to the periphery (or from inside to outside and from the middle to the two ends), although it cannot be ascertained whether the composition change is uniformly graded. Relative to S, the Se element shows an opposite trend of distribution in the Sb–Se–S NRs (Fig. 3c and d, 4a–d and S7†). Furthermore, EDS mappings of the Sb, Se and S elements indicate that the end of a Sb–Se–S NR contains less S but more Se, as the signal intensity of S Kα1 becomes weak but that of Se Kα1 likely becomes a little stronger (Fig. 4e), which provides more evidence for the inhomogeneous distributions of S and Se in the Sb–Se–S NRs prepared from 1:1.5 SeS2/SbCl3 precursors. Similar Se and S inhomogeneous distributions with a relatively high S content were also confirmed by EDS spot-analysis for the Sb–Se–S NRs prepared from the 1:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio (Fig. S8†).

(e) HAADF-STEM image and EDS mappings of the Sb, Se and S elements of a single Sb–Se–S NR synthesized at the 1.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio. 
Theoretically, ternary Sb–Se–S is formed through an alloying mechanism between Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, during which the mutual anion-site substitution of S (Se) for Se (S) occurs in the crystal lattice.28 Then, the chemical formula of the homogeneous, solid-solution ternary Sb–Se–S NRs can be written as Sb2(Se1−xSx)3. For their chalcogen-inhomogeneous counterparts, it may be better to write their chemical formula as Sb2(Se,S)3. Considering the extreme case where there is no detectable S element at one end or the two ends of some NRs (based on EDS spectra, see Fig. 3c and d and S5†), the chemical formula of these inhomogeneous, chalcogen-graded Sb–Se–S NRs can be written as Sb2(Se,S)3@Sb2Se3. The compositional inhomogeneity and localized distributions of the S and Se elements often induce the formation of a heterogeneous, core@shell nanostructure within a single nanoparticle, like the seeded growth of CdSe@CdS heteronanorods reported previously.42
Below, we will discuss the reasons for the S and Se inhomogeneity in the ternary Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs in the presence of excessive SeS2 used (taking SeS2/SbCl3 = 1.5:1 as an example). It is considered that the S and Se inhomogeneity in the NRs is closely linked with the growth dynamics of the NRs, in which the rate, order and amount of S and Se anions entering the Sb2(Se,S)3 lattice vary with time. As an anion source, SeS2, existing as ring molecules especially like SenS8−n,36,43 will be reduced in oleylamine at elevated temperature to reactive polysulfide ions (Sx2−) and amorphous Se and then to H2S and H2Se,36 respectively. H2S should be generated earlier and faster than H2Se due to the high oxidation ability of S (φS/S2− = 0.142 V vs. φSe/Se2− = −0.399 V at 298 K in acidic aqueous solution) and the high content of the S element in the precursor SeS2 (S/Se = 2:1). Thus, Sb–S species (e.g., clusters) are formed earlier at a higher amount than Sb–Se species at the early stage of reactions. The isostructure between Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 promotes the nucleation and crystal growth of a ternary alloyed Sb2(Se,S)3 solid solution from the Sb–S and Sb–Se species. High concentration and earlier production of H2S and Sb–S species will lead to an S-rich nucleus to initiate the crystallization of the Sb2(Se,S)3 solid solution, which then grows into a 1D NR crystal with a center region containing a relatively high S content (Fig. 5c) driven by the highly anisotropic structure made of 1D [Sb4Ch6]n ribbons (Fig. 5a and b).

H2S is more volatile than H2Se owing to its lighter molecular mass. Meanwhile, Sb2Se3 has a solubility product constant (Ksp) much lower than that of Sb2S3 according to the argument that the sulfide of a metal has a much higher Ksp value than its corresponding selenide.33,44 Such two factors are more likely to decrease the S content and increase the Se proportion (i.e., Se/S ratio) in the Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs during their consequent 1D growth, which could cause the S and Se inhomogeneous distributions in the final Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs.
At low SeS2/SbCl3 molar ratios, for example, 0.5:1, with the 1.5:1 ratio of chalcogen anion/antimony cation in the precursor just equal to that of stoichiometric Sb2Ch3, the obtained Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs exhibit a relatively small size (short length and thin diameter, Table 1) and therefore, their growth should be terminated within a relatively short period of time because of the complete consumption of chalcogen elements with a limited amount, Accordingly, S and Se inhomogeneity is not easy to distinguish by EDS chemical analysis (Fig. 3a and b and S5†). When high SeS2/SbCl3 ratios such as 1.5:1 with excessive chalcogen elements (chalcogen/antimony = 4.5:1) were employed, the lengths and diameters of the resulting NRs increased (Table 1). At the early growth stage, NRs were collected when the reaction proceeded for 30 min (synthesized at 1.5:1 SeS2/SbCl3 ratio); they show short lengths and thin diameters and S and Se can be obviously detectable throughout the NRs (Fig. S9†). At the later stage of NR growth, the volatilization of H2S and the incorporation of more Se anions enabled by the much smaller Ksp of Sb2Se3 will cause the Se proportion to increase and the S content to decrease along the axial and radial directions of the Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs as the NRs grow longer and thicker. Because of the structure-driven anisotropy of the growth rates in the axial and radial directions of the NRs, that is, the Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs grow much faster in the axial <001> direction through the packing of Se2−, S2− and Sb3+ on the (001) and (00−1) crystal planes, Se will be finally dominant at the two ends of the NRs (Fig. 5c), whereas the difference between the Se and S content in the radial direction is not so large as that in the axial direction of the NRs (Fig. 4a–d). Overall, the homogeneous or inhomogeneous distributions of the S and Se elements in the Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs are size-dependent and can be tuned by the SeS2/SbCl3 precursor ratios.
During the formation of inhomogeneous Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs, the slow diffusion kinetics of chalcogen anions owing to their large radius (184 pm for S2− and 198 pm for Se2−)32 also makes a contribution to the S and Se inhomogeneity. By contrast, metal cations generally have a relatively small radius and high diffusivity,32 which are beneficial to the formation of a homogeneous solid solution, for example, (Sb1−xBix)2S3.41,45–47 Different from the use of single-source chalcogen precursors such as SeS2 (in this work or ref. 36), mixing two single-source molecular precursors that contain both metal and chalcogen elements in a single coordination or complex compound was reported as an alternative approach to prepare ternary, complete solid solutions or alloys with homogeneous cationic or anionic distributions.45–50 For instance, the solvent-less co-thermolysis of Bi[S2COEt]3 and Sb[S2COEt]3 ethylxanthates could form (Bi1−xSbx)2S3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) alloys.46 The hot injection of an OLA solution of (C6H5COSe)3Sb(III) and (C6H5COS)3Sb(III) complexes into preheated OLA at 200 °C led to Sb2(S1−xSex)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid solutions over the entire composition range.48 PbS1−xSex and SnS1−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid solutions were also prepared separately by a similar synthetic route.49,50 The presence of M–Ch bonds (Ch = S, Se; M = Sb, Bi, Pb, Sn, etc.) in single-source molecular precursors themselves45–50 is beneficial to the anionic or cationic diffusion to generate homogeneously complete solid solutions while avoiding volatile gaseous H2S and H2Se, which are easily generated from the reduction of SeS2. However, one of the disadvantages of using single-source molecular precursors to synthesize ternary solid solutions is that the preparation of single-source molecular precursors requires more tedious work and time.
At the same time, the oil-bath oleylamine-mediated solution synthesis is a low-temperature open system for crystal growth, unlike the reaction conditions in a sealed, evacuated quartz vessel, in which an adequate diffusion of S2− and Se2− could be easily accessed to generate a completely alloyed solid solution of Sb2S3−xSex with homogeneous Se and S distributions if a long-term and high-temperature reaction (500 °C for 96 h) was met.28 In addition, the separate nucleation and growth of Sb2Se3 NRs and Sb2S3 NRs due to the difference in Ksp can be largely restrained by the isostructure-favored alloying process. When SeS2 was used as the chalcogen source to react with BiCl3, Bi2S3 NRs and Bi2Se3 nanosheets were generated separately (Fig. S10†). The reason for the phase separation is mainly the big difference in the crystal structures between Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3, that is, Bi2S3 has an orthorhombic phase that is also adopted by Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 (ref. 16, 41 and 51) whereas Bi2Se3 preferably crystallizes in a rhombohedral (hexagonal) phase.16
Conclusions
Free-standing ternary Sb2(Se,S)3 alloyed NRs were prepared using SeS2 as a molecular chalcogen-anion source. Their formation was correlated with an isostructure-favored alloying mechanism enabled by the mutual substitution of S2− and Se2− anions. With the increase of the SeS2/SbCl3 precursor ratios, it was found that the lengths and diameters of the resultant NRs increase and that the S and Se distributions vary from homogeneity to inhomogeneity. EDS elemental analysis indicated that the proportion of S decreases whereas that of Se increases from the center to the periphery in inhomogeneous NRs. We rationally explained such S and Se inhomogeneity based on the dynamic factors of NR growth, which include the order and rate of the generation of H2S (S2−) and H2Se (Se2−), the volatility of H2S and H2Se, the Ksp values of binary Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 and the growth anisotropy of NRs in their axial and radial directions. The S and Se inhomogeneous distributions may result in interesting electronic structures, band gaps, lattice strain, electron/phonon transport and van der Waals heterointerfaces within individual Sb2(Se,S)3 NRs, which would promise novel (opto)electronic properties and find future use in nanoscale devices, particularly those built on a single semiconducting NR or NW.
