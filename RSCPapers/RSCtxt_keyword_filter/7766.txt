, Accepted 7th July 2016First published on 8th July 2016AbstractThe present work demonstrates the application of a composite gel based electrolyte for the fabrication of quasi solid state dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Two gel electrolyte compositions were prepared using poly-ethylene glycol (PEG), titanium di-oxide (TiO2) and ionic liquids with only succinonitrile (SCN) and succinonitrile:thiourea (SCN:TU). Fabrication of DSSCs was carried out by sandwiching two gel electrolyte compositions between a dye sensitized photo anode and a platinum counter electrode. The electrolyte compositions were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies. The presence of SCN:TU in the electrolyte introduced an interconnected network with titania-nano clusters embedded uniformly inside the host matrix. EIS and CV analysis demonstrated reduced charge transfer resistance and increased current density values. These results were found to be in accordance with current density–voltage measurements of DSSCs which revealed 5 times enhancement in short circuit current density and approximately 3 times enhanced efficiency of 2.38% with the addition of SCN:TU inside the electrolyte matrix. However, slight reduction in open circuit voltage (from 0.68 V to 0.53 V) on addition of SCN:TU was observed. This may be attributed to downward movement of the quasi Fermi level of titania relative to the redox potential of the electrolyte. These results were also confirmed by absorption spectroscopy analysis. The combination SCN:TU was found to be an efficient additive for quasi solid state electrolyte based DSSC applications.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells, DSSCs, also referred to as “Grätzel Cells”,1 hold marked significance in respect of simplicity and eco-friendly components embedded inside an easily compiled, portable light sensitive architecture. A DSSC separates the process of charge carrier transport and light absorption imitating the process of photosynthesis. Hence this technology is often referred to as “artificial photosynthesis”.2 DSSCs represent a leading photovoltaic technology that has attracted substantial research interest during the last two decades. Many research reports are available in the literature focusing on improvements in the device structure, dyes, semiconductor oxides, catalysts and electrolytes etc.3–8 However, the present status of efficiency and lifetime need great improvement to enable commercial application of the product.
The basic functioning of a DSSC depends on the interactions between the cell's electrodes and a wide band gap semiconductor oxide film coated with a light sensitive dye and surrounded by an electrolyte. In response to the incident light, the dye gets excited and transfers its electron to the conduction band of the semiconductor oxide. The electrolyte in between the dye and the counter electrode helps in regeneration of dye molecules and gets recharged itself by the counter electrode. Meanwhile, the movement of electrons in the conduction band of semiconductor oxide is simultaneously associated with the diffusion of charge-compensating cations in the electrolyte material. Therefore, the generation of electric power in DSSC causes no permanent chemical change or transformation.9 However, the performance of DSSC as a whole depends significantly on the performance of the electrolyte medium being used. An ideal electrolyte is a driving force for dye regeneration and fast electron transfer from the counter electrode. As per their physical state they are classified as solid, liquid and quasi solid state electrolytes. DSSC with liquid electrolytes are reported to have highest efficiency of 13%10 with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V with Co-based redox electrolyte and 11% efficiency with Voc of 0.9 V in case of iodine based redox couple.11 However, volatilization of the liquid electrolyte and sealing problems associated with such devices is one of the main factors hampering the practical application of these cells. On the contrary, solid electrolytes for DSSCs are based on inorganic p-type materials such as copper iodide/copper(I) thiocyanate (CuI/CuSCN) and organic polymers such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) have been studied which due to their feeble interaction with the mesoporous photoanodes and lesser intrinsic conductivity results in reduced efficiency values as compared to their liquid counterparts.12–14 Therefore, limited long term stability of liquid electrolyte based DSSCs and restricted performance of solid state electrolyte based DSSCs has led to a common solution of gel electrolytes based DSSCs. Gel electrolytes are considered as optimal compromise between liquid and solid state electrolytes and therefore efficiency and lifetime of the resulting devices. These semi solid or gel based electrolytes basically consists of solid ion conductors with salts dissolved in polymer matrix.15 For example, some of the polymers used in electrolytes are already reported namely, poly-ethylene oxide (PEO), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly ethylene glycol (PEG), succinonitrile (SCN) etc.15–17 SCN is a colourless molecular crystalline solid having waxy consistency with good solvent as well as plasticizing properties. The plasticizing effect of SCN is known to reduce the crystallinity of the polymers resulting in better electrical conductivity and ion diffusivity. For example, PEO:SCN blend is reported to exhibit better thermal stability as compared to pristine succinonitrile.16 Inorganic nanoparticles such as TiO2 and SiO2 are generally added to these systems generating a quasi-solid network which contains self-assembled channels supporting ionic transport through these electrolytes.17
Apart from these components, additives are also introduced to ensure sufficient improvement in photo voltage or photocurrent of the resulting DSSCs. Among these additives, heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) and thiourea (TU) are most commonly used.16,18,19 Among the considered additives, TBP is generally found to increase the Voc due to its neutral and brönsted nature.18 This has been attributed to the negative displacement of the TiO2 conduction band and the decrease in the recombination of electrons on the TiO2 surface. Guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) which is ionic in nature is known to increase the Voc due to positive shift in the conduction band edge of TiO2. Byrne et al. have reported the combination of SCN with GuSCN as an additive with 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazoliuum iodide (DMPII) and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII) ionic liquids with simplified fabrication process.16 Using TU as an additive has been studied with 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII) and I2 which resulted in 23% increase in efficiency.19 However, the increased efficiency in case of liquid electrolytes based cells is also associated with reduced lifetimes and leakage problems.
The present work demonstrates the use of thiourea (TU) as an additive due to its neutral and brönsted base nature with SCN as a conducting plasticizer along with other components in the electrolyte. Further, the addition of TiO2 in the electrolyte medium acts as a filler material forming a quasi-solid network with ion transporting self-assembled channels. The present electrolyte composition harnesses the positive impact of SCN as a plasticizing polymer16 and TU as a brönsted base additive18 that increases the number of H+ ions in the combination thereby increasing the Jsc value. Quasi solid state DSSC based on the prepared electrolyte composition and their characterisation have been described in detail. The impact of the electrolyte composition with SCN:TU has been explained on the performance parameters of DSSC including Jsc and Voc values.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Tetra-titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), propanol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (1.128 g mol−1), acetic acid, iodine (I2), titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2), di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719), acetonitrile (AcN) and succinonitrile (SCN) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used as such without further purification. Ethanol (Analytical Reagent), thiourea (TU) (Merck), potassium iodide (KI) (ExcelR) were purchased and were used without further purification. Fluorine doped tin oxide plates (FTO) with sheet resistance of 7 Ω sq−1 were procured from Sigma Aldrich and were cleaned before further processing.
For preparing the reference electrolyte, 55% of host matrix containing gelling agents and 35% redox couple solution based on KI and I2 were mixed together. For redox couple solution, 25 mg I2 and 125 mg KI were mixed in acetonitrile in wt ratio of 1:5. The host matrix comprised of a 1:1 mixture of PEG:SCN with 10% TiO2 as a filler.
In this way, the reference electrolyte A1 consisted of:Host matrix (0.5PEG:0.5SCN) + TiO2 + redox couple
For preparing the proposed electrolyte A2, SCN in host matrix was replaced by a 1:1 mixture of SCN and TU. In this way, the proposed electrolyte A2 consisted of:Host matrix (0.5PEG:0.25SCN:0.25TU) + TiO2 + redox couple
Materials characterization
The UV-Vis studies of dye N719 were performed with UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2600) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. The morphology of electrolytes was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Carl Zeiss). The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using Solar Simulator (Sciencetech) and Keithley 2400 source meter. The electrochemical impedance studies were carried out using a using SI 1260 Solartron Impedance/phase analyser in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz bias voltage of 1 V. The measurements were carried out on a thin layer cell composed of prepared composite electrolyte between two platinum electrodes with the configuration glass/Pt/electrolyte/Pt/glass. Cyclic voltammetry experiment was carried out using CH Instruments Electrochemical analyzer and a three electrode system with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
Device fabrication and characterisation
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass plates were used as the starting substrates. These were first patterned and cleaned using de ionized water, acetone, trichloroethylene and isopropyl alcohol for 20 minutes each sequentially using an ultrasonic bath and then dried. A blocking layer of TTIP was deposited between FTO and TiO2 so as to reduce the recombination occurring between FTO and electrolyte. It was prepared by spin coating 0.15 M TTIP in propanol at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes and dried at 125 °C. TiO2 paste was prepared using PEG and acetic acid and was applied using doctor blading technique on the conductive side of the plates leaving space for taking connections on the FTO. These TiO2 coated FTO plates were then sintered at 450 °C for 90 minutes in a muffle furnace. The dried TiO2 coated plates were dipped in this solution for 24 hours in 0.3 mM solution of N719 in ethanol at room temperature. The plates were then rinsed and dried at 70 °C for 20 minutes. The electrolytes A1 and A2 were applied on the dye dipped TiO2 plates simultaneously. The cell fabrication was completed by using platinum electrodes on the top so as to form an active area of 0.5 cm2 between the electrodes.
Result and discussion
The sensitizer molecules anchored on the surface of mesoporous semiconductor oxide film perform a fundamental function in DSSC working. Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of N719 dye solution in ethanol as used in the present study. The dye exhibited two broad visible bands at 390 nm and 520 nm which are generally ascribed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process. The absorption peak at 316 nm and a shoulder at 250 nm can be attributed to intraligand (π–π*) charge transfer transition.19,20 The intense spectral coverage was expected to efficiently capture the incident photons when used inside the DSSCs.

The electrolyte films on the glass substrates were also analysed using SEM. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the thin films of electrolytes A1 and A2 on plain glass substrates.

SEM micrographs clearly reveal the well distributed surface morphology of electrolyte A1 with nano clusters of sizes 50–70 nm. However, as SCN:TU combination was introduced into the electrolyte A2, morphology was entirely modified. The interconnected nano clusters of size ranging from 40–60 nm uniformly embedded inside the amorphous matrix could be easily seen in the SEM micrograph as shown in Fig. 2(b).
The conductivity of the electrolytes is one of the significant parameter affecting the overall photovoltaic performance of a DSSC. Electrochemical impedance studies were carried out to analyse the conductivity of the electrolyte media sandwiched in between two platinum electrodes with glass as a supporting substrate. This set up ensures homogeneous distribution of electric field on the surface of two similar platinum electrodes resulting in diffusion dependent charge transport mechanism.21 Fig. 3 shows the Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrolytes A2 and A1 i.e., with and without thiourea prepared using acetonitrile as the solvent.
 Fig. 3  Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra of the electrolyte compositions A1 and A2. 
The plots exhibited two semicircles in high and low frequency regions. The semicircle in the high-frequency region corresponds to the charge-transfer process at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface22 and that at low frequency represents the process of ion diffusion inside the electrolyte. It can be seen clearly from the figure that overall resistance of the medium reduced significantly on addition of TU to SCN matrix. The series resistance of both the samples was found to be 4.3 Ω signifying negligible effect on the electrode–electrolyte interfacial resistance. Further, the charge transfer resistance of electrolyte A2 with thiourea was found to be 11.3 Ω as compared to increased value of 12 Ω for the electrolyte A1 without thiourea. This charge transfer resistance is generally known to exhibit significant impact on charge carrier transport process within the electrolyte.23,24 This lower resistance with increased ion diffusion was expected to contribute positively to the efficiency of the devices.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies have been carried out to study the effect of presence of SCN:TU on the electrolytic property of the composite electrolyte prepared. Fig. 4 shows the CV voltammograms for the gel electrolyte composition with and without thiourea.

The experiment was carried out using three electrode system over a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 vs. AgCl as the reference electrode. Anodic peak due to oxidation and cathodic peak due to reduction of tri-iodide (I3−) ions were observed as represented by the following chemical reactions contributing significantly to the DSSCs working:25

The presence of very small hysteresis confirmed steady state conditions. The Ered and Eoxd of electrolyte A1 can be seen around 1.8–2.2 V and 0.6–0.8 V respectively. In case of A2, Ered and Eoxd can be observed at around 1.3–1.7 V and 1.4–1.9 V. In this figure, the exact peak positions were not clearly visible due to low current values. This can be due to the fact that dilute solutions of the electrolytes were taken to avoid the turbulence related to viscous nature of the concentrated polymer based electrolyte compositions. However, it can be clearly seen from the figure that the addition of SCN:TU in the electrolyte increased the current values considerably. The current increased from 0.013 A to 0.019 A with the addition of TU resulting in approximately 46% increase. This can be attributed to the reduction of charge transport resistance of the electrolyte medium as observed in the impedance analysis also.
The effect of the presence of SCN:TU inside the electrolyte composition was also studied by fabricating DSSCs using the electrolytes A1 and A2. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with electrolytes A1 and A2 at different incident light intensities ranging from 0 to 100 mW cm−2.
 Fig. 5  Current density voltage characteristics of the devices with electrolyte (a) A1 and (b) A2. 
It can be seen from Fig. 6 that short circuit current density increases from 1.78 mA cm−2 to 8.97 mA cm−2 signifying 5 times enhancement. The presence of electrolyte composition A2 contributes to higher current density as observed in cyclic voltammetry studies also. This significant enhancement in Jsc can be attributed to increased interconnecting channels facilitating charge transport collection in the electrolyte composition A2 as compared to A1 without SCN:TU. The conversion efficiency achieved in the device with A2 as electrolyte was found to be 2.37% as compared to only 0.73%@100 mW cm−2 for the device with A1 electrolyte signifying approximately 3 times enhanced efficiency with the addition of SCN:TU. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with and without SCN:TU i.e., with electrolytes composition A1 and A2 are given in Table 1.

The enhancement in efficiency values can be understood as follows. Voc is generally expressed as:25 
(3)where kT is the thermal energy, Ec is the TiO2 conduction band edge, Ered is the redox potential of the electrolyte, nc is the density of free electrons in conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and Nc is the density of accessible states in CB. Therefore, the energy difference (Ec − Ered) and free electron density nc play a crucial role in any change observed in Voc values.26 In the present work, the device with electrolyte A2 exhibited slightly reduced open circuit voltage Voc of 0.53 V as compared to 0.68 V for the device with electrolyte A1. This approximately 22% decrease in the Voc may be attributed to downward movement of quasi Fermi level of TiO2 relative to the redox potential of I−/I3− resulting in overall positive shift of TiO2 CB edge. In this process, the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the TiO2–electrolyte interface moves closer to the I−/I3− couple and away from the excited state of sensitizer N719 used.19,27,28 Therefore, it is anticipated that the positive shift of TiO2 CB edge is not entirely compensated by reduced charge recombination rates inside the device resulting in slightly reduced Voc values. However, the improved ion diffusion process in the presence of SCN:TU results in huge enhancement in Jsc value leading to overall increased efficiency of the device with A1 as electrolyte medium. These results were found to be in conformity with the results obtained in impedance and CV analyses. This overall increase in efficiency with increased photocurrent and slightly reduced photo voltage on addition of SCN:TU in the electrolyte matrix was further investigated by spectroscopic studies. Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two electrolyte compositions A1 and A2.
 Fig. 7  UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two electrolyte compositions A1 and A2. 
The absorption intensity in the range of 350–400 nm is strongly reduced in the case of electrolyte A2 signifying substantially reduced amount of triiodide ionic species due to the presence of TU inside the electrolyte matrix. It is well-known that I3− ions play a significant role in the dye regeneration as well as charge recombination mechanisms in DSSCs. There are two recombination pathways in these cells. The electrons in the TiO2 conduction band (TiO2 CB) may either recombine with the oxidized dye molecules or react with the tri-iodide ions present in the electrolyte. As the rate of reduction of the ionized dye molecules by I− ions is very fast, the net recombination process controlling the functioning of DSSCs is represented by the reaction:29 
2e− (TiO2CB) + I3− (electrolyte) → 3I−
(4)which shows that decreased concentration of I3− ions leads to reduced charge recombination.30 This is advantageous for the performance improvement in DSSCs as incident light around 360 nm is generally absorbed by these triiodide ions.19,31,32 The reaction between thiourea (CH4N2S) and iodine (I2) results in the formation of protons and iodide ions along with other products. The generation of these protons is responsible for increased acidity of the medium which causes increase in photocurrent density and reduced voltage. Moreover, the generation of iodide ions also results in further enhancement in photocurrent density.19,31,32
In addition to positive impact of the TU, as described above, the presence of SCN is expected to act as a supplement to enhance the cell performance. SCN is well known to be a plastic crystal having good solvent characteristics and a stable plastic phase in 233–331 K temperature range. The molecules in plastic phase exhibit the presence of three possible isomeric conformations two (identical) gauche isomers and one trans isomer, interrelated by a 120° rotation around the central C–C bond.16,33–36 O. Byrne et al. have reported that the presence of these isomers results in generation of mono vacancies in the lattice resulting in higher orders of I−/I3− ion diffusion process which is also depicted in CV and impedance analyses of the electrolytes.16 Therefore, in the present work, the modification of electrolyte composition by the addition of SCN:TU was found to be responsible for overall enhanced efficiency. The DSSCs fabricated with electrolyte compositions A2 and A1 were also tested for long term practical stability. Fig. 8 shows the time dependent normalized efficiency parameters: Jsc, Voc and efficiency of these cells.

The cells were stored at room temperature subjected to constant light illumination and periodically measured efficiency parameters. Even after 3000 minutes of operation, the cells with electrolyte A2 retained 50% of the initial efficiency as compared to only 25% of the value retained in the device with electrolyte composition A1. The corresponding measurement of Voc and Jsc also exhibited quite slower decay rates demonstrating higher stability. These results exhibited significant stability of electrolyte A2 with SCN:TU as an important component suppressing leakage or evaporation problems generally observed with liquid electrolytes.
Conclusions
The effect of addition of SCN:TU inside quasi solid state electrolyte composition on DSSC performance was analyzed in detail. The addition of the TU in the electrolyte medium was found to exhibit about 5 times enhancement in short circuit current density and slightly reduced open circuit voltage Voc of 0.53 V as compared to 0.68 V for the device with electrolyte A1. This about 22% decrease in the Voc has been attributed to downward movement of quasi Fermi level of TiO2 relative to the redox potential of I−/I3− resulting in overall positive shift of TiO2 CB edge. The analysis of absorption spectra further confirmed reduction in triiodide ions concentration signifying the reaction between TU and iodine. Impedance and cyclic voltammetry studies also confirmed a significant reduction of charge transport resistance of the electrolyte medium A2. The device with electrolyte A2 was able to exhibit conversion efficiency of 2.38% as compared to only 0.73%@100 mW cm−2 for the device with A1 electrolyte signifying approximately 3 times enhanced efficiency with the addition of SCN:TU. Lifetime tests of the device with electrolyte A2 demonstrated significantly slower decay rates as compared to the device with electrolyte A1. The combination SCN:TU was found to be an efficient additive for the quasi solid state electrolyte based DSSCs applications.
