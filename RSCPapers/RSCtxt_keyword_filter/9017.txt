1. Introduction

Graphene, as the youngest member of the prominent carbon family, is the name for a single layer of graphite and is considered as the basic unit for all other members of carbon family (Fig. 1).1Graphene has many extraordinary electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties, such as high carrier mobility,2 ambipolar electrical field effect,3 tunable band gap,4 room temperature quantum hall effect,5–7 high elasticity,8 superior thermal conductivity,9 and so on.10–13 Despite being found not long ago, it has been one of the most attractive materials in more and more research fields.14–19

Carbon nanotubes are considered as the seamless wrapping of graphene. So, it is easy to understand that graphene and carbon nanotubes have many similar physical and chemical properties though their different sizes and dimensions cause small differences. It is just their similarities that promote the rapid development of graphene through applying the research strategies of carbon nanotubes to graphene.
In this feature article, we review the electronic structures and physical properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene, and then present the recent progress on graphene studies applying carbon nanotubes research strategies. The conversion and hybrid structures of carbon nanotubes and graphene are also reviewed and some perspectives on opportunities and challenges for graphene studies are included in the last part.
2. The electronic structures of carbon nanotubes and graphene
Derived from graphite, graphene is a two-dimensional planar honeycomb structure made out of hexagons. The unit cell for graphene consists two carbon atoms, which generates two π bands, a π-band and a π*-band. The two bands touch each at the K-point in the hexagonal first-Brillouin zone and remain equal in energy for symmetry reasons. So, graphene is a semi-metal or zero-gap semiconductor, combining metallic and semiconducting characteristics. Its density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy EF is zero and increases linearly on both sides of EF (Fig. 2). Carbon nanotubes are considered as wrapping by graphene sheets. Due to different rolling vectors (or called chiral vectors), carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting.20

More interestingly, when graphene reaches quasi-one-dimension as carbon nanotubes, that is graphene ribbons, a few nanometres in width, called graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), it can also be either metallic or semiconducting like carbon nanotubes depending on the edge structure and ribbon width. Tight-binding calculation shows that zigzag GNRs are always metallic while armchair GNRs can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on different width.21 DFT calculations and experimental results further show that the energy gap for semiconducting GNRs is inversely to the ribbon width.22–24 These fascinating electronic properties make them shining stars on nanoelectronics applications.25
3. Synthesis of graphene derived from carbon nanotubes

Graphene is first obtained through repeated peeling (micromechanical exfoliation) of small mesas of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which seems to break the rule that no 2D crystals can exist under ambient conditions and show us many unusual properties.3 However, the micromechanical exfoliation method for preparing graphene is very inefficient. Many other methods for graphene synthesis have been introduced in the subsequent years, such as epitaxial growth on SiC or ruthenium,26,27 exfoliation of intercalated graphite,28reduction of graphite oxide,29–32 organic solvent exfoliation,33 organic synthesis,34 and so on. All the exfoliation methods are low efficient to get single-layer graphene sheets as few-layer graphene sheets even thicker graphite pillars always coexist. The method reduction of graphite oxides always causes too many defects while the other methods all have obvious shortcomings for further applications. A scalable and controllable method for synthesis of high-quality single-layer graphene sheets is needed.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and arc-discharge are the most common methods for carbon nanotubes synthesis.35 Both of them are highly selective to obtain single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by using suitable catalysts. Moreover, through optimization of synthesis conditions, the synthesized SWNTs can both realize scalable, controllable, high-purity and high-quality for various applications. Given this, many research groups moved their eyes to the similarity of graphene and carbon nanotubes and tried to use CVD or arc-discharge methods to synthesis the graphene sheets.
In 2009, Kim et al. and Reina et al. first successfully synthesized wafer-sized graphene films through the CVD method with a patterned Ni layer as the catalyst almost at the same time (Fig. 3A and 3B).36,37 They also found that by varying the thickness of the Ni layer, the growth time and/or the ultraviolet treatment time, the number of graphene layers can be easily controlled. After the growth, graphene sheets can also be easily transferred to any substrate for further applications. Their success on synthesis of graphene sheets by CVD method encouraged more groups. Li et al. synthesized centimetre-sized continuous and uniform graphene sheets using copper foils as the catalyst and the substrate. They found that the synthesized graphene sheets are predominantly single-layer with more than 95% in area according to a self-limiting growth process caused by the low carbon solubility in copper.38

Like the synthesis of carbon nanotubes, how the synthesis conditions influence the controllable growth of graphene sheets also received extensive attentions. Chae et al. studied the influence of temperature, growth time and gas mixing ratio on the growth of fewer-layer graphene on poly-nickel substrate using CVD method. Their work showed that high temperature, short growth time and an optimal gas mixing ratio are crucial for high quality graphene synthesis.39 Reina et al. found that mainly large-area one- or two-layer graphene can be preferentially synthesized by controlling carbon source concentration and substrate cooling rate during CVD process.40
Our group introduced a template CVD method to realize the scalable synthesis of fewer layer graphene ribbons with controlled morphology (Fig. 3C).41 In our process, ZnS ribbons were used as both templates and catalysts for graphene sheets. Besides ZnS ribbons, many other materials can be used as templates for synthesizing graphene with various morphologies, whereas larger substrates can be used for further scale up.
The CVD method is a common method for the synthesis of doped carbon nanotubes.42 Our group also used the CVD method to synthesize N-doped graphene sheets, which are very hard to produce by other methods. Moreover, by substitutional doping, we found the N-doped graphene sheet showed n-type behavior, indicating the modulation of the electrical properties of graphene.43
Besides CVD method, arc-discharge method has also been used to produce graphene sheets. Rao et al. reported for the first time that the arc-discharge method can also be used for the synthesis of graphene sheets (Fig. 4).11,44 By using graphite rods as electrodes, they synthesized pure graphene with mainly 2–4 layers in the inner wall region of the arc chamber under relatively high pressure of hydrogen without any catalyst. Moreover, through this method, nitrogen-doped and boron-doped graphene sheets can also be easily synthesized with boron sources (B2H6) or nitrogen sources (pyridine) mixed into the hydrogen gas. However, the size and thickness of the pure graphene sheets still have room to improve, and the properties of N- and B-doped graphene sheets synthesized also need further studies. Since there is no catalyst used here, it is believed to be a potential synthesis method for graphene sheets.

4. The chemistry of graphene derived from carbon nanotubes

Graphene, as well as carbon nanotubes, has very wide potential applications in many areas like materials science and medicinal chemistry. However, their insolubility and difficult manipulation in any common organic solvents and aqueous solutions greatly limits their further applications. To solve this problem, the functionalization of carbon nanotubes and graphene is an alternative.45–50 Moreover, the electrical properties can also be modified by edge-functionalization, and hetero-atom doping, which is very important for their application in nanoelectronic devices.
4.1 Functionalization
For the functionalization of carbon nanotubes, there are mainly three cases.46,47 The first one is covalent interaction at the end groups or defects on carbon nanotubes. Though intrinsic carbon nanotubes are chemically stable, the both ends of carbon nanotubes, as well as the defects introduced in the process of growth, purification and dispersion, are more reactive with many chemicals compared with the side-wall of carbon nanotubes. The second one is non-covalent adsorption or wrapping around the side-wall of carbon nanotubes according to van der Waals forces or π–π stacking interaction. The last case is filling in the inner cavities of carbon nanotubes. Because the inner part of carbon nanotubes is empty, then molecules with the size smaller than the inner diameters can fill into the carbon nanotubes. Through the functionalization with different chemicals, water-soluble and organic-soluble CNTs dispersions can be both obtained for various further manipulation and applications.
The functionalization of carbon nanotubes has showed us a feasible direction for soluble graphene solutions. Graphene has nearly the same chemical properties as carbon nanotubes as their similar extended conjugated polyaromatic system. It can also be functionalized by covalent interaction with kinds of functional groups or noncovalent adsorption or wrapping through π–π stacking interaction. The difference is based on their different geometric structures. Graphene has a planar structure with edge dangling carbon atoms around it, which is chemically reactive as well as defects on the graphene surface. The covalent functionalization of graphene is preferentially occurred at the sites of edges and defects.50 The other difference is that both sides of graphene has the same reactivity, unlike the different reactivity of outer-wall and inner-wall for carbon nanotubes functionalization. This double side functional structure can lead to 3D organization structures for special applications (Fig. 5).49

Graphene can be regarded as an infinitely large aromatic molecule. Like carbon nanotubes, the perfect graphene is insoluble and chemically inert for many organic reagents. The covalent chemical functionalization of graphene mainly occurs at the defects like actively oxygenated groups caused in the process of synthesis or pretreatment. Graphene oxide (GO) can be easily prepared through exfoliation of graphite oxide. GO is water-soluble and also soluble in some organic solutions for further treatment or applications.48 GO can be easily reduced to produce graphene sheets through chemical reduction, thermal reduction, or electrochemical reduction. Due to its low-cost, large-scale, and easy-processing, the reduced graphene oxide has been widely applied in many fields. GO can be further functionalized through covalent reactions of various reagents with oxygenated groups as summarized in Fig. 6.

The covalent functionalization of graphene or graphene oxide can greatly improve their performance of solubility and processability. However, it will induce many defects which may also greatly decrease the intrinsic electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. Non-covalent functionalization of graphenevia π–π stacking or van der Waals interaction can completely keep the sp2 network structure of graphene. And the non-covalent interaction is often reversible. So it has received extensive attention in many areas, especially as chemical sensors and biomedical materials. Many organic solvents, surfactants and biomolecules, such as DNA, sodium cholate (SC), sodium deoxycholate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) etc., have been reported to encapsulate carbon nanotubes for dispersion and/or separation through non-covalent functionalization.51 These are also greatly utilized on the dispersion and separation of graphene for further applications.

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules are very important in the biomedical application of disperse and separate carbon nanotubes through π–π stacking involving the sidewall graphene structure of carbon nanotubes and the purine and pyrimidine bases of the DNA molecules.52,53 Mann et al. demonstrated that single-stranded DNA can also be used to prepare stable aqueous graphene suspensions for the first time (Fig. 7A). The concentration of this graphene/ssDNA aqueous dispersion can reach as high as 2.5 mg mL−1.54

Density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) is a very important method for separating carbon nanotubes with different diameters, lengths, wall numbers, and chiralities,55–58 where surfactants used to well disperse carbon nanotubes through non-covalent interaction are very important. Green and Hersam have applied this technology to the separation of graphene sheets with controlled thickness.59 They found the surfactant SC, which is commonly used for separation of carbon nanotubes in DGU process, is also a good alternative to produce stable graphene dispersions with graphene concentration of > 90 μg mL−1 (Fig. 7B). The subsequent DGU separations of SC-encapsulated graphene yield graphene sheets with controlled thickness as a function of their buoyant density. Coleman and co-workers produced stable graphene/SC aqueous dispersions with graphene concentrations up to 0.3 mg mL−1 while maintaining the quality of the graphene flakes by optimization of sonication time at low power and centrifugation conditions.60 This high concentration dispersion can be easily cast into free-standing films with good electrical and mechanical properties for further applications.
4.2 Doping
One important application of graphene is electronic devices, which require graphene with various electronic types. So, modulation of the electronic properties of graphene is very important. Doping through chemical absorption, edge functionalization, hetero-atom substitution and defects are effective routes to realize intentional tailoring of electronic properties.
Doping is a common approach to tailor the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes. After doping with nitrogen or boron atoms, carbon nanotubes become n-type or p-type, respectively. Doping can also alter the electrical properties of graphene.43 Martins et al. studied the electronic and transport properties of boron-doped graphene nanoribbons (GNR). With ab initio theoretical calculations, they demonstrated that the presence of boron atoms at GNR edges can lead to a metal-to-semiconductor transition. They also suggested that it is possible to tailor the electronic current along GNR by a suitable doping process.61 Gunlycke et al. reported that by using local-density-functional calculations zigzag-edge graphene nanoribbons terminated with various atoms or functional groups have a significant impact on the electronic structure of these nanoribbons near the Fermi level. Zigzag-edge nanoribbons terminated with hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl groups exhibit spin polarization in equilibrium, while the nanoribbons terminated with oxygen or imine groups are unpolarized, leading to very different low-bias transport properties.62 Ferrari and co-workers studied the atomic substitution and edge functionalization in graphene ribbons with well defined edges. Oxygen edge substitution and functionalization at high density in zigzag nanoribbons can produce semiconductor-metal transitions. And double-edge functionalization of zigzag ribbons can reduce the semiconducting gap. Nitrogen bulk substitution at 1.7 at% in zigzag ribbons makes them metallic. The gap of armchair ribbons is strongly against the edge functionalization and N or B edge substitutions. However, N, B, and pyridine-like bulk substitutions can cause semiconductor-to-metal transitions.63
As is known for p-doping of carbon nanotubes, the p-doping of GNR is readily achievable under ambient conditions by edge adsorption or functionalization of hydrogen, oxygen, hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups during the synthesis process.64 Liu and co-workers demonstrated the doping effect on GNRs by edge doping with nitrogen atoms to show an n-type transistor behavior.65 Dai and co-workers reported that graphene nanoribbons can be functionalized by nitrogen species by high-power electrical annealing (e-annealing) in NH3 and exhibit n-type electronic doping (Fig. 8).66 Our group also produced substitutionally nitrogen-doped graphene by CVD method and proved that graphene sheets with nitrogen-substitutional doping show an n-type behavior.43

5. Applications of graphene derived from carbon nanotubes
Due to their extraordinary electrical, mechanical, optical and thermal properties, carbon nanotubes have many potential applications such as flexible transparent conductive materials, field emission, field effect transistors, supercapacitors, sensors, catalyst supports, reinforced/conducting composites, biomedical applications and so on.67–69

Graphene has very similar broad applications to carbon nanotubes. Transparent conductive films made of CNTs have been widely studied for potential applications in touch panels, flexible displays and solar cellsetc.70–73 Through the filtration method that widely used in preparing CNTs films, Chhowalla and co-workers also produced flexible transparent conducting film using reduced graphene oxide (Fig. 9).74 Though the performance of sheet resistance and transparency for the graphene films is not good enough, it has enough room for improvement and will be an important potential application in thin film electronics.75

Carbon nanotubes are an attractive material for electrochemical energy storage devices like supercapacitors due to their chemical stability, low mass density, low resistivity, and large surface area.76 Since graphene also has these superb properties, Rao and co-workers used exfoliated graphene sheets to prepare a supercapacitor, and found that the specific capacitance of graphene can reach up to 117 F/g in aqueous H2SO4 solution which is higher than that of carbon nanotubes while the energy density is one of the highest values reported to date in ionic liquids.77
Since graphene and carbon nanotubes have the characteristics of very large mobilities and near-ballistic transport, they hold great promise for next-generation nanoelectronics instead of silicon.78 Dekker and co-workers fabricated the first CNT-based FET in 1998.79 In 2004, Fuhrer and co-workers reported that semiconducting SWNTs can show extraordinary field effect mobilities higher than 100,000 cm2 V−1s−1 at room temperature, which exceeded all known semiconductors.80 However, graphene's quality also clearly reveals itself in a pronounced ambipolar electric field effect such that charge carriers can be tuned continuously between electrons and holes in concentrations n as high as 1013 cm−2 and their mobilities μ can exceed 15,000 cm2 V−1s−1 even under ambient conditions, which can be further improved significantly, perhaps even up to ∼100,000 cm2 V−1s−1.1 Liu and co-workers demonstrated through extensive first-principles transport calculations that intrinsic semiconductor zigzag graphene ribbon field effect transistors can exhibit very high levels of performance similar to those made from single-walled carbon nanotubes, with an ON/OFF ratio up to 104, subthreshold swing as low as 60 meV per decade, and transconductance of 9.5 × 103 S m−1. Moreover, this performance can be generally improved by increasing channel length and/or decreasing channel width of the GNR-FETs.65 Han et al. and Chen et al. nearly at the same time fabricated GNR-based FETs by e-lithography and etching technology and found that the performance is significantly dependent on the ribbon width.23,81 Recently, Dai and co-workers developed a chemical route to produce graphene nanoribbons with widths below 10 nm and field effect transistors based on these sub-10 nm GNRs showed ON/OFF ratios as high as about 107 and on-state current density of ∼2000 μA μm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 10).82,83

SWNTs have been applied in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices as electron acceptors, which were demonstrated to significantly improve the photovoltaic effect of the poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) conjugated polymer based solar cells.84–86Graphene can also be used in OPV devices instead of carbon nanotubes. Chen and co-workers prepared organic BHJ PV devices using organic solution-processed functionalized graphene material as acceptor with P3HT and P3OT as electron donor. They can get a best power conversion efficiency of 1.4% under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G light illumination (Fig. 11).87

SWNTs can be used as chemical sensors based on the fact that the electrical resistance of a semiconducting SWNT can dramatically increase or decrease upon exposure to gas molecules like NO2 or NH3 at room temperature.88 Recently, Novoselov and co-workers found that graphene can also be used as gas sensors. They showed that graphene-based gas sensors allow the ultimate sensitivity such that individual gas molecules adsorption or desorption on graphene can be easily detected.89
Besides the gas sensors, Yang and co-workers demonstrated that the water-soluble graphene oxide can be applied as a platform for fast, sensitive, and selective detection of biomolecules like carbon nanotubes. Dye-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules can bind with GO and completely quench the fluorescence. The fluorescence of labeled dye will be recovered in the presence of a target to interact with the dye-labeled ssDNA as shown in Fig. 12.90

Biocompatible functionalized graphene and carbon nanotubes are also considered as promising biomedical materials. Dai and co-workers demonstrated that through functionalization of nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO) sheets by branched, biocompatible polyethylene glycol (PEG), insoluble aromatic anticancer drugs can successfully load onto NGO with strong non-covalent interaction via simple absorption.91 Further study showed that the anticancer drugs loaded onto NGO can selectively transport into specific cancer cells by antibody guided targeting and kill them in vitro (Fig. 13).92

Composite materials are also one of the most important applications for carbon nanotubes and graphene. Ruoff and co-workers studied graphene-based composite materials. The electrical properties of graphene-based composites made by their method are comparable to the best reported results for CNTs-polymer composites. The polystyrene-graphene composite formed by their method exhibited a percolation threshold of 0.1 vol.% for room-temperature electrical conductivity, which is the lowest value for any carbon-based composite except for those involving carbon nanotubes. And the composite has a conductivity of ∼0.1 S m−1 at only 1 vol.%, which is sufficient for many electrical applications. 93 Chen and co-workers firstly used graphene as an additive in PVA to prepare a mechanical reinforcement nanocomposite. By addition of only 0.7 wt% graphene oxide, they achieved a 76% increase in tensile strength as well as a 62% improvement of Young's modulus.94

        Graphene
nanoribbons from directly unzipping carbon nanotubes
With the development of graphene, the relationship between graphene and carbon nanotubes has received increasing attention, from the similarities of properties and research methods to the direct conversions. Tour and co-workers reported a simple and efficient method for producing graphene nanoribbons by longitudinally unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes with concentrated sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate treatment. This process is a solution-based chemical oxidation process. The obtained graphene nanoribbons are water-soluble or solution processable for further applications. However, the perfect graphene structure and properties of the nanoribbons are destroyed due to the heavy oxidation treatment. Besides, the length, width and thickness of nanoribbons have large distributions since the oxidation process is uncontrollable.95
At the same time, Dai and co-workers showed another approach to make graphene nanoribbons by unzipping carbon nanotubes through plasma etching. They also found that the width and thickness are both with narrow distributions and smaller than that for the chemical oxidation unzipping process. The nanoribbons with narrow width even behave weak semiconducting characteristic. The distributions of nanoribbon width and thickness can also be controllable due to the plasma etching time and the pristine carbon nanotubes samples.96
Vega-Cantú and co-workers also reported another longitudinally unzipping of carbon nanotubes process to make graphene nanoribbons. The graphene nanoribbons were obtained by lithium and ammonia intercalation into multi-walled carbon nanotubes followed by acid exfoliation and abrupt heating process.97 Beyond the above, metal nanoparticles used to cut through graphene sheets also have be used to unzip carbon nanotubes through the sidewall, as reported by Terrones and co-workers.98 All the above four routes to produce graphene ribbons through unzipping carbon nanotubes are summarized in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Schematic pictures of the four different routs to produce graphene ribbons through unzipping carbon nanotubes. Reproduced with permission from ref. 107, copyright 2009, Nature Publishing Group. 
Recently, Dai and co-workers have developed another facile unzipping method for producing high-quality graphene nanoribbons. Defect sites were introduced and etched on the sidewall of pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes by mildly air-oxidation process. A sonication process in an organic solvent was followed to unzip the MWNTs from the defect sites. Finally, an ultracentrifugation step was applied to remove nanotubes and nanoparticles. The whole yield of the nanoribbons can reach up to ∼2%. The ribbons are 10–20 nm in width, and the mobility can reach 1,500 cm2 V−1s−1. The nanoribbons are also solution processable for further applications.99

        Carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrid structures
Although graphene has many potential applications due to its fascinating properties, the synthesis of large-scale and high-quality graphene is hard to realize, which greatly hindered its further applications. However, through introducing CNTs, a hybrid structure of CNTs/graphene opens up a new road for further applications.
Song and co-workers fabricated conductive CNT films with graphite oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) as carriers.100 They used exfoliated hydroxyl group functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-OH) and exfoliated graphite oxide nanoplatelets prepared from expandable graphite by the Hummers method to prepare highly conductive carbon hybrid films and found that the square resistance could be reduced to 10−4 Ω sq−1 with ca. 60 wt% content of CNTs. Yang and co-workers reported a solution-based method (Fig. 15A) to prepare carbon nanotubes/chemical converted graphene (CNTs/CCG) hybrid materials with sheet resistance 240 Ω sq−1 at 86% transmittance after chemical doping, which is comparable to the performance of ITO. This technology was thought to be facile, inexpensive, scalable, and compatible with flexible substrates. A proof-of-concept application in a polymer solar cell is also demonstrated with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.85%.101 Kim and Min used a self-assembly process (Fig. 15B) to prepare a uniform large-area ultrathin transparent film composed of graphene/CNTs double layers. The assembly of aminated MWNTs onto GO film via electrostatic interactions had little effect on the transparency while greatly decreased the sheet resistance after reduction and annealing. Moreover, the graphene/CNTs double-layered structure also showed excellent adhesion strength, which is very important for various practical applications.102 Shin and co-workers developed a layer by layer (LbL) assembly method (Fig. 15C) to prepare RGO/CNTs hybrid multilayer with excellent control over the optical and electrical properties. A transparent, flexible conducting thin films with a sheet resistance of 8 kΩ sq−1 with a transmittance of 81% had been realized.103

Zhu and co-workers developed a solid-phase layer-stacking method (Fig. 16A) to prepare a graphene/CNTs film. The graphene layer was directly prepared through CVD method while the CNTs layer was stacked onto graphene layer with ethanol wetting. In contrast to the solution processing method, the solid-phase processing approach could maintain the structural integrity and continuity of both components and preserve their intrinsic electrical and mechanical properties (Fig. 16C). They also found that the introduction of CNTs into graphene films considerably decreased the sheet resistance while caused little effect on the transparency of the films. A sheet resistance of 735 Ω sq−1 at 90% transmittance (at 550 nm) was obtained. Moreover, a heterojunction solar cell was made from the graphene/CNTs composite film and n-Si and showed a conversion efficiency of up to 5.2% under AM1.5 illumination.104 Kim and co-workers firstly deposited a layer of graphene oxide platelets, and then patterned with catalytical metal particles onto it, followed with high temperature growth of vertical CNTs arrays attached onto the graphene reduced from the graphene oxide plateletsvia high temperature in the CVD process (Fig. 16B). This hybrid film showed high temperature stability and mechanical compliance as well as exhibited excellent field emission performance.105 Choi and co-workers used vertical CNTs/RGO hybrid films to further fabricate a flexible room temperature NO2 gas sensor (Fig. 16D and E), which showed very high performance without optimization of each component. In comparison with the reduced graphene films, vertical CNTs/RGO hybrid films showed remarkably enhanced sensitivity.106

8. Summary and outlook
To recognize carbon nanotubes, we have considered carbon nanotubes as rolled graphene sheets. However, the knowledge of carbon nanotubes has promoted rapid developments in the study of graphene. In this feature article, we have firstly introduced the electronic structures of graphene and carbon nanotubes and their relationship. Then controllable synthesis of graphene sheets through the two most common synthesis methods used for carbon nanotubes – CVD and arc-discharge methods – has been reviewed. After the synthesis process, graphene sheets need pretreatment or functionalization for special applications. Then we reviewed the chemistry of graphene and graphene oxide based on the similarities to carbon nanotubes. The dispersion and doping are the most important topics since they are critical steps for further applications. The applications of graphene instead of carbon nanotubes in nanoelectronics, biomedicine, composites, and so on, are also simply introduced in the third part. At the last part, the direct unzipping of carbon nanotubes to produce graphene nanoribbons and CNTs/graphene hybrid are reviewed.
With the research achievements of carbon nanotubes as references, graphene has had a significant development in the short period of six years. However, there are still many challenges and opportunities. Controllable synthesis of graphene for special applications is always a hot topic.108 Among all synthesis methods, CVD method and unzipping of carbon nanotubes are the two most promising routes. However, limited by the size of substrate, scalability and large-area synthesis is hard to realize under low costs by CVD method, while sub-5 nm graphene ribbons for high-performance transistors are still big challenges through unzipping of carbon nanotubes. The functionalization of graphene for solution processing often starts from graphene oxide and causes some damage which decreases the performances in applications. And the applications of graphene are just at the initial stage. There is still enough room to improve the performance and to find more and more application fields. Moreover, with the development of graphene, some methods used for graphene studies may also be suitable for carbon nanotubes and promote the development of carbon nanotubes and graphene with each other.
