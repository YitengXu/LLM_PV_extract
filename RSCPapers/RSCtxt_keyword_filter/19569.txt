    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractChalcogenide perovskites have recently attracted enormous attention since they show promising optoelectronic properties and high stability for photovoltaic applications. Herein, the relative stability and photoactive properties of chalcogenide perovskites AZrX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se) including the needle-like (α phase) and distorted perovskite (β phase) structures are first revealed. The results show that the difference in the relative stability is large between the α and β phases for both AZrS3 and AZrSe3. The fundamental direct-gap transition is only allowed for the β phase, which is further confirmed by its optical properties. It is indicated that the suitable direct-gap energy of the α phase is not desirable for thin-film solar cells. Therefore, the stability, and mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of the distorted chalcogenide perovskites AZrS3−xSex (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) are mainly explored for the first time. The predicted direct band gaps of nine compounds AZrS3−xSex (x = 1–3) are in the ideal range of 1.3–1.7 eV. Most compounds have small effective masses, low exciton binding energies, and high optical absorption coefficients in the visible region. Moreover, the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stabilities are identified for these compounds. Our findings suggest that CaZrSe3, SrZrSe3, and BaZrSe3 are proposed to be the most promising candidates for photovoltaic applications owing to their promising properties.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead-based halide perovskites represent a major breakthrough in the development of solar-cell materials over the past ten years,1–4 and these materials have attracted considerable attention since the initial report was presented by Kojima et al. in 2009.5 The highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached up to 25.6% in 2022 for single-junction solar cells.6 However, the high efficiency solar cells are still based on lead-based halide perovskites, and these materials also suffer from intrinsic instability, which severely hinders their large-scale commercial application in the future.7,8
Chalcogenide perovskites have also gained great interest in recent years due to their high stability,9 strong absorption coefficients,10 sufficient defect tolerance,11 and promising electronic properties.12 Such materials possess the same chemical formula ABX3 like typical three-dimensional halide perovskites, where A is usually an alkali-earth metal cation (A = Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+), B is mainly a tetravalent transition metal cation (B = Zr4+ and Hf4+), and X is a chalcogen anion (X = S2− and Se2−). Two key phases have been known for chalcogenide perovskites at ambient temperature: one is a distorted orthorhombic structure with the space group Pnma, and another is a needle-like orthorhombic phase. Some chalcogenide perovskites have been synthesized experimentally, such as CaZrS3, SrZrS3, BaZrS3, CaHfS3, SrHfS3, and BaHfS3, which show a distorted perovskite phase,13 while SrZrS3, SrZrSe3, and SrHfSe3 exist in a needle-like phase.14–16 It should be noted that both phases are stable for SrZrS3 under ambient conditions.14 It is interesting that BaZrSe3 is actually a hexagonal phase with the space group P63/mmc, as reported in the Materials Project database.17 It was verified that the experimental optical gap energy of BaZrS3 is lower than those of CaZrS3 and SrZrS3.10,18 The experimental band gap of BaZrS3 is between 1.70 and 1.85 eV,10,18–20 which is more suitable for tandem solar cells. BaZrS3 is still identified to be the most potential candidate for photovoltaic applications owing to its lower band gap.21 The incorporation of Ti at low concentrations (∼4–6%) into BaZrS3 is an effective strategy for reducing the band gap to achieve the maximum efficiency.19,20,22 However, it is found to destabilize the phase stability of BaZrS3 when the concentration of alloying Ti is higher.19 Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that Se-alloying is another choice for decreasing the band gap of BaZrS3.22,23 Higher theoretical efficiency can be obtained for BaZrS3 by Ti or Se alloying.24,25 The optical absorption of BaZrS3 can be improved by optimizing the experimental conditions.26 In addition, theoretical prediction is applied to reveal the defect tolerance, and mechanical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of BaZrS3.11,27–29 BaZrSe3 is predicted to be a stable promising material for solar cell applications.30 The pressure-induced impact on the electronic and optical properties of AZrS3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) was been studied by Arnab et al.31 and their excitonic properties were further explored.32 A detailed theoretical study was recently carried out to investigate the effect of temperature on the band gap of SrZrS3.33 The fundamental lattice transport properties of CaZrSe3 have been probed by employing first-principles calculations.34
Halide perovskites are usually composed of earth-abundant elements and can be synthesized by common low-cost methods.35–37 However, the synthesis conditions required for most chalcogenide perovskites are high temperatures (about 1000 °C) and reaction times that can range from days to weeks.9,38 At present, the key challenge is to achieve the desired high-quality thin films through appropriate technical strategies.39 This explains the fact that the PCE has rarely been experimentally reported for chalcogenides. Recently, a solution-based synthesis route has been developed for BaZrS3 at low temperatures (∼300–600 °C).40–42 Moreover, this approach was also extended to other chalcogenides, such as BaTiS3 and BaHfS3.40 This is a crucial step for applications of chalcogenide perovskites in optoelectronic devices.
According to the reported literature, most experimental and theoretical works mainly focused on the structure and optoelectronic properties of BaZrS3,11,18–20,22,28,29,40,41 and some theoretical computations were conducted to study the stability and properties of AB(S/Se)3, such as CaZrS3,43 SrZrS3,33 CaZrSe3,12,34 BaZrSe3,30 CaHfSe3,12 and SrHfSe3.16 To date, few experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to examine the fundamental physical properties of different phases of Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites AZrS3−xSex (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; x = 0, 1, 2, 3). In this work, several important issues are solved, which is helpful to gain in-depth understanding of the relationship between the structure and properties of these materials, and disclose some potential candidates for solar cell applications. First, it is only photo-active for the distorted perovskite structure, which is confirmed by our current results. In other words, even though the needle-like phase has an optimum direct band gap, it is not suitable for thin-film solar cells. Second, the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stabilities of the distorted chalcogenides AZrS3−xSex (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; x = 1, 2, 3) are identified for the first time. Finally, the electronic and optical properties of these materials are discussed in detail, and the results imply that they have suitable direct band gaps (1.3–1.7 eV), small effective masses, low exciton binding energies, and high optical absorption coefficients. These excellent optoelectronic properties lead to significant photovoltaic applications of Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites.
2. Computational methods and details
The projector augmented-wave (PAW)44 method was implemented in the Vienna ab initio package (VASP)45 to perform all calculations. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)46 was used for structural optimization and elastic properties. The kinetic cutoff energy of 600 eV was adopted. The convergence criterion for the total energy was set to 10−6 eV, and the structure was fully relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 10−2 eV Å−1. The 5 × 11 × 3 and 7 × 6 × 7 k-point grids were used for the needle-like and distorted perovskite phases, respectively. The electronic and optical properties of the distorted perovskite structures were calculated by employing the 4 × 3 × 4 k-point grid when the hybrid functional HSE0647 was applied. The HSE06 functional contained the 75% PBE exchange and 25% Hartree–Fock exchange. Based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT),48 dynamic stability was evaluated by calculating the phonon dispersion curves with the help of the PHONOPY code when a conventional cell was used with the 7 × 6 × 7 k-point grid. The frequency dependent optical absorption coefficient α(ω) can be deduced by equation ,49 where ω is the photon frequency and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The electronic, optical, and elastic properties were post-processed using VASPKIT50 and the optimized crystal structure was visualized by VESTA.51
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
It is well known that SrZrS3 is crystallized in the two orthorhombic phases with the same space group Pnma: one is a needle-like structure (α phase) and another is a distorted perovskite structure (β phase).14 The alloy compound Sr1−xBaxZrSe3 (x ≤ 0.68) adopts the α phase at 293 K.15 Although both α and β phases have the same orthorhombic symmetry, their structures are significantly different from each other. For instance, the coordination number of the B-site cation is still 6 for the α phase, but the coordination number of the A-site cation is reduced from 12 to 9, which indicates that the key properties of the perovskite structure are lacking.12 It is observed from the analysis of the powder neutron diffraction that the β phase is considered to present a distorted perovskite structure.13 It is actually that CaZrS3 and BaZrS3 form the β phase at room temperature.13 The crystal structures of CaZrSe3 and BaZrSe3 have not been experimentally reported so far. Therefore, it is of great interest to predict the more stable crystal structure for CaZrSe3 and BaZrSe3. Meanwhile, it is crucial to explore the relative stability of the α and β phases for AZrX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). The relative stability of the α and β phases for each compound is evaluated by comparing their total energy differences. The total energy difference between the α and β phases for AZrS3 and AZrSe3 is presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the difference in energy is negligible for the α and β phases of SrZrS3, so it has two stable crystal structures. For both CaZrS3 and BaZrS3, the β phase has a lower total energy, showing that the more stable structure is the β phase. It is concluded that it tends to form the β phase for CaZrSe3, while it prefers to adopt the α phase for both SrZrSe3 and BaZrSe3. The results of our current study are basically consistent with the experimental conclusions.13–15 The α and β phases are theoretically proven to be dynamically stable for BaZrSe3 and CaZrSe3, respectively.30,34 In addition, the Goldschmidt's tolerance factor t is also used to determine the stability of both AZrS3 and AZrSe3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba),52,53 where RA and RB are the ionic radii of A2+ and B4+ cations, respectively, and RX is the ionic radius of chalcogen anion X2−. It can be seen from Table S1 (ESI†) that the t values of all compounds are in the range of 0.870 to 0.953, implying that a cubic or distorted perovskite structure may be adopted for Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites. It is verified experimentally that it prefers to form the distorted perovskite structure for most chalcogenides.13 Alexander et al. have recently reported a modified tolerance factor to analyze the phase stability of chalcogenide perovskites and further explore potential optoelectronic materials.54

In the present study, various physical properties are mainly simulated and discussed for the β phase of AZrS3 and AZrSe3. The calculated structural parameters are listed in Table 1. The simulated structural parameters of AZrS3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) deviate from the previous experimental data by 1.12%, 0.78%, 0.69%, and 2.73% for a, b, c, and V, respectively. These results imply that our calculated data are well consistent with the experimental values.13 To our knowledge, the experimental lattice constants of CaZrSe3, SrZrSe3, and BaZrSe3 are still unknown. The β phase is considered for AZrS2Se/AZrSSe2 to further explore their fundamental physical properties. The possible configurations are considered for AZrS2Se and AZrSSe2, and the dynamically stable structure is finally selected. It is noted that both AZrS2Se and AZrSSe2 still adopt an orthorhombic structure. The geometry structure of AZrS3−xSex (x = 0–3) is depicted in Fig. 2.

The effect of Se alloying on the lattice constants of AZrS3 is illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Similar variation curves are observed for three alloying systems. It is found that AZrS3 (AZrSe3) and AZrS2Se (AZrSSe2) have the same values for a, while AZrS3 (AZrSe3) and AZrSSe2 (AZrS2Se) have almost the same values for b. The lattice constant value of c is generally increased for AZrS3−xSex as a function of x. The lattice constants are greatly increased from AZrS3 to AZrSe3 because Se2+ has a larger ionic radius. In addition, the lattice constants are increased due to the substitution of Ca with Sr or Ba.
3.2 Nature of electronic transition
According to the previous experimental and theoretical reports, some chalcogenides in the α phase (such as SrZrS3,10 BaZrSe3,30 and SrHfSe316) show more suitable band gaps (1.0–1.5 eV), which are identified to be promising materials for solar energy conversion. However, it is indicated from another theoretical study that those materials with the α phase are not suitable for thin-film solar cells.12 Therefore, this makes it very necessary to verify the optoelectronic activity of such materials. The electronic transition probability between the upper valence band and the lower conduction band can be theoretically revealed by computing the transition matrix elements.55 We choose the cases of α-CaZrX3 and β-CaZrX3 (X = S, Se) as examples to explore their a direct transition probabilities, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results indicate that the direct transition is forbidden at the Γ point for α-CaZrS3 and α-CaZrSe3. In contrast, direct transition is allowed at the Γ point for β-CaZrS3 and β-CaZrSe3. It is noted that both α-CaZrS3 and α-CaZrSe3 have direct allowed band gaps at the Z point, which are ∼0.2 eV larger than their direct forbidden band gaps at the Γ point. It is concluded that α-AZrX3 shows an inferior optical absorption than that β-AZrX3 when they have similar band gaps. The present results suggest that α-AZrX3 is not a promising material for solar cells, which is further confirmed by its optical properties. Therefore, we mainly focus on the optoelectronic properties of β-AZrX3 in the current work.
3.3 Band structures and density of states
The bandgap parameter is an important index for exploring potential candidates in the field of solar cell applications. To correctly predict the electronic properties of Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites, the hybrid functional HSE06 is applied without including the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect. It was reported for such compounds that the band gap reduction is ∼0.1 eV due to the SOC effect.12 The band gap differences between the α and β phases of AZrX3 are firstly explored in Fig. 3(a). The band gap of the β phase is always larger than that of the α phase, which is also observed in the previous literature.12 The band gap difference between the α and β phases is obvious for both CaZrX3 and SrZrX3, while this variation is relatively small for BaZrX3. For the α phase, both SrZrS3 and SrZrSe3 have the smallest band gaps compared to other analogues. For the β phase, the same band gap is disclosed for both CaZrS3 and SrZrS3 while the band gap of BaZrS3 is slightly decreased. It is interesting that it shows the largest band gap for the β phase of SrZrSe3, and BaZrSe3 has the lowest band gap. The results imply that the effects of different phases on the band structures of Zr-based chalcogenides are remarkable.
 Fig. 3  (a) The band gap values of the α and β phases of AZrX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se) and (b) the band gap variation of β-AZrS3−xSex as a function of x. 
The trend of band gap variation is presented in Fig. 3(b) for β-AZrS3−xSex as a function of x. Fig. 4 shows the band structures of β-AZrS3−xSex with the distorted perovskite structure. The direct band gap features are observed at the Γ point for all compounds. It is revealed that the direct band gap reduction occurred from AZrS3 to AZrSe3. The predicted band gap of AZrS3 varies from 1.79 to 1.99 eV, which is in the ideal range for tandem solar cells. The wide band gap is narrowed to the desirable range through the element-mixing strategy. Such strategy has been used for halide perovskites to tune the band gap and improve the stability in the past years.56–59 The predicted band gap values are 1.98–1.40 eV for CAZrS3−xSex, 1.99–1.46 eV for SrZrS3−xSex, and 1.79–1.34 eV for BAZrS3−xSex, respectively. The band gap reduction is about 0.4–0.6 eV for AZrS3 to AZrSe3. The band gaps of SrZrS3 and BaZrS3 are reduced to between 1.5 and 1.6 eV when the applied pressure is 15 GPa, while the band gap reduction is only 0.2 eV for CaZrS3 under the same pressure conditions.31 The wide direct band gap of BaZrS3 is rapidly decreased by doping a small concentration of Ti.19,20,22,23 The direct band gap of AZrS3−xSex (x = 1, 2, 3) is located between 1.34 and 1.66 eV, which is more suitable for single-junction solar cells. For example, the band gaps of CaZrS2Se (1.66 eV) and SrZrS2Se (1.66 eV) are close to the experimental band energy of CsPbI3.60,61 The band gaps of CaZrSSe2 (1.52 eV), SrZrSSe2 (1.58 eV), BaZrS2Se (1.55 eV), and BaZrSSe2 (1.51 eV) are comparable with that of CH3NH3PbI3.61 Three selenium compounds CaZrSe3 (1.40 eV), SrZrSe3 (1.46 eV), and BaZrSe3 (1.34 eV) are potential candidates for photovoltaic applications. Importantly, BaZrSe3 is predicted to be the most promising material for achieving the maximum theoretical efficiency (∼34%) according to the Shockley–Queisser limit.62

The calculated direct band gap values for β-AZrX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se) are compared in detail with the available theoretical and experimental data. The experimental optical band energy of CaZrS3 is reported to be 1.90 eV,18 which matches well with our theoretical value of 1.98 eV. The band gap energy in the experiment is estimated to be about 2.05 eV,10 which is in good agreement with this theoretical prediction of 1.99 eV. The calculated band gap of BaZrS3 is shown to be 1.79 eV, which is in close agreement with the experimentally obtained band gap of 1.70–1.85 eV.10,18–20,63 Moreover, the predicted band gaps of CaZrS3, SrZrS3, and BaZrS3 are also well consistent with the previous theoretical data.12,22,31,32,43,64 When the PBE functional is used, the computed band gaps are 1.18 eV for CaZrS3, 1.17 eV for SrZrS3, and 1.02 eV for BaZrS3, which are significantly lower than the reported experimental values.10,18,19 It is clear that the band gap of AZrS3 is reasonably corrected by the hybrid functional HSE06. The results also confirm the reliability of our computational approach for predicting the band gaps of chalcogenide perovskites. To our knowledge, there are no experimental band gaps reported for AZrSe3 in the literature. Furthermore, the calculated band gaps of CaZrSe3, SrZrSe3, and BaZrSe3 can agree well with the recent theoretical values.12,65 The accurate theoretical band gaps of AZrS2Se and AZrSSe2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) are presented for the first time in this study.
To gain further understanding of these most promising compounds, the partial density of states (PDOS) of twelve compounds are computed and shown in Fig. 5. The electronic features are very similar among the three studied systems. The case of CAZrS3−xSex as an example is elaborated in detail. In CaZrS3, the top of the valence band is mostly contributed by the S-3p orbitals, while the bottom of the conduction band is predominantly contributed by the Zr-4d orbitals. The contributions of the Ca-4s and Ca-3d orbitals are little for the band edges. The electronic characteristics are varied in the upper valence bands when the partial substitution of S with Se is used. For instance, the top of the valence band is contributed together by the S-3p and Se-4p orbitals in CaZrS2Se, whereas the top of the valence band is mainly contributed by the Se-4p orbitals with some minor contribution from the S-3p orbitals. For CaZrSe3, the top of the valence band is contributed by the majority of Se-4p orbitals, and the bottom of the conduction band is still largely contributed by the Zr-4d orbitals. These electronic features explain well that the band gap of AZrS3−xSex is less changed by the substitution of Ca with Sr or Ba. The band gap variation of AZrS3−xSex is mainly derived from the bond length variation of Zr–S or Zr–Se due to the substitution of Ca with Sr or Ba.
 Fig. 5  The PDOS diagrams of (a–d) CAZrS3−xSex, (e–h) SrZrS3−xSex, and (i–l) BAZrS3−xSex. 
The Bader charges of various atoms are analyzed for β-AZrX3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se) in Table 2. The formal theoretical charges are +2, +4, and −2 for A, Zr, and X atoms, respectively. It is clear that the charges are transferred from A and Zr to X. The charge transfer from A2+ to [ZrX3]2− is about 1.5e, implying that the electron is localized in the [ZrX3]2− octahedron. The weak interaction between A2+ and X2− can further promote the charge transfer process of Zr4+–X2−. Due to the covalent bond of Zr–X, thus the electron of X2− is delocalized toward Zr4+. The ionic bond characteristic is determined by the amount of charge transfer between A2+ and X2−. In addition, the amount of charge transfer between A2+ and [ZrX3]2− is slightly reduced by the replacement of S with Se. In addition, it is also observed from the PDOS in Fig. 5 that the S-3p (Se-4p) and Zr-4d orbitals provide the main contributions to the VBM and CBM, while the contribution of the A-site cations to the VBM and CBM is negligible. The electronic transitions occurred from the S-3p (Se-4p) orbitals in the VBM to the Zr-4d orbitals in the CBM. These results imply that the bond nature of Zr–X is mainly covalent, which is consistent with Bader analysis.

3.4 Carrier mobility
The carrier mobility is another key factor for achieving high efficiency of solar-cell materials. To evaluate the carrier mobility, the effective masses of electrons and holes are computed for Zr-based distorted chalcogenides by using the formula .66Table 3 lists the effective masses (m*) of electrons  and holes  in the Γ → Z direction. The value of  is always slightly smaller than that of . The difference between  and  is relatively large for SrZrSSe2, BaZrS3, BaZrSSe2, and BaZrSe3. The behavior of high electron mobility is observed. In addition, the exciton binding energy (Eb) is also an important index for thin-film solar cells. The value of Eb is derived from the following relation:67 (1)

where , m0, and ε are the reduced effective mass , static electron mass, and static dielectric constant, respectively. It can be seen from Table 3 that the value of Eb is reduced in general for AZrS3−xSex as a function of x. The value of Eb is less than 100 meV for all compounds. Most chalcogenides have small  and low Eb, which is conducive to photovoltaic applications.
3.5 Optical properties
The optical absorption spectrum of a material is another key feature for solar cells because the desirable absorption in the visible region is not guaranteed by the appearance of an optimal direct bandgap. The computed optical absorption spectra of α-AZrS3 and β-AZrSe3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) are displayed in Fig. 6(a). It is clearly observed that the optical absorption curves are similar for α-AZrS3 (β-AZrSe3) because they possess similar electronic structures. According to our current calculations, the band gap difference between α-AZrS3 and β-AZrSe3 is less than 0.1 eV, but the optical absorption intensity of α-AZrS3 is significantly lower than that of β-AZrSe3. The optical absorption coefficient of β-AZrSe3 increases when the photon energy is larger than its fundamental band gap. The highest optical absorption coefficient is close to 6 × 105 cm−1 for β-AZrSe3. In contrast, the onset of the optical absorption is greatly higher than its direct band gap in α-AZrS3. The narrower and lower absorption coefficient is revealed in the visible range for α-AZrS3. The absorption behavior of α-AZrS3 is analogous to Si with an indirect band gap, as reported in the previous literature.12 In other words, even though α-AZrS3 has an ideal direct band gap, such a material is not suitable for thin-film solar cells. β-AZrSe3 shows the optimal band gap and high optical absorption intensity, which is identified to be a potential solar cell material. This explains the fact that the stability, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties of β-AZrS3−xSex are mainly studied in the present work.
 Fig. 6  (a) The computed optical absorption spectra of α-AZrS3 and β-AZrSe3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba). The position of the direct band gap is marked by the corresponding arrow. (b) The simulated absorption spectra of AZrS3−xSex (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) with a range of 300–800 nm. 
The simulated optical absorption spectra of CAZrS3−xSex, SrZrS3−xSex, and BAZrS3−xSex are shown in Fig. 6(b). The absorption spectra are similar to each other for three studied systems. The absorption curve is obviously red-shifted for AZrS3−xSex as a function of x owing to the bandgap reduction, which results in higher absorption at 500 to 800 nm. These characteristics of the absorption spectra are consistent with the features of their corresponding direct bandgaps. The maximum absorption coefficient is close to 7 × 105 cm−1 near 320 nm. CaZrSe3, SrZrSe3, and BaZrSe3 are identified to be promising materials for thin-film solar cells due to their excellent optical properties.
3.6 Elastic properties
To our knowledge, the elastic properties of chalcogenides AZrS3−xSex are less studied in the literature even though they have enormous potential for applications in solar cells. The elastic properties can provide important information for understanding the mechanical behavior of a material. The nine independent elastic constants can adequately represent the elastic tensor Cij of an orthorhombic phase. The orthorhombic crystal is predicted to be mechanically stable when the following six Born stability conditions are well satisfied:68 (2)The obtained elastic constant values of all compounds are listed in Table 4. All compounds are found to be mechanically stable because the computed elastic constants of each compound are consistent with the above stability conditions. It is well known that C11, C22, and C33 show resistance to the deformation of crystals under compression along with the x, y, and z directions, respectively.69,70 The results suggest that these materials have a strong resistance to the deformation in the x, y, and z directions because of their higher elastic constants. The various elastic constant values are similar for CAZrS3−xSex and SrZrS3−xSex except for C11. The elastic behavior of BAZrS3−xSex is slightly different from other two analogues. The effect of structural composition on the elastic constants of AZrS3−xSex is appropriately limited. It has a crucial impact on the mechanical properties of halide perovskites when some factors such as phase transition and structural dimensionality are taken into account.71

More mechanical parameters including the bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (Y), and Poisson's ratio (ν) can be gained through the Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approximation in the literature.72–74 The values of B, G, and Y slightly decreased from AZrS3 to AZrSe3. It has the highest Young's modulus (87–93 GPa) for CaZrS3, SrZrS3, and BaZrS3, indicating that they are the stiffest materials. In addition, the brittle or ductile feature of solids is usually evaluated by two key parameters Pugh's ratio B/G and Poisson's ratio ν. If the values of Pugh's ratio and Poisson's ratio are less than 1.75 and 0.26, then this solid is brittle, otherwise, it is ductile.75,76 According to the above criterion, all compounds are ductile.
3.7 Thermodynamic and dynamic stability
For commercial applications of potential semiconductor materials, it is necessary to study their thermodynamic stability. Thermodynamic stability is often reflected by the ability of a material to remain stable as it decomposes. To further evaluate the thermodynamic stability of these distorted Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites, the formation energy (ΔH) calculations are performed by the following four decomposition paths: ΔH1 = E(AZrS3) − E(AS) − E(ZrS2)(3) ΔH2 = E(AZrS2Se) − E(ASe) − E(ZrS2)(4) ΔH3 = E(AZrSSe2) − E(AS) − E(ZrS2)(5) ΔH4 = E(AZrSe3) − E(ASe) − E(ZrSe2)(6)where E(AS), E(ASe), E(ZrS2), and E(ZrSe2) are the total energies of AS, ASe, ZrS2, and ZrSe2 in the bulk as the same calculations are used. The most experimentally stable binary compounds (such as AS, ASe, ZrS2, and ZrSe2) are chosen from the Materials Project database as the reference ground states with space group: AS (Fmm), ASe (Fmm), ZrS2 (Pm1), and ZrSe2 (Pm1).17 A larger negative value of ΔH implies that this compound is relatively more stable. The calculated ΔH values of all twelve compounds are shown in Fig. 7. It is observed that the AZrS3 compound is marginally stable due to its relatively small positive or negative value. In other words, the long-term stability may be poor for the AZrS3 compound. It is mentioned that all calculations are performed at 0 K, thus the AZrS3 compound can still be synthesized experimentally under appropriate conditions. The stability of AZrS3 can be significantly improved by the substitution of S with Se. In other words, the compound AZrS3−xSex can be synthesized under the appropriate experimental conditions. Furthermore, when the radius of the alkaline-earth metal cation increases, the stability is also slightly enhanced. It is noted that the stability of AZrSSe2 is slightly lower than that of AZrS2Se. In the previous theoretical study,77 the results imply that selenides are much easier to synthesize than sulfides.

Dynamic stability is an important index for semiconductor materials since it is associated with the phonon modes. The phonon instability of materials is usually associated with some imaginary frequencies in the low frequency region of the phonon spectrum. The experimental crystal structures have been reported for three compounds AZrS3, thus dynamic stability is mainly highlighted for β-AZrS3−xSex (x = 1, 2, 3) in the present work. The phonon dispersion curves of nine compounds are demonstrated in Fig. 8. The compound AZrS3−xSex has four unit cells (20 atoms), thus it has a total of 60 phonon modes. Only three acoustic branches are observed for each compound. The absence of imaginary frequencies indicates that dynamic stability of these compounds is identified. In addition, it is verified from the recent theoretical report that AZrS3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) is dynamically stable at ambient pressure.31 It is revealed that the value of the highest optical frequency is significantly reduced from AZrS2Se to AZrSe3.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a comprehensive theoretical study is conducted to explore the structural stability, and elastic, electronic, and optical properties of Zr-based chalcogenide perovskites AZrS3−xSex (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; x = 0, 1, 2, 3). The relative stability is first studied for the α and β phases for AZrS3 and AZrSe3 by comparing their total energies. The results suggest that the stability difference in the α and β phases is different for AZr(S/Se)3. The obtained lattice constants of β-AZrS3 βA = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are well consistent with the experimental data. It is clear for both AZrS3 and AZrSe3 that the band gap of the α phase is always lower than that of the β phase. It is found that the fundamental direct band gap transition is allowed only for the β phase, so it is a photo-active material, which is further confirmed by its optical properties. This well explains the fact that the stability and optoelectronic properties of chalcogenides in the β phase are mainly investigated in the present work. The band gap reduction is revealed from β-AZrS3 to β-AZrSe3. The predicted band gaps of three β-AZrS3 are in close agreement with the experimental data, which also verify the reliability of our computational method. Nine compounds β-AZrS3−xSex (x = 1–3) are potential candidates for single-junction solar cells because they have suitable direct band gaps (1.3–1.7 eV). The features of small effective masses and low exciton binding energy are observed for most chalcogenides. Moreover, the absorption curve is obviously red-shifted for AZrS3−xSex as a function of x owing to the bandgap reduction, and they show high optical absorption coefficients in the visible region. Importantly, the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stabilities of β-AZrS3−xSex (x = 1, 2, 3) are proved for the first time. Our study suggests that β-CaZrSe3, β-SrZrSe3, and β-BaZrSe3 are identified to be the most promising materials for thin-film solar cells due to their excellent optoelectronic properties.
