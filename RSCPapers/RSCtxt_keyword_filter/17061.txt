    , Accepted 27th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractDespite the substantial increase in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), access to organic photoactive materials still remains cumbersome and, hence, relatively high cost in terms of synthesis and purification. In this work, we report, for the first time, the pot- and atom-economic synthesis of oligomerized unfused non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) via C–H direct arylation (DACH) with gradually increasing chain lengths, i.e., IDB-IC-n and IDBF-IC-n (n = 1–3). These oligomeric NFAs have varied conjugation lengths but the same backbones of alternating indacenodithiophene and benzothiadiazole or difluorobenzothiadiazole. Note that IDB-IC-3 and IDBF-IC-3 have the longest conjugation lengths ever reported among oligomeric NFAs. Systematic studies of structure–property–performance relationships revealed that IDBF-IC-1 achieves the best PCE of 12.12%, accompanied by a decrease in the PCE with an increase in the oligomeric chain length. Our results demonstrate that the opto-electronic properties can be fine-tuned via varying the conjugation length or introducing fluoridated building units. Meanwhile, the highly efficient DACH reaction combined with the pot-economic strategy developed here could be a promising candidate for the synthesis of conjugated oligomers for future OSC applications.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention as promising candidates for the next generation of sustainable energy by fabricating semi-transparent, lightweight, low-cost, and flexible devices through solution processing.1–3 Over the past five years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with low-bandgap,4–10 improved charge transfer and adjustable crystallinity, leading to remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 18%.11 Most efficient NFAs, such as derivatives of ITIC and Y6,4,6 are characterized by multi-heterocyclic fused-ring units.12–14 However, tedious synthesis, the use of organo-tin precursors, and multi-step purification are often needed. In recent years, unfused electron acceptors, featuring simpler structures and easier synthesis, have attracted much attention.15–22 The introduction of a locked geometry through intramolecular noncovalent interactions ensures an extended degree of effective conjugation and π-electron delocalization, as well as endowing a coplanar backbone to facilitate intermolecular π–π stacking to improve charge carrier mobility.23,24
Monodisperse conjugated oligomers (MCOs), as a bridge between small molecules and polymers, are expected to combine the advantages of both molecular and polymeric materials while overcoming their respective shortcomings.25 Moreover, MCOs with defined structures and extended π-conjugation are also ideal models for the establishment of accurate structure–property–performance relationships.26–28 Currently, small-molecule-based NFAs4,6 and their polymerized counterparts29–32 have been widely studied, but little attention has been paid to oligomerized NFAs.33–35 In fact, the inherent necessity for C–M (M = B or Sn) pre-functionalization has severely limited the application of classical C–M/C–Br Suzuki and Stille couplings in the synthesis of long-chain MCOs, especially for those with stepwise increasing chain lengths.36–39 In recent years, direct arylation of the C–H bond (DACH), i.e., C–H/C–Br coupling, has emerged as an eco-friendly, atom- and step-economic protocol to produce π-conjugated materials to meet the requirements of green and sustainable development of OSCs.40–47 Actually, the simpler chemical structure of unfused NFAs with high performance would be very promising if this “greener” synthetic chemistry could be successfully employed.17–20
Herein, we have developed, for the first time, a robust DACH synthetic strategy to access MCO-based NFAs. A series of six oligomerized unfused NFAs, namely IDB-IC-n and IDBF-IC-n (n = 1–3) (Scheme 1a) with stepwise increasing chain lengths, were successfully synthesized via a one-step DACH coupling combined with a Vilsmeier–Haack (V–H) reaction and Knoevenagel condensation in a pot-economic manner. Three reactions carried out in three successive pots produced three acceptors (Scheme 1b), representing the most efficient synthetic strategy toward oligomerized NFAs. Based on these novel oligomeric models, the chain-length dependence of light absorption, energy levels, charge transport, morphologies and OSC performances of the oligomerized unfused NFA-based bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were systematically investigated. BHJ devices based on IDB-IC-1 and IDBF-IC-1 without the aid of additives showed PCEs of 10.32% and 12.12%, respectively.

The pot-48 and atom-economic synthetic strategy toward oligomerized NFAs here developed is solvent-, labour-, and time-saving, and will inspire innovative research on the accurate structure–property relationship, and promote the combination of green chemistry with green energy.49
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The oligomeric cores alt-(IDT-BT)-1–3 or alt-(IDT-DFBT)-1–3 with stepwise increasing chain lengths can be easily obtained by DACH coupling between indacenodithiophene (IDT) and 4,7-dibromo-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DBBT) or 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DFBT) at a non-equimolar ratio of 2:1 (Scheme S1†)37–39 in yields of ∼22% with a 68% total conversion of starting IDT. The excessive amount of IDT applied led to the formation of oligomers terminated exclusively by C–H bonds (Scheme S1†),38 which were used for the next V–H reaction, affording oligomeric dialdehyde intermediates. Lastly, Knoevenagel condensation of dialdehydes with 5,6-difluoro-1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DFIC) produced target oligomerized NFAs IDB-IC-n or IDBF-IC-n (n = 1–3) in yields of ∼84%. Although the above route is highly efficient, this one-by-one strategy still requires 7 pots of reaction along with 7 separations by column-chromatography (CC) (Scheme S1†) to obtain all IDB(F)-IC-n (n = 1–3).
Inspired by pot-economic chemistry49 and considering the cleanness and high conversion of the V–H and Knoevenagel reactions, here, the oligomeric mixture obtained by DACH oligomerization in the first step was simply washed with H2O and MeOH to remove inorganic salts and unreacted IDT, and then directly subjected to the next V–H reaction with an excessive amount of anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Likewise, the V–H reaction-derived dialdehyde oligomeric mixtures were directly subjected to the last pot of Knoevenagel reaction with DFIC, yielding target NFAs IDB(F)-IC-n (n = 1–3), which were eventually separated by a single CC (Scheme 1b, and Fig. S1†). As a result, three long-chain oligomeric NFAs were facilely obtained by only three pots of successive reactions. Such an atom- and pot-economic strategy considerably simplified the synthetic procedures, leading not only to higher yields of products, but also to less emission of chemical waste. Instead, if the routine C–M/C–Br (M = B or Sn) couplings were employed, the synthesis of the above NFAs would be very tedious and challenging, especially for IDB(F)-IC-3 with the longest conjugations (Scheme S2†).
It is noteworthy that further enhancing the molar ratio between IDT and DBBT (or DFBT) for C–H arylation will minimize the formation of long oligomers and thus enhance the fraction of short products. The yields of alt-(IDT-BT)-1 or alt-(IDT-DFBT)-1 with the shortest lengths could be improved to ∼60% when the ratio of IDT to DBBT (or DFBT) was tuned to 3:1.36 Impressively, a larger molar ratio of 10:1 even led to yields of alt-(IDT-BT)-1 or alt-(IDT-DFBT)-1 up to 83% which were subjected to the next two pots of V–H and Knoevenagel reactions without additional CC purification. The unreacted excessive IDT can be easily recovered by recrystallization for reuse (Scheme S3†). These results demonstrate that the oligomer distributions in DACH oligomerization can be facilely tailored by tuning the molar ratios of two coupling partners.
All the synthesized oligomeric macromolecules exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), or o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The structures of all oligomeric intermediates and target NFAs were confirmed by NMR and mass spectra (MS) (for copies of the spectra, see ESI†). The MS analysis of the resulting fractions confirmed a stepwise evolution from IDB(F)-IC-1 to IDB(F)-IC-3, with an interval value of ∼734 (771) for the molecular weights (Fig. S2†). Both the evolutions of MS and 1H NMR spectra are consistent with the stepwise increase in chain length.

Fig. 1 shows the chemical shifts of alkenyl and aromatic protons of six oligomeric NFAs. The chemical shifts of Ha–e of two series oligomers are very close. The signal at 7.67–7.72 ppm is assigned to the hydrogen (Ha) of terminal IC, and the multiple peaks of Ha are mainly caused by the adjacent F atoms. Both sets of peaks at 8.97 and 7.62 ppm with fixed integrations of 2 are ascribed to the hydrogen (Hb) on the alkene double bonds and the β-hydrogen (Hc) of terminal IDT, respectively. The multiple peaks at 7.48 ppm and the broad peak at 8.54–8.57 ppm arise from backbone hydrogens (Hd and He) on the phenyl ring of IDT. Both series of oligomeric homologues exhibit spectral changes corresponding to their structural evolution. The integrations of hydrogens (Hd + He) for IDB(F)-IC-1, IDB(F)-IC-2 and IDB(F)-IC-3 are 4, 6 and 8, respectively, which match the gradual increase in the number of repeat units. Compared to the IDB-IC-n series, the β-hydrogens (Hf) at the IDT of IDBF-IC-n show an impressive shift to lower field (8.27 vs. 8.12 ppm). This downfield shift is due to the presence of fluorine on the DFBT of IDBF-IC-n, leading to F⋯H intramolecular hydrogen bonding non-covalent interaction between F and Hf with conformational lock. Moreover, Hg at ∼8.00 ppm was exclusively assigned to the hydrogens on the BT units of the IDB-IC-n series (X = H, Fig. 1), reflecting the structural differences between the two series of NFAs.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to predict the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbital (FMOs) distributions, showing that the BT-based IDB-IC-n and DFBT-based IDBF-IC-n have different torsional angles along the conjugated backbones (Fig. S3†). In contrast to IDB-IC-n (Fig. S3a†), the optimized molecular geometries of IDBF-IC-n have a locked conformation as an almost planar skeleton with a slightly helical geometry due to the F⋯H intramolecular non-covalent interactions between IDT and DFBT spacers (Fig. S3b†). Such an F⋯H non-covalent interaction was also supported by the downfield shift of Hf in the 1H NMR of IDBF-IC-n (Fig. 1). The decreased distortion of the backbone will enhance the effective conjugation (side view of IDBF-IC-n in Fig. S3b†). For FMO distributions, the LUMOs are distributed on the terminal IC, whereas the HOMOs are mainly delocalized on the electron-donating cores (Fig. S3†). The overlap between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals decreased with an increase in chain length. As a result, the electron push–pull effect might be weakened with the growth of oligomeric chains.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis spectra, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and FMO alignments of the six oligomeric NFAs, with the significant data summarized in Table 1. All the oligomers have very similar absorption profiles. IDB-IC-n (n = 1–3) in CHCl3 solution display maximum absorptions (λsolmax) located at 716.0, 712.5, and 708.0 nm, respectively (Fig. 2a). While the IDBF-IC-n (n = 1–3) series show a slight blue-shift in λsolmax compared to their IDB-IC-n (n = 1–3) counterparts (Fig. 2b), due to the decreased D–A interaction between the oligomeric cores and the terminal IC arising from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the DFBT units. It is noteworthy that all oligomeric NFAs exhibited excellent light absorptance with extinction coefficients larger than 105 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S4†).

From solutions to the solid thin films, all acceptors exhibited conspicuously red-shifted and broadened absorption with a pronounced 0–1 transition, implying stronger π–π stacking in the solid state, and thus enhanced intermolecular charge transfer. The maximum absorptions for film (λfilmax) of IDB-IC-1, IDB-IC-2, IDB-IC-3, IDBF-IC-1, IDBF-IC-2 and IDBF-IC-3 are 769.5, 758.5, 742.5, 757.5, 743.0 and 727.0 nm, respectively. The extension of chain lengths led to a progressive blue-shift of λfilmax, which is mainly due to the decrease in the intramolecular push–pull electron effect and changes in the solid-state aggregation with the increase in oligomer lengths Note that all NFAs here obtained have well-matched complementary absorptions with their PBDB-T derivatives (with λfilmax at ∼600 nm).50 The optical bandgaps (Eg) of the IDB-IC-n series calculated from film absorption onsets (λfilonset) have close values of 1.43–1.45 eV, whereas the Egs of the IDBF-IC-n series are between 1.46 and 1.51 eV. Both series of oligomers have widening Egs with an increase in chain length. These results indicate that the optical property can be finely tuned by extending the conjugation length or introducing fluoridated building units.26,51
CV was conducted to assess the energy levels of the oligomeric NFAs (Fig. 2c). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the acceptors were estimated from the onsets of reduction/oxidation potentials. The obtained HOMO/LUMO levels of IDB-IC-1, IDB-IC-2, IDB-IC-3, IDBF-IC-1, IDBF-IC-2, and IDBF-IC-3 were −5.63/−3.98, −5.51/−3.90, −5.45/−3.85, −5.73/−4.01, −5.56/−3.94 and −5.47/−3.91 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d). Typically, the LUMO and HOMO of a molecule are governed by its strongest electron-withdrawing and electron-donating building units, respectively. These six acceptors show closely similar LUMO levels of −3.9 to 4.0 eV (Fig. 1c), owing to the similar electron-withdrawing DFIC ending the groups involved. In contrast to the LUMOs, the HOMO levels of IDB(F)-IC-n are slightly upshifted with an extension in π-conjugation length, owing to the increasing numbers of IDTs (an electron-donating unit) with the elongation of the oligomeric chains.
Photovoltaic properties
The benchmark donor polymer PM6, which has a well-matched energy level and complementary light absorption (Fig. S5†),52 was paired with our oligomeric NFAs to make BHJs to evaluate the impact of conjugation length on photovoltaic performance. The conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/PFN-Br/Ag was fabricated and tested under AM 1.5G solar illumination. The detailed device optimization process (Tables S1 and S2†) revealed that a thermal annealing treatment on BHJ films at 100 °C for 10 min gave the best performance. Fig. 3 shows the characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices and their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PM6:IDB-IC-1 BHJ with optimal D:A ratio (1:1.2) yielded a PCE of 10.32% with an open voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short current (JSC) of 16.13 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.02%. Compared to PM6:IDB-IC-1, PM6:IDBF-IC-1 (1:1 ratio) BHJ showed the best PCE of 12.12% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 19.17 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.50%. Note that the additives, such as 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO), have no positive effect on PCE. The higher PCE of IDBF-IC-1 can also be ascribed to its geometric planarity (Fig. S3b†) between DFBT and IDT spacers which are conformationally interlocked by F⋯H and F⋯S noncovalent interactions, leading to a more optimal BHJ morphology and a higher charge carrier mobility.

The PCEs decreased with an elongation in their backbones, which is mainly caused by the reduced JSC and FF. The elongation of the oligomeric chain might also weaken the D–A electron push–pull effect between the electron-donating core and electron-accepting terminal IC, causing a loss in charge transport efficiency. Although the PECs of IDBF-IC-2,3-based devices were inferior to those of IDBF-IC-1-based devices, they all featured high VOCs (0.94 V) owing to the upshifts in LUMO levels with the increase in chain length (Fig. 2d). Herein, the VOC trend of IDB-IC-n is not consistent with the offsets between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor, owing to the much lower JSC, FFs and PCEs of IDB-IC-2 and -3, which might influence the VOCs. Meanwhile, the HOMO levels of the NFAs were also upshifted with an increase in conjugation length, causing a decrease in HOMO offsets (ΔEHOMO), and affording less driving force for charge separation at the D/A interface with a higher energy loss and lower JSCs.

Fig. 3b shows the EQE spectra of the devices. IDB(F)-IC-1-based BHJs displayed a broad photo-response from 350 to 850 nm, while IDB(F)-IC-2,3-based devices exhibited slightly narrower EQE spectra owing to their blue-shifted light absorption. The IDB-IC-1-based BHJ has an EQE response of over 55% between 460 and 750 nm with a peak at 570 nm of 65% EQE. The IDBF-IC-1-based device shows a distinct photo-response band over 70% EQE in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions of 460–770 nm. This means that IDBF-IC-1 with its better planarity is beneficial for charge mobility and thus improved photo-current.
Recombination mechanism and charge carrier mobility
To further reveal the structure–property relationship among the oligomeric NFAs with varied chain lengths, the exciton dissociation and charge transport dynamics of the BHJs were investigated. The relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) are depicted in Fig. 4a. Jsat is defined as the saturation photocurrent density. If Jph reaches saturation value (Jsat) at high Veff (Veff ≥ 2 V), this implies that all excitons were extracted and that photo-generated free carriers were completely collected by corresponding electrodes. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) values (i.e., Jph/Jsat ratio) under maximum power output conditions/short-circuit conditions for the BHJs based on IDB-IC-1, IDBF-IC-1, IDB-IC-2, IDBF-IC-2, IDB-IC-3 and IDBF-IC-3 are 96.2%/97.8%, 96.0%/98.3%, 61.0%/82.4%, 76.4%/90.7%, 37.9%/57.1% and 58.6%/75.7%, respectively. The higher P(E,T)s for the IDB(F)-IC-1-based BHJ means better exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. The P(E,T)s dramatically decreased with elongation of the chain length, consistent with the trend of JSCs (Table 2).
 Fig. 4  The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on Veff (a). The dependence of light intensity on JSC (b) and VOC (c). 
The light intensity (Plight) dependencies of JSC and VOC under optimal device conditions were investigated to survey the charge recombination behaviors of various acceptors. The Plight dependence of JSC was assessed by JSC ∝ Pα, where α is the slope of the fitting line. Here, the α values for IDB-IC-1 and IDBF-IC-1 are 0.994 and 0.990 (Fig. 4b), respectively, showing negligible bimolecular recombination, which accounts for the high JSC of the corresponding BHJ devices. With the increase in chain length, the α value deviates from unity, providing a plausible reason for the low FF.
Furthermore, the slopes of VOC ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight) of the optimized devices (Fig. 4c) were investigated, where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and elementary charge, respectively. Typically, bimolecular recombination will be dominant if the slope equals 1kT/q, while a slope close to 2kT/q represents monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination in BHJs. The slopes of IDB(F)-IC-1-based devices are 1.26 and 1.46kT/q, respectively, suggesting the character of bimolecular recombination. However, IDBF-IC-2,3-based BHJs had slopes of 1.88 and 2.08kT/q, respectively, so they might suffer from more serious monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination. The greater slopes (>2kT/q) of the IDB-IC-2,3-based devices result from the presence of Schottky barriers owing to the energy landscape in the BHJ layers.53 Thus, the above trends show that the charge recombination becomes more severe with an increase in chain length and weakened intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).
To reveal the effect of the push–pull electron effect on charge transfer, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the BHJ films were checked by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6†). Typically, the donors and acceptors are responsible for the hole and electron transports of the BHJ layers, respectively. Here, the μhs of the six blends were comparable (i.e., 1.50 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1), because all BHJ devices involved a similar donor material PM6. The μe in PM6:IDB-IC-1 and PM6:IDBF-IC-1 BHJs were 1.23 × 10−4 and 0.94 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1 (Table S3†), respectively, with relatively balanced μh/μe ratios of 1.8 and 1.2, leading to enhanced FFs and JSCs. In contrast, the PM6:IDB(F)-IC-2,3 BHJs exhibited significant decreases in μe, 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of the PM6:IDB(F)-IC-1 BHJ devices. The lopsided μh/μe of the PM6:IDB(F)-IC-2,3 BHJs might be attributed to the decreased ICT as well as the weakened intramolecular D–A interaction with the elongation of NFAs, leading to undesirable electron transport. This tendency in μe of the oligomeric NFA-based BHJs was in accordance with the charge recombination discussed above.
The phase separation and surface morphologies of the BHJ films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S7 and S8†). The BHJs of PM6:IDB-IC-1 and PM6:IDBF-IC-1 exhibit uniform and smooth surfaces with small root-mean-square (Rq) roughness of 0.75 and 0.86 nm, respectively. However, more serious phase separation with Rq of 3.30, 2.81, 4.33 and 4.43 nm were observed in the BHJs of PM6:IDB-IC-2, PM6:IDBF-IC-2, PM6:IDB-IC-3 and PM6:IDBF-IC-3, respectively. PM6:IDB(F)-IC-1 BHJs have a bi-continuous fibrous network, suggesting a suitable miscibility between the acceptor and donor, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport and the FFs of OSCs. The excessive phase separation of IDB(F)-IC-2- and IDB(F)-IC-3-based BHJs (Fig. S7 and S8†) might correlate with their stronger self-aggregation.
Conclusions
Combined with the atom economy of C–H direct arylation, pot economy was introduced, for the first time, in the synthesis of NFAs for OSC applications. Three oligomeric NFAs with a stepwise-increase in π-conjugation length, i.e., IDB-IC-n or IDBF-IC-n (n = 1–3), were facilely obtained via three successive one-pot reactions followed by a single CC separation process, representing the most efficient synthetic protocol for oligomerized NFAs. Among the BHJ devices incorporating the six NFAs, the best-performing IDB-IC-1- and IDBF-IC-1-based devices afforded PCEs of 10.32% and 12.12%, respectively. Studies of structure–property–performance relationships reveal that the elongation of the electron-donating core leads to a decrease in PCE, which is mainly due to weakened D–A electron push–pull interactions and a decreased driving force for charge transfer. These findings provide insight into how OSC performance is influenced by the NFA conjugation length. Considering that there is still room for improving the PCEs of oligomerized NFAs (e.g., through the rational selection of building blocks and donor partners), the preliminary yet promising results obtained here will have significance for the synthesis of complex NFAs via a highly straightforward strategy, thus expanding the horizons of NFA materials.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and anhydrous solvents DMF and POCl3 were purchased from Energy Chemical. The starting DBBT, DFBT, IDT were purchased from SunaTech Inc, and Derthon Technology Co., respectively. Anhydrous toluene and anhydrous CHCl3 were obtained from treating the conventional ones with CaH2.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Advance NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz frequency, and obtained in chloroform-d. MALDI-TOF MS were measured on a Bruker Autoflex II or Axima Assurance Linear using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured on a CHI600A electrochemical workstation with Pt wire, Ag/Ag+ electrode, and standard calomel electrode (SCE) as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The CV curves were recorded versus the potential of SCE, which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). Density functional theory (DFT) methods were performed with the Gaussian 09 program, using Becke's three-parameter gradient corrected functional (B3LYP) with the 6-31G (d,p) basis set. Topographic images of the BHJs were obtained on a VeecoMultiMode atomic force microscope (AFM) in the tapping mode using an etched silicon cantilever at a nominal load of ∼2 nN, and the scanning rate for a 2 μm × 2 μm image size was 1.5 Hz.

Pot-economic synthesis of IDB-IC-1, 2, and 3
In a 50 mL Schlenk tube, IDT (400 mg, 0.66 mmol), DBBT (96.7 mg, 0.33 mmol), Pd2 (dba)3 (12.1 mg, 2 mol%), tris(o-methoxyphenyl) phosphine (9.3 mg, 4 mol%), anhydrous Cs2CO3 (423.6 mg, 1.3 mmol), PivOH (20.2 mg, 30 mol%) were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (10 mL) under N2. The reaction solution was deoxygenated by freeze–vacuum–thaw cycles three times, and then rigorously stirred at 85 °C for 6 h under argon atmosphere. Then the crude product was extracted with CH2Cl2 and washed with NaCl aqueous solution and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After simple washing by MeOH, the mixture was dried by a vacuum oven and directly subjected to the next V–H reaction.
The mixture obtained in the above pot was dissolved in a 100 mL two-necked round bottom flask with anhydrous 1,2-dichloroethane (40 mL). Then, anhydrous DMF (4.5 mL) and POCl3 (4.2 mL) were added by a syringe dropwise into the mixture solution under stirring at 0 °C. After stirring for 2 h, the cooling bath was removed and the mixture was refluxed overnight. Then, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated sodium acetate solution. The crude product was extracted with CH2Cl2 and washed with NaCl aqueous solution and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removing the solvent, the mixture was dried by a vacuum oven and directly subjected to the next Knoevenagel reaction.
The mixture obtained in the above pot, DFIC (184 mg, 0.8 mmol) and dried CHCl3 (10 mL) were added into a Schlenk tube. The mixture was deoxygenated by freeze–vacuum–thaw cycles three times; then 0.3 mL of pyridine was added. The resulting mixture was refluxed under argon atmosphere at 65 °C for 15 h. Then, the solution was poured into methanol and the precipitate was filtered off and washed with methanol, yielding a dark blue crude solid, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with petroleum ether and dichloromethane, and afforded IDB-IC-1 (95.8 mg, total yield 16%), IDB-IC-2 (59.0 mg, total yield 14%) and IDB-IC-3 (47.6 mg, total yield 13%).
Pot-economic synthesis of IDBF-IC-1, 2, and 3
In a 50 mL Schlenk tube, IDT (400 mg, 0.66 mmol) and DFBT (108.6 mg, 0.33 mmol) were used as reactants. Other additives and post-treatment of the reaction are the same as those of the pot-economic synthesis of IDB-IC-1, 2 and 3, affording IDBF-IC-1 (94.3 mg, total yield 15%), IDBF-IC-2 (60.2 mg, total yield 14%) and IDBF-IC-3 (52.7 mg, total yield 14%).
Device fabrication and characterization
Organic solar cells were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO), constructing the conventional structures of indium tin oxide/poly(3,4ethylenedioxy thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BHJ/PFN-Br/Ag. Before fabrication, the substrates were pre-cleaned by an ultrasonic bath of detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol consecutively, and subsequently dried by nitrogen blow. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm onto the ITO surface. After baking at 170 °C for 20 minutes, the substrates were transferred into an argon-filled glove box. The active layer was spin-coated from 16 mg mL−1 chloroform solution, and then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, PFN–Br solution (0.5 mg ml−1, dissolved in methanol) was spin-coated at 3500 rpm. Finally, a 100 nm Ag layer was deposited under a high vacuum (<2 × 10−4 Pa). The effective area of the cells was 0.04 mm2 defined by shallow masks.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs were studied on an Enlitech SS-F5-3A solar simulator under the condition of AM 1.5 G illumination, whose light intensity was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell at 100 mV cm−2. The EQEs were measured with a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System (RE-R, Enlitech).
The charge carrier mobilities of the donor:acceptor films were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/MoO3/Ag and electron-only devices with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/PFN–Br/Ag were fabricated. The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott–Gurney law:  where εr ≈ 3 is the average dielectric constant of the blended film, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μ is the carrier mobility, L ≈ 100 nm is the thickness of the film, and V is the applied voltage.
