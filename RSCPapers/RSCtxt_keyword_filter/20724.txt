    , Accepted 13th January 2019First published on 14th January 2019AbstractThe performance of vacuum-deposited organometal halide perovskite devices under low-intensity illumination was investigated. The low defect density of the vacuum-deposited perovskite thin film facilitates the development of a high performance device with low-cost C60 as the electron transporting layer, which is superior to solution-processed cells made by a 2-step spin-casting method with expensive fullerene derivatives. The small-area vacuum-deposited devices exhibited high power conversion efficiencies and output power densities of up to 30.1% and 94.9 μW cm−2 at 1000 lux and 28.5% and 18.1 μW cm−2 at 200 lux, respectively. The large-area vacuum-deposited devices with an active area of 5.68 cm2 showed high reproducibility and exhibited high power conversion efficiencies and output power densities up to 24.9% and 77.6 μW cm−2 at 1000 lux and 21.9% and 13.8 μW cm−2 at 200 lux, respectively. Moreover, the small- and large-area devices also showed good stability and a negligible efficiency decrease in one year. The high performance and high stability results indicate that vacuum-deposited perovskite photovoltaics are one of the most promising energy harvesters for low-power electronics in the future.
1. Introduction
The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) demands an efficient off-grid energy provider for potentially billions of discrete sensing nodes.1–3 Among all energy types including photon energy, thermal energy, and vibration energy, photon energy exhibits much higher energy density in the general environment and hence, photovoltaics suitable for environmental dim light energy harvesting are one of the most promising power providers for numerous IoT sensing nodes.4,5 Currently, organometallic perovskite optoelectronic devices are attracting increased interest worldwide, and they have developed rapidly in recent years.6–13 In our previous report, we showed that solution-processed organometallic perovskite photovoltaics with inverted planar device structures are particularly suitable for indoor dim-light energy harvesting applications, and high environmental light-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 27.4% were demonstrated.14 While many studies focused on ways to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells under harsh bright 1-sun illumination, one believes that perovskite photovoltaics should be suitable for use under more gentle environmental dim light and indoor artificial illumination.15–17 For instance, efficient flexible perovskite photovoltaic devices for artificial light harvesting were first demonstrated by Lucarelli et al. in 2017, which exhibited high PCEs and output power densities (PMAX) up to 12.1% and 16.0 μW cm−2 at 400 lux.18 In 2018, Dagar et al. demonstrated that, even at very low light intensities, their solution-processed perovskite photovoltaic devices with normal structures could still deliver exceptionally high output power densities up to 20.2 μW cm−2 and 41.6 μW cm−2 under 200 lux and 400 lux LED illumination, respectively.19 In this study, we further discovered that all vacuum-deposited perovskite active layers and devices with low carrier traps exhibited even more preferable properties for environmental light energy harvesting. In contrast to solution-processed perovskites for which an expensive fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as the electron transporting layer (ETL) and a modified PCBM spin-coating method (2-step spin-coating), which could make fullerenes penetrate deeper into perovskites compared to simply spin-coating PCBM on perovskites (1-step spin-coating), were required to reduce the carrier traps of perovskites (trap passivation),14 simple thermal evaporation of cheap C60 was utilized and the device exhibited an even higher PCE up to 30.1%.
Vacuum deposition is a mature fabrication method to produce extremely uniform films.20–23 Accordingly, large-area devices were fabricated and they exhibited certified PCEs and output power densities up to 22.3% and 72.6 μW cm−2, respectively, with a good omnidirectional performance. In the field test, the small- and large-area devices (active areas of 5.1 mm2 and 5.68 cm2, respectively) also exhibited stable PCEs in a normal real-life household environment with only 1.3% and 0.8% decreases of their peak efficiencies in one year.
2. Results and discussion
All vacuum-deposited perovskite devices with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) (140 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/tris[4-(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)phenyl]amine (TPTPA) (10 nm)/perovskite (≈300 nm)/C60 (90 nm)/1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB) (7 nm)/Ag (150 nm) were used in this study. Perovskite layers were prepared using sequential vacuum deposition.24Fig. 1 shows the J–V characteristics of the device under fluorescent lamp illumination of 200–1000 lux. The performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The vacuum-deposited perovskite device delivered a high PCE of 30.1%, a PMAX of 94.9 μW cm−2, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 139 μA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V, and a FF of 0.75 at 1000 lux. The values slightly decreased to a PCE of 28.5%, a PMAX of 18.1 μW cm−2, a JSC of 30.7 μA cm−2, a VOC of 0.83 V, and a FF of 0.71 at 200 lux.

The J–V characteristics of a vacuum-deposited perovskite photovoltaic device were also obtained at 600 lux with different scan directions. The device showed negligible hysteresis behavior with PCEs of 29.1% and 29.5% for forward and reverse scans, respectively (Fig. S1†). The steady-state behavior of the device shown in Fig. S2† suggests a stabilized PCE of 29.4% at 600 lux, which matched the PCE value obtained from the J–V measurements. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device is presented in Fig. S3.† The integrated JSC and the one obtained from the J–V measurements at 600 lux were about 78 and 82 μA cm−2, respectively, within the uncertainty range of the power meter. Remarkably, the vacuum-deposited perovskite device outperforms the solution-processed perovskite device with a similar inverted planar structure, whose highest reported PCE was 27.4% under fluorescent lamp illumination of 1000 lux.14 The higher PCE of the vacuum-deposited perovskite device compared with the solution-processed perovskite device with a similar inverted planar structure could be mostly ascribed to the higher VOC and FF.
To investigate the origin of the large difference in the FF and VOC of the devices prepared via a solution process and sequential vapor deposition with similar inverted planar structures, transient photocurrent (TPC) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed. We have shown in a previous study that, compared with the vacuum-deposited C60, the solution-processed PCBM could reduce the traps in the spin-coated perovskite, resulting in a more efficient carrier sweep-out. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the vacuum-deposited perovskite device with C60 as the ETL showed fast TPC decay, similar to the behavior of the spin-coated perovskite devices with 2-step or 1-step spin-coated PCBM as the ETL. Their corresponding time constants were 0.26 μs, 0.23 μs, and 0.28 μs, for the vacuum-deposited perovskite with C60 as the ETL, spin-coated perovskite with 2-step PCBM as the ETL, and spin-coated perovskite with 1-step PCBM as the ETL, respectively. The comparable photocurrent decay rates indicate that the vacuum-deposited perovskite device with C60 as the ETL can still exhibit efficient carrier extraction, in other words, efficient carrier transfers between perovskites and ETLs, despite the lack of the passivation from the solution-processed fullerenes.
 Fig. 2  Normalized transient photocurrent results of the vacuum-deposited perovskite device (abbreviated as v. per.) with C60 as the ETL and the solution-processed perovskite device (abbreviated as s. per.) with spin-coated PCBM as the ETL. The dashed lines are the fitted single-exponential decay curves. 
To further investigate the origin of the observed differences in the carrier extraction efficiencies of vacuum-deposited and solution-processed perovskite devices with C60 as the ETL, TRPL measurements were performed on vacuum-deposited and solution-processed perovskite neat films deposited on glass substrates. As shown in Fig. 3, the solution-processed perovskite thin film showed a fast photoluminescence (PL) decay with an average lifetime of 22.8 ns, whereas the vacuum-deposited perovskite thin film showed a slow PL decay with a much longer average lifetime of 137.2 ns. The parameters are summarized in Table S1, ESI.† The longer PL lifetime suggests reduced carrier recombination in the vacuum-deposited perovskite thin film.

From the TPC results, we found that the vacuum-deposited perovskite device with C60 as the ETL could readily show similar carrier extraction efficiencies to the solution-processed perovskite device with PCBM as the ETL in the TPC measurements, because they share the same properties as the reduced traps in the devices. While the better device performance of vacuum-deposited perovskites could be attributed to the much better film quality and lower trap densities, resulting in reduced carrier recombination in the device at a weak electric field, such as the maximum power point, at which the carrier recombination will become agitated, playing the decisive role in the device performance.
The long-term stability of the vacuum-deposited perovskite device was also measured by storing the device in a normal indoor environment with regular illumination of 200–1000 lux for 1 year. The encapsulated device was placed on a shelf in office and far from windows. During the year, the temperature and relative humidity in the office were in the range of 20–30 °C and 50–70%, respectively, with the device exposed to fluorescent light illumination for 12–16 hours a day. As shown in Fig. 4, the PCE of the device under illumination of 600 lux only showed a small decrease of 1.3% of its peak value in 1 year with simple epoxy encapsulation without any desiccant. Compared with all-vacuum-deposited organometallic perovskite solar cells operating under continuous 1 sun illumination, reported by Momblona et al., the device showed a 20% decrease of its peak efficiency in about 7 days,25 which suggests that the lifetimes of perovskite devices operating in a gentle indoor environment could be largely extended compared with those of perovskite devices operating in a much harsher bright 1-sun environment. At the same time, according to the results reported by Hsiao et al., we believe that, without special treatment, such as the introduction of mixed-cation, low-dimensional perovskites and composite inorganic carrier extraction layers,24 the vacuum-deposited perovskites could exhibit better stability than solution-processed perovskites with similar compositions and device structures.
 Fig. 4  Long-term PCE stability under illumination of 600 lux of a vacuum-deposited perovskite photovoltaic device. The initial PCE value was 28.9%. The device was placed in a normal in-door environment with irregular 200 to 1000 lux illumination between the measurement points. 
By utilizing the ability of the vacuum deposition technique to deposit large and uniform thin films, we further fabricated large-area vacuum-deposited perovskite devices with an active area of 5.68 cm2, and the photos and performance of the champion device are presented in Fig. S4, S5† and 5. The performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. In comparison with the small-area device, the large-area device showed a small decrease in the efficiency and exhibited a JSC of 113 μA cm−2, a PCE of 24.9%, a PMAX of 77.6 μW cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V, and a FF of 0.78 at 1000 lux, and the values slightly decreased to a JSC of 22.4 μA cm−2, a PCE of 21.9%, a PMAX of 13.8 μW cm−2, a VOC of 0.82 V, and a FF of 0.75 at 200 lux, with a small maximum power point (MPP) voltage (VMPP) variation of 0.05 V. The low VMPP variation ensures a low-cost, simple MPP tracking circuit for practical applications. The PCE stability under illumination of 1000 lux of a large-area device is also shown in Fig. S6,† with only 1% decrease of its peak value in 10 months.

The performance parameters of 12 large-area vacuum-deposited perovskite devices fabricated from six different batches under fluorescent lamp illumination of 1000 lux are shown in Fig. S7.† The devices showed high reproducibility and exhibited PCEs of 24.9–22.9% and PMAX values of 77.6–71.4 μW cm−2 at 1000 lux. Notably, the vacuum-deposited large-area perovskite devices exhibited larger photovoltages, leading to larger PCEs than those of the reported solution-processed large-area perovskite device, which could be attributed to the higher uniformity of the deposited perovskite thin films when scaled to large areas. The top-view scanning electron microscopy images are shown in Fig. 6. Both vacuum-deposited and spin-coated perovskite thin films exhibited large micrometer-sized crystal grains. The vacuum-deposited perovskite thin film possessed full surface coverage, while its spin-coated counterpart showed voids as large as hundreds of nanometers. The full coverage of the vacuum-deposited perovskite thin film could avoid direct recombination channels between the ETL and the HTL in the device, while the increase of exposed crystal surfaces in solution-processed perovskite thin films could become carrier traps and increase carrier recombination in the perovskite, which is in agreement with the TRPL results.

The performance of the large-area perovskite device under fluorescent lamp illumination was also compared with that of a commercially available crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic device. The devices were covered by masks with an aperture area of 2 cm × 2 cm and connected to two identical Texas Instrument's BQ25570-based low-power harvest circuits. The blink frequencies of the small light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the circuit boards were proportional to the harvested electrical power. As shown in the ESI movie,† the LED connected to the silicon device blinked 2.8 times slower than the LED connected to the perovskite device at ≈1600 and became 6.3 times slower when the illumination was decreased to 750 lux. Eventually, when the illumination level was further decreased to ≈180 lux, the crystalline silicon device could not even power up the circuit. Simultaneously, the LED connected to the perovskite device could still blink about 12 times per minute. Additionally, we also compared the performance of the large-area perovskite device with that of an amorphous silicon photovoltaic device. The clear aperture area was 3 cm × 1.5 cm for the amorphous silicon (a-Si) device. As presented in ESI movie 2,† even with a slightly smaller aperture area in the perovskite device, the LED connected to the perovskite device still blinked 2.2–2.7 times faster than the one connected to the amorphous silicon cell under the illumination of 1600–180 lux. The blink rates are summarized in Table 3. The photo of the perovskite photovoltaic device powering up the circuit under fluorescent illumination of 750 lux is shown in Fig. 7. Three of the large-area devices covered by masks with an aperture area of 2 cm × 2 cm were further certified by a third-party test center (Advanced Laboratory of Accommodation & Research for Organic Photovoltaics, AROPV, Taiwan; ISO/IEC 17025:2005). As shown in Fig. S8,† the efficiencies were certified as 22.3–21.9% with PMAX values of 72.5–71.3 μW cm−2 under fluorescent lamp illumination of 1000 lux. And the efficiencies were certified as 22.6–21.9% with PMAX values of 76.5–74.1 μW cm−2 under LED illumination of 1000 lux. The lower PCEs with respect to the laboratory measurements might come from the difference in the spectral distribution of the light sources, the deviation between the luminous efficiency function and the spectral response of the photometer we utilized to determine the lux levels, and the uncertainty of the broadband radiometer we used to determine the input optical power densities. It is worth noting that the devices exhibited similar performances under fluorescent lamp and LED illuminations, and only showed a negligible higher JSC under LED illumination, which could be attributed to the different spectral distribution that the performance of the photovoltaics is insensitive to the types of lamps. Moreover, the performance of one of the devices was also measured at various temperatures and tilt angles to simulate the real operation conditions as an indoor energy harvester. The device showed a VOC of ≈0.89 V and a high PCE of 22.7% at 15 °C under fluorescent lamp illumination of ≈1000 lux, with a PMAX of 76.5 μW cm−2, and the VOC slightly decreased to 0.83 V at 35 °C, leading to a PCE of 21.1%, with a PMAX of 71.1 μW cm−2. The device showed a similar behavior under LED illumination, with PCEs and PMAXs of 23.2–21.2% and 79.1–72.2 μW cm−2, respectively, at 35–15 °C. Notably, the device could still provide a high VOC of ≈0.74 V and ≈0.70 V under fluorescent lamp and LED illumination, respectively, when the device was placed nearly parallel to the incident light.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, all vacuum-deposited organometallic perovskite photovoltaics intended for indoor applications were prepared. Benefiting from the low defect densities of the vacuum-deposited perovskite thin films, efficient perovskite photovoltaics could be prepared with simple vacuum deposition and low-cost C60 as the ETL. The small-area device showed high PCEs and PMAXs up to 30.1% and 94.9 μW cm−2, respectively, under fluorescent lamp illumination of 1000 lux. The PCE and PMAX slightly decreased to 28.5% and 18.1 μW cm−2 at 200 lux, respectively. Additionally, the large-area devices with an active area of 5.68 cm2 also exhibited high PCEs and PMAXs up to 24.9% and 77.6 μW cm−2, respectively, at 1000 lux. The PCE and the PMAX slightly decreased to 21.9% and 13.8 μW cm−2 at 200 lux, respectively. Additionally, 12 large-area devices fabricated from six different batches showed good reproducibility and exhibited high PCEs and PMAXs of 24.9–22.9% and 77.6–71.4 μW cm−2, respectively, under fluorescent lamp illumination of 1000 lux. Three of them were further evaluated by a third-party test center and certified to have 22.6–21.9% PCEs and 76.7–71.3 μW cm−2PMAXs under fluorescent lamp or LED illumination of 1000 lux at 25 °C. The small- and large-area vacuum-deposited perovskite devices also exhibited remarkably stable PCEs with a decrease of only 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, of their peak efficiencies in one year. The high performance and high stability results indicate that vacuum-deposited perovskite photovoltaics are one of the most promising energy harvesters and providers for future IoT applications.
