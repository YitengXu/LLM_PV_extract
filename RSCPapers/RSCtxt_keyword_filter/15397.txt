    , Accepted 10th January 2012First published on 10th January 2012AbstractHigh power conversion efficiency and long-term stability are significant targets for practical applications of dye-sensitized solar cells. Here, we present a quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell that incorporates a low molecular weight organic gelator-based electrolyte in conjunction with a high-absorptivity ruthenium sensitizer C105, exhibiting an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.1%. By means of transient absorption and electrical impedance measurements, we scrutinize the impacts of the additive low molecular weight organic gelator in a low-volatility 3-methoxypropionitrile electrolyte on the photovoltaic characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells with a sensitizer C105.

Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cells have received considerable attention as a cost-effective alternative to conventional solar cells. To date, the dye-sensitized solar cell has achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of 12.3% at AM1.5G full sunlight irradiation. However, one of the main factors that has hampered the widespread practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells is their thermal and light-soaking stability. In this work, based on a low molecular weight organic gelator and a high-absorptivity ruthenium sensitizer C105, we demonstrate an outstanding quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell exhibiting an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.1% and a good stability under the long-term thermal and light-soaking dual stress.

1. Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has attracted significant attention in view of its giant potential as a photovoltaic device with excellent performance/price ratio for sustainable energy supply in the future.1 Thus far, a state-of-the-art DSC has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.3% by employing a zinc porphyrin dye and a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte.2 However, the volatilization of organic solvents is considered to be one of the critical issues limiting the long-term stability and practical application of DSCs. To surmount this problem, solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes based on hole conductors3 and gel electrolytes4 have been substituted for liquid electrolytes. In this context, a solid-state DSC with the organic hole transporter spiro-MeOTAD has reached a notarized record efficiency of 6.08% measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight,5 while the long-term stability of solid-state DSCs remains a challenge. Recently, growing attention has been paid to quasi-solid-state DSCs with gel electrolytes, due to their comparable efficiencies to cells using liquid electrolytes and their excellent stability.6
Low molecular weight organic gelators have the unique characteristics of both good solubility upon heating and inducement of smooth gelation of organic liquids at low concentrations. This makes them suitable for the formation of stable gel electrolytes for quasi-solid-state DSCs. In this work, a low molecular weight organic gelator, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-[4-(3-octadecylureido)phenyl]amide (Fig. S1A, ESI†), was used to solidify a 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN)-based liquid electrolyte to obtain a new gel electrolyte (Fig. S1C, ESI†). In combination with this gel electrolyte, we employed the high-absorptivity sensitizer C1057 (Fig. S1B, ESI†) to construct a quasi-solid-state DSC exhibiting an impressive efficiency of 9.1% measured at simulated AM1.5G full sunlight irradiation and a very good stability under thermal and light-soaking dual stress.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials

Acetonitrile, tert-butanol and 3-methoxypropionitrile were distilled before use. Chenodeoxycholic acid, iodine, N-butylbenzoimidazole (NBB), and guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The scattering titania paste (WERO-2) was purchased from Dyesol. 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium (DMII),8cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-[4-(3-octadecylureido)phenyl]amide9 and C1057 were synthesized according to literature methods.
2.2. 
          Cell fabrication
A double-layer titania film was used as the negative electrode. An 11 μm thick transparent layer of 22 nm sized titania particles was first screen-printed onto a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass electrode (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick), and subsequently coated by a 5 μm thick second layer of scattering titania particles (WERO-2, Dyesol). A cycloidal titania electrode (0.283 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution containing C105 dye (300 μM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (1 mM) in the mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1) overnight. The dye-coated titania electrode was subsequently washed with acetonitrile, and then assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode (TEC 15 Ω/□, Libbey-Owens-Ford Industries, 2.2 mm thick). The two active electrodes were separated with a 30 μm thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with electrolytes using a vacuum back filling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode was made with a sand-blasting drill, and was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.
2.3. Conductivity and transient absorption measurements
A Radiometer CDM210 conductivity meter was employed for conductivity measurements. The Radiometer CDC749 conductivity cell with a nominal cell constant of 1.70 cm−1 was calibrated with 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution prior to the experiments. Transient absorption measurements were carried out with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle to the excitation beam. The probe light from a pulsed xenon arc lamp was passed through various optical elements, samples, and a monochromator before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer.
2.4. Photovoltaic characterizations and stability tests
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used to measure photocurrent action spectra, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under full computer control. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated in the National Institute of Metrology, China. A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. J–V characteristics were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2602 source meter under full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 covered the testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities measured under this solar simulator are consistent with the integral of IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTM G173-03) within 5% error. Solar cells covered with a 50 μm thick polyester film (Preservation Equipment Ltd, UK) as a 400 nm UV cut-off filter were irradiated at open circuit under a Suntest CPS plus lamp (ATLAS GmbH, 100 mW cm−2) in ambient air at 60 °C. J–V measurements were carried out at room temperature after allowing the cells to cool down and equilibrate for 30 min.
2.5. Electrical impedance measurements
Electrical impedance experiments were carried out under illumination of a red LED with an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV. A bias was applied to equal the open-circuit voltage at each irradiation intensity. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.).
3. Results and discussion
Our liquid electrolyte is composed of 1.0 M DMII, 0.15 M I2, 0.5 M NBB and 0.1 M GNCS in MPN. The cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-[4-(3-octadecylureido)phenyl]amide (3 wt%) was mixed with this MPN-based liquid electrolyte to construct a new gel electrolyte. First, the conductivities (σ) of the liquid and gel electrolytes were examined. As is apparent from Fig. 1, the Arrhenius equation cannot be used to describe the conductivity-temperature behavior of the liquid and gel electrolytes. A better fit to the data (Fig. 1) is obtained by the Vogel-Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation.10 σ(T) = AT−1/2exp[−B/(T − T0)](1)Where A and B are constants and T0 is the thermodynamic Kauzmann temperature. In this expression, T0 represents the temperature at which ionic mobilities would appear to fall to zero. The conductivities of the liquid and gel electrolytes at room temperature are 12.3 and 10.9 mS cm−1, respectively. Actually, the macroscopic viscosity of the gel electrolyte is much higher compared to that of the liquid electrolyte. The slight decrease in conductivities for the gel electrolyte could be attributed to an open structure of this gel system.11
 Fig. 1  Plots of conductivity–temperature data of the liquid and gel electrolytes in the (a) Arrhenius and (b) VFT coordinates. 
The photocurrent action spectra of cells in combination with the liquid and gel electrolytes are presented in Fig. 2. Both cells exhibit a broad plateau of monochromatic incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) from 490 to 600 nm, implying saturated light harvesting in this wavelength region. This could be attributed to the high molar absorption coefficient of C1057 as well as the light-scattering function of a thick bilayer titania film with a fairly large surface area.12,13 Moreover, the IPCE plateaus are very similar for cells with liquid and gel electrolytes, being ∼83% and ∼82%, respectively.

Transient absorption measurements were further carried out to probe the interfacial kinetic competition between the recombination of photoinjected electrons and oxidized dye molecules, and the interception of oxidized dye molecules by the electron-donating iodide (dye regeneration) in electrolytes.14,15 We first recorded the transient absorption spectrum of a C105 dye-coated titania film with an intensified charge-coupled detector (ICCD) camera. As shown in Fig. 3A, a broad negative signal arises in the visible region between 420 and 640 nm, which can be allocated to the photobleaching of ground-state dye molecules. We ascribe the positive absorption change in the transient absorption spectrum mainly to the electronic excitation of oxidized dye molecules. In view of the signal sensitivity of our photomultiplier tube detector, a 780-nm probe light and a thick titania film were used in the succeeding kinetic measurements. The excitation wavelength and fluence were carefully controlled to ensure that ∼3.5 × 1014photons cm−2 were absorbed by the dye-coated titania film during every laser pulse. The absorption signal decays could be fitted to a stretched exponential decay function (mΔOD ∝ exp[−(t/τ)α]) to afford a half-reaction time (t1/2). As depicted in Fig. 3B and 3C, in the absence of a redox mediator (i.e., in MPN) the slow absorption decay (trace 1) could be ascribed to the back electron transfer from titania to oxidized dye molecules, featuring a typical t1/2 of 529.6 μs. However, upon the utilization of the practical liquid and gel electrolytes, the absorption decays (traces 2 and 3) are significantly accelerated owing to the occurrence of dye regeneration by iodide ions, yielding the corresponding t1/2 of 3.3 and 4.5 μs. In spite of the slightly dissimilar dye regeneration kinetics, the kinetic branch ratios of the dual-channel charge transfer kinetics of oxidized dye molecules are over 117 for both electrolytes, ensuring an efficient interfacial charge separation.

(B) Kinetic absorption traces of an 11 μm thick dye-coated titania film in MPN (1), liquid (2) and gel (3) electrolytes. Excitation wavelength and pulse fluence: 121 μJ cm−2 at 592 nm; probe wavelength: 780 nm. Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 800 laser shots. 
We also recorded the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 4) of both cells under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the cell with the liquid electrolyte are 16.24 mA cm−2, 790 mV and 0.73, respectively, generating an impressive power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.4%. Note that the gel electrolyte does not result in noticeable variations in Jsc and the fill factor, while the Voc diminishes by 11 mV compared to that with the liquid electrolyte, yielding an efficiency of 9.1%. This is so far the best reported efficiency for a quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell based on a low molecular weight organic gelator.

It is known that the open-circuit photovoltage of a DSC under illumination is determined by the Fermi level of titania (EF,n) and that of a redox electrolyte (EF,redox), as described by Voc = (EF,n − EF,redox)/e, where e is the elementary charge. The Voc variation for a DSC with a fixed redox electrolyte must root in the alteration of EF,n, which intimately correlates to the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and the free carrier density (nc), as dictated by the following equation:16 (2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and Nc of 7 × 1020 cm−3 is the density of accessible states in the titania conduction band. Moreover, the quantity of Ec − EF,redox could be roughly estimated by a numerical analysis of the chemical capacitance (Cμ), which can be described as17 (3)where d of 11 μm is the thickness of the transparent titania layer of the titania film, p of 0.64 is the film porosity, Nt of 2 × 1020 cm−3 is the total density of surface states of a nanocrystalline titania film,17Tc is a characteristic parameter depicting the width of the distribution profile of interband states and V is the applied bias during electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Numerical simulation of an electrical impedance spectroscopy employing the transmission line model18 can extract Cμ at a given bias. The Ec − EF,redox values are derived by fitting the data in Fig. 5A, as listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† Note here that since the molar ratios between iodide and triiodide have been maintained as constant in both electrolytes, the electrolyte Fermi level was regarded as invariant according to the Nernst equation.19 It is apparent that the Ec is almost invariable for cells with both electrolytes.
 Fig. 5  Plots of (A) chemical capacitance and (B) interfacial charge transfer resistance as a function of applied bias. 
In view of above analysis, the variation of EF,n is attributed to different free carrier densities (Table S1, ESI†), which can be roughly evaluated via nc = Ncexp{[eVoc − (Ec − EF,redox)]/kBT}.20 The cell with the gel electrolyte presents a lower nc level in contrast to the cell with the liquid electrolyte, which could be further elaborated by comparing the effective charge recombination rate constant (U0k). The U0k can be obtained via a proper analysis of interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct). On the basis of the β-recombination model,21Rct can be expressed as22 (4)where A is the titania film area (0.283 cm2) and β is the reaction order of free titania electrons participating in the recombination reaction. Furthermore, Rct can also be derived from electrical impedance spectroscopies as a function of applied bias (Fig. 5B). Fitting the Rct data to eqn (4) gives the values of U0k, as listed in Table S1.† The larger U0k can lead to a faster charge recombination rate which evidently contributes to a lower electron densities and a reduced cell photovoltage. We deduce that the self-assembled network of the gel may slightly hinder the transportation of I3− ions from the titania/electrolyte interface to the counter electrode, resulting in acceleration of the interfacial charge recombination of the cell with the gel electrolyte.
For any new photovoltaic technology, passing a long-term stability test is critical to access its potential for large-scale applications. Hence, we submitted our high-efficiency cells covered with a UV absorbing polymer film to a 1000 h accelerated aging test at 60 °C, under a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Note that the total contribution of UV photons to the standard AM1.5G solar emission is relatively small. UV light leads to the direct band-edge excitation of titania nanocrystals, generating valence-band holes, which in turn may attack some organic materials in the device. This reaction can be partially suppressed by the hole capture with iodide ions. In our light-soaking experiments, UV light was removed with an antireflection coating. The cell with the liquid electrolyte exhibits good stability after 1000 h accelerated aging, keeping 91% of its initial efficiency (Fig. S2, ESI†). This is the first time such a high-efficiency DSC based on the polypyridyl ruthenium sensitizer with a conjugated selenophene unit in its ancillary ligand has passed preliminary stability tests. We also carried out stability tests of cells with the gel electrolytes under thermal and light-soaking dual stress. As presented in Fig. 6, the quasi-solid-state cell displays comparable stability to the cell with the corresponding liquid electrolyte, retaining 95% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h accelerated aging. Further work on the stability study of this quasi-solid-state cell at 80 °C is underway.

4. Conclusions
In summary, using a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-[4-(3-octadecylureido)phenyl]amide-based gel electrolyte in conjunction with a high-absorptivity ruthenium sensitizer C105, we have demonstrated a quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell exhibiting an impressive efficiency of 9.1% under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight. Transient absorption measurements disclose that the gel electrolyte can ensure efficient interfacial charge separation. However, electrical impedance analysis reveals that the gel electrolyte can also evoke a faster interfacial charge recombination of injected electrons and I3− ions in contrast to the liquid electrolyte, resulting in a diminished open-circuit photovoltage. Furthermore, we have proved that the high-efficiency quasi-solid-state DSC can exhibit a fairly good thermal and light-soaking stability during 1000-h accelerated aging tests. This work should boost the practical application of DSCs.
