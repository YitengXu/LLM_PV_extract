However, the observed intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 was demonstrated to decrease the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the cells. In this work, spinel lithium titanate Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) was used to alleviate this issue by consuming Li+ prior to the contact of Li+ with TiO2 at the interface between sensitized TiO2 and the hole-transport layer through the chemical insertion of Li+ into LTO. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the insertion of Li+ into LTO. A Li+ insertion peak in cyclic voltammetry and an increased density of states of TiO2 revealed the role of LTO as a Li+ separator to protect the TiO2 photoanode, providing the mechanism of VOC increase for LTO modification. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that LTO modification markedly reduced carrier recombination, improving the fill factor of the devices. Overall, the conversion efficiencies of the devices were significantly increased with a maximum efficiency of 15.1% by addition of LTO. The strategy of using LTO as a multifunctional modifier broadens the scope of interface engineering in solar cells.
1 Introduction
Methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention from material scientists and have become a research hotspot in recent years. As great effort has been expended to develop the excellent light-harvesting characteristics of perovskite materials and simplify fabrication, the efficiencies of PSCs keep soaring.1–9 To date, a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.3% has been achieved in solid-state PSCs by controlling fabrication conditions and interface engineering.9 Such advances in performance make solid-state PSCs a candidate for next-generation solar cells.10,11
An important additive to the hole-transport layer (HTL) of solid-state PSCs is lithium salt, typically bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (Li-TFSI), which is used to increase conductivity and hole mobility.3,7–9,12,13 Adding Li-TFSI increases the conductivity of the commonly used hole-transport material 2,29,7,79-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,99-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) by about three orders of magnitude, guaranteeing efficient hole transfer.13 However, research on dye-sensitized solar cells has shown that Li+ in the electrolyte can easily intercalate into mesoporous TiO2 films, xLi+ + xeTiO2− + TiO2 → LixTiO2,(1)which increases the number of trap states, broadens the density of states (DOS) and lowers the energy level of the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 anode, thereby decreasing the voltage potential.14–18 During solution-coating of hole-transport materials, Li+ would inevitably contact the mesoporous TiO2 surfaces, decreasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of devices through the same mechanism. This assumption is supported by the results of Snaith et al.13 In addition, the role of Li+ is not exclusive. There have been works on Li+ replacement involving compounds like HTFSI, BuPyIm-TFSI and AgTFSI.19–21 Therefore, strategies to both retain the hole-transfer performance in the HTL and separate Li+ from TiO2 at the sensitized TiO2/HTL interface should be considered.
In this work, we use spinel lithium titanate Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) to modify the interface between the perovskite layer and the HTL to prevent contact of Li+ with exposed TiO2 while retaining its function of ensuring hole transport in the HTL. LTO is an anode material for lithium ion batteries. Li+ can be inserted into LTO both electrochemically and chemically, while the expansion of the unit cell lattice of LTO is negligible upon insertion of lithium due to the “zero-strain” property of LTO.22–25 We confirm a chemical Li+ insertion reaction between Li-TFSI and LTO by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the interpretation of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results and the change of the DOS of TiO2 after LTO modification, we propose a Li+-separation mechanism for the VOC increase. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that LTO modification also markedly improves the fill factor (FF) of the device because of reduced carrier recombination. Overall, LTO modification markedly raises the conversion efficiencies of solar cells to reach a maximum efficiency of 15.1%.
2 Experiment
2.1 Solar cell fabrication
All chemicals were used as received. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized by mixing methylamine (27.8 mL, 40% in methanol, Alfa Aesar) and hydroiodic acid (30 mL, 57% wt% in water, Alfa Aesar) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask, and stirring the mixture in an ice-water bath for 2 h. The yellowish raw product, obtained by evaporating the solvent, was recrystallized three times from a mixture of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the solid was collected in a dark container and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. On the initial stage of optimizing the concentration of LTO solution, the compact TiO2 layer was prepared by spin-coating the TiO2 precursor solution, which was prepared by mixing titanium(IV) isopropoxide (1 mL, 99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) with 2-methoxyethanol (5 mL, 99%, Alfa Aesar) and ethanolamine (0.5 mL, 98%, Alfa Aesar), at 3000 rpm for 30 s on a cleaned FTO glass, followed by subsequent heating at 500 °C for 60 min. With the optimized results, we upgraded the compact TiO2 layer to a 15 nm one with atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods (Beneq TFS 200) to further improve the efficiency. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was deposited at 150 °C using titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and H2O as Ti and O precursors, respectively. The mesoporous TiO2 film was then deposited by spin-coating a treated TiO2 paste (18NR-T, Dysol) at 7000 rpm for 30 s, followed by sintering at 500 °C in a tube furnace for 1 h and naturally cooling to room temperature. CH3NH3PbI3 was prepared in a glovebox filled with dry air by a sequential deposition method reported previously.7 First, PbI2 (463 mg L−1, 99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) was spin-coated on the substrates at 5000 rpm for 60 s. After heating at 70 °C for 30 min and cooling, the film was immersed in the as-prepared CH3NH3I (10 mg L−1) in 2-propanol (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) for 120 s and then rinsed with 2-propanol. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer was formed after sintering for 30 min at 70 °C. The LTO-treatment process was implemented as follows: LTO (18 mg, Tianjin Lishen Co, China.) was dispersed in chlorobenzene (3 mL, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and then filtered through a 220 nm filter to give a saturated LTO solution. LTO solutions of different concentrations were then prepared by dilution of the saturated one. LTO treatment involved spin-coating the required diluted LTO solution on the prepared CH3NH3PbI3 film at 7000 rpm for 30 s. To prepare the HTL, spiro-MeOTAD (73 mg, Luminescence Technology Corp.), Li-TFSI (9.1 mg, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 37.5 μL, 96%, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to chlorobenzene (1 mL) to form a hole-transport material solution and then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Complete devices without encapsulation were fabricated by thermal evaporation of 60 nm of Au as the counter electrode. The active area of each device was 0.09 cm2.
2.2 Characterization
Raman spectra (Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution) were recorded using the green line (514.5 nm) of an argon laser (Spectra Physics). The mass ratio of element Li, S, Ti were deduced by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectra (ICP-OES, Thermo IRIS intrepid II). UV-vis spectra were carried out on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrometer. Measurements of solutions were taken in a 1 cm glass cuvette placed in a cuvette holder integrated within the setup. XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific) was conducted and analyzed by XPSPeak software. Atom force microscopy (AFM) was performed with a scanning probe microscope (SPA-400, Seiko Instruments, Japan). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. TEM grids were dipped in the relative solutions to deposit LTO nanosheets onto the film. CV, photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and EIS (0.1 to 105 Hz) were measured by an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, CIMPS). J–V curves were obtained with a scan speed of 50 mV s−1 from 1 to 0 V under 1-sun illumination conditions, AM 1.5100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight (ORIEL 81193, 1000 W Xe light source) calibrated with an NREL-calibrated silicon solar cell.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Li+ effect and insertion reaction with LTO
To determine the effect of Li-TFSI on the VOC of the perovskite-based solid-state solar cells, we fabricated cells with different Li-TFSI content in the HTL and examined their VOC, as shown in Fig. 1a. As the concentration of Li-TFSI increased, the VOC of the devices decreased. A reasonable explanation could be that inevitable contact between Li+ and the TiO2 mesoporous film occurred during the dipping and spin-coating processes. Large perovskite grains in the capping layer created a rough surface, and incomplete covering of the perovskite layer exposed surfaces of the TiO2 film,7 making it easy for Li+ to react with TiO2. A schematic diagram of the change of the DOS of TiO2 with Li+ concentration is presented in Fig. 1b to illustrate the effect of Li+ intercalation.18 The broadening of the DOS of TiO2 led to a lower CB edge and thereby a lower VOC. The optimum Li-TFSI additive content should take account of both the increase of JSC and the decrease of the VOC to ensure an overall conversion efficiency enhancement. Once we take steps to minimize the decrease of the VOC, we shall obtain a higher efficiency.

For this purpose, we added LTO to our system. As an anode material for lithium ion batteries, LTO exhibits the Li-insertion capabilities and lattice stability that we desire. Moreover, chemical Li+ insertion into LTO and superior stability of the reaction products have been demonstrated.23 We investigated the insertion of Li+ from Li-TFSI into LTO by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2a). After mixing LTO with the hole-transport material solution, which simulated the reaction environment during modification, we washed the product three times with chlorobenzene to remove any other components. The Raman spectra exhibit peaks in the wavelength range of 400–550 cm−1 from the Li–O stretching vibration in the LiO4 tetrahedron. The observation of a peak at 509 cm−1 was consistent with the coupling of a different mode of Li–O stretching vibration when Li+ was inserted into the LTO lattice.23,24 However, the intensity of this peak was relatively weak. Given that the measurement depth of Raman spectroscopy is of a submicron order, we presumed that Li+ insertion mainly happened at the LTO surface rather than the bulk area, reducing the intensity of the Raman spectroscopy results.

The insets in (a) and (c) show the magnified images of the Li–O stretching vibration regions and the oxidized spiro-MeOTAD peak at 520 nm, respectively. 
Considering that XPS is usually used to obtain information about the crystal surface area with a depth of several nanometers, we took the XPS measurements as further evidence to confirm the findings suggested by the Raman spectroscopy results. The XPS data provided clear evidence for the change of the valence state of Ti after the insertion of Li+. Fig. 2b shows the Ti 2p spectra with peaks at 458.37 and 463.98 eV from Ti(IV), and 457.12 and 461.17 eV from Ti(III).26 The TFSI− counterion was inevitably adsorbed on the surface despite washing, proved by the appearance of a F 1s peak in Fig. S1.† The inductive effect of the negatively charged TFSI− led to a slightly positive shift of the binding energy. Ti(IV) is the theoretical valence state of LTO. The amount of Li+ is always in excess in the lattice causing Ti(IV) to be partially reduced to Ti(III), which reflects the amount of exotic Li+ in the LTO lattice. We performed data fitting of the XPS results based on the Gauss function to determine the integrated peak areas. The calculated peak areas revealed that the molar ratio of Ti(III) was 7% and 12% before and after the reaction, respectively. The difference of nearly 5% is large enough to speculate that Li+ reacted easily on the crystal surface of LTO and the results gave a calculated reaction molar ratio of 1:0.6.
Moreover, we performed ICP-OES measurements on the reacted LTO and UV-vis absorption spectra of the centrifuged hole-transfer materials (HTM) solution after reaction with LTO to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism.
The results of ICP-OES revealed that after the reaction, the molar ratio of Li/Ti increased from 0.823 to 0.833, indicating a change of the element composition from Li4.12Ti5O12 to Li4.18Ti5O12 (Table S1†). That meant the overall molar ratio of inserted Li should be 1:0.06. Compared with information obtained from the Raman spectra and XPS, we believed that the insertion reaction of Li+ mainly happens on the very surface of LTO. This conclusion provided information that if we applied LTO with a structure with a large surface area, like a nanosheet etc., we would obtain a much higher reaction activity of Li+ insertion. Since we succeeded in preparing and applying LTO nanosheets, which will be discussed later, it would be more accurate to use the reaction molar ratio of 1:0.6 obtained from XPS because the thickness of the LTO nanosheet is closer to the measurement depth of XPS.
After the reaction of the LTO powder with Li-TFSI, we collected the HTM solution by centrifugation and found that it had turned orange from the original yellowish colour. We then obtained the UV-vis absorption spectra and detected a peak maxima located at around 520 nm. This absorption band results from the formation of an oxidized spiro-MeOTAD cation radical.27 It is well known that the photo-oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD needs oxygen as a p-dopant,13,28 which is also supported by the absorption spectra of HTM solutions stored in N2 and light soaking treatment in air (Fig. 2c). Since the reaction of LTO took place in N2, we believed that the reduction reaction of Ti(IV) by Li+ insertion demonstrated before was chemically driven by the oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD. The anion TFSI− could be the counter ion to stabilize the oxidized spiro-MeOTAD cation radical, as reported previously.13
Our demonstrated reaction molar ratio was 1:0.6, which differed from the ratio of 1:1.77 previously reported.23 Based on the analysis before, we attributed the reactivity difference to a different reaction driving force. Finally, we presented a Li+ insertion reaction as follows. 0.6Li+ + 0.6e− + Li4Ti5O12 → Li4.6Ti5O12(2-1) spiro-MeOTAD + TFSI− → spiro-MeOTAD˙ + TFSI− + e−(2-2)
Inspired by the fact that the surface areas exhibited higher Li+ insertion activity, we then filtered the saturated LTO solution to constrain the crystal size and obtain larger specific surface areas. The measured solid content of the saturated solution was 55 mg L−1. After coating the LTO solution on the silicon substrate, we used AFM to observe the morphology and size distribution of the LTO particles (Fig. 3a–c). The determined particle diameter distribution revealed that the LTO particles had a transverse width of 115 ± 13 nm and a vertical height of 14 ± 4 nm, suggesting that LTO had a nanosheet structure, coinciding with the size of the pores of the filters we used. The TEM image shown in Fig. 3d gave the same size information. Also, the sample exhibited a relatively low contrast, indicating a rather thin layer. Although the LTO particles were not monodisperse, such an easy way to obtain a nanosheet structure was exciting, because not only was the method simple and repeatable, but the as-prepared LTO nanosheets also exhibited a large surface area to give higher Li+ insertion activity. Unlike the smooth surface of the silicon substrate, the perovskite layer was so rough that flowing LTO nanosheets should be trapped around the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal boundaries, where TiO2 was most likely to be exposed.

3.2 Photovoltaic performance improvement with LTO modification
To demonstrate our assumption that the VOC would be increased by addition of LTO, we measured the photovoltaic characteristics of the devices treated with different concentrations of LTO solutions (Fig. 5a). As the concentration of the LTO solution increased, the VOC of the devices was raised, while the JSC and FF increased initially and then decreased. With an optimized LTO solution concentration of 14 mg L−1, the efficiencies of the PSCs were markedly improved from 8.6% to 10.8%. We then upgraded the original spin-coated compact TiO2 layer to a 15 nm film prepared by ALD methods, which substantially improved the overall conversion efficiency to 13.4% with a maximum PCE of 15.1%, compared to the control groups with efficiencies of 11.5% (a histogram of the efficiencies is shown in Fig. S3†). The schematics of the device architecture and the relative energy levels of each layer of the perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 4.

There are differences for the compact TiO2 layer preparation methods between (a) and (b), as stated in the experiment section. 

3.2.1 LTO as a Li+ separator to increase the VOC. 
To further understand the correlation between the chemical Li+ insertion reaction of LTO and the subsequent increase of the VOC, we need to study the Li+ insertion properties of the LTO nanosheets and the change of the DOS of TiO2 caused by LTO modification. Fig. 6 shows the first two cyclic voltammetry scans of the TiO2 mesoporous working electrodes treated with and without LTO nanosheets in 0.1 M LiClO4/acetonitrile. Both electrodes showed a cathodic peak from −0.7 V corresponding to the Li+ intercalation into the TiO2 electrode.15 Compared with the pristine TiO2 working electrode, a broad cathodic peak emerged from −0.2 V in the first scan of the LTO-treated electrode, indicating a rather active reductive reaction, which disappeared after the first cycle. An identical peak was observed in the CV scan of a LTO working electrode, so this peak represents a characteristic reaction of LTO (Fig. S4†). The two sequential cathodic peaks at −1.1 and −1.4 V were consistent with the electrochemical insertion of Li+, probably for two different routes of Li+ diffusion.29 This allowed us to attribute the characteristic peak of the LTO electrode at around −0.2 V to the electrochemically driven Li+ insertion reaction, coinciding with our observation of the spontaneous chemical insertion of Li+ into LTO. We concluded that the LTO nanosheets acted as Li+ separators, functioning when they were deposited onto the bare regions of TiO2 and preventing Li+ from intercalating into TiO2, despite their tendency to do so even at the low voltages generated by the fabricated PSCs under indoor light intensity. Considering that the decrease of the VOC caused by Li+ intercalation was caused by increasing traps and broadening the DOS of TiO2, we determined the change of the DOS distribution of TiO2 by extracting the chemical capacitance from the intermediate frequency region of the EIS measurements, as shown in Fig. 7. Chemical capacitance describes the capacity for charge carrier accumulation,30–32 so the capacitance of the TiO2/perovskite interface obtained from the corresponding frequency region in EIS measurements describes the carrier accumulation in TiO2, reflecting its exponential DOS.31 Reducing the content of Li+ in the HTL decreased the capacitance of TiO2, indicating a higher DOS, which coincided with a higher TiO2 CB edge and an increased VOC. Intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 caused DOS broadening and deepening because it increased the number of trap states. This was the main reason for the observed lower capacitance in the system with a small amount of Li+. LTO modification caused a similar decreasing trend of the TiO2 capacitance. Because volume shrinkage during crystallization and solvent evaporation is hard to control, especially for CH3NH3PbI3 with a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, there were numerous exposed regions on the TiO2 surfaces in direct contact with the HTL, where a large amount of Li+ could unrestrictedly intercalate into TiO2. We speculate that the LTO nanosheets were deposited on these regions during the coating process because these regions exhibited valley-like morphology. The protective effect of the LTO nanosheets on the TiO2 electrode as Li+ separators is a plausible explanation for the observed higher TiO2 DOS and VOC of the LTO-modified devices.

In addition, we used the reacted LTO (r-LTO) as a modification material to study the effect of the amount of inserted Li+ on the photovoltaic performance and the comparison results are listed in Table S2.† Compared with the control group, the r-LTO modified devices exhibited a slightly higher VOC, which confirmed a much higher Li+ blocking efficiency of the pristine LTO and provided support for our choice of LTO as a Li+ separator.


3.2.2 LTO modification to reduce recombination. 
Among all the photovoltaic parameters considered, the FF was prominently improved with LTO modification. The FF determines the maximum power generated from a solar cell and is strongly affected by the series resistance and shunt resistance of the device. The FF rapidly decreases when there are defects and severe carrier recombination. As the concentration of the LTO solution increased, the FF increased initially and then decreased. Considering the other modification materials reported before,33,34 we speculated that the LTO nanosheets acted as an insulating layer and reduced carrier recombination at the sensitized TiO2/HTL interface. The CB energy of LTO is −1.0 eV,35 which is much higher than the CB energy of CH3NH3PbI3 and the HOMO energy of HTM, indicating the ability of LTO modification materials to reduce carrier recombination. A schematic of the relative energy levels is shown in Fig. 4b. Moreover, the observed decrease of dark current in Fig. 8c is consistent with this hypothesis, because it benefited from fewer undesired shunting paths and a dark reaction.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots of EIS measurements under dark conditions with a 0.8 V bias voltage, (b) the equivalent circuit model used for EIS analysis (Rs and Rrec are the series resistance and recombination resistance of the device, respectively, CPEμ is the chemical capacitance of the films and R-CPEsc is the impedance of selective contacts), and (c) the dark current curves of the devices with (red) and without (red) LTO modification. 
To clarify the effect of LTO modification on carrier recombination, we used EIS to observe the recombination resistance of the solar cells. Fig. 8b depicts the equivalent circuit used to fit the Nyquist plots from the EIS measurements. Rrec represents the recombination resistance, which is inversely related to the recombination rate. The second R-CPE feature depicts the impedance of selective contacts (sc), including compact TiO2 for electron-selective contacts and the HTL for hole-selective contacts.36,37 Under dark conditions (Fig. 8a), the Rrec was reflected by the second arc at lower frequencies, while the first arc at high frequencies was partially presented and almost indistinguishable.38,39 For PSCs, recombination mainly occurs at the functional layer interface where electrons in the CB of TiO2 or the perovskite layer recombine with holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the HTL. After LTO modification, the recombination resistance almost doubled, indicating an effective reduction of carrier recombination. Although the LTO nanosheet layer increased the Rrec between the perovskite film and the HTL benefited from its inherent insulating properties, it would undoubtedly hinder the charge-carrier transfer as well. In view of both the recombination retarding and carrier-transport resisting caused by LTO modification, we need to find a balance point to achieve an overall benefit in efficiencies, which was also proved by the variation of the FF with LTO concentration. The optimized concentration of LTO with the largest enhancement in both the FF and JSC was determined to be 14 mg L−1. When a higher concentration of LTO solution was used, the forward carrier transport was severely impeded, triggering a large decrease in both the FF and JSC. In contrast, a lower concentration of LTO had a relatively weak ability to hinder recombination. Besides, we noticed that the r-LTO modified devices exhibited a similar FF to the LTO modified ones, indicating their similar abilities to hinder carrier recombination with the same contents, i.e. the same degree of perovskite coverage on TiO2 films. However, considering that the r-LTO modification provided little improvement in the VOC, we believe our selection of Li+ intercalating materials over insulating materials without any Li uptake ability was wise, because the former ones block Li+ more efficiently to achieve a higher VOC.
While the VOC was increased by the proposed Li+-separation mechanism and the FF was prominently reduced in carrier recombination, the JSC was increased by a negligible amount. To overcome the decrease of the VOC caused by Li+ intercalation into TiO2, the CB edge of TiO2 would shift upwards. Then the energy difference between the CB edge of TiO2 and that of perovskite would decrease, giving a smaller free energy change (−ΔGinj) and reducing the electron injection efficiency.17 This would reduce the JSC, contrary to our observations. However, the JSC was nearly unaffected and benefited from LTO effectively hindering carrier recombination (Fig. 5a).
One may wonder whether the VOC increase is attributed to the reduced recombination process rather than the proposed Li+-separation mechanism. To address this issue, we need further insight into the behavior of the VOC. Insulating materials typically retard recombination with a slight increase in the VOC, as exhibited by the r-LTO modified devices. When a larger amount of material is used, the VOC will decrease along with the FF and JSC, which is attributed to the decrease of the ISC.33 On the contrary, as the concentration of the LTO solution increased, the VOC kept increasing, indicating a continuous effect on the modified devices (Fig. 5a). This behavior can be ascribed to LTO protection, because a continuously decreasing amount of Li+ comes in contact with TiO2 as the concentration of the LTO solution increases.
In general, the LTO nanosheets exhibit sufficient Li+ uptake ability to protect TiO2 from Li+ intercalation, superior crystal lattice stability to sustain the effect during energy conversion and inherent insulating properties to achieve less carrier recombination. The strategy of using LTO as a multifunctional modifier should be paid attention because of its potential in solar-cell applications.

4 Conclusions
We demonstrated that a decrease of the VOC in hybrid perovskite solid-state solar cells is caused by Li+ intercalation into TiO2. However, this effect could be largely overcome by protecting the TiO2 anode from Li+ contact by the addition of LTO. Raman spectra and XPS results confirmed the chemical Li+ insertion reaction between Li-TFSI and LTO. We then prepared size-constrained LTO nanosheets by a simple physical exfoliation method of filtering and confirmed their roles as Li+ separators to protect the TiO2 photoanode from Li+ intercalation. Reduced contact of Li+ with TiO2 resulted in fewer trap states in the TiO2 films, leading to higher TiO2 DOS and an increased VOC of the devices with LTO modification. The interaction between Li+ and the perovskite layer remains unclear, and we are making efforts to study it. The LTO nanosheets themselves acted as an insulating layer, reducing carrier recombination and improving the FF. An optimized concentration of LTO of 14 mg L−1 was obtained, which gave a marked enhancement of performance and a maximum PCE of 15.1%. In this study, a feasible strategy of interface modification in solid-state hybrid perovskite solar cells was developed, providing the promise of multiple functions of the interface modification methods.
