    , Accepted 4th April 2022First published on 25th April 2022AbstractIonic defects in perovskite films decrease both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of a perovskite solar cell (PSC). Herein, fluorinated D-pentafluoro-phenylalanine (D-PFPAA) zwitterions are introduced into a perovskite to passivate the ionic defects and effectively consolidate the Pb–X framework to suppress ion migration. The results demonstrate that the amino, carboxyl, and fluorine groups in D-PFPAA can support the multifunctional passivation of both positive and negative ionic defects, including uncoordinated Pb2+ ions and halogen (X−) defects in the perovskites, thereby effectively suppressing charge recombination. Consequently, a D-PFPAA-modified device shows a highest PCE of 21.56% with an increased open circuit voltage of 1.15 V. Apart from the consolidated Pb–X framework, resulting from multifunctional passivation, the fluorine groups in D-PFPAA can also form an effective hydrophobic barrier to protect the perovskite film from moisture-related erosion. As a consequence, the D-PFPAA-modified device retains more than 85% of its original PCE after undergoing 500 h of aging at 45% relative humidity under ambient conditions. This work provides a promising strategy for the realization of efficient and stable PSCs via the selection of fluorinated zwitterions to passivate the ionic defects, inhibit ion migration, and protect against moisture damage.
1. Introduction
Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites have aroused widespread interest in the past decade due to their desirable properties, such as high absorption coefficients,1 tunable direct bandgaps,2 high charge carrier mobility, and long charge-carrier diffusion lengths.3–5 To date, the best certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) from a single-junction perovskite solar cell (PSC) has jumped to 25.7%.6 However, when sequential solution deposition is carried out at low temperature, during the crystallization process the imperfect lattice arrangement and periodic disturbance of atoms can cause lots of high-density defects on the surface and at grain boundaries (GBs) of the PSC, inducing charge recombination and inevitably impairing the performance of the PSC.7–12 More seriously, the existence of lots of ionic defect states can lead to ion migration and can catalyze the rotational distortion of [PbX6]4− octahedrons, subsequently accelerating the degradation of the entire perovskite film under the influence of external stress factors, such as oxygen, moisture, light, and heat.13–17
Defect passivation is considered to be an effective strategy for mitigating trap-assisted recombination and enhancing the performance of PSCs.18–21 Therefore, various passivators have been introduced to passivate defects, including Lewis base/acid molecules, inorganic salts, polymers, zwitterions, etc.22–28 For instance, Lewis-base-like thiophene or pyridine can usually act as an electron donor to support Lewis acid–base reactions with under-coordinated lead ions.29–31 Nevertheless, most of these passivators can only passivate one type of defect through ionic bonds or coordination bonds. To address this issue, the zwitterion bethanechol chloride (BTCC) has been introduced into perovskites, and this can simultaneously passivate both positive and negative ionic defects and stabilize the Pb–I framework.32 In addition, a study of D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine (D4TBP) molecules containing carboxyl, amine, and 4-tert-butylbenzene groups further emphasized the significance of passivating different kinds of defects.33 It has been proven that passivators can effectively reduce ionic defects in the perovskite layer to improve the device efficiency, and improvements in stability against the effects of water and oxygen have also been extensively studied.34–38 Cai et al. incorporated the fluorine-containing molecule 2,2-difluoropropanediamide (DFPDA) into the perovskite layer; this not only formed bridges between the perovskite layer and transport layer for efficient charge transport, but it also resulted in high hydrophobicity to improve the environmental stability of the PSC.39 Although previous studies have confirmed the benefits of zwitterions and fluorine on ionic defect passivation and stability against humidity, few studies have considered the synergistic passivation effects of fluorine and zwitterions on ionic passivation and enhancing the stability against humidity.
In this work, fluorinated D-pentafluoro phenylalanine (D-PFPAA) zwitterions with hydrophobic fluorine and zwitterionic functional groups are introduced into the perovskite precursor. It is found that small amounts of D-PPFAA can suppress PbI2 residue during the crystallization process, which reduces the trap-state density and promotes the more uniform and compact growth of perovskite grains. Multiple characterization studies confirm that a synergistic effect involving the zwitterionic group and fluorine of D-PFPAA could passivate both positive and negative ionic defects, stabilizing the Pb–X framework and inhibiting ion migration. In addition, fluorine can shorten the carrier extraction lifetime and promote charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the transport layer. Furthermore, fluorine acts as a physical barrier at the perovskite surface and GBs, and this considerably enhances the stability of PSCs against humidity. An unencapsulated device with D-PFPAA maintains more than 85% of its original PCE after undergoing 500 h of aging at 45% relative humidity (RH) under ambient conditions, while the PCE of the device without passivation falls to only 35% of the original value. Our results show that the introduction of fluorinated D-PFPAA zwitterions into a perovskite shows multiple effects, including passivating ionic defects, consolidating the Pb–X framework, and improving the stability against humidity, making it an efficacious approach for promoting PSC device performance and stability.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
FTO-coated glass substrates, lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD, 99.86%) were purchased from Advanced Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. The SnO2 colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (15% in a H2O colloidal dispersion). N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB, ≥99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.99%), and acetonitrile (99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. D-pentafluoro-phenylalanine (D-PFPAA, 99.6%) was purchased from Macklin. Cesium iodide (CsI), lead chloride (PbCl2), lead bromide (PbBr2), formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylamine bromide (MABr), methyl-ammonium (MACl), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, analytically pure), and lithium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)azanide (Li-TFSI) were obtained from Polymer Light Technology Inc.
2.2 Device fabrication
The FTO-coated glass substrates were cleaned via ultrasonic washing using anhydrous ethanol, acetone, deionized water, and anhydrous ethanol in sequence for 20 min. The N2-dried FTO substrates were treated with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min to remove residual organic matter on the surfaces, and an aqueous SnO2 layer was then prepared via a spin-coating method at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s on FTO glass. After annealing for 30 min at 150 °C, the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glovebox for subsequent processing. Perovskite films based on CsFAMA were obtained via two steps. In the first step, 600 mg of PbI2, 9 mg of PbCl2, and 16.9 mg of CsI were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF-DMSO solvent (vDMF/vDMSO = 9:1) with different concentrations of D-PFPAA, following by stirring at 70 °C on a heating plate; then, PbI2 precursor solution was prepared on the SnO2 layer at 1500 rpm for 30 s with annealing at 70 °C for 10 s. For the second step, 60 mg of FAI, 6 mg of MACl, and 6 mg of MABr mixed powder were dissolved in IPA, and the organic cation precursor solution was prepared on the PbI2 film at 1500 rpm for 30 s. The film gradually turned black after 15 min of thermal annealing. Afterwards, the hole transport layer (HTL) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. For comparison, MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution with or without D-PFPAA was prepared via mixing PbI2 (553.2 mg) and MAI (190.8 mg) in 1 mL of DMF, with or without different concentrations of D-PFPAA, and this was then spin-coated on a SnO2 substrate at 3000 rpm for 20 s. 80 μL of CB was dropped onto the substrate in the 9th second of spin coating, and the obtained film was thermally annealed for 20 min at 100 °C. 72.3 mg of Spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in CB (1 mL) doped with 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (Li-TFSI:acetonitrile = 520 mg mL−1) and 28.8 μL of tBP, and this was deposited on top as a HTL. Finally, a 90 nm Ag anode with an active area of 0.08 cm2 was deposited on the HTL using a magnetron sputtering deposition system (JGP-450A).
2.3 Device characterization
Perovskite film surfaces and cross-section morphologies were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 650 FEG) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM, KEYSIGHT Technologies 7500). X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX-2700B X-ray diffractometer) studies were carried out to investigate the perovskite crystal structure via using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) as the X-ray source. A fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 1000, Edinburgh Instruments) was used to carry out photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS Ultra DLD) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were performed using Nicolet 6700 apparatus. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using an EQE measurement system (PVE300, Bentham, Inc.). The device performance was tested with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, CH Instruments) using an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Zolix, 150ss).
3. Results and discussion
Herein, we introduce the novel fluorinated zwitterion D-PFPAA into a perovskite to simultaneously passivate the ionic defects and prolong the stability. The crystalline states of perovskite films with different concentrations of D-PFPAA are studied via X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1a. As the peak intensity of the perovskite (110) phase is enhanced, the corresponding lead iodide phase peak is decreased. The reason is that a synergistic effect from zwitterions and fluorine functional groups in D-PPFAA inhibits the formation of PbI2.40 Moreover, new peaks do not appear and peak shifts do not occur, indicating that D-PFPAA molecules are not incorporated into the perovskite lattice, only existing at the perovskite surface or at GBs.41 As verified via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. 1b), the control perovskite film exhibits a peak from CO stretching vibrations at 1712 cm−1, which shifts to 1732 cm−1 after D-PFPAA modification, while the N–H stretching vibration peak at 3413 cm−1 moves to 3451 cm−1. The N–H stretching vibration peak exhibits an obvious shift, suggesting strong interactions between the amino group of D-PFPAA and the Pb–X framework. In addition, a new vibration peak from C–F bonds at 1345 cm−1 is observed, which indicates that fluorine could interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ to effectively consolidate the Pb–X framework.42 All this evidence indicates that D-PPFAA has been successfully incorporated into the perovskite and undergoes chemical interactions with the perovskite.

(f) 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of D-PFPAA and a mixture of D-PFPAA with PbI2 in DMSO-d6 solution. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is further used to detect the surface elements of the perovskite layers. As shown in Fig. S1,† an additional F 1s peak is observed in the modified film, revealing the presence of D-PFPAA in the perovskite film, which is in accordance with the FTIR results. As Fig. 1c displays, the binding energies of the Pb 4f peaks shift to lower energies after D-PFPAA modification compared with the control sample, indicating a change in the electron cloud density around the Pb atoms. This shift may be due to chelation between D-PFPAA (CO and C–F bonds) and uncoordinated Pb2+, suppressing defects on the perovskite surface and at GBs. It can be seen in Fig. 1d that the characteristic F 1s peak of the D-PFPAA-modified perovskite film shifts to a higher binding energy, demonstrating chemical binding between the electron-rich F atoms of D-PFPAA and electron-deficient Pb2+ in the perovskite film.43 As depicted in Fig. 1e, the I 3d XPS peaks of the D-PFPAA modified film also shift to lower energies. The shift of the I 3d peaks may be attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between amino groups and iodine, which could immobilize I− and thus slow the crystallization rate.44 These results confirm the multifunctional passivation effects of the amino, carboxyl, and fluorine functional groups of D-PFPAA toward both positive and negative ionic defects in perovskites, which could suppress nonradiative recombination and ion migration via consolidating the Pb–X framework. To further illustrate the multifunctional passivation mechanism of fluorinated zwitterions, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of D-PFPAA and a mixture of D-PFPAA and PbI2 dissolved in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6, 0.6 mg mL−1) were obtained (Fig. 1f). It can be seen from the 1H-NMR spectra that significant chemical shifts occur in the sample of PbI2 containing D-PFPAA, further indicating the existence of hydrogen bonding (N–H⋯I) interactions between the amino groups and the halide ions in [PbX6]4− octahedrons. These interactions could consolidate the corner-sharing [PbX6]4− octahedral network and effectively reduce the diffusion of I−, thereby stabilizing the α-phase perovskite and improving the stability of the device. The 13C spectrum of D-PFPAA + PbI2 shows a higher chemical shift relative to the D-PFPAA sample, indicating that the CO groups of D-PFPAA can act with the extremely electronegative F atoms to passivate Pb2+ defects. These results are consistent with the above XPS characterization data.
The spin-coating process used to obtain the D-PFPAA-modified perovskite film, the PSC device structure, and a diagram of the interactions occurring in the perovskite are shown in Fig. 2. The incorporation of D-PFPAA into the precursor solution is found to ameliorate the crystalline morphology of the resulting perovskite film. The truth is that hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and the Pb–X framework can lead to cross-linking between adjacent perovskite grains, inducing the preferential orientation and uniform growth of the perovskite.45Fig. 3a–d presents top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskites with different concentrations of D-PFPAA. In comparison with the control film, the modified perovskite film exhibits a compact morphology with a significantly decreased number of pinholes and enlarged perovskite grains (Fig. S2†). Therefore, GBs are reduced and the uniformity of the perovskite is improved.46 In addition, cross-section SEM images further illustrate this phenomenon, showing that a dense and uniform perovskite is achieved in the case of the modified film (Fig. S3†). Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images are displayed in Fig. 3e–h. In comparison with the control film, the modified film demonstrates lower roughness, which is consistent with the SEM results. Moreover, the modified perovskite film shows a higher surface potential, which can be characterized using the contact potential difference (CPD). The CPD is related to the work function of the sample surface, as shown in eqn (1): (1)where Wtip is the work function of the probe tip, Wsample is the surface work function of the sample, and e is the electric charge. Wtip for a Pt/Cr-coated probe tip is obtained based on a Au sample (Wtip = 5.1 eV). As shown in Fig. 3g and h, the CPD value increases from 393.5 mV to 573.8 mV after D-PFPAA modification. Thus, the calculated Wsample value is decreased from 4.71 eV to 4.53 eV, correspondingly, which could promote the open circuit voltage (VOC) of a PSC. Before investigating the effects of D-PFPAA modification on the optical properties, we speculate that the enhancement of grain size and crystallinity could enhance the absorption. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra are shown in Fig. S4,† and the results show that the absorption intensity is enhanced in the region from 300 to 550 nm. This phenomenon might be due to the formation of porous and rough PbI2 nanostructures after the thermal annealing of D-PFPAA-modified PbI2 layers, as shown in Fig. S5,† resulting in increased light scattering.47 The porous and rough PbI2 film morphology not only improves the surface morphology of the perovskite film, but it also facilitates the more complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. This result agrees with the SEM and XRD characterization results for the perovskite films.

To investigate the decrease of the trap-state density and the improvement of interfacial charge transfer in the modified films, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra are measured, and the results are summarized in Table S1.† When studying perovskite films with an electron transport layer (ETL), the PL intensity of the D-PFPAA-modified film decreases (Fig. 4a), which indicates that D-PFPAA could improve charge transport via ionic-defect passivation. A double exponential decay model is used in relation to the TRPL spectra to fit the data, and the average photoluminescence decay times are calculated. As shown in Fig. 4b, obvious quenching is observed after D-PFPAA modification, and the charge-carrier extraction lifetime (τ1 = 5.22 ns; τ2 = 607.26 ns) is shorter than that of the control sample (τ1 = 5.97 ns; τ2 = 264.75 ns). These results suggest that D-PFPAA helps to promote charge transfer from the perovskite light-absorption layer to the transport layer, followed by the inhibition of interfacial charge recombination.

Charge recombination caused by various defects in perovskite films has a profound impact on the extraction and transport of charge carriers in perovskite films. Therefore, it is crucial to study the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots of PSCs with and without D-PFPAA based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark mode. In general, the spectra consist of low frequency arcs and high frequency arcs as the two main areas. The low-frequency region relates to the charge transport capacitance (Cct) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), representing the transmission process. The high-frequency region consists of recombination capacitance (Crec) and recombination resistance (Rrec), representing the recombination process.48Rct and Rrec can be obtained based on a circuit model, and the modified film demonstrates lower Rct and higher Rrec values compared with the control film. This shows that D-PFPAA modification can effectively prevent charge recombination and enhance charge transport. To further illustrate the changes in defect state density, we conducted space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis based on the electron-only device configuration of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 4d). The defect state density (Ntrap) can be related to the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL), as shown in eqn (2): (2)where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, e is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film obtained from a cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S3†), which is ∼530 nm for both the control and modified films.49 The Ntrap value for the control film is 9.98 × 1015 cm−3, and this is reduced to 7.02 × 1015 cm−3 after D-PFPAA modification. The significantly reduced Ntrap value originates from the multifunctional passivation of Pb2+/I− ionic defects upon D-PFPAA modification. As mentioned in relation to the above XPS measurements, empty-orbital-based chemical complexation at the interface between electron-rich C–F groups and Pb2+ can effectively reduce Ntrap, which could lead to a high VOC value and fill factor (FF) in PSCs.50 The corresponding electron mobility also increases from 9.37 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 11.86 cm2 V−1 s−1. The enhanced electron mobility is due to the formation of high-quality perovskite film with increased grain size and decreased grain boundaries after D-PFPAA modification, which is also consistent with the corresponding higher short-circuit current (JSC) and FF values.

Fig. 5a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of CsFAMA-based devices with different D-PFPAA concentrations in response to standard sunshine intensity (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2); the associated photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In particular, the JSC, VOC, and FF values of the devices are all enhanced after D-PFPAA modification. The highest PCE of 21.56% is accompanied by a VOC value of 1.154 V, a JSC value of 23.50 mA cm−2, and a FF of 79.5% for the device modified with 0.6 mg mL−1 D-PFPAA, compared with a PCE of 19.42%, VOC value of 1.128 V, JSC value of 23.20 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.2% for the control device. The PCE and photocurrent stabilities of PSCs measured at the maximum power point (MPP) are shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† MPP characterization is tested in response to simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiance at 100 mW cm−2 in a glovebox filled with N2 without a UV filter. After 5000 s of light irradiation, the modified device maintained an initial PCE of 95%. In addition, the photocurrent of the control device tends to drop quickly compared with the modified device. These results demonstrate the superior operational stability of D-PFPAA-modified PSCs. Fig. 5b exhibits the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated JSC values of control and modified devices. The EQE values of the modified device are higher than those of the control device over the entire spectral range. Specifically, the integrated JSC value of the D-PFPAA-modified PSC is 22.22 mA cm−2, while that of the control device is 21.51 mA cm−2. Fig. S8† shows that all devices display good repeatability and effectively improved photovoltaic parameters. Furthermore, MAPbI3 is considered to have higher sensitivity to the processing conditions and more defects compared to CsFAMA-based PSCs. Therefore, we introduced D-PFPAA into a MAPbI3 device, and the best PCE of the MAPbI3-based device improved from 17.23 to 19.80% after modification (Fig. S9†), exhibiting a consistent experimental trend to that of the CsFAMA-based device. The associated photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† The integrated JSC values for the MAPbI3 devices are in line with the JSC values measured via J–V testing: 20.91 and 22.07 mA cm−2 for the control and modified devices, respectively (Fig. S10†).

As device performance is greatly affected by environmental factors (such as humidity and oxygen), it is critical to evaluate the environmental stability of a PSC. We illustrate that an unencapsulated D-PFPAA-modified device can retain over 90% of its original PCE after 1000 h of storage in a glovebox filled with N2 at room temperature (∼20 °C) protected from light (measured under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiance at 100 mW cm−2 without a UV filter), while the control device drops to 70% of its original PCE (Fig. 5c). The enhanced stability is due to the reduction of defects, the stable crystal structure, and the increased hydrophobicity of the modified perovskite film. These results encourage us to further study the stability of unencapsulated devices toward humidity under ambient conditions at 45% RH and room temperature. As presented in Fig. 5d, the modified device exhibits considerable stability toward humidity. It also can be seen from the inset of Fig. 5d that the contact angle increased from 43.9° to 58.1° after D-PFPAA modification, indicating that fluorine groups in D-PFPAA could act as a moisture barrier to inhibit the penetration of moisture into the perovskite. In addition, strong interactions between D-PFPAA and the perovskite could increase the energy barrier to [PbX6]4− octahedral rotation, consolidating the Pb–X framework and thus enhancing the stability toward humidity.13
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, fluorinated D-PFPAA zwitterions with multifunctional groups are introduced into perovskites, and they effectively optimize the PSC device performance and stability toward humidity. The results show that chemical bonding between D-PFPAA and the perovskite can suppress the formation of PbI2, which could increase the perovskite grain size and crystallinity, resulting in denser, smoother, and more preferentially oriented perovskite grains. In particular, a synergistic effect involving the zwitterionic and fluorine groups of D-PFPAA could passivate both positive and negative ionic defects, stabilizing the Pb–X framework and thus suppressing ion migration and charge recombination. As a consequence, the D-PFPAA-modified device shows a maximum PCE of 21.56% with improved VOC and FF values. Furthermore, the hydrophobic fluorine groups on D-PFPAA can also serve as a physical barrier to improve the stability toward humidity. Therefore, the modified device still retained 85% of its original PCE after undergoing 500 h of aging under ambient conditions at 45% RH. This work provides new guidelines for the ionic passivation and Pb–X framework consolidation of hybrid perovskites, helping to realize highly efficient and stable PSCs.
