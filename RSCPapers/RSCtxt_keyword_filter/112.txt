    , Accepted 28th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractSimultaneously improving the charge transfer and suppressing the charge recombination at the interface is essentially important for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). To achieve this goal, in this work, we modify the anode interface of PVSCs with a ligand, bithiophenethylammonium iodide (2TEAI), which comprises both long-conjugation bithiophene and ammonium groups. With 2TEAI, high-performance FAPbI3 (FA: HC(NH2)2) based PVSCs with significantly increased efficiency from 21.7% to 23.6% have been demonstrated for small area devices, as well as 21.3% for large-area (2.25 cm2) devices. Comprehensive analysis of the carrier dynamics and first-principles simulations unveils that the 2TEAI modification can (1) enhance the interfacial charge transfer due to energy level alignment between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the perovskite valence band, and (2) mitigate the charge recombination by passivating the trap states owing to its strong chemical interaction perovskite layer and reduction of Pb0. Our work demonstrates a reliable strategy to optimize the interface and paves the way toward high-performance PVSCs for commercialization.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are emerging as a promising technology to harvest solar energy in the future, and have drawn intensive attention due to their merits including low cost, ease of fabrication, superior optoelectronic properties, etc.1–11 In the past decade, the device performance of PVSCs has surged from 3% to 25.7%, owing to the systematic optimization of composition, morphology, interfaces, device structure, etc.12–19 As a thin film photovoltaic technique, the interface plays an important role in PVSCs, and determines the device performance and polarity of PVSCs.
A good perovskite/electrode interface should have the least defects to minimize the surface charge recombination, and be energetically well-aligned and strongly coupled for efficient photo-carrier collection.20–24 However, as a matter of fact, the polycrystalline nature of perovskite films results in a significant number of defects at the interface and induces excessive surface charge recombination. This dramatically decreases the potential of the photo-carriers and reduces the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the overall device performance.25–28 In the meanwhile, the high charge collection efficiency is typically limited by the hetero-interface of mismatched energy levels or the inhomogeneous heterojunction at the interface, which affects the fill factor (FF) and the short-circuit current density (JSC).
Thus, effective interface modification is vital for the fabrication of highly efficient PVSCs.28–30 To reach this goal, on one hand, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to passivating the perovskite/transport layer interface via a variety of passivating agents, including inorganic layers, polymers, small molecules, ionic liquids, low dimensional perovskites, etc.1,31–34 Mechanisms underlying these passivation effects include the amending of physical defect sites by changing the chemical environments, charge back-scattering, etc. For example, treating the perovskite layer surface with small molecules or polymers containing electron-donating functional groups, e.g. –NH2, –SH, and –SO3−, has been widely explored as an effective strategy.35 Notably, the fabrication of 2D/3D heterojunctions, which combined the merits of high efficiency of 3D perovskites and high stability of 2D perovskites, has been evidenced as a promising tactic for interface modification.36–39 For example, Seok et al. demonstrated that an alkylammonium iodide (AAI) modified surface can enable a certified efficiency of 22.9% based on the p–i–n device structure.40 Further, the versatility of bottom anode modification of p–i–n structure PVSCs with a variety of 2D spacers has been demonstrated in our recent work.41 Interestingly, You et al. found that a 2D spacer serves as an effective passivator before converting into a 2D structure, and obtained a certified efficiency of 23.3%.42
On the other hand, enhancing the charge collection is another key, which is highly relied on for tuning the interfacial energy level alignments, the physical contact, and the chemical interactions at the electrode interface.43–46 Bridging the perovskite layer with an electrode or charge transporting layer with chemical bonds of various types has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy. For example, the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been demonstrated to be an effective way to achieve strong electronic coupling and high charge collection efficiency for PVSCs.30,47–49 Moreover, modifying the interface by using SAMs with conjugation segments can further facilitate the charge collection. For example, Cao et al. modified the perovskite surface with a large-conjugation porphyrin-based ammonium salt and achieved over 22% efficiency.26 Further, a 2D spacer has also been demonstrated to be an effective interface modifier to increase the interfacial electronic coupling, via the formation of a cascade energetic landscape.41
An ideal interfacial modifier is expected to simultaneously passivate the defects and enhance charge collection. In this context, the use of a 2D spacer with long conjugation provides a feasible strategy, for the conjugation part can form good energy level alignment to bridge the photo-active layer and the electrode, while the formation of a 2D component and the coordination of the conjugation segment and/or the ammonium group with the perovskite layer can passivate the defects.50–53 Moreover, the conjugated ligand can deliver high tolerance to the capping condition and capping layer thickness, due to their good electrical conductance.1,54 This makes this group of materials very promising for interfacial modification, but seems less explored in PVSCs, as limited by the availability of suitable conjugated 2D spacers.55
To explore the potential of conjugated 2D spacers, unveil their working mechanism, and enrich the material pool, we have designed and synthesized a conjugated 2D spacer salt, i.e. bithiophenethylammonium iodide (2TEAI, molecular structure shown in Fig. 1a), which contains a bithiophene and an ethyl ammonium substituent. Encouragingly, surface modification with 2TEAI enables significant improvement in PCE from 21.7% to 23.6% for the FA1−xMAxPbI3 PVSCs (FA: HC(NH2)2, MA: CH3NH3), due to the suppressed surface charge recombination and improved charge collection at the anode interface. Moreover, the 2TEAI modified PVSCs exhibit an efficiency of 21.32% on an up-scaled device area of 2.25 cm2. Besides, the 2TEAI-modified 3D perovskite device also exhibits superior long-term stability, retaining 90% of the initial PCE after 2000 h aging in a N2 glovebox. Further investigations on the surface optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics suggest that 2TEAI could serve as an effective passivating agent by mitigating the Pb0 and chemical doping with specific interaction between 2TEAI and the perovskite film, as supported by molecular dynamics simulations. In the meanwhile, the good energy level alignment between the perovskite valence band and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) further enables good electronic coupling at the interface for efficient charge collection.

Experimental
Materials
All commercial materials were used as received without further purification. Lead iodide (PbI2), formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), bithiophene (2T), butylamine iodide (BAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (LiTFSI), and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD) were all purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology, China. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol alcohol (IPA), and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. ITO substrate was purchased from Hua Nan Xiang Cheng Co., Ltd. 2TEAI was synthesized according to the process listed in the ESI.†
Device fabrication
Patterned ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultra-sonication with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA), respectively. Before use, the ITO substrates were further cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 30 min. Then the electron transport layer (ETL) was formed by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 colloids (3%, diluted with water) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. Besides, for better surface wetting, the substrate was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min.
The perovskite film FA1−xMAxPbI3 was deposited using a two-step spin-coating method. For depositing the PbI2 films, 1.5 M PbI2 in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with a volume ratio of 9:1 was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in a N2 atmosphere, and then cooled to room temperature. For the second step, a solution containing FAI (90 mg), MAI (6.39 mg), MACl (9 mg), and isopropanol (IPA) (1 ml) was spun on the PbI2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s in a N2 atmosphere, and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in the ambient air atmosphere (30–40% humidity). For the 2TEAI passivation layer, the 2TEAI/isopropanol solution with different concentrations was spin-coated onto the FAMAPbI3 perovskite surface (5000 rpm, 30 s), followed by annealing at 70 °C for 1 min.
After the preparation of perovskite films, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution, which consisted of 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) stock solution (520 mg LiTFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 1 ml chlorobenzene, was deposited on top of the perovskite layer at a spin rate of 3000 rpm as the hole transport layer (HTL). Finally, a 60 nm thick Au electrode was thermally evaporated to complete the fabrication of small devices.
Characterization of the films and devices
Morphologies were acquired by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), with an acceleration voltage of 3 kV and 20 kV, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films were obtained on a Rigaku D/max-2550 PC X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) as the X-ray source. Absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2450 UV-Vis Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra for the perovskite films were obtained using an FLSP920 spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 470 and 500 nm, respectively. Atomic force microscopy measurements were carried out on an AFM apparatus (Agilent SPM 5500) with a conductive probe. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe III with a He I source (21.22 eV) under an applied negative bias of 9.0 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on an Omicron Sphera II instrument.
The current–voltage (J–V) and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) performance of the photovoltaic cells was examined with a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A) under AM 1.5 G standard light equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter and the light intensity was calibrated by a certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech). The active area was determined by the certified aperture shade masks (0.05979 cm2) placed in front of the solar cells. The J–V measurements were carried out in a nitrogen glovebox. The devices were measured both in the reverse scan (1.2 V → 0 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (0 V → 1.2 V, step 0.02 V). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an Enlitech EQE measurement system.
Calculation method
First-principles calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the VASP code.56–58 The exchange–correlation potential was described within the generalized gradient approximation formulated by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).59 Following the experimental setup, three types of FAPbI3 surface slabs, i.e., no adsorption on the surface and adsorption of the 2TEAI molecule or 2T molecule on the surface, were built while the thickness of the vacuum layer was set to 20 Å. An energy cutoff of 400 eV and Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV was used for all computations. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes were respectively chosen as 8 × 8 × 8 and 4 × 4 × 1 for the bulk and surface models of FAPbI3.60 The convergence criterion for the ionic relaxation was set such that the force on every atom was less than 5 meV Å−1.
Results and discussion
Adopting single photovoltaic performance
The synthesis of 2TEAI is presented in the ESI,† and the basic information on 2TEAI is included in Fig. S1 (ESI†). To examine the effect of 2TEAI modification on photovoltaic performance, an n–i–p planar heterojunction PVSC (indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/perovskite/(2TEAI)/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 1a) is adopted. The device area is 0.0925 cm2 as defined by the overlapping area of the ITO bar and the silver grid, and an aperture of 0.05979 cm2 (certified at the National Institute of Methodology) is used to accurately characterize the device performance. More details regarding the device fabrication and measurements can be found in the Experimental section. The J–V characteristics of the PVSCs are shown in Fig. 1b, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The champion control device (without 2TEAI) reaches a PCE of 21.74%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, JSC of 24.57 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.803 (Fig. 1b). After 2TEAI modification, the device exhibits much-improved performance, with the best PCE of 23.59%, which is mainly attributed to VOC improvement from 1.11 to 1.16 V and JSC improvement from 24.57 to 25.27 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1b). To the best of our knowledge, this device represents one of the best among PVSCs processed with two-step processing. The histogram of photovoltaic parameters from over 10 devices was counted and is shown in Fig. 1c. The PVSCs with 2TEAI modification exhibit an average PCE of 23.39% with a standard deviation of 0.18%, while the control devices exhibit an average PCE of 21.39% with a standard deviation of 0.21%. This confirms the effect of 2TEAI modification for enhancing the device performance of PVSCs. The narrower device efficiency distribution verified that the surface modification can improve the reproducibility of PVSCs. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 2TEAI in modifying the anode interface for PVSCs. We further investigated the effect of 2TEAI on the up-scaled PVSCs with a device area of 2.25 cm2. As shown in Fig. 1d, with 2TEAI modification, the best PCE of 21.32% was reached, and this constitutes a significant improvement compared to that without 2TEAI modification (19.14%). This result demonstrates the potential of 2TEAI for up-scaling applications.

Further, the steady power output (SPO) curves of the PVSCs with and without 2TEAI modification were studied, as shown in Fig. 1e. The devices with and without 2TEAI-modification are biased at their respective maximum power voltages of 0.88 and 0.94 V, and the PCEs of the corresponding devices are stabilized at 21.32% and 23.25% for a testing period of 600 s with negligible fluctuation. Under short-circuit conditions, it is found that JSC can remain stable at 24.23 and 24.87 mA cm−2 for PVSCs without and with 2TEAI modification, respectively, during the same testing period. These results are in good agreement with the values measured from the J–V curves, validating the reliability of our device performance and confirming the effect of 2TEAI modification. Further, the effect of 2TEAI modification on the long-term stability of PVSCs is assessed by storing the devices without encapsulation in a N2 glovebox (H2O <10 ppm, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the devices with 2TEAI modification exhibit good stability, and can still maintain 90% of their initial efficiency for over 2000 h. For a comparison, the PCE of the control devices drops to 40% of their initial efficiency, indicating improved device stability of PVSCs after 2TEAI surface modification. Besides, we also carried out stability testing against the ambient environment (relative humidity: 50%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). As displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the devices with 2TEAI modification display less color change than the control ones after storing for 60 days.

Fig. 1f shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PVSCs with and without 2TEAI modification. The EQE of the PVSC with 2TEAI modification exhibits a higher photon to electron response over that of the PVSC without 2TEAI modification. Integrating the EQE spectra with the solar spectrum (AM 1.5G) yields JSC-int of 24.39 and 24.97 mA cm−2 for the control and 2TEAI-modified devices, respectively. These results agree well with the Jsc from the J–V curves measured under the solar simulator and complete the internal self-check for the validity of our device performance report. Moreover, it seems that the 2TEAI modified PVSCs exhibit improved EQE over almost the entire absorbing region. This suggests that it is the improvement in internal quantum efficiency (IQE) or carrier dynamics, rather than any optical effects, that contributes to the improved EQE or JSC after 2TEAI modification.
For a comparison, we also used bithiophene (2T) and butylamine iodide (BAI) for perovskite surface treatment to study the individual role of bithiophene and ammonium groups. The basic molecular structure of 2T is included in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The device performance after either 2T or BAI modification showed inferior performance compared with the 2TEAI modified device (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI,† and Table 1). This indicates the synergistic roles of bithiophene and ammonium groups for anode interface modification and device performance improvement.
Morphology
To figure out the mechanism underlying the improved device performance, the effect of 2TEAI modification on the morphology of the perovskite film has been studied. Firstly, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the diffraction peaks for the perovskite with 2TEAI treatment are almost the same as for the control film except for a new diffraction peak consistent with the diffraction pattern for the pristine 2TEAI film. These results indicate that 2TEAI itself functions as an interfacial modifier rather than forming the 2D or quasi-2D structure. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the plane and cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite films without or with 2TEAI modification. Both perovskite films without and with 2TEAI modification exhibit a thickness close to 750 nm, and their absorption spectra exhibit a very small difference (Fig. S9, ESI†), indicating the identical light trapping properties in PVSCs without or with 2TEAI modification. This further confirms that the origin of increased EQE or JSC is from an enhancement in IQE or the carrier dynamics processes after 2TEAI modification. The similar grain size observed from the top surface of the perovskite films without or with modification further excludes the possibility of morphology improvement for better device efficiency after 2TEAI modification. Besides, based on the atomic force microscopy results (Fig. S10, ESI†), the roughness of the perovskite layer after the 2TEAI modification was reduced from 23.5 to 17.1 nm, indicating that 2TEAI tends to fill the grain boundary to reduce the valley-to-peak height for a smoother surface. In all, these results suggest that morphology evolution is not the key underlying the working mechanism of 2TEAI modification.
Defect passivation
One of the most prominent improvements after the 2TEAI modification is VOC (from 1.11 V to 1.16 V). From the photovoltaic device physics, the VOC is purely determined by the bandgap and charge recombination properties, i.e. radiative charge recombination above the bandgap or below the bandgap, and the non-radiative charge recombination via the trap state at the grain boundary or surface. Considering the unchanged bandgap (EQE spectra, Fig. 1f), it is concluded that the charge recombination is suppressed at the anode interface or grain boundary. To figure out the passivation effect of 2TEAI, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were performed to quantitatively study the trap states, according to the Mott–Gurney law. The electron-only device (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/(2TEAI)/PCBM/Ag) and hole-only device (ITO/NiOX/perovskite/(2TEAI)/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag) were prepared to examine the trap states for electrons and holes, respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the linear region with a slope of around 1 for log(J)–log(V) at a low bias is defined as the ohmic region (first region). With the voltage increasing, the slope begins to deviate from 1 to a higher value, and this range is defined as the trap-filling region (second region). Onset voltage for transiting from the ohmic region to the trap-filling region is defined as the trap-filled-limit voltage (VTFL).27 The trap density Ntrap was obtained according to the following equation (eqn (1)): VTFL= qNtrapd2/2εε0(1)where VTFL represents the trap-filled-limit voltage, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and q is the electron elementary charge, respectively.27,61 From Fig. 2a, the VTFL values derived from the log(J)–log(V) curves are 0.33 V and 0.31 V for the electron-only devices without or with 2TEAI modification, respectively, corresponding to electron trap densities of 3.4 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.2 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The hole trap densities are calculated to be 3.3 × 1015 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.32 V) and 2.6 × 1015 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.25 V), respectively, for hole-only devices without and with 2TEAI modification. Thereafter, it is obvious that the surface modification with 2TEAI can effectively passivate the surface via mitigating the hole trap density, and this contributes to the improvement in VOCvia suppressing the non-radiative charge recombination mediated by trap states.

(e and f) Dependences of (e) Voc and (f) Jsc on light intensity (Plight) for the control device, 2TEAI-modified device, and 2T-modified device. 
Carrier dynamics
Besides VOC increment, the photocurrent (J) is also improved after 2TEAI modification, and these are highly relevant for the internal carrier dynamics, i.e. charge transport, charge recombination, and interfacial transit. To examine the influence of 2TEAI on carrier dynamics, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded, as shown in Fig. 2c. Compared to the control perovskite film, the PL intensity of the film with 2TEAI modification increases apparently, implying suppression of the non-radiative recombination, in agreement with the reduced hole trap state density from the SCLC measurement. The decreased PL intensity after 2T modification might be a compromise between charge transfer and trap state modification. Further, we studied the effect of charge transfer at the anode interface by depositing the hole transporting layer, i.e. Spiro-OMeTAD, on top of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2d, for the perovskite film with 2TEAI modification, the intensity is lower than that of the control. Considering the passivation effect of 2TEAI, the above results suggest a stronger charge transfer between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD after 2TEAI modification. This can be explained by the charge transfer at the perovskite–2T interface, due to the electrical activity of the 2T molecule. As a result, it is implied that the ammonium part of 2TEAI mainly contributes to surface passivation, while the 2T part primarily contributes to the charge separation. Besides, according to the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. S12, ESI†), the carrier lifetime of the perovskite is significantly decreased from 1.52 μs to 0.78 μs, and the hole extraction from perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD is enhanced twofold after 2TEAI treatment, which is consistent with the improved photon to electron conversion or Jsc in PVSCs after 2TEAI modification.
Further charge recombination and extraction behavior in the PVSCs with and without 2TEAI/2T modification were studied via the light intensity-dependent optoelectronic response, as shown in Fig. 2e and f. It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.64 kT e−1, while the 2TEAI-treated device shows a smaller slope (1.52 kT e−1) (Fig. 2e). It is demonstrated that deviation of the slope reflects more defect-assisted recombination in the devices.9 Therefore, the above results further indicated that the recombination has largely been suppressed in the perovskite layer.42 Besides, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) can be described as JSC ∝ Plightα and α = 1 represents the ideal charge extraction with minimal bimolecular recombination. The calculated α values of PVSCs without and with 2TEAI/2T modification are found to be 0.981, 0.991, and 0.986, respectively, confirming the improved charge transfer under short-circuit conditions after the 2TEAI modification (Fig. 2f).
Further, the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were measured to study the photo-carrier dynamics, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The slower TPV decay has been observed in PVSCs with 2TEAI modification. This suggests less charge recombination under the quasi-flat band conditions, which validates the passivation effects and is consistent with the SCLC and PL results. Meanwhile, the faster charge transit time from TPC measurement for PVSCs after 2TEAI modification verifies efficient charge collection, which suggests good electronic coupling at the anode interface and well explains the improved photocurrent generation.62,63 These results further confirm that the 2TEAI could effectively passivate the perovskite GBs/surface and increase the electronic coupling at the interface, and thereby contribute to reducing the defect density and high charge collection efficiency.
Surface properties
To figure out the chemical origin underlying the passivation effect and improvement in charge transfer with Spiro-OMeTAD, the surface properties of the perovskite film without or with 2TEAI modification have been first investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The C, N, S and I XPS spectra of the perovskite films with or without 2TEAI modification are shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†). The peaks with binding energy (BE) of 165.2 and 164.1 eV can be assigned to S 2p, which obviously exist on the perovskite surface with 2TEAI modification, but can be hardly detected in the control film. This confirms the existence of 2TEAI on the perovskite surface. Interestingly, the peak with a binding energy of 288.1 eV, associated with the CO peak caused by oxygen/moisture intrusion, completely disappeared after 2TEAI modification. This suggests that 2TEAI makes the perovskite film less vulnerable to humidity, which is further confirmed by contact angle measurements as shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). This result well explains the improved device stability in ambient air after 2TEAI modification (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XPS peaks at 143 and 138.2 eV are assigned to 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 of Pb2+, respectively, and the lower BE peaks at 141.3 and 136.4 eV are associated with the neutral state Pb0 (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, from the XPS (Fig. 3b), the Pb0/(Pb0 + Pb2+) ratio decreases from 8.8% to 2% on the perovskite film after 2TEAI modification. Pb0 has been demonstrated to induce traps for non-radiative decay, and thus, mitigation of Pb0 with 2TEAI might be one of the mechanisms contributing to the passivation effect.20–22 And the reduced Pb0 content with 2TEAI deposition can be attributed to the strong interaction between Pb2+ and 2TEAI, as confirmed from the simulation results.42,64

(c) UPS spectra of the control and 2TEAI-modified perovskite films. (d) Energy-level scheme of the control and 2TEAI-modified perovskite films. 
Next, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to measure the surface band structure with and without 2TEAI modification (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3d displays the energy level structures of the perovskite films with and without 2TEAI modification derived from the UPS measurements. After 2TEAI modification, the EF is moved up by 0.72 eV, which is beneficial to form a better band alignment with the Spiro-OMeTAD. This further helps to improve the hole extraction at the anode interface. Also, the VB of the perovskite film is increased by 0.64 eV, suggesting the formation of a band bending structure, which blocks the electron by forming a back-scattering electric field.
First-principles calculations
To gain more insights into the effects of the 2TEAI surface modification on the structure and performance of the perovskite film, we performed first-principles calculations to investigate the surface structures and charge transfer behavior of the perovskite film. The technical details of the calculations can be found in the Experimental section. Three atomic surface models of the pristine FAPbI3 perovskite films were constructed with no adsorption, 2TEAI molecule adsorption, and 2T molecule adsorption, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. The stable configurations are obtained through surface relaxation, and the electronic structures were analyzed by calculating the total density of states (DOS) spectra of the relaxed configurations, as shown in Fig. 4d–f. First, it is observed that the bithiophene adopts a face-on configuration on the perovskite surface, and both groups of bithiophene and ammonium establish intimate contact with the perovskite surface. This provides the foundation for synergistic effects of bithiophene and ammonium groups for increasing the interfacial optoelectronic properties of PVSCs. Second, it can be observed that as compared to the bare surface without adsorption (Fig. 4d), the adsorption of the 2TEAI molecule on the FAPbI3 surface caused a localized surface state in the gap (Fig. 4e), which is close to the bottom of the valence band and almost overlaps it. From the semiconductor theory perspective, this additionally introduces a surface state and could provide an opportunity for more electron transition on the valence band and enhance the conduction (or the “p-doping”). This is consistent with the improved carrier dynamics, i.e. the improved charge transfer in PVSCs with 2TEAI modification. Meanwhile, although the adsorption of the 2T molecule also introduced a localized surface state in between the conduction and valence bands, this surface state is far away from the bottom of the valence band and the top of the conduction band, as shown in Fig. 4f, due to which significant changes could not be induced in the conduction.

(a–c) The optimized atomic models of the FAPbI3 film surfaces with no adsorption, 2TEAI molecule adsorption, and 2T molecule adsorption, respectively. (d–f) The calculated total density of states spectra corresponding to the surface models of (a)–(c). 
The differences in the electronic structure of the FAPbI3 surface with different molecular adsorptions can be further explained by the isosurface plots of the differential charge between them, as shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). It can be discovered that the adsorption of the 2TEAI molecule on the FAPbI3 surface caused a strong asymmetric distribution between the positive and negative charges as compared to the 2T molecule. This charge asymmetry can be mainly attributed to the asymmetry of the amine group on the 2TEAI molecule. Therefore, our calculations confirm that the modification with the 2TEAI molecule can improve the surface electrical conductivity of the FAPbI3 film, which in turn enhances the transport properties of the perovskite thin film and the interfacial electronic coupling. These results are in agreement with the enhanced charge transfer between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD.
Conclusions
In summary, bithiophenethylammonium iodide (2TEAI) has been designed and synthesized to modify the perovskite surface, which simultaneously reduces the surface charge recombination and improves the electronic coupling at the interface. This further results in a significant increase in PCE from 21.7% to 23.6%. Specifically, the deposition of 2TEAI significantly enhances VOC from 1.11 to 1.16 V, due to its strong passivation effect, as evidenced by the charge recombination study. Meanwhile, the JSC is also dramatically increased from 24.57 to 25.27 mA cm−2, owing to the improved charge extraction at the anode interface after 2TEAI modification. Besides, 2TEAI-modification also enables good device stability, and the unencapsulated PVSC maintains 90% of its initial efficiency, while the reference solar cell maintains only 40%, after 2000 h storage in N2. The joint study of first-principles calculations and surface optoelectronic properties unveils that the deposited 2TEAI passivates the perovskite surface by reducing the Pb0 content and forming an electron back-scattering field, while it improves the interfacial electronic coupling by surface doping and increasing the interfacial energy level alignment. Our work demonstrates the effect of the conjugated 2D spacer in terms of surface modification and paves the way toward high-performance PVSCs.
