    , Accepted 12th December 2014First published on 15th December 2014AbstractNanocrystal array solar cells based on lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) have recently achieved a high power conversion efficiency of over 8%. The device performance is expected to further increase by using 1-dimensional nanorods (NRs), due to their improved carrier transport over zero-dimensional quantum dots. However, previously reported PbSe NRs have not been used in solar cells mainly because of their large diameters, resulting in a small bandgap unsuitable for photovoltaic application. In this work, we have demonstrated a new method for synthesizing monodisperse ultra-small PbSe NRs with the diameter approaching 2 nm (Eg > 1.2 eV), which can be attributed to the use of diphenylphosphine (DPP) and trans-2-octenoic acid (t-2-OA). The introduction of trace DPP can greatly lower the reaction temperature, leading to reduced diameters for the obtained PbSe NRs as well as largely increased yield. The use of short-chain t-2-OA together with oleic acid as capping ligands results in high monomer reactivity, fast nucleus diffusion and high growth rate, which realize the anisotropic growth of ultra-small PbSe NRs at low reaction temperatures. The PbSe NRs show n-type properties and high electron mobility as measured using field-effect transistors. The PbSe NRs with narrow diameters also demonstrate a suitable bandgap for photovoltaic application. They are used for the first time in solar cells and their improved efficiency is demonstrated when used together with QDs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, lead chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs) such as PbS and PbSe have attracted much attention for their potential applications in telecommunication,1 photodetectors,2 photovoltaics,3–5 and light emitters.6 In particular, their remarkably large exciton Bohr radius,7 size and shape-tunable physical attributes8–10 and the multiple exciton generation (MEG)11,12 effect make PbS and PbSe ideal candidates for solar energy conversion. Nanocrystal array solar cells based on PbS/PbSe have been extensively studied in recent years3,13–16 and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% has been achieved by the Sargent and Bawendi groups.17,18 The first efficient NC solar cell based on PbSe has been reported by Luther et al. in 200819 and we then improved its efficiency to 4.57%.4,20 However, currently all the PbS/PbSe nanocrystal solar cells use quantum dots (QDs) as the active material, which may hinder the carrier mobility due to frequent inter-dot hopping. In hybrid nanocrystal-polymer photovoltaics, it has been reported that 1-dimensional (1D) cadmium selenide nanorods (NRs) led to more efficient electron transport than zero-dimensional (0D) QDs and hence the performance was improved.21–23 In addition, the latest breakthrough showed an increased MEG efficiency in PbSe NRs compared with QDs.6,24,25 The MEG efficiency can also be enhanced by adjusting the aspect ratio of PbSe NRs and they exhibit a maximum at an aspect ratio of 6–7 with the multi-exciton yields two-fold higher than QDs.26 Moreover, PbSe NRs also exhibit other interesting properties such as anisotropic absorption,27 high absorption coefficients,28 and long biexciton lifetime.26,29
However, the anisotropic growth of PbSe colloidal NCs has been less well developed compared to II–VI semiconducting NCs,30–32 mainly due to their highly symmetrical (rock salt) crystal structure. So far the synthesis of colloidal PbSe NRs has only been reported by a few groups. Prasad et al. have prepared PbSe NCs of anisotropic shapes by using noble metal33 or hybrid nanoparticles34 as seeds, which, however, may change the intrinsic physical properties of the synthesized NCs.35 Jawaid et al. showed that PbSe rods and multipods of nearly 4.5 nm diameter can be synthesized in the inadvertently oxidated polyunsaturated solvent.36 Recently, Murray's group has reported PbSe NRs of ∼4 nm diameter by using a new phosphine selenide precursor.37 However, none of the PbSe NRs reported previously have been employed in solar cells likely due to their large diameters (>4 nm), resulting in an unsuitably small bandgap for photovoltaic application. We have pointed out that in PbSe NC array solar cells, the optimal diameter for PbSe NCs should be as small as 2–3 nm to achieve decent open circuit voltage and good performance.4 Thus to take advantage of the enhanced carrier transport of PbSe NRs in solar cells, synthesis of PbSe NRs with ultra-small diameters remains a challenge.
In this work, we report a solution-process method to synthesize high-yield, monodisperse PbSe NRs with narrow diameters approaching 2 nm (Eg > 1.2 eV) by first introducing trans-2-octenoic acid (t-2-OA) as the synergetic ligand together with conventional oleic acid (OA). The introduction of short-chain t-2-OA led to high monomer reactivity, fast nucleus diffusion and high growth rate for NCs, resulting in anisotropic growth of PbSe NCs. The aspect ratio of the PbSe NRs can be adjusted by changing the length of the short-chain carboxylic acids. Furthermore, we intentionally added a small amount of diphenylphosphine (DPP) to induce low-temperature nucleation and high synthetic conversion yields, which enable the growth of PbSe NRs at low temperatures (80 °C–120 °C) to achieve NRs with extremely small diameters. The photovoltaic and carrier transport properties of these PbSe NRs are investigated for the first time in solar cells and field-effect transistors (FETs) respectively, and their improved performance compared to conventional QDs has been demonstrated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
Lead oxide (99.9%), tris(diethylamino)phosphine (TDP) (97%), oleic acid (tech., 90%), and 1,3-benzenedithiol (BDT) (97%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar; trans-2-hexenoic acid (t-2-HA) (>98%), trans-2-octenoic acid (t-2-OA) (>95%), and trans-2-decenoic acid (t-2-DA) (>95%) were purchased from TCI; selenium powder (99.5%), diphenylphosphine (DPP) (98%), and 1-octadecene (ODE) (90%) were purchased from J&K; trioctylphosphine (TOP) (97%) was purchased from Strem; bis(trimethylsilyl)selenide ((TMS)2Se) (97%) was acquired from Gelest. 1-Octadecene was dried by heating to 100 °C under vacuum for 24 h and then placed in a glovebox. A phosphine selenide solution was obtained by stirring 10 ml phosphine and 10 mmol Se powder overnight and then stored in a glovebox.
2.2 Synthesis of PbSe NRs

2.2.1 Control of the t-2-XA:OA molar ratio. 
All experiments were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard air-free Schlenk line techniques. A solution of 0.4 mmol PbO (89 mg), 1 mmol carboxylic acid ligands (t-2-XA:OA) and 8 g dried ODE was heated at 130 °C in a 50 ml three-neck flask under nitrogen. The molar ratio of t-2-XA:OA was adjusted to specific values, with the total amount kept constant at 1 mmol. The solution was then degassed for an additional 1 h at 100 °C under vacuum before keeping the solution at 120 °C under nitrogen. Then a mixture of 1.2 ml 1 M TDPSe and 10 μl DPP in 1.2 ml ODE was injected. The reaction was allowed to continue for 2 min, and then it was rapidly quenched by placing the flask in a room-temperature water bath and injecting 5 ml anhydrous hexane. The NCs were purified by precipitation twice in hexane/isopropyl alcohol and stored in powder form in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.


2.2.2 Control of the reaction temperature. 
The t-2-OA:OA molar ratio was fixed at 4:1, while the PbSe NRs were grown at specific temperatures for optimal times (50 min, 15 min, 2 min, 1 min and 0.5 min for 80 °C, 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C respectively).

2.3 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope. UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750. The NIR fluorescence spectra of PbSe NRs were recorded on an applied nanofluorescence spectrometer at room temperature with an excitation laser source at 785 nm. The crystal structure of PbSe NRs was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) by using an X'Pert-ProMPD (Holand) D/max-gAX-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). For XRD measurements, samples were prepared by depositing NC or NR solutions in chloroform onto a Si substrate. The IR spectra of PbSe NRs with different t-2-OA:OA molar ratios were recorded in the range 3200–400 cm−1 on a HYPERION spectrometer with a pressed KBr pellet. The FET was characterized at room temperature in a high vacuum probe station (Lakeshore) connected to a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 4200).
2.4 Computational details
All the calculations were performed using DMol3 in MS developed by Accelrys Inc. An all-electron method that includes generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange–correlation term was adopted. The DND basis set and PBE functional were chosen in this calculation. We performed the self-consistent field (SCF) computations with a convergence criterion of 10−5 a.u. on the total energy and electron density. The convergence was sped up by smearing 0.001 Ha which is set in the orbital occupancy. All the structures have been optimized so that we can obtain a stable structure and the total energy. We calculated the binding energy at the atomic level.
2.5 Device fabrication
The substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min in sequence, and then by ozone treatment for 30 min to remove any organic residue. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was first deposited at 4500 rpm onto the pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and then was thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes. Then the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glovebox. A solution of PbSe dots (20 mg ml−1) dissolved in hexane was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The post-ligand exchange was carried out by soaking the as-prepared film in a solution of 0.001 M 1,3-BDT in acetonitrile for 30 s, and then rinsing it with pure acetonitrile to remove the excess 1,3-BDT and ligands. Then another QD layer was deposited and ligand exchanged. Subsequently, two NR layers were deposited on top of the dot film by spin-coating a 20 mg ml−1 PbSe NR solution in hexane and then ligand exchanged. Finally, 0.6 nm LiF (0.1 Å S−1) and 100 nm Al (1 Å S−1 for the first 10 nm and 3 Å S−1 for the remaining 90 nm) were thermally evaporated at a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2).
Devices for FET measurements were fabricated on n-doped silicon wafers with 250 nm of thermally grown SiO2, which serves as the back gate and part of the gate dielectric stack, respectively. The substrate was washed with DI water and acetone and then processed with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). After that, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen glovebox. A solution of 20 mg ml−1 PbSe QDs in hexane was spin-coated at 1500 rpm on the Si substrate and then ligand exchanged as described above. Similarly, a solution of 20 mg ml−1 PbSe NRs in hexane was deposited on the substrate and ligand exchanged. 80 nm copper was evaporated on the active layer under high vacuum (Kurt J. Lesker, <10−6 Torr) using a shadow mask with 1200 μm channel width and 50 μm channel length for the drain and source electrodes, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
We describe here a new synthesis scheme producing monodisperse PbSe NRs at low temperatures by using a short-chain carboxylic acid and OA as hybrid capping agents and tris(diethylamino)phosphine selenium (TDPSe) with trace DPP as the Se precursor in the noncoordinating solvent 1-octadecene (ODE). Previously, researchers observed that short ligands can lead to elongated NRs in II–VI systems.38,39 Here, short-chain t-2-OA was used together with conventional OA in our system to achieve PbSe NRs. We successfully obtained high-quality PbSe NRs with a suitable bandgap at an optimal molar ratio of 4:1 for t-2-OA and OA, as shown in Fig. 1a. The synthesized PbSe NRs are monodisperse with a remarkably small diameter of 2.6 ± 0.4 nm and an average length of 14 ± 4 nm, yielding an aspect ratio of 6 ± 2. The single crystallinity and structural integrity of the PbSe NRs are demonstrated by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1b). The PbSe NRs shown in Fig. 1b have a fringe spacing of 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (200) lattice planes for the cubic rock salt structure of PbSe, as also reflected in the Fourier transform (inset). The HRTEM image also indicates that the [100] crystallographic axis is parallel to the long axis of the rods as previously observed in anisotropic PbS NCs.40 Meanwhile, very few multipods are also observed in the HRTEM images (Fig. S1†), which show two perpendicular sets of (200) facets, in accordance with the growth direction of PbSe NRs. Oriented attachment is one of the most reported mechanisms for the anisotropic growth of PbS and PbSe NCs.41,42 The attachment of PbSe NCs can be along the axis of nonpolar (100) or polar (111) facets, favoring facets with higher surface energy. In the absence of capping ligands, the surface energy of (111) in PbSe NCs is larger than (100). In the presence of capping ligands, the surface energy of (111) can be dramatically reduced and become smaller than that of (100).43 In addition, Jeong et al. demonstrated that (111) capped with short-chain carboxylic acids led to much lower surface energy than that capped with long-chain ones.44 Thus in our work, the (100) facets of PbSe NCs have a higher surface energy than (111) capped with short-chain t-2-XA (X = H, O or D) and hence are more active, leading to oriented attachment along the (100) axis, as shown in Fig. 1b.

3.1 The effect of the t-2-OA:OA ratio on PbSe NC morphology
Previous studies have shown that the organic capping ligands used in the colloidal NC synthesis can play a profound role in the growth mechanism and affect the physical properties of colloidal NCs.38,45–47 In this study, t-2-OA and OA were mixed together as capping agents. Fig. 2 shows that the molar ratio of t-2-OA/OA can largely affect the morphology of the synthesized PbSe NRs at the optimal growth temperature of 120 °C. When t-2-OA is used as the only capping agent, the NRs have an aspect ratio of 9 ± 4 with a high yield of branched NCs (Fig. 2a). At an optimal molar ratio of 4:1 for t-2-OA and OA, more monodisperse NRs can be obtained and the aspect ratio decreases to 6 ± 2 (Fig. 2b). With further increased OA ratio, the aspect ratio of PbSe NRs gradually decreases to nearly 1 (spherical NCs), as shown in Fig. 2b–f. The detailed dimensions of the NRs shown in Fig. 2 are listed in Table S1.† In addition, the yield of PbSe NCs and the percent of branched nanostructures are also listed in Table S1.† It is worth noting that the typical reaction conditions for PbSe nanorods37 require a high reaction temperature of 170 °C and an almost five times higher lead precursor concentration compared to our optimal conditions. After the addition of the short-chain carboxylic acid t-2-OA, more lead precursor can be released at elevated temperatures. Thus a high percentage of multiple-branched PbSe NCs can be observed (in Fig. S2†), which can be attributed to the increased growth rate and the extremely large monomer concentration at high temperatures.48 Based on the data, we conclude that the addition of short-chain t-2-OA can promote the growth of PbSe NRs, leading to elongated and branched NCs. In contrast, the use of long chain OA can reduce the growth speed and improve the monodispersity of PbSe NRs (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that nearly spherical QDs are observed in Fig. 2f when OA is used as the sole capping agent, while Murray et al. have obtained PbSe NRs instead.37 We attributed this discrepancy to the significantly lower synthesis temperature of 120 °C used here compared to 150–170 °C used in their experiment. In addition, we also investigated the role of both ligands in the capping of the synthesized NCs. FTIR spectra of free carboxylic acids and PbSe NRs coated with mixed t-2-OA:OA capping ligands are shown in Fig. S4 and S3.† In Fig. S3,† the characteristic peaks of free carboxylic acids at ∼1700 cm−1 shown in Fig. S4† are not observed, indicating that t-2-OA and OA on the surface of PbSe NRs form carboxylates with Pb atoms. Meanwhile, with t-2-OA as the sole capping ligand, the characteristic peaks of the –COO− group are at 1464 cm−1 and 1380 cm−1, while those of –COO− are at 1574 cm−1 and 1406 cm−1 if only OA is used instead. For mixed t-2-OA:OA, PbSe NCs are capped by both ligands. Nonetheless, the peak intensity of OA is evidently higher than that of t-2-OA. We conclude that the NRs are mainly capped by long-chain OA, which helps in improving the dispersity of NRs in organic solvents.

 Fig. 3  Illustration of the effect of the t-2-OA/OA ratio on PbSe NC morphology. 
The effect of ligands on the optical properties of the synthesized PbSe NCs was investigated. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of NCs were recorded and are shown in Fig. 4a. The change of the PbSe aspect ratio with the increasing OA ratio is shown in Fig. 4b. It is worth noting that when the molar ratio of t-2-OA/OA decreases from 5:0 to 3:2, the NR diameter remains almost constant at around 2.6 nm. Then the nanorod diameter decreases rapidly to 2.2 nm as the molar ratio further decreases to 0:5, indicating the significant effect of the ligand ratio on the size of PbSe NRs. It is considered that the NCs’ absorption peak is primarily determined by their diameters49,50 as a result of quantum confinement. Therefore in the absorption spectra (Fig. 4a), the first exciton absorption peaks of the PbSe NRs are also changed with different ligand ratios, following the same trend. The photoluminescence spectra of PbSe NRs have well-defined emission peaks with full-width at half-maxima similar to the first excitonic absorption peaks, indicating good monodispersity. Murray37 and Tischler et al.10 have reported that the Stokes shift for PbSe is sensitive to the shape of NCs. We also found that the Stokes shift for our PbSe NRs varies with the NC morphology, though further investigation is needed to understand the mechanism.

The wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) spectra of the synthesized PbSe NRs with different ligand ratios are displayed in Fig. 5, which are consistent with previously reported spectra for PbSe NRs and NCs.37 The spectra indicate that the PbSe NRs have a typical rock-salt structure (JCPDS: 06-0354) and the diffraction peaks of NRs have a slightly narrower diffraction peak (200) than the spherical NCs. As the aspect ratio of PbSe NRs decreases from 9 to nearly 1, the corresponding (200) diffraction peak gradually broadens. The NRs with a large aspect ratio can easily align parallel to the substrate, while spherical NCs do not exhibit the preferred crystallographic orientation relative to the substrate. As a result, the NRs demonstrate sharper diffraction peaks than QDs, consistent with the previous report.37

3.2 The impact of reaction temperature
PbSe NRs were synthesized at different reaction temperatures with the fixed ratio of 4:1 for t-2-OA/OA. Fig. 6a displays the absorption spectra of PbSe NRs synthesized at different reaction temperatures from 80 °C to 160 °C, with the optimal growth time varying from 50 min to 0.5 min, respectively. The first exciton absorption peaks of the resulting NRs red shift with the increasing reaction temperature. The size and shape of PbSe NRs were investigated by TEM and are shown in Fig. 6c–g. We can observe that the monodispersity of the synthesized PbSe NRs is optimal at the growth temperature of 120 °C. The correlation between NC dimensions and growth temperatures is shown in Fig. 6b, with the detailed dimensions listed in Table S2.† We find that the diameters of the resulting NCs gradually increase with the increasing growth temperature. Nevertheless, the length of PbSe NRs follows a more complex trend, suggesting a tradeoff between the NR nucleation and growth process. The shorter PbSe NRs observed at high temperatures may be attributed to Oswald ripening as a result of exhaustion of the precursors. In the absence of DPP, NCs with long arms and high branching ratio can be observed (Fig. S5†), suggesting the existence of a large amount of precursors after nucleation, which indicates that the main reason for the exhaustion of precursors is not the high temperature but DPP. Since the bandgaps of the NCs mainly depend on their diameters, we can precisely control the diameters and hence bandgaps of PbSe NRs by adjusting the growth temperature.

(b) Average diameter (blue squares) and length (red circles) of the corresponding PbSe NRs synthesized at the specific reaction temperature. (c–g) TEM images of PbSe NRs synthesized at 80 °C, 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C respectively. 
3.3 The effect of DPP on PbSe NC morphology
Previous studies have reported the dramatic effect of DPP as the impurity in the synthesis of PbSe QDs using Pb-oleate and TOP.51,52 They found that DPP in TOPSe can largely affect the formation of PbSe QDs by enhancing NC nucleation and accelerating the reaction rate. In this work, we show that trace DPP added in TDPSe can significantly lower the reaction temperature and reduce the growth time during the synthesis of PbSe NRs, which is beneficial to produce rods with narrow diameters. In order to reveal the effect of DPP on PbSe morphology, we synthesized PbSe NCs at 120 °C with and without DPP. The TEM images of NCs w/wo DPP at optimal growth time are shown in Fig. S7.† With DPP, the transparent precursor solution quickly turned dark after the injection of TDPSe:DPP and monodisperse PbSe NRs with small diameters were obtained after only 2 min at 120 °C as a result of enhanced nucleation (Fig. S7a†). The detailed dimension information of NRs at different growth times is listed in Table S3.† In contrast, we noticed that the color change of the reaction solution without DPP was much slower than that using DPP (Fig. S8†), which suggests the apparent effect of DPP on nucleation. The corresponding TEM images of PbSe NRs without DPP at different growth times are shown in Fig. S7b and S9.† It is evident that the length and branching ratio of PbSe NCs without using DPP are significantly increased compared to those using DPP, which can be attributed to the large amount of the precursor left after limited nucleation. We found that the average diameter of optimal PbSe NRs without DPP is around 2.6 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 1.09 eV (close to that of silicon), which makes them good candidates for NC solar cells. The PbSe NRs without using DPP have an average diameter of 3.3 nm (corresponding to a bandgap of 0.98 eV), and are less suitable for photovoltaic application due to the resulting small open circuit voltage. However, both PbSe NRs have smaller diameters than previously reported ones36,37 due to the use of t-2-OA. It is worth noting that the yield of PbSe NRs increased to nearly 50% with DPP, which is much higher than the formerly reported 10%53. The high yield of PbSe NRs is an indispensable premise for their large-scale commercial applications in photovoltaics. Fig. S10† shows the absorption spectra of PbSe NRs with DPP and without DPP. The PbSe NRs with DPP have a significantly sharper absorption peak than those without DPP, suggesting largely improved monodispersity. With regard to the NC aspect ratio, the use of trace DPP in TDPSe tends to produce shorter PbSe NRs compared to systems without DPP (Table S3†). We speculate that DPP can function as a secondary phosphine impurity in our synthesis, which may help in dissociating Pb-oleate to form a more reactive Pb-phosphine complex and accelerating the release of Se in TDPSe.51,52,54 In comparison, bis(diethylamino)phosphorus,53 the previously reported impurity in PbSe nanorod synthesis, can only form a Pb-phosphine complex with their P–H moiety. Thus DPP can increase the reactivity of both Pb and Se precursors, resulting in more efficient nucleation at lower temperatures. Consequently, a large amount of monomers was consumed during the nucleation stage and only small quantities of monomers remained for NC growth, leading to nanorods with high yields and ultra-small diameters.
3.4 Effect of the chain length of carboxylic acids on the NR morphology
We also investigated the effect of the chain length of carboxylic acids on the anisotropic growth of PbSe NRs. trans-2-Decenoic acid (t-2-DA), trans-2-hexanoic acid (t-2-HA) and t-2-OA with different chain-lengths were used and compared. As shown in Fig. S11,† the ratio of t-2-DA has a significant effect on the aspect ratio of the synthesized PbSe NRs, quite similar to t-2-OA. For t-2-HA with a very short chain-length, the synthesized NCs have poor dispersity in solvents if OA is not used. Thus we fixed the t-2-XA (X = H, O or D):OA molar ratio at 3:2 and then compared the morphology of resulting NCs. As shown in Fig. 7, when the chain-length gets shorter, the shape of PbSe NCs under the same reaction conditions changes from dots to short rods to multi-pods. A clear trend is that the shorter the carboxylic acid, the higher the aspect ratio for the resulting PbSe NRs and the more likely the branched NCs will appear. We speculate that the length of the ligands and the binding strength between the capping ligands and Pb will determine the shape of the particles, as reported in the previous work.38
 Fig. 7  TEM images of PbSe NCs synthesized at 120 °C with the fixed t-2-XA:OA molar ratio (3:2) for (a) t-2-DA; (b) t-2-OA; (c) t-2-HA. 
To testify our hypothesis, we examined the binding strength between Pb and four kinds of carboxylic acids including OA, t-2-HA, t-2-OA and t-2-DA by using computational modeling at the atomic level. Table S4† lists the related energetic parameter ΔE, which represents the binding strength between the Pb cation and the acid radical ion. It was calculated according to the equationΔE = [Etotal(Pb(XA)2) − Etotal(Pb) − 2Etotal(XA)]/2
A lower value of ΔE means higher bond strength between Pb and carboxylic acids, indicating that the corresponding lead precursor is more stable. ΔE is calculated in the optimized geometries (as shown in Fig. S12†) and listed in Table S4.† The value of ΔE for Pb-OA is significantly lower than that for Pb(t-2-XA) (X = H, O or D), suggesting a much stronger bond. Meanwhile, the value of ΔE increases with the decreasing chain length of carboxylic acids. Precursors with weaker binding strength more likely release monomers during the nucleation stage, which can promote the growth of nanocrystals.55 Thus Pb(t-2-XA) with short chains is supposed to benefit the anisotropic growth of PbSe NCs, which is consistent with our results in Fig. 7.
In addition, steric hindrance of the ligands may play an important role in the NC growth. Monomers bound by shorter chain ligands are less sterically hindered than those bound by their longer chain counterparts, leading to faster diffusion of the nuclei and a higher growth rate. In contrast, the longer and bulkier ligands with larger steric hindrance would prefer to stay as far apart as possible, resulting in NCs with high curvature like spheres. Therefore, short-chain Pb(t-2-XA) leads to higher monomer reactivity, concentration and diffusion speed than those with long chains, favoring the anisotropic growth of PbSe NCs. Compared to the work in ref. 53, the concentration of our lead precursor is only one-fifth of theirs and our synthesis temperature is also significantly lower. At such low precursor concentrations and temperatures, if we use OA as the sole capping agent as in ref. 53, only spherical PbSe NCs could be obtained (Fig. 2f). Importantly, we used t-2-OA/OA together with DPP and achieved PbSe nanorods with high aspect ratio and small diameter. The weak binding strength between Pb and t-2-OA led to fast nucleus diffusion and high growth rate at a temperature as low as 120 °C, promoting oriented attachment.
3.5 The application of PbSe NRs in optoelectronic devices
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of narrow PbSe NRs, Schottky junction devices with a simple ITO/PEDOT:PPS/PbSe/LiF/aluminum structure were adopted, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8. PbSe NRs with a bandgap of 1.09 eV and PbSe QDs were used for comparison. Three types of devices using PbSe QDs, NRs or QDs/NRs as the active materials were fabricated, with the results shown in Fig. 8. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. We can see that devices using QDs/NRs show the best performance, while the devices using pure PbSe NRs show very poor efficiency. To interpret the performance difference, the morphology of the three active films was characterized by TEM (Fig. S13†). We can observe that in Fig. S13a† the QDs are well packed and the whole film is very dense and uniform. In contrast, the film made of pure NRs has poor quality with many aggregates and pinholes, which is very likely the reason for the poor device performance. For the best performing film shown in Fig. S13c,† a dense QD film was first deposited beneath the top NR film to prevent pinholes while the top NR film can facilitate electron transport to the electrode. The slightly enhanced performance of solar cells based on QDs/NRs stems from the improved open circuit voltage and fill factor (FF). Since NRs are considered to have improved carrier mobility compared to QDs, less recombination,25 and improved Voc as well as FF are expected. However, the short circuit current density of the QD/NR film is slightly less than the one using pure QDs, which may be due to the lower absorption coefficient of the less dense NR film. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on solar cells using PbSe NRs. Note that the surface states of NRs are usually higher than well passivated QDs.56 Thus the device photovoltaic performance can be further improved if we can better passivate the PbSe NRs in the future. To confirm the enhanced carrier transport in NR films, we fabricate field-effect transistors (FETs) by depositing a PbSe NR film on a doped n-type Si wafer with a gate dielectric stack of SiO2 (Fig. S14a†). For comparison, we also fabricate FETs based on PbSe QDs19 with nearly the same diameter. As-deposited PbSe QD arrays with the treatment of 1,3-benzenedithiol (BDT) turned out to be p-type (Fig. S14b†). The resulting QD film shows a room-temperature hole mobility of 1 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PbSe NR film shows n-type properties with a high electron mobility of 5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S14c†). Thus the insertion of PbSe NRs between QDs and the Al cathode is more beneficial to electron transport and collection, as proved by our device results. We noticed that PbSe NR FETs display large hysteresis likely due to the device interface57 and high density trap states on the surface of PbSe NRs.

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated a new method for synthesizing monodisperse ultra-small PbSe NRs with the diameter approaching 2 nm, which can be attributed to the use of DPP and t-2-OA. The introduction of trace DPP can greatly lower the reaction temperature, leading to reduced diameters for the obtained PbSe NRs as well as largely increased yield. The use of short-chain trans-2-octenoic acid together with OA as capping ligands results in high monomer reactivity, fast nucleus diffusion and high growth rate, which thereby results in the anisotropic growth of ultra-small PbSe NCs at low reaction temperatures. The PbSe NRs show n-type properties and high electron mobility as measured using field-effect transistors. Due to quantum confinement, these PbSe NRs with narrow diameters show a suitable bandgap for photovoltaic application. They are used for the first time in solar cells and their improved efficiency is demonstrated when used together with QDs.
