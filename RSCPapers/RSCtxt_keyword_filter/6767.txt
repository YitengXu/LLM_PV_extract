Introduction
Over the past two decades, Pt has been proved to be an excellent counter electrode (CE) material for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) which has become a criterion in the field of CE material development.1–3 However, as a scarce metal, Pt is expensive for mass production. Besides, the electrolyte can easily corrode Pt to PtI4 and H2PtI6, worsening the CE performance.4 In order to solve these problems, many low-cost and efficient materials have been proposed to replace Pt, such as carbonaceous materials,5–9 metal oxides,10–13 sulfides,14–17 nitrides,18–21 chalcogenides22–24 and polymers.25–27
As an important class of sulfides, NiS2 exhibits great potential as the CEs of DSSCs due to its comparatively high electrocatalytic activity, earth abundance and low cost. Recent studies have demonstrated that NiS2 presented good electrocatalytic performance for the triiodide reduction and can be a potential material as a CE.15,28 Moreover, excellent morphology of CE material can also improve the electrocatalytic performance.29,30 It is well known that hollow-structured mesoporous materials, which integrate hollow interior or voids with mesoporous shells of various dimensions into one nanostructure, can provide large surface area, fast electron transfer channels and many catalytic active sites owing to their outstanding features of low density, high surface-to-volume ratio, the extensive presence of mesoporous channels on the shell, the resultant high permeability, etc.31–33 However, the electrocatalytic property of hollow-structured mesoporous NiS2 grown in situ on FTO as CE has not been investigated.
Herein, the hierarchical NiS2 hollow microspheres (HM-NiS2) were successfully in situ grown on FTO substrate by a facile and one-step hydrothermal method, and the HM-NiS2 film was used as a CE for DSSC without the need for further treatment, which has not yet been studied, to the best of our knowledge. The HM-NiS2 film exhibits many advantages. Firstly, this film possesses high mechanical stability and strong adhesion to the FTO substrate due to the in situ growth. Secondly, the preparation of this film reduces cost and simplifies the preparation process. Lastly, the HM-NiS2 can provide more electrolyte adsorptions and electrocatalytic active sites. DSSC with the HM-NiS2 CE achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.84%, which was comparable to the device with a conventional Pt CE (7.89%). It is demonstrated that the in situ grown HM-NiS2 film can be an ideal and promising candidate to replace the Pt CE with high efficiency and low cost.
Experimental
Preparation of counter electrode
All solvents and chemicals were purchased commercially, and used as received without further purification. The typical procedure for the HM-NiS2 CE is as follows:34 firstly, transparent FTO glass substrates (fluorine-doped SnO2, 15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd, Japan) were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min, respectively, and then stored in ethanol. Secondly, the preparation of HM-NiS2, directly grown on FTO substrates, adopted a one-step hydrothermal method. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mM) was put into a Teflon-lined autoclave of 30 mL capacity with 20 mL of deionized water at room temperature. Then, L-cysteine (2.0 mM) and urea (0.5 mM) were added to the above mentioned solution under ultrasonic treatment. A piece of cleaned FTO substrate was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner autoclave with the conductive side facing down. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 140 °C for 24 h in an oven without any agitation and was then allowed to gradually cool down to room temperature after heat treatment. When the process was completed, the prepared CEs were removed from the solution, and thoroughly washed several times with deionized water. After that, the HM-NiS2 electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h.
Fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cells
The commercial TiO2 electrodes (0.5 × 0.5 cm, Dalian Heptachroma Solar Tech, Co., Ltd, China) were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min under an air atmosphere prior to use. After the sintering, when the TiO2 electrodes cooled to 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.3 mM N719 (Dyesol Ltd, Australia) in ethanol for 12 h. The electrodes were then rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dyes. A solar cell was assembled, using a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame (Dupont, America), with the HM-NiS2 CE. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through the hole predrilled in the CE, and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass coverslip. The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.065 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.28 M TBP and 0.05 M GuSCN in acetonitrile (DHS-Et23, Dalian Heptachroma SolarTech, Co., Ltd, China). For comparison, another DSSC was fabricated by replacing HM-NiS2 with Pt with other procedures remaining the same. The standard Pt CE was purchased from Dalian Heptachroma Solar Tech Co., Ltd, China.
Characterization and measurements
The HM-NiS2 was determined using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, SHIMADZU XRD-7000) measured with Cu Kα (γ = 0.154 nm) at 50 kV and 40 mA over the two theta range 10°–80°. The morphology of the HM-NiS2 CE was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7000F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010). The BET specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement at 77 K on a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e. A symmetrical dummy cell (CE/electrolyte/CE) in the dark was used to perform the Tafel polarization measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effective area of the symmetrical cell was 0.25 cm2. A CHI660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China) was used to measure the cyclic voltammetry (CV), EIS and Tafel polarization measurement. The CV measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in a three-electrode system consisting of a Pt wire as a CE, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and the catalytic electrode material coated FTO substrates as the working electrode in the potential window of −0.4 to 1.0 V in acetonitrile solution containing 5 mM LiI, 0.5 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. The EIS measurement was performed with a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at zero bias, and the AC amplitude was set at 10 mV. The Tafel polarization measurement was carried out with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The irradiation source for the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (San-ei Electric Co. Ltd, XES-301S). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.25 cm2. Current–voltage characteristics were performed on a Keithley SourceMeter. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements of the DSSCs were characterized on a PV Measurements QEX10 quantum efficiency measurement system (Boulder, CO, USA).
Results and discussion
XRD analysis of NiS2 sample
The NiS2 hollow microspheres could grow in situ on well-cleaned FTO glass substrates from a precursory mixture solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave through a hydrothermal reaction. To check the phase structure of the NiS2 hollow microspheres, XRD measurement was carried out first. Fig. 1 shows the representative XRD pattern of the as-prepared NiS2 hollow microspheres. The crystal structure of the hollow microspheres was refined against powder XRD data using the Rietveld method. All the diffraction peaks containing (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (222), (023) and (321) faces in this pattern can be well indexed to the cubic NiS2 (JCPDS 65-3325), as shown in Fig. 1. No peak from the impurity phase could be detected in the XRD pattern.

SEM and TEM analysis of NiS2 sample

Fig. 2(a and b) shows the SEM images of HM-NiS2 grown in situ on FTO substrates under different magnifications. The SEM images reveal that the hierarchical NiS2 microspheres were successfully grown on the FTO substrate which should possess high mechanical stability and strong adhesion to the FTO substrate due to the in situ growth. In order to demonstrate the strong adhesion of the NiS2 film, 3M Scotch tape detachment test was performed to the NiS2 film.35 We tried to peel off the NiS2 film from the FTO substrate using 3M Scotch tape by firmly attaching it on the surface of the NiS2 film, but the film remained on the FTO without any visible change after 30 cycles of testing indicating strong adhesion between NiS2 and substrate. It is worth noting that some of the shells are partially broken, clearly demonstrating the hollow nature of the NiS2 microspheres (Fig. 2c), which is advantageous for providing more electrolyte adsorptions and electrocatalytic active sites. The TEM image in Fig. 2d further confirms that the NiS2 microspheres are hollow. The NiS2 hollow spheres with an open hole on their wall could make the inner surface of hollow spheres accessible to electrolytes.36 In addition, the NiS2 microspheres with large sizes as CEs also provide an additional function, namely, improving the light utilisation of the photoanode film by scattering input light into the photoanode film, therefore the solar cell performance could be improved to some extent.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis of NiS2 sample
The BET specific surface area of the NiS2 sample was investigated by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms. Fig. 3 displays the nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms. The isotherm can be categorized as type IV with a distinct hysteresis loop observed in the range of 0.5–1.0P/P0, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. The BET specific surface area of the sample was calculated from N2 isotherms at 77 K and was found to be as much as 13.10 m2 g−1, which is large enough to enable the hollow microsphere host to provide many active sites and adsorption sites.

It was found that the DSSC based on the HM-NiS2 CE achieves a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.48 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.712 V, a fill factor (ff) of 0.63 and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.84%. The DSSC based on the Pt CE was also measured for a comparison, giving a η of 7.89% (Jsc = 17.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.747 V, ff = 0.62). After replacing the Pt CE with the HM-NiS2 CE, a 35 mV drop in the Voc is observed. In addition, the Jsc of the HM-NiS2 CE is slightly higher than that of the Pt CE. Overall, the HM-NiS2 CE shows an excellent performance which is close to that of the Pt CE.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were further used to compare the Jsc values of DSSCs with different CEs. The IPCE spectra of solar cells with various CEs are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  IPCE characteristics of DSSCs with different CEs. 
It can be seen from the IPCE spectra that the DSSCs with HM-NiS2 and Pt CEs show similar plots, indicating that the CE materials do not have remarkable wavelength dependence on the device performance. But a higher IPCE spectrum indicates a higher photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions. The IPCE value of a solar cell based on the HM-NiS2 CE is slightly higher than that of a solar cell based on the Pt CE in the range of 350–730 nm. The maximum IPCE values of the solar cells with HM-NiS2 and Pt CEs are 81.3% and 76.6% at 500 nm, respectively. The IPCE results are consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.
Cyclic voltammetry to analyze electrocatalytic abilities
The results obtained from the J–V curves can be further explained by the data from cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV analyses can reveal the overall electrocatalytic activities of the counter electrodes. Fig. 6 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the electrodes with various catalytic films. As shown in Fig. 6, all the curves exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1 and Ox-2/Red-2). The relative negative pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3− (eqn (1)), whereas the positive pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3− (eqn (2)). The peak current intensity and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) are two important parameters for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs. The higher cathodic peak current density reveals the faster reduction velocity and the smaller peak-to-peak separation (Epp) reflects the better reversibility of the redox reaction:15 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 6  CV curves of iodide/triiodide redox species for CEs. 
The peak current densities of Ox-1/Red-1 for the HM-NiS2 CE are slightly higher than those for the Pt CE. The Epp value is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction,23 and the Epp value of the HM-NiS2 CE is 350 mV, which is slightly smaller than that of the Pt CE (360 mV). The higher peak current density and lower Epp value also revealed that the HM-NiS2 electrode features a high catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− ions in the electrolyte, which is a paramount prerequisite for a robust CE to be applied in a DSSC.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further elucidate the catalytic activities of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiments were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). The Nyquist plots for symmetric cells with different CEs illustrate impedance characteristics, in which two semicircles are observed in the higher (left) and lower (right) frequency regions. The high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The left arc arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which changes inversely with the catalytic activity of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide.37

Fig. 7 shows the impedance spectra of the symmetric cells with Pt and HM-NiS2. The obtained parameters can be calculated from the fitting results of the equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7, and the relevant values are summarized in Table 1. The Rs value for the DSSC based on HM-NiS2 (10.56 Ω) is lower than that of Pt (12.78 Ω), which is caused by the in situ growth of NiS2 on FTO, then leads to stronger adhesion of NiS2 onto FTO than that of Pt onto FTO,38 this allows fast electrons to transfer from NiS2via FTO into the external circuit. On the other hand, the Rs of the NiS2 CE is lower than that of the Pt CE, yielding a slightly higher ff. In addition, the values of Rct for the DSSCs with the Pt and HM-NiS2 CEs are 8.76 and 9.68 Ω, respectively. It can be observed that the tendency of Rct agrees with the tendency of cell efficiency in Table 1.

Tafel polarization curves
To further investigate the catalytic activities, Tafel polarization curves were carried out on symmetrical cells (Fig. 8). The Tafel curve provides information about the exchange current density (J0), which has a closely positive correlation with the catalytic activity for reducing I3−. J0 can be estimated from the slope in the anodic or cathodic branch of the corresponding Tafel curve, and a larger slope implies a higher J0 on the electrode.39 It was found that the slope in the anodic and cathodic branch of the HM-NiS2 CE is close to that of the Pt CE which means that the J0 values of HM-NiS2 and Pt CEs are similar. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of reduction of I3− to I− of HM-NiS2 is comparable to that of Pt, which is consistent with Jsc values. In addition, J0 can be obtained from eqn (3), where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance extracted from the EIS spectra (Fig. 7), and F is the Faraday's constant.40 As the Rct value of the HM-NiS2 CE is close to that of the Pt CE, the tendency of J0 for different CEs calculated with eqn (3) is in agreement with that derived from the Tafel curves: J0 = (RT)/(nFRct)(3)

Consequently, we conclude from the electrochemical and EIS results that hierarchical NiS2 hollow microsphere has excellent electrocatalytic activity, which is comparable to that of Pt. It may be concluded that HM-NiS2 can be further explored to replace the expensive Pt as the catalytic film for the counter electrode of a DSSC, in view of the fact that it is much cheaper than Pt and its DSSC exhibits as much power conversion efficiency as that of a cell with a Pt CE.
Conclusions
In summary, hierarchical NiS2 hollow microspheres have been successfully in situ grown on FTO glass by a facile one-step hydrothermal route and used in DSSCs as CE material for the first time. SEM and TEM images reveal that the structure of NiS2 is hollow microspheres and some of the shells are partially broken. HM-NiS2 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−, which is comparable to that of Pt. The power conversion efficiency of 7.84% is achieved for the DSSC based on HM-NiS2 CE, which is quite close to that of the DSSC using a Pt CE (7.89%). The HM-NiS2 CE presented in this work is quite promising and is a prospective candidate to replace the highly expensive Pt as a CE, owing to its comparable catalytic properties and most importantly, ease of fabrication. This finding paves the way for preparing cheap and highly efficient CEs for DSSCs.
