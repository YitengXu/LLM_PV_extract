    , Accepted 20th October 2016First published on 20th October 2016AbstractThe field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has long focused on matching silicon solar cells, both in high power conversion efficiency (PCE) under solar light and broad absorption of the solar spectrum. We show that OPV devices, which have significantly lower PCEs than high-performing crystalline silicon cells when measured under the typical AM 1.5G solar standard, can surpass silicon cells with PCEs >20% measured under LED light. We highlight that the conflation of the terms “solar cell” and “photovoltaic” gives an incomplete view of the potential of many photovoltaic materials, especially organic materials. By expanding the definition and assessment of photovoltaic devices to include multiple light sources, OPVs—with their higher PCEs under indoor light and qualitative benefits of being lightweight, thin, flexible, and semi-transparent—could have a home in previously unconsidered low-power indoor applications.
Introduction
The term ‘photovoltaic’ has become synonymous with the term ‘solar’ in both colloquial and professional usage. The AM 1.5G light that mimics the terrestrial solar spectrum is the standard illumination source for measuring power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is the ratio of the electrical power output to the optical power input and is the decisive metric in this field.1 Thus there is an implicit assumption that all photovoltaic devices will be used to convert solar energy to electrical energy. For example, the entry for solar cells in Wikipedia reads as “Solar cells are described as being photovoltaic irrespective of whether the source is sunlight or an artificial light”,2 while the entry for the term ‘Photovoltaics’ reads as “Photovoltaics (PV) is the name of a method of converting solar energy into direct current electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect…”.3 This prevalent synonymy of the terms ‘photovoltaic’ and ‘solar’ has led to a myopic view of the possible applications of photovoltaic cells and the rejection of technologies that do not have PCEs measured using AM 1.5G comparable to crystalline silicon solar cells—the benchmark technology for high-efficiency commercial solar cells. This synonymy also leads to the common expectation that good solar cells will also be good photovoltaics i.e. devices with poor PCEs under AM 1.5G light source will also have poor PCEs under other light sources.4 Herein we show that common expectation is incorrect and the synonymy is a fallacy. We show that organic photovoltaics (OPVs), which have been viewed as subpar technology because their PCEs under the AM 1.5G light source have not yet matched crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells, can outperform commercial cells, including c-Si, under indoor light. We make the case that expanding the definition of a photovoltaic device to a device that converts photons into electrical energy will allow us to expand the discussion about harnessing light energy from the Sun and from other light sources such as indoor artificial light.
The performance of silicon solar cells with illumination sources other than AM 1.5G has been investigated because of the potential for energy generation under indoor lighting.5–7 Changing the light source from AM 1.5G to indoor lights not only changes the intensity but also the spectrum of the incident light. In c-Si cells, the PCE has a strong dependence on the light intensity but only a weak dependence on the light source. Thus, to simulate internal lighting, most studies use AM 1.5G light source with low intensities. The spectral irradiance of an AM 1.5G light source is broad and ranges from ∼400 nm to ∼2000 nm (Fig. 1).8 Thus, for a solar cell to have high PCE, the active layer must have a broad absorption and have a good spectral match with the AM 1.5G light.9,10 Conjugated polymers, the active layers of OPVs, typically have poor absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum and do not have uniform absorption in the visible region (Fig. 2).11,12 Thus they do not have a good spectral match with the AM 1.5G light and consequently have lower PCEs compared to silicon.

The last decade has witnessed a revolution in internal lighting with the phasing out of incandescent light bulbs and replacement with compact fluorescence lights (CFLs) and, more recently, with white light emitting diodes (LEDs).13,14 Unlike incandescent light bulbs, which have broad emission spectra similar to AM 1.5G, CFLs and LEDs have narrow spectra primarily in the visible range (see Fig. 1). Under these light sources, newer technologies with better spectral match with white LEDs can outperform silicon (Fig. 2). For example, it has been shown that dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have larger PCEs compared to silicon under CFL and LED illumination and that some OPVs show increased efficiency under CFL illumination.15–18 Herein we show that PCEs of greater than 20% can be obtained in OPVs with white LED illumination, matching PCEs of polycrystalline silicon solar cells and surpassing amorphous silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells.
Experimental
For indoor light, we chose a commercial white LED bulb and the intensity 20.5 mW cm−2. For outdoor light, we used an AM 1.5G solar simulator and the intensity 100 mW cm−2. For a well-lit room, the intensity of the indoor light is approximately 0.5–1 mW cm−2.7,18 We obtained a representative selection of commercial photovoltaics with the materials which have the highest current market share: polycrystalline silicon (c-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS).19 We fabricated a representative selection of organic photovoltaic devices. We also fabricated inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite photovoltaics devices using a previously reported protocol.20 For amorphous silicon (a-Si) cells, we used a commercial cell in a toy (Dancing monkey doll, cell from Vimun SC-3012-2A-A17/5) and for polycrystalline silicon cells, we used an encapsulated commercial cell from a garden light (Malibu Lights). We used a CIGS device from Nanosolar Nanocell. Device performance (current density vs. voltage) under both the AM 1.5G solar simulator lamp and the commercial white LED light was tested in a glovebox (see Fig. 3). IPCE was measured in atmosphere from 400–1100 nm. See ESI† for device fabrication and measurement details.

Results and discussion
Under AM 1.5G illumination, the a-Si cell had a PCE of 1.45%, the CIGS cell had a PCE of 2.64%, and the c-Si cell had a PCE of 16.72%. For OPVs, we used devices with active layers P3HT:PC60BM and PCE10:PC70BM in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphologies. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the P3HT:PC60BM device had a PCE of 2.93 ± 0.20% (7 devices)21 and PCE10:PC70BM had a PCE of 8.65 ± 0.4% (4 devices).22 We also used a device fabricated using aqueous dispersions of P3HT nanoparticles and PCBM nanoparticles,23,24 which had a PCE of 1.8 ± 0.04% (2 devices) under AM 1.5G illumination. MAPbI3 and MAxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite photovoltaics had PCEs of up to 12.49% and 8.80%, respectively, under AM 1.5G light, and showed PCEs of up to 33.22% and 22.18% under white LED illumination (see ESI†).
Under white LED illumination, both a-Si and c-Si showed only moderate increases in PCEs, consistent with earlier studies.25,26 a-Si had a PCE of 2.18% and c-Si had a PCE of 20.19%. CIGS showed a slight decrease in PCE down to 2.01% under LED illumination because of its diminished absorption in the visible region (see ESI†). However, OPVs show a dramatic increase in PCEs. The P3HT:PC60BM BHJ device showed a PCE of 12.83 ± 0.98% and PCE10:PC70BM BHJ device showed a PCE of 21.04 ± 2.08%. The P3HT:PC60BM device fabricated from aqueous nanoparticle dispersions showed a PCE of 6.89 ± 0.46%.
The P3HT-based devices showed the largest increase in PCE (∼300%) under LED compared to PCE under AM 1.5G whereas PCE of c-Si increased by 20%. We attribute the difference in percent increase in PCE to spectral overlap between the light source and the absorbance of the material, as shown by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra overlaid with LED spectra (see Fig. 2).9,10 A great deal of organic photovoltaic research has been aimed at widening the absorbance profile of materials to capture more of the sun's light, as evidenced by the higher wavelength and broader absorbance of PCE10, a newer OPV polymer,12,27 when compared with P3HT. While PCE10's overall performance was higher, P3HT showed a much steeper increase in efficiency between solar and LED light because of good spectral match (see Fig. 4). We also observed a similar trend in P3HT:PC60BM devices fabricated from aqueous nanoparticle dispersions (see Fig. 4). These results may not be surprising in hindsight but they quantitatively address and correct the common perception that poor solar cells will also be poor photovoltaics. Many organic materials previously discounted for use in photovoltaics due to an insufficiently broad absorbance spectrum could possibly be even more well-suited for indoor light than the materials tested here, finding a place inside our homes and offices.

Since the PCEs of the OPVs outperform silicon cells in internal LED lighting, they can also generate more power than currently used amorphous silicon cells. For example, a 10 cm × 10 cm OPV cell with a 10% PCE under 0.5–1 mW cm−2 illumination (∼500–1000 lux) will generate 5–10 mW whereas a-Si cell with comparable dimensions will generate only 1–2 mW. Thus OPVs can conveniently replace a-Si cells in many applications such as calculators, clocks, scales, or novelty items (Fig. 5).28 Others applications such as wearable electronics,29–32 detectors, sensors, remote control equipment, wireless computer mice and keyboards, flashlights, radios, and automatic paper towel, soap, and hand sanitizer dispensers may be powered by OPV-charged batteries, thus extending the time required for re-charging.6 Photovoltaic panels could be incorporated directly into these types of devices, or simply be installed as panels on walls, floors, or other surfaces to power nearby devices or put electricity back into the building power supply (Fig. 5). Additionally, the qualitative advantage of OPVs over c-Si cells of being thin, semi-transparent, and flexible allows them be used on a number of surfaces which would be otherwise impossible, such as being put on curved surfaces like lampshades or flexible surfaces like blinds or curtains.

There are numerous advantages of using photovoltaics to power indoor devices and wearable electronics.7,29–32 Many indoor environments, like offices and some homes, are lit for the majority of the day. Intensities of indoor light range from 100 lux in homes and lightly used office spaces, to 500 lux for more heavily used office spaces, up to 1000 lux for spaces like warehouses or manufacturing lines.7,18 Light intensities in this range are sufficient to supply mW power with a few cm scale devices with PCEs observed under white LEDs in our OPV samples. These photons, which are otherwise effectively wasted, can be recycled to reduce the power demands of the building in which they are installed. Additionally, using photovoltaics for low power devices instead of the power grid or running solely off battery power translates to a reduction of need for copper wire and battery waste, as well as increasing the time between battery replacements.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that OPVs can have higher PCEs than CIGS and Si-based solar cells under indoor LED lighting. Thus several organic photovoltaic materials that had been previously discounted because of their low PCEs under AM 1.5G solar simulator light may have competitive efficiencies under indoor lighting. The better performance of OPVs under white LEDs coupled with their lightweight, flexible, and semitransparent properties opens a wider variety of indoor applications, which had not been possible before with silicon cells. Our work only scrapes the surface of the hundreds of organic photovoltaic materials that have been developed and subsequently discounted for outdoor applications that may be ideal for these types of indoor light recycling applications. The need of the hour is to develop new standard conditions to evaluate PV devices under indoor lighting conditions.4,33 Silicon may dominate the solar market for larger power applications in the near future but, as our work shows, may not be the ideal material for low power applications. The fact that OPVs can outperform silicon cells in indoor lighting opens a new and untapped avenue for energy harvesting applications.
