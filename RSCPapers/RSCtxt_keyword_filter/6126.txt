    , Accepted 15th November 2010First published on 22nd December 2010AbstractA substantial increase in device performance and operational stability in solution processed inverted bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) is demonstrated by introducing a zinc oxide (ZnO) interlayer between the electron collecting bottom electrode and the photoactive blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The structure and morphology of the dense, planar ZnO layers were controlled either by electro-deposition or spray pyrolysis techniques. Metal oxide sandwich OPV devices based on the photoactive blend on an electro-deposited ZnO interlayer with a (100) preferential crystal orientation, and using a tungsten oxide (WOx) interlayer on the opposite electrode, resulted in a remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency with a value of 4.91% under AM1.5 illumination and an external quantum efficiency of 74%. Electro-deposition of the ZnO at low temperature proved to be the most promising method for forming the ZnO interlayers, allowing the highest control of film structure and morphology, as well as leading to significantly improved device efficiency and stability.
1. Introduction
With the growing importance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as an attractive, low cost and sustainable energy source, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer–fullerene based solar device systems have been investigated intensively, reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in the range 4–6%.1–3 To achieve even higher device efficiencies and to obtain increased stability, different routes of development have been explored. The majority target either the photoactive donor–acceptor compound system or the actual device architecture, including the insertion of charge extraction and exciton blocking layers, as well as the use of new electrodes.
Material design has recently been directed at increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) through intelligent tuning of the energy level difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the electron donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the electron acceptor, whilst also optimising light absorption across the solar spectrum.4,5 Device design has focused on the use of hole-extracting metal oxide (MO) interlayers such as molybdenum oxide (MoOx), vanadium oxide (V2O5), nickel oxide (NiO) and tungsten oxide (WOx), to either replace or cover the commonly used, but unstable poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer.6–10
Hole-extracting MOs have been employed in both the standard device architecture, with the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode collecting holes and the metal electrode collecting electrons, and the more innovative inverted architectures with opposite charge collection.6,11 MO interlayers successfully prevent contact between the ITO or metal electrode and the active organic layer, thus reducing current leakage, as well as providing a more homogenous electrode conductivity and work function.12,13 Applying the same interlayer concept to the opposite electrode, an electron-extracting MO buffer layer can be integrated using materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiOx), which can be processed from solution using a number of different techniques.14–18
Only a limited number of studies has been conducted investigating this new class of materials as an electron extraction layer in OPVs. One of the key challenges is the move to inverted device architectures since most MO deposition techniques are performed on bare ITO substrates as they involve either high temperature annealing to improve crystallinity, or the use of conductive substrates to fabricate planar and nanostructured thin films. If the two types of charge extracting layers are combined in one device a very stable MO/polymer blend/MO sandwich structure can be realised with an inert MO film around the delicate photoactive blend with greatly improved charge extraction.16 Additionally, when applied to inverted device architectures the favourable vertical phase separation of the photoactive blend with a higher concentration of the fullerene in the proximity of the electron extracting layer is advantageous, resulting in better overall charge extraction, improved current density (JSC) and larger fill factors (FF).19–21 Previous reports have involved the use of electrochemically grown ZnO nanorods and corrugated ZnO nanoridges, resulting in PCEs of up to 4.0%.22,23 Recently, a PCE of 4.4% has been demonstrated by integrating a cross-linked fullerene material layer between the ZnO and the blend layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a remarkable result for an inverted device architecture BHJ OPV device.24
In this article we compare the formation and properties of different types of ZnO films and assess their impact on OPV device behaviour when integrated into inverted BHJ P3HT:PCBM devices. With a PCE of up to 4.91% and very good operation stability using a ZnO/blend/WOx sandwich structure, the devices reported set a new benchmark in performance for inverted architectures which are comparable to those achieved by regular devices. Electro-deposition of ZnO is shown to offer the highest control over the experimental parameters. It allows the creation of a broad variety of different morphologies, grades of crystallinity and structures, as well as nanostructuring. The procedure is conducted at low temperature leading to planar films with high film crystallinity without thermal annealing and offers easy scalability to larger areas.25,26 Electro-deposition also allows better control over impurities, defects, vacancies and stoichiometry which all influence the photoconductive behaviour of ZnO.27,28 Our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of using ZnO interlayers in inverted BHJ OPVs for high PCE and good device stability, and in particular highlight the advantages of electro-deposition over the more commonly used spray-pyrolysis technique.
2. Experimental
2.1 
          ZnO interlayer preparation and characterisation
ITO-coated glass substrates (PsiOTec Ltd., 15 Ω sq−1) were ultra-sonicated for 10 minutes in acetone, methanol, 0.1 M sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and deionised water (18 MΩ cm, Ondeo Purite) prior to use. ZnO films prepared by spray pyrolysis (SP) were deposited onto ITO substrates at 400 °C from a solution of 0.2 M zinc acetate (Aldrich, 99.99%) dissolved in methanol followed by an annealing step at 400 °C for 20 minutes. Electro-deposited (ED) ZnO films were prepared in a three-electrode set up consisting of an ITO working electrode, a Ag/AgCl/KCl (3.5 M) reference electrode and a platinum mesh counter electrode. Electro-deposition was carried out potentiostatically using a computer-controlled potentiostat by applying a potential of −1.3 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode. The global reaction of ZnO electrodeposition is Zn2+ + NO3− + 2e− → ZnO + NO2−.29 The deposition was halted after a charge of 0.15 C cm−2 had been passed (8 seconds for a 1 cm2electrode). The deposition bath contained 0.1 M and 0.13 M Zn(NO3)2 (Aldrich, ≥99.0%) for films A-ED and B-ED respectively and was maintained at 85 °C. For B-ED the solution was kept at pH 2.5 by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid. All films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) in AC mode, and ultraviolet-visible (UV/vis) electronic absorption spectroscopy.
2.2 OPV device fabrication and assessment
The solution of P3HT (Rieke, >98% regioregular) and PCBM (Solenne, >99.5%) was prepared via dissolution of 20 mg mL−1 of each compound in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (Aldrich, 99%, anhydrous) and was left stirring at 40 °C for at least 36 hours under inert atmosphere and filtered (0.2 µm) prior to spin-coating. The blended solution was spin-coated onto ITO and ITO/ZnO substrates at 1000 rpm followed by drying for 45 min at room temperature and then annealing at 120 °C. The film thickness of the blends was about 140 nm. WOx (Aldrich, >99.9%) and aluminium were deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 10−7 mbar in a Kurt J. Lesker deposition chamber. Film thickness and deposition rate were monitored by calibrated quartz microbalances. WOx was deposited on top of the P3HT:PCBM layer with a thickness of 10 nm followed by aluminium as a top electrode with a final thickness of approximately 100 nm. The active area of the fabricated OPV devices is 0.06 cm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were recorded with a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source-meter. Solar irradiation of AM1.5G was simulated with a Newport Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was set to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using neutral density filters and measured with a Fraunhofer calibrated silicon photodiode (PV Measurements Inc.) with a KG-5 filter. All devices were tested in a sealed sample holder under nitrogen atmosphere. Further device analysis involved external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. Device optimisation experiments were carried out for B-ED, including thicker polymer blend layers of 173 nm deposited viaspin-coating. Operational stability measurements for extended testing times of up to 40 hours of constant light exposure were carried out with a tungsten halogen lamp calibrated at 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          ZnO interlayer

Transmission spectra of ITO and the three different ITO/ZnO samples—SP, A-ED and B-ED—are shown in Fig. 1. All three ITO/ZnO substrates show good transparency with little deviation from bare ITO. This suggests that the deposition of the ZnO layer is unlikely to be detrimental to subsequent device performance due to any undesirable light absorption.

The morphological properties of the three types of ZnO films are shown in Fig. 2, where FE-SEM and AFM images for SP (a and d), A-ED (b and e) and B-ED (c and f) substrates are presented including their corresponding AFM height cross-section profiles. It is evident how the film roughness increases in going from the SP sample with a root mean square roughness (RMS) of 12.7 nm, to electrochemical deposition with RMS values of 23.7 nm and 27.9 nm for the A-ED and B-ED samples respectively. This observation supports the data presented in Section 3.2 which shows that a rougher ZnO film structure leads to more efficient OPV devices with improved charge collection. The SEM images in Fig. 2(b) and (c) also highlight the different morphologies of the two electrochemically deposited ZnO layers.

Additional characterisation of the ZnO films was provided by XRD measurements. The preferential orientation of the films was estimated by calculating the texture coefficients (TC) using eqn (1): (1)TC(hkl) is the texture coefficient of the specific (hkl) plane, I(hkl) is the measured intensity, I0(hkl) is the relative intensity factor of the JCPDS, and n is the number of peaks considered. XRD patterns of the SP, A-ED and B-ED ZnO films are shown in Fig. 3. The three present strikingly different features in the region centred around 2θ = 36° and the TC value for the ZnO peaks are summarised in Table 1. The SP and A-ED films appear to have a more pronounced preferential orientation for the (002) plane (TC = 4.47 and 5.56 respectively) than the B-ED type, which has an in-plane (100) preferential orientation (TC = 2.10) instead. ZnO crystallises in a wurtzite structure with polar and non-polar faces. The (002) faces are polar whereas the (100) are neutral. These differences can lead to different affinities with the polymer blend at the inorganic–organic interface and help provide a qualitative explanation for the different performances of the OPV devices fabricated using the three different types of substrates (Section 3.2).

3.2 OPV device performance
A schematic of the basic inverted OPV device architecture including an electronic energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). A cross-section of a typical device was prepared by focussed ion beam milling before examination by TEM. A protection layer of Pt is deposited onto the surface of the area of interest prior to the milling to minimize the damage to the subsurface. The montage of bright field TEM images shown in Fig. 4(c) shows that a high quality layered structured has been formed over large areas with relatively sharp interfaces. It is interesting to note that the roughness at the ZnO/blend interface is consistent with the plane view AFM measurements, and that deposition of the blend results in planarization of the roughness before subsequent WOx deposition.

The J–V performance for the different inverted devices is shown in Fig. 5 and key device parameters are summarised in Table 2. When the SP ZnO interlayer is used, the devices provide a VOC of 0.48 V, a FF of 0.53, a JSC of 10.03 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.56%. This is a significant improvement with respect to the inverted reference device grown without a ZnO layer that gives a VOC of 0.41 V, a FF of 0.50, a JSC of 8.91 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 1.76% with a much lower overall performance consistency. Such behaviour highlights the need for the ZnO interlayer to achieve considerably higher and more reproducible performance. The inverted devices containing different electro-deposited ZnO interlayers result in even better performance with a VOC of 0.53 V and a FF of 0.52 for the A-ED device, and a VOC of 0.55 V and a remarkably high FF of 0.66 for the B-ED device. The JSC for the A-ED device was 9.26 mA cm−2, a value slightly lower than that obtained for the devices containing SP (10.03 mA cm−2) and B-ED (10.68 mA cm−2) ZnO.

The general trend of improvement in OPV performance, including the increase in VOC, FF and JSC compared to devices without the ZnO layer, can be explained by assuming a more efficient electron extraction mechanism by the ZnO interlayer as a consequence of the high electron mobility in ZnO.14 From a morphological perspective, the improvement in JSC can be explained by the increasing ZnO surface roughness (RMS values of 12.7 nm to 23.7 and 27.9 nm for the SP, A-ED and B-ED samples respectively), providing a larger extraction interface and a more penetrating electrode into the P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunction, thus reducing long distance free charge transport. The energy level alignment between the conduction band of ZnO (−4.1 to −4.4 eV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PCBM acceptor (−4.0 eV) also provides an energy level cascade towards the electrode with a more favourable injection into the ITO than when using ITO on its own (see Fig. 4(b)).7,8 The formation of an ohmic-like contact leads to an electrode (ITO/ZnO) pinning close to the PCBM LUMO as well as a band bending effect which helps to improve charge injection.30
Specific differences in J–V performance between the A-ED and B-ED devices can be explained on the basis of a closer alignment of the ZnO conduction band with the PCBM LUMO, due to a slightly lower electron affinity for B-ED compared to A-ED and SP. The smaller extent of band bending at this interface improves electron injection, which increases the JSC for the B-ED device. It is worth noting that the more randomly oriented ZnO film (B-ED) achieves better performance and also that the JSC is somehow inversely proportional to the TC of the (002) plane. The XRD results suggest a significant difference in the ZnO crystal structure for B-ED, showing a much less distinct preferential crystal alignment than the well expressed (002) preferential crystal alignment for SP and A-ED (see Table 1). As the work function of the material within a single crystal varies due to anisotropic density of state distributions for different crystal plane vectors, it is assumed that a more favourable overall work function, i.e. closer to the LUMO of the PCBM, is exposed at the ZnO/P3HT:PCBM interface for B-ED compared to the preferential (002) orientation in SP and A-ED. This results in an improved ohmic contact leading to a higher JSC and overall device performance. It suggests that highly oriented structures might not be the most suitable ones for efficient electron extraction at the inorganic–organic interface.
In addition to the improved electron injection characteristics associated with use of the ZnO layer, the ZnO also serves as an efficient hole blocking layer providing an energy barrier for holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the PCBM (−6.5 eV) to the ZnO valence band (−7.8 eV), as shown in Fig. 4(b).31 The ZnO interlayer also provides a more homogenous conducting layer on top of the ITO electrode bridging the inactive or dead spots which prevent efficient charge collection. Both contributions are reflected in the steep increase in FF from 0.44 without ZnO to 0.66 for B-ED and reduced variation in JSC.
Further support for efficient electron extraction and hole blockage due to the ZnO interlayer is provided by the light intensity studies shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The linear fit of the bi-logarithmic plot of incident light intensity (Pinc) against JSC results in a power-law coefficient γ of 0.97 for A-ED and 0.99 for B-ED, consistent with almost no bimolecular recombination.32 Even at high light intensities (3 suns) the J–V performance is consistently good. As a complementary measurement EQE studies carried out on the B-ED devices revealed a very high photon-to-free-charge conversion efficiency of 74.1% at 508 nm. The normalised EQE profile from 400 to 700 nm reproduces very well the shape of the absorption spectrum of the blend (Fig. 6(a)). Again, the rise to such high conversion efficiencies can be qualitatively explained by invoking an improved charge collection mechanism, and consequently a better charge collection efficiency, which is supported by the measured high FF of 0.66.

(a) Also shows a comparison of the normalised EQE to a thin film UV/vis electronic absorption spectrum of P3HT:PCBM. Plots of (c) JSC, (d) FF, (e) PCE and (f) VOC as a function of illumination time during continuous light exposure for 40 hours at 100 mW cm−2 for the B-ED and ITO reference device. 
For the top electrode the inverted devices are fabricated with a WOx interlayer that enhances hole extraction towards the Al electrode. Although a work function mismatch between P3HT and Al as well as an unfavourable Fermi-level alignment under short circuit conditions between ITO and Al in the inverted device architecture are assumed, the introduction of the WOx interlayer successfully compensates these energy alignment losses. This phenomenon allows avoidance of the use of expensive high work function metals such as gold or palladium.16,33
Stability measurements of the B-ED and ITO reference devices over continuous 40 hours illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6(c)–(f). Very little degradation of all key OPV parameters occurs in comparison to the reference device. The VOC decreased by only 1.7% for B-ED and 34.4% for the ITO reference device, the JSC by 8.4% and 20.2%, and the FF by 8.8% and 23.5%, resulting in an overall decline in PCE of 19.3% and 60.3% from the original performance of the two devices. For B-ED this degradation occurred primarily in the first few hours of illumination before stabilising at longer illumination times. The normalised EQE in Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows a decline in EQE at around 600 nm for the device without ZnO, attributed to P3HT degradation. There is no observable change in EQE profile after the same period of continuous illumination for the device fabricated on B-ED. The improved stability with the ZnO interlayer is believed to be due to the chemically stable MO layer protecting the polymer blend from direct contact with ITO and from UV irradiation which is responsible for the photodegradation.
Further optimisation of the most promising ZnO based device type (B-ED) involved the deposition of thicker P3HT:PCBM active layers with a thickness of 173 nm instead of 140 nm. This resulted in a VOC of 0.54 V, a FF of 0.65, a JSC of 13.45 mA cm−2 and a remarkable (average) PCE of 4.81%, with a maximum of 4.91%. This is the highest reported PCE for an inverted OPV BHJ device. The efficiency increase originates from the improved light harvesting of the thicker organic active layer. The results suggest that charge extraction remains very efficient. J–V measurements with varying light intensity showed that even with a thicker film almost no bimolecular recombination occurred, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.
Conclusions

Polymer blend BHJ OPV devices based on an electro-deposited ZnO interlayer combine the advantages of favourable blend vertical phase segregation of the deposited film with the PCBM rich phase on the electrode, and the use of inexpensive, inert metal oxide interlayers for efficient charge extraction and improved energy level alignment at the interfaces. In addition to a clear performance improvement, the inverted cell architectures offer great potential for controlled electron collecting, but also hole blocking electrode modification using ZnO layers. Electro-deposition of ZnO is shown to be a very promising thin film growth technique for electrode modification providing good control over layer thickness, nano- and micro-thin film morphology, as well as crystal orientation for favourable charge extraction and work function tuning. This deposition technique has several important advantages over other more common ZnO thin film growth processes with considerable potential for facile scalability to large areas.
The introduction of a ZnO interlayer between ITO and the photoactive polymer blend layer significantly improves the device performance compared to devices based on bare ITO. Notably it provides efficient electron extraction based on the formation of an ohmic contact at the electron extracting electrode/PCBM interface. Optimised device structures with a WO3 interlayer on the opposite electrode achieved a remarkable maximum PCE of 4.91%, an EQE of 74%, as well as good operational device stability in nitrogen and air.
