    , Accepted 30th April 2020First published on 30th April 2020AbstractTwo different terminal groups, rhodanine-flanked benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BR) and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IM2F), were connected to an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core to construct a new non-fullerene acceptor (IDTBF). Solar cells based on this acceptor exhibited promising photovoltaic performances with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 10.43%.
In the last decade, small molecule (SM) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) that can replace fullerene derivatives (e.g. phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) or indene-C70 bisadduct (ICBA)) in organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered increasing attention in light of their outstanding photovoltaic performance.1–6 So far, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16% have already been achieved in the polymer donor/SM-NFA systems.7,8 To further enhance the PCE values, various molecular engineering pathways have been paved, which led to the development of new NFAs. As an emerging kind of NFA, asymmetric NFAs, which were categorized according to their molecular symmetry, have made rapid progress in the past four years.9 Compared to their symmetric counterparts, asymmetric NFAs exhibit a higher intermolecular binding energy and larger dipole moment, both of which are beneficial to the reinforcement of donor/acceptor interaction, and hence increase the fill factor (FF) and PCEs of OSCs.9–11
Generally, a typical A–D–A structured calamitic NFA molecule is constructed with two main segments: a central electron-donating core (D) and an end-capping electron-accepting group (A). In most reports, great efforts have been devoted to designing certain new asymmetric donor-cores in order to construct the corresponding asymmetric NFAs. Only very limited literature about the asymmetrification of NFAs via terminal group (TG) modulation can be found.12–16 Besides the synthetic difficulties of attaching two different TGs to the central core, this situation might be attributed to the scarcity of excellent TGs. Thus far, only two kinds of TGs are capable of facilitating high performance binary OPV devices with PCEs of over 11%: 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IM) and its analogues, plus rhodanine-flanked benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BR) and its analogues. At present, IM, especially its di-fluorinated derivative 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IM2F), is recognized as one of the best TGs for NFAs.8 Hence, IM2F with its analogues began to be adopted in designing asymmetric NFAs as well.10,11 Regarding BR-based NFAs, although PCE records of their devices relatively lag behind, their unique advantages in reducing voltage losses have also attracted enormous attention.17–19 Yet surprisingly, BR-based asymmetric NFAs remain unreported.
 Scheme 1  Design inspiration and chemical structure of the asymmetric acceptor IDTBF. 
In this contribution, we present a new asymmetric NFA, IDTBF (Scheme 1). Two distinguished TGs, BR and IM2F, were consequently connected to a classic indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core to form the molecule. The device based on the polymer donor PM6 and IDTBF exhibits a promising PCE of 10.43%, which provides a new design strategy for asymmetric NFAs.
The synthetic procedure of IDTBF is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The brominated carbaldehyde of IDT (4) was prepared by the lithium–halogen exchange of the commercially available di-brominated IDT monomer 3, followed by quenching with anhydrous DMF in a yield around 65%. Then, the end-capping BR group was introduced via a 4-step continuous reaction: firstly, 1,3-propanediol acetal was synthesized to protect the aldehyde group of intermediate 4; secondly, the lithium–halogen exchange was performed again, followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride; then, the freshly prepared tin reagent of IDT was subjected to a Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction with brominated BR (compound 2); finally, diluted HCl was added for de-protection to obtain the aldehyde 5. It is worth noting that the aldehyde 5 exhibits poor stability, especially after being adsorbed onto the silica gel. So, we chose to run a flash column only once to obtain the crude aldehyde 5 without further purification. Finally, the IM2F group was introduced via a Knoevenagel condensation to yield IDTBF. The high-purity target compound was fully characterized by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (see the ESI†). In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1, ESI†) shows that IDTBF exhibits good thermal stability and decomposes (5% loss) only above 343 °C.
The light harvesting ability of IDTBF was characterized by using UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the diluted chloroform solution of the SM acceptor shows a narrow absorption band ranging from ca. 600 nm to 720 nm. While in the thin film (Fig. 1a), not only did the absorption peak notably red-shift from 675 nm to 723 nm, but also a significantly broadened absorption band ranging from ca. 600 nm to 800 nm was observed. And the formation of vibronic features present at ca. 655 nm in the thin film absorption profile suggested the ordered aggregation of acceptor molecules. Overall, the thin-film absorption of IDTBF makes it spectrally complementary with the wide band-gap polymer donor, which has a main absorption range of ca. 400–650 nm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the energy levels of the SM acceptor. The film of IDTBF on a glassy-carbon electrode was characterized in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 1c and Table 1, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDTBF determined by CV were −5.64 eV and −3.80 eV, respectively (Fig. 2).

To better understand how the two distinct TGs affect the photophysical properties of IDTBF, theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) to further investigate the donor–acceptor electronic structure on the molecular level.21 The DFT calculations indicate that in the IDTBF molecule, the two TGs (BR and IM2F) experience strong coupling to each other via the central IDT donor moiety, as evident from the even distribution of the LUMO orbital on both TGs and the large LUMO–LUMO+1 splitting (Fig. S4 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). As a result, there is only one CT transition from the HOMO distributed mainly on the donor moiety to the LUMO distributed on both TGs, while HOMO to LUMO+1 is a symmetry forbidden transition and could not contribute to the light absorption. So, similar to the two symmetric NFAs IDIC-4F and o-IDTBR, since there are not two separate transitions for each TG, only one π–π* transition band appears in either the solution or film absorption spectrum of IDTBF, and therefore the introduction of two different TGs is not able to broaden the absorption range as was initially expected (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To inspect the photovoltaic performance of the SM acceptor, organic solar cells were fabricated and characterized. Based on the excellent performance of P3HT:o-IDTBR-based solar cells, polymer donor screening was also started from P3HT.22 However, the P3HT:IDTBF combination only gave a PCE record of 1.35% with an inferior JSC (6.55 mA cm−2) and fill factor (36.07%). The classic low bandgap polymer donor PCE10 was piloted as well, and it gave a slightly enhanced PCE of 4.81% (Fig. S7 and Table S3, ESI†).23 Finally, PM6 was chosen as the ultimate donor due to its suitable energy levels and complementary absorption with IDTBF (Table 1 and Fig. 1a), and, more importantly, its high compatibility with the low bandgap NFAs.20,24
For PM6:IDTBF combination, devices with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Ag were fabricated (device area of 0.11 cm2). The device optimization conditions are detailed in the ESI† (Section S6). The current density–voltage (J–V) curve and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the optimized device are depicted in Fig. 2. In the champion device, a high PCE of 10.43% was realized along with a VOC up to 0.94 V, a JSC of 16.98 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.14%. Notably, the as-cast device of PM6:IDTBF already achieved a good PCE of 9.27% without any post-treatment (Table S5, ESI†); and in order to obtain the optimized device, solvent vapour annealing (SVA) was applied to tune the active layer morphology (Tables S7 and S8, ESI†). The PM6:IDTBF based devices showed a satisfactory photocurrent response in the range of 350 to 750 nm, agreeing well with their blend film absorption spectrum (Fig. S5, ESI†). The calculated current density value that was integrated from the EQE spectrum is 16.28 mA cm−2, which coincided with the measured one within 5% error.
The exciton dissociation probability in the OSC devices was investigated by measuring photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The charge dissociation probability, calculated from Jph/Jsat (detailed in ESI,† Section S8), of the PM6:IDTBF-based OSCs, is 0.939, indicating that an efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection occurred in the devices. The bimolecular recombiantion features of the optimized device were also examined qualitatively by measuring the J–V curves with different incident light intensities (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). It is noted that the α value of 0.988 was fitted for the devices of PM6:IDTBF, and this value suggested that the devices underwent weak bimolecular recombination; on the other hand, the device of PM6:IDTBF shows an n value of 1.89, which is directly correlated to the trap assisted recombination. So, it can be seen that the trap assisted recombination is the major recombination chanel in the devices of PM6:IDTBF.25–27
The carrier mobility was fitted from the dark J–V curves using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. As Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows, the hole- (μh) and electron- (μe) mobilities of PM6:IDTBF blend are 3.02 × 10−4 and 2.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The well-balanced μh/μe value (1.19) of the PM6:IDTBF-based device can guarantee efficacious charge transport and collection, consequently leading to an improved JSC and FF.
For a further in-depth morphological investigation on the active layer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed. Fig. 3 shows the AFM and TEM images of the optimized PM6:IDTBF blend film. As can be seen in Fig. S11 (ESI†), after being blended, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the active layer drastically changed from 1.40 (PM6 pristine film) and 0.68 (IDTBF pristine film) to 6.23 (PM6:IDTBF). The increased roughness demonstrated a large domain size and phase separation in the D:A blend, indicating that the miscibility of PM6 and IDTBF is unsatisfactory and the presence of trap assisted recombination.28,29 These features were also revealed in the TEM images in Fig. S12 (ESI†).

In summary, a new non-fullerene acceptor, IDTBF, featuring two different kinds of terminal group, BR and IM2F, was designed and synthesized. After being employed in OSCs with a polymer donor, PM6, a PCE of 10.43% with a VOC of 0.94 V and JSC of 16.98 mA cm−2 was achieved. This result paves a new way in the molecular design of NFAs for OSCs. More work on device optimization and molecular modification of IDTBF is underway in our laboratory.
