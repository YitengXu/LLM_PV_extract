    , Accepted 23rd September 2021First published on 24th September 2021AbstractFlexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention as a self-power supply for various electronic devices that require high power, various form-factors, and a light-weight power supply. In addition, many studies have investigated scalable and continuous roll-to-roll (R2R) processes, with the aim of mass production and commercialization of f-PSCs. In this review, we focus on the strategies developed in the last three years toward commercialization of high-efficiency, lightweight and ultra-flexible, and reliable perovskite solar modules (f-PSMs). Furthermore, the research perspectives of f-PSCs regarding their future development are addressed.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained considerable attention, with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.5% recorded in the past decade, owing to the superior optoelectronic properties of the perovskite materials.1 Simultaneously, due to the intrinsic mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures arising from the low formation energy of perovskite materials,2,3 flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) have attracted great attention for potential niche applications, such as those in portable electronics, health monitoring, integrated buildings systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as self-power supplies.4–8 Moreover, several reports have shown the potential of mass production of f-PSCs, which is a prerequisite for the commercialization of f-PSCs, using roll-to-roll (R2R) systems such as vacuum evaporation, doctor blade, gravure printing, and slot-die processing systems.9–13 With the advances in technology, commercialization technology of f-PSCs is developing in many perovskite materials and solar module companies, such as GreatCell Solar Limited, previously known as Dyesol, Sharechem, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Saule Technologies, Panasonic, and Frontier Energy Solutions.
However, there are several requirements that form obstacles in the commercialization of f-PSCs: (1) high efficiency to catch up with rigid-based PSCs, (2) lightweight and flexibility for various applications, and (3) long-term stability and quality control for scalable flexible perovskite solar modules (f-PSMs).
In the past three years, the PCE of f-PSCs has been remarkably improved from 19.51% (in 2019) to 21.10% (in 2021).14,15 However, the PCE of f-PSC is still quite a bit lower than that of rigid-based PSCs owing to the considerably different surfaces and intrinsic stability of rigid and plastic substrates.16,17 Efforts have been made to improve the PCE of f-PSCs by developing high-quality perovskite films, fast charge transport layers, and interfacial engineering at the interfaces on the plastic substrate.
Furthermore, lightweight and good flexibility are significantly important for application in power sources for next-generation flexible electronic devices such as biosensors and IoT devices.18,19 Since mechanical durability of perovskite materials has been verified, light weight and good flexibility of f-PSCs are strongly dependent on substrate materials. f-PSCs achieved a specific power per weight of 29.4 W g−1 on ultrathin polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils, which is the highest value reported for a lightweight solar cell.20 In addition, novel flexible substrates have been used to replace the low-fatigue-resistance ITOs as transparent electrodes for ultra-flexible f-PSCs.21–25
Large-area f-PSM processing and long-term stability are the most important requirements for the commercialization of f-PSCs. Various research groups and companies are developing scalable technologies using R2R printing to control the throughput and quality of large-area f-PSM. To date, f-PSMs have achieved a PCE of 15.5% with an aperture area of 100 cm2.26 However, most encapsulation technologies that ensure stability have been targeted at rigid PSCs.27–29 Recently, encapsulation of f-PSCs has been attempted, which is another key technology for the commercialization of f-PSCs.30,31
This review focuses on the cutting-edge strategies developed in the last three years toward commercialization of high-efficiency, lightweight, highly flexible, and reliable f-PSMs. Moreover, a research perspective regarding the future development of f-PSCs is discussed.
High-efficiency f-PSCs
High efficiency is a basic prerequisite for commercialization of f-PSCs. In particular, the development of perovskite light absorbers with lower trap density, utilization of novel electron and hole transport layers, and interfacial engineering to facilitate charge transport should be considered for high-efficiency f-PSCs. The history of photovoltaic performance of f-PSCs is summarized in Table 1.

Highly crystalline perovskite films with controlled trap densities
Controlling the nucleation and growth of perovskite films is key to obtaining high-quality perovskite films with high crystallinity and low trap density, thereby realizing high-efficiency f-PSCs on plastic substrates.40–42 Specifically, the use of additives in the perovskite precursor has been actively researched for controlling nucleation and growth of perovskite grains and reducing trap density in perovskite films on plastic substrates. Fig. 1 shows the strategies to grow highly crystalline perovskite films on flexible substrates. Wu et al. reported the synergetic effects of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and MACl as the ligand and additive, respectively, in the perovskite precursor to fabricate a high-quality FAPbI3 perovskite film on the flexible substrate.43 The crystallization process of the perovskite film was delayed using NMP to form an FAI·PbI2·NMP intermediate phase owing to the stronger interaction between NMP and the FA cation than DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). Additionally, MACl additives induced the phase transformation and crystal growth of the perovskite film through MAPbCl3−xIx as perovskite seeds, resulting in a large-grain, high-crystallinity, and low-trap-density perovskite film on a flexible substrate with a PCE of 19.38%.

Duan et al. introduced a mesoporous self-polymerized methyl methacrylate (sMMA)–PbI2 scaffold layer via interspersion of the in situ sMMA in PbI2, which provided effective nucleation sites for crystallization and cross-linking networks in grain boundaries during the two-step sequential deposition process.44 Consequently, sMMA–MAPbI3-based f-PSCs exhibited a PCE of 20.12% and high mechanical durability that maintained 72% of the initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles. Recently, the PCE of f-PSCs was remarkably improved to 21.10% using artemisinin molecules in the perovskite precursor.15 The FA-based mixed perovskite film of Cs0.05Rb0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.90 Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 was smooth and uniform and suppressed the formation of new deep level traps, owing to the strong interaction between carbonyl groups of artemisinin and uncoordinated Pb2+ ions.
Essentially, a single-crystal semiconductor possesses the lowest defect density in the film (single crystal: 109–1010 cm−3, polycrystalline: >1015 cm−3).45 Thus, epitaxial growth of perovskite films is the most efficient strategy to improve the film quality. Lei et al. reported a solution-based lithography-assisted epitaxial-growth-and-transfer method for fabricating single-crystal MAPb0.5+xSn0.5−xI3 perovskite films, which showed higher carrier transport and stability than polycrystalline perovskite, resulting in a PCE of 20.04% with high stability.46
Charge transport layer on the flexible substrate
In early studies of f-PSCs, the development of high-quality charge transport layers (CTLs) at fabrication temperatures below 150 °C to enhance the efficiency of f-PSCs was a major research area. In n–i–p structures, electron transport layers (ETLs) such as those of ZnO, TiO2, and SnO2 have been investigated for the purpose of fabricating uniform thin films with high crystallinity using various deposition methods, such as spray deposition, chemical bath deposition, atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering, UV sintering, and nanocolloid deposition.3,47–50 In particular, SnO2 colloid as an ETL has attracted tremendous interest for f-PSCs due to excellent electrical properties compatible with those of the perovskite layer.51 Recently, You et al. fabricated heparin potassium (HP)-regulated SnO2 nanocrystals, which induced vertically aligned crystal growth of the perovskite film by strengthening the interface contact between the ETL and the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 2(a).52 The f-PSC using HP–SnO2 demonstrated a PCE of 19.47% on a flexible substrate. Fig. 2(b) shows a novel ETL structure composed of porous Zn2SnO4 and planar SnO2 layers on a flexible substrate.26 This porous-planar ETL was designed to develop highly crystalline perovskite films and compatible band alignment, which improve the charge collection efficiency, resulting in the highest PCE of 20.7% with a certified efficiency of 19.9% for f-PSCs.

The organic hole transport layer (HTL) has been widely investigated due to its easy applicability on flexible substrates at low temperatures. By contrast, although NiOx is an inorganic HTL, it is difficult to deposit it as a thin layer on a flexible substrate and control the numerous defects at the NiOx interfaces at low temperatures; NiOx-based f-PSCs show a higher PCE and stability than organic-HTL-based f-PSCs with a p–i–n structure.53 The defect engineering of NiOx interfaces has been investigated to improve the electrical properties (i.e., carrier mobility, Fermi level, band gap, and electron affinity) with the concentration of Ni3+ or the additional formation of NiOOH using organic molecules, and various dopants (Cu2+, Mg2+, Cs+, Ag+, and Li+).39,54–58 Recently, Ouyang et al. reported Li and Cu co-doped NiOx nanoparticles that improved the electrical conductivity and transmittance of uniform NiOx films, as shown in Fig. 2(c).59 Additionally, the non-wetting surface of NiOx can induce a large grain size owing to the suppression of heterogeneous nucleation during the crystallization of the perovskite film; thus, the co-doped NiOx-based f-PSCs achieve a PCE of 18.2%. Fig. 2(d) shows the modified Fermi level and valence band of NiOx for various organic molecules with different electron affinities in the NiOx precursors.39 Among them, 3,6-difluoro-2,5,7,7,8-hexacyanoquinodimethane (F2HCNQ)-modified NiOx demonstrated improved conductivity and hole extraction capacity by over ten and five times, respectively, resulting in the best PCE of 20.01% with over 80% fill factor for f-PSCs.
Interface engineering between perovskite and charge transport layers
The interfaces between the perovskite and CTL contain a large number of defects because of the heterointerfaces and the sublimation of A site organic cations by thermal annealing. Additionally, the surface properties of CTL play a crucial role in the nucleation and growth of the perovskite film, which affects the number of defects, grain size, and uniformity of the perovskite film during the crystallization process. Fig. 3 shows the various strategies for interface engineering of the perovskite and CTL by introducing novel interfacial layers. Hong et al. reported the use of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) between the perovskite and a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) layer on top of the perovskite layer to passivate the grain boundaries and the surface of the perovskite.60 Furthermore, the glued EVA shows a hydrophobic surface and enhanced adhesive interaction between the perovskite and PC61BM, which lead to a high PCE of 15.2% with excellent waterproofness and flexibility.

In front interfaces, Wang et al. introduced a simple bifacial passivation strategy at the interfaces between NiOx and perovskites using hydroiodic acid (HI) treatment on the NiOx film, which produces NiI2 by reduction, thereby optimizing the electrical properties and reducing the interfacial defects.61 In addition, the formation of Pb–I bonds at the interfaces induces the orderly growth of the perovskite film with a large grain size, which enabled a high PCE of 19.04% for 1 cm2 area. The biomimetic structure of vertebrae with ITO/PEDOT:EVA interfacial layer/perovskite was designed to improve the performance of f-PSCs with excellent mechanical stability, as shown in Fig. 3(c).5 This bionic interface layer accurately controls the crystallization of the perovskite film and acts as an adhesive, resulting in a PCE of 19.87% at 1.01 cm2 area with stable mechanical flexibility that retains over 85% of its initial efficiency after 7000 narrow bending cycles. Dong et al. presented a holistic design of interpenetrating perovskite/ETL structure using an FAI-incorporated SnO2 layer as an ETL and a perovskite layer with PbI2 excess, thereby leading to a cascade electronic structure that improves the charge transport properties62 (Fig. 3(d)). Additionally, the interpenetrating perovskite/ETL layer can retard a peel-off of the perovskite/ETL interface by compressive strain, which results in remarkable mechanical endurance and a high efficiency of 20.1% for f-PSCs. Consequently, the commonality to enhance the PCEs of f-PSCs in three approaches, such as additives in the perovskite precursor, novel charge transport layer, and interfacial engineering is how to improve the quality of the perovskite film on the plastic substrates. However, the quality of perovskite films is still low, which results in lower PCE than the rigid-based cells. Therefore, it is required to fundamentally understand the nucleation and growth of the perovskite film on the different surface properties of plastic substrates, compared to rigid substrates.
Ultra-flexible and lightweight flexible perovskite solar cells
To enhance the flexibility of f-PSCs, various alternative materials such as graphene, metal plate/mesh/nanowires, carbon nanotubes and conducting polymers have been investigated as transparent electrodes to replace ITO, which is brittle.36,63,64 However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve the various advantageous properties of ITO, including high conductivity, transmittance, and flexibility. Recently, hybrid transparent electrodes were investigated to improve the mechanical durability for f-PSCs. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the novel hybrid transparent electrodes of Ni-embedded polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PH 1000, and Cu grid-embedded polyimide and a graphene capping layer, respectively.24,65 These electrodes exhibited higher electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and mechanical properties than those of ITO on plastic substrates.

PEDOT:PSS as a conducting polymer is a promising alternative owing to its solution processability and flexibility. Although PEDOT:PSS exhibited excellent flexibility and lightweight performance with specific power-per-weight of 23 W g−1, it had a low PCE because of the low conductivity of PEDOT:PSS below 2000 S cm−1.4 Recently, Hu et al. reported the use of a conducting polymer network electrode as a transparent electrode on PET substrates using zinc di[bis(trifluoromenthylsulfonyl)imide] (Zn(TFSI)2) as a dopant in PEDOT:PSS.25 The electrical and optical properties of the network electrode were significantly improved with a conductivity of 4100 S cm−1 and transmittance of 85%. Therefore, the f-PSCs achieved a high PCE of 19% and strong mechanical properties, retaining 85% of their initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm.
f-PSCs have been commonly fabricated on ITO/PEN (or PET) flexible substrates with thicknesses of 0.2 (ITO) and 125 μm (PEN). In addition, the total thickness of the active layer (Au/HTL/perovskite/ETL) is under 1 μm, indicating that the weight of f-PSCs is dependent on the weight of the plastic substrates. Thus, the flexibility can be improved and the weight can be reduced simultaneously by simply reducing the thickness of the plastic substrates. Lee et al. reported crumpling-durable f-PSCs using a hybrid transparent electrode on an ultrathin PET substrate with 2.5 μm thickness, as shown in Fig. 4(d).66 This ultrathin substrate retained extreme bendable properties of the f-PSCs even after 10000 cycles of bending at a curvature radius of 0.5 mm. Furthermore, a thinner PEN substrate of 1.3 μm thickness exhibited extremely low weight with a specific power-per-weight of 29.4 W g−1 (Fig. 4(e)).20 As discussed above, the flexibility and lightweight of f-PSCs are considerably dependent on the weight of plastic substrates. However, the photovoltaic performance of f-PSCs is slightly decreased on ultrathin substrates because of several issues that are hard to handle in fabricating f-PSCs, and the low conductivity of the transparent electrode.
Large-area reliable flexible perovskite solar module
The high efficiency of PSCs has been improved via spin-coating fabrication technology on small devices, leading to the most promising candidates for next-generation solar cells. Subsequently, the fabrication technology needs a scalable process with efficient quality control to reduce the cost and produce a safe product with long-term stability and human/environment friendliness.
The fabrication of f-PSCs has almost reached the large-scale R2R mass production process; however, the efficiency of f-PSMs is considerably lower than that of small-area devices. Furthermore, the prevention of exposure to Pb ions and the long-term device stability should be solidly ensured by introducing encapsulation technologies.
Large-area fabrication and flexible perovskite solar modules
Scalable f-PSCs have been investigated using various deposition technologies, such as slot-die, spray, evaporator, and gravure coating.9,10,12,67 The major issue is the control of the nucleation and growth of the perovskite film during the continuous process that keeps moving. Fig. 5 shows a scalable f-PSC process and the recorded-efficiency of the f-PSCs. Kim et al. reported a novel approach, i.e., hot-deposition heating of the coating bed to 130 °C to enable high-quality perovskite film formation during the slot-die R2R process, as shown in Fig. 5(a).11 The resultant film exhibited a PCE of 11.7% obtained from a full R2R process for f-PSCs. Additionally, high-throughput large-area vacuum deposition was investigated using low-temperature annealing under vacuum, as shown in Fig. 5(b).9 The optimized annealing temperature of 60 °C is the critical temperature for continuous reaction between PbI2 and FAI, which results in high-quality perovskite films on large-area flexible substrates (300 cm2). Kim et al. reported fully R2R gravure-printed PSCs developed via antisolvent bathing using tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH):ethyl acetate (EA) as an eco-friendly antisolvent.68 Notably, the polarity of the antisolvent affects the high-quality perovskite film with a large grain size, uniform surface coverage, and less defects. Consequently, R2R gravure-printing and tBuOH:EA bathing resulted in the highest PCE reported for R2R-processed PSCs, i.e., 16.7% for PSCs with R2R-processed SnO2/FA-perovskite and 13.8% for fully R2R-produced PSCs.

Despite the development of R2R mass production for f-PSCs, f-PSMs are rarely reported and still exhibit poor performance. This is because of the degradation of the plastic substrate when applying a high-power laser during its scribing. Recently, a UV laser could minimize the damage of a plastic substrate during a scribing process, and the porous ETL layer efficiently supports the coverage on the large height difference ITO and plastic area after P1 scribing. As a result, f-PSMs achieved PCEs of 15.5, 12.9, and 11.8% on aperture areas of 100, 225, and 400 cm2, respectively.26 This work significantly promotes the development of f-PSMs.
Reliable flexible perovskite solar cells
The low intrinsic stability of perovskites under water and oxygen is the major barrier for the commercialization of f-PSCs. Many efforts have been made to block the water and oxygen molecules inside the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long-term stability of the films, using encapsulation on PSCs without any degradation. Among the encapsulation technologies, use of a sandwiched structure using glass and a resin, which is a common technique, can effectively protect the device from the external environment; however, this structure is rigid.29 Recently, a sandwiched structure of PEN/ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/Au/ITO/PEN was reported for f-PSCs, as shown in Fig. 6(a).30 Both sides of the PEN substrates improved the bending lifetime and long-term stability of f-PSCs. In addition, Fig. 6(b) shows the lamination process for the edge-encapsulated sandwich structure of PSCs using conductive poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT) doped with nonhygroscopic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) as a hole transporting glue layer.69 Furthermore, the dry-transferred multilayer graphene encapsulant on top of the f-PSCs was investigated for highly stable f-PSCs that exhibit outstanding waterproofness, retaining 95 and 82.4% of the initial efficiency after 100 h of exposure to 85–90% relative humidity and 3700 h in ambient air, respectively.31 (Fig. 6(c)) PEN and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) are the most common flexible substrates for f-PSCs. Thus, an encapsulation layer must be ensured at the backside of the flexible substrate because of its high permeability to water and oxygen. Cho et al. reported plasma-polymerized-fluorocarbon (PPFC) thin films as an antireflection (AR) layer to improve the transmittance with self-cleaning effect and delayed penetration of water into the substrate, as shown in Fig. 6(d). The f-PSCs with this back-contact AR film on the flexible substrate exhibited an improved PCE from 18.6 to 20.4% and long-term stability with a lower PCE decay rate (2.3% per 100 h) than that of the control device (4.7% per 100 h).70

The remaining issue is how to prevent the leakage of Pb ions when the perovskite materials break unexpectedly; Pb ions are a major component in perovskite materials, and a method to prevent their leakage should be devised. This is a critical issue and should be solved for compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive for the final product of f-PSCs.71 A Pb-absorbing film was recently designed to prevent the leakage of Pb ions from PSCs, using P,P′-di(2-ethylhexyl)methanediphosphonic acid (DMDP) molecules as a transparent Pb-absorbing film on the glass side and a blended polymer with N,N,N′,N′-ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonic acid) (EDTMP) as a lead-chelating agent between the metal electrode and a standard photovoltaic packing film72 (Fig. 6(e)). Therefore, Pb leakage from devices soaked in water was significantly reduced to 0.2 ppm, demonstrating a promising strategy for realizing human and environment friendly f-PSCs.
The quality control and safety of f-PSMs should be addressed to commercialize the PSCs in the solar industry, because the f-PSCs, targeting a niche market, such as portable and wearable devices, will be integrated with various flexible electronics, especially around humans.
Summary and outlook
The development of f-PSCs in the last three years has been rapidly progressing toward commercialization. In this review, several strategies for the commercialization of f-PSCs were discussed regarding three aspects of f-PSMs: (1) high efficiency, (2) ultra-flexibility and light weight, and (3) large-area reliability. The PCE of f-PSCs is being improved by introducing highly crystalline perovskite films, developing novel CLT, and employing interfacial engineering at the heterointerfaces, thereby achieving the highest PCE of 21.10% for the f-PSCs. Additionally, the lightweight and ultra-flexible PSCs exhibited excellent mechanical durability and the highest specific power per weight of 29.4 W g−1 when using a thin substrate and an alternative transparent electrode. A scalable R2R process and encapsulation technology can promote the industrialization of large-area-reliable f-PSMs with long-term stability as well as human and environmental friendliness.
High efficiency f-PSCs are being developed by improving the crystallinity of perovskite film on the flexible substrates. Basically, the defect density of polycrystalline perovskite film (1015–1016 cm−3) is much higher than that of single crystal perovskite (109–1010 cm−3). Thus, the nucleation and growth of perovskite on plastic substrates is one of the most important factors because it controls the point, surface and interface, and grain boundary defects in perovskite films. However, there is still much lack of understanding, such as the crystallization effect of perovskite films on the low surface tension and slow heat transfer behavior on the polymer substrates, compared to that on the rigid substrates. In addition, the low transmittance of the polymer substrate should be improved for the high-efficiency f-PSCs by employing an anti-reflective film.
For the lightweight and flexibility of f-PSCs, the specific power per weight of an f-PSC achieved the highest value of 29.4 W g−1, compared to other solar cells. This improvement is due to employing the thin polymer substrate and hybrid transparent electrodes due to the high conductivity and transmittance of metal grid or graphene embedded electrodes. To apply flexible electronics such as portable, and wearable devices, mechanical durability is important under realistic conditions, such as crumpling and stretching, toward commercialization of f-PSCs. The additional protective layer can shift the neutral plane axis on the perovskite layer during the folding or crumpling of f-PSCs, which provides high mechanical durability for practical flexible electronics.
Targeting the commercialization of f-PSC, an R2R process has been developed to achieve the goal of a high-quality control process of each layer that includes the charge transport layer and perovskite layer. However, R2R, fully printed f-PSCs are still low in PCE, <14%. It is necessary to carry out more research for developing advanced precursors for each layer by introducing additives. In addition, the performance of f-PSM is also relatively low, compared to rigid-based PSMs. The conventional nanosecond laser causes undesirable scribing on the plastic substrates, because of high pulse energy. Thus, the ultrashort pulse or wet etching process is the most promising to optimize the monolithic structure of f-PSMs. The encapsulation layer should be further developed by mimicking OLED encapsulation technologies such as organic/inorganic multilayer films for the acceptable long-term stability of f-PSCs, and by introducing novel materials with fast adsorption kinetics and high adsorption capacity to capture the exposed toxic ions immediately for a safe product of f-PSCs.
In future, high-power, ultra-flexible, and lightweight f-PSCs with improved specific power per weight will be used in electronic devices such as satellites, drones, and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. The specific power per weight of solar cells is crucial to improve the flight time of airplanes without burning fossil fuels at high altitudes and ultra-flexibility can effectively be applied to the curved surface of the airplanes. The development of f-PSMs will require considerably more effort to obtain acceptable PCEs on large-area flexible modules, compared to that for rigid PSMs. Finally, reliable long-term stability and Pb-leakage prevention of f-PSMs should be ensured by using advanced encapsulation technologies, for extreme environmental conditions such as those of temperature, pressure, and radiation.
