The complexes have been photophysically and electrochemically characterized and have been used as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). In DSSCs with an acetonitrile-based electrolyte the cells comprising of Ru(2-(1-(4-hexylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)(NCS)2 TBA salt 1 showed an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.8% under full sunlight intensity, and Ru(2-(4-(4-hexylphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)pyridine)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)(NCS)2 TBA salt 2 an efficiency of 4.7%. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay measurements showed an enhanced performance for dye 1 due to faster electron transport into the TiO2 film and lower recombination rate in comparison to dye 2 sensitized devices. Additionally, solid-state devices were prepared with 2 μm thick TiO2 films using spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transport material. The solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells showed power conversion efficiencies of 1.92% and 0.38% for sensitizer 1 and 2, respectively.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have attracted great interest in materials science in the past years. First results were reported in 1991,1 and ever since chemists are in search of new dyes which appear as suitable sensitizers in titanium dioxide-based organic photovoltaic cells.2 DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies over 10% were initially demonstrated using prototype cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis[2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid] Ru(II) (N3), its bis-tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt counterpart N719 or black dye [tri(thiocyanato)-(4,4′,4′′-[2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine] tricarboxylic acid] Ru(II) as sensitizers. The dyes are the key-components in DSSCs as they absorb sunlight and induce intramolecular charge transfer from the ancillary ligand to the anchoring ligand with subsequent electron injection into the TiO2 semiconductor. In this respect, numerous reports about bipyridine-Ru(II) dyes, which, for example were functionalized with either hydrophobic chains to improve the device stability or with elongated π-systems to enhance absorption have been published.3
In general, bi- and terpyridines (bpy and terpy) are the most frequently investigated ligands for ruthenium(II) complexes.4 Relatively little is known about Ru(II) complexes in which 1,2,4-triazoles5 or 1,2,3-triazoles are used as chelating ligands. However, growing interest in 1,2,3-triazolyl-derivatives as chelates is evolving since 2001, when the “click-chemistry” approach was presented.6a In particular, the 1,3-dipolar Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition of azides and terminal acetylenes is widely used in various areas in order to build up a diverse series of 1,2,3-triazoles under mild reaction conditions and in high yields.6–8
Very recently, several bi- and terdentate ligands such as (1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridines,7a,c,d,8a,b 2,6-bis(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridines7b,8c and 4,4′-bis(1,2,3-triazoles)7c–e and their corresponding Ru(II) complexes were synthesized using click-chemistry. Crystallographic analysis has shown that upon replacing one pyridyl unit with one triazolyl unit in the Ru(II) coordination sphere, the geometry of the complex is only slightly affected.8b,c Complexes with asymmetrical triazolyl-pyridine ligands were generally isolated as isomeric mixtures. Concerning the photophysical properties of such compounds, it was observed that with an increasing number of triazole rings the HOMO/LUMO energy gap of the octahedral Ru(II) complex increases in comparison to their bi- and terpyridine counterparts.8a,c As a result, the absorption and emission spectra are blue-shifted. Triazolyl-pyridine has a higher acceptor strength compared to bipyridine, therefore, better back-bonding from the Ru(II) metal centre to the ligand-centered π* orbital is possible, which lowers the metal-centered highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and increases the π* orbital energy of the triazolyl ligand. In heteroleptic complexes, with one bpy ligand and a triazolyl-pyridine ligand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mostly located on the bpy ligand, because the π* orbital of the triazole ligand is more destabilized. In general, one can say that the LUMO is shifted to higher energies with an increasing number of triazole units in the Ru(II) complex, but it also strongly depends on the nature of the substituents which are attached to the triazole or the pyridine. Acceptor substituents are able to lower the LUMO energy and they show the biggest influence if they are linked to the bpy chelator or to the pyridine moiety in the triazolyl-pyridine ligand.8
In search of new ligands for Ru(II) dyes in DSSCs it is shown that pyridines can successfully be replaced by other N-containing ligands, for example, pyrazoles.9 In a recent report, the click-chemistry approach was used to functionalize the periphery of an ancillary bipyridine-ligand in a Ru(II) dye,10 while there are no examples reported up to now where 1,2,3-triazoles have been used as chelating ligands in Ru(II) sensitizers for solar cell applications. In order to gain more insight into structure–property-device performance relationships, we report herein the synthesis of new dithiocyanato-(1H-1,2,3-triazolyl-pyridine)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-carboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) dyes 1 and 2. The photophysical and electrochemical investigations provide insight into the electronic structure and potential applicability of the novel dyes. The complexes were incorporated and characterized in DSSCs using a volatile solvent-based electrolyte on one hand and a solid-state organic hole conductor (spiro-MeOTAD) as redox mediator on the other hand.
Results and discussion
Synthesis

Azides
4 and 8 were synthesized from their corresponding halidesvia a Cu(I)-catalyzed substitution reaction with sodium azide,11 (Scheme 1). The click-reaction was performed either by in situ deprotection of the trimethylsilyl-protected ethynyl group with potassium fluoride or directly with the deprotected ethynyl compound. Ligand 6 was obtained in 89% yield by the Cu(I)-catalyzed click-reaction of azide 4 and trimethylsilyl-protected ethynylpyridine 5 at room temperature. However, in the case of ligand 10 the reaction is much slower at room temperature. Therefore, click-reaction of azide 8 and ethynyl compound 9 were performed under reflux conditions for five days and ligand 10 was obtained in 73% yield.

The Ru(II) dyes 1 and 2 were obtained from a one-pot synthesis in which di-μ-chloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer was used as a precursor (Scheme 2). In a first step, the Ru(II) precursor was reacted with ligands 6 and 10, respectively, in the second step, 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (dcbpy) was introduced and in the last reaction step thiocyanate was added. Both complexes were purified via Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography with methanol as eluent. After precipitation, the dyes were isolated as mono-TBA salt. The structures were confirmed by 1H-NMR and ESI high resolution mass spectroscopy. The proton NMR spectrum showed two isomers for each compound (fac- and mer-isomer in a ratio of 2:1 for 1 and 3:1 for 2), which could not be separated viacolumn chromatography. It has been previously reported that the isomers are generally difficult to separate when bidentate triazolyl-pyridine were used as ligands.8a

Photophysical properties
Absorption and emission spectra of dyes 1 and 2 are depicted in Fig. 1. Both dyes show broad absorption from the UV region up to 650 nm. The high energy absorption band at 250–300 nm can be assigned to intraligand π–π* transitions. Both dyes show two additional absorption bands at lower energies which can be attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCT). Dye 1 showed the lowest energy MLCT absorption band at 493 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 7600 L mol−1 cm−1, which is lower than the higher energy MLCT band (λmax = 369 nm, ε = 12000 L mol−1 cm−1). In contrast, dye 2 showed the lowest energy MLCT band at 465 nm with a higher extinction coefficient of 9200 L mol−1 cm−1 than the higher energy MLCT band at 366 nm (ε = 8000 L mol−1 cm−1). The lowest energy MLCT band of 2 is blue-shifted by 30 nm compared to 1. In comparison to bipyridine-based Ru(II) dyes the new dyes exhibit blue-shifted absorption bands with lower molar extinction coefficients.3
 Fig. 1  
UV-VIS and normalized emission spectra of dye 1 and 2, measured in acetonitrile. Emission spectra were measured in aerated acetonitrile solution with c ∼ 10−5 mol L−1 (λex = 480 nm). 
Emission maxima of dyes 1 and 2 are found at 738 and 765 nm, respectively, when excited at 480 nm, in the region of the lowest energy MLCT absorption. A large Stoke's shift was observed for both dyes 1 (6734 cm−1) and 2 (8433 cm−1), which is an indication of significant structural changes between the ground and excited state. Similar to the absorption spectra, the emission bands are also blue-shifted compared to bipyridine-based Ru(II)-complexes.
Electrochemical properties
The redox behaviour of the dyes was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in DMF solutions containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 2). The data is presented in Table 1. The redox properties of both dyes are similar. They show two irreversible oxidation waves, one around 0.3 V and the second at about 0.4 V vs.Fc/Fc+. The first oxidation wave can be attributed to the RuII/RuIII oxidation, whereas the second wave can be assigned to the oxidation of the NCS ligand. Both dyes 1 and 2, display one reversible reduction wave at −2.15 V, which can be assigned to the one electron reduction of the dcbpy ligand. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction waves, respectively. The smaller band gap obtained for 1 (Eg = 2.12 eV) compared to 2 (Eg = 2.19 eV) is in agreement with the red-shift of the absorption spectrum. For an efficient sensitizer in DSSCs the LUMO energy level has to be higher in energy than the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode, ensuring efficient electron transfer from the excited dye into the titanium dioxide semiconductor. The HOMO level has to be sufficiently low in energy to accept electrons from the I3−/I−-based redox electrolyte (Fig. 3). Thus, the HOMO/LUMO energy values of 1 and 2 fit well with the energy levels of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum) and I3−/I− (−4.83 eV vs. vacuum).

 Fig. 3  Representation of the HOMO/LUMO energies of sensitizers 1 and 2 together with TiO2 and I3−/I−. 
In order to get a better insight into the location of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels we performed semi-empirical calculations using the ZINDO/1 method to optimize the geometry of both dyes. Fig. 4 depicts molecular orbitals of 1 and 2 at HOMO − 1 to LUMO + 1 levels. In both complexes the electron density in the HOMO and HOMO − 1 is distributed homogeneously on the Ru(II) and the thiocyanate ligands. The LUMO is located on the anchoring ligand in both dyes 1 and 2. However, the LUMO + 1 in 2 is located on the dicarboxybipyridine and on the triazol-1-yl-pyridine ligand, whereas in 1 the LUMO + 1 is situated only on the dicarboxybipyridine anchoring ligand. Therefore, the strength of the MLCT transition from the Ru(NCS)2 moiety to the dcbpy ligand is reduced in 2 and therefore electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2 semiconductor in a DSSC might be better for sensitizer 1.

Photovoltaic performance
Both dyes 1 and 2 were tested in liquid and solid-state DSSCs and the data is presented in Table 2. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices prepared with an acetonitrile-based electrolyte (Z959) are depicted in Fig. 5, together with their corresponding dark-current curves. The devices were prepared using a double layer TiO2 film which consisted of a transparent 8 μm thick layer and a 5 μm scattering layer, and DINHOP (dineohexyl bis(3,3-dimethylbutyl)phosphinic acid) was added as co-adsorbent to the dye solution. The IPCE spectrum of 1 covers a broad range from 380 to 700 nm, reaching its maximum of 77% at 500 nm, whereas the IPCE spectrum of 2 is slightly blue-shifted with a maximum of 58% at 480 nm.

 Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrent density–Voltage (J–V) characteristic and (b) incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of acetonitrile-based devices using 1 and 2 sensitizers. Electrolyte composition (Z959): 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15). 
Under full sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) the dye 1-sensitized device exhibited an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), fill-factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) of 761 mV, 13.2 mA cm−2, 0.77 and 7.8%, respectively. On the other hand, a dye 2-sensitized device gave a VOC of 673 mV, JSC of 8.9 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.77, yielding a lower η of 4.7%. The power conversion efficiency of dye 1 bearing the 1,2,3-triazol-4-yl ligand is superior to the 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl counterpart dye 2 under similar conditions. Considering the lower molar extinction coefficient and the blue-shift in the absorption spectrum of 1 compared to other bipyridine-based Ru(II) sensitizers, such as Z-907,3c the device with a power conversion efficiency of 7.8% is quite impressive. The higher photocurrent density in the case of the dye 1-based device can be explained by an increase in the light absorbing capability of the dye 1-sensitized TiO2 film. The higher Voc in case of the dye 1-based device is due to either the reduction of charge recombination or the upward shift of the conduction-band edge position. In order to elaborate more on this assumption, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were performed on these devices.
As shown in Fig. 6a, the structural differences of the two sensitizers have a significant effect on the photocurrent decay rate across the TiO2 film and on the slope of decay rate vs. charge density measured under open circuit conditions. At identical charge density, the photoinduced electrons in the case of the dye 1-based device diffuse faster through the TiO2 film than those of the dye 2-based device, resulting from a larger number of occupied trap states for the given Fermi level in the TiO2 film.
 Fig. 6  (a) Open circuit transient photocurrent decay rate for DSSC devices sensitized with complexes 1 and 2 as a function of photoinduced charge density. (b) Charge recombination lifetime vs. photoinduced charge density of the two devices measured at open circuit conditions. 

Fig. 6b shows the dependence of the charge recombination lifetime on the photoinduced charge density. The recombination lifetime is determined by the reciprocal of the photovoltage decay rate obtained from a small perturbation voltage decay technique. The value of the charge density is obtained from the experimental measurements by collecting electrons when switching the device from open circuit to short circuit conditions.13 It is noted that the dye 1-sensitized device shows a longer charge recombination lifetime than that of the dye 2-sensitized device at an identical photoinduced charge density, clearly suggesting an advantage of 1 in retarding charge recombination. However, this influence becomes smaller under incident low light intensity where fewer charges are accumulated in the TiO2 film.
The VOC as a function of incident light intensity is displayed in Fig. 7. The VOC of both devices changes linearly according to the logarithm of the light intensity with the slope of 99 mV per decade and 102 mV per decade for devices sensitized with dyes 1 and 2, respectively. The almost identical slopes indicate that the trap states on the surface of TiO2 are identical when both dyes are sensitized on TiO2. The slope of 59 mV per decade is reported for an ideal diode.14a The difference in the slope between the ideal diode and the real devices is attributed to a non-linear recombination occurring in the DSSCs.14b
 Fig. 7  Open-circuit voltage of the DSSC based on sensitizer 1 and 2, plotted versus the light intensity, with illumination from a white LED light source. 
The 1 and 2dyes were also used as sensitizers for solid-state devices using spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) as a hole transport material. The power conversion efficiencies of 1.92% and 0.38% were obtained for 1- and 2-containing devices, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2. Similar to the liquid-devices, in the solid-state cells dye 1 outperforms dye 2 sensitized cells. In comparison to liquid electrolyte devices, the JSC of the solid-state devices are lower. This is mainly due to thin TiO2 films (2 μm) used in the solid-state devices which limits the photocurrent density.
Conclusion
We have shown that click-chemistry is a beneficial approach in the design of new chelating ligands for Ru(II) sensitizers in DSSCs. Two new substituted 1,2,3-triazol ligands were synthesized via the 1,3-dipolar Cu(I)- catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition (click-reaction). Their corresponding heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes 1 and 2 were prepared and used as sensitizers in liquid and solid-state DSSCs. They have shown overall power conversion efficiencies up to 7.8% which is a remarkable value considering that in comparison to other bipyridine-based Ru(II) sensitizers the absorption spectra are considerably blue-shifted and the molar extinction coefficients are significantly lower. The transient absorption spectral studies revealed that the higher photovoltaic performance of devices with dye 1 is due to the faster electron transport into the TiO2 film and a lower recombination rate in comparison to the dye 2-sensitized devices. The large difference in device performance correlates with minor structural changes in the isomeric ligands 4 and 8, and in the corresponding Ru(II) complexes 1 and 2, which is the different substitution pattern of the 1,2,3-triazole unit. Taking into account that it is possible to red-shift and to increase the absorption of these dyes by, e.g., extending the π conjugation, a new class of highly efficient 1,2,3-triazolyl-pyridine Ru(II) sensitizers should be accessible via the convenient and versatile click-approach.

Device fabrication
Screen-printed layers of TiO2 particles were employed as photoelectrodes in this study. An 8 μm thick transparent film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass electrode and subsequently coated with a 5 μm thick second layer of 400 nm light-scattering anatase particles (CCIC, Japan). The porosity was determined from BET measurements to be 68% for the 20 nm TiO2 transparent layer and 42% for the 400 nm TiO2 scattering layer. The detailed methods for TiO2 film preparation, device fabrication, and the photocurrent-voltage measurements can be found in an earlier report.16 After sintering at 500 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the sintered TiO2 electrodes were sensitized by dipping 16 h into the dye solution (300 μM) in 10% DMSO and acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio 1:1) mixture, with 75 μM DINHOP (4:1) as a co-adsorbent. For the solid-state devices, a compact TiO2 layer was first deposited onto the FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis, onto which 23 nm sized TiO2 particles were deposited by doctor-blading to obtain a 2 μm thick mesoporous film. After sintering the TiO2 layers at 500 °C, the film was cooled to room temperature and immersed overnight in 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4. The film was then rinsed with deionized water, annealed in air at 450 °C for 20 min, and cooled to 80 °C before immersing it in the dye solution (300 μM) for sensitization. The hole transporting material solution containing 0.17 M spiro-MeOTAD, 0.11 mM tert-butylpyridine, and 0.21 mM LiN(CF3SO2)2 in chlorobenzene was used. We deposited this solution onto the dye-coated TiO2 film, leaving it to penetrate into the pores of the TiO2 layer for 1 min prior to spin-coating. Finally, a 50 nm-thick gold contact was deposited onto the organic semiconductor to close the cell.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
The photovoltage transient decay was recorded using an exciting pulse generated by a ring of red LEDs (Lumiled) controlled by a fast solid-state switch. The pulse widths were 100 ms. The pulse was incident on the photoanode side of the device. An array of InGaN diodes (Lumiled) supplied the white bias light incident from the same direction. Transients were measured at different white light intensities via tuning the voltage applied to the bias diodes. Before the LEDs switched to the next light intensity, a charge-extraction routine was executed to measure the electron density in the film. In the charge-extraction technique, the LED illumination source was turned off in <1 μs, while the cell was simultaneously switched from open to short circuit. The resulting current, as the cell returned to V = 0 and J = 0, was integrated to give a direct measurement of the excess charge in the film at that VOC.
