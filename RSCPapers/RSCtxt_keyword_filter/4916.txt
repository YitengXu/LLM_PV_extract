    , Accepted 26th November 2012First published on 28th November 2012AbstractThe fabrication of one-dimensional (1D) rods or wires of titania in desired crystalline facets is quite exciting due to unique optoelectronic properties. The single crystalline, oriented nanorods directly grown on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates are finding a lot of interest in solar photovoltaics and several other optoelectronic devices due to enhanced electron transport and lower exciton recombination rates. However, the growth of desired crystalline facets of highly oriented, single crystalline nanorods on different substrates and understanding the interplay between the surface chemistry and growth mechanism still remain a non-trivial and challenging task. Here, for the first time, the kinetically controlled growth of the (310) facet of TiO2 nanorods on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate has been reported which is in contrast to the previously reported (002) faceted TiO2 nanorods. In addition to this, the growth of (110) facet TiO2 nanorods using amorphous fluorine doped silicon oxide (FSO) as a substrate is also demonstrated. In this paper, it is shown that two different faceted TiO2 nanorods can be synthesized following same synthetic condition by varying only the material properties of the substrate. To investigate the role of substrate chemistry on the morphology and single crystallinity of TiO2 nanorods, electron microscopy, XPS and contact angle measurements have been done. The results clearly indicate an important link between the surface chemistry and morphology of TiO2 nanorods. It can be assumed that there is a role of OH− and water groups which are responsible for the growth of plane (110) which has less surface energy. The observation of (310) facet is quite surprising and can be explained based on FTO crystallinity. It is possible to tune the diameter of the titania nanorods by further coating the FTO substrate with a thin gold layer due to increase in the hydrophilicity of the substrate. Finally, a light to electricity conversion efficiency of 2.5% could be achieved by using vertically grown titania nanorods on FTO as the photoanode in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC).
Introduction
Despite the existence of rich literature on various synthesis methods, the customized growth of TiO2 nanostructures with control over size, shape and crystallinity still remains an open challenge due to complex nature of surface chemistry and difficulties in fine-tuning the nucleation and growth parameters. The growing interest in the need to explore the ways to achieve better control is further fuelled by the challenges posed from various applications in physics, chemistry, material science, biomedical science, environmental science and engineering etc. However, it remains non-trivial to fine-tune the synthesis parameters to suit these customized needs without the proper study on growth mechanism and its dependence on the substrate crystallinity. Even, the controlled imperfections in the semiconductor lattice, in the form of lattice defects and cation doping has brought a lot of interest for the people working in the dilute magnetic semiconductors and spintronics areas.1–3 The use of titania in the photoelectrochemical cell, photoelectrochemical dissociation of organic pollutants, photocatalytic water splitting, electrochromic devices, hydrogen storage, pigment, paint, sunscreen, plant and human pathogen management (due to its antimicrobial activities), etc. are now well established.4–12 It is also demonstrated that most of these properties are heavily dependent on the electronic structure of the material which can be tuned by the size and shape. For instance, it was found that titania nanorods show enhanced photocatalytic activity in comparison with Degussa P-25.13 Moreover, even within a single TiO2 nanoparticle, these properties often vary significantly for different crystalline facets due to varying amount of surface energy, thereby further posing challenges in front of chemists to develop the synthesis methods for the preferential growth of desired crystalline facets by using tailored kinetic control of the reaction.
Among different types of nanostructures, one-dimensional (1D) rods or wires of titania are extremely important due to their unique optoelectronic properties which arise due to their anisotropic shape. However, reaching the desired level of perfection (especially the growth of desired facet) remains still quite challenging and non-trivial. At present, several chemical methods are employed for preparing titania nanorods/wires. Among them, some well-known procedures include the direct oxidation of Ti substrate, electrochemical anodization of titanium, template assistant approaches, metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, hydrothermal method, sol–gel method etc.14–19 However, several of these methods are still filled with issues to be addressed in the coming years. The crystalline, oriented nanorods/nanowires are finding a lot of interest in the area of solar photovoltaics (PV) cells as not only the rate of electron transport through the oriented rods increase but also the rate of recombination of the excitons decreases. It is found that the polycrystalline titania nanotube arrays exhibit lower recombination of electrons and holes and therefore it is used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).20–22 However, if these 1D titania nanostructures are single crystalline, then they have added advantage of faster electron transport due to the absence of grain-boundaries and reduced electron trap sites.23–25 Growth of the oriented rods on the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates show faster charge transport rates and electron diffusion at the electrolyte–semiconductor interface.26,27
Among various wet-chemical methods explored in the literature for the growth of highly oriented, crystalline nanorods, the hydrothermal or solvothermal methods are most useful as they require relatively lower synthesis temperature which does not harm the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coating on glass substrate. The direct growth of single crystalline TiO2 nanorods on FTO coated glass by hydrothermal and solvothermal method was first reported a few years ago28,29 followed by a general method to synthesize TiO2 rods on various substrates.30,31 Despite the huge importance of this method in optoelectronic devices such as solar PV cells and in photocatalysis, the understanding on the growth mechanism of the nanorods, role of substrate (crystallinity, grain size, hydrophobicity etc.) and reaction parameters etc. remain poorly explored.
In this paper, to understand the role of substrate, we have studied in detail the growth mechanism of TiO2 nanorods on two different substrates (1) fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) in crystalline form and (2) fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass in amorphous form, due to the presence of very little amount of tin oxide the substrate was termed as fluorine doped silicon oxide or FSO for convenience. The results show strong influence of the crystallinity of the FTO layer on the crystallinity of the as-grown TiO2 nanorods. TiO2 nanorods can be fabricated in two different orientations by changing the substrate. Moreover, we also demonstrated the tunability of rod diameter by playing with the surface wettability of substrate by gold coating. Below, a detailed characterization of TiO2 nanorods using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis absorption, and photoluminescence techniques has been done. The possible mechanism behind the interesting growth of particular lattice planes has been discussed.
Materials and methods
(A) Synthesis of TiO2 nanorods on different substrates
To study the effect of substrate on the growth of TiO2 nanorods, the nanorods were synthesized on polycrystalline FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide, sheet resistance = 8 ohm/square; Solaronix) and amorphous FSO (fluorine doped silicon oxide, sheet resistance = 156 ohm/square) glass substrates respectively through solvothermal chemistry where titanium butoxide (purity ≥ 97%, Aldrich) was used as precursor. In a typical synthesis process, first the substrate was ultrasonically cleaned in a mixed solution of DI water, acetone and isopropanol and then dried in N2 flow. 30 mL H2O and 30 mL concentrated (35%) HCl was stirred for 10 min in a 100 mL Teflon vessel followed by the drop-wise addition of 1 mL titanium butoxide and stirring for another 10 min at room temperature. The substrates were placed horizontally within the Teflon vessel and the vessel was loaded inside a 100 mL autoclave for the hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C for 20 h in a furnace. After synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the substrates were washed vigorously with deionized water and then dried in air.
(B) Fabrication of DSSC
To fabricate a solar cell the as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate were annealed in air at 400 °C for 30 min. Then the as-synthesized TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate were cooled to 80 °C and were immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of N-719 dye (cisbis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyrridyl-4-4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium dye (as received from Solaronix) for 24 h in order to sufficiently adsorb the dye which will act as the sensitizer in the presence of light. After completing the adsorption of the dye the substrate was washed very carefully with ethanol and dried for 1 h. After that a platinum coated FTO substrate which will be used as the counter electrode was placed above the dye adsorbed FTO substrate and an electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-hexyl-2-3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in methoxyacetonitrile was injected into the space between the anode and the cathode to complete the assembly of the DSSC.
(C) Characterization techniques
In order to confirm the crystalline phase of TiO2 nanorods, powder X-ray diffraction study was performed using a PANalytical X′PERT PRO instrument and the iron-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step size of 0.02°. XPS data was collected by using a VG Microtch, model ESCA 3000 equipped with ion gun (EX-05) for cleaning the surface. The binding energy resolution was 0.1 eV. To investigate the role of substrate chemistry on the morphology and single crystallinity of TiO2 nanorods as synthesized nanorods were characterized by environmental scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 environmental scanning microscope) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (FEI (model Tecnai F30)) equipped with a field emission source operating at 300 kV voltage to image TiO2 nanocrystals on carbon-coated copper TEM grid. Optical properties of the as synthesized TiO2 nanorods were investigated by UV-visible spectrophotometer. UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Jasco UV-Vis-NIR (Model V570) dual beam spectrometer operated at a resolution of 2 nm. PL and PLE spectra were acquired using a Jobin YvoFluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer, equipped with a 400 W Xe lamp as an excitation source and a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier (PMT) tube as a detector. STM measurements were carried out at room temperature and ambient pressure using a Veeco Multimode scanning probe microscope with NanoScope IV controller. STM tips were prepared from Pt:Ir (8:2) wire by the mechanical cutting method and used without any further treatment. STM images were taken with a bias voltage of 40 mV and 30 nA current and feedback was set to log. The system bias voltage was applied to the sample and tip was kept at ground. The scan rate was 1 Hz. Current–voltage characteristics were calculated by irradiating the cell with 100 mW cm−2 (450 W xenon lamp, Oriel instrument), 1 sun AM 1.5 G filter was used to simulate the solar spectrum. The active area of the cell was 0.5 cm2. The photocurrent was measured by using a Keithley 2400 source.
Results and discussion
In Fig. 1(A), the XRD pattern of TiO2 nanorods grown directly on FTO coated glass substrate, FTO substrate without TiO2 nanorods and PDF file #21-1276 of rutile TiO2 have been compared. The X-ray diffraction study confirmed that TiO2 nanorods grown on different substrates are in rutile phase. The zoom view of the XRD pattern is shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). It is clear from the diffraction peaks that the nanorods are highly oriented with respect to the substrate along the (310) plane. If the intensity of the (310) peak is compared with the standard TiO2 data (PDF data file #21-1276), it is found that the relative intensity of (310) peak is increased ∼10 times from ∼10% to 100%. It is remarkable that earlier, following the same solvothermal synthesis procedure, it was found by various researchers that the intensity of the (002) peak of the rutile TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO substrate was dominant and so the nanorods were grown in the [001] direction.28,29 It is also noticeable that the growth of the (310) facets is never reported earlier and to the best of our knowledge it is the first time that the dominant growth of this facet is reported here.28–31 In Fig. 1(B), the XRD pattern of TiO2 nanorods grown on FSO glass substrate, FSO glass substrate without TiO2 nanorods and PDF file #21-1276 have been compared to explore the role of substrate. It is clear from the XRD data that, when FSO substrate was used for the growth of TiO2 nanorods then the intensity of (110) diffraction peak was enhanced instead of (310). These two results indicate that it is possible to get the growth of the desired crystalline planes of TiO2 nanorods by using various substrates.

Earlier reports specify that when the nanorods were synthesized on plain glass or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, the rods were polycrystalline in nature.30 Moreover, in those cases, the as-grown TiO2 rods were randomly oriented with respect to the substrate.30 It is known that during the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles, the “oriented attachment growth mechanism” is followed.32 In the case of oriented attachment, the adjacent particles are self-attached instantly to share a common crystallographic orientation. After that these particles are connected at a planar interface. This mechanism is also applicable for the particles which nucleate on a substrate and coalesce during growth.32 As usual, in order to reduce the surface energy by eliminating high energy facets, attachment always take place at the high energy surfaces. During the growth of TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate, SnO2 can effectively act as a nucleation layer.31 As both the rutile titania and stannic oxide have tetragonal structure where the surface energy of (310) plane is much higher than (110) plane, growth of titania crystal occurs instantly along the (310) direction to minimize the surface energy. In the case of FSO, it was found from the EDX analysis that the atomic percentage of Sn is only 0.45. Moreover, the XRD pattern showed that FSO substrate is amorphous in nature. Therefore, it can be assumed that in contrast to the FTO substrate, similar nucleation sites are not present on the FSO coated glass substrate and so the probability of the growth of (310) plane is reduced. In acidic solution, the nucleation and growth of rutile TiO2 is thermodynamically and kinetically controlled by the enhanced corner shared bonding of [TiO(OH2)5]2+ nuclei. The surface energy of the (110) plane of the rutile TiO2 is the lowest compared to other planes. Moreover, the presence of a large number of five-fold co-ordinated Ti4+ atoms, two-fold co-ordinated O2− atoms and oxygen vacancies favours the selective adsorption of anions on (110) surface and thus a ‘screening layer’ is formed on the surface which restricts further oxolation of [TiO(OH2)5]2+ complex on (110) surface. On the contrary, the two cusps of rod consist of other higher energy surface can adsorb more [TiO(OH2)5]2+ complex to decrease the surface energy. Thus the nanorods grow anisotropically along the (110) surface on FSO coated substrates.33
To further explain this growth pattern, the XPS spectra of oxygen for the growth of TiO2 nanorods on FTO and FSO glass substrates have been shown in Fig. (2). Shirley algorithm was used for background correction and chemically distinct species were resolved using a nonlinear least-square fitting procedure. The core level binding energy was aligned with the carbon binding energy of 285 eV. The fitting of O 1s peak in Fig. 2 indicated three components characteristic of TiO2, Ti–OH and Ti–OH2, successively with increasing binding energies at 530, 532, 533 eV respectively. As XPS is a surface sensitive technique, any change in the surface such as reduced coordination number or surface disorder will change the spectra. It has been suggested that the surface hydroxide ions contribute to the 1D growth of single crystalline TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate. In Fig. 2(B) the maximum intense peak of O 1s spectra for TiO2 nanorods grown on FSO substrate shifts towards higher binding energy side from 530 eV to ∼532 eV which confirms that on the surface of TiO2 nanorods the maximum oxygen which is present comes from OH and OH2 groups. The results confirm that other planes of TiO2 can adsorb larger amounts of [TiO(OH2)5]2+ than (110) plane thereby blocking the growth of planes other than (110) and thus the nanorods grow anisotropically along the (110) surface. In Fig. 2(A), the maximum intense peak in O 1s core level spectra for TiO2 nanorods growth on FTO comes around 530 eV which corresponds to the oxygen which comes from TiO2 species and the peak at higher binding side corresponds to the hydroxyl groups adsorbed at the surface of TiO2 nanorods formed at the surface due to broken and dangling bonds from the oxygen that have to be terminated. In addition, a small amount of bound surface water is often detected, even in ultrahigh vacuum conditions.

Next, the mechanism behind the preferential growth of (310) facet of TiO2 nanorods on FTO coated glass substrate was tried to be elucidated properly. In this case, the surface energy of (310) plane is much higher than (110) plane. According to Donnay–Harker rules, the surface free energy of the {001} faces is about 1.4 times than {110} faces. Surfaces with higher energy usually diminish very fast during the time of crystal growth.34,35 In the case of FTO, it was found that SnO2 layer of the FTO substrate efficiently provides nucleation sites during the growth of TiO2 nanorods.31 The thermodynamically stable crystal structure of Sn(IV) dioxide or stannic oxide is rutile. In the rutile phase of stannic oxide the surface energy of (310) plane is much higher than (110) plane which results in the growth of (310) plane on the FTO substrate.
From the comparative study of O 1s core level XPS spectra, it can be assumed that there is a role of OH− and water groups which are responsible for the growth of less energetic plane (110). Earlier, people have reported the growth of TiO2 nanorods along (002) plane on the FTO substrate through solvothermal methods.28,29 The anisotropic growth of the nanorods along (002) plane can be explained by the shape controlled chemistry where Cl− ions are selectively adsorbed onto the (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2, suppressing further growth of that plane resulting in the formation of nanorods.28 The very small lattice mismatch of rutile TiO2 and FTO substrate is the driving force for the epitaxial growth of TiO2 nanorods on FTO substrate.29

Fig. 3 represents the SEM images of the nanorods grown on FTO and FSO substrates. From the images it is confirmed that the nanorods are densely packed and perfectly oriented with respect to FTO. But when FSO is used as a substrate then the nanorods are not densely packed and also the orientation of the rods is not vertical with respect to the substrate. It is clear from the figure that the top facets of the rods are square shaped which also supports the expected growth habit of tetragonal crystal. The length and diameter of the rods are around 4.5 μm and 200 nm respectively. Further, from EDX analysis the chemical stoichiometry of the TiO2 nanorods was calculated and it was found that the atomic ratio of Ti to O is nearly 1:2.

Fig. 4 shows the TEM and HRTEM image of individual TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO and FSO substrate. In Fig. 4(B) and 4(E) lattice fringes with interplanar spacing d101 = 0.24 nm for FTO and d110 = 0.32 nm for FSO corresponding to the rutile phase of TiO2 can be identified clearly. The FFT pattern also confirms the single crystallinity of the nanorods. Sharp selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) for the TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO substrate (Fig. 4(c)) was visualized nicely along [001] zone axis which was the inveterate evidence of the single crystallinity of the nanorods.

Fig. 5(A) shows the UV-visible absorption measurements of the TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO and FSO substrate. It is clear from the absorption spectra that the TiO2 nanorods are transparent in the visible region which is characteristic of TiO2. The absorption edge is at 420 nm for both type of TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO and FSO substrate. Assuming that the rutile TiO2 nanorods possess a direct transition the band edge energy of the as-synthesized nanorods are calculated by plotting (αhν)2 against hν (where α is absorption coefficient and hν is photon energy).36 From the intercepts (shown in the insets of Fig. 5A) the bandgap energy of the TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO and FSO is found to be 2.9 eV and 3 eV respectively.

Fig. 5(B) shows the photoluminescence property of the TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO and FSO. The spectrum show an emission peak at 445 nm when it is excited at 410 nm. Corresponding PLE spectra exhibit absorption at 410 nm. It is reported that the luminescence behavior of the single crystal rutile nanorods is due to the emission of free exciton. Rutile TiO2 nanorods emit free excitons as the coordination number (two edges and eight corners) is the largest of all.37 Moreover the emission of free exciton also takes place if the crystal is sufficiently pure or in a way if it is a defect free crystal. The very weak green band emission can be ignored which implies a very low concentration of oxygen defects.
To further explore the relation between surface chemistry of substrates and oriented growth and morphology of TiO2 nanorods the wettability of the substrate was modified by sputter-coating the FTO substrate with a gold layer of 10 nm and this Au coated FTO substrate was used to grow TiO2 nanorods following the same method as mentioned above while keeping all other parameters same. The SEM images of an FTO substrate and 10 nm Au coated FTO substrate are shown in the ESI (Fig. S2†). From the SEM images it was quite difficult to conclude about the morphology and wettability of gold on FTO surface. So to further probe the Au-coating on FTO substrates, we performed STM measurements at room temperature and ambient pressure. The height image comparison for both the uncoated and 10 nm gold coated substrates respectively along with the line scan analysis are shown in the ESI (Fig. S3 and S4†). It appeared from ‘height-profile STM’ images (Fig. S3 and S4†) that there is a visible reduction in surface roughness however we do not expect a significant change in the FTO roughness from the 10 nm Au film.

Fig. 6, shows the XRD images of the as synthesized TiO2 nanorods. From the XRD data, it is found that here too the (310) peak is the most intense peak with intensity much higher than usual reported value. The intensity of the peak is increased almost 10 times from 10% to 100%. Fig. 7 shows the morphology of TiO2 nanorods by SEM images which reveal that, the TiO2 nanorods grown on Au coated FTO substrate are relatively densely packed and they are highly oriented with respect to the substrate. In addition, it is observed that the diameter of the as synthesized rods are quite bigger (∼400 nm) in comparison to the rods grown on FTO coated substrate (∼200 nm). To investigate the probable reason behind this, wettability test was performed following the measurement of contact angles (Fig. 8) of FTO coated glass and 10 nm gold coated FTO glass. It was found that the water contact angle of the gold coated FTO glass is 12° whereas for FTO substrate it is 36° which hints the increase in the hydrophilicity of the FTO substrate after coating it with gold might be one of the main reasons for the larger diameter of the titania nanorods. The UV-visible absorption spectra of as grown TiO2 nanorods on gold coated FTO glass substrate was also measured (Fig. 9). The absorption edge was around 420 nm. The bandgap of the nanorods was 3 eV (the insets of Fig. 9) which correspond to rutile TiO2.

The as-synthesized single crystalline TiO2 nanorod arrays which are also directly grown on conducting FTO covered glass substrate have huge applications for sensitized solar cells. These single crystalline oriented nanorods grown on FTO substrate can effectively act as the photoanode in sensitized solar cells. Due to the single crystalline structures of these nanorods, rapid and efficient transfer of electrons takes place from the sensitizer to the collecting conducting substrate. Moreover, as the nanorods are directly synthesized on the transparent substrate, more incident light can be passed through the backside of the photoelectrode and hence able to generate more photoelectrons. Fig. 10 shows the J–V characteristic of the assembled solar cell under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The cell produced short-circuit current density of 8.01 mA cm−2 and an open circuit potential of 0.66 V respectively. The fill factor and over all light to electricity conversion efficiency of the as mentioned solar cell was 0.47 and 2.5% respectively. The efficiency of the cells can be improved further by treating the cells with either TiCl4 or NbCl5. The value of the power conversion efficiency of the as-prepared TiO2 nanorod array based DSSC without any treatment compares well with the earlier reported efficiency value.28–31

Conclusion
In summary, this paper deals with the growth mechanism and dependence of morphology of titania nanorods on the surface chemistry of substrate. TiO2 nanorods have been synthesized on different types of substrate and found that TiO2 nanorods can be grown on different planes if the material property of the substrate can be changed from crystalline to amorphous. The reason for the growth of nanorods in different planes and the variation of diameter of the rods are understood nicely through various experiments such as XPS and contact angle measurement. The kinetically controlled growth of (310) facet of TiO2 nanorods on FTO coated glass substrate has been synthesized which is in contrast to the previously reported (002) faceted TiO2 nanorods. Further, the growth of (110) facet TiO2 nanorods using amorphous fluorine doped silicon oxide (FSO) as a substrate was also demonstrated. It is also possible to tune the diameter of the nanorods by playing with the surface chemistry of the substrate which can further be used for tuning the morphology of various 1D structures. Finally a power conversion efficiency of 2.5% was achieved from the prepared DSSC assembled with TiO2 nanorods grown on FTO substrate. It was understood that light to electricity conversion efficiency can be improved further by fine tuning the length and diameter of the as-grown TiO2 nanorod arrays. Thus, the proposed method can be used for the synthesis of various shapes and faceted controlled 1D nanostructures.
