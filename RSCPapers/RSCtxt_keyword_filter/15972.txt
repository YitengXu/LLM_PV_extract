    , Accepted 24th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractColloidal quantum dots (CQDs) exhibit extraordinary features due to their bandgap tunability and solution processing. Instead of the ZnO layer usually used as the electron transport layer (ETL) in CQD heterojunction devices, we developed, for the first time, tin dioxide (SnO2) as the ETL in colloidal quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs). Its wider bandgap and higher electron mobility, as well as appropriate band alignment with PbS QDs, could favor light absorption and photocarrier extraction. Our low-temperature processed SnO2 film could retain chlorine atoms (SnO2–Cl) to achieve interface passivation in QDSCs. Utilizing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) as the absorber ligand, our superior device obtained a power conversion efficiency of 9.37%, which was 44% higher than that of a control device. Physical characterizations revealed that this remarkable improvement could be ascribed to the chlorine passivation of the SnO2/QD interface contact and to the EMII ligand passivation effect on the QD surface. Our newly developed ETL, along with an efficient interface passivation technique, is expected to enhance the performance of full solution-processed colloidal QDSCs.
Introduction
Lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have gained considerable attention in the innovative technology of optoelectronics such as solar cells,1,2 light-emitting diodes,3,4 photodetectors5,6 and lasers,7 due to their size-tunable characteristics, simple synthetic route,8–11 solution processing and efficient multiple exciton generation.9,12 Their broad absorption (up to 2 μm) properties boost the potential to harvest low-energy photons, which is difficult for dye-sensitized and organic solar cells.13 Their band gap (Eg) could be optimally tuned to ∼1.3 eV for harvesting visible-near infrared radiations.13 Also, PbS quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have been involved in ligand passivation in recent years.14–16
In planar PbS QDSCs, metal oxides such as ZnO and TiO2 have commonly been utilized as the electron transport layer (ETL) in colloidal QDSCs, due to their high dielectric constant (ε = 7) for exciton dissociation17–19 and suitable energy levels. Moreover, the wider bandgap of ETLs is expected to transmit more high-energy photons for photocurrent generation.20 In this regard, doped ETL material such as Mg–ZnO has been explored to enlarge the bandgap.21 In addition, most synthesized ZnO layers using the sol–gel method have led to carbon residuals with deteriorated carrier transport.22 Based on the limitations mentioned above, tin dioxide (SnO2) has emerged as a new ETL because of its unique properties, such as wider band gap (∼3.6 eV), high mobility, good anti-reflection nature, good low-temperature processing,20,23 and compatibility with CQD device fabrication techniques. These novel properties promise superior performances in perovskite solar cells.20,24 In addition, theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that interfacial incorporation of chlorine atoms could greatly suppress the oxygenic defect which is commonly introduced in halide ligands in QDs.17,25 Utilizing this chlorine-based contact passivation technique, Tan et al. obtained efficient and stable TiO2–Cl/perovskite solar cells.26 Therefore, in the present work, we first combined the novelties of tin dioxide with chlorine (SnO2–Cl) for efficient PbS QDSCs.
In addition to interface passivation, bulk defect passivation of PbS QD absorbers also played a key part in the efficiency of energy conversion. Various organic and inorganic ligands were investigated to alleviate geminate recombination originating from midgap trap states in QDs band structures.27,28 Halide ligands, especially 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII), strongly favor halide binding and excellent removal of hydroxide moieties during ligand exchange in PbS QDs.29
Herein, we introduce SnO2–Cl ETL in PbS QDSCs with a device structure of FTO/SnO2–Cl/PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT (dithioglycol)/Au (PbS-EMII, PbS QDs are passivated by EMII ligands). Jsc and Voc for the newly developed device were improved with SnO2–Cl ETL. Systematic physical characterization showed that the improvement mechanism was attributed to retention of the Cl atom for interfacial passivation. In addition, compared with traditional TBAI ligands, EMII ligand exchange could further remove the deep defect state of hydroxyl ions to obtain a higher FF. By integrating the unique features of SnO2–Cl with PbS-EMII QDs, the superior device reached 9.37%, with a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 25.63 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.64. The present work demonstrated that SnO2–Cl ETL has good potential for low-cost, large-area and highly efficient colloidal QDSCs.
Results and discussion
The transmittance of SnO2–Cl and ZnO samples is shown in Fig. 1a. The cutoff absorption of SnO2 was much shorter than that of the ZnO layer.20,30 The inset of Fig. 1a shows their (αhν)2–hν curves; the extracted optical bandgap of SnO2 was about 3.58 eV, much wider than that of the ZnO layer (3.3 eV). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) topography revealed the SnO2–Cl film to have high-quality nanocrystalline without pinholes, in contrast to the rough ZnO film (Fig. S1†). The smooth and compact surface could facilitate ETL transparency as well as device FF.31 Using the Hall effect and space charge-limited current (SCLC) techniques, the SnO2–Cl layer could obtain higher mobility (∼2.51 cm2 V−1 s−1) and lower trapping density (∼4.3 × 1014 cm−3), as shown in Fig. 1b, whereas the corresponding values of ZnO film achieved 3.64 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.34 × 1016 cm−3 (Fig. S2†), respectively.

The obtained ETLs were utilized to fabricate solar cells and the device architecture is schematically described in Fig. 1c. Also, Fig. 1d is its SEM cross-section image. The chemical compositions and energy level of SnO2–Cl films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. From the full XPS spectrum, Sn and O signals could be easily observed (Fig. S3a†), and more details are discussed below. From UPS measurements (Fig. 2a), the Fermi level and valence band maximum (VBM) of SnO2–Cl and ZnO were 4.42 and 4.12 eV, and 7.76 and 7.47 eV, respectively. Combining the optical bandgaps of the SnO2–Cl and ZnO layers, the conduction band minimum (CBM) values were inferred to be 4.18 and 4.11 eV, respectively. The energy level diagram (Fig. 2b) demonstrated the CBM of SnO2–Cl to be deeper than ZnO and well aligned with the CBM of QDs for efficient carrier transfer. In the case of the deeper VBM of SnO2, holes could also be efficiently blocked to flow back, which definitely improved the current density of photovoltaic devices. As shown in Fig. 2c, the photoluminescence (PL) intensities of glass/SnO2–Cl/PbS QDs and glass/ZnO/PbS QDs films were significantly quenched compared with the intensity of the glass/QDs control sample. The lower PL intensity manifested the superior carrier transfer property of the SnO2–Cl layer. Subsequently, there are two possible options for these separated carriers: recombining via surface trap states or contributing to device power. For clarity, the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique was adopted to measure ZnO– and SnO2–Cl-based QDSCs devices (Fig. S4a†). The prolonged lifetime of photocarriers depicted the shrinking magnitude of trapping states in SnO2–Cl QDSCs.24 Eventually, combination analysis from PL and TPV demonstrated a stronger coupling capability between SnO2–Cl and QDs films for efficient photocarrier conversion.

PbS QDSCs based on a typical device structure (FTO/metal oxide/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au) were fabricated to investigate their performances. Light and dark current density–voltage (J–V) curves of SnO2–Cl– and ZnO-based devices are shown in Fig. 3a and S4b.† The SnO2–Cl QDSCs obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.92%, a Jsc of 23.79 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.57 V and a FF of 0.58. Compared with ZnO ETL devices, all SnO2–Cl QDSC parameters achieved higher values. The photovoltaic parameters of the two ETLs-based devices mentioned above are summarized in Table 1. The higher FF of SnO2–Cl-based devices may be attributed to the higher mobility and smooth morphology of SnO2 films.32 Also, Jsc improvement could be clearly analyzed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 3b). The EQE difference in short wavelength (<400 nm) was attributed to the wider band gap of SnO2 ETL. Also, longer wavelength (500–900 nm) improvement could be explained.33

To gain insight into the physical origins of the improved Voc and Jsc, we characterized the built-in field and depletion width (WD) by employing capacitance–voltage (C–V) analysis. Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 3c) enabled the built-in voltage (Vbi) to be extracted from the intercept of the 1/C2 curve on the horizontal axis.34 The dopant concentration (NA) of the PbS QDs layer was about 4.17 × 1016 cm−3, according to extraction from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot. Vbi of the SnO2–Cl-based devices was ∼170 mV higher than that of the ZnO-based devices responsible for Voc improvement. The calculated WD as a function of applied voltage is shown in Fig. 3d. The WD of the SnO2–Cl-based device was calculated to be ∼188 nm at zero bias voltage, whereas it was just 117 nm for ZnO-based devices. The wider depletion width could help to more efficiently collect carriers, especially for long-wavelength light, which might be the reason why SnO2–Cl-based devices resulted in higher Jsc, and especially higher EQE in the 500–900 nm range (Fig. 3b).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool for understanding device interface information.35,36Fig. 4a and b show the impedance spectra of ZnO– and SnO2–Cl-based devices under one-sun illumination, and the inset of Fig. 4a shows its equivalent circuit. In the EIS complex plane, the x-axis intersections of impedance at high and low frequency could obtain the series resistance (Rs) and recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. The lower Rs value of SnO2–Cl-based devices (Fig. S6a†) manifested its superior charge transport capability. Fig. 4c and d plot the lifetime (τ) and Rrec extracted by EIS data for SnO2–Cl– and ZnO-based devices. The longer lifetime (Fig. 4c) and larger recombination resistance (Fig. 4d) further confirmed the efficient interface passivation by SnO2–Cl ETL compared with those of ZnO. To investigate the efficiency distribution, 30 cells of ZnO/QDs and SnO2–Cl/QDs devices were measured and their histograms are plotted in Fig. S6b.† Utilizing the same device structure with different ETLs, SnO2–Cl-based devices could obtain much higher conversion efficiency.

Compared with the reported efficiencies of PbS QDSCs, the main deficit of SnO2–Cl/QD-TBAI devices came from the low FF which may be induced from the band tails during the TBAI solid ligand exchange process.28,29 A recent report demonstrated that EMII salt may facilitate stronger halide binding and more efficient passivation on QDs surfaces compared with TBAI ligands.29Fig. 5a shows the molecular structure diagram for the two ligands: EMII has fewer steric structures and smaller molecule size. Thus, the EMII ligand was expected to more efficiently passivate the QD surface so as to shrink the band tails. To confirm the passivation effect, we collected the PCEs of two batch devices using TBAI and EMII as ligands (60 devices). The device performance distribution is summarized in Fig. 5b, which indicated better reproducibility and higher average efficiency (∼8.8%) based on SnO2–Cl/PbS-EMII devices. The optimized J–V curves based on EMII and TBAI ligand devices are demonstrated in Fig. 5c. The superior SnO2–Cl/PbS-EMII device could yield a PCE of 9.37% with an improved Jsc of 25.63 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.64. The corresponding EQE is shown in Fig. 5d. EQE values of SnO2–Cl/PbS-EMII devices approached 90% at 450–630 nm spectra, whereas the values for the reference only reached 70%. The improvement was probably ascribed to more thorough bulk passivation of QDs by EMII ligands.

From the demonstration above, the improved performances of PbS QDSCs were highly reliant on the optimized SnO2–Cl ETLs. Thus, SnO2 film was characterized in detail to probe its origins. First, the ETL thin-film products from different annealing temperatures were measured by XPS to investigate the chemical component effect. The Sn 3d and O 1s characteristic peaks of the product film are shown in Fig. 6a–d and Fig. S3,† respectively. The Sn 3d spectrum can be fitted well by two oxidation states (Sn2+ and Sn4+). For annealing treatment at 100 °C, it was composed of SnO and SnO2. The molar ratio of SnO/SnO2 was about 0.6:1, which illustrated that the product was non-stoichiometric and contained heterogeneous components. The 100 °C-annealed ETL films showed low conductivity with an amorphous state (data not shown) which may lead to deteriorated device performance (Fig. 6e). When the annealing temperature reached 200 °C, there were obvious shifts for Sn 3d and O 1s peaks (Fig. 6a, b, S3b and c†). The film composition was evolved into SnO2 and the ratio of SnO/SnO2 was 0.05:1. When the annealing temperature was increased further to 400 °C, the composition changed slightly (Fig. 6c and S3d†) with a SnO/SnO2 ratio of ∼0.04:1. Simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 6d, the chlorine component gradually decreased in the tin-oxide product with increasing treatment temperature. When it reached 400 °C, the chlorine content was almost removed. To explore the effect of SnO2 composition on device performance, we fabricated QDSCs devices based on different annealing temperatures for tin-oxide ETLs. In Fig. 6e and Table S1,† the 100 °C-annealed ETL devices had low performance (PCE <2%). However, the 200 °C-annealed ETL (SnO2–Cl) device achieved the best efficiency (PCE >9%) and the 400 °C-annealed SnO2 devices reached a PCE of just ∼3%. Such distinct performances confirmed that the low temperature (200 °C)-processed films with Cl incorporation obtained higher PCE than Cl-free devices (400 °C treatment). To further confirm the key role of chlorine, a control experiment utilizing a non-chlorine tin precursor (SnSO4, tin sulfate) instead of SnCl2 was carried out and the annealing temperature was kept at 200 °C. The power conversion efficiency was only ∼5% (data not shown), much lower than our innovative devices. Halide ions and halide molecule ligands have been traditionally used in PbX (X = S, Se) QDs to suppress oxidation and passivate surface trap states.25,37 Thus, we reasoned that interfacial Cl capping in SnO2 films could passivate the interface trap states. The dark J–V curves (Fig. 6f) revealed the poorest rectification in 100 °C-annealed devices, whereas the reverse saturation current of 200 °C-annealed devices was highly suppressed. To gain further insight into the passivation results from SnO2–Cl, we characterized the charge-transfer kinetics and charge recombination in SnO2– and SnO2–Cl-based devices. The charge transport and recombination times (τt and τr) were extracted from transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay, respectively. The transport lifetime of Cl-free SnO2 devices (τt = 2.7 μs) was slightly faster than that for SnO2–Cl devices (τt = 3.8 μs) (Fig. 7a). This similarity indicated that charge transfer was not the main reason for performance enhancement. However, the charge-recombination lifetime of SnO2–Cl-based devices (τr = 140 μs) was obviously longer than that of Cl-free SnO2 devices (τr = 60 μs) (Fig. 7b), a result that agreed well with the alleviated charge recombination at the SnO2–Cl/QDs interface. Similar results were also reported in recent pioneering work on chlorine contact passivation in TiO2/perovskite high-efficiency solar cells.26 From these results, we confirmed the interfacial Cl capping effect for SnO2 films, which could suppress the trap states and reduce interfacial recombination.

Therefore, we conclude that our SnO2–Cl ETL by a simple sol–gel method can achieve high-quality contact passivation and efficient carrier extraction. The newly developed efficient ETL combined with EMII ligand passivation holds great potential for high-performance and flexible QDSCs.
Conclusion
We developed SnO2–Cl ETL in PbS QDSCs with a device structure of FTO/SnO2–Cl/PbS-EMII/PbS-EDT/Au. Compared with typical FTO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au devices, Voc, Jsc and FF values were all improved for the newly developed devices. Systematic physical characterization revealed that the improvement was mainly attributed to a SnO2–Cl ETL and EMII ligand passivation effect. In addition to the aligned energy levels and superior optoelectronic properties of SnO2–Cl ETL, the incorporation of chlorine played a key part in heterojunction passivation. Also, the EMII ligand could further suppress the introduction of deep defects so as to obtain a higher FF. By combining SnO2–Cl ETL with PbS-EMII QDs, the champion device reached 9.37% efficiency with a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 25.63 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.64. The newly developed SnO2–Cl ETL demonstrated superior coupling capability with PbS QDs. In cooperation with new, efficient ligands, the development of PbS QDSCs holds great potential.
