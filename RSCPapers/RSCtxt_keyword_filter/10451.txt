    , Accepted 5th December 2018First published on 19th December 2018AbstractA screening of the reactions between BiI3 and iodide salts of different N-alkylated heterocycles (pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline) resulted in the preparation and structural characterization of six novel iodobismuthate complexes, including two compounds exhibiting an unprecedented {[Bi3I10]} polymeric moiety. It has been shown that the chemical composition and structure of the iodobismuthates significantly affect their optical and electronic properties. In particular, the narrowest band gaps (Eg) were revealed by {[Bi3I10]} iodobismuthates, while the compounds incorporating {[BiI4]} polymeric frameworks showed 0.2–0.3 eV wider Eg. GIXRD analysis evidenced that all three iodobismuthates investigated in thin films show mainly the horizontal (parallel to the substrate) orientation of the 1D polymeric Bi–I frameworks. Such arrangement blocks the charge transport in vertical direction (orthogonal to the substrate) since the conductive Bi–I chains are separated with insulating bulky organic cations. As a consequence, standard planar junction solar cells based on new iodobismuthates revealed low power conversion efficiencies approaching 0.12% only. However, strong in-plane photoconductivity observed for iodobismuthates enabled the fabrication of efficient planar photodetectors, which paves a way to the practical use of this exotic family of materials. Most importantly, the presented systematic study revealed the most general guidelines for future rational design of perovskite-like materials for emerging generation of environment-friendly perovskite photovoltaics emphasizing the importance of the isotropic charge transport in the films of 3D materials and achieving proper orientation of 1D and 2D frameworks with respect to the charge collecting electrodes in anisotropic low dimensional systems.
Introduction
Within the last few years, photovoltaic devices based on the main group halides has emerged as one of the “hot topics” of modern chemistry and materials science.1–9 The lion's share of research in this field was concentrated on the use of iodoplumbates, in particular, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI), since solar cells based on this material have demonstrated the best certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 22%.10–16 However, despite the attractive performance, this technology has not been commercialized yet due to several fundamental obstacles. The major challenge is a low stability of both PbI2 and iodoplubmates towards the light irradiation, dramatically limiting the lifetime of solar cells based on these materials.17–19 Despite the great efforts of researchers working in this field, the photodegradation problem has not been solved yet, encouraging the exploration of other, potentially more stable and less toxic halometalates as light absorbers.
The studies of complex Sn(II) and Ge(II) halide-based materials revealed that the ASnX3 and AGeX3 systems (A = organic cation and X = Br, I) can demonstrate PCE up to 6.4%, but their stability is even lower than for iodoplumbates due to the disproportionation of M(II) into M(0) and M(IV).20–22 Expanding the range of main group elements, some of the most recent efforts are focused on the iodide complexes of antimony and bismuth.23–25 Notably the structural chemistry of both these elements differs from Pb(II) mainly because of generally lower tendency to form polymeric complexes, especially those of higher dimensionality.26 Nevertheless, there are some attempts to apply the same paradigm based on using methylammonium as templating organic cation, which results in the formation of binuclear A3[M2I9] complexes delivering poor PCEs of 0.1–1.6% in solar cells.27–29 Improved PCE of up to 3.17% were reported for this system recently.30 Similar results were reported for the corresponding caesium salts Cs3[M2I9], which provided solar cell efficiencies of up to 1.1%.29,31 Impressive efficiencies of 2.1–2.2% were obtained for one of the polymorphs of AgBi2I732 and Ag2BiI5.33 Compounds of the structural type ABiI4 showed PCEs of up to 0.9%.34,35 Considerable progress has been achieved also for double perovskites such as Cs2AgBiBr6 delivering solar cell efficiencies of up to 2.2–2.5%.36,37
Interestingly, although it is well-known that both iodoantimonates and iodobismuthates demonstrate a great diversity of structural types, including discrete anionic complexes of various nuclearity (up to 8 for Bi)38 and various coordination polymers,28,39–44 the range of compounds of this family assessed with respect to their photovoltaic performance is extremely limited. Besides the aforementioned complexes, a 1,6-hexanediammonium salt of one-dimensional {[BiI5]2−} anion has been evaluated in solar cells and yielded PCE < 0.1%.45 Although the achieved solar cell performances are not very inspiring, it is clear that any general conclusions on the applicability of iodobismuthates cannot be drawn until extended studies are performed involving particularly compounds of greater dimensionality: 1D, 2D and, ideally, quasi-3D structures resembling iodoplumbates with their real perovskite lattice.46
In the present work, we report a series of novel iodobismuthate complexes with N-heterocyclic templating cations: (N-MePy){[Bi3I10]} (1), (N-MePy)3[Bi2I9]·CH3CN (2), (N-EtPy){[Bi3I10]} (3), (N-EtPy)3[Bi2I9]·CH3CN (4), (N-methylquinolinium){[BiI4]} (5) and (N-methylisoquinolinium){[BiI4]} (6), their structural and optical properties as well as preliminary results of their investigation as photoactive materials for solar cells and photodetectors.
Results and discussion
To date, several hundreds of polynuclear halobismuthate (PHB) complexes belonging to different structural types (over 30) have been reported.26,47 It was noted47 that the nature of counter cation plays a key role in the formation of PHB of certain geometry. Generally, such syntheses cannot be reliably controlled by varying the initial ratio of reagents. This trend is especially clear when considering the compounds prepared in the presence of excess of halide ion, i.e., using acidic hydrogen halide solutions as a reaction medium. Nevertheless, in some cases stoichiometry still has some effect on the composition of the products. In particular, reported here compounds 1 and 3 were prepared in the reactions of BiI3 and iodide salts of corresponding cations taken in 3:1 molar ratio. According to the powder XRD and elemental analysis data, both these reactions yielded pure crystalline phases.
A challenging feature of PHBs, as well as some other halometalates, is the inapplicability or irrelevance of the most common instrumental methods used for the characterization of novel compounds and the confirmation of their purity. A combination of powder XRD and chemical (elemental) analysis represents probably the best option for this purpose. We performed a screening of the “BiI3 + Cation-I” reactions (cation = N-MePy+, N-EtPy+) at different reagent ratios while monitoring the chemical composition of the formed solids with the aim to isolate all new phases formed in the system and determine their structures by single crystal XRD. The results obtained using N-MePy+ as templating cation are summarized in Table 1. One can see that two distinctly different PHBs were obtained just by varying the stoichiometric ratio between BiI3 and organic iodide. Very similar behaviour was observed also for the system with N-EtPy+ cation.

Based on these data, we can conclude that the reagent stoichiometry does have a strong influence on the composition of the products but not necessarily on the composition of individual phases. Therefore, such a screening procedure involving variation of the reagent ratios can be generally recommended when working with PHBs.
While performing this study, we have succeeded in isolation and structural characterization of two new iodobismuthates: 1 with N-methylpyridinium and 3 with N-ethylpyridinium cations. It should be emphasized that anionic parts of complexes 1 and 3 belong to a completely new structural type, which has never been reported for halobismuthates yet. It can be represented as a result of condensation of tetranuclear {Bi4I16} units via shared two {BiI6} octahedra laying on the longer diagonal of {Bi4} rhombus, forming therefore a one-dimensional coordination polymer. There are two sorts of Bi atoms with different connectivity (two terminals, two μ2, two μ3 or four μ2 and two μ2 iodide ligands, respectively) (Fig. 1). Selected bond lengths are given in Table 1S (see ESI†). It can be noted that some Bi–μ3–I bonds are noticeably elongated (3.411 Å); such effect is usual for iodobismuthates.48,49

An interesting feature of the crystal packing of 1 is the presence of I⋯I contacts between the neighbouring {[Bi3I10]} polymeric chains (Fig. 2). The I⋯I distances are 3.922 Å, being slightly less than the sum of van der Waals radii for two I atoms (3.96 Å);50 therefore, the anionic part of 1 may be considered as a pseudo-two-dimensional. Similar observations were made for several recently reported iodobismuthates,51,52 although such packing effects are not common.

From the point of view of X/Bi ratio (3.33:1), complexes 1 and 3 are the closest to the binary BiX3 among the whole known to date big family of halobismuthates. The only example of another hybrid compound with the same composition of anionic part was reported by Heine.53 In its structure, the Bi–I connectivity patterns are the same as in 1 and 3, but the mutual orientation of {Bi4I16} units is different; therefore, it might be considered as another isomer. Probably, a similar metal–organic framework can be observed in a recently reported all-inorganic CsBi3I10 complex halide, that was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction only, which did not allow for exact crystal structure determination.54,55
In the crystal structures of 2, 4, 5 and 6, the anionic parts belong to the types described earlier and their geometric parameters are within the typical ranges, so these structures are not discussed in details (see ESI† for additional information). In 2 and 4, there are discrete binuclear [Bi2I9]3− units built of {BiI6} octahedra with shared face (in both cases, one solvate CH3CN molecule per one anion is present). Structures 5 and 6 present one-dimensional polymeric {[BiI4]} anions (type E according to the recently proposed47 classification, Fig. 3).44,56,57 Both 5 and 6 were isolated in the form of pure phases. The samples of 2 and, especially, 4 demonstrated relatively low stability in air due to the rapid loss of acetonitrile molecules incorporated in the structure of the solvate as it was confirmed by the chemical analysis. However, their stability was sufficient for further identification by powder XRD and preparation of pure samples.

The preparation of pure phases (powder XRD patterns of 1–6 shown in Fig. 1S to 6S†) allowed us to determine the optical band gap (Eg) values experimentally via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, applying Kubelka–Munk method (see Fig. 7S to 12S in ESI†). For 1–6, the Eg values were 1.78, 1.87, 1.64, 2.21, 2.00 and 1.93 eV, respectively. Considering the optical characteristics of the prepared compounds as well as their molecular structures, we have chosen complexes 1, 3, and 5 for further investigation in thin films as potentially useful photoactive materials for photovoltaic devices.
Thin films of PHBs were prepared by spin-coating from acetonitrile or DMF solutions under inert atmosphere inside the glove box. The optical Eg values of 1, 3, and 5 estimated from the low energy offsets of the absorption profiles of thin films were equal to ∼2.0, 2.03 and 2.26 eV, thus being considerably wider compared to the values deduced from the reflectance spectra of the crystalline powders. It is notable that the Eg of PHBs clearly depends on the degree of “condensation”: the most “condensed” structures 1 and 3 possessing only one organic cation with respect to three Bi ions show the narrowest band gaps, while Eg of the less condensed complex 5 with 1:1 organic cation to bismuth ratio is ca. 0.2–0.3 eV wider.
The XRD patterns of the spin-casted thin films of 1, 3 and 5 match well the reference patterns simulated from single-crystal XRD data as shown in ESI Fig. 13S to 15S.† We did not observe any peaks of BiI3 in the XRD data for the aforementioned thin films, which implies the complete formation of the iodobismuthate complexes.
The thermal stability of thin films of PHBs has been assessed using the dynamic UV-vis spectroscopy and XRD as shown in Fig. 4. Thin films of 1 prepared from DMF solution have revealed a good thermal stability at least until 170 °C. Annealing at 190 °C results in re-crystallization of the film (it becomes opaque and scatters light) and partial decomposition as supported by the XRD data (see Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  Evolution of the UV-vis absorbance spectra (a) and XRD diffraction patterns (b) of thin films of 1 as a function of the annealing temperature. The reference XRD profile simulated from the single crystal X-ray diffraction data for this compound is provided for comparison. 
Thin films of 3 also undergo partial decomposition at 190 °C as it follows from the evolution of the XRD profiles shown in Fig. 16S.† Notably, thin films of complex bismuth iodide 5 of a different structural type (see above) were fairly stable at 190 °C and did not show signs of degradation until 200 °C (Fig. 17S, ESI†). Enhanced thermal stability of 5 as compared to 1 and 3 is most probably related to the presence of bulky methylquinolinium cation, which sublimes in the form of iodide at higher temperatures than N-methylpyridinium and N-ethylpyridinium iodides. Additionally, different metal-halogen frameworks in the crystals of 1 and 3vs.5 are expected to affect all properties of these compounds including their thermal stability.
The observed correlations were also valid for bulk crystalline powders. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) showed that bismuthates 1, 2, 3 and 4 are thermally stable up to 250 °C (Fig. 18S and 19S, ESI†), while complexes 5 and 6 exhibit better thermal stability up to 300 °C (Fig. 20S, ESI†).
It should be emphasized that iodobismuthates investigated in this work demonstrate record-high thermal stability in comparison with the most of other reported hybrid perovskite and perovskite-like absorbers. In particular, thin films of conventional lead-based perovskite material MAPbI3 undergo complete decomposition at the temperature of 90 °C.58
Bismuth-based compound MA3Bi2I9 was even less stable: thin films decomposed at 65–70 °C within 150 h leaving blank glass substrates behind due to a facile sublimation of all the components (MAI and BiI3, see Fig. 21S†). Therefore, we conclude that advanced thermal stability of the designed complex bismuth halides 1, 3 and 5 makes promising their deeper exploration as potentially valuable photovoltaic materials.
The planar junction solar cells were fabricated in a standard configuration ITO/c-TiO2/photoactive layer/P3HT/Au as shown schematically in Fig. 5a. Briefly, ITO electrodes were covered with a compact layer of titanium dioxide serving as an electron transport (hole-blocking) layer. The photoactive films of 1, 3 or 5 were processed by spin-coating from acetonitrile and DMF solutions and their phase identity was assessed by powder XRD. The cells were completed by depositing the films of the hole transporting material P3HT and gold electrodes. While optimizing the device performance, we varied the active layer thickness from ∼150 nm to 250 nm, applied thermal annealing at temperatures below the decomposition points of iodobismuthates and, also varied the thickness of the P3HT coating. Unfortunately, all cells showed rather poor photovoltaic characteristics (as compared to standard perovskite solar cells using MAPbI3) with the best power conversion efficiencies of 0.02%, 0.12% and 0.08% for complexes 1, 3 and 5 used as active layer materials, respectively (Fig. 5b). The performance of these materials is limited mostly by extremely low short circuit current densities, while the open circuit voltages and fill factors were also not high (Table 2).

Low current densities and external quantum efficiencies (EQE, Fig. 6c) of the devices suggest severe problems with the charge carrier generation, transport or/and extraction at the electrodes. The formation of interfacial barriers blocking the charge extraction is most likely not the case because using some other ETL and HTL layers (e.g. ZnO, spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA) did not improve the results, while the solar cells fabricated in the inverted configuration (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PCBM/Ag) showed much inferior performances in case of the investigated in detail complex 3.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of possible orientations of 1D polymeric Bi–I chains in thin films of the investigated PHBs: vertical required for efficient PV operation (a); horizontal facilitating in-plane conductivity and blocking vertical transport (b) and statistically disordered (c). Note that two latter orientations are expected to deliver poor performances in solar cells. Dark blue color symbolizes conductive Bi–I 1D frameworks, while ivory color denotes positions of insulating organic cations breaking the charge transport. 
Top-view and cross-sectional SEM (ESI Fig. 22S†) and AFM (ESI Fig. 23S†) images of thin films of investigated iodobismuthates showed pinholes-free and uniform surface coverage, suggesting that film morphology is not the main cause of their poor photovoltaic performance.
Most likely, complexes 1, 3 and 5 suffer either from poor generation of charge carriers or from severe problems with their transport towards the electrodes. Considering the crystal structures of these PHBs, we can envisage a facile transport of the charge carriers along the 1D polymeric frameworks composed of the interconnected Bi and I ions (Fig. 1 and 3). In case of 3, charges might also move between the neighbouring 1D chains via short I–I contacts as shown in Fig. 2. However, hoping of charges between the 1D chains in case of 3 and 5 or quasi-2D layers of 1 can be strongly inhibited, especially if they are separated in space by bulky organic cations (Fig. 24S–26S, ESI†). As a result, charge transport in thin films of the aforementioned PHBs has to be strongly anisotropic and this is apparently the main cause for the poor photovoltaic performance of these materials.
Indeed, the lead halide perovskites have real 3D Pb–I (Br, Cl) framework making charge transport (and other properties) in these materials isotropic and efficient in all three dimensions. Therefore, lead halide based perovskites can be processed easily and deliver exciting efficiencies in solar cells. On the contrary, vast majority of known and investigated 2D layered Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite like phases, also based on lead halides, generally show poor photovoltaic performances.59–62 However, the situation became drastically different when researchers found a way to arrange 2D layers perpendicularly to the substrate, thus enabling efficient vertical charge transport in the active layer resulting also in impressive power conversion efficiencies of >12%.63,64
The crucial role of the proper alignment of the 1D metal–halogen frameworks for achieving efficient vertical charge transport and high photovoltaic performances is highlighted in Fig. 6. Only the vertical orientation of the Bi–I chains shown at the cartoon in Fig. 6a can enable their efficient operation in conventional photovoltaic cells. Horizontal orientation of the chains (Fig. 6b) will probably make almost impossible the transfer of charge carriers through the active layer towards bottom and top electrodes. Random orientation of the chains in disordered films (Fig. 6c) will also hamper photovoltaic performance of the material.
We strongly believe that similar orientation effects are governing the photovoltaic performance of the PHBs 1, 3 and 5 investigated in this work. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis have shown that 1D Bi–I frameworks in complexes 1 (Fig. 24S†) and 3 (Fig. 25S†) are oriented horizontally in the films, which explains extremely low efficiencies they delivered in solar cells. Thin films of 5 were found to be orientationally disordered with a considerable fraction of amorphous phase and two distinct types of crystalline domains showing both horizontal and vertical orientation of the 1D Bi–I chains with respect to the substrate (Fig. 26S†). The presence of some fraction of vertically oriented domains in thin film of 5 facilitating charge transport in a proper direction is probably the reason why this material delivered similar current densities and efficiencies to the complexes 1 and 3 having considerably narrower Eg values (Table 2).
To sum up, the efficient operation of the strongly anisotropic complex bismuth halides 1, 3 and 5 in solar cells can only be possible if one finds a way to prepare ordered films with vertical orientation of the 1D Bi–I chains in the active layer of the device like shown in Fig. 6a. This task, while being scientifically very appealing, is practically extremely challenging at least in view of the current state-of-the-art in the field of 2D crystal engineering of similar systems.
Considering the fact that 1D polymeric Bi–I chains in thin films of 1 and 3 have horizontal (parallel) orientation with respect to the substrate, these materials are expected to show interesting light-induced effects in the lateral two-electrode devices shown schematically in Fig. 7a.
 Fig. 7  A schematic layout of the lateral devices with thin films of PHBs (a). Current–voltage characteristics of the lateral diodes with the photoactive 3+I2 films measured in dark and under illumination (violet laser, λ = 405 nm, 70 mW cm−2) in the forward (solid lines) and reverse (dashed lines) directions (b). Light-induced switching of the devices at the bias voltage of 100 V (c). 
We explored the behavior of the most interesting compound 3 in that context. It should be noted that the channel length in the lateral device is ∼100 μm, which is about three orders of magnitude larger compared to the thickness of the films investigated in the vertical diode configuration (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the effective device active area contributing to the charge carrier injection in the lateral two-electrode device is several orders of magnitude less compared to the active area of the solar cell. Therefore, the observed dark currents of >10−8 A at 100 V indicate quite good lateral conductivity in thin films of 3 (Fig. 27S(b), ESI†).
It should be emphasized that such currents can be achieved only for the best organic semiconductors like C60 (field-effect electron mobility μ up to 10 cm2 V−1 s−1) or DNTT (hole mobility up to 15 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the same device configurations (Fig. 28S, ESI†). Moreover, we observed a strong photoconductivity in the lateral devices based on 3: shining violet laser light (405 nm, 70 mW cm−2) resulted in the increase in the current by more than one order of magnitude. This result confirms that charge generation is most probably quite efficient in thin films of 3. The switching of the devices by light was reversible and could be repeated many times as shown in Fig. 27S(c) (ESI†). Therefore, these lateral devices can operate as photodetectors. Note, that planar red light detectors were reported recently for CsBi3I10 suggesting that this material also has facilitated in-plane conductivity and blocked charge transport in vertical direction.55
The obtained results suggest that the lateral conductivity in thin films of 3 is indeed much more efficient compared to the vertical charge transport. This kind of behavior results from a strong anisotropy of the structure and properties of this 1D material. To address this problem, one might think about interconnecting 1D chains in the structure of 3 with some bridging ligands. The structure of compound 1 shown in Fig. 2 suggests that I–I contacts might serve as such linkers. This approach has been presented in the literature recently.65,66 Therefore, we introduced molecular iodine in the solution of 3 before coating thin films. The resulting 3+I2 films had somewhat different optical properties compared to the reference films of pristine 3 (Fig. 29S, ESI†). The XRD analysis showed that 3+I2 samples are considerably more crystalline compared to thin films of pristine 3. The shift of the main reflections and appearance of some new peaks in the XRD pattern of 3+I2 suggests that iodine is indeed incorporated in the crystal structure of 3 leading to some unit cell distortions. Nevertheless, very strong similarity in the XRD profiles of 3 and 3+I2 systems suggests that the crystal structure did not evolve significantly after iodine incorporation (Fig. 30S ESI†).
Interestingly, the modification of thin films of 3 with iodine decreased significantly the dark currents measured in the corresponding lateral two-electrode device. However, the photoconductivity was strongly enhanced as can be concluded from the further rise of the current by one order of magnitude compared to the devices based on the film of pristine 3. The current amplification ratio induced by light approaches now almost two orders of magnitude at ∼100 V (Fig. 7b). It should be emphasized that the fabricated device gives fast and intense photoresponse on multiple light pulses (Fig. 7c).
In summary, complex iodobismuthate 3 in the pristine and iodine-modified formulations can be considered as a promising platform for future photodetector applications. The role of iodine is not fully clear at the moment since we were not able to isolate single crystals of the corresponding complex 3+I2 and perform their crystallographic characterization. Nevertheless, it is already clear that the proposed approach based on incorporating some linkers increasing the structural and electronic dimensionality of the system has a bright future in the design of new materials for efficient photovoltaic and other types of electronic devices.
Conclusions
We have shown that rational screening of the “BiI3 + Cation-I” systems by changing templating univalent organic cations and varying the reagent molar ratios can deliver a number of interesting complex bismuth iodides. In particular, we synthesized and characterized two complexes (1 and 3) belonging to a completely new structural type never reported before. These complexes have a general composition A[Bi3I10] (A = N-MePy+ or N-EtPy+) with the anionic Bi–I framework representing 1D coordination polymers linked in quasi-2D layered structures by short I–I contacts in case of 1. Using more bulky organic cations in excessive amounts with respect to BiI3 allowed us to obtain more common products of the general formula A[BiI4] (A is N-methylquinolinium or N-methylisoquinolinium) also featuring 1D anionic Bi–I polymeric frameworks in their structures.
The optical properties of the designed complexes were shown to be strongly dependent on their chemical composition and structure. The most “condensed” complex iodides 1 and 3 possessing only one organic cation with respect to three Bi ions show the narrowest Eg value of ∼2.0 eV in thin films. On the contrary, less condensed complex 5 with 1:1 organic cation to bismuth ratio demonstrate ca. 0.2–0.3 eV higher Eg values. All investigated complexes have inferior optical characteristics compared to the binary bismuth iodide BiI3 (Eg ∼ 1.7 eV). Apparently, all conventional complex bismuth halides might be not very suitable for designing efficient solar cells in the view of the limited light harvesting ability of these materials.
Planar junction solar cells fabricated using complexes 1, 3 and 5 showed rather poor efficiencies approaching 0.1% only. The main limitation for the photovoltaic performance of these materials is believed to be related to a strong anisotropy of their structures and, hence, all properties including charge transport. 1D coordination Bi–I polymer chains have predominantly horizontal (parallel) orientation with respect to the substrate. On the one hand, this feature severely hampers charge transport in the out-of-plan directions and, thus, ruins the solar cell performance. On the other hand, it results in a high in-plane photoconductivity of the complex iodobismuthate films featuring them as promising materials for lateral photodetector applications.
Finally, the performed study allowed us to formulate some important guidelines for design of promising light absorbing materials for “perovskite” photovoltaics. Structural and electronic dimensionality of the material apparently plays the primary role. The most efficient are the real 3D metal–halogen frameworks like those featured by the lead and tin halide based perovskites. A recently reported quasi-3D structure derived from antimony(V) halides and enabled by short halogen-to-halogen contacts also exhibited isotropic charge transport and good photovoltaic performance.46
In case of low-dimensional 2D and 1D systems, the anisotropy of the charge transport seems to be the main obstacle for their efficient photovoltaic operation. One has to elaborate advanced methods of crystal engineering for growing 1D columns or 2D layers in orthogonal direction to the substrate thus enabling efficient vertical transport and good photovoltaic performance. A successful example of such controlled film growth has been demonstrated recently for 2D layered Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite-like materials based on the lead halides.63 Similar approaches have to be developed and applied in future to bismuth and, most likely, also antimony halides for achieving good photovoltaic performances for this group of materials.

X-ray crystallography
Crystallographic data and the refinement details for 1–6 are given in Table 2S (ESI†). The diffraction data were collected on a New Xcalibur (Agilent Technologies) diffractometer with MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073) by doing φ scans of narrow (0.5°) frames at 130 K. Absorption correction was done empirically using SCALE3 ABSPACK (CrysAlisPro, Agilent Technologies, Version 1.171.37.35 (release 13-08-2014 CrysAlis171.NET) (compiled Aug 13 2014, 18:06:01)). Structure was solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares treatment against |F|2 in anisotropic approximation with SHELX 2014/768 in ShelXle program.69 Hydrogen atoms were refined in geometrically calculated positions for 1–4 and 6, for complex 5 H-atoms were not refined due to strong disordering of Me-quinolinium cation and were added directly to the complex composition. The SQUEZZE procedure70 in PLATON71 was used to calculate electron count in the voids inside the crystal structure of 2. According to the calculation, 26 electrons were found and we suggested the presence of one CH3CN molecule inside each cavity. The main geometrical parameters are summarized in Table 1S (see ESI†). The crystallographic data have been deposed in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre under the deposition codes CCDC 1566485–1566490.†
Powder XRD
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker Corporation, Germany) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 A), and the scanning rate was fixed. Thin films were prepared by spin-coating solutions of BiI3 (200 mg mL−1 of DMF), 1 (100 mg of BiI3 and 12.4 mg of N-methylpyridinium iodide in 1 mL of DMF), 3 (50 mg of BiI3 and 13.2 mg of N-ethylpyridinium iodide in 4 mL of acetonitrile), 5 (44.8 mg of BiI3 and 20.6 mg of N-methylquinolinium iodide in 1.5 mL of DMF) on glass substrates inside an argon-filled glove box. Thin films of all complexes annealed at different temperatures specified in the text for ten minutes were investigated in addition to as-deposited films. To avoid any ambient degradation, all samples were coated with an encapsulating layer of polystyrene (75 mg/mL, 5000 rpm/40 s) inside the glove box before running XRD.
Grazing incidence XRD
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns on thin films were collected on BM26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble, France) with energy of 12 keV (λ = 1.0 Å). 2D patterns were recorded using Frelon detector with sample-to-detector distance ca. 9.5 cm. The incidence angle was 0.20° for all experiments. The modulus of the scattering vector s (s = 2sinθ/λ, where θ is the Bragg angle) was calibrated using several diffraction orders of the silver behenate powder. The indexing of corrected for geometrical distortions and flat field 2D-GIWAXS patterns was performed using home-made software routine written in Igor Pro.
Fabrication and characterization of planar junction solar cells
Bismuth(III) iodide BiI3 (99999%, Sigma-Aldrich), anhydrous CH3CN (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), and N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used without further purification.
ITO glass (Kintec, 15 Ω sq.−1) was cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Afterwards, a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (0.15 M in n-butanol) was spin-coated (2500 rpm) and baked at 120 °C for 15 minutes on a hot plate. Atop of the first TiO2 layer, solution of 0.3 M of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in n-butanol was spin-coated onto the substrate at the same conditions, then baked at 420 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
The solutions of 1, 3 and 5 were spin-coated onto TiO2 layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s, 1000 rpm for 40 s and 700 rpm for 40 s, respectively. P3HT hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) at 1800 rpm for 60 s. Top Au electrodes (150 nm) were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask in vacuum (5 × 10−6 mbar). The device active area was in the range of 0.4 cm2 as defined by a shadow mask.
The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured under inert atmosphere using Advantest R6240A source-meter coupled with Newport Verasol AAA class solar simulator. The solar simulator was calibrated using a reference silicon diode to produce a uniform solar spectrum (AM1.5G) at intensity level of 100 mW cm−2. The EQE measurements were conducted using PV Instruments QEXL solar cell quantum efficiency measurement station at chopping frequency of 100 Hz at zero bias. AFM maps were scanned using Si probe with conductive W2C coating (at scan rate of 1 Hz) and a Cypher ES atomic force microscope installed in an Ar-filled MBraun glove box. SEM images were obtained on a Zeiss SUPRA 25 instrument. The samples were mounted on a microscope stage inside the glove box to minimize the time of air exposure. The TGA measurements were carried out on TG 209 F1 (NETZSCH-Gerätebau GmbH) instrument from 20 °C to 450 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1 under He gas with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1.

 	Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of possible orientations of 1D polymeric Bi–I chains in thin films of the investigated PHBs: vertical required for efficient PV operation (a); horizontal facilitating in-plane conductivity and blocking vertical transport (b) and statistically disordered (c). Note that two latter orientations are expected to deliver poor performances in solar cells. Dark blue color symbolizes conductive Bi–I 1D frameworks, while ivory color denotes positions of insulating organic cations breaking the charge transport.	 

 	Fig. 7  A schematic layout of the lateral devices with thin films of PHBs (a). Current–voltage characteristics of the lateral diodes with the photoactive 3+I2 films measured in dark and under illumination (violet laser, λ = 405 nm, 70 mW cm−2) in the forward (solid lines) and reverse (dashed lines) directions (b). Light-induced switching of the devices at the bias voltage of 100 V (c).
