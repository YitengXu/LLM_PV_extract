The nanostructures show a power conversion efficiency of 3% upon mixing with PC61BM in bulk-heterojunction solar cells without thermal annealing.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) small molecular organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, despite their inferior performance compared to the polymer or inorganic hybrid counterparts, still attract much attention owing to their outstanding cost-effectiveness and large-area applicability through solution processing in addition to diversity in available organic semiconductors.1,2 For BHJ-OPV devices, control over the self-assembly of semiconducting materials through solvent processing is of primary importance in view of creating ideal p–n heterojunction nanostructures.3 Thus, enormous supramolecular insight into how molecular aggregation can be controlled in solution as well as in the bulk state, provided by a myriad of research examples, must contribute largely to this advanced research field.4 However, multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions, a typical supramolecular tool to control molecular assembly, have been rarely applied for organic photovoltaic materials, due to the requirements of installing solubilizing yet non-conducting long alkyl chains into molecular scaffolds.5
As a promising supramolecular design for hydrogen-bonding semiconductors applicable to the organic photovoltaic application, we have recently developed barbituric acid-functionalized oligothiophenes, wherein solubilizing short alkyl chains are grafted onto the π-conjugated backbone.6 For example, compound 1 is organized into semiconducting nanorods through the formation of hexameric hydrogen-bonded aggregates (rosettes) via solution processing (Fig. 1). This self-assembly pathway occurred in the presence of PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), and the resulting p–n blend film showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1% in the BHJ-OPV device under optimized conditions. To further improve the functionality of this supramolecular design, herein we have devised a strategy to end-functionalization of 1 with the semiconducting backbone (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1 and 1-BDT. 
An alkoxy substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit is a promising electron donating building block for organic photovoltaics due to its excellent charge carrier transporting properties arising from a large and planar π-conjugated structure.7 We expect that a low charge carrier mobility (∼10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, vide infra) of our parent compound 1 can be improved by its end-functionalization with the BDT unit. We thus synthesized 1-BDT according to Scheme S1 (ESI†). In the previous study, we confirmed the formation of a hexameric rosette for 1 by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the liquid–solid interface. To understand the impact of the BDT unit on this self-assembling motif, we performed the STM analysis of 1-BDT.

Fig. 2a shows that 1-BDT forms a sophisticated self-assembled structure at the interface between 1-phenyloctane and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The molecules preferentially form closely packed rosette structures on the surface. The different rosettes have been colored in green, red, blue and yellow as a guide to the eye. Isolated molecules are shown in grey. The majority of rosettes are composed of 6 molecules (Fig. 2b), but rosettes composed of 7 and 8 molecules were also observed (Fig. 2c and d). The arms of the rosette can adopt different conformations on the surface, due to the flexibility of the oligothiophene backbone.8 Despite the variation in conformation and the number of molecules, the average diameter of rosettes is uniform and is ∼7 nm, similar to the diameter of the molecular modeled rosette structure composed of 6 molecules (7.1 nm, Fig. 2e).

(b)–(d) Rosettes composed of (b) 6, (c) 7, and (d) 8 molecules, respectively. Image size: 9 × 9 nm2. (e) Molecular modelled 6-membered rosette of 1-BDT. (f) Concentration-dependent 1H NMR spectra of 1-BDT (c = 1 × 10−4–2 × 10−2 M) in CDCl3. Inset: CHCl3 gel of 1-BDT and CHCl3 solution of 1, obtained after 0.5 h upon cooling homogeneous hot solutions (c = 2 × 10−2 M) to room temperature. 
The formation of hydrogen-bonded rosettes using 1-BDT was supported by the 1H NMR study in CDCl3. Fig. 2f shows the concentration-dependent 1H NMR spectra of 1-BDT. At 1 × 10−4 M, sharp signals of NH protons of the barbituric acid moiety (Hsyn and Hanti) appeared at 7.73 and 7.65 ppm, respectively.6 Upon increasing the concentration, the NH signals showed gradual downfield shifts, indicating hydrogen bonding. The difference in the chemical shift value between the two proton signals increased from Δδ = 0.13 ppm at c = 1 × 10−4 M to Δδ = 0.58 ppm at c = 2 × 10−2 M, which indicates that these protons experience distinct deshielding effects from the neighboring molecules. The finding may indicate the formation of a screw-shaped hydrogen-bonded rosette motif, as shown in Fig. 2b. The signals of the olefinic proton (Ha) and the thiophene proton (Hb) did not show such a large change upon increasing the concentration to 1 × 10−2 M. These spectral changes are similar to those of the previously reported molecule 1, and suggest that 1-BDT forms well-defined hydrogen bonded oligomers, rather than polymeric assemblies arising from a competing tape-like hydrogen-bonding motif in CDCl3. Interestingly, the solution at c = 2 × 10−2 M turned into a gel upon standing for 30 min at room temperature (inset in Fig. 2f). The gelation in CDCl3 was not observed for 1, suggesting that the BDT units decrease the solubility appreciably.
Since the formation of gel in CDCl3 implies that 1-BDT organizes into higher-order nanoscopic aggregates through the formation of rosettes, the chloroform gel (c = 2 × 10−2 M) was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) upon spin-coating onto the HOPG substrate. However, only granular objects with 50 nm in size were visualized (Fig. S5, ESI†). In order to observe individual columnar aggregates formed by stacked rosettes, a dilute solution of 1-BDT (1 × 10−4 M) in toluene, which is less polar than CHCl3, was drop-cast onto the HOPG substrate and the solvent was allowed to evaporate slowly under ambient conditions to grow the columnar aggregates.6 The AFM images of the substrate displayed islands composed of densely aligned short nanorods with lengths of 20–80 nm (Fig. 3a). The cross-sectional analysis of the aligned nanorods showed that the average top-to-top distance between neighbouring rods was 5.3 nm whereas their average height was 4.0 nm. The discrepancy between these dimensions may indicate a tilted stacking of rosettes to form a column with an ellipsoidal cross-section.

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of a dilute CHCl3 solution (c = 1 × 10−5 M) of 1-BDT showed two absorption bands similarly to 1 (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, the absorption intensity of the lower wavelength band is much higher for 1-BDT. The increased absorption intensity in the lower wavelength region is ascribable to the contribution of BDT units.7c Interestingly, the spectrum of the thin film prepared by spin-coating a chloroform solution exhibited a strong bathochromic and hypochromic shift for the transition of the BDT unit, suggesting strong aggregation of this unit in the solid state. The absorption band of the oligothiophene scaffold is broadened due to π–π stacking aggregation. The optical bandgap of 1-BDT in the film state, estimated from the absorption onset (λonset = 688 nm), is Eg = 1.80 eV. The HOMO energy level of 1-BDT was evaluated using photoelectron yield spectroscopy under atmospheric pressure and was found to be −5.00 eV, which is almost identical to that of 1 (−5.06 eV). The value of the LUMO energy level, thus estimated by subtracting the value of the HOMO energy level from the optical band gap, is −3.20 eV, which is also comparable to that of 1 (Table 1). These results indicate that the introduction of the BDT unit has a minimal impact on the electronic structure of the π-conjugated system.

BHJ solar cells were fabricated using 1-BDT as a donor material and PC61BM as an acceptor material. The active layer composed of 1-BDT and PC61BM (denoted as 1-BDT:PC61BM) was prepared by spin-coating a chloroform solution of 1:1 (w:w) blends of the donor and acceptor materials onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates under a N2 atmosphere followed by vapour depositing Ca/Al as an anode.9 In our previous studies,6 we reported BHJ solar cells of 1:PC61BM, whose active layers were prepared by using a solvent mixture of chloroform and toluene (1:1 v/v). For these devices, we observed the highest PCE of 2.1% after thermal annealing. However, the addition of toluene, even in 10% to chloroform, as a co-solvent for the preparation of 1-BDT:PC61BM seriously decreased the solubility of 1-BDT. In the present study, we thus fabricated solar cells of 1:PC61BM under the same condition as 1-BDT:PC61BM in order to focus on the introduction of the BDT unit.
In Fig. 4a and Table 2, the device properties of solar cells using as-cast and thermally annealed films of 1-BDT:PC61BM and 1:PC61BM are compared. The as-cast device of 1-BDT:PC61BM showed significant improvements in Jsc and FF compared to that of 1:PC61BM, leading to a PCE of 2.98%, far greater than that of 1:PC61BM (0.76%). The improved Jsc is rationalized by a higher charge carrier mobility of 1-BDT (1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of 1 (∼10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1), as estimated by the top-contact bottom-gate configuration organic field effect transistor (OFET) fabricated using solution-processed thin films (Fig. S7, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the 1-BDT:PC61BM device exhibited a panchromatic spectral response over the entire excitation spectral range, indicating the contribution of both 1-BDT and PC61BM on the photocurrent generation. The maximum EQE value of 42% was observed at 420 nm and 580 nm, which corresponds to the absorption maxima of the BDT unit and the oligothiophene backbone, respectively (Fig. 4b and Fig. S8, ESI†). The increased EQE response in the shorter wavelength region reflects the positive influence of the BDT unit both on light harvesting and on the charge carrier mobility. Unlike 1:PC61BM, the device performance was reduced upon annealing the film of 1-BDT:PC61BM.10

The surface morphology of 1-BDT:PC61BM was studied by AFM (Fig. S9, ESI†). Although no well-defined nanostructure was imaged for the as-cast film, the thermally annealed films exhibited rod-like nanostructures. The rod-like morphology became well-defined with the increasing annealing temperature. The similar effect of thermal annealing on the nanostructure change was observed for 1:PC61BM, wherein the growth of nanorods improved the solar cell performance. The reason why the solar cell performance of 1-BDT:PC61BM was decreased by thermal annealing albeit the growth of rod-like nanostructures is unclear at the present, presumably a phase-separated structure optimum for this semiconducting material was already achieved through solution processing.11
In addition to the surface morphology, the packing structure of the 1-BDT:PC61BM film was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in addition to that of 1-BDT in the neat film. A thin film of 1-BDT, prepared by the evaporation of CHCl3 solution (c = 3.8 × 10−3 M, 5 mg mL−1), displayed two broad diffraction peaks in the lower angle region, corresponding to d = 4.5 nm and 1.7 nm (Fig. 5a). The d-value of 4.5 nm is close to the width of the rosette column (5.3 nm) observed by AFM, and the d-value of 1.7 nm can be attributed to the periodic length along the stacking direction of rosettes. The absence of other diffractions in the small angle region suggests that the 1-BDT rosette is organized in a columnar architecture without 2D ordering. In contrast, the thin film of 1-BDT:PC61BM showed explicit diffraction peaks with d-spacings which can be assigned to the diffractions from the (110), (200), (210), and (001) planes of a rectangular 2D lattice (space group: P21/a, lattice parameters: a = 6.2 nm, b = 4.7 nm) in the ab plane, which is complemented by the formation of one-dimensional columns along the c axis, formed by the stacking of rosettes with a periodic length of 1.7 nm (Fig. 5b).12 These results show that 1-BDT can organize into a one-dimensional columnar architecture via the formation of rosettes in the presence of PC61BM.13

In summary, we have shown that the functionalization of the rosette-forming hydrogen-bonding oligothiophene with semiconducting π-units does not affect the formation of rosettes followed by the hierarchical organization into columnar structures. Further modification and functionalization of our supramolecular material design may provide unprecedented low-molecular-weight materials exhibiting outstanding optoelectronic properties as well as processability in addition to the unique self-organization motif.

After careful screening of various parameters for device fabrication, we have chosen chloroform as a processing solvent, 1:1 (w:w) for the optimum D/A blend ratio and 100–120 nm for thicknesses of the active layer, which can be prepared with a total concentration of 10 mg mL−1 of the organic materials.
We also fabricated solar cells of 1-BDT and PC71BM. However, the devices showed lower performance than those using PC61BM. The highest PCE of the 1-BDT:PC71BM device is = 2.77%. This might be due to the fact that both 1-BDT and PC71BM are highly aggregative, which induces a significant phase separation.
