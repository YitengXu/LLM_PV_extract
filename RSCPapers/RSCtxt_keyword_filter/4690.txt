    , Accepted 8th November 2021First published on 8th November 2021AbstractElectrocatalysts are essential for the increased use of promising electrochemical energy conversion/storage technologies, where the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) are intensively involved. Much effort has been devoted to regulating the components, phases, crystallinity, facets, morphology and defects to optimize the electronic structures for improved catalytic activity. However, it is still a great challenge to develop low-cost and efficient electrocatalysts. Recently, photo-assisted electrocatalysis has attracted extensive research interest due to its appealing benefits for the charge transfer, surface electronic structures, and reaction selectivity. It adds a new dimension for electrocatalyst optimization, although it is still in the preliminary stage. A comprehensive and timely review on this specific subject is necessary, aiming to present recent significant achievements and challenges and point out future research directions. In this review, three primary strategies for photo-assisted electrocatalysis are systematically summarized: photo-generated carrier-assisted, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-assisted, and photothermally-assisted electrochemical enhancement.

1. Introduction
Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, we have been obsessed with rapid economic development, which has relied heavily on fossil fuels yet has neglected the negative impacts of the incidental rising global population, increasing energy demand, severe energy crisis, climate change, and environmental pollution.1,2 Nowadays, major concerns have been raised over the security of the future of global energy. Developing sustainable, fossil-free pathways to produce fuels and chemicals of global importance has been regarded as a cornerstone of the world’s future prosperity and economic growth.1,3,4 Electrochemical conversion processes are one of the most promising clean energy conversion strategies, since they can convert molecules of water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen into higher-value products (hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia) when using only renewable energy inputs, which later can be released for practical utilization on-demand.5–7 Typical devices include water/carbon dioxide/nitrogen electrolyzers, fuel cells, metal–air/oxygen batteries, etc., involving the reactions of the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER), oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and so on.8–10
Electrocatalysts are of paramount importance to increase the rate, efficiency, and selectivity of electrochemical reactions.5,11–13 A great challenge is to develop low-cost and advanced electrocatalysts with the enhanced performance needed to enable the widespread use of clean energy technologies.14–16 Noble metals or their compounds are generally the most superior electrocatalysts for each electrochemical reaction (e.g., Pt for HER/HOR/ORR, Ir/RuOx for OER and Au/Ag for CRR).17–21 However, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals hinder their wide practical application at a large scale. Developing high-performance electrocatalysts made of earth-abundant elements or noble metals at a low content is at this moment the hottest topic in the field.22–25 Numerous promising electrocatalysts with varying compositions have been screened (e.g., MoS2/NiMo for HER, NiOx/NiNx@carbon for HOR, NiFeOx/CoFeOx/CoFeWOx for OER, Fe single atom@N doping carbon, and Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, Ni…) for ORR).26–28 Substantial progress has been made in the fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic reactions with the assistance of advanced synthesis and characterization techniques, particularly in situ techniques combined with theoretical calculations.29–32 Based on these, catalytic trends have been revealed and can ultimately provide guidelines towards the rational design of improved electrocatalysts. Regulation of the components, phases, crystallinity, facets, morphology, defects, and so on has been extensively employed to optimize the electronic structures for improved catalytic activity.33–36 Despite these notable advances, there remains substantial room for further improvements. For example, efficient HER catalysts working in bases and OER catalysts in acids are both rare;37 even in alkaline conditions, the state-of-the-art OER catalysts require an overpotential of ∼200 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, due to the scaling relations among the reactive intermediates;38 the HOR catalysts are dominated by nickel-based compounds and their activity is, to date, much inferior to those of noble metals.39,40 Besides the weak activity, the CRR suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity and the low yield of hydrocarbon products.41 Moreover, a large portion of the earth-abundant transition metal compounds are semiconductors or even insulators, which slows the charge transfer in the catalysts and therefore imposes additional overpotential.42–44 The conductivity issue is worsened in practical electrolyzers where a higher current density is generally employed. In sum, today’s electrocatalysts are inadequate. Strategies beyond the conventional optimization scope are urgently demanded for the pursuit of advanced electrocatalysts to increase the reaction rate, efficiency, and selectivity of electrochemical energy conversion technologies.
Photo-assisted electrocatalysis is an emerging strategy to boost catalytic performance with only the input of renewable energy.45,46 The light is absorbed by electrocatalysts or a second phase adhered to them to modulate the electronic structure or affect the local environment, accelerating the electrochemical reaction on the surface.45,47 It is somewhat different from the conventional photocatalysis and photo(electro)catalysis processes, where typical photocatalysts are required for light absorption to form high-energy electrons and holes to drive subsequent electrochemical reactions.48,49 The photocatalysts must match the bandgap with the light wavelength and conduction band (CB) and/or valence band (VB) edge with the chemical reaction potential. This is not always the case for photo-assisted electrocatalysts.50–52 In principle, photo-assisted electrocatalysts can not only be directly used to enhance electrocatalysis but also assist photo(electro)catalysis where light-response cocatalysts are involved. More specifically, the light spectrum that the electrocatalysts use is unrestrained, which means, for instance, that they can utilize infrared radiation (IR) light that photo(electro)catalysts cannot absorb. Photo-assisted electrocatalysis provides a simple way to improve the catalytic efficiency with the input of only renewable solar energy. So far, there are three strategies for photo-assisted electrocatalysis: photo-generated carrier-assisted, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect-assisted, and photothermally-assisted, where photo-induced charge separation, the LSPR effect, and the photothermal effect are involved, respectively. In addition, the photoresponse has been used for the high throughput screening of efficient electrocatalysts for both the OER and CRR.53,54 Collectively, photo-assisted electrocatalysis is a superior supplement for exploring advanced new electrocatalysts, particularly for the situations that conventional methods encounter enormous difficulties. Photo-assisted electrocatalysis is, however, still in its infancy. A comprehensive review of the current research advances is highly demanded to further push forwards the development of electrocatalysts for energy conversion/storage, but they are rare.55
In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in photo-assisted electrocatalysis, focusing on their primary mechanism, representative research, challenges, and possible future directions. The basic principles of photo-assisted electrocatalysis are firstly introduced and compared with the photo(electro)catalysis analog. The advances in photo-generated carrier-assisted, LSPR-assisted, and photothermally-assisted electrocatalysis are then summarized. The possible mechanisms are outlined in each part. At the end of this review, the present challenges are discussed, and suggestions which are potentially interesting for future studies are provided.
2. General working principle of photo-assisted electrocatalysts
The concept of photo-assisted electrocatalysis was proposed by getting inspiration from the photo(electro)catalysis analog.51 So far, semiconductor-mediated (electro)photocatalytic processes have been widely used in various chemical reactions, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and the catalytic conversion of organic compounds.56–58 Photo-assisted electrocatalysis shares a similar working principle with photo(electro)catalysis in terms of the photoelectric effect. To show the operating principle clearly, we start from conventional photo(electro)catalysis and compare it with photo-assisted electrocatalysis in this section.
In a classical photo(electro)catalysis process, a semiconductor is first excited by incident photons and forms high-energy electron–hole pairs in the conduction and valence bands. These electron–hole pairs migrate to their respective active surfaces to drive the corresponding redox reactions, although some of them recombine and fall back to the ground state before this happens.59,60 The semiconductor’s bandgap is limited to a specific range, the value of which needs to be as small as possible so that the photo-generated carriers can be activated in the larger infrared–visible band, but must exceed the activation energy of the chemical reaction.61,62 Practically, a suitable photoanode/cathode is not a satisfactory electrocatalyst. To improve the photo(electro)catalysis efficiency, cocatalysts are introduced, which are typically coated on photoanodes/cathodes.63–65 The underlying mechanism is under debate for photo(electro)catalysis. For details about the mechanism of photo(electro)catalysis, we suggest referring to Boettcher et al.’s review.66 The basic understanding of photo(electro)catalysts indicates that they may be coupled to conventional electrocatalysts, or, in the other case, the electrocatalysts can be modulated to respond to light as photo(electro)catalysts do to speed up the electrocatalysis. To explain the general working principle of photo-assisted electrocatalysis, we choose a typical mechanism of cocatalyst-assisted photoanodes for illustration, based on the OER process (see below).
Photo-generated holes are the major charge carriers in the OER process. It is thermodynamically favorable for them to accumulate at the semiconductor surface rather than to transfer into the solution. Due to the high carrier recombination rate, charges can only drive the OER catalysis until the photoanode potential becomes sufficiently positive. To elevate the efficiency, electron (ion) permeable electrocatalysts are employed to transfer photo-generated carriers to the solid–liquid interface to lower the recombination rate.67,68 This is called cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysis. In a typical catalysis process,66,69–72 semiconductors of hematite (α-Fe2O3) are the predominant photo-generated hole donors. The holes are fully captured by cocatalysts of Ni0.8Fe0.2OxHy (the carrier collector) via the oxidative conversion of hydroxides to oxyhydroxides. The cocatalysts are charged to the onset potential to drive the OER process. It is worth noting that in this case, photo-generated holes are mostly used to oxidize redox-active species of electrocatalysts rather than for recombination or direct water splitting at the photoanode surface. The mechanism implies that the electrocatalysts, in return, can be boosted when charge carriers are photo-generated on them or from the semiconducting light absorbers adhered to them.14,73,74
Akin to the cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysis, light and electrical energy drive the electrochemical reaction in a cooperative manner in photo-assisted electrocatalysts (Fig. 1c and d). The incident light leads to the photo-generated electrons/holes, and the external potential mitigates the recombination and drives the excess holes into the diffusion layer. In this sense, light illumination lowers the potential to achieve the same reaction rate (current density). As such, the system is named photo-assisted electrocatalysis rather than light-driven electrocatalysis. Electric energy is the predominant energy source. It is worth noting that electric energy may not be demanded in cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysis systems, named bias-free ones. Additionally, the photo(electro)catalysts must match the bandgap with the light wavelength, and conduction band (CB) or/and valence band (VB) edge must match with the chemical reaction potential. This is not always the case for photo-assisted electrocatalysts.50–52 For instance, they can utilize infrared radiation (IR) light that photo(electro)catalysts cannot absorb.
 Fig. 1  (a and c) Pictures of the concepts and (b and d) working models for (a and b) conventional photo(electro)catalysts and (c and d) cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysts in the dark and under illumination at no, low, and high external potentials for OER. The working principle of photo-assisted electrocatalysts (photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysts) is akin to cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysts. Plotted by the authors. 
In principle, electrocatalysts, possessing electronic band structures resembling those of conventional photo(electro)catalysts (Fig. 1a and b) plus active catalytic sites for specific chemical reactions, are ideal candidates for photo-assisted electrocatalysis. This is, unfortunately, quite difficult. For instance, FeOOH nanotube arrays are compliant photoactive electrocatalysts, but their catalytic performance is much inferior compared with those of advanced electrocatalysts.75 In addition, electrocatalysts usually have small band gaps for meeting the fast charge transfer needs of electrochemical reactions, which are, unfortunately, not favorable for producing photo-generated carriers with high energy under illumination. In this regard, electrocatalysts coupled with semiconducting photo absorbers appear to have more potential. In some cases, the combination of photoelectrodes with catalytic inactivity may lead to superb photo-assisted electrocatalysts. For example, PEDOT:polythiophene alloy electrodes exhibited significantly elevated current density for ORR under illumination, whereas neither of the components of the heterojunction could catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction.76
We name the afore-mentioned photo-assisted electrocatalysis ‘photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis’. The advantages of this mechanism are discussed in terms of the charge conduction efficiency in Section 3.1. In principle, any light response effect may tune the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts in a manner resembling the ‘photo-generated carrier-assisted mechanism’. Among them, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect (Section 4) and the photothermal effect (Section 5) are predominantly applicable. In LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis, plasmonic nanoparticles (such as Au, Ag…) rather than semiconducting photo(electro)catalysts are coupled with electrocatalysts for specific reactions. Photo-generated hot electrons/holes are injected into electrocatalysts for accelerated catalysis. The LSPR effect is more effective than the conventional photo-response effect, as the generated charges are of higher energy. Regarding photothermally-assisted electrocatalysis, it is quite different from the photo-generated carrier-assisted one and photo(electro)catalysis. The improvement in electrocatalysis relies on the thermalization of light-excited phonons, which collide with each other to create local areas of high temperature. The local high temperature effectively promotes the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, and might generate some new active species. It is noteworthy that the LSPR effect usually leads to the concurrent photothermal effect, which makes it challenging to distinguish the nonthermal effect from the photothermal one for fundamental research. For clarity, we summarize and depict the exclusive advantages of photo-assisted electrocatalysis systems in Table 1 and compare them with photo(electro)catalysis. To highlight their promising potential, advanced photo-assisted electrocatalysts, as well as their superb performances, are listed in Table 2.

3. Photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis
The photo-generated carriers can enhance the charge transfer efficiency and ion permeability of the electrocatalytic process. In a photo-assisted electrocatalysis system, light and electrical energy drive the electrochemical reaction cooperatively. In this section, we discuss the charge transfer in electrocatalysts and how photo-generated carriers may promote the charge transfer and the electrocatalysis on the surface of thin-film electrocatalysts, followed by recent advances in this topic.
3.1 Charge carriers’ effect on electrocatalysis
The charge transfer rate of catalysts plays a crucial role in almost all electrochemical processes.101,102 According to the classic Marcus theory, the inert/active transition occurs only when an ultra-strong electric field is applied to the semiconductor surface, corresponding to a higher onset potential.103 Recently, Liu et al. reported a considerable accumulation of carriers at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface (named the self-gating effect), which cannot be rationalized by conventional electron conduction theory.104 Additionally, a combined inert/active interface model for semiconductors was proposed to reconcile the electrocatalyst surface conductivity and the high electrocatalytic activity for some thin-film materials with low conductivity.104–106 Both ‘active’ and ‘inert’ regions are at the electrocatalytic interface. Charge transferring processes occur on the active crystalline surfaces of bulk materials and tend to concentrate where a high density of catalytically active sites accumulates (such as the edges or defects of low-dimensional materials).107–110 For example, the catalytically active region of MoS2 for HER is concentrated at the edge sites, and the catalytic reactions on LDH nanosheets are more intense at the edges or defect sites than on the basal planes. This differs from the classical assumption of MIS junctions that the metal–semiconductor contact interface is insulating, but is consistent with the current vision of a catalytic active site theory.26,104 Charge carriers with high density are located tens of nanometers below the interface, corresponding to the lowest Schottky barrier (Fig. 2a). This occurs when the catalysts form a highly permeable thin film on the surface of the photoelectrodes.111 In thicker films, the contact resistance increases between layers and results in lower hole and electron mobility (Fig. 2c).111,112

Semiconductor electrocatalysts are often powders and have different defect densities and surface states, since they are usually prepared by solvothermal or electrochemical deposition methods. They often form disordered porous films on the surface of electrodes, allowing for the easy collecting and transferring of photo-generated carriers to reduce the recombination of electron/hole pairs.14,113 Lin and Boettcher tested the potential and current of electrocatalysts (ECs) and photo-absorbing semiconductors (SCs) in situ.114 For some electron (ion) permeable electrocatalysts, such as Ni(OH)2(NiOOH)/TiO2, an ‘adaptive’ interface was found, where the height of the Schottky barrier was related to the oxidation potential. Conventional ‘buried’ junctions with constant Schottky barriers corresponded to some electron (ion) impermeable electrocatalysts. They showed that Fe (oxy)hydroxide, only when the monolayer with a permeable electrolyte and accessible electrons on the electrode, is OER-active (Fig. 2e).115 Dispersing Fe species into conductive substrates, such as NiOOH or CoOOH, leads to superb OER catalysts of NiFeOOH and CoFeOOH (Fig. 2e). Conductivity-dependent catalytic activities are common in metal oxides, hydroxides, and other catalytic materials. Hu et al. showed that the mass activities and turnover frequencies (TOFs) had a inverse correlation with the loading of electrochemical deposited transition metal oxides/hydroxide films (Fig. 2c).26 The contact resistivity of MoS2 decreases with the increasing thickness when it is beyond five layers, while it increases sharply if the thickness gets larger due to the quantum size effect (Fig. 2d).112 For physically deposited films, the thickness of the catalyst is inhomogeneous, resulting in severe film-thickness dependent ion-permeability. As such, the charge transfer efficiency is usually unfavorable for semiconducting electrocatalysts and may be enhanced via the photo-generated carrier-assisted mechanism.45,47,78
3.2 Photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysts
To satisfy the requirements of conductivity and ion permeability, thin-film photo absorber-electrocatalysts are preferred. However, the quality of films from powder samples is highly dependent on the process conditions, including the electrolyte pH, ion concentration, and temperature. Many efforts have been devoted to optimizing structures and components to enhance the charge transfer efficiency and suppress photo-generated carrier recombination.8,45,75,81–83,116 Elemental doping (with P, F, and other elements) and photocatalyst–electrocatalyst heterojunctions are employed to address the poor intrinsic photo/electrochemical activities and limited active centers. Huang et al. constructed black phosphorus quantum dot/MoS2 heterojunctions to enhance photo-assisted electrocatalytic OER performance (Fig. 3a). Phosphorus doping led to the exposure of many edge active sites and enhanced the long-term stability of MoS2 in KOH solution.45 Shao et al. demonstrated that Ti3C2 MXene modified by P-doped TiO2 produced tunable oxygen vacancies. This would increase charge densities near the valence band and lead to better charge conduction efficiency (Fig. 3b).83 In addition, Zhong and Ma covered the F-doped FeOOH cocatalyst on the hematite photoelectrode, which effectively suppressed the photo-generated carrier complexation at the hematite/electrolyte interface.68,117,118

Metal foam and carbon substrates effectively improve the electrical conductivity of semiconductors.75,81 Hu et al. synthesized amorphous FeOOH nanotubes on carbon cloth using an electrochemical template-etching approach (Fig. 3c and d).75 The carbon substrates and porous nanotubes improved the electronic contact of electrocatalysts and facilitated the mobility of photo-generated carriers. The illumination-induced currents started at ∼1.52 V vs. RHE, which is probably the equilibrium potential where the net carrier flux reaches zero. This is in accordance with the model proposed by Boettcher et al. that illumination-induced currents hardly occur at low potentials.66 The in situ growing strategy is promising in constructing mechanically stable three-phase interfaces of catalyst–substrate–solution on conductive substrates. For instance, Zhang et al. improved the hydrogen production rate of a photo-assisted electrocatalytic water splitting system by 174.1% when growing CdS@Co9S8/Ni3S2 on CoNi foam in situ (Fig. 3e).81
In the electrocatalytic OER process, Ni/Co-based oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides are oxidized to form the corresponding high valent compounds, such as NiOOHx and CoOOHx (x ≤ 1), which subsequently catalyzed the OER. The pre-oxidization also occurs in the photo-assisted electrocatalysis system, where the photo-generated carriers (holes) additionally participate in oxidizing metal centers to form the corresponding active species rather than recombining at a low applied potential.75,77,80 As such, photo-generated carriers lower the onset potential of catalytic reactions. Unfortunately, the enhancement cannot be enlarged at higher applied potentials. In other words, the polarization curves before and after light exposure exhibit two approximately parallel curves after the onset potential. The ‘parallel curves’ phenomenon was revealed in CoCr layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and SnS2/NiO heterojunctions and could be envisaged in HER, ORR, and CRR catalysts, although they have been rarely reported. In CoCr-LDHs (Fig. 4a), Cr ions played a role in light-collecting to form Cr3+–O–Co2+ linkages, where the photo-generated carriers promoted the oxidation of leading OER sites of Co2+ for efficient catalysis.119 Photo-generated holes accumulated on the ‘cocatalyst’ surface and promoted the chemical state change of the active species and the associated surface reconstruction.73,120–122 Yang et al. demonstrated similar photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis in SnS2/NiO heterojunctions. Photo-generated holes were transferred from SnS2 to the electron-deficient centers of NiO, where high-valence Ni3+ species were produced for fast oxidation kinetics (Fig. 4b–f).

Photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis has also been applied in the organic molecular polymer mediated water splitting process. Kang et al. designed photo-assisted bifunctional polyaniline/carbon dots (PANI/CDs) for water splitting.123 A robust testing tool, named transient photovoltage (TPV) technology, was adopted to characterize the charge-transfer kinetic characteristics (Fig. 5a).124 The photo-generated carriers were enabled to transfer from the CDs to PANI, due to the shorter tmax (Fig. 5b). The integrated area of A3 (0.0278) for the PANI/CDs was five-folds larger than the A2 (0.0052) for PANI (Fig. 5c), suggesting a more robust electron extraction in the PANI/CDs. Moreover, the recombination rate was slowed in the PANI/CDs, as evidenced by the much shorter attenuation time of the PANI/CDs than that of bare PANI (Fig. 5d). The TPV diagrams could directly correspond to the production and recombination of photo-generated carriers.

4. LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis
The LSPR effect results in hot electrons/holes, which can be injected into electrocatalysts for improved performances. Therefore, it can be involved in constructing photo-assisted electrocatalytic systems (see details below). In this section, we introduce the mechanisms of the LSPR effect and describe the hot carriers and the coupling of hot phonons in electrocatalytic processes. Representative studies are subsequently given.
4.1 Hot carriers and phonons in the LSPR effect
Thanks to advanced nanotechnology and lithography, the LSPR effect has been widely employed in (photo)electrochemical catalysis.125 When irradiated by incident light, metal nanoparticles of sizes smaller than the incident light wavelength are subject to oscillation around the nucleus, resulting from the photo-induced repulsive force and coulombic force of surface electron clouds (Fig. 6a).125–127 Metals including Au, Ag, and Cu exhibit LSPR effects in the visible light spectrum.128–130 Due to the coupling resonance of the incident photons with the free electrons, the overall vibration of the electrons is significantly enhanced to excite the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.131 The electron cloud resonance is a localized near-field enhancement, which occurs within several nanometers of the particles’ surface. The strong electric field generated by plasmonic nanoparticles can collectively produce a light-trapping network across the entire metal surface.

The excited plasma radiation decays in two manners: radiative decay and nonradiative charge transfer. In the radiative decay process, a small proportion of PNPs decay in a few picoseconds via resonant photon scattering. The adsorbed molecules are entitled to take the energy from re-radiated photons only when the energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) matches the radiation decay energy (Fig. 6b). The rest of resonant activated energy undergoes a nonradiative charge transfer process.132 Carriers near the Fermi level are transferred from the plasmonic nanostructure to the LUMO of the adsorbate molecules indirectly or directly, depending on the strength of the interfacial interaction.133 In an indirect adsorption mode, the plasmonic-activated hot electrons are transferred into the LUMO of the adsorbates (with lower energy levels). The energy states have a Fermi–Dirac distribution.133 Only when hot-electron energies are above the semiconductor conduction band energy can hot electrons transfer at the plasma metal/semiconductor interface, resembling photocatalysis.134 The lower energy part releases via the local thermal effect in several ns around the PNPs.135 In the direct process, the interfacial electrons can pass through the metal–catalyst interface faster. This is named chemical interface damping (CID). There is little thermalization of hot electrons and no specific requirement for the energy states of the hot-electrons. Therefore, direct charge transfer is desirable for plasmonic nanostructures/electrocatalyst systems (with narrow bandgap).128,136 The inevitable thermal dissipation before nonradiative processes dramatically reduces the number of hot electrons, whereas the positive side is that the photoelectric–photothermal synergistic effects can reduce the activation energy and the reaction energy barrier of the catalytic process.137,138
4.2 LSPR-assisted electrocatalysts
Hot carriers can be generated through carrier migration (indirect/direct charge transfer), target orbital transport (direct charge transfer), and hot electron thermalization (phonon–phonon scattering). Only those being generated from the indirect/direct charge transfer eventually flow into the LUMO of the electrocatalysts and drive the redox process. In this section, we will discuss the specific role of the LSPR effect in electrocatalytic systems and focus on the behavior of hot carriers. For hot phonons, SPR-induced phonon–phonon scattering is a major mechanism for the photothermal effect, which will be covered in Section 5.2.2.139,140

4.2.1 Indirect charge transfer mechanism for electrochemical reactions. 
The indirect charge transfer in the LSPR effect has attracted much attention in photo(electro)catalysis, biosensors, and other fields due to its high hot electron generation efficiency and ultra-fast charge transfer rate.141–146 In some cases, PNPs could participate in electrocatalytic reactions directly once being stimulated by the LSPR effect. Xia et al. showed that hot holes were directed to the surface of Au NPs and rapidly consumed by the oxidizing glucose, and hot electrons were driven to the external circuit to avoid the recombination of carriers.147 Wu et al. reported a plasmon-induced hot electron enhancement (PIHEE) approach to improve the catalytic ORR of Ag–graphene nanoplates.91 The LSPR excited hot electrons flew from the Ag side to graphene (Fig. 7a), leaving hot cavities to optimize the adsorption energy of O on the Ag surface for fast ORR kinetics. Saada et al. deposited PNPs on nanoporous gold thin-film electrodes and achieved catalytic performances comparable to Pt/C for ORR.86 In addition, Ag, Au, and Cu nanoparticles are also considered for catalytic conversion of CO2, given that the hot electrons of high energy might activate the reduction of CO2 intermediates.85,148,149

It should be noted that the use of plasmonic nanocatalysts is somewhat limited. Only Au, Ag, and Cu etc. nanoparticles can activate the LSPR effect in visible light. Their high cost and scarce reserves impede their large-scale application. Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles are inferior catalysts for some reactions, such as water splitting, even under photo-assisted conditions.93 To address this issue, PNP–electrocatalyst composites have been employed, where hot carriers migrate from PNPs to the active sites of electrocatalysts to boost the reaction.87,88 Cheng et al. reported an apparent spontaneous interfacial charge transfer between Au nanoparticles and NiCo-LDHs for efficient water splitting catalysis.92 To identify the real active sites, a thiol compound of thiophenol (TP) was encapsulated on Au nanoparticles via covalent Au–S bonds. The variation in catalytic activities (Fig. 7b and c) suggests the HER and OER processes occur on the surface of Au NPs and NiCo-LDHs, respectively. On the other hand, the local electromagnetic fields and the resultant hot carriers may enhance the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst or excite new active sites.91–93,150–154 Ye et al. demonstrated that Au-nanoparticle-induced LSPR excitation could significantly enhance the OER activity of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (Fig. 7e). Hot electrons in Au nanoparticles were injected into electrocatalysts and promoted the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+/4+ species, resulting in a reduction in overpotential from 330 mV to 270 mV.93 This strategy was also feasible in CoO–Au and FeOOH–Au systems (Fig. 7d).93


4.2.2 Direct charge transfer mechanism for electrochemical reactions (selectivity). 
The main difference between the direct and indirect charge transfer mechanism lies in the energy states of the excited electrons. During the nonradiative decay, hot carriers relax into the unoccupied orbitals of absorbers by the direct/indirect excitation of PNPs at the interface (Fig. 8a and b).129 In the indirect charge transfer mechanism, hot carriers tend to move to specific adsorbate states close to the Fermi level due to the higher density. In other words, the hot electron acceptor orbitals are dependent on the Fermi energy of PNPs. The orbital selectivity may be utilized to activate specific reaction pathways (Fig. 8a). Through the analysis of the anti-Stokes and Stokes Raman spectra in a Ag/methylene blue (MB) system, Linic proposed an additional energy dissipation pathway under 785 nm illumination, leading to the non-equilibrium heating of the molecules, compared to under 532 nm illumination.129,155 This result implies that we might tune illumination to activate specific bonds and drive electrons to target orbitals far from the Fermi energy level. This is significant for the CRR and other catalytic processes that suffer from side reactions.85,148,156,157 It is well known that the products of the CRR are dependent on catalysts on the cathode. Au and Ag electrodes can rapidly catalyze the production of CO, and Cu facilitates the formation of higher value-added products, including methane, ethanol, and ethylene. The HER is a predominant competing reaction, which reduces the energy conversion efficiency. Moreover, poor selectivity leads to extra energy consumption and cost from the products’ separation.158 As a taken-for-granted scenario, hot carriers following such a direct charge transfer mechanism can selectively interact with specific reaction intermediates for the CRR, thus precisely controlling the product species and yields. McCloskey et al. showed that H2 production on a nano-Cu–Ag composite cathode was inhibited in the presence of light, and the yields of ethylene, methane, formic acid, and allyl alcohol were enhanced at high applied potentials.149 A similar light response selectivity was revealed in polycrystalline silver thin-film electrodes for aqueous electrochemical CO2 reduction.159 At a cathodic potential of −0.6 V, the illumination greatly inhibited hydrogen production and improved CO production (Fig. 8c–e). Additionally, the yield of formate and methanol also varied with light. Kostecki et al. proposed that the energy levels of the injected hot electrons are sensitive to the electrode potential, plasmon resonance energy, and LUMO of the surface acceptor. Further spectroscopic experiments are expected to identify the adsorbed intermediates for PNPs.85 In short, LSPR-induced charge transfer has been demonstrated to improve the selectivity of catalytic reduction (such as the electrochemical CRR), though the mechanism is obscure.

4.2.3 Optimization of LSPR-assisted electrocatalysts. 
The concentrations of hot carriers and hot electrons depend on the intensity of the near-field enhancement for a determined incident light wavelength. To regulate the overall response of the LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis system, we can modulate the size, morphology and interparticle interactions of PNPs, and factors determining the frequency of the surface state electron vibrations.31,160–162 McFarland and Van Duyne found that silver nanoparticles had variation in the optimal LSPR response with various solutions. A linear correlation was revealed with the refractive index of the solutions.163,164 LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis is also dependent on the wavelengths and intensities of the emitting lasers. According to Yu’s report, the extinction spectra of Au–MnO2 iso-excited element catalysts displayed an apparent adsorption peak under a green laser region (wavelength of 532 nm). More hot holes were excited at the Au surface and captured the outer electrons of Mn4+ to improve the charge transfer (Fig. 9a).94,165 In addition, the nanostructures of PNPs play a pivotal role in optimizing the charge transfer rate because the superposition of PNP nanostructures might substantially promote the LSPR-induced electromagnetic fields.166,167 Liu et al. prepared strongly coupled Au nanochains with excellent HER activity, which was 3.5 times more than that of the isolated Au nanoparticles (Fig. 9b).166 The embedded nanostructure enabled the semiconductors to harvest strong local electromagnetic fields. As clearly depicted in Fig. 9c and d, an order of magnitude of improvement was observed at least due to the rapid increase in strength of the superimposed electromagnetic field. The high-intensity electromagnetic fields could be overlaid by sputtering a large number of metal particles (increasing the sputtering power of PNPs).162,167 Yang and Chen reported the colloidal synthesis of 2D WO3−x nanoplatelets (NPLs), showing ultra-high free electron density (as high as 4.13 × 1022 cm−3).167 As shown in Fig. 9e, the carrier densities were linearly proportional to the sputtering powers. This indicates that we may modulate the response wavelength for an optimal LSPR effect by varying the relative content of the semiconductor (i.e. carrier concentration). Given that Au, Ag, and Cu PNPs are not efficient electrocatalysts, excessive sputtering may result in a lower carrier density.93,167

5. Photothermal-assisted electrocatalysis
The photothermal effect is a direct strategy to generate hot phonons. It is, in principle, effective for most electrocatalysts. In this part, we introduce the phonon–phonon collision-mediated enhancement mechanism, which improves the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrochemical system by increasing the working temperature of the electrodes or the interfaces of the electrocatalysts. The origin of the photothermal effect will be discussed, followed by the influence of the catalysts’ structure and the electrolytic environment.
5.1 Working temperature-dependent electrocatalysis
The catalytic performance is affected by the working temperature thermodynamically and kinetically. As shown in Fig. 10, the thermodynamic potential for water splitting is temperature-dependent and linearly decreases with increasing temperature. It is 1.23 V at room temperature and drops to 1.19 V at 80 °C, which means that water splitting is more thermodynamically favorable at a higher temperature. From the kinetic point of view, a higher temperature makes the reaction more feasible as it increases the reaction rate. The chemical reaction rate (k) depends on the temperature (T) and the activation energy (Ea), which can be described by the empirical Arrhenius equation:  in which A is the pre-exponential factor, and R refers to the gas constant, which is equal to the Avogadro constant multiplied by the Boltzmann constant. The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction rate. The Arrhenius equation can be applied to calculate the activation energy of electrochemical reactions. FexNi1−xOOH, the state-of-the-art OER catalyst, has an activation energy of ∼25 kJ mol−1, approaching that of one of the best OER catalysts, IrO2. NiOOH and FeOOH have a higher activation energies of 60–80 kJ mol−1, in good agreement with their worse catalytic activity.168,169 Taking the temperature effect into account, the working temperature of water electrolyzers is set to 60–90 °C rather than room temperature. Higher temperature water electrolyzers were developed to improve the energy efficiency further, including alkaline electrolyzers operating at above 200 °C and solid oxide electrolysis cells working at 700–1000 °C.170 Though higher temperatures are desirable thermodynamically and kinetically, this is energy-consuming and might result in the attenuation of the stability of materials and systems. These issues are likely addressed by the interfacial heating driven by the photothermal effect. From the catalysis point of view, interfacial heating is applicable in boosting the catalytic process, as it exclusively occurs on the interface. The photothermal effect has been widely applied in the biomedical field for local heating or hyperthermia cancer therapy and water desalination,171–173 and has recently been introduced to activate a variety of (photo)electrochemical reactions.174–178

5.2 Photothermal-assisted electrocatalysts

5.2.1 Advances in photothermally-assisted electrocatalysts. 
Resembling the traditional thermal catalytic process, the photothermal effect brings favorable thermodynamics. There are unique advantages of electrocatalysis assisted by the photothermal effect: (1) additional heat-generating devices might be unnecessary, considering renewable sunlight can excite the photothermal effect and (2) the photothermal effect will bring a mild enhancement of the temperature at the catalytic interface only. Liu et al. reported the photothermal enhanced dual-functional Co3O4, which exhibited an extraordinarily low overpotential of 253 mV (at 10 mA cm−2 of current density), as well as good long-term stability (Fig. 11a).95 The Co3+/Co4+ oxidation peak (at around 1.38 V vs. RHE) was negatively shifted, facilitating water oxidation kinetics.179 The electrode temperature was elevated by 7.1, 25.3, and 38.2 °C, respectively, and stabilized within 60 s. This indicates that the laser power-controlled the photothermal threshold (Fig. 11b). On the other hand, the photothermal-induced kinetic enhancement could be partly attributed to a dynamic surface-reconstruction process.180–182 As a representative example, Gao et al. reported the OER response of NiFe2O4 (NFO), a spinel-like nanoparticle.99 They discovered a strong coupling of the electric-field and temperature distribution, which illustrated that the photothermal conversion generated the heat energy (Fig. 11c). The heat accumulation eventually led to about a 20 °C elevation in the temperature of the electrode surface and resulted in drastic reactant molecule activation. LSV plots (Fig. 11d) and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 11e) revealed that an active γ-NiOOH (amorphous Ni–Fe oxyhydroxides) phase formed (by the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+) at an anodic potential of 1.36 V, while this occurred at 1.41 V in the absence of light irradiation. The surface reconstruction was confirmed by HRTEM images (Fig. 11f). This work demonstrated the robustness of the photothermal effect on active phase transformation and reconstruction.

Carbon-based materials, including graphene, porous carbon spheres and carbon nanotubes, are efficient photothermal materials while hardly possessing any electrocatalytic activity. Electrocatalysts are semiconductors for many reactions, and can only absorb incident light with an energy larger than the bandgap. Hybridizing carbon-based materials with electrocatalysts has therefore been employed for photothermally-assisted electrocatalysis. Zhang and Cao synthesized an electrocatalyst which was tightly wrapped by carbon spheres, Co(OH)2/C, for the OER (Fig. 12a).100 As shown in Fig. 12b, the electrochemical performance of the Co(OH)2/C electrode was temperature-dependent. Under illumination, the carbon spheres collected light and converted it to heat to warm the inner electrocatalysts. The surface temperature of the Co(OH)2/C electrode was elevated by 11.7 °C under light irradiation, which was 6.8 °C higher than that of Co(OH)2 (Fig. 12c–f). Since carbon particles are a non-LSPR conductor and did not respond to photo-assisted hot carrier effects, the elevated OER current was attributed to the photothermal effect. This was evidenced by the slow current variation at the time of incident light chopping. Yu et al. designed a photothermally promoted nickel/reduced graphene oxide (Ni/RGO) bifunctional electrocatalyst.183 The activated Ni/RGO exhibited significantly improved kinetics. The overpotentials for the HER and OER both decreased by ∼50 mV, and it was durable. Likewise, a MoS2/C electrocatalyst exhibited photothermally enhanced HER catalysis under irradiation.100

5.2.2 Thermal and nonthermal effects: synergy and differentiation. 
With the advent of plasma technology, a synergistic photothermal–photovoltaic catalytic effect was proposed to optimize the kinetic, thermodynamic, and surface effects. During the nonradiative decay of resonant photons, hot electrons that cannot participate in charge transfer eventually fall back to the ground state, where the extra energy dissipates to heat. When exposed to a specific wavelength, heat is concentrated near the PNPs rather than throughout the electrolytic cell. This slows down the heat transfer.137,184 Wang et al. reported the plasmon-mediated electrocatalytic process for ascorbic acid (AA).96 Under light irritation, a significantly higher anodic current, as well as a larger oxidation peak, was displayed (Fig. 13a). This indicated more electron flow to the external circuit with the assistance of light. When the light source was switched on, the photocurrent of Au/GC in AA drastically increased in a few picoseconds. The fast response corresponds to hot carrier transfer.185 The current continued to rise and saturated in a subsequent relaxation process lasting more than ten seconds. This is ascribed to the thermal dissipation of the remaining energy, given the long-time relaxation (Fig. 13b). The photothermal enhancement partially decayed at higher working temperatures (Fig. 13c). This suggests that both photo-carriers and the photothermal effect contributed to the performance enhancement.

The hot carrier transfer and the concurrent local heating effect, represented by nonradiative relay processes, have been widely used in plasma-related applications, especially in plasmon-mediated catalytic reactions.186,187 From a fundamental point of view, it is necessary to distinguish the contribution of the thermal effect from that of the nonthermal one, though their synergy is electrochemically favorable for practical applications. The increased temperature may result in significant changes in the reaction environment, including the electrolyte acidity, active catalyst phase, and thermodynamic potential of chemical reactions, which may obscure the understanding of the nonthermal effect. Quantifying the thermal and nonthermal effects can promote our understanding of the LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis mechanism and the design of specific plasma nanomaterials and energy-efficient devices.188 For example, thermo-phonons play a significant role in promoting electrochemically favorable phase transitions. This understanding guides us to optimize the bandgap of electrocatalysts through doping, defect engineering, and other strategies for modulating the ratio of hot carriers to hot phonons.
Given the ultrafast charge transfer under illumination, it is challenging to distinguish the thermal effect from the nonthermal one.135 Conventionally, the temperature of the solution is recorded to trace the thermal effect using thermal sensors (thermal cameras or thermocouples). Electrochemical tests obtain thermally-enhanced performances at specific temperatures. The proportions of the hot carrier-assisted effect and thermal-assisted effect are calculated by simple subtraction. The rough temperature estimation at the reaction sites may result in a big error as the activity is exponentially sensitive to the temperature (according to the Arrhenius formula).189,190 A more precise approach has been proposed recently, based on the difference in the time constant between phonon–phonon scattering and electron–electron scattering (the main thermal/nonthermal effects, respectively). Zhang et al. designed an in situ measurement device and applied it to the catalytic process of CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 14a).189 An electrolytic cell with a quartz optical window was used. T1 represented the temperature of the top surface of the catalyst bed. The hot electron-driven near field effect occurred only in the nonthermal region.191 To evaluate the thermal effect, a vertical temperature gradient model was proposed:  in which T1 and T2 (bottom temperatures of the catalyst bed) are the two boundary values of the model, Ea is the apparent activation energy and Te is the equivalent temperature of T1 and T2. Te was calculated to obtain an updated thermal reaction rate. After finite iterations, the contribution of the hot-carrier effect was obtained by subtracting the thermal reaction rate from the overall reaction rate. For instance, the actual thermal and nonthermal reaction rates could be extracted from the relationship between the sub-reaction rate and light intensity (Fig. 14b). The nonthermal reaction rate followed a superlinear dependence on the illumination intensity (Fig. 14c). Later, Ou et al. proposed a more straightforward solution by translating the large difference in the transmission distances of phonons and hot electrons into optical response currents at a high time resolution.192 The hot carrier-driven photocurrent responded to illumination in milliseconds. Thus, a rapid response current (IRC) might be observed, expressed as an instantaneous spike and a sharp decrease in the photocurrent instantly when switching on the light source.188 In contrast, a much longer time was needed for phonon diffusion, corresponding to the slow response current (ISC).193 As shown in Fig. 14d, the IRC disappeared when the laser was moved to the plasma silver electrode above the electrolyte surface, far away from the average free range of hot electrons.194 The total photocurrent containing IRC and ISC was obtained with light irradiation at the reaction sites. The temperature gradient was greater, corresponding to the greater ISC under direct light irradiation.

5.2.3 Construction of a localized photothermally-assisted electrolytic cell. 
Significant achievements have been made in solar cells and photoelectrochemical cells, while much less progress has been reported for photothermally-assisted electrolytic cells.195–197 The photothermal loss is a big issue, in particular for large-scale cells.67,132 In principle, photothermally-assisted cells are more viable because thermal phonons can exclusively heat the surface of the electrode, in comparison with the conventional high-temperature electrolytic cells. However, this may result in temperature gradients and energy dissipation from electrodes to electrolytes.195 A threshold temperature is reached when a dynamic balance is built between the photothermally assisted photon–photon scattering and the heat diffusion. The subsequent thermal phonons are used to maintain the balance rather than further enhance the reaction kinetics. This leads to the inevitable loss of energy. The larger the electrolytic cell, the greater the photothermal loss.
Structural optimization of the electrolytic cell may significantly lower the energy loss. Ho et al. demonstrated a localized photothermal electrolytic cell, in which melamine foam (MF) was added between the cathode and anode to inhibit heat diffusion while allowing mass transport (Fig. 15a and b).198–200 The electrode–electrolyte maintained a constant temperature difference of only ∼5 °C under irradiation (Fig. 15c). Although MF slightly reduced the charge transfer resistance (<0.2 Ω), the localized heating led to higher conductivity and more robust charge transfer relative to those of the blank group (Fig. 15d). Unfortunately, there was a compromise between the heat transfer efficiency and charge transfer capability. The MF layers should be thin to minimize the charge transfer resistance, but otherwise thick enough to create a temperature gradient.

The design of local photothermally-assisted electrocatalytic cells is worthy of further exploration to reconcile the heat diffusion and charge transfer. It is highly viable to consult the literature on the structural design of solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and solar-driven interfacial evaporation devices. For instance, Wang et al. introduced a three-dimensional cup-shaped photothermal structure to maximize the light-absorbing properties of mixed metal oxide inorganic pigments/SiO2.201 The cooling cup wall collected the lost energy at the bottom of the cup via diffuse reflection or thermal radiation. Besides lowering the thermal loss, regulating the light-harvesting is also crucial. Cells with optimized structures should allow the access of specific light at a desirable intensity. Zhu et al. reported a unique natural structure of mushrooms for solar steam power generation, in which the mushroom’s black cap and microporous and hydrophilic fiber stalk could effectively absorb incident light and suppress severe heat transfer and thermal radiation.202 Xu et al. introduced cosensitized quantum dots (QDs) into liquid junction solar cells and achieved the utilization of the full-spectrum. When the CdS/CdSe QD-TiO2 photoanode and the CuS/FTO counter electrode were exposed to near-infrared light and UV–visible light, respectively, the enhancement factor in the power conversion efficiency was up to 15%.

6. Conclusions and outlooks
In summary, we have reviewed the recent progress of photo-assisted electrocatalysts for the OER, HER, ORR and CRR. Photo-assisted electrocatalysis is firstly distinguished from conventional photo(electro)catalysis by comparing their working principles. In photo-assisted electrocatalysis systems, light serves as an auxiliary energy to excite photo-generated carriers, hot carriers and hot phonons, which promote the formation of active species, the surface reconstruction or generation of active phases, the activation of additional active sites, and so on, to accelerate the electrocatalytic processes. Following this, the main body of photo-assisted electrocatalysis, including photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis, LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis and photothermally-assisted electrocatalysis, are summarized in sequence. The photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis addresses the issues of the low intrinsic conductivity and ion permeability of conventional electrocatalysts. The LSPR effect generates locally electromagnetic solid fields to release sufficient hot carriers, which can not only improve the catalytic activities but also modulate the selectivity for reactions like CO2 reduction. Regarding photothermally-assisted electrocatalysis, the catalytic reactions are enhanced thermodynamically and kinetically. In each part, the advances and the possible underlying mechanisms are presented to stimulate future development for the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts and devices.
So far, photo-assisted electrocatalysis has proven to be an advanced and powerful pathway for electrochemical reactions. Despite the significant achievements that have been made, there still exist substantial research spaces for the exploration of efficient photo-assisted electrocatalysts. Some challenges and prospects have been proposed for their future practical application:
(i) Reducing the recombination of photo-generated carriers
Like conventional photo(electro)catalysis, one of the major challenges for photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysis lies in the low utilization of photo-generated carriers due to the interfacial recombination of carriers. Inhibiting the recombination allows the shift of the catalytic reaction’s onset potential to approach the thermodynamic potential. Several possible schemes, such as constructing junctions and optimizing the interfacial properties, should be focused on, which increase the hole–electron recombination impedance. In addition, the defect and surface modulation of semiconducting materials are the other options. It remains challenging to enhance the optical quantum yield by inducing the directional movement of photo-generated carriers. It is noteworthy that photo-generated carriers can advance the inert/active phase transition of transition metal oxides and hydroxides (e.g., LDHs) at low potentials, bringing about enhanced electrocatalytic performance. This principle seems applicable for some other photo-assisted electrocatalysts, as electro/photocatalysts in specific oxidation states exhibit superb catalytic activity.
(ii) LSPR-assisted direct mechanism for chemical selectivity
The major challenge for the electrochemical CRR is suppressing various by-products while increasing the output of the target products. LSPR-assisted electrocatalysis through a direct charge transfer mechanism or indirect–direct conversion mechanism holds great promise for high selectivity. It appears that the excited PNPs can adsorb intermediates selectively. However, a plausible mechanism is still under dispute. More research attention should be paid to the fundamental understanding of the improved selectivity, which in turn can direct the rational design of efficient LSPR-assisted electrocatalysts. Modulating the surface electronic states of PNPs should be a promising strategy to lower the adsorption energy barrier and activate the direct charge transfer mechanism.
(iii) Distinguishing the contribution of each component in LSPR-assisted systems
The complex excitation–decay process makes it difficult to precisely understand the mechanism of the LSPR effect for a specific reaction. Electrochemical methods for distinguishing the thermal/nonthermal effects remain controversial. The trigger of the exciton mechanism in direct/indirect charge transfer LSPR is under debate. To elucidate this, quantum chemical calculations, spectroscopic analyses, and isotope experiments may be feasible to understand the behavior and mechanism in LSPR-assisted systems. This is essential for the design and prediction of high-performance catalysts.
(iv) Long-term stability of photothermally-assisted electrocatalysts
Long-term stability is pivotal for the practical application of photothermally-assisted electrocatalysts. The temperature threshold is set as a dynamic balance is reached between photothermally-assisted photon–photon scattering and heat diffusion. High temperatures may cause the aggregation of powder catalysts, irreversible phase transformation, material degradation, and ion permeability loss, which weaken the electrocatalytic activity and durability (e.g., Ni(OH)2 may be wholly converted to inactive NiO for the OER). In addition, the high temperature may promote molecular thermal motion and molecular disassociation and thus inhibit favorable interfacial polymerization for unfavorable selectivity. Electrocatalysts that are 1–2 orders of magnitude more durable than the current ones are urgently needed for future commercial applications.
(v) Designing scalable photo-assisted electrolytic cells
Localized photo-assisted electrocatalysis is beneficial for the system’s stability, energy efficiency, and scale-up. The optimization of cell structures allows the access of light of a specific wavelength at an appropriate intensity. Few of these have been done to date. It might be more effective to consult the literature on the structural design of efficient light harvesting systems in solar cells and photoelectrochemical cells. In photothermally-assisted electrolytic cells, suppressing the photothermal loss is challenging. Devices and interface structures for high-performance photothermal water evaporation may be good examples for the design of photothermally-assisted electrolytic cells (see 5.2.3), since tremendous work has been done to suppress thermal radiation and heat convection in photothermal water evaporation systems.

Table Content:
Haoyue Zhang	Haoyue Zhang received his B.E. degree in 2020 from the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He is now a master’s student in Prof. Fang Song’s group in the School of Materials Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His current research focuses on the design and synthesis of transition metal-based catalysts for photo/electrocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction.
Fang Song	Fang Song obtained his B.E. degree (2006) in Materials Science & Engineering and his PhD degree (2012) in Materials Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Shortly thereafter, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Xile Hu’s group at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. In 2018, he joined the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. He is currently an associate professor. His research interests include electrocatalysts and devices for energy conversion and storage (hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, CO2 reduction, and so on).

 	Fig. 1  (a and c) Pictures of the concepts and (b and d) working models for (a and b) conventional photo(electro)catalysts and (c and d) cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysts in the dark and under illumination at no, low, and high external potentials for OER. The working principle of photo-assisted electrocatalysts (photo-generated carrier-assisted electrocatalysts) is akin to cocatalyst-assisted photo(electro)catalysts. Plotted by the authors.
