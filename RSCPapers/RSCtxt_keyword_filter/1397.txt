    , Accepted 18th September 2020First published on 18th September 2020AbstractIn recent decades, organic semiconductors (OSCs), which are lightweight, flexible, and have low processing costs, have enabled significant progress in terms of efficiency in the field of organic electronics [e.g., as active materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and semiconducting materials in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs)]. However, most OSCs are currently being processed in halogenated toxic solvents, which creates conditions that are hazardous to the human body and the environment. Accordingly, for large-area fabrication and commercialization, OSCs must be developed to show high solubility in environmentally friendly and non-harmful solvents as well as high performance. This review considers environmentally benign solvents and potential approaches for increasing the solubility of OSCs in relation to Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) and molecular design. It also provides guidelines regarding molecular design for advanced OSCs possessing additional functions, sustaining green-solvent processability, and superior efficiency.

1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have received a great deal of attention in recent decades due to their low weight, flexibility, and low processing costs.1–3 Specifically, donor–acceptor (D–A)-type semiconducting polymers (SCPs), which exhibit superior charge mobility and robustness, have been successfully developed for applications as active materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs),4–6 hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs),7,8 and semiconducting materials in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs).9 Most OSC development has been focused on improving performance [i.e., power-conversion efficiency (PCE) in OPVs and PSCs, and charge mobility in OTFTs] by optimizing energy levels, absorption wavelength, and intra- and intermolecular charge transport.10 However, most OSCs used in state-of-the-art organic semiconductor applications are still dissolved in halogenated solvents [e.g., chloroform (CF), ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), or chlorobenzene (CB)] because these solvents provide a favorable morphology for efficient charge transport. This impedes large-area fabrication and commercialization owing to the cost of solvents and toxicity to the human body and the environment.11 Accordingly, alongside high performance, high solubility in environmentally friendly and non-harmful solvents is also a priority for state-of-the-art OSCs.12
Accumulation of halogen atoms can be hazardous to the human body and ecosystems. Therefore, non-halogenated solvents should be the first consideration for green-solvents.13 Most of the reported OSCs for environmentally benign solvent processing are dissolved in non-halogenated solvents. However, most non-halogenated solvents used to process OSCs contain a benzene moiety (e.g., o-xylene or toluene), which can produce a severely toxic chemical during metabolism in the human body.14,15 Accordingly, aromatic solvents need to be replaced with non-aromatic solvents that do not contain a benzene moiety in their chemical structure. However, both non-halogenated and non-aromatic solvents can also cause reactions in the human body and the environment.16 Therefore, more recently, water, alcohols, food additives (e.g., anisole and 2-methylanisole), and naturally occurring compounds (3-methylcyclohexanone) have been used as non-toxic green-solvents for OSCs,17–24 and water is commonly considered to be the best green solvent in terms of toxicity and cost. Some food additives contain benzene moieties (e.g., aromatic solvents); however, these solvents exhibit low toxicity, and are non-halogenated, biocompatible compounds owing to their polarity, which makes them suitable for mass production.25 Such solvents are not harmful to the human body or the environment according to their material safety data sheets (MSDSs), as they do not have the symbols GHS05 (corrosive), GHS06 (toxic), GHS07 (harmful), GHS08 (health hazard), or GHS09 (environmental hazard). The exception is that they are classed as GHS02 (flammable).
To realize green-solvent processing for high performance OSCs, it is necessary to form a favorable morphology that provides efficient charge transport when casting OSCs with green-solvents. In addition, green solvents should afford sufficient solubility of OSCs (>10 mg mL−1) and have a suitable boiling point (near 100 °C). Green-solvents have long drying time, which increases OSC self-assembly; thus OSCs have favorable morphology for charge transport.26
Furthermore, to investigate green-solvent-processable OSCs, all processing solvents are analyzed using Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), which consider three factors: cohesive energy densities of dispersion (δD), polarity (δP), and hydrogen bonding (δH).27 According to the principle of “like dissolves like,” HSPs can provide the direction for dissolving the OSCs in certain solvents.28 Common halogenated solvents such as CF, o-DCB, and CB show high δD values and low δP and δH values. Non-halogenated solvents exhibit similar HSPs to those of halogenated solvents, except for slightly lower δP values. This is why many recent studies have dissolved OSCs in non-halogenated solvents. While aromatic solvents show high δD values due to π–π stacking, non-aromatic solvents tend to show lower values of δD. In contrast, water and alcohols exhibit low δD values and extremely high δP and δH, which can result in stability issues of OSCs when exposed to humidity from the atmosphere.29 Although food additives and naturally occurring substances exhibit δD values similar to those of the common halogenated solvents, they show relatively high values for δP and δH. This eliminates the aforementioned stability issues.20,22 Overall, superior solubility capacity and increased polarity are necessary to dissolve OSCs in these green-solvents (e.g., water, alcohols, and food additives).
First, due to entropic effects, OSCs with small molecular sizes show higher solubility capacity than SCPs.30 This difference in solubility capacity is attributed to differences in mixing entropy, as explained by statistical thermodynamics. Although small molecules increase the solubility owing to entropic effects, it is difficult to achieve high charge mobility, morphological stability, and effective mechanical properties owing to short conjugated length and non-entanglement. Second, bulky substituents in SCPs can reduce strong π–π stacking, which can result in enhanced interaction between polymers and solvents, which increases solubility capacity;31 however, extending the insulation portion from alkyl side chains can lead to poor charge mobility by inhibiting intermolecular charge transport. Third, increasing polarity using polar substituents in SCPs leads to strong interaction with solvents, overcoming strong π–π stacking. In addition, this allows for more favorable solubility conditions with green-solvents, with increased δP, to be induced according to the like-dissolves-like principle.30 Although there are advantages, this approach can result in stability issues upon exposure to humidity from the atmosphere owing to the hygroscopic properties, and an encapsulation process seems to be required for practical application. Finally, introducing an asymmetric structure in SCPs through random copolymerization and asymmetric substitution is a novel approach for increasing solubility capacity by disturbing polymer aggregation, crystallinity, and π–π stacking.21–24 Recently, ensuring low crystallinity has been reported as an effective way to increase charge mobility due to the low activation energy (Ea) required for the charge-carrier hopping state.32 Furthermore, as well as increasing solubility capacity, introducing an asymmetric structure can reduce the grain boundary, where trap-assisted recombination is dominant (Fig. 1).33 Accordingly, compared to other approaches, introducing an asymmetric structure can be considered to be a novel approach for increasing the solubility without charge mobility and various stability issues.
 Fig. 1  Reported approaches for increasing the solubility and asymmetric structure as a novel design strategy. 
Based on our research efforts, we suggest guidelines for ideal green-solvents and green-solvent-processable SCPs in various organic electronics in relation to molecular design strategies. Although strategies on green-solvent processable OSCs are mainly treated, these guidelines have the potential to indicate future directions for SCP research regarding green-solvents to ensure high performance, stability, and effective mechanical properties. This could lead to new future industry and improvements to the environment and life.
2. Properties of processing solvents according to HSP theory
Most OSCs are currently being processed with toxic solvents.4,7,9 According to HSP theory, the common toxic solvents show high δD values and extremely low δP and δH values. For instance, using Yamamoto-molecular break (Y-MB) theory with HSPiP software to analyze CF, o-DCB, and CB returned δD values of 17.8, 19.2, and 19.0, δP values of 3.1, 6.3, and 4.3, and δH values of 5.7, 3.3, and 2.0 MPa0.5, respectively.34 Since accumulation of halogen atoms in these solvents can be hazardous to the human body and to ecosystems, elimination of halogens is necessary to reduce toxicity during solution processing.13 Non-halogenated solvents have similar properties, but with lower δP values compared to halogenated solvents. These include, for instance, ethylbenzene (EBz) (δD = 17.6, δP = 2.3, δH = 3.0 MPa0.5), toluene (Tol) (δD = 18.0, δP = 1.4, δH = 2.0 MPa0.5), 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) (δD = 18.0, δP = 1.0, δH = 1.0 MPa0.5), ortho-xylene (o-Xy) (δD = 18.0, δP = 2.6, δH = 2.8 MPa0.5), and mesitylene (MS) (δD = 18.0, δP = 0.6, δH = 0.6 MPa0.5). As strong π–π interaction is induced in general OSCs, toxic and non-halogenated solvents with high δD values tend to cause high solubility of these materials. Aromatic moieties may lead to high values of δD, which is compatible with aromatic OSCs achieving high solubility. Although non-halogenated solvents are safer than halogenated varieties, the benzene moiety they contain, which can lead to metabolic issues in the human body, also needs to be eliminated.14,15 Non-aromatic solvents in organic electronics generally show lower δD values, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) (δD = 16.8, δP = 5.7, δH = 8.0 MPa0.5), carbon disulfide (CS2) (δD = 20.2, δP = 5.9, δH = 0.6 MPa0.5), hexane (Hex) (δD = 14.9, δP = 0.0, δH = 0.0 MPa0.5), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) (δD = 16.4, δP = 4.8, δH = 4.9 MPa0.5), cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) (δD = 16.3, δP = 3.5, δH = 3.9 MPa0.5), and (R)-(+)-limonene (LM) (δD = 17.2, δP = 1.8, δH = 4.3 MPa0.5). Due to the absence of benzene rings, the δD values of non-aromatic solvents are lower than those of non-halogenated and aromatic solvents. However, CS2 exhibited particularly high δD values owing to the existence of an electron-rich and easily polarizable sulfur atom and a double bond.35
As mentioned above, although non-aromatic solvents do not contain halogen atoms or benzene rings, the MSDS data still indicate that they can be toxic, and there are no certified safety reports on their effect on the human body and environment. Accordingly, alcohols are applied to create a more environmentally friendly process. According to HSPs, alcohols exhibit low δD values and high δP and δH values. Examples include ethanol (EtOH) (δD = 15.8, δP = 8.8, δH = 19.4 MPa0.5), 2-propanol (IPA) (δD = 15.8, δP = 6.1, δH = 16.4 MPa0.5), and methanol (MeOH) (δD = 14.7, δP = 12.3, δH = 22.3 MPa0.5). Although EtOH and IPA have the MSDS hazard symbol (GHS07), alcohols are known to exhibit low toxicity and are used as drinks and food additives.36 Therefore, these solvents can be classified as green solvents except for MeOH. As MeOH can be transformed into toxic oxidized by-products (e.g., formaldehyde), it needs to be classified as a harmful solvent.
Recently, food additives and naturally occurring substances, which do not have any hazard warnings, have been used as novel green-solvents without any issues in terms of hygroscopic properties.17,18,20–24 The food additives 2-methylanisole (2-MA) (δD = 18.3, δP = 4.7, δH = 4.8 MPa0.5) and anisole (Ani) (δD = 17.8, δP = 4.4, δH = 6.9 MPa0.5), as well as 3-methylcyclohexanone (3-MC) (δD = 17.5, δP = 7.7, δH = 3.9 MPa0.5) in the form of peppermint oil, have been applied practically for OSC processing.20,22 These solvents show similar HSPs to common toxic solvents, but with slightly increased δP values which can lead to biocompatibility in aqueous systems (e.g., human body) without toxic oxidized by-products.
Water (δD = 15.5, δP = 16.0, δH = 42.3 MPa0.5) is commonly considered to be the best green solvent in terms of environmental issues and cost. However, owing to the water-soluble properties and an extremely high polarity of these solvents, they can also exhibit hygroscopic properties. This leads to instability when they are exposed to humidity from the atmosphere, which considerably reduces their performance.29 Furthermore, OSCs should possess a remarkably high δP to dissolve in water, which is challenging to achieve.
Therefore, ideal green-solvents (e.g., water, alcohol, and food additives) are safe for the environment and human body, and it is feasible to process OSCs with an ideal green-solvent by modifying their chemical structures to increase polarity or solubility capacity, which agrees with HSP theory and the like-dissolves-like principle (Fig. 2 and Table 1).

3. Small molecule approaches
In line with statistical thermodynamics, small-molecule OSCs display superior solubility capacity to SCPs due to entropic effects (Fig. 3 and 4 and Table 2).30 In terms of ternary-blended OPV applications, Du et al. have introduced an excimer PTN to demonstrate intra-system self-absorption enhancement, and a ternary OPV with PTB7-Th and PC71BM led to a PCE of 11.44% during non-halogenated EBz processing.37 Intermolecular energy transfer is boosted through overlap between molecules and polymers caused by well-organized stacking of PTN. Moreover, the superior miscibility from the intrinsic properties of small molecules leads to improved stacking between PTB7-Th and PC71BM in addition to enhanced solubility, allowing for non-halogenated solvent processing. Furthermore, compared to the control devices, ternary blended solar cells using PTN exhibited better air, thermal, and light irradiation stability. The unencapsulated ternary OSC displays 76% PCE retention after 55 days of air exposure while the control device displays incompetency. This phenomenon may result from the superior miscibility of small molecule PTN in the ternary blended system. In binary-blended OPV applications, Farahat et al. synthesized a small-molecule donor (SMPV1) that could be processed in Tol, THF, CS2, and Hex, and the resulting OPV devices with PC71BM showed PCEs of 7.04%, 6.52%, 5.63%, and 5.56%, respectively.38 Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) affected the device performance via controlling the morphology of the active layer. As halogen-free solvents for SVA treatment, Tol, THF, CS2, and Hex were used. Tol- and THF-SVA led to positive effects on the efficiency, with values of 7.04 and 6.52%, respectively. The enhancement is attributed to the improved fill factor. However, CS2- and Hex-SVA treatment led to negative effects on the short-circuit current density. The significant differences depending on the solvents may originate from the morphology formation and phase separation due to the different affinities with the used donor and acceptors. According to theories regarding good and poor solvents, the different PCE values arise from the degree of aggregation and the resulting blended film formation. Wan et al. improved the PCE to 11.53% using BDTSTNTTR as a donor and CS2 as a processing solvent.39 They attributed this improved performance to the introduction of flexible thio-alkyl side chains, which lead to enhanced π–π stacking. Hong et al. demonstrated OPVs with a PCE of 16.1% in THF processing, using an alkyl chain-extended Y6 acceptor (BTP-4F-12) and PBDB-TF-T1.40 Due to the enhanced lamellar stacking of the acceptor (BTP-4F-12) with modified alkyl chains, improved charge transport was obtained in the corresponding devices in addition to solubility in THF. However, because the OSCs mentioned above were dissolved in toxic non-halogenated solvents and in both non-halogenated and non-aromatic solvents, it is undesirable to consider them as green-solvent-processable OSCs and use them for applications.

To obtain desirable green-solvent processed OSCs, Du et al. synthesized the hydrogen bond-inducing 3-(diethylamino)-7-imino-7H-benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]chromeno[3,2-c]pyridine-6-carbonirtile (DIBC) molecule, which can be processed in 2-MA as a green-solvent, and the resulting OPV using PTB7-Th and PC71BM showed a PCE of 12.17% with improved thermal and light stability. Hydrogen bonding improved intermolecular interactions in terms of efficiency and stability among the three components in the ternary-blended systems and increased solubility.41 In terms of application of HTMs in PSCs, the general spiro-OMeTAD can be processed in the food additive Ani due to the intrinsically superior solubility of small molecules.42 Therefore, the resulting PSC can be fabricated in all non-halogenated solvent systems with a PCE of 20.54%. The boiling point of Ani (154 °C) is comparable to that of CB (132 °C), which leads to similar thickness. Ani is directly applicable to the device fabrication under identical conditions using CB. Although small molecules are compatible with increased solubility due to entropic effects, there are few studies on a desirable green-solvent process, and it is difficult to achieve high charge mobility, morphological stability, and effective mechanical properties for state-of-the-art OSCs owing to the short conjugated length and non-entanglement. Accordingly, SCPs are considerable for advanced organic electronics.
4. Semiconducting polymer approaches
4.1. Extending the alkyl chain portion
Fine-tuning of alkyl chains is a representative design approach for developing green-solvent-processable SCPs, and can be divided into three methods: (1) extending the length of the carbohydrate-alkyl chains of a polymer; (2) modifying the polymer backbone to incorporate additional alkyl chains; and (3) increasing the bulkiness of the alkyl chains by substituting carbon with larger atoms (Fig. 5 and Table 3). As these methods hinder the intermolecular interactions between polymer chains, they increase the solubility of SCPs. Some existing studies have shown that longer alkyl-chain lengths in SCPs can enhance their solubility. For binary OPV applications, Zhao et al. found the alkyl-chain length in SCPs to have a significant impact on the blend morphology of OPVs.31 Increasing the branched alkyl-chain length on the thiophene units resulted in a face-on backbone orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport; however, the longer alkyl chains can adversely affect the domain size and purity of the blend morphology. The balancing of these two effects was shown to optimize the alkyl-chain length on the polymer backbone (PffBT4T-C9C13) for the hydrocarbon-solvent-processing system of TMB with 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) additive. The resulting OPV device with PC71BM showed a PCE of 11.3%. Rasool et al. employed PNTz4T-1F polymer and PC71BM for o-Xy-processed OPV, with a PCE of 11.77%.43 PNTz4T-1F-based PSCs showed suppressed charge carrier recombination and enhanced charge carrier mobility owing to the optimized molecular ordering/packing and superior interaction with PC71BM and interconnectivity between domains of photoactive material resulting from the alkyl-chain length. This also led to comprehensive improvements in photocurrent density. As the abovementioned OSCs were processed with toxic solvents, it is undesirable to apply them to large-area fabrication. For green-solvent-processed OSCs, Li et al. have synthesized a polymeric electron acceptor (PPDIODT) on an all-polymeric OPV with donor polymer PBDT-TS1, which resulted in a PCE of 5.43% in Ani processing.44 As PPDIODT contained a bulky alkyl chain on PDI units and a large dihedral angle between thiophene and PDI, it showed improved solubility in food additive solvents. The excellent photovoltaic performance results mainly from a favorable vertical phase distribution by reducing polymer aggregation.

Another way to improve the solubility of SCPs by fine-tuning of alkyl chains is to modify the polymer backbone to incorporate additional alkyl chains. Fan et al. reported all-polymeric OPVs based on PTzBI:N2200 and 2-MeTHF.45 They showed that insertion of a nitrogen atom (N) on the imide with an alkyl side chain directly improved the solubility of SCPs. With an optimized active layer thickness from 120 to 230 nm, a high PCE of 9.16% was achieved at 230 nm. Zheng et al. synthesized quinoxaline-based SCPs (PBQ-4F) containing a conjugated side chain with an alkoxy group.46 The PBQ-4F and ITIC small-molecule acceptors were processed in a THF/IPA co-solvent, yielding a PCE of 11.34%. Qin et al. have changed the ethyl–hexyl chains of PBDB-T to butyl–octyl alkyl chains to improve the solubility;47 furthermore, they inserted conjugated side groups into the polymer to improve carrier transport capability through the moderate aggregation effect (PBDB-BzT). Using THF as the processing solvent, the PBDB-BzT/IT-M-based OPV achieved a PCE of 12.1%. Ye et al. fabricated OPVs with FTAZ and IT-M by a sequential deposition method using LM and 2-MeTHF.17 The FTAZ contained a 2-alkyl-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (TAZ) moiety in the polymer backbone, which incorporated additional solubilizing alkyl chains with improved solubility. In line with the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ), the FTAZ and LM had a repulsive interaction that increased the domain spacing and improved molecular order, yielding a PCE of 12.5%. Zhao et al. introduced two non-halogenated solvent mixing systems, o-Xy/PN and THF/IPA, for PBTA-TF:IT-M-based OPVs. As a result of the spin-coating method they used, the OPV devices showed PCEs of 13.1% and 12.0%, respectively.48 More importantly, the blade-coated non-fullerene solar cells of a large-area device (1.0 cm2) processed with THF/IPA showed a PCE of 11.7%. The resulting PCE is similar to the performance of the spin-coated device processed with THF/IPA. However, a blade-coated device using o-Xy/PN exhibited lower PCE (7.7%) than spin-coated device (10.6%). Since the drying process in blade-coating requires longer drying time than in spin-coating, the different boiling points between the two solvents in the co-solvents (THF/IPA – 65/83 °C and o-Xy/PN – 144/325 °C) and extremely high boiling point led to a severe phase separation related to strong geminate and non-geminate recombination during the blade-coating process. Therefore, for large-area device fabrication using the blade-coating method, it is important to select solvents with low and similar boiling points. Accordingly, a single green-solvent process with a boiling point at around 100 °C should be recommended because of the complexity of selecting solvents. However, there still are no reports on ideal green-solvent-processable SCPs obtained by modifying the polymer structure to incorporate additional alkyl chains.
In addition, increasing the bulkiness of the alkyl chains by substituting carbon with a larger atom can improve the solubility of SCPs. Xu et al. have developed wide-bandgap SCPs (PBDTS-TDZ) containing 1,3,4-thiadiazole (TDZ) building blocks and thio-alkyl side chains.49 Due to the high polarizability and large electron affinity of the TDZ cycle, it can be used as an outstanding electron acceptor building block in D–A-type SCPs, and flexible thio-alkyl chains induce strong intermolecular interaction between polymer backbones, which can also improve performance. The corresponding PCE value of the OPV with ITIC when processed with o-Xy solvent was 12.8%. Su et al. introduced a trialkylsilyl-substituted side chain on the polymer backbone (PBZ-ClSi).50 The s* (Si)–p* (C) bond interaction of the alkylsilyl side chain helped to achieve enhanced VOC in OPVs with down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. The resulting polymer was applied in PBZ-ClSi/IT-4F-based OPVs in Tol, yielding a PCE of 12.8%. Li et al. have investigated non-halogenated solvent processing for all-polymeric OPVs using a siloxane-functionalized substituted polymer (PTzBi-Si) and N2200 in 2-MeTHF, THF, and CPME.51 The grafted siloxane-functionalized side chains in PTzBi-Si showed high solubility in non-halogenated solvents, with the resulting all-polymeric OPVs showing PCEs of 10.1%, 7.6%, and 11.0%, respectively. Owing to the high boiling point of CPME, which can provide extended drying time to form an ordered structure, the CPME-processed all-polymeric OPV showed improved results. With regard to OTFT applications, Wang et al. increased the alkyl-chain density in an SCP (PDPPT3-HDO) by incorporating a comonomer with minimized size to adjust the density and length of the side chains, thereby increasing solubility in o-Xy.52 The PDPPT3-HDO-based OTFT, fabricated using a bar-coating method for formation of aligned fibers, showed a hole mobility (μh) of 9.24 cm2 V−1 s−1. Using a single solvent in bar-coating methods is recommended in terms of the morphology and efficiency according to the abovementioned report.48 However, because all SCPs can be dissolved in solvents that are toxic to the environment and human body, they satisfy few green-solvent requirements.
Zhang et al. first proposed 2-MA processing to fabricate PBDT-TS1/PC71BM-based OPVs, which achieved an impressive PCE of 9.67%.18 The bulky sulfur atom in alkyl chains can lead to high solubility in 2-MA, and 2-MA provides good solubility for BDT-based polymers and a reasonable boiling point to form a good morphology. Although many researchers struggle make an effort to compensate the efficiency from increasing insulating portion through morphology and polarizability controls, extending the insulating portion from alkyl side chains still leads to poor charge mobility by inhibiting π–π stacking and intermolecular charge transport (Fig. 6).53 However, this approach is commonly adopted in developing green-solvent-processable SCPs due to its simplicity.

4.2. Polar side chains for high polarity
Increasing polarity by using polar substituents in SCPs enhances solubility capacity and increases δP by overcoming the strong π–π stacking of the polymer backbone. The dipole–dipole interaction from polar side chains is reported to be stronger (∼10 kcal) than the dispersion force (∼1 kcal) (Fig. 7a).54 Accordingly, it can overcome strong π–π stacking and interact with a solvent in solution state. Furthermore, according to the like-dissolves-like principle, introducing polar substituents in SCPs with high δP should be compatible with superior solubility in green-solvents because green-solvents also exhibit high δP (Fig. 8 and Table 4). In addition, dense π–π stacking and good contact on the polar perovskite surface can improve efficiency (Fig. 7b). In OPV applications, Liao et al. introduced a thio-alkyl chain with ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) on the polymer backbone (PTB-EDOTS).55 The polymer was applied to the OPV with small-molecule acceptors (ITIC-Th) in 2-MeTHF, yielding a PCE of 10.18%. The 2-MeTHF originated from furfural, a non-aromatic compound that is derived from agricultural by-products; however, it is still toxic according to the MSDS data. In addition to ETLs in OPVs, Wu et al. synthesized n-type water-/methanol-soluble electron transporting materials for OPVs by introducing an ammonium pendant group on a naphthalene diimide-based backbone (PNDIT-F3N-Br).56 The strong electrostatic interaction from the ammonium group dramatically increased solubility and polarity, with the resulting OPVs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PffBT4T-2OD/PC71BM/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag) showing a PCE of 10.11%. Although the abovementioned solubility capacity of SCPs considerably increases, 2-MeTHF and MeOH cannot be considered for a green-solvent process. Accordingly, in active materials in OPVs, Kim et al. have reported oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chain-based materials (PPDT2FBT-A and PC61BO12) where the oxygen atom in the alkyl chain induces the dipole moment owing to electronegativity.19 Because the substitution of OEG side chains increased the polarity of materials, the materials could be processed in a co-solvent consisting of water and EtOH; the resulting OPV showed a PCE of 2.05% with reasonable stability. Although this study is valuable to confirm the possibility for water-processable OPVs, the stability issues still need to be resolved for practical applications. Accordingly, food additives and naturally occurring compounds, which have lower δP and hygroscopic properties than water, were used to enhance device stability. Regarding the application of HTMs in PSCs, our group reported two types of triethyleneglycol (TEG)-substituted HTMs (thiophenyl-PTEG and alkoxy-PTEG) (Fig. 7c).20 The hydrophilic TEG side chain increased the solubility and polarity compared to the control polymers (POR and alkoxy-PC8). The PSC using thiophenyl-PTEG showed a PCE of 19.9% in CB, in which thiophenyl-PTEG showed enhanced solubility compared with the control group (POR), but only dissolved in CB due to strong polymer–polymer interaction arising from the thiophenyl side chain. The PSC using alkoxy-PTEG exhibited PCEs of 21.2% in the food additive (2-MA) and 19.9% in peppermint oil (3-MC). Since alkoxy-PTEG consists of flexible and polar alkoxy side chains, unlike thiophenyl-PTEG, this polymer dramatically increases solubility capacity due to the effect of TEG side chains. Although the approach of increasing polarity by introducing a polar side chain is a simple approach to green-solvent processing, it can result in stability issues upon exposure to humidity from the atmosphere owing to the hygroscopic properties, and the encapsulation process seems to be required for practical applications.

4.3. Asymmetric structure
Introducing an asymmetric structure, which originated from random copolymerization and asymmetric substitution in SCPs, is a novel approach to increase solubility by suppressing polymer aggregation, crystallinity, and π–π stacking (Fig. 9 and Table 5). Compared with previous approaches, such as small-molecule OSCs, bulky side chains, and polar side chains, an asymmetric structure sustains conjugated length, charge mobility, lower insulating portion from the alkyl chain, and hydrophobicity for stability.32 Furthermore, because low crystallinity can result in solubility capacity with increased charge mobility due to low Ea required for the charge-carrier hopping state, and trap-assisted recombination can be reduced by minimizing the grain boundary of the crystal surface,57 the asymmetric structure approach becomes a novel approach for both green-solvent processing and efficiency.

Asymmetric structures can be induced by asymmetric substitution in monomeric units and random copolymerization in repeating units in the polymer backbone sequence. In OPV applications, Ji et al. synthesized a regiorandom SCP (PDPPMT-2T) using a monomer with one thiophene side and one methylthiophene side, where the sequence isomerism gave rise to an asymmetric structure in the polymer chain, increasing solubility.58 The OPVs with PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 6.5% in Tol and 2% diphenyl ether (DPE). In addition, μh of 12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained in the OTFT application in an identical solvent mixture. The enhanced high-mobility and efficiency originate from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) through a conjugated backbone and occasional intermolecular charge hopping through short π–π stacking (inter-junction) from short range aggregation and small crystal domains.57 The random copolymerization using methylthiophene breaks the symmetry of the polymer structure in sequence isomerism, which leads to a low crystalline polymer. Compared to control PDPPTT-2T without methyl chains, PDPPMT-2T exhibited enhanced aggregation in the amorphous regions, indicating higher mobility and efficiency. Similarly, Park et al. synthesized a regiorandom SCP (3MT-Th) using asymmetric 3-methyl thiophene carboxylate, where asymmetricity existed in the thiophene moiety.59 The polymer was dissolved in Tol, MS, and o-Xy, and the resulting OPVs with ITIC showed PCEs of 9.73%, 3.65%, and 7.13%, respectively. Liao et al. synthesized PffBT-2TPF4-9/1 using random copolymerization to weaken the strong self-aggregation, and the resulting random polymer exhibited high solubility in TMB.60 The resulting OPV with PC61BM gave a PCE of 9.91%. Furthermore, An et al. investigated a random copolymer (PBDT-S-2TC), which they processed in TMB, resulting in an OPV with ITIC showing a PCE of 9.55%.61 Although introducing an asymmetric structure is a novel approach to increase solubility, many reported studies used toxic solvents for device processing. To improve the green solvent processibility of OSCs, novel green-solvents having similar HSPs to the abovementioned non-halogenated solvents should be selected with an asymmetric structure.
Our group focused on the green-solvent process using an asymmetric structure. We have reported two SCPs for the OPV application. First, PffBT-RT4 was synthesized using random copolymerization and showed high solubility in 2-MA.21 The resulting OPVs with PC71BM showed PCEs of 7.23% in a conventional OPV on glass and 5.44% in a flexible OPV. The reduced crystallinity enhanced the flexibility of the polymer film as well as its solubility capacity. Second, P2FBTT-Br was synthesized using a combination of asymmetric substitution and random copolymerization to maximize reduction of strong self-aggregation.24 In addition, a cross-linkable functional group (bromide) was introduced on one side of the asymmetric substituted chain, as cross-linking can enhance thermal stability by fixing the morphology to prevent morphological degradation against heat. The ternary OPV with PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, and cross-linked P2FBTT-Br exhibited a PCE of 9.4% in 2-MA, showing superior thermal stability (burn-in loss). Recently, thermally stable devices have attracted attention for commercialization. Ma et al. have reported all-polymer solar cells.62 Although high thermal stability can be achieved owing to lower molecular dynamics than small molecules, it is hard to obtain high efficiency owing to miscibility issues. Accordingly, cross-linking is one of the solutions for thermal stability. Our group also investigated the HTMs in PSCs in relation to the asymmetric structure. To increase solubility, TTB-TTQ was synthesized on a random copolymerization basis, showing higher solubility in CB and lower crystallinity than the control polymer (TTB).63 The resulting PSCs with dopants (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (t-BP)) showed a PCE of 14.1%. Next, by tailing HOMO levels and μh through changing the moieties in the modified SCPs (RCP), the PCE of the PSCs increased to 17.3% in dopant-free and CB systems.64 Although the control homopolymers (POR) showed extremely low solubility in CB, the two random SCPs dissolved in CB due to strong polymer aggregation resulting from the intrinsic monomer properties. Accordingly, asy-PBTBDT was synthesized by introducing asymmetric substitution and alkoxy side chains in a benzothiadiazole (BT) moiety.22 Sequence isomerism from the asymmetric substitution increased solubility in 2-MA, reducing polymer aggregation and crystallinity. The resulting PSCs showed PCEs of 18.3% without dopants and 20.0% with dopants in a green-solvent (2-MA) for the first time (Fig. 10). In addition to application in PSCs, the asy-PBTBDT showed a PCE of 5.7% when applied in an OPV with PC71BM in 2-MA.23 According to P2FBTT-Br and asy-PBTBDT studies, additional functions and optimized properties can be easily introduced into SCPs with high performance and solubility using asymmetric substitution and random copolymerization for advanced organic electronics. This approach sustains the advantages of polymeric materials such as long conjugated chain, charge mobility, small number of insulating alkyl chains, and hydrophobicity for stability.

5. Advanced OSCs with high performance, solubility, mechanical stability, and thermal stability
Beyond the high efficiency of green-solvents in organic electronics, additional functions and optimized properties need to be easily incorporated into OSCs to sustain high performance and solubility for advanced organic electronics (Fig. 11). For instance, first, PffBT-RT4 using random copolymerization can improve flexibility; thus, OPVs showed superior flexibility in a bending test with a bending radius of 4.5 mm over 100 cycles (PCEs of 5.44% pre-test and 5.29% post-test) to the control homopolymer (PCEs of 5.49% pre-test and 0.87% post-test). This superior performance is due to the reduced brittle crystal and the resulting low glass-transition temperature (Tg), in addition to high performance and the use of a green-solvent, which suggests the potential for stretchable organic electronics with low Tg and cross-linking requirements.21 Second, P2FBTT-Br using a bromide alkyl chain in asymmetric substitution can lead to UV cross linking to prevent morphology degradation, increasing thermal stability (retaining 90.8% of the initial PCE) compared to the control group (retaining 67.1% of the initial PCE), in addition to high performance and use of a green-solvent.24 Thermal stability from heat and light is a critical factor for commercializing organic electronics. Accordingly, introducing an asymmetric structure with additional functions by asymmetric substitution and random copolymerization is a promising approach for producing advanced OSCs where high performance, solubility, and mechanical and thermal stability are required. In addition, Wojciechowski et al. have solved this issue on integral films in multilayer solution processing using cross-linked fullerene layers as ETLs in n–i–p-type perovskite solar cells.65 As low molecular weight fullerene exhibits high solubility in organic solvents owing to the entropic effect, the perovskite precursor solution cannot be deposited on the fullerene layer, which limits the n–i–p type architecture. Cross-linking can lead to stability in sequential perovskite–precursor solutions, which enables the deposition of integral films to achieve challenging device architectures. In addition to green-solvents and molecular design of green-solvent-processable OSC, additional functions and optimized properties are necessary for advanced organic electronics, sustaining high performance, and green-solvent processability (Fig. 12).

6. Summary and perspectives
This review systematically discussed processing solvents and the chemical structure of OSCs in terms of the environmental friendliness of the process. Although reported green-solvents are commonly classified according to the existence of halogen atoms, they can be divided into toxic non-halogenated, toxic non-aromatic, water, alcohols, and food additives. Ideal green-solvents include water, alcohols, and food additives owing to the absence of toxicity to the human body and environment. In terms of molecular design strategies for OSCs, designated ideal green-solvents have higher polarity than common toxic solvents in relation to HSP theory. Accordingly, molecular design will increase polarity and solubility capacity. The small molecule approach and SCPs with extended side chain portions, polar side chains, and an asymmetric structure were chosen for environmentally friendly processes. Particularly, introducing an asymmetric structure can be considered as a novel approach for increasing solubility without charge mobility and various stability issues compared to other approaches. We believe that efforts toward producing an environmentally friendly process will contribute to the development and commercialization of organic electronics such as organic solar cells, organic interlayers, and organic light-emitting and field-effect transistors. Furthermore, future directions for OSC research should focus on mechanical properties for flexible and stretchable applications and thermal stability for burn-in loss, alongside the use of green-solvents and high performance. Such research and the field of advanced organic electronics can promise new future industry and better environment and life. Here, we suggest the three most promising future directions to further promote the study, development, and application of OSCs in organic electronics.
(1) Ideal processing solvents should have not only a suitable boiling point (near 100 °C) to provide reasonable drying time to increase OSC self-assembly with regard to device performance but must also be safe to the environment and human body. According to reported studies, only water, alcohols, and food additives satisfy all requirements. As the HSPs of ideal green-solvents are calculated to have higher δP than those of common halogenated solvents (CB, o-DCB, and CF), future green-solvents will have higher δP (compared to common toxic solvents) in the 3D HSP plot. Accordingly, to identify novel green-solvents, the critical criteria (certified safety and boiling point) for ideal green-solvents should be considered, preferably by searching in the reported green region in the 3D HSP plot. Furthermore, because water is considered to be the best green-solvent in terms of toxicity and cost, novel chemical structures should be designed and optimized to resolve the stability issues of water-processable OSCs.
(2) As the suggested ideal green-solvents in the 3D HSP plot are located at an increased δP position compared to common toxic solvents, future OSCs should exhibit higher δP and solubility capacity (Ro). However, previous approaches had challenges. The first challenge is the suppressed charge transport from short conjugated length and extended insulating portion. The second challenge is the stability issues owing to the entropic effect of small molecules and hygroscopic properties of the polar chain. Therefore, future molecular design strategies should be considered. The asymmetric structure with controlled polar chains in SCPs may be a promising approach because strategies can be applied to the robust polymeric system, and there are no issues with charge transport and stability, which considerably increases the solubility. This approach may satisfy all requirements for the suggested ideal green-solvents.
(3) In addition to green-solvents and molecular design of green-solvent-processable OSCs, additional functions and optimized properties are essential for advanced organic electronics to sustain high performance and green-solvent processability. For wearable devices, mechanical stability (e.g., flexibility and stretchability) is essential. Therefore, reducing the brittle crystalline region, decreasing Tg, and cross-linking properties are critical requirements to obtain softness and ductility. For thermal stability, long-range segmental motion should be suppressed against morphological degradation by fixing the film morphology. As dense cross-linking is one of the solutions to fix molecular dynamics, incorporating cross-linking agents or functional groups into the OSC system needs to be considered.
