    , Accepted 24th May 2017First published on 24th May 2017AbstractThree novel triarylamine derivatives (TPACs: TPAC0M, TPAC2M and TPAC3M), sharing the same conjugation scaffold but possessing different numbers of methoxy units, were designed for high performance hole transport materials (HTMs) of p–i–n planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Cyclic voltammetry and absorption results showed that their energy levels would be beneficial to work as HTMs of PSCs, and time-resolved photoluminescence and transient photo-voltage studies proved that TPAC-based PSCs had better charge extraction and more suppressed non-radiative recombination properties than PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, leading to superior power conversion efficiency (PCE). We confirmed that the methoxy units introduced to the triarylamine derivatives did not cause noticeable changes in their optical properties, such as absorption and bandgap, electrical conductance, measured by conductive atomic force microscopy, and mobility, but the charge extraction and recombination behaviors of TPAC-based PSCs could be improved by increasing the number of methoxy units in the arylamine moiety. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that methoxy units could act as a Lewis base passivating the defect sites at the interface between HTM and perovskite, consequently resulting in an increase of their PCE to 17.54% without any dopants.
Introduction
Organic semiconductors have been intensively investigated, as a potential candidate, to replace inorganic semiconductors or conductors, because of their unlimited modification ability and intrinsically flexible characteristics. Especially, exhaustive explorations on the charge transfer mechanism in organic semiconductors have broadened their possible application areas, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1 photovoltaic (PV) devices2 and field-effect transistors (FETs).3 Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which utilize a perovskite material as the photoactive layer, have drawn great attention because of the relatively higher power conversion efficiency (PCE), compared to the PV devices adopting an organic semiconductor as the active layer.4 Perovskites are efficient light harvesting materials with bipolar transport properties and long carrier diffusion length, but it has been shown that organic semiconductor-based hole transport materials (HTMs), which extract holes from the perovskite layer and transport them to an electrode, could play a crucial role in high efficiency PSCs.5 In order to achieve higher light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency in PSCs, the organic HTMs should have an appropriate energy level alignment with perovskites and a good charge carrier mobility to minimize both electrical potential loss and charge recombination. For this purpose, organic semiconductors having strong crystallization behaviour6 or versatile feasibility of chemical doping7 were dominantly considered as effective HTMs in PSCs, because of their superior electrical mobility in comparison with amorphous organic semiconductors.
In OLEDs, triarylamine derivatives are predominantly considered as HTMs, because it is relatively easy for the amine atom to lose one electron and the resulting radical cation, a potential hazard for the long-term stability of electronic devices, can be stabilized by the resonance effect of adjacent aryl substituents.8 However, the inherently low electrical mobility of the triarylamine derivatives, due to amorphous-like characteristics, has restricted their broad application to PSCs, unless they are chemically doped to improve the electrical charge mobility.9 Since the chemical doping would cause potential issues, such as high cost, complicated fabrication and dopant-induced device degradation,10 devising a highly efficient dopant-free HTM is one of the inevitable demands to make further advancement of PSCs.
Meanwhile, most recent PSCs have either n–i–p-type or p–i–n-type configurations. Even though the highest efficiencies over 20% PCE have been reported from n–i–p-type configuration PVs, built on a thick mesoporous (mp) metal-oxide scaffold, their complicated preparation procedures and need for high temperature annealing hampered the extension of PSC technology to low-cost flexible devices that can be fabricated by a high-speed roll-to-roll process.4 Moreover, without the mp metal-oxide layer, n–i–p-type PSCs often display severe hysteretic behavior. Therefore, the necessity for high performance HTMs, which can realize p–i–n type planar heterojunction (HJ) PSCs by a simple one-step solution-process at low temperatures as well as those with long-term stability, is continuously increasing.
In this contribution, three triarylamine derivatives were newly synthesized and their optical and electrical properties were evaluated as HTMs of p–i–n inverse-type planar HJ PSCs. When they were adopted as HTMs in this configuration, the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached over 17% without any chemical doping treatment. When the optical and electrical properties of the synthesized triarylamine derivatives were explored, it was shown that the Lewis-base effect of the methoxy group at the triarylamine derivative backbone, analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth measurement, played an important role in increasing charge extraction properties and in reducing charge recombination, ultimately resulting in better device performances including the enhancement of short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc). In addition, the structure dependent charge extraction and recombination tendencies were systematically correlated with both time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient photo-voltage (TPV) studies.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Scheme S1,† we designed and synthesized three novel triarylamine derivatives (TPACs: TPAC0M, TPAC2M and TPAC3M) sharing the same conjugated backbone to which different numbers of methoxy units were attached. All triarylamine derivatives were obtained from a one- or two-step simple chemical reaction, and their structures were fully characterized by means of 1H-NMR and mass spectroscopy. When the absorption characteristics of the obtained TPACs were compared, they showed nearly the same absorption spectra both in solution and film state (Fig. S1†), reflecting an amorphous-like physical nature which is commonly shown in triarylamine derivatives.11 Introduction of electron donating methoxy groups to the triarylamine (TPAC2M) or carbazole (TPAC3M) moieties caused a slight absorption red-shift (15 nm) or little change, respectively. However, the introduced methoxy groups noticeably changed the molecular energy levels in the TPACs. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of TPACs were directly measured by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated with their absorption onset. As shown in Fig. S2† and 1b, TPAC2M containing two methoxy units at the diphenylamine moiety exhibited a relatively shallow HOMO level, rather than TPAC0M having no methoxy unit. The additional introduction of the electron donating methoxy group to the phenyl carbazole moiety did not significantly change the molecular energy levels, including the optical band-gap (TPAC3M). Based on the obtained energy levels, we could speculate that TPACs have sufficient potential to function as efficient HTMs in PSCs, because their shallow HOMO levels, compared to that (−5.4 eV) of perovskite, would be beneficial to extract hole from the perovskite layer and the shallow LUMO levels would effectively block electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM.12

RMS values of PEDOT:PSS, TPAC0M, TPAC2M, and TPAC3M on ITO are 1.72, 0.29, 0.30, and 0.26 nm, respectively. 
To investigate the performances of TPACs as dopant-free HTMs, we fabricated p–i–n inverse type planar HJ PSCs with the following configuration: ITO/HTM/CH3NH3PbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/ZnO/Al. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS, one of the most widely utilized organic conductors, was also applied as a HTM to relatively compare the charge extraction and transfer efficiency in PSCs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topological images of HTMs in Fig. 1d confirmed that the height variation of the surface of TPACs on ITO was within a nanometer, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of which was around 0.3 nm, much lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (1.7 nm). Therefore, TPACs could more efficiently planarize the rough ITO surface than PEDOT:PSS, and it is expected that their uniformity would not induce any morphological difference in the following perovskite photoactive layer. The optimized film formation conditions of TPACs were 20 mg mL−1 at 1000 rpm (Table S1†), resulting in thickness in the range of 40–50 nm (Fig. 1c). In Fig. 2a and Table 1, the performances of PSCs, which utilized newly obtained TPACs and PEDOT:PSS as HTMs, are summarized. All TPAC-based PSCs exhibited better device performances than the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, and in particular, PSCs with TPAC3M showed the best performance over 17% of PCE without any chemical doping treatment. TPAC-based PSCs also showed better stability than PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs (Fig. S3†). All J–V characteristics of our PSCs showed negligible hysteresis depending on scan directions, indicating the stable operation of each cell (Fig. S4†).

The enhanced Jsc of TPAC-based PSCs could have originated from the better charge transfer efficiency in HTM or/and the effective charge extraction from the perovskite layer. Since both PEDOT:PSS and TPACs have negligible optical density in the high photon-flux region, the most amounts of photocurrent could be generated from the applied perovskite photo-absorber after absorption of the same amount of solar light. In order to evaluate the charge transfer efficiency in HTM, we measured the electrical conductivity of the HTM in the vertical direction by conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), as shown in Fig. 2c. Interestingly, resistances measured from all HTMs showed almost a similar level (1–2 kΩ) and their variation was within the standard deviation, suggesting that charge transport behavior may not be a crucial factor to explain the improved photocurrent generation of TPACs. This was further confirmed by mobility values in the vertical direction measured using hole-only devices, which utilized the high work-function molybdenum oxide (MoO3) instead of ZnO to block the injection of electrons from the Al cathode, using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method at low voltage: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where ε0εr is the permittivity of the component, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the thickness.13 As shown in Fig. 2b, the measured hole mobilities from PSCs with TPACs were similar (TPAC0M = 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, TPAC2M = 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and TPAC3M = 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).
To examine the charge extraction ability of doping-free TPACs from the perovskite photoactive layer as HTM, we prepared quartz (Q)/doping-free TPACs (TPAC0M, TPAC2M or TPAC3M)/CH3NH3PbI3 samples and measured their PL lifetimes by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), maintaining Q/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 as the reference to TPACs. The PL decay curves of each sample were convoluted using bi-exponential functions and are plotted in Fig. 3a. Q/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 showed an averaged PL lifetime (τave) of 7.34 ns; a fast decay component, τ1, of about 2.1 ns and a slow decay component, τ2, of 12.1 ns. The PL lifetimes were shortened by applying a HTM to TPAC-based samples. Especially, TPAC3M with three electron-donating methoxy units showed the shortest PL lifetime of τave = 3.68 ns, compared to those (τave = 4.27 ns, τave = 4.98 ns) of TPAC2M with two methoxy units and TPAC0M without functional groups, respectively, indicating that TPAC3 shows about two-fold increase in the charge extraction rate compared to that of PEDOT:PSS, which is advantageous to achieve better photocurrent generation. The detailed information about bi-exponential fitting results is provided in Table S2.† This photogeneration trend is well-matched with Jsc values of TPAC- and PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs; TPAC3M: 22.79 mA cm−2 > TPAC2M: 22.58 mA cm−2 > TPAC0M: 20.73 mA cm−2 > PEDOT:PSS: 18.57 mA cm−2. The EQE signals of PSCs with TPAC3M and PEDOT:PSS are shown in Fig. S5.† From the PL decays and Jsc results, we could also conclude that the electron-donating methoxy units attached to triarylamine (TPAC2M) or carbazole (TPAC3M) moieties could play a crucial role in improving the device performances, which will be discussed in detail.

(e) XPS depth profiles of the perovskite-cast TPAC3M sample. 
In addition to Jsc, we explored the recombination behavior of photo-carriers in PSC devices using TPV measurement to clarify the Voc variation among devices. As we have shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, all TPAC-based PSCs showed superior Voc to PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, even though HOMO levels of TPAC-series are comparable (TPAC0M = 5.18 eV) to or even lower (TPAC2M = 4.98 eV, TPAC3M = 4.96 eV) than that of PEDOT:PSS (known to be about 5.2 eV). Moreover, TPAC3M having the lowest HOMO level due to the electron donating methoxy units in its conjugated backbone, produced higher Voc than TPAC0M without any methoxy unit in the same conjugated backbone. The Voc values of the devices are 1.00 V > 0.99 V > 0.91 V > 0.87 V for TPAC3M, TPAC2M, TPAC0M, and PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Therefore, we speculated that the recombination behavior of photo-carriers in those PSC structures, which directly influenced their Voc, would be different between TPACs and PEDOT:PSS and that it could be further manipulated by changing the number of electron donating methoxy units, attached to their conjugated backbone. To investigate the charge recombination behavior in actual device structures, we used the TPV measurement.14Fig. 3b shows the averaged charge recombination lifetimes (τn) from three types of TPAC- and PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs, measured with an increment in Voc. PSCs with doping-free TPACs as HTMs revealed much longer τn than PEDOT:PSS as a HTM in the entire range of Voc. Furthermore, the more methoxy units the TPAC conjugated backbone has, the longer τn TPAC-based PSCs have. The longer τn would be beneficial to reduce the recombination event and to increase the possibility of charge extraction in actual device structures. Consequently, the longer τn provided better performances of devices including Voc. The change of recombination behavior in the device structure in accord with the utilized HTMs is well-matched with their Voc variation.
The aforementioned changes in the kinetics of excitons and free carriers depending on the kind of HTM suggest that trap density at the interface between HTM and perovskite could be reduced by introducing methoxy units to TPACs. It has been reported that Lewis bases such as thiophene, pyridine and methoxy group could passivate defect sites such as under-coordinated Pb atoms on the crystal surface and at the grain boundaries, often generated during the annealing process of perovskites, resulting in decreasing the non-radiative recombination in perovskite films.15 In order to clarify if the methoxy group at TPAC2M and TPAC3M worked as a Lewis base at the interface between TPAC HTM and perovskite, XPS depth analysis was performed to directly investigate the interfacial chemical states. Fig. 3c and d present XPS spectra showing the O 1s regions of the TPAC3M-only sample and perovskite-cast TPAC3M sample. As for the signal of perovskite-cast TPAC3M sample, the perovskite/TPAC3M interface reference point (around 1.4–1.6 min of sputtering time), in which the high Pb 4f fraction of the perovskite layer significantly decreased (Fig. 3e), was firstly clarified, and the O 1s signal at 1.8 min of sputtering time was utilized for comparison with that of the bare TPAC3M sample. As shown in XPS spectra, a higher binding energy O 1s feature (around 538 eV), indicative of a direct interaction of oxygen sites as a Lewis base with possible defect sites such as the halide vacancy of perovskite,16 was clearly observed. Although TPACs contain amines showing stronger Lewis basicity than the oxygen of methoxy units, the amine atom of the triarylamine moiety is concealed by the three peripheral phenyl units. Thus, methoxy units attaching to the end of a molecule could have a higher chance to react with the defect site of the perovskite layer. This methoxy group effect was obvious when charge extraction and recombination behaviors of PSCs with the three types of TPACs having different numbers of methoxy units were compared, as we showed previously. As the number of introduced methoxy unit increases from TPAC0M to TPAC3M, charge extraction could be enhanced and recombination effectively suppressed, which provides higher Jsc and Voc to PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized three novel triarylamine derivatives, which can control carrier extraction and recombination behaviors in PSCs as a high performance HTM by changing the number of electron donating methoxy units, even without any dopants. By increasing the number of methoxy units in the arylamine moiety, expected to act as a Lewis base that could passivate the defect sites at the interface between HTM and perovskite, we confirmed that charge extraction from perovskite to HTM was improved and recombination in the PSC device was suppressed, increasing their Jsc and Voc. Consequently, the PCEs of p–i–n inverse type PSCs adopting TPACs as dopant-free HTMs gradually improved from TPAC0M (13.92%) having no methoxy unit to TPAC3M (17.54%) containing three methoxy groups in the arylamine moiety.
Experimental
Synthesis
All starting materials were purchased from commercial suppliers (Aldrich and TCI). Detailed synthesis procedures are summarized in the ESI† and synthesized compounds were fully characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass and elemental analysis (Fig. S6–S14†). In addition, the thermal transition and degradation behaviors of final compounds (TPAC0M, TPAC2M and TPAC3M) were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S15†), respectively.

TPAC0M. 
Under inert conditions, 9-phenylcarbazole-3-boronic acid (2 g, 6.97 mmol), 4-bromotriphenylamine (2.052 g, 6.33 mmol) and Pd(0) (0.374 g, 0.32 mmol) were placed in a round bottom flask. After adding tetrahydrofuran and 2 M of K2CO3 solution (48 mL/16 mL, 3:1 ratio), the mixture was vigorously stirred at 60 °C for 8 hours. Then, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and quenched by adding deionized water. After extraction with methylene chloride, the organic layer was collected and dried with MgSO4. The residual solid was removed by filtration and the solution was evaporated in vacuo. The final compound, TPAC0M, was collected through column chromatography (MC/n-hexane: 1:3) and consequent recrystallization from an MC/n-hexane mixture, in 75% yield.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements
Ag/AgNO3 served as the pseudo-reference electrode, ferrocene was used for calibration, and the supporting electrolyte was tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) in acetonitrile (0.1 M). The oxidation and reduction potentials of each TPAC series were directly measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, after preparation of solution in dichloromethane (1.0 mM).
Device fabrication
Acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and deionized (DI) water were sequentially used to clean the patterned ITO-coated glass substrates via ultrasonication. The ITO substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min before use to improve the wettability of the following HTM solution. For PEDOT:PSS HTM, Clevios PVP AI 4083 was deposited on the ITO substrate by spin-casting at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed using a hot plate at 150 °C for 20 min. For TPAC-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the TPAC0M, TPAC2M or TPAC3M layer was formed on the ITO substrate by spin-casting their solution (1:1 chlorobenzene and acetonitrile mixed solvent, 20 mg mL−1 concentration) at 1000 rpm for 30 s instead of PEDOT:PSS. After forming a hole transport layer (HTL) on the ITO substrate, the samples were transferred to a N2 box. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (Sigma Aldrich) and CH3NH3I (1:1 molar ratio), synthesized following the literature,4 in the solvent mixture of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3 v/v) for a total concentration of 1.1 M in a N2 atmosphere. The solution was stirred at 70 °C for at least 12 h before being used. Then, spin-casting the solution along with toluene drop-casting yielded a uniform perovskite layer.4a PCBM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was then spin-cast on top of the perovskite layer and a ZnO layer was added by spin-casting ZnO NP solution (Sigma Aldrich) on PCBM as the electron transport layer (ETL). Perovskite photoabsorbers, PCBM and ZnO layers were prepared in a N2 box. Finally, the samples were transferred into a thermal evaporator and Al (80 nm) was thermally deposited at a base pressure of 4 × 10−6 torr. Over 30 devices were prepared for each process condition. As for hole-only devices for hole mobility calculation, 30 nm MoO3 was thermally deposited on TPACs without a shadow mask instead of ZnO, and Al deposition through the shadow mask completed device fabrication with the following configuration: transparent substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TPACs/MoO3/Al.
Device characterization
A solar simulator (PEC-L01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.) with an AM 1.5 G filter was used to provide 100 mW cm−2 of illumination on the PV cells, with the intensity calibrated using a Si photodiode, equipped with an infrared cut-off filter (KG5) to reduce spectral mismatch. J–V characteristics were studied using an Ivium Technology Ivium CompactStat by scanning the J–V curves at a 0.05 V s−1 scan rate. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Jasco V760 UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer in the 400–850 nm wavelength range at room temperature. SEM images were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 microscope. TRPL curves were recorded using a commercial TCSPC system (FluoTime 200, PicoQuant). Samples were excited by using a picosecond diode laser of 670 nm (LDH-P-C-670, PicoQuant) with a repetition rate of 4 MHz. The emitted PL was collected using a fast photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant) with a magic angle (54.7°) arrangement. The incident angle of excitation pulse was set to be about 30° with respect to the sample. The resulting instrumental response function was about 160 ps in full-width-half-maximum. The PL decays were measured at the emission peak (770 ± 5 nm) for perovskite. In addition, a cut-off filter (FF01-692 nm, Semrock) was applied to block the remaining scattering and the excitation intensity was controlled using a neutral density filter set in order to avoid unwanted nonlinear effects. TPV decay measurement was performed using a nanosecond OPO laser system (INDI-40-10, Spectra-Physics) as a small perturbation light source and a Xe lamp (LS-150-XE ABET) as a bias light source. The devices were directly connected to a digital oscilloscope (DSO-X 3054A, Agilent) and the input impedance was set to be 1 MΩ for open circuit conditions. The bias light intensity was controlled by neutral density filters for various Voc values and the generated voltage transient (ΔV) by an attenuated laser pulse of 550 nm did not exceed 20 mV. All the films, utilized to measure absorption, TRPL, and TPV, were the same as those for solar cell devices. To investigate the conductivity of HTL, local I–V measurements were carried out using a conventional AFM (XE-100, Park Systems). The platinum-coated AFM tip has <40 nm tip radius for better electrical contact, and the force constant is 2.7 N m−1 to avoid destruction of HTLs. XPS depth profiling was applied to investigate the buried interface between TPACs and perovskite under the conditions of an Ar ion gun power of 2 kV and 1 mA on a raster area of 2 × 2 mm, yielding an equivalent sputtering rate of 10 nm min−1 of SiO2. All the binding energies of the XPS data were calibrated with reference to the C–C bond in C 1s (284.5 eV).
