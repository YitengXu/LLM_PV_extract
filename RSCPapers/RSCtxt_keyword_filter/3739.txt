Several lead sources have been used for the preparation of perovskites, among which lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2) is an important candidate. However, simply mixing Pb(Ac)2 and methylamine iodide in N,N-dimethylformamide solvent leads to poor perovskite morphology, which is disadvantageous for the device performance. Herein, we used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent additive to improve the quality of Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite films. We observed that using 5.0% DMSO could significantly enhance the crystallinity of the perovskite film with enlarged domain size. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the relevant perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was drastically enhanced from 12.88 to 16.59% (on average), with simultaneous improvement in the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor. A champion PCE of 17.06% with negligible hysteresis was achieved for PSCs prepared using 5.0% DMSO as the solvent additive. Our results indicate that using DMSO for the preparation of a Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite film is an effective way to fabricate high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Photovoltaic cells based on metal halide perovskites have drawn significant attention owing to their advantages such as having low cost, low weight, a simple fabrication process, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–7 As first reported by Kojima and coworkers in 2009, the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has improved very rapidly, with an increase in PCE from 3.8% to 22.7% within only a few years, demonstrating immense potential for the commercialization of PSCs.5,8–12
According to the morphology of charge transport layers, the structure of PSCs can be classified into mesoporous and planar.3,13,14 The main feature of the mesoporous structure, which was widely used in the early development of PSCs,15 is the use of semiconductor or insulator nanoparticles as a skeleton frame for electron transportation and upper perovskite film formation.16,17 The perovskite precursor solution can penetrate into the pores of the mesoporous framework and eventually form a continuously covered perovskite layer between the pores of the nanoparticles and the surface of the film.18,19 Recently, planar-structured PSCs have been actively investigated without the use of mesoporous materials, because the carrier diffusion length and carrier lifetime of perovskite absorbers are sufficiently long for efficient charge collection.20,21 Compared with the mesoporous structure, planar PSCs usually have a simple preparation process, rendering them more suitable for large-scale production, although their PCE is slightly lower.22–25 Both perovskite and charge transport layers are important for the performance of PSCs. For example, designing and modifying the hole transport layer can significantly improve the PCEs.26–28 Furthermore, perovskite films of PSCs were originally prepared using a simple one-step spin coating method.2,3 However, this one-step method is not easy to control and this method does not always yield a uniform perovskite film with high crystallization and full surface coverage, which leads to low performance of PSCs.29,30 To overcome this problem, many other methods for preparing perovskite films have been developed, such as the two-step spin coating method and the solvent-free evaporation method.13,31–34
The exploration of new materials for synthesizing perovskites is an important issue to boost the performance of planar-structured PSCs.35 Lead acetate (Pb(Ac)2) is a promising alternative source of lead for the preparation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in addition to lead halides such as lead iodide (PbI2) and lead chloride (PbCl2).36–38 Compared with the use of lead halides such as PbI2 and PbCl2, the one-step spin coating method using Pb(Ac)2 is very convenient for the preparation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The use of lead halides for the preparation of perovskites usually requires further complex operations, such as anti-solvent treatment (using PbI2)36 or long-time annealing (using PbCl2),32,39 which are restricted to large-scale commercial production.40 Moreover, Zhang et al. demonstrated that PSCs based on Pb(Ac)2 had a higher PCE than those based on PbI2 or PbCl2, with improved perovskite quality.36 Consequently, many investigations have focused on improving the performance of Pb(Ac)2-based PSCs. For example, Zhang et al. added hypophosphorous acid to a Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite precursor and improved the crystallinity of perovskites, with the PCE of the PSCs enhanced up to 16.20%.40 Tan et al. developed a thermal annealing free process for the slow growth of the Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite film and improved the PCE from 14.33 to 16.33%.41 Zhu et al. reported the use of trace methyl bromomethyl amine for controlling the morphology of Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite films. The significantly enhanced optical and electrical properties further led to a drastic improvement in the PCE from 14.26% to 18.32% for planar PSCs.35 In addition, a small amount of fullerene derivatives42 or PbCl243 can also be incorporated into the Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite precursor to enhance the device performance, improving the quality of the perovskite films. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) are usually used as host solvents for preparing CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursors.9,44 For the preparation of PbI2-based perovskites, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is frequently used as a solvent additive for improving the performance of PSCs.45 For example, Seok et al. added DMSO to a perovskite precursor (with GBL as the solvent) and used a solvent engineering method to obtain high-quality perovskite films for fabricating high-performance PSCs with a PCE of 16.20%.31 Park et al. reported that adding DMSO to a DMF-based perovskite precursor could significantly improve the PCE of PSCs (to 19.7%).45 It was observed that DMSO had a stronger coordination ability with PbI2 than DMF and GBL. The strong interaction between the sulfoxide oxygen in DMSO and Pb2+ in PbI2 can significantly retard the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, leading to improved perovskite morphology,44 which was also confirmed by Park and coworkers.45 However, so far, there has been no investigation on the use of DMSO in the preparation of Pb(Ac)2-based perovskites. Considering the convenience of using Pb(Ac)2 and the high performance of the relevant PSCs, it is very important to investigate the effect of DMSO on Pb(Ac)2-based perovskites for boosting the performance of PSCs.
Accordingly, we introduced DMSO into a Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite precursor for the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites which improved the performance of planar PSCs. As compared to previously developed techniques,35,40–43 using DMSO as a solvent additive is more convenient and effective for retarding the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, forming the intermediate Pb(Ac)2·DMSO during the process of perovskite formation. The DMSO molecules can be fully removed from the perovskite film after thermal annealing. We observed that adding 5.0% DMSO resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of the perovskite film with enhanced crystallinity and enlarged grain size. Consequently, the average PCE of the DMSO-added PSCs was significantly improved to 16.59% (original PCE = 12.88%), which was mainly caused by the enhancement in the short-circuit current density (Jsc, from 20.90 to 22.31 mA cm−2) and the fill factor (FF, from 0.63 to 0.75). The best PSCs obtained by using DMSO for perovskite preparation exhibited a high PCE of 17.06% without significant hysteresis. Our results indicate that the use of DMSO for preparing the Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite film is a simple and effective way for improving the performance of PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, P VP AI 4083) and lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O) were purchased from Heraeus Clevios (Germany) and TCI (Japan), respectively, and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Nano-C Inc. (USA). Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp (China) and Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd (China), respectively. Alcohols, chlorobenzene, and other materials for preparing the perovskite absorber were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd. (China).
Device fabrication
As shown in Fig. 1a and b, perovskite films were prepared using a simple one-step spin coating method. First, the patterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially washed with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaning machine followed by UV–ozone treatment. The hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass substrates at 4500 rpm for 30 s, and thereafter annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box for further processing. The lead acetate perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I and Pb(Ac)2·3H2O (3:1 molar ratio) at 40 wt% in anhydrous DMF without (0.0%) and with different volume ratios of DMSO (2.5%, 5.0%, or 7.5%). The perovskite precursor was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates at 4500 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The electron transfer layer of PCBM, which was dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1), was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Furthermore, the solution of BCP in isopropyl alcohol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the PCBM layer at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Ag electrode of thickness 100 nm was deposited by using a thermal evaporator at a high vacuum of 5 × 10−6 Torr. The effective device area was 0.04 cm2 (0.2 cm × 0.2 cm), which was defined using a shadow mask.

Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm2 (AM1.5). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100, China). The space charge limited current (SCLC) was obtained using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter in a dark environment with a bias of 1 V for hole-only devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Au. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the PSCs were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, USA). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were measured using a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Scientific, USA). The morphologies of the samples were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JOEL, Japan) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco, USA) in tapping mode. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained using a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980, UK). A Hamamatsu C5680-04 streak camera was used for observing TRPL. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis-NIR 3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at room temperature.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the fabricated planar PSCs with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 2b shows a dense and compact CH3NH3PbI3 layer with a thickness of approximately 350 nm, which is a standard thickness for high-performance PSCs.28,32 The J–V performance of the PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 2c with the device parameters (average values of 20 cells) summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The reference PSCs obtained without using DMSO exhibited an average PCE of 12.88% (with the best PCE = 13.43%), with Voc of 1.00 V, Jsc of 20.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.61. These values are similar to those of Pb(Ac)2-based PSCs in other reports, indicating good optimization in our experiment.35,40,46 For PSCs obtained using DMSO for the preparation of a precursor, the PCE was gradually improved to 16.59% with an increase in the amount of DMSO added to the perovskite precursors. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the highest PCE improvement of up to 27.3% (from 12.88 to 16.59%) was obtained when 5.0% DMSO was used as the solvent additive, with Voc, Jsc, and FF enhanced simultaneously. The best cell in this group exhibited a very high PCE of 17.06%, which was comparable to those of previously reported high-performance Pb(Ac)2-based PSCs obtained using other techniques such as the use of hypophosphorous acid and trace methyl bromomethyl amine.28,32 As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PCE of the best sample under the reverse scan was 17.03%, indicating a negligible hysteresis effect of our PSCs. Further increasing the ratio of the added DMSO led to performance degradation of the PSCs, with the PCE decreased to 14.48%. This might be due to the slow volatilization of the excessive DMSO in the film, leading to poor perovskite morphology, which will be discussed later. The IPCEs of the PSCs prepared using DMSO are higher than that of the reference PSC throughout the entire wavelength range as shown in Fig. 2d. The Jsc values calculated from the IPCE spectra are 20.65, 20.72, 21.48, and 20.61 mA cm−2 for 0.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5% DMSO, respectively, which were very similar to those measured from J–V characteristics (in Fig. 2c), indicating the high accuracy and good reliability of our measurements. Moreover, we also fabricated PSCs with a larger effective working area (0.12 cm2). As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†), the PCEs are only 1.8–4.2% lower than those of the PSCs with 0.04 cm2 working area, indicating high reproducibility of our experiment.

To determine the reason for the improved performance of PSCs prepared using DMSO, we characterized the quality of perovskite films using the measurements of UV-vis absorption, XRD, SEM, and AFM. As shown in the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 3a, it was observed that the light absorption of the perovskite films prepared using 2.5% and 5.0% DMSO gradually improved over a broad wavelength range of 400–850 nm compared with that of the reference film. Previous studies indicate that the enhanced absorption of the perovskite film may be attributed to the increased crystallization in the film,47 which will be analyzed later using XRD, SEM, and AFM measurements. However, the perovskite film prepared using 7.5% DMSO showed a decreased absorption over the short wavelength range of 400–600 nm, which could explain the decreased Jsc of the corresponding PSCs48 (in Table 1). Notably, with the addition of the solvent additive DMSO, the absorbance onset edge showed a slight red shift, as shown in Fig. 3b. This indicates the slightly decreased optical bandgap of the perovskite films, which facilitates easier electron excitation under irradiation.27 Therefore, the improved light harvesting of the perovskite absorbers by using DMSO is an important reason for the improved Jsc.

(c) and (d) XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films processed using precursors without (0.0%) and with 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% DMSO as the solvent additive. (b) and (d) show the zoomed figures of the dashed parts in (a) and (c), respectively. 
The XRD patterns of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3c and d, which confirm the effect of DMSO on the crystallization of perovskite films. In Fig. 3c, the peak at 12.5° arises from the (001) lattice planes of hexagonal (2H polytype) PbI2. The excess PbI2 in the perovskite film is believed to passivate surface defects, which is beneficial for the performance of PSCs.49,50 Other peaks are indexed to the crystalline structure of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite tetragonal.51 It is evident that the intensities of the (110) and (220) peaks at 14.1° and 28.4°, respectively, for the perovskite prepared with 2.5% and 5.0% DMSO as the solvent additive were much stronger than those of the perovskite film prepared without the use of (0.0%) DMSO as the solvent additive. Furthermore, the intensity of the (110) and (220) peaks reached the maximum when 5.0% DMSO was added to the perovskite precursor, indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite films.52 Further increasing the amount of DMSO (to 7.5%) leads to the intensity degradation of the (110) and (220) peaks, which might be the reason for the decreased light absorption (see Fig. 3c).35 According to previous findings, we speculate that, during the crystallization of perovskite, the intermediate Pb(Ac)2·DMSO could be formed, because of the coordination interaction between the sulfoxide oxygen in DMSO and Pb2+ in Pb(Ac)2. To verify this hypothesis, we measured the FTIR spectra of DMSO, Pb(Ac)2·DMSO, and MAI·Pb(Ac)2·DMSO. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S2 (ESI†), the wavenumber of the SO stretching mode in Pb(Ac)2·DMSO decreased, as compared to that in DMSO. This wavenumber shift was consistent with the fact that the SO bond was weakened by the additional coordinate bonding between the O atom and the Pb2+ ion, as predicted by our model. Similar peak shifts were observed in the previous studies using PbI2 instead of Pb(Ac)2,44,45 where the formation of the intermediate PbI2·DMSO was reported. In MAI·Pb(Ac)2·DMSO, the wavenumber of the SO bond further decreased because an additional coordinate bond between Pb2+ and MAI might be formed, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Therefore, the formation of the Pb(Ac)2·DMSO intermediate further reacted with CH3NH3I, which could retard the crystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and thus improve the quality of the perovskite film.
The surface morphologies of the perovskite films were observed using SEM and AFM measurements. From the top-view SEM image in Fig. 4, all the surfaces (obtained without and with 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% DMSO) of the samples showed good coverage by perovskites without significant pinholes. By using 2.5% and 5.0% DMSO, the grain size gradually increased as the average diameter increased from 200 nm to 350 nm, which is due to the improved crystallization, as indicated by the XRD analysis. The cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S7 (ESI†) also show the enlarged grain size of the perovskite film upon using 5.0% DMSO, while the film thickness increased from 330 to 350 nm. The AFM images in Fig. S5 (ESI†) show a similar trend as our SEM results, in which enlarged grains were observed with the use of 5.0% DMSO. In addition, the surface became much smoother upon using 5.0% DMSO, with the root mean square (RMS) roughness reduced from 5.7 to 3.7 nm. However, further increasing the DMSO amount to 7.5% led to a much rougher surface morphology, with the RMS roughness drastically increased to 10.5 nm, which is detrimental to the performance of PSCs.27

As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film prepared using 5.0% DMSO as the solvent additive showed a 40% higher PL intensity than that of the reference perovskite film, indicating the improved optoelectronic properties of the perovskite.28 Moreover, we observed that the PL peak slightly shifted from 772 to 778 nm, which is consistent with the results of UV-vis absorbance. The TRPL spectra in Fig. 5b show a significantly improved PL lifetime upon using 5.0% DMSO. With the bi-exponential fitting, the PL lifetime was enhanced from 51.4 to 69.7 ns upon using 5.0% DMSO, indicating the longer survival time of excitons, which is beneficial for the device performance.28,53 These TRPL results also demonstrate a lower defect concentration and a superior electronic quality of the perovskite film obtained by using 5.0% DMSO as the solvent additive, which is consistent with the slightly higher Voc of the PSCs prepared using 5.0% DMSO (see Table 1).49,52

To gain further insight into the effect of the use of DMSO on the improved performance of PSCs, we performed EIS measurements, which were conducted on the completed PSCs under the illumination of one sun. The equivalent circuit consisted of series resistance (Rs), overall charge transfer resistance (Rct), and chemical capacitance (Cct) of the films.53Rct is related to the resistance of the perovskite film and the interfacial resistances (PEDOT:PSS/perovskite and perovskite/PCBM).54,55 As shown in Fig. 6a, the high-frequency region (left part of the X-axis) of the EIS curve represents Rs, and the low-frequency (right part of the X-axis) region represents Rct.56 The fitting parameters in Table S3 (ESI†) indicated that Rct was significantly reduced when DMSO was used as the solvent additive for all the three cases (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5%, see the low-frequency region). The addition of 5.0% DMSO led to the smallest Rct, which was attributed to the fact that the improved perovskite quality with the use of DMSO is beneficial for charge transfer with the lowest resistance.47 The tendency was more clearly seen in Fig. S8 (ESI†), where Nyquist plots were redrawn in the low impedance region.

(b) J–V characteristics of SCLC devices based on perovskite films processed using precursors without (0.0%) and with 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% DMSO as the solvent additive. 
We also calculated the trap density (ntrap) of the perovskite films and charge carrier (hole) mobility (μhole) of the devices using the SCLC method under different bias voltages.57Fig. 6b shows the J–V characteristics of the SCLC devices based on perovskite films processed using precursors without (0.0%) and with 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% DMSO as the solvent additive. It can be observed that the J–V characteristic curves can be divided into three regions. In the low-voltage range (ca. 1.00–1.02 V), the current density increased linearly with the increase in voltage, indicating an ohmic response.58 In the intermediate-voltage range, the current exhibited a rapid non-linear increase, indicating the trap-filled limit, where all the available trap states are filled by the injected carriers.59 The voltage between the ohmic contact and trap-filled regime is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is determined by the trap states.57,59,60 Hence, the trap density (ntrap) can be calculated using eqn (1).60 (1)where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and e is the elementary charge. In Fig. 6b, the VTFL values of the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared without (0.0%) and with different ratios of DMSO (2.5%, 5.0%, and 7.5%) are 0.78, 0.65, 0.64, and 0.74 V, respectively. The corresponding ntrap is calculated to be 8.6 × 1015, 7.1 × 1015, 7.0 × 1015, and 8.1 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Using 5.0% DMSO for the preparation of perovskite resulted in the lowest ntrap, which is consistent with our EIS analysis. In the high-voltage range, the current increased quadratically with the voltage in Child's regime.61 In addition, the carrier mobility can be determined according to the Mott–Gurney law.62 The mobility can be calculated by using eqn (2).63 (2)
As presented in Table 2, the calculated μhole of the devices is 1.8 × 10−4, 3.2 × 10−4, 3.3 × 10−4, and 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the perovskite films processed using precursors without (0.0%) and with 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5% DMSO as the solvent additive, respectively. The highest μhole observed for the device based on 5.0% DMSO is due to the improved perovskite quality, which is consistent with our PL and TRPL analyses. The improved charge transfer (indicated by the EIS analysis) and enhanced charge mobility (calculated using the SCLC models), which are induced by the improved perovskite quality, are consistent with the enhancements in Jsc and FF of the PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the effect of using DMSO on Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite films and improved the performance of the related PSCs. The UV-vis, XRD, SEM, and AFM results indicated improved crystallization of the Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite upon the use of DMSO as the solvent additive. PL, EIS, and SCLC analyses further indicated improved optical and electronic properties of the Pb(Ac)2-based perovskite prepared using DMSO. The PCE of the relevant PSCs was significantly improved from 12.88 to 16.59% (on average), with simultaneous enhancements in Voc, Jsc, and FF. A champion PCE of 17.06% with negligible hysteresis was realized for PSCs obtained using 5.0% DMSO as the solvent additive. Our findings indicate that the use of DMSO for improving the quality of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is a simple and effective way for fabricating high-performance Pb(Ac)2-based PSCs.
