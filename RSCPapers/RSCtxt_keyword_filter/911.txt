    , Accepted 15th May 2012First published on 21st May 2012AbstractThis paper reports a new D–A–π-A organic dye WS-9, which is derived from the known dye WS-2 by incorporating an n-hexylthiophene unit into the π-conjugation. Due to the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit in the π-bridge, the specific D–A–π-A organic dyes show more complicated electronic transition absorption bands than traditional D–π-A dyes. The origins of the absorption bands in D–A–π-A organic dyes are analysed by density functional theory (DFT). The calculated results in combination with the deprotonation experiments suggest that the spectral response range of D–A–π-A organic dyes is superior to that of D–π-A ones. When employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the two dyes show a large difference in aggregation behaviour. It was found that WS-2 forms the unfavourable aggregates more easily. High performance of WS-2 strongly depends on the coadsorbent and suitable dye bath solvent. In contrast, WS-9 shows strong anti-aggregation ability, and always exhibits high performance regardless of the coadsorbent and dye bath solvent. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay experiments as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicate that the injected electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance are largely increased due to the introduction of a hexylthiophene unit, resulting in the high photovoltage based on WS-9. The optimized power conversion efficiency of WS-9 reaches 9.04% with high photocurrent (18.00 mA cm−2) and photovoltage (696 mV). The accelerating dye photo-stability was tested upon light irradiation of a dye-adsorbed TiO2 film in the absence of redox electrolyte, and a WS-9-based DSSC device with ionic liquid redox electrolyte. These results suggest that the structural engineering of organic dyes is important for highly efficient photovoltaic performance of solar cells, and our research will pave a novel way to design new efficient D–A–π-A organic dye sensitizers.

Broader context
Amongst various strategies for improving the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells, successful molecular engineering of the photosensitizers has remarkably contributed to the light harvesting and interfacial environment optimization. Incorporation of an electron-withdrawing unit into the π-conjugation to construct the D–A–π-A configuration organic dyes is a novel and special approach to broaden the photoresponse range and enhance the photovoltaic performance. In this context, we systematically studied a new D–A–π-A organic dye WS-9, solving the aggregation problem of the dye WS-2 through incorporation of a hexylthiophene unit on the π-bridge. WS-9 exhibits inherent anti-aggregation ability, thus showing higher power conversion efficiency in DSSCs than WS-2 regardless of the presence of coadsorbent or kind of dye bath solvent. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the injected electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance were increased for WS-9 devices with respect to those of WS-2. Our research indicates that the D–A–π-A featured organic dyes with appropriate structure modifications are promising in the development of highly efficient DSSCs.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been investigated extensively as potential candidates for renewable-energy systems.1 By using ruthenium (Ru) complexes developed through novel molecular design, Grätzel2 and Han3 groups have reported DSSCs with high solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies (η) of over 11%. However, ruthenium complex dyes are not suitable for cost-effective and environmentally friendly photovoltaic systems, because ruthenium is a rare and expensive metal, which may limit the potentially wide application of these complexes. Therefore, the investigation of DSSCs using metal-free organic dyes becomes very important from a practical point of view.4 Recently, numerous organic dyes have been reported for high-efficiency DSSCs. The most promising alternatives are indoline dyes5 (examples: D149, D205), porphyrin dyes6 (examples: YD2, YD2-o-C8), and binary π-conjugated triphenylamine dyes7 (examples: C217, C219). For the indoline and porphyrin dyes, the long-term stability of the DSSC devices needs more investigation; the main disadvantage of triphenylamine dyes is their relatively weak spectral response in the red and near infrared (NIR) regions.
As is well known, organic dyes with donor–π-acceptor (D–π-A) configuration are the most common among metal-free organic sensitizers.8 Generally, D–π-A molecules with short π-conjugation length only absorb short wavelength photons, while long π-conjugated dye molecules easily form unfavourable π-stacks9 and are not very stable when irradiated with high-energy photons.10 To further improve the performance of DSSCs, including efficiency and stability, it is necessary to remodel the molecular design of organic sensitizers. One of the new design concepts is to realize broad spectral response on relatively small and sturdy organic molecules. Along this line, our group has recently proposed a novel D–A–π-A configuration for the design of novel organic dyes,11 which are different from the traditional organic D–π-A dyes due to the incorporation of an additional electron-withdrawing unit in the π-spacer. The proposition of the specific design of D–A–π-A molecules was based on several deliberate considerations: firstly, the electron-withdrawing unit is usually a low-band gap unit, which is helpful to decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap of organic dyes, and extends their absorption spectra;12 secondly, the extension of absorption to longer wavelengths, introducing a low-band gap unit to replace a long conjugated structure between D and A, is beneficial for the photo-stability of organic dyes;13 thirdly, it is easy to realize long wavelength absorption in short and small organic molecules, simplifying the synthesis and reducing the material cost. WS-2 (Fig. 1),11 one of the D–A–π-A dyes, employing an indoline derivative as the electron donor, cyanoacetic acid as the electron acceptor and a benzothiadiazole as the additional acceptor in the π-bridge, showed a broad spectral response (IPCE onset > 800 nm), high efficiency (η, 8.7%) and good photo-stability. The WS-2 based device could be kept for a long time without desorption and decoloration. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of WS-2 is comparable with that of a standard Ru-dye N719; however, its open-circuit voltage (Voc) is unsatisfactory. The reason for this relatively lower Voc is that WS-2 possesses a good co-planarity across the π-conjunction, making it prone to forming unfavourable π-stacks, due to aggregation. This unfavourable aggregation may lead to intermolecular quenching or back reaction of the injected electron, limiting the electron accumulation in the TiO2 conduction band and resulting in low Voc output. Therefore, controlling dye-aggregation is an important issue for D–A–π-A dyes in order to obtain highly efficient DSSCs. Bearing this in mind, a novel D–A–π-A indoline dye WS-9 (Fig. 1) was designed by introducing an n-hexyl substituted thiophene subunit into the π-conjunction of WS-2 to retard the strong aggregation tendency of the latter.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of D–A–π-A sensitizers WS-2 and WS-9. 
Herein, we carefully study the differences between WS-2 and WS-9 caused by the n-hexylthiophene modification, including their absorption spectra, energy levels and photovoltaic performance. The aggregation effect of the two dyes was carefully investigated. The aggregates are formed during dye adsorption in the bath solution, and the types of solvents or coadsorbent have a significant influence on the dye adsorption as well as its aggregation. In this work, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and chloroform (CHCl3) were used as the bath solvents, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was added to the dye bath as the coadsorbent. The WS-9 based DSSCs system shows better performance than that of WS-2, regardless of the dye bath solvents employed and the usage of CDCA coadsorbent. Impressively, when coadsorbed with 20 mM CDCA, WS-9 based DSSCs showed remarkable performance (Jsc > 18.0 mA cm−2, Voc > 700 mV, and η > 9%). Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay measurements show that the apparent electron lifetime of WS-2 based DSSCs increases by an order of magnitude under CDCA coadsorption. In contrast, there is only a minor variation in the electron lifetime for WS-9 upon CDCA addition. As demonstrated, the introduction of the n-hexylthiophene group can significantly improve the potential anti-aggregation ability of D–A–π-A organic dyes, proving that a small chemical modification on the sensitizer structures can largely affect their photovoltaic performance. Our research indicates that the D–A–π-A featured organic dyes are promising candidates in the development of highly efficient DSSCs.
Experimental
Characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III-400 MHz (100 MHz for 13C NMR) instruments with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) was performed using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The absorption spectra of sensitizer dyes in solution were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) were determined with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode in saturated aqueous KCl solution; 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in CH2Cl2. Ferrocene was added to each sample solution at the end of the experiments, and the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal potential reference.

The new dye WS-9 was prepared by four steps of common chemical reactions (Scheme 1). The starting materials 1 (ref. 14) and 2 (ref. 11) were prepared according to the literature. Other reagents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. The detailed synthesis procedures are described below.

DSSCs fabrication
Dye sensitized cells were fabricated using a double-layered photoanode made of mesoporous TiO2. A transparent, 8 μm thick layer of 20 nm particles was screen-printed onto a FTO glass pane (NSG-10, Nippon Sheet Glass), pre-treated with TiCl4. Subsequently, a 5 μm thick layer of scattering particles (400 nm diameter) was screen-printed on the top of the transparent film and the thus formed electrode was sintered up to 500 °C. The TiCl4 post-treatment was done on the substrates in order to increase the surface area and improve the connectivity between the particles. The photoanodes were sintered once again and after cooling to 80 °C were immersed in the dye solutions for 6 h. The solutions contained 0.3 mM of the WS-2 or WS-9 dye with/without CDCA in CH2Cl2 or CHCl3. After rinsing with acetonitrile, the stained substrates were sealed with pieces of thermally platinized (a drop of 8 mM hexachloroplatinic solution in 2-propanol, heated to 425 °C) FTO glass (TEC7 Pilkington), which served as a counter electrode. 25 μm thick Surlyn served as a binder and a spacer. The liquid electrolyte of Z960 as well as ionic liquid electrolyte of Z952 was introduced into the cells via pre-drilled holes in the counter electrodes. A UV filtering foil (AKTOP, Mihama Co.) was adhered onto the front sides of the devices.
Photovoltaic performance measurements
The setup used for conducting standard photovoltaic characterization (J–V curve) consists of a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel), of which spectral output was matched in the region of 350–750 nm with the aid of a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH), and a source meter Keithley 2400 (Keithley) to apply potential bias and measure the photogenerated current. A set of metal-mesh filters was used to adjust the light intensity to desired levels. IPCE was measured using a similar setup; however, the incident light (300 W xenon lamp, ILC Technology) was focused through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon Ltd.). The cells were measured with an external light bias (10% sun) provided by a LED array. A metal mask defined the cell active area to be 0.159 cm2.
Electrochemical impedance spectra measurements
The complete devices were measured at a constant temperature of 20 °C in the dark. A sinusoidal potential perturbation of an amplitude of 10 mV was applied over a frequency range of 1.0 MHz–0.1 Hz (Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat) for a constant potential bias varied between 0 mV and 600/800 mV with a 25 mV step. The spectra were fitted using ZView software (Scribner Associates) using the transmission line model. The potential was corrected for the ohmic losses due to the series resistance of the cell.
Transient photovoltage and photocurrent setup
Transient decays were measured under varying white light bias (LED array) with superimposed red perturbation pulses (LED). A Keithley 2600 source meter (Keithley) was employed to record the voltage dynamics. Photovoltage decays were measured at different open-circuit potentials defined by varying the white light intensity. Cell capacitance was obtained from the integrated photocurrent decay measured close to Voc (varying the light intensity as well). Red perturbation pulses were controlled not to exceed 5% of the signal resulting from the white bias (either current or voltage) in order to maintain a single-exponential decay.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
In our previous work, we found that the D–A–π-A configuration dyes showed several merits with respect to the common D–π-A organic dyes.11,15 Especially, WS-2, with an indoline unit as the electron donor, cyanoacetic acid as the electron acceptor, a thienyl group as π-conjunction and a benzothiadiazole as the additional acceptor, showed extremely high photovoltaic performance after coadsorption with CDCA. To further improve the performance of this organic sensitizer, we specifically introduced a hexylthiophene group into the structure of WS-2 for the design of WS-9. The sterically hindered hexyl chain was expected to suppress the serious aggregation tendency of WS-2 on TiO2 film. The novel dye WS-9 was synthesized according to the synthetic route in Scheme 1. The starting material 2 is an important intermediate for preparing WS-2. After Suzuki coupling with the pinacol ester of 4-hexylthiophene-2-boronic acid (1), the pivotal hexylthiophene unit was successfully incorporated into the target system. As is well known, the introduction of long alkyl chains into sensitizer dyes can not only inhibit the dye aggregation16 but also improve the solubility,17 which is of great benefit to the synthesis and purifications. For further grafting of another thiophene unit, a simple bromination was performed on the reactive hexylthiophene unit. Suzuki coupling with the low cost and commercially available 5-formylthiophene-2-boronic acid resulted in the aldehyde precursor. Finally, the obtained intermediate 5 was converted to sensitizer WS-9 by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid by reflux in acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. The important intermediates 3, 4, 5 and the target sensitizer dye were well characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. The obtained WS-9 is dark red in the solid state, and can be dissolved in dichloromethane, chloroform, and THF.
Absorption, cyclic voltammetry and TD-DFT calculations
The UV-vis absorption spectra of WS-2 and WS-9 in CH2Cl2 solution are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption peaks as well as their extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 1. In general, commonly used D–π-A organic dyes show two principle groups of absorption bands: one intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption in the visible region and one local π–π* absorption band in the UV region.18 However, it is interesting to find that the two D–A–π-A dyes show three major electronic absorption bands in the UV and visible regions. It is worthwhile to investigate the origins of the additional absorption band, and to evaluate its contribution to the photo-induced charge separation. In addition, although WS-9 contains one more thienyl unit in the π-conjunction, its ICT absorption peak is not red-shifted but blue-shifted by 10 nm with respect to that of WS-2. Meanwhile, the most significant difference in absorption spectra of WS-9 and WS-2 is the band around 400 nm, where the former shows a 50 nm red shift compared to the latter. Obviously, the elongation of the π-conjunction does not broaden the ICT band but red-shifts the absorption band around 400 nm, evoking further interest in the specific absorption band. The density functional theory (DFT) is employed for further study of the absorption bands of D–A–π-A dyes.

To understand the origins of the additional absorption band in D–A–π-A dyes, and the variation in absorption of WS-9 with respect to WS-2 caused by the additional thienyl unit, TD-DFT calculations were performed on the B3LYP optimized ground-state geometries taking into consideration the solvent effect (CH2Cl2).19 Theoretically, the D–A–π-A dyes show three groups of absorption bands (Table 2): (i) the lowest energy absorption bands (S1 transition) for both dyes correspond to the HOMO → LUMO transition; (ii) the additional absorption band around 400 nm (S2 transition) is composed of the electronic excitations of HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO; (iii) the absorption band in the UV region (S3 transition) is ascribed to other high energy transitions, such as HOMO → LUMO+2 or HOMO−1 → LUMO+1. The energy level values, including HOMO−2, HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2, were further likewise simulated and are displayed in Fig. 3. The HOMO and LUMO levels of both dyes are similar, resulting in a nearly identical ICT absorption band at around 540 nm. However, the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 levels of WS-9 drift significantly with respect to those of WS-2 (green arrows in Fig. 4). Considering the upward shift in HOMO−1 and downward shift in LUMO+1 of WS-9, it is easy to understand that the HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO transition energies become smaller, resulting in the observed red shift in the absorption band at 458 nm.

Here, the up-shift of the HOMO−1 orbital can be cross-checked by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. Fig. 4 shows the anodic CV scans of WS-2 and WS-9 in CH2Cl2. Both dyes reveal two groups of redox processes in the anodic region. The first one around 0.7 V (vs. SCE, same below) corresponds to the HOMO level, while the second peak couple can be attributed to the redox potential of the HOMO−1 orbital. The second redox couple peak of WS-9 was apparently negatively shifted by 0.24 V with respect to WS-2 from +1.397 V to +1.156 V. To experimentally determine the HOMO–LUMO gap, namely E0–0, the cathodic CV scans were also carried out on these two dyes in CH2Cl2 solutions (Fig. S1†). It is worth noting that both of the two dyes are redox stable since their CV curves are almost overlapping after repeated scanning. The HOMO and LUMO levels (calibrated by the internal ferrocene reference) are shown in Table 1. The slight upward shift of HOMO and LUMO for WS-9 in experimental results is in agreement with the theoretical calculations.

It is important to evaluate the contributions of the absorbed photons from different transitions to the effective charge separation, hence the ground-state geometries of WS-2 and WS-9 were optimized in the gas phase by DFT with the Gaussian09 package, using the hybrid B3LYP functional and the standard 6-31G(d) basis set. The electron distributions of the frontier orbital (HOMO−2, HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1, LUMO+2) in the systems of WS-2 and WS-9 are shown in Fig. 5. Due to the similar configuration, most of the frontier orbitals of the two dyes possess similar spatial distribution except for the LUMO+2 orbital. For both dyes, the HOMO orbitals are mainly located on the indoline and benzothiadiazole skeleton while the HOMO−1 orbital is distributed on the whole molecules. Interestingly, for the two dyes, the LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals are almost the same, covering the whole A–π-A conjunction, with a distinct overlap with the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals on the benzothiadiazole core. Notably, the LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals are very important for the two dyes because most of their electron transition bands involve transporting electrons to these two orbitals. Apparently, besides the HOMO → LUMO absorption band, the observed additional absorption bands at 408 and 458 nm for WS-2 and WS-9, respectively, are also favourable for the photon-to-electron conversion since they correspond to efficient electron-transitions to the LUMO or LUMO+1 orbitals, where electrons could be smoothly injected into the semiconductor. The origins of the additional absorption band in the D–A–π-A dye and the electron distributions for the frontier molecular orbitals are well understood with the aid of DFT and TDDFT calculations. The featured D–A–π-A dyes are preferable compared to common D–π-A dyes for light harvesting, since they possess an additional absorption band for efficient charge separation.

In our previous work, we found that the strong electron-withdrawing unit in the D–A–π-A dyes could weaken the large blue-shift in the ICT band caused by the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group (–COOH). For instance, when organic dyes were adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the free –COOH group became a –COOTi form, which is a result of the deprotonation of the COOH. Most D–π-A organic dyes show a large blue-shift in absorption spectra during this process, which is unfavourable to the long wavelength light harvesting. Taking the triphenylamine dye C219 as an example, its ICT peak was observed at 584 nm in chloroform solution, but distinctly blue-shifted to <500 nm after adsorption on a 2.4 μm TiO2 film.7b The blue-shift was not as apparent in the D–A–π-A featured dyes. Previously, we only compared the absorption spectra of D–A–π-A dyes in solutions and on TiO2 films.11 Considering that the absorption spectra of sensitizer dyes on TiO2 film were also affected by the dye-aggregation and scattering effect of the nanoparticles, here we use triethylamine (TEA) to neutralize the –COOH in the CH2Cl2 solutions and investigate the deprotonation directly. Note that the amount of TEA was excessive for dyes in solution. A reference D–π-A dye LS-1 (ref. 11) having a similar structure to WS-2 with the exception of the benzothiadiazole unit was used in this experiment. The absorption spectra of the three dyes (WS-2, WS-9 and LS-1) in the presence and absence of TEA in CH2Cl2 solutions are shown in Fig. 6. After the addition of TEA, the absorption spectra of all three dyes showed a blue-shift to various extents. The degree of this blue-shift is also illustrated in Fig. 6, i.e., 15, 18 and 28 nm for WS-9, WS-2 and LS-1, respectively. The reference D–π-A dye LS-1 exhibits a larger blue-shift than WS-2 and WS-9, indicating the weakening of the deprotonation effect by the additional ‘A’ unit in D–A–π-A dyes. The electron transition in the D–π-A structure dyes is facilitated by the push–pull effect of the electron donor and acceptor. The deprotonation of the –COOH group will decrease the electron withdrawing ability of the acceptor group, leading to an inevitable blue-shift in the absorption spectra.20 The longer π-bridge will lead to a larger blue-shift. However, in the D–A–π-A dyes, the additional electron-withdrawing group in the structure assists the electron transition process. The deprotonation induced blue-shift is thus not as evident for D–A–π-A dyes. In addition, it is interesting to find that the shoulder peak of WS-9 at around 450 nm was significantly blue-shifted by the addition of TEA, resulting in three changed absorption bands in 300, 400 and 500 nm intervals to form a broad and high absorption. By contrast, WS-2 showed a similar absorption width but low absorbance in the region of 400–500 nm; LS-1 showed a much narrower absorption range in the presence of TEA. As photo-sensitizer, the absorption spectra of the deprotonated WS-9 are superior to those of WS-2 and LS-1.

Preliminary photovoltaic performance comparison between WS-2 and WS-9
In the first set of experiments, WS-2 and WS-9 were adsorbed onto the TiO2 electrode from a dye solution using CH2Cl2 as the solvent. The devices were filled with a volatile electrolyte (Z960). In order to check the difference in aggregation between the two dyes, parallel experiments were also conducted by adding 2 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) into the dye solutions. The J–V curves of DSSCs based on both dyes, in the presence and absence of CDCA, are shown in Fig. 7. Photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc, Voc, FF, and η are collected in Table 3. As expected, CDCA is effective in increasing the photovoltaic performance for both dyes. However, the improvement witnessed in the presence of coadsorbent for WS-2 is much greater than that for WS-9. For WS-2, 2 mM CDCA increases the photovoltaic performance significantly: Jsc augments from 8.46 to 17.50 mA cm−2, Voc from 601 to 657 mV, and the power conversion efficiency (η) improved from 3.86% to 8.56%. For WS-9, 2 mM CDCA has only a small influence on Jsc and η. The significant incremental increase in Jsc following CDCA coadsorption for WS-2 can be explained by the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 8). The IPCE of WS-2 was almost doubled after CDCA treatment, while for WS-9 there was only a small variation. The manifestly different influence that coadsorption of CDCA has in the presence of WS-2 and WS-9 based DSSCs is a strong indication that the structural differences of the two dyes have a great impact on dye aggregation. A comparison between WS-2 and WS-9 photovoltaic data shows that the introduction of the n-hexylthiophene group leads to an increase in the Voc of the WS-9 device regardless of the presence of CDCA. It is indicative that the introduction of the n-hexylthiophene group in WS-9 yields a Voc value of 692 mV, which is 91 mV higher than that of WS-2 without CDCA. Although the presence of 2 mM CDCA increased the Voc value of WS-2 based DSSCs from 601 to 657 mV, it is still far lower than that of WS-9.

Dye-bath solvent effect on photovoltaic performance
The adsorption and aggregation of sensitizer dyes on TiO2 films are strongly dependent on the solvent used as dye bath.21 Consequently, we systematically studied the aggregation effect of the two dyes on TiO2 photoanodes stained from two dyes containing either CH2Cl2 or CHCl3. A dye loading experiment was performed in order to determine the number of molecules grafted onto the TiO2 surface. For each dye, either a CH2Cl2 or CHCl3 solution of pure dye, and another one containing 10 mM of CDCA were prepared. Transparent TiO2 electrodes were immersed in these solutions, following the standard cell preparation procedure. Before treating the samples with desorbing solution, the photoanodes were thoroughly rinsed using the corresponding solvent in order to remove the loosely bound molecules that were not chemically attached to the TiO2 surface. The number of adsorbed molecules was determined by UV-Vis spectrometry and the values were normalized to the film thickness (assuming that other film parameters, namely porosity and specific surface area, were identical for the same batch of the substrates). As shown in Table 4, it is evident that the number of WS-2 molecules deposited from pure CH2Cl2 is significantly higher than for all other samples in both solvents. This augmentation of surface coverage does not lead to an increase of the photocurrent (Table 3). The addition of CDCA decreased the total number of WS-2 molecules by almost 25%. Nevertheless, the current drawn from the corresponding solar cell is more than doubled. WS-9 is not greatly affected by the presence of the coadsorbent, irregardless of the solvent used; the dye loading is somewhat lower due to the occupation of the adsorption sites by CDCA. A significant increase in photovoltaic performance is not to be expected, since the structure of WS-9 should ensure sufficient steric repulsion between the molecules. We also present the results of the dye adsorption from a different solvent, CHCl3. When using CHCl3 as a dye bath, surprisingly, the number of WS-2 molecules is diminished to a level comparable to WS-9 (without CDCA). CHCl3 is a non-polar solvent and appears to solvate the dye molecules better, resulting in lower dye loading, but in better spatial distribution, preventing the undesired π–π stacking. The addition of CDCA in CHCl3 has no significant effect on the number of adsorbed dye molecules.

The electrodes stained from CHCl3 solutions (with and without the addition of 2 mM CDCA) were used to fabricate solar cells, according to the previously described procedure. The η of DSSC stained by WS-2 (without CDCA) from CHCl3 (7.22%) was almost 2 times higher than that stained from CH2Cl2 (3.86%) (Table 3). However, in the case of coadsorption with 2 mM CDCA the solvent has a negligible influence on the photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 9). It indicates that WS-2 easily forms aggregates on the surface of TiO2 when adsorbed from CH2Cl2 solution in the absence of CDCA. In contrast to WS-2, WS-9 based DSSCs show comparable photovoltaic performance whether CH2Cl2 or CHCl3 is used as the bath solvent for sensitization. In the case of WS-2 based devices, coadsorption with CDCA is helpful in breaking this kind of aggregate, resulting in a significant increase in Jsc, Voc and η. In addition, CDCA may also adsorb on the surface of TiO2, and is believed to hinder the recombination of injected electrons from the TiO2 surface to the oxidized species of the redox electrolyte. Coadsorption of WS-9 with 2 mM CDCA increased the Jsc of DSSCs stained in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 by around 5%. It is worth noting that, in the case of WS-9, changing the solvent from CH2Cl2 to CHCl3 did not induce formation of aggregates, indicating that the presence of a hexyl chain on the thiophene spacer can likewise be helpful in retarding the recombination process. CDCA coadsorption has a marginal influence on the WS-9 sensitized devices. The dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface is simultaneously influenced by the dye structure, bath solvent used for sensitization and coadsorbent. Backing our primary purpose in the specific design of WS-9 it is observed that this dye exhibits superior anti-aggregation capacities and gives better overall performance than WS-2.

Coadsorption with excess CDCA (20 mM)
As discussed above, addition of 2 mM CDCA to the dye solution is helpful in suppressing unfavourable dye aggregation and augmenting the DSSCs performance. Since 2 mM CDCA used as a coadsorbent had a major influence on the photovoltaic parameters of WS-2 in CH2Cl2, we decided to study the influence of a saturated solution of CDCA on photovoltaic parameters. Another set of experiments, where the concentration of CDCA in dye solution was increased to 20 mM, was performed. As the solubility of CDCA in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 is not high, much time was required to dissolve 20 mM CDCA into these solvents using an ultrasonic bath, meaning that the concentration of CDCA in dye solution was close to saturation. As shown in Table 5, following coadsorption with 20 mM CDCA, the photovoltaic performances of both WS-2 and WS-9 devices were further improved. Specifically, WS-9 based DSSCs show Jsc > 18 mA cm−2, Voc > 700 mV, and η > 9%. Importantly, we found that the Voc of WS-2 was limited to around 660 mV, regardless of the CDCA concentration. Therefore, the Voc is the key parameter hindering the efficiency improvement of WS-2 based DSSCs. For WS-2, an increase in Voc was observed with CDCA (600 mV for dye alone and 660 mV with CDCA coadsorbed), whereas the Voc of the WS-9 dye was relatively high, and not influenced by CDCA concentration in the dye solution (690 mV for no CDCA and 700 mV for CDCA coadsorbed). The reason why WS-9 shows higher Voc will be studied by transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis.

Apparent electron lifetime
As discussed above, the lower device performance of WS-2 with respect to WS-9 dye in the presence and absence of the CDCA coadsorbent results mainly from the dye aggregation in addition to enhanced electron recombination. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent experiments performed on the above-discussed set of cells with various concentrations of CDCA confirm the blocking effect of the coadsorbent. WS-2 dye, which lacks a hexyl chain on its π-conjugation moiety, requires the addition of a coadsorbent to prevent the back electron transfer. The Voc of WS-2 sensitized devices is low compared to either coadsorbed devices of WS-2 or WS-9 based devices. Open-circuit voltage is defined as a difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. As the redox potential was kept constant during the experiment through using the same electrolyte, the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 must be changing. The population of electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor determines the position of the quasi-Fermi level; thus, by assuming a constant electron injection rate for each dye, the difference in Voc between the two dyes results from the existence of more electron leakage paths in the case of WS-2 based devices. Bare TiO2 sites exposed directly to the redox electrolyte are examples of such leakage paths. Closer packing of dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 would prevent this exposure, but it would also cause the undesirable aggregation, allowing for dye–dye interactions, and most probably a decrease in the electron injection efficiency. Coadsorbents, like CDCA, are believed to adsorb on the TiO2 surface along with the dye molecules, as well as to separate them from each other. It is also possible that coadsorbents break dye aggregates already in the solution. This role may be as well attributed to the presence of the hexyl chain on the thiophene of the WS-9 dye. This concept proved to work – the difference in the Voc is well pronounced in comparison with WS-2. At the same density of states, which is linearly related to capacitance, the electron lifetime of WS-9 is approximately an order of magnitude longer than that of WS-2 (Fig. 10). As expected, the hexyl chain helps in shielding the non-sensitized TiO2 surface and retarding the electron loss channel. The addition of CDCA results in an order of magnitude increase of the electron lifetime in the case of WS-2 dye; while for WS-9 dye it remained almost unchanged. This could happen due to the coadsorbed CDCA occupying the free spaces on the TiO2 surface in the WS-2 sensitized device, thus retarding the recombination processes.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements give a direct access to the charge transfer resistance of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface.22 A set of devices with and without CDCA was investigated using WS-2 and WS-9 dyes. The lowest charge transfer resistance was found for the WS-2 dye alone cell (Fig. 11), which confirms that injected electrons are likely to undergo recombination with the oxidized form of the redox species present in the electrolyte. The addition of 10 mM CDCA to the dye solution is helpful to increase the interfacial resistance, mainly due to the blocking of recombination sites, correlating to the higher Voc. WS-9 sensitized cells exhibit an order of magnitude higher charge transfer resistance at the same potentials, regardless of the presence of the coadsorbent.

Stability of dyes and devices
For the practical application of DSSCs, the long lifetime of cell devices is an important prerequisite besides high η. Among many factors controlling the lifetime of DSSCs, the stability of sensitizers is an especially critical factor. Katoh and coworkers23 have developed a simple and efficient method to evaluate the stability of sensitizers. Since the most unstable state of the sensitizers is their oxidized state, the corresponding sensitizers must remain stable in the cation state for at least 10 s to be capable of realizing a 10-year operation cycle.23 Actually, we can accelerate the dye aging process upon light irradiation on dye-loaded TiO2 film without redox electrolyte because the dye regeneration process under this condition occurs in the millisecond time range, thus taking 104 to 103 times longer than that in a complete solar cell device (100 ns–1 μs). Fig. S2† illustrates the experimental method, and the photographs of the dye-loaded TiO2 film after light irradiation. Fig. 12 shows the absorption curves of dyes WS-2, WS-9 and LS-1 with aging upon light irradiation of AM 1.5 light (5 or 30 min). Obviously, the photo-stability of benzothiadiazole-containing WS-2 and WS-9 is much higher than that of the reference dye LS-1. Moreover, the photo-stability of WS-2 seems a little higher than that of WS-9 (Fig. 12), suggesting that the existence of the hexyl chain on the thiophene group in WS-9 may decrease its intrinsic photo-stability.24 However, according to Katoh's experience, the additional benzothiadiazole-incorporated WS-2 and WS-9 are stable enough, without any distinct absorption peak shift, for DSSCs application because the variation in absorption curves before and after irradiation is smaller than that of the MK-2.23

On the other hand, the composition of redox electrolytes as well as the encapsulation of cell devices also influence the device stability. For the long term test of device stability, we chose a more stable ionic liquid electrolyte Z952 to fabricate solar cells. Fig. 13 shows the photovoltaic performance during a long term accelerated aging of a WS-9 sensitized solar cell under AM 1.5 irradiation. As shown in Fig. 13, the Jsc, Voc, FF and η values were recorded, indicating that the WS-9 based DSSC is stable under AM 1.5 light for at least 500 h. These preliminary stability tests indicate that the overall device efficiency increased from 6.38% to 6.95% in ionic liquid electrolyte, then slowly dropped, but was still higher than at the starting point after 500 h of light soaking.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a new D–A–π-A organic dye WS-9, solving the aggregation problem of the dye WS-2 through incorporation of a hexylthiophene unit on the π-bridge. The absorption, energy levels and frontier orbitals of WS-9 and WS-2 were studied in detail. We found that D–A–π-A organic dyes show more complicated electronic absorption behavior in comparison to the common D–π-A dyes, resulting in a broader absorption range. The high performance of WS-2 sensitized DSSCs relies on the appropriate choice of dye bath solvent as well as the addition of coadsorbents to diminish its tendency to form aggregates. In contrast, WS-9 exhibits inherent anti-aggregation ability resulting in high performance independent of the use of coadsorbent and the choice of dye bath solvent. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the injected electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance were increased for WS-9 devices. These results can be attributed to the introduction of a hexylthiophene unit in the π-bridge of WS-2, resulting in a higher Voc and a promising high power conversion efficiency of 9.04% for the WS-9 dye. The accelerating dye photo-stability was tested upon light irradiation of a dye-adsorbed TiO2 film in the absence of redox electrolyte, and a WS-9-based DSSC device with ionic liquid redox electrolyte. These findings pave a new way in the design of novel efficient D–A–π-A organic dye sensitizers.

Broader context
Amongst various strategies for improving the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells, successful molecular engineering of the photosensitizers has remarkably contributed to the light harvesting and interfacial environment optimization. Incorporation of an electron-withdrawing unit into the π-conjugation to construct the D–A–π-A configuration organic dyes is a novel and special approach to broaden the photoresponse range and enhance the photovoltaic performance. In this context, we systematically studied a new D–A–π-A organic dye WS-9, solving the aggregation problem of the dye WS-2 through incorporation of a hexylthiophene unit on the π-bridge. WS-9 exhibits inherent anti-aggregation ability, thus showing higher power conversion efficiency in DSSCs than WS-2 regardless of the presence of coadsorbent or kind of dye bath solvent. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the injected electron lifetime and charge recombination resistance were increased for WS-9 devices with respect to those of WS-2. Our research indicates that the D–A–π-A featured organic dyes with appropriate structure modifications are promising in the development of highly efficient DSSCs.
