    , Accepted 3rd September 2019First published on 4th September 2019AbstractAs an effective alternative to a solar cell, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have received a lot of attention since they can cut the cost of photovoltaic cells and realize building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). However, there is still the challenge of how to make LSCs with cost-effective methods and green materials in order to make the practical use of LSCs more feasible. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the green fabrication of LSCs using nontoxic quantum dots as fluorophores. We first discuss the operating principle of LSCs and various nontoxic fluorophores. We then introduce green quantum dot based LSCs. Finally, the challenges and future developments of the green fabrication of LSCs using nontoxic quantum dots are briefly discussed.
1. Introduction
Generating electricity from solar radiation has gained a lot of attention in recent years in order to meet the demands for clean and renewable energy, eventually alleviating the greenhouse effect caused by excessive carbon dioxide emissions from the mass use of fossil fuels.1–8 Solar cells already have excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), for example, the PCE of widely commercialized single-crystal silicon solar cells is ∼25%.8,9 However, in practical applications, power generation is more and more restricted because of the limited working area regarding conventional silicon solar cells.2 Furthermore, conventional silicon solar cells are expensive and lack the ability to use diffused sunlight.10,11 Therefore, recent research on the topic of solar cells has mainly focused on novel materials and new processes. Low-cost solar cells such as dyes12,13 and polymer solar cells,14,15 quantum dots (QDs) solar cells,16,17 and perovskite solar cells18–22 have been considered as an alternative to silicon solar cells.
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have been explored as a potential solution for solar energy usage.2,10,11 The concept of LSCs was first proposed in the 1970s to reduce the cost of solar cells.23,24 In addition, LSCs can provide a variety of colors for semi-transparent building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which decreases the aesthetical inflexibility.
Several reviews on LSCs have been presented in the past, most of which focused on dyes and heavy metal QD based LSCs.25–29 Here, we will review the recent advances in the green fabrication of LSCs using nontoxic quantum dots as fluorophores since fabricating LSCs using green materials is demanded for practical use. We will briefly introduce the operating principles of LSCs and various nontoxic fluorophores. Then, green quantum dot based LSCs will be discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of the green fabrication of LSCs using nontoxic quantum dots will be briefly discussed.
2. Operating principles and various fluorophores
2.1 Operating principles
A typical LSC consists of a transparent polymer waveguide plate, doped or coated with a highly luminescent material that absorbs most of the solar radiation.10,11,24,30,31 Fluorophores absorb incident sunlight and then re-emit photons at longer wavelengths, which are transported to the edges of LSCs coupled with solar cells.10,11,32–34 The surface area of LSCs exposed to sunlight is much larger than that of the edges coupled with solar cells (Fig. 1). The ratio of the LSC area (ALSC) to the solar cell area (Acell) is defined as the geometric (G) factor: (1)
 Fig. 1  The numbers indicate the typical processes of energy loss in a LSC. (I) Unabsorbed light; (II) light is reflected from the top surface; (III) light is absorbed due to the non-unity of fluorophores; (IV) re-emitted light escapes from the surface due to the escape cone (the angle smaller than the critical angle), and (V) light is reabsorbed by another fluorophore. 
One commonly used parameter to determine the optical performance of an LSC is optical conversion efficiency (ηopt):16 (2)where ILSC is the short circuit current generated by the solar cell attached to the LSC, and Icell is the short circuit current of the same solar cell under direct solar illumination.
Another important factor used to define the optical performance of an LSC is the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which compares the output electric power supplied by a solar cell attached to an LSC relative to the power striking the LSC:35 (3)where Icell is the short circuit current, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor of the PV cell, P is the irradiation intensity, and ALSC is the area of the LSC.
As shown in Fig. 1, incident light is lost in different ways. (I) Only a fraction of the incident light can be absorbed due to the limitation of fluorophore absorption. Thus, the optical performance of LSCs is largely determined by the fluorophores. (II) Some incident photons are reflected at the surface of the LSCs. (III) Photons are lost because the PQLY of fluorophores is below 100%. (IV) A fraction of re-emitted light is lost due to an emission angle falling into an escape cone. (V) The light is reabsorbed due to an overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the fluorophores.
2.2 Various fluorophores
Definitely, fluorophores are the most crucial part of LSCs, and they have a large effect on the absorption and reabsorption. The requirements of ideal fluorophores are a big absorption coefficient and broad absorption, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), little or even zero overlap between absorption and emission spectra, high stability, and low toxicity.35 So far, the numbers of fluorophores are increasing, including organic dyes, QDs, and lanthanide ions, which are selectively summarized in Table 1.

2.2.1 Organic dyes. 
Organic dyes are the first luminophores for LSC applications due to their high quantum yield and good solubility in polymer matrices.26,46 Organic dyes are π-conjugated molecules and their optical properties depend on their chemical structures.27 Rhodamines, coumarins, and perylene derivatives are the most studied dyes. BASF Lumogen F Red 305 (R305) is the most used organic dye in LSC research mainly due to its excellent optical properties.29 To date, research on LSCs of R305 has developed to an outdoor test.47–50
However, organic dyes can only absorb a little fraction of solar light because they have a narrow absorption range in the visible and UV regions, as shown in the Table 1. To overcome this issue, researchers have combined different dyes to improve the absorption in the UV and visible parts of spectrum.26 On the other hand, the PL emission spectrum of organic dyes is smaller than the absorption spectrum of commercial silicon solar cells, which is a cause of large energy loss. Both the problems significantly limit their commercial application.
It is worth noting that a small number of researchers have focused on natural materials that make LSCs cheaper and more environmentally friendly while keeping other inherent properties such as high absorption and PLQY. The most common natural dyes applied for LSCs are phycobilisomes.51–53 However, reports on natural dyes for LSCs are still rare. Davis et al. prepared LSCs based on boron-dipyrromethene emitters covalently linked to oligofluorene, which were dispersed in lauryl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and the external quantum efficiency of the device reached up to 2.44%.51 Frias et al. synthesized R-phycoerythrin aqueous solutions applied for LSCs.53 The absorption of R-phycoerythrin matched solar irradiation on earth (300–700 nm), and the emission peak was around 580 nm. In previous work, ηopt and PCE of the prepared LSCs were ∼6.88% and ∼0.27%, respectively. The research on natural materials demonstrates that natural dyes might be potentially applied in green and cheap LSCs.


2.2.2 Quantum dots. 
QDs are the most active members in the family of LSC luminophores. Their absorption and emission spectra depend on their size, which can be controlled by synthetic conditions.54–59 The absorption spectrum of ideal QDs for LSC fabrication should overlap significantly with the solar spectrum. Meanwhile, their emissions should fall in the spectral response range of solar cells, resulting in the generation of power. QDs are potential fluorophores for LSCs since they offer several advantages: (1) high PLQY (up to 100% for some QDs). (2) Easy synthesis via some wet chemistry routes (low cost). (3) Size-tunable absorption and emission spectra. (4) Good stability compared with other luminophores, particularly core–shell QD structures.60–64 In fact, there is no doubt that QDs cannot have 100% PLQYs and no overlap between their absorption and emission bands. Therefore, there will actually be energy loss (processes III and V). Purcell-Milton et al.35 and Li et al.63 suggested that even a very small overlap between absorption and emission spectra could result in bulk energy loss. Thus, to decrease the loss of energy, QDs need a high PLQY and little or even no overlap between absorption and emission.
The first QD-based LSCs were introduced by Barnham et al.65–68 They offered a thermodynamic model using CdSe/ZnS and CdSe/CdS QDs. PbS and PbSe were paid attention by the researchers owing to an efficient and widely tunable emission spectrum in the infrared region.69,70 Shcherbatyuk et al. prepared PbS QDs in an early attempt, the spectrum of which covered 800 nm. In addition, compared with CdSe/ZnS QDs which exhibited a Stokes shift of 23 nm, the Stokes shift of PbS QDs expanded to 122 nm.70 However, because of the small absorbance of PbS QD solutions, a large concentration of QDs can lead to a stronger reabsorption. After developing a CdS shell around the PbS core, the chemical stability of the new core–shell structured QDs was enhanced with an almost unchanged PLQY.61 Tan et al. used PbS QDs with a diameter of 2.2 nm and a thin layer (0.1 nm) of CdS in PMMA.71 Their Stokes shift was 0.36 eV and the emission spectral range was 700–1100 nm, which is consistent with Si solar cells. However, the PCE of the fabricated LSCs was only 1.2%, which is far from the requirements of practical applications.
Recently, as a semiconductor commonly used in solar cells, inorganic CsPbX3 or organic–inorganic CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite QDs72,73 have various advantages and great potential for LSC applications, including tunable absorption and emission spectra because of their tunable size and composition, similar to traditional inorganic QDs, large UV-visible and high absorption coefficients in the near infrared range and high PLQYs (up to 100%). Nikolaidou et al. prepared organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite QD thin film LSCs with small sizes of 15 × 15 × 1 mm3 and a high refractive index up to 2.5, which is significantly larger than that of glass and polymer film.30 In addition, the LSCs had a good stability, and could remain working after 7 weeks. However, the Stokes shift of the perovskite QDs was small, which limits large-area LSCs due to high reabsorption energy loss. In order to solve this problem, Zhao et al. developed mixed-halide perovskite QDs via a hot-injection method for large area LSC applications.74 As shown in Fig. 2a, mixed-halide CsPb(BrxI1−x) QDs showed an obviously cubic shape with a size of ∼13 nm. Importantly, mixed-halide perovskite CsPb(BrxI1−x) QDs (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) exhibited twice the Stokes shift of pure-halide perovskite QDs (Fig. 2b), which can decrease reabsorption energy loss in LSCs. In colloidal QDs, Stokes shift is not affected by a single factor but by a combination of effects such as band-edge fine-structure splitting size polydispersity and phonon-assisted emission.75 In that article, the larger Stokes shift in mixed-halide QDs (standard deviation, σ < 15%) may be due to their larger size distribution compared with single halide perovskite QDs (σ < 7%). In addition, the large-area LSCs based on CsPb(Br0.2I0.8) showed an optical conversion efficiency of 2% with a G factor of 45 and long-time air stability, which increases perovskite QD LSC commercialization potentiality. On the other hand, doping ions into perovskite QDs is an effective method. Meinardi et al. introduced large-area LSCs based on manganese-doped CsPbCl3 QDs.76 Moreover, dopant emission was barely affected by reabsorption in light propagation measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. However, it still remains a challenge to prepare LSCs based on perovskite QDs with high QYs and broad absorption spectra.

In this field, most published works contain Pb2+ or Cd2+ ions.41,72,73,76–81 However, the environment will be polluted by using a large number of Pb2+ or Cd2+ ions. Considering environmental protection, researchers have prepared LSCs based on heavy metal-free QDs, e.g., carbon QDs,82 silicon QDs,83 InP QDs84etc.


2.2.3 Lanthanide ions. 
Lanthanide ions are alternative luminophores. Owing to a partially filled 4f inner shell, they have unique optical properties such as a high PLQY, broad absorption spectrum, large Stokes shift and narrow emission spectrum.85 Neodymium (Nd3+) was applied to LSCs by Levitt and Weber in 1977. Reisfeld and Kalisky proved that Nd3+ doped glasses performed poorly because the emitted light at 880 nm was reabsorbed, which increased the energy loss.86 After a series of attempts of doping a single ion, researchers started to combine two ions.87 In this case, one ion absorbs the light and transfers the emission to a second ion, which is similar to lamination LSCs. Reisfeld and Kalisky reported the combination of Nd3+ and Ytterbium (Yb3+) in LSCs where light absorbed by Neodymium first was transferred to Ytterbium, which exhibited a 970 nm excitation peak.87 Although there is an increase in the position of the excitation peak, it is still not good enough.
Another way to increase the absorption is to use the fact that Ln3+ can be complexed with organic molecules, which collect incident light and transfer energy to the metal ions and there is little overlap between the absorption and emission spectra.34 However, due to their low absorption coefficients and expensive price, these disadvantages largely reduces the light-harvesting efficiency of LSCs based on lanthanide based organic–inorganic hybrid materials, thus limiting their commercial applications.


2.2.4 Other novel fluorophores. 
Besides the above several traditional fluorescent materials, some novel types of fluorescent materials were recently applied to LSCs, which achieved good performances.
Fluorescent proteins can be applied to LSCs due to their high PLQY, narrow emission, good photostability and large-scale production capacity. Sadeghi et al. synthesized mScarlet fluorescent proteins in aqueous medium and prepared efficient LSCs based on them.88 In addition, the PLQY of mScarlet fluorescent proteins could reach up to 61% and the photoluminescence peak was in the red spectral region, which is beneficial to the absorption of silicon solar cells. The LSCs based on high concentrations of mScarlet fluorescent proteins achieved an efficiency of up to 5%, which demonstrates the potential for photovoltaic construction.
Aqueous-solution-processed gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are newly emerged fluorophores for LSCs owing to their large Stokes shift, high photostability and photoinduced charge separation character.89–92 However, the poor PLQY (lower than 1%) of AuNCs limited their applications. Huang et al. prepared LSCs based on glutathione-stabilized gold nanoclusters (GSH-AuNCs).91 They showed that the PLQY of solid GSH-AuNCs/PVP composites could reach up to 25%. The Stokes shift of the LSCs was large owing to GSH-AuNCs’ special ligand-to-metal charge-transfer state emission. Compared with conventional fluorescent materials, their high-loading LSCs can exhibit excellent optical quality, film uniformity and large Stokes shifts. The same group developed Zn2+-induced cross-linked AuNCs (Zn-AuNCs) to enhance the PLQY of AuNCs.92 As-prepared Zn-AuNC-based LSCs showed high solid-state PLQYs up to ∼53% and large Stokes shifts. More interestingly, the LSCs based on Zn-AuNCs/PVP nanocomposites showed a high internal quantum efficiency of 34–36%. In addition, the PL emission intensity of the LSCs did not change under ambient conditions for 2 h.
According to the above results, both the novel fluorophores show a good performance that is not weaker than traditional luminescent materials. However, fluorescent proteins and AuNCs are still far from practical applications since they are usually not cost effective.

3. Luminescent solar concentrators based on green quantum dots
3.1 Carbon QD-based LSCs
Carbon QDs were discovered in 2004.93 Since then, carbon QDs have been well developed.94–97 Carbon is an extremely abundant element in the earth. Moreover, Carbon QDs are considered to be ideal luminophores due to their unique properties including tunable absorption and emission spectra over the total UV-visible-NIR range, simple synthesis, various fabrication methods, high PLQYs, nontoxicity and low cost.
Li et al. first applied N doped carbon QDs (N-CDs) to fabricate LSCs in 2017, the optimal PCE of which was 3.94 ± 0.04%.82 They prepared N-CDs by a one-step microwave method. The N-CDs exhibited a spherical shape with a size of around 2.8 ± 0.2 nm and good dispersion (Fig. 3a and b). As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the prepared N-CDs exhibited an absorption peak at 400 nm and emission peak at 546 nm, presenting a relatively large Stokes shift of 56 meV with respect to the traditional inorganic QDs. In addition, the LSCs based on N-CDs showed long-term stability under daylight. The successful preparation can open up the application of carbon dots in LSCs. They also fabricated high-performance N-CDs/PMMA slab based LSCs whose external optical efficiency could reach 12.23% when the concentration of loaded N-CDs was 0.08 wt%.98

Shortly after, Wang et al. reported LSCs based on N-CDs/PVP in 2018.40 They investigated the optical properties and performance with different layer numbers and concentrations of N-CDs. The best performance of N-CDs/PVP thin-film LSCs could be achieved when layer number was 7 (0.5 wt% N-CDs), as shown in Table 2. Fig. 3e and f shows that the absorption intensity also increased with CD concentration and thin film layer number, respectively. The PCE of prepared LSCs based on N-CDs/PVP could reach up to 4.97 ± 0.03%, which is higher than that of LSCs based on PbSe QDs (4.74%) prepared by Waldron et al.99 Herein, CDs also show great potential in LSC industrial applications. Very recently, the same group fabricated tandem luminescent solar concentrators based on N-CDs/PVP thin film as a top layer. Since coupling two types of luminophores leads to the improvement of absorption of sunlight, the prepared tandem luminescent solar concentrators exhibited a considerable boost in efficiency (Fig. 4).100

In addition, using in situ cross-linking organosilane-functionalized carbon nanodots (Si-CNDs) as the luminophores, Talite et al. fabricated high-loading LSCs with high optical quality. They showed that high solid-state PLQYs of 45 ± 5% could be achieved in such LSCs with 25 wt% luminophore loadings.101 Zhou et al. prepared large-area and tandem thin-film LSCs based on two types of CDs.102 The first CDs (PLQY: 30%) were synthesized via a solvothermal method. Then, CDs were presented in OLA, which modified the C-dot surfaces, making C-dots hydrophobic due to the long carbon-chain. Thus, C-dots can be uniformly dispersed in nonpolar solvents such as hexane, as shown in Fig. 5a. They pointed out that the PLQY of CDs could be improved by modifying Na+ on the surface.103 In the article, the PLQY of CDs can be increased up to 40%. The absorption and emission spectra of CDs with different surface treatments are shown in Fig. 5b. It can be observed that the absorption peak at 565 nm almost disappeared. The PL lifetime of the original and OLA-modified C-dots was longer than that of a NaOH treated C-dot, as shown in Fig. 5c. The other CDs emitted yellow light under sunlight, as shown in Fig. 5d2. Zhou et al. fabricated large-area thin-film LSCs based on the Na+ modified CDs (Fig. 5d3). The PCE of large-area thin film LSCs reached up to ∼1.1%. In addition, they designed tandem thin film LSCs, providing new ideas for LSC study.

In summary, CDs with a high photoluminescence quantum yield, low cost and environmentally friendly nature show great potential in LSC applications. However, it can be observed that the PCE of CD based LSCs is lower than 10%, which is the standard for commercial application of LSCs. Thus, further research towards achieving high efficiency LSCs should focus on the development of CDs with a broad absorption range, high PLQY and large Stokes shift.
3.2 Silicon QD-based LSCs
Indirect bandgap silicon QDs were used as luminophores for high-efficiency LSCs.104 Silicon is the most abundant element on the earth's surface. The yearly production of silicon is ∼8 million tons, and a small part of this is enough for the solar sectors. Silicon QDs have advantages such as being earth abundant, large Stokes shifts up to 400 meV and nontoxicity. Meinardi et al.104 first used silicon QDs as emitters for LSCs, which were semi-transparent, as shown in Fig. 6a. They combined silicon QDs with polymer matrices to decrease reabsorption and scattering. The absorption and emission of silicon QDs in toluene and PLMA are shown in Fig. 6b, and the peaks of both absorption and emission were similar. Fig. 6c shows that only 25% emission light escaped from the surface of the LSCs. 75% of the total light was transported to the device edges, which is consistent with the maximum theoretical value of a light-trapping efficiency.105 To directly evaluate the reabsorption losses with a lateral area of 12 × 12 cm2 of LSCs, they collected the photoluminescence spectrum at different distances (Fig. 6d). As they expected, the emissions excited at 10 cm and 12 cm were similar, which further confirms that the reabsorption energy loss is little. The optical efficiency of LSCs with a size of (12 × 12 × 0.26 cm3) was up to 2.85% under sunlight, as shown in Fig. 6e and 6f. In addition, the optical conversion efficiency decreased with increased LSC lateral area due to the combination effect of reabsorption and scattering losses. They also introduced flexible LSCs, which provides a new design for building-integrated photovoltaics.

Samantha et al.83 proved that the best loading fraction of silicon QDs in PMMA was up to 0.1 wt% for LSCs (Fig. 7d). The average particle size of silicon QDs was 2.9 nm, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. According to Fig. 7c, the PLQY of Si/PMMA was ∼50% before and after forming the composite. As shown in Fig. 7d, the optimal loading for a residential window based on non-scattering LSCs was ∼0.6 wt% with a PLQY of 50% and ∼0.1 wt% with a PLQY 100%. In addition, silicon QDs would be oxidized with PMMA alone. Silicon QDs were functionalized with methyl 10-undecenoate, showing low scattering losses, which contributes to industrial production and application. Towards gaining high efficiency LSCs, future research on the development of silicon QDs should focus on obtaining a large Stokes shift, a wide absorption spectrum and chemical stability.

3.3 CuInSxSe2−x QD and other metal QD-based LSCs
CuInSxSe2−x was first prepared via a co-precipitation approach and the ZnS shell was formed via a cation exchange approach.106 Moreover, synthetic approaches include hot-injection,107 thermal decomposition,108 solvothermal methods,109etc. The near-infrared CuInSxSe2−x QDs have been investigated for LSCs due to their large Stokes shift and high PLQY.
Li et al. reported CuInS2/ZnS QDs as luminophores of LSCs for the first time.63 They prepared CuInS2/ZnS QDs via a one-pot approach, and the average size of the QDs was 4.0 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 8a and b). Fig. 8c shows the absorption and emission spectrum of CuInS2/ZnS QDs in PMMA. It can be observed that the emission peak of CuInS2/ZnS QDs was 550 nm and the full width at half maximum was about 125 nm. In addition, the PLQY of the CuInS2/ZnS QDs reached up to 81%. Moreover, combining the PL spectrum and absorption spectrum, the Stokes shift was more than 150 nm, which is larger than that of most QDs. They proved that the vibration behavior of CuInS2/ZnS QDs was limited in the PMMA, leading to a narrower PL emission. The dimension of the LSCs based on CuInS2/ZnS QDs was 2.2 × 2.2 × 0.03 cm3 and the PCE of the LSCs was relatively high, up to 8.71% (Fig. 8d and e).

After that, other researchers achieved some good results on CuInSxSe2−x QDs for LSC fabrication.106,110–114 The colorless LSCs of CuInSxSe2−x within photo-polymerized poly(lauryl methacrylate) were prepared by Meinardi et al., and the PCE of the LSCs reached up to 3.27%.106 Recently, Zn and Al co-doped CIS QDs were synthesized for LSCs by Zhu et al.110 Their LSCs achieved an optical conversion efficiency of 6.97% and a PCE of 3.18%. According to their results, it was demonstrated that doping CIS QDs is an effective approach to achieve large area LSC applications.
Liu et al. prepared highly efficient scattering enhanced LSCs based on CuInS2/ZnS QDs with different amounts and sizes of SiO2 particles. 114Fig. 9a shows that pure PMMA bulk displayed a good transparency while SiO2 scattering enhanced LSC bulk (S-LSCs) showed a scattering effect under sunlight. S-LSCs revealed luminescent properties under UV light in Fig. 9b. The transmittance spectra of pure PMMA bulk and S-LSCs with different amounts and diameters of SiO2 are shown in Fig. 9c and 9d, respectively. The results demonstrated that the transmittance of QD LSCs without SiO2 is higher than that of QD-based LSCs with SiO2 and the transmittance decreases with increasing the amount of SiO2. Meanwhile, the transmittance of QD LSCs reduces with a larger size of SiO2. Two of the above phenomena illustrate that SiO2 can improve the absorption ability of LSCs compared to LSCs without SiO2. More interestingly, the PL emission intensity of S-LSCs was stronger than that of normal LSCs, as shown in Fig. 9e and 9f. In addition, both the size and concentration of SiO2 could affect PL emission intensity. To further confirm the scattering effect, the LSCs were observed using optical microscopy, as shown in Fig. 9g and 9h. The dimension of SiO2 was micron-sized and the SiO2 particles were distributed in S-LSCs. They confirmed that the SiO2 particles played a major role as scattering materials in the LSC waveguides, which contributes to the development of LSCs.

In summary, CIS QD based LSCs have great development prospects owing to their low price, good optical properties, nontoxicity and good chemical stability. More research on these devices will pave the way for the design of eco-friendly LSCs.
Mn2+-doped ZnSe/ZnS QDs have well separates absorption and emission spectra, and they exhibit a large Stokes shift of ∼1 eV, as shown in Fig. 10a.115 LSCs would be transparent because only UV can be absorbed by ZnSe/ZnS QDs. ZnSe/ZnS QDs can solve the problem of large reabsorption losses due to the large Stokes shift. However, other ions like Cd2+ doped in ZnSe/ZnS display small losses. Thus, a rational selection of QDs and doped ions is a potential approach to overcome the challenge of large reabsorption losses.

Sadeghi et al. reported on LSCs based on cadmium-free InP/ZnO core/shell QDs.84 As shown in Fig. 10b, the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra decreases with increased ZnO shell thickness, which is beneficial for decreasing the reabsorption losses. The LSC based on InP/ZnO is shown in Fig. 10c. In addition, the optical efficiency was 1.45%. They pointed out that the shell beneficially defended recombination dynamics and PLQY against the host material effect.
4. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, we reviewed recent research progress in the green fabrication of LSCs using nontoxic quantum dots as fluorophores such as CDs, silicon QDs and CuInSxSe2−x QDs. In the past few years, people have devoted great effort to exploring the synthesis, properties and applications of these QDs. Compared with other fluorophores, heavy metal-free QDs have low cost, high PLQYs, easy syntheses, high stability and nontoxicity. However, possible strategies that can be potentially used to improve the performance of green QD-based LSCs should be carried out since the PCE and size of fabricated LSCs still cannot meet the commercial standard. Regarding green QD-based LSCs, in particular CD-based and silicon QD-based LSCs, the future work should focus on the following aspects:
(1) CD-based LSCs: (I) the absorption spectrum should be extended to longer wavelengths. (II) The size of CDs should be more uniform, and the PLQY should be improved. (III) in the future, researchers should focus on the synthesis of CDs with a broad absorption and functional surface to improve the efficiency of CD-based LSCs. (IV) the reabsorption loss is still large and this should be decreased in the future. To achieve these aims, the future work should be expanded using the following methods: (1) Doping CDs using other inorganic atoms such as B, N, S etc. (2) Covering CDs with shells including ZnS, ZnO, SiO2etc. (3) Modifying the surface of CDs by organic molecules like ethylenediamine, polyethylene glycol etc. (4) Paying more attention to microwave and ultrasonic syntheses, which offer many advantages such as non-toxicity, low-cost, and facile and scalable processing. However, process parameters should be optimized in order to obtain fine control of particle size. Additionally, a better new type of green synthetic preparation method should be developed.
(2) Silicon QD-based LSCs: (I) cheap methods and green precursors of preparation are highly desired. (II) The chemical stability of silicon QDs should be greatly improved. (III) The Stokes shift of QDs should be increased to decrease the reabsorption losses. To achieve these aims, the future work should be expanded using the methods similar to those described for CDs.
(3) Since perovskite quantum dots are low cost and have good performances in high-efficiency devices, nontoxic or low toxic perovskite quantum dots such as lead-free perovskite QDs (e.g., CsSnI3) should be designed and synthesized to fabricate highly efficient LSCs based on perovskite quantum dots.
(4) Exploring novel polymer materials: polymer materials as waveguides largely affect the transparency and integral PLQYs, which should be beneficial to dispersing fluorophores, maintaining their optical properties, and showing a high tolerance to structural degradation, thus resulting in highly long-term stable LSCs. In addition to exploring novel polymer materials,116 the selection of suitable polymer materials that match with the fluorescent materials is also important. For example, PMMA has little absorption in the visible region, the absorption of which is at 730–800 nm. More importantly, PMMA is a polar medium, which is not favorable for QDs that are usually covered with nonpolar hydrophobic organic ligands. Poly(lauryl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), abbreviated as P(LMA-co-EDGMA), can be chosen as the matrix material for QD LSC fabrication owing to its similar transparency and refractive index with PMMA, and the dodecyl chain in the molecule can help QDS disperse well in the polymer matrix without loss of PLQY.117
(5) The efficiency of current green QD-based LSCs is still not high enough to meet the requirements of BIPVs. In addition, the size of current green QD-based LSCs is still not uniform, and the optical properties of QDs need to be finely tuned to eliminate or decrease the reabsorption energy loss.
(6) In order to improve PCE, the emission wavelength of designed green QDs should match the spectral response of solar cells as much as possible. Besides the optimization of QDs for LSCs, novel architectures of LSCs should be designed, such as tandem structured LSCs, which can effectively improve absorption and PCE. In addition, engineered luminophores such as highly fluorescent green QDs with two strong emission peaks should be developed to guarantee improved optical properties. In addition, optimization of parameters such as concentration and film quality can also effectively improve the PCE of LSCs. For example, Li et al.82 reported that the PCE of LSCs based on N-CDs first increased with the thin film thickness and then decreased.
We hope that this article can promote the development of the green fabrication of LSCs based on heavy metal-free QDs.
