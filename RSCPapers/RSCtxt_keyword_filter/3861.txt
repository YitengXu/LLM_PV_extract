An electrolyte containing a combination of these LCs and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) exhibits higher photovoltage than one with only TBP, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency.
Over the past decades, tremendous effort has been made by researchers in optimizing the photovoltaic performances of DSCs. Along with the evolution of redox electrolytes, several kinds of electrolyte additives have been introduced into the electrolyte to ameliorate the power conversion efficiency. The widely used additives in Co-complex electrolytes are lithium salts and 4-tert-butylpyridine. Additives have been found to adsorb onto the semiconductor surface and change the surface charge, shift the conduction band position of the semiconductor and/or reduce interfacial recombination.1 The adsorption of additives therefore affects the photovoltaic parameters and thus the overall efficiency.
The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is one of the key photovoltaic parameters and is set by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor (typically TiO2) and the redox potential of redox couples. Voc enhancement upon adding TBP in an electrolyte is due to two combined effects: (1) negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band and (2) reduced interfacial recombination between electrons in TiO2 and oxidized species of the redox shuttles.1b A variety of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazole, triazole, thiazole and quinoline derivatives, have been tried as replacements for TBP in the electrolyte.2 Typically, addition of these nitrogen-containing compounds caused lower short-circuit current densities (Jsc) with only a few of them having a higher Voc compared to TBP.
Co(II/III) complex redox mediators for DSCs have received overwhelming attention owing to their more positive redox potential compared to the conventional I−/I3− electrolyte, resulting in higher Voc and ultimately more efficient device performances.3 Interestingly, redox potential of the Co(II/III) electrolyte can also be fine-tuned via Lewis base interactions and consequently accomplished higher Voc.4 Recently, DSCs using Co(II/III) redox couples with a new hexadentate polypyridyl ligand have shown promising stability for commercial application.5 While working with Co(II/III) redox electrolytes, researchers still follow the general concepts previously applied to the I−/I3− electrolyte, with TBP still being their first choice as an additive to reduce the TiO2/Co-complex3+ interfacial recombination. As previously reported, the recombination rate in the Co(II/III) electrolyte can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in the I−/I3− electrolyte.6 Therefore, TBP alone may not be ideal in retarding interfacial recombination in Co(II/III) mediated DSCs. This opens an opportunity for other materials to be involved in generating more efficient Co(II/III) mediated DSCs.
Liquid crystals (LCs) have become one of the potential materials for replacing ionic liquids which possess high viscosity retarding physical diffusion of redox species in the electrolyte. In 2004, Grätzel and co-workers reported a highly conductive solid I−/I3− electrolyte made by doping LCs with a solid iodide salt and iodine.7 Yanagida and co-workers reported a highly conductive ionic LC electrolyte using self-assembled imidazolium cations in ionic LCs (C12MImI/I2) that generated a higher Jsc than the ionic liquid analogue C11MImI/I2.8 Furthermore, incorporation of LCs into a polymeric gel electrolyte would also improve its conductivity, chain mobility and form an effective transport pathway for redox species.9
4-Cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and 4-cyano-4′-octylbiphenyl (8CB) (Fig. 1) are cyanobiphenyl LCs. These molecules can adsorb onto the TiO2 surface via an electron lone pair located on the cyano group. Due to its electron donating nature, the conduction band is expected to be upshifted, resulting in higher Voc. In addition, its longer molecular lengths (with respect to TBP) and the hydrophobic tail may establish a more efficient insulating barrier to Co3+ in the electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, no LC has been used as a liquid electrolyte additive in DSCs. Herein, we report the use of two cyanobiphenyl LCs, 5CB and 8CB, as liquid electrolyte additives in Co(II/III) mediated DSCs for photovoltage enhancement.

The J–V characteristics of DSCs sensitized with L10210 using different Co-electrolyte compositions (E1 to E8) are summarized in Table 1. To understand the roles of 5CB and 8CB, device performances are compared between E1 to E4. Only the TBP-containing electrolyte (E2) possesses a Voc of 789 mV while the TBP-free electrolyte (E1) has only 709 mV. The enhancement comes from (1) the upshifted conduction band and (2) higher recombination resistance (Rrec), which is in agreement with previous observation for I−/I3− redox shuttles.1b In addition, the redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ does not alter significantly in the presence of 5CB and 8CB (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Surprisingly, DSCs using E3 and E4, in which TBP was replaced by 5CB and 8CB, respectively, exhibit increments in Voc of 57 mV and 72 mV compared to E2. The results were collected and compared 1 day after fabrication due to slower adsorption of 5CB and 8CB onto bare TiO2 surfaces compared to TBP. The LCs upshift the conduction band of TiO2 to a similar position to that of TBP (Fig. S2, ESI†). In Fig. 2, it can be clearly seen that the conduction band is further upshifted by these cyanobiphenyl LCs 1 day after fabrication. However, the conduction band still remained at a similar position after 1 day in the electrolyte containing only TBP.
 Fig. 2  Conduction band and recombination resistance of a fresh cell (solid symbol) and the cell after 1 day (open symbol) using E2, E3 and E4. Chemical capacitance (C) and recombination resistance (Rrec) are plotted against Vf and Vecb, respectively. 
As more 5CB and 8CB adsorbed onto the bare TiO2 surface 1 day after fabrication, Rrec is enhanced (Fig. 2). This explains the Voc enhancement in DSCs using E3 and E4 from the freshly prepared cells (compared to data in Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, it is fair to compare the results 1 day after fabrication.
Photovoltage enhancements upon adding 5CB and 8CB are also observed in the presence of TBP in a Co-complex electrolyte. According to Table 1, the Voc is also improved by adding different concentrations of 5CB and 8CB to E2. A maximum of 104 mV photovoltage improvement is obtained by using E8 (0.2 M TBP and 0.2 M 8CB). Fig. 3 compares the recombination resistance of the cell using E2 to those obtained using E5–E8.

Upon adding 5CB and 8CB to E2, the Rrec increases significantly. These LCs may adsorb onto the bare TiO2 surface via the lone pair electrons at the CN group and form a shield to prevent unwanted recombination. Unlike TBP molecules, these LCs possess biphenyl rings which may be beneficial for molecular packing near the TiO2 surface via stronger π–π interactions. Longer hydrophobic chains also keep Co3+ species further away from the TiO2 surface compared to TBP and ultimately reduce interfacial recombination.
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of devices using E2 and E5–E8 are illustrated in Fig. 4. Coexistence of TBP and LCs in the electrolyte exhibits better power conversion efficiency, which is mainly due to their higher Voc. Compared to E2, Voc of E5 and E7 further increase 41 mV and 42 mV, respectively. With higher LC contents, Voc enhancements of 62 mV and 104 mV are obtained for E6 and E8, respectively, compared to E2. The longer molecular chain of 8CB hindered the oxidized redox species near the TiO2 surface, possessing higher Rrec. Combination of TBP and LCs yields higher power conversion efficiency and a 6.2% efficiency was achieved by using a mixture of TBP and 5CB (E5). IPCEs of devices employing E2 and E5 are shown in Fig. 4 (inset). Addition of LCs to the electrolyte does not change the absorption of the sensitizer.

Plots of Jsc against light intensity are shown in Fig. 5. Combining TBP and LCs in the electrolyte shows linear behaviour and no limiting current density is observed at higher light intensity. Thus, addition of 5CB or 8CB in the presence of TBP in the electrolyte does not cause any mass transport limitation for Co(II/III) redox couples. Charge transfer resistances at the counter electrode (RCE) of DSCs using different electrolytes are also measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). The presence of LCs in the electrolyte does not limit the cell performances with increasing RCE. All the cells exhibit small RCE (around 1–2 Ω cm2, see Table S2, ESI†). The device using the E8 electrolyte was also stored in the dark and tested periodically (Fig. S4, ESI†). It is shown that addition of LCs into the electrolyte does not disturb the stability while achieving higher photovoltage of the device. Device optimization is mainly based on our previous work on TBP in Co-based DSCs.11

In conclusion, cyanobiphenyl LCs 5CB and 8CB have been demonstrated as good additives to Co(II/III) electrolytes. These additives enhance the photovoltage of the device via: (1) an upshift of the conduction band of TiO2 and (2) retardation of TiO2/electrolyte interfacial recombination. Longer molecular chains of 5CB and 8CB compared to TBP keep Co3+ further away from TiO2 and exhibit superior insulating behaviour. The combination of 5CB–8CB and TBP guarantees higher recombination resistance and translates into higher power conversion efficiency without causing any mass transport limitation or increase in RCE. Further studies of other cyanobiphenyls as electrolyte additives are ongoing in our laboratory.
