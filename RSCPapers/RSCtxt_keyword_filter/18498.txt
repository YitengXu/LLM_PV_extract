    , Accepted 10th July 2019First published on 10th July 2019AbstractThe past six years have witnessed tremendous progress in the area of perylene diimide (PDI) based non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to obtain high performance OSCs, ring fusion has been proposed as an efficient approach to achieve a trade-off between suppressing the self-aggregation and maintaining the charge-transfer properties of 3D-shaped PDI derivatives. By using two star-shaped PDI-based small molecule acceptors (SMAs), TPDI3 and FTPDI3, we demonstrated here the violation of this molecular design concept for the first time. OSCs were fabricated by using these two compounds as electron acceptors and the commercially available PTB7-Th as the electron donor. The non-fused TPDI3 based devices exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.84%, which is higher than that of the fused counterpart FTPDI3 (7.93%). This illustrates that ring-fusion is detrimental to the device performance in the case of TPDI3 and FTPDI3. This result provides new insight into the design of novel PDI based non-fullerene acceptors for high performance OSCs.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention in the past few decades due to the bright potential for low-cost, mechanically flexible, and environmentally friendly solar energy conversion.1–5 Owing to the drawbacks of fullerene and its derivative based acceptors such as weak absorption in the visible region, high cost, limited tunability of energy levels, and morphological instability, considerable efforts have been diverted recently to exploring organic non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs).6–11 In respect of the molecule structures, the two most successfully and widely investigated families of SMAs are derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) and ITIC.12–18 It is worth noting that the ITIC derivative based SMAs have achieved the best performance with power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 14% for a single-junction device.19–23 Although PDI based SMAs do not perform as well yet due to the lack of understanding of the structure–performance relationship, they possess other outstanding features such as strong absorption in the visible region, excellent chemical, thermal, and photostability, ease of chemical functionalization, and low-cost synthesis.24–27 Early generations of PDI based SMAs usually feature high planarity and suffer from strong aggregation, leading to the formation of microscale or sub-microscale crystalline domains, which are strongly detrimental to the device performance.28–33 To tackle this issue, various molecular design strategies for PDI based SMAs have been developed to reduce the intermolecular interactions and excessive domain sizes. For example, linking two or three PDI units directly together at the imide, ortho or bay position,34–42 or connecting several PDI units with a congested core at their ortho or bay position to construct twisted geometries.43–54 However, the introduction of intramolecular twisting may have a negative influence on charge transport ability of the acceptors in the blend, thus leading to a relatively poor performance. Therefore, restricting the formation of large crystalline domains without adversely weakening the charge transport ability of the acceptors is a design principle for PDI-based acceptors.55,56 Recently, a series of research studies suggested that ring-fusion of PDI with the central core could deal with this trade off better than the counterparts without ring-fusion, resulting in a higher device performance.57–62 For instance, the effect of ring-fusion on the performances of PDI dimers bridged by thiophene, phenylene and thienothiophene linkers was investigated deeply by Wasielewski, Marks and co-workers.63 Their results illustrated that the ring-fusion is beneficial to the charge carrier generation efficiency in PDI dimers as long as they remain relatively amorphous. Yan and co-workers reported a pair of PDI-tetramers that consist of four PDI units and a tetrathienylbenzene (TTB) core.64 The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fused PDI-tetramer named FTTB-PDI4 was 10.58%, which was the highest value reported for PDI-based devices at that time. However, the best PCE of the nonfused tetramer, coded as TTB-PDI4, is only 7.11%, almost 50% lower than that of FTTB-PDI4. Very recently, the same group systematically explored the effect of ring-fusion on the performance based on three pairs of PDI-based SMAs.65 All the three ring-fused PDIs showed higher PCEs than the corresponding nonfused ones, owing to their higher average domain purity in the blends.
Thanks to the synthesis strategies of helical π-extended PDI oligomers developed by the Colin and Wang groups individually, the PDI oligomers based on ring-fused ethylene bridges exhibit remarkably high n-type mobilities and promising potential in optoelectronic devices.66–75 Recently, our group reported two helical PDI oligomer (PDI2, Scheme 1) based three-dimensional (3D) non-fullerene SMAs, coded as TPDI2 and FTPDI2, respectively (Scheme 1).76,77 The ring-fusion also shows a positive impact on the device performance, which is in accordance with the trend observed in the case of PDI-based SMAs. Motivated by the previous works done by our and other groups,68–77 herein, we describe the synthesis, optoelectronic properties and device applications of two star-shaped SMAs (TPDI3 and FTPDI3, Scheme 1) based on a longer helical PDI oligomer (PDI3, Scheme 1). PDI3 can be easily synthesized on gram-scale according to the literature. The two target molecules TPDI3 and FTPDI3 can be obtained in moderate yields and their structures were verified by NMR and mass spectra. The optoelectronic properties of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 were systematically studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to its complementary absorption and energy level with TPDI3 and FTPDI3, the commercially available PTB7-Th (Fig. S1, ESI†) was employed as the donor to fabricate OSCs with these two SMAs. Surprisingly, the nonfused TPDI3 shows a higher PCE of 8.84% than that of ring-fused FTPDI3 (7.93%), which is contrary to the trend observed in the case of PDI and PDI2 based SMAs. This unexpected trend may be ascribed to the fact that the determinative factor in device performance in the case of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 is the molecular configuration (twist angle), while the degree of conjugation in the case of PDI and PDI2 based SMAs is decisive. This counterintuitive observation suggests that when the π system of the panel units gets bigger, increased conjugation through ring fusion may cause the formation of large acceptor crystalline domains in the donor/acceptor blend, which is harmful to the device performance. In other words, the three large helical π-conjugated panel PDI3 can provide enough driving force for TPDI3 to form an ideal domain size and thus considerable and balanced charge carrier mobility, while the increased π conjugation of FTPDI3 may lead to an undesired domain. This work reveals that ring-fusion is not an appropriate strategy to improve the device performance in the case of TPDI3 and FTPDI3. Moreover, this study will provide insight into future studies on helical PDI oligomer based OSCs.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic procedure of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 is shown in Scheme 2. PDI3-Br was synthesized on gram-scale according to published procedures.66 Nonfused TPDI3 was synthesized via Suzuki coupling reactions between PDI3-Br and commercially available 1,3,5-benzenetriboronic acid tris(pinacol) ester in a yield of 49% (Scheme S1, ESI†). Thereafter, TPDI3 underwent a photocyclization reaction with a catalytic amount of iodine generating the fused structure of FTPDI3 in a 40% yield (Scheme S2, ESI†). Because of the presence of alkyl chains as well the twisted structures, both TPDI3 and FTPDI3 show very good solubility in common solvents. The two target molecules were well identified via1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ESI†). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2, ESI†), which gave the decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 under a nitrogen atmosphere of over 320 °C, implied that both of these two compounds possess good thermal stability.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to gain insight into the chemical geometry structures as well as molecular frontier orbitals of TPDI3 and FTPDI3. The optimized geometries of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 are illustrated in Fig. 1a and b with the front (top panel) and side view (middle panel), respectively. Both of them have three helical branches of conjugated tri-PDI linked to the central benzene-ring. The difference between these two molecules is that each branch of TPDI3 only has one C–C single bond linking to the meta-position of the central benzene ring, while each branch of FTPDI3 is fully conjugated to the central benzene. TPDI3 has C3 symmetry, whereas FTPDI3 has D3 symmetry. The dihedral angles α1, α2, and α3 for TPDI3 and β1, β2, and β3 for FTPDI3 are defined as the angles between the central benzene and the nearest fragment, the angles between the nearest fragment and the middle fragment, and the angles between the middle fragment and the terminal fragment, respectively (Fig. 1a and b). The values are α1 = 52.6°, α2 = 38.8°, α3 = 37.3°, β1 = 30.0°, β2 = 36.3°, and β3 = 37.5°. In other words, TPDI3 possesses a more twisted configuration than FTPDI3.

The HOMOs and LUMOs of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It should be noted that the energy of the HOMOs and LUMOs of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 are doubly degenerate, respectively, due to their symmetrical geometries. Similar to the previously reported π-conjugated PDIs, the HOMOs are mainly formed as π-orbital arrays in alternating patterns around each central six-membered-ring of the PDI fragment, whereas the LUMOs are primarily composed as π* orbitals. One should also note that the HOMOs and LUMOs of FTPDI3 show dispersion features compared to that of TPDI3, indicating the larger π-conjugation geometry of FTPDI3. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies as well as the energy gaps of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The E(HOMO) of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 is −5.738 and −5.732 eV, respectively, in agreement with the experiment. The discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental energy gap results from the deviation of the E(LUMO). This may also indicate that the energy gap of these molecules is not simply the difference between the HOMO–LUMO energies.
Optoelectronic properties
The optical properties of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 were determined via UV-vis absorption and emission spectrometry while the electrochemical properties were measured via CV. As shown in Fig. 2a, in the film state, TPDI3 shows broad absorptions in the UV-vis region range from 350 to 650 nm with a long-wavelength absorption maximum at 584 nm. The absorption spectrum of FTPDI3 shows an obvious red shift compared to that of TPDI3, which can be ascribed to its relatively larger π-conjugation structure. The molar extinction coefficient of TPDI3 at 584 nm was estimated to be 1.98 × 105 M−1 cm−1 according to the absorption spectrum in dilute solution, which is higher than that of FTPDI3 at 600 nm (Fig. S4a, ESI† and Table 1). The optical bandgaps were calculated to be 2.04 and 1.97 eV for TPDI3 and FTPDI3, respectively (Table 1). The CV patterns of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the measurements were carried out in dry dichloromethane at room temperature. TPDI3 shows five reversible reduction waves while four quasi-reversible reduction waves are noticed for FTPDI3 in the voltage range from −0.60 to −1.60 V. However, no oxidation waves were observed for both TPDI3 and FTPDI3 upon an anodic scan up to 2.00 V. The LUMO levels of TPDI3 and FTPDI3 were established to be −3.81 and −3.82 eV, respectively, based on their reduction onsets of CV curves (Table 1). From the difference between the LUMO and optical bandgaps, the HOMO levels were calculated to be −5.85 and −5.79 eV for TPDI3 and FTPDI3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, both non-fullerene SMAs possess well-aligned energy levels with PTB7-Th, combining with their complementary UV-vis absorption spectra, illustrating that PTB7-Th is a suitable electron donor for constructing the OSC devices.

Organic solar cell performance
These two helical PDIs were subsequently applied for photovoltaic characterization using PTB7-Th as an electron donor. The inverted device configuration of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. S1, ESI†) was employed. The photovoltaic performance of the devices based on PTB7-Th:TPDI3 (or FTPDI3) blends was optimized following several procedures, film thickness modulation, donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio optimization, annealing temperature regulation, and additive effect investigation. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2 and Tables S2–S4 (ESI†) and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best cells under illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The results indicate that the optimal D:A weight ratio is 1:1, which was kept for all subsequent devices (Table S2, ESI†) and the addition of the DIO additive has no positive effect on the performance of the devices (Tables S3 and S4, ESI†). As shown in Table 2, the as-cast PTB7-Th:TPDI3 devices exhibit a considerable PCE of 8.68%, much higher than that of the FTPDI3-based device (6.85%). After thermal annealing (TA) at 80 °C for 10 min, the PCE of PTB7-Th:TPDI3 was slightly increased to 8.84% due to the enhanced values of Voc and Jsc. The PCE distribution of the optimized devices based on PTB7-Th:TPDI3 and PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 is presented in Fig. S6 (ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.84% is among the highest PCE of helical PDI oligomer based OSCs (Table S5, ESI†). Meanwhile, obvious improvements were observed in the PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 based devices after TA treatment. These results indicate that the PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 based devices are more sensitive to the fabricating temperature. Thus, with respect to the practical application, TPDI3 is a more promising SMA candidate than FTPDI3.

To further analyze and confirm the accuracy of J–V measurements as well as the high Jsc values, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimal devices based on PTB7-Th:TPDI3 (or FTPDI3) blends were recorded, as shown in Fig. 3b. Both devices display broad photo-responses covering the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm, which corresponds to the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptors. Moreover, these devices show superior EQE values of about 80% between 550 nm and 700 nm, which indicates the highly efficient photon harvesting and charge collection for the OSCs. It is noteworthy that the EQE value of the TPDI3 based device is slightly higher than that of the FTPDI3 based one ranging from 630 nm to 720 nm, which is due to the contribution of PTB7-Th. Thus, it is not attributed to the light absorption but possibly to the charge transport procedure.78 The Jsc values calculated using the EQE spectra are 17.04 mA cm−2 and 17.06 mA cm−2 for TPDI3 and FTPDI3, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†), which are consistent with the data obtained from J–V measurements within a 5% mismatch.
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements were carried out to investigate the charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S6 (ESI†), the neat films of TPDI3, FTPDI3 and PTB7-Th exhibit broad emission bands. The PL quenching efficiencies of PTB7-Th:TPDI3 blends were calculated to be 98.4% and 94.4% as compared to the neat TPDI3 and PTB7-Th films, respectively. The quenching efficiencies of PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 blends were slightly lower (97.7% refers to FTPDI3 and 93.0% refers to PTB7-Th) than that of PTB7-Th:TPDI3 blends, which could explain the relatively higher PCE of the TPDI3 based devices. To explore the bimolecular recombination kinetics of the OSC devices, the curves of Jsc values versus light intensity (Plight) were obtained, as shown in Fig. S9a (ESI†). In Jsc–light intensity measurements, the Jsc should follow a power law relationship as Jsc ∝ Pαlight.67 If the value of α approaches 1, it implies weak bimolecular recombination and the free carriers can be collected efficiently by the electrodes. The S value of the TPDI3 based device was calculated to be 0.98, which is higher than that of the FTPDI3 based one, indicating a weaker bimolecular recombination. These results illustrate that devices based on TPDI3 possess more efficient exciton dissociation and weaker bimolecular recombination than those based on FTPDI3, leading to a higher PCE. In comparison to TPDI3 based devices, thermal annealing endowed a greater improvement in the PCE of FTPDI3 based devices. The dependence of Voc on light intensity measurements of the as cast and thermal annealed devices based on FTPDI3 were conducted to evaluate the carrier recombination behavior (Fig. S9b, ESI†). Both linear relationships were fit to Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight).79 It is reported that if the value of n approaches 1, this implies that the device only has bimolecular recombination, while n equal to 2 illustrates that the trap-assisted recombination dominates in the devices. As shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†), the n values are 1.67 and 1.24 for the as cast and thermally annealed devices, respectively. This result indicated that thermal annealing could decrease the trap-assisted recombination in FTPDI3 based devices.
To gain further insight into the charge transfer kinetics of the devices, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the hole and electron mobilities of the TPDI3 and FTPDI3 based devices. The structures of the hole-only and electron-only devices were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blends/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/blends/LiF/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, the FTPDI3 based blends exhibit considerably high hole and electron mobilities with a magnitude of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is rare for PDI-based blends. However, a more balanced hole/electron mobility (μe/μh = 1.8) of TPDI3 based blends was observed than that of FTPDI3 based blends (μe/μh = 2.6), which results in a slightly higher Jsc and fill factor (FF).

The surface morphologies of the PTB7-Th:TPDI3 and PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 blend films were investigated via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As observed from the AFM images in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the root-mean-square (RMS) values for the as-cast TPDI3 and FTPDI3 based blend films are 0.750 and 0.824 nm, respectively. After TA treatment at 80 °C for 10 min, slight decreases in the RMS values were observed, indicating a better miscibility of donor and acceptor. However, the blend films treated with 1% DIO exhibit larger RMS levels, which means that the addition of DIO has a negative influence on the formation of appropriate domains. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the TEM results are consistent with the AFM observations. The as cast PTB7-Th:TPDI3 blend films show a non-uniform and featureless morphology (Fig. S11a, ESI†). After TA treatment, a slight amelioration in the morphology was observed (Fig. S11b, ESI†). As for FTPDI3, a large domain size was detected in the as-cast blend films, as shown in Fig. S11c (ESI†); this might be ascribed to the large π-conjugation but mismatched extent of intramolecular twisting of FTPDI3. However, the oversized domains disappeared after TA treatment (Fig. S11d, ESI†), together with the decrease in the trap-assisted recombination (vide supra), resulting in an obvious improvement in the device performance.
Conclusion
In summary, two new helical PDI (PDI3) based nonfused and fused SMAs, TPDI3 and FTPDI3, have been designed, synthesized and characterized. Both SMAs exhibit bright prospects for photovoltaic device applications. Using the commercially available PTB7-Th as an electron donor, the nonfused TPDI3-based device shows a higher PCE of 8.84% than the fused FTPDI3 based one (7.93%). This result is antithetical to the trend reported in previous studies that the ring-fusion of PDI with the central core could improve the performance of the devices. This counterintuitive result can be rationalized by the fact that TPDI3 could achieve a better balance in maintaining appropriate self-aggregation and suppressing the formation of large crystalline domains. The AFM and TEM results as well as the PL quenching measurements illustrate that TPDI3 can form more favorable domain sizes and better miscibility with PTB7-Th than FTPDI3 does, even though it possesses a more twisted configuration. These results reveal that ring-fusion is not an appropriate strategy to improve the performance in the case of TPDI3 and FTPDI3. We believe that this study will pave the way for the reasonable design of new helical PDI oligomer based SMAs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of TPDI3
To a mixture of monobromo-PDI3 (PDI3-Br, 400 mg, 0.168 mmol), 1,3,5-benzenetriboronic acid tris(pinacol) ester (1, 21.2 mg, 0.046 mmol), Na2CO3 (1 g), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (30 mg, 0.026 mmol) in a microwave tube, degassed THF/H2O (4:1, 20 mL) was added. The reaction was performed by using a microwave reactor at 80 °C for 2 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with DCM and washed with water. Then, the solution was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude solid was purified via silica gel chromatography (eluted with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 from 1:1 to 1:3), and further recrystallization with CH2Cl2/methanol afforded the target molecule TPDI3 as a dark red laminar solid (159 mg, 49%). 1H NMR (500 MHz) δ 10.91 (s, 11H), 10.58 (s, 11H), 10.21 (s, 2H), 9.79 (s, 1H), 9.51 (s, 8H), 9.12 (d, J = 84.3 Hz, 12H), 8.66 (s, 3H), 5.40 (s, 6H), 5.27 (s, 12H), 2.29 (s, 36H), 1.97 (s, 36H), 1.21 (s, 288H), 0.77 (s, 108H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) δ 165.34, 165.19, 164.97, 164.87, 164.20, 163.84, 163.63, 134.10, 127.46, 127.31, 126.97, 126.30, 125.95, 124.97, 124.43, 123.97, 122.18, 55.56, 55.46, 55.19, 55.02, 32.67, 32.48, 31.82, 31.73, 29.71, 29.33, 27.22, 27.12, 26.96, 22.65, 22.52, 14.09, 13.93.

Synthesis of FTPDI3

TPDI3 (370 mg, 0.529 mmol) was dissolved in 400 mL of toluene in a 500 mL round bottom flask, and 200 mg of I2 was added. The reaction mixture solution was drawn into a home-built flow reactor. The reaction mixture was repeatedly pumped using the flow reactor with a retention time of 72 hours. The solvent was removed using a vacuum rotary evaporator and the crude residue was washed with methanol to remove excessive iodine. The crude red solid was then purified using a silica gel column with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 as an eluent. And the final product of FTPDI3 was obtained as a red solid (150 mg, 40%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 11.39 (s, 8H), 11.04 (s, 10H), 10.77 (s, 8H), 10.46 (s, 3H), 9.60 (s, 6H), 9.31 (s, 7H), 5.53 (d, J = 94.3 Hz, 18H), 2.54 (d, J = 71.6 Hz, 36H), 2.11 (d, J = 74.5 Hz, 36H), 1.31 (s, 288H), 0.87 (s, 108H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3) δ 165.05, 164.39, 134.14, 127.42, 127.06, 125.99, 125.11, 124.73, 124.48, 123.99, 122.42, 55.64, 55.25, 32.68, 31.90, 31.85, 29.42, 29.36, 27.29, 27.15, 22.70, 22.67, 14.11, 14.08.

Device fabrication
The inverted devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The pre-patterned (sheet resistance, 15 Ω sq−1) ITO-glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent (Alconox Inc.), de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The oven-dried substrates were then treated with an oxygen plasma (180 W) for 5 min. The ZnO precursor solution (110 mg mL−1) was prepared by dissolving 0.22 g of ZnAc2·2H2O in 2 mL of 2-methoxyethanol and 0.056 mL of ethanol amine and then stirred for at least 24 h before use. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate with a spinning rate of 5000 rpm for 60 s and the thickness was ∼32 nm. The as-cast film was then annealed under an ambient environment at 150 °C for 60 min to form a compact ZnO layer. The blend solutions of PTB7-Th:TPDI3 and PTB7-Th:FTPDI3 (D/A ratio, 1:1, weight ratio) were all processed using o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with an identical concentration of 20 mg mL−1. All these solutions were heated at 60 °C and stirred overnight (or 100 °C for 3 h) to obtain well-mixed blend solutions. The active layer thicknesses of these three devices were carefully optimized using the spinning rate variation (1200, 1500, 1800, 2000 and 2500 rpm). And, the spinning duration was fixed at 50 s. The active layers were thermally annealed at 80 °C in a glove box for 10 min to get rid of the residual solvent. A MoO3 (8 nm) layer and a Ag layer (100 nm) electrode were sequentially deposited via thermal evaporation using a shadow mask under a vacuum of <1.0 × 10−4 Pa. The effective device area, defined by the overlap region of ITO and Ag electrodes, was 0.0625 cm2.
The J–V measurements were conducted under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an AAA solar simulator (SP94023A-SR1, NEWPORT). The illumination intensity was calculated using a standard photovoltaic cell (91150V), which incorporated a quartz window (1000P072). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using an EQE system (Zolix, China). The film thicknesses were determined on a Bruker Dektak XT Stylus Profiling System.
