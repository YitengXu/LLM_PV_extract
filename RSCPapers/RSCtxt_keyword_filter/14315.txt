    , Accepted 18th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractInorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as one of the promising devices for green energy. Bifacial-illuminated solar cells have been studied for many practical applications such as in wearable electronics and building window devices. p-Type transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) are highly desired for efficient bifacial-illuminated solar cells. However, the preparation of p-type TCOs usually requires high power sputtering and high temperature processes, and the thus-prepared TCOs can hardly be applied to PSCs due to the vulnerability of perovskites. In this study, p-type Cu/Cu2O (CCO) composite films are developed for bifacial-illuminated PSCs. The p-type CCO composite films can be easily prepared by sputtering at room temperature and do not damage the underlying organic materials Spiro-OMeTAD and perovskites. With a reduced film thickness of about 12 nm, the p-type CCO films can be employed as transparent conductive films in PSCs. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.10% and 9.37% have been achieved for bifacial PSCs illuminated via the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and CCO sides, respectively. In addition, the CCO films are stable under ambient conditions and can serve as a protection layer for PSCs. Therefore, ultra-thin p-type CCO films are promising candidates for applications in bifacial-illuminated, efficient and stable PSCs under ambient conditions.
Introduction
There are different types of light-absorbing materials for solar cells among which perovskite is one of the most widely studied materials because of its advantages of a direct bandgap, ambipolar transport, long exciton diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and high absorption coefficient.1–6 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are nowadays one of the fastest-growing light harvesting devices for solar energy. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to 22.7% in just six years.7,8 To meet many future applications such as in wearable electronics9 and window and building integrated photovoltaics,10–12 bifacial-illuminated devices are highly desired. Bifacial-illuminated solar cells can absorb light on both sides by virtue of highly transmissive and conductive transparent conductive materials. Additionally, simple synthesis and low-cost process are necessary for their practical applications. Notably, the preparation of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) usually requires high power sputtering and/or high temperature annealing processes,13–15 which are not compatible with the integration of PSCs. Different types of transparent electrodes for PSCs have been developed in recent years. The initial electrodes were non-metallic transparent electrodes such as carbon nanotubes,16 graphene,17 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).18 Although their transmissions and conductivities were lower than those of TCOs, bifacial-illuminated solar cells employing non-metallic transparent electrodes exhibited remarkable efficiencies. Unfortunately, their preparation requires complicated processes such as etching and transferring to cover the perovskite active layer. Long-term decline in adhesion may also cause the transparent electrode to peel-off from the cell. The second electrodes were ultra-thin metal transparent electrodes. Eperon et al.19,20 and Roldan et al.21 reported the use of ultra-thin Au (≤10 nm) as a transparent electrode to achieve bifacial-illuminated PSCs. However, the PCEs were still low due to low transmission of ultra-thin Au, and the high cost of the noble metal was also a limitation. Moreover, transparent conductive electrodes in the form of multilayer structures, such as MoO3/Au/MoO3,22 PEIE/Ag/MoOx,23 and BCP/Ag/MoO3,24 have been developed for bifacial-illuminated PSCs. The multilayer electrodes serve as anti-reflection films to enhance the light transmission.25 The complicated process and high cost are the main concerns for their further application in PSCs. It is also noted that metal electrodes, such as aluminium (Al), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) electrodes, can diffuse into the perovskite active area and strongly react with perovskites.26–28 The products, such as AgI and AuI, of the chemical reaction are responsible for the poor stability of PSCs.
Zhao et al. have reported the use of copper (Cu) as an electrode in perovskite solar cells.29 In encapsulated PSCs, which limit the exposure of the device to oxygen and moisture, Cu in direct contact with CH3NH3PbI3 shows no reaction and is predicted to be very stable at a nominal operating cell temperature of 40 °C. However, when the cell is exposed to ambient conditions, Cu can diffuse into the perovskite active layer and react with perovskite to form copper iodide (CuI).
The inorganic hole-transport material Cu2O is a promising candidate for perovskite solar cells since the device containing it exhibits a promising efficiency of over 25% by simulation.30 In addition to high hole mobility, Cu2O has a well-matched energy level with perovskite.31 Due to high resistivity, Cu2O cannot directly be used as an electrode in PSCs. In this study, we report the use of ultra-thin Cu/Cu2O composite films as transparent conductive electrodes for perovskite solar cells. The Cu/Cu2O composite film takes advantage of the good conductivity of Cu29 and the remarkable hole mobility and long charge diffusion length (10 μm) of Cu2O.32–34 By controlling the composition and thickness, the transmission and conductivity of the Cu/Cu2O composite electrode have been optimized to achieve efficient perovskite solar cells. Because of the room-temperature growth process, the Cu/Cu2O composite films can be applied to PSCs without any damage to perovskite. The PCEs of 14.10% and 9.37% have been achieved for the bifacial-illuminated PSC devices when one sun AM 1.5G illumination was incident on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) side and Cu/Cu2O side, respectively. Furthermore, the use of Cu/Cu2O effectively provided great protection to perovskite against moisture and air, and the resultant device delivered long term stability for over 29 testing days.
Results and discussion
Room-temperature (∼30 °C)-processed Cu/Cu2O films
The Cu/Cu2O composite films were obtained by ion-beam sputtering on a copper target with a control of argon and oxygen flow ratio (OFR). During ion-beam sputtering, the substrate was maintained at room temperature. At first, we studied the transmission and conductivity of the Cu/Cu2O composite films as a function of composition and structure. The structures and orientations of the Cu/Cu2O composite films on glasses were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Hall-effect measurement results have been reported in our previous study.36 For clarity, these data are provided in the ESI.† The diffraction from pure Cu in the absence of oxygen is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) for comparison. The characteristic peaks at 43.4°, 50.45°, and 74.05° can be assigned to diffraction from the Cu(111), (200), and (220) planes, respectively (JCPDS card number: 04-0836). When OFR was increased in the range of 10–50%, the intensity of the Cu phase weakened, whereas the peaks corresponding to Cu2O gradually intensified. The Cu2O(111) peak became more prominent, and Cu phases diminished as the OFR increased to 50%. When the OFR reached 60%, there were no visible Cu diffraction peaks, and the Cu2O(220) phase dominated (JCPDS card number: 77-0199). Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the SEM images the of Cu/Cu2O composite films under different OFR growth conditions. For an OFR < 30% (Fig. S2(b and c), ESI†), the topography of the Cu/Cu2O composite is similar to the rough surface of pure Cu, as shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). Owing to the difference in the contrast between Cu and Cu2O, a few bright spots were observed for the OFR ranging from 30 to 50%, as shown in Fig. S2(d–f) (ESI†). Smooth morphology with negligible number of bright spots was observed for the Cu/Cu2O composite film with an OFR of 60% (Fig. S2(g), ESI†); this indicated that most Cu was oxidized to form Cu2O. Additionally, the sputtering rates of Cu/Cu2O composite films at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% OFR were 0.059, 0.063, 0.064, 0.068, 0.067, and 0.062 nm s−1, respectively, as estimated from the cross-sectional SEM images (cf. inset of Fig. S2, ESI†). The phase transformation in the Cu/Cu2O composite films with the varying OFR was clearly evidenced by color change in the thick deposited films, as described in the ESI,† Table S1.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm was conducted to determine the light transmission of Cu/Cu2O composite films with varied thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 1. On an average, the transmissions of films in the OFR range of 40–60% were much higher than those with the OFR ≤ 30%. Notably, the transmission of the Cu/Cu2O composite films increased with a reduction in film thickness. For samples with an OFR of 40–60%, transmission was about 60% for a 20 nm-thick film and increased to approximately 90% for a 4 nm-thick film. However, the 4 nm thick films had very high sheet resistivities to be used as electrodes for PSCs. It is worth mentioning that the transmission of the 12 nm thick films (at a sputtering time of 3 min) is close to that of the commercial FTO glass (Fig. 1(b) green line). The band gap of the Cu/Cu2O composite films was estimated by conducting UV-vis spectroscopy, and a plot of (αhν)2vs. the energy of absorbed light is shown in Fig. 1(d). The band gaps obtained from the intersection for the Cu/Cu2O composite films with 30, 40, 50, and 60% OFRs were 1.85, 2.0, 2.12, and 2.2 eV, respectively. The bump around 2 eV might be ascribed to the free electron response of Cu metal. The UV-vis spectrum also suggests the increasing of Cu2O ratio with the OFR in Cu/Cu2O composite films.

The electrical properties of Cu/Cu2O composite films of 10 and 20 nm were analyzed by Hall-effect measurements using a four-point probe method with fields up to 6000 Oe at room temperature, and the results are provided in Table 1 and ESI,† Fig. S3 and Table S2. For OFRs less than 30%, the composite films displayed n-type electrical behaviors due to large proportion of metal Cu. For OFRs higher than 40%, the fraction of Cu2O in the films gradually increased, and the Cu/Cu2O composite films displayed a p-type electrical behavior. For the OFR of 50%, the resistance of the film was thrice that for an OFR of 40%. Furthermore, the Cu/Cu2O composite film with an OFR of 60% was nearly insulating because of the dominance of Cu2O. The electrical measurements were well consistent with the structural trend probed by XRD. Based on the transmission and electrical properties, the Cu/Cu2O composite films grown at around 40% with a thickness of about 10 nm were found to be most suitable for p-type transparent electrodes.

We further investigated the energy levels of Cu/Cu2O composite films using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The band alignment and the relative position of the Fermi levels to the valence band maximum (ΔEVB) of the Cu/Cu2O composite films with an OFR 40% were probed, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows the magnified UPS spectra around the valence band region marked by a red frame in the inset. The Au metal was employed to calibrate the Fermi energy level position (EF) to 0 eV, and the obtained ΔEVB of the OFR 40% film was 0.57 eV. The work function of the Cu/Cu2O film with a 40% OFR was estimated by UPS. Fig. 2(b) shows the measured cut-off spectra for secondary photoelectrons of UPS. To detect the secondary photoelectrons with low kinetic energy, a negative bias of 5 V was applied on the sample during measurements. The onset of secondary photoelectrons was evaluated by linear extrapolation to the measured spectra. As a result, the work function of the film was determined to be −4.59 eV. The energy level of the composite film can be further calculated with a valence band maximum (VBM) of −5.16 eV. The band gap (Eg) determined from UV-vis characterization was 2.0 eV (Fig. 1(d)), and therefore, the conduction band minimum (CBM) was −3.16 eV. The energy level diagram of the 40% OFR film and the device energy diagram are plotted in Fig. 2(c). The results showed that the VBM of p-type Cu/Cu2O composite film (OFR 40%) matched well with that of perovskite.

Bifacial-illuminated devices
In this study, the device architecture of bifacial-illuminated PSCs was based on the n–i–p heterojunction configuration composed of FTO/compact (cp) TiO2/mesoporous (mp) TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Cu/Cu2O. The active layer of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was prepared by solvent engineering,35 whereas Cu/Cu2O electrodes were grown by sputtering on a Cu target with varied OFRs. The sample was maintained at room temperature during the sputtering process. The active area for measurement was 0.09 cm2 as defined by a metal mask.
Because of the good conductivity and decent light transmission of Cu/Cu2O composite films, they were employed as p-type transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrodes for the back illumination window in PSCs. Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c) show the schematic structures of bifacial illuminated PSCs, cross-sectional SEM image, and real images of the 12 nm-thick Cu/Cu2O film (OFR = 40%) and the corresponding device applying the Cu/Cu2O electrode, respectively. Because of high hole mobility in Cu/Cu2O and energy-matching between Cu/Cu2O and Spiro-OMeTAD, the Cu/Cu2O layer facilitated hole transport without energy loss. Additionally, since the CBM of Spiro-OMeTAD was much higher than those of perovskite and Cu/Cu2O, the Spiro-OMeTAD effectively blocked the electron carrier to prevent electron–hole recombination at the Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface. The performance of the as-fabricated PSCs illuminated from the FTO side and the Cu/Cu2O side depended on the thickness of Cu/Cu2O, as shown in Fig. 4(a and b). The bifacial-illuminated device with 20 nm Cu/Cu2O (40% OFR) had a PCE of 12.04%, along with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.61 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 61% when illuminated from the FTO side. On the other hand, a PCE of 4.94% was obtained along with a Jsc of 8.24 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and an FF of 69% when the device was illuminated from the Cu/Cu2O side. When the Cu/Cu2O film thickness was reduced to 12 nm, the bifacial-illuminated device exhibited a PCE of 14.1% with a Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.95 V, and an FF of 66% when illuminated from the FTO side; however, a PCE of 9.37% with a Jsc of 14.94 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.93 V, and an FF of 67% was obtained when the device was illuminated from the Cu/Cu2O side. Compared with the PSCs with multilayer transparent electrodes, Cu/Cu2O-based PSCs showed a comparable performance, as summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). Notably, the preparation of the Cu/Cu2O composition layer was much easier and economical.

(c) IPCE response of the cell with optimized Cu/Cu2O thickness when the device is illuminated from the FTO and Cu/Cu2O sides. The current density calculated from the IPCE spectrum integrated with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum is added for comparison. 
When the film thickness of Cu/Cu2O was further reduced to about 4 nm, the device exhibited poor PCE owing to poor conductivity presumably caused by the incomplete coverage of Cu/Cu2O. The Cu/Cu2O film thickness of over 10 nm was favorable to fully cover the underlying Spiro-OMeTAD and facilitate hole extraction. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of these devices are tabulated in Table 2. Fig. 4(c) shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) response of the bifacial-illuminated device with a 12 nm thick Cu/Cu2O film (40% OFR) for light incidence from the FTO and Cu/Cu2O sides. The Jsc obtained from the IPCE spectrum integrated with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum was respectively 21.06 and 13.61 mA cm−2 when the device was illuminated from the FTO side and Cu/Cu2O side, which were comparable with the experimental Jsc. It was noted that the IPCE measured from the FTO side decreased in the wavelength range of 600–750 nm mainly due to transmission loss of the Cu/Cu2O electrode, whereas the lower IPCE response for the device illuminated from the Cu/Cu2O side mainly resulted from the reflection of Cu/Cu2O and absorption of Spiro-OMeTAD. The statistical PCE for 12 bifacial-illuminated devices (OFR = 40%) from FTO and Cu/Cu2O side are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The device efficiency for FTO-side illumination was ∼11–12%, whereas that for the Cu/Cu2O side-illumination was ∼6.6–8%, demonstrating the reproducibility of the bifacial-illuminated devices.

Finally, we discussed the effect of oxygen flow rate during the growth of Cu/Cu2O films (∼12 nm) on the performance of the bifacial-illuminated PSCs. The J–V characteristics of PSCs illuminated from the FTO and Cu/Cu2O sides using Cu/Cu2O composite films with different OFRs are displayed in Fig. 5(a and b), respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 3. With an increase in OFR, although the transmittance of the Cu/Cu2O film improved slightly due to an increase in the Cu2O content, the resistivity was significantly enhanced; this in turn strongly suppressed the photocurrent and efficiency.

Stability test
We traced the normalized efficiencies of the encapsulated devices including the PSC using a Cu/Cu2O transparent electrode. The result is illustrated in Fig. 6. For the devices stored in dark, the device using the Cu/Cu2O transparent electrode revealed long-term stability of up to 29 testing days. The ESI,† Fig. S5 shows the images of the PSC using Ag and Cu/Cu2O as electrodes that were stored in the dark for 55 days. The perovskite using the Ag electrode was severely degraded and was brown and yellow in color due to the reaction of Ag with perovskite. There was no change in the color of the perovskite using the Cu/Cu2O electrode. The results demonstrated that the Cu/Cu2O composite film was a promising transparent conductive electrode for bifacial-illuminated PSCs and also served as a protection layer for the perovskite active layer against erosion of the metal electrode.

Experimental
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
FTO glass was etched with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid (1 M) to house two electrodes, which were cleaned with ultrasonic soap, water, and ethanol bath and then rinsed with deionized water. A 70 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer (cp-TiO2) was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) precursor solution diluted in ethanol (1:39 v:v) at 485 °C for 30 min. This was followed by the deposition of a 20 mM TiCl4 solution layer, which functioned as an electron transport layer (ETL). The mesoporous TiO2 layer (mp-TiO2) was formed by spin-coating a diluted TiO2 solution (1:8.5 v:v) at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was prepared inside a nitrogen-filled glove box with oxygen and moisture levels <1 ppm by mixing 0.288 g CH3NH3I (dyesol, 99.99%) with 0.831 g PbI2 (Aldrich, 99.999%, ultra-dry) in a 1:1 equimolar ratio. The components were dissolved in a mixture of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (6:4 v:v) and heated at 50 °C under stirring for 12 h for complete dissolution. CH3NH3PbI3 was then spin-coated on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate at 1000 rpm for 10 s and at 5000 rpm for 30 s; the anti-solvent toluene was injected for 15 s in the second spin step. The spin-coated perovskite film was dried at 100 °C for 10 min to remove toluene. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 17.5 μL of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (from a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 of Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (Aldrich, 99.8%)) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was then spin coated on the MAPbI3 substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s. An ion beam sputtering system was used to deposit the Cu/Cu2O films. The vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 2.2 × 10−6 Torr. A copper substrate (99.99% purity) was used as the sputtering target. The Cu/Cu2O films were grown at room temperature (∼30 °C) with different Ar and O2 flow rates with working pressure ranging from 1.0 × 10−4 Torr to 4.0 × 10−4 Torr. Finally, the Cu/Cu2O films were deposited on Spiro-OMeTAD to form the counter electrode. For the device without Cu/Cu2O, a 60 nm-thick silver layer was thermally evaporated on Spiro-OMeTAD as the counter electrode.
Characterization
The crystallographic properties of the films were determined by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, D8, Bruker, Germany) at room temperature with a scanning step size of 0.005°. The surface morphologies and cross-sections of the samples were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SUPRA™ 55). Optical transmittance spectra were obtained using a UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer (HITACHI U4100) at a fixed incidence angle perpendicular to the film surface in the range of 300–900 nm. The FTO glass was used as a reference for transmittance measurements. The carrier type, carrier concentration, and electrical resistivity were measured using a four-terminal van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. The UPS experiment was performed at beamline 24A of the Taiwan Light Source at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC). A microscopic PL system (MRI, Protrustech Co., Ltd, Taiwan) was used to determine the band gap of the films with a pump wavelength of 532 nm. The J–V measurement was performed using a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) with AM 1.5G spectrum, and the device was connected to a source meter (Keithley 2401) to obtain the J–V data. The light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 using reference silicon solar cells. The scan rate was 0.14 V s−1 for the forward scan (from Jsc to Voc). A metal mask with an aperture size of 0.09 cm2 was used to define the active area. A 300 W intensity monochromatic (Newport Cornerstone 260) xenon lamp (Newport) and a source meter (Keithley 2401) were integrated to measure the IPCE responses of the devices.

By precisely controlling the oxygen flow rate during ion beam sputtering on Cu targets, composite films with varying Cu/Cu2O contents were prepared. The Cu/Cu2O ratio tuned the electrical properties such as resistivity of the film. In addition, the energy level of p-type Cu/Cu2O matched that of perovskite. The p-type Cu/Cu2O films were further integrated with the perovskite solar cell with an n–i–p heterojunction configuration. A 12 nm thick p-type Cu/Cu2O film prepared with an OFR = 40% was employed as a transparent electrode for bifacial-illuminated perovskite solar cells. PCEs of 14.10% and 9.37% were obtained when the device was illuminated from the FTO and Cu/Cu2O sides, respectively. Additionally, the Cu/Cu2O films can effectively protect the perovskite active layer and greatly enhance the lifetime of PSCs.
