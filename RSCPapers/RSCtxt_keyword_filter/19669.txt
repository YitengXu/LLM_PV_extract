    , Accepted 17th December 2018First published on 18th December 2018AbstractMolybdenum oxides have emerged as an important entity for optoelectronics due to their wide band gap and carrier-selective transportation property. However, there is little progress in the development of high-performance molybdenum oxide based photodetectors. Herein, a fast response and high detectivity (∼1.27 × 1013 Jones) photodetector based on the asymmetric heterojunction of MoO3−x/Si with a nanoporous pyramid array (NPPA) Si structure was reported. The device shows a broad linear dynamic range (LDR) over 116.6 dB and bandwidth over 50 kHz. Furthermore, the temperature-dependence of photoresponse was systematically investigated to probe the carrier transportation within the heterojunction. A model is proposed in which carrier diffusion dominates the photoresponse performance. Finally, the temperature-resistant NPPA based heterojunction photodetector is successfully integrated into a visible light communication system and its application as an optical signal receiver for transmitting texts is demonstrated. These findings suggest that our transition metal oxide based asymmetric heterojunction photodetectors have great application potential in optical communication.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) can convert optical signal into electrical signal, which is a critical component for imaging and optical communication applications. Especially, PDs with intelligent characteristics1–5 are important for other optoelectronic nano-systems. Most of the commercially available photodetectors are currently based on a p–i–n device architecture, which usually needs high temperature treatment, doping, and complicated manufacturing processes. Recently, due to their unique optoelectronic and structural properties,6–8 high-efficient photodetectors based on mixed-dimensional heterojunctions have been extensively studied as an alternative to traditional semiconductors in photodetection. Typical configurations of heterojunctions include quantum dots/graphene (0D/2D),9 CNT/ZnO core–shell (1D/1D),10 van der Waals heterostructures (2D/2D),11 and carbon nanotube/graphene (1D/2D).12 Such mixed-dimensional heterostructures herald opportunities for investigating fundamental nanoscience and developing nanoscale optoelectronic applications. However, limited by weak light absorption, low carrier mobility, and incompatibility with commercial silicon electronics, most of the reported photodetectors exhibit low response speed under bias, along with low photoelectrical conversion efficiency (PCE), hampering the practical applications in optical communication systems. Hence, the fabrication of a heterojunction by combing low-dimensional materials with traditional bulk semiconductors is one promising strategy for constructing high-performance optoelectronic devices. For example, the fabricated hybrid graphene/silicon heterojunction PD shows a bandwidth of 40 GHz.13 Additionally, Jie's group reported a solution-processed 3D RGO-MoS2/Si heterojunction PD showing an ultra-broadband photoresponse (350 nm to 4.3 μm).14
One promising way to enhance the photodetecting performance is by manipulating the geometry of heterojunctions for higher light-absorption efficiency.10,15 By optimizing the geometry of the heterostructure, both the efficiencies of light-trapping and carrier-collection are expected to be largely improved. Additionally, the use of dopant-free asymmetric heterocontacts with transition metal oxides (TMOs) was reported to be another effective way of improving the PCE of n-type silicon heterojunctions,16,17 because molybdenum oxide shows weak Coulomb scattering and high hole-mobility.18,19 The reported maximum PCE of MoO3−x/n-Si solar cells20 has already surpassed their silicon homojunction counterpart.21 It is interesting to note that TMO serves as a bi-functional layer that can effectively passivate the Si surface while selectively conducting holes.22 Molybdenum oxides have been successfully applied in various applications, such as solar cells,21–23 photodetectors,24 and light emitting diodes.25 However, PDs based on molybdenum oxides have shown little progress due to their lower than expected photoresponsivity and response speed. Furthermore, the reported response speed ranges from ten μs to hundreds of ms, along with a narrow bandwidth, which greatly limited their application in optical communication. It has been reported that PDs based on MoO3 nanobelts show a typical response speed of a few minutes. The reason is usually ascribed to the low carrier concentration, low carrier separation efficiency, and high rate of surface recombination.24,26 It was reported that hierarchical MoO3−x/n-Si heterojunctions with photovoltaic mode show promising potential in high-speed photodetectors.27 Unfortunately, the hierarchical structure exhibits poor mechanical properties as Si nanowires can be easily damaged under stress. It is of great importance to design more unique architectures with robust structures, and further demonstrate the practical applications of the unique heterojunction photodetector. Visible light communication is becoming an alternative choice for indoor wireless technology by offering low cost, unregulated bandwidth and ubiquitous infrastructure support. Most heterojunction PDs exhibit a low response speed from micro-seconds to milliseconds, hampering their practical application in optical communication systems. Therefore, the fabrication of heterojunction PDs with a faster response speed is important for optical communication applications.28
Herein, we report a novel nanoporous pyramid Si array based high performance photodetector. The temperature dependence of the photoresponse characteristics of the heterojunction is investigated in detail. The novel heterojunction with a NPPA structure exhibits both high absorption and robust mechanical properties. In addition, most of the previous works overlooked the carrier transportation behaviour within the heterojunction.27,29–32 A carrier transportation mechanism within the heterojunction has been proposed, and the dependence of a built-in electric field and concentration gradient are found to mainly account for the performance enhancement of the PDs. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the use of our PDs in an optical communication system to transmit texts.
2. Experimental
Materials and characterization
N-Type (100) double polished mono-crystalline Si wafers (resistivity of 1.5–2.6 Ω cm) with a thickness of 450 ± 10 μm were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water in sequence. Then, the substrate was cleaned with O2 plasma for 10 minutes. The typical pyramid structure was obtained on the clean Si wafer by immersing it in 0.2 wt% sodium hydroxide and 10 wt% ethanol at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, the substrate was immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the residual alkali and cleaned with deionized water. Si pyramids coated with a nanoporous structure were fabricated by immersing the Si pyramid substrate into a solution of 2.4 M hydrofluoric acid (HF) and 0.01 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the sample was immersed in a solution of HNO3 (30% w/w) to remove all the residual sliver particles on the surface of the Si and cleaned with deionized water. The surface morphology of the Si structure and cross-sectional structure of the device were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Ultra 55). Reflection spectroscopy was undertaken using Elight's QE-R system, with BaTiO3 as a standard sample.
Device fabrication
The CH3-terminated Si surface was processed in a glove box. The Si substrates are firstly immersed in an aqueous solution of superfluous phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) in chlorobenzene (CB) at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the sample was cleaned with CB and tetrahydrofuran (THF) and immersed in a solution of CH3MgCl (1 M) in THF at 80 °C for 8 h. The CH3-terminated surface was formed after the sample was rinsed with THF and methyl alcohol. Afterward, an Al (100 nm) top electrode was deposited on the back of the Si substrate by thermal evaporation. A MoO3−x thin film was deposited on the surface of the Si structure by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 5 × 10−6 mbar. The thickness was monitored by a crystal oscillator, and the optimized thickness is 10 nm. Finally, silver grids with a thickness of 100 nm were deposited on the surface of the MoO3−x thin film by thermal evaporation as the top electrode through a shadow mask. The effective device area was determined to be 0.3 cm2.
Photoresponse measurement
The self-powered characteristics were first measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter under the condition of AM 1.5 G using a solar simulator (Abet Technologies). Enlitech's QE-R system calibrated by a standard Si detector S10-14010 (300–1100 nm) was used to measure the EQE of all heterojunction PDs. The transient photoresponse behaviour of the photodetector was measured using the photo-induced open-circuit voltage decay method under a QE-R system or pulsed laser. Responsivity of the photodetector for the broad band spectrum was measured by a QE-R system with a light chopper (f = 133 Hz). The reversibly switched photoresponse characteristic of the photodetector was measured under 650 nm (laser, 118 mW cm−2). The laser was turned on/off regularly by a function generator. The output current was recorded and read by a Keithley 2601A source meter. Photoresponse speeds of the PDs were evaluated by combining a pulse laser and a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 2012C). The temperature was tested by a cryogenic test system that consisted of a liquid nitrogen thermostat and temperature controller (Homemade, TC202, with accuracy of +0.1 Co).
3. Results and discussion
Morphology and optical characterization of nanoporous pyramid array (NPPA) Si structures

Fig. 1a and b shows the top-view and cross-sectional view SEM images of silicon pyramids fabricated by anisotropic etching of Si; the experimental details were reported above and elsewhere.33–35 As shown in the inset of Fig. 1a, the diameter of the pyramids ranges from 5 μm to 12 μm with an average of ∼9 μm by statistical analysis. The inset of Fig. 1b shows that the height of the pyramids ranges from 2 μm to 6 μm with an average of 4.5 μm. The geometry of the as-prepared silicon pyramids is also consistent with our previous report.27 Based on the Si pyramids, the NPPA Si structure was synthesized by metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE). Fig. 1c presents a cross-sectional view of the NPPA Si structure, which is composed of some micro pyramids (3D) with embedded nano-apertures (1D). For clearly displaying the characteristic nano-aperture, Fig. 1d and e show the low and high magnification top-view SEM images of the bare mixed-dimensional Si structures. The inset of Fig. 1e shows nano-apertures embedded into a Si pyramid. The average diameter of the nanoholes is ∼110 nm by statistical analysis. Moreover, the nano-apertures are more solid than the pyramid with Si nanowires, thus improving the mechanical robustness of the devices.

(c) Typical cross-sectional view and low-magnification top view SEM images of nano-apertures on Si pyramids, respectively. (d,e) The low-magnification top view and enlarged SEM images of nano-apertures on Si pyramids highlighted by the yellow circle in (d); inset showing the diameter distribution of nano-apertures. (f) The total optical reflectance of planar Si, pyramid Si and NPPA Si structures. Inset image shows the corresponding schematic of light reflection path. 

Fig. 1f shows the light-harvesting property of the planar, pyramid and NPPA Si structures by measuring the total optical reflectance in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. It indicates that the reflectance of the pyramid Si structure is much lower than that of the planar Si, and the NPPA Si structure shows the lowest reflectance. The inset of Fig. 1f shows the schematic diagram of light reflection for better illustration of the light trapping property of the planar, pyramid and NPPA Si structures. The NPPA Si structure boosts light scattering and prolongs the optical path length, which contribute to the enhanced light-trapping property. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows high-resolution X-ray photoelectric spectra of the as-grown molybdenum oxide thin film. The results indicate the coexistence of Mo6+ and Mo5+ in the film and that the atomic ratio of Mo6+/Mo5+ is calculated to be 1.4, which means a non-stoichiometric ratio of the as-grown molybdenum oxide. Then, the MoO3−x/n-Si heterojunction was fabricated by post-thermal evaporation of molybdenum oxide on the silicon structures (Fig. S1b, ESI†).

Fig. 2 shows the energy band diagram of the MoO3−x/n-Si heterojunction. According to our previous study,27 an upward band bending could be found for the Si surface. The electron would be blocked due to upward bending on the silicon side, and hole would be easily transferred to the MoO3−x side due to the large density of gap-states. This facilitates the separation of photo-carriers in the MoO3−x/n-Si heterojunction. The favourable band bending contributes to the excellent photodetecting performance, which will be discussed in the following.

The transient photoresponse characteristics of three types of heterojunctions
The transient photoresponse characteristics of the three heterojunctions were further measured under dark and light conditions. Fig. 3a shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the three devices under AM 1.5G. The photocurrent densities of the planar device, pyramid device and NPPA device at 0 bias were deduced to be 5 mA cm−2, 17 mA cm−2 and 29 mA cm−2, respectively, which indicates that a textured surface can enhance the light-absorption property. As devices can operate under zero bias, they can serve as promising candidates for future smart IOT applications. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three devices also confirm that the NPPA device possesses the highest optoelectronic conversion efficiency. Conversely, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decreases as the textured nature of the silicon surface increases. The reason is ascribed to the decreased local shunting with the increase of contacting surface area.36–39Fig. 3b shows the distinctive photoresponse curves of the three MoO3−x/n-Si heterojunctions at zero bias. The heterojunction photodetector can be reversibly switched between low and high resistivity states when the light is switched on and off repeatedly at 0 V (650 nm laser, 150 mW cm−2, 0.1 Hz). The photocurrent ratio of the NPPA device can be enhanced by 6.74 times compared with that of the planar Si device. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is another important parameter of PDs, which is defined as: SNR = (Iph − Id)/Id,(1)where Iph is the photocurrent, and Id is the dark current. The SNR of the NPPA device reaches as high as 1.51 × 105 at 0 V, which is higher than most previously reported self-powered PDs.40,41

The time-resolved photoresponse characteristic is helpful for evaluating the transient performance of PDs, which determines the capability of optical communication. To study the response speed of our devices, laser was regulated to be 1000 Hz by a function waveform generator. Fig. 3c shows the complete rising and decaying edges of the time-resolved photoresponse of the device at zero bias (λ = 650 nm, 118 mW cm−2, 1000 Hz). The rise and fall times are determined by the time taken for the response to rise (decay) from 10% to 90% (90% to 10%) of its peak value, respectively. This reveals that the photoresponse of the heterojunction photodetector can be greatly enhanced by structure design. The rise times of the planar, pyramid and NPPA devices were determined to be 5.4 μs, 1.89 μs and 0.87 μs, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the NPPA device shows the fastest response time. The corresponding fall times show the same tendency, 130, 58, and 23 μs for the planar, pyramid and NPPA devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this novel NPPA device is superior to other transitional metal oxide (TMO) based PDs (as shown in Table 1). The faster response time is likely to be related to the unique NPPA hybrid nanostructure, which provides both higher light adsorption and shorter carrier transportation length, enhancing carrier separation and recombination efficiency. Fig. 3d shows the normalized high frequency photoresponse measurement with a broad frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 kHz. The measured bandwidths of the planar, pyramid and NPPA Si/MoO3−x heterojunction PDs were calculated to be 2 kHz, 10 kHz and 50 kHz, respectively. The broader bandwidth of the NPPA Si/MoO3−x heterojunction is mainly attributed to the unique heterostructure, which exhibits higher efficiency of carrier extraction and optical adsorption.

The photoresponsivity is widely used to evaluate the efficiency of a detector's response to optical signals. It can be defined by the equation: R = (Iph − Id)/Pin(2)where Iph, Id, and Pin are photocurrent, dark current, and illumination power on the active area of the photodetector, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3e, the photoresponsivity spectra of the three PDs under different wavelengths were measured. It can be seen that all these photoresponsivity curves show the same tendency that the photoresponsivity of PDs first increases as the wavelength increases from 300 to 920 nm, then decreases with longer wavelength. It is worth noting that the NPPA device shows the highest responsivity, with an optimal value of 138 mA W−1 at 920 nm. Additionally, specific detectivity (D*) is also an important parameter that determines a device's ability to detect weak optical signals. It can be expressed as: D* = A1/2/(2qId)1/2,(3)where A is the active area of the device, R is responsivity, q is the unit charge, and Id is the dark current. On the basis of the above equation, detectivity of the NPPA device was estimated to be (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) under illumination by 920 nm light (1.47 mW cm−2), an almost two fold increase compared with that of our previously reported hierarchical photodetector.27 In addition, specific detectivity (D*) and responsivity (R) of the NPPA device #1 under different light intensities were measured in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It indicates that D* decays rapidly with the increase of light intensity, which is consistent with the results of other groups.42–44 In order to present the photodetecting performance of the three PDs more comprehensively, the radar charts are compared and shown in Fig. 3f. It reveals that the NPPA device shows the best photodetecting performance. The overall photodetecting performance of the planar, pyramid, and NPPA devices, such as photoresponse speed, responsivity (R), specific detectivity (D*), SNR and bandwidth, is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The outstanding performance of the NPPA Si/MoO3−x heterojunction photodetector is also compared with the previously reported bulk silicon-based heterojunction PDs in Table 1. The novel NPPA device is better than most reported PDs in other studies, and is even comparable to the graphene/Si heterojunction.45
Light intensity-dependent photoresponse of the MoO3–x/NPPA Si heterojunction photodetector
To further investigate the characteristics of the NPPA photodetector, we carried out the transient photoresponse measurement under different light intensities. Fig. 4a shows the photoresponse curve of the NPPA device #2 at zero bias, which indicates excellent stability and reproducibility (650 nm, 118 mW cm−2, 100 Hz). Fig. 4b shows the light intensity dependent photoresponse curves of the NPPA device. It can be seen that the photovoltage increases as the incident light intensity increases from 3.9 mW cm−2 to 474 mW cm−2. This reveals that the photoresponse curve shows close dependence on light intensity. For weak light illumination, the photoresponse curve shows a slower edge with a longer rise time. However, it presents a sharper edge with a faster response time for stronger light illumination. Therefore, we further systematically studied the relationship between the photoresponse times (τr, τf) and light intensity.

(b) Photoresponse behaviour under 650 nm wavelength illumination with different power densities ranging from 3.9 to 474 mW cm−2. (c) The dependence of rise (black) and decay (blue) times on the light intensity of the MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunctions. (d) The photovoltage changes with light intensity; inset shows the linear dynamic range (LDR) of the NPPA photodetector. 

Fig. 4c shows the dependence of photoresponse times on the light intensity, and two characteristic regions can be found according to the different trends of rise and fall times under different light intensities. In region I, the rise time (τr) rapidly decreases from 30 μs to 1 μs with the increase of power density from 3.9 mW cm−2 to 118 mW cm−2. However, when the light intensity further increases over 118 mW cm−2, the rise time tends to saturate at ∼1 μs. It is well known that the rise time is largely dependent on the carrier separation/transportation processes. Since the interfacial passivation of the MoO3−x/Si heterojunction remains the same (CH3 passivation), the carrier transportation process should dominate the rise time. To better illustrate the carrier transportation characteristic within the heterojunction region, we analyzed the two typical layers (drifting layer and diffusing layer) individually. Considering the doping concentration (ND) of silicon is about 2 × 1015 cm−3 and the thickness of the depletion layer (W) near the heterojunction can be estimated to be ∼230 nm, the drifting time of the hole is about 2 ps. The detailed calculations are shown in the ESI,† Calculations. Since the thickness of silicon is a few hundreds of micrometers, the electron diffusion process in silicon plays a dominant role in the photoresponse. Based on the equation of carrier diffusion, F = −Dn(dn/dx)(4)the flux of the photocarrier (F) is determined by the carrier concentration gradient dn/dx. Dn = μn(KT/q)(5)where Dn is the diffusion coefficient (constant at room temperature) and defined by the Einstein relation, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is Kelvin temperature, q is the absolute value of electron charge, and μn is the electron mobility. This clearly indicates that the higher the photocarrier gradient dn/dx, the higher the photocarrier flux. As the photoresponse time depends on the carrier diffusion process, a higher photocarrier flux corresponds to a faster response speed. However, there exists a saturated carrier concentration under critical light intensity. This accounts for the stable rise time when the light intensity is larger than 118 mW cm−2. On the other hand, the fall time depends on the recombination rate of the photocarrier. In region I, the fall time decreases from 104 μs to 41 μs with the increase of power density from 3.9 mW cm−2 to 118 mW cm−2. This process is consistent with the tendency that rise time decreased as the light intensity increased. It is reasonable to believe that the fall time becomes shorter with the increase of light intensity (region I). The fall time is largely dependent on the carrier recombination process, which is sensitive to the interfacial defect states. The higher the light intensity, the larger the amount of recombination centers located within the band-gap. However, in region II, the fall time slows down with a further increase in light intensity. Since the number of defect states remains saturated, the higher concentration of photocarrier would need a longer time to recombine.

Fig. 4d shows that the output photovoltage of the MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunction increases rapidly from 150 mV to 370 mV when the light intensity changes from 3.9 mW cm−2 to 200 mW cm−2. However, a further increase of light intensity leads to the saturation of photovoltage. The inset of Fig. 4d shows the dependence of photocurrent on light power. The photocurrent increases linearly within the range from 83 nW to 56.44 mW, and the curve can be well fitted by a power law. Meanwhile, the linear dynamic range (LDR) can be calculated by the equation of LDR = 20log(Pmax/Pmin), where Pmax and Pmin are the maximum and minimum values of incident light power, respectively. For the novel MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunction, the obtained LDR value is over 116.6 dB, which surpasses other reported values, such as 42 dB for WS2/n-Si heterojunction, 42 dB for PETOD:PSS/n-Si32 heterojunction, and 78.73 dB for GaS nanosheets PDs.53
Temperature dependence of the MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunction photodetector
To further unveil the carrier transportation mechanism of the photocarrier within the MoO3−x/Si heterojunction, the temperature-dependent photoresponse characteristics of the heterojunction were measured. Detailed measurements can be found in the Experiment section and Fig. S4 (ESI†). For an ideal diode, the ideality factor (n) and barrier height (ΦB) should not be influenced by temperature. Nonetheless, these values are highly temperature dependent for a non-ideal heterojunction, which contributes to the combined effects of leakage current and series resistance. Fig. 5a shows the dark current–voltage (I–V) curve of the MoO3–x/NPPAs Si heterojunction measured under different temperatures. Under the dark condition, the carriers have to surmount the Schottky barrier for transport, and the dark current obeys the traditional thermionic emission (TE) theory for a Schottky diode.54 The current across the Schottky junction at 0 V bias voltage can be described by the equation: I0 = AA*T2exp(−qΦB/KBT)(6)where I0 is the current, A is Schottky contact area, A* is the effective Richardson-constant (112 A cm−2 K−2 for n-Si), and ΦB is the Schottky barrier height. As shown in Fig. 5b, I0 can be extrapolated from the semi-log I–V curves at different temperatures, and then ΦB can be obtained. In Fig. 5c, Voc shows an opposite dependence on temperature, while Schottky barrier height shows a linear dependence on temperature. It is found that the Schottky barrier height increases linearly from 0.22 eV to 0.92 eV as temperature increases from 78 to 420 K.

(f) Carrier transport model for carrier separation and transportation under illumination. 
However, this result deviated from the classical Schottky theory that ΦB will decrease with the increase of temperature.
This deviation might be ascribed to the effects of surface states, spatial inhomogeneity of barrier height, and image force that decrease the conduction process, as well as Fermi level pinning in the heterojunction.55–57 The tendency of the temperature-dependent open-circuit voltage (Voc) is opposite to that of ΦB, which can be explained by the empirical equation: Voc = kT/qLn(1 + IL/IS)(7)where IS = 1.5 × 105exp(−Eg/kT)(8)Voc is the open-circuit voltage, IL and IS are photocurrent and reverse saturation current, and Eg is the band gap of silicon. As shown in Fig. 5c, the dependence of Voc varies with temperature in the range from 78 K to 420 K, which can be well fitted by the above equation. Due to the Burstein–Moss (B–M) effect in a semiconductor, which was induced by the increase of carrier concentration, both the Fermi levels would be greatly lifted up. With the increase of temperature, the potential difference within the heterojunction becomes smaller. This accounts for the decreased tendency of Voc (open circuit voltage) to varying with the increase of temperature.
In Fig. 5d, the reverse saturation current at −1 V bias at different temperatures is plotted. It can be clearly seen that the temperature has a remarkable influence on the dark current. With the increase of temperature, the dark current shows a linear increase. However, the photocurrent exhibits the opposite dependence, namely, it is insensitive to temperature. It was reported that the dark current is determined by the number of thermally activated carriers. Under the assistance of temperature (thermal energy), more carriers would surpass the Schottky barrier, resulting in the increase of dark current under a bias of −1 V. The photocurrent is mainly ascribed to the photo-excited carriers, which largely depend on the wavelength of light. This accounts for the insensitive dependence of photocurrent on temperature.
To better understand the carrier transportation mechanism within the heterojunction, a series of rise/fall times under varied temperature was measured. As shown in Fig. 5e, the response time is highly sensitive to the temperature. Two regions can be found according to the different dependence trend of rise and fall times on the temperature. It can be seen that the rise time first increases in the range of 78 K to 225 K, then it decreases almost linearly with a further increase of the temperature. However, in the carrier recombination process, the fall time first shows a slow increase from 78 K to 200 K, and then sharply decreases when the temperature further increases from 200 K to 320 K, then it remains relatively stable when the temperature exceeds 320 K. The same trend of temperature-dependent photoresponse characteristics can also be found in the planar and pyramid heterojunctions (as shown in Fig. S5b, ESI,† and Fig. 5c).
The mechanism accounting for the temperature dependence of photoresponse characteristics is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5f. The carrier transportation length consists of two parts: a carrier drifting layer and diffusion layer. The rise time of PDs depends on the transportation of photo-generated carriers, which involves the separation, transportation, and the extraction of carriers to the electrodes. Given that the carrier mobility in ultrathin molybdenum oxide (∼10 nm) is larger than 1100 cm2 V−1 s−1,57 the transportation of carriers from the MoO3−x layer to the Ag electrode should be negligible. Therefore, electron transportation determines the overall photoresponse speed of the heterojunctions. It is estimated that an electron needs only a few picoseconds to pass the drifting layer under the built-in electric field (Eb). However, by assumption of weak surface recombination in silicon, it needs up to 73 μs to cross the diffusion layer, which is quite close to the reported value for n-type silicon with the same doping level (see Calculation methods, ESI†).
According to the classical theory of semiconductors, both impurity scattering and lattice scattering affect the carrier transportation. Given the weak doping of silicon wafer (2 × 1015 cm−3), it is proposed that lattice scattering becomes dominant in the low temperature range. The lower the temperature, the weaker the lattice scattering, corresponding to the higher electron mobility that accounts for the faster rise time at lower temperature. However, when temperature rises up to >200 K, the rise time becomes faster and the underlying reason is the enhanced built-in electric field (Ebi). As mentioned above, the barrier height of the heterojunction increases with the increase of temperature (Fig. 5c). The larger the built-in electric field, the greater the electron velocity would be accelerated before arriving at the diffusion layer. The energized electrons (hot electrons) contribute to the faster diffusion of carriers, further resulting in a shorter rise time with the increase of temperature.
On the other hand, the fall time depends on the recombination rate of carriers. In the low temperature region (78–200 K), the photo-generated electrons show less sensitivity to defect scattering, thus exhibiting a relatively stable fall time.
There is a large fluctuation of the photovoltage in the low temperature region for heterojunctions with planar, pyramid and NPPA structures (Fig. S5, ESI†). However, when the temperature exceeds 200 K, the defect scattering effect becomes dominant and impurity centers are thermally activated, and this causes the increase of recombination probability, which accounts for the sharp decrease of fall time. It is worth noting that the fall time becomes stable with a further increase of temperature (320–420 K), which results from the saturated density of defect centers. Additionally, the MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunction photodetector shows excellent temperature resistance after the low and high temperature measurements. As shown in Fig. S5d (ESI†), the photodetecting performance of the heterojunction photodetector can recover its original level after the temperature cycling process, which indicates the high stability of this novel heterojunction photodetector.
Furthermore, we integrated the as-fabricated MoO3−x/NPPA Si heterojunction photodetector into a visible light communication (VLC) system as a light signal receiver. It is well-known that VLC is an evolving technology for forthcoming high data rate wireless communication, holding the promise of high-speed, high energy-saving, interference immunity and high-security characteristics. Meanwhile, VLC shows superiority of light condition matching, since it avoids the use of focus light in a thin fiber. Herein, a prototype VLC system integrated with our MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector as light receiver was built. Contrary to a commercial photodetector (light receiver), the present MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector is self-powered and does not need external power. As shown in Fig. 6a, data flow from a computer was transferred into high and low voltage levels using a driver. Then, the voltage level was used to switch the laser (660 nm) to output a modulated light, which can be received by the MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector. The output photovoltage was firstly amplified with a preamplifier and comparator and then input to a driver, which transferred the voltage signal into data that were received by a computer. The inset image in Fig. 6a shows the comparison of input waveform and output waveform of the MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector, which receives the message-modulated light at 100 Hz. Fig. 6b shows the waveforms of the digital data from the photodetector, which receives the message-modulated light at different bit rates, indicating that the system can transmit data with a bit rate of 50 kbps. Based on the fast response speed of our MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector, it is anticipated that it should be able to work at higher bit rates. It should be noted that the output waveform exhibits a little time delay when the transmittance rate is larger than 20 kbps, and the reason lies in the limited bandwidth of the experimental circuit (especially the preamplifier). But, the shorter delay does not influence the demonstration of text transmitting. The digital photograph of the VLC system is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The demonstration of the text transmission via the VLC system can be seen in the attached video of the ESI.†

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a high performance heterojunction photodetector with a unique nanoporous pyramid Si structure. The unique NPPA Si structure shows excellent light trapping and carrier collection efficiencies. The obtained heterojunction photodetector exhibits high detectivity, fast response speed, and an excellent linear dynamic range of 116.6 dB. Additionally, the carrier transportation characteristics within the heterojunction were investigated at different temperatures. The results indicate that the interfacial barrier height can be largely tuned by the temperature. A carrier transportation model is proposed in which carrier diffusion dominates the photoresponse characteristics, and the concentration gradient of the minority carrier in silicon determines the photoresponse time. Moreover, the MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector shows high resistance to low/high temperature cycling measurements. Finally, we successfully integrated the MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector into a visible light communication system and demonstrated the first transition metal oxide based prototype self-powered signal receiver. Our results suggest that the high speed and stable MoO3−x/NPPA Si photodetector may have great potential in optical communication applications.
