Recent work has led to the development of a coarse-grained model for studying poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends using molecular simulations. Here we provide further validation of the force field and use it to study the thermal annealing process of P3HT:PCBM blends. A key finding of our study is that, in contrast to a previous report, the annealing process does not converge at the short time scales reported. Rather, we find that the self-assembly of the blends is characterized by three rate dependent stages that require much longer simulations to approach convergence. Using state-of-the-art high performance computing, we are able to study annealing at length and time scales commensurate with devices used in experiments. Our simulations show different phase segregated morphologies dependent on the P3HT chain length and PCBM volume fraction in the blend. For short chain lengths, we observed a smectic morphology containing alternate P3HT and PCBM domains. In contrast, a phase segregated morphology containing domains of P3HT and PCBM distributed randomly in space is found for longer chain lengths. Theoretical arguments justifying stabilization of these morphologies due to shape anisotropy of P3HT (rod-like) and PCBM (sphere-like) are presented. Furthermore, results on the structure factor, miscibility of P3HT and PCBM, domain spacing and kinetics of phase segregation in the blends are presented in detail. Qualitative comparison of these results with published small-angle neutron scattering experiments in the literature is presented and an excellent agreement is found.1 IntroductionOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been the topic of extensive research recently due to the societal need for a photovoltaic cell that is lightweight, versatile, adaptable in terms of application and cost effective to manufacture.1–6 Despite these attractive features, existing OPVs tend to have lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) (typically <10%) in comparison with inorganic photovoltaics (IPVs), which have PCE in the range 10–20% or higher. Also, the durability and lifespan of an OPV cell are not at par with an IPV cell.7 Therefore, these hurdles need to be overcome before OPVs become economically viable8 for future applications.In order to find ways to overcome these limitations, computational approaches have been utilized for deciphering the roles of different variables that could improve the PCE and lifetime of an OPV cell.9 A number of such studies have focused10–16 on some or all of the pertinent steps in solar energy conversion in an OPV device. These steps in chronological order are: (1) the absorption of light and exciton (i.e., electron–hole pair) generation; (2) the diffusion of the exciton to an interface; (3) the separation of the exciton into an electron and a hole; (4) the transport of these electrons and holes to their corresponding electrode; and (5) the transfer of electrons and holes from the electrode to an external circuit. It is believed that the third step needs optimization in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) design.17,18 Here the design consists of a mixture of an electron donor (usually the conjugated polymer) and an electron acceptor (fullerene based molecules), which tends to form a phase segregated morphology. The phase segregation leads to a marked increase in the interfacial area between the donor and acceptor thus facilitating exciton separation. However, the ultimate goal is to achieve sizes of the donor and electron acceptor domains commensurate with the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) so that a higher number of excitons can reach the donor–acceptor interface. For reviews on the morphology of polymer bulk heterojunctions, we refer to the works of Liu et al.19 and Ruderer and Müller-Buschbaum.20In the literature, polythiophene and fullerene derivatives have been used as electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively. In particular, blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are one of the most studied systems for OPV applications. Issues like the details of morphology and miscibility have been topics of extensive discussion. Despite being heavily researched,21 a consensus view on the morphology of P3HT:PCBM blends and various control parameters has not yet emerged. Furthermore, a BHJ film relies on self-assembly to attain a structure that has the correct domain size. Such structures are usually metastable and one way of controlling the structure is through thermal annealing. However, it is not clear how structural parameters such as the P3HT chain length and its volume fraction in the blend affect the final morphology.Recently, Lee et al., have developed a multiscale molecular simulation framework that included a coarse-grained force field for P3HT:PCBM blends and techniques for reverse-mapping to allow simulation at the atomic level.11 This work allows for investigation of annealing processes that form electron donor and acceptor domains and was used to analyze the effect of the P3HT:PCBM weight ratio on the blend morphology, including average domain sizes, interface-to-volume, and percolation ratios. Unfortunately, their results were limited by small simulation sizes and simulation times. Although they reported convergence for their simulations, our analysis shows that the simulations are still in a kinetic stage with rapid change and therefore longer simulations will produce different results.Here, we use the Lee–Pao–Chu (LPC) force field to further investigate P3HT:PCBM blends. Using time on a development partition of the Titan supercomputer, we were able to perform simulations at experimental time and length scales.22 Our simulations explore the effects of the structural parameters on the morphology. We compare our results with recent experiments and provide a quantitative means of describing the evolution of relevant quantities such as the interfacial area to volume ratio, γ. The structure factor of P3HT:PCBM blends and stabilization of smectic and other phase segregated morphologies as a function of chain length and polymer volume fraction are also presented. We conclude with qualitative remarks on the relationship of the chain degree of polymerization N and the P3HT weight fraction ϕm with the PCE of an OPV device.2 Simulation detailsA series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed on P3HT:PCBM blends using the LPC model.11 The force field was derived through the fitting of structural parameters such as bond length, bond angle, bond torsion and radial distribution function of the coarse-grained model to an atomistic simulation using the Dreiding force field.23 In this model, each monomer in P3HT and PCBM are coarse-grained as Lennard-Jones (LJ) beads with their respective LJ energy parameter ε and bead radius σ taken from ref. 11. Bonds along the P3HT chain are characterized by a harmonic potential with an average bond length, b. Furthermore, bond angles, θ, and dihedrals along the P3HT chain have been defined using a harmonic and an OPLS24 type torsion potential, respectively. For details of the force-field, we refer interested readers to Table 1 of ref. 11.In our simulations, each initial configuration of the simulation box consists of m (ranging from 800–324000) randomly distributed P3HT chains and PCBM beads at a low number density in a periodic simulation box. Start-up runs consist of the use of a Langevin thermostat with a set point of 423 K and a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. The system was relaxed to remove high-energy contacts with an NVE velocity-verlet integrator and a Langevin thermostat,25 which limits the distance update of each bead by 0.1 Å. Compression of the simulation box to a volume near its equilibrium value was performed to achieve the correct order of the melt density. After these initial set-up steps, simulations were run in an isobaric–isothermal (NPT) ensemble with temperature fixed at T = 423 K and pressure, P = 1 atm using a Nose-Hoover26 thermostat and barostat with coupling constants of 0.1 ps and 1.0 ps, respectively. The particular choice of T = 423 K originates from the thermal annealing protocol used in experiments for P3HT:PCBM blends.27,28 The simulation steps are illustrated in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The NPT ensemble simulations have been run with an integration time step of 10 femtosecond (fs). The NPT coupling constants, the type of thermostat and the integration time step are the same as in the simulations of Lee et al.11In order to obtain results, we have used a development partition of the Titan supercomputer22 to perform simulations with GPU acceleration29 in LAMMPS.30 Our simulations have been run for 400 nanoseconds (ns) to ensure that the total energy of the system has approached convergence; this is ten times longer than previous simulations.11 Additionally, we have used simulation boxes of sizes, L = Lx = Ly = Lz, ranging from 33 × 33 × 33 nm3 to 128 × 128 × 128 nm3 dimensions. This range is from 1 to 27 times the number of particles used in previous work;11 our largest simulations span the size of a typical active layer in OPV applications (∼100 nm) in an experimental setup.In order to explore the effects of the P3HT chain length and its volume fraction on the morphology, we have conducted two sets of simulations. In the first set, we systematically vary the number of PCBM beads nPCBM keeping the total number of P3HT monomers nP3HT fixed at N × m where N is the degree of polymerization of the P3HT chain and m is the number of the chains. These simulations provide insights into the effects of the P3HT weight fraction ϕm on the morphology of the blends. Similar parameter variations were reported in ref. 11 and this set will be used for comparison purposes only. In the second set of simulations, we vary the degree of polymerization N of the P3HT polymer keeping the total number of P3HT monomers and PCBM beads constant. The second set of simulations shed light on the effects of the chain length on the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend at a constant P3HT weight fraction ϕm. The details of each simulation box, including the molecular weight of the P3HT chains, MW, are tabulated in Table 1 and the snapshots after 400 ns for each type of simulation for systems with the number of P3HT monomers N × m = 3240000 are shown in Fig. 1. Explanations for the origin of these phase segregated morphologies and their structural characteristics along with the kinetics of phase segregation are presented in the next section.

These snapshots correspond to simulations after 400 ns for systems with (a) number of chains, m = 32400 and N = 100; (b) ϕm = 0.5. P3HT monomers and PCBM beads are colored in red and blue respectively. 3 Results and discussionsP3HT is a semi-flexible polymer with experimentally determined values of the persistence length ranging from 24 Å31 to 33 Å.32 Using the LPC force-field, we have simulated pure P3HT chains and computed their persistence length lp (see ref. 33 and ESI†). Conformational characteristics of P3HT chains obtained from single chain and the melt simulations are tabulated in Table S1 in ESI.† The calculated persistence length lp is found to be 35.0 Å and 35.6 Å for a single chain and melt state, respectively. These values are close to the experimentally observed values and validate the choice of the coarse-grained model used here. Using the persistence length, we have estimated the number of P3HT beads in a persistent segment. The number of Kuhn segments, Nk, is equal to Nbcos(θ/2)/2lp, where b is the bond length and θ is the bond angle. For a chain with N = 100, we have estimated Nk = 5 so that each Kuhn segment consists of 20 P3HT beads. Invoking the relation that the Kuhn segment length is twice the persistence length, approximately 10 beads constitute one persistent segment. This, in turn, means that chains with N = 10 are rod-like and as we increase N, conformational degrees of freedom will tend to play a significant role in the self-assembly.A typical run showing the self-assembly along with the total energy of the system as a function of time is shown in Fig. 2. These results show that the kinetics of self-assembly for the blends are characterized by an exponential decay in the total system energy (potential + kinetic energy), Etotal that can be divided into three rate-dependent stages as shown in Fig. 2. In the initial stage, there is a rapid decrease in the normalized total energy (potential + kinetic energy), Etotal along with the aggregation of P3HT chains. This stage lasts up to 75 ns for the 50:50 blend until it tapers off. In the intermediate stage, 75 ns up to around 200 ns, a slower rate of decrease in total energy is observed. This is followed by the last stage starting around 200 ns, where domain sizes grow very slowly and the rate of total energy decay is the slowest. These three stages are also evident in the calculated characteristic size of domains as shown in the latter part of the manuscript. Fig. 2  The evolution of the normalized total energy Etotal for the P3HT:PCBM system with N = 100, m = 32400 and ϕm = 0.5 together with the corresponding snapshots. The lines indicating the slopes of the curve serve as a guide highlighting the three different stages: a fast decrease (stage I), intermediate (stage II) and slow decrease (stage III). The inset shows the evolution of the total system pressure and temperature. The straight lines are the average pressure and temperature, which are equal to 1.06 ± 2.21 atm and 423.00 ± 0.17 K respectively. The red curve in the P vs. t plot is the averaged value of the system pressure with a window size equal to 10 ns. Although Lee et al., reported that the correct average sizes of P3HT domains were obtained after 30 ns, it is clear from Fig. 2 that the system is still evolving at 30 ns. Simulations run to 400 ns approach convergence however and are equivalent to 6.24 μs of atomistic simulation time considering a scaling factor of 15.6 following ref. 11. We have compared the diffusion coefficient (D) of disordered PCBM in P3HT with those measured in experiments. For comparison purposes, we have used data reported by Treat et al.34 (D = 5.0 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 for T = 150 °C and a PCBM volume fraction, ϕPCBM = 0.01), the details of which are described in the ESI.† The comparison reveals that the results for simulations are 679 times faster than actual experiments. This is expected if one notes the usage of a smooth force-field leading to lower potential barriers in contrast to atomistic simulations and experiments characterized by rugged energy landscape. The longer simulations provide for reliable measurements of the pertinent quantities and details about the miscibility issues for OPV applications e.g., the ratio of the interfacial area to the volume, γ, and the local packing fraction of the coarse-grained P3HT monomers, η which are discussed below.3.1 Miscibility of PCBM in P3HTMiscibility of PCBM in P3HT has been the topic of intense discussion.21,28,35–40 For the LPC force field, we have quantified the amount of PCBM miscible with P3HT. Note that the energy of binary mixing per lattice site as prescribed by the regular solution theory is given by41 (1)where n is the total number of lattice sites, z is the coordination number and uDA, uDD and uAA are the pairwise interaction energies between the electron donor (D), P3HT, and the electron acceptor (A), PCBM. ϕv is the volume fraction of one of the components, which was computed using Voronoi tessellation and not to be confused with the mass fraction ϕm. Relating the pairwise interaction energies to the Lennard-Jones pair potential used in the force field by uDD to −εDD, the quantity (−2εDA + εDD + εAA) is found to be 0.97 kcal mol−1 (=1.174kBT at T = 423 K). This positive interaction energy represents a highly unfavorable mixing condition. However, such an estimate ignores entropic contributions to miscibility. So, we have calculated the Flory Interaction parameter χ using molecular dynamics simulations for N = 75, m = 1200 and ϕm = 0.5 and found χ = 0.92 ± 0.1 which is in agreement with the χ = 0.86 value reported by Kozub et al.39 Details of the χ parameter calculation are provided in the ESI.† In general, translational and conformational entropies play a significant role in driving the mixing and are dependent on the mixing ratio and chain length.42,43To quantify the amount of PCBM beads that are miscible in the P3HT matrix, we employ the Voronoi tessellation scheme44 by counting the Voronoi cells belonging to the PCBM with only P3HT as its nearest neighbor. The volume fraction of PCBM in the P3HT matrix ϕv,PCBM is represented by, (2)where Visolated,PCBM is a Voronoi cell volume of a PCBM bead with only P3HT beads as its nearest neighbors and VP3HT is a P3HT Voronoi cell volume. The values of ϕv,PCBM are plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (b) as a function of N and volume fraction of P3HT (ϕv,P3HT), respectively. The amount of PCBM mixed in the P3HT matrix decreases with an increase in chain length, N, as is observed in Fig. 3(a). This is in agreement with the theoretical understanding of the decrease in the translational entropy of binary mixing with an increase in chain length.41 In contrast, ϕv,PCBM increases as ϕv,P3HT increases as shown in Fig. 3(b). This is an outcome of the fact that an increase in the PCBM volume fraction leads to stabilization of phase segregated states as described in the next section. These results suggest that it is advisable to use longer chains in the OPV device in order to have pure domains. However, an absolute value of ϕv,PCBM ∼ 0.02 suggests that the PCBM is nearly immiscible with the P3HT chains. This is in contrast to experimental findings21,39 of 15–20% miscibility of PCBM in amorphous P3HT. The possible origin of such a discrepancy may lie in the role played by substrates, chain length polydispersity and regioregularity, all of which will be considered in our future work. Fig. 3  Effects of the degree of polymerization N of P3HT chains on the volume fraction of PCBM inside the P3HT domains ϕv,PCBM, at ϕm = 0.5 is shown in (a). Effects of P3HT volume fractions ϕv,P3HT for N = 100 on ϕv,PCBM are presented in (b). We also calculated the amount of P3HT chains mixed in the PCBM matrix. We have performed a cluster analysis of the final configuration at t = 400 ns by clustering P3HT beads that are neighbors within a cutoff of 5 Å, which is approximately equal to the Lennard-Jones σ of the P3HT bead. We found the number of isolated chains dissolved in the PCBM domain to be relatively small. For example, for systems with N = 100, m = 32400 and different ϕm, the number of single unclustered P3HT chains is found to be 1, 1, 4 and 15, respectively. Given that the total number of chains is 32400, these small numbers signify that the P3HT chains are almost immiscible in the PCBM matrix. The same is true for other chain lengths (e.g., the fraction of isolated chains dissolved in the PCBM domains is found to be 0.095, 0.005, and 0.0002 for N equal to 10, 25 and 50, respectively). It should be noted that for N = 10, the morphology is found to be smectic/layered (see Fig. 1(b)) in the weak-segregation limit so that each domain contains a mixture of P3HT and PCBM, which explains the higher number of P3HT chains in contact with PCBM beads. For other values of N, we have found percolated structures of P3HT.Based on this analysis, we can infer that the two components, P3HT and PCBM, are highly immiscible with a minuscule miscibility originating from the translational entropy of mixing. Next we focus on the role played by conformational entropy in driving the phase segregation in P3HT:PCBM blends, which also explains the stabilization of smectic/layered and percolated structures as mentioned earlier.3.2 Phase segregation in P3HT:PCBM blendsFig. 1 shows that both the volume fraction of P3HT (top layer of the figure) and the chain length (bottom layer) play significant roles in affecting structure in the blends. In the following, we argue that it is the conformational degrees of freedom which play a significant role in driving the phase segregation in the blends.In order to quantify the phase segregation, we compute the local packing fraction of P3HT and PCBM using the radical Voronoi tessellation scheme. For the calculation of the local packing fraction η, we use the relation45 (3)where σj(T*) and Vj are the size of a bead of type j and the volume of the Voronoi cell around it, respectively. The temperature dependence and “soft” core nature of the beads are taken into account by invoking the relation by Barker and Henderson46 as, (4)so that  and , where εj−j is the Lennard-Jones parameter for quantifying interactions between beads of type j.As discussed in the previous section, most of the contacts between PCBM and P3HT occur near the interface. Hence, average values of the local packing fractions neglecting the Voronoi cells with neighbors belonging to different types are representative of the volume fraction in the pure domains. Results of such calculations are presented in Fig. 4 for different systems where the P3HT chain length is varied. From the Fig. 4(a), it is clear that the system is driven to a more phase separated state as the length of the polymer chain is increased as evidenced by the decrease of packing fraction of P3HT, ηP3HT. In contrast, for a fixed chain length of N = 100, it is found that ηP3HT is almost unchanged with an average value of 0.417 as additional PCBM is added to the system. This, in turn, means that the P3HT chain length plays a significant role in driving the phase segregation. For hard spheres, the loosest way of packing leads to η = 0.545 (ref. 47) while the maximum random packing fraction is 0.634.48 Our calculations give ηPCBM = 0.536 ± 0.035, thus indicating a loosely packed PCBM domain. Fig. 4  The average local packing fraction of P3HT and PCBM in pure domains as a function of P3HT chain length N and its volume fraction ϕv,P3HT. Another clear evidence that conformational degrees of freedom of P3HT chains play a significant role lies in the fact that for rod-like P3HT chains (i.e., for N = 10), a smectic morphology is observed (cf.Fig. 1(b)). In contrast, such a morphology is not observed for higher values of N, suggesting that semi-flexibility could play an important role in the phase segregation. Simulations starting from smectic/layered structures as initial configurations show that the smectic structure has higher energy than the bi-continuous phase segregated morphology for higher values of N. Furthermore, the smectic/layered system never changed into the lower energy bi-continuous phase indicating that an energy barrier exists upon changing from the layered to the bi-continuous phase. Stabilization of a smectic structure containing alternate layers of rods and spheres has been shown to be an outcome of the system tending to maximize its entropy.49–51 However, such a structure is not expected for a mixture of flexible polymers and spheres as evident from earlier works.52–54 Hence, we believe that conformational degrees of freedom play an important role in the phase separation for P3HT:PCBM blends.Dependence of an average size of phase segregated domains and the interfacial area on the polymer chain length and its volume fraction is presented in the next section.3.2.1 P3HT domain size and P3HT/PCBM interfacial area. It has been postulated that an ideal morphology should have pure domains of sizes around 10 nm for P3HT55–57 with a large interfacial area and connecting pathways allowing charge collection at the electrodes. Also, the interfacial area to volume ratio, γ, is another important quantity in OPV applications due to the fact that an exciton is dissociated into charge carriers at the interfaces between electron donors and acceptors. Thus higher values of γ are desirable for improving the number of charge carriers in an OPV device. The average domain size of P3HT, 〈D〉, is related to the interfacial area, σA, by the relation 〈D〉σA ∼ L3ϕv, where ϕv is the volume fraction of P3HT domains (∼ϕm, the mass fraction of P3HT domains) and L3 is the total volume under consideration. Based on the results presented for the phase segregation in P3HT:PCBM blends so far, an increase in PCBM content (i.e., decrease in ϕm) at constant N leads to enhanced phase segregation due to energetic and entropic effects. Similarly, an increase in the P3HT chain length leads to lower entropy of mixing and an enhanced phase segregation. As shown in the following simulation results, this demixing is characterized by a microphase separation with increased interfacial area, γ. Because γ = σA/L3, there is a decrease in 〈D〉 with an increase in N.In order to estimate the sizes of the P3HT domain in a percolated structure obtained for a mixing ratio of 1:1, we have used an analysis developed for estimating pore size distribution (PSD)58 in networks. We estimate the average size of the pores in a network formed by removing the P3HT chains from the simualion box and computing the PSD. Details of the PSD calculation can be found in the ESI.† The size of P3HT domains in a percolated network can be approximated by the average pore size 〈D〉 defined as (5)where P(Di) is the probability of finding a pore of size Di (PSD), which is estimated from the system configurations. The same method can be used for the estimation of domain sizes for other structures. Results of such calculations are shown in Fig. 5 for different mixing ratios and P3HT chain lengths. The calculation of Di used is not accurate for initial configurations before the onset of domain formation. Therefore, the plots in Fig. 5 do not show values for 〈D〉 when greater than 80% of the PCBM molecules have no contact with other PCBM molecules. As shown in Fig. 5, the simulation time required for measurable domain formation increases with ϕm. Fig. 5  The evolution of the average P3HT domain size, 〈D〉, for the P3HT:PCBM systems with N × m = 3240000, ϕm = 0.5 and different values of N (a); and for the P3HT:PCBM systems with m = 32400, N = 100 and different values ϕm (b). From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the average P3HT domain size 〈D〉 decreases with an increase in N and increases with an increase in ϕm, as expected. Similarly, Fig. 6 shows the effects of N and ϕm on γ and the results are in agreement with the inverse relation between 〈D〉 and γ. Note that for the smallest chain length N = 10, intermixing between the P3HT and PCBM has led to a higher value for γ. Fig. 6  The interfacial area to volume ratio, γ, as a function of P3HT chain length N and its volume fraction. A non-monotonic behavior of γ as a function of mixing ratio was reported in ref. 11. Interestingly, we observed a “monotonic” increase in γ with an increase in the mixing ratio in the range of ϕv reported by Lee et al. We believe that the origin of this discrepancy arises due to the use of an ad hoc spatial-discretization scheme in ref. 11 to estimate morphological characteristics such as the domain size, interfacial area etc. In their scheme, pixels belonging to P3HT and PCBM were discretized with a unit cube of side length 1 nm. Such a method ignores the effects of chain connectivity on local packing.59 This is not the case with the Voronoi tesselation44 scheme that can be used for analysis without artifacts or errors in quantitative estimation. For percolated systems, the spatial-discretization scheme can not be used; in this case, all of the P3HT chains belong to one cluster, i.e., MP3HT = 1 in the notation of ref. 11. Although our results computed at t = 30 ns are in agreement with ref. 11, longer simulations result in percolated structures. A more detailed quantitative description of the kinetics of phase segregation and different length scales, which are amenable to experimental verifications, is presented in the next section.3.2.2 Kinetics of the phase segregation. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a powerful means to investigate the kinetics of phase segregation. In the following, we provide useful insights into the kinetics of coarsening (i.e., increase in domain sizes as a function of time) and the development of interfacial area in phase segregated P3HT:PCBM blends. We believe these results can be validated using experiments. These results also provide a verification of theoretical predictions for phase segregating systems.Our approach for studying the kinetics of phase segregation is motivated by small angle neutron scattering experiments, where the interfacial area per unit volume (γ) is inferred using Porod's law: I(q) ∼ 2πγ/q4, where I(q) is the scattered intensity. The law is strictly valid for sharp interfaces with pure domains on each side and is an asymptotic law for Fourier transform of the Debye correlation function Γ(r), defined by60,61 (6)where ρi and ρj are the local fluctuations in the total number density from the average number density separated by a distance r = |ri − rj|, and 〈ρ2〉Av is the average value of the square of the number density fluctuations. For the blends the local mass density fluctuations were used instead of the number density of P3HT. The deviation of the total density from its average value is used for computing the function. The Fourier transform of eqn (6) for the blends is the total structure factor, S(,t), which depends on time, t. We have computed S(,t) using the method described in ref. 62 (also see ESI†). For comparison purposes, we have also computed the structure factor for the pure P3HT and PCBM systems and the results are presented in Fig. 8.Fig. 8 shows the structure factors for the P3HT:PCBM blends (blue dots), neat PCBM (green dots) and neat P3HT (red dots). The structure factors for the blends show a peak at q ∼ 0.68 Å−1. Comparison of the structure factors for the blends and pure components reveals that the origin of the peak lies in the presence of loosely packed PCBM. Such a peak has also been observed in experiments27,40 for the P3HT:PCBM blends. However, the origin of the peak was proposed to be due to the presence of PCBM crystals. In contrast, our simulation study reveals that the peak originates from the random close packing of PCBM. Furthermore, the structure factors for the blends show a peak at even smaller wavevectors, which shifts towards zero with an increase in time. Such a low wave-vector peak is a signature of systems undergoing phase segregation, which we have used to extract information about the coarsening of domains and evolution of the interfacial area.In order to extract useful information about the interfacial area from the structure factor, we have used a universal functional form for S(,t), proposed for systems undergoing phase segregation.63 It is well known that for any phase segregating system, S(,t) = AF(q/q*)/q*3, where A is a constant and F(x) is a scaling function. q* is the wave-vector corresponding to the first peak in S(,t). In ref. 63, heuristic “universal” form for the scaling function has been proposed and is given by (7)where b = 4ξ2(1 − d)2/(1 − ξ2)2, c = d/(b − d + d2), a = (1 + c)(1 + d2/b), d = 2π/q* and ξ = γd/8πη(1 − η).From this description of the time dependent structure factor, it is clear that there are two quantities which are important for describing a phase segregating system. The first quantity is d, which sets the length scale characterizing the size of domains. The second quantity is ξ which quantifies the volume fraction of phase segregating domains (∼ interfacial area to volume ratio × size of domains). Both d and ξ are dependent on the mixing ratio and time. In order to verify predictions of such a heuristic approach, we have computed ξ(t) by fits of the first peak in S(,t) to eqn (7) from t = 300 to 400 ns (stage III). Also, the time dependent packing fraction is computed using the Voronoi tessellation scheme and presented in Fig. 7(b). For the packing fraction, η, the total volume fraction of the minority component, ϕv,P3HT was used. A linear law for ξ(t) and the quantity γ(t)d(t)/8πη(t)(1 − η(t)), expected from the heuristic approach, is verified in Fig. 9 and seems to hold well for these calculations. Note that such a low wave vector peak was not obtained in SANS experiments done at longer time scales where phase segregation is complete. We believe that specific experiments designed to show the evolution of phase segregation should be able to verify our predictions.

Fig. 8  The structure factor, S(q,t) for the P3HT:PCBM blend (blue), pure P3HT (red) and pure PCBM (green) systems at t = 400 ns. The black lines are the S(q) values calculated from the radial distribution function, g(r) and the blue line is the fit to (eqn (7)). The length scales are commensurate with the P3HT bead size of 4.95 Å (A), P3HT bond length of 3.82 Å (B), PCBM bead size of 9.35 Å (C) and domain spacing d of 412 Å (D).  Fig. 9  The correlation length parameter ξ(t) as a function of γ(t)/4η(t)(1 − η(t))q*(t) for P3HT:PCBM blends for ϕm = 0.5 and N = 100 (a) and N = 150 (b). Theories have predicted the coarsening of domains to take place as per the power law, d ∼ tα, where α = 1/3 for diffusion dominated processes.64 For the P3HT:PCBM blends, we have plotted d in Fig. 10(a) and we have found that α = 1/3 for longer chains, N = 100, 150 and ϕm = 0.5. This represents that coarsening in the blends takes place through diffusive processes. A lower value of the exponent signifies the role played by interfaces and this may be the reason for a lower exponent found for shorter chains. Also, note that d decreases with an increase in N as in Fig. 5. However, results for d as a function of different volume fractions appears to be in disagreement with Fig. 5. This is due to the fact that the pore size distribution is commensurate with the size of the P3HT domain while d is for the period of the oscillation of the density fluctuations which includes the size of the PCBM domain. For the systems with different ϕm and constant N, N × m is constant. Hence, as the weight fraction is increased d decreases because the PCBM domain is relatively smaller while the size of the P3HT domain is relatively unchanged. (cf.Fig. 5(b)) Fig. 10  Evolution of the characteristic size of domains, d for P3HT:PCBM blends at different N and ϕm = 0.5 (a); and d for P3HT:PCBM blends at different ϕm and N = 100 (b). The black and red lines shows scaling exponents of α = 1/3 and α = 1/6 respectively. 4 ConclusionWe have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the phase behavior of solvent free P3HT:PCBM blends at different mixing ratios and chain lengths. The simulations have been run at an unprecedented length and time scale (up to 400 ns with box sizes ranging from 30 to 128 nm) enabled by using state-of-the-art high performance computing (Titan supercomputer).For the LPC force field developed using a multi-scaling approach, we have found that P3HT and PCBM are highly immiscible. A minuscule miscibility, if at all present, originates from translational entropy of molecules. The use of the typical annealing temperature of T = 423 K is comparable to experimental situations. The most effective annealing temperature may be dependent on molecular weight65 although our calculations do not take this into account. We have found different phase segregated morphologies, where the PCBM is found to be in loosely packed state with a packing fraction of ∼0.545. The P3HT chain length is found to play a significant role in driving the phase segregation in the P3HT:PCBM blends. For example, it is shown that the local packing fraction of the P3HT in pure domains increases with an increase in the chain length. Furthermore, for a mixing ratio of 1:1 and short chain lengths, we have observed a smectic/layered phase segregated structure with alternate layers of P3HT and PCBM. With an increase in the chain length, bicontinuous phase segregated morphology is found to be stable. It is argued that conformational entropy stabilizes some of these phase segregated morphologies.The average domain size of P3HT (〈D〉) in a phase segregated state is found to be dependent on the chain length and mixing ratio. We have found 〈D〉 to decrease with an increase in N, which is an outcome of enhanced phase segregation with an increase in N resulting from a decrease in entropy of mixing. In contrast, 〈D〉 increases with an increase in the volume fraction of P3HT due to a decrease in PCBM content, which drives the phase segregation. The interfacial area to volume ratio γ is inversely proportional to the average domain size and “monotonically” increases with an increase in the P3HT volume fraction ϕv and N. Theory suggests “non-monotonic” behavior for the relationship of γ and ϕv however the range of ϕv that was investigated is in the “monotonic” range and the maximum is not a 1:1 mixing ratio. We believe that the non-monotonic dependence of γ on ϕv reported earlier11 is an outcome of shorter simulation runs and use of an ad hoc computational scheme.Our results point out that for P3HT:PCBM blends with ϕm = 0.5, it is advantageous to have longer chain lengths as an increase in N leads to more pure domains, an increase in the interfacial area to volume ratio γ and decrease in domain sizes approaching 10 nm. As the limiting cases of pure P3HT and PCBM are not at all useful for OPV applications due to very low interfacial area, it is clear that there must be an optimum mixing ratio. We conclude that the optimum P3HT:PCBM ratio is dependent on the molecular weight, which is also in agreement with previous studies.66,67Our results demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate time and length scale for the simulation of donor and acceptor blends in organic photovoltaic active layers. The simulations presented here, while large by traditional simulation standards, could all be run in parallel on only 11% of the entire supercomputer resource that has now become available. Supercomputers such as Titan will allow for future studies with more sophisticated models that capture important effects due to substrate interactions and crystallization that improve our simulation capabilities for rational design of devices with improved efficiency.Experiments have supported the idea of coexistence of three phases in P3HT:PCBM blends: crystalline P3HT, amorphous P3HT intermixed with PCBM and crystalline PCBM.27,40 Our results show the presence of a phase separated P3HT:PCBM system consisting of a loosely packed pure PCBM domain and an amorphous P3HT domain with rather small intermixing with PCBM beads. This is a disadvantage of the coarse-grained model of the P3HT chain used here. This model lacks details for describing “crystalline” domains, which motivates the following discussion.For spheres, the maximum packing fraction is 0.74 corresponding to either face centered cubic or hexagonally closed packed lattice structures. However, the packing fraction of PCBM in all the phase segregated systems lies near the loosely packed state (cf.Fig. 4). Therefore we can rule out the presence of the crystalline PCBM phase. Furthermore, visual inspection of the snapshots does not reveal any lamellar domains of crystalline and amorphous P3HT chains as envisioned in experiments. To achieve the lamellar crystalline structures, temperature oscillations, long simulations, and alternative models are needed; a candidate force field would be similar to the force-field used by Schwarz et al.16,68 where a P3HT nanofiber is formed because of π–π stacking. This is beyond the scope of the present study and will be considered in subsequent work.A reverse mapping protocol was used in ref. 11 to run atomistic simulations starting from coarse-grained configurations. Using this approach, regions in space having a local orientational order parameter greater than 0.3 were used to estimate the extent of crystallinity. We have also looked at the local orientational order parameter for the P3HT bonds similar to the one defined in ref. 11 and found alignment with the addition of PCBM, which highlights effects of phase segregation on P3HT chain conformations. Details of these calculations are presented in ESI.†AcknowledgementsWe thank A. V. Dobrynin, S. M. Kilbey, T. D. Nguyen and M. Dadmun for useful discussions and C. W.
