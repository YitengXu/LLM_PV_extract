    , Accepted 30th September 2014First published on 1st October 2014AbstractUntil recently, only mesoporous TiO2 and ZnO were successfully demonstrated as electron transport layers (ETL) alongside the reports of ZrO2 and Al2O3 as scaffold materials in organometal halide perovskite solar cells, largely owing to ease of processing and to high power conversion efficiency. In this article, we explore tungsten trioxide (WO3)-based nanostructured and porous ETL materials directly grown hydrothermally with different morphologies such as nanoparticles, nanorods and nanosheet arrays. The nanostructure morphology strongly influences the photocurrent and efficiency in organometal halide perovskite solar cells. We find that the perovskite solar cells based on WO3 nanosheet arrays yield significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance as compared to nanoparticles and nanorod arrays due to good perovskite absorber infiltration in the porous scaffold and more rapid carrier transport. We further demonstrate that treating the WO3 nanostructures with an aqueous solution of TiCl4 reduces charge recombination at the perovskite/WO3 interface, resulting in the highest power conversion efficiency of 11.24% for devices based on WO3 nanosheet arrays. The successful demonstration of alternative ETL materials and nanostructures based on WO3 will open up new opportunities in the development of highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
Recent developments in the area of solution-processed solar cells have led to successful demonstrations of high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) approaching and even surpassing 10%.1–7 However, the excitonic nature of the absorbing materials, be it an organic bulk heterojunction, a quantum dot solid or a dye sensitized mesoporous oxide is usually limited by losses related to thermodynamic driving forces which are needed to accomplish the charge separation, electron-transfer and charge extraction processes in photovoltaic devices. The emergence of the solution-processed solar cells based on a hybrid organic–inorganic solid-state perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) absorber provides a viable platform to circumvent the fundamental limitations associated with other emerging photovoltaic (PV) materials. It is believed that these advantages have enabled perovskite PV devices to exhibit remarkable PCEs surpassing 15%, with many studies indicating strong prospects for >20% in foreseeable future.8,9
The most successful and commonly used mesoporous electron transporting layer (ETL) materials are nanoparticle (NP)-based mesoporous TiO2 and ZnO scaffolds which the perovskite absorber can infiltrate during film formation.8 ZrO2 and Al2O3 have also been used as scaffold materials.10,11 In addition, solution-processed high performance planar heterojunction perovskite PV devices have also been reported while employing compact TiO2 and ZnO films,12,13 with recent reports of vacuum deposited perovskites yielding PCE in excess of 15%.14 One-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 or ZnO nanostructures have alternatively been employed in place of the NP-based strategy to facilitate perovskite infiltration and continuity leading to efficient devices as well.15–18 To the best of our knowledge, the most efficient perovskite solar cells to date are based on TiO2 and ZnO-based electron transport materials.12–14 Other metal oxides such as SnO2, Nb2O5, In2O3 and SrTiO3 which were successfully demonstrated as photoelectrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are yet to be demonstrated in the field of perovskite photovoltaics.20,21 The latter materials were found to be inferior in performance compared to the TiO2 in DSSCs; nevertheless, they served as a crucial platform for understanding PV performance and for further materials development.
Motivated by the same desire for material development and device understanding, we present for the first time nanostructured and porous films of WO3 with drastically different morphologies. With a band gap in the range of 2.6–3.1 eV, depending on its crystal structure, WO3 is one of the most important n-type semiconducting oxide material.20,21 Although the band gap of WO3 is comparatively smaller than TiO2 (∼3.2 eV), it is highly stable and has the ability to survive harsh and corrosive environments such as exposure to strong acids.19 WO3 also has been shown to have higher carrier mobility than TiO2 and has therefore received significant attention from a range of fields from optics to electronics, aerospace and aeronautics.21 The remarkable ease with which WO3 can be synthesized into a wide range of nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanorods, nanowalls, nanoparticles and nanocolumns with a high surface to volume ratio makes this a very interesting material for electrochromic devices,22,23 photocatalysis,24 gas sensing,25,26 and DSSCs.20,21,27 To date, very few reports have discussed the implementation of WO3 nanostructures as photoanodes in DSSCs20,21,27 and with a maximum PCE of 1.51% (ref. 18) achieved using 1-D nanorods; the success of this material in the PV arena has been modest at best. The low performance can be ascribed to slow electron transport, less dye-adsorption and small surface area achieved thus far with WO3 nanostructures implemented in DSSCs. We take the position that careful control over the growth of WO3 nanostructures to achieve the monoclinic structure with (001) texture directly upon the transparent conducting electrode of the solar cell should yield good PV performance and that this can be made to work successfully with perovskite light absorbers.
Various methods including thermal evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), anodization and hydrothermal approaches have been used to synthesize different WO3 nanostructures.28–34 Many of these methods involve complex fabrication and challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature and single-crystalline substrates; thus hydrothermal routes are preferred because of its controllability, convenience and compatibility with larger-area fabrication. Importantly, this method can potentially yield (001)-oriented monoclinic WO3 nanostructures on transparent conductive electrodes such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO),35 which is crucial to the successful implementation of WO3 in perovskite PVs. Several reports are available about the preparation of WO3 films directly on FTO glass using a hydrothermal method, however those films were not single-facet oriented.31,36–38 One recent report has fabricated (001)-oriented monoclinic WO3 nanostructures directly on FTO substrates,30 but PV devices have not been demonstrated.
Here we report a facile and highly scalable method to grow highly ordered WO3 nanorod and nanosheet arrays directly upon the FTO-coated substrates and demonstrate the successful implementation of these layers as electron transporting layers into perovskite solar cells, opening the door to a promising new family of ETL materials for perovskite solar cells. The electrospraying method39,40 was used to fabricate uniform and dense layers of WO3 to initiate the growth, followed by a hydrothermal step to synthesize the nanorods and nanosheet arrays by adjusting the solution composition in an efficient manner. As expected, use of 1-D nanostructures (nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes) as an electron transport layer in perovskite cells facilitates enhanced infiltration of both the absorber and hole transporting material (HTM) and rapid charge transport as compared with nanoparticle-based WO3 films, in agreement with previous reports for ZnO.15–18 Next, we demonstrate two-dimensional (2-D) WO3 nanosheets with enhanced absorber infiltration as compared with 1-D nanostructures,39,40 as well as further enhancement of charge transport, resulting in improved solar cell performance. Finally, we consistently triple the PCE of all WO3-based devices by forming a thin TiO2 shell using TiCl4 treatment. The core–shell structure is shown to reduce carrier back recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface.41 Through this investigation of different WO3 ETL nanostructures, we systematically improve the PCE from 2.1 ± 0.2% up to 11.2 ± 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which utilizes the alternative WO3 n-type semiconductor as a nanostructured porous ETL to obtain highly efficient perovskite solar cells with PCE > 10%.
The perovskite solar cell configuration and the energy level diagram of the relevant materials are shown in Fig. 1. FTO glass substrates were first spin coated with a very thin and compact film of WO3 as a hole-blocking layer before the deposition of electrosprayed WO3 films composed of nanoparticles (NP) and hydrothermally grown nanorod (NR) and nanosheet (NS) arrays. A very thin (4–5 nm) and conformal layer of TiO2 was formed over the surface of WO3 nanostructures when treated with the aqueous solution of TiCl4 to suppress the charge recombination at the perovskite/WO3 film interface and improve the photovoltaic parameters. The light harvester, CH3NH3PbI3, was then cast using a sequential deposition process where the lead iodide (PbI2) solution was spin-coated over the photoanode surface before dip-coating the WO3/PbI2 film into a CH3NH3I solution.8 After drying, the HTL was deposited by spin coating the spiro-OMeTAD layer followed by Ag anode deposition via vacuum evaporation.

In Fig. 2a we show a top surface FE-SEM image of the electrosprayed layer of pure WO3 NPs ranging in size from 90 to 100 nm and which visibly possess a high degree of porosity. The cross-sectional view in Fig. 2c highlights the particle size and indicates that porosity is uniform across the entire thickness of the film (∼480 nm). In Fig. 2e we show the 1-D WO3 NR arrays grown hydrothermally over the electrosprayed WO3 seed layers. Fig. 2g shows the cross-sectional view of 1-D WO3 NR arrays with a typical length of ∼480 nm and a diameter of 30–40 nm. The NR arrays were vertically aligned with respect to the substrate surface and presented an open structure which favors rapid electron transport as well as excellent perovskite infiltration. In Fig. 2i we show well cross-linked 2-D WO3 nanosheet arrays grown hydrothermally over the electrospray-deposited WO3 seed layer. The dimensions of the pure and TiO2 coated WO3 NSs are very similar with a length of ∼450–500 nm and a width of ∼80–100 nm. The NSs are vertically oriented with random in-plane orientation over the substrate surface and do not show any cracks or gaps. The cross-sectional micrograph (Fig. 2k) reveals the film to be uniform in morphology and the dimension of NSs along the thickness direction. This type of microstructure has been previously shown to greatly benefit the diffusion of the electrolyte in DSSCs due to the high porosity and high surface area, and to enhance electron transport.39,40

In Fig. 2d, h and l we show the cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the completed devices with the structure of glass/FTO/WO3 (NP, NR or NS)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, respectively. The overlayer of CH3NH3PbI3 between WO3 NPs, NSs and NRs/CH3NH3PbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD is around 150 nm. The deposition of the spiro-OMeTAD by spin coating forms a 300 nm thin capping layer which prevents any contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and Ag.
The crystal structure of the three different WO3 nanostructures was analyzed using XRD (Fig. S1a†). The reflection peaks of the produced WO3 films completely fit with its monoclinic phase (JCPDS no. 43-1035).41 Both the 1-D NR and 2-D NS arrays showed significantly pronounced peak intensities owing to their highly textured growth and larger crystallite size as compared with NP films. Importantly, WO3 NSs exhibited (002) as the dominant crystal facet, which is consistent with single crystalline growth of WO3 nanosheets with dominant facet (002) formed perpendicular to the substrate surface. Additional crystal facets are also exposed such as (020) and (200), but these appear to be a small minority.
We now turn our attention to applying a thin TiO2 layer on the surface of WO3 nanostructures, as this has been shown in the case of ZnO to reduce the problems of insufficient dye attachment and low open-circuit voltage (Voc) in DSSCs.41 In the context of perovskite solar cells, forming a TiO2 film on the WO3 surface may have a different purpose; it is expected to provide a more basic oxide surface, which suppresses the charge recombination at the perovskite/WO3 interface and enhances the device performance. The TiO2 layer was formed by treating the WO3 NP film surface with aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C. The WO3 surface appearance changes significantly upon TiCl4 treatment, as revealed in Fig. 2b. Small dot-like features are visible around the WO3 NPs which roughen the surface of WO3 NPs. Similarly, plan-view and cross-sectional micrographs of WO3 NRs and NSs treated with TiCl4 can be seen in Fig. 2f and j, respectively. These appear to preserve their starting morphology after TiCl4 treatment more than the NPs. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the presence of titanium over the WO3 surface (Fig. S1c†). The presence of TiO2 conformal coating over the WO3 NSs is also confirmed with the help of XPS analysis as shown in Fig. S2.† The existence of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks (Fig. S2a†) at 458.4 and 464.7 eV, respectively, match closely the bands of rutile TiO2.12 In addition, the presence of two 4f7/2 (35.6 eV) and 4f5/2 (37.6 eV) peaks seen in Fig. S2b† corresponds to dual states of W.25 The peak at 530.0 eV binding energy was assigned to O 1s1/2 (Fig. S2c†). The XPS analysis conclusively shows the presence of a very thin layer of TiO2 over the surface of WO3. XRD investigation of TiCl4-treated WO3 nanostructures (Fig. S1a†) revealed no characteristic peaks associated with TiO2, probably due to the low thickness of TiO2.
Low and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of WO3 NRs and NSs coated with a thin layer of TiO2 after TiCl4 treatment are shown in Fig. 3a–d, confirming the formation of an ultrathin 4–5 nm TiO2 layer (shell) over the WO3 NRs and NSs (core). The core–shell structure can be seen clearly for both samples (Fig. 3a and b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of WO3 NRs and NSs are shown in the insets of Fig. 3a and c, respectively. The clear SAED patterns reveal that the WO3 NRs and NSs are highly crystalline in nature, monoclinic and NRs and NSs grow along (020) and (200) (zone axis (002)). The high resolution TEM images shown in Fig. 3b and d reveal that crystallographic planes perpendicular to the axis direction are separated by 0.36 nm, which coincides with the (200) plane of monoclinic WO3.31

In Fig. 4a we show the current–voltage characteristics of the perovskite solar cells based on the various WO3 nanostructures prepared with and without a thin TiO2 coating. The uncoated WO3 NS-based cells exhibit a photocurrent density (Jsc) of 6.48 mA cm−2, a Voc of 780 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, which leads to a PCE of 3.80%. By contrast, the devices based on the pure WO3 NP film showed a lower Jsc of 5.0 mA cm−2, a similar Voc of 740 mV, and a low FF of 0.58, which results in the lowest PCE of 2.14%. The WO3 NRs exhibited intermediate behavior with PCE of 3.27%. The improved performance of the 1-D WO3 NRs and 2-D WO3 NSs is believed to be due to enhanced electron transport characteristics and better infiltration of the perovskite absorber into the porous nanostructures. The highest PCE of 3.80% shown with untreated WO3 NSs based cells is much higher than any previously reported WO3-based DSSCs (only 0.75%).20,21,27 Nevertheless the proposed perovskite devices based on untreated WO3 nanostructures demonstrate far inferior performance as compared with their ZnO or TiO2 based counterparts. The performance of all nanostructured WO3 ETL-based perovskite cells increases three-fold by applying the ultra-thin TiO2 layer via TiCl4 treatment. In the case of WO3 NSs, we demonstrate the highest PCE of 11.2 ± 0.1% with a Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.870 mV and a FF of 0.76. Similarly, the TiCl4 treatment enhanced the parameters of WO3 NP and NR-based cells (Table 1).

The TiO2 shell on WO3 nanostructure surfaces may improve device performance by increasing electron lifetime and/or by shifting the conduction band edge (CBE) potential of the ETL negatively, leading to a Voc enhancement and the suppression of the dark current. Moreover, the coated TiO2 layer can retard the charge recombination at interfaces and the back electron transfer from WO3 to HTM (or perovskite CH3NH3PbI3) and significantly increases both the FF and Voc. It is well known that Voc is defined by the difference in the n-type semiconductor quasi Fermi-level and the HOMO level of the HTM in nanostructured perovskite solar cells.42 To elucidate the origin of the Voc increase for the TiCl4 treated WO3 nanostructure based cells, we investigate the electron transport and recombination behaviors for TiO2 coated and uncoated WO3 nanostructure-based cells.
In Fig. 4b we plot the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite solar cells with uncoated and TiO2-coated WO3 NP, NR and NS nanostructures as a function of wavelength. In the WO3 NS systems, the maximum EQE values increase from 29% (uncoated) up to 77% (TiO2-coated) at 520 nm along with the comparable improvements over the entire spectrum (370–750 nm), which demonstrates excellent performance improvements. A similar trend is observed for the NP and NR morphologies as well. The higher EQE value in the perovskite with TiO2 coated WO3 nanostructure thin films is attributed to faster electron transport process between the two oxide semiconductors with different energy levels. These results confirm that coating a very thin layer of TiO2 on the surface of WO3 enhances the PCE due to the reduced charge recombination at the WO3 film interface. Moreover, the considerably better EQE values for the NSs and NRs as compared to NPs confirm the significant improvement of Jsc induced by the vertical growth of nanorod and nanosheet arrays.
The charge transport characteristics within the devices are evaluated using transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay techniques. In Fig. 5 we plot the electron diffusion coefficients and time constants for electron recombination. The electron diffusion coefficients as a function of Jsc, for uncoated and TiO2-coated WO3 nanostructure based perovskite solar cells are presented in Fig. 5a. In case of uncoated WO3 nanostructures, larger values of diffusion coefficients were obtained for NS arrays and the lowest for NP films. The uncoated and TiO2-coated WO3 NSs and NRs also appear to possess an enhanced electron lifetime (Fig. 5b) as compared to NP films. It can be concluded that TiO2-coated WO3 nanostructures with highly oriented crystals (NSs and NRs) have improved diffusion of electrons are more suitable for longer distance diffusion and enhance the charge collection leading to higher Jsc.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of (a) diffusion coefficient, and (b) time constant for charge recombination of various WO3 nanostructure-based devices before and after TiCl4 treatment, respectively. 
The differences in the values of diffusion coefficients between the different nanostructures provide indirect evidence that electron injection and the electron pathway may be different depending on the nanostructure. The rapid charge transport properties for both uncoated and TiO2-coated WO3 NSs and NRs can be attributed to the elimination of lattice defects and grain boundaries between them due to the high crystalline quality of the nanostructures as compared with NP films. These types of nanostructures have smaller surface trapping sites and fewer defects which reduces the electron recombination near the electrode, while the well-developed interconnected network with a high degree of porosity serves to facilitate electron transport to the cathode. The high porosity and interconnection also facilitate the enhanced infiltration of the perovskite absorber and thus the diffusion of electrons within the nanostructured ETL. It is also assumed that improved contact between the absorbing layer and 1-D and 2-D networks leads to a synergistic effect whereby charge recombination is reduced and electron transport is promoted. In all cases, the presence of TiO2 layer on the WO3 nanostructures further enhances the electron diffusion coefficient and slows down the recombination rate. The TiO2 coating therefore clearly promotes longer recombination time which is indicative of reduced charge recombination at perovskite/WO3 or the HTM/WO3 interfaces.
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the synthesis and implementation of various WO3 nanostructures with a highly oriented crystal structure directly on FTO-coated glass as an effective electron transport material for efficient perovskite solar cells. Formation of an interconnected 2-D nanosheet WO3 film yielded better results than 1-D nanorods or nanoparticles, mainly because of enhanced carrier transport. In addition, a thin TiO2 layer applied to the surface of the WO3 nanostructures tripled the PCE of all perovskite devices as compared to the uncoated nanostructures. In the case of TiO2-coated NSs, this has yielded a PCE of 11.2%. We identity the main factors leading to the observed performance enhancement to be the suppressed charge recombination at the WO3/perovskite interface, faster charge separation and extended diffusion length of charge carriers. These demonstrated enhancements in the properties of the TiO2-coated WO3 electrodes make this material an effective transport layer for efficient perovskite solar cells and show the path towards the development of new nanostructured materials for efficient perovskite PV devices.
