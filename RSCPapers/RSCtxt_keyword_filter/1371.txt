    , Accepted 30th May 2012First published on 30th May 2012AbstractThis study carefully examines carrier dynamics in highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on a series of recently developed dicarboxyterpyridine Ru(II) dyes (PRT-11–15). Comprehensive spectral response analyses, transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements, and transient absorption techniques are exploited to investigate the effects of various functionalized terpyridines on carrier injection efficiency (ηinj), electron diffusion length (L) and dye-regeneration efficiency (ηreg). The resulting parameters are fully comprehended, which are then correlated with the origins of the device performance such as short circuit current density Jsc, open circuit voltage Voc and hence the overall conversion efficiency η in these Ru(II) based DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention during the last two decades as a potential low-cost alternative to conventional silicon photovoltaic devices due mainly to the printable mesoporous materials and simple manufacturing techniques.1–4 Thus, the development of panchromatic sensitizers to enhance the light harvesting efficiency becomes a promising method for achieving high-efficiency DSSCs. In this regard, the black dye N749 [Ru(Htctpy)(NCS)3]3− (H3tctpy = 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine) has shown an absorption profile extended to ∼900 nm.5,6 Another feasible way is to increase the extinction coefficient for peaks across the solar spectrum by extending the π-conjugation utilizing functional ancillaries.7–10 For the latter approach novel anionic complexes PRT-11–14, for which chemical structures are depicted in Scheme 1, were recently synthesized by employment of a highly conjugated π-electron-donating appendage on the H3tctpy.11 All PRT series dyes show high extinction coefficients across the visible towards the near infrared range. Devices based on the PRT dyes also show promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–10.3%, which are comparable to or higher than the PCE value of N749 reference cells (8.54%).11 These exciting results encourage us to gain further insight into the photophysical dynamics in cells that adopt this new class of Ru(II) sensitizers. In this study, we have applied spectral response analysis,12–16 small perturbation transient photovoltage (TPV) and photocurrent (TPC) measurements,17,18 and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS)18–20 with an aim to quantify as well as decipher the efficiency of charge injection (ηinj), charge collection (ηcol), and regeneration (ηreg). Moroever, in order to show a more systematic comparison, Ru(II) complex with electron withdrawing group CF3 attached at the terminal pyridyl group, cf.PRT-15, is also synthesized. Spectral response analysis is developed for estimating the ηinj and the electron diffusion length of DSSCs. The TPV/TPC measurement, a time domain method, is deemed a useful technique to measure the electron lifetime and charge density of DSSCs at an internal field condition of zero (near Voc). TAS is a direct time-resolved method to probe the dynamics of oxidized dyes by detecting dye–electron recombination and dye regeneration. Intriguingly, regardless that all PRT dyes exhibit similar oxidation potentials and LUMO levels, in part, due to solely modification of the ancillary group on the terpyridine ligand, the devices showed quite different ηinj, L, and hence collection (ηcol) and recombination (ηreg) efficiencies, resulting in a large discrepancy in the PCEs. Details of the results and discussion are elaborated in the following sections.

2. Method and experiment
2.1 Materials and cell fabrication
Syntheses of PRT-11–14 dyes were documented in a previous report.11PRT-15 is a newly developed dye, for which the synthesis and characterization are described in the supporting information.† Procedures for cells fabrication were in principle following the protocol of our previous report.11 Nonetheless, to be suited for various measurements of carrier dynamics, certain modification was necessary. In brief, transparent conductive glass (FTO, 9 Ω cm−2) was used to construct both the photoanode and the cathode. The TiO2 films were deposited by screen printing with commercially available TiO2 (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix) for the highly transparent TiO2 electrode in the DSSC. A scattering layer was not used for the fabrication of highly transparent cells required by the photophysical measurements in this study. The TiO2 electrodes used for cell fabrication were approximately 9 μm thick and with an area of 0.16 cm2. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M DMPII (1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile.
2.2 Current density–voltage measurements
DSSC current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2636A Source Meter under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation from a 100 W Xenon lamp solar simulator (Abet Technologies), which has been calibrated at 100 mM cm−2 by using a silicon reference cell.
2.3 Optical measurements and light harvesting profiles
Transmission spectra of FTO (TFTO), platinum layers (TPt), bare TiO2 layers (TTiO2), dye-anchored TiO2 layers (Tdye) and bulk electrolytes (TI) were measured using a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrometer. Assuming that dye loading is independent of position and that dye molecules induce negligible scattering of light, the absorption coefficients (α(λ)) of dye anchored on TiO2 can be calculated using eqn (1): (1)where d is the thickness of dye-anchored TiO2 layer.

Formulas (2) and (3) estimate light harvesting profiles through the TiO2 films for light incident from both the substrate electrode side (GSE(x,λ)) and the counter electrode side (GCE(x,λ)): GSE(x,λ) = TFTO(λ)α(λ)φ(λ)e−(α(λ)+αI(λ))x(2) GSE(x,λ) = TFTO(λ)TPt(λ)TI(λ)α(λ)φ(λ)e−(α(λ)+αI(λ))(x−d)(3)Parameter φ(λ) is the incident light flux. The light harvesting efficiency thus could be determined by (4) (5)The parameters (TFTO(λ), TFTO(λ)TPt(λ) and αI(λ)) employed in the calculation were experimentally determined and shown in the Fig. S3 (supporting information†).
2.4 External quantum efficiency (EQE), diffusion length and injection efficiency
The EQE responses were measured by illuminating chopped monochromatic light with a continuous-wave bias white light (from a halogen lamp) on the solar cells. The photocurrent signals were extracted with a lock-in technique using a current preamplifier (Stanford Research System) followed by a lock-in amplifier (AMETEK). The EQE measurement was computer-controlled, and the intensity of the monochromatic light was carefully calibrated with a NIST-traceable optical power meter (Ophir Optronics). The EQE spectra were recorded using illumination from the substrate side (ηSE) and the counter electrode side (ηCE).
Diffusion length (L), defined as L = (D0τ0)0.5, is used for estimating the efficiency of charge collection by the substrate electrode because of diffusion of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. D0 is the diffusion coefficient, and τ0 is the electron lifetime. The charge concentration (nc(x,λ)) generated by the incident light flux can be solved by the electron diffusion continuity equation: (6)where nc(x,λ) is the electron concentration in the conduction band at a steady state, and nc0 is equilibrium electron concentration in the dark. Assuming that the diffusion coefficient, electron lifetime, and ηinj are independent of position in the cells, the nc(x,λ) in eqn (6) could be solved at a short circuit condition, in which nc(0) = nc0 and ∂nc(d)/∂x = 0.
According to ηSE, CE = [D0∂nc(0)/∂x]/φ, and eqn (4) and (5), the substrate/counter electrode side (SE/CE) EQE, ηSE and ηCE can be expressed as: (7) (8)By fitting the experimental ηSE and ηCE data with eqn (7) and (8), L and ηinj can thus be determined.
2.5 Transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were taken using a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser (Rhodamin 6G, the lasing range of the laser is 555 nm–585 nm with a maximum at 566 nm) as an excitation source. A 100 W variable intensity halogen lamp was used as the bias light. The excitation intensity was controlled to keep the maximum amplitude of the photovoltage decays below 20 mV. The transient signals were amplified by a voltage and current preamplifier for the TPV and TPC and recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix). Averages of 32 to 64 traces were taken to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
The TPV decays were used to extract the electron recombination lifetime (τn). The charge concentration in TiO2 can be determined by (9)where C is the chemical capacitance, A is the cell area and p is the TiO2 porosity. C was calculated using C = Q/ΔV(10)In eqn (10), ΔV is the amplitude of the TPV. Q denotes the injection charges upon excitation, which could be measured with TPC.
2.6 Transient absorption measurements
The dye laser as used in the TPV and TPC measurements was utilized as the pump beam and a tungsten lamp was used as the probe light source. A combination set of long-wavelength-pass and short-wavelength-pass filters were used to confine the wavelength of the probe light to a range of 700 nm–1000 nm, ensuring that no excited or oxidized dyes formed before pump beam excitation. Transient absorption dynamics were recorded by a bandpass filtered (FWHM = 10 nm and central wavelength 700 nm–1000 nm) high-speed silicon photodiode. All transient measurements were recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix), which was synchronized with the pump source. Transient absorption dynamics were fitted using double stretched exponential decays to analyze the dye-regeneration:20,21 (11)where ΔO.D. is the change in optical density with time (t), β is the stretch parameter and τww is the stretched exponential lifetime. The weighted average lifetimes of stretched exponential (τobs) were extracted using the following equation. (12)
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the UV-vis absorption spectra in methanol solution and on the TiO2 surface, respectively. All PRT dyes exhibit a longer wavelength absorption centered at 600 nm, for which its characteristic is analogous to that of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition of N749 and, thus, is best assigned as the MLCT transition from the Ru(II) metal dπ orbital to the dicarboxyterpyridine π* orbital. The intensity of MLCT absorption for PRT-11 is lower than that for N749 because of the lack of the third carboxy auxochrome, which is expected to induce a relatively higher molar extinction coefficient.6 Nonetheless, with the attachment of strong electron donating moieties (thiophene in PRT-12, EDOT in PRT-13, and EDOT and triphenylamine in PRT-14), MLCT absorptions progressively increase in intensity and the π–π* absorption in the range of 350 nm–500 nm is both red-shifted and enhanced in intensity.7–10,22,23 The energy levels shown in previous work indicate that all of the dyes, including PRT-15 (E0′* = 0.91 V, and E0* = −0.76 V versus NHE), exhibit proper HOMO and LUMO levels, which are suitable for making DSSCs.11 This indicates that electron injection and dye regeneration should be sufficiently efficient in the titled PRT dye system.

Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the J–V characteristics of the PRT and N749 cells. Except for PRT-11 and PRT-15, Jsc values for the PRT cells are higher than that obtained with the N749 device. The decreased Jsc for the PRT-11 cell is attributed to the absence of the third carboxy auxochrome. Although PRT-12, -13, and -14 possess only two carboxy groups, the increased absorption at a wavelength range of 350 nm–500 nm leads to higher Jsc. In contrast, the PRT-15 cell shows a low Jsc, which could be attributed to inefficient electron injection, collection, or dye regeneration, as elaborated in a later section.

As listed in Table 2, the injection efficiencies for PRT-11 and PRT-14 are comparable to that for a device fabricated with N749. Moreover, PRT-12 and PRT-13 cells show EQEs of up to 80%. Despite having the same anchoring group as other dyes, however, PRT-15 shows a low injection efficiency. Such a difference is only partially caused by the lowered driving force for the electron injection, simply because the experimentally determined oxidation potential of PRT-15 at the excited state (ELUMO = −0.76 V) is slightly lower than those for the other dyes (−0.85 ∼ −0.80 V) (see Table S2†), but is still higher than that for the TiO2 conducting band potential. Furthermore, Fig. S1 and S2 in the supporting information† depict detailed electron distributions and the energy levels of the LUMO orbitals of the title dyes. Evidently, the LUMO energy level of PRT-15 is sufficiently lower than that of the rest of the PRT dyes and the distribution of electron density is also delocalized over that of the CF3-substituted pyridyl group. These results can be rationalized by the electron withdrawing property of the CF3 substituent that decreases the corresponding π orbital energy levels.24 Accordingly, the low injection efficiency could be attributed to the low-lying LUMO level of PRT-15 as well as the lack of direct contact between the CF3-substituted pyridyl group and TiO2 surface.
The comparable ηinj between PRT-11 and N749 cells implies that two carboxy groups provide sufficiently strong binding to TiO2 for efficient electron injection.25,26 The increased ηinj of PRT-12 and PRT-14 cells is mainly because of electron-donating moieties at the ancillary site. The value of ηinj in cell PRT-14 is slightly decreased compared to that of ηinj recorded for PRT-12 and PRT-13. This could be attributed to the large space barrier produced by the functional triphenylamine group in PRT-14, resulting in poorer dye anchoring on the TiO2 than for the other PRT dyes in this series.
Because the electron diffusion length, L, of the cells based on the PRT series is longer than the TiO2 thickness used in devices, the electrodes successfully collect almost all injected electrons.16,27 The extracted ηinj and L values fully explain the different Jsc values generated in the devices. Voc is also an important parameter in determining cell efficiency, which is closely related to the rate constant of the recombination and electron concentration.20,28–31 By observing the charge densities for cells under various illumination intensities and estimating the recombination lifetime as a function of electron concentration, the Voc variation of the PRT series dyes can be analyzed via TPV and TPC techniques to acquire the electron concentrations in the DSSCs.

Fig. 4 shows electron concentration as a function of Voc induced by different illumination intensities. A leftward shift of the charge density was observed in the PRT-11 cell compared with the N749 cell. We attribute this result to the lack of a third carboxy group on the ancillary site in PRT-11, so that more Li+ ions can reach the TiO2 surface, lowering Voc.32–35 In PRT-12, -13 and -14, a larger ancillary group causes a more rightward shift in the carrier density distribution. In theory, the space barrier and coordinating side chains formed by the ancillary group could inhibit Li+ ions from reaching the TiO2 surface, resulting in an increase of Voc.36,37 As a result, the Voc values for PRT-12 and PRT-13 are 44 mV and 60 mV, respectively, which are higher than that for cell PRT-11. Fig. 5 shows electron lifetime τn as a function of electron concentration extracted by TPV measurements. The electron lifetime for PRT-14 and PRT-15 cells decreases, i.e. there is a higher decay rate constant, with an increase in charge density. The results indicate that faster recombination rates occur in PRT-14 and PRT-15 cells with higher charge densities (at high illumination intensities). This could lead to the low Voc for PRT-14 (630 mV) and PRT-15 (594 mV) under 1 sun illumination conditions.38–40

Finally, it is noteworthy that PRT-12 to -14 have a lower Voc compared to N749, which contradicts the prediction shown in Fig. 4, indicating a higher Voc with a more rightward curve. This discrepancy may be attributed to different dye-regeneration abilities20,30,41,42 as supported by the transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), which was used to probe the dynamics of the oxidized dyes in the DSSCs. For efficient Ru(II) dyes, regeneration occurs from 10−7 to 10−4 s.20,43,44Fig. 6 shows the transient absorption dynamics of N749 and PRT series dyes in the presence of redox electrolytes and under open circuit conditions. The corresponding fits and the τobs of the fast stretched exponential decays are also shown in Fig. 6. With the shortest τobs, N749 has the best regeneration ability compared to the other PRT dyes. PRT-11 shows a similar τobs to that of the N749, indicating a high regeneration rate between oxidized PRT-11 and redox species. Conversely, dyes PRT-12 to -14 show slower stretched-exponential decay, which could plausibly be due to them having low regeneration efficiencies.20,43,45 The lower regeneration efficiencies of PRT-12 to -14 compared to N749 would result in lower Voc. values. Moreover, a systematic trend of regeneration ability could be found, that is the larger the ancillary group (PRT-14 > PRT-13 > PRT-12 > PRT-11), the lower the regeneration rate constant would be (PRT-14 (20.07 μs) < PRT-13 (12.25 μs) < PRT-12 (8.76 μs) < PRT-11 (2.48 μs)), establishing a good empirical correlation among the title PRT series.

4. Conclusions
To sum up, quantification of individual operating steps (ηinj, ηcol, ηreg, …) using a combination of EQE analysis, TPV, TPC, and TAS is reported. The resulting data are then used to examine the effects of different ancillary groups on the Voc and Jsc of efficient dicarboxyterpyridine Ru(II) DSSCs. Similar or even increased injection efficiencies for the PRT series compared to the N749 cell indicate that two carboxy groups in the terpyridine moiety are sufficient for efficient electron injection. With highly conjugated π-electron-donating appendages, PRT-12 and PRT-13 show increased light harvesting abilities (an increase of the extinction coefficients) and increased injection efficiencies (electron pushing effects) compared to N749. These modifications result in higher Jsc values for PRT-12 and PRT-13 cells than that for the N749 reference device. In addition, bulky and hydrophobic pendants may also increase the device stabilities compared to that for N749.11,46,47 Excessive extension of the π-conjugated ancillary group however would lower the injection efficiency, as observed in PRT-14, which is attributed to an insufficient amount of dye loading on the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, Voc is an equally important DSSC parameter. Our studies have also revealed that the π-conjugated ancillary could act as a space barrier to prevent excessive Li+ ions from approaching the TiO2 surface, thereby improving the Voc values. Poor coverage of the TiO2 surface, caused by a large ancillary group (for instance, PRT-14), may enhance charge recombination at the interface between TiO2 and electrolyte solution. Also, π-conjugated ancillary groups may lead to poorer regeneration ability. Additionally, functionalization of the H3tctpy chelate using an electronegative CF3 group (such as in PRT-15) renders very poor injection efficiency and serious recombination.
We also conclude that functionalization of the H3tctpy with a highly conjugated π-electron-donating appendage is a promising approach to increase molar extinction coefficients of dyes. However, the manipulation of π-electron-donating moieties clearly leads to a balanced effect among injection efficiency, charge recombination, and dye regeneration. Judicious molecular design and accurate control of these factors should result in highly efficient DSSCs. The relationships between the molecular structures of dicarboxyterpyridine Ru(II) dyes and the photophysical properties of the devices reported here should provide valuable guidelines for the future molecular design of efficient Ru(II)-based sensitizers.
