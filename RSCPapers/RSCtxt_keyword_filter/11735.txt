    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 4th September 2018AbstractConsidering the facile synthesis of the cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) building block, this study aims to synthesize and characterize two donor–acceptor type conjugated molecules, 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2, with different branching points from the backbone. It was found that the branching point variation strategy slightly tunes the optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting conjugated molecule films owing to the difference between their intermolecular packing. When used as a donor material in PC71BM-based organic solar cells (OSCs), the power conversion efficiency of 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 is twice that of the ones processed using 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. Interestingly, with no post treatments, OSCs were optimized with especially low-donor content within the active layer (donor:acceptor weight ratio = 1:9), which allows construction of a highly transparent film with a visible transmittance over 50%, showing potential for application in integrated photovoltaics.
Introduction
Polymer-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention in academia and industry owing to their potential value in the global solar energy market.1–3 Recent advancements that have combined narrow band gap donor–acceptor polymer donors with soluble acceptors in a bulk heterojunction architecture have yielded power conversion efficiency (PCE) values over 10%.4–9 Recently, OSCs based on conjugated molecules have emerged as an alternative to the polymer counterparts owing to their well-defined structures without batch-to-batch variations, easy control of energy levels by designing a chemical structure, and relatively simple synthesis and purification.10–12 One of the most successful OSC conjugated molecular skeletons can be described as containing a central donor core flanked by acceptor units and terminated with π-conjugated end-capping groups.13–15
Cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), a fused ring bithiophene derivative, has attracted significant attention as a donor block for the construction of state-of-the-art narrow band gap donor–acceptor polymer donors. This is due to its efficient electron-donating nature and high co-planarity with strong intermolecular π–π interactions, as well as its facile synthesis from commercially available reagents and simple side-chain manipulation for solubility.16,17 In fact, the Si or Ge analogues (e.g., dithienosilole and dithienogermole building blocks) have been used for the successful synthesis of OSC molecular frameworks,18–23 however they have tedious multiple synthetic routes and difficulty in tuning side-chains. Therefore, a vast library of CPDT-containing polymers is reported in the field of organic electronics including OSCs and organic field-effect transistors. However, little attention has been paid to the design of discrete CPDT-based conjugated molecules.24,25
In this work, two conjugated molecules, 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2, were designed and synthesized with 2-ethylhexyl and 5-ethylnonyl side chains on the CPDT core, respectively, where they are affixed by the external 5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) and bithiophene moieties. While optimizing the OSCs, a surprisingly low 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:9 was found to provide the highest performance, yielding an average PCE of 3.2%, which lead to active materials that are transparent across the visible spectrum. We believe that this study contributes to a better understanding of the structure–property relationships in conjugated molecule-based OSCs and facilitates the design of new compounds for advanced high-performance transparent and semi-transparent photovoltaic devices.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 was carried out via a series of Migita–Kosugi–Stille cross-coupling reactions. The synthetic routes and structures are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed procedures and spectroscopic characterization are given in the Experimental section.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. 
The initial step during the synthesis involves a dialkylation onto the bridging methylene group of the CPDT core under basic conditions (KOH/KI). 5-Ethylnonyl-bromide was obtained by the following synthetic sequence: the coupling reaction of an alkyl halide with a Grignard reagent, hydroboration–oxidation, and bromination.26 Additionally, the different reactivities of the two bromide functionalities in 4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole enabled access to the desired regioisomers where the two fluorine atoms are in a symmetric proximal/proximal configuration with respect to the central CPDT core.18–22 Both products exhibit high solubility in most organic solvents and were structurally characterized using elemental analysis, solution NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

Fig. 1a depicts the normalized UV-vis absorbance spectra of neat 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 in chloroform solution and thin films. Both 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 display dual absorption bands with distinct high and low energy bands attributed to localized π–π* and internal charge transfer transitions, respectively.15,18 Such absorption profiles are typically possessed by donor–acceptor type π-conjugated molecules. Their solution absorption spectra reveal a remarkable similarity, while a red shift of both the absorption onset (λonset) and maximum (λmax) in the film absorption spectra of 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 relative to 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 is observed. The optical band gap is reduced by 0.10 eV for 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 in comparison with that of 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. A rational explanation for this observation is the greater molecular ordering of 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 in the solid state, which results in an improved inter-chromophore electronic coupling. This notion is consistent with the literature findings where moving the alkyl chain branching point away from conjugated backbones potentially allows the backbones to come closer and facilitates charge transport through intermolecular contact.27–29 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the conjugated molecules were determined from thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, showing quasi-reversible oxidation and non-reversible reduction waves (Fig. 1b). The LUMO levels (−3.54 to −3.56 eV) are nearly identical for both molecules, while the HOMO level (−5.10 eV) for 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 is 0.15 eV higher than that of 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 (−5.25 eV). Furthermore, we also measured the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of the two material films (Fig. S4, ESI†). The UPS-derived HOMO levels show a similar trend and agree with the CV results. From these CV and UPS results, we can conclude that the oxidation is more facile and readily accommodated by the closer backbone packing induced by moving the alkyl branch site away from the CPDT backbone. Density functional theory calculations were also performed at the B3LYP/6-31G level using Gaussian 09. For computational simplicity, the 2-ethylhexyl and 5-ethylnonyl chains on the CPDT core were replaced with 2-methylpropyl and 5-methylhexyl units, and the terminal hexyl chains were changed to methyl groups. Both the models displayed almost identical molecular geometries and distributions of the HOMO and LUMO energies (Fig. 1c and Fig. S5, ESI†).

The photovoltaic properties of the donor molecules were evaluated in a conventional BHJ configuration (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:(6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/Ca/Al) under an inert atmosphere. The detailed procedures for the device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. We carefully optimized the OSC performance via controlling the donor:acceptor blend ratio within the active layer. Fig. 2a–c show the short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE as a function of the donor:acceptor weight ratio for 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 OSCs. The best performance was found with a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:9, which gave the highest JSC, VOC, and FF values among the tested systems. Although the PCE values in the proposed study are lower in comparison to state of the art OSCs, it is worth noting that both donor molecules show the best-performing OSCs with extremely low-donor content in the active layer, which, to the best of our knowledge, is rarely seen for other conjugated donor materials.15,18,30–32 Interestingly, thermal and solvent-additive (1,8-diiodooctane) treatments decreased the device performance (Table S1, ESI†) and therefore, the devices functioned the best without such post processing treatments.13,31,33–36Fig. 2d shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQE) for the best-performing OSCs (a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:9), while the photovoltaic parameters are detailed in Table 1 (see Table S2 for the complete device data as a function of the donor:acceptor ratio, ESI†). The 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2-based devices without any post treatments demonstrated an average PCE of 3.2%, which was more than twice that of those based on 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. The enhancement in PCE is mainly due to the improved JSC and VOC. While the slightly deeper-lying HOMO of 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 does support the improvement in VOC, we believe that there is still scatter in the data due to the other factors. In addition, it is also clear that, in comparison to devices based on 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2), 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)-based devices show higher photo-conversion efficiency in the wavelength range from 300 to 750 nm, with the highest monochromatic EQE value over 60% at around 400 nm. A low donor OSC is beneficial because due to strong PCBM absorption at short wavelengths, the active layer can be made to be highly transparent; the optimized 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2):PC71BM film displays over 65% transparency at long wavelengths beyond 650 nm and its average visible transmittance (AVT) calculated from the whole visible region (370–740 nm) is 50.4% (Fig. 3a).37 To demonstrate the proposed application of this type of OSC, Fig. 3b shows an image of this optimized and nearly transparent film with the flowers behind clearly visible.

To understand the texture and molecular packing of the active layer morphology, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was collected for the neat and optimized blend films, as shown in Fig. 4. Their corresponding 1d line cuts in the qz and qxy directions are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). In addition to the observation of many diffraction spots induced by multiple degrees of crystalline order, both neat films exhibited preferential edge-on π-stacking with respect to the substrate with the evidence of a strong (100) lamellar peak along qz and a (010) π–π peak along qxy. In comparison with 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2, the neat 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 film showed more intense diffraction peaks, a strong enhancement of higher-order lamellar peaks, and a higher crystalline correlation length (CCL010), which was determined using the Scherrer relation (7.7 nm for 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2vs. 16.9 nm for 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2).38 These observations suggest a greater extent of order and packing within 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption results above.

In contrast, for both BHJ films, there were scarcely any distinct diffraction peaks in both the qz and qxy directions, except for a symmetric circle at ∼1.38 Å−1 corresponding to the intramolecular PC71BM distances. This signifies that the donor conjugated molecules are just dispersed into the PC71BM matrix without properly forming crystalline structures, which is most likely due to their very low content in the blend system. The amorphous and featureless textures of both the blend films are further supported by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, which show very fine and smooth surfaces with a small root-mean-square roughness (below 1 nm) (Fig. 5). It is noteworthy that the 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 blend showed small indents with some pinholes, indicating poor film quality, which could explain the lower performance of this blend compared to that with 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2.

Conclusion
In this study, we synthesized two novel discrete conjugated molecules, 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 and 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2, based on an alternating donor–acceptor architecture for OSC applications by utilizing the easily accessible CPDT building core and modifying the branching position of the side-chains. With a branch point shifted away from the CPDT backbone, 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 showed a red-shifted absorption spectrum for the film and a higher-lying HOMO level with respect to 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2. The best OSC based on 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM without additional post processing exhibited a more than 2-fold higher average PCE value than that of the 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2-based OSC. Interestingly, unlike other conjugated donor materials, the optimized OSCs in this study were determined to have an extremely low donor content within the active layer (a donor:acceptor ratio of 1:9), which enabled the fabrication of a highly transparent film (a high AVT of 50.4%). These results indicate that CPDT-based molecules are effective for use in transparent and semitransparent OSCs.
Experimental sections
General procedures and methods
All starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and Acros and used without further purification. All solvents are of ACS grade unless otherwise noted. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a VNMRS 400 MHz spectrophotometer using CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 (Varian USA) spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on Solartron electrochemical station (METEK, Versa STAT3) with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. A Ag/Ag+ electrode, a platinum wire, and a platinum electrode were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode, respectively. The Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an external standard, whose oxidation potential is set at −4.8 eV with respect to a zero vacuum level. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO (eV) = −(Eonset(ox) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8). The LUMO levels of polymers were obtained from the equation LUMO (eV) = −(Eonset(red) − Eonset(ferrocene) + 4.8). AFM was collected using a Bruker Dimension Icon Atomic Force Microscope with an RTESP-150 probe in the standard tapping mode.

2a (1 g, 2.5 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (25 ml) and kept at −78 °C under nitrogen flow. Then, n-butyllithium (2.2 ml, 5.5 mmol, 2.5 M in hexane) was slowly added. Subsequently, after stirring at −78 °C for 1 h, a trimethyltin chloride solution (5.5 ml, 5.5 mmol, 1.0 M in THF) was added. The reaction mixture was then slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The mixture was quenched by adding water and extracted with diethyl ether 3 times. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The final product was obtained by column chromatography (AlOx, n-hexane contained 10% of trimethylamine) to give 3a (1.4 g, 77%) as a pale yellow oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ) 6.98 (m, 2H), 1.85 (m, 4H), 1.30 (m, 2H), 0.92 (m, 16H), 0.78 (t, 6H), 0.62 (t, 6H), 0.38 (m, 18H).

GIWAXS measurements were carried out on beamline 11-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light source (SSRL) with the help of Dr Chris Tassone. The beam was kept at an energy of 12.7 keV with an incidence angle of 0.13°. A LaB6 standard sample was used to calibrate the instrument and software WxDiff ver 1.20 was used to reduce the 2d scattering data into the corrected 1d integration plots (I vs. q).39 Neat films and bulk-heterojunction films were coated on top of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083)/Si.
OSC device fabrication
Pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) was sonicated for 5 minutes each in a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) purchased from Sigma Aldrich in 18 MΩ water obtained from a Millipore Direct Q 3 UV system, then acetone, and then isopropanol. The ITO was then UV-ozone cleaned for 10 minutes. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was filtered with a 13 mm 0.45 μm Nylon syringe, spun coat on cleaned ITO at 5000 rpm for 50 seconds, and then dried on a 120 °C hotplate in air for 10 minutes. Solutions of either 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 or 5EN-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 with PC71BM (15 mg ml−1 total solid concentration) were spin coated on PEDOT:PSS/ITO at 800 rpm for 50 seconds in an Ar filled glove box. The top electrode was formed by sequential deposition of 10 nm Ca followed by 100 nm Al in a thermal evaporator at a pressure of 10−5 mbar. Devices were tested with a Newport ABB class solar simulator attached to a Keithley 2410 SMU source meter for AM 1.5G measurements calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. The device active area is 0.08 cm2, which is defined by the overlapping area of the top and bottom electrodes.
