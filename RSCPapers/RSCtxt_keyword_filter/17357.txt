    , Accepted 2nd September 2022First published on 5th September 2022AbstractRecently, the application of internet of things devices to semipermanent indoor power systems has garnered significant attention. In this context, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with unique optoelectronic properties under dim illumination conditions are believed to be particularly suitable for application in indoor energy-harvesting systems. In this paper, an additional PTQ10 homojunction hole transport layer (HTL) is introduced into PTQ10:Y6 OPVs via a simple and effective transfer lamination method. The introduction of the HTL suppresses defect densities drastically and maximizes quasi-Fermi level splitting, leading to a dramatic improvement in indoor performance with the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing by more than 25%. Optimized indoor OPVs equipped with the proposed HTL exhibit an improvement in PCE by 26.5% under a 1000 lx LED and an output power density of 413 μW cm−2 under 1000 lx halogen conditions, both of which are the highest recorded values. This demonstrates the practical viability of operating low-power indoor electron devices using the proposed architecture.
Introduction
Recently, the use of indoor low-power electronic devices, such as sensor nodes for the Internet of Things (IoT), has increased drastically; thus, semi-permanent energy harvesting systems based on ambient energy sources have garnered significant attention.1–6 To date, several types of ambient energy harvesting systems (piezoelectrics, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, etc.) have been proposed and explored.7–11 Of these, indoor photovoltaics (PVs), which draw power from artificial light sources to operate indoor electronic systems, are considered to be the most promising owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high proximity to the energy source.12–15 Of the various indoor PVs with distinctive photoactive materials, e.g., silicon, organics, perovskite materials, etc., organic PVs (OPVs) exhibit the highest energy harvesting efficiency from artificial light owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties under dim illumination conditions.16–22 In addition, their availability in various colors and suitable performance endurance under indoor environmental stresses make them preferable for indoor use. Recently, many processes have been developed to improve the performance of indoor OPVs, including material synthesis and device engineering, which culminated in a record high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 30% by using a donor polymer, [(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-2F, PM6), and a small molecule acceptor, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4 e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (BTP-O-4F, Y6-O).23
The fundamental strategies to achieve high indoor performance, especially to attain high PCE of OPVs, are not much different from those in the outdoor case. For example, absorbing the largest possible number of photons and securing effective charge transport channels are common requirements irrespective of the type of light source (1 sun conditions or indoor light). However, the light intensities of various indoor light sources are lower than that of solar light by factors exceeding 500, thereby necessitating slight alterations in device engineering to achieve high indoor performance. To pursue different optimization approaches under various illumination conditions, an equivalent circuit model is often used (for further details on the equivalent circuit model, please refer to the ESI (Fig. S1†)). Under dim indoor illumination conditions, the inevitable decrease in photocurrent (Jph) amplifies the dependence of device performance on the leakage current passing through the shunt resistance (RP) in the circuit. However, low values of Jph induce high insensitivity to series resistance (RS) owing to the likelihood of reduction of the induced potential loss from the RS.19,24–26 Therefore, the highest possible RP and a moderately low RS are required to maximize indoor performance. Similarly, under solar light, a low RS and an adequately high RP are required for high performance.
Several attempts have been made to fabricate high-performance indoor OPVs based on the altered impacts of the parasitic resistances, RP, and RS. A relatively thick photoactive layer (>800 nm) with the semi-crystalline photoactive donor, poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT), was implemented in a study. Resistive electrodes, e.g., zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin dioxide (SnO2), which are not suitable for electrodes of outdoor OPVs, have been successfully utilized in indoor OPVs. In addition, charge-collecting interlayers, e.g., tungsten oxide (WO3), polyethyleneimine ethoxylated-modified ZnO, and 2,9-bis[3-(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetrone (PDINO), have been adopted owing to their enhanced band alignment for dim illumination-optimized charge selectivity and reduced recombination.27–31
In this study, we propose a novel but simple method that leverages altered resistance effects to significantly improve the indoor performance of OPVs. To this end, we introduced a transfer-laminated homojunction hole-transport layer (HTL). Poly[[6,7-difluoro[(2-hexyldecyl)oxy]-5,8-quinoxalinediyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl ] (PTQ10) was used as both the HTL and the photoactive donor material and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) was utilized as the acceptor. PTQ10 is suitable for commercializing indoor devices with low cost and synthetic complexity. The synergistic effects of the addition of the homojunction HTL and the utilization of the lamination method further increased the RP owing to the suppression of interfacial defects. In addition, it also maximized quasi-fermi-level splitting. PTQ10:Y6 OPVs with the PTQ10 HTL were observed to exhibit superb indoor performance with an improved fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC), yielding PCE values of 26.5%, 23.9%, and 5.9% under a 1000 lx LED, a fluorescent lamp (FL), and halogen (HL) conditions, respectively. Notably, the PCE of 5.9% under a HL is approximately 25.5% higher than that of the device in the absence of the HTL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest recorded PCE under HL conditions.
Results and discussion
The OPVs with the structure glass/ITO/ZnO/PTQ10:Y6/none or PTQ10/MoOX/Ag are fabricated to investigate the effect of the additional PTQ10 HTL on the photovoltaic performance of devices (Fig. 1a). Further details about the fabrication of devices are presented in the Experimental section. A low-work function (WF) ZnO-coated ITO (WF value: 4.2 eV) was positioned at the bottom of the OPV device referred to as an electron-collecting electrode (ECE). Additionally, a bilayer of MoOX and Ag (WF value: 5.0 eV) was placed at the top of the OPV device working as a high-WF hole-collecting electrode (HCE). A mixture of PTQ10 and Y6, exhibiting nearly panchromatic absorption (from 400 nm to 950 nm), was used as the photoactive layer (Fig. 1b). A transfer-laminated PTQ10 layer was inserted between the photoactive layer and the HCE in the experimental device (henceforth denoted as the control device), while no layer was included in the reference device (henceforth denoted as the reference device). Film-transfer lamination allows dry non-invasive thin film deposition with minimized defect states or alignment and is particularly suitable for the fabrication of homojunction bilayers.32 Further details regarding the energy levels of all elements and the chemical structures of the photoactive materials used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1c. To confirm the presence of the PTQ10 layer in between the active layer and the anode, the absorption spectra of the PTQ10:Y6 photoactive layer and a bilayer (PTQ10:Y6 and transfer-laminated PTQ10) were measured via ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. A slightly increased absorption profile was observed in the bilayer over the spectral range of 500–600 nm, corresponding to the absorption range of PTQ10, confirming the presence of the additional PTQ10 layer (Fig. 1b). The successful lamination of the PTQ10 layer can be further verified by referring to the red-colored area in the image (inside box) depicted in Fig. 1a.

Next, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to examine the evolution of surface morphologies of the films with and without the lamination of the PTQ10 layer. AFM images with root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values determined based on the AFM height profiles over an area of 1 μm2 are shown in Fig. 2a. A clear difference was observed between the RMS roughness values (PTQ10:Y6: 1.1 nm vs. PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10: 0.7 nm) before and after lamination of the additional PTQ 10 layer which clearly indicates the existence of a PTQ10 layer on top of the PTQ10:Y6 layer. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained to confirm the presence of PTQ10. Fig. S2† and 2b depict the top-down and cross-sectional profiles of the reference device and control device, respectively. The successful transfer of the PTQ10 film to PTQ10:Y6 was confirmed from the top-down view. Similarly, the cross-sectional SEM image revealed that the thickness of the photoactive layer was increased from 136 nm to 144 nm after transfer printing, further validating the presence of PTQ10.

Furthermore, to investigate the influence of the additional PTQ10 layer on device performance, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics curves of the OPV devices with and without the PTQ10 layer were compared under various illumination conditions, including 1 sun and three indoor lights (HL, LED, and FL). Fig. 3a and b depict the J–V curves under 1 sun and HL illumination, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices, including VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), FF, and PCE, are summarized in Table 1. Since HLs exhibit higher output power density than the other indoor light sources (e.g., LEDs and FLs), greater electricity production was expected. The device's performance under dim illumination conditions (under LEDs and FLs) was also examined.

Under 1 sun illumination, the reference device (i.e., the device without the additional PTQ10 layer) and the optimized control device (i.e., the device with the transfer-printed PTQ10 layer) exhibited comparable photovoltaic performances. The reference device exhibited VOC = 830 ± 2 mV, JSC = 27.5 ± 0.2 mA cm−2, and FF = 65.5 ± 0.1%, yielding PCE = 14.9 ± 0.1%, which was consistent with previously published reports on PTQ10-based OPVs.33 Unlike the reference device, the performance of the control device was initially optimized by modulating the thickness of the PTQ10 HTL. The thickness was controlled by varying the concentration of the PTQ10 solution (between 1 mg ml−1 (8.0 ± 1.2 nm) and 5 mg ml−1 (84.4 ± 5.5 nm)). The optimal performance of the control device was achieved at a thin PTQ10 layer of ∼8 nm, which corresponds to the PTQ10 film fabricated using the 1 mg ml−1 solution. The increased thickness of the resistive PTQ10 HTLs seemed to decrease the charge collection efficiency to some extent, thereby degrading device performance (for further details of optimization, please consult Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI† section). The optimized control device (henceforth, the control device denotes the optimized version of the control device with the 1 mg ml−1 solution-based PTQ10 film) exhibited the highest PCE = 15.5 ± 0.1% with VOC = 838 ± 7 mV, JSC = 26.7 ± 0.2 mA cm−2, and FF = 69.6 ± 0.1%. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the reference and control devices were measured to confirm their JSC values (Fig. 3c). No significant difference was observed between the EQE spectra of the reference and control devices, which was consistent with the high similarity between their measured JSC values.
Unlike the comparable outdoor performances of the reference device and control device, their indoor performances were significantly different. Under the representative indoor illumination condition 1000 lx HL illumination (IL: 7.0 mW cm−2) the reference device exhibited PCE = 4.6 ± 0.1% with VOC = 743 ± 1 mV, JSC = 667.7 ± 1.1 μA cm−2, and FF = 65.2 ± 0.9%. The aforementioned PCE value is one of the highest recorded under the 1000 lx HL condition as reported in the literature. More interestingly, the control device exhibited better performance with VOC = 785 ± 8 mV, JSC = 685.2 ± 2.5 μA cm−2, and FF = 74.0 ± 0.1%, yielding PCE = 5.7 ± 0.2% that was more than 25% higher than that of the reference device. The PCE value of the control device corresponded to an output power density (Pmax) of ∼413 μW cm−2, which is sufficient for low-power electronic devices (i.e., those requiring 1–100 μW in their standby or idle state). All photovoltaic parameters were improved—in particular, the FF was enhanced by more than 13% (FF of the reference device = 65.2 ± 0.9% → FF of the control device = 74.0 ± 0.1%). This observation clearly demonstrates the positive impact of the additional PTQ10 HTL on interfacial properties, for example, a reduction in the defect density, a decrease in leakage current, and more preferred energy-level alignments, all of which can lead to significant improvements in performance under indoor illumination conditions. Moreover, the adoption of the transfer lamination method was effective in diminishing defect alignment. In the subsequent sections, we analyzed each photovoltaic parameter to identify the beneficial impact of the additional PTQ10 HTL on the indoor performance of OPVs.
The notable improvement in the FF values under the 1000 lx HL condition was first analyzed using the equivalent circuit model (eqn (1)). (1)
Eqn (S3)–(S5)† are semi-empirical expressions derived from the equivalent circuit, describing the parasitic resistance effects on the FF (eqn (1)) (for details regarding RCH, rS, and rP, please refer to the ESI† section). From the J–V characteristics, significantly high RP values (RP of the reference device = 3.3 × 105 Ω cm2 and RP of control device = 5.0 × 105 Ω cm2) were extracted, and it was found that the performance improvement in the FF values was over 51% with the incorporation of the HTL. On the other hand, similar and relatively low RS values were recorded for both devices 3.2 × 103 Ω cm2 and 3.1 × 103 Ω cm2 corresponding to reference and control devices, respectively. In addition, the RCH values, calculated based on VOC and JSC, under 1000 lx HL illumination were also comparable, 2.4 × 104 Ω and 2.5 × 104 Ω for reference and control devices, respectively. Based on the aforementioned values of parasitic resistance and RCH, the comparable and small rS values (reference device = 0.13 and control device = 0.12) and the significant difference between the rP values of both devices, it was concluded that the FF significantly depends on RP.
To further investigate RP-related FF enhancement, charge transport and collection were characterized by evaluating the light-induced current density (Jlight) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) (Jlight denotes the difference between the current densities under illuminated conditions and in the dark, and Veff denotes the difference between the voltage at Jph = 0 and the applied voltage). Fig. 4a depicts the Jlight–Veff dependences of reference and control devices under 1000 lx HL illumination. The control device exhibited a relatively rapid Jlight saturation at Veff = 0.281 V and reference device exhibited Jlight saturation corresponding to a slightly larger Veff = 0.413 V. The big difference in Veff values between the devices reflects the relative lower electric field dependency of the control device. Thus, superb charge transport and collection with lower trapped charge density were exhibited by the control device, validating its higher FF value.

(b) Nyquist plots for OPVs with and without a hole transport layer. (c) Visualization of different transport regions based on the J–V characteristics to verify trap density. (d) dependence of JSC on incident light intensity for reference and control devices under indoor light sources. 
Moreover, the charge dissociation and collection efficiencies are likely to approach unity with the increase in the Veff value. In addition, Jlight saturation primarily depends on the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax). (2)
From eqn (2), Jsat is obtained by multiplying q, L, and Gmax, where q denotes the elementary charge number, L denotes the thickness of the photoactive layer, and the Gmax values calculated based on Jsat are 2.88 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for the reference device and 2.97 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for the control device. Improved FF values for the control device despite comparable Gmax values for the two devices are an indication of superior charge transport properties with decreased charge recombination in the control device.
The charge dynamics were also investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS measurements for both devices were conducted at an applied bias of 0.6 V under the 1000 lx HL condition. Fig. 4b depicts the Nyquist plots of reference and control devices. Recombination resistances (Rrec) based on the diameters of the semicircles of the plots were found to be 92.54 kΩ and 134.06 kΩ for the reference device and control device, respectively.34 The large Rrec value of the control device demonstrates suppressed charge recombination properties, which agrees with its large RP.
Additional quantitative information regarding the hole trap density was obtained using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements. To this end, hole-only devices with ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate)/PTQ10:Y6 or PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10/MoOX/Ag structures were fabricated. Fig. 4c depicts the J–V curves of the hole-only devices in the dark. Corresponding to low voltages (i.e., 0.1 V < V < 1.5 V) ohmic conduction with m = 1 was observed for both devices (ohmic region).35,36 Corresponding to medium voltages (i.e., 1.5 V < V < 3 V), the current increased quickly for both devices, indicating a trap-filling occurrence (trap-filling region). The charge traps distributed in energy can be filled by gradually increasing the electric field. At a trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) of approximately 3 V, the current follows trap-free Mott's V2 law (SCLC region).37–39 The trap density (Nt) can be estimated by using eqn (3). (3)
(VTFL denotes the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, L denotes the thickness of the photoactive layer, εr denotes the relative dielectric constant, and ε0 denotes the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1)). We assumed εr = 4 for both PTQ10:Y6 and PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10 layers. A marginally smaller VTFL was observed for the hole-only device with a PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10 layer, implying a lower hole-trap density of the device with the PTQ10 HTL. The calculated hole-trap density of the control device (4.26 × 1017 cm−3) was lower than that of the reference device (6.69 × 1017 cm−3), revealing that the incorporation of a homojunction HTL decreases the trap density.
Finally, a more in-depth investigation of the AFM images was conducted to determine the impact of morphological changes induced by the incorporation of the HTL on the FF. As mentioned previously, the introduction of the PTQ10 layer further planarized the surface of the PTQ10:Y6 photoactive layer. Smoothening of surfaces facilitates better charge transportation.40,41 In this context, the smoother surface of the PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10 layer (RMS roughness = 0.7 nm) compared to the PTQ10:Y6 layer (RMS roughness = 1.1 nm) enabled more efficient charge transportation, leading to a higher FF value in the former case. Similarly, the grain number exhibited a noticeable change after the addition of the PTQ10 HTL. Fig. S4† depicts the corresponding grain mappings in the PTQ10:Y6 and PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10 layers, and the respective grain numbers obtained using the watershed algorithm. PTQ10:Y6 and PTQ10:Y6/PTQ10 exhibited grain counts of 160 (25 μm2) and 121 (25 μm2), respectively. Typically, larger grain numbers (i.e., smaller grain sizes) indicate the existence of more grain boundaries, reflecting the creation of a large number of trap sites. These sites disrupt charge transport and create charge recombination centers, thereby drastically degrading the FF. Therefore, performance degradation, particularly the reduction in the FF of the reference device can be partially attributed to the increased number of grains.
The increased VOC value of the control device equipped with the PTQ10 HTL can be somewhat attributed to the higher splitting degree of the quasi-Fermi levels owing to the homogeneity of the PTQ10 HTL. When the difference between the WFs of the charge-collecting interlayers on either side of the photoactive layer is sufficiently large, VOC is often limited by the energy gap between the ionization potential of the donor and the electron affinity of the acceptor. In this study, the HTL comprising pure PTQ10 exhibited a donor-dominant region, producing a maximized quasi-Fermi level on the donor side. The potential loss associated with the existence of the counter material in the bulk heterojunction was recovered by incorporating the HTL.42,43
Next, the effect of the suppression of charge recombination on the evolution of VOC is discussed. (4)

Eqn (4) expresses the VOC of an OPV when only bimolecular recombination is considered (i.e., neither trap-assisted nor surface recombination is considered) (please refer to eqn (S2)† for details of each term). (5)

Eqn (5) contains only one parameter, G, which is directly proportional to the illumination. The ratio between VOC and ln(Ilight) provides an insight into the contribution of additional surface recombination (please refer to eqn (S3)† for details of each term). Typically, the slope of the curve of dependence of VOC on ln(Ilight) is unity when bimolecular recombination is the major loss mechanism in OPVs. A slope higher than unity reflects competition between trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination—in this case, VOC evolution is primarily dependent on the intensity of illumination. Fig. 4d depicts the dependence of VOC on ln(Ilight) for reference and control devices under indoor illumination conditions, by showing their slope values. The slope of the control device (1.063) was closer to unity than that of the reference device (1.354). According to eqn (4), the control device with the PTQ10 HTL exhibited low trap-assisted recombination losses, and, therefore, exhibited a marginal potential loss. This observation was consistent with the increase in RP by the PTQ10 HTL, providing direct evidence of the role of the PTQ10 HTL in improving device performance.
The JSC values of the two devices under the 1000 lx HL condition were not critically affected by variations in the parasitic resistance—rather, the light absorption power was more crucial to the determination of JSC. (6)
The first term (1/(1 + RS/RP)) of eqn (6) is partially governed by the ratio of RPA to RSA. Based on eqn (6), it can be concluded that, under the 1000 lx HL condition, both the reference device and control device exhibited comparable RS/RP values (reference device = 0.009 and control device = 0.006) owing to their moderately small RSA values (reference device = 144.9 Ω cm2 and control device = 139.5 Ω cm2) and relatively large RPA values (reference device = 1.5 × 104 Ω cm2 and control device = 2.3 × 104 Ω cm2). Hence, no noticeable dependency of JSC on parasitic resistance was expected. To estimate light absorption, a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation was performed (for the complex refractive indices (n and k) of the photoactive layers, please refer to Fig. S5†). Fig. S6 and Table S2† depict the power absorption ratios of reference and control devices obtained via the FDTD simulation. The 3D-image mapping presents the normalized values of the integrated power-absorption ratios. It was confirmed that the simulated JSC values did not exhibit any noticeable change following the addition of the PTQ10 HTL, which was consistent with the measured JSC values. The discrepancy between the measured and simulated JSC values may be attributed to the FDTD simulations, in which only optical properties, e.g., the complex refractive index, (n and k), are considered, and electrical resistances are excluded.
The reference and control devices exhibited similar performance evolution trends under different 1000 lx LED lamps and 1000 lx FLs. The increase in the FF and VOC coupled with the comparable JSC values led to performance enhancement in the control device compared to the reference device. As a result, the PCE value of the control device increased by up to 26.4 ± 0.1% and 23.9 ± 0.6 under the LED and FL conditions, respectively. Further details regarding the photovoltaic parameters are presented in the ESI (Fig. S7 and Table S3†). A comparison of the ambient stability between the reference and control devices was made (Fig. S8†). A marginally better stability was observed from the control device. None of the devices exhibited any critical performance degradation when exposed to ambient air for more than 300 h. Finally, for universal applicability of the laminated technique another polymer donor, fluorobenzotriazole (FTAZ) was applied as a laminated-transferred-HTL in the OPV devices (Fig. S9 and Table S4†). The OPV devices with the FTAZ-employed HTL exhibited a substantial improvement in the photovoltaic performance, similar to that of the PTQ10 HTL that validated the significance of transfer laminated techniques for indoor OPVs.
Conclusions
In summary, the indoor performance evolution of PTQ10:Y6 OPVs with a transfer-laminated PTQ10-based homojunction HTL was thoroughly investigated. The incorporation of a simple transfer-laminated HTL was found to be quite suitable and necessary to optimize indoor device performance, which simultaneously enables suppression of charge recombination and maximizes quasi-fermi level splitting, thereby enhancing the FF and VOC, and, consequently, the PCE. The optimized indoor OPVs with the proposed HTL exhibited improvements in PCE by up to 26.5%, 24.5%, and 5.9% under 1000 lx LED, FL, and HL conditions, respectively. Under the 1000 lx HL condition, a converted Pmax of 413 μW cm−2 is viable for operating low-power indoor electronic devices. Thus, simple and easy adoption of an additional pure HTL significantly improved indoor performance. The findings in the study are expected to serve as insightful guidelines for realizing efficient indoor OPVs in the future.
Experimental section
Material synthesis
2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (70.9 mg, 1 equiv., 0.273 mmol), 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)quinoxaline (153.8 mg, 1 equiv., 0.273 mmol), Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (5.4 mg, 0.02 equiv., 0.0052 mmol), and P(o-tol)3 (13.1 mg, 0.16 equiv., 0.043 mmol) were added into a 10 mL microwave reactor vial. The mixture was evacuated and refilled with argon for three cycles before the addition of anhydrous toluene (1.5 mL) under argon. The reaction was heated to 200 °C and held in a CEM microwave reactor (300 W) for 30 min. The crude polymer was dissolved in hot chlorobenzene and precipitated into methanol. The collected polymer was washed via Soxhlet extraction with ethyl acetate and hexanes, and then collected in chloroform. The polymer solution was concentrated, then precipitated into methanol and collected. The polymer was dried under vacuum as thin golden/metallic flakes. Yield: 127.9 mg, 96%. GPC: Mn = 27.6 kDa; Mw/Mn = 2.2. The non-fullerene acceptor (Y6) was purchased from Brilliant Matters Inc. Other chemical materials were bought from 4science and Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., respectively.
OPV device fabrication
ITO-coated glass was washed with DI water + detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min. Next, the ZnO nanoparticles were spin-coated onto the glass/ITO, which was then annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour using a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter. The photoactive layer was dissolved in 16 mg ml−1 PTQ:Y6 (1:1.2) in chloroform (1-chloropthalene 0.5% additive) and stirred at 50 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the PDMS precursor and curing reagent were mixed at a ratio of 10:1 (w/w), and bubble removal and spin coating were performed on a clean wafer at 200 rpm for 30 s. The photoactive layer (PTQ10:Y6) was then spin-coated on the ITO/ZnO film at 3000 rpm for 30 s without a filter and annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. Next, PTQ10 (1–5 mg ml−1) was coated on PDMS via spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and immediately transferred onto a photoactive layer to fabricate the PTQ10 layer. Finally, MoOX (10 nm) and Ag (150 nm) electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation under a high-pressure shadow mask of approximately 10−8 Pa. The active area of the device was estimated to be approximately 0.045 cm2.
OPV device characterization
The J–V characteristics were investigated using a source meter (2401, Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, OH, USA) controlled using a K730 program (McScience, Republic of Korea). Four light sources were used to investigate the characteristics of the OPVs under various illumination conditions—AM1.5G solar simulator (McScience, Korea), LED lamp (McScience, Korea McScience, K3000 (LED 100), 5600 K), FL lamp (OSRAM DUL-UXSTAR STIC 11 W), and halogen lamp (OSRAM ECO PRO CLASSIC 64543 A 240 V 46 W E27; OSRAM, Munich, Germany). The intensities of the light sources were calibrated using an Si reference cell (K801S-K058, McScience). The EQE spectra of the laminated HTL-based OPVs were measured using a spectral solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (K3100, McScience). An ultraviolet-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent) was used to measure the thin-film absorbance. The surface morphologies of the photoactive layers were recorded using an XE-100 AFM (Park Systems, Korea); and the grain numbers and root-mean-square of the photoactive layers were obtained using the Park system software. Optical simulations required to calculate the maximum JSC value were performed using a Maxwell's equation-based FDTD simulation (Lumerical Inc). A standard plane-wave source was used, and the wave was propagated to the photovoltaic structure. The simulation used periodic boundary conditions for the X- and Y-axes and perfect matching-layer boundary conditions for the Z-axis. The absorption in the PTQ10:Y6 photoactive layer was measured using a 3D frequency-domain power monitor, and the maximum JSC values under different indoor illumination conditions were calculated using a laboratory-made script. For greater accuracy, the refractive indices and extinction coefficients of all materials used in the simulation were measured using an ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam Co).
