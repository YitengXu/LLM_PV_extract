1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted enormous interest and attention in recent years due to their unique chemical and physical properties.1–6 The successful exfoliation of graphene by Novoselov et al. in 2004 should be the most remarkable event in this field, although the relevant research on 2D materials can be traced back to decades ago.7 Investigations on 2D materials have shown great promising potential for application by virtue of their unique optical, electrical and thermal properties.8–15 2D materials include a range of materials with a sheet-like structure and a large ratio of area to thickness. A typical 2D material usually has a lateral size of more than 100 nm, or even several micrometers, but a thickness of only a single atomic layer or a few atomic layers.16 These materials can be categorized into several different types based on their elemental compositions. Graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), layered metal oxides, and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) represent the most common 2D materials with typical sheet-like structures.16 It is really hard to neglect the enormous number of studies on graphene and its applications in different fields in recent years, such as graphene-based anode materials for lithium ion batteries and graphene supported catalysts.17–22 Inspired by the research on graphene, many researchers have shown great interest in other 2D materials aforementioned.23–30 In return, these research studies have also greatly enriched the family of 2D materials by furnishing new materials, like MXenes, which may be the hottest 2D material after graphene in these years.31–38 Also, it can be found that many materials are brought back to our view these days, which were discovered or synthesized many years ago, like black phosphorus (BP) and metal thiophosphates (MPS3).39–45
MPS3 can represent a family of typical 2D materials, where M is a divalent transition metal ion, e.g. Co(II), Mn(II), Fe(II), Ni(II), Sn(II) or Zn(II).46–50 MPS3 materials were first obtained by Friedel et al. at the end of the 19th century.51 And then, W. Klingen, G. Eulenberger and H. Hahnf also synthesized and studied these materials in 1968.52 In the subsequent two decades, studies on MPS3 were mainly focused on their structures, conductivity, magnetism, optical properties and intercalation behaviors rather than their applications.53–58 Very recently, inspired by the research on 2D materials, MPS3 have attracted researchers’ interest for their potential application in newly developed research areas, such as lithium ion batteries and electrochemical catalysts.46,47,59–63 Obviously, synthesis, structure, properties and application of MPS3 should represent the most critical progress in this field. So, in this review, we summarize the recent progress in synthesis strategies, structural characterizations, chemical and physical properties, and applications of MPS3. The unsolved problems and our perspectives about this material family are discussed.
2 Synthesis strategies
Synthesis methods can greatly influence the chemical, physical, electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials via their size, thickness, crystal phase and defect mainly controlled by synthesis details. According to the research focused on 2D materials, synthesis methods can be classified into two categories, top-down and bottom-up methods. For example, micromechanical cleavage used by Novoselov in graphene synthesis is a typical top-down method, which means obtaining the 2D materials from bulk ones. There are also some other top-down methods like mechanical force-assisted liquid exfoliation,64,65 ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation,66,67 ion exchange-assisted liquid exfoliation,68 oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation69 and selective etching-assisted liquid exfoliation.70,71 The other one, the bottom-up method, is to get the materials by constructing them from atoms or ions. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can well represent a bottom-up process. A graphene nanosheet grows up one atom by one atom on the substance.72,73 Similar to the CVD process, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also applied in the synthesis of 2D materials.74,75 However, the methods to synthesize MPS3 are really limited according to the accessible reports, especially the synthesis methods of bulk or crystal MPS3.
2.1 Solid state reactions
A solid state reaction is a common and general method to synthesize MPS3. For example, a typical procedure to synthesize NiPS3 usually contains the following steps: firstly, stoichiometric amounts of the elemental powders, nickel metal, phosphorus and sulfur are mixed well. Then, the mixed powder is annealed for a determined time in ampoules. Finally, NiPS3 can be obtained. Reaction temperature and time vary according to the reports.76–81 The reaction temperature for MPS3 typically ranges from 540 to 725 °C, while the reaction time differs from hours to months (Table 1). The synthetic strategy of solid state reactions has its own advantages: the products are usually well crystallized, and of large-scale yield. Unfortunately, this method usually requires a large amount of energy and a long reaction time, and has a low product rate. In addition, the samples from solid state reactions are usually impure, requiring further purifications. The solid-state reaction method for NiPS3 is optimized by N. N. Redin et al. by greatly reducing the reaction time.82 According to their experiments, in the one-zone heating method, excess of sulfur and phosphorus by 15% of stoichiometric amount can decrease the content of impurities to less than 1% with a relatively short reaction time of 25 to 30 h at a temperature in the range of 1073–1123 K. In the two-zone heating method, the optimized conditions are 3–7% excess of sulfur and phosphorus and reaction time of 15 h at temperatures of 1173–1223 K for reaction and 813–853 K for growth.

2.2 Vapor-phase growth method
The vapor-phase growth technique includes vapor sublimation, chemical transport and CVD, which are very common in 2D material synthesis and also applied in the synthesis of MPS3 compounds.83–85 Similar to solid-state reactions, these methods also require stoichiometric amounts of constituting elements. The obtained samples are also bulk ones (Fig. 1a–d).86,87 In addition, as summarized in Table 1, the chemical transport and CVD usually require a transport agent, such as iodine or chlorine, for chemical transport and hydrogen/argon mixed gas for CVD.88–90 So it is important to control the amount of transport agent and the speed of transport gas, which would carry the reagent to the crystal growing area. In addition, these methods also require a long reaction time for days, with the exception of the CVD method, in which the reaction lasts only a few hours but with small size and a few layer samples. The reaction temperature is also similar to that of the solid-state reaction, higher than 500 °C. Differently, the obtained samples via the vapor growth method can show high purity and good crystallization, while the growth rate is relatively low. For example, a typical two-zone reaction method was reported by Du et al.,89 in which a stoichiometric amount of metal, phosphorus, sulfur or selenium and iodine mixture are sealed in an ampule and kept in a two-zone furnace of 650 °C and 600 °C for one week. MPS3 crystals are obtained after cooling to room temperature. The obtained crystals of NiPS3, FePS3, MnPS3 and MnPSe3 are indicated in Fig. 1(a).

2.3 Other methods
The sol–gel method is another choice to get MPS3 with Li2PS3 as a reaction reagent, which is usually obtained via a solid-state reaction. Li2PS3 can be acquired by heating the mixture of Li2S, P and S at 450 °C for 24 h as reported by R. Brec et al. And the whole process was well studied by the same group.91,92 It is noticeable that Li2PS3 is usually impure with some oxides of lithium and phosphorus, which are inevitable in the high temperature solid state reaction. There are four main steps to synthesize NiPS3 at room temperature. The first step is the sol–gel step. A highly concentrated (usually more than 0.4 mol L−1) solution of Li2PS3 is prepared, into which the nickel salt solution is added under stirring. The mixed solution would rapidly form a gel. In this step, the concentrations of precursor solutions and stirring speed should be carefully controlled. The second step is the primary drying. Centrifugation and vacuum drying are necessary to remove water and excessive salts. In the successive washing step (the third step), acetone is used, which is a good solvent to lots of different salts but NiPS3. The final step (the fourth step) is the high temperature drying process (about 100 °C) to remove residual solvents before getting pure NiPS3. There are several critical points in the sol–gel process: (1) the choice of solvent may influence the stability of the P2S62− group. It was found in R. Brec's report that ethanol and methanol would break the P–P bonding according to 31P NMR analysis. (2) It is better to add the nickel salt into Li2PS3 solution and not the other way around. This is also based on the consideration of the stability of (P2S6)4−. But a further analysis may be needed to confirm this point. (3) A secondary drying is necessary in some situations. DSC analysis indicates that water or solvent would be removed at the temperature ca. 90 °C. (4) Different from the NiPS3 obtained by the solid-state reaction, the amorphous product could be obtained by this room temperature reaction.
The methods discussed above are mainly used to get bulk MPS3. There are also some research studies about the synthesis of MPS3 nanosheet materials. Lerner et al. fabricated NiPS3 polymer nanocomposites by associating this room temperature synthesis method with the template preparation method.93 Another template method is reported by Yan et al., which could directly synthesize NiPS3 nanosheets with several layers.94,95 The key step is to get the nanosheet Ni(OH)2 precursor by solvent thermal methods. Then, this method is similar to the solid-state method: a stoichiometric amount of red phosphorus and excess sulfur are transferred into a quartz ampoule sealed under vacuum. Finally, this ampoule is heated at 520 °C for several hours. Like the method of Yan et al., a template method is proposed by Xiang et al.90 Ni2(CO3)(OH)2 nanosheets are used as the template for NiPS3 synthesis, which is also obtained by a hydrothermal process (Fig. 1f). It is easy to get NiPS3 nanosheet materials by these template methods avoiding exfoliation processes. The TEM and HRTEM images are shown in Fig. 1e and g.
As discussed above, the synthesis methods for the MPS3 family are really limited. A summary is provided in Table 1. Based on the synthesis characteristics, these methods are classified into several categories. The solid-state method is mostly used for the preparation of bulk MPS3 materials, whereas the vapor-phase growth technique can only provide a few samples for study. It can also be found that NiPS3 is the most common material in these research studies, which may be due to its unique properties discussed in Section 3. In our opinion, the main reason for the limited synthesis methods is that the early-stage research studies about MPS3 just focused on the physical and chemical properties instead of practical applications. And only a small number of samples could satisfy the requirements. Another important reason is that the concept of 2D materials was not so popular, leading to less attention paid to MPS3 investigations. With the development of chemistry and physics, lots of upgraded conventional methods can be applied for synthesis of these materials, especially many technologies are much better than those decades before. For instance, the ball milling method and solvothermal method are worth exploring for bulk MPS3 synthesis, while micromechanical exfoliation and chemical exfoliation methods are feasible for the synthesis of MPS3 nanosheet materials.
3 Structure and properties
3.1 Crystal structure
Crystal structure is one of the main concerns for researchers, when a new material is obtained. To get accurate cell parameters, Taylor et al. grew large MPS3 (M = Mn, Fe, Ni) single crystals with good homogeneity via vapor sublimation and chemical transport techniques.76 X-ray spectroscopy was conducted under both fast and slow scanning with a scanning rate of 60° hour−1 and 15° hour−1 in 2θ, which made their results much more accurate than former studies. These results indicate that the MPS3 structure belongs to the monoclinic unit cell space group C2/m. The lattice parameters were also detected by Taylor et al. and are summarized in Table 2. The peaks of typical MPS3 are also depicted in Fig. 2. It can be found that MPS3 show similar structures except SnPS3. The typical structure of MPS3 is related to the CdCl2 or TiS2 structure in which the M2+ and P–P pair occupy the Cd position, and S atoms replace the Cl. In other words, the M2+ and P–P pairs are in the S formed octahedral voids, which are slightly distorted due to the inequivalence of M and P. In addition, the P–P bond direction is collinear with the octahedral threefold axis and parallel to the hexagonal axis of the MPS3 layers. It can be concluded that between two van der Waals gaps, the slab contains a [SM2/3(P2)1/3S] layer leading to unoccupied voids for intercalation of different atoms and molecules.

 Fig. 2  Typical MPS3 XRD patterns. 
Not only is the MPS3 crystal studied, amorphous state MPS3 is also investigated by researchers. As discussed above, NiPS3 can be synthesized at room temperature. It can be assumed that NiPS3 may be an amorphous or quasi-amorphous material. The structure of amorphous NiPS3 (a-NiPS3) is studied by P. Fragnaud et al. via XRD and calculations.91,100,101 Firstly, NiPS3 was studied in the gel state, which could be considered as amorphous due to the lack of the (001) peak. Although being considered as an amorphous material, NiPS3 still exhibits three broad peaks around 27.4°, 42°, 54° in 2θ. Only (P2S6)4− groups are taken for calculation first. However, no peak appears around 42° as indicated in their research. Even after Ni2+ is added into the simulation, there are still no new peaks at 42° but enhancement of the peaks at 30° and 50°. Finally, the peak at 42° is successfully simulated by adding the gathered (P2S6)4− groups into calculations. So, this peak is mostly caused by the interaction between sulfur atoms. The powders from the mentioned gel are also tested by XRD. It is worth noting that these measurements are conducted in a capillary and with a long exposure time detector leading to the appearance of more peaks than a normal XRD spectrum. However, it is found that the faultless crystallite model cannot explain the diagram from experiments. Different fault types are taken into consideration including T faults and R faults. In their research, the a-NiPS3 XRD pattern is compared with different simulation models including the T5 3-3-1, RNi4 3-3-1, and RP4 3-3-1 models. With these considerations, the spectra are well simulated indicating a noticeable amplitude decrease of Ni–S interference and a high anionic fault percentage in the amorphous NiPS3.
The XRD studies by Taylor and Fragnaud were conducted at room temperature. However, temperature also plays an important role in the study of MPS3 crystal structures. It is found that the phase transition occurs with the temperature changing. E. Lifshitz et al. studied the phase transition in CdPS3 by ESR and XRD.105 The phase of CdPS3 changed from the monoclinic to the orthorhombic lattice with the temperature decreasing from room temperature to lower temperatures. The transition temperature was centered at 260 K, with a co-existence of phases in a temperature range from 220 to 290 K. Whereas in MgPS3 and ZnPS3, the transition from the monoclinic to the orthorhombic lattice was not observed. Meanwhile, at almost the same time, Tomoyuki Sekine et al. studied this phase transition and reported a transition temperature of 295 K based on the appearance of new Raman peaks.106 The Raman spectra between 15 and 600 cm−1 investigated at different temperatures were collected. The peaks located in the low-frequency range (0–100 cm−1) have a remarkable change with varying temperatures. With the temperature increase, the peak at about 30 cm−1 shifted to a lower frequency and disappeared when the temperature was above 295 K, which was considered as a signal strongly related to the structure phase transition. Combined with the appearance of a peak at 191 cm−1, it is believed that the crystal symmetry lowers with the decrease in temperature. Although the phase transition temperature is controversial, their research confirmed the occurrence of the CdPS3 phase transition in a temperature range from room temperature to a low temperature.
F. Boucher et al. also reported this transition years later.107 However, different from that observed in E. Lifshitz's experiments, they believed that the symmetry shifted from the monoclinic parameter to the hexagonal form at 228 K. The phase transition is clearly verified by recording the changes of monoclinic 32 reflection intensity and rhombohedral 32 reflection intensity versus temperature. R hypothesis and R3 hypothesis are also proposed. R3 hypothesis shows the formation of a disordered low-temperature CdPS3 layer built by three ordered domain sets. In R hypothesis, it is also found that the α parameter hardly changed, while the stacking mode changes into AB/AB from ABC/ABC in this transition process. Furthermore, the van der Waals gap shrinks from 3.18 to 3.12 Å, which may be attributed to the second order Jahn–Teller stabilization from a mixing of the Cd p and P2S64− 1eg orbitals.
Not only is the CdPS3 phase transition studied, the temperature dependence of FePS3 lattice behavior is also investigated.108 When the temperature is above 115 K, the linear expansion coefficient of the c*-axis is approximately 50% larger than those in the ab-plane. When the sample is tested at 115 K, the two phases are presented simultaneously and show up as double spots on the films. And the ab-plane changes dramatically at a temperature lower than 115 K.
Phase transition is an important characteristic for crystal materials. Both CdPS3 and FePS3 exhibit phase transitions at certain temperatures. However, different transition temperatures are reported for CdPS3. The signal for phase transition needs to be defined and unified. The phase transition behaviors of other MPS3 materials are also worth exploring. We believe that the new techniques, like in situ XRD and in situ Raman, would be powerful tools for research in this field.
3.2 Electronic structure
X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS) has been introduced into MPS3 electronic structure research. MPS3 is usually considered to be formed by two atom groups, namely, MS6 and P2S6; especially, the M–S bond is a covalent bond. However, the XPS results indicate a mostly ionic bond with strong satellite peaks of Ni in the research from Piacentini M. et al.109 The differences of covalent and ionic bonds have been discussed by Robert and Asada in both experiments and theory, respectively.110,111 And this conclusion is also in agreement with the crystal study by Klingen et al.112 Piacentini M. et al. also constructed the energy level scheme of the P–S valence band (Fig. 3a).109 The crystal lattice translation indicates the equivalence of S surrounding the P–P pair. So, the energy level of P2S6 may be similar to that of Ga2S6 confirmed in layered GaS. However, there are still many differences for the strong interaction between P–P pairs. Although the energy level scheme is established, there are still several points not taken into consideration, like the hybridizations between S 3s and P 3s, and P 3s and 3p. Furthermore, this scheme could only represent the band structure at the center of the Brillouin zone, but not at the boundaries. The valence bands and core level studies of NiPS3, FePS3 and ZnPS3 also confirm the ionic model M22+(P2S6)4− proposed by M. Piacentini et al. Meanwhile, this research suggests a certain amount of covalent bonding between M2+ and (P2S6)4− according to the strong satellite peak of Ni 2p. XPS measurements were conducted on CdPS3 by Curro G.M. et al.113 Their research demonstrated the presence of Cd2+, indicating a more ionic character of the Cd–S bond which was strongly supported by X-ray induced Auger spectroscopy. Furthermore, the XPS data of some typical MPS3 materials are summarized in Table 3. It can be found that peak values of M are greater than the corresponding values in metal M, and close to those observed in other M(II) compounds. This fact suggests that M is in a 2+ oxidation state in MPS3. It may be reasonable to conclude that MS6 is characterized by more ionic bonds and the P2S6 by covalent ones in MPS3.

Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) is also employed in the study of NiPS3 valence band structures.114 Firstly, as shown in Fig. 3(b), it is noticeable that the spectra of NiPS3 cleaved in a vacuum and atmosphere are obviously different, which may indicate an unstable state of NiPS3 in air. In addition, there are also some differences in the spectra of the cleaved surface and scraped one both in a vacuum. This may be attributed to the energy dispersion of the conduction band. The size of band gap for NiPS3, 1.6 eV, also agrees well with the low conductivity discussed above. Another discovery is that the top of the valence bands of NiPS3 is assigned to the P2S6 cluster state. T. Miyazaki et al. studied the valence band structures of FePS3 by synchrotron radiation.114 The UPS and CIS results indicate that almost of all valence band structures have some contributions from both Fe atoms and P2S6 clusters, which means the existence of orbital mixing between Fe and P2S6 clusters in FePS3. It can also be obtained from this research that the value of the band gap in FePS3 is 1.0 eV. R. Brec et al. conducted optical measurements for the energy gap testing in 1979,115 in which the energy gap values are only determined from absorption spectra. So photoconductivity and temperature dependence of resistivity were tested by J. Suradi et al. in 1980.116 The results from J. Suradi well confirmed the energy gap (1.6 eV) obtained by R. Brec. And this energy gap is lower than those of ZnPS3, CdPS3 and many other MPS3, indicating a better cathode performance.
3.3 Conductivity
As an important property for semiconductor materials, electronic transport behaviors of MPS3 were studied by M. Piacentini and K. Ichimura et al.117,119 MPS3 materials can be divided into two classes based on the constant-voltage two-terminal method. FePS3, VPS3 and V0.78PS3 show a higher electrical conductivity of about 10−5, 10−2 and 10−1 S cm−1, respectively, while the electrical conductivities of MnPS3, NiPS3 and ZnPS3 are lower than 10−9 S cm−1. Indicated by their XPS results, the conductivity properties of these two classes are attributed to the mixed valency on metal and/or the S and P sites. As shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), the S 2p and P 2p spectra for FePS3, VPS3 and V0.78PS3 consist of two components or peaks, while the other group MPS3 with lower conductivity display only a single peak. The doublet spectral structures for FePS3, VPS3 and V0.78PS3 correspond to the mixed valency in their P2S6 groups. The good conductivities of FePS3 and VPS3 could be explained by the mixed valency in their P2S6 clusters.
The conductivity of MPS3 materials can also be influenced by temperature, pressure, and illumination conditions. The temperature dependence of intralayer conductivity and photoconductivity indicates the p-type behavior of NiPS3, which is also confirmed by photoelectrochemical research studies. If the conduction process is assumed to take place in the P 3pz orbital valence band, it would be well in agreement with the energy level raised as reported by J. Rouxel et al.120 In return, the Seebeck coefficient with a value of −0.8 mV K−1 obtained based on these considerations is close to values of many other p-type semiconductor materials. Their research results verified the weak interaction between the Ni and S model. It also supports the conclusion discussed above that it is an almost ionic band between Ni and the P2S6 atom group.
FePS3 exhibits a conductivity property transition from a Mott-insulator to a metal-insulator at pressures from 10 to 11 GPa.121,122 And the occurrence of phase transitions can be found at approximately 4 GPa and 14 GPa from the XRD pattern collection in Fig. 3(e). It is obvious that new peaks appear and are enhanced while other peaks decrease in both phase transitions. Schematics of the FePS3 structure at different pressures are also provided in Fig. 3(g). The pattern at 0 GPa (HP 0) corresponds to the low-pressure monoclinic C2/m phase. The one at 10.1 GPa to a high-pressure phase is designated as HP I. Finally, the second high-pressure phase is denoted as HP II. The interplanar distance change and atom transfer are clearly shown in these schematics. Resistivity of FePS3 drastically decreases with applied pressure as indicated in Fig. 3(f). Meanwhile, at a pressure above an estimated 5.0 GPa and a temperature above 100 K, the resistivity grows with increasing temperature, indicating a metallic behavior. In comparison, the resistivity decreases with the temperature increase at a pressure lower than 5.0 GPa, which is a typical Mott insulator behavior.
A. Carnabuci et al. studied the in-layer dc conductivity and photoconductivity of CdPS3.123 The dc conductivity shows an Arrhenius temperature dependence at a temperature ranging from 310 to 450 K, presenting an intrinsic conduction. The photoconductivity is almost independent of temperature, while the dark conductivity increases with increasing temperature (Fig. 3h). The conductivity and photoconductivity of MnPS3 are also studied by V. Grasso et al.124 The dark conductivity is about 8.6 × 10−13 Ω−1 cm−1 at 130 °C, while the photoconductivity ranges from 8.8 × 10−13 Ω−1 cm−1 to 6.1 × 10−18 Ω−1 cm−1 with the changes of illumination conditions. The conductivity mechanism is also detected in their research. The holes in the phosphorus valence band may be the main reason for the dark conductivity, while the UV photoconductivity is attributed to the electron transfer of the F band.
3.4 Magnetism
MPS3 usually shows paramagnetism at high temperatures, while becomes antiferromagnet below the Néel temperature (TN).125 R. Wildes et al. reported the antiferromagnetic properties of CoPS3 and its Néel temperature of 122 K.96 The susceptibility of the MPS3 materials is not only affected by the temperature, but also by the direction of the applied field. In the temperature range below TN, the susceptibility varies little with temperature for the field applied along b and c*, while it is anisotropic above TN. And the susceptibility decreases much faster with the temperature decrease for fields applied along a, when the temperature is above TN. And the susceptibility for fields in the ab plane is larger than that with the field applied along c*. FePS3 becomes antiferromagnetic below 120 K with a first order transition as being reported in the research by P. Jernberg et al.108 Jae-Ung Lee et al. reported the independent responses of FePS3 to material thickness from the bulk to monolayer.126 In addition, the transition temperature is almost constant in these materials with different thicknesses, indicating little influence of interlayer interaction on phase transitions.
R. Zeng et al. reported the abnormal magnetic behaviors and magnetocaloric effect in MnPS3 nanoparticles.127 It is found that the nanoparticles of MnPS3 is formed by the restacking of molecular layers with H2O insertion in van der Waals gaps. Interestingly, the long-range spin ordering disappears in these nanoparticles from 2 to 300 K. And a higher Curie temperature can also be achieved by intercalation of FePS3.128 Fe0.88PS3(pyH+py)0.36(H2O)≈0.5 is obtained after a reaction between FePS3 and pyridinium chloride and pyridine. The intercalate exhibits spontaneous magnetization below 92 K, while the pure FePS3 shows antiferromagnetism below 120 K.
3.5 Optical properties
CdPS3 shows diamagnetic and transparent features in the visible and near-ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.129,130 The maximum luminescence is normally observed at 500 nm, whereas the intercalate materials show red shifts of the maximum luminescence wavelength, with 74 nm and 98 nm for the ruthenium tris(bipyridyl) cation (RUBIPY2+) intercalate and the RUBIPY2+ and dimethylviologen cation (MV2+) co-intercalate, respectively. These changes may be due to the co-intercalated species and the additional cation vacancies. The co-intercalated CdPS3 also exhibits photochemistry activities. Its color changes from red orange to a uniform deep blue under light irradiation between 350 and 400 nm at a temperature >125 K, while the RUBIPY2+ intercalate and MV2+ intercalate do not show color changes under irradiation. Furthermore, this luminescence is totally quenched at 77 K, indicating a thermally activated step. It can also be inferred that the transfer is not direct from the donor to accepter but involves the host states. V. Grasso et al. studied absorption spectra of MnPS3, CoPS3, FePS3 and NiPS3 in both near-infrared and visible ranges at room temperature.131 The structure is difficult to observe because the electron transition occurs between the 3d orbitals of the metal center. However, by comparing with other transition metal composites, the appearance of well-developed crystal field spectra supports the idea that these materials are considerably ionic.
3.6 Intercalation properties
Researchers have great interest in the metal ion intercalation properties of MPS3 induced by its lamellar structure, which makes it a promising electrode material for ion rechargeable batteries. Before discussion of this topic, we will introduce the studies of organic molecule intercalation in MPS3, which may help us to understand the intercalation process. Certainly, the crystal parameters would be influenced by the intercalation process. So, we summarized the parameters reported in relevant research studies in Table 4.

3.6.1 Organic molecule intercalation. 
Amine intercalation was investigated by P. J. S. Foot et al. in 1983.57 Molecules reported in this study included alkylamines, linear diaminoalkanes, pyridine, aniline and triphenylamine. However, only alkylamines with short chains could stably intercalate into NiPS3. After amine intercalation, only a significant increase of c parameter was observed, without virtual changes of a and b parameters. Sulfur was found in the solution after some reactions between amine and NiPS3, indicating slight crystal damage. The ionized amine with a solvation shell is was also detected in several intercalated compounds corresponding to an intercalation of alkylammonium ions. As for the resistivity changes, direct current resistance of NiPS3 dramatically decreased from 4 × 1010 to 1 × 105 Ω cm after CH3NH2 insertion. The retention of semiconductor properties also means a localization of electrons donated by amine rather than the formation of a conduction band.
N. V. Venkataraman and S. Vasudevan et al. studied the cetyl trimethyl ammonium ion behaviors in CdPS3.132 This intercalation reaction not only introduced guest ions into the CdPS3 lattice, but also exchanged Cd2+ from the lattice. It was found that the methylene chain adopts an essentially all-trans conformation parallel to the layers. Sébastien Floquet et al. reported the intercalation influence on electronic properties of a cationic ferric complex in a lamellar CdPS3 host matrix.133 Two cations, [FeIII(R-Sal2Trien)]+ [where H2-R-Sal2Trien is the hexadentate ligand derived from triethylenetetramine and R-substituted salicylaldehydes (R = 3,5-Cl2 or 5-OMe)], were investigated in their research. [Fe(3,5-Cl2-Sal2Trien)]PF6 undergoes a gradual spin-crosser process. After the intercalation into CdPS3, the ferric ions were trapped in the low spin state in a large range of temperatures as indicated in EPR measurements. [Fe(5-OMe-Sal2Trien)]PF6·0.5H2O remained the high spin state [χMT = 4.31], while the intercalated complex showed the spin crossover and the presence of residual high spin species between 4 and 291 K. In addition, these structural and magnetic characteristics of a cationic complex were similar in both CdPS3 and MnPS3, indicating that the molecular arrangement influenced by guest–guest and guest–host interactions.
P. L. McDaniel et al. also reported a research about pyridine intercalated CdPS3via NMR.134 NMR investigation makes it possible to record the reorientation motion of pyridine in CdPS3. The motion of pyridine was recorded at different temperatures from 260 to 330 K. With increasing temperature (Fig. 4a), the changes of peaks at ±40 kHz and ±60 kHz indicated the gradual disappearance of the rigid lattice of pyridine. This result also indicates a preferred orientation of pyridine, which is a nitrogen lying equidistant between CdPS3 layers. Stanislaw L. Randzio et al. carried out nonisothermal calorimetric studies of pyridine intercalation in CdPS3.135 The absolute value of the enthalpy change was ΔH = 76.5 ± 0.7 kJ mol−1 for pyridine intercalation, which may be too high to achieve van der Waals intercalation, supporting the cation exchange discussed above.
 Fig. 4  (a) Temperature effect on the deuterium NMR line shape of (C25H5N)0.41CdPS3;134 (b) schematics for the observed orientations of the cobaltocenium ions and an illustration of the three domains of differently oriented cobaltocene molecules;136 (c) proposed schematic intercalation mechanism of pyH+ with layered FePS3;139 (d) XRD patterns of FePS3 phase transformation with pyH+ intercalation;139 (e) proposed schematic intercalation mechanism of pyridine into MnPS3 layers.140 
A similar research was done by D. O’Hare et al.136 They studied the orientation of the cobaltocene intercalated in CdPS3 by solid state 2H NMR spectroscopy. It was found that there was an angular relation between the molecular domains. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the domains could be divided into three kinds of orientations with relative angles of about 60°. In each domain, the molecular oriented at 90° to each other. Besides cobaltocene, ferrocene was also studied as an intercalate molecule in CdPS3.137 The 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum was used in the research of ferrocene intercalated CdPS3 conducted by M. Bhattacharya et al. Different from cobaltocene, the ferrocene molecule exhibits partial ionization after being intercalated in CdPS3. Moreover, ferrocene was totally ionized, after the intercalated material was exposed to moisture for 48 h. This indicates a transfer of electrons from ferrocene to the P–P pair, which is also confirmed by a 31P NMR shift in the hydrated material.
A. Bhowmick et al. studied the intercalated FePS3 with methylamine and ethylamine via the Mössbauer spectrum.138 It was found that there were two types of Fe2+ sites after intercalation. Fe2P2S6 was converted to Fe2P2S5O or Fe2P2S4O2 by substitution of sulfur with oxygen in the intercalation process. It was expected that 50% of Fe2+ was in the P2S5O or P2S4O2 octahedra, while the other part of Fe2+ was in the P2S6 octahedra. In addition, the transferred electrons in amine intercalates would be delocalized, when the concentration was beyond a certain value. Anne Léaustic et al. studied the magnetic properties of a series of FePS3 intercalates.128 The guest species include pyridinium, methylviologen, 4-picolinium, methylpyridinium and 3,5-lutidinium. The pyridinium intercalate showed a sharp increase of magnetic susceptibility with the temperature increase from 92 to 100 K. The magnetic susceptibility stayed constant at temperatures below 92 K, while it increased with the temperature rising above 100 K. The critical temperature of the methylviologen intercalate was only 77 K, while that of the N-methylpyridinium intercalate was 82 K. Different from the intercalates discussed above, 4-picolinium, 3,5-lutidinium, and tetraethylammonium intercalates exhibited antiferromagnetism with no spontaneous magnetization detected. Their Mössbauer spectral results agreed with those by A. Bhowmick et al., indicating two different chemical surroundings for the Fe ions. The different magnetic properties of these intercalates lead to a conclusion that the magnetism of FePS3 derivatives is strongly influenced by their guest species.
A. A. El-Meligi studied the pyridinium intercalation process of FePS3.139 Both the loss of Fe ions and the IR spectra indicated that the intercalated species were pyH+. It can be inferred that there are two phases produced in the intercalation process via the XRD measurements. The orientation of inserted pyH+ transfers from perpendicular to parallel to FePS3 layers (Fig. 4c). As shown in Fig. 4(d), a complete phase transition occurs after the samples are left in open air for five days. The decrease of the van der Waals space from 12.1 to 9.7 Å also corresponds to the orientation changes of pyH+. A further research was conducted by A. A. El-Meligi et al.140 Three different orientations of pyridine were detected with various lattice spaces of 9.6, 10.7 and 7.3 Å of the 001 phase (Fig. 4e). The transition of pyridine orientation not only occurs within the intercalation process, but is also found with the increase of pressure.141 The pressure increase leads to a change of intercalate to the parallel orientation until the pressure value of up to 2 GPa. The infrared spectra indicate the strain releases between the intercalates caused by the pressure increase around 2 GPa.
The organic molecule intercalation can also lead to changes in MPS3 properties. X. Chen et al. studied the BEDT-TTF intercalated FePS3, where the BEDT-TTF was bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalence.142 It was found that an antiferromagnetic transition of this intercalate occurred at 100 K, which was lower than that of 120 K for pristine FePS3, while the conductivity was not much improved by intercalation. As a comparison, Fe0.82PS3(TTF)0.38 showed metallic character.143 They also studied the BEDT-TTF insertion in MnPS3.144 Two magnetic phase transitions were found. One transition was a paramagnetism to spin-glass transition at around 40 K, and the other was the transition of spin-glass further to a ferrimagnetic phase when the temperature decreased to 5 K.
X. Chen et al. studied many similar inorganic–organic composites.145 In their experiments, N-methylstilbazolium derivatives were introduced as intercalate guests. From the increase in the value of van der Waals space, it could be inferred that all the intercalated molecules were perpendicular to the FePS3 layer, which is similar to the behaviors of pyridine in MnPS3. As for the magnetic properties, all these intercalates show similar antiferromagnetic properties with a Néel temperature of about 80 K. The intercalation would also reduce the antiferromagnetism of MnPS3,146 which was interpreted by the occurrence of a ‘weak ferromagnetism’. They also reported the magnetic properties of MnxCd1−xPS3(0 < x ≤ 1) and their intercalates based on tetraethylammonium (Et4N+) and 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy).147 It was found that Et4N+ intercalation would lead to a loss of Mn2+, while the bipy intercalation caused the removal of Cd2+ ions to maintain the charge balance. The ratio of Mn2+ plays an important role in the changes of magnetic properties. For instance, when the Mn2+ ratio is above 0.7, the ferromagnetic phase transition at low temperatures would be induced and the spontaneous magnetization would rise below Tc.
The influences of organic molecular intercalation on MPS3 properties were also reported by many other research studies. For instance, Qin et al. studied the intercalates of MnPS3 with nickel(II) cyclopolyamine,148 1,10-phenanthroline,149 transition metal salen complexes,60 and 2,2-bipyridine.150 It was found that intercalates would influence the ferromagnetism Tc values, which varied between 33 K and 40 K.


3.6.2 Cation intercalation compounds. 
N. Arun et al. reported the hydrated sodium ion motion in interlamellar CdPS3. XRD spectra indicated that the lattice expansion was about twice of the H2O van der Waals diameter and the sodium ion was at the center of the CdPS3 van der Waals gap.151,152 Associated with the calculation, it was reasonable to promote a model in which the sodium ion located in the octahedral vacancy of H2O (Fig. 5a). As shown in the proton spectra (Fig. 5b), only a Pake doublet was exhibited with no other features indicating a similar orientation and identical motions. Meanwhile, the temperature dependence implied that the hydration shell was maintained at all temperatures, which means that the H2O shell moved with sodium ion motion. In other words, the relaxation of the H2O shell was much faster than the motion of sodium ions. These results suggest that the conductivity may result from the combination of the sodium ion bilayer and the anisotropic sliding motion of sodium ions with their H2O shells. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5(c), the frequency shows a sublinear dispersion and follows a simple power law. This is characteristic of hopping conductivity and has been observed in a lot of ionic conductors.

P. Jeevanandam and S. Vasudevan also studied the dielectric response of K and Cs intercalated CdPS3.153 In their experiments, the alkali cation was combined with H2O molecules, and H2O played an important role in the lattice expansion. For the smaller alkali ions (Li and Na) combined with two H2O molecules, the change of lattice was 5.5 Å, while the value was just 2.9 Å for K and Cs ions with one H2O molecule. The lack of H2O coordination also leads to the immobility of K and Cs ions, which means the dielectric permittivity is mainly from the water monolayer in intercalated compounds. There are two noticeable phenomena for Cd0.75PS3A0.5(H2O) [A = K, Cs] material: an anomalous dispersion of the complex dielectric susceptibility at low frequencies and a dielectric relaxation at higher frequencies. The anomalous low frequency dispersion may come from the 2D network formed by water molecules and the internal H bonds due to the water directional arrangement in the lattice space. The dielectric relaxation at high frequency could also be attributed to the permanent dipole of H2O molecules.
R. Clement et al. reported the luminescence properties of Nd3+, Sm3+ and Eu3+ intercalated CdPS3.154 The cation intercalation process is usually a spontaneous reaction at room temperature including a cation exchange process. However, this reaction may fail when the cation size is too large. In this situation, there are usually two steps to realize large ion intercalation (Fig. 5d): firstly, the small cations would be preinserted in the lamellar materials. Secondly, the inserted cation would be exchanged by the target guest species.155 The well annealed CdPS3 showed weak luminescence, while an intense and broad luminescence was shown between 16500 and 21400 cm−1 after CdPS3 was treated with solutions containing solute cations. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the intercalation of Nd3+, Sm3+ and Eu3+ leads to enhancement of luminescence bands due to the appearance of cation vacancies and the 4f-electron transition.
The intercalation of cations will also lead to changes of MPS3 physical properties. Lithium intercalation caused a decrease of FePS3 Néel temperature from 118 to 56 K,156 and the composite conductivity increased from 3.8 × 10−6 to 8.1 × 10−3 Ω−1cm−1 with the increased intercalation time. In addition, the relationship between the conductivity of equilibrated LixFePS3 and temperature followed an Arrhenius relationship.157 A magnetic transition may also be introduced by rendering neighboring manganese sites, which are structurally different from each other. For example, the intercalations of Zn ions, cobaltocene and cobaltocenium iodide lead to a reduction of magnetic susceptibilities.158,159 MnPS3 and Mn0.85PS3(Me4N)0.3 exhibit different magnetic susceptibility behaviors in a temperature range from 5 to 300 K. A spontaneous magnetization appears in intercalate materials below the ordering temperature Tc in the range of 30 to 45 K, while the pristine MnPS3 orders antiferromagnetically.155 Both strong nonlinear optical properties and a spontaneous magnetization (below 40 K) is observed in Mn0.86PS3(DAMS)0.28.160
Not only the liquid solution has been studied, solid polymer electrolytes have also received lots of attention in the MPS3 intercalation studies. P. Jeevanandam and S. Vasudevan carried out studies on the conductivity and relaxation process of CdPS3 with polypropylene solvated lithium cation intercalation.161 In this series of materials, cation motion is closely associated with the local segmental motion. When the temperature is above the glass transition temperature, there is a strong coupling of the motion of the ion and polymer segment. In contrast, the crystallization would lead to a poor ion conductivity at a temperature below the glass transition temperature. More details were obtained by investigating the dc conductivity of Cd0.75PS3–Li0.5(PPG). It was found that conductivity showed different behaviors above and below 245 K. As shown in Fig. 5(f), when the temperature is below 245 K, the conductivity is quite low, and the temperature dependence is characterized by the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy Ea = 0.179 eV. But above 245 K, the conductivity increases rapidly and achieves a value of 1.58 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 300 K. This dependence is no-Arrhenius but follows Vogel–Tamman–Fulcher (VTF) behavior. The behavior of polyethylene oxide (PEO) was also studied by P. Jeevanandam and S. Vasudevan.58 For the PEO intercalate materials, the transition temperature was 200 K. It was also found that the intercalated PEO adopted a planar zig-zag structure with at least two strands complexing the alkali cation.
Lithium ion intercalation is an important part in MPS3 research, which makes MPS3 a promising cathode or anode material for lithium-based batteries. The properties of lithium intercalated NiPS3 compounds (denoted as LixNiPS3) were studied by R. Brec et al. in 1978.115 LixNiPS3 with different x values were characterized to get the crystallographic, conductive and optical information. It is noticeable that LixNiPS3 were often obtained by reacting NiPS3 with n-butyllithium in the studies in 1970s and 1980s. Only a few LixNiPS3 materials were studied with x values of 0.5, 1.2 and 3.6 in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 6(a), XRD data (white peaks) depict no significant differences in the relative line intensity or positions upon comparing the spectra of NiPS3 and Li0.5NiPS3, which indicates that the crystal parameters are not significantly influenced at a low lithium ion amount level (x < 1.2). However, when x = 1.2, the peak intensity of NiPS3 greatly decreases, attributing to the crystal damage, which in turn leads to difficulties in explaining the intercalation process via XRD analysis.

A hypothetical structure of the reduced LizNiPS3 phase (right).79 
Meanwhile, the conductivity of LixNiPS3 will be greatly influenced by the intercalation process. Compared to other MPS3 materials, NiPS3 shows a rapid and large conductivity increase in the lithium intercalation process. Even at a rather low concentration (1%), the resistance of the compound decreases from more than 109 to 10−2 Ω cm−1 within an hour. These results suggest either a high reaction activity between NiPS3 and n-butyllithium or a probability of direct electron entrance to the conduction band. The optical transmittance measurement also exhibits the high reaction activity of NiPS3. Initially, the transmittance light is detectable before the intercalation whereas in the intercalation process, transmittance light cannot be recorded anymore due to the high reaction speed.
NMR investigations were conducted on the NiPS3 compound by C. Berthier et al. in 1978.166 The magnetic properties and their modification of LixNiPS3 with different x values are revealed in their experiments. In a range of 0.02 < x < 0.5, there are almost no changes and differences compared with pristine NiPS3, which would be a good supplement to R. Brec's work. Meanwhile, it is difficult to detect the location of lithium ions via31P NMR. We may infer that these electrons are delocalized in the conduction band formed with wavefunctions from S and Ni atoms, which is different from the amine intercalation. Once 0.5 < x < 1.29, a new resonance of 31P appears on the spectra, whose intensity grows with the lithium ion increase, which is attributed to a continuous replacement of a non-magnetic layer to the paramagnetic layer. Combining with the results from 7Li NMR, it is found that the nonmagnetic and paramagnetic layers are stacked either in order or in a disordered manner instead of being totally separated. However, the experiments on the lithium ion mobility, Zeeman and dipolar spin lattice relaxation time measurements exhibit a quite low self-diffusion coefficient about 10−13–10−14 cm s−1, contrary to the good electrochemical performances of LixNiPS3 in the other experiments. Although three models were proposed by C. Berthier et al., they were not enough to explain the NMR results. Further research is necessary to explain the obvious differences from NMR and electrochemical investigations.
Electrochemical studies were conducted by P. J. S. Foot et al. in 1983.167 As expected, Li+ diffusion coefficients of single crystal NiPS3 are much higher than the results from NMR measurements. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the Li+ diffusion coefficients obtained under small currents (Phase I) decrease with the Li+ intercalation process, while the stronger polarization caused by a high current density leads to a constant ion diffusion (Phase II). The crystal resistivity of Phase I was also studied in their research and is displayed in Fig. 6(c). Similar results of measurements parallel and perpendicular to the NiPS3 crystal layer indicate an electronic effect instead of a structural one. Although the resistances dramatically decrease with the increase of lithium ion amount, it still stays on an extremely high level compared with metallic materials. This may be attributed to the strong trap effects of located electrons in lattices in agreement with NMR results.166 When single crystal NiPS3 is charged at small currents, the compound exhibits good rechargeable ability with an x value less than 1.5 in LixNiPS3. But it cannot be well verified by XRD due to no occurrence of significant expansion. And then, with x increasing, LixNPS3 potential becomes constant indicating an irreversible reaction and destabilizing intercalation. Especially, Li2S is detected in the solvent with x > 1.6. Under high currents, single crystal NiPS3 exhibits more complex behaviors. It may be more solvent dependent than one expected for an almost constant potential from x = 0 to x = 3.5 confirmed by Thompson et al. in DME/THF solvent instead of PC.168 As discussed above, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li+ in NiPS3 in high current situations is much larger than that from the NMR studies.
C. Julien et al. also studied the electrochemical and transport properties of LixNiPS3 in 1992.117,169 Two kinds of cells, a liquid non-aqueous electrolyte cell and a solid electrolyte cell, were studied in their research studies. The experiments show good agreements with the previous research studies in discharge curves, the reduction of nickel ions and so on. However, the chemical diffusion coefficient data are quite different from those reported by P. J. S. Foot et al.167 Different from the constant high diffusion coefficient throughout the whole intercalation process, C. Julien's results display obvious increase and decrease of the diffusion coefficient before and after x = 0.4 in LixNiPS3. But these quite low diffusion coefficient values are similar to the XRD results from C. Berthier in 1978.166 These differences may be ascribed to the calculation methods and the choices of parameters. A solid-state lithium battery shows similar discharge curves to those of a liquid non-aqueous electrolyte cell. Reversibility of cells at different discharge states is also investigated using solid-state lithium batteries. A 40% reversibility is obtained at x = 1, while only 20% reversibility is reached at x > 1.5 for the initial discharge process.
Although many research studies have been done on the exploration of LixNiPS3, especially its ionic conductivity, several problems are still unsolved: (1) the great differences between the NMR results and electrochemical measurements; (2) the explanations to the lattice changes when x < 0.5; (3) a clear demonstration of the structures of LixNiPS3 as x > 1.5; (4) there are still many factors that need to be considered more than electronic properties and vacant sites.
With technology development, it becomes possible to detect lithium intercalation with NiPS3, especially in a phase of x < 0.5 (LixNiPS3). The early XRD measurements show no variations of lattice parameters at the early stage of lithium ion intercalation (x < 0.5). Different from XRD, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis is not based on the long range ordered structure, but on the scattering phenomenon of the photoelectron emitted from the central absorption atom by the nearest neighbor atoms, which only reflects the short-range ordered structure around the absorption atoms in materials. EXAFS has become a powerful tool to study the structure of amorphous materials (including liquid). G. Ouvrard et al. studied the Ni coordination change upon lithium intercalation via EXAFS technology helping us to get a further understanding of the lithium intercalation process.78,170 Different from XRD results, the nickel atom movements are well revealed in the EXAFS spectra on various lithium compositions in LixNiPS3. As EXAFS spectra displayed in Fig. 6(d), with the increasing of lithium amount, the peak at about 2 Å corresponding to the octahedral sulfur environment is doubled with a new peak appearing and increasing at a shorter length. This new peak may correspond to the tetrahedral environment for its shorter distance. And the second peak around 3 Å decreases with the intercalation process, which is attributed to the nickel cationic environment including nickel and phosphorus atoms. By detecting the amounts of nickel atoms in different oxidation states, namely, zero and II, it is easy to find that the nickel atom shifts to a tetrahedral site in the intercalation process. And the deficiency of nickel atoms in octahedral sites indicates the remaining nickel atoms in the first shell.
A model of Ni atom migration was proposed by G. Ouvrard et al. to describe the lithium intercalation in NiPS3 in their subsequent work.79 With the help of EXAFS, the nickel atom behaviors were revealed in the lithium intercalation process. In Fig. 6(e), reduced nickel atoms move to the adjacent tetrahedral sites from their octahedral sites two by two in the same layer without crossing the van der Waals gap. In this reduction process, two phases are concurrent including the pristine NiPS3 and completely reduced Li2NiPS3. Although this bi-phase reaction certainly leads to a change of crystal parameters, it was not observed in previous XRD studies. This may be attributed to the fact that the size of micrograin is out of the XRD resolution. Then, in the reversible process, part of nickel atoms could not shift back showing a partial reversibility. It is worth noting that this model is based on the x value lower than 1.5 in LixNiPS3 and a chemical intercalation using butyllithium.
The development of XRD makes it possible to get more details about the highly air sensitive LixNiPS3 compound. The XRD diagrams are obtained with a classical Debye–Seherrer geometry using the film technique. This configuration was notorious for its inaccuracy, both in terms of line positioning and line intensity. R. Brec revealed the nature of the lithium intercalation process with the help of an INEL PSD 120 curve detector, which is able to record air sensitive phase diagrams very accurately.100 A biphased mechanism is only a hypothesis proposed by G. Ouvrard with the help of EXAFS. The real reason for the constant volume of the NiPS3 cell during the lithium intercalation is still unknown. It is really confusing that cell changes were not able to be detected in the XRD measurements. As known, the ion intercalation would bring changes in chemical surroundings, which was confirmed by the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0. The nickel atom migration would also change the volumes of octahedral sites and tetrahedral sites. Although NMR and Mössbauer studies indicate the existence of Li2NiPS3, which suggests a biphased mechanism, further inspection is still needed to verify the assumption.
This time, this biphased mechanism implying NiPS3 and Li2NiPS3 is discovered by XRD measurements. With the help of the INEL detector, more details are revealed to us. This is verified by refining the cell parameters of unaltered NiPS3 in LixNiPS3 and comparing with the pristine one. All XRD spectra are summarized and shown in Fig. 7(a). Within the margin of error, the data of NiPS3 stay unchanged in the intercalation process. The weak peaks are in good agreement with Li2NiPS3. Furthermore, it is noticeable that the NiPS3 line intensity decreases with increasing lithium amount, which is reasonable as lithium intercalation leads to a transfer from NiPS3 to Li2NiPS3. It is also reported that peaks return to be sharp in the deintercalation process. This is also quantified by calculating the lines Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM). An increase of FWHM is observed before Li1.09NiPS3, while a decrease is found at x = 1.35. Although only a few points are recorded, it still exhibits a good agreement with previous studies. FWHM data also show the non-intercalated grains to be sensitive, through microstrain broadening and/or crystal size decrease, to the formation of the poorly crystallized Li2NiPS3 intercalate.

Raman scattering applied in the research of LixNiPS3 materials can also support this mechanism. I. Kerrache et al. reported the Raman and IR study of LixNiPS3.171 In the Raman spectra (Fig. 7b), no peaks significantly shift indicating a stable cell unit during the intercalation, which is in agreement with the previous reports. Two new peaks are observed in IR spectra, and one new peak appears in Raman spectra at 313 cm−1. All these peak changes are attributed to the appearance of LiS6 octahedrons. Notably, a remarkable intensity decrease occurs in the intercalation process in Raman spectra, which may correspond to the decrease of S–S interaction across the van der Waals gap. As for the IR study in Fig. 7(c), two new peaks are observed at 310–370 cm−1 and assigned to stretching vibrations of LiS6. From these results, no significant peak shifts are detected indicating the elementary unit remaining stable and no volume expansion in the lithium intercalation process.
Conductivity measurements are conducted by G. Giunta et al. for the samples LixNiPS3 during and after lithium intercalation.172 In the intercalation process, a rapid increase of conductivity is observed with the prolonged reaction time, indicating an activation energy decrease from 0.8 to 0.01 eV. As shown in Fig. 7(d)–(f), placing NiPS3 in different n-butyllithium concentrations, the trend of sample conductivity changes is the same with a quick increase in the initial period and a rather lower rate after that until reaching an approximate value. In the initial stage, the highly concentrated lithium at the NiPS3 edge exposed to solutions leads to a fast intercalation into samples. Afterwards, the lithium diffusion rates decrease rapidly due to a low lithium concentration in the bulk phase. Subsequently, after a long enough reaction time, all the samples reach similar situations with approximately the same conductivities.

4 Applications
4.1 Battery
In recent decades, research studies of electrochemistry energy storage materials have attracted enormous interest and attention from the whole society. Many 2D materials, for example, graphene,173–175 MoS2176–178 and MXene,179–182 exhibit excellent performances as electrode materials. MPS3 is also applied as the electrode material in light metal based rechargeable batteries, such as lithium ion, sodium ion and potassium ion batteries.
An initial experiment was carried out to study the electrochemical performances of NiPS3 as a cathode in a lithium metal battery in 1977 by A. H. Thompson et al.168 As mentioned before, n-butyllithium was often used in the research of lithium intercalation reactions to determine the capacity of layered materials. In their research, it was found that NiPS3 would react with 4.5 Li by reacting with n-butyllithium. In addition, the storage activity of Na and K was also studied by reacting with sodium and potassium metals, which showed high storage abilities equal to 4.9 Na and 5.5 K per NiPS3 unit. An open circuit voltage of 2.4 V and a discharge plateau of 1.8 V (vs. Li+/Li) were detected. And the cathode depicted good reversibility in 300 cycles at a 30% discharge depth.
The electrochemical performances of a-NiPS3 were studied as a counter electrode of the lithium metal electrode by E. Prouzet et al., which was also compared with the behaviors of crystalized NiPS3 (c-NiPS3) to identify the influence of distortions in a-NiPS3.183 It is necessary to mention that a-NiPS3 is much more sensitive to moisture than c-NiPS3. As shown in Fig. 8(a), a-NiPS3 sample takes up water very rapidly and depicts a 5% weight increased in the initial 40 min in open air, and the water uptake flats out after 30 h with an equilibrium value of 12%. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct a-NiPS3 experiments in a glove box or under an inert atmosphere to protect a-NiPS3 from moisture. Open circuit voltages of both a-NiPS3 and c-NiPS3 are measured at different lithium intercalation amounts after a charge process at a small current density and relaxation in turn. A plateau around 2.0 V is found in c-NiPS3 data, while only a slope is found for a-NiPS3 in the x range from 0 to 1.3. The voltage of a-NiPS3 is higher than that of c-NiPS3 in the whole range. The polarizations of a-NiPS3 and c-NiPS3 in the lithium intercalations are reflected by comparing the open circuit voltages before and after relaxations, which is shown in Fig. 8(b). It clearly demonstrates a weak polarization achieved by a-NiPS3, which may be due to a faster lithium diffusion in a-NiPS3.184

Another remarkable study on NiPS3 was conducted on the solid-state battery. In the research of C. Julien et al., a thin B2O3–Li2O–Li2SO4 layer was introduced as the solid-state electrolyte.169 Compared with the pure NiPS3 cathode, the composite one consisting of 65% NiPS3, 15% solid electrolyte, 15% acetylene black and 5% PTFE showed better performance. This constructed cell was tested in a voltage range from 1.0 to 3.0 V, and 63% of the designed theoretical capacity was achieved at a current density of 50 μA cm−2. The NiPS3 composite electrode exhibited good rate capability with 1.56, 1.47, and 1.41 mA h at current densities of 15, 30, and 50 μA cm−2 respectively in a battery with 1.8 mA h designed capacity. Furthermore, an ionic conductivity of 6 × 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1 was also obtained by calculation, which was much improved compared with the pure NiPS3 by adding 15% solid electrolyte and 15% acetylene black. Based on the Li2S-P2S5 solid electrolyte, Yuta et al. investigated the electrochemical performance of NiPS3 in solid-state batteries.185 The charge–discharge curves and cycling performance are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). In a voltage range between 0.8 and 2.5 V, the first discharge capacity is 216 mA h g−1, indicating 1.5 mol of Li ions intercalated into 1 mol of NiPS3. But the first charge capacity is only 102 mA h g−1 corresponding to 0.7 mol Li ions per NiPS3. This irreversibility agrees with what is discussed about the EXAFS. A discharge plateau of 1.2 V is observed in the first discharge curve, while it increases to 1.5 V in the next cycles. It still delivers a capacity of 80 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at a current density of 64 μA cm−1.
FePS3 was also applied in the all-solid-state lithium secondary battery.186 80Li2S·20P2S5 was used as the solid electrolyte, when a Li–In sheet acted as the anode material. As shown in Fig. 8(e), the initial discharge capability is 220 mA h g−1, which corresponds to an insertion of 1.5 mol Li+ per unit FePS3. Meanwhile, the first charged capacity is 171 mA h g−1 corresponding to 1.2 mol Li+ per unit. Similar to Fig. 8(c), an obvious plateau in the charge–discharge curve is observed, indicating potential new mechanisms other than the intercalation process. According to the cycling performance displayed in Fig. 8(f), FePS3 exhibits a reversible capacity of 107 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. The ratio of solid electrolyte is also investigated in their research. It is found that the ratio of electrolyte can hardly influence the charge–discharge plateaus, which are around 0.9 V and 1.5 V for the first discharge and charge processes lower than those of NiPS3.
There were also reports about NiPS3 used as the electroactive material for primary lithium batteries by N. N. Redin et al.82 Different from a lithium ion battery, a primary lithium battery usually achieves higher capacity since material reversibility is ignored. The reactions can be divided into three stages. Firstly, the lithium ions will occupy all the octahedral voids in the van der Waals gap, which can be expressed as 1.5 Li + NiPS3 → Li1.5NiPS3. If the Ni2+ is considered as the reaction center, there may be two lithium ions reacting with NiPS3, which will exhibit a higher specific capacity than 1.5 lithium ions. It is possible to get a much higher capacity by ignoring the structural reversibility. A maximum of 9 lithium ions can react with each NiPS3 indicating the formation of Li3P, Li2S and Ni. Compared with the discharge voltage of 1.5 V for FePS3, NiPS3 displays a higher discharge voltage of 1.8 V, which will be an advantage for NiPS3 as the cathode for the primary battery. The 9 Li insertion per FePS3 unit is also achieved in the voltage range from 1.8 to 1.2 V inducing specific capacity and specific energy values as high as 1160 A h kg−1 and 1770 W h kg−1. Although NiPS3 is not tested in this work, it could be expected that NiPS3 may deliver a better performance in capacity and energy.
N. N. Redin et al. also applied NiPS3 materials in medium-temperature lithium batteries, which contained a molten LiSCN-KSCN electrolyte and a Li3Sn counter electrode.187 At a low current density of 2 mA cm−2 considered as the quasi-equilibrium state, the battery exhibits different steps in the lithium intercalation process, which is reflected on the curve of voltage evolution with x in Fig. 8(g) (the discharge curve is marked with 2). The lithium ion occupies the octahedral void step by step in the regions of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5. When the X value is increased to 2 to 5, a plateau with an average voltage of 1.95 V appears. A further increase in lithium amount leads to a decrease of voltage (vs. Li+/Li) to 1.8 V and levels off when NiPS3 achieves a max x value of 9, indicating a possibility of Li3P and Li2S formation. All these steps can be summarized as follows: step I 508 W h kg−1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.5 at the average potential of 2.35 V), step II 1520 W h kg−1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 5.0 at the average potential of 1.95 V), and step III 2194 W h kg−1 (0 ≤ x ≤ 7.5). The reversibility of NiPS3 at different discharge depths was studied in their report at various x values of 0–1.5, 0–1.8, 0–2.0, 0–2.6, 0–2.7, 0–3.0 and 0–3.3. The reaction mechanism is assumed to be different before and after x reaches 1.5, and the lithium ions intercalate into octahedral voids. With more lithium being introduced into the system (x > 1.5), several reactions between lithium and NiPS3 happen. It is also shown in this research that there is a reversibility of 3 Li atoms per NiPS3 unit, which is more than 1.5 Li as discussed before.
Recently, many 2D materials are applied in the studies of lithium ion batteries with great success due to their distinctive physical and chemical properties, including large specific surface area, rich exposed active sites, and variable electronic structures. TMDs may be the most attractive materials for lithium ion batteries among these 2D materials.188–191 Compared to the layered TMDs, MPS3 usually has a higher theoretical specific capacity than corresponding sulfide. Moreover, the introduction of P can also improve the electronic conductivity, which may lead to better rate and cycling performances. Yan et al. systematically studied the electrochemical performances of MPS3 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) nanosheet materials applied in lithium/sodium ion batteries.77 Here, we mainly focus on the NiPS3 nanosheet material. The NiPS3 nanosheet material with a lateral size of 60 to 400 nm and a thickness about 18 nm was prepared via template methods described above. Although no direct evidence is acquired to explain the mechanism of reactions between NiPS3 and lithium/sodium, the references can still help us to partly solve these problems. In CV measurements Fig. 9(a), there are three peaks in the first discharge curve for reaction with lithium metal. By comparing with the CV curves in other reactions, like NiS with Li and Ni3P2 with Li, these peaks can be attributed to three successive steps in the reactions: firstly, the peak at 1.75 V corresponds to an insertion of a lithium ion into the van der Waals gap; then, reduction of Ni2+ leads to the formation of a peak around 1.0 V; the last peak centered at 0.65 V may be caused by the formation of LixP. The anodic part may be attributed to reversible reactions including the decomposition of Li2S and LixP and the oxidation of metallic nickel. A high specific capacity and a good stability were reported by them. The NiPS3 electrode displayed a capacity of 700 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a 0.2 A g−1 current density. Even at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1, it still retains a capacity of 550 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Although this NiPS3 nanosheet material achieves a high capacity and good stability, it is noticeable that the capacitive contribution is about 70% at a scan rate of 2.0 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 9(d). Only the first 1.5 lithium ions are considered for insertion into the van der Waals gaps in theory; the other 7.5 lithium ions will experience the presence of NiPS3 as discussed before. Taking this into consideration, the capacitive capacity should be lower than 17%. The sodium storage ability was also reported by Yan et al.77 All of the MPS3 electrodes display excellent rate capacity. For example, NiPS3 nanosheets show the 4th-cycle specific capacities of 1026, 696, 650, and 383 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.05, 1.0, 4.0, and 10 A g−1, respectively. Similar to the lithium ion battery, it also shows high capacitive contribution to the capacity. However, it is different from the CV of a lithium ion battery; only two peaks appear in the cathodic process (Fig. 9c). These peaks may be attributed to the sodium ion intercalation and the reductions of Ni and P, respectively.

In addition, few-layer NiPS3 nanosheet materials and bulk NiPS3 were compared in lithium ion batteries in another work by Yan et al.86 The linear relationship of the cathodic and anodic peak current (ip) and the square root of the scan rate (mV s−1)1/2 for both bulk NiPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheet are shown in Fig. 9(e). The obtained slopes for the NiPS3 nanosheet are 1.41 and 2.02 for cathodic and anodic peaks, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for bulk NiPS3 are 0.55 and 0.47. This obviously demonstrates a higher lithium diffusion efficiency in the NiPS3 nanosheet than in bulk NiPS3. Similar to many other nanomaterials, the NiPS3 nanosheet delivers a quite low initial coulombic efficiency of 55% as can be seen from Fig. 9(f). As shown in Fig. 9(g) and (h), the NiPS3 nanosheet also depicts excellent electrochemical performances with a capacity of about 800 mA h g−1after 150 cycles, while bulk NiPS3 has only a low specific capacity. The NiPS3 nanosheet material still delivers 305 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1, which is nine-fold of that of the bulk one. In addition, different from what was reported above, four peaks are observed in the initial discharge process of the lithium ion battery. More work needs to be done to well understand the reaction mechanism between lithium ions and NiPS3.
Wang et al. applied an FePS3@C composite material in lithium ion batteries.192 This anode material shows an initial specific capacity of 1231 mA h g−1. After 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, it still delivers a specific capacity of about 980 mA h g−1. The CV curves are also shown in Fig. 9(i), which are similar to those of NiPS3 in a lithium ion battery but depicting different peak positions. As indicated in this research, the reaction mechanism was unclear. The reaction between lithium and SnPS3 was also studied by Srinivasan Madhavi et al.118 The SnPS3 anode delivered a lithiation capacity of over 800 mA h g−1 at a specific current of 100 mA g−1. The lithium storage mechanism was investigated in this research by XPS and electrochemical methods, which was similar to the research on using NiPS3 as an anode material in lithium ion batteries. By comparing with the CV profiles in tin and phosphide anodes, this research indicates the formation of Li4.4Sn and Li3P. XPS results of the SnPS3 anode in the lithiation and delithiation processes are shown in Fig. 9(g). Sn 3d peaks change correspondingly to a cycling of Sn valence states between Sn2+ and Sn0. However, the P 2p peaks cannot recover to the initial peak position indicating the presence of elemental phosphorus in the electrode. Besides, the assignment of peak at 134 eV was not clear. More evidence is needed to clarify the reaction mechanism of alkali metals and MPS3.
4.2 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
The increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy has led to a revolution for energy structure. H2 is considered as a promising next generation source for its high specific energy density and great reserves. Water splitting driven by electricity or solar energy is a cost-effective way to produce highly pure hydrogen. The OER is a pivotal part in the water splitting reaction requiring catalysts with high efficiency and effective cost. A host of 2D materials have been extensively studied in this field. Among them, transition metal compounds have exhibited great potential as OER catalysts in previous reports.193–197 MPS3 has also been considered as catalysts in these reactions due to its preferred intermediate range of bandgaps from 1.3 to 3.5 eV.89 And the similar structure of MPS3 materials makes it feasible to tune the electronic structures by elemental doping and to optimize Gibbs’ free adsorption energies of key species to increase the charge transfer and intrinsic OER activity.
Recently, B. Konkena et al. reported the behavior of a NiPS3@NiOOH core–shell material in the OER.198 This NiPS3 compound shows a low onset potential of 1.48 V (vs. RHE) and good stability for over 160 h. In their experiments, ultrathin nanosheets are obtained by exfoliation of bulk NiPS3 as illustrated in Fig. 10(a). Images from AFM and SEM confirm a typical NiPS3 nanosheet with a lateral dimension of 500 nm and average thickness of 0.64 nm, close to the thickness of a single sheet (0.5 nm). This typical size makes it possible to expose more edge sites, which are considered as critical active sites in the OER. As expected, this NiPS3@NiOOH nanosheet material shows good catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density, which is lower than that of the standard RuO2 catalyst (410 mV). Furthermore, this NiPS3@NiOOH nanosheet is also compared with NiS2 and Ni2P to understand the roles of S and P elements in the OER process. It seems that this distinctive performance could be attributed to the synergistic effects of P and S. The great performance of the NiPS3@NiOOH nanosheet material may be caused by the high density of exposed edge sites and the heterojunction band structure where S and P modify the surface electronic states.
 Fig. 10  (a) Scheme of the liquid exfoliation process and (c) Ni 2p core level XPS spectra recorded after the OER;198 (b) NiPS3 solvent before and after exfoliation in different solutions;86 (d) corresponding Tafel plots of the series samples;95 (e) polarization curves and (f) Tafel plots of IrO2, exfoliated NiPS3 (ENPS), and bulk NiPS3 (BNPS) in 1 M KOH solution.86 
Yan et al. researched the OER activity of few-layer NiPS3 nanosheets and bulk NiPS3.86 Various solvents are studied for the exfoliation including N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), formamide, tetrahydrofuran, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethanol, methanol, acetone, and DI water. The exfoliation results are displayed in Fig. 10(b). UV-vis measurements indicate that formamide shows the best exfoliation effect among all these solvents. Furthermore, the lateral size of this exfoliated nanosheets is between 500 to 800 nm, with a thickness between 0.6–1.2 nm. Compared with the commercial IrO2 and bulk NiPS3 electrodes, this NiPS3 nanosheet shows a much lower onset potential of 1.496 V (vs. RHE) and a lower overpotential of 301 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10e). The Tafel slope of NiPS3 also indicates a better OER activity than bulk NiPS3 and IrO2. Nanosheet NiPS3 shows a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1, while those of bulk NiPS3 and IrO2 electrode are 134 mV dec−1 and 93 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 10f). Electrochemical double layer capacity research reveals that nanosheet NiPS3 presents a linear slope of 719.5 μF cm−2, which is about 3.5-fold that of bulk NiPS3. The high catalytic activity can be attributed to the enlarged active areas and enhanced defect density induced by the exfoliation process.
Generally, there are two strategies to improve the catalyst performances: increasing the exposed active sites and improving the intrinsic activity of reaction sites. Yan et al. investigated the OER performances of Fe doped NiPS3.94 Fe doping effectively improved the NiPS3 activity with a low overpotential of 256 mV at 30 mA cm−2 current density and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1. Fe percentage in this Fe-doped NiPS3 is about 5.93 at% with a slight change of cell parameters compared with NiPS3 cell values. In addition to the above mentioned ultrasonic exfoliation, the nanosheet NiPS3 could also be obtained by the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet template method. SEM images show that the template prepared NiPS3 nanosheets have an average lateral size of 160 nm and a thickness about 16 nm, which is much higher than that of the exfoliated ones. Though the as-prepared nanosheets are thicker and with a smaller surface area, their OER performances are still superior to those in B. Konkena's study,198 which implies that an improvement of OER activity can be achieved by doping Fe atoms into NiPS3. LSV measurements verify the mechanism based on Ni2+ oxidation to Ni3+ forming NiOOH, which is also proved in the study of B. Konkena et al. An electrochemical double-layer study indicates a 6.5 mF cm−2 value for Fe doped NiPS3 much higher than those of NiPS3 nanosheets, Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, and RuO2 commercial electrode. It can be inferred that the Fe-doped NiPS3 nanosheet material has an extensive active surface, which may contribute to the outstanding OER performance. Calculations also show a positive effect of Fe doping in NiPS3 on improving reaction activity. The adsorption free energy, an important factor in the OER, is increased from 1.17 eV to 1.43 eV, which is much closer to the optimal value of 1.6 eV. Yan et al. also studied the OER performances of Fe doped NiPS3 associated with MXene.95 A series of materials were prepared with various Fe:Ni ratios, and their performances were investigated with results summarized in Fig. 10d. The optimal Fe:Ni ratio in Fe doped NiPS3 materials is determined to be 3:7, under which the best performance with a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm−2 is achieved accompanied by a lower Tafel slope compared to those of their counterparts. The EIS measurements also verify the obvious decrease of charge transfer resistance compared with materials without an MXene support. The MXene supported Ni0.7Fe0.3PS3 material also exhibits good stability with overlapped LSV curves before and after a 50 h test. A similar research was conducted by Xiang et al.90 A self-reconstructed NiPS3 nanosheet is applied in the OER study. The SEM and AFM images indicate the formation of a few layer nanosheet material with a thickness of about 10 nm. As expected, the NiPS3 nanosheet exhibits a good OER catalyst performance with an exceptionally low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density. The Tafel slope of NiPS3 nanosheets is also much smaller than that of bulk NiPS3 and nanosheet Ni2S.
Zhu et al. studied the catalyst performance of an ultrathin FePS3 layered material in the OER.199 The exfoliated FePS3 shows much better catalytic activity than bulk FePS3 material obtained from the CVT method. It can also be found that the ultrathin FePS3 catalyst exhibits much lower overpotential of 390 mV compared to 460 mV of bulk FePS3. This few layered FePS3 material also exhibits better kinetics with a low Tafel slope value of 58.0 mV dec−1 than the commercial IrO2 catalyst (72.4 mV dec−1). Meanwhile, the catalytic active center, FeOOH, is confirmed by XPS. Compared with the XPS results before OER cycling, there is a new peak at 719 eV representing the Fe3+ oxidation in FeOOH.
4.3 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
As the other part of water splitting, the HER has also attracted lots of interest in recent years. Many 2D materials have been applied in these research studies.200–203 Compared to TMDs, the introduction of phosphorus in MPS3 can tune the hydrogen adsorption free energy by changing the atomic components of the chalcogen ligand dumbbells. Meanwhile, the pyrite structure is still preserved.204 Hence, it is expected that compounds containing both S and P will be excellent catalysts. Zhang et al. studied the NiPS3 performance as a pH-universal electrocatalyst in an HER study.205 The NiPS3 nanoparticles were anchored on defective graphene in this research. Density functional theory (DFT) is used to calculate the chemisorption free energy of a hydrogen atom on the NiPS3 surface (ΔGH), and the results indicate a preference of hydrogen absorption on P sites with a ΔGH value of 0.11, compared to those on S and Ni sites of −0.11 and −0.29 eV. The images of SEM and AFM demonstrate that the size of the catalyst is about 7 nm in thickness with nanoparticles ranging from 1 to 10 nm and pores from 4 to 8 nm in diameter. This catalyst exhibits good performances in the whole pH range including pH values of 0.3, 7 and 14. The performances of the NiPS3/defective graphene material (NiPS3@DG) in PBS and KOH solutions are shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b). It can be observed that NiPS3@DG requires a rather low overpotential of 97 mV for the current density of −10 mA cm−2 in PBS, which is 122 mV for the Pt/C electrode under the same conditions. NiPS3@DG also shows best performances with an overpotential of 99 mV compared to the other materials in KOH solution. Tafel slopes act as strong supporting evidence for the outstanding performance of this NiPS3@DG catalyst with the lowest values of 64 mV dec−1 for PBS and 36 mV dec−1 for KOH solution. After a calculation derived from polarization curves, the NiPS3 catalyst shows a low slope of 39 mV dec−1 close to the Pt/C value of 30 mV dec−1. These good performances could be attributed to the superior conductivity and extraordinary specific area of defective graphene. The heterostructure may also play an important role in the HER, which could maximize the reaction area of NiPS3. In addition, the chemical active surface of 72.26 mF cm−2 is also tested by the double-layer capacitance method, which is much higher than those of NiPS3 and NiPS3 on graphene.

Li et al. reported their study on applying cobalt doped NiPS3 in HER research.206 XRD results display a slight shift of the (001) plane peak from 13° to 15° (2θ) due to the larger size of Co than Ni. As shown in Fig. 11(c), many Ni1−xCoxPS3 materials are studied with different ratios of Co (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09). The optimized Ni0.95Co0.05PS3 exhibits good performances with 71 mV overpotential at a current density of −10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 77 mV dec−1 in a 1.0 M KOH solution. The conductivity improvements may be one of the most important reasons for the good electrochemical performances. It can be found that the conductivity efficiency increases from 1.15 × 10−9 to 2.52 × 10−6 S cm−1 with the Co amount increase. Furthermore, in Fig. 11(d), the EIS study also shows similar results on charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct values for NiPS3, Ni0.97Co0.03PS3, Ni0.95Co0.05PS3, Ni0.93Co0.07PS3, Ni0.91Co0.09PS3 vary from 82.3 to 12.1 Ω. Although NiPS3 shows a better conductivity than Co doped NiPS3, it delivers the lowest specific capacity of 0.745 mF cm−2 among all these materials, which is much lower than that of Ni0.95Co0.05PS3 (3.28 mF cm−2). Co doped NiPS3 displays much more active sites than pure NiPS3. Cobalt doping is also studied by Yan et al. in water splitting.207 Not only are the HER performances studied in their report, a water-splitting electrolyzer is also constructed using CoNiPS3 as both anode and cathode materials. The performances of this electrolyzer are displayed in Fig. 11(e). The durability tests also reveal the good stability of the mosaic CoNiPS3/C nanosheets with an 89.2% current density retention after testing for 28 h at 30 mA cm−2 (Fig. 11f).
As expected, the Fe doped NiPS3 material also delivers good HER activity. The schemes of NiPS3 and Fe doped NiPS3 calculated by DFT are shown in Fig. 11(g) and (h), respectively.94 Calculation suggests that the doped Fe atoms are less stable than Ni atoms, which may contribute to the absorption improvement between Ni and oxygen intermediates. Yan et al. studied the electrochemical performances of Ni0.7Fe0.3NiPS3 supported by MXene.95 In 1 M KOH solution, this Ni0.7Fe0.3NiPS3@MXene reveals a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA cm−2 density, which is much lower than those of Fe doped NiPS3 nanosheets with Fe and Ni ratios of 1:9, 2:8 and 4:6. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope is also the lowest among these materials. The double-layer capacitance of Ni0.7Fe0.3NiPS3@MXene is about 1.25 times larger than that of Ni0.7Fe0.3NiPS3. In their experiments, a Ni0.7Fe0.3PS3@MXene‖Ni0.9Fe0.1PS3@ MXene couple used for water splitting shows a low onset potential of 1.42 V in 1 M KOH solution. When the current density reaches 10 mA cm−2, an applied potential of 1.65 V is recorded lower than 1.71 V of IrO2‖Pt/C noble electrocatalysts.
Yu et al. also applied the few-layer FePS3 nanosheet material in the HER research.208 In their experiments, the few layer FePS3 nanosheet materials are obtained by amine-assisted exfoliation. And the electrical conductivity could be adjusted by controlling reaction temperatures, which could influence the ratio of Fe3+/Fe2+ and crystallization. It is found that the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio increases with the rise of temperature leading to a better conductivity. However, the high reaction temperature would also lead to amorphization and more defects of sulfur causing high resistivity, which can be seen from the HRTEM images of different samples in Fig. 11(i). The lowest overpotential of 241 mV is achieved by the FePS3 material exfoliated at 120 °C. Meanwhile, the Tafel slope of 94 mV dec−1 for this material is lower than those of FePS3 nanosheets exfoliated at other temperatures, indicating a fast HER kinetics (Fig. 11j). S. Sampath et al. applied few-layer FePS3 in the HER as a wide pH range catalyst.209 The SEM image of rGO-few layer FePS3 is shown in Fig. 11(k), which exhibits best performances in the studied pH solutions. This FePS3 compound displays excellent stability for 1000 cycles in 0.5 M KOH, 3.5 wt% NaCl and PBS (Fig. 11l). To investigate the effects of elements, the adsorption energies of different sites are calculated through the DFT method. For single hydrogen atom absorption, the observed values of S, P and Fe sites are 0.09, −0.19 and −0.26 eV, respectively. Combined with the results of NiPS3 HER catalyst activity, it can be concluded that the PS3 subunit plays an important role in reaction processes, especially, in H absorption.
4.4 Sulfur ion oxidation
S2− is quite common in pollutants from wastewater. Due to their high toxicity, it is crucial to remove sulfur ions in wastewater treatment. Traditional biological treatment cannot effectively remove sulfur ions. However, after an oxidation by oxygen, S2− would change into nontoxic elementary sulfur, which is easily removed by filtering or biological methods. MPS3, especially NiPS3, also exhibits good potential in this field.
A. Andreev et al. studied the catalyst activity of NiPS3 in the sulfur ion oxidation process in 1994.81 A good linear relationship between the reaction rate and NiPS3 loading was observed at a constant concentration of sulfur ions; meanwhile, the reaction rate correlated linearly with the sulfur ion under a predetermined NiPS3 loading. XPS measurements were conducted to investigate the reaction mechanisms. After treatment, a new valence of nickel appeared accompanied by a broadened Ni(2p3/2) peak. The fitting results showed a Ni2+/Ni0 ratio of 12%:88%. Associated with the successful isolation of Na0.5+(H2O)y[NiPS3]0.5−, a scheme was proposed in their work (Fig. 12a): xNa+ + 0.5xS2− + yH2O + [NiPS3] →(Na+)x(H2O)y[NiPS3]x− + 0.5xS0(1) (Na+)x(H2O)y[NiPS3]x− + 0.5xO2 → xNa+ + (y − x)H2O + [NiPS3] + 2xOH−(2)

Sulfide ion concentration 3 g L−1 (T = 20 °C).210 
This mechanism was further confirmed by XPS and XRD studies. In another research reported by A. Andreev et al., several intercalates were studied in the sulfur ion oxidation research including sodium ion, pyridinium, tetraethylammonium and polyethylene glycol intercalates.210 The XRD results indicated that intercalation could efficiently expand the distance of the van der Waals gap. The maximum spacing value of these intercalates was 1.498 nm, which was much larger than 0.645 nm of pristine NiPS3. All the intercalates show better catalyst performance than the pristine one (Fig. 12b). Furthermore, compared to NiPS3, these intercalates display low activation energies of 35.6 kJ mol−1, 23.1 kJ mol−1 and 22.8 kJ mol−1 for sodium intercalate, pyridinium intercalate and polyethylene glycol intercalate, respectively, with NiPS3 having a value of 48.3 kJ mol−1. All these results indicate that the van der Waals gap plays a pivotal role in the oxidation process. As shown in Fig. 12(c), these catalysts showed good stability with a constant reaction rate, after re-addition of sulfide ions into the solution. In addition, XPS results confirm the appearance of PS43− in which group the P atom in the 5+ oxidation state probably acts as an intermediary.
Similar to the research studies of the HER and OER, the effect of element doping on sulfur ion oxidation was also studied. In the research by E. Manova et al., not only bimetallic layered compounds, Ni0.6Fe0.4PS3 and Ni0.83Cu0.34PS3 were studied, their sodium intercalates were also tested as catalysts of sulfur ion oxidation reactions.80,211 Ni0.6Fe0.4PS3 shows the best oxidation rate, which is about twice of NiPS3 and Ni0.83Cu0.34PS3, while FePS3 exhibits almost no activity for sulfur ion oxidation. Meanwhile, sodium intercalated Ni0.6Fe0.4PS3 and Ni0.83Cu0.34PS3 display much higher catalytic activity than those of their undoped counterparts. It is worth noting that the activation energies of sodium intercalated materials are higher than pristine ones. In general, a higher activation energy leads to a lower activity. The contradictory experimental results to the general understanding can only be interpreted by other critical factors playing more important roles in sulfur ion oxidation than activation energy. By comparing the XPS results of nickel before and after sodium ion intercalation in Ni0.6Fe0.4PS3 and Ni0.83Cu0.34PS3, it is obvious that Ni 2p3/2 peak shifts to a lower binding energy corresponding to an increased electron density. Another reason for the increasing of catalyst activity may be the increase of defect sites in NiPS3 caused by intercalation as discussed before.
4.5 Others
S. Sampath et al. reported the application of NiPS3 as flexible humidity sensor materials.212 Although the high surface area and favorable electrical properties make graphene a promising sensor material, the low sensitivity and high intrinsic conductivity of graphene limit its practical application in resistivity-based moisture sensing devices. Other 2D materials such as TMDs and BP have been found to exhibit good performances for various gas phase analytes including moisture, but the response and recovery times are not very satisfactory.213–216 A NiPS3 nanosheet based humidity sensor exhibits great sensitivity, quick response and superior selectivity. A NiPS3 based sensor shows an extremely high response of 1.82 × 106 at 98% relative humidity (RH), which is much higher than 1.1 × 103 of MoS2 and 1.49 × 101 of graphene. The current of the NiPS3 humidity sensor is stable and repeatable at cycles between 90% RH and dry air (Fig. 13a right). The response time is about 1–2 s at low RH and about 3 s at high RH. As for the tests for the selectivity of the NiPS3 based humidity sensor, N2, O2, CO2, ethanol and acetone are all introduced in the experiments. It can be shown clearly from Fig. 13a (left) that the NiPS3 sensor does not show any responses to the gases except moist air. In addition, this flexible device shows constant performances in both flat and bent states (Fig. 13c).

As an effective and cheap energy storage strategy, hydrogen storage has attracted lots of interest and research in recent years.217–220 Hydrogen storage in solid state materials shows great advantages over liquid and gas storage methods with superior safety and high storage density. NiPS3 is considered as one of most promising materials for hydrogen storage for its unique layered structures. N. Ismail et al. studied the hydrogen storage properties of NiPS3 and CoPS.221 The experiment indicates a hydrogen storage of up to 1.2 wt% and 1.7 wt% by NiPS3 and CoPS respectively under a pressure of 20 bar at 80 K. From Fig. 13(b) and (d), good linear relations are observed between the hydrogen pressures and weight percent, which may indicate a molecule state of hydrogen storage in the van der Waals gap.
He et al. reported monolayer FePS3 quantum sheets as a catalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.222 Compared with the bulk FePS3 material, the quantum sheet FePS3 shows a much higher efficiency of 290 μmol h−1, which is about 3-fold that of the bulk one. Meanwhile, the quantum sheet FePS3 exhibits good stability in the cycling test for 40 h. MnPS3 was applied in the research of field effect transistors (FETs) and UV photodetectors by S. Sampath et al.223 The band diagram of the MnPS3 phototransistor is provided in Fig. 13(e). MnPS3 based FETs with gold contacts show p-type conductivity and an on–off ratio of ∼103. Meanwhile, the effect of nanosheet thickness is also studied in their research. Drain currents increase with the increasing of layer number, and the on–off ratio for different thicknesses varies from 102 to 103. This transistor device has also been verified to be a good ultraviolet photodetector with a photoresponsivity of 288 A W−1 at a wavelength of 365 nm. Yi et al. reported the photochromic response behavior of spiropyran-MnPS3 intercalate nanoparticles.224 The colloid formed in PVP/chloroform has a pale yellow color and shows no band above 350 nm. It turns violet after irradiation at 365 nm for 10 min. Comparing the IR spectra before and after the irradiation, a new band peak appears around 560 nm corresponding to a structure change of spiropyran to merocyanine. This photochromic response also shows a good repeatability for 12 times and a stability for hours. Fig. 13(f) exhibits the color changes of dispersed spiropyran-MnPS3 intercalate nanoparticles under different illumination conditions. MnPS3 also shows anticancer behavior towards lung cancer A549 cells in the research by Martin Pumera et al.225 The results obtained in their research show typical toxic behavior to A549 cells. For example, as shown in Fig. 13(g), only a dosage of 3.125 μg mL−1 can decrease the cell viability by approximately 50% after a treatment for 24 h. This high toxicity of MnPS3 would be an advantage for application in anticancer treatments.
5 Conclusions and perspectives
The development of 2D nanomaterials has brought MPS3 back to our view in recent years. In this review, we summarize the synthesis methods, crystal structure, electronic structure, conductivity, magnetism, optical properties, and intercalation capability of MPS3, and its applications in lithium-based batteries, sodium ion batteries, water splitting, sulfur ion oxidation and so on. As for the MPS3 synthesis methods, the solid reaction method, vapor-phase growth technology, sol–gel method and template method have been developed. Different synthetic methods for MPS3 have their own advantages. For instance, the solid reaction method can synthesize large quantities of products, while vapor phase technology has a low reaction rate. However, the samples obtained via vapor phase methods usually exhibit good crystallization. Sol–gel methods are used to obtain amorphous NiPS3 at room temperature without further annealing. Template methods are often used to obtain NiPS3 with a nanosheet structure. In contrast, the samples from other methods usually require an exfoliation to obtain NiPS3 nanosheets. Compared with the other synthesis methods of 2D nano materials, many research studies need to be conducted, especially the bottom up methods to achieve nanosheet materials.
The research studies about MPS3 properties were mainly conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. The most attractive property of MPS3 is its lithium intercalation ability, making it a potential lithium battery electrode material. The intercalation mechanism at a low intercalation rate of x < 1.5 is indisputably interpreted by the movement of metal atoms from the initial octahedral sites to adjacent tetrahedral sites two by two, whereas the mechanism of lithium intercalation at x > 1.5 is still controversial. It can be found that the development of characterization techniques plays an important role in these research studies. For example, the changes of NiPS3 crystal cell parameters cannot be detected by XRD at first. However, an INEL PSD 120 curve detector makes it possible to reveal the biphased mechanism of the lithium intercalation process. EXAFS helps us to get the information of nickel atom surroundings. It is no doubt that the highly developed technologies now would promote a further understanding of lithium behaviors. Nevertheless, the structure evolution with lithium intercalation and reaction products are still unclear to us. Explanations are still absent for the different ionic conductivity obtained from NMR and electrochemical measurements.
As discussed above, there are enormous applications of MPS3 in batteries, water splitting catalysts, sulfur ion oxidation, hydrogen storage, humidity sensors and so on. Not only is the bulk MPS3 material studied in these reports, MPS3 samples with a nanosheet structure are also applied in lithium ion batteries, sodium ion batteries and catalytic reactions. For instance, the nanosheet NiPS3 delivers much higher capacity and more stable cycling performances with a specific capacity of 800 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, while bulk NiPS3 achieves only a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 under the same conditions.86 Furthermore, doping with elements like cobalt and iron also exhibits great enhancements for reaction activity improvements. The report by Li et al. indicates that Co doping can efficiently influence the catalyst performances.206 By adjusting the Co atom percentage from 0.03 to 0.09, the overpotential varies from 71 to 145 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Although great progress has been achieved on synthesis and application of MPS3 in recent years, there are still massive challenges to be tackled. Although the experimental result of specific capacity is almost equal to its theoretical calculation value in Yan's work, the proposed mechanism for the high capacitive contribution is still not convincing, with no clear explanation of the roles of P and S atoms played in catalytic reactions.
In this review, we summarize the research about MPS3 materials. MPS3 displays great potential in many fields. However, various fundamental problems remain unsolved. A reasonable energy level scheme including P, S and Ni is still needed for MPS3. MPS3 conductivity changes are not well explained at present. There is great discrepancy between lithium ion self-diffusion coefficient results from NMR methods and electrochemical studies. Bulk MPS3 behaviors are not clear in a high lithium intercalation of more than 1.5 lithium ions per MPS3 unit. The intermediates and products are not characterized for nanosheet MPS3 in the charge–discharge process. The research about sulfur ion oxidation with the NiPS3 catalyst is limited to verify its mechanism. In this case, more efforts are needed to explore the unknown problems about MPS3. Definitely, this review will inspire more dedicated research studies to address the problems in this field.
