    , Accepted 10th January 2017First published on 11th January 2017AbstractHigh efficiency organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have experienced rapid development and attracted significant attention in recent years. Electron transport layers (ETLs) play an important role in extracting and transporting electrons in devices. To date, the most widely used ETL is still based on TiO2, whereas studies on other novel ETLs are not sufficient. A novel mesoporous ETL based on La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) has been investigated herein. The LBSO nanoparticles were synthesized under relatively mild conditions and proven to be a suitable material for mesoporous ETL. After optimization, mesoporous LBSO-based solar cells exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 15.1%. By comparing mesoporous LBSO, BSO, and TiO2-based devices, the LBSO-based devices exhibit the highest Jsc, which can be attributed to the much higher electron mobility of LBSO. The electron transport and recombination were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and transient absorption spectrum (TAS). The LBSO-based devices exhibit efficient electron transport and low recombination.
Introduction
Since its first application in 2009,1 the perovskite solar cell (PSC) has become a highly controversial topic in the photovoltaic field. On further research, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials were found to have many excellent characteristics: a relatively suitable and tunable bandgap,2 high absorption coefficient,3 long carrier diffusion lengths for both electron and hole,4 and high and balanced mobilities.5 In recent years, many exciting achievements have been reported. The major research is mainly focused on the fabrication methods,6–11 device structures,12,13 novel materials,14–16 and theoretical analysis.17–20 PSCs have attracted extensive attention because of their low-cost, simple processing, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, PSCs suffer from the limitations of toxic lead content, unstable composition, and hysteresis effect. Moreover, one of the issues associated with PSCs is the poor electron mobility (μ) of TiO2 that limits further improvement of photovoltaic performance for the PSC.21
Some electron transporting materials (ETMs) have been reported to replace the commonly used TiO2. In 2012, Snaith et al. used an insulation material, Al2O3, as an inert scaffold in PSCs.13 Although Al2O3 did not act as an ETM, it replaced the TiO2 mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) and made a large contribution to the emergence of planar heterojunction PSCs. ZnO is a potential candidate due to its high electron mobility and conductivity, which allows a better charge collection and transport.22 Moreover, its electrical and optical properties can be easily tuned by manipulation or doping,23,24 and it can be applied in flexible PSCs since it can be processed at low temperatures.25 As an organic n-type semiconductor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl (PCBM) is widely used in organic solar cells.26–28 It is deposited on the top of a perovskite layer in inverted structure (p–i–n structure) devices with little hysteresis.29 However, it also exhibits low-electron mobility like TiO2, which has limited its further application.30 Other ETMs, such as SnO2,31 Zn2SnO4,32 and SrTiO3,33 have also been applied in PSCs and achieved great improvements. Recently, some ETMs fabricated by doping34 or combining two compounds35 have gained significant attention. By these manipulation methods, the ETMs may obtain some specific properties, which the original compound does not have, that are beneficial to the devices.
BaSnO3 (BSO) is a competitive candidate due to its large optical bandgap (3.1 eV), relatively high electron mobility,36 and suitable energy levels. It has been employed as ETL for PSCs in our previous study.37 One of its potential advantages is the possibility to tune its electronic or optical properties by doping. The electron mobilities of La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) single crystals and epitaxial thin films are about 320 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 70 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.38 LBSO with this high electron mobility facilitates the fast diffusion of the electrons in the conduction band39 and fast electron transport.23 TiO2 has quite low electron mobility (about 0.1–4 cm2 V−1 s−1).40 Semiconductor mobility depends on the impurity concentrations (including donor and acceptor concentrations), defect concentration, temperature, and electron and hole concentrations. The defect concentration of mesoporous films is always significantly larger than that of the single crystals. As a result, the mobility of the mesoporous films will be much lower than that of the single crystals. This phenomenon has also been mentioned in other studies.41,42 Herein, the measured mobility of the mesoporous LBSO film is 5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and is still much larger than that of the mesoporous TiO2 film (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The unbalanced mobilities between TiO2 and the perovskite absorption layer may hinder the electron transport.21 Thus, LBSO can significantly improve the electron transport if applied in PSCs. While traditional synthesis methods38 of LBSO often require high temperature and a long calcination process (more than 1200 °C and 24 h), which is more energy-consuming, the product is bulk and not beneficial to prepare monodisperse paste and mesoporous films.
Herein, we developed a synthesis method for the fabrication of highly crystalline and discrete LBSO nanoparticles and successfully applied these as a mesoporous ETL in PSC. The PCE of PSC was dramatically increased by doping 5% molar ratio La in the BSO electron transport layer. The LBSO-based devices exhibited a good charge transfer efficiency and low recombination rate. After optimization, the best PCE of 15.1% was achieved with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.1 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.728.
Results and discussion
To investigate the influence of doping La in BSO nanoparticles on the photovoltaic performance of the device, systematic characterizations of LBSO nanoparticles were performed. The LBSO nanoparticles were synthesized by a novel method. The detailed procedure has been discussed in the Experimental section. As we adopted a novel method to synthesize LBSO, first of all the identification of the presence of La in BSO nanoparticles was required. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies of LBSO and BSO nanoparticles were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Because the accuracy of EDS can be affected by various factors, it was only used as a qualitative measurement herein. EDS data of both LBSO and BSO indicate the presence of Ba, Sn, and O elements in the nanoparticles. The peaks belonging to the C element should be attributed to the conductive carbon tape on the substrates, which were detected by the beam passing through the samples. In Fig. 1a, the peaks at 0.83, 4.65, 5.38 keV, and so on belong to La and prove the presence of La in the nanoparticles. However, more analytical measurements were required to identify whether La was doped in the crystal lattice of BSO nanoparticles or just remained in the compounds in other forms. Therefore, the nanoparticles were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1c. The XRD spectra not only indicate the good crystallinity and purity of LBSO and BSO nanoparticles, but also point out that there is no significant difference between these two spectra. Doping La caused little changes in the XRD spectra, which means it almost has no effect on the crystal lattice structure of BSO. This is consistent with the results reported in literature.43 If La has other forms in the compounds after a high-temperature (900 °C) calcination, it should probably be lanthanum oxide. However, no peak belonging to lanthanum oxide was observed in the LBSO XRD spectrum. Thus, it can be confirmed that La is doped in the crystal lattice of BSO nanoparticles. Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of LBSO and BSO nanoparticles, which are similar. Both LBSO and BSO nanoparticles are highly dispersed and their particle size distribution remains in a small area. There is no significant difference between the SEM images of LBSO and BSO nanoparticles. This indicates that doping La in BSO nanoparticles does not change the morphology, size distribution, and dispersion of the nanoparticles. Moreover, it is consistent with the XRD spectra shown in Fig. 1c.

The abovementioned measurements have proven that doping La in BSO will not have much influence on the crystal lattice structure and nanoparticle morphology. The band gap of LBSO is still about 3.1 eV, which is the same as that of BSO, as indicated in the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 3a. However, doping La changes the absorption spectra of the nanoparticles. From a macro perspective, the synthesized LBSO powder is light grey. The UV-vis absorption spectra show that the LBSO nanoparticles have a broad absorption in the long-wavelength region. This may have an undesired impact on the application of LBSO as a mesoporous electron-transporting layer. The light absorption of the electron-transporting layer may induce a light absorption competition between the electron-transporting layer and light absorption layer, which is CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) in our study. This will reduce the photogenerated carriers in the light absorption layer and lead to a decrease in the short-circuit current density, which will finally reduce the PCE of the device. Although the broad absorption in the long-wavelength region caused by doping La in BSO is an unfavorable factor, it may also be relevant to improving efficient electron transfer. The broad absorption might be due to the increase in the electron concentration by doping La, which is similar to the effects of doping Nb in TiO2.44 Furthermore, the mesoporous electron-transporting layer is very thin (about 200 nm) and has light scattering properties; thus, its influence on the light absorption competition against the light absorption layer may not be very strong. Therefore, the light transmission and absorption properties of the LBSO mesoporous electron-transporting layer (mp-LBSO) were also analysed and compared with those of mp-BSO and mp-TiO2. In Fig. 3b, it can be observed that the mp-LBSO film has a deep absorption band in the short-wavelength region between 300 nm and 400 nm. This is mainly caused by the band gap of LBSO and is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 3a. In the wavelength region between 400 nm and 600 nm, the mp-LBSO film has an increasing transmittance from 70% to 90%. The transmittance remains above 90% in the long-wavelength region between 600 nm and 800 nm. The trend of the BSO transmittance spectrum is almost the same as that of LBSO transmittance spectrum. The only difference is the slightly higher transmittance of the mp-BSO film in the 350 nm to 650 nm wavelength region. The transmittance spectrum of the mp-TiO2 film is also similar to that of LBSO. The transmittance spectra indicate that although the transmittance of the mp-LBSO film is a bit lower in the 350 nm to 650 nm wavelength region, it is still sufficient and suitable for the light absorption layer in PSC. The UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 3c show that the absorption of the FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-LBSO/MAPbI3 film is slightly higher than that of mp-BSO in the 400 nm to 650 nm wavelength region. This is possibly caused by the higher transmittance of the mp-BSO film in the 350 nm to 650 nm wavelength region, which is shown in Fig. 3b. The LBSO-based film has little difference in the absorption compared with mp-TiO2-based film. From these spectral analyses, it can be concluded that the mp-LBSO film has a suitable transmittance and does not have strong light absorption competition against the light absorption layer.

The mp-LBSO-based PSC was fabricated by a one-step method with a solvent-engineering technology9 and the detailed procedure has been discussed in the Experimental section. Briefly, MAPbI3 was deposited using a mixture of DMF and DMSO solvents followed by a chlorobenzene drip while spinning. The device structure is a typical mesoscopic nanostructure: FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-LBSO:MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The SEM image of the cross-sectional view of mp-LBSO-based PSC is shown in Fig. 4a. It can be observed that the mp-LBSO layer is filled with MAPbI3 crystals and there are few voids between them. Above the mp-LBSO layer, there is a MAPbI3 capping layer formed by big crystals. The thickness of the mp-LBSO:MAPbI3 mixture layer is about 500 nm, which is sufficient for the light absorption. After a series of optimizations (such as the mole ratio of doping La, the thickness of film, the concentration of diluted paste, and so on), the best PCE of 15.1% was achieved with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.1 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.728 (Fig. 4b and c). The integrated Jsc from the IPCE spectrum is 18.5 mA cm−2, which agrees with the measured value. The hysteresis of the device was examined by changing the scan direction in the J–V measurements (Fig. S1, ESI†). The hysteresis was mainly reflected in the differences in Voc and FF. The PCE of the device was 15.1% for the reverse scan and 13.9% for the forward scan.

To compare the photovoltaic performance of the mp-LBSO, mp-BSO, and mp-TiO2-based PSCs, three types of devices were fabricated by a similar one-step procedure with a solvent-engineering technology. Each group contains 8 samples, and detailed device parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The J–V curves of typical mp-LBSO, mp-BSO, and mp-TiO2-based devices are presented in Fig. 5a. The PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF of mp-LBSO, mp-BSO, and mp-TiO2-based devices are 15.0%, 20.0 mA cm−2, 1.05 V, and 0.718; 13.4%, 18.5 mA cm−2, 1.02 V, and 0.714; and 16.2%, 18.9 mA cm−2, 1.09 V, and 0.787, respectively. To have a comprehensive investigation, Table 1 lists the mean values with standard deviation (STDEV) for PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF of each group. All data present relatively low STDEV (<5%). This indicates a high repeatability and reliability of the experiment. The mp-LBSO-based devices exhibit the highest Jsc among these three types of samples. This can be attributed to the much higher electron mobility of LBSO, which facilitates the fast diffusion of the electrons in the conduction band and fast electron transport. The theoretical model of the electrical conductivity can be described as follows: σ = neμ, where e, n, and μ are elementary charge, concentration of electrons, and electron mobility, respectively. Conductivity is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration. As for the BaSnO3, both n and μ will be increased on doping La with a nominal doping concentration range from 0.01 to 0.07,45 such that the La-doped BaSnO3 will have a higher conductivity. The higher conductivity can enhance the electron transfer ability and results in an increase in the photocurrent density.44 This Jsc also proves that the mp-LBSO layer does not have strong light absorption competition against the light absorption layer. The mean values of Voc and FF of mp-LBSO-based devices are higher than those of Voc and FF of the mp-BSO-based devices. The Voc is mainly affected by the band gap of the light absorption layer and the charge carrier recombination. The light absorption layer is the same in the three devices; thus, the higher Voc should be caused by lower recombination. The FF is mainly affected by the charge carrier recombination and resistance loss. LBSO has a high electron mobility and conductivity. This will reduce the whole series resistance of the mp-LBSO-based devices and minimize unnecessary resistance loss.

To further study the electron transport process, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching of MAPbI3 emission was investigated. The PL spectrum is an effective way to investigate the charge transfer efficiency. Fig. 5b presents the PL spectra of glass/mp-X/MAPbI3 (X = LBSO, BSO, TiO2 or none) films with an excitation wavelength of 473 nm. All the emissions of films show strong peaks at a wavelength of about 770 nm, which correspond to the band-edge emission.17 The film of glass/MAPbI3 exhibits the strongest emission peak, whereas those of others exhibit a significant quenching effect. When excited electrons in MAPbI3 fall back to the ground state, there are three ways to release energy: radiative transition, which contains photoluminescence, nonradiative transition (intersystem crossing, internal conversion), and energy transfer and quenching. Excited electrons of films with a quenching effect can fall back to the ground state by transferring energy to the quenching layer, which is the mesoporous ETL herein. When there is no quenching layer, the energy of the excited electrons is mainly released by photoluminescence and this is the reason for the strongest emission peak of the glass/MAPbI3 film. When there is a quenching layer, some part of the energy of excited electrons will be released by energy transfer and quenching. Thus, the PL quenching effect can be a judgment of the charge transfer efficiency of the quenching layer. In Fig. 5b, the film based on mp-LBSO presents the best quenching effect with the weakest emission peak at 770 nm. It means that quite a large part of the energy of the excited electrons is released by energy transfer. It can be inferred that the charge transfer between mp-LBSO and MAPbI3 is more efficient.
Transient absorption spectra (TAS) were employed to study the charge recombination in the devices (Fig. 6). The tests were measured from the MAPbI3 side with a pump light wavelength of 490 nm and a probe light wavelength of 770 nm. As the charge injection process from MAPbI3 to ETL occurs at picosecond level (<1 ns),7,46 the transient absorption decay at nanosecond level should reflect the charge recombination between MAPbI3 and ETL.4 We retrieved the dominant time constant (τTA) by single exponential data fitting. As the TAS is at nanosecond level, the transient absorption decay is a combination of signals including charge injection and recombination. Among these signals, the charge recombination between MAPbI3 and ETL is the rate-determining step. Therefore, the τTA can be an evaluating factor for charge recombination between MAPbI3 and ETL. The τTA of glass/mp-X/MAPbI3 films (X = LBSO, BSO, and TiO2) are 12.5 ± 0.3 ns, 9.0 ± 0.2 ns, and 13.5 ± 0.6 ns, respectively. These indicate that the mp-LBSO-based film has a relatively long charge recombination lifetime. As presented in Fig. 5a, the higher Voc and FF of the mp-LBSO-based devices also implied lower recombination, which is consistent with the TAS shown in Fig. 6. Unlike BSO and ZnO,23 which also have a high electron mobility, the mp-LBSO-based device shows a low charge recombination.

The stability tests of PCE degradation of TiO2 and LBSO-based unsealed devices are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Many studies that were focused on the stability of PSC have pointed out that TiO2 can accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite under continuous light illumination.47–49 Some studies claimed that devices suffered the light induced degradation resulting from a deep trapping of injected electrons caused by the creation of a large density of deep trap sites on the ultraviolet excitation of TiO2.50 Because TiO2 has a strong ability to extract electrons from organic materials as photocatalysts and from iodide (I−) as electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells, some researchers deemed that TiO2 can extract electrons from I−, oxidize I− to iodine on exposure to light, and the perovskite crystal structure will be deconstructed.51 As a consensus, the application of TiO2 will accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite under the illumination. In Fig. S2,† the light soaking data indicate that the mp-LBSO-based PSC has a relatively higher stability under continuous light illumination than the mp-TiO2-based PSC. This should be attributed to the lower light induced degradation of perovskite in the mp-LBSO-based device. Although the light stability improved by LBSO is still limited, the comparison between mp-LBSO and mp-TiO2 devices can provide a reference to further research on the stability of PSC.

Materials and methods

Preparation of the La–BaSnO3 nanoparticles and paste. 
La(NO3)3·6H2O (0.5 mmol), Ba(NO3)2 (9.5 mmol; 99%, Aldrich), and SnCl4·5H2O (10 mmol; 98%, Aldrich) were dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (170 mL; 30%, SCR) under constant stirring. After it became transparent, citric acid (5 mmol; J&K Scientific) was added to the mixture solution. Then, aqueous NH3·H2O (120 mL; SCR) was introduced and the solution immediately became turbid with white precipitates. The turbid solution was stirred overnight at room temperature. The white precipitates were washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and then freeze-dried. After this, the dried precursor was calcined at 900 °C for 2 h in air and finally grey powder of La-BaSnO3 was obtained.
The La-BaSnO3 paste was homemade. Abovementioned La-BaSnO3 nanoparticles (1 g) were mixed with about 40 mL of absolute ethanol under alternate magnetic stirring and ultrasonication for 1 day. After this, 3.5 g of terpineol, 3 g of ethyl cellulose, and 0.3 g of acetylacetone were added to the suspension and mixed via alternate magnetic stirring and ultrasonication for 1 day. The resulting mixture was introduced into a rotary evaporator to remove excess ethanol. Finally, the paste was further treated with a three-roll mill.

Device fabrication
FTO glass (Pilkington TEC 15) 15 Ω □−1 was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 1 M aqueous HCl. Then, it was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing ethanol for 20 min, deionized water for 30 min, and treated at 510 °C for 30 min. The dense blocking layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO substrate by aerosol spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using a precursor solution of 0.4 mL of bis(acetylacetonate) and 0.6 mL of titanium diisopropoxide in 7 mL of isopropanol. The LBSO, BSO, and TiO2 (Dyesol 30NRT) paste were diluted in ethanol by a quality ratio of 1:5, 1:5, and 1:5.5, respectively. After the FTO substrate was cooled down to room temperature, mp-LBSO, mp-BSO, and mp-TiO2 were deposited by spin-coating their respective diluted paste (40 μl) at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 s, and then annealed at 510 °C for 30 min. A one-step spin-coating procedure was utilized to prepare the MAPbI3 layer. MAPbI3 precursor solution (1 M) was prepared by dissolving 462 mg of PbI2 (99%, Aldrich) and 159 mg of MAI in a mixture solvent of 0.15 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.85 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) under stirring at 60 °C. MAPbI3 precursor solution (30 μl) was spin-coated on the mesoporous oxide film by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1500 r.p.m. and 4500 r.p.m for 20 s and 30 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step in the last 10 s, the substrate was treated with chlorobenzene. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. A volume of spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene, 30 μl) solution was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The solution was prepared by mixing 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μl of TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine), 17.5 μl of LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide, 520 mg in 1 mL of acetonitrile), and 29 μl of FK209 (tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide, 300 mg in 1 mL of acetonitrile). Finally, the back contact was made by thermally evaporating 60 nm gold on the top of the device.
Characterization
The morphologies of all samples were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland). The XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker-AXS Microdiffractometer (model D5005) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra and transmittance spectrum were obtained using the UV-vis spectrophotometer (SOLID3700, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Japan). The carrier mobilities of the mp-LBSO and mp-TiO2 films were measured by the steady-state DC current–voltage analysis using a computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzer land). The PL spectra were obtained by exciting the perovskite films deposited on glass at 473 nm with a standard 450 W xenon CW lamp. The signals were obtained by a spectrofluorometer (photon technology international) and analyzed by the software Fluorescence. Transient absorption (TA) responses of perovskites deposited on glass were obtained using LKS (LKS80, England). The samples were investigated using a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe light wavelength of 775 nm. The repetition rate was 5 Hz, and the energy of the laser device was 150 μJ cm−2.
The J–V curves were acquired using a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter controlled by Test point software under a xenon lamp (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE values were confirmed as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900 nm (PV Measurements, Inc.). The irradiance was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL. Current–voltage curves were obtained using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400, USA). All solar cells were covered with a black mask, which was used to define the active area of the devices, and in this case, it was 0.09 cm2. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an IPCE measuring system (Newport Corporation, CA) equipped with a Xe lamp as the light source.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a novel way to synthesize highly crystalline and discrete LBSO nanoparticles at a relatively low temperature and successfully applied it as mesoporous ETL in PSC. Systematic characterizations of LBSO nanoparticles were carried out. Doping La changed the absorption spectra of the nanoparticles and the synthesized LBSO powder is light grey. The analysis measurements of the LBSO film proved that the mp-LBSO film has a suitable transmittance and does not have strong light absorption competition against the light absorption layer. The best PCE of 15.1% was achieved with a Jsc of 19.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.09 V, and FF of 0.728. The mp-LBSO-based devices were also compared with mp-BSO and mp-TiO2-based devices. The mp-LBSO-based devices exhibited the highest Jsc, which can be attributed to the much higher electron mobility of LBSO. The Voc and FF values of mp-LBSO-based devices were also improved when compared with those of the mp-BSO-based devices. This indicates efficient charge transfer and low charge recombination between MAPbI3 and mp-LBSO, which have also been confirmed by PL spectra and TAS. The promising candidate LBSO will provide a novel perspective about the application and investigation of doped materials in PSCs.
