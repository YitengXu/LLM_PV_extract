    , Accepted 12th July 2022First published on 12th July 2022AbstractOwing to the relentless march of technology of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) are demonstrating impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). More efficient boosting needs to be achieved in reducing the energy loss (Eloss) and enhancing the operational lifespan of TOSCs. Herein, we introduced a medium bandgap NFA, TPIIC, as the third component into PM6:Y6 host devices and found that the highly crystalline guest acceptor TPIIC with a relatively low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, is miscible with the Y6 phase. Moreover, compared with the Y6 neat film, the Y6:TPIIC blend films show higher photoluminescence quantum yield, demonstrating the reduced energy disorder in ternary devices. Consequently, ternary devices exhibit reduced non-radiative recombination loss and delivered distinct improvements in the open-circuit voltage (VOC, 0.861 V) and PCE (17.7%) with a reduced Eloss of 0.535 eV, in comparison to the PM6:Y6 host devices (VOC = 0.840 V, PCE = 15.8% and Eloss = 0.547 eV). Importantly, the role of TPIIC in increasing the glass transition temperature of the ternary blend is illustrated and its applicability for improving relevant stability issues of the host devices is verified. Overall, this study developed an effective means to simultaneously reduce the Eloss and improve operation stability of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic technology solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have increasingly become a hopeful renewable energy technology due to their advantages, including light weight, portability, flexibility, semitransparency, etc.1–9 Importantly, photovoltaic active layer materials are the core compositions that determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) together with the operational stability of organic solar cells (OSCs).10–21 Among the many ways to improve photovoltaic performance in OSCs based on a single-junction configuration, the ternary concept consists of multiple components (D1:D2:A or D:A1:A2), and it is the main driving force towards this record performance.22–25 Early ternary OSCs (TOSCs) were mainly based on fullerene acceptor systems. At that time, absorption spectra concentrated in the visible region need to be widened further, and therefore, some polymer donors with strong absorption were used as the third component in OSCs.26–30 With an in-depth study of non-fullerene small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), recent TOSCs generally contain one donor and two compatible NFAs with complementary absorption, cascading energy levels, and/or similar structural properties,31–35 and current PCEs of over 19% are reported for ternary systems.36 The development in this field is rapidly promoted by the invention of wide bandgap polymer donors (such as PM6,37 PTQ10 (ref. 38) and PM1 (ref. 39)) in combination with narrow bandgap NFAs (such as Y6,40 BTP-eC9 (ref. 41) and L8-BO42) with a high photocurrent (JSC) and fill factor (FF). These efficient active layers have made outstanding contributions to push the performance threshold of OSCs, where relatively large energy loss (Eloss) and stability limitations are still a big challenge.
Notably, the Eloss in an OSC device is caused by radiative charge recombination (Eloss, rad, ΔE2) and non-radiative charge recombination (Eloss, non-rad, ΔE3).43,44 For many high-performance NFA-based OSCs, there is little room or possibility to reduce Eloss, rad. In contrast, the relatively large Eloss, non-rad has a crucial effect on efficiency. In terms of forecasting, a PCE of over 21% can be realized in OSCs if the Eloss, non-rad can be down-shifted to approximately 0.13 eV.45 In particular, the ternary strategy has been widely employed to fine-tune the phase separation morphology, improve the charge transport pathways and reduce the non-radiative voltage loss. For instance, Hou et al. found that the Eloss, non-rad can be restrained by adding a small molecule (NRM-1) into a PBDB-T:IT-4F OSC device.46 Moreover, apart from small molecule donors,47 the introduction of two Y6 derivatives as acceptors in OSCs can also effectively modulate the BHJ active layers and reduce the Eloss, non-rad. For now, although approaches for suppressing the non-radiative voltage loss have been established, continuous expansion of the methods to reduce the Eloss, non-rad is required to further push the PCE threshold of the OSCs.
In addition to the Eloss, non-rad, the stability issue is another crucial factor limiting the potential applications of OSCs. Up to now, good performance OSCs usually do not have excellent long-term light stability.48 Serious PCE burn-in loss has been discovered for the corresponding Y6-based binary and ternary systems, which leads to obvious morphology evolution in these blends.49–51 Additionally, the crystallization behaviors of Y6 derivatives as well as their interfacial energy properties can cause morphological instabilities.52 Impressively, some recent reports demonstrate that the ternary concept can suitably suppress the morphology evolution of relevant active layers during light-soaking and/or thermal annealing.53–55 For example, PY2F-T, which is added as the third component to the PM6:PYT system, can improve the light-soaking stability of the ternary all-polymer system.56
In this research, we designed and synthesized TPIIC, a novel NFA material with an excellent absorption spectrum in the visible region, which possesses an energy bandgap (Eg) of 1.55 eV. Compared with Y6 with an Eg of 1.30 eV, TPIIC has the upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, a complementary optical absorption spectrum, and stronger molecular stacking behaviors. Therefore, it was introduced into the PM6:Y6 system to form a ternary system, and the resulting ternary system showed better active layer morphology, more suitable crystalline properties, a long charge carrier lifetime, and reduced non-radiative recombination energy losses, resulting in a simultaneously improved open-circuit voltage (VOC), JSC and FF. What is more, the role of TPIIC with suitable absorption and reduced energy loss in the ternary devices delivered a PCE of 17.7%, which is significantly higher than that of the PM6:Y6 host devices (PCE = 15.8%). We further find that enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of ternary blends via the introduction of TPIIC can effectively restrain burn-in degradation of the host devices in terms of light-soaking stability and thermal stability.
2. Results and discussion
The small molecule NFA TPIIC with medium bandgap absorption was introduced into the binary host system based on the classic star system PM6:Y6 for fabricating ternary devices. The chemical structures of the materials used are shown in Fig. 1a. The synthesis of TPIIC consists of five steps (Scheme 1). First, 2,2′-(2,5-dinitro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (1) was prepared through the Stille cross-coupling reaction between tributyl(2-thienyl)stannan and 1,4-dibromo-2,5-dinitrobenzene in 84% yield. Second, 4,9-bis(1-hexylheptyl)-4,9-dihydrothieno[3,2-b]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-f]indole (3) was prepared by the double intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization of 1 in 65% yield followed by N-alkylation of 4,9-dihydrothieno[3,2-b]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-f]indole (2) with 1-bromo-1-hexylheptane in 65% yield. Then 4,9-bis(1-hexylheptyl)-4,9-dihydrothieno[3,2-b]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-f]indole-2,7-dicarbaldehyde (4) was prepared in 80% yield by reaction of a lithium derivative of 4 with DMF. Finally, the target TPIIC was obtained through Knoevenagel condensation of aldehyde 4 with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone in 55% yield. The synthetic procedures and characterization data (Fig. S1–S8†) for the precursors and TPIIC are displayed in the ESI† file. Investigation of thermal and thermooxidative stability of TPIIC by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that this material has rather high stability (decomposition temperature (Td) above 330 °C both under nitrogen and in air) (Fig. S9†).

The electrochemical oxidation and reduction curves as well as the absorption spectra in chloroform solution and film states for TPIIC are presented in Fig. S10 and S11,† respectively. The specific electrochemical and optical parameters of this material are displayed in Table S1.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energies of TPIIC were estimated from the first formal oxidation and reduction potentials (−5.82 and −3.92 eV) (Fig. 1b). Compared with the LUMO energy level of Y6, it is significantly increased, and the lower HOMO energy level also ensures sufficient exciton transmission driving force, so it is beneficial to improve the VOC of the ternary devices. Additionally, the absorption profiles (300–1100 nm) of PM6, Y6, and TPIIC of ternary blends are depicted in Fig. 1c. The peak energy of PM6 is situated at 622 nm, accompanied by a strong shoulder peak at 582 nm. Y6 exhibits strong absorption in the near-infrared range, and its peak energy lies at 833 nm. The novel TPIIC shows two strong absorption peaks at 649 and 708 nm, together with PM6 and Y6 provide excellent complementary absorption in the full coverage 400–950 nm range, which is favorable for increasing JSC in ternary systems.
Molecular packing and crystallographic properties of pure materials are characterized by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). As shown in Fig. 1d, the TPIIC film shows an obvious peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, and a much sharper π–π stacking peak, longer crystal coherence length (CCL) (TPIIC = 36.61 Å; Y6 = 22.24 Å) and reduced d-spacing (TPIIC = 3.47 Å; Y6 = 3.64 Å) in the π–π stacking direction, indicating that its crystalline character is relatively stronger as compared to that of the host acceptor Y6. The results suggest that TPIIC prefers more face-on orientations, which is consistent with the strong crystallinity and aggregation characteristics observed by using an atomic force microscope (AFM, inset graph) (Fig. S12†). Additionally, surface free energy (γ) was measured by using the contact angles of the PM6, Y6, and TPIIC neat films (see Fig. S13†). The values are 35.48 mJ m−2 for γPM6, 48.55 mJ m−2 for γY6, and 43.61 mJ m−2 for γTPIIC, respectively. Both Y6 and TPIIC molecules have similar surface energy, indicating that Y6:TPIIC prefers to form an alloy state.22,36 The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ)57 of the discussed active layer materials was calculated by using the equation ,36 where K is a normal constant, and γD and γA are surface tension values. As summed up in Table S2,† the χ values follow the order of Y6:TPIIC (0.13 K) < PM6:TPIIC (0.42 K) < PM6:Y6 (1.02 K), indicating excellent miscibility between Y6 and TPIIC.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a with a device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] (PNDIT-F3N)/silver (Ag). The important photovoltaic characteristics of the corresponding binary and ternary devices, extracted from the J–V plots shown in Fig. S14,† are summarized in Table 1. The PM6:Y6 binary device exhibits an extraordinary PCE of 15.8%, with VOC, JSC, FF values of 0.840 V, 26.2 mA cm−2 and 72.0%. At the same time, ternary devices prepared by doping with different ratios of TPIIC were also investigated to fine-tune the optimal efficiency (Table S3†). The champion ternary device with 15% wt% TPIIC (in acceptor mixtures) exhibits a PCE of 17.7%, resulting from the simultaneously improved VOC (from 0.840 to 0.861 V), JSC (from 26.2 to 27.5 mA cm−2), and FF (from 72.0% to 74.4%). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) testing is performed to characterize the degree and extent of the photoresponse to the solar spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2b, both binary and ternary devices express effective photoresponses between 300 and 950 nm. The main difference is that the corresponding degree of the spectrum between 500 and 700 nm is significantly improved (Fig. S15†), owing to the addition of TPIIC in the ternary system.

To gain a clearer understanding of the exciton dissociation process and exciton dynamics of the corresponding binary and ternary systems, the relevant optical tests were carried out. The measurements of the saturation current (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were performed, as displayed in Fig. 2c. Specifically, Jph is the difference between JL and JD, and Veff is the difference between V0 and V, where JL and JD are the JSC values under illumination and in the dark, and V0 is the voltage where Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias voltage, respectively.58 The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were evaluated according to relevant testing values. The ηdiss and ηcoll values of the binary OSC are 97.08% and 86.38%, respectively. By incorporating 15 wt% TPIIC in acceptors, the ηdiss and ηcoll values increased up to 98.14% and 88.63%. This result suggests that the bulk microstructure can be well optimized, leading to an optimized exciton transport path as a result of a better FF for optimal ternary OSCs. Moreover, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pertinent films were measured by exciting Y6 at 639 nm to detect the charge dissociation efficiency at the D/A interface (see Fig. S16†). The quenching efficiencies of the corresponding blends are 89.0% for PM6:Y6 and 94.5% for PM6:TPIIC:Y6. The high PL quenching efficiency demonstrated that the exciton dissociation efficiency is significantly improved. Besides, transient photovoltage (TPC) analyses were used to further detect the charge extraction processes in the matching devices.59 As depicted in Fig. 2d, the ternary devices showed 0.34 μs of short charge extraction time, which was less than that (0.39 μs) of the binary devices, indicating the more effective charge extraction property of the ternary system.
The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) testing method was used to observe charge transport (electron and hole) properties of the binary and ternary devices, and photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing the voltage. The photo-CELIV characterization method was used to probe the carrier mobility. The PM6:Y6 devices exhibited electron-only mobility (μe) and hole-only mobility (μh) values of 6.51 × 10−4 and 4.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S17 and Table S4†), respectively. The μe/μh ratio was calculated to be 1.62 for PM6:Y6, and higher and more balanced μe (8.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μh (5.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) values were also observed in the ternary blend with a μe/μh ratio of 1.42 (Fig. 2e). More deeply, the average carrier mobility was extracted from photo-CELIV curves measured using different experimental conditions (Fig. S18†). It can be found that the ternary system with a carrier mobility of 3.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in devices is also higher than that of the host system (2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as presented in Fig. 2e. In short, these results are favorable pieces of evidence for the high EQE and FF of the ternary OSCs.
To traverse the recombination mechanisms in the host and ternary systems, the variations of JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity (Fig. S20 and S21†) were evaluated.60 In the JSCvs. Plight diagram, the closer the slope α obtained from the fitted curve was to 1, the lesser the degree of bimolecular recombination in the active layers. As calculated, the ternary device shows an optimized α value of 0.990 compared to the host device (α = 0.963), which suggests that bimolecular recombination is more prominent in binary systems due to the less effective charge extraction. Additionally, the slope of VOCversus Plight is characterized to explain the kinetic processes of trap-assisted recombination in the active layer, and the closer the fitting slope is to 2, the more serious the recombination is. The slopes of the fitting lines for the host and ternary devices are 1.23kT/q and 1.14kT/q, respectively, indicating that there is less trap-assisted recombination in the PM6:Y6:TPIIC devices. Importantly, changes in carrier density and carrier mobility based on different time lengths measured by photo-CELIV are measured for further investigation of charge carrier recombination mechanisms, as depicted in Fig. 2f and S19.† The ternary solar cells exhibit larger carrier density, larger carrier mobility and stronger charge intensity as compared to the host devices at different time scales, which is helpful for the improvement of the overall photovoltaic performance. This conclusion is in good agreement with the results obtained from the transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements (Fig. S22†). The optimal ternary device exhibited a longer charge carrier lifetime (9.30 μs) as compared with the host device (6.36 μs). Overall, these physical results illustrate the main reasons of ternary device improvement, especially in terms of the JSC and FF.
To investigate the correlations between physical mechanisms and morphological characterization studies, AFM and GIWAXS measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the ternary system presents clearer and more appropriate phase separation, smoother morphology, and smaller roughness values as compared with the host blend, which means the introduction of TPIIC can well optimize the exciton transmission pathway and reasonably balance the phase separation scale. The 2D GIWAXS images and the relevant line-cut intensities taken along the OOP and IP directions of the host and ternary blends are depicted in Fig. 3c–e. By fitting the π–π (010) peaks of the binary film at q ≈ 1.73 Å−1, a d-spacing of 3.63 Å and a CCL of 20.89 Å were obtained, as summarized in Table S5.† The lamellar (100) diffraction peaks correspond to the q values of 0.29 and 0.34, which belong to PM6 (Fig. S23†) and Y6, respectively. In contrast, the ternary blend film exhibits a π–π (010) stacking peak at q ≈ 1.74 Å−1, leading to a d-spacing distance of 3.61 Å and a longer CCL of 21.29 Å. These phenomena imply that the ternary strategy contributes to the enhancement of electrostatic interactions between the molecules to reduce the lamellar stacking distance and increase the CCL in the blended films. The ternary blend film shows stronger π–π stacking in the OOP direction than the starting blend film. The analysis results illustrate that the ternary blends exhibit a more prominent face-on orientation and increased molecular crystal property, which facilitates charge transport in the direction perpendicular to the active layer.

To analyze the internal mechanism between the increased VOC and the change in the energy loss in the binary and ternary systems, we carried out detailed voltage loss analysis measurements. According to the reported methods,61 the entire energy loss (ΔE) of the system can be divided into the following three components: (1) ΔE1, interpreted as radiative recombination consumption beyond the band gap; (2) ΔE2, interpreted as bandgap radiation recombination loss below the gap; (3) ΔE3, interpreted as non-radiative energy loss, also denoted as Eloss, non-rad. Specifically, qΔVOC = (Eg − qVSQOC) + (qΔVradOC) + (qΔVnon-radOC), as proven by Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) and electroluminescence (EL) assessments. The optical bandgap (Eg) of blend films was quantified by the intersection between the absorption spectrum and EL of the blend, as demonstrated in Fig. S24,† and the Egs of the binary blend was calculated to be 1.387 eV, and that for the ternary blend was calculated to 1.396 eV. According to the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory,62 it can be seen that both bianry and ternary devices show similar ΔE1 values of approximately 0.253 eV. Thus, the SQ limit output voltages VSQOCs are estimated to be 1.134 and 1.143 V, showing very similar radiative losses below bandgaps (ΔE2 of 0.055 and 0.066 eV) (Table 2) in OSCs. Furthermore, since the non-radiative voltage loss is the difference between ΔVradOC and VOC, ΔE3 is 0.239 eV for the host device and 0.216 eV for the optimized ternary device. To further verify the accuracy of the calculated Eloss, non-rad, we characterized the luminous efficiency of the binary and ternary components by electroluminescence EQE (EQEEL) tests. As displayed in Fig. 4c, the highest electroluminescence EQE efficiency value of the binary device is 9.5 × 10−5, while the highest value of the ternary device is 2.1 × 10−4. ΔE3 can be evaluated using the following equation: ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL),63 where k and T are interpreted as the Boltzmann constant and the Kelvin temperature. The ΔE3 calculated for the binary and ternary device is 0.241 eV and 0.219 eV, respectively. The specific calculated results obtained by the FTPS measurements are presented in Fig. 4d, which confirm the reliability of the test results. The above-discussed results further suggest that the intrusion of a high-voltage medium-bandgap guest acceptor with good compatibility with the host acceptor is an effective strategy to reduce Eloss, non-rad.

The absorption coefficient (α(E)) of organic semiconductors obeys the Urbach rule in the low photon energy region:64α(E) = α0eE−Eg/EU, where E, EU and α0 are interpreted as the photon energy, Urbach energy, and the optical absorption coefficient. By fitting the FTPS curves of the blend films, it can be discovered that the ternary devices delivered a smaller Urbach energy of 24.3 meV than (25.4 meV) the host devices (Fig. 4e), indicating reduced energy disorder in the ternary films. To further analyze the difference in Eloss, non-rad between the binary and ternary systems, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measurements of the Y6, TPIIC, and Y6:TPIIC acceptors were carried out, as demonstrated in Fig. 4f. The PLQY values are 3.5% for Y6, 2.8% for TPIIC, and 4.2% for Y6:TPIIC, respectively. The PLQY of the Y6:TPIIC blend is higher than those of the Y6 and TPIIC pristine films. It is shown that a coplanar conjugated system is formed in the ternary blend, and the formation of the alloy phase region is also verified,65 which is beneficial for the reduction of Eloss, non-rad in ternary devices. Overall, morphological characterization, physical characterization, and energy loss characterizations are self-consistent, reflecting the binary and ternary performance parameters.
To analyze the effect of the addition of TPIIC into the host blend on the operational stability, we characterized the photostability and thermal stability at 85° of the binary and ternary devices. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the PM6:Y6:TPIIC ternary devcies retained 74.7% and 88.0% of their initial efficiency, after up to 1000 hours of the light-soaking and thermal stress treatments, respectively. In contrast, the PM6:Y6 host system exhibited worse photostability and thermal stability, probably due to its unstable molecular configuration and poor degree of phase aggregation. Through the measurements mentioned above (contact angle test, GIWAXS test, and PLQY characterization analysis), it can be found that Y6 and TPIIC have good compatibility, TPIIC exhibits a longer crystal coherence length, and the Y6:TPIIC acceptor mixture demonstrates higher fluorescence quantum yield, proving the formation of the alloy-like phase. This result matches well with the balanced degree of phase separation, stable molecular configuration, and larger enthalpy change energy characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S25†) of the ternary systems. It is demonstrated that the introduction of TPIIC into the PM6:Y6 host blend has significant benefits for the improvement of the energy disorder and its related operational stability.

Evolution of the DMT as a function of annealing temperature, illustrating a glass transition of (c) Y6 (100 ± 1 °C) and (d) Y6:TPIIC (110 ± 1 °C). 
To further deeply analyze the internal mechanism of the improvement of the stability of the ternary system and figure out the correlations between the Tg and stability issues in the binary and ternary blends, we monitored the change in physical properties of the corresponding films by temperature-variable absorption tests. As displayed in Fig. S26,† the absorption edges of the Y6 and Y6:TPIIC films gradually red-shift with increasing heating temperature. These changes are inseparably linked to the small changes in the aggregation properties of materials. When the overall absorption intensity changes significantly, it means that the inherent properties of the material have undergone a transition, the morphology and state have undergone glass transition, and the corresponding temperature is Tg. For a clearer quantitative analysis, we used a deviation metric (DMT), which represents the sum of squared deviations in absorbance between unannealed and annealed films:66–68  where λ, λmin and λmax are the wavelength, and the lower and upper bounds of the optical sweep, and IRT(λ) and IT(λ) are the normalized absorption intensities of unannealed and annealed films, respectively. Using two linear fits to the two branches, the transition of Y6 and Y6:TPIIC was determined to be 100 ± 1 °C and 110 ± 1 °C, respectively (Fig. 5c and d). This result indicates that with the introduction of TPIIC, the Tg of the original system could be increased, and therefore, its tolerance under complex external environmental stimuli has been enhanced. These results indicate that the introduction of TPIIC as the third component can simultaneously greatly improve the device efficiency and comprehensive stability of the PM6:Y6 system.
3. Conclusion
In a nutshell, we successfully designed and synthesized a mid-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor TPIIC, compared with Y6, which possesses a higher LUMO energy level, more efficient light absorption in the visible region, and stronger crystalline properties. By introducing it into the PM6:Y6 binary system as the third component, the PM6:Y6:TPIIC ternary device exhibited a superior photovoltaic function with a VOC of 0.861 V, a JSC of 27.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 74.4%, and a PCE of 17.7%. Note that all photovoltaic parameters were improved by this ternary strategy. In addition, in-depth testing studies have shown that the performance improvement of ternary devices is attributed to the extended carrier lifetime, the reduction of the defect state density, the escalation of the molecular π–π stacking orientation, and the reduction of Eloss, non-rad. In particular, compared with the binary films, the ternary films showed higher PLQY and smaller Urbach energy, which is responsible for their lower energy disorder. Of particular note is that relevant tests have proved that the Tg of the Y6:TPIIC blend film is increased compared with that of the Y6 film, and consequently, the photostability and thermal stability of the ternary system are improved significantly. This research proves the importance of combining molecular design engineering with the ternary strategy, which provides a smart idea for reducing the energy loss and improving the long-term stability of OSCs.
