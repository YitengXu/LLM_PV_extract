    , Accepted 8th December 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractIn organic solar cells (OSCs), non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are of great significance compared with the traditional fullerene-based acceptor molecules. Based on the milestone NFA Y6, five new A–D–A′–D–A type NFAs by substituting the S atoms of A′ and D units with Se atoms were designed and systematically simulated from the viewpoint of Quantum Chemical Calculations. The physical and optical properties of the newly designed Y6 series are predicted with reliable density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), the density of states (DOS), electrostatic potentials (ESP), electron mobility, and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of these Y6 derivatives are computed to comprehensively analyze their potential for OSCs performances. Besides, the polymer donor PM6 and the studied acceptors were specifically investigated. The results show that the Se-substituted molecules possess a lower band gap, exciton binding energy, reorganization energy values, and more red-shifted absorption than Y6. The molecule B4(Y-Se-Se-Se) has the most obvious redshift. In addition, the results of the hole–electron analysis showed that B3(Y-Se-S-Se) has a larger D index and a smaller Sr index, which will facilitate exciton separation and charge transfer. Furthermore, the lowest values of Ecoul and λe of A4 (Y-S-Se-Se) offer high current charge density along with good electron transport ability. This suggests that the determinant of excellent molecular performance is not a large number of Se substitutions. These results provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the effect of Se atom substitution on photovoltaic performance improvement and also provide a theoretical basis for the design and screening of novel acceptors.
Introduction
In recent years, OSCs have received extensive attention due to their low-cost, lightweight, simple fabrication process, and flexible preparation.1,2 The selection of superior active layer materials is of great significance for achieving high efficiencies OSCs.3,4 The active layer materials mainly include donor and acceptor materials. Although fullerene-based derivatives have been used as acceptors in early OSCs, their shortcomings such as insufficient absorption, thermal stability, poor photochemical, and fixed chemical structure are still difficult to improve.5 NFAs usually have the advantages of efficient absorption, adjustable energy levels, and easy synthesis.6 Recently, tremendous efforts have been contributed to designing and developing new NFAs, especially small molecular acceptors (SMAs).7 NFAs have been greatly developed with the continuous progress of materials engineering.8 Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFAs OSCs has reached more than 19% and may soon approach 20%.9 The energy levels of NFAs can be effectively tuned through chemical modification to form efficient complementary absorption with the donor and perform better charge separation.10
In 2015, Zhan and co-workers reported the star acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type acceptor ITIC and obtained a high PCE of 6.8%, which was a new record for NFA-based OSCs and open a new research era of A–D–A type fused-ring acceptors.11 In 2020, Zhang and coworkers synthesized three SMAs (SeCT-IC, CSeT-IC, and CTSe-IC) containing selenophene units at different positions, among which, the CTSe-IC-based OSC with selenophene units in the outermost position exhibited the highest PCE of 11.59%.12 Moreover, by introducing an electron-withdrawing benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole in the central D unit, Zou et al. reported a landmark acceptor Y6, which yielded a high OSC performance with PCE of 15.7%.13 Since the emergence of Y6, researchers have applied three strategies to further increase the PCE of Y6-based OSCs. The current strategies for regulating the chemical structure of Y6 mainly include the modification of the terminal end group, side chains, and central core.14–19 Yang's group designed a set of A–D–A′–D–A type acceptors by substituting S atoms of a D unit with Se atoms, and thanks to the properties of heteroatom vacant d-orbitals of Se, the newly designed acceptor Y6-Se possess suitable energy levels and improved light absorption quality.20 In 2022, Zhong et al. prepared ternary planar-mixed heterojunction OSCs based on a Se-substituted NFA acceptor with an incredible PCE of 19.03%.21 This suggests that appropriate Se atom substitution in different units is a promising method for optimizing the absorption and aggregation of NFAs and can improve the maximum theoretical efficiencies (MTE) in donor/acceptor performances. Therefore, it can be stated that selenization is a powerful modification strategy that has a positive effect on the long-term operational stability of bulk heterojunction OSC devices and can significantly extend the life of the device.22–24
Consequently, to deeply explore the prime cause of the influence of selenium atoms on the performance of acceptor materials and devices, five novel Y6-type SMAs were designed using the selenium-substitution strategy and systematically studied in this work. As shown in Fig. 1, the modified molecules are classified into phases A and B by the substitution of S atoms on the Y6 benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole unit, where the S atom on benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole is replaced by the Se atom in phase B. The phase A molecules are divided into the following four according to the Y and Z position elements: Y-S-S-S (Y6), Y-S-Se-S (Y6-2Se), Y-S-S-Se, and Y-S-Se-Se. At the same time, Y-Se-S-S (Y6-Se), Y-Se-Se-S, Y-Se-S-Se, and Y-Se-Se-Se belong to phase B. The PCEs of two different types of OSCs composed of PM6 and Y6 are both above 15%.25 This work demonstrates the composition–performance relationship of Y6-type SMAs. In addition, this research also provides a theoretical basis for the application of selenium-based derivatives in OSC active layer materials.

Calculational methods
The ground state geometry of Y6 and analogous was optimized using the B3LYP26 hybrid functional with the basis set 6-31G (d,p). To show the accurate molecular configuration and reduce the calculation errors, the alkyl side chains were completely maintained.27 The lowest energy conformer of Y6 and its derivatives were generated using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST, v 2.7.1)28 with the GFN2-xTB method. Considering the solvent effect on the properties of acceptors, an integral equation formalism variant polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) with chloroform as a solvent was applied in all calculations.29 The D3 version of Grimme's dispersion with Becke–Johnson damping was used for the DFT dispersion correction.30 Furthermore, the single point energy was calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP31 level. The TD-DFT32 method at the PBE033/def2-TZVP level was employed to calculate the properties of the excited states.34 Thus, in this work, ten single transition electron-excited states were used to investigate the excited state properties. Moreover, it should be noted that all the calculations were performed with the Guassian16 A 03.35 The optical properties and FMOs were studied using the Multiwfn 3.8 software,36 and the isosurface maps of ESP were visualized using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) 1.9.3.37
Calculation of UV-vis absorption spectrum
Initially, the maxima absorption peaks were calculated in chloroform solvent at five different functionals including B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP,38 M06-2X,39 PBE0, and ωB97XD40 with 6-31G (d,p) basis set of the density functional theory.41 The accuracy of double-hybrid functional in predicting the excited state properties of similar compounds is mostly higher than that of the hybrid functional.42 But the accuracy of various double-hybrid functionals is inconclusive, which is related to the molecular system.43 According to the reported results, the maximum ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption peak of Y6 in chloroform solvent is located at 731 nm.44 However, in practical calculations, most TD-DFT results have errors in the excitation energy, typically showing the average absolute error value in the range of 0.3–1.2 eV.45 Based on the optimized Y6 series molecules, the PBE0 functional calculated values of the absorption peaks of Y6 (as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1, ESI†) compare well with the experimental values.46
Computation of reorganization energy and hole–electron properties
It is well known that reorganization energy mainly consists of external reorganization energy and internal reorganization energy. The external reorganization energy is associated with the external sphere such as the selection of the medium or electron-transfer processes.47 While the internal reorganization energy is associated with the reorganization of geometric parameters.48 The internal reorganizational energies of electron (λe) and hole (λh) were only focused on and, thus calculated by using the following equations.49 λe = [E0− − E0] + [E−0 − E−],(1) λh = [E0+ − E0] + [E+0 − E+],(2)
Among them, E−0 and E+0 represent the energies of the neutral molecules at the anion and cation states, respectively; E+, E− indicates the energies of cations and anions, respectively, calculated via optimized geometry of cation and anion molecules. Whereas E0+ and E−0 are the energies of cations or anions with the optimized structure of neutral molecules. Finally, E0 is the energy of the neutral molecules at the ground state.
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the excited-state charge-transfer properties of NFAs, the hole–electron analysis was performed on the investigated molecules.50 (3) (4) tindex = Dindex − HCT(5)
The functions of Sm and Sr were integrated over the whole space, the larger the Sm and Sr indices, the higher the overlap of holes and electrons; the smaller the value, represents the more significant the separation of holes and electrons. The value indices are [0,1], 1 represents the perfect overlap of holes and electrons and 0 represents the holes and electrons without the slightest overlap. Dx = |Xele − Xhole|(6) Dy = |Yele − Yhole|(7) Dz = |Zele − Zhole|(8) (9)
The distance (D index) between the hole and the electron center of mass was measured using the above equation. Where Xhole is the x-coordinate center mass of the hole, which can be obtained by multiplying the ρhole function by the x-coordinate variable in the full space integral. The so-called center of mass indicates the most central and representative point of the overall distribution of the function. Hindex = (|σele| + |σhole|)/2(10) (11) (12)
The overall average distribution breadth (H) of the electrons and holes was calculated according to the above functions to investigate the degree of charge delocalization. Where, HDI and EDI represent the hole departure index and the electron departure index, respectively. When the value of HDI (EDI) is smaller, it means that the degree of the hole (electron) leaving the domain is higher, and the degree of uniformity of hole (charge) distribution is greater. (13)
Generally speaking, electrons are negatively charged, while electrons leave the place of holes, which are correspondingly positively charged. Therefore, the Coulomb attraction energy between electrons and holes, also known as exciton binding energy (Ecoul) can be calculated according to the Coulomb equation above.51
Results and discussion
The ground state geometry
Molecular geometry plays an important role in molecular packing, electron–hole mobility, and even solubility and device PCE.52 Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the geometric atomic number and dihedral angle markers for the optimized Y6 and its derivatives. The optimized ground state geometry and dihedral angle of Y6 and analogous are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. It revealed that the electron-withdrawing units at the molecular terminal are approximately coplanar with the intermediate fused cores and all of them possessed a “C-shaped” molecular configuration. The excellent planarity brings ordered molecular packing, high electron mobility, and favourable blend film morphology in OSCs. Besides, the substitution position and number of selenium atoms in Y series materials deliver a small effect on their planarity, which provided the prerequisite for obtaining excellent molecular packing and charge transport.

To gain insight into why the Y6 series has excellent OSCs performance, the non-covalent interactions within the receptor molecule were analyzed using molecular atom (AIM) theory.53 The Lagrangian kinetic energy (G(r)), energy density (E(r)), potential energy density (V(r)), electron density (ρ), and Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρ) at these three types of bond critical points (BCP) are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the BCP (3, −1) indicates significant bonding interactions between atoms, which can be found between H⋯π, S⋯O, Se⋯O, H⋯H in the Y6 series. It shows that there existed four kinds of intramolecular interactions. The results demonstrate that the strong non-covalent interaction between the atoms of Y6 series molecules is an important basis for maintaining planarity. In addition, the ρ value of BCP between Se and O in B4 is bigger than those in B3, which means that the rotational barrier at the central unit and the end unit of B4 has increased. In particular, molecules except for Y6, which are replaced by Se atoms forming Se⋯O non-covalent bonds have smaller dihedral angles than those forming S⋯O non-covalent bonds, meaning that B3, B4, A3, and A4 are slightly more planar than B1, B2, and A2. This facilitates charge transfer within the molecule.
Frontier molecular orbitals and density of states
The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy levels can determine the fundamental properties of acceptor materials, such as light absorption range, hole–electron separation, and open-circuit voltage (Voc).54 Therefore, studying the HOMO and LUMO energy levels will be beneficial to deeply understand the methods for achieving high-performance OSCs. Although the HOMO and LUMO energy levels estimated from DFT calculations are different from those obtained from experiments,55 the theoretical values can still serve as an important reference for the OSC research.56 The energy levels and frontier molecular orbitals of Phases A and B are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The isosurfaces of HOMO and LUMO and energy levels for phase A, (b) the isosurfaces of HOMO and LUMO and energy levels for phase B (isovalue = 0.015 a.u). 
The HOMOs are mainly distributed over the D–A′–D central core of Y6 series molecules whereas the LUMOs are widely distributed on the entire molecular except for alkyl chains. The higher the degree of delocalization of LUMO, the greater the possibility of intermolecular HOMO–LUMO overlap,57 which is more favourable for the charge transport. In the HOMO–LUMO transition, the charge is transferred from the central fused-ring core to the end group unit. It was observed that the band gap of the molecules replaced by Se atoms was decreased, and the band gaps of B2, B3, and B4 were lower than B1, which is attributed to an increase in the HOMO energy level. The band gap values of Y6, Y6-Se, and Y6-2Se calculated in chloroform solution were 1.989 eV, 1.969 eV, and 1.972 eV, respectively (Fig. 3). In the experiment, the band gap values of Y6, Y6-Se, and Y6-2Se were measured in the thin film state at 1.36 eV, 1.31 eV, and 1.34 eV, respectively.58 This indicates that the trend of the band gap calculation results is consistent with the experimental results and that the chosen calculation method is reliable. The increase in the number of Se atoms substitution has significantly increased the molecular band gap (Y6-2Se), which also shows that the number of Se atom substitutions is not the only factor affecting the band gap. In addition, the B series with benzoselethiazole exhibits a lower band gap than the A series under the same substitution position, which means that substituting the S atom in the critical position of benzothiadiazole will help generate widening and redshift absorption.
By using the total density of states (TDOS) and partial DOS (PDOS) were adopted to profoundly study the molecular orbital contributions in the Multiwfn package.59 The PDOS was used to quantitatively analyze the contribution of each atom or fragment to the HOMO and LUMO.60 As shown in Fig. 4, the Y6-type acceptor can be divided into three fragments: electron-withdrawing end group, donor core, and central acceptor units. Meanwhile, the HOMOs and LUMOs of studied acceptors are mainly distributed in the donor cores and end units, respectively, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The HOMOs and LUMOs of molecules are mainly contributed by the central fused ring core and end group unit, respectively. As well as, the DOS distribution of molecules that introduce Se atoms is more uniform than Y6.

Electronic absorption spectra
The photon harvest efficiency depends on the absorption response range, so a broader absorption spectrum means the potential of higher PCE could be achieved.61 Several important optoelectronic characteristic parameters, such as the main transition contributions of molecular orbitals, transition energies, oscillator strengths, and maximum absorption wavelengths were calculated and are summarized in Table 2. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the Y6 series molecules are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the two characteristic absorption peaks of the studied acceptor molecules are located at 400–600 nm and 600–800 nm, respectively. As listed in Table 2, the maximum absorption peaks of other molecules in phase A and phase B have a significant redshift (10–40 nm) compared to those in Y6. Additionally, phase B exhibits a more pronounced redshift (about 10 nm) than phase A, this suggests that substituting the S atom at the benzothiadiazole position will help generate enhanced redshift absorption.

Molecular surface electrostatic potentials
Electrostatic potentials (ESPs) were further used to display the 3D charge distributions and all the spatial positions of the electron-deficient and electron-rich studied NFAs.24 The ESP distribution on the donor core of NFAs gradually changed from red to white and blue, indicating that the ESP value changed from positive to negative due to the stronger ICT caused by the selenium substitution.62Fig. 5 shows the isosurface plots of ESP (isosurface = 0.001 a.u.) and quantitative information on ESP values. Generally, the negative ESP will appear near the lone pair electrons or p-orbital electron clouds of highly electronegative atoms in the molecules.63 Understanding the regional distribution corresponding to a specific interval of ESP is of great significance for investigating electrostatic interactions between molecules and predicting molecular properties.64 The positive regions in the subfigure of Fig. 5 and ESP close to 0 make up most of the molecular surface, whereas ESP also has many small areas that are very negative. For example, around cyano nitrogen atoms, and this is mainly due to the electronegativity of nitrogen, caused by the triple bond binding of carbon and nitrogen atoms in cyano. The surface area distribution of each molecule in different ESP intervals is relatively uniform. The histogram in Fig. 5 also shows that the positive area of the molecular surface and the electrostatic potential is close to 0 and accounts for most of it. But there are also areas where the electrostatic potential is very negative, which is mainly caused by the apparent negative charge of nitrogen atoms. Importantly, because selenium atoms have lower electronegativity than sulfur atoms, the average ESP value of the Se position in series B benzoselenadiazole is about 3 kcal mol−1 larger than the benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole S position in series A (Fig. S6, ESI†). This can also be seen in the electrostatic potential distribution plot in Fig. 5, the ESP coloration at the Se position in the B series benzoselenadiazole is more intense. The averaged ESP values of the atoms in all molecules are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the quantitative information of surface ESP distributions on Y6 series molecules is extracted. For the terminal acceptor units (atoms 42–59), the minimum ESP value appears near the nitrogen atoms of ITIC (atom 59), while the maximum ESP value is displayed near the nitrogen atoms of pyrrole (atoms 25 and 35). As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the molecular polarity index (MPI) of the modified molecules is similar, which indicates that the distribution of charges on the surface is uniform.

Electron–hole characters
Organic semiconductors can generate electron–hole pairs (excitons) when irradiated under sunlight, which transfer from the ground state to the excited state.65 According to the corresponding relationship between the S0–S1 transition and the maximum absorption peaks, it was selected to study the electronic excitation characteristics.66 After further analysis, three fragments of Y6 series molecules were defined. Electron (green) and hole (blue) distributions of Y6 series molecules are shown in Fig. 6(a). The holes are chiefly localized on fragments 1 and 2, while the electrons are delocalized over the entire molecules except for the side chain. Especially the S in the outer thiophene of A1, A2, B1, and B2 have electron–hole reorganization distribution, while the Se atom in the outer thiophene unit of A3, A4, B3, and B4 with the Se atom in the outer thiophene unit has enhanced hole distribution. Hence, the improvement of the hole delocalization range of the S0–S1 transition is attributed to the introduction of the Se atom. In order to analyze the relative positions and centroid distance (D index) of the hole and electron distributions, the smooth descriptions of holes and electrons of Y6 series molecules are listed in Fig. 6(b). D index indicates the distance between the electron and the hole, in general, the larger the distance, the higher degree of exciton separation in the charge transfer (CT) state direction.67 According to the D values in Table 4, the centroid distances between the holes and the electrons of A2 and B3 are the two largest. The molecules were divided into fragments 1, 2, and 3 (As shown in Fig. S7, ESI†) to analyze the contributions from fragments to holes and electrons. Fragments 1 and 2 are two end groups (A) and two donor units (D), respectively. The acceptor center core (A′) is fragment 3. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the electrons and holes of each molecule overlap greatly on fragment 3, which is consistent with the results of hole–electron distribution. In addition, the color of the holes in the A and B series of fragment 2 gradually becomes darker with the substitution of Se atoms, which means that the number of charges leaving the position of Se atoms increases. This corresponds to the increase of holes, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The Sr index indicating the difficulty of separation of holes and electrons is also listed in Table 3.68 Apparently, Sr values of all selenium-substituted molecules are increased to varying degrees, but the Sr value of B3 is the same as that of Y6, which is the smallest. The EDI value is inversely proportional to the delocalization degree and distribution uniformity of electrons. The smaller the value, the greater the delocalization degree and distribution uniformity of electrons. It is seen from Table S4 (ESI†) that the percentage of charge transfer for different fragments within the A and B series of molecules is (2 → 1) > (3 → 1) > (3 → 2). In addition, Ecoul is also used to study the degree of separation of holes and electrons. A3, A4, B3, and B4 have lower Ecoul and EDI compared to Y6, which is due to the selenium substitution of the outer thiophene unit that may have potential electronic communication with the terminal group (e.g., non-covalent interactions between Se and O) and give rise to compact intermolecular packing.

Electron affinities, ionization potentials, reorganization energy and open circuit voltage
The ionization potentials (IPs) and Electron affinities (EAs) can be employed to quantify the difficulties of molecular ionization and hole–electron binding in OSCs, respectively.69 The IP and EA can be expressed by the following equation, IP = [E+0 − E0], EA = [E0 − E−0]. Higher IP values indicate the stability of the HOMO energy level, and molecules with higher EA values facilitate accelerated intramolecular charge transfer.70 Compared with Y6 in Phase A, A4 has lower IPs. Furthermore, EA decreases as the number of central core selenium atom substitutions increases. λe and λh are the crucial parameters for estimating acceptor molecule electron and hole transport characteristics.71 Generally, smaller λe and λh values for SMA indicate excellent mobility and intramolecular electron and hole transfer properties. As observed in Table 4, both λe and λh of the molecules after selenium substitution showed a decreasing trend. In particular, the number of selenium atom substitutions is negatively proportional to λe and λh. A2 and B2 have a lower λe and λh compared to A1 and B1, which is mainly attributed to the selenium substitution of the inner thiophene unit may have potential electronic communication with the alkyl chain (e.g., non-covalent interactions between Se and H) and give rise to compact intermolecular packing.

The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of materials is considered one of the most crucial factors to determine the efficiency of solar cell devices,72 where Voc values can be calculated by using the following formula:73 (14)
The Voc can be estimated by the difference values between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy of the acceptor molecule. PM6 is the most widely used polymer molecule during device fabrication and optimization, which deserves the HOMO energy level of −5.56 eV and LUMO energy level of −3.50 eV.52 As shown in Table 4, the LUMO energy of the acceptor molecule is proportional to Voc. After comparison of A3, A4, B3, and B4, it is found that the substitution of inner thiophene in the central fused ring core leads to a slight increase in Voc, which is likely to promote the Voc and help to improve the PCEs of OSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, the association mechanism between the structure and performance of five selenium-substituted NFAs derived from Y6 was investigated by DFT and TD-DFT. When Se is located at the outer thiophene, the non-covalent bond between selenophene and the terminal acceptor unit (Se⋯O) would form the ‘conformational lock’, which would be conducive to establishing a better coplanar molecular conformation. The modified molecular band gap change trend is consistent with the experimental values. All Se atom-substituted molecules have smaller band gaps than Y6 because of the relative downward shift of the LUMO energy level and the apparent redshift absorption spectrum. The molecule B4(Y-Se-Se-Se) where Se is substituted both in the central core S positions has the most obvious red-shifted absorption range. In addition, ESP analysis showed that when the selenium atom replaced the sulfur atom in benzothiadiazole, the ESP value of the Se position in the phase B molecule was larger. Moreover, electron–hole characteristics indicate that the selenium substitution of the outer thiophene unit makes more electrons leave the central core unit, which in turn forms a wider range of holes, thus inducing stronger ICT characteristics. All molecules after Se substitution have lower exciton binding energy (Ecoul) than Y6, which is beneficial to improving high charge density and good ability of electron transfer. Furthermore, the substitution of internal thiophene in the central fused ring core is conducive to the increase of Voc. Consequently, this suggests that the determinants of excellent molecular properties are determined by a combination of numerous factors rather than simply a large number of Se atom substitutions. This work highlights the characteristic parameters and excited state properties of selenium-substituted Y6-type molecules, which provides a theoretical basis for the prediction and screening of efficient acceptors from the point of view of theoretical calculations. More importantly, this work provides a reference for an in-depth understanding of the excited state charge transfer, which is of great significance for designing more efficient OSCs materials in the future.
