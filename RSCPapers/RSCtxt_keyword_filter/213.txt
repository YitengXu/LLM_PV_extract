    , Accepted 31st January 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractSnO2 as an ideal electron transfer material for planar halide perovskite solar cells has recently attracted much attention. However, the planar structure device shows significant hysteresis behavior and low optical stability due to numerous trap states and high UV transmittance. Here, carbon nanodots (CNDs) obtained by hydrothermal synthesis were firstly introduced into SnO2 ETLs through a simple solution process. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, electronic impedance spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to investigate whether the introduction of CNDs increases the electronic coupling as well as energy levers which contribute to efficient electron extraction. The results showed that the introduction of CNDs could reduce the trap-state density and increase the mobility in SnO2 films. Finally, the device based on the SnO2:CNDs ETLs reached a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20% and steady-state PCE of 19.83% with negligible hysteresis. The SnO2:CNDs device retained over 90% of the initial PCE after storage in dry conditions for 1200 h and exhibited better UV stability after exposure to UV illumination. These results verify the simple method for producing highly efficient and UV stable perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy has become an important green resource for human beings with the development of industrial technology. Photovoltaic (PV) cells have been used to convert solar energy into electricity.1 As the third generation of PV cells, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) such as MAPbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 have been well on their way to high performance since their first introduction in 2012.2 During the past few years, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8% (ref. 3) to over 23%.4,5 Mesoporous-structure PSCs have been commonly used to achieve the high PCE because of the good contact between the perovskite layer and electron transfer layers (ETLs).6 However, the high sintering temperature (>450 °C) and unsatisfactory UV stability has limited their application in flexible and tandem high-efficiency devices.7 Developing planar perovskite solar cells with a low temperature process was an effective way to solve these problems. SnO2, ZnO and some other metal oxides, sulfides and selenides have been investigated as electron transfer materials in planar PSCs.8,9 To date, the certified record PCE of planar-structure PSCs based on SnO2 has been 21.52%.10
SnO2 has a number of advantages for its application in planar PSCs due to its suitable energy level, high electron mobility (240 cm2 V−1 s−1), high conductivity, desirable band-gap (3.6–4.0 eV), low fabrication temperature and excellent chemical stability.11,12 These advantages are helpful for the stability and performance of the device with low-temperature SnO2 ETL. Several methods have been used to prepare SnO2 thin films, such as spin-coating processes,13,14 chemical bath deposition,15 magnetron sputtering,16 hydrothermal methods17 and atomic layer deposition,18 however, further commercialisation of such devices may be limited by the hysteresis and stability based on these methods. Therefore, much effort has been directed towards improving the photoelectricity properties of SnO2. Park et al. employed a zwitterion-modified SnO2 electron transport layer to cause shifts in the work function and obtain a device with a high PCE and excellent thermal stability.19 Liu et al. used an EDTA complexed SnO2 electron-transport layer to obtain the record PCE of the planar-type PSCs (certified at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis and long-term stability.10 Grätzel et al. introduced F into the SnO2 nanocrystal to reduce the band offset resulting in a high Voc of 1.13 V and a PCE of 20.3%.20 Yang et al. added graphene quantum dots into SnO2 to effectively fill the electron traps in SnO2 and reach an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2 ± 1.0% with very little hysteresis.21 Some metal ions were also incorporated into SnO2 to enhance the performance and reduce the hysteresis, such as Li, Y, Sb, Eu, Al, Mg, Ga and Nb.11,22,23
Recently, the carbon nano-material family including graphene, carbon nanotube and polymer et al. have inspired much research effort.24 CNDs as one of the carbon nano-material family have been widely investigated in different fields, such as light-emitting diodes,25 perovskite solar cells26 and dye-sensitized solar cells,27 many unique properties such as absorbance and luminescence properties, and energy and charge transfer, were found in the CNDs due to the functional groups.24 Here, for the first time, carbon nanodots (CNDs) were introduced into a SnO2 colloid precursor to form a homogeneous CNDs/SnO2 nanocolloid. SnO2:CNDs ETL with a suitable conduction band, low defect states and high electron mobility were prepared by spin-coating the CNDs/SnO2 nanocolloid. The PSCs based on SnO2:CNDs ETL showed efficiency over 20% and steady-state PCE of 19.83% nearly free of hysteresis. Furthermore, the SnO2:CNDs device kept about 90% of the initial PCE under UV illumination for 200 h.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (180 nm) with a sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1 were purchased from Huayulianhe Co., Ltd. SnO2 colloid precursor [Sn(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion], anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and chlorobenzene were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide, CsI, PbI2 and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Co., Ltd. Glucose, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tertbutylpyridine (TBP) were obtained from Aldrich. All of these commercially available materials were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Preparation of CNDs
The CNDs were synthesized by the hydrothermal process. The glucose was firstly dispersed in deionized water and stirred at 60 °C for 15 min. After it was dissolved, the solution was immediately poured into a 100 mL Teflon lined stainless autoclave, which was then heated in an oven at 180 °C for 180 min. Then, the autoclave was removed to cool freely. The final brown product was transferred into centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate out the precipitate. The pale yellow liquid obtained finally was a solution of carbon nanodots (CNDs); the CNDs were obtained by drying the solution.
2.3 Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned with alkaline detergent, acetone, absolute ethanol, deionized water for 15 minutes, respectively, and then dried with a nitrogen flow and further cleaned by UV-ozone for 10 min before being used for spin-coating. The SnO2 colloid precursor was ultrasonically diluted by deionized water (1:5 volume ratio) for 60 min. The SnO2:CNDs solution was prepared by adding the CNDs into the SnO2 colloid precursor at various concentrations. The acquired SnO2 solution was spin-coated onto the glass/ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min. Perovskite precursor solution containing FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v) was filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter to obtain a clear solution. CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) was added to the mixed perovskite precursor to achieve the desired triple cation composition. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s and 0.1 mL of antisolvent (CB) was dripped on the rotating substrate at 10 s after the spin procedure starting. The film was heated at 150 °C for 30 min to obtain the perovskite film. To obtain the HTM solution, 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 mL of CB with additives of 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in ACN) and 28.8 μL of TBP, the spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of gold metal was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact.
2.4 Characterization
The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images were obtained on a ZEISS SUPRA55, Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Thermo-NS7, manufacturer) was used to determine the elemental distribution. TEM images were taken on a JEM 1200EX transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a SmartLab from Rigaku at 40 kV and 150 mA by using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). AFM images were measured with a 300HV scanning force microscope (SEIKO). The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under one-sun AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol3A Class A, 64023A Simulator). I–V was conducted by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d), EIS measurements were conducted by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d) (0.1 MHz to 100 Hz) with the A.C. impedance mode and the fitting software was Zview. The UV-vis light absorption measurement was performed by an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis-IR) spectrophotometer (Lambda 950). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained on a Keithley 2000 multimeter as a function of the wavelength from 350 to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The UPS spectra were analyzed using a photoelectron spectrometer (AC-2, Riken Keiki). Hall measurements were carried out with a Lake Shore 7500/9500 Series Hall Effect/Electronic Transport Measurement System in a four-point configuration measuring an area of 0.1 cm2. The active area of the cell is 0.1 cm2. Up-conversion fluorescence, steady-state photoluminescence (PL), and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured with a FLS 980 E fluorometer (Edinburgh Photonics) excited at 532 nm.
3. Results and discussion
The carbon nanodots (CNDs) were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method using glucose. All the preparation details have been listed in the Experimental section. Fig. 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph of the dispersed CNDs with a diameter of 15–20 nm (Fig. 1b). The high-resolution TEM image of the SnO2 particles is given in Fig. S1,† it shows that the SnO2 particles are highly crystallized with particle sizes around 5 nm, this result agrees well with ref. 14.

The functional groups are a significant feature for the CNDs, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra is shown in Fig. 1c to represent the functional groups. The peaks at around 2917 and 1660 cm−1 correspond to the C–H and CC stretch, respectively, of the carbon skeleton in CNPs,28 the peaks at 3410, 1710 and 1084 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H, CO and C–O, indicating the existence of residual hydroxyl groups,29 the dispersion and stability properties of the CNDs in aqueous solution could be improved with the surface hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of CNPs is shown in Fig. 1d, the two absorption peaks could be observed in the spectrum, the weak peak is located in the region of about 210 nm because of the π–π* transition,30 the characteristic peak at about 290 nm is assigned to the n–π* transition due to the polyaromatic structure in CNDs.31 In the inset of Fig. 1d, the photograph of the water solution of CNDs shows the excellent water solubility with a yellowish brown color.
Fig. S2† displays the XRD patterns of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs, it shows that the tetragonal phase (space group P42/mnm, a = 0.4738 and c = 0.3187 nm) is retained in both of the samples irrespective of the introduction of CNDs. The diffraction peaks of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs at 2θ = 26.8°, 34.2°, 38.2°, 51.7° and 65.6° correspond to SnO2 (110), (101), (200), (211) and (301) planes (JCPDS 41-1445), indicating the formation of SnO2. Furthermore, the results of the XRD patterns illustrate that the introduction of CNDs has no obvious effects on the crystallinity and phase transition of SnO2.
Fig. S3† shows the XPS spectrum confirming the existence and chemical state of elements in SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films. In Fig. S3a,† the sample with the incorporation of CNDs shows four peaks at 284.78, 285.68, 286.28 and 288.68 eV that are attributed to C–C/CC, C–H, C–O and CO, respectively. However, only one peak at 284.78 eV was observed in the SnO2 film because of the carbon contamination at the surface of the material.26 The additional peaks of C–H, C–O and CO are observed in the SnO2:CNDs sample, illustrating the presence of CNDs in SnO2:CNDs film, the results are in accordance with the IR spectra in Fig. 1c. The O 1s spectra of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs are shown in Fig. S3b,† the two significant peaks at 530.28 and 531.38 eV can be found in the SnO2 sample, the strong O 1s binding energy is presented at 530.38 and 531.48 eV in the SnO2:CNDs sample, the weak peaks at 531.28, 532.50 and 533.50 eV are also observed, indicating the presence of CO, C–O and O–H.32 In Fig. S3c,† the position of Sn 3d peaks at 486.48 and 494.88 eV shows no change for the SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs samples, it demonstrates that the CNDs are introduced as a mixture into the SnO2 nanocolloid.33
The structure of the SnO2:CNDs device is shown in Fig. 2a, including ITO/SnO2:CNDs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis-IR absorption spectra of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films. The photograph of the water solution of SnO2 (left) and SnO2:CNDs (right) is shown in the inset, it shows that the CNDs disperse well in the SnO2 nanocolloid. The absorbance of SnO2 film in the UV region becomes greater with the introduction of CNDs to protect the perovskite layer from UV radiation, the visible light can be absorbed sufficiently by the perovskite layer because of the low absorbance in the range of 400–800 nm. The band gaps of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films have been calculated by the Tauc plot, the results are shown in Fig. 2d, the band gap of SnO2:CNDs is 3.71 eV, which is lower than that of the SnO2 because of the low band gap of CNDs.21 Furthermore, we observed that the absorbance of SnO2:CNDs film is higher than that of the SnO2 film in the infrared region (800–1200 nm), it may be due to the unique up-conversion property of CNDs,34 we used the up-conversion luminescence spectrum to verify the up-conversion ability of SnO2:CNDs films with various amounts of CNDs (excitation source: 980 nm), the results are shown in Fig. S4.† The peaks at 525 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm could be observed for the SnO2:CNDs film, while no significant peaks could be found for the SnO2 film, it indicates that the IR light can be absorbed by the SnO2:CNDs film and converted into visible light, some viewpoints were presented to illustrate the up-conversion property of CNDs, such as the multiphoton active process35 and the anti-Stokes transition process,34 this property could extend the absorption scope of the PSCs and enhance the performance of the device. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite film is also shown in Fig. S5,† CNDs have no effects on the absorbance in the visible region for the perovskite layers.

(f) The secondary electron cutoff (SEC) edge. 
To explain the influence of the CNDs on the surface energy levels of the SnO2 film, the SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs were analysed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The secondary electron cutoff (SEC) edge and the valence band (VB) spectra are shown in Fig. 2e and f. The work function (WF) of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs are −4.48 eV and −4.24 eV, the valence bands are −7.68 eV and −7.82 eV and the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs are −3.93 eV and −4.11 eV, as obtained from CB = WF + VB − Eg (Eg is the band gap of the corresponding film),14 a deeper CB of the SnO2:CNDs would increase the driving force for electron injection from the CB of perovskite to the SnO2, which is beneficial for the enhancement of Voc. The energy band diagram summarized from the UPS results is shown in Fig. 2b. The Fermi level of the SnO2 film decreased with the introduction of CNDs. According to the Boltzmann relation:14 (1)n is the electron number, NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band, EF and EC is the conduction-band energy level and Fermi level, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The Fermi level of SnO2:CNDs is closer to the CB, it demonstrates that the electron concentration is increased with the introduction of CNDs.36
The top-view SEM images of (a) SnO2 and (b) SnO2:14CNDs are shown in Fig. 3a and b, the top-view SEM images of modified SnO2 doped with different amounts of CNDs are shown in Fig. S6.† The morphologies of SnO2 and SnO2:14CNDs films are almost the same, the films are both smooth, compact and pinhole-free, which is suitable for the fabrication of high performance PSCs. However, the additional white particles ascribed to aggregation of excess CNDs are observed in Fig. S6c and d,† the aggregation of CNDs on the surface of the ETLs may result in a bad contact between the perovskite layer and ETLs. Fig. S7† shows the AFM images of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs, the RMS roughness (RRMS) of the films increases from 1.16 nm (SnO2 film) to 1.53 nm (SnO2:CNDs film). No obvious change of RRMS is observed in SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films. In order to check whether the CNDs are uniformly introduced into the SnO2 film, Fig. S8† shows the elemental distribution of SnO2:CNDs, Sn and O elements occupy the large field of the SnO2:CNDs. The lesser amount of C disperses uniformly without aggregation. The SEM images of the perovskite deposited on SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films are also measured in Fig. 3c and d, the perovskite layer is uniform and of high quality, the introduction of CNDs has no effect on the growth of the perovskite layer. The cross-section image of the SnO2:CNDs device is shown in Fig. 3e, the structure of the device is ITO/SnO2:CNDs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, each layer can be distinguished easily. The thickness of the perovskite layer is about 350 nm, which is highly suitable for PCE devices.

To better characterize the influence of CNDs on the properties of SnO2 film, the I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4a, the sandwich structures ITO/SnO2:CNDs/Au and ITO/SnO2/Au were used to measure the conductivity of SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films. The enhancement of the current in the SnO2:CNDs film can be observed. The direct current conductivity (σ0) can be calculated from the formula I = σ0Ad−1V, where d is the thickness of the films and A is the area of the film,37 the conductivity σ0 of SnO2:CNDs exhibits an increase from 0.097 mS cm−1 to 0.136 mS cm−1 with the introduction of CNDs. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement of the electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2 (or SnO2:CNDs)/PCBM/Au were also used to understand the mechanism of conductivity enhancement. As shown in Fig. 4b, the linear J–V relation at the low bias indicates a linear relation of ohmic response. This linear relation terminates in a steeply rising current due to the trap filling as the voltage continuously increases.38 The trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) of 0.98 V for SnO2 and 0.44 V for SnO2:CNDs can be estimated and the trap state density (ntrap) can be calculated according to the formula: (2)where ε is the relative dielectric constant of SnO2 (ε = 12.5), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ntrap is the trap-state density and L is the thickness of SnO2 or SnO2:CNDs films.10,19 The calculated results show that the ntrap of SnO2:CNDs (2.42 × 1015 cm−3) is lower than that of the SnO2 (5.39 × 1015 cm−3).

(f) Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite layers contacted with different substrates: glass, SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs. 

Fig. 4c shows the Hall effect measurement results of the SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs films, the carrier concentration and mobility are measured using the four-point probe hall effect measurement method. With the introduction of 14 mg CNDs, the carrier concentration is improved from 7.09 × 1014 cm−3 to 2.86 × 1015 cm−3 for about one order of magnitude and the mobility is increased from 120.32 cm3 V−1 s−1 to 228.54 cm3 V−1 s−1, it demonstrates that the SnO2:CNDs ETLs are suitable for high performance and negligible hysteresis PSCs. No obvious change is observed in the carrier concentration with excess CNDs, however, the mobility and conductivity properties of SnO2:CNDs would decrease because of the aggregation of excess CNDs. This result verifies the improvement of conductivity and trap-state density shown in Fig. 4a and b.
The interfacial properties between the ETL and the perovskite were investigated by Mott–Schottky analysis at 1 kHz of ITO/ETL/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and the results are shown in Fig. 4e. The Vbi value of the SnO2:CNDs device is 0.90 V, which is about 0.04 V higher than that of the SnO2 device, the difference is ascribed to charge diffusion motion induced by carrier concentration differences. Furthermore, the doping density was calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation,39 the values are summarised in Table S1,† the result shows that with the incorporation of CNDs, the doping density increased from 7.37 × 1018 cm−3 (SnO2 device) to 8.51 × 1018 cm−3 (SnO2:CNDs device), indicating that the CNDs-doping could enhance the charge extraction ability and suppress recombination.19
Furthermore, the PL was analyzed to measure the carrier transfer from the perovskite layer to the ETLs. The results are shown in Fig. 4d. The perovskite film deposited on SnO2:CNDs centered at 784 nm shows significant PL quenching, compared to the SnO2 films. It indicates that the conductivity is improved and the trap-state density is decreased with the introduction of CNDs. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra was also measured to further confirm efficient charge transfer between perovskite and the ETL, the results are presented in Fig. 4f, the carrier lifetime values based on fitting with a biexponential decay function40 are determined to be 6813 ns, 602 ns and 236 ns for perovskite layers contacted with different substrates: glass, SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs, respectively. It indicates that photoexcited carriers can be extracted quickly and thus effectively suppress carrier recombination by SnO2:CNDs as ETL.
A schematic of the electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the SnO2:CNDs is shown in Fig. 5a. The electrons could be transferred quickly with the help of CNDs in the electron transfer layer because of the reduction of defects and resistivity in the SnO2:CNDs ETL and the interaction between CNDs and FA or MA cations in the perovskite layer.28,41 In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the device with SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs ETLs, the current density–voltage curves of the device based on the SnO2 ETLs with different amounts of CNDs is shown in Fig. S9,† the parameters are summarized in Table S2.† The device with the SnO2:14CNDs exhibits the highest PCE of 20.03% with the highest Jsc of 23.14 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.10 V and FF of 0.79, while the device with the SnO2 exhibits the PCE of 18.54% with the Jsc of 22.51 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.08 V and FF of 0.76. However, the PCE of the device would decrease because of the decreased mobility and carrier concentration, the PCE of the SnO2: 21CNDs device decreases to 16.67% with the Jsc of only 21.38 mA cm−2.

The inset shows the structure of the device, fabricated with the ITO/SnO2:CNDs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure. The SnO2:CNDs device obtained a high PCE of 20.03% in the reverse J–V curve and 19.13% in the forward J–V curve while the SnO2 device only obtained a PCE of 18.54% in the reverse J–V curve and 17.09% in the forward J–V curve. The hysteresis index [h = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse] was used to investigate hysteresis behavior in the device,42 the SnO2:CNDs exhibits a smaller hysteresis index of 1.5%, compared with the index of 5.8% for SnO2 device. The results demonstrate that the performance and hysteresis behavior of the device could be improved markedly by the SnO2:CNDs ETLs. Furthermore, all the parameters increased significantly with the introduction of CNDs, especially Jsc, because of the improvement of the properties of ETLs.

Fig. 5e shows the steady-state power output measured at the maximum power, the PCEs of the devices based on the SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs could be stabilized at 19.83% and 18.12% with current densities of 21.09 and 20.13 mA cm−2. The photocurrent response ability of the SnO2:CNDs device is better than that of the SnO2 device, the maximum photocurrent in the SnO2:CNDs device could be obtained immediately under the illumination, while the maximum photocurrent in the SnO2 device was derived more slowly.

I–V characteristics measured under different light intensity from 34 to 100 mW cm−2 were utilized to further understand the charge recombination and photovoltaic performance, the results are shown in Fig. S10.† In Fig. S10a,† both of the devices show a linear correlation with the slopes towards 1, suggesting that the effect of bimolecular recombination at the interface is negligible under short circuit conditions.10,43 In addition, the light intensity dependence of Voc was also obtained to investigate the recombination processes under open circuit conditions, as shown in Fig. S10b,† a slope of 1.12kT/q was estimated for the SnO2:CNDs device, which is lower than that of the SnO2 device (1.28kT/q), indicating no significant trap-assisted recombination.19,44
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) along the entire range of wavelengths from 350 to 800 nm is shown in Fig. S11.† The EQE spectra covered the entire visible range from 350 to 800 nm with values over 80% for both devices with the SnO2:CNDs device showing the higher EQE in the range from 400 to 750 nm. The higher EQE for SnO2:CNDs is attributed to the enhanced charge collected and transferred with the introduction of CNDs. In addition, the current density calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra was 22.27 mA cm−2 and 21.36 mA cm−2, which are in accordance with the results from J–V curves within the error range.
The Nyquist plot of the cells based on SnO2 and SnO2:CNDs is presented in Fig. S12† to measure the transfer resistance in the cells, the equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. S12.† Two separate semicircles in the measured frequency range could be observed, the low-frequency component is related to the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the high-frequency component is the transfer resistance (Rtr).45 The SnO2 device shows the Rtr of 25.1 Ω and the Rrec of 191.2 Ω, while the SnO2:CNDs device shows the smallest Rtr of 24.5 Ω and the largest Rrec of 112.2 Ω. It illustrates that the electrons could be extracted and transferred efficiently and the charge recombination could be reduced in the SnO2:CNDs device. The PCE histogram of the devices along with the Gaussian fitting is shown in Fig. 5f. The average PCE shows a significant improvement from 18.05% (SnO2) to 19.50% (SnO2:CNDs), indicating that the CNDs is suitable for use as an additive in electron transfer materials.
Although the PCE has progressed rapidly in recent years, the stability remains a challenging issue for the perovskite devices. As displayed in Fig. 2a, we observe that the absorbance of SnO2:CNDs films increase in the UV region, especially in the 250 nm to 350 nm range, the device with the SnO2:CNDs may exhibit super UV stability. The results of UV stability measurements (under 311 nm UV illumination) are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen, that the UV stability of the devices could be improved with the introduction of CNDs into the SnO2 ETLs in an ambient atmosphere (20 °C, 20–30% humidity). The parameters of the SnO2 device decreased clearly, compared with the SnO2:CNDs device, especially the Jsc and Voc, which is ascribed to the decomposition of the perovskite layer by UV illumination. The normalized efficiency of the SnO2:CNDs device remains at approximately 90% with UV illumination for 200 h, while the normalized PCE of the SnO2 device decreases to only 20%, such superb UV stability could be attributed to the high absorbance of SnO2:CNDs ETLs in the UV region. The photographs of the SnO2 device and SnO2:CNDs device are also shown to verify the results in Fig. S13,† the Au electrode in the SnO2 device can be observed clearly after 200 h UV illumination, compared with the SnO2:CNDs device. The degradation of the SnO2 device under 311 nm UV spectra has also been investigated before.46 Finally, the long-term stability was also tested by storage in dry conditions for 1200 h, as displayed in Fig. S14,† the results show that the PCE of the SnO2:CNDs device retains over 90% of the initial PCE. The SnO2:CNDs device exhibits excellent UV and long-term stability against UV illumination and air conditions.

4. Conclusion
In summary, for the first time, carbon nanodots (CNDs) were introduced into a SnO2 colloid precursor to form a homogeneous CNDs/SnO2 nanocolloid. The SnO2:CNDs ETL was prepared for planar PSCs, which achieved a PCE of over 20% with negligible hysteresis. The band gap of the SnO2 films was changed from 3.75 eV to 3.71 eV with the introduction of CNDs. The absorption spectra, conduction band and work function were also measured by UV-vis-IR spectra and UPS. Furthermore, the introduction of CNDs could reduce the trap-state density and increase the mobility in the SnO2 film, which is suitable for a high performance and hysteresis-free device. Finally, a high PCE of the SnO2:CNDs device was obtained because of the improvement of charge concentration and mobility in the SnO2:CNDs film. The SnO2:CNDs device exhibits better stability and reproducibility, compared with the SnO2 device, especially the UV stability, the SnO2:CNDs device kept over 90% of the initial PCE after storing in dry conditions for 1200 h and exhibited better UV stability by exposing the device to UV illumination.
