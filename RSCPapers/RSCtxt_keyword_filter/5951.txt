    , Accepted 3rd July 2017First published on 5th July 2017AbstractThe control of the molecular energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is crucial to the design of highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). In particular, the fine control of the HOMO energy level is vital because it can ensure that polymer solar cell devices have a high open circuit voltage (Voc) and a high short circuit current density (Jsc). We systematically synthesized a series of polymers substituted with different numbers of fluorine (F) atoms in conjugated side chains to fine-tune the HOMO energy levels of the donor polymer, and then optimized the associated solar cell devices by varying the length of the alkyl chain in the conjugated side chains. A series of conjugated side chains with non-fluorinated (0F), mono-fluorinated (1F), and di-fluorinated (2F) alkoxyphenyl groups at the meta position were synthesized and introduced into the donor polymer. The strong electron-withdrawing properties of fluorine were found to reduce the HOMO energy level and yield high Voc values up to 1.01 V. The substitution of the conjugated side chain with fluorine affects not only the energy level of the polymer but also its intermolecular packing and crystallinity due to the resulting intermolecular interactions, and was found to be effective in the control of Jsc and FF. A maximum efficiency of 7.64% was achieved for the polymer with the mono-fluorinated conjugated side chain.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention recently as promising candidates for energy devices that are lightweight and flexible as well as have a large area.1,2 Solar cell devices based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), which consist of a conjugated polymer as the donor material and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor material, are highly efficient.3–5 The design of conjugated polymers with the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach has resulted in the development of highly efficient PSCs because of the facile tuning of the optical absorption, molecular energy level, and carrier mobility.6–9 Tuning the energy level of the donor polymer is of particular importance.10–12 The energy level of the donor polymer controls important physical processes in the active layer such as exciton generation and diffusion, and charge separation and transport, which collectively determine the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc). Two effective strategies for tuning molecular energy levels have been studied and adopted. The first strategy is to copolymerize different combinations of donor and acceptor building blocks; various D–A polymers with different energy levels have been obtained.13–15 By using this method, significant progress has been made in the preparation of new D–A polymers that enable the fabrication of PSC devices with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%. The second strategy is the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as the fluorination of heterocycles in polymer backbones, in order to provide deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels with only a weak effect on the optical band-gap.16 Fluorination is a powerful approach to the manipulation of the molecular conformation and energy levels, and thus photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells. The strong electron-withdrawing characteristics of fluorine (F) atoms mean that the introduction of F directly into the conjugated backbone lowers both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers, as demonstrated for various D–A structures.17,18 As a result, large Voc values are observed for BHJ solar cells with F-substituted polymers. In addition, these fluorine atoms often exhibit strong intermolecular interactions with other atoms such as hydrogen (H) and sulfur (S) atoms, which increase the planarity of the whole polymer chain.19–22 The introduction of conjugated side chains has also been suggested as an effective means of controlling the energy levels of D–A conjugated polymers as well as of intensifying their absorption properties. Two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains have been developed by controlling their molecular conformations and energy levels in order to exhibit enhanced charge transport and extended solar spectral coverage.23–25 Of the possible conjugated side chains, it has been found that the phenyl group induces effective light absorption and facilitates charge carrier transport due to its efficient intermolecular packing and the advantage of its symmetric conformation, and thereby yields high Jsc values.26 There have been reports of increased Jsc values obtained by introducing conjugated side chains, and of simultaneous improvements in Voc values because of the low HOMO energy levels obtained by substituting fluorine into the backbones to the maximum extent.26–28 Even though there has been intensive research into the correlation between the substitution of conjugated polymer backbones with fluorine and molecular characteristics, the effects of fluorine substitution of conjugated side chains have not yet been adequately studied. Recently, G. Li et al. have reported that the polymer with a 4-alkyl-3,5-difluorophenyl group as the lateral side chain to a benzodithiophene unit gave a PCE of 8.24%.29 In our group, we have previously investigated the effects of varying the position of fluorination of the conjugated side chains of donor polymers on the overall molecular characteristics and photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells. It was found that the introduction of fluorine atoms into the meta position of the phenyl conjugated side chain intensifies intermolecular interactions and lowers the HOMO energy level, and that as a result Voc and Jsc were increased.30
In this study, we varied the number of fluorine substituents on the conjugated side chains and fine-tuned the molecular energy levels as well as the optoelectronic properties of the polymers. We used benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-difluorobenzothiadiazole (BDT-2FBT) building blocks as the polymer backbone and phenyl side chains. BDT-based derivatives with alkoxyphenyl side chains substituted with various numbers of fluorine atoms in the meta position were synthesized as donor units and copolymerized with fluorinated benzothiadiazole (2FBT) to explore the effects of fluorination (Fig. 1a). We found that fluorination of the side chains was as effective in yielding deep HOMO energy levels as the fluorination of the chain backbone. In particular, the polymer with phenyl side chains mono-fluorinated in the meta position was found to produce the highest PCE, over 7%, in the series of polymers due to the high crystallinity and well developed morphology of the polymer blend film. In this study, we systematically investigated the correlations between the optoelectronic properties of the donor polymers and the characteristics of the organic solar cells with the number of fluorine atoms in the conjugated side chains.

Results and discussion
Design, theoretical calculation and synthesis
Fluorination of polymer backbones is very effective in lowering their HOMO energy levels and leads to the planarization of the polymer chains through non-bonding interactions, which enhance electron transport.19–22 However, conjugated side chains have a large number of substitutable positions, so there is less restriction on the substitution position than is the case for polymer main chains. As a result, it is possible to vary the number of substituted fluorine atoms and to finely control the induced homo-energy level. In particular, the influence of a phenyl side chain in reducing the HOMO energy level is greater than that of other conjugated side chains, and it has a symmetrical conformation, which enhances intramolecular and intermolecular charge transport and thus produces superior Voc and Jsc values.26 In addition, when fluorine is introduced into the phenyl side chain, the excellent properties of the phenyl side chain as a conjugated side chain capable of inducing a high current are maintained only when the substituent is bonded to the meta position.30 With these considerations in mind, the number of fluorine atoms substituted onto the phenyl side chain was varied to examine the effects of side chain fluorination (Fig. 1a). The polymers with non-fluorinated, mono-fluorinated and di-fluorinated phenyl side chains were named PPh-0F, PPh-1F, and PPh-2F, respectively. Theoretical calculations were performed to gain deeper insight into the effects of fluorination of the conjugated side chains on their molecular conformations and molecular orbitals. The energy distributions of the model polymers were determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Gaussian simulation and a B3LYP/6-31G model,31–35 which explained the electronic structure and conformation of polymers. The changes in the HOMO energies of one BDT unit with a phenyl side chain as a result of the introduction of one to two fluorine substituents were investigated to determine the variation in its electrical properties with the number of substituted fluorine atoms. As can be seen in Fig. 1b, the HOMO energy level decreases as the number of substituted fluorine atoms increases. Calculations were also performed for polymers with optimized moieties and three repeating units (i.e., n = 3) with methyl alkyls to predict their energy levels, energy gaps, and conformations. Fig. S1† shows a superposition of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the repeating units of the polymers to illustrate the variation in the electrochemical properties that results from the differences in the shapes of the conjugated side chains. The HOMOs were delocalized along the chain backbone. The HOMO levels of the three models are different: the calculated HOMO energy levels for the models of PPh-0F, PPh-1F, and PPh-2F were −4.71 eV, −4.82 eV, and −4.92 eV respectively (Fig. S2†). The dihedral angles at the backbone bridge joint (θ1) between the BDT donating unit and the 2FBT accepting unit of the PPh-0F, PPh-1F, and PPh-2F models were found to be 21.65°, 21.58°, and 20.89°, respectively (Table S1†), which indicates that the backbone conformation induced by the presence of fluorine at the meta position of the phenyl group becomes more planar as the number of substituted fluorine atoms increases. Thus the polymers' electrical properties and crystallinities are dependent on the number of fluorine atoms in their conjugated side chains on the BDT units, as discussed below and demonstrated by our UV-Vis results; this conclusion is also supported by the calculated bond angles and planarity of the geometrically optimized structures. In addition, note that the introduction of fluorine atoms into the conjugated side chain also affects the energy level of the polymer chain, like direct fluorine substitution of the polymer backbone – and this relationship may explain the deep HOMO energy level in CV and high Voc value in PSC devices. The theoretical results predict that fluorine substitution of the conjugated side chain will not only be effective in lowering the homo-energy level but that it also will affect the molecular conformation and the crystallinity of the polymer favorably.
On the basis of the theoretical calculations, we analyzed and optimized the photovoltaic properties according to the number of substituted fluorine atoms. Previous studies have shown that the polymers with non-fluorinated phenyls exhibit sufficient solubility with butyl octyl chains, but the solubility of the polymers with fluorinated phenyls is relatively low due to the enhanced intermolecular attraction caused by the fluorine substituents. Therefore, we also introduced a hexyl decyl chain into PPh-1F and PPh-2F to optimize the device fabrication. The polymers with butyl octyl chains are named PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-BO, and PPh-2F-BO, and PPh-1F-HD and PPh-2F-HD are polymers with hexyl decyl chains (Fig. 1a). The corresponding polymers based on alkoxyphenyl-substituted BDT were prepared according to a modification of a previously reported synthetic pathway (Scheme S1†).36 We used reported methods to synthesize 2FBT (denoted as M6 in Scheme S2†).37 All polymers were polymerized via Stille coupling polycondensation reactions in toluene and DMF solvents. The detailed synthetic procedures and conditions for the monomers and polymers are presented in the Experimental section of the ESI.† The resulting polymers were carefully purified by performing Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform, and finally extracted with chlorobenzene (CB). The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by using high temperature gel permeation chromatography with DCB as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The number and weight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw), polydispersity indexes (PDIs), and decomposition temperatures (Tds) of the polymers are shown in Table 1. The thermal stabilities of these five polymers were determined by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S3†). The polymers exhibit good thermal stabilities, with high onset decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) in an inert atmosphere. No clear transitions or endothermic or exothermic behaviors were observed between 30 °C and 250 °C in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 1c and S4a,† the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-BO, and PPh-2F-BO are −5.42 eV, −5.56 eV, and −5.74 eV, respectively. These results indicate that the HOMO energy level is reduced by fluorine substitution, which agrees with the DFT results. This correlation was also confirmed by our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analyses, which found that the HOMO energy levels of PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-BO, and PPh-2F-BO are −5.21 eV, −5.33 eV, and −5.59 eV respectively (Fig. S5†). The HOMO energy levels of PPh-1F-HD and PPh-2F-HD, which have long alkyl side chains, were determined to be −5.58 eV and −5.71 eV; the trend in these values is similar to that in the HOMO energy levels of the polymers with short alkyl chains (Fig. S4b†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from the HOMOs and the optical band gaps. The theoretically calculated energy levels and energy gaps of the model structures are larger than those determined experimentally; this difference is attributed to the limitations of the DFT model for semiconducting polymers.33 As the number of substituent fluorine atoms in the phenyl side chain increases, the HOMO energy level gradually decreases. Electron-withdrawing groups on the polymer chain backbone decrease the energy of the HOMO.19–22 The introduction of fluorine, which is a strong electron-withdrawing element, onto the phenyl side chain reduces the HOMO energy level more than is the case for non-fluorinated side chains; this difference implies that even when a strongly electron-withdrawing substituent is present on the side chain, the HOMO energy level can be lowered as much as in the case where the fluorine is a substituent on the main chain. The Voc values of PSCs based on the synthesized polymers and PC71BM are expected to be high due to the relatively low HOMO energy levels of the donor polymers. A sufficient difference between the HOMO energy levels of the polymers and the LUMO energy levels of PC71BM will result in efficient exciton dissociation and thereby in efficient electron charge transport.38
Optical properties
Normalized optical UV-Vis absorption spectra of thin films of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows the absorption coefficients of the polymers with long alkyl chains. The spectra of all the polymers contain two absorption bands, one at short wavelengths (350 ≤ λ ≤ 450 nm), which originates from π–π* transitions, and a broad band at 550 ≤ λ ≤ 650 nm that is due to intramolecular charge transfer, as has been observed for other D–A-type conjugated copolymers.39 The main absorption bands of the polymer films are red-shifted by ∼40 nm compared with those of the solutions mainly due to the increased π–π interchain interactions that arise upon aggregation.19 The absorption edges of the polymers with butyl octyl side chains and 0F, 1F, and 2F were found to be 716 nm, 699 nm, and 686 nm, which correspond to band gaps of 1.73 eV, 1.77 eV, and 1.81 eV, respectively (Table 2). The spectra of both PPh-1F-HD and PPh-2F-HD, which have long alkyl chains, are blue shifted as the number of substituent fluorine atoms increases, as is the case for the series with shorter alkyl chains. These variations in the band edges are probably influenced by the electron affinities of the substituents in the side chains.40,41 The UV-Vis absorption spectra of all the polymer films contain strong vibronic shoulder peaks (0–0) next to the absorption maximum; the spectrum of PPh-1F-HD contains the strongest shoulder peak. Strong intermolecular interactions between neighboring polymeric backbones lead to effective interchain π–π* transitions.42 The higher magnitude of the vibronic peak (0–0 transition) for PPh-1F-HD indicates that it has a strong and well-ordered microstructure.43–45 The normalized optical UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in DCB solution are shown in Fig. S6.† These absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature 1 minute after the polymers had been fully dissolved in DCB by applying heat. The solution spectra of all the polymers contain weak shoulder peaks at long wavelengths, which are ascribed to strong aggregation that is probably due to the strengthened intermolecular interactions.31 Furthermore, as the number of fluorine atoms increases, the strengths of the interactions between the polymer chains also increase. When fluorine atoms are introduced into polymers, the intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains are generally activated by the H–F interaction.46 Note that the measured absorption coefficient values of PPh-2F-HD are lower than those of PPh-0F-BO and PPh-1F-HD for the entire UV-Vis range (Fig. 2b). Likewise, when having the same alkyl chain as butyl octyl, PPh-2F-BO shows a lower absorption than PPh-1F-BO (Fig. S7†). This trend in the absorption coefficients also matches that in the degrees of intermolecular packing evident in the X-ray diffraction patterns. Good planarity and solubility apparently increase the intensities of the peaks in the UV-Vis absorption spectra and probably improve charge transport. The low absorption coefficients of the polymers with di-fluorinated phenyl side chains (PPh-2F-BO and PPh-2F-HD) arise because the polymer chains are not fully flattened when the solution solidifies to form the film during spin-coating at high speed due to their relatively low solubility.47

X-ray diffraction properties
To obtain an in-depth understanding of the variations with fluorination in the crystalline properties of the thin films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXD) were performed.48Fig. 3 shows the 2D GIXD patterns of the neat polymer thin films spin-coated onto glass. As the number of substituent fluorine atoms increases, the aggregation evident in the solution UV-Vis spectra increases and the roughness of the film increases (see the insets in Fig. 3). All the polymer films produce strong X-ray diffraction peaks along the qz and qxy axes, which correspond to an intermolecular backbone layer ((h00) plane) and a π–π stacking plane ((010) plane) respectively. As the number of fluorine substituents in the polymer side chain increases, the crystalline features of the neat polymer films become more distinct, with only up to one fluorine substitution per side chain. These results are in good agreement with the absorption coefficients in the UV-Vis spectra and the morphological changes in the AFM images, which indicate that the roughness increases with the number of fluorine substituents. When the alkyl chain of the fluorine-substituted phenyl side chain is elongated to hexyl decyl, which is more soluble than butyl octyl, a strong (010) peak appears in the OOP direction, which is due to the face-on orientation. This result agrees with the conclusion that the crystallinity of a polymer is strongly influenced by its solubility as well as by the interactions due to its molecular structure.49 When the 2-butyloctyl chain and one fluorine are present, the edge-on orientation is dominant and the peak due to the face-on orientation is weak (Fig. S8†). The out-of-plane (OOP) GIXD profile for the PPh-1F-BO film contains pronounced lamellar stacking (h00) peaks at 0.26 Å−1, 0.51 Å−1, and 0.77 Å−1 and a π–π stacking (010) peak at 1.69 Å−1, whereas there are no significant (010) peaks in the OOP direction in the profiles for the PPh-0F-BO and PPh-2F-BO neat films. The in-plane (IP) GIXD profiles of the PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-BO, and PPh-2F-BO films contain a lamellar stacking (100) peak and a π–π stacking (010) peak. The (010) diffraction peaks in the IP direction and the higher-order peaks at (200) and (300) in the OOP direction in the GIXD patterns of the neat films of the polymers with butyl octyl chains show that the edge-on orientation is dominant in these films. Note that the lamellar stacking distance and the π–π stacking distance in the PPh-2F film are the smallest of those of the polymers. As the number of fluorine atom substituents on the phenyl side chain increases, the d-spacing decreases due to the strong H–F interaction (Fig. S9†). When there are two fluorine substituents, the intermolecular interactions are expected to be maximally activated and therefore result in the highest crystallinity. However, the crystallinity of the polymer with two fluorine substituents is lower than those of the polymers with no fluorine or only one fluorine substituent (Fig. 3 and S8†). As is the case for PPh-2F-BO, there are strong fluorine-based H–F intermolecular interactions in the PPh-2F-HD film, so it exhibits severe aggregation due to its relatively low solubility and does not form large well-ordered crystal domains as the solvent evaporates during the spin-coating process. These results are consistent with the trend in the absorption coefficients of the UV-Vis spectra.

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the polymers as the electron donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The device architecture was ITO/MoO3/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al, and the device area was 0.055 cm2. The performances of PSCs are very sensitive to the film morphology, so the solvents were carefully selected; all the polymers dissolve in CB or DCB only at high temperatures. This relatively poor solubility hinders the blend film processing of the polymers, so DCB was chosen as the solvent because of its high boiling point. The photovoltaic devices were optimized for three of the polymers, PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-HD, and PPh-2F-HD, which exhibit superior light absorption and crystallinity. The PPh-1F-BO and PPh-2F-BO devices were also fabricated. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination conditions with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4a). To optimize the device performances, we fabricated these devices with various polymer/PC71BM weight ratios and thicknesses by using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive.50 The corresponding Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE values were derived from the J–V curves and all of the relevant parameters are summarized in Tables 3 and S2.† The best device performance was obtained for a blend with a PPh-1F-HD to PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1.2 spin-cast from DCB with DIO; this device yielded Jsc = 13.18 mA cm−2, FF = 64.4%, Voc = 0.90 V, and PCE = 7.64%. A lower device performance was obtained for PPh-0F-BO under the same conditions; this device yielded Jsc = 12.23 mA cm−2, FF = 61.8%, Voc = 0.83 V, and PCE = 6.28%. For the device containing PPh-2F-HD, Jsc = 9.06 mA cm−2, FF = 58.1%, Voc = 1.00 V, and PCE = 5.26%. Note also that the inclusion of DIO was found to increase the PCEs of all the devices; these increases appear to be closely related to morphological changes in the photoactive layers.51–54 The average Voc values of the PSCs based on PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-HD, and PPh-2F-HD were 0.83, 0.90, and 0.99 V, respectively. Voc is generally proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the conjugated polymer and the LUMO level of PC71BM.55 PPh-2F-BO has the lowest HOMO energy level of the polymers according to the CV experiments and the theoretical calculations with DFT, and the Voc value of the device with PPh-2F-BO was the highest, up to 1.01 V (Fig. S10†). The devices fabricated under optimized conditions exhibit different EQEs in the range 300 ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm. The device with PPh-1F-HD exhibits a higher EQE peak, over 70% (at λ = 600 nm), than the devices with other polymers throughout this range of wavelengths (Fig. 4b) and therefore exhibits the highest Jsc. The Jsc and FF values of the PPh-1F-HD-based device were found to be much higher than those of the PPh-0F-BO and PPh-2F-HD-based devices, which might be due to differences between the light absorption strengths, charge carrier mobilities, and morphological structures of their active layers.

Since the crystallinity and orientation of the polymer in a blend film are important factors determining the charge transport in the associated solar cell, GIXD analyses were carried out. No changes in orientation occurred as a result of the addition of DIO, and the crystallinity of the polymer region in each blend was increased. To determine the variation in the properties of the blend films with increase in the number of fluorine substituents, blend films of PPh-0F-BO:PC71BM, PPh-1F-HD:PC71BM, and PPh-2F-HD:PC71BM were prepared by using DIO, and their crystalline properties were investigated. The polymer:PC71BM films produce higher-order GIXD (200) and (300) peaks (Fig. 5a–c). As for the neat polymer films, the face-on orientation is dominant in the PPh-1F-HD blend film with a strong (010) peak at 1.684 Å−1 in the OOP direction. The GIXD results of the polymer blends contain prominent higher-order (h00) diffraction peaks that are attributed to effective intermolecular packing due to the high planarity of the polymers and the H–F interactions. PPh-1F-BO:PC71BM and PPh-2F-BO:PC71BM blend films obtained by using DIO were also prepared to confirm the effects of fluorination. When the alkyl chain is elongated from butyl octyl to hexyl decyl, the q value of the (100) peak is reduced, i.e. that of hexyl decyl (0.251 Å−1) is less than that of butyl octyl (0.275 Å−1), and it was confirmed that the lamellar stacking distance of hexyl decyl (25.02 Å) is longer than that of butyl octyl (22.84 Å). To explain these effects in terms of the number of fluorine substituents, PPh-0F-BO, PPh-1F-BO, and PPh-2F-BO, which have the same alkyl chain lengths, were also compared (Fig. S11†). In the case of the polymers substituted with butyl octyl chains, the peak due to the face-on orientation is weak and almost close to that due to edge-on orientation. The lamellar stacking and π–π stacking distances in the blend films decrease as the number of fluorine substituents increases, as was the case for the neat polymer films. The crystallinities of the polymer films are also the same as those of the blend systems.
To correlate the nanoscale morphologies of the blend films with their photovoltaic properties and the number of fluorine substituents, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. As shown in the insets in Fig. 5, the BHJ films prepared from CB with DIO have different surface roughness (Rrms) values. The PPh-1F-HD:PC71BM blend film has the smallest value of Rrms. To gain deeper insight into the nanoscale morphological structures of the polymer:PC71BM blend films, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted (Fig. 5a inset, 5c). AFM was employed to probe the surfaces of the active layers, whereas TEM was used to investigate the internal morphologies by passing an electron beam through each film. The TEM images show that the lengths of the fibrils in the polymer:PC71BM blend systems are different. These fibrils correspond to highly crystalline features of polymers, as confirmed by the GIXD measurements. The TEM image of the PPh-1F-HD:PC71BM blend prepared with DIO contains longer and more distinct nano-fibrillar domains with higher densities than those of the other blend systems. This fibrillar structure is desirable because a bi-continuous interpenetrating network in a blend film fosters efficient exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and charge transport and thereby leads to enhanced Jsc and FF.56,57 In addition, the blend film composed of PPh-1F-HD and PC71BM has a small phase separation region and the smallest surface roughness value (2.25 nm). As a result, exciton dissociation occurs effectively in this blend film, so a high Jsc was obtained, up to 12.60 mA cm−2. In the case of the PPh-2F-HD:PC71BM blend film, relatively strong phase separation is evident between the bright polymer region and the dark PC71BM region, which is due to the polymer's low solubility during film formation. The PPh-1F-BO:PC71BM and PPh-2F-BO:PC71BM blend films prepared with DIO have similar appearances in the TEM images, but the additional fluorine substituent does result in stronger phase separation due to the lower solubility of these polymers with short alkyl chains (Fig. S11c†).

TEM images of the blends prepared from DCB with DIO: (e) PPh-0F-BO:PC71BM, (f) PPh-1F-BO:PC71BM, (g) PPh-2F-BO:PC71BM. 
The moderately developed fibrillar structures of the polymer blend films enhance charge transport.50 However, the PPh-2F-BO blend film contains a relatively large phase separation on the micrometer scale, as indicated by the bright region with a darker flame-like PC71BM region. In contrast, in the PPh-0F-BO and PPh-1F-BO blend films, the two components are well distributed and contain interpenetrated fibril shapes. These fibrillar structures are desirable because they foster efficient exciton diffusion and exciton dissociation, and thereby lead to increases in Jsc and FF.58 The high efficiency of the PPh-1F-BO blend is probably due to these well-developed fiber-like networks.
The hole mobility (μh) values of the polymers were determined by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The fits to the J–V curves based on the SCLC model are shown in Fig. S12.† The μh values obtained from the SCLC measurements were 7.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPh-0F-BO/PC71BM, 2.00 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPh-1F-HD/PC71BM, and 2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPh-2F-HD/PC71BM in devices prepared from CB with DIO. The μh values of the polymers with di-fluorinated phenyl side chains, PPh-2F-BO and PPh-2F-HD, are lower than those of the other polymers. This result is in accord with the GIXD conclusion that the PPh-2F-HD:PC71BM and PPh-2F-BO:PC71BM blend films have lower crystallinities than the other polymer blend films. The hole mobilities of the three polymers are correlated with the crystallinities of the polymers determined with GIXD. PPh-1F-HD is highly ordered; its closely packed crystal structure results in a device with a considerably higher μh value and a fill factor (66%) higher than those of the PPh-0F-BO (62%) and PPh-2F-HD (58%) devices. These results for the vertical charge carrier mobilities of the blend films are in good agreement with their BHJ morphologies, which possess bicontinuous interpenetrating networks containing fibrillar structures and polymer crystallites in the face-on orientation (Fig. 5). As a result, the solar cell device with PPh-1F-HD exhibits the highest efficiency, over 7%, with high Jsc and FF values.
Conclusion
In summary, five conjugated polymers based on a BDT-2FBT backbone with different numbers of fluorine substituents and different alkyl chain lengths in the conjugated side chain were designed and synthesized. We compared the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of these five polymers to determine the effects of their fluorine substituents. The phenyl side chains were substituted with various numbers of fluorine atoms in the meta position to produce mono-fluorophenyl and di-fluorophenyl side chains. The introduction of the fluorine atoms into the conjugated side chains of the polymers was found to improve Voc by lowering the HOMO energy level while maintaining a high Jsc as long as only one fluorine atom is attached in the meta position of the phenyl side chain. When two fluorines are introduced into the conjugated phenyl chain, Voc increases to more than 1 V. However, the introduction of more than one fluorine per phenyl side chain also disturbs the effective molecular packing of the polymer, which reduces its light-harvesting ability and its charge carrier mobility. The polymers with mono-fluorinated phenyl side chains exhibit good miscibility with PC71BM and a reduced PC71BM domain size in the polymer blend. The best device performance was obtained for PPh-1F-HD; this device yielded Jsc = 12.60 mA cm−2, FF = 65.1%, Voc = 0.90 V, and PCE = 7.64%. The introduction of fluorine atoms into the conjugated side chains has similar effects on the intermolecular packing between the polymer chains to those observed for direct fluorine substitution of the polymer backbone. In terms of morphology, fluorine substitution results in effective intermolecular interactions that induce wire-like morphologies and increased crystallinity. Thus, the introduction of fluorine atoms into the side chains is not only a promising method for the precise control of Voc but also an effective means of modulating the crystallinity and intermolecular packing. This facile and effective strategy of side chain substitution is expected to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.
