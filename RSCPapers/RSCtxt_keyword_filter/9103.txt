    , Accepted 21st July 2022First published on 26th July 2022AbstractCharge recombination reactions (CRRs) are responsible for the major loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). This study tracks the impact of the dielectric constant (ε′) of two D–π–A types of triphenylamine-based organic dyes (TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2) with naphthalene and anthracene π-bridges on CRRs, respectively, and these dyes are sandwiched as dielectric layers of capacitors between Al electrodes via rf-sputtering deposition. The structure and thickness of components of capacitors were considered by applying field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and ε′, ε′′, tanδ, ac conductivity (σac) and electric modulus (M*) of capacitors were analyzed by LCRmetry at different frequencies (f: 102–104 Hz) and temperatures (T: 299–390 K). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV-visible spectroscopy analysis of dyes were performed for revealing the optical profiles, highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), and band gap (Eg); the results were found to be highly consistent with density functional theory (DFT) quantum calculation outputs. The f- and T-dependent relationships were detected for ε′, ε′′, tanδ and σac, which experienced an upward trend and a downward trend with the increase in T and the decrease in f, respectively. The results indicated higher ε′, ε′′ M′ and M′′ values for TpAzo 2 than those of TpAzo 1, which from the molecular point of the view could be related to the more extending π-conjugated structure of anthracene in comparison to naphthalene π-bridges that not only provided appropriate dipole moments and exciton binding energy, but also facilitated powerful intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Therefore, this study proposes ε′, ε′′, M′ and M′′ as novel physiochemical characters in dye design, which have been neglected so far and can open a new synthesis paradigm for developing more efficient organic sensitizers for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, in spite of diligent efforts, harnessing charge recombination reactions (CRRs) has remained an unsolved challenge in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It is expected that the CRR of photogenerated charge carriers could play a characteristic role in the non-fulfillment of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs, while accusing fingers are pointing at the non-optimized molecular design of dyes. CRRs could be categorized into ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ types that impact the structural and physicochemical properties of dyes, which is important for overcoming their rate.1 It is well known that excited-electron injection via interfacial electron transfer (ET) occurs in pico- or femto-second order of time, whereas the injected electrons could recombine with oxidized organic dye (D*+) with several times slower kinetics in micro-second time scale.2,3 In order to rationalize this mismatched and stochastic interfacial ET kinetics, three main approaches have been developed so far. (i) According to the first approach, there are some differences between molecular orbitals (MOs) of organic dyes, which are involved in interfacial ET. Photoexcited electron injection in organic dyes commonly goes forward via ET from π* orbitals of anchors (e.g. cyanoacrylic acid and carboxylic acid), whereas CRR must happen to π orbitals of donor (D) part(s) of dyes, which not only is/are in the farther distance, but also experience(s) weaker coupling to TiO2. (ii) According to the second approach, a difference in thermodynamics driving force of CRR is responsible for such mismatched interfacial ET. For electron injection of excited states, the driving force is inherently activationless that happens in the continuum of states, while alteration in the inverted region of Marcus kinetics makes it possible for the CRR to go forward with a large free energy.4–6 (iii) The third approach states the blueprint of local electric fields at interfaces that facilitate the electron-D*+ separation as fast as possible for electron injection. In order to achieve to clear understanding that each of the above-mentioned contributors how remarkable impact on interfacial rectification is a great puzzle that has remained under speculation.7–11
Among the harnessing strategies of CRRs, special attention has been paid to the molecular structures of organic dyes. The donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) framework of organic dyes which have a rod-like molecular configuration might undergo unwanted aggregations, and consequently, foment more self-quenching and CRRs owing to D* → D energy transfer via stacking interactions π–π.12 Such interactions impose an inefficient electron injection process on the DSSCs. The inclusion of long alkyl chains/bulky aryl substitutions that introduced the starburst dyes was another synthesis paradigm for suppressing CRRs.13 These types of dyes are beneficial to anti-aggregation multidonor architectures that have been satisfactory options but not fully qualified candidates against CRRs. In the opposite direction, the dianchoring dyes cannot afford a better suppressing effect against CRRs. They are known to be successful candidates for achieving greater binding strength onto the semiconductor surface, and their π-conjugated building blocks could provide a reinforced photocurrent and more appropriate molar absorption coefficient. However, the D–π–A designs of dianchoring dyes are suffering from a weaker open-circuit voltage (VOC), and the high rate of CRRs is responsible for reduced VOC and lower PCE. In this respect, Hagfeldt and co-workers14–16 proposed a dianchoring type of double-branched triphenylamine-based dyes, but they mentioned that these dyes are faced with unrestrained CRRs and still there are ongoing efforts to introduce new structurally optimized candidates. Thiophene units as a cross-bridge of double D–π–A dyes with greater π → π* transitions and weaker π–π interactions represent a blocking effect against I3− spices of electrolyte that increasing in charge density is another strategy that was reported by Wang et al. They stated that the advantages of these dyes could have a downward shifting of the conduction band (CB), which causes a retarded CRR and enhances the VOC of DSSCs.17
In 2012, three comprehensive benchmarks were drawn for empowering the PCE of organic solar cells (OSCs) up to 20% by J. C. Hummelen and co-workers.18,19 (1) The first benchmark referred to a radiation limit that provokes weak ET absorption, which needs to be appropriately circumvented. (2) According to the second benchmark, a ‘drift-diffusion’ model20 of charge carriers could be utilized for considering the impact of space charges on bimolecular recombination, local electric fields, and electron injection. (3) Third and the most important one, they stated that the crucial role of the dielectric constant of dyes is felt missing, while it could be applied for diminishing the CRR in DSSCs. Based on the fact that the singlet–singlet exciton recombination21 and charge transfer exciton recombination are responsible for more than 12 and 32% of PCE loss in DSSCs, respectively, their main reasons are weak dielectric constant of DSSCs’ components. In this respect, by focusing on enhancing the dielectric constant of dyes as the main component of DSSCs, synthetic paradigms were majorly concentrated on adjusting the π-conjugated building blocks of dyes by including polarizable substitutions.
Up to now, the influence of the π-bridge structure of dyes and their successful alternatives in tuning the dielectric constant to greater values have remained unknown, and as the main target of the present study, we designed two triphenylamine D–π–A types of dyes with naphthalene and anthracene units (TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2) as π-bridges and triphenylamine and carboxyl FGs as D and A parts, respectively. We used these dyes as dielectric layers of a capacitor to be able to characterize the dielectric constant properties.
2. Experimental

2.2. Synthesis route of the TpAzo 2 dye
(E)-5-((4-(Diphenylamino)phenyl)diazenyl)anthracene-2-carboxylic acid (TpAzo 2) was synthesized using 0.5 g TPA, and 0.6 g 6-amino-2-naphthoic acid via the Sandmeyer coupling reaction in a chemical batch, which included 1.0 M of HCl solution kept in an ice bath at 0 °C under stirring condition. After that, 0.5 M of NaNO2 solution was mixed for 30–45 minutes and the temperature was increased up to 60 °C for completing the reaction. As a main product, a deep-red powder of TpAzo 2 dye was obtained by washing several times with absolute ethanol and ethyl acetate via recrystallization steps.

3. Capacitor device fabrication
3.1. Electrode preparation
The sputtering methods of the electrode fabrication procedure have been reported previously.25–27 The rf-sputtering instrument provides some advantages such as uniform thickness and dense coatings with a high deposition rate, which have been previously reported for thin layer deposition of ZrO2, TaN and In2O3, for developing electrodes of capacitors.25–27 In order to fabricate the electrodes of the capacitor, an Al thin film was deposited onto glass substrates (1.0 × 1.0 × 0.2 cm) using an rf-sputtering instrument (Desk Sputter Coater DST3, Nano-Structured Coatings Co. Iran). As the first step, the treatment process of glass samples was started by washing substrates with acetone and ethanol under ultrasonic conditions at room temperature (RT) for 20 minutes. In the second step, the Al target (Sindlhauser Materials GmbH; purity: 99.99%) was pinned at the gun of the rf-sputtering instrument chamber, and a vacuum turbopump (Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH) was set to obtain high-vacuum conditions (inside pressure ≈1.96 × 10−5 torr) and the flow rate and working pressure of Ar gas were kept in 33 sccm using a mass flow controller (MFC, Line Tech Co.) and 2.86 × 10−2 torr, respectively. A pre-sputtering step was executed for 10 minutes and the power supplier was set to 100 W. The thickness of the sputtered layer was detected by a quartz crystal-based monitoring system in the sputtering instrument.
3.2. Dye deposition
In order to deposit a thin film of dye, the sol inks were formulated by dispersing 0.2 g of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes in 2.0 mL of ethanol for five minutes under the ultrasonic condition at RT. Then, the sol inks were deposited onto Al-based substrates by a spin-coating method at 2000 rpm for three minutes. The spin-coating method has been previously applied for developing organic semiconductor thin layers for transistors and can be utilized for the dye deposition process.28 The samples were dried at RT for 50 minutes and prepared for the deposition of back-contact. The Al back contact electrode of the capacitor was deposited by a rf-sputtering method for 900 s.
4. Characterization
4.1. Dyes
FT-IR spectroscopy method was used for analyzing the molecular structures of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes that the procedure was started by formulating the KBr tablet of dyes by mixing a pure powder of dyes (0.01 g) and KBr. The mixtures were pressed by a press tool under the pressure of about ∼10 Ton cm−2. After that, the transparent tablets were analyzed using an FT-IR instrument and the transmission of samples was obtained vs. wavenumber. Using 1H- and 13C-NMR (400 MHz, UltraShield Co.) instruments, the exact molecular structures of dyes were approved. Moreover, a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technology, US) was applied for considering the molecular structures of dyes and also the complementary analysis of molar mass. The analyzing procedures of dyes using 1H- and 13C-NMR instruments were continued by gently dispersing 0.003 g of pure dye powder in a desired NMR solvent (CDCl3), while the samples in green-tape NMR tubes were subjected to in-pipet filtration to prepare for NMR analysis.
4.2. Spectroscopy
The UV-visible spectroscopy of dyes was implemented using a UV-visible instrument (Shimadzu Co, Japan) for considering the maximum wavelength (λmax) of the absorption profile and deriving a molar extinction coefficient (ε). Analysis of the absorption profile was performed by preparing an ethanolic solution of dyes (4.0 × 10−5 M), and the solution was added to the standard cell of the UV-visible spectrometer. Based on the Beer–Lambert law (eqn (1)), the λmax value can be determined, where the intensity of absorption reaches a maximum value. A = εbc(1)
4.3. Electrochemistry
In order to measure the HOMO and LUMO states of dyes, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was applied to the dye solution (4.0 × 10−5 M). The supporting electrolyte of the electrochemical batch was selected as 0.05 M of KClO4/acetonitrile. Electrochemical analyses were performed using working, counter, and reference electrodes (Pt|Pt|Ag/AgCl, 0.222 V) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The HOMO states of dyes can be calculated using eqn (2) as follows:29–31 HOMO (eV) = −(Eox + 4.4)(2) LUMO (eV) = −(Ered + 4.4)(3)
4.4. LCRmetry
The capacitance of the devices was analyzed in the range of frequencies from 102 to 104 Hz and the temperature range from T = 299–383 K by an LCRmetry method. Moreover, the tangent loss (tanδ) of the capacitors was detected using a portable digital LCRmeter (ESCORT ELC-133A model, Taiwan) by setting the instrument at 1.0 V and an alternative ac current voltage across Al electrodes of the capacitors. For this, we used eqn (4)–(6) as follows:32–38 (4) σac = 2πfε0ε′tanδ(5) (6)where C, d, A, f, ε′, ε′′, ε0, σac, and δ represent the capacitance (F), thickness (m), area of electrodes (m2), applied frequency (f, Hz), dielectric constant of dyes, imaginary dielectric constant, permittivity of the free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), ac conductivity (Ω−1 m−1), and loss factor of the capacitors, respectively.
4.5. Surface characterization
In order to characterize the geometry and thickness of electrodes, thin layers were analyzed using an FESEM instrument (Zeiss Co. Germany). The imaging process was continued by Au sputtering and transferring samples to a vacuum chamber with extra high tension (EHT, 10 kV).
4.6. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
The DFT calculation of dyes was implemented using the Gaussian 09 software, and the designing of the molecular structures of dyes was performed using the GaussView packages for the optimization of the geometry of dye molecules and calculating the ICT in the building block of dyes by an opt + freq method and full natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. By default, the DFT calculations were concluded in a vacuum situation by applying the B3LYP/3-21G basis set and the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distributions were analyzed for HOMO, HOMO−1, HOMO−2, HOMO−3, and HOMO−4 and also LUMO, LUMO+1, LUMO+2, LUMO+3 and LUMO+4 states.
5. Results and discussions
5.1. Capacitance (C)

Fig. 1(B) schematically represents the dye-based capacitor in the Al|dye|Al structure. In this architecture, the TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 thin films of dyes were utilized as the dielectric layers of the capacitor, which are sandwiched between sputtered Al electrodes. Using dyes as the dielectric thin layer makes it possible to consider the dielectric constant (ε′) by measuring the C values. Based on the fact that the ε′ of dyes plays a critical role in determining the ICT mechanism of charge carriers and electron–hole mobility in DSSCs, the novelty of this study is providing experimental and theoretical approaches that were applied for measuring the above-mentioned parameters for TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes. The relation between ε′ and electron–hole mobility (μh–e)39 in dye could be followed in the Mott–Gurney theory (eqn (7)) in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model:40 (7)where μh–e, d, J, and V represent the electron–hole mobility, thickness of dye layer, current density, and potential of the device, respectively. Based on the fact that the TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes were utilized as the dielectric layers of the capacitors, their thickness which represents the distance of the Al capacitors (d) was considered by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 1(A), the cross-section FESEM mode of capacitors provided 10 μm for d that, consequently, based on eqn (4) and the LCRmetry measurement, the C profile of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes were calculated at T = 299, 311, 323, 348, 368 and 383 K (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 1  (B) Schematic of the Al|dye|Al structure of capacitors based on TpAzo 2 and TpAzo 1, (A) cross-sectional (down-left), and (C) and (D) top-view mode of the FESEM images of the TpAzo 2 and TpAzo 1 dye layers in the capacitor, respectively. 
The results attributed to an f-dependent downward trend of C for these capacitors. For TpAzo 1, at T = 299 K, the C values were obtained as 47.57, 31.71, 7.77 and 2.20 nF, for 102, 1.2 × 102, 103 and 104 Hz, respectively, which provided the ε′ values 2150, 1433, 351 and 99. At the same condition, for TpAzo 2, the C values were obtained as 2.40, 2.21, 0.57 and 0.22 nF, for 102, 1.2 × 102, 103 and 104 Hz, respectively, which provided the ε′ values 27.16, 24.99, 6.44 and 2.53 (Fig. 2). As could be interpreted from Fig. 2, the C values decrease with the increase in the f value that this behavior could be extended to the tanδ. The tanδ is defined as the proportion of imaginary dielectric constant (ε′′) to real ε′; tanδ = ε′′/ε′41,42 in the complex dielectric permittivity (ε) equation, ε = ε′ + iε′′,43 which describes the energy loss in capacitors. Notably, the C change vs. f can be formulated using the Goswami & Goswami model that makes a relation between equivalent series capacitance (CS) and f following eqn (8)44 as follows: (8)where ω = 2πf; and also, R is the discrete resistance element. As mentioned above and according to eqn (8), the Cs value experiences a downward trend in f values up to 104 Hz. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, the C value experiences an increase vs. T, which could be related to more accumulation of charge carriers in higher T that similar results can be found in the literature for other types of dyes like phthalocyanines.45 The tanδ vs. f profile of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 are presented in Fig. 2 at T = 299, 311, 323, 348, and 368 K. Following Penn's model,46 the relation between ε′ of dyes and band gap (Eg) can be formulated as eqn (9) and (10):47 (9) (10)where ωp2 ≡ 4πNe2/m is the plasma frequency; Ef, ℏ, m, and N represent the Fermi energy, Plank's constant, electron effective mass, and concentration of electrons, which depends on T and Ef. If the small value of Eg/4Ef was neglected, based on eqn (10), ε′ ∝ 1/Eg2, a small change in Eg can cause a striking impact on ε′. Moreover, the Eg value of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes has a close dependence on their molecular structures and HOMO and LUMO states, the increase in the number of aromatic rings and π-bridge elongation can increase the ε′ value. In the lower domain of the frequencies, (102–1.2 × 102 Hz), ε′ of the dyes have substantial values (see Fig. 2) that could be related to the aggregation of the large numbers of charge carriers, which, in turn, foments the contributions of dipoles of the interfacial polarization. In the higher domain of the frequencies (103–104 Hz), the presence of dipole inadequacy descents ε′ considerably.

5.2. Loss factor (tanδ)
The complex dielectric permittivity (ε) can be defined as ε = ε′ + iε′′,43 while tanδ as a dielectric relaxation (known as the dissipation factor, DF, in the literature48) can be accounted as the proportion of imaginary dielectric constant (ε′′) to the real ε′ one, tanδ = ε′′/ε′,41,42 and describes energy loss in capacitors. Basically, the energy loss as an unwanted structural aspect occurs owing to a shift in the grain boundary polarization behind the electric field, for which they have three main sources:49,50 (i) the migration of space charges that are known to contribute to interfacial polarization; (ii) dc conductivity of the dielectric layer; and (iii) the movements that can be observed in the molecular dipoles, which is known as the Stark effect51 (electrochromism) and can be formulated as , where Δf, Δμ, E and  represent the transition frequency change, dipole moment change, local electric field and polarizability change between excited and ground states of an organic molecule. Fig. 2 shows the tanδ and ε′′ profile vs. f at T = 299, 311, 323, 348, and 368 K for TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes. The downward and upward trends of the results can be explained by the interfacial polarization of these dyes. From the microstructural point of view, the porosity of the dielectric layer can increase the tanδ values.52 It can be observed from Fig. 1 that the agglomerations of TpAzo 1 in dielectric thin layer were denser, bigger, and more amorphous than what was obtained for TpAzo 2. This phenomenon can be related to weaker π–π stacking interactions between TpAzo 1 dyes than TpAzo 2. Moreover, as shown in FESEM images (Fig. 1(C) and (D)), the grain size of TpAzo 2 is smaller than that of TpAzo 1, and this issue can influence the dynamics of charge diffusion via the thin layers of dyes.53Fig. 3 displays the unchanged profile of σacvs. f in the range of 102–1.2 × 102 Hz, while in the higher f domain, σacvs. f shows a linear upward trend. There is a noticeable point about σac profile that refers to the lower f domain the dc conductivity pattern, while an intense pump of conductivity at the higher f domain is observed for σac, which could be affected by the fast polarization mechanism54 and could be interpreted in Deby's theory approach.55 Based on the Gurevich and Tagantsev's theory, several phonon processes play a role in the intrinsic dielectric loss and tanδ values, which depend on the ac field frequency, symmetry of the dielectric layer's crystal structure, layered structure of dielectric composite50,56 and temperature.57 As shown in Fig. 2(D), for the TpAzo 1 dye, tanδ is proportional to T (tanδ ∝ T) in the low T range (T = 299–323 K) which is attributed to the two-phonon process of dielectric loss, while in the high T range (T = 323–383 K), the linear upward trend patterns of tanδ deviated from that of this dye. The results indicated that tanδ is proportional to T (tanδ ∝ T) at a broader T range (T = 299–348 K) for the TpAzo 2 dye, while at a higher T range (T = 348–383 K), a tanδ ∝ T2 pattern can be predicted, which implies the three-phonon process of dielectric loss.58 Such differences can be related to the impact of the difference in π-bridges of these dyes and more polarizability of TpAzo 2 than TpAzo 1 dye.

5.3. Complex electric modulus (M*)
The electric field relaxation in dyes can be considered by the M* factor that could be formulated in two main imaginary (M′′) and real (M′) parts of electric modulus and can be written as eqn (11):59 (11)where the first and second parts of eqn (11) represent the real and imaginary parts, which can be derived from ε′ and ε′′. Fig. 4(A)–(D) depicts M′ and M′′ for TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes vs. f at different T values, whose upward trending behaviors were obtained for M′ and M′′ by increasing f and T. While M′ and M′′ were observed to tend towards zero in low f regions, their behaviors in high f can be related to short-range charge carriers’ mobility mechanism toward the conduction process. Moreover, some reports stated the roles of restorative force that could potentially govern the mobility of charge carriers. Additionally, the f- & T-dependent relaxation time (τ) can be obtained from 2πfmaxτ = 1 for dyes, which means that this parameter can be affected by the aggregation of dyes and, consequently, intermolecular interactions. As shown in Fig. 1(C) and (D), TpAzo 2 forms smaller grains than TpAzo 1 that inferred to lower D–D intermolecular interactions, which play a vital role in suppressing the CRR process. Based on the fact that an optimum intermolecular D–D distance is required for achieving minimum self-quench of photoexcited states in DSSCs, the distance-dependent entity of M′ can be utilized as a characteristic parameter in the short-range charge mobility of carriers. From the comparative point of the view and tackling that how the naphthalene and anthracene π-bridges can show their impacts on charge mobility and CRR on a molecular scale, two main scenarios could be discussed that consist of: (1) the TpAzo 2 dye provides stronger polarizability, more powerful ICT, and charge mobility than the TpAzo 1 dye due to the more extending π-conjugated structure of anthracene in comparison to naphthalene π-bridge and (2) the noticeable difference in M′′ values reveals the fact that the hopping mechanism of electrical conduction is more intensely dominated for TpAzo 2 than TpAzo 1, which might be assigned to its more extending π-conjugated anthracene π-bridge (Fig. 4).

5.4. Electrochemistry and spectroscopy of dyes
The HOMO and LUMO levels that could be used for calculating the band gap (Eg) of dyes were applied for TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes based on the potential of oxidation (Eox). A solution of dyes (0.04 mM) was selected for the electrochemical analysis in the presence of KClO4 as a supporting electrolyte. The batch of electrochemical reaction was equipped with Pt|Pt|Ag/AgCl (0.222 V) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Eox values of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes were obtained at +1.03 and +1.10 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) that provided HOMO levels of about −5.82 and −5.98 eV for TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 dyes, respectively (see the Fig. 5(A), (C) and Table 2). The LUMO levels of these dyes were calculated −2.91 and −3.4 eV, and the Eg values were about 2.13 and 2.10 eV. The UV-visible profile of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 showed that the λmax value appeared at 524 and 541 nm, which can be related to π–π* and n–π* transitions due to the presence of π-conjugated structures in the molecular D–π–A building block (Fig. 5(B)–(E)). The DFT calculation results of dyes provided various states and dominated transitions for each dye (see Table 1). It seems that naphthalene and anthracene units can play a substantial role in adjusting LUMO states based on the DFT calculations. As can be observed in CV and DFT results, replacing naphthalene with anthracene unit has a smaller impact on HOMO of dyes than LUMO levels because more conjugated π-bridges cannot play an important role in the stability of cationic states of dyes. The ICT patterns of dyes were revealed by using the B3LYP/(3-21G) series of basis set and were started by initial structural opt + feq quantum calculations in the Gaussian09 package with designing molecular structures in the GaussView software to measure the electrons distributions in frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) in HOMO and LUMO states. The HOMO−1, HOMO−2, HOMO−3, and HOMO−4 states with LUMO+1, LUMO+2, LUMO+3, and LUMO+4 were tracked for dominated electronic transitions of dye molecules (see Table 1). Based on the DFT optimization results, the planar π-conjugated structure of π-bridges can not only affect HOMO → LUMO (TpAzo 1: −5.96 → – 3.09 eV; TpAzo 2: −6.98 → −2.83 eV), but also adjust the dominated transitions (see Fig. 5(C)). The impact of π-bridges on the ICT of dyes can be explained by the FMO density on the dye molecules, which are presented in Table 1. For both dyes in HOMO→LUMO states, the ICT + (π,π*) + (n,π*) transitions were observed that reflected appropriate ICT through the ‘push–pull’ effect. For these dyes, the experimental Eg values were calculated using the absorption profile and (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg) equation60,61 (see Fig. 5(D) and (E)).

5.5. Dielectric properties of dyes
As depicted in Fig. 2, ε′ and tanδ belonging to dye layers were gathered in the range of f that the values of ε′ and tanδ undergo a sharp decrease. The space charge polarization is responsible for the total polarization in dyes due to the presence of –COOH, –NN–, and –NR3 FGs. It is clear that they will experience an upward trend at higher temperatures via thermal agitation that plays a facilitating role in dipole rotation. From the molecular point of the view, the ICT values of TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 were calculated by DFT calculations, and based on FMO distribution on dye molecule building blocks, the charge concentration in the D part transits to the carboxyl FGs in excited states that causes strong dipole moments in molecules. A brief comparison between these dyes revealed that the π-bridge units (naphthalene and anthracene) with planar structures that make a π-conjugated form in the dye framework are able to play a significant role in transporting photogenerated holes from TPA parts to the A of dyes. Based on the fact that higher ε′ attributes to a higher exciton binding energy,62 it is expected that this is related to the polarizability of anthracene and naphthalene units.
6. Conclusion
The dielectric constant (ε′) of two triphenylamine (TPA)-based organic dyes named TpAzo 1 and TpAzo 2 was considered by developing and characterizing their capacitors, which were designed by the rf-sputtering deposition method. The main target of this study was established on tracking the impact of ε′ on charge recombination reactions (CRRs) that are responsible for the power conversion efficiency (PCE) loss of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). By altering the π-bridges of these dyes from naphthalene to anthracene units in TpAzo 1 to TpAzo 2 dyes, the ε′ values were measured as the main characteristic factors of capacitors, which structurally have an Al|dye|Al sandwiched architecture. The ε′, ε′′, tanδ, σac, M′ and M′′ values as characteristic parameters of capacitors were analyzed by the LCRmetry method in the 102–104 Hz frequency (f) and 299–390 K T range. Based on the results, f- and T-dependent relationships were found for these characters of dyes that followed Goswami & Goswami's model. Higher ε′, ε′′, M′ and M′′ values of TpAzo 2 dye than those of TpAzo 1 revealed the fact that more extending π-conjugated structures of anthracene π-bridges can play a crucial role in comparison to the naphthalene unit in achieving not only more appropriate dipole moments and exciton binding energy, but also a powerful intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and stronger hopping mechanism of charge mobility. Based on this finding, the present study proposed ε′, ε′′, M′ and M′′ as novel characters that need to be observed in dye design and have been neglected so far. Therefore, this strategy shows great potential to make a paradigm shift in developing more efficient organic sensitizers for DSSCs.
