    , Accepted 5th August 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractIn the organic photovoltaic community, extensive efforts have been made in proposing resolutions for depressing Voc loss related to the molecular structures and optoelectronic properties of materials in bulk heterojunctions. Focusing on understanding the origin of aggregation-induced Voc loss and exploring the generality for material design, we used non-fullerene acceptors with various alkyl pendants in bulk heterojunctions and characterized the optoelectronic properties. As the alkyl pendants became longer from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C10, the photovoltaic devices exhibited depressed Voc losses and improved power conversion efficiencies. This work expounds the structure activity relationship of alkyl pendant-dependent photovoltaic properties, suggesting a convincing guideline for non-fullerene acceptor design.
Introduction
Owing to their great potential in solution processing, and lightweight, high flexibility and applicability for large-area devices, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) stand out as a competitive photovoltaic technology and have received tremendous attention in recent years.1–6 Towards practical applications of state-of-the-art OPVs, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving the two essential properties of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability.7–9 Apart from exquisite pattern design of the devices and delicate interfacial optimization, the innovation of active layer materials plays an important role in achieving the true potential of OPVs toward outstanding photovoltaic performance.10–16 In the past few years, progress in chemical structure design and modification of the light-harvesting materials were intensively reported, especially in the field of non-fullerene acceptors (NFA).17–20 Compared to their fullerene counterparts, the remarkable advantage of NFA was manifested in facilitating chemical modification towards simple manufacturing procedures along with outstanding photovoltaic performance. Consequently, synergistic improvements aiming at both aspects should be fully considered in obedience to the original design intention of NFAs.
Side-chain engineering has attracted extensive attention in OPV fields because of the high feasibility of tuning the aggregation and stacking during film deposition, which significantly boosts the properties of conjugated polymers in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers.21–24 In previous reports, the swelling and dispersion of fullerene acceptors were usually tuned by using physical methods during device fabrication instead of chemical modification, because of the difficulty of accurate and precise synthesis induced by the isotropic nature of fullerene. In contrast, the NFAs exhibit unique properties compared to fullerene derivatives, which has been proven by numerous reports since the appearance of ITIC in 2015.17 Due to the homologous chemical structures, some physical properties of conjugated backbones of IDT-based acceptors, as well as rheological properties, are very similar to the segments of polymeric conjugated donors. As observed and discussed in the literature, most NFAs show particularly good miscibility with conjugated donor polymers in the BHJ active layer, so it is difficult to control the morphology using physical methods during device fabrication.25–29 Other than device engineering methods, such as utilizing additives and annealing treatments,30–32 chemical modification of NFAs has become an effective method in tuning the BHJ morphology. Numerous studies of molecular design methods have been performed to modify the optical absorption properties or the energy levels of the NFAs in order to improve the PCEs of NFA-based devices.33–35 However, there is still a lack of systematic studies precisely aimed at exploring the relationship between the length of alkyl pendants of NFAs and the corresponding device performance.
According to the results in previous literature studies, the aggregation behaviours and optoelectronic properties, which are closely related to the alkyl pendant length of NFAs, play vital roles in determining the energy loss in the charge generation process.36–39 Energy loss has been regarded as one of the important pathways to modulate the open-circuit voltage (Voc). According to the conclusion drawn using the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) approach, three deterioration processes are widely accepted that account for electron relaxation and carrier recombination within active layers so that the Voc loss (ΔVoc) can be categorized into three contributions,40–42 (1)where q is the elementary charge, VSQoc is the maximum voltage based on the SQ limit, and Vradoc represents the radiative recombination in the device. The three terms on the right hand side of eqn (1) can be recognized as V1, V2 and V3. Based on discussions in the references, Voc is mainly affected by the term V3, due to the shift of the luminescence emission with respect to a determined Eg.43–45 Among all the parameters, Voc is influenced by the morphology, especially the stacking distance between two molecules, which is dominated by the length of the alkyl pendant.
In a previously published study, we reported an NFA with an expanding absorption spectrum and high electron mobility, named IT-4Cl-C6, which exhibited poor solubility and thus complicated the coating process of BHJ (see Fig. 1).46 Here, we have designed and synthesized two congeners of IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10, to investigate the influence of alkyl pendant length on device performance. The chemical structures of IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 are shown in Fig. 1a. By blending the three acceptors with PBDB-TF (also named PM6),47 we fabricated the photovoltaic devices in parallel with the studied BHJs. As the alkyl pendant length increases, the solubility of the three NFAs gradually improves, and the corresponding OPV devices exhibit PCEs from 6.67% to 13.54%. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the non-radiative energy loss could be effectively modified by tuning the alkyl pendants of the acceptors. From IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the Voc was increased subsequently due to the relieved aggregation induced by the increasing length of the alkyl pendants. Therefore, these results provide a promising suggestion for alkyl pendant design in future studies on NFAs.

Results and discussion
In BHJ material design for efficient OPV devices, the alkyl pendants prevent molecules or segments from excess aggregation, both in solution and solid states. Thus a more accurate comparison of the alkyl pendant lengths in molecular acceptors would be facilitated by the use of molecules exhibiting pronounced aggregation behavior.48–50 According to some reports about halogen atom substitution on polar terminal groups of NFAs, chlorine substitution tends to lead to a more ordered and coherent π–π stacking than fluorine substitution, which closely meets our requirement. In the case of acceptors with chlorine substituted terminal groups, excess π–π stacking always leads to the formation of large domain size, which impacts the photovoltaic process and the corresponding devices usually exhibit large Voc loss. Consequently, we used chlorine substituted ITIC, together with PBDB-TF, to investigate the correlation between the length of the alkyl pendants on NFAs and the corresponding Voc loss in their devices.
The molecular structures of the studied BHJ materials are listed in Fig. 1a. The three NFAs with different lengths of alkyl pendants, namely IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10, were obtained using the reported synthetic procedure (see the ESI†).46 As shown in Fig. 1b, complete coincidence took place in the normalized absorption spectra of the studied acceptor solutions across the whole characterized wavelength range. The three NFAs exhibit the same maximum absorption peak at 700 nm and absorption edge at 760 nm, indicating that aggregation behaviour exists in the studied solutions and no extra variation in the correlative intensities are observed by changing the lengths of the alkyl pendants. On the contrary, obvious transformations are observed in the absorption coefficient test in solid films. As shown in Fig. 1c, the absorption coefficients (α) were decreased from 1.32 × 105 cm−1@745 nm to 1.19 × 105 cm−1@747 nm and to 6.48 × 104 cm−1@750 nm, as the alkyl pendants became longer from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10. This phenomenon was identical to some reports, in which it was attributed to the depressed π–π stacking of conjugated molecules or polymers.51 In contrast to absorption of solutions, the molecular packing in the solid states is strongly impacted by the steric hindrance of alkyl pendants. Longer alkyl pendants prevent the conjugative building blocks from tight aggregation so that there is a low transition probability from the ground states to the excited states, which is presented as the decrease of absorption coefficients.52 This argument can be verified by the deeper occupied molecular orbital as well as the increased optical gap when the alkyl pendant becomes longer. From the characterization of the cyclic voltammogram (CV) in Fig. 1d, we can determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and electrochemistry bandgaps (Eecg).53 For IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10, the values (HOMO/LUMO/Eecg) are −5.85/−4.17/1.68 eV, −5.94/−4.10/1.84 eV and −5.95/−4.08/1.87 eV, respectively. The optical and electric characterizations of the synthesized acceptors used demonstrated that the segment packing distance is the key parameter for determining the differences in light responsiveness and energy levels.
As the alkyl pendants become longer from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the repulsion induced by steric hindrance against Coulomb attraction became stronger, which was confirmed by the thermodynamic analysis of the NFA powders. In Fig. S2 (ESI†), we listed the result of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The primary weight loss of NFAs occur at 383 °C (IT-4Cl-C6), 356 °C (IT-4Cl-C8) and 338 °C (IT-4Cl-C10), which indicates that the cohesive energy of the studied NFA gets lower as the length of the alkyl pendants gets longer. Considering that the same solvent will be used in film deposition, the different cohesive energies of NFAs should bring significant distinguished behaviours in the rheological process.
Light scattering studies were widely used in determining the sizes of nano-scale or micro-scale aggregates by presenting the time-resolved scattering intensity of the Brownian movement. Here we initiated the investigation of the micelle sizes of the three acceptors in chlorobenzene (CB) by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the aggregation size of IT-4Cl-C6 is much larger than that of IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10. By directly extracting the values in the distribution of sizes, the Z-average sizes of IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 are 10600 nm, 148.9 nm and 12.2 nm, respectively. This means that at the initial stage of spin coating, large clusters existed in the precursor ink of IT-4Cl-C6, which leads to the formation of large aggregates in the final film. Explicitly, IT-4Cl-C6 would provide the highest possibility to form larger domains when blending with the donor material due to the shortest length of alkyl pendants. We further prepared the BHJ samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using the method described in device fabrication. As shown in Fig. 2a, large aggregations with much higher contrast and sharp boundaries can be easily detected in the light field image of TEM. According to the scale bar, the sizes of the dark domains lay in the range of tens of nanometers. According to the references, the domains with much higher contrast are consistent with a large population of acceptors. As the length of alkyl pendants become longer in IT-4Cl-C8, the boundaries of the domains were vague, while a large population of cotton-like domains appeared in the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 blend (see Fig. 2b). In the TEM image of the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 blend film (see Fig. 2c), the morphology is very uniform. Based on the TEM images, we can infer that the compatibility between PBDB-TF and these acceptors gets better as the length of alkyl pendants become longer.

The scale bars are 200 nm. 
The findings in the TEM characterization were further supported by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The blend film of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 shows a distinct surface morphology compared to the other two blends. As shown in Fig. 2d and g, it displayed the most conspicuous aggregation with a mean square surface roughness (Rq) of 10.3 nm. As the length of the alkyl pendants become longer, the blends of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 show very similar morphological properties, i.e., a more uniform surface with fibril-like networks can be observed, and the Rq values of the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 blends are 1.66 nm and 1.76 nm, respectively. The AFM images indicated that the shortest alkyl pendants on IT-4Cl would facilitate strong aggregation in the acceptor's domains, which may cause severe charge recombination in the blend.
The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements (GIWAXS) were carried out to characterize the aggregation of the studied films. As a shared component in three BHJs, the packing orientation of PBDB-TF should be firstly recognized. As shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), coupling with the reflection at 1.68 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the [010] plane of PBDB-TF, the pronounced reflection at 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane direction (IP) indicates that the segments of PBDB-TF preferred face-on orientation according to the substrate. Similar orientations were observed in the patterns of IT-4Cl-C8 (Fig. S5c, ESI†) and IT-4Cl-C10 (Fig. S5d, ESI†), demonstrating a comparable face-on orientation due to the pronounced reflections at 1.76 Å−1 in OOP (π–π stacking) and at 0.30 Å−1 in IP (lamellar packing). It should be noted that the dispersion ring at 1.36 Å−1 in Fig. S5d (ESI†) is a signal for the depressed aggregation of IT-4Cl-C10 induced by the longer alkyl pendant. In contrast, significant differences were detected in the GIWAXS pattern of IT-4Cl-C6 that the reflection corresponding to π–π stacking is absent in the OOP direction. As shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†), the IT-4Cl-C6 molecules exhibit a pronounced edge-on preference since the reflection of OOP π–π stacking is absent, which is replaced by the reflection corresponding to π–π stacking perpendicular to the normal line of the substrate detected at 1.75 Å−1 in the IP direction, as well as the bright scattering signal at 0.50 Å−1 in the OOP direction. From IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the π–π stacking orientation transfers from edge-on to face-on, which should be the main cause of the poor wettability of the precursor solution of IT-4Cl-C6 induced by strong molecular aggregation.54 As a result, the aggregation intensities of the precursor solutions are maintained in the BHJ films. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 film shows pronounced reflections at 0.30 Å−1, 0.38 Å−1 and 0.51 Å−1 in the OOP direction, which are the same as that of the neat IT-4Cl-C6 film. Compared to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, the π–π stacking orientations of other two BHJs show obvious face-on preference according to the substrate (Fig. 3b and c). The line-cut profiles of the corresponding GIWAXS patterns of the studied BHJs are displayed in Fig. 3d. With consideration of the similar aggregation tendency of IT-4Cl-C6 detected in AFM images, it can be confirmed that the large population of IT-4Cl-C6 crystallites with an edge-on orientation and the preferred distribution is maintained in the BHJ film blending with PBDB-TF, which results in a reduction in the donor/acceptor interface.

By using IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 as acceptors, we prepared BHJ films blending with PBDB-TF and fabricated the OPV devices in parallel. A conventional device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/BHJ/PFN-Br/Al is used, and the detailed fabrication method is provided in the ESI.†Fig. 4a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the results are listed in Table 1. From IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the Voc values of the devices increased from 0.78 V to 0.83 V and to 0.87 V, and the phenomenon may partially result from the gradually higher LUMO levels of IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10. A more quantified comparison will be implemented in the following discussion. The IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 based devices exhibit similar short circuit current densities (Jsc) of 20.44 mA cm−2 and 20.32 mA cm−2, respectively, while the IT-4Cl-C6 based device shows a relatively lower value of 18.85 mA cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding devices are demonstrated in Fig. 4b, and the calculated Jsc values are quite consistent with those of the J–V measurements. Based on the device performances in Fig. 4a and b, the differences in PCEs primarily originated from the FFs, which resulted from the differences in morphology. Huge domains in PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 BHJ led to an excess field-dependent geminate recombination which depressed the FF in the corresponding device. In order to quantify the field-dependent electron escape probability against geminate recombination, we performed a comparison of the effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) of the three studied devices, in which Jph is equal to the difference between dark current density and light current density. The Veff can be calculated from the difference between applied voltage and threshold voltage, at which the Jph equals zero. As shown in Fig. 4c, Jsat values, as well as the probabilities for exciton dissociation (Pdiss), were achieved by dividing Jscs by Jsats. By comparing the Jph values at 8 V (Veff), the Jsat values of devices with PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 BHJs were 20.88 mA cm−2, 22.18 mA cm−2 and 21.36 mA cm−2, respectively, showing a similar trend to the results of J–V curves and EQE measurements. Since the applied voltage is large enough to dissociate the photogenerated exciton at the donor/acceptor interface, Jsat only depends on the effective amount of excitons which successfully diffuse to the interface. In the case of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, even though the acceptor shows a larger absorption coefficient in Fig. 1c, Jsat is still lower due to the large domains observed in the AFM and TEM images. The Pdiss values of the studied devices are listed in Table 1, and the Pdiss values of the devices gradually increased as the alkyl pendants became longer for the acceptors. The phenomenon indicates that favourable exciton dissociation and weak geminate recombination exists in all the three blends, while it shows relatively inferior capability in the blend of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 compared to the other two blends. According to some mechanisms suggested by other reports, field-dependent exciton dissociation can occur within a fixed range near the donor/acceptor interface, which can be quantified by the exciton diffusion distance.55 Since the domains in BHJs of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 are much smaller than that of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, the improved Pdiss should be attributed to the drastically densified interfaces. The short alkyl pendant of IT-4Cl-C6 induced traps in exciton dissociation based on the results of light intensity dependent Voc measurements which was also harmful to the FF. As shown in Fig. 4d, the ideal factors (IFs) of diodes in studied devices were calculated according to the linear fitted data. The IF values were 1.43 (PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6), 1.32 (PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8) and 1.27 (PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10), respectively. Since the IF is a quantity referring to trap-induced recombination in the devices, the results indicated that the trap-induced recombination could be depressed when increasing the length of the alkyl pendant in IT-4Cl.

Based on the above discussion, we can infer that the morphologies of IT-4Cl-based BHJs would change a lot assisted by the alkyl pendants. By increasing the length of alkyl pendants from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the cluster sizes in precursors and thus the aggregates in coated films could be depressed. As a result, by using a longer alkyl pendant, the effective amount of exciton increases and excess trap-induced recombination is avoided. By considering the differences induced by morphological changes in the quantified recombination, we evaluated Voc loss to gain a deeper insight into the relationship between the subtle variation in the chemical structure of the three acceptors (the length of alkyl pendants) and the charge generation process in the corresponding devices. We carried out photoluminescence (PL) emission characterization to investigate the PL quenching in BHJs. The normalized PL emission spectra of the pure donor and three acceptors are listed in Fig. 5a. According to the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptors in this study, the excitation wavelengths were selected as 600 nm and 690 nm, respectively. The peak of donor emission is located at 673 nm (1.84 eV), while those of acceptors are all at 810 nm (1.53 eV). We used the same excitation wavelengths to the three BHJ films of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 and the profiles are shown in Fig. 5b. The solid circles and the hollow circles represent the emissions excited at 600 nm and 690 nm, respectively. When an excitation wavelength of 600 nm is used, the PL emission spectra is mainly caused by PBDB-TF. The gradually decreasing PL emission intensities from PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 indicate that the exciton generated in PBDB-TF cannot be effectively quenched in BHJ with IT-4Cl-C6. This phenomenon can be attributed to the large aggregations formed in the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 blend, which led to weak PL quenching compared to the other two blends. Similar to the excitation at 690 nm, the PL emission intensities at 810 nm were also further quenched when the alkyl pendants became longer from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, with the peak corresponding to the emission of the acceptors. All the results in PL characterization indicated that the short alkyl pendant of IT-4Cl-C6 led to ineffective PL quenching due to the presence of large domains in BHJ, while this problem can be effectively overcome in IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 with longer alkyl pendants.

Electroluminescence emission spectra with varied voltages of (d) PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, (e) PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and (f) PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10. External quantum efficiencies characterized using Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy, and electroluminescence emission spectra with highest voltages are listed in (g–i) for PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10, respectively. 
As discussed above, the short alkyl pendant on IT-4Cl-C6 depressed the solubility in chlorobenzene and thus promoted the formation of large acceptor domains in BHJ. As the alkyl pendant became longer to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the aggregations of acceptors in BHJ were relieved, which optimized the domains for efficient charge generation. Further demonstration was conducted by the EQE of electroluminescence (EL) and the EL emission spectra. As shown in Fig. 5c, the EQEEL of the IT-4Cl-C6-based device was obviously lower than that of the IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10-based devices, implying that the non-radiative recombination in the IT-4Cl-C6-based device is much more than in the others. Thus the separated donor/acceptor domain observed in the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 blend, it is a persuasive evidence for the sharply increased population of effective heterojunction in PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10, which is consistent with the deduction concluded from PL results.56 In addition, the spectra were almost independent of the injection current in the low injection current regime, which indicated that the data were collected under quasi-equilibrium conditions. By changing the applied voltage on the studied devices, the EL spectra of the BHJ layers under different bias are displayed in Fig. 5d–f. Compared to the PL data excited at 690 nm, the EL data with different bias provided more information of the BHJs. Donor-dominated PL emission is mainly present from 650 nm to 750 nm, which is supported by the donor emission detected in PL experiments. When increasing the applied voltage, carriers are injected to a higher excited orbital including the LUMO level of pure PBDB-TF if it exists in the blend. From Fig. 5d–f, the intensities of emissions within this range decrease from PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10. This means that a pure donor phase exists in the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 blend and the population of pure donor decreases from PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10. This exploration is consistent with the results of optical and morphological characterizations that the increased packing distance between neighbour segments from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10 decreases the absorption coefficient and increases the domain size. Since the same weight ratio of donor and acceptor is used in device fabrication, the population of the pure donor in PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 is hence increased. On the other hand, the emission spectra in the range from 850 nm to 1100 nm provide information of the inner bandgap states, which is solid evidence of the formation of BHJ. The broad swellings around 900 nm in the EL spectra shown in Fig. 5d–f stand for the radiative recombination below the bandgap (the bandgap can be determined by the FTPS-EQE and EL spectra in the following discussion).57 The increased count of emitted photons around 900 nm from PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and to PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10, which facilitate the gradually enhanced EQE, indicates that larger effective densities of states (DOS) exist on increasing the length of alkyl pendants. Consequently, the causality from the length of the alkyl pendant to the population of BHJ in the blend and to the difference in photovoltaic performance has been fully studied.
Moreover, the aggregation behaviour of the blends, which can be affected by the alkyl pendants on the acceptors, show great impact on the charge transfer (CT) state and the Voc.58,59 In order to quantify the Voc loss in the three studied BHJs, we used external quantum efficiencies characterized by using Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS-EQE), as well as the EL emission spectra N(E) of the three devices. As shown in Fig. 5g–i and Table 2, the bandgaps (Egs) were determined by the intersections of the FTPS-EQEs and EL spectra. For the BHJ layers of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10, the values of Eg were 1.54 eV, 1.58 eV and 1.59 eV, respectively. The N(E) are obtained by using an injection current as low as 50 mA cm−2, to ensure the data were collected under quasi-equilibrium conditions. In the measurable energy range, for PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 blends, both charge transport (CT) emission and PBDB-TF relaxation (PBDB-TF*) from the excited state to the ground state were detected. In the PL study, the peak of PBDB-TF* relaxation was 1.84 eV with a weak shoulder at 1.72 eV. The two peaks coincided well with the results in N(E). Referring to the results of FTPS-EQE, the CT emission can be more accurately retraced using the profiles of N(E), which was able to trace the photocurrent at the low energy range. The arrows (labeled as CT1) indicate the transitions from the ground state to the lowest energy emissive interfacial charge-transfer state of the CT manifold (CT1) at 1.48 eV for PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, 1.50 eV for PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and 1.52 eV for PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10, respectively. In contrast, the emission of PBDB-TF* was absent in PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 with CT1 remaining. This observation supported our argument that PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 showed the highest population of effective heterojunctions. The differences between values of CT1 were not identical to the differences of Voc or Eg, so there still exist extra parameters that dominate the Voc loss. Subsequently, we used the widely used models, together with eqn (1) to evaluate ΔE1, ΔE2 and ΔE3. The results are summarized in Table 2. The total Voc loss (Eg − qVoc) of the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6, PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C10 devices were 0.76 eV, 0.75 eV and 0.72 eV, respectively. The Voc loss difference of PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 and PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C8 were comparable rather than the remarkable difference as photovoltaic performance in J–V characterization. As stated in other reports, ΔE2 was mainly dominated by radiative recombination, while ΔE3 was mainly dominated by non-radiative recombination in BHJ.60

Combining the above analysis, we can make further conclusions regarding the influence of chemical structures on Voc loss. In the case of IT-4Cl-C6 with a very short alkyl pendant, strong aggregation with remarkable long-range order is preferred within pure acceptor domains. The highly coherent and regular aggregation facilitates the separating out of acceptors, representing the large domain size as well as low population of BHJ in blend films after spin coating, which are harmful to the photovoltaic process. Consequently, although the tight π–π stacking in acceptor domains promotes the electric susceptibility and thus degeneracy of the unoccupied molecular orbital in acceptor domains, the large domains and the resulting poor donor/acceptor contact in the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl-C6 layer lead to an increase in non-radiative energy loss. On the other hand, in the case of IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10 with long alkyl pendants, the morphology of BHJ was fine-tuned and no large domain of acceptors was present in the blend. Benefiting from the relatively loose packing-preference during the formation of acceptor domains, the premature separating out of acceptors is prevented, which is replaced by the formation of adequate donor/acceptor contact. In this situation, the Voc loss was mainly caused by non-radiative recombination as displayed in Fig. 4b and Table 2. From the viewpoint of acceptor design, both non-radiative and radiative recombination can be effectively depressed by tuning the alkyl pendant of acceptors, which is important to further the molecular design of NFAs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized three acceptors (IT-4Cl-C6, IT-4Cl-C8 and IT-4Cl-C10) to investigate the influence of alkyl side chain length on device performance. By blending the acceptors with PBDB-TF, we fabricated the photovoltaic devices with the studied BHJs, exhibiting PCE values from 6.67% to 13.54%. Our studies demonstrated that both the non-radiative and radiative recombinations can be effectively depressed by tuning the lengths of the alkyl pendants of acceptors. As the lengths of alkyl pendants become longer from IT-4Cl-C6 to IT-4Cl-C8 and to IT-4Cl-C10, the population of effective heterojunctions was increased, leading to the improved photovoltaic performance. Even though the degeneracy of an unoccupied molecular orbital is increased in the case of IT-4Cl-C6, in which the non-radiative recombination is depressed, the short alkyl pendant enhances the trends of tight aggregation and premature separating out of acceptors. By using acceptors with long alkyl pendants, excess aggregation was absent and the Voc loss was mainly caused by non-radiative recombination. Our results provide good insight into alkyl pendant design for future studies on acceptors.
