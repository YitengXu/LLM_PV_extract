    , Accepted 3rd March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractTernary solar cells are emerging as an attractive strategy to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of binary ones while maintaining the simple processing of single junction devices rather than that of the more complex tandem cells. However, only a few successful ternary blend solar cells have been reported with improved device performance. In this study, a low band gap small molecule DPPEZnP-O, which shows complementary absorption to PTB7, is introduced into PTB7:PC71BM (PTB7: poly-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene; PC71BM: (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) to fabricate ternary solar cells. A PCE of 8.39% is achieved for the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ternary solar cells with 20% DPPEZnP-O, which is a 12% enhancement in PCE compared with the binary OSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM. DPPEZnP-O in PTB7:PC71BM not only broadens light absorption to the near infrared region from 750 to 900 nm to harvest more photons but also plays a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM to provide more charge transfer routes at D/A interfaces. Unlike in many cases, 20% DPPEZnP-O in PTB7:PC71BM does not form recombination centers to suppress the charge transport process, which also plays a role in the enhanced OSC performance.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have been recognized as one of the most promising next-generation green technology alternatives to inorganic photovoltaic cells and have drawn much attention with the aim of achieving an eco-friendly and low-cost conversion of solar energy to electricity due to the solution processability, light weight and flexibility of organic solar cells (OSCs).1–3 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 10% have been achieved for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) single-junction solar cells.4–9 In order to further enhance the photocurrent generation, one strategy is to synthesize new lower bandgap donor materials.10–13 However, many trial-and-error experiments are needed in order to obtain high efficiency low bandgap materials, and most of the low bandgap donor materials exhibiting near IR absorption show a low OPV performance due to a deteriorated charge recombination. Therefore, how to use two or more existing materials with complementary absorption attracts great interest.14–16 Though tandem architectures can extend light absorption and improve light harvesting by collecting high and low energy photons separately, they involve very challenging multiple-step layer-by-layer processing, the engineering of cell-connecting layers and the optimization of the sub-cells,17–19 which can limit their applications. On the contrary, ternary solar cells are very promising to overcome the performance bottleneck of binary solar cells since they can maintain the simple processing of single active layer devices rather than that of the more complex tandem cells.20,21 However, only a few successful ternary blend solar cells have been reported with improved device performance compared to the corresponding binary cells. Also, the impacts of a third component on the host matrix have not been fully understood.22–42 Recently, benefiting from new efficient materials and a more in-depth understanding of the mechanism of ternary solar cells, some sensitizers have been successfully utilized in ternary solar cells.23,28 However, only a few ternary blend solar cells showed PCEs of more than 8%,14,35,38,39,43 leaving huge room for further improving their efficiencies. The highest efficiency of 10.5% of ternary blend solar cells was reported by Wei's group.40
OSCs based on poly-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7, Fig. 1) as the donor material have been intensively studied,38,44,45 but the short-circuit currents of the PTB7-based solar cell are still not excellent due to insufficient light absorption in the near-infrared region. Considering the wide and strong absorption in the near-infrared region of the reported low bandgap small molecule 5,15-bis(2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di-thienyl-2-yl-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(4-octyloxy-phenyl)-porphyrin zinc (DPPEZnP-O, Fig. 1),46 here, we report the fabrication of ternary blend BHJ solar cells by incorporating DPPEZnP-O with PTB7 and PC71BM, and an enhanced PCE of 8.39% is achieved for the ternary solar cells with an improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.22 mA cm−2 compared with the binary solar cells based on PTB7:PC71BM.

2. Experimental section
BHJ-OSC device fabrication
The solution-processed BHJ solar cells were fabricated as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and isopropyl alcohol. After being treated with an oxygen plasma for 4 min, a 40 nm thick poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-casted on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were subsequently dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a N2-glovebox. The electron donor materials of DPPEZnP-O and PTB7 and the electron acceptor material PC71BM (from Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in chlorobenzene to generate 25 mg ml−1 blend solutions. The doping weight ratios of DPPEZnP-O to PTB7 were 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 100%, and the weight ratio of the donors (DPPEZnP-O + PTB7) to PC71BM was kept at 1:1.5. The blend solutions were spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS films at 1400 RPM for 40 s to fabricate the active layers. The thicknesses of the active layers measured by a profilometer were 100 nm and 110 nm for the binary and ternary solar cells, respectively. An ultra-thin conjugated poly-electrolyte-poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) layer was deposited by spin casting from a 0.02% (w/v) solution in methanol (from 2000 rpm for 30 s). Finally, Al (∼80 nm) was evaporated with a shadow mask as the top electrode. The effective area was measured to be 16 mm2.
Characterization and measurement
The PCEs were determined from J–V characteristics measured by a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under an AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). Masks made from laser beam cutting technology with a well-defined area of 0.16 cm2 were attached to define the effective area for accurate measurement. Solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the blends' surface morphology were conducted on a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument). External quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the encapsulated devices were measured using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan, China) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
As seen in Fig. 2, the maximum absorption peak of DPPEZnP-O is at 810 nm with an absorption edge in the near infrared region of 900 nm, and that of PTB7 is at 680 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of DPPEZnP-O showing an absorption valley at 680 nm. Therefore, the incorporation of DPPEZnP-O can enhance the absorption of PTB7/PC71BM from 750 to 900 nm and slightly decrease the absorption from 650 to 700 nm, and the better spectroscopic response coverage of the ternary blends makes it possible to harvest more photons in the visible and near infrared region and generate more charges in the ternary devices.

The J–V curves and the photovoltaic parameters of ternary solar cells with different PTB7:DPPEZnP-O weight ratios (0, 10, 20, 30 and 100% of DPPEZnP-O) are shown and summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 1. After the incorporation of DPPEZnP-O, the Jsc values of the ternary OSCs are enhanced remarkably with the maximum at 20% DPPEZnP-O. As seen in Table 1, the Voc values of these ternary OSCs are dominated by PTB7, and slightly decreased after the incorporation of DPPEZnP-O, indicating that both the donor materials collect holes and DPPEZnP-O plays a bridge role between PTB7 and PC71BM because the three materials form cascade LUMO energy levels (Fig. S1†) for more effective electron extraction from PTB7.31,32,35,45 Namely, the photo-excited electrons from PTB7 can transfer to either PC71BM or DPPEZnP-O, and the electrons from DPPEZnP-O can also subsequently transfer to PC71BM.20 The FF values are almost insensitive to the DPPEZnP-O incorporation when the DPPEZnP-O is less than 20%. However, further increasing DPPEZnP-O to 30% decreases the FF obviously. Therefore, compared to the PTB7:PC71BM binary solar cells, which show a PCE of 7.47% with a Jsc of 14.99 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V and a FF of 67.41%, the ternary devices with 20% DPPEZnP-O incorporation exhibit an improved PCE of 8.39% with Jsc = 17.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V and FF = 67.65%, which is a 12% enhancement in PCE. The Jsc values of the binary and ternary solar cell devices integrated from the EQE spectra are 14.88 and 17.10 mA cm−2, respectively, which are very close to values from the J–V measurements.

As seen in Fig. 4 and S3,† the EQE curves are similar to the corresponding absorption spectra of the ternary blends, and DPPEZnP-O in PTB7:PC71BM enhances the photocurrent in the NIR region, indicating that DPPEZnP-O contributes to photocurrent generation. In addition, the EQE values are decreased very slightly in PTB7's main absorption region from 600 to 700 nm even when DPPEZnP-O content is up to 20%. One possible reason is that the charge transfer at the D/A interfaces is facilitated by DPPEZnP-O due to the bridging effect of DPPEZnP-O between PTB7 and DPPEZnP-O.29,42 The hole mobilities of the blend films were measured in the dark by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Al.26,47 As shown in Fig. 5, the ternary blend films containing 20% DPPEZnP-O exhibit a higher hole mobility of 3.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the binary ones of PTB7/PC71BM show a lower hole mobility of 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher hole mobility is beneficial for the charge transport, which can contribute to the higher Jsc for the ternary solar cells.

The solar cells with PTB7 as the donor and DPPEZnP-O as the acceptor in a ratio of 1:1 exhibit a PCE of 0.03% with Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 0.13 mA cm−2 and FF = 24.27% (Fig. S4†), demonstrating the charge separation between PTB7 and DPPEZnP-O. Also, a moderate PCE of 5.62% is achieved for the OSCs based on DPPEZnP-O and PC71BM as the active layer (Table 1), which is lower than that based on DPPEZnP-O and PC61BM.46 Therefore, it can be concluded that electrons can transfer from PTB7 to DPPEZnP-O and finally to PC71BM. Furthermore, the photoluminescence of PTB7 can be efficiently quenched by DPPEZnP-O and PC71BM (Fig. S5†), further supporting the idea that electrons transfer from PTB7 to PC71BM via DPPEZnP-O in the ternary blend films.
To gain insight into the effect of DPPEZnP-O incorporation on the photocurrent and exciton dissociation process of the solar cells, we determined the variation of saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) and charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T) of the PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5) and PTB7:DPPEZnP-O:PC71BM (0.8:0.2:1.5) devices.48Fig. 6 shows photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves for the solar cells. Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. For Veff = Vo − Va, Vo is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.49 For the optimized binary and ternary devices in this study, Jph has a nearly linear dependence on the voltage at a low value of Veff, and Jph reaches saturation rapidly when the effective voltage Veff arrives at a relatively low voltage of 2 V which suggests that the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and very efficient processes of charge carrier collection have been obtained. Generally, it is assumed that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at high Veff (Veff = 2 V in this case), and the saturation current density Jsat will only be dependent on the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax). Therefore, Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer.50 The Gmax values calculated by the formula for the optimized binary and ternary devices were 9.42 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 158.2 A m−2 for binary device) and 1.07 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 180.1 A m−2 for ternary device), respectively. The increased Gmax indicates more excitons generated in the ternary devices. Furthermore, the charge collection probabilities P(E,T), which can be assessed by the Jph/Jsat ratios under short circuit conditions, are 95% and 96% for the binary and ternary devices, respectively, demonstrating that the charge collection in the ternary BHJ solar cells can be as efficient as in the binary BHJ solar cells.

In order to investigate the impacts of DPPEZnP-O on the charge recombination process of the ternary OSCs, we measured the J–V curves of the optimized PTB7:PC71BM binary and PTB7:DPPEZnP-O:PC71BM ternary devices under light intensities from 10 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2, which are illustrated in Fig. S6 and S7.† In principle, Jsc shows a power-law dependence on light intensity for organic solar cells, which can be expressed as Jsc ∝ (Plight)S (Plight is light intensity and S is the exponential factor).51,52 Weak bimolecular recombination in the device would result in a linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity with the S value close to 1. As seen in Fig. 7, both the binary and ternary devices show a parallel linear dependence of Jsc to the light intensity with slopes close to 1.0, demonstrating that adding 20% DPPEZnP-O to the PTB7:PC71BM blend system does not form a recombination center to suppress the charge transport process unlike in many other cases.53,54

Nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks in an active layer are vital to efficiently separate excitons and form percolating channels for charge carrier transport. As seen in Fig. 8 and S8,† the AFM height images (top) and phase images (bottom) of the binary blends of PTB7:PC71BM (0% DPPEZnP-O) and DPPEZnP-O:PC71BM (100% DPPEZnP-O) and 20% DPPEZnP-O ternary blend films show similar phase-separation sizes with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.43, 2.02 and 1.82 nm, respectively. But the RMS roughness is obviously increased to 3.75 nm when 30% DPPEZnP-O is incorporated. It can be seen from the phase images that the phase separation sizes are much larger for the films with 30% DPPEZnP-O than those with 20% DPPEZnP-O, and the larger scale phase separation in the 30% DPPEZnP-O ternary blends reduces the D/A interfaces and is not favorable for charge dissociation, leading to smaller Jsc, FF, EQE and PCE.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we successfully developed a ternary system by introducing a low band gap material of DPPEZnP-O into a PTB7:PC71BM blend to improve the photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells. DPPEZnP-O in the ternary OSCs not only shows complementary absorption and broadens light absorption to the near infrared region but also plays a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM to provide more charge transfer routes at D/A interfaces. By optimizing the ratio of DPPEZnP-O, an enhanced PCE of 8.39% is achieved with a Jsc of 17.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 67.65% for the ternary OSCs, demonstrating that ternary solar cells are promising for further improving the performance of binary ones.
