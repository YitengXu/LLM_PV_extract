From a broader perspective, despite molecular design, the suitability of a material for efficient devices is often only determined by trial and error in the device processing laboratory. As shown by the data presented in this publication, promising materials found to be unsuitable for device applications may suffer from highly dilute impurities that act to increase carrier recombination.
Introduction
Solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells are of intense academic and industrial interest due to their potential as economically viable energy sources with unique properties.1,2 The majority of reports in the scientific literature use narrow band gap conjugated polymers as the donor phase in combination with a fullerene acceptor phase.3–6 We note, however, that the statistical nature of polymerization reactions leads to variability in the molecular weight characteristics and ultimately in the device performance.7–10 Furthermore, polymer purification techniques are limited, making the removal of impurities challenging.11–13 In response, well-defined narrow band gap organic molecules have thus been designed for use in solar cells.14–23
A promising new class of molecular materials has recently been disclosed that is built upon the [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PT) acceptor unit.22,23 We have utilized one such derivative, namely 5,5′-bis{(4-(7-(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl))thiophen-2-yl)[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222) as a donor molecule to make high performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The molecular structure of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 is shown in Fig. 1, where ‘p’ refers to the pyridal N-atoms in a position proximal to the central DTS core. Small-molecule solar cells fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as the acceptor resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼7%.23 Appropriate use of solvent additives to control the morphology of the BHJ layer is necessary to obtain such a high PCE value. The BHJ performance is found to be very sensitive to the processing conditions and to the concentration of the diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive, as is described in detail below.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of donor and acceptor components that comprise the BHJ active layer. 
Chemical impurities in donor and/or the acceptor materials are expected to influence the BHJ properties in a variety of ways.12,24 For example, electrically active impurities can decrease the carrier mobility and function as traps that increase the probability of charge recombination. As a result, the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) are reduced, leading to significant decrease in the PCE. Impurities can also be chemically reactive and limit device lifetime. Additionally, the nanomorphology of the BHJ blend and the structural order within the donor and acceptor phases can be perturbed resulting in defects and inclusions.
Without proper elimination of impurities, it is not possible to gauge the full potential of new materials, thus leading to imprecise understanding of how molecular structure influences device function. Indeed, studies have appeared which have introduced specific dopants such as TCNQ25 and PC84BM26,27 into the BHJ blend to model the effects of possible impurities. In the well-studied case of PC84BM, the loss mechanism was attributed to trap-assisted recombination. For example, electron traps close to the BHJ interface can enable first-order (monomolecular) recombination with mobile holes in the donor, leading to loss of both carriers.
In this contribution, we demonstrate how trace impurities in samples of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 significantly influence photovoltaic properties, and provide physical reasons for the limitations through charge generation and recombination studies. These organic impurities are the result of transmetalation side-reactions in the Stille-cross coupling procedures used to synthesize ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 and are hard to observe by virtue of the similarity in structure to ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222. Even at concentrations that are difficult to detect (e.g. <1%); the impurity can significantly reduce the performance of the BHJ blend. Overall, these studies should heighten awareness that contamination may be present in “well-defined” donor materials and that these imperfections can lead to disappointing device performance.
Results and discussion
Identification of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22)
While studying the photovoltaic performance of pp-DTS(PTTh22)22:PC70BM, some batches of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 provided inferior PCEs when used in devices. Routine examination by 1H NMR spectroscopy did not reveal any significant difference in purity between samples. For example, Fig. 2a shows the 1H NMR spectra of two samples of DTS(PTTh22)22 made in a similar fashion. The two spectra are nearly identical, but the top spectrum (red) represents a ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 batch (1) that yields devices with PCE = 6.5%, while the bottom spectra (green) represents a ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 batch (2) that yields devices with PCE = 3.0%. Further investigation by low-resolution field desorption (LRFD) mass spectra (Fig. 2b) showed that ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 1 gives rise to peaks at m/z = 1184 and 592 for the M+ and M2+ ions, respectively, while the ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 2 gives rise to an additional peak at m/z = 950. This peak could not be assigned to fragmentation and clearly identifies the presence of an additional species. Based upon its molecular weight, this species was identified as the methyl-terminated small molecule (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) (see Fig. 3). It is important to highlight here that mass spectroscopy provides a more thorough characterization of impurities than 1H NMR spectroscopy because of its greater sensitivity.

 Fig. 3  Synthetic scheme showing the formation of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 and the methyl-terminated organic by-product (MePT)DTS(PTTh22). 
The compound (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) is generated as a by-product during the formation of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 due to the nature of the reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, the final step in the preparation of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 involves end capping of the Br-PT-DTS-PT-Br core with 2-hexylbithiophene units via a microwave-assisted Stille cross coupling reaction. Here, methyl transfer instead of 2-hexylbithiophene transfer can occur, leading to the formation of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22). While the rate of alkyl transfer vs. aryl transfer during the Stille coupling procedure is typically quite low,28–30 we anticipate that the high temperatures (160 °C) and microwave conditions of the reaction enable the formation of this by-product. Indeed, performing the reaction at the higher temperature of 175 °C leads to an increased formation (ca. 2 mol%) of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) which is at high enough concentration to be easily detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Although (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) is difficult to separate from the ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 product via column chromatography, it is readily extracted using hexanes solvent to give absolute ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222. This purification step was important to achieving higher performance in BHJ solar cells made from ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222.
Photovoltaic device performance
Photovoltaic properties were investigated using the following architecture: glass|ITO|molybdenum oxide (MoOx)|ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM (7:3 wt ratio)|Al. Active layers were solution deposited from chlorobenzene and 0.25% v/v DIO additive.23 Typical current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices fabricated with pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1) and with trace concentrations of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) (sample 2) under white light illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4a. The BHJ cell based on sample 1 of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 has Jsc = 14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.77 V and FF = 60%, leading to a PCE = 6.5%. In contrast all the relevant device parameters (Jsc = 10.39 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V and FF = 39%) obtained using sample 2 in the BHJ active layer are lower.

Active layer processed from 4% wt/v chlorobenzene solutions with 0.25% v/v diiodoctane used as a processing additive. Donor:acceptor ratio = 70:30. Red curves (PCE = 6.5%) represent data using pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1) while green curves (PCE = 3.0%) represent data obtained using contaminated ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 2). IPCE spectra of (c) pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1) and (d) contaminated ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 2) with and without background illumination (light bias of 66.85 mW cm−2). 
Clearly, the presence of small amounts of the organic by-product (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) has a major adverse effect in the device performance, causing a ∼50% reduction in efficiency. We note that the photovoltaic performance using the impure material is always lower regardless of the concentration of DIO additive. Dark current analysis (Fig. S3, ESI†) also corroborates the above findings, showing an increase in series resistance by a factor of 2 and a decrease in shunt resistance by factor of 6 for the devices fabricated with sample 2. The rectification ratio is also one order of magnitude lower for the device made with impure material. The ideality factor, n, increases from 1.65 to 1.80, an indication of enhanced recombination loss.
The effect on Jsc can also be observed from the incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4b), which shows a large decrease in current generation over the entire wavelength range. The broad absorption feature between 400 and 700 nm originates from the donor molecule, contributing a large fraction of the photocurrent. An important feature in the absorption spectra (Fig. 4b) is the slightly less resolved vibronic peak at around 710 nm for films with (MePT)DTS(PTTh22), possibly signifying a higher degree of disorder in the blend film. Structural defects such as twisting of the aromatic chain backbone and coiling in polymer chains are known to create high trap densities and diminish performance.31,32 To check for evidence of such disorder, field-effect transistors comprising the two compounds were fabricated (Fig. S4, ESI†). The (MePT)DTS(PTTh22)-containing transistor was found to have a lower hole mobility by a factor of 3 (0.14 vs. 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1) and significantly higher negative threshold voltage (−7.3 vs. −16.8 V), indicating poorer charge transport and higher interfacial trap density.
Trap states within the band gap can alter the built-in field in the BHJ and the carrier mobility and thereby diminish the carrier sweep-out rate to the electrodes, ultimately leading to decreases in Jsc and IPCE. In addition, the traps states within the energy gap can enhance the probability of carrier recombination. Accordingly, we examined the evolution of the IPCE spectra with background illumination (light bias); Fig. 4c and d. For the devices fabricated with pure donor (sample 1), light bias has a negligible effect on the measured IPCE spectra (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the IPCE spectra of the devices fabricated with contaminated donor (sample 2) decreased significantly under white light bias (Fig. 4d). Under light bias, where there is a higher density of photogenerated carriers, the trap sites in the impure film are more easily filled; thereby increasing the probability of mobile charge carrier recombination.33–35
Recombination dynamics: limitation in Voc and Jsc
The dependence of Voc on the logarithm of the light intensity describes the order of the recombination processes in the BHJ film.36,37 For bimolecular recombination, the semi-logarithmic plot of Voc depends linearly on the light intensity with a slope of kT/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant, q the elementary charge and T temperature; a phenomenon commonly observed in polymer–fullerene blends.37,38 It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the impure device (based on ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 2) has a stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity, with a slope of 1.50 kT/q, as compared to 1.24 kT/q for the higher purity device (ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 1). The stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope greater than kT/q has been observed by many others25,26,39–41 and explained in terms of energetic disorder, deep trap levels and the additional mechanism of trap-assisted recombination. Trap-assisted recombination can be characterized by recombination of mobile charge with a trapped carrier, and hence can be considered a first-order process with respect to the density of mobile charges. Recently, Blakesley and Neher have included energetic disorder into a model which derives the Voc equation and also predicts such nonideal behaviour.42 These data provide a clear indication that the impurity-induced traps or defects reduce Voc, and that trap-assisted recombination governs the loss mechanism.

The hypothesis that the impurity increases the amount of first-order recombination is further supported by the results of the transient absorption measurement at different pump intensities. Fig. 6 plots the integrated photoinduced absorption between 850 and 1000 nm as function of the time delay between pump (400 nm) and probe pulses. This feature is taken as a signature of the holes in ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222.43 Similar features are seen in systems with electron donating polymers.44Fig. 6a shows a lower signal level for the impure film at long timescales for the lowest pump fluence (38 μJ cm−2) studied. This indicates that the density of holes in the impure film is lower and the likelihood of recombination is greater in the impure film.
 Fig. 6  Photoinduced absorption dynamics of blended films containing pure and impure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1 and 2 respectively) and PC70BM. For better signal to noise ratio, the photoinduced absorption was integrated from 850 to 1000 nm. Measurements were conducted at (a) a lower excitation fluence of 38 μJ cm−2 and (b) a higher excitation fluence of 76 μJ cm−2. 
In contrast, differences between the films in Fig. 6b at higher fluences (78 μJ cm−2) are more subtle. This observation is also consistent with reports of carrier density dependence of recombination mechanisms. At higher incident light intensity, first-order recombination pathways are less significant in comparison with bimolecular and other higher order recombination types.26,45 Therfore, the results indicate the films differ primarily in the amount of first-order recombination they exhibit, as their differences are more obvious at low pump fluence.
While trace organic impunities can act as localized hole trap sites, we have estimated the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) and found them to be similar, within 0.1 eV when compared to ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The similar electronic energy levels makes it unlikely that (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) can act as a hole trap site, and points towards additional charge trapping mechanisms (for example, structural defect states in donor crystalline domains or unoptimized morphology with isolated molecules acting as traps).
Nano-crystalline morphology
As previously demonstrated, the population of crystallites oriented in-plane with a d-spacing of approximately 2 nm are readily imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).23 A comparison of the nano-morphologies from the pure and impure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM blend films cast with 0.25% v/v DIO is shown in Fig. 7. The presence of trace amounts of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) seems to lead to an increase in the observed feature size on the order of 30%. While we do not know the change in the total crystallinity of the films, the increase in feature size (Fig. S6–8, ESI†) has been linked to poor performance23 and, based on the previous findings of trap-assisted recombination, the existence of domain sizes on the order 30–40 nm are unfavourable for efficient device operation. In addition, the inclusion of impurities into the crystallites could disturb crystal quality and degrade the phase purity of the donor.

An approximately −1 μm defocus is used to show lattice planes (∼2 nm d-spacing) corresponding to the donor molecule. These crystalline regions were darkened to provide additional contrast. The scale bar is 100 nm. 
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that trace impurities in BHJ solar cells fabricated from different batches of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 significantly influence the photovoltaic properties. All the relevant device parameters (Jsc, Voc and FF) obtained using material containing even trace amounts of (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) in the BHJ active layer are significantly reduced. Clearly, the presence of small amounts of the organic by-product (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) negatively affects device performance, causing a ∼50% reduction in efficiency. We have suggested physical reasons for these reductions through charge generation and recombination studies.
The impurity (MePT)DTS(PTTh22) arises from incomplete selectivity in the transmetalation steps in the Stille-cross coupling catalytic cycles and it is difficult to detect using routine characterization tools by virtue of its structural similarity to ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222. Even at concentrations that are difficult to detect (e.g.<1%), the impurity can significantly reduce the performance of the BHJ blend. Overall, these studies should heighten awareness that contamination may be present in “well-defined” donor materials and that these imperfections can lead to disappointing device performance.
In making devices from newly synthesized materials, initial tests showing absorption, fluorescence, energy levels and conductivity are indicative of promise alone. The true test of material suitability is often a direct measurement of its performance in a solar cell after extensive optimization. Why are initially promising donor materials often found to be unsuitable for device applications? As shown by the data presented in this study, impurities that are highly dilute and nearly isostructural to one of the BHJ components can act to increase carrier recombination, impact nanomorphology and degrade solar cell performance. These impurities can be eliminated via further purification processes, resulting in increased cell performance. It is interesting to speculate that some of the performances of devices comprising small-molecule donor reported in the literature may underestimate the full potential of the materials due to remaining trace impurities from synthesis.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of donor and acceptor components that comprise the BHJ active layer.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The 1H NMR spectra of two samples of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 in CHCl3. The top red trace (sample 1) yields PCE = 6.5% while the bottom green trace (sample 2) yields PCE = 3%. (b) Low-resolution field desorption LRFD mass spectra of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 1 (left, red trace) showing the M+ ion with m/z = 1184 and M2+ ion with m/z = 592, and ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 sample 2 (right, green trace) showing an additional peak (M+ ion) with m/z = 950.	 

 	Fig. 3  Synthetic scheme showing the formation of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 and the methyl-terminated organic by-product (MePT)DTS(PTTh22).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and (b) incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells with architecture ITO|molybdenum oxide (MoOx)|ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM|Al and absorbance spectra of the same blend films. Active layer processed from 4% wt/v chlorobenzene solutions with 0.25% v/v diiodoctane used as a processing additive. Donor:acceptor ratio = 70:30. Red curves (PCE = 6.5%) represent data using pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1) while green curves (PCE = 3.0%) represent data obtained using contaminated ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 2). IPCE spectra of (c) pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1) and (d) contaminated ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 2) with and without background illumination (light bias of 66.85 mW cm−2).	 

 	Fig. 5  Illumination dependence of open circuit voltage (Voc) of ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM devices with pure (sample 1) and impure (sample 2) ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222. The dashed lines represent the best fits to the data, for which the slope is indicated.	 

 	Fig. 6  Photoinduced absorption dynamics of blended films containing pure and impure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222 (sample 1 and 2 respectively) and PC70BM. For better signal to noise ratio, the photoinduced absorption was integrated from 850 to 1000 nm. Measurements were conducted at (a) a lower excitation fluence of 38 μJ cm−2 and (b) a higher excitation fluence of 76 μJ cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 7  TEM images of BHJ films cast from (a) pure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM and (b) impure ppp-DTS(PTTh222)222:PC70BM. An approximately −1 μm defocus is used to show lattice planes (∼2 nm d-spacing) corresponding to the donor molecule. These crystalline regions were darkened to provide additional contrast. The scale bar is 100 nm.
