    , Accepted 3rd January 2014First published on 6th January 2014AbstractDiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) containing copolymers have gained a lot of interest in organic optoelectronics with great potential in organic photovoltaics. In this work, DPP based statistical copolymers, with slightly different bandgap energies and a varying fraction of donor–acceptor ratio are investigated using monochromatic photocurrent spectroscopy and Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS). The statistical copolymer with a lower DPP fraction, when blended with a fullerene derivative, shows the signature of an inter charge transfer complex state in photocurrent spectroscopy. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the blended sample with a lower DPP fraction is seen to change as a function of an external bias, qualitatively similar to the quantum confined Stark effect, from where we estimate the exciton binding energy. The statistical copolymer with a higher DPP fraction shows no signal of the inter charge transfer states and yields a higher external quantum efficiency in a photovoltaic structure. In order to gain insight into the origin of the observed charge transfer transitions, we present theoretical studies using density-functional theory and time-dependent density-functional theory for the two pristine DPP based statistical monomers.
Introduction
Over the past two decades, extensive research has focused on optimizing the performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Major breakthroughs with efficiencies reaching over 10% have been reported in the last few years.1–3 Synthesis of low bandgap4,5 and organometallic polymers,6,7 tandem cell architectures,8,9 and controlled interfacial separations to match exciton diffusion lengths (few tens of nanometers),10 have resulted in improved efficiencies in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Most BHJs use a polymer–fullerene blend as an active layer, where the absorption mainly takes place within the donor polymer. It is further found that replacing the fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenylC61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), with [6,6]-phenylC71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), enhances the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs11 since the electronic transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is allowed in a C70 molecule, enhancing the process of absorption of light within the acceptor molecule in polymer:PC71BM systems.
Achieving stable, low bandgap and enhanced molecular packing of conjugated polymeric semiconductors has been the name of the game for an improved performance of organic optoelectronics. The design of systems incorporating both donor and acceptor chromophore in the same chain is of particular interest for applications in field-effect transistors and OPVs since they have a high degree of tunability of their electronic and optical properties. Several studies incorporating donor–acceptor (D–A) and donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) units in oligomers/polymers have reported improved efficiencies in OPVs.12–16 A special class of copolymers, statistical copolymers based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has shown applicability in optoelectronic devices. These copolymers have been designed to alter their bandgap17 and tune the morphology for controlling phase segregation.18,19 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) containing copolymers have been used as high performance industrial pigments due to their thermal and photostability, and have recently gained a lot of interest for application in organic optoelectronics.20–26 DPP-based low bandgap materials are not just useful for device applications but are designed to achieve environmentally stable organic semiconductors.27
A central role in the photovoltaic process for OPVs is played by charge transfer (CT) complexes, which are intermediate steps between exciton dissociation at the heterointerface and free charge generation. The organic PV process thus constitutes conversion of solar photons into excitons, exciton diffusion in the donor polymer, formation of CT states, and dissociation of exciton into free charge carriers. A series of recent reports show that the CT states are formed deep inside the optical gap of the polymer–fullerene constituents.28–31 Although many recent studies show clear evidence of CT states governing the voltage dependent and independent photocurrent32,33 as well as the open circuit voltage (Voc),34 the exact role of inter CT states in controlling PCE is still debated.35 Our recent work on DPP:PCBM blends shows that the stabilization of the inter CT states critically depends on the overall energy difference between the singlet energy (S1) of the donor DPP copolymer and PCBM.36
A large discrepancy is observed between the experimental lifetimes (∼100 ns)37,38 and theoretical predictions of CT lifetimes (∼μs to ms).32,39,40 A recent study by Bakulin et al. shows that the driving energy for the charge separation in organic PVs occurs through the formation of excited, delocalized band states, which are typically extremely short lived (<1 ps).41 Apart from the estimation of the lifetime of CT states, emphasis has also been placed on the dissociation efficiency of the CT states. Yamamoto et al. have shown almost instantaneous formation of CT states from the singlet states, and have calculated the dissociation efficiency to be 70%.42 A lower dissociation efficiency compared to that of P3HT:PCBM and the formation of a stable bound CT state is shown to inhibit the generation of free charge carriers.35,43
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published study on the CT states in pristine statistical copolymer or statistical copolymer–acceptor systems. Here, we investigate the optical properties of two benzothiadiazole and carbazole-based statistical copolymers of DPP. The two DPP based statistical copolymers differ in their bandgap energies and in the donor–acceptor fraction within the copolymer. The photocurrent (PC) was measured using Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) and monochromatic PC in pristine DPP and DPP:fullerene blends. To ensure that the PC in the blends is only affected by absorption in the donor DPP polymer, we used PC61BM as the acceptor for all samples. We associate the observation of a low energy onset of PC (compared to the absorption spectrum) to the presence of inter CT states. To correlate the inter CT states to the magnitude of PC/responsivity, electric field-dependent absorption studies were carried out. One of the copolymers shows the signature of a quantum confined Stark effect, which further helps in the estimation of the intra CT exciton binding energy. Furthermore, we present theoretical studies using density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for the two pristine DPP based statistical monomers.
Experimental
Synthesis of statistical copolymers Poly A and Poly B
The synthesis of the statistical copolymers is as follows: for Poly A, 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9-(1-hexylheptyl)-9H-carbazole (1), (0.200 g, 0.33 mmol), 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole (0.073 g, 0.24 mmol) and 3,6-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di-n-hexyl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (3) (0.052 g, 0.083 mmol), Aliquat 336 (2 drops), K2CO3 (0.276 g, 1.99 mmol), toluene (10 mL) and water (1 mL) were placed together in a round bottom flask and purged with argon for 20 min followed by addition of Pd(PPh3)4 (13 mg, 0.011 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C under vigorous stirring for 72 h. Then it was poured into a mixture of methanol and 2.0 M HCl (1:1, 300 mL) and filtered. The resulting polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and hexane. The polymer was re-dissolved in minimum amount of chloroform and precipitated from methanol and dried in vacuum. Yield = 0.180 g (76%). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis shows that the polymer has Mn of 12300 g mol−1, Mw of 24600 g mol−1 (against polystyrene standard). For Poly A: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 9.10 (br, 1H); 8.41–7.61 (m, 8H); 4.74 (br, 1H); 4.21 (br, 1H); 2.43 (br, 2H); 2.04–1.88 (br, 3H); 1.40–1.19 (m, 22H); 0.94 (m, 2H); 0.79 (m, 6H).
Similarly, Poly B was synthesized using 1 eq. of monomer (1) with 0.5 eq. of monomer (2) and (3) each. The molecular weight was found to be Mn = 8520 g mol−1 and Mw = 13400 g mol−1. For Poly B: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 9.09 (br, 1H); 8.40–7.60 (m, 8H); 4.65 (br, 1H); 4.20 (br, 2H); 2.35 (2H); 2.04–1.87 (br, 3H) 1.39–1.17 (m, 19H); 0.93 (m, 3H); 0.79 (m, 6H). The feed ratios (of 1:3 and 1:1) in the resulting polymer were confirmed by the ratio of intensity of N–CH (carbazole) and N–CH2 of the DPP unit (see ESI†).
Sample and device fabrication
For absorption measurements, thin films were prepared by spin coating the polymer–dichlorobenzene solution on glass substrates. For devices, ITO covered glass substrates were first cleaned using aqua regia and then organic cleaned. A filtered (using polyvinyl difluoride 0.45 μm) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) solution was spun cast onto the cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate and then baked at 100 °C for 25 min under a N2 atmosphere. Next, a layer of the donor copolymer or copolymer:PCBM (1:1) blend was spin coated on the substrate at 700 rpm and baked at 100 °C for 10 min. A Ca–Al electrode layer was thermally evaporated after which the devices were encapsulated. The fabrication of the device was done in a N2 filled glove box.
Absorption, FTPS and monochromatic PC setup
The absorption was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC using the absorption setting with glass as a reference sample. The light source is a halogen lamp for the visible region and a deuterium lamp for the ultra-violet region while the detector is a photomultiplier R-928. When the absorption was measured from the device structures, the reference sample had exactly the same thickness of glass, ITO, PEDOT–PSS, and Ca/Al layers.
Incident light from a 100 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp dispersed through a monochromator was chopped using a mechanical chopper for the monochromatic PC measurements. The PC was measured using a lock-in amplifier coupled to the chopper. For FTPS PC, the incident light from an inbuilt tungsten lamp of a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer was focused onto a device. The response from the device was amplified using a preamplifier and fed back to the FTIR. The Fourier transform of the response yielded the overall photocurrent with respect to the incident photon energy. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the responsivity were obtained by normalizing the measured PC to the response from a calibrated Si DET110 detector.
Results and discussion
Absorption and photocurrent spectra of Poly A and Poly B films
The absorption spectra from spin cast films of the two statistical copolymers are shown in Fig. 1(a). A slightly lower optical bandgap of Poly B can be attributed to the narrow polydispersity, despite its lower molecular weight.44 The DPP statistical polymers show the π–π* transition in the high energy region (above 2.5 eV) and an intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) in the low energy region (1.5–2.5 eV). The ICT refers to the charge transfer state where the charge separation is limited to within the same polymer chain. The formation of the ICT stabilizes the donor–acceptor complexes covalently bound along the polymer backbone.45 For the copolymer with a higher DPP concentration (Poly B), the ICT absorption (1.5–2.25 eV) is higher compared to the 2.5–4 eV region.

Fig. 1(b) shows plots of the photocurrent (responsivity) of the pristine polymers, Poly A and B. For these measurements, devices were fabricated by sandwiching the polymer films between ITO and Ca/Al electrodes without using any PCBM. The responsivity is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power incident on the sample. To estimate the responsivity, the photocurrent was measured from the device under study and then divided by the lamp power calculated using a calibrated Si detector. Since the device photocurrent and lamp power are measured using the same setup, the responsivity is independent of the setup used. We note that the responsivity is only for the ICT region and it is clearly higher for Poly B compared to Poly A.
Photocurrent and absorption results: DPP statistical copolymers with PCBM
The photocurrent spectra from pristine and blended samples were measured using FTPS and monochromatic PC. FTPS has been shown to be a sensitive tool for the measurement of sub-bandgap features in amorphous Si46 and organic solar cells.34,47 The lowest inter-molecular CT states in P3HT:PCBM have been measured by various groups using FTPS, and more recently, we have shown the signature of such low energy states in other DPP copolymer:PCBM based BHJs using photocurrent techniques.36 Here, the inter-molecular CT (or simply CT state) state indicates the transfer of the negative charge to the PCBM acceptor unit, while the positive charge resides on donor chains. The statistical copolymers used here allow varying the concentration of the DPP core, yielding an additional tuning parameter to study the nature of the intra-charge transfer within the polymer. As shown in Scheme 1, the Poly A copolymer has a lower DPP concentration per monomer unit compared to Poly B.

The normalized absorption and responsivity of the two statistical copolymers blended with PCBM (1:1) are shown in Fig. 2. The normalized absorption spectra were recorded by normalizing the spectrum to the maximum intensity of the donor absorption. Similar to the DPP-BBT based copolymers, discussed in ref. 36, the PC spectrum mostly follows the absorption spectrum. A lower energy onset of PC compared to the absorption spectrum in Poly A:PCBM is an indication of the presence of inter-molecular CT states in this sample. The onset of absorption and responsivity in Poly B:PCBM (1:1) is not significantly different, from which we conclude the absence of any low energy CT state in Poly B:PCBM (using photocurrent spectroscopy). We further note that the responsivity of Poly B:PCBM is an order of magnitude higher than in Poly A:PCBM. In terms of the EQE, Poly B:PCBM shows ∼31% at 1.8 eV while Poly A:PCBM shows an order of magnitude lower with 1.5% at 1.8 eV.

For further confirmation of the CT states, we measured the FTPS from Poly A:PCBM. The FTPS spectrum of Poly A:PCBM clearly shows a weak absorption feature lower in energy compared to the regular absorption spectrum, as plotted in Fig. 3. This low energy feature signals the presence of a mid-gap CT state, similar to the PC spectrum (Fig. 2(a)), in the Poly A:PCBM blended sample. The low energy contribution to PC was fitted using Marcus fit given by, (1)where ECT is the energy of the CT state, λ is the reorganization energy fixed at 0.25 eV, E is the incident photon energy, kT at room temperature is 25 meV and a and b are fitting constants.48 The onset of the CT state from a fit to monochromatic PC is ∼1.45 eV and from a fit to the FTPS PC is ∼1.36 eV. We note that the FTPS spectrum of Poly B:PCBM does not show a low energy edge, similar to the monochromatic PC results, signaling the absence of any CT states.

Electric field-dependent absorption
Since Poly A:PCBM samples show a signature of the inter-CT states in PC, which in turn may be facilitated by the inherent intra CT states within the donor polymer, we probe the absorption spectra of pristine and blended films of Poly A as a function of the electric field. We point out that the electric field dependence of the optical absorption in inorganic semiconductor based quantum well structures was a key to observing the quantum confined Stark effect.49 A similar exciton confinement was also observed by tracking the changes in the peak position of absorption in multiple quantum well structures of alternate layers of PTCDA (3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride) and NTCDSA (3,4,7,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride) organic crystals.50 The confinement is the result of the heterojunction formed at the PTCDA/NTCDA interface. In our case, the band offset at the copolymer–fullerene interface could confine the CT exciton. Since OPVs are essentially type II heterojunction, the DPP copolymers provide a nice platform for observing changes to the absorption edge (of the intra CT peak), similar to quantum wells. Moreover, one may be able to estimate the binding energy of the CT exciton from changes in the absorption spectrum as a function of the electric field. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra from a pristine Poly A device with a back electrode. The absorption was measured as a function of bias voltage as well; no changes were observed.
 Fig. 4  The absorption spectra from the pristine Poly A device in the presence of an external bias 0 to −9 V. 
The absorption spectra from a Poly A:PCBM device are shown in Fig. 5(a). Unlike the pristine sample, where there is no change in the absorption spectrum even in the presence of a high reverse bias, the onset of the absorption in the blended sample red shifts with the application of a negative bias. No significant changes in the absorption spectrum are detected beyond −5 V (Fig. 5(a), inset). Comparing Fig. 4 and 5(a), it is clear that the presence of PCBM in the Poly A:PCBM blended film results in the observable changes with the application of an external bias. Since Poly A:PCBM films show the presence of a stable CT state, it is conceivable that the external bias affects the low lying energy states in the blend but not in the pristine sample.

The intensity of the 1.9 eV peak in the absorption spectrum increases as the reverse bias is increased and saturates at ∼−5 V. Along with the changes in the intensity, the onset of the ICT peak (at 1.67 eV) redshifts with an increase in bias (reverse) voltage (Fig. 5(b)). No changes are observed beyond −5 V, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). Our observations are similar to quantum wells and porous Si,51 where a red shift of the absorption edge and an increase in the absorption coefficient with an external bias applied perpendicular to the growth direction has been attributed to a quantum confined Stark effect. The saturation effect beyond −5 V allows estimation of the ICT exciton binding energy.
Assuming that the potential energy to separate the bound charge transfer pair is the same as the coulomb energy, the binding energy (BE) is given by52 (2)where Emax is the saturation field given by Emax ≈ |Vapplied|/L, rGP is the separation between the point like charges in the geminate pair, L is the film thickness, and ε is the dielectric of the medium ∼3.5, typical for most conjugated polymers. Using Emax = 5 V, L ≈ 100 nm, rGP ∼2.86 nm, the BE is estimated to be ∼0.143 eV. We point out that the onset of donor absorption (1.65–1.55 eV) is what changes as a function of the electric field. The low energy peak at 1.6 eV (which most likely arises from PCBM) does not change as a function of the applied bias. Since it is well established that a suitable acceptor is helpful in dissociating a bound charge pair, presence of PCBM results in a red shift of the absorption edge due to biasing. The BE of the ICT exciton of 0.143 eV lies within the 0.050–0.5 eV52,53 range found for other CT excitons.
In the Poly B:PCBM blended film, the absorption onset showed no change with an external bias. In other words, it implies that the quantum confined Stark effect is not strong enough in this heterojunction. This sample showed no inter CT state in PC either as seen in Fig. 2(b), pointing in the direction of weakly-bound charge pairs, which can further explain the higher responsivity in this sample compared to Poly A:PCBM. Our results therefore show that for an observation of a quantum confined Stark effect in organic bulk heterojunctions, a stabilized inter CT state is required. For a further understanding of the ICT states, ground state DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out from monomer units representing Poly A and Poly B.
DFT and TDDFT results
TDDFT54,55 is a universal approach for dynamical many-body problems which is formally exact, but requires approximations to account for dynamical exchange–correlation (xc) effects. The vast majority of applications of TDDFT are to calculate excitation energies of medium-sized and large molecules, with overall accuracies comparable to traditional ab initio wave function methods,56,57 but much better computational efficiencies. A full Hartree–Fock (HF) asymptotic behaviour of the exchange energy is required for charge-transfer excitations,58 especially if the donor–acceptor system is separated, as is usually the case in organic BHJs. A particularly attractive new class of xc functional is the so-called range-separated hybrid functional.59–61 The correct prediction of the ground state electronic properties is a further test of the implementation of the range separated hybrid xc functional.
The electronic and excitation energies of the statistical copolymers were computed using the Gaussian 09 package.62 Single monomer units of statistical copolymers were used to predict their electronic structure. Poly A was constructed with one carbazole-DPP unit and three carbazole-BT units, while Poly B was constructed with one carbazole-DPP unit and one carbazole-BT unit. Note that the molecular weight of Poly A is more than that of Poly B, so it is appropriate for Poly A to be longer than Poly B. As a preliminary check, we calculated the ground state charge distribution of the monomer unit (with DFT) for both statistical copolymers using the CAM-B3LYP range-separated functional. All systems were optimized using the CAM-B3LYP56 functional combined with the polarized 6-31G(d) basis set.

Fig. 6 and 7 show the HOMO–LUMO and the next lower (higher) molecular orbitals for Poly A and Poly B (monomers) obtained from ground state DFT calculations. For Poly A, the HOMO is distributed over the DPP–thiophene unit, similar to Poly B. The LUMO shows a different behavior for the two molecules; in Poly B, the LUMO shows hardly any charge density on the DPP core; however, the LUMO + 1 orbital mainly resides on the DPP core (Fig. 7). Although the molecular orbitals may not reflect the many-body system that arises from a superposition of single-particle excitations, there are clear differences in the spatial location of the electron and hole wavefunction in the two molecules. Poly B shows a higher extent of a charge transfer character. The ICT nature in Poly A (Fig. 6) is not as clear since there is a large overlap in the spatial extent of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Note that in these calculations, the three carbazole-BT units were attached to the thiophene end of the carbazole-DPP unit. DFT calculations of a slightly different monomer: three carbazole-BT units attached to the carbazole side of the carbazole-DPP unit yield similar results.

 Fig. 7  The HOMO–LUMO and the next higher molecular orbitals of Poly B monomer. The red and green represent the phase of the molecular orbital. 
The PC was also measured from the pristine samples, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The photo-responsivity of Poly B was almost twice the responsivity of Poly A. A higher intra CT character is most likely responsible for a higher PC and responsivity in pristine Poly B compared to pristine Poly A, which is consistent with the TDDFT results. Another goal of these calculations was to understand the origin of the lowest singlet state, for which we have estimated the absorptivity of the pristine monomers using TDDFT.
The calculated absorptivity, which shows the ICT state of the pristine monomers, is shown in Fig. 8. The calculations correctly predict the bandgap of Poly B to be lower than that of Poly A. The discrepancies between the calculated and observed spectra are mostly due to the usage of monomers for the calculations whilst the experimental data are obtained from polymer films. The strength of the excitation (for the lowest singlet) may be traced back to the individual molecular orbitals. In Poly B it is observed that ∼75% of the absorptivity results from a HOMO to LUMO-type transition whereas 25% is from HOMO − 1 to LUMO. On the other hand, 100% of the transition in Poly A results from a HOMO to LUMO type transition. The calculations presented here are a precursor to obtain the CT excitations when such monomers are in the vicinity of a fullerene molecule.

Conclusions
The spectral photocurrent characteristics of two benzothiadiazole and carbazole-based DPP-based statistical copolymers were studied in detail. Using FTPS and monochromatic PC, the mid-gap inter CT states were detected only in the statistical copolymer with a lower DPP content (Poly A:PCBM blended films). The energy of the inter CT state in Poly A:PCBM is ∼1.45 eV, while no inter CT states were detected in Poly B:PCBM using photocurrent spectroscopy. The statistical copolymers offer a platform for a variation in the donor–acceptor content within the monomer unit, and thus provide a tuning probe to correlate the energies and stability of the CT states. Electric field dependent absorption studies show changes in the absorption spectra in Poly A:PCBM as a function of an applied bias, signaling quantum confined Stark effect. A saturation effect is observed beyond |5 V|, allowing an estimation of the ICT exciton binding energy of ∼0.143 eV in Poly A. The statistical copolymer with a higher DPP content (Poly B) does not show any inter CT states when mixed with PCBM and shows no changes in the absorption as a function of the electric field, highlighting the weakly bound nature of the inter CT states. Our results therefore point in the direction that for the observation of a quantum confined Stark effect in organic bulk heterojunctions, a stabilized inter CT state is required. Furthermore, Poly B:PCBM which does not show any inter CT states in the PC spectrum shows an order of magnitude higher responsivity compared with Poly A:PCBM. The maximum EQE for Poly B:PCBM devices is 31% compared to 1.5% for Poly A:PCBM at 1.8 eV.
First principles DFT calculations of the monomer units of Poly A and Poly B show differences in the spatial extent of the HOMO–LUMO orbitals. The absorptivity calculations of the two monomers using TDDFT predict the bandgap of Poly B to be lower than that of Poly A, corroborating the absorption spectrum.
