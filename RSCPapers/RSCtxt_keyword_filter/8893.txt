    , Accepted 2nd February 2016First published on 5th February 2016AbstractFor perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs), one of the key issues with respect to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is the morphology control of the perovskite thin-films. In this study, an easily-accessible additive polyethylenimine (PEI) is utilized to tune the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. With addition of 1.00 wt% of PEI, the smoothness and crystallinity of the perovskite were greatly improved, which were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A summit PCE of 14.07% was achieved for the p-i-n type Pero-SC, indicating a 26% increase compared to those of the devices without the additive. Both photoluminescence (PL) and alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) analyses confirm the efficiency results after the addition of PEI. This study provides a low-cost polymer additive candidate for tuning the morphology of perovskite thin-films, and might be a new clue for the mass production of Pero-SCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) in the past few years have attracted a great deal of research attention. Compared with the silicon-based solar cells, Pero-SCs demonstrated comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a lower cost and a less complicated fabrication process.1–16 As the active layer in the Pero-SC devices, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are proven to be ideal photovoltaic materials because of their superior properties, such as a high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion, decent ambipolar charge mobility and small exciton binding energy.17–22 Because the PCE of the devices depends greatly on the quality of the perovskite thin-films, plenty of effort has been made on improving the smoothness and crystallinity of this photoabsorber. To date, two cardinal methods, the so-called two-step and one-step methods, have been established.8,22–24 As for the two-step method, a layer of lead halide is firstly deposited on the substrate and then exposed to an organic halide (e.g. methylamine iodine) atmosphere for perovskite growth.25 Based on this idea, many modified two-step methods have been developed26–28 and high quality films, which gave rise to high PCEs, have been successfully prepared.29
In comparison with the two-step method, the one-step method shows a simpler protocol, is solution processible and not so reliant on apparatus. When using the one-step method to prepare the perovskite thin-films, the smoothness and crystallinity often show a tradeoff, i.e. high smoothness and high crystallinity are not easy to obtain concurrently.22,24 Many efforts, such as solvent selection for the perovskite precursor,30 temperature and durations of thermal annealing,31 solvent engineering,32 and solvent annealing,33–35 have been made to adjust the key parameters related to the crystal-growth of perovskites. In addition, introducing additives into the photoabsorber layer, a strategy that is often used in organic solar cells to improve the donor–acceptor phases, was applied to Pero-SCs. To date, several kinds of additives have been employed to control the morphology and crystallinity of perovskites and enhance the performance of Pero-SCs. For example, Jen et al. reported that the crystallization rate of perovskites and the coverage of perovskite films can be improved by incorporating 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives into the precursor;36 Song et al. utilized the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive in the perovskite precursor to improve the crystallinity, which enhanced the PCE from 6.96% to 8.97%.37 Liao et al. obtained uniform crystal domains and a smooth surface by using water as a solvent additive for the perovskite solution precursor and achieved a PCE of 16.60%.38 There are also several reports based on halogenide additives, such as HI,39 alkyl halides,40 phosphonium halides,41 NH4Cl,42,43 CaCl244etc.
Aiming at the commercialization of Pero-SCs, two important aspects, low cost and easy-accessibility, should be addressed in seeking for effective additives. In this direction, very recently Su et al. reported the controllable film morphology by incorporating a polymer additive PEG into the perovskite precursor for the first time. The addition of PEG resulted in a 25% improvement of PCE compared with the control devices.45 This result demonstrated the feasibility of using cheap polymers to control the crystal-growth of perovskite thin-films.
Inspired by Su et al.'s work, in this study, we introduced an easily-accessible polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor and used it to tune the crystal-growth of the thin-films. We found that the performance of the corresponding Pero-SCs was improved upon addition of the PEI additive. The alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS), steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations indicate that PEI can effectively enhance the crystallinity and the surface coverage of perovskite thin-films. Pero-SCs with 1.00 wt% PEI additive present a PCE as high as 14.07%, which is a 26% improvement compared with the reference devices without the PEI additive (11.17%).
Results and discussion
As designed, we anticipate that the addition of PEI will affect the crystal-growth of perovskite thin-films. Interestingly, an unexpected phenomenon occurred during the preparation of the precursor solutions upon adding PEI. As shown in Fig. 1a, when the weight ratios of PEI to the total amount of perovskite were 0, 0.75% and 1.00%, the DMF solution seemed to be clear and transparent. In fact, as demonstrated in Fig. 1b, the Tyndall effect can be observed when the laser light passes through the solution, which suggests that the perovskite precursor should be dispersed in the DMF in the form of colloidal particles. These results are consistent with that reported by Yang et al.46 Interestingly, when the weight ratio increased to 1.25%, the solution turned opaque. This result implies the formation of large particles in DMF solution. The 1.25 wt% content of PEI is 7.9 mg mL−1, which is still smaller than the maximum solubility of approximately 8.0 mg mL−1. Since the transparency change cannot be caused by either of the individual components, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor or PEI, the formation of the opaque solution could be ascribed to the interaction between PEI and the perovskite precursor. And a critical value for the transparency transition must exist between 1 wt% and 1.25 wt%.

To reveal the effects of the PEI additive on the performance of Pero-SCs, a conventional p-i-n planar heterojunction architecture was adopted in this study. As shown in Fig. 2a, the device configuration was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/LiF/Al. The thickness of the photoabsorber layer, i.e. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, was controlled to approximately 430 nm by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 50 s. The as-prepared perovskite film was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 70 minutes to realize the crystal-growth transition. As shown in Fig. 2b, the energy levels of the materials for each layer matched well, which implies that the charge transfer should be energetically allowed.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices with and without the PEI additive are illustrated in Fig. 2c, as well as the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 2d. The performance parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 1. Herein, the devices fabricated with the pristine perovskite film were used as control. For the control devices, the obtained PCE was 11.17% with Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 20.26 mA cm−2, and FF of 56.2%. By varying the composition of the PEI additive, the performance of the Pero-SCs shows a dependent feature. Upon addition of 1.00 wt% PEI in the perovskite layer, the performance was the best, where a PCE of 14.07% was achieved with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 22.63 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.4%. The PCE showed a ∼26% enhancement compared with those of the control devices, which could be mainly ascribed to the increase of Jsc and FF. When the composition of PEI was increased to 1.25%, the PCE drops to the same level of the control devices. We assume that the decrease of the PCE should be correlated with the loss of perovskite large particles. Since filtration was conducted before the usage of the solution, presumably part of the perovskite precursor, especially the relatively large particles, was removed. This can be a reasonable explanation for the drop in the PCE. Noteworthily, without PEI, hysteresis though not serious was observed (Fig. S1a†). Upon addition of PEI, the hysteresis became negligible (Fig. S1b, c & d†).

In the following, SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to investigate the effect of PEI on the surface morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite thin-films respectively. The first group of experiment was used to compare the surface morphology of the perovskite films with different amounts of PEI additives in Fig. 3. For the pristine perovskite film, the surface coverage is 86.7%. Pinholes can be observed and the crystal grains are quite small. The result agreed with the SEM cross-sectional image of the film shown in Fig. 3e. The pinholes were therefore filled with a top layer material PCBM. These existed defects would lead to poor charge transport and weak light absorption in perovskite thin-films. However, by incorporating 0.75 wt% PEI additive, the perovskite grain size is increased, and the voids on the pristine perovskite thin-film partly disappeared. A smoother thin-film with compact crystals can be observed, and the coverage was improved to 93.1%. When the PEI content was increased to 1.00 wt%, individual grains became larger and denser, and the coverage of perovskite reached to 97.9%. Notably, with a further increase of the PEI additive to 1.25 wt%, the individual grain size was enlarged, whereas more and large voids are produced between the grains, the coverage of perovskite film dropped to 90.1%. Therefore, these results indicate that low coverage and existing defects on the pristine perovskite film lead to poor charge transport and weak light absorption in perovskite thin-films, which were reflected by the low Jsc and poor FF of the control device mentioned above. However, with PEI as the additive, a smoother thin-film was formed and better coverage of the perovskite film was achieved, which gave rise to enhanced light absorption and better charge transport and in turn, increased Jsc and FF were observed in the corresponding devices. This conclusion is well consistent with UV-vis absorption properties as shown in Fig. S2.†

The second group of experiments aimed at comparing the inner structure of the perovskite thin-films. Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite solar cells without and with 1.00 wt% PEI. As for the Pero-SC using pristine perovskite, shown in Fig. 3e, the crystal film of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is not continuous, and the pinholes were filled with PCBM. The existence of the pinhole might be responsible for the poor charge transportation reflected by the lower Jsc. In contrast, the Pero-SC using perovskite mixed with 1.00 wt% of PEI showed compact packing of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx bulk crystals, as shown in Fig. 3f. No pinhole was observed, which indicates that the coverage was greatly increased.
The XRD patterns in Fig. 4 confirm the improvement effect of PEI additive in the crystal-growth of perovskite thin-films. All the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films present the same positions of diffraction peaks, 14.12° and 28.44°, corresponding to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite.22 Nevertheless, the peak intensities vary with the weight ratio of PEI additive. Upon addition of PEI into the perovskite, all the intensities were enhanced compared to the control, and the maximum value was achieved when the weight ratio of PEI additive was 1.00 wt%. The incorporation of PEI into perovskite definitely has an effect on the crystal-growth, which improves the smoothness and reduces the voids of the perovskite films during the annealing process. Thus, the increase of the coverage of the film (Table 1) accords with the increase of the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern. This result is consistent with the effect of PEG additive as depicted in Su's work.45 In addition, the intensity tendency is consistent with the performance of the Pero-SCs.

PL-quenching measures have been widely used in the study of perovskite solar cells to extract the electron–hole diffusion lengths in mixed (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) and triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite thin-films, and the PL decay has also become the representative characterization method for the recombination or depopulation of electrons and holes from the perovskite thin-film.18 Without the hole/electron transporting layers, the emission of the perovskite depends greatly on the recombination of the excitons inside the film. With the existence of the hole/electron transporting layers, the emission was mainly controlled by the interfacial transportation of charge carriers. Herein, both steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were obtained to study the charge recombination and transportation of perovskite films.
As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite thin-film with 1.00 wt% PEI additive shows a significantly enhanced PL compared to the pristine film, which indicates that the non-radiative carrier recombination has been remarkably suppressed. Moreover, being sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS and PCBM transporting layers, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film with 1.00 wt% PEI shows a significant PL quenching compared with the pristine perovskite film. These results indicate that the quality of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films was significantly improved by addition of PEI due to the decreased defects and higher coverage and crystallinity.

Time-resolved PL supplies further evidence for the interfacial extraction of charge carriers. Fig. 5b shows the time-resolved PL spectra of perovskite thin-films without and with 1.00 wt% of PEI additive. The lifetime for each sample was fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, which contains a fast decay and a slow decay process.36,47 The fast decay τ1 may stem from the quenching of photogenerated free carrier in the perovskite domain through the transport to ETL or HTL, and the slow decay τ2 can be assigned to the radiative recombination of free charge carriers before the charge collection. The lifetimes and the corresponding fractions are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the τ2 and the fraction of τ2 decreased. The decrease of τ2 and the increase of the fraction of τ1 confirm the facilitated charge transfer and extract from perovskite films to electrodes. The better charge transfer and extract would therefore lead to better FF, which is well consistent with the solar cell performance listed above.

To further track down the role of the PEI additive in the crystallization on PCE, a systematic investigation on the resistance analysis by ACIS has been carried out. In doing so, the perovskite solar cells without/with 1.00 wt% PEI were prepared. The impedance spectra are measured in the dark near the corresponding Voc bias voltages and the corresponding Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 6a. The parameters fitted from the ACIS are listed in Table 3. Herein, Rs is regarded as the series resistance of the two electrodes and the external circuit, R1∥C1 and R2∥C2 (or CPE-T and CPE-P) as the resistance and capacitance contributed by photoactive layers and interlayers. CPE stands for a non-ideal capacitor with the capacitive contribution CPE-T and the quality factor CPE-P. CPE-P is inversely related to surface roughness and CPE equals to a normal capacitor as CPE-P is 1.48–50 As shown in Table 3, while Rs from the devices without/with 1.00 wt% PEI does not show significant difference, R1 increased from 47.97 to 68.42 Ω. The increase of R1 might result from the insulating property of PEI in the active layer. At the same time, R2 decreased dramatically from 129.51 to 57.56 Ω, which can be ascribed to the smoother (indicated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) rms roughness, as shown in Fig. S3 in ESI†) perovskite film based on 1.00 wt% PEI. The lowered resistance facilitates the transfer of electrons, as a consequence it also contributes to the increase of Jsc and FF.

Conclusions
In this study, we employed an easily-accessible polymer PEI to tune the crystal-growth of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite thin-films. We found that the performance of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based Pero-SCs with 1.00 wt% of PEI achieved a summit PCE of 14.07%, which demonstrated a 26% increase compared with the PCE of 11.17% of the control device. The performance increase can be attributed to the improved morphology and crystallinity, reflected by the SEM and XRD results. The investigations of PL and ACIS further confirm that, with the improved morphology and crystallinity, the charge transportation and extraction have been greatly enhanced. These results demonstrated that PEI is an effective additive to improve the quality of perovskite films and has great potential to be a new candidate as an easily-accessible additive for mass production of Pero-SCs.
Experimental
Materials
The methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to the literature.19 The CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor was prepared by mixing MAI and lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%, Alfa) (with a molar ratio of 3:1 at 40 wt%) in anhydrous DMF (99.8%, Acros) pre-dissolved in 8 mg mL−1 of PEI (linear, Mw = 25000, Alfa-Aesar). The mixture was continuously stirred for 12 hours at 60 °C. The resulting precursor solution was stored under a nitrogen atmosphere, and filtered with 0.45 μm PTFE filters each time before use. All the above operations were carried out in a glove box filled with nitrogen.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates (CSG Holding Co., Ltd, 10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol each for 15 min. Then the pre-cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was filtered and spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 4500 rpm for 50 s, and then the ITO substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 15 minutes in air. By these operating conditions, the thickness of PEDOT:PSS was controlled to approximately 40 nm. The PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm). The perovskite solutions with different amounts of PEI additive were spin-coated over the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm for 50 s and then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 70 minutes. Subsequently, PCBM with a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 in chloroform was spin-coated atop the perovskite layer at 1200 rpm for 60 s. The resulting thickness of PCBM was approximately 60 nm. Finally, a buffer layer of LiF with a thickness of ∼1 nm and aluminum electrodes with a thickness of 80 nm were sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum (1 × 10−4 Pa). For each solar cell, the active area defined by the electrode was 4 mm2.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the devices were obtained by using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. The photocurrent was measured under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 input power. The measurements were conducted inside a glove box (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm). The EQE was measured by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, QE-R3011) in air. The light sources used in the above two measurements were calibrated using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell as a reference. SEM images were captured on an S-4700 microscope (Hitachi, Japan) operating at 15 kV. XRD patterns were collected using D2 PHASER (Bruker, Germany). The measurements of steady-state and time-resolved PL were conducted on FLS980 (Edinburgh Instrument). Time-resolved PL spectra were acquired by monitoring the signal at 790 nm excited with a 477 nm laser (10 MHz). ACIS curves were measured on an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) in the dark with a bias near the corresponding Voc of individual cells. The oscillating voltage was 10 mV and the frequency ranged from 4 MHz to 0.5 Hz. The impedance spectra were analyzed by using Z-View software. AFM images were captured on a MultiMode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) with peak force quantitative nanomechanical mode in air.
