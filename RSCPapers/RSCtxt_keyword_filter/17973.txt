    First published on 16th June 2023AbstractHydrogen is an essential energy carrier which will address the challenges posed by the energy crisis and climate change. Photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) is an important method for producing solar-powered hydrogen. The PEC tandem configuration harnesses sunlight as the exclusive energy source to drive both the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), simultaneously. Therefore, PEC tandem cells have been developed and gained tremendous interest in recent decades. This review describes the current status of the development of tandem cells for unbiased photoelectrochemical water splitting. The basic principles and prerequisites for constructing PEC tandem cells are introduced first. We then review various single photoelectrodes for use in water reduction or oxidation, and highlight the current state-of-the-art discoveries. Second, a close look into recent developments of PEC tandem cells in water splitting is provided. Finally, a perspective on the key challenges and prospects for the development of tandem cells for unbiased PEC water splitting are given.

1. Introduction
With the fast growing world economy, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels has brought many dilemmas such as the energy crisis, global warming, and air pollution.1–7 There are two primary ways to alleviate the energy crisis and environmental issues. One viable option is to use traditional energy in a more efficient way, and another is to replace them with renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy and hydropower.8–11 Among various renewable energies, solar energy is considered as the ultimate renewable source because of its abundance and inexhaustibility. The irradiation on the earth from solar energy is about 120000 TW a year, far exceeding the total energy consumption of the world12,13 (17.91 TW in 2017). Photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight into electricity and is one of the most widely used solar technologies today.14,15 However, the intermittent nature of solar energy limits a continuous and efficient power supply. It is therefore, highly desirable to develop an energy conversion technology that could counteract the intermittent nature of solar energy.
Hydrogen gas (H2) is recognised as one of the most desirable energy carriers due to its high gravimetric energy density (141.9 MJ kg−1) and its CO2-free nature during combustion, but currently most (>90%) H2 is produced from fossil fuels such as steam methane reforming.16 Solar water splitting is an ideal way to convert intermittent solar energy into storable and distributable H2. The pioneering work, in 1972, of Fujishima and Honda on water oxidation using TiO2 greatly motivates researchers.17 Three configurations for solar water splitting to produce H2 are under investigation, and these are photocatalysis (PC), PV connected electrolyser (PV-E), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.18 Typically, PC water splitting uses suspended semiconductor powders in an aqueous solution, in which the semiconductor such as TiO2 or SrTiO3 absorbs sunlight to generate carriers, and then the carriers migrate to the surface of the semiconductor, and participate in the water reduction or oxidation reaction. There are many excellent studies and reviews on the design and fabrication of PC water splitting.19–38 However, as the primary contender for driving overall water splitting, certain wide band-gap semiconductors with a band gap larger than 3 eV possess a limited absorption range for light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. This characteristic leads to an insufficient light utilisation efficiency, resulting in a low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. The separation of H2 and O2 is another concern in PC water splitting because H2 and O2 are produced in the same colloidal suspension for PC water splitting.39 The PV-E water splitting exhibits a higher STH efficiency than the PC process. Generally, the commercial PV modules and electrolysers can be integrated into a system to produce H2.40–42 Several comprehensive reviews have been published on the techno-economic analysis of PV-E.43–48 Although PV-E water splitting is easy to scale-up, the cost of H2 is unlikely to be economically viable compared to the steam methane reforming process due to the high cost of the PV module and electrolyser. Despite the significant progress made in solar water splitting, finding a technology that simultaneously achieves high STH efficiency, low cost, and scalability remains a considerable challenge.
The PEC water splitting offers several advantages in terms of a high theoretical STH efficiency, simple separation of products, a simple fabrication process, and a potentially low cost for overall water splitting.49–51 In contrast to the PC process, H2 and O2 are generated at different electrodes in a PEC configuration, avoiding the generation of an explosive H2/O2 mixture and the cost of H2/O2 separation. Compared to the PV-E configurations, the PEC directly integrates the light absorber with the catalyst in one device, eliminating external circuit resistance and ohmic contact losses, thereby reducing cost and device complexity.52–54 Extensive and comprehensive research has been carried out on PEC photoelectrode model design, catalyst and semiconductor selection, and fundamental considerations for improving STH efficiency and stability.55–57 Although the STH efficiency and stability of a single photoelectrode (i.e., photocathode or photoanode) have been significantly improved, no single photoelectrode has yet been able to simultaneously drive overall water splitting with a high STH efficiency. The use of a single photoelectrode for water splitting is often characterised by a trade-off between photocurrent and onset potential, which means that the photoelectrode with a wide band gap presents a good onset potential but a low photocurrent, whereas the photoelectrode with a narrow band gap shows a high photocurrent but insufficient driving force to lower the onset potential. Therefore, external electric energy is still needed to accomplish overall water splitting. The PEC tandem cells, which consist of two or more photoelectrodes with different band gaps that are connected in series, can potentially combine the advantages of single photoelectrodes to achieve unbiased overall water splitting.21,58,59 More importantly, there is no restriction on the flat band potentials of the photoelectrode in the tandem cells by the thermodynamic potentials that straddle the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) simultaneously. Tandem architectures are recognised as the leading candidates for higher-efficiency next-generation technology in the field of solar water splitting.
The construction of unbiased tandem PEC cells is highly desirable and this has been demonstrated by the growing number of papers in the literature. There have already been several excellent reviews about the tandem cells for unbiased water splitting.27,60–62 However, a comprehensive summary of tandem cells for PEC unbiased water splitting is still missing. This review focuses on providing an overview of the fundamentals of PEC tandem cells, from basic principles to device structure design and to achieving an efficient and robust tandem cell for unbiased water splitting. In this review, we first introduce the fundamentals of PEC tandem cells and then we discuss the optimised photoelectrodes for PEC tandem cells. After that, recent developments of PEC tandem cells with different configurations are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of tandem cells for PEC unbiased water splitting are also proposed.
2. Fundamentals of PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting
2.1 Principles and mechanisms of solar water splitting
Splitting water into H2 and O2 is a thermodynamically uphill reaction, which requires a standard free energy change (ΔG) of 237.2 kJ mol−1 or a 1.23 eV per electron to split one molecule of water into H2 and ½O2 under standard conditions.63,64 A water splitting reaction in acidic media is shown by the following equations:4H+ + 4e− → 2H22H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−A water splitting reaction in alkaline media is shown by the following equations:4H2O + 4e− → 2H2 + 4OH−4OH− → O2 + 4H2O + 4e−
For solar-driven water splitting ideally, the semiconductor has to satisfy several key criteria: (1) the band gap is larger than 1.23 eV (corresponding to wavelengths of 1000 nm or shorter), (2) the generated photovoltage is larger than 1.23 V, and (3) the conduction band-edge energy (Ec) and valence band-edge energy (Ev) must span the electrochemical potentials of the HER (E°(H+/H2)) and the OER, (E°(O2/H2O)) to achieve unassisted solar water splitting.65,66 Obviously, the quest for a semiconductor material that can meet all the necessary criteria to facilitate the overall water splitting process remains a significant challenge. Moreover, the required photovoltage for water splitting is much higher due to the additional kinetic requirements of at least 0.3 V for OER and ≈0.05 V for driving HER even using efficient catalysts.67,68 Hence, employing two individual photoelectrodes (photoanode and photocathode) to meet these criteria is a favourable way to achieve co-evolution of H2 and O2, based on which the catalyst loading also plays a crucial role in accelerating the surface reaction kinetics of solar water splitting.69,70
2.2 Construction of tandem cells for unbiased PEC water splitting
For PEC tandem cells designed for unbiased overall water splitting, a prerequisite is that the combined photovoltage generated by the two photoelectrodes must exceed the thermodynamic water splitting voltage of 1.23 V, together with an additional overpotential necessary to overcome kinetic losses. In other words, an intersection of overlapped photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the photocathode and the photoanode should be constructed71 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Typical photocurrent–voltage curves for constructing PEC tandem cell. The operating current density (Jop) represents the working current for unbiased PEC water splitting cells. 
The J–V curves of the photocathode and photoanode should be independently characterised in a three-electrode configuration. If there is an intersection between the photocathode and the photoanode (Fig. 1), the overall water splitting efficiency can be calculated by the following equation:  where Pin is the power density of the simulation light, which usually matches the air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar spectrum with 100 mW cm−2. Jop is the interaction current density of the two J–V curves. ηF is the faradaic efficiency. ηSTH also depends strongly upon the Jop, which is determined by the interaction of the two J–V curves. For example, a higher STH efficiency will be achieved if a photoanode (purple curve, Fig. 1) has a better onset potential, fill factor (FF), and larger photocurrent density than the other photoanode (blue curve, Fig. 1). Therefore, it is imperative to enhance the FF, onset potential, and photocurrent of the photoelectrodes to achieve a greater STH efficiency. These key criteria for photoelectrodes are also determined by the catalyst, electrolyte, and the types of semiconductors.72 These topics will be covered in more detail in Section 3.
2.3 Theoretical maximum STH efficiency of PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting
The prediction or simulation of the theoretical maximum efficiency is essential for PEC solar energy water splitting.73,74 The Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) efficiency limit (about 30%) of single-junction solar cells is predicted using detailed equilibrium principles.75 Because the theoretical maximum solar power generation efficiency of the tandem solar cells is 47%, which is much higher than the 30% of the single-junction solar cells, the tandem structure has attracted much attention due to the possibility of overcoming the S–Q limit of single-junction devices.76 A similar situation exists in the field of solar water splitting, where the adoption of a tandem cell is not only aimed at pursuing a high STH efficiency but also at overcoming the voltage limitations of a single photoelectrode.
In principle, tandem cells designed for unbiased water splitting comprise a wide band gap photoelectrode and a narrow band gap photoelectrode. To attain the highest STH efficiency under AM 1.5G illumination (1 sun), the matching of the band gap energies between two photoelectrodes is the most crucial factor to consider.77,78 Incident light initially passes through the front photoelectrode and subsequently reaches the back photoelectrode. The short- and long-wavelength light are absorbed by the front and back photoelectrodes, respectively, (Fig. 2).49 Lewis and co-workers demonstrated that the PEC tandem cells exhibited a maximum STH efficiency of 29.7% at a band gap combination of 1.60 eV/0.95 eV (Fig. 3a). For PV-E water splitting, the maximum STH efficiency of 28.7% was also predicted (Fig. 3b).49 In addition, H. Döscher and co-workers considered the overpotential and light absorption of water, and a maximum STH efficiency of 28.9% was obtained.51 Nevertheless, up to now, the highest STH efficiency for the PEC tandem cells is still far below its theoretical maximum efficiency. This discrepancy in performance is caused by several key aspects of the PEC tandem cells: (1) poor activity of each photoelectrode, (2) slow kinetics of the surface catalyst, (3) light loss and voltage drop caused by the ion-selective membrane, (4) ion mass transport losses in the electrolyte, and (5) parasitic light absorption of water.

3. Photoelectrodes for PEC tandem cells
In principle, the STH efficiency of the PEC tandem cells depends greatly on the performance of each photoelectrode. The onset potential, saturated photocurrent, and FF are the main parameters concerned with photoelectrode evaluation, and extensive studies have focused on this area. If looking for a more efficient PEC tandem cell for overall water splitting, PEC tandem cells are decoupled into two components (photoanode and photocathode) for independent optimisation. Here, several representative photoelectrodes for PEC tandem cells are highlighted.
3.1 Front photoanodes for tandem cells
N-Type semiconductors are commonly employed as photoanodes, where the photoexcited holes migrate from the substrate to the catalyst surface when participating in OER. The OER is considered as the bottleneck for water splitting because the generation of one molecule of oxygen involves four electron proton-coupling reactions, resulting in sluggish kinetics.79 The BiVO4, Fe2O3, SrTiO3, TiO2, WO3, and ZnO, are widely investigated photoanodes used for water oxidation. The theoretical photocurrent and efficiency of these oxide-based photoanodes were predicated by Prévot and Sivula (Fig. 4).61 Although these photoanodes demonstrated impressive theoretical efficiencies, the photocurrent and onset potential obtained in the experiments fell significantly short of the theoretical values, thereby limiting the efficiency of the tandem cell.80,81 Significant research efforts are being directed towards enhancing the STH efficiency of the oxide-based photoanodes, with the goal of achieving their theoretical limits.

3.1.1 TiO2 photoanode. 
The pioneer work on PEC water splitting using TiO2 was introduced by Fujishima and Honda in 1972.17 This work demonstrated that the voltage generated by TiO2 can be utilised to reduce the total energy inputs for water splitting. The TiO2 also has qualities such as excellent chemical stability in harsh solutions, favourable valence band position for OER, and low cost. Inspired by the potential of TiO2 as a photoabsorber, numerous research endeavours have been devoted to exploring its applications in solar-driven water splitting and organic pollutant degradation.82,83 Generally, the TiO2 photoanode presents a positive onset potential of about 0.1 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) (unless otherwise noted, all electrochemical potentials reported in this review are referenced to an RHE). However, TiO2 with a band gap of 3.0–3.2 eV only absorbs the UV light, resulting in a low photocurrent and efficiency for the tandem cells.20,84 A variety of strategies, therefore, have persisted to extend the light absorption range such as hydrogenation, impurity doping, and plasmonic effects.85,86 For example, Mao and co-workers87 and Li and co-workers88 reported a hydrogen treatment method to extend the TiO2 light absorption, achieving a substantially narrowed band gap (Fig. 5a), and enhanced light absorption (Fig. 5b). Doping TiO2 with C, N, Nb, Sn, or other impurity elements generates more donor states in the band gap, and the increase in donor density leads to high charge separation and transport efficiency.89–93 Another approach to improve light absorption is to incorporate metal nanoparticles with a surface plasmon resonance effect onto the TiO2 surface.94–96 Up to now, the state-of-the-art TiO2 photoanode is obtained from hydrogen treated TiO2 (Fig. 5c), and achieves a high photocurrent of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.4 VRHE and an STH of 1.63% at 0.4 VRHE85 (Fig. 5d). Therefore, the theoretical maximum efficiency of the tandem cell using TiO2 as the front photoelectrode is about 3.44% (2.8 mA × 1.23 V).

3.1.2 WO3 photoanode. 
To further improve the photocurrent for the photoanode, a semiconductor with an intrinsic narrower band gap than TiO2 was examined.97,98 The WO3 is a n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.5–2.8 eV, which can utilise ∼12% of sunlight in theory.99 Since the first report in 1976 by Hodes et al., WO3 has attracted extensive attention because of its relatively narrow band gap, high chemical stability in aqueous solutions especially in acid solution, simple fabrication methods, and a long minority carrier diffusion length (150 nm).100 The WO3 photoanode has a much higher theoretical maximum STH efficiency (4.8%) than TiO2 (2.2%). However, the charge separation efficiency of the WO3 photoanode is inefficient, resulting in severe carrier recombination loss.101 To overcome this dilemma, nanostructured WO3 photoanodes, such as nanowires or nanoflakes have been developed to decrease the hole transportation length. The WO3 photoanode with a nanostructure can be synthesised by sol–gel, hydrothermal, W metal anodisation, and so on.102–107 Li and co-workers reported a hydrogen treated WO3 that presented a significantly larger photocurrent than a pristine sample, and it achieved a photocurrent of 0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.6 VRHE.108 Another visible way to enhance the photoactivity of WO3 is to introduce oxygen vacancies into the WO3, where the excessive oxygen vacancies lead to a high carrier recombination. Thus, Gong and co-workers proposed two-dimensional WO3 nanoflakes with a moderate oxygen density for efficient water oxidation.109 The oxygen vacancies were first introduced by hydrogen treatment on the surface of the WO3 photoanode, and then the partial oxygen vacancies were healed by ozone treatment (HO-WO3) (Fig. 6a). The HO-WO3 exhibits an enhanced photocurrent and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) compared with the sample that was only treated by hydrogen (H-WO3) and ozone (O-WO3) (Fig. 6b and c).

3.1.3 Hematite (α-Fe2O3) photoanode. 
The α-Fe2O3 possesses a smaller band gap (2.0–2.2 eV) than TiO2 and WO3, which allows for the absorption of visible light in the range of 563–620 nm.110–112 The α-Fe2O3 also has the advantages of good stability in harsh solutions, low cost, non-toxicity, suitability for the edge position of the valence band for water oxidation, and so on.113,114 Despite these favourable properties, the practical STH efficiency of the α-Fe2O3 (3.4%)115 is much lower than its theoretical maximum value of 15.5%, which is due to several factors: (1) low absorption coefficient, implying that the minimum thickness of α-Fe2O3 is 375 nm to fully absorb the light.116 However, the minority carrier diffusion length of α-Fe2O3 is very short (about 2 nm), leading to massive recombination of the photogenerated carriers in the bulk. (2) Severe charge recombination on the surface of the α-Fe2O3. This results in an inferior onset potential or sluggish surface reaction kinetics. (3) The major carrier of the α-Fe2O3, electrons, may recombine at the back-contact interface due to the lattice or work function mismatch. Therefore, great efforts have been made to overcome these problems.117 Gamelin and co-workers systematically investigated the effect of the Co–Pi thickness on the transmission of the photogenerated charges between the Fe2O3 photoanode and the catalyst118 (Fig. 7a). A catalyst with an optimal thickness can accelerate the surface reaction kinetics and improve the onset potential and photocurrent (Fig. 7b). In addition, Gong and co-workers reported the synergistic co-catalytic effects by carbon nanodots and Co3O4, achieving a photocurrent of 1.48 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.119 Apart from the catalyst loading and optimisation, surface passivation is an effective way to improve the carrier utilisation efficiency by reducing the recombination centres. Sivula and co-workers introduced a thin Al2O3 (0.1–2 nm) layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to reduce the overpotential for α-Fe2O3.120 Likewise, a high annealing temperature and acid treatment also provided ways to remove surface defects and achieve higher STH efficiencies. To maintain the nanostructure of Fe2O3 at high temperatures, ALD-ZrO2 was deposited on FeOOH to facilitate a solid-state reaction to form a Zr–Fe2O3 photoanode (Fig. 7c), leading to a 2.3 times increase compared with the pristine Fe2O3 photoanode121 (Fig. 7d).

3.1.4 BiVO4 photoanode. 
The BiVO4 is one of the most widely studied photoanodes for water oxidation due to its relatively narrow band gap (2.4 eV), low cost, and good chemical stability.122,123 Kudo et al.124 and Li and co-workers125,126 conducted an in-depth study of powder-based BiVO4 photocatalysts in terms of performance and fundamental understanding, providing design principles for the investigation of BiVO4. The BiVO4 photoelectrode, exhibits a higher photocurrent than that of Fe2O3, TiO2, and WO3, and so on, while showing a positive onset potential (0.2 VRHE) which was comparable to that of TiO2 (0.1 VRHE).127 Thus, BiVO4 has emerged as a popular choice for photoanodes in tandem cells in recent years. However, the severe carrier recombination, poor electrical conductivity, and sluggish surface reaction kinetics for water oxidation are the main constraints that hamper further improvement of BiVO4.128 To overcome these obstacles, the BiVO4 photoanodes were also prepared in the form of nanostructures, which enlarged the contact area between the electrodes and the electrolyte. Doping strategies, including intrinsic defect doping (such as oxygen vacancies) and extrinsic element doping (such as Fe, Mo, P, Sn, and W), have been widely adopted for the enhancement of the electrical conductivity and the performance for BiVO4.129,130 Constructing a heterojunction between BiVO4 and the catalyst is another approach to suppress the carrier recombination. Kisch and co-workers demonstrated that the combination of n-type BiVO4 and p-type Co3O4 can enhance the photocurrent.131 Catalyst loading is an effective way to lower the surface reaction kinetics, and catalysts such as Co3O4, Co–Pi, FeOOH/NiOOH, and RhO2, have been extensively investigated. Choi and co-workers reported a superior FeOOH/NiOOH catalyst with a high electron–hole separation efficiency, achieving a high photocurrent of 2.73 mA cm−2 with an ABPE of 1.8% at 0.6 VRHE (Fig. 8a and b).132,133 Zheng et al. recently demonstrated a preferentially [001]-oriented BiVO4 photoanode (p-BVO) (Fig. 8c), which achieved a significantly enhanced photocurrent of 3.64 mA cm−2 compared to the random BiVO4 photoanode (r-BVO) at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 8d). This work reveals that the modulation of crystallographic orientation is an effective way to improve the performance of the BiVO4 photoanodes.134

In addition to the previously mentioned potential candidates, there are several other materials being explored as photoelectrodes for PEC water oxidation such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), GaAs, GaP, CdTe, and crystalline silicon (Si).135,136 Generally, these photoanodes are constructed in parallel illumination configurations rather than in series mode to construct unbiased water-splitting cells, because the short-wavelength light is significantly blocked by these low band gap photoanodes.

3.2 Back photocathode for tandem cells
In addition to the photoanode, the photocathode plays a critical role as the back photoelectrode in tandem cells, and considerable progress has been achieved in improving the PEC activity of the photocathodes. Generally, the photocathode used for water reduction is a p-type semiconductor. At the interface between a semiconductor and an electrolyte in PEC, energy band bending occurs which facilitates the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the substrate to the photocathode surface. This bending of the energy band is essential for achieving efficient charge separation and transfer across the solid–liquid junction.137 Despite extensive research in photoelectrochemistry, it has been challenging to generate large photovoltages at the solid–liquid junctions due to the low-energy band bending and severe carrier recombination. Therefore, photocathodes with a buried junction have been proposed, and have been widely developed in recent years.138 Several narrow band gap semiconductor materials such as a-Si, chalcopyrite (Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CuInS2), crystalline silicon (Si), Cu2O, and perovskite have attracted great attention for use as unbiased water-splitting photocathodes.

3.2.1 Si photocathode. 
With a band gap of 1.12 eV, Si is a desirable photovoltaic material because of its qualities of earth abundance and wide light absorption range (up to 1100 nm). Up to now, Si solar cells have taken more than 90% of the market share, and its efficiency has been significantly improved to greater than 26%, which getting closer to the theoretical maximum value (29.1%).139,140 Likewise, Si could be a desirable narrow band gap photoabsorber for constructing the tandem cells. Research on the Si photocathode mainly focuses on two aspects. The first is the performance, including onset potential, photocurrent, and the FF for the Si photocathode. The second concerns the stability of the Si photocathode. Micro- or nano-textured structures, such as micro-pyramids, nanowires, and nanopillar arrays, were designed to improve the photocurrent by enhancing the light absorption and expanding the area of the solid–liquid space charge layer.141,142 Surface or interface passivation are two strategies that have been proved to enhance the onset potential and the FF. Wang and co-workers reported a remarkable STH efficiency (13.26%) and onset potential (0.64 VRHE) using a Si/amorphous Si heterojunction (SiHJ)143 (Fig. 9a and b). Chorkendorff and co-workers144 and Jaramillo and co-workers, synthesised and introduced MoS2 onto the pn+ Si photocathode,145 resulting in accelerated surface reaction rates. These pieces of research provide more profound insights that the commercial PV solar cell with a high efficiency can be employed as substrates for water splitting.

Despite the excellent photoactivity demonstrated by the Si photocathodes, their poor stability remains a key factor hindering their potential for future applications. Thus, the use of protective layers has been proposed to isolate the Si photocathode from the corrosive electrolyte.146 A metallic layer can serve as a protective layer or as a catalyst layer for the Si photocathode. Maier et al. demonstrated a Pt protected Si photocathode, which gave 60 days stability in a pH 0 solution.147 Despite the simple fabrication process and robust stability, the intrinsic high light absorption of the metallic layer often results in a low photocurrent. Thus, transparent metal oxides have been developed as protective layers for the Si photocathode. titanium dioxide is an example of a protective layer because of its excellent stability, high optical transmittance, and favourable conduction band position for electron transportation. Chorkendorff and co-workers developed a TiO2 protected Si photocathode148 (Fig. 9c), which exhibits a higher photocurrent and longer stability compared to the bare photocathode (Fig. 9d). These characteristics show that the Si photocathodes are promising contenders for use in PEC tandem cells.


3.2.2 Chalcopyrite (kesterite)-based photocathode. 
Chalcopyrite-based semiconductors including Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CuInS2 (CIGS) and (Ag,Cu)GaSe2, and so on, are of great interest as photovoltaic materials due to their advantages of tunable band gap (from 1.0 to 2.4 eV), high optical absorption coefficients (105 cm−1) and low cost.149,150 The CIGS-based solar cell achieves an efficiency of 22.8%,151,152 one of the highest efficiencies among the thin film solar cells, and comparable to that of Si solar cells. Therefore, chalcopyrite-based semiconductors have great potential, as photoelectrodes for unbiased water splitting, to achieve high STH efficiencies. Recently, Domen and co-workers investigated the flux ratio and partial pressure of hydrogen during co-evaporation leading to an improved STH efficiency.153 Following this work, they modified CuGaSe2 with a thin CdS layer to form a pn junction on the electrode surface, which possesses better onset potential and stability.154 Gong and co-workers demonstrated that the interfacial defects strongly affect the onset potential and photocurrent. An ultrathin Al2O3 layer was inserted as the interfacial passivation layer to repair the defects and a record STH efficiency (9.3%) was obtained.155 Despite the significant improvements made by the CIGS photocathodes, its drawbacks: the rarity of the metals Ga and In, might be a concern. Hence, researchers are searching for a new material that is low-cost and environmentally friendly, while retaining a high efficiency. The Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is an attractive candidate as a semiconductor for PEC water splitting because of its low cost, earth abundance and low toxicity.156 Jiang and co-workers reported a HfO2 passivated CZTS photocathode with a high STH efficiency of 2.7%.157


3.2.3 Cu2O photocathode. 
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O), is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.0 eV. Theoretical calculations show that Cu2O has a maximum photocurrent of 14.7 mA cm−2 and an STH efficiency of 18%.158,159 Therefore, Cu2O is regarded as a promising metal oxide based photocathode for solar water splitting and has been extensively explored in recent years.160,161 However, the major limitation of the Cu2O photocathode is its poor stability in aqueous solution. Specifically, the Cu1+ will be reduced to Cu0 at the cathodic potential, because its reduction potential lies in the potential range of water splitting. To address this problem, Thimsen and co-workers introduced 4 nm ZnO and 11 nm TiO2 as the protective layer for the Cu2O photocathode (Fig. 10a), which shows an excellent photocurrent of 7.6 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE and high stability (Fig. 10b).162 In addition, to reduce the carrier loss at the interface between Cu2O and the back-contact electrode, Hagfeldt and co-workers deposited a hole transport layer, CuSCN, to suppress the carrier recombination, and an improved performance was achieved (Fig. 10c and d).163

3.2.4 III–V photocathode. 
The III–V semiconductors with a direct band gap such as InP, GaAs, and GaInP, and so on, are recognised as attractive candidates for PVs and PEC water splitting.164,165 Solar cells with a high solar power conversion efficiency of 40% have been achieved based on multi-junction III–V semiconductor substrates.166 Moreover, the band gap could be tuned by varying the ratio of III–V elements, which is another considerable advantage for PEC water splitting. In 1981, Heller and Vadimsky designed and fabricated an InP photocathode, achieving an appreciable STH efficiency of 12%.167 Khaselev and Turner further improved the STH efficiency to 12.4% with a PV-E device consisting of a GaAs PV cell and a GaInP2.168


3.2.5 Perovskite photocathode. 
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently emerged as attractive candidates for next generation PVs due to their high efficiency, low cost, and simple fabrication process.169,170 In addition, the band gap of the PSCs can be tuned by changing the element ratio, leading to a tunable photovoltage and photocurrent. Likewise, the PSCs are expected to be efficient photoelectrodes for water splitting.171 Tricoli and co-workers reported a perovskite photocathode with a CoP catalyst for water reduction that produces a photocurrent of 12.4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE.172 However, the inherent instability of the perovskites hampers their practical applications, especially for PEC water splitting in aqueous solutions. Hence, more attention still needs to be given to further improve their stability.

4. Progress and configuration of tandem cells for PEC unbiased water splitting
4.1 Progress of PEC tandem cells
The PEC water splitting is a sustainable technology that enables solar energy to become a chemical fuel. Up to now, various semiconductors have been explored for use as the photoelectrode materials for PEC water splitting, which has been mentioned in previous sections. With the development of photoelectrochemistry, the PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting have been extensively studied, as shown by the increasingly abundant semiconductor materials, and more and more reports have been published over time (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  The number of reports on PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting from 1975–2022. 
Yoneyama et al. pioneered a PEC tandem cell composed of a TiO2 photoanode and a GaP photocathode, which produced hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously without external bias voltage for the first time.173 However, the development of such tandem cells is limited by the low saturation photocurrent density of wide band gap photoanodes and the poor stability of the photocathode in the electrolyte.
The emergence of non-oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes based on a-Si and III–V PVs from the mid-1980s to the beginning of this century has greatly improved the efficiency of unbiased PEC water splitting. The STH efficiency for the multi-junction a-Si photoelectrodes has been increased from 1.8%174 to 7.8%.175 For the III–V based photoelectrodes, the STH efficiency increased from the 8.2% initially obtained with an n-GaAs photoanode and a p-InN photocathode to a recorded 19.3%.176,177 It is also worth noting that wireless artificial leaves can be realised with a-Si and III–V based semiconductors. For example, a wireless cell was constructed by depositing RuOx OER and a Pt HER catalyst on the backside and topside of a-Si with a triple-junction.174 An Si/III–V 2J monolithic architecture was also developed, with an STH efficiency of 18.3% for unbiased water splitting.178
To improve energy utilisation efficiency and reduce the cost, numerous metal–oxide photoanodes such as WO3 and Fe2O3 have been extensively studied, since 2005, for PEC unbiased water splitting because of their low cost, abundance, and environmental compatibility (Fig. 11). Band bending can occur at the interface between a solid and a liquid, leading to charge separation. In addition, metal–oxides are suitable to be the front cell in PEC tandem cells, which absorb light at the short wavelength numbers. By coupling a WO3-based photoanode with dye sensitised solar cells (DSSC) or a-Si solar cells, an STH efficiency greater than 4% can be achieved.179 Although the theoretical maximum efficiency of the Fe2O3-based tandem cells is about 15%, when coupled with a BiVO4 photoanode and two pieces of crystalline Si (2p c-Si) solar cells, the realistic STH efficiency is 7.7%.180
Since 2010, the BiVO4 photoanodes have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for PEC unbiased water splitting. The BiVO4 possesses a narrower band gap (2.4 eV) than those of WO3 and Fe2O3, and thus the light absorption range could be extended to the visible light range. Furthermore, the BiVO4 photoanodes show a low onset potential, which broadens the choice of the backside cell (photocathode). Hence, some representative photocathodes, such as CIGS, CZTS, Si, and Cu2O, can be coupled with BiVO4 for tandem cells. PVs with low-cost and simple fabrication processes, such as perovskite and DSSC, coupled with BiVO4 photoelectrodes have also been investigated. To date, tandem solar cells incorporating BiVO4 photoanodes have exhibited superior STH conversion efficiencies compared to many of those utilising other metal oxide photoanodes.
4.2 Configuration of PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting
PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting, include PEC/PEC, PEC/PV, and monolithic PEC tandem cells (Fig. 12). The detailed comparisons between these three types of PEC tandem cells are summarised in Table 1. The high STH (>20%) conversion efficiencies predicted for these configurations render them attractive candidates for use in practical applications.48 However, there is still a large gap between the experimental results and the theoretical values due to the restrictions from structural design, material selection, and so on.

A typical PEC/PEC tandem cell comprises a photoanode and a photocathode (Fig. 12a), with the OER and HER occurring at the surface of each, respectively. To effectively use the solar spectrum, the front electrode absorbs short-wavelength sunlight, while the rear photoelectrode captures long-wavelength sunlight that penetrates through the front electrode. Therefore, both the front and rear photoelectrodes should exhibit suitable band edge positions relative to the redox potential of water, with mutually matching band gaps to collect light, and sufficient photovoltages to drive the water splitting reaction. To date, the lack of suitable materials that meet the required criteria has resulted in an STH efficiency of only about 5%.
Compared with PEC/PEC tandem cells, the PEC/PV tandem cells alleviate the requirements for band gap and band edge positions of the electrode materials, broadening the choice of materials that can be used. The PEC/PV tandem cell consists of a photoelectrode and a dark counter electrode for PEC water splitting with PV as an external bias (Fig. 12b). Like the PEC/PEC tandem cell, the photoelectrodes and the PV component can absorb sunlight of different wavelengths. The photogenerated carriers (holes) of the photoelectrode recombine with the charges (electrons) from the PV module, and the remaining carriers will participate in the OER, while the remaining charges from the PV module are transferred to the counter electrode for HER (Fig. 12b). The rapid development of the PV cells made a greater advances when compared to the PEC photoelectrodes, leading to a higher STH efficiency for the PEC/PV tandem cells (∼10%). However, the cost of PV materials remains a crucial factor to consider (Table 1).
Tandem cells that combine PEC and PEC or PEC and PV technologies are relatively easier to construct than monolithic tandem cells. This is because in these configurations, the photoelectrodes and the PV cell can be optimised independently and then directly connected with wires. As a result, the majority of the reported tandem cells are based on one of these two configurations.181 In contrast, the monolithic PEC tandem cells suffer from high density interfacial defects, mismatched band edge position, and incompatible preparation conditions of absorbers, which greatly increase the fabrication difficulties and thus, it exhibits a low STH efficiency (<1%). However, monolithic PEC tandem cells possess the highest integration, in which the photoanode, photocathode, and water splitting catalysts are integrated in a single substrate (Fig. 12c), making it worthwhile to address the problems they face.

4.2.1 PEC/PEC tandem cells. 
Based on the type of photoelectrode material used, the PEC/PEC tandem cells can be categorised into three main groups: all-oxide PEC tandem cells, PV-based PEC tandem cells, and oxide-PV hybrid PEC tandem cells. Metal oxide-based photoelectrodes for water splitting have been intensively studied due to their abundance, low toxicity, and low cost. For water oxidation, n-type metal–oxide semiconductors (BiVO4, Fe2O3, TiO2, WO3, and so on) are widely used as the photoanodes.81,182,183 For water reduction, p-type metal–oxide semiconductors (CuBiO4, Cu2O, and so on) were investigated for use as the photocathodes in tandem cells.12,184
(1) All-oxide PEC/PEC tandem devices. 
By coupling a TiO2 nanorod array photoanode with a textured CuBi2O4 photocathode, Chu and co-workers constructed a PEC tandem cell (Fig. 13a), and an STH efficiency of 1.23% was achieved (Fig. 13b).185 Compared with TiO2 photoanode, WO3 and Fe2O3 photoanodes have a narrower band gap, thus theoretically, a higher STH efficiency can be expected. However, tandem cells based on WO3/Cu2O and Fe2O3/CuBi2O4 showed much lower efficiencies of 0.04%186 and 0.15%,187 which can be ascribed to their low photovoltages and insufficient charge transfer. Among these metal–oxide photoanodes, the BiVO4 photoanodes are currently the most widely used in the all-oxide tandem cells. This is because of the high current density and positive onset potential. Grätzel and co-workers reported a tandem device consisting of a Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanode and a Cu2O photocathode (Fig. 13c), and achieving an unassisted water-splitting STH conversion efficiency of 3% (Fig. 13d), which is the most efficient of all the oxide tandem cells188 (Table 2).

(2) PV-based PEC/PEC tandem cells. 
Although the unbiased water splitting reaction could be driven by the all-oxide tandem cells, the rear cell with a wide band gap (>2.0 eV) results in a narrow light absorption range and low photocurrent. Therefore, developing narrow band gap photoelectrodes that can extend the light absorption range is critical for improving the STH efficiency. The light-harvesting range of the PV-based PEC tandem cells has also been extended due to advances in double-junction (2-jn) and triple-junction (3-jn) tandem structures in the field of PVs. In 1985, Bockris and co-workers reported a 3-jn a-Si (pin–pin–pin stack) based devices for unbiased water splitting, with Pt foil and Ti/RuO2 as catalyst.174 In this configuration, the catalyst layers were exposed to the electrolyte, which exhibits an STH efficiency of 1.8%. Hence, the a-Si based tandem cells have gained much attention in recent years.
Nocera and co-workers described a monolithic tandem cell based on 3-jn a-Si (Fig. 14a) with a Co and NiMoZn catalyst (Fig. 14b), which demonstrated the possibility of constructing an unbiased water splitting device using the commercialised PV materials.203 Despite the fact that a high STH efficiency of 4.7% was achieved in a near-neutral pH solution, the poor stability is the main issue hindering its use in further practical applications in the future (Fig. 14c).

For a 2-jn photoelectrode consisting of a top light absorber (band gap ∼1.7 eV) and a bottom light absorber (band gap ∼1.05 eV), the predicted maximum theoretical STH efficiency is about 30%. The Si is suitable as a bottom light absorber due to its narrow band gap (∼1.1 eV). The III–V nitride-based semiconductors have emerged as highly promising materials, due to their tunable direct band gap from 0.65 eV (InN) to 3.4 eV (GaN), stability under visible light, and direct deposition onto Si wafers. Mi and co-workers showed an integrated dual-absorber photoelectrode constructed from p-type In0.25Ga0.75N nanowires on n-type Si wafers using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy204 (Fig. 14d and e). When coupled with a Pt counter electrode, the photocathode exhibits an unbiased photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2, enabling a high STH efficiency of 3.4%. Based on this, an InGaN/Si-based double-junction photoelectrode, was further demonstrated, in which the p-type InGaN top junction is directly grown on the bottom of the Si p–n junction (Fig. 14f). After adopting a Pt catalyst and an Al2O3 surface passivation layer, the unbiased water-splitting STH efficiency is about 10.3%, which holds the record efficiency in a PV-based PEC tandem cell205 (Fig. 14g and Table 3).

(3) Oxide photoelectrode–PV hybrid PEC/PEC tandem cells. 
All of the electrodes are made of PV materials, except that one of photoelectrodes is made of oxide and the other photoelectrode is made of PV materials, and this is described as an oxide photoelectrode–PV hybrid PEC/PEC tandem cell. This configuration integrates the cost-effective and simple preparation of metal oxides, as well as the mature technology, and high performance of PV-based photoelectrodes, making it the most extensively studied tandem structure for unbiased water splitting.
Limited by the low photocurrent and impeded carrier transport, the STH efficiency of the tandem cell employing Fe2O3, TiO2, and WO3, as photoanodes is relatively low (<1%) (Table 4). Jin and co-workers reported a PEC tandem cell with p-Si/TiO2/Fe2O3 photocathode and a TiO2/TiO2 photoanode, which achieved an STH of 0.5%.210 Lewis and co-workers described an ingenious integrated tandem cell that consisted of buried homojunction np+-Si microwires and a WO3 photoanode (Fig. 15a), leading to a low onset potential (Fig. 15b).211 However, a relatively low STH efficiency of less than 0.1% was obtained at 12 suns irradiation (Fig. 15c), which can be ascribed to the low photovoltage and the photocurrent of the WO3 photoanode. For the Fe2O3 photoanode, Wang and co-workers developed a re-growth strategy to reduce the surface disorder of the Fe2O3212 (Fig. 15d). An unbiased STH efficiency of 0.91% was achieved when a tandem cell was constructed by combining a Fe2O3 photoanode and an a-Si photocathode (Fig. 15f).

Combining a BiVO4 photoanode with a Si or chalcopyrite-based photocathode to construct a tandem cell has been an outstanding configuration since 2018, due to its high STH efficiency for overall water splitting. Jiang and co-workers designed a tandem cell based on a CZTS/CdS/HfO2/Pt photocathode and a BiVO4 photoanode (Fig. 16a) with an unbiased STH efficiency of 1.046% (the best performance in CZTS–BiVO4-based tandem cells to date) (Fig. 16b).157 Gong and co-workers demonstrated a two-step platinisation strategy to enhance the HER catalytic activity for the CIGS photocathode. When paired with a BiVO4 photoanode, the tandem cell achieved a STH conversion efficiency of 1.01% for unbiased water splitting.155 Domen and co-workers achieved an efficient CIGS photocathode by evaluating the effect of the elemental composition on the energy band position of the CIGS photocathode.213 When combined with a semi-transparent BiVO4 photoanode (Fig. 16c), an unbiased STH of 3.7% was obtained, which holds the record for the best performance for a CIGS/BiVO4 tandem cell (Fig. 16d).

In addition to chalcopyrite/BiVO4-based tandem cells, Si/BiVO4-based tandem cells also show a potential to achieve a high STH efficiency for overall water splitting. Huskens and co-workers demonstrated a light absorption and catalytic activity decoupled Si photocathode, achieving a high half-cell STH of 10.8%.214 They further combined the Si photocathode with the BiVO4 photoanode to construct a PEC tandem cell (Fig. 17a), obtaining an STH of 2.1% (Fig. 17b). Gong and co-workers developed a simple and safe method to construct a pn junction Si photocathode. When it was combined with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a tandem cell, an STH conversion efficiency of 2.09% was achieved.215 In addition, a homojunction-based Si photocathode, they designed and fabricated a Si-based metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) junction photocathode for unbiased water splitting. An illumination–reaction decoupled n-Si MIS photocathode was integrated with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a tandem cell, achieving an unbiased STH conversion efficiency of 1.71%.216 Furthermore, a higher efficiency of 1.9% was achieved when a double-sided passivated n-Si MIS photocathode was combined with a BiVO4 photoanode to realise a PEC tandem cell.217 To improve the photocurrent of the BiVO4 photoanode, a simple photoetching method was demonstrated to form surface oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced charge separation efficiency and photocurrent. Using this BiVO4 photoanode with a double-sided silicon photocathode, an unbiased tandem cell with a back-to-back configuration was demonstrated (Fig. 17c), leading to a high STH efficiency of 3.7%218 (Fig. 17d).

In addition to Si- and CIGS-based PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting. Perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention in recent years due to their advantages such as tunable band gap, low cost, and high efficiency. However, the instability of moisture, air and temperature, limits their application to PEC water splitting.
Recently, encapsulation strategies have demonstrated their potential for water splitting in aqueous solutions. Reisner and co-workers integrated a hydrogenase into a metal foil encapsulated PSC photocathode. When this PSC photocathode was combined with a BiVO4 photoanode, a self-sustaining, unbiased PEC tandem cell with an STH efficiency of 1.1% was obtained.219 A Sb2Se3 based photocathode is also an attractive material for PEC water splitting due to its low-cost, small band gap (1.1–1.2 eV) and intrinsic stability. Moon and co-workers reported a Sb2Se3–BiVO4 tandem cell with an impressive STH efficiency of 1.5%.220 A standalone prototype system consisting of a transparent, high-performance, and stable Sb2S3 photoanode and a back-illuminated Si photocathode was designed to achieve an unassisted STH efficiency of 5.2%.221
The PEC/PEC tandem configuration presents advantages for H-type cells. To optimize the performance of the photoanode and photocathode, significant efforts have been focused on structural design, defect passivation, interface modification, and kinetic increase. The STH efficiency of the PEC/PEC tandem cells have been improved from 0.1% to 5.2%. However, due to the low photocurrent of the photoanode and the insufficient onset potential of the photocathode, the STH efficiency obtained at the laboratory scale is far from the theoretical maximum target.


4.2.2 PEC/PV tandem cells for unbiased water splitting. 
Compared with the PEC/PEC tandem cells, PEC/PV tandem hybrid cells exhibit a higher STH efficiency for water splitting because of the large photovoltage provided by the PV cells (Table 5). There are two configurations of PEC/PV tandem cells (Fig. 18), one is the PV/photoelectrode integrated configuration, where the PV and counter electrode are connected by wires (Fig. 18a). The other one is the separated configuration, where the PV cell is separated from the PEC cell, and the photoelectrode and counter electrode are connected by wires (Fig. 18b). The separated PEC/PV tandem cells are easy to assemble and can avoid the corrosion of the PV cells in aqueous solution. Because of their high level of integration, integrated tandem solar cells have attracted much attention. In this section, various PV cells (DSSC, Si, PSC, and others), paired oxide photoanodes and oxide photocathodes are summarised and discussed.

 Fig. 18  Schematic illustration of PEC/PV tandem cell. (a) PV/photoelectrode integrated tandem cell and (b) separated configuration. 
(1) Oxide photoanode/PV tandem cells. 
Similar to the PEC/PEC tandem cells, oxide photoanode/PV tandem cells also utilise BiVO4, Fe2O3, and WO3 photoanodes to drive water splitting. The DSSC possesses the advantages of low cost, easy preparation, and large photovoltage (>1 V), making it an ideal absorber for integration with metal oxide photoanodes. By carefully selecting the redox mediators, surface treatment, and loading catalysts for the DSSC photoanodes, Sivula and co-workers demonstrated a WO3/DSSC integrated tandem device for unbiased water splitting with an STH conversion efficiency of 3.1% (Fig. 19a).222 A Fe2O3/DSSC tandem device was also fabricated with an STH efficiency of 1.17%. In addition to the O2 product, the photoanode also produces high value-added oxidation products such as S2O82−, Ce4+, and IO4−. Sayama and co-workers constructed a PEC/PV tandem cell in which one or two DSSCs were connected in series with a WO3 photoanode and a Pt counter electrode. The unbiased solar energy conversion efficiency of H2 and S2O82− produced in the WO3/DSSC and WO3/two DSSCs tandem system reached 1.9% and 5.2%, respectively.223 Unfortunately, the heat generated by the infrared light would damage the organic dye and the electrolyte, making the DSSCs unstable.

Compared to the DSSCs, the Si-based PV cells are highly versatile and can be integrated with a wide range of photoanode materials, including BiVO4, Fe2O3, and WO3, to enable efficient water splitting and H2 production. However, the photovoltage of single junction monocrystalline Si-based PV cells is relatively small (0.5–0.7 V). Therefore, two pieces of Si are usually connected in series to form a PEC/PV tandem cell. Sun and co-workers designed and fabricated a stable and self-sustaining PEC/PV tandem cell with a separated structure (Fig. 18b), which consists of a WO3/TiO2 photoanode, 4-jn Si and a MoS2 counter cathode (Fig. 19b). The tandem cell exhibited a STH efficiency of 3.4% with a long-term stability of up to 350 h.239 Messinger and co-workers demonstrated a solar-powered tandem device by connecting a WO3/FeOOH photoanode in series to a 2-jn a-Si solar cell and a Ni–Mo catalyst, which showed a STH efficiency of 1.8%.240 A PEC/PV split tandem cell was also designed by Smets and co-workers combining a gradient tungsten-doped W:BiVO4 photoanode with various thin-film PV cells, such as a-Si single junction, a double a-Si junction, and a-Si/nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si). Better matching of the light absorption spectrum between BiVO4 and the nc-Si cell lead to a maximum STH conversion efficiency of 5.2%241 (Fig. 19c). Using a two-piece, series connected Si PV cells as the external bias, Lee and co-workers demonstrated a precious metal-free tandem cell consisting of a CoP deposited Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanode and a CoP/Ni cathode. The tandem cell showed stable unassisted water splitting with an STH efficiency of 5.3%.242 An Si heterojunction PV cell promoted Si photocathode was constructed by Gong and co-workers to overcome the insufficient photovoltage of the Si photocathode, and an STH efficiency of 4.1% was achieved.215
Whereas Si-based PV cells have shown a high efficiency for tandem cells, the use of multiple separate PV cells results in reduced light utilization efficiency per unit area, added costs, and increased system complexity. The perovskite-based solar cells have been applied to construct PEC/PV tandem cells in recent years because of their relatively larger photovoltage (>1.0 V for the single-junction PSC). Mathews and co-workers combined a single organic–inorganic halide PSC with an Mn-doped Fe2O3 photoanode to make a separated tandem cell, which achieves a STH of 2.4% (Fig. 20a).243 When the SnOx-treated a-Fe2O3 photoanodes are combined with a single-junction PSC, the STH efficiency could be further improved to 3.4% (Fig. 20b). In contrast to Fe2O3 photoanode, the PEC/PV tandem cells using a BiVO4 photoanode can achieve a higher STH efficiency. Kamat and co-workers reported a low-cost all solution-processed tandem cell based on a BiVO4/CoPi photoanode, and a single-junction PSC (Fig. 20c), which exhibited an STH efficiency of 2.5% without external bias (Fig. 20d).244 To increase the bulk charge separation efficiency of the BiVO4 photoanode, Lee and co-workers reported ultrafast fabrication of BiVO4 by hybrid microwave annealing (HMA).245 The HMA-treated BiVO4/WO3 film achieved a bulk charge separation efficiency of ∼90% for water oxidation, when it was combined with a single-junction PSC or 2-jn Si PV cells, a STH conversion efficiencies of 4.2% or 5.0%, respectively, was obtained in unbiased overall water splitting. Cui and co-workers deposited nano-porous Mo-doped BiVO4 on an engineered nano-cone substrate to overcome the trade-off between short carrier diffusion length and sufficient light absorption. This nanostructured Mo:BiVO4 photoanode was connected in tandem with a single PSC, which exhibited 6.2% STH efficiency.246 Yang and co-workers developed an engineered light-trapping architecture to enhance the charge separation, in which an inverse nano-cone array (ICA) substrate was used to support nano-porous Mo:BiVO4 films. By connecting the ICA-photoanode with a band gap-adjustable PSC (Fig. 20e), a PEC/PV tandem cell with an STH efficiency of about 6.3% was obtained247 (Fig. 20f).

The PEC/PV tandem cells powered by III–V-based solar cells, organic solar cells (OSC) and Cu2ZnSnS4 solar cells also have been demonstrated. Pihosh et al. demonstrated a PEC–PV tandem device based on a nanostructured WO3/BiVO4/CoPi photoanode and a GaAs/InGaAsP solar cell.248 By modulating the light absorption, a high photocurrent of 6.56 mA cm−2, corresponding to an STH efficiency of 8.1% was achieved. Using a semi-transparent single-junction OSC as the front photoelectrode, BiVO4 as the rear cell, a PEC/PV tandem cell was obtained with an STH efficiency of 2.2%.249 Jiang et al. first developed a BiVO4/CZTS PEC/PV tandem device with an STH conversion efficiency of 1.46% based on aqueous co-electrodeposited CZTS solar cells.237
Metal oxide photoanodes often exhibit a lower photocurrent than PV cells due to their wide band gap. Constructing a dual absorber photoanode using different metal oxides is a viable way to improve light harvesting efficiency. A bias-free water splitting device consisting of modified BiVO4, α-Fe2O3 dual photoanodes, and two pieces in parallel connected Si solar cells (2p Si) was demonstrated by Lee and co-workers (Fig. 21a). A high STH efficiency of 7.7% was obtained, higher than that obtained from the BiVO4/2p Si (5.6%) or a-Fe2O3/2p c-Si (3.9%) tandem cells180 (Fig. 21b). Compared with single photoanodes, the dual BiVO4 photoanodes showed enhanced light absorption at 400–520 nm, leading to an improved photocurrent density from 5.13 to 5.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. A tandem device consisting of BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH dual photoanodes (Fig. 21c) and a single PSC cell, achieved a 6.5% STH conversion efficiency250 (Fig. 21d). Van de Krol and co-workers demonstrated a new benchmark for large-area PEC/PV tandem devices composed of a W:BiVO4/CoPi photoanode and Si heterojunction solar cells (Fig. 21e).251 The optimised large area (50 cm2) PEC/PV tandem devices showed an STH efficiency of 1.9% (single W:BiVO4/CoPi photoanode and 2-series connected Si cells), and 2.1% (dual W:BiVO4/CoPi photoanodes and 2-series connected Si cells) (Fig. 21f). With improved STH efficiency and a larger area, the PEC/PV tandem cells are attractive for alleviating the complex designed requirements for photovoltaic/water redox in PEC/PEC tandem cells.

(2) Other PEC/PV tandem cells. 
Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) is a representative oxide photocathode for HER, and a Cu2O photoelectrode/PV tandem cell has also been demonstrated and significantly advances of STH efficiency has been made in recent years. Mayer and co-workers employed Cu2O as a top absorber and investigated the effect of the transparency of Cu2O film on the efficiency of the tandem cells.252 Reasonable light transmittance and performance can be obtained by depositing Cu2O onto a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate, coated with a thin film of Au. This transparent Cu2O photocathode is demonstrated in tandem with a hybrid PSC (Fig. 22a), enabling a STH efficiency of 2.5% for unbiased water splitting (Fig. 22b). To avoid electron–hole recombination at the Au back contact, Hagfeldt and co-workers proposed a Cu2O photocathode using solution-processed CuSCN as an effective hole-transport layer. A stand-alone PEC/PV tandem cell consists of this Cu2O photocathode and a single-junction PSC (Fig. 22c) and provides an STH conversion efficiency of 4.55% (Fig. 22d), which is a record for the efficiency of all the Cu2O based dual-absorber tandem cells.163

In addition to oxide photoelectrode/PV tandem cells, Shen and co-workers reported a PEC/PV tandem cell based on Si (Fig. 22e). A PEC/PV tandem cell was designed and fabricated, which consists of an Si/Ni/Ni–Mo photocathode, a Si/Ni/Ni–Mo photoanode, and two series-connected Si PV cells. It achieves spontaneous water splitting in alkaline solution with a high STH efficiency of 9.8% and a stability of more than 100 h253 (Fig. 22f).


4.2.3 Monolithic PEC tandem devices. 
Compared to PEC/PEC and PEC/PV tandem cells with separated photoanode/photocathode configurations, monolithic tandem cells have a compact and integrated structure. Therefore, the ionic change membrane between the photoanode and the photocathode can be eliminated, leading to a higher light absorption for the back photoelectrode. The small distance between the electrodes also minimises ohmic losses. Moreover, the monolithic structure allows for a more compact reactor design, less electrolyte filling, and a smaller space usage. Thus, monolithic tandem cells are considered to be a feasible way to achieve unbiased water splitting. However, recent studies demonstrated that the main limitation of these tandem cells is still due to the incompatibility of the manufacturing process of each component, interfacial defects and energy band mismatch, thus monolithic tandem cells are rarely reported for use in unbiased unassisted water splitting (Table 6).

Monolithic tandem cells were first realised by Bockris and co-workers using 3-jn a-Si solar cells.174 Specifically, a RuOx layer and Pt islands were deposited on the back and top side of the solar cell to facilitate OER and HER, respectively. This Pt/3-jn a-Si/RuOx monolithic PEC tandem cell realised a STH efficiency of 5% under simulated radiation (100 mW cm−2). Nocera and co-workers employed earth-abundant catalysts to fabricate a wireless tandem cell. As a result, the NiMoZn/3-jn a-Si/Co monolithic tandem cell exhibited an STH efficiency of 2.5%.203 It should be noted that the wireless tandem cells are less efficient than wired cells (3-jn a-Si/Co connected to Ni mesh/NiMoZn alloy HER catalyst) due to the ineffective contact losses and longer ionic conduction distance.
Lewerenz and co-workers reported efficient monolithic PEC tandem cells (Fig. 23a), which achieved a high STH efficiency of 19.3% and 18.5% in acidic and neutral solutions, respectively, (Fig. 23b).177 This tandem cell consists of a dual-junction III–V solar cell, a TiO2 protective layer, and a Rh and RuO2 catalyst. Therefore, the efficiency of this unbiased cell can reach >20%, which is an important step towards the practical application of unbiased water splitting. Moreover, Yang and co-workers designed a fully integrated system for unbiased solar water splitting.265 The integrated system consists of an Si nanowire photocathode, TiO2 nanowire photoanode, an interfacial layer for charge transfer, and a cocatalyst layer to facilitate HER and OER. Under simulated sunlight (3 suns), this nanoscale tree-like photoelectrode achieved a 0.12% solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, which is comparable to that of natural photosynthesis. However, further improvements in efficiency are limited by the incompatible annealing conditions for metal oxides and PV-grade semiconductors. For metal oxides, the current process temperature generally exceeds 400 °C, which will damage the buried junction of the PV photoelectrodes (a-Si, PSC, and so on). Therefore, a new fabrication technique needs to be explored and developed to overcome the trade-off between the high annealing temperature and low built-in electric field.

The back-to-back feature offers an alternative structure to integrate two hybrid tandem cells, where the two absorbers are fabricated on respective conductive substrates (FTO glass, ITO glass, and others), and the glass sides of both substrates are mechanically stacked, and the conductive sides are connected by wires. With this configuration, two distinct photoelectrodes are produced separately, thereby avoiding incompatible manufacturing conditions and interfacial issues. Lee and co-workers designed a stand-alone back-to-back solar water splitting device with Mo:BiVO4 as the front cell and a metal halide PSC as the rear cell, which produced stoichiometric H2 and O2 with an unbiased STH efficiency of 3.0%.259 It should be noted that, to mitigate the moisture-sensitivity of the PSC, the material was completely sealed during the tandem cell fabrication. Furthermore, to make the solar water splitting device scalable and durable, Reisner and co-workers pointed out the potential of using a PSC–BiVO4 monolithic PEC device for unbiased water splitting.266 By employing a state-of-the-art caesium formamidinium methylammonium triple cation mixed halide PSC as the absorber, NiOx as the hole selective layer and Field's metal-epoxy as the encapsulated layer, substantial improvements have been achieved in stability (up to 7 h) and efficiency (13.0 ± 1.2%). When this PSC-based photocathode is combined with a robust BiVO4/TiCo photoanode in the back-to-back configuration (Fig. 23c), an integrated PEC tandem was obtained, which exhibited a remarkable stability of up to 12 h with a corresponding STH conversion efficiency of 0.37 ± 0.08%266 (Fig. 23d).
Gong and co-workers also reported an “artificial leaf” using a back-illuminated Si photocathode and a BiVO4 photoanode, achieving a high STH efficiency (3.7%).218 This high STH efficiency can be ascribed to the back-to-back configuration, which eliminates the parasitic light absorption of the membrane and the solution between the photoanode and photocathode. A higher unbiased water splitting efficiency is achieved for metal oxide–DSSC monolithic tandem cells. Park and co-workers reported a sandwich infiltration process to produce a highly transparent BiVO4-sensitised mesoporous WO3 films, and when it was combined with a single DSSC in a monolithic tandem configuration, co-evolution of O2 and H2 was achieved with a high STH efficiency of 5.7%.267 The efficiency of a WO3/BiVO4–DSSC monolithic tandem cell was further improved to 7.1% by Shi et al.268 This high efficiency could be attributed to the incorporation of a conductive hybrid distributed Bragg reflector, which acts as both an optical filter to solve the trade-off between the light transmittance and the absorption of the front of the PEC cell.
Although the back-to-back structure is a novel structure that integrates the hybrid absorbers into a monolithic cell, the optical losses caused by FTO glasses, ohmic losses caused by the long distances for ion transport, and the increased cost relative to the wireless tandem cells, cannot to be ignored. To make the monolithic tandem devices more cost-effective, alternative low temperature processes are needed to guarantee the photoactivity and stability of the PV-based photoelectrode. For the interfacial lattice mismatch, understanding the interface properties between different absorbers is crucial for enhancing the charge transport. In addition, a deeper understanding of the ion transport in the monolithic cell is important to reduce the energy losses.

4.3 The state-of-the-art PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting
The PEC tandem cells for unbiased water splitting have gained tremendous attention in last few decades (Fig. 11), and the efficiency benchmarks of the PEC tandem cell with different configurations by end of 2022 are summarised in Fig. 24. Tandem cells with a PEC/PV configuration present a higher STH efficiency than PEC/PEC tandem cells. This is because a higher intersection point can be obtained in the PEC/PV than in the PEC/PEC configuration. In the PEC/PV configuration, there is no limitation for potential matching between a semiconductor and water redox, because the PV part is considered as an external bias, therefore PVs such as multi-junction amorphous Si or PSCs with a large photovoltage of ∼1 V are widely used. The highest STH efficiency (19.3%) for unbiased water splitting was achieved using a 3-jn III–V semiconductor,177 which is the only result that exceeds 10% efficiency. This suggests that enhancing the driving force by constructing multi-junction structures is an effective approach for unbiased water splitting. Nevertheless, the high cost of III–V materials is a challenge for practical utilisation. In contrast, BiVO4 represents a cost-effective photoanode that exhibits a low onset potential and moderate photocurrent density, making it a prominent candidate at the present stage and in the foreseeable future (Fig. 24). However, the STH efficiency of a tandem cell based on a BiVO4 photoanode cannot reach the target of 10%, because the theoretically maximum photocurrent of BiVO4 is 7.5 mA cm−2, which corresponds to a STH efficiency of 7.5 mA × 1.23 V = 9.2%.50 Therefore, alternative photoanode with high photocurrent and low onset potential is highly desired.

5. Conclusions and outlook
The efficiency of the tandem cell for PEC unbiased water splitting is dependent on the intersection point value. This value is determined by the photocurrent, photovoltage, and fill factor of both the photocathode and photoanode. Therefore, in the past few years, there has been a great amount of research interest and effort to enhance the photoactivity of photoelectrodes. In this paper, we have reviewed various single photoelectrodes for water reduction or oxidation, and highlighted the current state-of-the-art discoveries. Furthermore, the unbiased PEC water splitting cell was disassembled into PEC and PEC/PV configurations, and the current research status is summarised. Together with the unceasing investigation by researchers all over the world, the performance of the unbiased PEC water splitting cell has been raised by an order of magnitude compared to the ones used a decade ago. In separate papers, the STH of unbiased PEC has reached 19.3%, which is beyond the target for its use in practical applications.
Despite the above achievements in unbiased PEC water splitting, the solar hydrogen production is still far from the touchstone for practical applications. There are still many challenges for future investigation:
(1) The long-term stability and hydrogen production velocity (i.e., STH efficiency) of the PEC tandem cells are the prerequisites for improving the competitiveness of solar hydrogen production. Referring to the same solar utilisation devices, Si solar cells, the commercial modules, are usually sold with a guarantee that they will retain at least 80% of their initial efficiency after more than 20 years of use. However, even at the laboratory scale, the stability of unbiased PEC water-splitting cells cannot exceed half a year. Generally, there is a trade-off between performance and stability for photoelectrode materials. Oxide-based photoelectrodes with a wide band gap present a high stability in harsh solutions but exhibit low STH efficiencies. In contrast, despite a series of impressive STH efficiencies achieved on narrow band gap photoelectrodes such as a-Si, CIGS, Cu2O, GaAs, PSCs, and Si, the poor stability is the main obstacle for the construction of unbiased tandem PEC cells. Hence, a metal layer or metal oxides were developed to prevent the photoelectrode degradation. A metal layer with a high density of free electrons leads to severe parasitic absorption of light, which reduces the light absorption of the back photoelectrode in the tandem cells. Compared with the metal protective layer, the metal oxide protective layer has the advantages of high light transmittance and chemical inertness over a wide pH range. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely used photoelectrode protection layer. Nevertheless, unexpected performance decreases were often discovered from the TiO2 protected photoelectrode over time. The underlying degradation mechanism is still a mystery, and there are three possible reasons for this: pinholes, self-reduction in cathodic potential, and reduced Ti3+ by light irradiation. Emerging in situ or operando characterisation such as infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy can provide more profound insights by probing the PEC processes directly.251–254
(2) In addition to the stability for the unbiased PEC tandem cells, the STH efficiency is equally important for hydrogen production. Although substantial progress has been made in improving the STH efficiency of unbiased PEC water splitting in recent years, there remains a significant disparity between the theoretical maximum and the realised efficiency. The limited efficiency of PEC water splitting systems is mainly attributed to the low photocurrent of the photoanode, which impedes the performance of systems where the photoanode and photocathode are connected in series. Even the most promising photoanode at the moment, BiVO4, cannot meet the target STH because the theoretical maximum photocurrent of BiVO4 is 7.5 mA cm−2 (corresponding STH is: 7.5 mA × 1.23 V = 9.2%). Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore a new material that can deliver a high photovoltage and photocurrent simultaneously. Perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for acting as the photoelectrode in the construction of PEC tandem cells. This is due to their exceptional light absorption efficiency, as well as the fact that their band gap can be tuned. In addition, their low cost renders them a viable option for large-scale production. Tandem solar cells such as perovskite/Si and perovskite/CIGS are the emerging research topics in photovoltaics and water splitting, and the impressive efficiency of 25% was achieved. Therefore, perovskite-based photoelectrodes have emerged as showing promise for achieving unbiased water splitting.
(3) In addition to stability and efficiency for PEC tandem cells, the hydrogen production rate is another crucial consideration for meeting commercial requirements. To achieve commercially viable rates of hydrogen production, it is necessary to scale up the area of the photoelectrodes and redesign the corresponding reactor accordingly.272 However, the uniformity, components, thickness, and other associated properties of the photoelectrode materials, protective layer and catalyst deposition cannot be guaranteed in mass production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a large area or batch thin-film deposition techniques,273 to overcome this dilemma. Moreover, when operating tandem cells at high current densities, mass transfer and pH gradients become significant concerns.64 It is essential to incorporate forced flow into the reactor used for PEC tandem cells.274,275 The light management should be considered in the reactor design to maximise the photoelectrode light absorption.
(4) In order to prevent the formation of explosive mixtures of H2 and O2, it is necessary to utilize membranes that can isolate the photocathode (catholyte) and photoanode (anolyte) while still allowing for the transport of ions in the unbiased PEC water splitting cells. The monopolar membranes such as anion exchange membrane (AEM) or cation exchange membrane (CEM) allow the transport of single types of ions, resulting in different pHs on both sides of the membrane. A bipolar membrane can eliminate the pH gradient across the membrane, which allows the photocathode and photoanode to work in different pH environments. Despite several qualities that the membranes present, the high cost, poor stability, and parasitic light absorption may be the factors that reduce the performance and stability of the unbiased PEC water splitting.
(5) During the process of unbiased PEC water splitting, the formation of H2 and O2 bubbles on the surface of the photoelectrode can lead to significant losses in kinetic performance, Ohmic resistance, and light absorption. Specifically, the bubbles formed on the surface of the photoelectrode reduce the active sites and increase the resistance, and the bubble-electrolyte interface aggravates light reflection and refraction. Although dynamic bubble behaviours in (photo)electrochemical water splitting have been systematically investigated,276–281 little attention has been paid to the effect of bubbles on the efficiency and stability of the overall PEC tandem system. Accelerated bubble growth and detachment behaviours are crucial for the development of efficient reactors for the PEC tandem water splitting.
(6) Power mismatch between the photoanode and the photocathode is another rarely investigated but critical factor in PEC tandem cells, which leads to unexpected energy loss and STH efficiencies. The output power of tandem cells can be altered by modifying the active area of the photoelectrodes. However, the optimal area ratio between the two components is not well-defined. This can result in suboptimal charge transfer and unexpected energy losses, limiting the overall performance of the system. Hence, the power match principle of photoelectrodes with different bandgaps for unbiased PEC water splitting should be investigated more systematically.
(7) In the PEC water splitting process, H2 is the desired product, whereas O2 is the by-product. The oxygen evolution is known to be kinetically unfavourable, leading to high overpotentials and low energy conversion efficiency in unbiased PEC water splitting. Furthermore to make unbiased PEC water splitting competitive, it is urgent that a thermodynamic and more favourable kinetic reaction than water oxidation is explored. Recent research efforts have focused on replacing the OER in PEC water splitting with alternative reactions such as biomass conversion, including the oxidation of various organic molecules such as ammonia, ethanol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), methanol, and urea, which have been shown to achieve significantly reduced overpotentials compared to water oxidation. However, there are still challenges to be addressed in the development of efficient and selective catalysts for biomass oxidation and organic molecule oxidation, as well as in the optimisation of the reaction conditions and system configurations. In addition, the use of biomass conversion in unbiased PEC water splitting cells may require different system designs and components compared to the traditional water splitting, necessitating further research and development in this area.282–285
We believe that future research on unbiased PEC water splitting cells is certainly not limited to what is discussed in this paper. With the great potential and ongoing progress achieved by researchers, the unbiased PEC tandem cell for water splitting will be achieved soon.
