    , Accepted 27th May 2022First published on 31st May 2022AbstractMorphological optimization has proved to be one crucial factor contributing to the 19% efficiency of Y6-based organic solar cells (OSCs). Although the relationship between component miscibility and film morphology has been established, it has not been clarified how the film formation processes proceed, especially for methods compatible with large-area fabrication, i.e. slot-die coating, which restricts the further optimization of the morphology. Herein, we comprehensively investigate the effect of miscibility and the film-formation kinetic process on film morphology during processing with different solvents. A highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.38% can be obtained in a D18:Y6 device processed with slot-die coating in an open-air environment. However, due to their relatively poor miscibility, incorporating a trace amount of chlorobenzene (CB) into CF can sufficiently promote Y6 aggregation, leading to increased phase separation and thus the average PCE drops to 15.16%. In contrast, a PM6:Y6 blend shows insensitive changes in the kinetic process as well as the final morphology, and thus in the comparable PCEs when cast with different solvents, which is ascribed to their relatively good miscibility. This work provides scientific guidelines for device optimization by combining the intermediate gap from miscibility to kinetic process and their impact on final morphology.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have a bright future due to their various advantages, including flexibility, light weight, low cost, translucency, and large-area processing.1–6 During recent years, researchers have put great efforts into the material design, morphological control, device engineering, and large-area fabrication of OSCs.7–14 In particular, with the advent of the sparkling performance of non-fullerene acceptor Y6 (ref. 10) and its derivatives, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 19%, suggesting their great potential in practical application.13,14 The emergence of Y6 and its derivatives has greatly contributed to the great prosperity of OSCs, achieving a breakthrough in efficiency and substantially accelerating the development of OSCs. Y6 employs a ladder-type electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring (dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) with a benzothiadiazole (BT) core to fine-tune its absorption and electron affinity.10 The unique morphology that Y6 forms, such as 2D packing with a polymer-like conjugated backbone oriented normal to the substrate, is beneficial for improving carrier transport, which is conducive to improvement in efficiency.15
The morphology of the active layer is one of the most critical factors in determining the performance of a device.16–25 Typically, solution-processed active layers feature a complex hierarchical structure, consisting of parameters with different length scales, such as crystallinity, molecular orientation, domain size, and domain purity.26–28 Small changes in material chemistry and process conditions can result in significant differences in morphology and corresponding device performance.29,30 The miscibility between donor and acceptor is a crucial thermodynamic factor reflecting the trend of phase separation during solution processing.31–33 Different chemical species usually exhibit varied miscibilities between the two materials, which tremendously affects their final morphology. For example, thermodynamic characterization indicates room-temperature miscibility for D18:Y6 near the percolation threshold, which corresponds to an ideal quenching depth and explains the near-ideal morphology for annealing using solvent vapor. In stark contrast, D18:IEICO-4Cl is a low-miscibility system with a deep quenching depth during casting, which leads to poor morphological control and low performance.34 In addition, the PDCBT-Cl:Y6 system with high miscibility results in a deficiency of phase separation, low domain purity, and poor crystallinity, and thus a poor PCE of only 0.46%.32 On the other hand, alterations in film formation kinetics, which probably adjust the phase separation and aggregation behaviors of organic semiconductor materials, can affect the final morphology, even if the miscibility between the components remains unchanged.35–37 For example, Liu et al. found that the PM6:Y6 system had a completely different morphology and performance when processed with CF and CB.14 The cause is the different arrangement structures of Y6, in which face-on orientation in CF film and low crystallinity and random crystal orientation in CB film can be observed. This leads to the decreased PCE in the CB device. Lin et al. concluded that by matching the preaggregation rates between donor and acceptor during the film formation process with temperature-controlled slot-die coating, optimized domain size and crystallinity can be achieved, which contributes to a PCE of 13.2% in PM7:IT4F.36 As analyzed above, although the relationship between component miscibility and film morphology has been established, it has not been clarified how those phase separation and aggregation processes occur in systems with different miscibilities, which restricts an understanding of the mechanism of morphological evolution and thus the further morphological optimization in those efficient blended systems.
In this paper, we select two high-efficiency systems to investigate the effect of miscibility and the film-formation kinetic process on film morphology during processing with different solvents. In order to obtain aggregation information and the spatial distribution of the fluorophores and quencher within the blends during the solution-to-solid phase transformation, in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and in situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed. We found that in the low-miscibility D18 (ref. 11):Y6 (ref. 10) system, the solution states of chloroform (CF) and mixed solvents (MS) (CF as the primary solvent with 0.5% v/v CB) are the same at the beginning of film formation. However, the solution concentration increases during the 0.5 s of film formation time while the strong interactions in chlorobenzene (CB) lead to enhanced aggregation and excessive phase separation and thus deterioration in device performance. Therefore, D18:Y6 exhibits the highest PCE of 17.38% in a CF device due to its optimal morphology. In comparison, the average PCEs for MS and CB devices exhibit 15.16% and 13.44%, respectively. The film formation of the high-miscibility system PM6 (ref. 38):Y6 in CF and MS is analogous, leading to little variability in morphology or device performance. Therefore, devices based on the PM6:Y6 system obtain 14.70%, 14.23%, and 14.01% average efficiency when processed with CF, MS and CB, respectively. Our results suggest a powerful strategy for morphological optimization by considering both the miscibility and kinetic factors so as to control the phase separation and aggregation behaviors.
Results and discussion
Here, we chose two efficient blended systems, D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6, to study the effect of miscibility and the film-formation kinetic process on film morphology and device performance. The chemical structures and energy levels of D18, PM6, and Y6 are displayed in Fig. 1a and S1 (ESI†), respectively. The energy levels of D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 are well aligned to split photon-generated excitons. The selection of the solvent is pivotal in device preparation and has a direct association with the final morphology. Currently, device processing in laboratories needs to select solvents by the trial-and-error method as so to achieve efficient devices. While the intrinsic reasons for the different morphologies caused by different solvents should be further clarified. In our work, we chose the two most commonly used solvents, CF and CB, to adjust their blend film morphology. We firstly performed contact angle measurements to study the interaction and miscibility among different components. The results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The interaction parameters, calculated according to the Flory–Huggins model, are 0.64 for χD18, Y6 and 0.58 for χPM6, Y6, demonstrating better miscibility between PM6 and Y6 compared to that between D18 and Y6 (Fig. 1b). To further investigate the interactions between polymers and Y6, we designed an experiment that used the in situ temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the bilayer structure to verify the diffusion ability between polymers and Y6. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), we prepared a structure with the lower layer as the donor D18 or PM6 and the upper layer as the acceptor Y6 to observe the change in the signal for Y6 under the effect of temperature. Time-dependent contour maps of the PL spectra are shown in Fig. 1c and d for PM6/Y6 and D18/Y6, respectively. The PL intensity of the bilayers of both systems is found to be reduced under the influence of temperature, as shown in Fig. 1e. The bilayer absorbs photons to generate excitons under the light source, and the diffusion of excitons is intensified under the thermal effect, while the rapid quenching of excitons is due to the presence of the donor–acceptor interface that causes the reduction in PL intensity. The donor–acceptor interface originates from two aspects: one is the original interface of the bilayer, and the other is the mixed region resulting from the rapid diffusion of Y6 into polymers with the thermal effect. In PM6/Y6, the intensity changed more strongly, while the change in the signal was relatively limited in the D18/Y6 system. The decrease in PL signal intensity may qualitatively respond to the diffusion of Y6 at the interface. Therefore, we qualitatively confirmed the better interdiffusion behavior between Y6 and PM6 from the above experiments, further suggesting their good miscibility.

To better understand the effect of CF and CB solvents on the morphology of the active layer, a mixed solvent (MS) with a CF/CB blend ratio of 99.5/0.5 (V/V) was also employed to process the blended film so as to figure out the difference between CB and CF. The aggregation states of Y6 solutions and solid-state blended films were investigated by ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1f, the initial aggregation states of Y6 in both CF and MS solvents are consistent, with the two lines coinciding exactly. In CB solvent, there is a slight overall blue-shift of the Y6 absorption peak, which proves its weaker aggregation state. The aggregation state of Y6 in the solid film is enhanced significantly compared to its solution state, and the peak position is significantly red-shifted. Fig. 1g and h show the thin-film absorption spectra of PM6:Y6 and D18:Y6 processed with different solvents. For D18:Y6, a trace amount of CB made the peak position of Y6 significantly red-shifted (from 816 to 840 nm), close to the position of the CB-processed film. While for PM6:Y6, a trace amount of CB did not affect the peak position of Y6. This indicates the dramatically different aggregation of Y6 in the two blended systems, probably resulting from their various miscibilities. We next studied how those different processing solvents affect the device performance and clarified the underlying mechanisms.
We prepared inverted devices with the structure of glass/ITO/ZnO/D18(PM6):Y6/MoO3/Al using slot-die coating under ambient conditions. Fig. 2a shows a schematic of the slot-die coating. The short-circuit current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding parameters are shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, respectively. In order to compare the PCE difference more intuitively, a histogram of the PCEs is illustrated in Fig. 2c. D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 are both high-efficiency systems, but their efficiency varies greatly when they are treated with different solvents. PM6:Y6 devices can obtain high PCEs of around 14% processed with CF, MS and CB, which are not significantly affected by solvents. While only the D18:Y6 device cast with CF can obtain a high PCE of 17.38%. When treated with CB, the reductions in short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) lead to a serious reduction in device performance. When using MS, we found that the introduction of a trace amount of CB had a significant effect on D18:Y6, while the efficiency of the PM6:Y6 system was slightly reduced in comparison. Fig. 2d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices cast with different solvents. The current densities obtained from the EQE curves are consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurements.

Physics processes of the devices, including charge generation, transport and extraction, were studied to explain the difference in efficiency induced by the processing solvents. Firstly, the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) was analyzed,39,40 where Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD (JL and JD are the current density under light illumination and in the dark, respectively) and Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va (V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage). As shown in Fig. 2e, for D18:Y6, the CF devices show a higher Jph/Jsat ratio (92.15%) than those of the MS (86.19%) and CB devices (78.57%) under short-circuit conditions, indicating that the introduction of CB has affected charge extraction and carrier recombination. The exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiency are more severely reduced in the CB-processed D18:Y6 device. The Jph/Jsat ratios of CF, MS and CB in the PM6:Y6 system are 91.63%, 91.28% and 87.32%, respectively, indicating that the CF device has the most efficient dissociation efficiency, while it is slightly reduced in the MS device. In addition, the carrier recombination mechanism was studied by measuring the dependence of JSC and VOC under varied illumination intensities. Generally, the dependence of JSC on light intensity (P) can be used to characterize the bimolecular recombination. JSC is proportional to Pα, where α is the power-law exponent that can be extracted from fitting the slope of the data plotted on a log–log scale.41,42 The relationship between VOC and P can be used to distinguish whether bimolecular recombination (the slope of kT/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T represents the absolute temperature) or trap-assisted recombination (2 kT/q) dominates the recombination mechanism.42,43 As shown in Fig. 2f and g, for D18:Y6, the α values of the CF, MS and CB devices are 0.927, 0.918 and 0.907, respectively, indicating the lower bimolecular recombination of the CF devices. While in the PM6:Y6 system, the α values of the CF, MS and CB devices are 0.951, 0.937 and 0.927, respectively, exhibiting a similar trend to the D18:Y6 system. Besides, for D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6, the CF devices show small slopes of 1.17 kT/q and 1.28 kT/q, while the CB devices show large slopes of 1.45 kT/q and 1.37 kT/q, suggesting the weak trap-assisted recombination of the CF devices. For the D18:Y6/MS device, the introduction of CB leads to an increase in bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, resulting in a gradual decrease in device performance. The introduction of CB into the PM6:Y6 system has hardly any effect on the trap-assisted recombination since the CF and MS devices have the same slope of 1.28 kT/q. Moreover, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were measured under different conditions using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 2h and i, for the D18:Y6 system, both μh and μe have higher values and the μh/μe ratio is more balanced in the CF device. However, the values of μh and μe are severely reduced and out of balance in MS devices. The values of μe are calculated to be 4.14 × 10−4 and 3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CF and MS devices, respectively, while the μh values of the corresponding devices are 4.58 × 10−4 and 4.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The weakened and unbalanced charge carrier motions indicate unfavorable competition between charge recombination and charge generation, which further affects the FF values. In the PM6:Y6 system, the values of μe were calculated to be 3.42 × 10−4 and 3.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CF and MS devices, respectively, and the μh values of the corresponding devices were 3.71 × 10−4 and 3.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The values of μh and μe are weakly reduced when the processing solvent is changed from CF to MS; therefore the FF values are maintained.
The performance of the OSCs is directly related to the morphology of the active layer. Therefore, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)44 measurement was used to study the molecular packing and crystallinity in D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 films prepared by slot-die coating with different solvents. Fig. 3a and b and Fig. 3c show the 2D-GIWAXS images and the corresponding line profiles of D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 blended films. All blends exhibit face-on preferential orientation. In addition, to quantify the molecular crystallinity, the crystalline coherence length (CCL), which is closely related to the charge transport and device performance, is extracted from GIWAXS line profiles according to the Scherrer equation,45 as summarized in Table 2. With the incorporation of CB, the D18:Y6 blend shows sharper (100) lamellar packing (q = 0.29 Å−1), while the PM6:Y6 blend shows no significant change in (100) lamellar packing (q = 0.28 Å−1), indicating the strong effect of CB on D18 alignment and the limited effect on PM6 film. For the D18:Y6 film the CCL of the MS blends (99.66 Å) is higher than that of the CF film (94.27 Å). While the CCL of the MS blends (69.98 Å) is only slightly improved over that of the CF blends (69.39 Å) in PM6:Y6. For CB films, the (100) peaks of both systems are greatly enhanced compared to CF films with CCL enhanced from 94.27 Å and 69.39 Å to 151.9 Å and 95.64 Å for D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 systems, respectively. The CCL of D18 is increased by 6% and 61% in MS and CB films, respectively, compared to CF film, which corresponds to a decrease in PCE from 17.1% to 15.3% and 13.4%. By comparing the changes in the arrangement of the two donors, we can observe that the effect of a trace amount of CB on the crystallinity of D18 and PM6 is different. A trace amount of CB has a profound effect on the behavior of D18, while the arrangement of PM6 remains almost unchanged in comparison.

Then we performed resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS)46 to further probe the phase separation under different conditions. We used 286.8 and 284.2 eV X-rays to gain high scattering contrast on the D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 blended films, respectively, and Fig. 3d and e show the RSoXS line profiles. The phase separation parameters were extracted and are summarized in Table S2.† Impressively, for D18:Y6, the CF and MS blended films show scattering peaks at q = 0.181 and 0.157 nm−1, respectively, exhibiting a much larger domain size for the MS film (23.84 nm) than that of the CF film (17.32 nm). However, the domain size is only weakly enhanced from CF (32.98 nm) to MS (33.90 nm) in PM6:Y6 films. The trace of CB has a profound effect on the morphology of D18:Y6. In addition, we also investigated the morphology of the active layer using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the D18:Y6 system, as shown in Fig. S6a and b,† the surface morphology of the CF film is relatively smooth, with an average mean square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.26 nm and an obvious fibrous structure in the corresponding phase diagram. However, when processed with CB, the surface roughness increases significantly with Rq of 3.72 nm, which may have a negative impact on charge generation and collection. As a result, relatively poor JSC and FF values are observed in the CB-processed D18:Y6 devices. TEM images also show that D18:Y6 films have a highly regular structural arrangement when processed with CB, exhibiting a significantly larger phase separation as well as a large enhancement of the D18 arrangement regularity (Fig. S6e and f†). In contrast, in the PM6:Y6 system, the surface roughness of the film increases slightly when processed with CB compared to CF, with the average Rq increasing from 1.44 to 1.56 nm (Fig. S6c and d†), which corresponds well to a limited increase in the size of the TEM phase region (Fig. S6g and h†), and thus the nearly unchanged device performance. Therefore, D18 in the D18:Y6 system exhibits strong aggregation behavior when processed with CB, resulting in a dramatic increase in crystallinity and phase separation, which severely affects the exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes.
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the morphological evolution during film drying in slot-die coating under different conditions, in situ spectroscopy measurements were performed. Fig. 4a–c and 4e–g show the time evolution of the UV-vis absorption contour maps of D16 and PM6:Y6 films in different solvents, where the raw in situ UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S7.† The UV-vis absorption spectra are calculated from the transmission spectra according to the equation Aλ = −log10(T), where Aλ is the absorbance at a certain wavelength (λ) and T is the measured transmittance after background correction using blank glass.47 Fig. S8a–c and S8e and f† show the time evolution of the photoluminescence (PL) contour maps of D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 films in different solvents, where the raw data are shown in Fig. S9.†Fig. 4d and h show the time evolution of the Y6 peak location extracted from in situ UV-vis absorption in D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 films, respectively. The evolution of peak location represents the aggregation behavior of donor and acceptor. Fig. S8d and S8h† show the time evolution of integral PL intensity, which can be correlated to the spatial distribution of fluorophores and quencher within the blends.48 Y6 peak evolution can be divided into three stages: (1) during the first stage, as the solvent evaporates, Y6 absorption peaks do not evolve, while its integral PL intensity reduces slowly at the beginning and then decreases rapidly due to the increased solution concentration. The reduction in integral PL intensity indicates that the average distance between the homogenously distributed fluorophores and quencher decreases as the relative concentration increases. Moreover, CB takes the longest time to complete this process from the point of view of timescale, while the time for MS is slightly longer than that of CF. (2) During the second stage, as the solvent continuously evaporates, the solution concentration crosses the solubility limit and reaches critical supersaturation. Under such extreme supersaturation, the absorption peak location of Y6 starts to red-shift, while the integral PL intensity further decreases, indicating the onset of Y6 aggregation. As shown in Fig. 4d and h, the red-shift onset of Y6 peak location in the CF blend happens earlier than that in the MS blend, indicating that Y6 molecules aggregate in advance of the incorporation of CB. (3) As the solvent further evaporates, the Y6 absorption peak exhibits a continuous red-shift and then stabilizes when all the solvents are removed at the third stage. By comparing the signal changes, we found that the Y6 signal in the two systems showed a dramatic difference after the change in solvents. We found an interesting phenomenon where the introduction of a trace amount of CB could cause a significant red-shift of the Y6 peak position in the D18:Y6 system, and the final state of Y6 in MS is consistent with that in CB, indicating significant aggregation. However, we did not find this phenomenon in the PM6:Y6 system, and the introduction of CB did not have an obvious effect on Y6 aggregation. The aggregation behavior of Y6 in the mixed solvent is much closer to that in CF. Therefore, Y6 in the D18:Y6 system is strongly affected by a trace of CB. For the D18:Y6 system, the trace of CB changed the aggregation and the position of the final absorption peak of Y6 due to the increased film drying time combined with the poor miscibility between D18 and Y6, which leads to excessive phase separation size and crystallinity of D18 in the film.

On the basis of all the results discussed above, we have gained a whole picture (Fig. 5) of how a trace of CB enables the aggregation of Y6 in D18:Y6 and PM6:Y6 systems. In the solution state, a trace amount of CB does not affect the aggregation states of Y6 in the two systems. During the film formation process, the total concentration increases with solvent evaporation, and the Y6 aggregation in the D18:Y6 system becomes more obvious (Fig. 4d) due to the poor miscibility between D18 and Y6 and the extended molecular diffusion time facilitated by the residual CB solvent (∼0.5 s), resulting in excessive aggregation in the D18:Y6 blend. With further evaporation of the solvent, the domains of D18 and Y6 grow rapidly based on the aggregates already assembled, promoting the formation of ordered structures. As a result, the over-crystallization of D18 and the excessive growth of phase separation can be obtained. However, in the PM6:Y6 system, the aggregation state is not affected by a trace of CB and remains the same as that in CF. Thus, the final phase separation and the crystallization of PM6 are maintained.

Conclusions
In summary, we have comprehensively investigated the effect of miscibility and the film-formation kinetic process on film morphology during processing with different solvents. We found that in the low-miscibility D18:Y6 system, a trace amount of CB causes a significant aggregation of Y6. The solution concentration increases during the 0.5 s of film formation time while the strong interactions in CB lead to enhanced aggregation and excessive phase separation. Thus, the D18:Y6 exhibits the highest PCE of 17.38% in CF devices due to the optimal morphology, while the MS device exhibits only an average PCE of 15.16%. In comparison, the film formation of the high-miscibility system PM6:Y6 in CF and MS is analogous, which results in little variability in morphology and corresponding device performance. This work has clarified the underlying mechanism for device optimization by connecting the relationships among component miscibility, the film-formation kinetic process, and final morphology, which paves the way to further improving the device performance in solution-processed OSCs.
