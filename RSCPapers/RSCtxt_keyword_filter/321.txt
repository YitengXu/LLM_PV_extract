    , Accepted 11th May 2020First published on 12th May 2020AbstractBy analyzing the photovoltaic parameters of organic solar cells based on perylene diimide (PDI) acceptors, we found that the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) showed an approximately positive linear correlation with the fill factors (FFs), which were mainly determined by the morphology. To tune the morphology impacted by the molecular geometry of the donor and the acceptor, a fully fused PDI derivative F-2PDI-4F, wherein the adjacent bay positions of PDI were substituted by fluorine atoms, was rationally designed and synthesized. The repulsion of F⋯F reduced the coplanarity of PDI and created a dihedral angle of 12.6°, which endowed F-2PDI-4F with relatively weak crystallinity as compared to its analogue F-2PDI without fluorination. These two acceptors were incorporated with two polymer donors, PTB7-Th and PBDB-T, with varied crystallinities to fabricate a solar cell device. The performance showed that the combination of a highly crystalline donor (acceptor) and a weakly crystalline acceptor (donor) was beneficial for the improvement in FF due to the improved microstructure of the blend films. Thus, the device with PBDB-T and F-2PDI-4F achieved a high FF of 66.9% and the best PCE of 9.05%. F-2PDI-4F is one of the few examples among numerous PDI acceptors that can achieve PCEs exceeding 9%. Our study provides a fruitful avenue for applying electrostatic repulsion to modulate molecular geometry, consequently improving the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, vigorous efforts have been devoted to organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their outstanding advantages such as light weight, flexibility and high-throughput fabrication by solution processing.1–9 Due to the innovation of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with promising potentials for structure tunability, strong absorption, and facile synthesis,10–12 remarkable progress has been made in the continuous advancement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 18% in single-junction OSCs.13–16
Within the class of NFAs, the perylene diimide (PDI) skeleton is one of the most intensively studied building blocks for the construction of electron-deficient acceptors due to its high electron mobility and stability.17–27 Numerous strategies including material and device approaches have been developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PDI derivatives and thus, PCEs over 10% have been reported.28–30 However, the efficiencies of PDI acceptors still lag behind that of the state-of-the-art OSCs based on other classes of NFAs, e.g., fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs).31–34 The intrinsic reasons resulting in the unsatisfactory performance for PDIs might be complicated and controversial.35–42 To reveal the structure–property relationship and to gain insights for advancing the creation of new PDIs, we have summarized the photovoltaic parameters, i.e., PCE, open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of the devices based on more than 100 PDI derivatives in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI.† PCE was determined synergistically by three parameters under the law of PCE definition (PCE = VOC × JSC × FF), while the three parameters usually compete against each other due to their different optimal approaches.43–47 Therefore, it is difficult to determine the correlation between PCE and each parameter alone. Interestingly, an approximately positive linear correlation was found between PCEs and FF in the case of PDI acceptors. It is well known that FF is mainly determined by the device morphology, including the miscibility and phase separation of donors and acceptors, which is significantly impacted by their molecular geometries.19,22,36,48–50 As such, the chemical structures of these PDI acceptors were further analyzed and compared. According to the features of molecular configuration, these PDI derivatives are classified into three types: (1) mono PDIs refer to pristine perylene diimide with/without substitution on the bay or ortho positions; (2) in flexible PDIs, multiple perylene diimide units are linked directly or by a conjugated bridge through single bonds; (3) fused or semi-fused PDIs involve PDI annulation with other aromatic rings. Pristine PDIs as the early generation NFAs exhibit extremely low efficiency as well as inferior FF rationalized by their large conjugated plane, causing severe phase separation in the active layer.51–53 With the substituted groups at the bay or ortho position, the excessive one-dimensional stacking in pristine PDI is alleviated. To further extend the conjugation while constructing a nonplanar configuration to suppress the phase separation on the micrometer scale, a new class of PDIs was designed in which an aromatic core is linked to several PDI units through single bonds, leading to flexible molecular configurations. However, the free rotation induced by the single bond raises the disorder and reorganization energy and consequently complicates the optimization of the relevant device morphology.19,21,22,48,54–59 The latest progress on PDI acceptors involves fusing PDI units with other aromatic rings to construct rigid annulated scaffolds, which might not only form appropriate nanometer-scale phase separation but may also improve the packing order, and thus enhance the exciton dissociation and charge transfer.20,60–63 Enormous efforts have been devoted to modulating the enforced rigidity and torsion angle by changing the aromatic core.28,60,64,65 Therefore, most of the devices based on fused/semi-fused PDI acceptors achieve decent fill factors as shown in Fig. 1.

However, it is notable that the modulation of the molecular geometry mainly relies on the substitution of bulk groups to change the steric hindrance. The selection of substituted groups remains a challenge since the introduction of a bulk group usually brings about changes in other optoelectronic properties besides the molecular geometry,28,40,66 thus resulting in a tedious trial-and-error optimization. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore new ways to facilely tailor the molecular geometry of the PDI moiety. Theoretically, the driving force of steric hindrance is originally from the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent groups or atoms. It might be an effective way for geometry modulation by directly tuning the electrostatic force of molecules. The fluorine atom possesses the highest electronegativity, leading to the electron cloud of the C-F bond mostly localizing on the fluorine atom, so the fluorine atom is often used to lock the molecular geometry by employing electrostatic attractive forces between fluorine and the adjacent positively charged atom.67,68 However, a fact that is usually ignored is that the localization of negative charge on fluorine atoms will create large electrostatic repulsion, evidenced by most F⋯F distances being longer than the van der Waals radius (2.94 Å) in polyfluoride compounds.69 The fluorine atom has the closest atomic radius to hydrogen, so replacing hydrogen with fluorine will minimize the variation of other properties. Therefore, fluorination on the PDI conjugated skeleton might adjust the molecular geometry with the assistance of F⋯F repulsion.
In this work, a fully-fused acceptor, F-2PDI-4F, in which the bay positions of perylene diimide are fully-substituted by fluorine atoms, is rationally designed and synthesized. Due to the repulsion between fluorine atoms, the PDI moiety in F-2PDI-4F is no longer a coplane but creates a dihedral angle of 12.6° between the two adjacent naphthalene rings. Thus, the pristine F-2PDI-4F shows moderate aggregation, which is beneficial for the formation of an optimal morphology when blending with a highly crystalline donor polymer, PBDB-T, and consequently providing a high PCE of 9.05%, which is attributed to the promotion of FF (66.9%). F-2PDI-4F is one of the few examples among PDI acceptors achieving PCEs over 9%, demonstrating that the employment of F⋯F repulsion might be a fruitful way to tailor the molecular geometry to enable the improvement of FF and PCE. Dramatically, the pseudoplanar analog F-2PDI without fluorination had superior PCE and FF in comparison with F-2PDI-4F when a relatively less crystalline polymer PTB7-Th was employed as the donor. The microstructure and morphology study revealed that the alternate tendencies were derived from the change in the balance between the dispersion and aggregation of the donor and acceptor in blend films, indicating that the combination of a highly crystalline donor (acceptor) and a relatively low crystalline acceptor (donor) is beneficial for the improvement of FF in PDI based OSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
We previously reported a pseudoplanar acceptor F-2PDI (Fig. 2a) with a rigid skeleton involving an indacenodithiophene (IDTT) core and two PDI terminal groups.70F-2PDI has a planar backbone leading to a strong face-on aggregation. The photovoltaic device with F-2PDI as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor showed a moderate PCE of 7.77%. Based on the hypothesis discussed above, we reason that fluorination on the bay positions of the PDI moiety might change the coplanarity of the relevant compound F-2PDI-4F (Fig. 2a) by introducing repulsion between atoms. To verify the hypothesis, theory calculations were carried out to optimize the molecular geometry via the Gaussian 09 software using density functional theory (DFT) at the ωB97X-D level.

The hexyl side chains of F-2PDI and F-2PDI-4F were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation. The optimized geometry of F-2PDI (Fig. 3a) appeared as a planar backbone with aromatic sidechains in the vertical direction. The two C–H bonds on the bay position are coplanar with the backbone, while the H⋯H distance is 1.99 Å. With replacement by fluorine, a distinctly distorted twist backbone is observed in F-2PDI-4F (Fig. 3b), exhibiting a dihedral angle of 12.6° between the two adjacent naphthalene ring planes in the PDI moiety. Notably, the two C–F bonds point in the opposite out-of-plane direction, indicating that the distortion of the PDI moiety is derived from the effect of fluorination. Considering that the F⋯F distance (2.39 Å) is significantly smaller than the van der Waals radius (2.94 Å), it is reasonable that there is a pivotal repulsion between these two fluorine atoms. Hence, fluorination on the PDI moiety might have a pronounced influence on the molecular geometry to create a nonplanar and rigid skeleton.

The synthetic procedure of F-2PDI-4F is illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The preparation of difluoride PDI is challenging, which was finally obtained with a relatively low yield of 28% due to the complexity of purification.71 The target molecule F-2PDI-4F was prepared by following a similar methodology to our previous study.68F-2PDI-4F shows good solubility in common solvents because of the presence of the hexylphenyl sidechains as well as the twisted geometry. The target molecule is well-identified via NMR and mass spectrometry, as listed in the ESI.†
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of F-2PDI and F-2PDI-4F were characterized by UV-Vis absorption and two polymer donors, PTB7-Th and PBDB-T, were studied as well. The normalized spectra of neat films are shown in Fig. 2b and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared to F-2PDI, the maximum absorption of F-2PDI-4F in the solid-state showed a 2 nm hypsochromic shift. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the molar extinction coefficients were estimated to be 1.37 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 452 nm for F-2PDI-4F and 1.54 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 454 nm for F-2PDI in dilute solution. In the solid-state, the molar extinction of F-2PDI (4.83 × 104 cm−1) was also slightly higher than that of F-2PDI-4F (4.24 × 104 cm−1). These results indicate that fluorination on the bay positions of PDI only has a slight impact on the push–pull structure. F-2PDI-4F showed a decrease in the packing peak at 650 nm as compared to F-2PDI (Fig. S2, ESI†), implying that fluorination on the PDI groups might weaken the strong aggregation in the solid-state. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of F-2PDI and F-2PDI-4F estimated from the absorption onset of the corresponding films are 1.76 and 1.75 eV, respectively. The absorption spectra of the blended films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The UV-absorption of the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F blend film showed a 10 nm bathochromic shift as compared with PTB7-Th:F-2PDI, implying that the packing mode and phase separation might be different.

To study the electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of F-2PDI-4F and F-2PDI measured by CV were estimated to be −3.76/−5.52 and −3.81/−5.55 eV, respectively. The slight downshifts in the LUMO and HOMO in F-2PDI-4F demonstrate that the introduction of fluorine into the PDI backbone will not significantly change the optoelectronic properties besides the modulation of the molecular geometry. As shown in Fig. 2, both PDI acceptors possess well-aligned energy levels with PTB7-Th and PBDB-T, accompanying complementary UV-Vis absorption spectra.
Photovoltaic properties
The two PDI-based acceptors, F-2PDI-4F and F-2PDI, were subsequently applied in photovoltaic characterization, incorporated with PTB7-Th and PBDB-T, respectively, as the electron donor. The devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration: indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/aluminum (Al). The donor/acceptor ratio was optimized individually to 1:1 (w/w) in PTB7-Th-based devices and 1:0.8 (w/w) in PBDB-T-based devices. Chloronaphthalene and 1,8-diiodooctane were used as solvent additives in various devices. Detailed information on the device fabrication and characterization are provided in the Experimental section and ESI.† The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 4a. Firstly, the less crystalline polymer PTB7-Th was utilized as a donor. Device PTB7-Th:F-2PDI achieved a PCE of 7.44%, which is consistent with the values reported in our previous study and other works in the literature.70,72

On altering the acceptor to F-2PDI-4F, the overall device performance significantly declined, despite the tedious optimization, providing a frustrating VOC since the LUMO of 2F-PDI-4F downshifted by around 0.05 eV as compared to 2F-PDI. However, the FF was exceptionally low, which might result from inferior charge mobility restraining the efficiency of the charge transport and extraction. Space-charge limited current (SCLC) was employed to measure the charge transport characteristics. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), much poorer electron (1.28 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobilities (1.72 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1) are evident in the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F blend film in comparison with the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI blend film (μe 6.20 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and μh 8.59 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1). The diversity of the charge mobility of these two acceptors might be ascribed to their morphology in the blend films, which will be discussed in the following section.
By changing the polymer donor to PBDB-T, which is demonstrated as a highly crystalline polymer, the PBDB-T:F-2PDI device exhibits a lower JSC of 11.23 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 61.1%, synergistically leading to a similar PCE (7.07%) to the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI system. However, the device PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F exhibited an impressive enhancement in FF (66.9%) while the best JSC of 13.54 mA cm−2 was achieved, affording a champion PCE of 9.05%. As shown in Fig. 1, this result is one of the few examples among PDI acceptors where PCEs surpass 9%. The SCLC measurement shows that the hole mobility in PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F (1.02 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1) is almost three times as high as PBDB-T:F-2PDI (3.43 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) although the same donor is utilized, which is the pathway for hole transport. Although F-2PDI-4F has a twisted backbone, the electron mobility is as good as that of the blend film based on F-2PDI. This might be interrelated with the diversity in morphology, which will be discussed in the following section. These data rationalize the high FF and PCE in the PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F device.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimal devices were obtained to further analyze the current density. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE curves elucidate that the PTB7-Th-based devices display a broad photo response covering the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm, which corresponds to the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptors. Meanwhile, the PBDB-T-based devices display a stronger photoresponse, in particular for the PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F device, in which over 70% EQE value was observed in the range from 450 to 650 nm. Moreover, the photoresponse around 700 nm in PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F is stronger than that of PBDB-T:F-2PDI which is consistent with the absorption of blend films (Fig S3, ESI†). These results are related to the variation in charge transport and recombination, which will be investigated in the following section.
Exciton dissociation, charge extraction and recombination
To understand the exciton dissociation and charge extraction mechanisms in devices with diverse active layers, the variation in photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of these devices was studied and shown in Fig. 5a. Typically, photogenerated excitons tend to dissociate into free charges and will be effectively collected by the individual electrodes at high Veff (>2 V). The charge dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were estimated to be 86.1%, 80.7%, 92.8%, and 93.5% for PTB7-Th:F-2PDI, PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F, PBDB-T:F-2PDI, and PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F-based devices, respectively. The charge collection probabilities (Pcoll) were estimated to be 81.0%, 67.0%, 89.7%, and 90.7% for PTB7-Th:F-2PDI, PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F, PBDB-T:F-2PDI, and PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F-based devices, respectively. This observation implies that PBDB-T as the donor can improve the Pdiss and Pcoll in relevant devices, consequently providing high FFs. Thus, the PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F device exhibited the most efficient exciton dissociation, which contributed to the enhanced values of JSC and FF.

To gain insight into the recombination kinetics of the OSC devices, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the light intensity (Plight) was also studied. As shown in Fig. 5b, the light intensity dependence of VOC was employed to investigate the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the devices. The corresponding coefficients of the slope were calculated to be 1.14, 1.03, 1.04, and 1.02 for PTB7-Th:F-2PDI, PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F, PBDB-T:F-2PDI, and PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F devices, respectively. These values indicate that the SRH recombination is sufficiently suppressed in PBDB-T:F-2PDI and PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F-based devices. To analyze the bimolecular recombination kinetics of these OSC devices, the curves of JSC values versus Plight are shown in Fig. 5c. In general, the JSC should follow a power-law dependence on Plight (JSC ∝ Pαlight). The exponential factor α approaching 1 would imply the decrease in the bimolecular recombination, and the free carriers can be efficiently collected by the electrodes. The α values of PTB7-Th:F-2PDI, PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F, PBDB-T:F-2PDI, and PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F-based devices were calculated to be 0.867, 0.878, 0.884 and 0.885, indicating the existence of slight bimolecular recombination in these systems, wherein the recombination of PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F is suppressed.
Morphology characterization
The morphologies of pristine F-2PDI and F-2PDI-4F films were probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the effect of varied molecular geometries on the morphology in the solid-state. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), F-2PDI features a highly crystalline film with a large-sized domain, in which the root-mean-square (RMS) is 3.88 nm. In contrast, F-2PDI-4F appears as a uniform film showing a relatively small RMS of 0.60 nm, indicating that the structural distortion induced by fluorination can alleviate the excessive stacking of the PDI moiety, which is beneficial for the compatibility with the donor. The blend films were also studied via AFM (Fig. 6). With the weakly crystalline polymer PTB7-Th, the F-2PDI-4F-based blend film tends to be amorphous with an RMS of 1.06 nm, while a distinct crystalline domain is evident in the F-2PDI case (RMS 1.54 nm). This result rationalizes that the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI system has better charge mobility and FF. When the highly crystalline polymer PBDB-T is used, the F-2PDI-4F blend film achieves a fiber-like morphology with an RMS of 1.20 nm. However, the blend film based on F-2PDI, which has higher crystallinity than the F-2PDI-4F based film, appears as an aggregation of small grains with a RMS of 1.53 nm. This might be rationalized by the fact that the formation of small grains is too fast to further self-assemble into fibers in the blend system, wherein both donor and acceptor are highly crystalline. Consequently, PBDB-T is unable to create a continuous network in the PBDB-T:F-2PDI blend film, which is demonstrated by the relatively low hole mobility. Furthermore, the blend films were investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). With the donor polymer PTB7-Th, the F-2PDI-based film has evident aggregated grains, while the F-2PDI-4F based film seems to be amorphous. When PBDB-T was used as the donor polymer, fibrous grains appeared in the blend film based on PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F, which is consistent with the results of AFM.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to further study the molecular packing of varied donor/acceptor combinations. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line cut profiles are presented in Fig. 7. Compared to the F-2PDI based film,70 many disorderly scattering peaks emerged in the blend films with F-2PDI-4F, which resulted from its distorted backbone. However, the effect of F-2PDI-4F on the polymer packing was varied. Compared to the F-2PDI-based blend films, the PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F system showed a weaker π–π stacking peak of polymer PTB7-Th at 1.62 Å−1, while the scattering peaks of polymer PBDB-T including lamella and π–π stacking were stronger in PBDB-T:F-2PDI-4F. These results are in excellent agreement with the charge mobility and FF data. Combined with the data from AFM, TEM, and GIWAXS, it is clear that the morphology of the blend film highly relies on the molecular geometries of both donor and acceptor. The fluorination of PDI causes a distorted backbone, which alleviates excessive self-aggregation. This modulation of molecular geometry is beneficial for promoting the capability of forming a favorable morphology with a highly crystalline polymer donor PBDB-T, since PBDB-T will dominate the crystallization during the film formation. When F-2PDI is used as the acceptor, both PBDB-T and F-2PDI tend to crystallize and compete against each other, consequently forming small self-aggregated grains rather than a bicontinuous and interpenetrated network. In the case of the weak crystalline polymer PTB7-Th as the donor, the acceptor F-2PDI with high crystallinity is preferred to stimulate the formation of the crystalline domain to improve the charge mobility, which will enhance the FF and PCE in the device.

Conclusions
In summary, a multi-fluoride PDI derivative with a fully-fused rigid backbone, F-2PDI-4F, was rationally designed and synthesized. By the substitution of fluorine atoms on the bay positions, a dihedral angle of 12.6° between the adjacent two naphthalene rings in the PDI moiety was created due to the F⋯F electrostatic repulsion. Compared to the pseudoplanar analog F-2PDI without fluorination, the change in the molecular geometry in F-2PDI-4F was able to alleviate the excessive stacking of the PDI moiety and improve the compatibility with the donor materials while rarely affecting other optoelectronic properties. On incorporation with the polymer donors PTB7-Th and PBDB-T with varied crystallinity, F-2PDI and F-2PDI-4F were utilized as acceptors to fabricate photovoltaic devices. With a relatively weak crystalline polymer PTB7-Th, F-2PDI with a planar backbone was beneficial for improving the phase separation and crystallinity of the corresponding blend film, thus providing a decent PCE of 7.44%. The PTB7-Th:F-2PDI-4F device showed a low FF (46.0%) and PCE (5.27%) due to the amorphous blend film. When a high crystalline polymer PBDB-T was used as the donor, the strong crystallization tendency of F-2PDI competed against PBDB-T to restrain the formation of a bicontinuous and interpenetrated network, which limited the improvement of PCE (7.07%). By replacing the acceptor to F-2PDI-4F with relatively weak crystallinity, the FF was dramatically promoted to 66.9%. Finally, a champion device with the best PCE of 9.05% was obtained, which is one of few examples of achieving PCEs over 9% among PDI acceptors. These results demonstrate that multi-fluoride PDIs are a class of promising acceptors. This work reveals the principle for selecting donor/acceptor combinations with varied crystallinity in OSCs, i.e., the combination of a highly crystalline donor (acceptor) and a weak crystalline acceptor (donor) is beneficial for the improvement of FF due to the balance of compatibility and crystallinity in blend films. More importantly, our study has provided a fruitful means for applying electrostatic repulsion to tune the molecular geometry of organic semiconductors.

Synthesis of F-2PDI-4F

F-2PDI-4F: IDTT-2PDI-4F (0.23 g, 0.09 mmol) was dissolved in 60 mL dry toluene, followed by the addition of a solution of FeCl3 (0.22 g, 0.139 mmol) in 0.2 mL CH3NO2. The mixture was heated to 45 °C and kept stirring for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the product was poured into methanol. The crude product was filtered and washed with methanol. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether:CH2Cl2, 2:1 v/v), yielding a deep green solid (0.16 g, 70%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 9.97 (br, 2H), 9.58 (br, 2H), 8.80 (br, 4H), 7.91 (s, 2H), 7.42 (d, 8H), 7.28 (d, 8H), 5.34 (m, 4H), 2.71–2.58 (m, 8H), 2.37 (m, 8H), 1.96 (m, 8H), 1.68 (m, 8H), 1.44–1.25 (m, 72H), 0.86 (m, 36H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ 164.97, 164.20, 163.11, 154.71, 147.72, 147.29, 142.61, 142.64, 142.24, 149.75, 136.99, 136.57, 135.26, 131.33, 129.15, 128.19, 127.11, 124.50, 123.53, 122.90, 122.01, 118.15, 117.12, 68.13, 63.79, 55.48, 35.83, 32.57, 31.93, 31.88, 31.43, 29.31, 26.91, 26.83, 25.79, 2275, 22.74, 22.73, 14.22. 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3) δ −90.83.

Device fabrication
The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate was ultra-sonicated sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, chloroform and isopropanol. Then, the ITO was treated with UV-ozone treatment for 5 min in a UV-ozone chamber. The ZnO nanoparticles solution (12 mg mL−1, methanol) was spin-coated on the surface of the ITO substrate at 3500 rpm for 30 s to form a thin ZnO (∼10 nm) electron transfer layer (ETL). The active layer solution was then spin-coated onto the substrates to form an active layer and the optimized parameters were summarized in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). The thickness of the active layer was typically 100 nm. A molybdenum trioxide (MoO3, ∼10 nm) hole transfer layer (HTL) and an aluminum anode (Al, ∼100 nm) were finally evaporated onto the surface of the active layer in an evaporation chamber under high vacuum (≤10−4 Pa). The device area was exactly fixed at 0.0368 cm2 and the I–V characterization was carried out on a Keithley 2420 source under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI), which was calibrated by a standard Si solar cell (AK-200, Konica Minolta, INC.). The EQE values were measured with an Enlitech QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co. Ltd) during illumination with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp.
The SCLC devices were fabricated with an ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZnO/Al configuration for the electron-only device and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al configuration for the hole-only device. All of the devices with different active layers were prepared under optimized conditions in OSCs devices. AFM samples were fabricated by spin-coating neat acceptors or blend films on the precleaned ITO substrates. TEM samples were fabricated by spin-coating blend films on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates and then transferring onto carbon films. GIWAXS samples were fabricated by depositing varied blend films on Si/PEDOT:PSS substrates.
