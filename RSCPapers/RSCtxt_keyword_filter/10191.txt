    , Accepted 6th January 2021First published on 7th January 2021AbstractThree novel D–D′–A′–π–A type organic dyes (BT4, BT5 and BT6) based on aniline derivatives (containing fluorene, carbazole and phenothiazine segments as D′) and formic acid as anchoring groups have been synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). To fine-tune absorption spectra, energy levels, and photovoltaic properties of these dyes, an auxiliary electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BT) unit was introduced into their backbones. It was found that dye BT5 with a carbazole containing triarylamine as the electron-donating unit exhibits a broader absorption profile, higher molar extinction coefficient and better photovoltaic performance than those of BT4 and BT6. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the BT5-based DSC was up to 3.61%. This implied that the incorporation of the BT unit can cause a pronounced electron transfer effect with triarylamine segments, and therefore affect the absorption bands, Stokes shifts and PCE of DSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, great progress has been made in the performance and stability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) owing to its advantages of rich raw materials, low cost, flexibility, simple process technology, ease of realizing large-scale industrial production, safety and pollution-free properties since the pioneering study by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1,2–7 Typical DSCs consist of a donor–acceptor (D–A) system, which has an electron-rich core unit (donor, D) as well as electron-deficient units (acceptor, A). For example, Grätzel et al.8 reported that the D–π–A type zinc porphyrin complex dye SM315 acquired a PCE value of 13%. However, the high cost of the preparation of metal complex dyes, limited resources, lengthy synthetic routes, and difficulty in purification have hindered their further promotion. Later, pure organic dyes were proposed with simple synthesis, convenient purification, and high molar extinction coefficient.9
In pure organic dyes, the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit was often introduced as a versatile auxiliary acceptor into D–π–A type dyes so that the sensitizer realized high short circuit current (Jsc), resulting in high power conversion efficiency (PCE).10,11 Aniline derivatives are often used as donor materials to construct high-performance DSSCs due to their excellent electron-donating abilities and suitable spatial characteristics.12 In 2014, Grätzel et al. constructed two dyes with diphenylamine derivatives and BT, obtaining a PCE of 7.1% and 8.0%, respectively.13 In the same year, Grätzel designed and synthesized a sensitizer with PCE up to 12.75% using porphyrin-containing triphenylamine derivatives and BT. In 2016, Tan synthesized a dye molecule with triarylamine derivatives containing N,N-4,4-tetra-p-tolyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene as the donor and BT as the acceptor, obtaining a PCE value of 6.29%.14 It has been suggested that the combination of triarylamine derivatives and BT can be modified to obtain high-performance dye sensitizers.
Inspired by the strategy for constructing DSCs with triarylamine derivatives and a BT system, we synthesized a series of D–D′–A′–π–A type dyes (BT4–6), featuring triarylamine derivatives containing fluorene, carbazole and phenothiazine as the donor unit, BT as the auxiliary co-acceptor unit, phenyl as the π bridge, and carboxyl as the anchor group in this contribution (Scheme 1). The photophysical absorption, electrochemistry, thermal stability, and electrochemical impedances of BT4–6 were studied, and the differences in the properties of these dyes due to different donor units were discussed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to further understand their structural and electronic features. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performances of these dyes were investigated in detail to gain insight into their potential DSCs applications.

2. Results and discussions
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of BT4–6 are shown in Scheme 2. First, compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were prepared from the commercially available raw materials. Then, the triarylamines 5, 6, and 7 were obtained by Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction, employing 2, 3, 4 and 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine as substrates, in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 as the catalyst and sodium tert-butoxide as the alkali in toluene at 80 °C under inert argon. It should be noted that the reaction temperature and catalyst should be strictly controlled to ensure a satisfactory yield. This is followed by boron esterification toward 5, 6, and 7 under the classical condition, giving the corresponding 8, 9, and 10, respectively. Subsequently, the Suzuki coupling reaction was performed between the borate and compound 1, readily affording the desired compounds 11, 12, and 13. Finally, hydrolysis was conducted to obtain the target dyes BT4–6, BT5 and BT6. All of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS.

2.2 Absorption spectra of BT4–6
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of BT4–6 in THF solution and in thin films are illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the three dyes exhibit double-band absorption in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm. The absorption band in the short-wavelength range of 300–400 nm is attributed to the triarylamine derivative donor aromatic ring π–π*, whereas the absorption band in the range of 400–650 nm can be attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the triarylamine unit and BT unit. Meanwhile, the BT4, BT5 and BT6 maximum absorption wavelengths are 458 nm, 452 nm, and 447 nm, respectively, and the molar extinction coefficients are 1.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1, 1.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The molar extinction coefficient of dye BT4 is the highest, followed by BT5 and BT6.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of BT4–6 in the TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 1b. The maximum absorption peaks of dyes BT4–6 on the TiO2 films are 486 nm, 469 nm and 460 nm, respectively. Compared with the absorption peaks in the solution, the absorption peaks in the film state were red-shifted by 10 nm, 17 nm, and 13 nm, respectively, for BT4, BT5 and BT6. As we all know, deprotonation and aggregation effects (H-type aggregation and J-type aggregation) are the main factors affecting the change of the UV-Vis absorption spectra. Generally, deprotonation and H-type aggregation usually lead to an ICT blue shift, while J-type aggregation usually leads to an ICT red shift. Therefore, the red shift phenomenon indicates that the dyes BT4–6 have a certain degree of J-type aggregation on the TiO2 films. We speculate that this is mainly due to the fact that molecules in a solid state have stronger intermolecular interactions than in solution, causing intensive π–π stacking between the molecules. Dye BT5 has the largest red shift and the widest absorption width, indicating that BT5 has the strongest light absorbing ability on the TiO2 film.
2.3 Fluorescence emission of BT4–6
The normalized fluorescence emission spectra of BT4–6 are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. It was found that they all display typical emission peaks ranging from 500 nm to 800 nm, with the emission wavelengths of 685 nm, 686 nm and 531 nm, respectively, for dyes BT4–6. The Stokes shifts of dyes BT4–6 were calculated to be 227 nm, 235 nm and 83 nm, respectively. The Stokes shift of BT5 was larger than the similarly structured BT4, indicating that the triarylamine with a stronger electron-donating ability and greater coplanarity with the BT unit, was more favorable to the transfer of energy within the excited state. BT6 showed the smallest Stokes shift, which may be ascribed to the butterfly-like non-planar structure of phenothiazine, whose twisted configuration destroys the planarity of the molecule, thereby affecting the charge transfer within the molecule.

2.4 Electrochemical properties of BT4–6
To systematically investigate the influence of the alternating D′ in triarylamine on the HOMO and LUMO levels of BT4–6, master the electron injection and dye regeneration behaviors, and evaluate whether they are suitable for DSSCs, cyclic voltammograms (CV) were performed in THF. The CV curves of BT4–6 are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 2. Through observation and analysis of the two charts, it can be found that the oxidation potential of dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6 are 0.62 V, 0.67 V and 0.64 V, respectively, which correspond to the HOMO levels of dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6, respectively. By normalizing the UV absorption spectra and the fluorescence emission spectra in the THF solution, we can calculate the E0–0 values of the dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6 as 2.42 eV, 2.38 eV and 2.62 eV, respectively, by the formula E0–0 = 1240/λint. The reduction potentials of the dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6 were calculated to be −1.80 V, −1.71 V and −1.98 V, respectively, by the formula Ered = Eox − E0–0, which correspond to the LUMO levels of the dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6, respectively. The results show that the oxidation potential of the dyes BT4–6 are higher than the oxidation potential (0.4 V) of the redox couple (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte. This indicates that the lost electrons from the dye molecules can be regained from the redox couple (I−/I3−), achieving dye regeneration, which is achievable in thermodynamics. In addition, the reduction potential of the dyes BT4–6 is lower than that of the conduction band of titanium dioxide (−0.5 V vs. NHE). From the thermodynamic point of view, it indicates that the excited state electrons of the dye can effectively inject the conduction band of TiO2. In many studies, it has been shown that when the difference between the excited state of the dye redox potential (Ered) and the TiO2 conduction band bottom level (0.5 V vs NHE) is greater than 0.2 V (Egap), there is sufficient driving force to smoothly inject the excited state electrons of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2. We calculated their Egap to be 1.30 eV, 1.21 eV and 1.48 eV, according to the Ered of the three dyes, so it is clear that the dyes BT4–6 satisfy the requirements as a DSCs photosensitizer.

2.5 Thermal properties of BT4–6
To better understand the thermal stability of dyes BT4–6, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted under N2 gas and a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The thermogravimetric curves are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 3. The results show that the thermal decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of BT4–6 is 245 °C, 227 °C and 284 °C, respectively. The difference indicates that the electron-donating unit has a great influence on the thermal stability of these dyes. Among them, BT6 with phenothiazine-containing triarylamine derivatives as the electron-donating unit exhibited the highest thermal decomposition temperature. We speculated that this might be due to the influence of the phenothiazine S–H bond. The Td of all dyes exceeds 200 °C, indicating that BT4–6 have good thermal stability and are suitable for DSCs.

2.6 Theoretical calculation of BT4–6
In order to further understand the influence of the molecular structure and electron distribution on the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of these dyes, the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation was carried out by Gaussian 09 package57 at the B3LYP/631G(d) level. The optimized ground-state geometries and electronic distributions in the HOMO–LUMO levels are presented in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that the dihedral angles between the D′ unit and the acceptor BT unit are 34.61°, 33.11° and 32.46°, respectively. The dihedral angles between the BT unit and the benzene (π-bridge) are 35.66°, 34.65° and 34.47°, respectively. In the donor unit of BT4, the dihedral angles of fluorene and the two benzene rings are 31.53° and 47.19°, respectively. In general, the A near-planar molecular configuration in the D–A conjugate can efficiently arouse an intense ICT, resulting in the decrease of the band gap and redshifted absorption, facilitating hole mobility and energy transfer, which are considered as key factors for high-performance photovoltaic devices. However, the butterfly-like twisted structure of phenothiazine in BT6 destroys the planarity of the whole molecule, so we should not only consider the planarity between the donor unit and the acceptor unit, but also the planarity of the entire molecule.

 Fig. 6  Electron distribution of BT4–6 at HOMO/LUMO energy levels. 
Comparing the electron cloud distribution of BT4–6 in the HOMO/LUMO level (Fig. 6), we found that the electron cloud in the HOMO level (in the ground state) is mainly distributed on the triarylamine derivatives (donor), and the electron cloud in the LUMO energy state (excited state) is mainly distributed on the terminal acceptor unit (BT and carboxybenzene). This indicates that the electrons of the three dyes in the excited state can be effectively transferred from the donor unit to the acceptor unit, which is crucial in DSCs because it affects whether the excited state electrons can efficiently inject the conduction band of TiO2.
2.7 Photovoltaic performances of BT4–6
In order to study the photovoltaic performances of these dyes, DSSCs were fabricated using BT4–6 as the sensitizers with 0.4 M. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), current density–voltage (J–V) curves and their data are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4. As shown in Fig. 7b, BT4 gives a relatively low IPCE value with the maximum of 61.4% at 470 nm, which is probably due to a small energy gap between the LUMO level of the dye and the conduction band edge of TiO2, leading to the lower electron injection efficiency relative to those of BT5 and BT6. However, the IPCE values of BT5 and BT6 are similar with the maximum of 70% at 470 nm. The higher IPCE values might be attributed to an effective intramolecular energy transfer from the heterocyclic molecules with N and S.

The J–V diagrams of DSSCs based on BT4, BT5 and BT6 are shown in Fig. 7, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 4. It can be seen from Table 4 that the PCE of BT4–6 measured in DSSCs without CDCA is 2.63%, 3.61%, and 3.31%, respectively. The PCE of BT4 is lower than BT5–6 due to its lower Jsc and fill factor (FF) value. Meanwhile, in order to investigate the effect of the spatial structure on their adsorption, the adsorption was tested by the amount per unit area of TiO2 films. The BT4–6 adsorption are 3.81 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 4.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2, and 5.63 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. The BT6 possesses the highest adsorption capacity, which may be because the electron coupling between the dye molecule BT6 and TiO2 is the strongest. These indicate that it has the most light-trapping groups per unit area, and thus obtains higher Jsc (7.52 mA cm−2) and PCE (3.31%). Although BT5 has a slightly lower adsorption capacity, it has a higher molar extinction coefficient and stronger light absorption, contributing to the high open circuit voltage (Voc) (0.65 V) and FF (73%), thus providing the highest PCE (3.61%). In contrast, BT4 has the largest molar extinction coefficient, but a small adsorption capacity and light absorption capacity, resulting in the lowest Jsc (6.07 mA cm−2) and PCE (2.63%).
2.8 Electrochemical impedance of BT4–BT6
In order to investigate the electrical properties, we measured the electrochemical impedance (EIS) of the dyes BT4, BT5 and BT6 in a dark environment. As shown in Fig. 8a, the EIS Nyquist curves of the three dyes have two semicircles. One semicircle is located in the high-frequency region, which is extremely polar and corresponds to the electrochemical reaction process of the Pt electrode. This process essentially reflects the charge transfer on the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Because the charge transfer is too fast and the impedance is very small, the semicircle is negligible. The other larger semicircle is located in the mid-frequency region, corresponding to the charge transfer at the TiO2 (anode)/dye/electrolyte interface. Therefore, in the DSCs, we analyze the impedance of this region.
 Fig. 8  The EIS Nyquist curves (a) and Bode curves of BT4–6 (b). 
The abscissa corresponding to the peak of the large semicircle represents the composite resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Generally, a large Rrec means a low electron recombination rate, thus leading to high Voc. As shown in Fig. 8b, the Rrec values of BT4 and BT5 are similar, but much larger than BT6, which indicates that the dark current generated by BT6 is larger and the electron-recombination rate is high. Moreover, we measured the Bode curves of DSCs based on the dyes BT4–6, and these are shown in Fig. 8b. The lower frequency corresponding to the peak represents the longer electron lifetime, as well as the slower electron recombination. The figure shows that the frequencies of the dyes BT4 and BT5 are almost the same, and much smaller than the frequency of BT6, which means that the electronic life of BT4 and BT5 will be longer than that of BT6. Eventually, their open circuit voltage will be higher than that of BT6, which is consistent with the actual measured results of 0.66 V for BT5, 0.65 V for BT4 and 0.63 V for BT6.
3. Conclusions
In summary, three novel D–D′–A′–π–A type triarylamine organic dyes have been synthesized with fluorene, carbazole and phenothiazine moieties as the center electron donor, and benzothiadiazole as the additional electron acceptor. It was demonstrated that the introduction of a center electron donor in diphenylamine has a positive effect on the photoelectrical properties, such as the higher molar extinction coefficient, the stronger absorption capacity, and larger Stokes shift (83–235 nm). Electrochemical tests show that BT4–6 have a suitable energy level and band gap, which meet the requirements of DSCs as sensitizers. The electrochemical impedance test shows that BT4–6 have a long electronic life. Photovoltaic performance tests show that BT5 with a carbazole-containing triarylamine derivative as the donor unit, possessing a more coplanar molecular structure, obtained the highest efficiency of 3.61% (Jsc = 7.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V, FF = 0.73) among the three dyes. The results suggest that the higher photovoltaic performance can be achieved through a careful molecular tailoring.
