    , Accepted 22nd July 2018First published on 23rd July 2018AbstractThe synergistic effects of different engineering strategies, especially interface engineering, band structure engineering, and micro/nano engineering, can be exploited for the development of efficient photoanodes for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Herein, we investigate the energy transfer mechanism and the charge carrier transport capacity of a set of photoanodes developed for a CdSe QDSSC. Boron, nitrogen and fluorine-tridoped TiO2 nanotube (BNF-TNT) membranes were obtained by anodization of titanium to self-organized TiO2 nanotube (TNT) layers, followed by a lift-off process. Then BNF-TNT membranes were adhered onto indium–tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass and sensitized by varying the load of CdSe quantum dots (BNF-Y-CdSe) using the SILAR method. The as-prepared electrode materials were characterized by FESEM, HR-TEM, DRS, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The photochemical, photoelectrochemical, and semiconducting properties of the electrode materials were investigated by photopotential, photovoltammetry, photocurrent transient measurements, and Mott–Schottky analyses in 1.0 M Na2S. CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were homogeneously and intimately coated on BNF-TNT, which favored electron transport to the ITO substrate, and promoted a red-shift in the light harvesting of the composite toward the visible region (1.65 eV) from UV (2.75 eV). The highest photoresponse was obtained for BNF-TNT grown in 0.06 wt% H3BO3, and sensitized with CdSe QDs after five SILAR cycles. Boron doping in BNF-5-CdSe increased the photoconversion efficiency with respect to the CdSe-sensitized nanotubes without B-doping (NF-5-CdSe) by around 176% under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The results showed that B-doping/sensitization synergism occurs by a Ti3+ states-to-CdSe QD electron transfer, which increases electron flow toward back contact. This allowed the enhancement of the electron lifetime, charge-collection efficiency and incident-to-electron conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
The improvement of photovoltaic energy conversion in solar cells using low-cost light harvesters is a hot topic in the field of photovoltaic power generation, due to the development of nanomaterials that are capable of being both good light absorbers as well as charge transporters. One-dimensional nanostructures, such as TiO2 nanotubes, offer direct pathways for electron transport. However, the photoactivation of TiO2 with UV light allows us to use only 5% of the solar spectrum, providing a low energy conversion.3 Solar energy production involves taking advantage of sunlight, hence it is necessary to develop synthesis strategies that lead to both enhanced visible light absorption and charge collection and transport. One approach to improve the light absorption of TiO2 is its chemical modification with non-metal atoms such as nitrogen,4 fluorine,5 and boron,6 which incorporate intraband gap energy levels in the wide gap of the semiconductor. Another attractive strategy is TiO2 sensitization with narrow-gap semiconductor QDs, thanks to their optoelectronic properties and tunability to enhance harvesting in a wide range of the visible spectrum. This can be achieved by controlling the QD size, which results in the formation of band structures, which is one of the critical factors in the efficiency of interfacial charge carrier transfer.7,8 On the one hand, TiO2/QD assemblies have been used as light harvesters in QDSSCs,1–3,7,8 on the other hand, TNT arrays can provide the scaffold for QD sensitizers, which also act as light harvesters in QDSSCs.
Although QD sensitizers show notable characteristics such as high extinction coefficient and generation of multiple electron–hole pairs by absorption of one photon compared with organic sensitizers,2 they tend to photodecompose, which is one of the most important causes of a low photoconversion efficiency (PCE) in QDSSCs.3,8 Thus, the synthesis of inorganic sensitizers with high photostability and light absorption capability is still a huge challenge in the fabrication of third-generation photovoltaic devices. Cadmium chalcogenide based QDs such as CdS and CdSe have been widely used in QDSSCs, because they are photostable and form a II-type energy band alignment with TiO2, providing a driving force to carry out the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and thereby increase the PCE.2,3,7,9 Recently, CdSe has attracted more attention due to its low-band gap of around 1.6–1.7 eV,9–11 leading to a wider visible light absorption range compared with CdS (2.42 eV).12 However, some studies mention about difficulty in obtaining a well-covering TiO2 surface using CdSe QDs,1,9,13 and the relative positions of the conduction band edges of both CdSe and TiO2 are not far enough to perform an adequate band alignment.7,14 These two disadvantages limit light harvesting and electron transport through a solar cell. To overcome these problems, the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process has been used. This process in solution not only let dispersed cadmium chalcogenides grow well on TiO2 photoanode surfaces, but also control the QD particle size, allowing the band engineering of QDs to match with that of TiO2 in order to increase the electron flow and PCE in a solar cell.2,12,15
To ensure efficient light harvesting and electron transport in energy conversion applications, the two abovementioned approaches have been combined. Both CdS and CdSe have been grown on non-metal doped TiO2 based photoanodes, establishing a synergistic effect to improve the photoresponse of the composites compared to those separately.16–18 However, it has not been described with supported evidences how the synergism between doping and sensitization is established in the photoanode. Thus, there is enough scope to take this further. Here the influence of boron as a co-dopant on the enhancement of light harvesting and carrier transport abilities of CdSe QD-sensitized B,N,F-tri-doped TNT (BNF-Y-CdSe) is addressed. The role of boron allowed elucidating (1) the main factor to generate the synergistic behaviour in composites and (2) its effect on the electron injection and transport into BNF-Y-CdSe/electrolyte interfaces. An energy transfer mechanism is proposed to explain the favourability of both sunlight harvesting and carrier mobility, to increase the PCE of a QDSSC.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of BNF-TNT transparent photoanodes
Vertically oriented boron-doped TiO2 nanotubes (BNF-TNT) were grown by Ti anodization in an electrolyte solution containing 0.45 wt% NH4F and 2.0 wt% deionized (DI) water in ethylene glycol, using different amounts of H3BO3 of 0.04 wt%, 0.06 wt% and 0.09 wt% as the boron precursor. A bias potential of 60 V was applied for 2.5 h, in a two-electrode cell. Cu foil was used as the cathode.19 Prior to the anodization process, Ti foils (99.5% of purity, 5 cm2) were polished with various grade SiC emery papers, each one separately sonicated in ethanol, acetone and rinsed with DI water for 5 min. The anodized samples were also rinsed with DI water, dried and annealed at 100 °C and 400 °C for 1 h, respectively, at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. For comparative purposes, N,F-codoped TNTs (NF-TNT) were grown by carrying out the anodization process in the absence of H3BO3. In order to obtain NF-TNT and BNF-TNT transparent photoanodes, the as-annealed samples were subjected to second anodization for 15 min, using similar experimental conditions described above. NF-TNT and BNF-TNT in the form of free-standing films were detached from the Ti substrate by immersing them into a 30 wt% H2O2 solution for 10 min. Then, the films were adhered onto indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass by using a B-TiO2 sol and dried at room temperature. The procedure of sol preparation is described elsewhere.6 Lastly, the abovementioned thermal treatment was repeated.
2.2. Deposition of CdSe QDs on the BNF-TNT photoanodes
The BNF-TNT and NF-TNT photoanodes were sensitized with different CdSe loading using the SILAR method, conducted in a N2 filled glove box. The materials were immersed into a 50% (v/v) 0.03 M 3CdSO4·8H2O water/ethanol solution for 1 min and rinsed with ethanol for 20 s. Then, the photoanodes were dipped into a 0.03 M Se2− ethanol solution for 1 min and rinsed again with ethanol for 20 s. Then, the as-sensitized materials were dried under a N2 atmosphere for several minutes. The drying process was performed cycle by cycle. The Se2− solution was prepared by mixing SeO2 with NaBH4 in ethanol in the glove box. The details of the procedure are mentioned elsewhere.20
One SILAR cycle was performed to carry out the two-step dipping in the cationic and anionic solutions. The photoanodes are denominated as X-BNF-Y-CdSe, where X is the amount of H3BO3 (in wt%) used during the BNF-TNT film growth and Y is the number of SILAR cycles of CdSe deposited on the nanotubes: 3, 4, 5 and 6. In order to estimate the PCE of the composite photoanodes in a sensitized solar cell, a ZnS passivation layer was deposited on the CdSe-sensitized nanotubes without B-doping NF-Y-CdSe and BNF-Y-CdSe by SILAR after 2 cycles. Aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S were used as the Zn2+ and S2− sources, respectively.1 The samples were rinsed with DI water during the rinsing steps of SILAR. Lastly, the materials were dried in air and annealed at 250 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1.
2.3. Physicochemical characterization of the photoanodes
The morphology of the BNF-TNT membranes before and after CdSe sensitization was observed using a FEI Quanta FEG 650 instrument, while their wettability properties were assessed by contact angle measurements with Dataphysics OCA 1SEC; 24-36 VDC 3A equipment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HR) TEM images were obtained using a transmission electron microscope Tecnai F20 Super Twin TMP, with an energy laser of 200 kV. The corresponding XPS spectra were recorded using a SPECS PHOIBOS 150 spectrometer coupled with a hemispheric analyser. An Al anode (Kα = 1486.6 eV) was used as the X-ray source. High-resolution XPS spectral signals of each element determined in the materials were calibrated with respect to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Shirley background subtraction and the Gaussian–Lorentzian mixed function were applied to the XPS spectra to decompose the C 1s, O 1s, B 1s, N 1s, F 1s, Ti 2p, Cd 3d and Se 3d peaks. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the materials were recorded using a Shimadzu PC 2401 UV-vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200 nm to 800 nm. Raman spectra of the photoanodes were recorded using a confocal high-resolution Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm green laser with an integration time of 5 s, and an average of 100 scans.
The photoelectrochemical properties of bare BNF-TNT grown on Ti (X-BNF-TNT/Ti) and the X-BNF-Y-CdSe composites adhered onto ITO glass were studied in a three electrode cell, using an Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat. An electrode of Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl (+210 mV vs. NHE) and a graphite rod (AGKSP grade) were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte solution was 1.0 M Na2S (pH 12) deaerated with bubbling N2 for 20 min. The illumination source was a halide lamp with a light intensity of 60 mW cm−2. The emission spectrum of the light source is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Photopotential measurements were conducted at open circuit by varying the number of light on/off cycles. Photovoltammetry measurements were conducted from open circuit potential (OCP) at 10 mV s−1. The photocurrent transients were determined at a bias potential of 0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) during five on/off light cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under dark and illumination conditions at OCP in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz at a modulation amplitude of 10 mV. Mott–Schottky analyses were conducted from −1.2 V to 0.3 V in the negative direction, at a frequency value of 616 Hz. Semiconducting properties such as charge carrier density (Nd) and the flatband potential (Efb) were determined for TNT with different B-doping levels.
2.4. Assembly of solar cells
QD-sensitized solar cells using the BNF-Y-CdSe composites were fabricated by assembling the photoanodes with Cu2S/Cu based cathodes, which were prepared by modifying a procedure reported elsewhere.21 Briefly, Cu foils were polished using several SiC emery papers, and each one was sonicated in acetone and DI water for 5 min, and then dried in air. The treated foils were dipped into an aqueous polysulfide solution containing a mixture of 1.0 M Na2S and 1.0 M S for 20 s, producing a black film. This colour indicated the presence of Cu2S on the Cu surface.21 The solar cells were filled with a polysulfide solution containing 0.5 M Na2S and 0.5 M S dissolved in a 50% (v/v) water/methanol solution. The photovoltaic devices were characterized using an Oriel sol 3A sun simulator calibrated to AM 1.5 G conditions with a 91150V-Si reference cell. Typical current–voltage curves were obtained using a Keithley 4200 source meter at 100 mV s−1 under ambient conditions. A black plastic tape-based mask was deposited on the top of the photoanodes to avoid light scattering. The exposed geometric area of the photoanodes was 0.23 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphological and physicochemical characterization of the X-BNF-Y-CdSe photoanodes

Fig. 1a and b show FESEM images of the detached free-standing BNF-TNT arrays. The tubes are in an ordered arrangement with an average tube length of about 17 μm, a diameter of 118 nm, and a wall thickness of 18 nm. The as-detached BNF-TNT film (membrane) is translucent pale yellow in color (inset of Fig. 1a). A non-uniform coverage of the TNT arrays by QDs may block the entrance of the electrolyte into the pores.22 The data presented below demonstrate that both an adequate pore size as well as the wettability of the BNF-TNT array structure ensure that SILAR precursors permeate its entire internal and external surface. Fig. 1c and d show the typical morphology of a BNF-TNT membrane attached to the ITO glass electrode after 5 SILAR CdSe deposition cycles (BNF-5-CdSe). The BNF-TNT array was uniformly covered by CdSe and a rougher surface was observed in BNF-5-CdSe (Fig. 1c). The average pore diameter and wall thickness were around 110 nm and 48 nm, respectively. These features are suitable to achieve a large surface area to absorb sunlight and to facilitate good electron transport to the substrate. A decrease in the pore diameter to about 18 nm and sealing of the tube interspace by CdSe were observed in regard to the bare photoanode. This last characteristic enables a constant electrostatic potential along the length of the tubes.

Fig. 2a displays a low-magnification TEM image of the morphology of BNF-5-CdSe. Small nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed and distributed along the TNT length. Upon increasing the magnification further (Fig. 2b), it can be seen that the interspace among the TNTs was filled with small nanoparticles. Fig. 2c shows the HR-TEM image of the electrode material showing clear and well-defined lattice planes with interplanar d spacings of 0.35 nm and 0.29 nm corresponding to the (101) and (200) planes of the anatase phase in TiO2 (PDF-21-1272)23 and CdSe, respectively.24 The distribution of the nanoparticle size on BNF-TNT was 5.80 ± 0.05 nm, indicating that the CdSe nanoparticles are small enough to be considered as quantum dots. The Raman spectrum of the 0.06-BNF-TNT photoanode before sensitization exhibits five peaks at 145.5, 196.8, 394.7, 516.3 and 634.8 cm−1 corresponding to the anatase phase of TiO2. After CdSe sensitization, the main peak at 145.5 cm−1 decreases in intensity and four new peaks appeared at 207, 270.2, 412.3 and 471.5 cm−1. These signals correspond to the longitudinal optical phonon frequencies of CdSe,25,26 which confirms the CdSe QD deposition on the BNF-TNT surface upon SILAR treatment.

Fig. 3a displays the Eg of 0.06-BNF-TNT before and after Y-CdSe sensitization. The corresponding Eg values for each photoanode are shown in Table 1. All X-BNF-TNT photoanodes exhibited two slopes in the K–M curves associated to two different Eg values (named Eg1 and Eg2). These values are lower than intrinsically reported Eg for TiO2 (3.2 eV), which indicates the co-existence of intra band gap energy levels.4–6 By comparing the K–M curves, it can be seen that the band gaps of NF-TNT were not appreciably shifted after boron doping, although the K–M F(R) function was increased. It is well known that N and F can be incorporated into the TNT arrays during their growth, leading to N,F-co-doping. Nitrogen can generate N 2p intra band gap levels, while fluoride ions can generate a Ti3+ donor species.4,5 Thus, it can be suggested that, the photoactivation energies of around 2.86 eV and 2.34 eV for the bare NF-TNT correspond to the electron excitation from the N 2p levels to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor, and the Ti3+ states, respectively.4,27 This modification allowed the photoactivation of the TNTs under visible light. In addition, it has been claimed that the presence of boron in TiO2 also generates Ti3+ states, which causes the enhancement of visible-light absorption in the B-doped TiO2 photoanodes.6,21 The increment of the F(R) function is an indication of a higher amount of formed Ti3+ species in X-BNF-TNT than that in bare NF-TNT.28

After Y-CdSe SILAR sensitization, the composite photoanodes depicted a change in the Eg (Fig. 3b), indicating an improvement in visible-light harvesting (Table 1). The low Eg value of the BNF-Y-CdSe materials is characteristic of a high extinction coefficient of CdSe, which requires low-energy photons to photogenerate charge carriers. The Eg of bulk CdSe has been reported to be around 1.6–1.7 eV,9–11 which validates the existence of QD-type small CdSe nanoparticles. The Eg modification was accompanied with a change in the colour of the composite photoanode to increase the SILAR cycles (Fig. 3c). It has been reported that with an increase in the number of SILAR immersions, the sensitizer particle size increased as a result of QD agglomeration. This leads to the formation of continuous band energies from discrete ones in the sensitizer, narrowing its band gap. The latter effect is known as quantum confinement,29–31 which allows tuning of the optical properties of cadmium chalcogenide QDs deposited on TiO2.
The inherent band gap change during SILAR sensitization causes a band edge rearrangement in the TiO2/sensitizer interface, which can enhance or restrain charge carrier transport into the composite.29 According to the latter, the particle size of the CdSe QDs for various SILAR cycles could be determined by the Brus eqn (1):32 (1)where Eg,QD is the bang gap energy of the CdSe QDs, Eg,bulk is the band gap associated with the CdSe bulk (1.6 eV),11h is the Plank constant, r is the radius of the CdSe QDs, and me* and mh* are the effective mass of electrons and holes in CdSe, respectively. By using eqn (1), the diameters of CdSe QDs were found to be 4.43 nm, 5.0 nm, 5.58 nm and 7.90 nm for 3-CdSe, 4-CdSe, 5-CdSe and 6-CdSe QD, respectively. A comparison of the diameter values of 5-CdSe QD estimated by eqn (1) and HR-TEM analysis showed a good accordance, which allowed us to confirm the intimate relationship between the Eg and particle size of the CdSe QDs.
After probing the presence of CdSe QDs on BNF-TNT, the XPS analysis of 0.06-BNF-5-CdSe was performed in order to observe the chemical composition and state of each element in the material as shown in Fig. 4. Elemental survey (Fig. 4a) corroborates the presence of C, O, Ti, Cd and Se. B, N and F were not seen in the general spectra as a result of the analysis depth (10 nm). This indicates the low amount of these elements added during the anodization process. Thus, elemental survey map and high-resolution XPS spectra of B 1s, N 1s, F 1s and Ti 2p were obtained for the 0.06-BNF-TNT photoanode in order to observe the influence of the latter elements on the chemical environment of the Ti species before CdSe sensitization.

Fig. 4b depicts the typical high-resolution (HR) XPS C 1s spectrum commonly obtained for TNT based photoanodes. Three contributions decomposed at 284.6, 286 and 288.4 eV were associated to the carbon contamination.6,33 The HR-XPS N 1s spectrum of 0.06-BNF-TNT is shown in Fig. 4c, where two contributions were observed at 399.3 eV and 401.1 eV. The first signal was associated to the substitutional N in TiO2, forming N–Ti–O type bonds, while the second signal was attributed to the interstitial N generating a N–O–Ti type structure into the semiconductor lattice.4,5,34,35 Moreover, a unique F 1s peak was seen at 684.2 eV, corresponding to the incorporation of substitutional fluoride into TiO2 (Fig. 4d). According to the similar ionic radius between O2− and F−, the oxygen positions can be easily swapped by the fluoride ions. The latter N and F contributions have been assigned during the XPS studies for the N,F-co-doped TiO2 photoanodes.4 The B 1s peak observed at 191.2 eV (Fig. 4e) corresponds to boron introduced into the interstitial positions of the TiO2 lattice, which is characteristic of B-TiO2 materials.6,21,28,36
The effect of B, N and F on the chemical states of the Ti species in 0.06-BNF-TNT was seen in the curve-fitted HR XPS Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 4f). The Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 doublets were well fitted to add three different types of species during the spectrum decomposition. The BE of each component estimated in this analysis is in agreement with those reported elsewhere.6,37 The doublets at 458.2/464 eV were related to the Ti4+ species from the TiO2 lattice, while the peaks at 457/462.1 eV were ascribed to the presence of Ti3+. The peaks at 459.7/464.8 eV were associated to the Ti–F bond,38 validating the chemical species observed in the F 1s spectrum. Both interstitial B and substitutional F can donate valence electrons to Ti4+, which induces the formation of Ti3+ donors.4–6 However, the current analysis did not provide information about the fraction of Ti3+ separately produced by B- and F-modification. Thus, the fraction of Ti3+ was also estimated for a pristine NF-TNT from the XPS Ti 2p spectrum, and 1.23% of Ti3+ species was observed.35 In this study for 0.06-BNF-TNT, the amount of Ti3+ was around 1.72%, which means an increase in the donor species after B-doping. It corroborates the rise of the K–M F(R) function of 0.06-BNF-TNT as an indirect measure of the visible light absorption improvement.
Although N-modification did not promote the generation of Ti3+, the presence of N intra band gap levels in TiO2 produced a decrease in Eg. Hence, the chemical modification of the TNTs in the presence of B, N and F points out the B,N,F-tri-doping of TiO2.
After 5-CdSe sensitization, the HR-XPS Cd 3d (Fig. 4g) and Se 3d (Fig. 4h) spectra were recorded, showing their corresponding contributions. In the Cd 3d spectrum, the typical Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 doublets were observed at 404.8 eV and 411.6 eV, respectively. The Se 3d spectrum was fitted with the inclusion of two components at 53.4 eV and 54.2 eV, associated with the characteristic Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 doublets. The presence of CdO or/and SeO2 were not detected, which means the successful formation of CdSe on 0.06-BNF-TNT.39,40
3.2. Photo(electro)chemical properties of the X-BNF-Y-CdSe composites
The effect of boron doping on the photochemical and photoelectrochemical performance of BNF-TNT was investigated. Upon illumination, the open-circuit potential (Eoc) of the BNF-TNT samples shifted towards more negative values (Fig. 5a). This shift indicates the accumulation of electrons in n-type TiO2. The 0.04-BNF-TNT photoanode (blue line) showed the most negative stationary Eoc under illumination, however, differences in these values among the samples were negligibly small. Linear sweep photovoltammetry and chopped-light chronoamperometry measurements were performed to study the photoelectrochemical performances of the X-BNF-TNT photoanodes (Fig. 5b). The dark current was negligible and did not contribute to the photocurrent.
 Fig. 5  (a) Open-circuit photopotential, (b) linear sweep photovoltammetry (v = 10 mV s−1), (c) photocurrent transients during turn-on and -off of the light under a bias of 0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl and (d) Mott–Schottky analysis under dark conditions for the NF-TNT and X-BNF-TNT photoanodes, as shown in the figure legends. Electrolyte: 1.0 M Na2S (pH 12); illumination: 150 W halide lamp (60 mW cm−2). 
By increasing the amount of H3BO3 up to 0.06 wt%, the highest photocurrent was reached. However, when this amount was exceeded, the photoresponse of the photoanodes was decreased about twice with respect to the highest photocurrent. This tendency was pointed out in terms of a suitable amount of Ti3+ produced in the presence of interstitial boron, achieved when 0.06 wt% H3BO3 was used. This explains the depletion layer (W) compaction after boron modification (Fig. S2, ESI†),41,42 improving the conducting properties of NF-TNT. Unlike photopotential measurements, a higher H3BO3 content than 0.04 wt% can promote an increase of the charge carriers separated and transported through the photoanode, improving its light harvesting and PEC performance.23 Conversely, to surpass the adequate amount of H3BO3, a clear decrease of the photocurrent is caused by the excessive Ti3+. Here, an electron–hole pair recombination is favoured, which diminishes the possibility for electrons to reach the current collector.
The influence of H3BO3 content on the light harvesting capability and charge carrier transport into the X-BNF-TNT photoanodes was also observed in the chronoamperometric curves obtained under chopped light at 0.45 VAg/AgCl (Fig. 5c). An increase of the photocurrent was rapidly achieved due to the electron–hole pair generation and separation, where the electrons were diffused to the current collector.6 However, a current spike followed by low current decay was observed during the photocurrent transient measurements upon illumination, indicative of the unavoidable electron–hole recombination.35,41
When the charge carrier generation and recombination rate attained equilibrium, a steady-state photocurrent was reached. Once the light was turned off, the current dropped almost to zero, without decay tails. This was attributed to the efficient address of electron transport into the photoanodes due to the well-oriented structure of the TNTs.23,35 In addition, the photocurrent produced in each transient remained almost constant, which is associated to the high stability of the materials. After five on–off cycles, X-BNF-TNT displayed the same trend that was observed during the photovoltammetry measurements, where the highest photocurrent was achieved with the 0.06-BNF-TNT photoanode. This result confirmed the improvement of visible-light absorption, efficient electron–hole pair separation and photoelectron mobility through the TNTs after boron modification. The excess of the interstitial boron/Ti3+ species formed after doping decreased the photocurrent, which means that charge carrier recombination assisted by these donor states influences the PEC performance of the 0.09-BNF-TNT photoanode.
The decrease or improvement of the PEC performance of X-BNF-TNT with the increase of Ti3+ after boron doping, indicate a change in the semiconducting properties of NF-TNT. These properties were studied by Mott–Schottky (M–S) analyses (Fig. 5d) through the estimation of the charge carrier density (Nd) and flatband potential (Efb) under dark conditions. By plotting the space charge capacitance (Csc−2) as a function of the applied potential, a positive slope was obtained in the linear region of plots for all photoanodes. This behaviour is well known for n-type semiconductors, which displays a good accordance with the open circuit response of the photoanodes. Accordingly, the M–S equation was used to observe the effect of the amount of H3BO3 on Nd and Efb(2): (2)where NA is the Avogadro number, F is the Faraday constant, ε0 and ε are the vacuum and TiO2 permittivity (ε = 50, anatase), respectively, R, the gas constant (8.314 J K−1 mol−1) and Eapp is the potential applied during the measurements. Nd was estimated from the slope of the M–S plots, while Efb was determined from the intercept of the straight line with the potential axis (Table 2). To increase the amount of H3BO3 in the X-BNF-TNT photoanodes, the obtained positive slope for each material was decreased than that of bare NF-TNT. The slope diminution in the M–S plots was attributed to a gradual increase of Nd in the photoanodes. According to the abovementioned XPS Ti 2p analysis, the amount of Ti3+ was higher after boron modification. Therefore, the increase of Nd is the direct result of a higher Ti3+ content after doping. Furthermore, Efb was simultaneously displaced to more negative values, which indicates an increase of the accumulated electrons in the modified photoanodes.4,6 In this case, a shift of the Fermi level close to the CB of TiO2 was reached. This analysis corroborates the relationship between the PEC performance and the semiconducting properties of X-BNF-TNT, both influenced by the amount of boron precursor. According to the latter, the PEC process can describe faithfully the photoresponse of the photoanodes in order to estimate the adequate preparation conditions.

In order to incorporate abovementioned types of materials into a photovoltaic device, for instance a sensitized solar cell, two main characteristics should be considered: (1) a transparent photoanode under forward illumination to avoid intensity loss by reverse illumination, and (2) collection of a large amount of low-energy photons to produce a high photocurrent.2,7,12 Hence, the 0.06-BNF-TNT photoanode was detached from the Ti substrate and adhered onto ITO. Then, it was sensitized with CdSe QDs using a diverse number of SILAR cycles, referred as BNF-Y-CdSe. The PC and PEC properties of the as-prepared photoanodes were investigated (Fig. 6) to choose a transparent material with good features (improved light harvesting and electron mobility) to be used in QDSSCs. In addition, the cause of synergism between B-doping and the CdSe-sensitizer can be established.
 Fig. 6  (a) Open circuit photopotential, (b) electron lifetime obtained from the OCPD and (c) linear sweep photovoltammetry (v = 10 mV s−1) for the BNF-Y-CdSe photoanodes. Electrolyte: 1.0 M Na2S (pH 12), illumination: 150 W halide lamp (60 mW cm−2). The inset of Fig. 5b displays the normalized OCPD of the NF-5-CdSe and BNF-5-CdSe photoanodes. 
As an initial stage, the open circuit potentials of the free-standing films are shown in Fig. 6a. Before sensitization, the photostationary Eoc for the pristine NF-TNT membrane was ∼−0.82 VAg/AgCl, which was slightly less negative than that of the 0.06-BNF-TNT free standing film, ∼−0.85 VAg/AgCl. This corroborated the higher PC performance of BNF-TNT than that of NF-TNT as observed in Fig. 5. Conversely, the photostationary Eoc of the free-standing BNF-TNT films was displaced towards more negative values to increase the number of SILAR cycles during CdSe QD sensitization. The estimated Eoc in a photosteady state was ∼(−1.10, −1.15, −1.17 and −1.20) VAg/AgCl for BNF-Y-CdSe, where Y = 3, 4, 5 and 6 SILAR cycles, respectively. This displacement was attributed to the increase in the amount of photoelectrons injected to BNF-TNT from the CdSe QDs, which makes the Fermi level more negative.1,12,30,43
The improvement of light harvesting with the increase of the SILAR cycles during CdSe sensitization is also mediated with the decrease of Eg, requiring less energy to generate more electron–hole pairs and shift Eoc. Nevertheless, after 450 min under illumination, the BNF-6-CdSe photoanode shows a displacement in the Eoc to more positive values. It has been claimed that upon increasing the SILAR cycles of cadmium chalcogenides, an unsuitable band alignment inside the heterostructure can be promoted.2,12 It causes an electron–hole recombination in the composite and decreases its photoresponse. Here, it was demonstrated that the narrowing of Eg unavoidably caused a closer energy separation between the conduction band positions of TiO2 and CdSe QDs, which was enough to promote injection electrons to the latter semiconductor. However, the likelihood of carrier recombination increases. To prove this hypothesis, the open-circuit potential decay curves (also known as OCPD transient) were obtained from the photopotential decay after interrupting the illumination as a response of the charge carrier recombination in the BNF-Y-CdSe/electrolyte interfaces. The quick or slow response of the OCPD is directly proportional to the photoelectron recombination rate. According to the latter, the electron lifetime (τn) can be determined from the reciprocal of the potential decay as a function of time (dEoc/dt) by the following relationship (3):14 (3)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, and e, the electron charge. Fig. 6b depicts the variation of τnvs. potential plots obtained from the OCPD transients, showing an increase in the electron lifetime by using 5 SILAR cycles upon CdSe sensitization.
A high electron lifetime accompanied with a slow OCPD is an indication of a low recombination of photoelectrons mainly associated with the following paths: (1) recombination of accumulated photoelectrons in the conduction band of CdSe or (2) injected electrons to TiO2 with the electrolyte, and (3) electron–hole recombination inside the sensitizer.43 In this case, it is noteworthy that there is an enhancement of charge carrier recombination inhibition between the BNF-Y-CdSe photoanode and the electrolyte (paths 1 and 2), to increase the SILAR cycles until 5. Conversely, increasing the SILAR cycles to 6, a fast OCPD and a decrease of τn were achieved. Although 6-CdSe QDs inject electrons to BNF-TNT to generate an increase of Eoc (in all SILAR cycles, the conduction band of CdSe is higher than that of BNF-TNT), Eoc is eventually decreased under illumination (Fig. 6a), which is indicative of the electron–hole pair recombination inside the CdSe QDs (path 3). It indicates the lowering of the CB in 6-CdSe closer to BNF-TNT, causing the photodegradation of CdSe.
On the other hand, in order to analyse the influence of boron doping on the PC properties of BNF-5-CdSe, a bare free-standing NF-TNT film supported on ITO was also sensitized with 5-CdSe (referred as NF-5-CdSe). A lower Eoc (around −1.02 VAg/AgCl), τn and a faster OCPD were obtained unlike BNF-5-CdSe, which allows to point out that the amount of Ti3+ increased in the presence of boron is critical for the enhancement of the PC response in the composite. The decline of the electron recombination in the materials before and after B-doping can be seen to normalize its corresponding OCPD transient and fit the curve with a first-order kinetic model. Then, the recombination rate constant (Kr) for each photoanode is estimated by the following eqn (4):44 (4)where E is the potential at any time during the decay, Eoc is the photosteady-state potential and Eoc, the steady-state potential under dark conditions. From the normalized OCPD transients (inset of Fig. 6b), the recombination rate constants were found to be 5.3 × 10−2 s−1 and 1.1 × 10−2 s−1 for the NF-5-CdSe and BNF-5-CdSe photoanodes, respectively. It indicates the retarding of the electron recombination to increase the amount of Ti3+ species and thereby, the electron flow into the composite by B-doping. Under illumination conditions, Ti3+ can donate electrons to the VB of CdSe in the BNF-Y-CdSe heterostructures,16 which prevents the photodecomposition of the sensitizer. Thus, a low Kr corroborated the increase of the electron lifetime and the PC performance of BNF-5-CdSe after boron incorporation. The ability of charge carrier separation and transport inside the composites was studied by photovoltammetry in a positive going direction (Fig. 6c). It can be seen that in all cases, the composites generated a higher photocurrent than NF-TNT and BNF-TNT.16,17 This demonstrated the maximizing of visible-light harvesting, the accumulation of more charge carriers, for instance photogenerated holes in the composite to oxidize S2− ions from the electrolyte, and the electron transport to back contact upon CdSe sensitization.3,8 The latter was corroborated by contact angle measurements, by observing an improvement of the hydrophilicity in the CdSe-sensitized photoanodes than that of bare BNF-TNT. This indicates an intimate interaction between S2− and the composite surface (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Upon increasing the number of cycles up to 5, the highest photocurrent was reached, which is indicative of an efficient spatial separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the TiO2/CdSe heterostructure. Conversely, to extend the number of SILAR cycles over 5, the photocurrent declined, meaning that a charge carrier recombination was favoured. This trend allowed correlating the photovoltammetry curves with the OCPD transients, in order to gain understanding about the interaction between BNF-TNT and CdSe QDs in the heterostructure. According to the photopotential measurements for the composites, a type-II heterojunction could be established in the TiO2/CdSe interface,3,7,14 providing an increment in the Eoc to increase the number of SILAR cycles. Here, more photogenerated electrons coming from CdSe could be injected into TiO2via the CB and transported to back contact, which enhances the conducting properties and the electron lifetime of the composites.45 Contrariwise, the eventual decrease of Eoc and the quick OCPD to sensitize BNF-TNT with 6-CdSe caused the narrowing of the CBs in the BNF-TNT/6-CdSe interface. Thus, a minor amount of electrons was available to be transported from the photoanode/electrolyte interface to back contact, decreasing the PEC performance of the composites after 6-CdSe sensitization.
The narrowing of the CB edges in the BNF-TNT/CdSe interface to vary the number of SILAR cycles was corroborated through the determination of the band structure by using the concept of Mulliken electronegativity (Fig. 7). Here, the electronegativity of an atom is defined as the average sum of the electron affinity and the ionization potential.12 According to the latter, the absolute electronegativity (χ) of a semiconductor is the geometric mean of the electronegativity of each atom present in the material.46 Here, the associated energy of the CB and VB edges (ECB and EVB, respectively) can be estimated by eqn (5) and (6):12,46 ECB = χ − Ee − 0.5Eg(5) EVB = ECB + Eg(6)where Ee is the free energy of electrons in the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV). χTiO2 and χCdSe were calculated to be 5.80 eV and 4.94 eV, respectively. Calculations of ECB are often found in the literature at the isoelectric point of semiconductors (around 2.0 for Cd chalcogenides and 5.80 for TiO2).15 Nonetheless, in order to determine the corresponding values at pH 12, ECB and EVB were shifted by 0.059 eV per pH unit. As seen in Fig. 7, a smaller difference between the CB edges of CdSe and BNF-TNT was achieved to increase the number of SILAR cycles, due to the quantum confinement effect. After 6-CdSe sensitization, the lowest driving force for electron injection from 6-CdSe to BNF-TNT was generated, which favoured electron–hole pair recombination in the sensitizer. The latter explains the decrease of the photocurrent seen in the photovoltammetry curves (Fig. 6c) as a response of the restrained electron transport to back contact. Further, a much higher photocurrent was produced by BNF-5-CdSe than NF-5-CdSe, which is a consequence of a higher fraction of Ti3+ in the former material. More electrons could be transferred from the Ti3+ species to CdSe and then to TNT via the CB, which improves the PEC properties of BNF-Y-CdSe.
 Fig. 7  Band structure of the BNF-Y-CdSe sensitized photoanodes as a function of number of SILAR cycles (Y). 
The charge carrier ability of the composites depending on the presence and absence of boron and the load of deposited CdSe was also studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The corresponding EIS parameters of the materials are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Under dark conditions, the lowest electron transport resistance was observed in BNF-5-CdSe, establishing a suitable band structure to achieve improved charge carrier separation. By exceeding the number of SILAR cycles, the electron mobility is blocked. Under illumination, the boron modification enhanced the conducting properties of the photoanodes, assisting to a higher electron flow to back contact compared with NF-5-CdSe. The results demonstrate the synergism between doping and sensitization to guarantee materials with good PCE.
3.3. Photovoltaic properties of the X-BNF-Y-CdSe composites
By using photoelectrochemistry, the enhancement of light absorption, charge carrier separation and transport was seen upon non-metal doping and cadmium selenide sensitization. However, the literature about the combination of doping and sensitization in photovoltaics is scarce, which represents a big challenge in the generation of comparable PCE employing these types of materials, with conventional cadmium chalcogenides sensitized TiO2 based photoanodes. In this work, QDSSCs were fabricated by assembling the BNF-5-CdSe composite with a Cu2S/Cu cathode, and filling the cell with a polysulfide solution. A ZnS layer was deposited onto the composite to avoid electron recombination with the electrolyte and its photodecomposition.43 For each solar device fabricated with the corresponding photoanode, three identical samples were checked to observe the reproducibility of the cell performance.
To validate the synergistic behaviour between B-doping and 5-CdSe sensitization suggested during the electrochemical and PEC characterization, the photovoltaic properties of the NF-5-CdSe and BNF-5-CdSe photoanodes were investigated using the typical current–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 8a). Photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE were estimated from the J–V curves and are shown in Table 3. As it can be observed, the PCE of the BNF-5-CdSe based solar cell was higher than that of the NF-5-TNT one after boron doping. Despite this enhancement, low Voc and FF values were obtained during the measurements. According to the literature, the latter can be explained by two possible reasons: (1) internal charge carrier recombination inside the CdSe QDs or with the polysulfide electrolyte solution, and/or (2) electron trapping by grain boundaries in the CdSe nanoparticle interconnection.30,43,47 These issues commonly block the carrier transport to the electronic conductor (in this case BNF TNT), decreasing the number of available electrons to reach the cathode. In this sense, the ability of Cu2S cathode for regenerating the polysulfide can be decreased. Beyond these disadvantages, a high Jsc was achieved in the devices, more evidently for the BNF-5-CdSe composite. The increase of the Ti3+ fraction in BNF-5-CdSe led to an improvement of sunlight harvesting in the material and assist the charge carrier separation into CdSe more efficiently into a solar device than the NF-5-CdSe composite.

The highest PCE of the champion photoanodes without and with B doping was 1.07% and 1.88%, respectively under 1 sun illumination. The PCE of BNF-5 CdSe was higher than those of the other composite photoanodes reported in the literature, for instance, TiO2/CdS/CdSe1,2 or TiO2/CdSxSe1−x48,49 based heterojunctions. From these results, it was deduced that a photoanode modified by doping/sensitization combination can be an alternative material for the improvement of the PCE in QDSSCs in the future.
According to the optical properties and band structures determined by the Mulliken approach for the composite photoanodes, as shown in Fig. 7, an electron transport mechanism into the BNF-5-CdSe/electrolyte interface can be proposed (Fig. 8b). Under illumination, CdSe can generate charge carriers, requiring a band gap of 1.72 eV. Due to the good band alignment formed between BNF-TNT and CdSe, the photogenerated electrons in the sensitizer are injected into the former semiconductor. It facilitates charge carrier separation into CdSe. Simultaneously, the N 2p energy levels incorporated into the TNTs during the anodization process (N-doping) can promote electrons into the CB of TiO2 with a band gap of 2.83 eV.4,27 These levels can also promote electrons to the Ti3+ species requiring 2.36 eV. The Ti3+ states are located at 0.47 eV from the bottom of the CB. This value is closer to the energy reported in previous studies.4,6 The similarity between the Ti3+ states and the VB of CdSe allows electron transport to the sensitizer, which inhibits the charge carrier recombination and the photodecomposition of CdSe.16 To add boron into NF-TNT, more Ti3+ can be produced, which increases the number of electrons being transferred to CdSe. Thus, more electrons can be transported from the BNF-5-CdSe/electrolyte interface to back contact, generating a higher photocurrent (a high PCE) than that of NF-Y-CdSe. Then, electrons are collected by the Cu2S/Cu cathode to regenerate the polysulfide solution.
4. Conclusions
The effect of boron on the photochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of BNF-TNT was studied, by finding a direct ratio between the amount of Ti3+ and the PC/PEC performance of the materials. A high amount of Ti3+ promoted the enhancement of the light absorption ability of the B-modified materials. BNF-TNT adhesion on conducting glass and their CdSe QD sensitization by the SILAR method allowed fabricating semitransparent photoanodes with efficient light harvesting ability. However, the number of SILAR cycles used during sensitization affected the latter ability, besides charge carrier separation and transport into the composites. This was caused by a band alignment between BNF-TNT and CdSe QDs, which was suitable after 5 SILAR cycles. A II-type heterojunction structure was formed in the BNF-5-CdSe interface, facilitating electron injection toward TiO2. Thus, a slow OCPD and a high electron lifetime in the composite were achieved.
A higher Ti3+ fraction induced by B-modification enhanced the electron flow through the BNF-5-CdSe photoanode. It led to the generation of a PCE of 1.88%, higher than that of the undoped composite (1.07%). The former efficiency was comparable with the reported values for the other sensitized modified TiO2 photoanodes. The role of boron in the composites allowed deducing that synergism between doping and chalcogenide sensitization is established by carrier transfer from donor states into TiO2 as Ti3+ to the VB edge of the sensitizer. This favours electron injection and flow into the BNF-Y-CdSe/electrolyte interface to reach the back contact. It is recommended studying combinations of metal or/and other non-metal doped-TNTs with chalcogenides, to take advantage of the synergistic behaviour between doping and sensitization to enhance the PCE of QDSSCs.
