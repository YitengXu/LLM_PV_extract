1. Introduction
Design and fabrication of wide-bandgap semiconducting metal oxide nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention in the past two decades, due to their size- and morphology-dependent physical, chemical, electronic and optical properties.1–5 Among the numerous metal oxide semiconductors, tin dioxide (SnO2) with a bulk bandgap of 3.6 eV has been widely investigated because of its promising applications in many fields, including lithium ion batteries (LIBs), gas sensors, sensitized solar cells and field emission flat display devices.6–13 Great progress has been achieved in the size- and morphology-controllable synthesis of SnO2 nanostructures, such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanorods/nanowires/nanotubes/nanobelts, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets and three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures assembled from lower-dimensional nanostructured building blocks.6 SnO2 nanoarrays are ordered (or less ordered) nanostructures composed of SnO2 units of different dimensionalities, which are usually directly grown on various substrates. On one hand, the nanoarrays inherit the advantages of their constituting nanostructured building blocks, such as large surface-to-volume ratio, high surface energy and high reactivity. On the other hand, their alignment on substrates prevents aggregation and guarantees an open frame structure, thus facilitating the diffusion of reactants and improving the rates of chemical reactions at the interface. Very importantly, SnO2 nanoarrays grown on desired substrates can be directly utilized in devices, such as solar cells and LIBs. Therefore, purposeful design of SnO2 nanoarrays with well-defined morphologies is of importance not only for fundamental research but also for a variety of industrial applications.
This Highlight article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the synthetic strategies, growth mechanism and the resulting morphologies of SnO2 nanoarrays composed of nanostructured building blocks, which are deposited on different substrates, such as conductive metal foil, silicon wafers and transparent conductive oxide glass, as well as on carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene sheets and graphite paper. In the second part of the article, we consider the properties of the SnO2 nanoarrays related to their energy conversion and storage applications in sensitized solar cells and LIBs. We hope that this Highlight article provides rational understanding on the design principles of the SnO2 nanoarrays on desired substrates and their physicochemical properties associated with different architectures and different anticipated applications, inspiring and advancing future research on this topic.
2. Growth and morphology of SnO2 nanoarrays
Generally, SnO2 nanoarrays can be classified into 1D nanoarrays, 2D nanoarrays and 3D nanoarrays in terms of their morphology. Their fabrication is based on template-free and template synthesis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) based on the vapor(–liquid)–solid (VLS) mechanism, and solution phase wet-chemical synthesis such as solvothermal and hydrothermal treatment. Among all these methods, the hydrothermal method is widely used, due to flexible control of both the size and morphology of the resulting nanostructures, while some other methods such as those based on the VLS mechanism are usually limited to the growth of 1D nanowire arrays. Table 1 summarizes the typical morphologies of SnO2 nanoarrays in terms of growth methods, precursors and substrates used.

2.1. 1D SnO2 nanoarrays
1D SnO2 nanoarrays include nanorod, nanowire and nanotube morphologies, which can be produced by both template-free and template approaches.

Template-free synthesis of 1D SnO2 nanoarrays can be classified into two groups: methods based on the vapor–solid (VS) growth mechanism, such as CVD and thermal evaporation,24,25,39–41 and wet-chemical synthesis including low-temperature solution synthesis and solvo/hydrothermal methods.
Utilizing the VLS mechanism, Ko et al.24 prepared SnO2 nanowire arrays on a conductive substrate (stainless steel) via the thermal evaporation and vapor-phase transport synthetic method at a high temperature of 600 °C using commercial Sn metal powder as a tin source and a noble metal such as Au as the catalyst. Li et al.42 produced vertically aligned SnO2 nanocone arrays with large area on FTO glass by heating a mixture of SnCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2 at 600 °C in air (Fig. 1a–c). The morphology control of the nanocones has been achieved by adjusting the heat treatment time. In the growth process, a single-layer SnO2 nanoparticle film first formed via the VS process, and provided seeds for nanocone arrays (Fig. 1a). The SnO2 nanocones were single crystalline and grew along the [110] direction, and the formation of sharp tips was attributed to a concentration gradient of the reactants. Huang et al.43 prepared uniform SnO2 nanorod arrays (Fig. 1d–h) by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at substrate temperatures below 300 °C using dibutyltin diacetate ((C4H9)2Sn(OOCCH3)2) as a precursor and oxygen as the reaction gas. SiO2/Si wafers were used as substrates with no further heating during deposition and no application of any additional catalyst. The SnO2 nanorods also grew along the [110] direction (Fig. 1h), which was explained by the self-catalyzed VS growth mechanism. According to this mechanism, a thin layer of SnO2 seed crystals was initially formed on the substrate. Compared with other faces, (110) faces have the lowest surface energy, as well as the shortest interatomic distances between neighboring tin atoms, leading to the best efficiency for the chemisorption and dissociation of oxygenated compounds at the SnO2 interface. As a result, [110] became the preferential growth direction of SnO2 seed crystals.

Solution-based wet-chemical syntheses are widely used for the growth of 1D SnO2 nanoarrays, due to their low cost and potential for large-scale production. Vayssieres et al.44 reported the one-step, aqueous, low-temperature growth of SnO2 nanorod arrays on various polycrystalline, single-crystalline, or amorphous substrates such as silicon, FTO glass and silicon oxide wafers. The highly ordered and crystalline SnO2 nanorods, typically 50 nm in width and 500 nm in length, were prepared by treating substrates in an aqueous solution containing SnCl4·5H2O and urea at mild temperatures (i.e., below 100 °C). The introduction of urea had an important role in facilitating the simultaneous hydrolysis/condensation by olation of Sn4+. The nanorods possessed a square cross-section, elongated along the c-axis and exhibiting (110) prismatic faces. Liu et al.18 produced SnO2 nanorod arrays on flexible metallic substrates with large area (Fe–Co–Ni alloy and Ni foil) via hydrothermal treatment of basic SnCl4·5H2O aqueous solution, where the heteronucleation and growth of SnO2 occurred at the surface of the metal substrates by the slow release of hydroxyl ions and water from Sn(OH)62−, resulting in highly oriented and c-elongated SnO2 nanorods. As the sequence of the surface energy of SnO2 per crystal face is (110) < (100) < (101) < (001), the growth in the [001] direction is faster, which leads to the formation of surfaces enclosed by {110} planes. Wang et al.19 introduced NaCl into SnCl4·5H2O–NaOH precursor solution, and realized the size-controlled growth of single-crystalline SnO2 nanorod arrays on a Ti substrate, which was pre-coated with a thin SnO2 buffer layer by magnetron sputtering.
Wang et al.45 reported the direct growth of vertically aligned SnO2 nanowire arrays on stainless steel and copper substrates via the hydrothermal route (Fig. 2a–e). Different from the previous reports,18,19 a mixture of solvents (water–ethanol) at pH 12 was used. The resulting SnO2 nanowires with a diameter from 100 to 150 nm and a length of around 500 nm showed octahedral tips (Fig. 2b). Chen et al.17 carried out solvothermal synthesis to produce arrays of mesocrystalline SnO2 nanorods on arbitrary substrates (Fig. 2f–g), including Ti foil, FTO, graphite, Si and Teflon, using SnCl4 as the tin source and NaBr as the additive. Instead of the commonly used alkaline solvent medium, a tri-component mixture of acetic acid, ethanol and water was adopted, with the ratio of these three solvents influencing the hydrolysis rate of Sn4+ ions and hence the morphology of the resulting arrays (Fig. 2h). At the initial stage, SnO2 nuclei appeared on the substrate, gradually evolving into tetragonal SnO2 nanorods consisting of a bundle of primary nanorods, which grew independently along the [001] direction and finally formed mesocrystalline nanorod arrays with organic ligands filling the interstitials to prevent the fusion of the subunits.

Zhang et al.20 fabricated SnO2 nanorod arrays on graphene substrates using a seed-directed hydrothermal method, while without the presence of the seed layer, nanorods were assembled into 3D nanoflower-like structures. In contrast, Han et al.21 reported the hydrothermal synthesis without SnO2 seeds on the graphene nanosheets, with mercaptoacetic acid promoting the direct growth of rod-like SnO2 arrays. Using the hydrothermal method, Jiang et al.46 synthesized a bilayer structure of SnO2 nanorod arrays grown along the opposite direction without the use of any substrate. Li et al.47 reported yet another bilayer structure with SnO2 nanorod arrays formed as upper layers on Fe2O3 nanotube arrays serving as a substrate.

Template-based synthesis of 1D SnO2 nanoarrays offers many advantages, such as the narrow size distribution and high order of the resulting structures. The drawbacks of this approach are the necessity for template removal, as well as the limited ability to conduct large-scale synthesis. The popular templates for the synthesis of 1D SnO2 nanoarrays are anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes11,14,15,28,48 and ZnO nanoarrays.26,29,49,50
AAO membranes have been used to prepare 1D SnO2 nanoarrays with rod-, wire- or tube-like morphologies, whose dimensions and morphologies are governed both by the structural parameters of the templates and the synthetic approaches. Zheng et al.,14 Kolmakov et al.11 and Wu et al.15 prepared uniform SnO2 nanowire or nanorod arrays by electrochemical deposition of metallic Sn nanowires onto AAO membranes with subsequent thermal oxidization, which converts Sn into SnO2 nanowires by annealing in air. The AAO templates can be easily removed by treatment in alkaline (such as NaOH) solution. Zhu et al.48 fabricated SnO2 nanotube arrays by combining the use of AAO templates with the sol–gel method, with the AAO templates immersed in a Sn-based sol solution, allowing for the incorporation of the Sn precursor followed by gelation and sintering. Shi et al.28 produced SnO2 nanotube or nanowire arrays by hydrothermally treating K2SnO3·3H2O–urea in water–ethanol solution, with the AAO templates immersed in the reaction system. Due to the confinement effect of AAO templates, the crystal growth is determined by the structural characteristics of the templates such as the pore length and diameter. Since the growth of SnO2 originates from the inner surface of the pore walls and then gradually extends inside the pores, the wall thickness of the SnO2 nanotubes could be tuned by adjusting the reaction time. Using atomic layer deposition on AAO templates with SnCl4 and H2O as precursors, Sun et al.51 reported the different temperature-dependent growth modes of SnO2 nanotubes, namely, layer-by-layer and layer-by-particle modes.
Other templates for SnO2 nanotube arrays are 1D ZnO rods, which can be easily fabricated on various substrates such as FTO or metal foil by wet chemical treatment.52,53 In most of these methods, ZnO nanoarrays serve as sacrificial templates, which can easily be removed by acid etching. Wang et al.26 reported the large-scale synthesis of SnO2 nanotube arrays by hydrothermal treatment of ZnO nanorod arrays (Fig. 3). ZnO nanorods were grown on a Ti substrate by a seed-assisted hydrothermal reaction, followed by OH−-assisted deposition of a SnO2 layer to obtain the ZnO/SnO2 core–shell nanowire array. Finally, ZnO templates could be easily removed by immersing the core–shell nanowire array in HCl solution, resulting in the formation of SnO2 nanotubes (Fig. 3b). Tu et al.29 prepared SnO2 nanotube arrays on silicon wafers by a liquid phase deposition method, where the deposition of SnO2 and etching of ZnO templates proceeded simultaneously.29,54 Kuang et al.55 fabricated well-aligned SnO2 nanotube arrays on silicon substrates using ZnO nanorod arrays as sacrificial templates, on which a layer of SnO2 was coated via CVD to form an epitaxial core/shell heterostructure. In this method, due to the epitaxial deposition of SnO2 on the ZnO template, the resulting SnO2 nanotubes were highly oriented along the [100] direction and nearly single-crystalline, which are different from the polycrystalline SnO2 nanoarrays typically obtained from solution-based template synthesis. Desai et al.54 prepared vertically aligned SnO2 nanotube arrays through a liquid-phase conversion process using ZnO nanowires as sacrificial templates which were pre-grown on ITO glass.

2.2. 2D SnO2 nanoarrays
2D SnO2 nanostructures, typically in the form of nanosheets or nanowalls, are highly anisotropic structures with a high percentage of specific facets exposed, making them an ideal platform for studies of facet-dependent properties.56 2D SnO2 nanoarrays on various substrates are commonly obtained by solution syntheses, such as hydrothermal and low-temperature wet-chemical synthesis methods.
Zhang et al.57 prepared SnO2 nanosheet arrays on various conductive substrates, including Ti foil, Cu foil and flexible graphite paper, via hydrothermal treatment of SnCl2·2H2O in an aqueous solution containing HCl, mercaptoacetic acid and urea (Fig. 4a–b). The layer-by-layer growth of SnO2 nanosheets could be achieved with the pre-grown layer serving as the substrate for the next layer deposition by simply repeating the growth procedure, which allows for easy control of thickness. Fig. 4b shows that the layer thickness was ~250 nm for each growth cycle as a result of hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 6 h. Wang et al.38 grew SnO2 nanosheet arrays on FTO glass by a hydrothermal method using SnCl2·2H2O as the tin source and NaF as the morphology-controlling agent (Fig. 4c–d). In this method, the conductive F-doped SnO2 layer with a thickness of ~300 nm served as a seed layer, regulating the growth of SnO2 nanosheets. The thickness of vertically aligned SnO2 nanosheets could only reach a value of ~2 μm after hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 6 h. Upon treatment at longer times, the SnO2 nanosheets became coarse, with the surface covered with small SnO2 nanoparticles as a result of the recrystallization process.4,58

Besides hydrothermal treatment, low-temperature wet chemical synthesis of SnO2 nanoarrays on FTO glass has been reported. Cai et al.59 fabricated SnO2 nanosheet layers with a thickness of ~200 nm on FTO glass by treatment in solutions containing SnCl2·2H2O and urea at 90 °C for 8 h. Shinde et al.34 prepared highly ordered SnO2 nanowalls on FTO substrates at low temperature (70 °C) by treatment of FTO glass in ethanol solution containing tin(IV) chloride and thioacetamide.
SnO2 nanosheet arrays have also been grown on other substrates, such as macroporous nickel foam, and carbon-based nanomaterials including graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their texture structures in the form of paper or foam. Zhao et al.30 fabricated SnO2 nanosheet arrays on 3D macroporous nickel foam by a hydrothermal method using SnCl2·2H2O as the tin source and NH4F as the morphology-controlling agent. The upright SnO2 nanosheets without stacking or pronounced agglomeration were highly interconnected, forming an open, highly porous structure. Ding et al.33 demonstrated the hydrothermal growth of SnO2 nanosheet arrays on a graphene oxide support which can be subsequently reduced to graphene. It was revealed that mercaptoacetic acid played an important role in the formation of sheet-like structures, acting as an efficient linker molecule between the SnO2 nanosheets and the graphene oxide substrate.
2.3. 3D SnO2 nanoarrays
Contrary to numerous existing reports on 1D or 2D SnO2 nanoarrays, the literature on the fabrication of 3D SnO2 nanoarrays deposited on substrates is limited. As hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are usually produced in powder form, their controlled deposition on substrates is still a challenge. Wang et al.36 reported the direct synthesis of SnO2 microspheres on FTO substrates with pre-planted SnO2 seeds via hydrothermal treatment utilizing SnCl4, NH4F and acetylacetone as reactants. Chang et al.35 reported the hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2 nanoflower arrays on ITO glass, where polyvinylpyrrolidone played an important role in the formation of flower-like structures by preventing the constituting units from aggregation through steric hindrance. Wang et al.38 demonstrated the direct growth of SnO2 bilayer nanostructures on FTO substrates, comprising a bottom layer of SnO2 nanosheet arrays and an upper layer of hierarchical SnO2 nanoflowers, via hydrothermal treatment of a solution of SnCl2 and NaF (Fig. 4d). For the growth of 3D SnO2 nanoarrays with a hollow interior, hard templates such as polymer and silica are often adopted.6 Kim et al.35 fabricated arrays of SnO2 hemispheres via sputtering SnO2 thin films onto poly(methyl methacrylate) colloidal templates on alumina or silicon substrates, followed by the calcination process removing the organic template. The closely packed arrays of hollow SnO2 hemispheres (“egg shells”) remained intact after subsequent calcination, which can be repeated to produce multi-layered structures (Fig. 5).

3. Properties and applications of SnO2 nanoarrays
3.1. Lithium storage
SnO2 has been regarded as one of the most promising anode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of its much higher theoretical specific storage capacity (782 mA h g−1) than that of graphite (372 mA h g−1) in commercial LIBs.6,60 The electrochemical mechanism of lithium storage for SnO2 can be described by eqn (1) and (2). SnO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2O(1) Sn + xLi+ + xe− → LixSn(0 ≤ x ≤ 4.4)(2)
As illustrated in eqn (1), SnO2 electrodes typically undergo an irreversible reduction process, forming metallic Sn in the first discharge process, which results in the lower initial Coulombic efficiency. Eqn (2) describes the reversible alloying–dealloying process, which is the intrinsic driving force for the electrochemical activity of LIB anodes. One Sn atom can take up a maximum of 4.4 lithium atoms, resulting in volume expansion up to 300%, while the dealloying process results in large volume shrinkage. This volume change in the repeating discharge–charge processes causes drastic pulverization problems, resulting in severe internal strain, cracking and blocking of the electrical contact pathways in the electrodes, which leads to rapid deterioration and low retention of their lithium storage capacity. To overcome this issue, SnO2 nanoarrays on flexible conductive substrates are emerging to be promising candidates as anodes for LIBs. On one hand, the spacing between the building blocks of the nanoarrays is expected to provide protective structural buffer against the volume change. On the other hand, the direct electron pathways as well as the robust electric contact between the anode materials and substrates can ensure fast electron transfer from the electrochemically active sites to the current collectors, thus improving the rate performance of LIBs. Moreover, SnO2 nanoarrays on flexible conductive substrates can be directly used as electrodes, without the use of any additives such as carbon black, which can simplify the fabrication process (Fig. 6a). Table 2 summarizes the reported SnO2 nanoarrays in terms of their morphologies and electrochemical properties.

The electrochemical properties of SnO2 nanoarrays are largely determined by their morphologies and dimensions. In particular, 1D SnO2 nanoarrays on conductive substrates are expected to have superior lithium storage properties due to their short diffusion length, strain relaxation and fast electron transport. Liu et al.18 demonstrated how the electrochemical behavior of such arrays critically depends on their structural parameters, such as the diameter, aspect ratio and density of the constituting nanorods. The nanorods with an average diameter of 60 nm and a length of 670 nm showed good performance as LIB anodes with regard to their capacity retention (580 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%) and rate capability (stable at 350 mA h g−1 at 5 C). Chen et al.17 reported superior rate performance (720 mA h g−1 at 10 C after 20 cycles) for the aligned mesocrystalline SnO2 nanorod arrays on Ti foil; however, the measured capacity at 10 C decreased quickly after 20 cycles and dropped to ~15 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.
Ko et al.24 studied the electrochemical properties of single-crystalline SnO2 nanowire arrays on stainless steel (Fig. 6b–f), which delivered a discharge capacity of 510 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 782 mA g−1 in the voltage window of 0–1.2 V and displayed superior rate capabilities with rechargeable discharge capacities of 600 mA h g−1 at 3 C, 530 mA h g−1 at 5 C, and 440 mA h g−1 at 10 C. The FESEM and TEM observations on the SnO2 nanowire electrodes after cycling helped to reveal the origin of the improved cycle stability and especially the superior rate capabilities (Fig. 6c–e). The 1D nanostructures are able to effectively accommodate mechanical strain and maintain their morphology after discharge–charge processes, providing a continuous electrical pathway and preventing particle pulverization and the electrical isolation of active parts. Fig. 6e shows that crystalline Sn nanograins with a diameter of less than 10 nm were distributed into an amorphous matrix (most probably electrochemically inactive Li2O), which is capable of reducing the mechanical strain during charge–discharge cycling.
Arrays of SnO2 nanotubes on conductive substrates with hollow inner structure and high surface-to-volume ratio are also promising for application in LIBs. Wang et al.26 studied the lithium storage ability of SnO2 nanotube arrays on a titanium substrate, which delivered a capacity of 790 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles (between 5 mV and 2.0 V at 200 mA g−1). Zeng et al.61 reported that SnO2/α-Fe2O3 nanotube arrays on stainless steel showed a discharge capacity of 0.727 mA h cm−2 (~965 mA h g−1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7). Their improved electrochemical performance was attributed to a synergistic effect between SnO2 and α-Fe2O3. The alloying and dealloying of the Sn component occur at a lower potential as compared to the electrochemical reaction of α-Fe2O3 with Li. Therefore, when SnO2 nanoparticles are electrochemically active, Fe2O3 nanoparticles are almost inactive and can function as a buffering matrix to alleviate the strain and stress during the alloying and dealloying process as well as prevent Sn aggregation. Moreover, the transition metal Fe produced by the conversion reaction has a catalytic function to promote the backward reaction of eqn (1)viaeqn (3), which can be responsible for the observed larger Coulombic efficiency. α-Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 2Fe + 3Li2O(3)

To enhance the cycling performance of 1D SnO2 nanoarrays, carbon-based nanomaterials such as CNTs and graphene were introduced, both to buffer volume changes and to improve the electrode conductivity. Han et al.21 demonstrated that SnO2 nanorod arrays on graphene nanosheets (GNSs) showed improved cycling performance (1107 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V) and good rate performance, with a reversible capacity of 583.3 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 (~2.56 C). The high performance was attributed to synergistic effects of GNSs and SnO2 nanorods, where the direct growth of SnO2 nanorods on GNSs can reduce stacking of the latter, providing more reaction sites and facilitating the rapid diffusion of electrons. Kim et al.22 showed that SnO2 nanorod arrays on elastic graphite particles maintained a capacity of ~500 mA h g−1 after 25 cycles at a current density of 72 mA g−1 in the voltage window of 0.01–1.5 V. Both the vertically aligned 1D SnO2 nanorods and elastic graphite can effectively accommodate strain energy when SnO2 nanorods and graphite reacted with Li+.
2D SnO2 nanosheet arrays used as anode materials for LIBs also offer advantages in terms of overcoming the pulverization problem, due to their structural flexibility originating from their highly porous 2D structure.62 In general, SnO2 nanosheet powders have the tendency to form stacked lamellar or spherical structures during charge/discharge processes, which decreases the accessible interface area and finally the lithium storage capacity. The employment of SnO2 nanosheet arrays on conductive substrates can overcome this drawback. Zhao et al.30 reported that SnO2 nanosheet arrays on 3D macroporous nickel foam exhibited a discharge capacity of 674.9 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C after 50 cycles (capacity retention: 77%), which was better than that of SnO2 microspheres. Their improved cycling performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the ultrathin nanosheet array structure and the macroporous nickel foam support. Zhang et al.57 demonstrated that interconnected SnO2 nanosheets grown on various conductive substrates have a lot of potential for application in LIBs. The double-layer SnO2 nanosheet arrays on Ti foil exhibited more than twice the capacity of the single-layer SnO2 nanosheet arrays (260 μA h cm−1vs. 111 μA h cm−1 in the 30th cycle), while the capacity calculated based on the weight of the SnO2 nanosheets was almost the same (500–550 mA h g−1).
3.2. Photo-electron conversion in dye-sensitized solar cells
SnO2 is among several wide-bandgap metal oxides which were considered as anode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). SnO2 has a large bulk bandgap of 3.6 eV and a high electron mobility of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, greatly exceeding that of porous anatase TiO2 (<1 cm2 V−1 s−1).6 In addition, its lower conduction band edge allows for electron transfer from both organic dye sensitizers and narrow-bandgap inorganic quantum dots.
Photoanodes consisting of wide-bandgap metal oxides should be firmly anchored on conductive and transparent substrates, allowing for maximum propagation of light.63 The most widely adopted transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates are fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) films on glass. Therefore, SnO2 nanoarrays grown on such substrates can be directly used for dye sensitization in DSSCs.39 Especially single-crystalline 1D SnO2 nanoarrays vertically grown on TCO substrates provide direct pathways for photogenerated electrons and increase the electron diffusion length, which can inhibit recombination inside the cells and improve their power conversion efficiency. The arrays can also be designed for superior light-scattering effects, allowing for improved light utilization. On their drawback side, SnO2-based DSSCs often suffer from poor adsorption of dyes with acidic anchoring groups, and low open-circuit voltage for the iodide/triiodide redox couple (~0.45 V).64 This can be improved by surface modification of SnO2 arrays such as introducing a thin layer of other oxide materials.65 In this respect, Guo et al.19 reported a power conversion efficiency of only 0.4% for DSSCs based on aligned SnO2 nanorod arrays grown on Ti foil, while Gubbala et al.39 compared the performance of pristine SnO2 nanowires and SnO2 nanowires coated with a layer of TiO2 nanoparticles. It was revealed that SnO2 nanowires coated with TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited an improved Voc of 0.72 V and an efficiency of 4.1% compared to 2.1% attained with pristine SnO2 nanowires. Krishnamoorthy et al.66 fabricated a vertically aligned SnO2 nanowire film by a multi-nozzle electrospinning method (Fig. 8a–b), which was subsequently adhered onto FTO glass pre-coated with a SnO2 nanoparticle layer under slight pressure induced by a glass slide. DSSCs based on these SnO2 nanowire arrays exhibited an efficiency of 2.5% (Fig. 8c–d).

2D SnO2 nanoarrays, such as SnO2 nanowalls, have also been used in DSSCs because of their high specific surface area. Shinde et al.34 reported a power conversion efficiency of 1% for pristine SnO2 nanowall arrays on FTO substrates, while after TiCl4 treatment leading to their surface modification with rutile-TiO2 nanoparticles, the efficiency reached 4.12%. In spite of the small thickness (3.2 μm), the measured Jsc reached a value of 14.0 mA cm−2, indicating that such nanoarrays can transport electrons rapidly with suppressed recombination. Even though the reported efficiencies for all these SnO2 nanoarrays in DSSCs are still low as compared with those for the widely adopted TiO2 nanoparticle films (>9.0%),67 modification of SnO2 with a TiO2 coating can boost the efficiency due to their suitable bandgap alignment, facilitating the ready injection and separation of the photogenerated electrons. For comparison, a conversion efficiency of only 3% could be achieved by using 4 μm long TiO2 nanorod films on FTO glass after TiCl4 treatment,68 implying the potential of SnO2 nanoarrays for application as high-performance photoanodes in DSSCs and other photoelectrochemical applications.
4. Conclusions
In this Highlight article, we considered different fabrication strategies of SnO2 nanoarrays on various substrates such as stainless steel, Si/SiO2, ITO/ITO glass, Ti/Cu/Fe–Co–Ni alloy/Ni foil, and graphene sheets/graphite paper, combined with their morphology engineering, in terms of the dimensionality, size and shape of the constituting building blocks. The methods to grow SnO2 nanoarrays include chemical vapor deposition and wet-chemical methods, which can be combined with the use of templates such as AAO membranes and ZnO nanorod arrays. As photoanode materials for sensitized solar cells, SnO2 nanoarrays on FTO glass showed enhanced photo-electron conversion efficiency after modification with TiO2 thin layers, originating from the combined advantages of high surface area for light absorbers, light scattering effects for increased light utilization, and improved electron transport properties resulting from the vertical alignments of SnO2 nanoarrays on TCO substrates. The conversion efficiencies of bare SnO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells are poor, but due to their higher electron mobility and more negative conduction band minimum compared to TiO2, SnO2 nanoarrays could in principle facilitate efficient charge transfer from low-bandgap sensitizers with near-infrared light absorption such as semiconductor nanocrystals (PbS, PbSe, and CuInSe2), which can be synergistically combined with enhanced light harvesting by utilizing long-wavelength photons. In energy storage applications as anode materials for LIBs, SnO2 nanoarrays with well-defined morphologies grown on flexible and conductive substrates have demonstrated improved lithium storage properties, due to multiple benefits such as (i) strain relaxation and better accommodation of large volume changes originating from the open frame structure of SnO2 nanoarrays and nano-size dimensions of their building blocks, (ii) efficient charge transport due to the vertically aligned building blocks of nanoarrays and (iii) capability to be directly used as active electrodes without any conductive additives and cohesive polymer binders. However, the poor long-term cycle stability and large initial irreversible capacity losses should be addressed in further research. Even though significant progress has been made towards the design and synthesis of SnO2 nanoarrays with desired shape, crystallinity and composition by controlling the nucleation and growth processes using specific synthetic protocols, their properties are still far from being suitable for practical applications. We hope that this article stimulates further development of functional SnO2 nanoarrays as well as the advancement of their applications to meet current and future energy-related demands.
