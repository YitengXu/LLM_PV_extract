    , Accepted 21st September 2011First published on 17th October 2011AbstractWe report an unexpected improvement in the microstructural and electrical properties of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an active layer in field-effect transistors (FETs) by introducing soft insulating chains from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a cover layer in a solvent mode-dependent manner. A joint experimental and theoretical spectroscopic and electrical analysis is provided to study the P3HT/PMMA bilayer films with semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating interlocked interdiffusion microstructures. Absorption and Raman studies reveal that disordered P3HT chains in films cast from a low-boiling point (bp) solvent favor reorganization into more ordered structures during PMMA covering, thus enhancing the electrical and switch behaviors of FETs. Although high-bp solvents initially create highly crystalline P3HT films, the films are significantly destroyed after the deposition of the PMMA layer, thus dramatically degrading FET characteristics. The semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating microstructures in the designed bilayer films indicate the possibility of ameliorating field-effects in polymer FETs, especially in subthreshold swing and switch on–off behaviors.
1. Introduction

Conjugated polymer-based electronics and other photonics hold the promise of flexible electronics, light emitting diodes, solar cells, inexpensive integrated circuits, and so on.1,2Conjugated polymers possess unique intrachain and interchain charge transport properties and have superior mechanical and thermal stabilities. Efforts have also focused on improving the structural quality of polymer films by modifying their molecular parameters and processing conditions, thereby improving their charge transport and electrical properties,2,3 particularly for field-effect transistors (FETs). FET devices are the basic elements of many electronic products and have higher charge transport requirements. In the last decade, the material structure-dependent charge transport and electrical properties of polymer FETs have been the focus of interdisciplinary research at the fundamental and practical level.1–4
As an active layer of FETs, polymeric materials can be easily deposited through solution processes. The type of organic solvent used to deposit polymer thin-films will affect the orientation of the chains and thin-film morphology as well as the electrical properties of the corresponding optoelectronic devices.5–9 Researchers have suggested that slow polymer film formation from high boiling point (bp) solvents with a slower evaporation rate generally facilitates the growth of a highly crystalline film, thereby promoting charge transport.2,5 In addition to the solvent-induced orientation of polymer chains, other factors such as defects could also affect the performance of polymer devices.7–9 Since polymer films form from a solution, defects arise when polymer chains aggregate or when there is a high free volume hole such as a vacancy among the polymer chains. We have shown the impact of residual solvents and vacancies within the polymer active layer on the electrical characteristics of polymer-based FETs, especially the electrical hysteresis phenomena.10 Most conjugated polymers are also very sensitive to ambient air, e.g., moisture and oxygen, and suffer from unintentional doping from impurities, which makes them easy to degrade, causes electrical instabilities, and significantly reduces device lifetime.7,8,11 In addition to optimizing the structural properties of conjugated polymers for electronics and photonics, reducing the impact of these extrinsic factors on the structural and electrical properties of conjugated polymers is highly important in expanding their potential applications. The formation of the covering and/or passivation layer upon the device's polymer active layer may provide a solution to the addressed problem.12 However, the nature of polymer films, i.e., the considerable amount of free volume and easily damaged feature, poses challenges in fabricating suitable passivation layers on top of conjugated polymers. Polymer blends or composites (i.e., introducing insulating polymers or inorganic nano-materials into semiconducting polymers), as an alternative, may provide solutions in improving the above-mentioned issues, because they have the opportunity to combine the advantages of both materials.13–15 Nevertheless, there are still many unknown factors affecting charge transport and electrical properties, and these factors have yet to be fully studied because of the complicated structural properties arising from kaleidoscopic chain conformations.
In the study, polymer bilayer films with semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating microstructures were prepared by spin-coating a semiconducting regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and then covering it with an insulating polymer layer [poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer]. The effects of a solution-processed polymer cover layer on the semi-interpenetrating microstructures and corresponding electrical properties of P3HT-based FETs were investigated. The semi-interpenetrating bilayer films, which showed significantly different structural properties as the active layer in FETs, were prepared from different solvent modes. The unexpected effect of the semi-interpenetrating bilayer microstructures on the electrical properties of FETs is reported in this paper. We discuss these observations by directly monitoring the conformational change in the P3HT chains induced by their interaction with PMMA within active channels using the spectroscopic approach.
2. Experimental
2.1 
          Preparation methods
        
In order to investigate the microstructural changes of polymer active layers leading to different electrical behaviour, these polymer films with and without semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating microstructures were prepared in the active channel of the FET devices. This study employed the standard inverted-coplanar FET structure with silicon dioxide (SiO2) as the gate insulator, and indium-tin-oxide as the gate, source, and drain electrodes, as described elsewhere,16 and called FET substrate. The active layer material P3HT (average molecular weight = 87000 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity = 98.5%, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as received) was dissolved in diverse solvents. Several kinds of solvents with high solubility for P3HT and with quite different bps were used, including chloroform (61 °C), toluene (110 °C), p-xylene (139 °C), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, 213 °C), to prepare the P3HT films. All the P3HT films were spin-coated (30 s at 2000 rpm) from a 0.34 wt% solution and then baked at 120 °C for 2 h. Next, the PMMA (molecular weight = 540000 g mol−1) layer was spin-coated (30 s at 5000 rpm) on top of the P3HT film from a 5 wt% p-xylene solution and then baked at 150 °C for 2 h to give a final bilayer film. For comparison purpose, the following supplemental experiments were also carried out: (i) P3HT:PMMA blending films with various PMMA weight fractions were spin-coated from a 0.34 wt% p-xylene solution and then baked at 120 °C for 2 h; (ii) P3HT films were spin-coated (30 s at 2000 rpm) from a 0.085 wt% chloroform solution; (iii) P3HT films were spin-coated (30 s at 500 rpm) from a 0.34 wt% p-xylene solution; and (iv) the covering layer materials including poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVnP) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) were dissolved in deionized water and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form 15 and 1 wt% solutions, respectively. Then, these insulating polymer materials were spin-coated on the prefabricated P3HT films and followed by baking at 150 °C for 2 h. The thicknesses of these polymer films were determined by an alpha-step (Tencor Instruments, Alpha-step IQ).
2.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum was obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer with an 18 kW rotating-anode X-ray generator (Cu Kα radiation, λKα1 = 1.5406 Å) in the symmetric reflection coupled θ–2θ arrangement. The data were collected with a step size of 0.01° with a scanning rate of 1° min−1. A Si single-crystal (111) wafer was used to estimate the effect of the instrumental broadening in XRD experiments. The absorption spectra were recorded using a GBC Cintra 202 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer resolution was below 0.9 nm. At least three absorption spectra were recorded on each sample. The Raman spectra were obtained using a Jobin Yvon/Labram HRU1000 micro-Raman spectrometer. A 633 nm He–Ne laser and a 532 nm solid state laser served as the excitation light source and were kept below 0.5 mW to prevent thermal damage of the polymer film. The spectrometer resolutions are within 0.2 cm−1 and 0.4 cm−1 for 633 nm and 532 nm excitation sources, respectively. Every Raman spectrum was taken an average of five spectra and at least three spectra were measured for each sample. The electrical characteristics of the FETs were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer in a dark nitrogen-filled glove box to avoid the influence of oxygen and moisture.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Initial microstructural properties

Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of the P3HT films. For all samples, a (100) peak at ca. 5.37 ± 0.07° 2θ was observed, which confirmed that the polymer backbones self-organize into a lamellar supramolecular structure.17 The (100) peak corresponds to an interlamellar packing distance, i.e., lattice constant a, of 16.44 ± 0.21 Å. We observed that the full width at half maximum (B) of the (100) diffraction peak reduced as the bp of the solvents increased, and tended to have a more symmetrical shape. The B corresponds to a Debye–Scherrer dimension of coherently scattering crystal domains. The crystallite domain size along the a-axis (La) was roughly estimated by using the Scherrer equation described as follows:18 (1)where K is the Scherrer constant (taken as 0.90), λ is the wavelength of X-ray, and θ is the diffraction angle of the peak. The mean La within the P3HT films deposited from chloroform, toluene, p-xylene, and TCB were 11.82, 13.60, 13.82, and 21.14 nm, respectively. It should be noted that the microstrain broadening effect was ignored, thus the calculated crystallite size is minimum. For the TCB sample, the strongest (100) intensity and visible (200) reflection were observed, suggesting a larger density of crystallites within the films compared to that of other specimens. When thin-films are deposited from high bp solvents, the polymer chains have sufficient time to self-assemble and form a thermodynamically favored structure resulting in an ordered orientation of polymer chains.

Fig. 2 presents the absorption spectra of P3HT in solutions and thin-films prepared from various solvents. In the solutions, the P3HT in chloroform, toluene, and p-xylene solutions showed similar absorption profiles and an absorption peak maximum (λmax) at ca. 2.74 eV. In contrast, the P3HT in the TCB solution was red shifted by 0.13 to 2.61 eV, suggesting that the P3HT chains had more extensive conjugation.19 The P3HT films showed a λmax at ca. 2.21–2.38 eV, which was 0.36–0.53 eV red shifted compared to that in the solutions, and can be attributed to a well-ordered structure and long conjugation length in the spin-coating film.20,21 Recent experimental observations and theoretical considerations22,23 have suggested that the measured absorption for energies lower than 2.3 eV is due to the crystalline domain. According to theoretical prediction of a weakly interacting H-aggregate model,21 the absorption from crystalline regions of P3HT can be fitted and the corresponding magnitude of the exciton bandwidth (W) can be estimated through a modified Frank Condon analysis:21,23 (2)where A is the relative absorption intensity, m is the vibrational level, S is the Huang–Rhys factor (assumed to be 1),22,23EP is the energy of the main vibrational mode of P3HT coupled with the electronic transition, Gm is a constant equal to Σn(≠m)Sn/n!(n − m) (n is the vibrational quantum number), Γ is a Gaussian function, ω is the vibrational frequency, and E0–0 is the energy of the 0–0 electronic transition. After running simulations, we could obtain the data of W and half-width (β) for a microcrystalline domain as shown in Table 1 (for comparison purposes, the simulation curves are shown in Fig. 4). Next, the interchain excitonic coupling J can be obtained by W (W = 4J for free exciton bandwidth).21 With the J values, the effective conjugation length (Leff) in terms of the number of repeat units in various P3HT films can be estimated further according to theoretical calculations.22,24–26 By extrapolating the results obtained from Gierschner et al.24 for infinite one-dimensional (1D) stacks under screened and unscreened intermolecular potentials, the resulting average Leff (Table 1) was found to be larger than those of the parallel polythiophene chain dimer model based on the Barford model25 and rough Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (ZINDO) calculations.26 For all cases, the films prepared from high bp solvents exhibited longer Leff than those from low bp solvents. Moreover, the smaller β of the crystalline bands indicated a homogeneous distribution of Leff and thus a higher quality of microcrystalline domain.

The microcrystalline domain size within the films could be drawn with the help of XRD and absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The observed Leff values can be assumed to be the crystallite size along the long axis direction or the c-axis. Here, we adopt the Leff values that were obtained based on the infinite 1D stack model with unscreened intermolecular potential due to the increasing importance of non-nearest neighbors long-range interactions with growing polymer size.24 As the bp of the solvents increased, a considerable increase in microcrystal size was observed. When chloroform was used as the solvent, the crystalline P3HT appeared to have the smallest microcrystal size. A red edge broadening (tail state) was also observed in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2), which suggests the formation of aggregated states of entangled polymer chains.27 Chang et al. have shown that the spin-coated P3HT film from chloroform has some isolated clusters from polymer aggregates.5 In contrast, the films prepared by high bp solvents exhibit sharper threshold behavior in the absorption spectra, thus suggesting fewer defect states in the optical band gap.

3.2 Microstructural properties of the bilayer films
Our aim was to prepare bilayer films with a semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating interlocked microstructure; thus, p-xylene was used as the solvent for spin-coating PMMA onto the P3HT. Based on the solubility parameter (δ) and the Flory–Huggins parameter (0.37),28p-xylene (δ of 18.2 MPa1/2)29 is a good solvent for P3HT (δ of 13.1 MPa1/2).30Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the absorption spectra of the P3HT films prepared from various solutions before and after the deposition of PMMA layers. The simulated curves obtained viaeqn (2) are also shown. The observed values of W, Leff, and β of the crystalline bands are listed in Table 1. After subtracting the theoretical spectra from the experimental spectra, the residual curves could be assumed to be contributed mainly by the chains with short Leff in the amorphous portion because the curves were similar to those of the solution states (see Fig. 2). The absorption spectra showed very low intensities for the films made from high bp solvents, such as toluene, p-xylene, and TCB, after being covered with PMMA from the p-xylene solution. Compared with the simulated spectrum, most of the P3HT chains were washed out, particularly those in the amorphous region. From Table 1, the significantly decreased Leff and increased β for the crystalline bands of the bilayer films indicate that the microcrystalline domain was also destroyed, leading to a smaller size with inhomogeneous distribution. In contrast, when the P3HT films were made from chloroform and after being covered with the PMMA layer, the most striking features in their absorption spectra were the almost unchanged Leff, a significantly reduced β of the crystalline bands, and a well-defined absorption threshold behavior. These indicate that film homogeneity was improved and the aggregates seemed to have disappeared. Moreover, the degree of absorption intensity reduction of the specimen was the smallest compared to that of other specimens.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of absorption spectra of various P3HT films before (closed circles) and after (open circles) being covered with a PMMA layer: (a) chloroform; (b) toluene; (c) p-xylene; and (d) TCB. The solid lines represent the theoretical simulation using eqn (2), whereas the dashed lines represent the residual curve between the experimental and theoretical curves. Note: to obtain better comparisons, the scales in the curves of P3HT/PMMA bilayer films are enlarged five times. 
The unusual observable microstructural modifications of the chloroform specimens could be confirmed further through Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 5). We focused on the vibrational modes coupled to the electronic transitions at 1350–1500 cm−1, which are the symmetric Cα–Cβ stretching deformations of the aromatic thiophene ring, particularly for the band at ca. 1448 cm−1 (assigned to the v1 band). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that increasing the Leff causes the v1 band to downshift and follow an exponential decay law.31 Compared with the uncovered films, the v1 band of the chloroform specimens with PMMA shows a red-shift to 1446.2 cm−1 by 0.8 cm−1; in contrast, the p-xylene specimens show a blue-shift to 1448.0 cm−1 by 0.9 cm−1. The red- and blue-shifts of the v1 band indicate an increase and decrease in the Leff, respectively. The resulting downshift of the v1 band suggests a considerable microstructural improvement in the disorder–order interphase regions for the chloroform specimens because we used a 532 nm excitation line with the energy located at the amorphous/crystalline crossover regime. However, for the p-xylene specimens (as well as for the toluene and TCB cases), the residual peak moved toward the high frequency range, which indicated a significant distortion in P3HT chains after PMMA covering. The improved microstructural characteristics in the chloroform specimens could be confirmed further using the difference spectrum method. In Fig. 5c and d, for the chloroform specimens after covering PMMA (trace D2), the relative intensity of the lower frequency part (longer Leff) was increased, whereas the higher frequency part (shorter Leff) was decreased compared with the high bp solvent specimens. The present results show that the microstructure of the chloroform specimens with PMMA is much better than that of the p-xylene case (as well as for the toluene case; however, data are not shown) and better than that of the TCB case. The observations above are in very good agreement with the results of absorption spectra analyses.

The thin lines represent the best fit with a Gaussian/Lorentzian function, whereas the dots represent experimental data. The thick lines denote the difference spectra (Trace 3) between the film before and after addition of a PMMA layer. Difference spectra (c) and (d) are obtained by subtracting p-xylene and TCB, respectively, from chloroform specimens. Traces (D1) and (D2) are the difference between the specimens before and after being covered with PMMA, respectively. Note: the best-fit spectra are used to obtain the difference spectra. 
Summarizing the results of the structural studies, the microstructural evolutions of films from the P3HT monolayer to the P3HT/PMMA bilayer are illustrated in Fig. 6. For the chloroform case, being covered with a PMMA layer resulted in superior microstructures with improved intrachain ordering, that is, enhanced Leff, especially in the crystalline/amorphous interphase region. On the other hand, the Leff within the crystalline structure could not be destroyed significantly despite the fact that a large number of P3HT chains were washed out by p-xylene during the PMMA coating. During the coating, some PMMA chains would have the chance to penetrate the P3HT films and produce the dilute effect, the so-called interdiffusion process,32–34 thus leading to a semi-interpenetrating interfacial microstructure. In contrast, for the films made from high bp solvent cases, most of the P3HT chains in the crystalline and amorphous regions were washed out. After covering with a PMMA layer, no diffraction peaks in the XRD spectra were detected (Fig. 6), indicating that most of the microcrystallites were destroyed. Note that the initial P3HT films, which were made from high bp solvents, showed a bigger microcrystalline size and were free from aggregates. Thus, the presence of aggregates in the chloroform specimens may protect the film against damage and/or excess washing out during PMMA deposition from p-xylene solution. In support of this supposition, the (100) diffraction peak can still be detected, as shown in Fig. 6 (lower left panel). In addition, the chloroform specimens showed better microstructural features than the p-xylene specimens after spin-coating pure p-xylene solvent on the P3HT films (see Fig. S1 of ESI†). Therefore, aggregates are essential against the P3HT chains washed out by the solvent.

Previously, several studies have demonstrated the complexity of the interdiffusion process of polymers, particularly for larger species, into an entangled polymer matrix.33 It has been suggested that the interdiffusion process is often governed by the degree of its entanglements. Following the ideal, the presence of entangled aggregates in the chloroform specimens would increase the time for PMMA penetration. The viewpoint can be verified by changing the tempering conditions of the PMMA layer in preparing the bilayer films. Greater thermal energy at higher temperature apparently promotes efficient interdiffusion; thus, a high-degree mixing between PMMA and P3HT occurs in the p-xylene specimens that were free of aggregates (Fig. S2a of ESI†). In contrast, for the chloroform specimens with considerable entangled aggregates, the observed Leff and β values for the crystalline absorption bands of the bilayer films prepared at different tempering temperatures were almost the same (Fig. S2b of ESI†). That means that the presence of entangled aggregates slows down the interdiffusion process.
In addition, we prepared chloroform specimens with fewer aggregates using low concentration solutions (i.e., 0.085 wt%). Under the same spinning rate (2000 rpm), the absorption spectrum was almost identical to that of the p-xylene films (Fig. S3 of ESI†). After covering the PMMA layer, the films were seriously damaged, implying the importance of aggregates. In contrast, a bigger microcrystalline size within the P3HT films could not play an important role in PMMA covering and interdiffusion. The thickness effect is also another concern. Low spinning rates allow us to increase the thickness of the P3HT films. For example, using a spinning rate of 500 rpm to prepare the P3HT films from the p-xylene solution (0.34 wt%), the thickness of the films can increase to ca. 55–60 nm compared to a spinning rate of 2000 rpm (ca. 40 nm). After covering the PMMA layer, the structure of the films was still seriously damaged (see ESI, Fig. S3†). At a constant concentration, the structure of the P3HT films becomes less sensitive to the spinning rate. Consequently, the results suggest that thickness may not be a dominant factor during PMMA coating.
3.3 Electrical properties of FETs
By measuring the electrical properties of the corresponding FET devices, the long-range connection between the conducting P3HT chains within the films could be explored. We first focus on a sharp contrast between the electrical characteristics of the P3HT-based FETs made by chloroform (called C-FETs) and by p-xylene (called X-FETs) before and after covering the PMMA layer (Fig. 7). Initially, the X-FETs displayed larger output on-current (IDSon) and higher saturated field-effect mobilities (μsat of 1.0–2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1) than the C-FETs (μsat of 3.0–5.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1). The μsat values obtained for the present devices were consistent with results from previous studies based on a similar device structure.13,35,36 After covering the X-FETs with the PMMA layer (Fig. 7, lower panel), a significant decrease in both IDSon and μsat (down to below 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1) was observed.
 Fig. 7  Typical (a) output and (b) transfer curves of P3HT-based FETs before (closed symbols) and after (open symbols) being covered with PMMA. FET devices with different channel width-to-length (W/L) ratios: (□) 740; (△, ○) 175. Applied gate voltage (VG) and drain voltage (VD) are shown, respectively. The thin lines in (b) represent the subthreshold swing (ss). For comparison, the transfer curves of FETs (W/L ratio of 175) using P3HT/PMMA blends with different weight ratios as the active layer are also shown. 
The devices exhibited a very low off-current (IDSoff) level associated with sharper subthreshold swing (ss, below 4 V per dec.) behavior and a considerable threshold voltage (Vth) shift (>25 V). This suggests that covering with the PMMA layer changes the conductivity of the films made by p-xylene, thereby enhancing gate-to-channel controllability. Conjugated polymers are widely known to suffer from unintentional doping which contributes to the conductivity of the polymer film.7,11 Moreover, it has been suggested that commercial P3HT (98% regioregularity) from Aldrich Chemical Co. contains residual synthetic impurities, i.e., zinc and bromine.37 Obtaining higher μsat values is always associated with large IDSoff; inferior subthreshold behaviors in polymer FETs are also common. It is difficult to increase both μsat and IDSon while decreasing IDSoff and ss. However, in the C-FETs with the PMMA layer, the results were unexpected in that an enlarged output current (over a 100% increase; Fig. 7a) and enhanced μsat were observed (up to above 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1), whereas IDSoff and ss were still decreased. Furthermore, the IDSoff, ss, and on/off ratio parameters could be improved further in the linear region (small drain bias, VD).
For the toluene and TCB cases, similar results were also observed as in the p-xylene case. After covering P3HT with the PMMA layer, the output current of the devices was largely decreased (Fig. 8). A significant decrease in the field-effect mobility was also observed. In FETs, the charge mobility is the result of long-range charge transportation. From the results of structural studies for the corresponding films, most of the P3HT chains with short Leff were washed out, thereby allowing some insulating and soft PMMA chains to penetrate into the vacancies between the P3HT chains and cause poor connections between the chains (Fig. 6, right panel). This provides a good reason for the inferiority of mobility properties and a marked decrease in the conductivity of the corresponding devices. Due to a relatively very low absorbance of the bilayer films (below 10% of the initial films), we believe that PMMA permeating through the active channel region (near the gate dielectric interface) is possible, thus altering the field-effect characteristics as the change in Vth and ss. This point can be verified by preparing the P3HT/PMMA blend FETs. The Vth, ss, and IDSoff levels (Fig. 7b, lower panel) could be modulated according to the different blending ratios. With the amount of PMMA increasing to a 1:9 weight ratio of P3HT and PMMA, the ss gradually reduced to below 1.5 V per dec. Moreover, the Vth increased to above −35 V and the motilities gradually decreased to below 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1.

The observed changes in the electrical properties of P3HT-based FETs in the presence of PMMA can be interpreted satisfactorily by the microstructural results. For the chloroform case, the increased output current and μsat of the bilayer film FETs can be attributed to better homogeneity of chain conformations in the crystalline portion and improved intrachain ordering in the crystalline/amorphous interphase region of P3HT. Moreover, the reduced β for the vibronic absorption component (Table 1) also suggested a low value of the reorganization energy, thus benefiting efficient charge transport.38 DFT calculations indicated the reduced hole reorganization energy of polythiophene with increasing Leff.26 The electrical data also indicated that long-range connection between P3HT chains could be maintained. The decreased IDSoff and sharper ss support the amorphous PMMA chains interdiffusing into the underlying P3HT active channel region, thereby suppressing the influence of the unintentional doping effect. This indicates that the leakage pathway and/or unintentional doping could be blocked by insulating PMMA chains. The phenomena also stand for the high bp cases because PMMA chains could disrupt the long-range connection between conducting P3HT chains, thereby lowering output current and charge mobility.
The field effect mobility of the present P3HT-based FETs is not quite high enough because the bottom-contact, bottom-gate configuration with SiO2 gate dielectric suffers from access contact resistance and a poor semiconductor/insulator interface.1,7 Nevertheless, the testing FET substrate is very durable, transparent, and suitable for studying the complicated microstructural-dependent electrical characteristics of the FETs using the spectroscopic approach.31,16 Thus, we demonstrated that P3HT/PMMA bilayer films with semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating microstructure could lead to an improved electrical performance in FETs, especially the switch on–off behaviour. In addition to microstructural improvements, an appropriate amount of insulating PMMA chains penetrating into the P3HT active channel could suppress the leakage pathway as well as make a good impression on the dedoping effect. In general, using poor or insoluble solvent modes for the lower layer and for deposition of the upper layer is preferable in achieving polymeric bilayer films with sharp interface.26,39 The same was performed in this study, including PVnP (δ of 32.3 MPa1/2) from an aqueous solution (δ of 48.0 MPa1/2) or PVDF (δ of 23.2 MPa1/2) from DMF (δ of 24.3 MPa1/2), which were spin-coated onto P3HT to produce bilayer films with sharp interfaces free of interdifussion. No considerable structural and electrical improvements with respect to these systems were observed (see ESI, Fig. S4 and S5†). Consequently, the advantage of the abovementioned functions of PMMA from p-xylene solutions could be stressed. Furthermore, we found that it is also useful to reduce the leakage pathway in P3HT/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells by introducing a small amount of insulating PMMA chains, leading to higher fill factor and power conversion efficiency, and the results will be published elsewhere. Recently, blending insulating polymers, such as polystyrene and polyethylene, into semiconducting P3HT improves the environmental stability of the P3HT semiconductor and other devices, because insulating polymers may act as excellent encapsulating materials.13,14
4. Conclusions
The use of p-xylene solvent, which is a good solvent of P3HT, to prepare the PMMA upper layer allowed us to prepare semi-interpenetrating semiconducting/insulating bilayer films with quite different microstructural and electrical properties according to the initial P3HT films. Although highly structured P3HT films with a low level of aggregates could be prepared from high bp solvents, these films are destroyed during PMMA covering. Thus, the bilayer films display inferior charge mobility and very low output current in FETs, but subthreshold characteristics become sharper. In contrast, a bad microstructure with some aggregates and inferior electrical properties of the P3HT films, which are made by low-bp chloroform, could both be improved after PMMA coating. Using the spectroscopic approach to monitor the films directly, we demonstrated that a suitable quantity of soft insulating PMMA chains penetrating into P3HT films could be useful in achieving bilayer films with improved microstructural quality. Such bilayer films applied to FET devices provide several benefits, including higher charge mobility, enhanced gate-to-channel control ability, suppressed unintentional doping effect, as well as excellent switch on–off function better than those of the P3HT single layer film. Thus, the bilayer film-based transistors can also be used as switch devices.
