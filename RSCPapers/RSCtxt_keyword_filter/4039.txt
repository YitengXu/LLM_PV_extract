    , Accepted 22nd December 2016First published on 23rd December 2016AbstractTwo new planar and symmetrical A–D–A (electron acceptor–electron donor–electron acceptor) small molecules based on a commercial cyclopentadithiophene derivative have been synthesized for solution processed small molecule organic solar cells. The aim was to synthesise the molecules to be energetically identical (similar HOMO–LUMO energy levels) in order to assign the differences observed to changes in the film morphology or to differences in the interfacial recombination kinetics or both. Devices were electrically characterized under one sun simulated (1.5 AM G) conditions by determining current–voltage curves, light harvesting efficiencies and external quantum efficiencies. Moreover, time-resolved photo-induced techniques such as photo-induced charge extraction and photo-induced transient photo-voltage were also performed. The results demonstrate that, despite having the same core, i.e. cyclopentadithiophene, the use of one hexyl chain instead of two in the organic molecule leads to a greater control of the molecular ordering using solvent vapour annealing techniques and also to better solar cell efficiency.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are included within the so-called third generation devices, which aim for high-efficiency low-cost solar cells. OPVs have attracted the attention of a myriad of scientific groups in recent years due to the progressive and steady improvements in the solar cell efficiency,1–6 which means that OPVs have great potential to be industrially produced and commercialized.
Polymer-based OPVs have provided power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10% on using single junctions7,8 and 11% with multi-junctions9–11 and comparable performance has been achieved with solution-processed small molecule organic solar cells (smOSCs),12–15 with efficiencies of 10% obtained. The advantages of smOSCs over polymers are mainly associated with the reproducibility of fabrication protocols and the high structural versatility, which allows fine-tuning of the chemical structures16–24 and therefore the possibility of studying the relationships between the molecular structure and the final device performance.25–32 Moreover, as studied previously in smOSC systems, π-conjugated oligomers with combinations of different electron-rich (donor) and electron-poor (acceptor) subunits result in molecules with outstanding performance for OPVs. Strong charge transfer properties have been demonstrated for these D–A combinations along with wide absorption ranges (from the UV-Visible to near-infrared region), small energy gaps and good charge carrier mobilities.6,16,33 In particular, symmetrical acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) systems have shown some of the highest PCEs reported to date in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs.12–14,34
Our research group has previously reported two linear A–D–A small molecules based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and thiophene linked by vinylic groups as the backbone and dicyanovinylene (DCV) or 3-ethylrhodanine as the end-capping groups. These compounds are denoted as smL0135 and smL0632 (Fig. 1) and both show excellent open circuit voltage and current, with PCEs of 3.7% and 4.9% achieved, respectively.32,36

In the work described here we aimed to move one step further and use a new commercial cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) derivative in a process that can be easily scaled-up to a kilogram scale for OPV production. The CPDT organic core has attracted great interest due to the semiconducting and unique electronic properties provided by the fused rings, and the rigid and planar structure. In addition, the more extended conjugation length in this system allows greater electron delocalization as well as a wider absorption range and a lower energy gap. Moreover, easier π–π* intermolecular charge transport is observed in many CPDT derivatives.37–40
Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic applications of two new A–D–A systems RD5 and RD6 (Scheme 1). The molecules comprise a central cyclopentadithiophene unit linked through a vinylic group to a thiophene ring, with the thiophene moieties substituted by one (RD6) or two (RD5) hexyl side chains. It is not our aim to predict the solar cell efficiency from the molecular structure of the organic semiconductor but to study in detail the reason for the differences in solar cell efficiency, as shown later in this work.

Synthetic procedures and analytical data

General procedure for the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction. 
In a round-bottomed flask, under an argon atmosphere, the corresponding phosphonate (2 eq.) and the corresponding dialdehyde (1 eq.) were dissolved in dry THF. tBuOK (8 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After complete consumption of the dialdehyde (monitored by TLC), the crude product was extracted with diethyl ether. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, concentrated in vacuo and purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane).

Melting point: 249 °C.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic strategy for the preparation of the two new small molecules is shown in Scheme 1.
Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction between dialdehyde 141 and the corresponding phosphonate 242 or 332 at room temperature, with tBuOK as the base, afforded good yields (82% and 80%, respectively) of the central building blocks 4 and 5.
Double Vilsmeier formylation of 4 and 5 gave the corresponding dialdehydes 6 and 7 after purification by column chromatography (94% and 48% of yield, respectively).
Finally, Knoevenagel reaction with 3-ethylrhodanine under basic conditions (piperidine) afforded rhodanine-based derivatives RD5 and RD6 (72% and 65% yield, respectively) (Scheme 1).
All new compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C-NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopy and by MALDI-TOF MS. The data were consistent with the expected structures. For characterization data, see the ESI.†
It should be noted that the formation of the new vinylic proton directly linked to the acceptor group was evidenced by the singlet at around δ ≈ 7.80 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra and the trans character of the double bonds was also confirmed (3J = 15.6 Hz).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were carried out in order to investigate the stability and the thermal behavior of the new molecules over a wide temperature range. TGA was performed from 40 °C to 580 °C under a N2 atmosphere and both molecules displayed excellent thermal stability up to 370 °C (Fig. S25, top, ESI†).
DSC analysis revealed an endothermic peak associated with the melting point of the molecules at 232 °C (RD5) and 249 °C (RD6) when the samples were heated under a N2 atmosphere. The higher melting point of RD6 indicates stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Furthermore, RD5 and RD6 showed an exothermic peak upon cooling at 210 °C and 194 °C, respectively, and this is ascribed to a crystallization process (Fig. S25, bottom, ESI†). These observations provide evidence for the ready crystallization of both molecules.
Optical properties
The absorption characteristics of oligomers RD5 and RD6 were investigated by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The absorption spectra obtained in dilute dichloromethane solutions are shown in Fig. 2 and the significant optical properties are summarized in Table 1.

The A–D–A compounds RD5 and RD6 exhibit a broad absorption profile without a vibronic fine structure, with absorption maxima at λmax = 643 nm and 634 nm, respectively. These absorptions are ascribed to a charge transfer transition between the electron-rich inner part of the molecule (thiophene-based central building block) and the electron-deficient peripheral part (rhodanine-based acceptor groups). Both sensitizers displayed absorption in the UV-Vis-NIR region up to 740 nm, which covers a wide range of the solar spectrum (≈400–700 nm).
In thin films both dyes display a visible red-shift and broader absorption spectra when compared to their respective absorptions in solution (Fig. 2), thus indicating the formation of J-aggregates. It is also noteworthy that RD5 and RD6 films show a distinct band and shoulder at 718 nm and 704 nm, respectively.
Finally, taking these absorbance variations into account, the optical gaps for the thin films, as determined from the absorption onsets, were both ∼1.5 eV, which is around 0.2 eV lower than those for the solution spectra.
Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Osteryoung square wave voltammetry (OSWV) measurements were carried out in ODCB/ACN/Bu4NClO4 using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as an internal reference in order to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of RD5 and RD6. The data were transformed into frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels vs. vacuum and compared to the optical gap calculated from the absorption spectra, with good agreement obtained between both sets of results (Table 1).

RD5 and RD6 displayed (in the oxidation window) two reversible oxidation waves at 0.21 V and 0.22 V, respectively (Fig. S26, ESI†). These oxidation processes are associated with the thiophene-based central building block of the molecules. A reduction wave at around −1.5 V corresponding to the electron-deficient rhodanine-based acceptor groups was also observed.
The HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy levels and the energy gap were calculated from the first oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO energies are very similar in both small molecules and this indicates that the hexyl side chains linked to the thiophene rings have a negligible influence. The LUMO levels are also very similar since LUMO energies are largely dominated by the electron-deficient end groups. Taking into account the energetic properties, the relatively low-lying LUMO levels should not be disadvantageous as the remaining offset, relative to the LUMO level of PC61BM and PC71BM acceptor materials (−3.91 eV),44 still constitutes a sufficient driving force for charge carrier separation at the D–A interface,45 thus enabling the use of the new small molecules as donor materials in BHJ OPVs.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31G* level in vacuo; Gaussian 09W) were performed in order to gain additional insights into the theoretical electronic features. Virtually planar conformations were revealed for the optimized ground-state geometries of RD5 and RD6 (Fig. S27, ESI†).
The electronic distribution of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels was also calculated by quantum chemical calculations and the HOMO levels were mainly distributed on the central-donor building block, while the LUMO levels were delocalized along the molecules (Fig. S28, ESI†). Theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy values and energy gaps support the trends found in the electrochemical studies. RD5 and RD6 exhibit moderate frontier energy levels that are appropriately aligned with PC71BM.
Photovoltaic performance
Devices with RD5 and RD6 were fabricated using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/RDx/PC71BM/Al configuration with an active layer of approximately 100 nm, as described in detail in the ESI.† Both systems were optimized by varying the weight ratio between the donor (RD5 or RD6) and the acceptor (PC71BM and PC61BM), the active layer thickness and the solvent vapor annealing (SVA)46 time. The latter technique was employed in order to rearrange the D/A domains to a preferred morphology. The RD5 and RD6 devices were characterized by J–V measurements and the main performance parameters, for optimized annealed and non-annealed devices, are shown in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 2.

The RD6 and RD5 optimized devices gave efficiency values of 3.72% and 2.77%, respectively. All devices presented very high VOC values. Taking into account the energy levels, the theoretical VOC can be calculated as the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor and a voltage loss of exactly 0.57 V was calculated in both cases. Both devices present similar VOC values and, moreover, as they have almost equal energy levels, this experimental result suggests that the energy losses related to recombination and the kinetics are very similar for RD5 and RD6. This hypothesis will be discussed in greater detail later in this article. Regarding the photocurrent of the devices, a similar Jsc was observed for both RD5 and RD6 in non-annealed cells and this is in good agreement with the absorption spectra (Fig. 2), which are very similar for both films.
As a complementary approach to the absorption study, Light Harvesting Efficiency (LHE) values were also measured in RD:PC71BM films obtained using different SVA treatments (Fig. 4). In both cases (using RD5 or RD6) annealed films gave higher LHE values and a red-shift when compared to their respective non-annealed films. This result is consistent with better self-organization of both molecules and appropriate molecular stacking (end-to-end) between the molecular backbones, which translates to more delocalization of the generated charges and an enhancement of the hole hopping.47–50 The main difference between the two small molecules, RD5 and RD6, is that RD6 in all cases shows higher LHEs; moreover, for RD5 a marked change in the shape of the spectra was observed after longer SVA exposure times (longer than 2 minutes), which indicates a change in the size of the molecular domains.

In RD6 films, the SVA did not affect the domains as dramatically as in RD5 and the domain size started to change after six minutes of solvent annealing. The obvious increase in the Jsc after SVA, which was more marked for RD6, is due to differences in the molecular reorganization and this is determined by the morphological changes in the film and the individual mobilities of the molecules. For both non-annealed samples, the FF values are very poor and they increase significantly after SVA (from 0.3 to 0.5). This change is a clear indication of an improvement in the self-aggregation of the donor moiety and the balance between electron and hole mobilities within the photoactive film.
The measured EQE (Fig. 5, left axis) shows broad spectra across the UV-Visible region. The annealed RD6 device gave the highest EQE (38%) for two different peaks at 480 nm and 640 nm, followed by annealed RD5 with an absolute maximum at 480 nm of 29% photon to electron conversion efficiency. The integration of the EQE against the 1.5 AM G sun spectra gave a good correlation with the measured photocurrent in all cases (Fig. 5, right axis), with the RD6 annealed film morphology being the most suitable.

The hole mobility was calculated using the Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC)51 method (Fig. S29, ESI†). The calculated hole mobility values were 1.6 × 10−4 and 6.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for RD5 and RD6, respectively.
The hole mobility values are also consistent with those reported in our previous publications32 and RD6 has a lower mobility by orders of magnitude when compared to RD5, a finding that is probably due to the absence of one of the pendant alkyl chains. It was determined that the hole mobility alone is not a limitation for the performance of RD6-based solar cells as these devices can reach higher efficiencies than RD5-based devices.
In order to investigate further the differences between devices based on RD5 and RD6, PICE (Photo Induced Charge Extraction) and PIT-PV (Photo-Induced Transient PhotoVoltage) experiments were also performed with the aim of determining the differences in charge distribution and recombination dynamics.
The charge distribution of the four devices is presented in Fig. 6 and, in all cases, there is evidence that the geometric capacitance governs the performance of the devices at low light intensities, represented as a line, and in all cases the value is around 50 nF cm−2.

This behavior is common in thin devices where the metal electrodes are in close proximity and, thus, an internal electric field is generated, which is considered to be the major driving force at low light intensities.
Nevertheless, close to 1 Sun conditions the devices are capable of storing charges at the photoactive layer. Moreover, the measured charge is similar in both devices, which is expected given that the quasi Fermi levels may be similar for both types of solar cells as the small molecules were synthesized to have similar HOMO–LUMO energies. In fact, the carrier lifetimes (Fig. 7) are also quite similar (within experimental error).

All devices showed very similar charge lifetimes under 1 Sun conditions (τ = 1–2 μs) as well as similar interfacial carrier recombination kinetics. Thus, the possibility that carrier recombination is the process responsible for the differences between the different solar cells made with RD5 and RD6 can be ruled out.
We proceeded to study the film nanomorphology.52,53 AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) images54 of non-annealed and annealed devices of RD5 and RD6 films are shown in Fig. 8.

Both molecules, as cast, present a similar domain distribution whereas at different SVA times one can observe that RD5 devices show a dramatic increase in molecular aggregates compared to RD6. This result indicates the higher capability of RD6, due to the absence of one hexyl chain, to self-organize in a better mixed nanomorphology, with small domains that help charge transport and collection to the contacts.
Bearing in mind the results discussed above, it is clear that the main limitation is the final morphology and the formation of the correct domain size for the different RD/PC71BM blends. The difference between the two J–V curves, i.e. for non-annealed and annealed samples, is more pronounced for RD6 devices and this is consistent with greater film reorganization.
Conclusions
In summary, we report the synthesis and full characterization of small molecules RD5 and RD6, which have an A–D–A structure, based on a CPDT central moiety and a donor, namely thiophenes substituted with one or two alkyl chains as a bridge, and rhodanine as an electron acceptor group.
These molecules are very interesting due to the position of their energy levels as both RDs have almost equal HOMO and LUMO energy levels and identical bandgaps – a characteristic that allows us to rule out differences in energetics as the factor that leads to different device performance between both molecules. Complete devices were fabricated and efficiencies of 2.8% and 3.7% were obtained for RD5 and RD6, respectively. Annealed and non-annealed devices with RD5 and RD6 were directly compared. The VOC values under 1 Sun simulated conditions were similar in all cases and the values are consistent with the energetics. Similar VOC leakages related to recombination processes were also obtained. The LHE values were also measured and a red-shift was observed as the SVA time increased, which indicates reorganization of the molecular packing in both cases. This reorganization was more pronounced for RD5, where a change in the shape of the spectra was also observed. This change is related to the larger molecular self-domains. RD6 gave a higher LHE than RD5. The EQE measurements showed a broader range of incident-photon to current efficiencies, with the highest conversion achieved at 480 nm and 640 nm (almost 40%) for the RD6 annealed device. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE matched perfectly with the experimental Jsc from the J–V characterization. The hole mobility values for the two molecules were also measured using the SCLC method and values of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for RD5 and 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for RD6 were obtained. It was determined that the hole mobility properties did not represent a limiting factor to improve the performance of the devices as the lowest mobility corresponded to the highest efficiency obtained. PICE and PIT-PV studies were also performed and very similar charge densities were obtained for the four devices (RD5 and RD6 annealed and non-annealed), which again is consistent with the measured energetics. Moreover, in all cases a higher geometric capacitance contribution appeared at low light intensities and only close to 1 Sun conditions can the charges be stored at the photoactive layer. The PIT-PV measurements appeared to be very similar in all cases and this finding is also in agreement with the experimental VOC and the energetic distribution. Finally, a study of the film nanomorphology by AFM shows significant differences between RD5 and RD6 photoactive films after SVA treatment.
All the results described above led us to conclude that the main difference between the two materials is the effect of the number of hexyl chains in the thiophene bridge. The absence of one chain in RD6 favored a better film nanomorphology due to better mixing, which in turn led to smaller domains that favored better charge balance transport and collection to the contacts.
