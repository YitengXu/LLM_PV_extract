    , Accepted 13th March 2016First published on 14th March 2016AbstractThe properties of methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells with poly(3-thiophene acetic acid) (P3TAA) as a hole transporting material (HTM) and a dense layer of ZnO nanoparticle film as an electron transporting material (ETM) are described using the conventional ZnO (n)/perovskite (i)/P3TAA (p) (n–i–p) architecture. The FT-IR spectra of a MAPbI3/P3TAA mixture indicate a shift of the N–H stretching and the abolition of the N–H bending peak indicating the interaction between the components. UV-Vis spectra of the mixture exhibit a large red shift of the π–π* transition peak of the conjugated chain arising from the interaction causing an increase of the conjugation length. The cross-sectional SEM image of the device shows the sequence of the individual layers of ZnO, MAPbI3, P3TAA and Ag, respectively. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves obtained upon illumination with a light of 100 mW cm−2 indicate the average PCE to be 7.38 ± 0.59% under ambient conditions. The IPCE values of these cells reach about 63% across a broad range of wavelength (300–800 nm). The HOMO and the LUMO of P3TAA are measured using cyclic voltammetry and the optical band gap and the relative energy level of the components explain the operation of photocurrent in the cell. For comparison purposes a device using poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) as the HTM is fabricated under similar conditions and it exhibits a lower PCE (5.85 ± 0.51%) than that of the P3TAA based device. The longevity of the P3TAA based cell is also found to be better than that of the P3HT based cell for storing in air. The UV-Vis and impedance spectral results clearly explain the above results, signifying the influence of the interface on the performance of hybrid solar cells.
Introduction
Recently organolead halide perovskites of the general formula ABX3 (A = CH3NH3, B = Pb and X = Cl, Br or I) have attracted significant attention as excellent materials for solar energy conversion in the field of organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells. The initial report by Miyasaka and co-workers in 20091 demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼4%. The exceptional optical and electronic properties of perovskites, for instance strong absorption bands that span over the whole visible region2,3 and large charge carrier diffusion lengths,4–6 make them ideal light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Presently, the organolead halide based perovskite solar cell devices have improved the PCE from the initial ∼4% to certified efficiencies of ∼20%.1,7–9 Amongst the perovskite materials produced from methyl ammonium iodide and lead iodide, MAPbI3 has attracted significant attention because of the ease of preparation, easy solution processability, cost effectiveness and high efficiency.8 The architecture of perovskite solar cells consists of an electron transfer material (ETM, n)/perovskites, a light absorbing material, which is also an intrinsic semiconductor (i)/hole transfer material (HTM, p) with n–i–p or the inverted p–i–n configuration. The efficiency of the cell depends on a suitable choice of each component, the morphology of the material and on the interface between the layers.10,11
Generally perovskite solar cells based on a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold as the ETM, a MAPbI3 light-absorption layer and a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTM have achieved PCEs of ∼15.0%,12 and several other reports suggest that solar cells with efficiencies of up to 20% can be achieved by fabricating under controlled conditions in a glove box.13,14 The TiO2 perovskite solar cells require a high temperature processing technique, which is not compatible for industrial scale production. Hence, high performance perovskite solar cells fabricated at low temperature are of special interest for the realistic application.15 Fullerene derivatives or other unstable organic materials as the ETM are quite expensive whereas stable inexpensive ZnO compact layers can be prepared easily by spin coating of ZnO nanoparticles at room temperature without heat treatment steps.16 The development of ZnO nanoparticles as the ETM for MAPbI3-based solar cells has achieved a PCE as high as 15.7% produced under controlled conditions inside the glove box.17
In perovskite solar cells, the use of spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM has been extensively studied as it can infiltrate through the porous perovskite layer and afford a better contact for charge transportation.17–19 Alternatively several less costly conducting polymers such as PEDOT:PSS,20 poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),21,22 poly(triarylamine),23 and graphene-based materials,24,25 as well as some small molecules such as perylene-diimide derivatives,26 pyrene-core arylamine derivatives,27 diacetylide-triphenylamine28 and inorganic material CuI29 have been used as the HTM in perovskite-based solar cells. Amongst the conducting polymer family, polythiophene is a good p-type semiconductor for its high crystallinity, charge mobility, conductivity and relative air stability and hence it has been widely studied for use as the HTM in perovskite solar cells. In an inverted p–i–n device, ITO/polythiophene/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Ag, where polythiophene is produced from electrochemical polymerization, a maximum PCE of 11.8% is reported.30 Photovoltaic devices fabricated through the sequential vapor deposition of lead iodide and MAPbI3 with undoped P3HT as a hole transporting layer exhibit a PCE of 13.7%.11 In a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2Cl/P3HT cell a maximum of 10.8% PCE was reported by Conings et al.31 In all these cases the fabrication of the devices have been made under stringent dry conditions in the glove box. Recently Namboothiry and co-workers have fabricated a cell with TiO2 as the ETM, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as a light absorbing material and P3HT as the HTM under ambient atmospheric conditions and they have reported a maximum efficiency of 5.67%.22 In another TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2Br/P3HT cell produced under ambient conditions the best PCE is reported to be 6.64%32 indicating the fabrication conditions to have significant effects on the PCE of the cell.
The interface between different layers of the perovskite solar cell may have large effects on the PCE and in an attempt here we chose an acid derivative of polythiophene e.g. poly(3-thiophene acetic acid) (P3TAA) where the –COOH groups have a possibility to interact with perovskites through their NH3 group, which may provide a good mixing at the interface facilitating easy transfer of holes. In this article, a solution processed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with MAPbI3 as the light absorbing material, P3TAA as the HTM and a dense layer of ZnO nanoparticle film as the ETM is described using the conventional ZnO (n)/perovskite (i)/P3TAA HTM (p) (n–i–p) architecture. Here we have established that P3TAA can be efficiently used as a HTM that can enhance the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite-based solar cell and we have achieved an average PCE of 7.38%, a maximum reported efficiency so far, using polythiophene systems as the HTM under ambient atmospheric conditions with a satisfactory longevity for storing under ambient conditions. In order to establish the interfacial effect on the PCE of perovskite solar cells we have fabricated another solar cell using poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) as the HTM under identical conditions and a comparison of the results indicates that both the PCE and longevity of the P3TAA cell are higher than those of P3HT based solar cells. Probable explanation of the above results has been attempted through the analysis of impedance spectroscopic data.
Experimental
Preparation of poly(3-thiophene acetic acid) (P3TAA)
3-Thiophene acetic acid (3-TAA) was esterified with dry methanol by refluxing in the presence of concentrated H2SO4 (0.05 ml) for 24 h to protect the oxidative decomposition of the carboxylic acid group during polymerization. It was then polymerized using anhydrous FeCl3 in dry chloroform. The molar ratio of FeCl3 and the monomer is 4:1 and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 0 °C under a N2 atmosphere.33 The polymer was precipitated into a large excess of methanol to produce poly(3-thiophene methyl acetate) (P3TMA). The precipitate was washed with methanol followed by deionized water. Then P3TMA was hydrolyzed by refluxing with 2 M NaOH solution for 24 h at 100 °C. The water-soluble part was then neutralized with dilute HCl and the precipitate was repeatedly washed with water and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 3 days. Each step was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). The regioregularity of P3TAA was measured from the 1H NMR spectra presented in Fig. S1(b) (ESI†). The peak at 7.28 ppm is for the α proton of H–H linkages and the peak at 7.35 is for the α proton of H–T linkages of thiophene rings.33 From the ratio of peak area the % H–T linkage was calculated to be 42.3 mol%. The structures of P3TMA and P3TAA were confirmed by 1H NMR spectra. [P3TMA (Fig. S1a, ESI†), (DMSO-d6) δ 7.35–7.28 ppm (m, thiophene ring proton, 1H), 3.68 ppm (s, thiophene ring –CH2–, 2H), 3.64 ppm (s, –CH3, 3H); P3TAA (Fig. S1b, ESI†), (DMSO-d6) δ 12.59 ppm (s, –COOH, 1H), 7.35–7.28 ppm (m, thiophene ring proton, 1H), 3.80 ppm (s, thiophene ring –CH2–, 2H)]. P3HT is synthesized from the monomer 3-hexylthiophene using the same procedure of polymerization described above. After 24 h of polymerization, the reaction mixtures were poured into methanol containing 10% HCl. The precipitate was re-dissolved in CHCl3, and the filtrate was dried at 60 °C in air and finally in a vacuum. The regioregularity of P3HT was measured from the 1H NMR spectra presented in Fig. S1(c) (ESI†) in a similar way to the above and the head–tail regioregularity was measured to be 81 mol%. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was estimated from gel-permeation chromatography. It was performed on a Waters instrument equipped with an ultra-styragel column with polystyrene standard as a reference using THF as an eluent at 35 °C at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1. Mw and polydispersity were found to be 1.1 × 104 and 1.83 for the P3TAA and 5.6 × 104 and 2.3 for P3HT, respectively.
Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles
ZnO nanoparticles were prepared according to a procedure reported in the literature.34,35 Zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g, 13.4 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (125 ml) with stirring at 65 °C. A solution of KOH (1.48 g, 23 mmol) in methanol (65 ml) was then added dropwise at 60–65 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at 65 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was then washed three times with methanol, dispersed in a methanol and chloroform mixture (1:1 v/v) to produce a ZnO nanoparticle solution with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1.
Preparation of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI)
The perovskite sensitizer methyl ammonium iodide was prepared according to a reported procedure.36 An equimolar mixture of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and methylamine (40% in water, Spectrochem) was stirred in an ice bath for 2 hours. After stirring at 0 °C for 2 hours, the resulting solution was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and MAI was obtained. The precipitate was washed three times with diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum under dark conditions.
Solar cell fabrication
Solar cells were fabricated on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1. First, a thin ZnO nanoparticle layer was spin coated onto the ITO surface at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The procedure was repeated two times to obtain a continuous smooth film. A PbI2 solution (dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide at a concentration of 460 mg ml−1) was then spin coated on the top of the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After a short baking process at 90 °C for 20 minutes in air, the substrate was dipped into a solution of MAI in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 30 s. The film was then annealed at 70 °C in air for 15 min. On the top of the perovskite layer the hole transporting layer of P3TAA/P3HT was produced by spin coating from their respective solution in THF (15 mg ml−1) at 1500 rpm for 1 min. Finally, a silver layer was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. All device fabrication steps were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature without encapsulation.
Device characterization
The current–voltage (I–V) curves of solar cell devices were measured under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2401 source meter. The cells were illuminated using a 150 W Xe-lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport, 67005) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as determined by a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). The effective area of the cell was defined to be 0.4 cm2 using a non-reflective mask. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured using a Newport 66902 150 Watt Xe-lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measure unit controlled by Visual Basic software. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements were performed under 0.92 V DC bias and 10 mV voltage perturbation conditions using a Solartron SI1260 Impedance/Gain-phase analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
Material characterization
The 1H NMR spectra of the samples were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a 500 MHz Bruker instrument. The X-ray diffraction data are recorded on a Philips X'Pert PRO diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The data were collected with a 0.05 step size (2θ). Morphology and microstructural images were acquired using a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS EVO-MA 10). The FTIR spectra of the samples were taken using a Shimadzu FTIR instrument (model 8400S). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis-spectrophotometer (Cary 8454, Agilent Technologies). The photoluminescence spectra of the solid films cast on quartz plates were recorded on a Fluoromax-3 instrument (Horiva Jovin Yvon). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using an electrochemical station (CHI6002E) in a three-electrode cell configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl quasi reference electrode with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard during the measurement at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. P3TAA was dissolved in THF and cast on the working electrode area followed by coating with Nafion. The measurements were carried out with 0.1 mol l−1 tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte in dry acetonitrile. All working solutions were thoroughly degassed with oxygen-free nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained above the solution throughout the experiments.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PbI2 (top panel) and that of perovskites (bottom panel) on an ITO surface. The bottom panel XRD pattern of MAPbI3 corresponds to 2θ signals at 14.1°, 24.5°, 28.4°, 40.5°, 43.1°, and 50.2°, respectively, representing the (110), (202), (220), (314), and (404) diffraction planes of its tetragonal phase.37,38 This XRD pattern does not show any peak of PbI2 (top panel) suggesting the complete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 under the device preparation procedure.

In Fig. 2 the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of MAPbI3, P3TAA and the MAPbI3/P3TAA mixture in the ratio used for cell fabrication are presented. In MAPbI3 the characteristic peaks occur for N–H stretching vibration at 3088 cm−1, C–H stretching vibration at 2920 cm−1, N–H bending at 1571 cm−1, and 1463 and 1419 cm−1 are for C–H bending vibration.39,40 P3TAA shows characteristics peaks at 1705 cm−1 for > CO, 2922 cm−1 for C–H stretching, and 1168 for C–O stretching vibration.33 In the MAPbI3/P3TAA mixture the N–H stretching peak at 3088 cm−1 has shifted to 3126 cm−1 and the N–H bending at 1571 cm−1 is almost abolished, indicating the interaction between P3TAA and the NH3 group of MAPbI3 perovskites. Due to the use of a very dilute concentration of P3TAA its characteristic vibration peaks are not prominent in the FTIR spectra of the mixture. These results therefore indicate the presence of the interaction between the perovskite and P3TAA, which may cause a diffuse interface between the components.

In Fig. 3a the UV-Vis spectra at the solid state of P3TAA, MAPbI3, and MAPbI3/P3TAA collected in a similar way to the device fabrication are compared. P3TAA shows a strong absorption peak at 453 nm with a hump at 559 nm and a broad absorption peak at 800 nm. The peak at 453 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugate chain and the hump at 559 nm corresponds to the vibronic side chain band.41 The broad absorption peak at 800 nm may appear for the vibronic coupling due to inter chain aggregation occurring at the solid state of the conjugated main chain. The perovskite shows two characteristic weak absorption peaks at 492 and 747 nm. However, in the perovskite/P3TAA hybrid the π–π* transition of the conjugated polythiophene chain at 453 nm has shifted to 546 nm with a shift of the hump from 559 nm to 612 nm. The broad peak at 800 nm becomes sharper and it shifts to 911 nm. This spectral shift of P3TAA to the lower energy region certainly indicates the interaction between the perovskite and P3TAA causing the P3TAA chain to be more extended increasing its conjugation lengths. This would certainly facilitate an easy movement of charge carriers (holes) inside the cell.

To understand the state of P3HT in the P3HT/MAPbI3 system the UV-Vis spectra of P3HT and P3HT/MAPbI3 are presented in Fig. 3b. P3HT shows an absorption peak at 554 nm and a hump at 601 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of the conjugate chain and the vibronic side chain band, respectively. In the hybrid these bands exhibit red shifts of 6 and 9 nm, respectively, which are significantly lower than those of the perovskite/P3TAA hybrid system. This result indicates that the P3HT chain remains at a more coiled state than that of the P3TAA chain in the perovskite system. In other words, it may be surmised that the interface is sharper in the P3HT/MAPbI3 system than that of the perovskite/P3TAA hybrid system.
In Fig. 4(a) the surface SEM image of MAPbI3 film is presented. The surface image shows the formation of packed crystallites of MAPbI3. A schematic representation of the ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA/Ag device structure is presented in Fig. 4(b) and the cross sectional image of the perovskite based device is shown in Fig. 4(c). From Fig. 4(c) it is apparent that the bottom layer is for ITO and the immediate upper layers sequentially indicate that of ZnO, perovskite, P3TAA and Ag electrodes. The cross sectional SEM image of the device shows the thickness of the individual layers of ZnO, MAPbI3, P3TAA and Ag that are measured to be 222, 228, 70 and 105 nm, respectively.

Fig. 5(a) exhibits the J–V curves of ZnO/perovskite/P3TAA solar cells for the forward scan (from short circuit to forward bias) and the reverse scan along with that under dark conditions for comparison purposes. It is apparent from the figure that compared to the dark current there is a large increase in current upon illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 both under the forward and reverse bias conditions. The short circuit current (Jsc) has increased to 12.57 mA cm−2 in the forward scan, however, in the reverse scan it increases to 12.73 mA cm−2. This sharp increase of Jsc under the illumination conditions certainly indicates good performance of these inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells indicating that ZnO acts as a good ETM, and P3TAA as a good HTM in the MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell produced under ambient conditions (temperature 32 °C and humidity 62%). It is noteworthy that in the reverse scan there is some hysteresis, which may cause an increase in the fill factor (FF) and hence the PCE. In Table 1 the photovoltaic parameters (e.g. Jsc, FF, open circuit Voc and PCE) both for forward scan and reverse scan are presented taking a mean from eight cells with their standard deviations for both the forward and reverse bias. The average value of efficiency is found to be 7.38 ± 0.59%, which is higher than that of other perovskite solar cells produced under ambient conditions using P3HT as the HTM.22,32 We have also fabricated a device using P3HT as the HTM instead of P3TAA under similar conditions to that in P3TAA for comparison purposes and the PCE is found to be 5.85 ± 0.51% (Fig. 5b). All the Jsc, Voc and FF values (Table 1) are found to be lower in the P3HT based cell than those of the P3TAA based cell causing 1.53% lower efficiency. The PCE value of the present P3HT based solar cell is comparable to the values reported earlier under ambient conditions.22 The probable reason for the large increase in PCE may be the good interaction between the perovskite layer and the P3TAA used as the HTM under ambient conditions. The –COOH groups of P3TAA interact with MAPbI3 through the lone pair of the nitrogen atom of the NH3 group present in it as evident from FTIR spectroscopy. This causes the interface between the perovskite and HTM to become more diffused causing an easy injection of holes to the P3TAA chains for its transport.

The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum (Fig. 6) for the ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA device shows a response in the region from the UV-Visible to near infrared range (300–800 nm). The IPCE values of this cell reach about 63% across a broad range of wavelength, indicating good light-harvesting by the device.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectrum of the ZnO/MAPbI3/HTM based device. 
The IPCE curve of the ZnO/MAPbI3/P3HT hybrid is also shown in the figure for comparison purposes and it is interesting that both P3TAA and P3HT show a response in the same wavelength region but in the former case the IPCE values are higher than that of P3HT supporting the PCE data presented above.
The operation of the device can be understood from the relative energy levels of the each component of the device (Fig. 7). The excitons generated in the MAPbI3 layer can be extracted or dissociated by transferring holes to the P3TAA layer and by transferring electrons to the ZnO layer, attaining high charge transport efficiencies to both the electrodes. Here, the energy levels for the ZnO and perovskite layer are taken from the literature.42,43 The corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels of P3TAA have been calculated from the onset oxidation potential in the cyclic voltammetry experiment and the optical band gap obtained from Tauc's plot to be −4.86 eV and −2.78 eV vs. vacuum, respectively (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of the band energy diagrams for the ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA/Ag device. 
The conduction band of ZnO is located in a closer proximity of the perovskite layer and the HOMO level of P3TAA is well matched for the separation of holes, which facilitates the charge separation process. The band gap offsets between different components facilitating effective electron transport from the conduction band of MAPbI3 to ZnO and then to the ITO electrodes and transport of holes from the valence band of the perovskite films to the P3TAA and then to the Ag electrodes. Since the HOMO level (−4.86 eV) of P3TAA is comparable to the valence band (−5.43 eV) of MAPbI3, it facilitates the hole transfer to the Ag electrode through P3TAA. The relatively high LUMO energy (−2.78 eV) of P3TAA compared with that of the conduction band of MAPbI3 (−3.93 eV) prevents the electron transfer through the perovskite layer to the Ag electrode. This phenomenon suggests that P3TAA can be successfully used as an effective HTM for the MAPbI3 based perovskite solar cell.
The longevity of the cell has been measured by keeping the cell under the ambient air condition without encapsulation and the PCE is measured at different time intervals. In Fig. 8 the normalized PCE is plotted with storage time and after 10 days a 55% value of PCE is retained. The longevity of the P3HT based device made under similar conditions as in P3TAA is lower as evident from Fig. 8 and here after 10 days only 27% value of PCE is retained. This result indicates a fair stability of the P3TAA based cell under ambient atmospheric conditions and it may be attributed to the controlled PbI2 passivation.38 The present system also exhibits much better stability than that of TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD exposed to ambient air without encapsulation showing only 30% PCE after 10 days of storage.44 Better stability of P3TAA based cell than that of the P3HT based cell may be due to mixing of MAPbI3 with P3TAA causing diffuse interface.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a nondestructive powerful technique to elucidate the charge transport process in the solar cells. The Nyquist plot of ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag cells is presented in Fig. 9. From the figure it is apparent that in each case there are two semicircles characterizing the impedance spectra of the cell. The data can be fitted in an equivalent resistance (R)–capacitance (C) circuit shown in Fig. 9 (inset).

The semicircle at the higher frequency region corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (RHTM) at the hole transporting layer and the CHTM is the interfacial capacitance between the electrode (Ag) and HTM.29 The semicircle at the low frequency region corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the ETM (ZnO)/perovskite interface and the CPE yields the chemical capacitance, which is related to the Fermi level of the ETM.29,45,46 An additional resistance (Rs) appears in the equivalent circuit drawn using Z-view software and it may be attributed to the additional contribution of the series resistance. The fitting parameters of EIS data are presented in Table 2. The impedance analysis of the P3TAA based cell yields lower RHTM and higher Rrec values compared to those of P3HT based cells. The lower RHTM value indicates lower resistance experienced by the holes to flow along the HTM material and the higher Rrec value indicates a lower recombination of photo-injected electrons. Thus the combined effects of lower RHTM and higher Rrec values cause higher PCE of the P3TAA than that of P3HT based solar cells. So, this result supports that the diffuse interface between the components of perovskite solar cells yield higher efficiency due to easier transport processes.

To understand the charge recombination and dissociation process in the device, photoluminescence spectra (PL) of individual and mixed layers are presented in Fig. 10. The PL spectra of MAPbI3 show emission peaks at 740 nm and 763 nm for excitation at 490 nm. Upon addition of P3TAA the emission peak at 740 nm is fully quenched but that of 763 nm is slightly quenched and similar reports are also observed in these types of CH3NH3PbI2Br/P3HT systems32 where it is suggested that photo-generated holes are quickly extracted to the P3HT layer before bulk recombination.5 On the other hand, upon addition of ZnO to MAPbI3 the intensity of all the emission peaks of MAPBI3 are totally quenched. This is also true for the ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA hybrid system. The complete quenching of the fluorescence intensity of MAPbI3 by ZnO indicates that ZnO is a very effective ETM for the transfer of photo-generated electrons by dissociation of the hole–electron pair generated from white light illumination on the MAPbI3 system. Hence ZnO is a very effective ETM and P3TAA acts as a good HTM for perovskite solar cell application yielding a moderate average PCE of 7.38 ± 0.59% under ambient conditions.

Conclusion
In conclusion it may be inferred that P3TAA can act as an effective HTM in the conventional ZnO (n)/perovskite (i)/P3TAA (p) (n–i–p) solar cell even produced in air under ambient conditions. The FTIR spectra of the MAPbI3/P3TAA mixture indicate shifts of the N–H stretching peak and the abolition of the N–H bending peak suggesting an interaction between the components. The UV-Vis spectra of the mixture exhibit a large red shift of the π–π* transition peak of the conjugated chain arising from the interaction causing an increase of the conjugation length. These results suggest that the interface between MAPbI3/P3TAA is diffused, which facilitates the hole transfer process. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves obtained upon illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 indicate a hysteresis in the reverse bias than that of the forward bias and the average PCE is measured to be 7.38 ± 0.59%. The IPCE values of this cell reach about 63% across a broad range of wavelength (300–800 nm). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P3TAA are measured from cyclic voltammetry and the optical band gap and the relative energy levels of the components explain the operation of P3TAA as the HTM and ZnO as the ETM. The Nyquist plot of the ITO/ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA/Ag cell shows two semicircles and the recombination resistance is calculated to be 96.8 Ω. From the photoluminescence spectra of individual and mixed layers it is proved that ZnO is a very effective ETM and P3TAA acts as a good HTM for MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite solar cells produced under ambient conditions yielding an average PCE of 7.38 ± 0.59%. We have also fabricated a device using P3HT as the HTM instead of P3TAA under similar conditions for comparison purposes and the PCE is found to be 5.85 ± 0.51%, which is 1.53% lower than that of the P3TAA system. The longevity of the P3TAA based cell is found to be better than that of the P3HT based cell for storing under ambient conditions in air. The UV-Vis and impedance spectral results clearly explain the influence of interface on the PCE value of the hybrid solar cells.
