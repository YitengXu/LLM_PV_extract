    , Accepted 9th September 2015First published on 14th September 2015AbstractPerovskite film generally has rough surface morphology due to the voids between the grain domains. Smoothed interface contact between the perovskite layer and the top electrode is critical for planar perovskite solar cells. We reported high efficiency bromine–iodine based perovskite solar cells with a flattening cathode interface by incorporating a solution-processed bathocuproine (sBCP) interfacial layer at the cathode side. Compared with vacuum evaporated bathocuproine (eBCP), sBCP demonstrated an excellent surface modification effect at the cathode side with very smaller charge transfer resistance. Accordingly, a high fill factor exceeding 85% and a power conversion efficiency exceeding 13% in CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx based perovskite solar cells were achieved. The largely improved fill factor was attributed to the smooth film morphology and full surface coverage of perovskite films modified by the solution-processed BCP layer.
Introduction
Since the expensive manufacturing process of crystalline silicon solar cells, many efforts have been made to develop novel solar cells. Organic solar cells (OSCs) and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are thought to be ideal candidates. Through over 20 years' efforts, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are still ∼10%,1–6 which is far less than the industrial requirement. Recently, a brand new photovoltaic device known as organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has drawn much attention because of its rapid improvement in PCE.7 The amazing performance originated from the superior optical and electrical properties of perovskite materials, such as a direct optical band gap with broad light absorption,8 longer carrier diffusion length,9–11 low exciton binding energy12,13 and higher charge carrier mobilities.14 The pioneering work of employing a perovskite as the light harvest by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009 demonstrated a PCE of 3.8%.8 Two years later, PCE was increased to 6.5% by Park et al.15 Nevertheless, the device showed poor stability due to the dissolution of perovskites in the liquid electrolyte. When a solid-state hole conductor small molecule of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was used as a hole transport layer, both stability and performance were improved dramatically.16 Many techniques have been utilized to improved the device performance, such as introducing new methods for fabricating the perovskite layer,10,17–23 controlling the annealing process,24–29 adding additives into the perovskite precursor,31–33 compositional engineering,34,35 interface engineering31,36–45 and so on. Presently, a certified PCE of above 20% has been approached.30
Noticeably, most high efficiency perovskite solar cells are based on CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites.10,22,26,38,46 Their energy band gaps are not suitable for tandem devices when integrating them with copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) or other kinds of solar cells. Recently, MAPbI3−xBrx-based perovskite solar cells have drawn much attention owing to their variable energy band gaps by adjusting the bromide–iodide ratio.47 Nevertheless, few studies on the MAPbI3−xBrx system based perovskite solar cells were reported. As examples, Seok et al. reported the meso-structured perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 12.3% by utilizing the traditional one-step spin-coating method for MAPbI3−xBrx deposition.47 Huang et al. achieved a PCE of 13.1% in MAPbI3−xBrx-based planar perovskite solar cells by using the two-step spin-coating method with the solvent annealing process.48 In planar structure PSCs, the electrode interfacial layer plays a very important role in the carrier behavior. For example, thermal vapor deposited LiF, bathocuproine (BCP), and fullerene (C60) have been used as the cathode interfacial layers in planar structure PSCs.48–53 Crystalline perovskite films generally has rough surface morphology due to the voids between the crystals. Therefore, the thermal vapor deposited interfacial layer is considered to have no positive effect on the desired smooth interface between the perovskite and the electrode. In this work, we introduced a solution-processed BCP (sBCP) as the cathode interfacial layer in MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells. sBCP demonstrated an excellent surface modification effect with a smoothed interface at the cathode side, which resulted in a high fill factor exceeding 85%, an average fill factor over 81% and a champion PCE exceeding 13% in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(p-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS. Clevious AI 4083) was bought from Heraeus (Germany). [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) was produced by Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd (Taiwan). BCP was provided by Luminescence Technology Crop. (Taiwan). All the other chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar or Sigma–Aldrich and were used as received without further purification. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were synthesized via the reported methods,47 respectively. The MAPbI3 solution of 40 wt% and MAPbBr3 solution of 30 wt% were prepared by mixing PbI2 and PbBr2 powders with MAI and MABr separately with a molar ratio of 1:1. After stoichiometric mixing of the prepared MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 solutions, the desired MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 solution was obtained. The concentration of PC60BM solution was 20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene and BCP solution (0.5mg ml−1) was prepared in anhydrous ethanol. All the precursor solutions were prepared at room temperature with stirring.
Device fabrication
All devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates. After ultraviolet ozone treatment for 15 min, PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 4500 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. Then, the substrates were moved into the glovebox. The MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite layer was fabricated by a fast deposition crystallization procedure and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. After that, PC60BM and BCP were spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm, respectively, without further annealing. Finally, a 100 nm Ag was evaporated using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (0.0725 cm2). To fabricate electron-dominant devices of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PCBM/BCP/Ag, TiO2 was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate at 3000 rpm/40 s then annealed at 150 °C for 2 h. BCP was fabricated either spin-coated at 4000 rpm/30 s without annealed or evaporated in the thermal evaporation system at 3 × 10−6 torr with an evaporation rate of 0.4 Å s−1. The other layers are the same under solar cell fabrication conditions.
Measurements and characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells under 1 Sun illumination were measured in air using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150 V) and verified with an NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The EQE was performed using a certified IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments, Inc., Solar Cell Scan 100). The ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer model Lambda 750 instrument. XRD measurement was conducted using a PANalytical (Empyrean) apparatus. AFM images were obtained to evaluate the surface morphology (Veeco Multimode V instrument). SEM images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 200). Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed using a Wayne Kerr 6550B precision impedance analyzer with a 50 mV perturbation oscillation signal in a frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 MHz.
Results and discussion
MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite films with different bromide concentrations were fabricated by a fast deposition crystallization procedure as previously reported.20Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite films with a varied bromide ratio x. Upon increasing the bromide content in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, the absorption cut-off edge decreased from 800 nm to the shorter wavelength. It indicates that the energy band gap of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 can be changed by the compositional engineering, which agrees well with the reported results.47,48Fig. 1b presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of MAPbI3 and MAPbI2.4Br0.6 on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. The zoom of X-ray diffraction from 26 to 31 degree patterns of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) is depicted in Fig. 1c The main diffraction peaks of MAPbI2.4Br0.6 shift toward higher degrees compared with the MAPbI3 system because the gradual substitution of the larger I atoms by the smaller Br atoms can decrease the lattice spacing at some extent. Noticeably, Seok et al. reported that MAPbI2.4Br0.6-based devices exhibited stable performance compared with other compositions.47 Herein, all the perovskite solar cells were fabricated based on the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 system.

MAPbI2.4Br0.6-based perovskite solar cells employing solution processed BCP (sBCP) as the cathode interfacial layer with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM/sBCP/Ag (Fig. 2a) were fabricated. MAPbI2.4Br0.6-based devices without sBCP were also fabricated for comparison. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 based perovskite solar cells measured under AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2b. Their related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were extrapolated from the slopes of J–V curves under open circuit and short circuit conditions, respectively. The devices with and without the sBCP interfacial layer showed the comparable open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc). Noticeably, the fill factor was strongly dependent on the interfacial condition of the cathode side. With sBCP modification, the fill factor was improved obviously and it approached to 85.2% (Fig. S1, ESI†) in the case of sBCP modification with an optimized concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V curve of the champion device, which exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 13.06%, a Jsc of 18.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V, and a fill factor of 0.80 under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. No obvious hysteresis was observed by changing the scan direction (Fig. S2, ESI†). A batch of 40 devices was fabricated for obtaining the average performance. The average PCE (PCEAVE) for the reference device (without (w/o) sBCP) and the controlled device (with sBCP (0.5 mg ml−1)) was 10.64% and 12.39%, respectively (Fig. 3b). A 16.4% improvement in PCEAVE is obtained by an optimized sBCP interfacial modification. Fig. 3c shows the J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells without sBCP and incorporating sBCP (0.5 mg ml−1) under dark conditions. The leakage current density of the controlled device is almost one order of magnitude smaller than that in the reference device. By inserting the sBCP interfacial layer, the reverse dark current was lowered obviously compared with that in the reference device. The leakage current, which is usually originates from the bad interfacial contact near the active layer,54,55 can reflect the interface condition at some extent. The lowered dark current suggests a better interfacial modification by sBCP. Fig. 3d presents the histograms (40 cells) of fill factors in the reference and the controlled devices. In the sBCP based devices, the fill factors located in the range of 0.78–0.85, which was improved obviously compared to the distribution in the range of 0.67–0.76 for the reference devices. The improved fill factor was attributed to a good interface modification by the sBCP interfacial layer, which was agreed well with the dark current measurements.

To confirm the interface modification effect of sBCP, AFM and SEM measurements to evaluate the morphology of the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 films covered by PC60BM and sBCP in order. Fig. S3(a)–(c) (ESI†) shows the AFM surface images of MAPbI2.4Br0.6, MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC61BM and MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM/sBCP films, respectively. There was a large roughness of 8.93 nm for the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 films due to their large grain size and the voids between the crystalline domains. Compared to the general MAPbI3−xClx film, the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 film is relatively smooth. However, the roughness of 8.9 nm is still high and harmful for the cathode interface contact. By covering of PC60BM, the roughness was significantly reduced to 2.2 nm as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). The roughness was further reduced to 1.7 nm after the modification by the optimized sBCP layer. Fig. S3(d)–(f) (ESI†) presents the SEM top-view images of MAPbI2.4Br0.6, MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM and MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM/sBCP films, respectively. Interconnected crystalline areas at a length scale in the range of 200–500 nm, which were the main cause of the large surface roughness, were observed in the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 film (Fig. S3(d), ESI†). The voids on the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 surface were filled and the surface of the MAPbI2.4Br0.6 perovskite film was covered by the PC60BM spin-coating at some extent (Fig. S3(e), ESI†). Further deposition of the sBCP layer smoothed the MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM surface effectively (Fig. S3(f), ESI†). It means that a smoothed interface between the perovskite layer and the silver cathode can be achieved by using solution-processed BCP as the interfacial layer.
The cathode modification effect of solution-processed BCP (sBCP) was further compared with that of evaporated BCP (eBCP). The modified thickness of eBCP in the device was 8 nm (Table. S1, ESI†). Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the inverted planar MAPbI2.4Br0.6 based perovskite solar cells employing the modified evaporated BCP (eBCP) and the solution-processed BCP (sBCP) as cathode interfacial layers, respectively. As shown from the key parameters in Table 2, the sBCP based device shows higher performance due to little increase of Jsc and an obvious increase of the fill factor. The little increase of Jsc was consistent with their EQE spectrum (Fig. S4, ESI†).

To investigate the behind nature, sBCP- and eBCP-based electron-dominant devices with the device structure of ITO/TiO2/MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PCBM/BCP/Ag were fabricated and evaluated. The related current density–voltage characteristics were measure under dark conditions as shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the sBCP-based device shows better current–voltage properties than that the eBCP-based one. When acting as an interfacial layer in practical solar cells, the sBCP-based one would demonstrate a better charge extraction behavior. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was also utilized to study the internal series resistances (Rs) of both devices. The Rs consists of the sheet resistance (Rsheet) of the electrodes, the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at the interfaces between the electrode and the charge carrier selective layer, as well as the charge carrier selective layer and the perovskite layer.56 In this study, the major difference is the RCT at the interfaces between the electrode and the charge carrier selective layer. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots of both sBCP and eBCP based solar cells tested under applied voltage conditions approaching the Voc of perovskite solar cells. From the plots, RCT values of 0.98 kμ and 0.35 kμ were obtained for sBCP and eBCP based solar cells, respectively. Small RCT indicates that a small charge transfer resistance is resulted from the superior interfacial modification effect of sBCP. Therefore, higher performance is expected from sBCP based solar cells rather than eBCP based solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated high efficiency bromine–iodine based perovskite solar cells with a flattening cathode interface by incorporating a solution-processed BCP interfacial layer between the PC60BM and the silver top electrode. Compared with evaporated BCP, sBCP shows the superior cathode modification effect due to its smaller charge transfer resistance. It can smooth the MAPbI2.4Br0.6/PC60BM surface effectively, which resulted in a reduced leakage current with one order of magnitude compared to the devices without the sBCP modification layer. As a result, a high fill factor exceeding 85% and a power conversion efficiency exceeding 13% were achieved in CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx based perovskite solar cells. The high-efficient MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite solar cells with high fill factors presented in this work have potential to be integrated with CIGS or other kinds of solar cells for tandem devices.
