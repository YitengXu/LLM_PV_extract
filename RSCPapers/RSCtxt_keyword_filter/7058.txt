    , Accepted 26th June 2013First published on 27th June 2013AbstractIn this work, many single-crystalline, orthorhombic phase Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons were fabricated by a facile solvothermal method. Four types of three-dimensional solar cells prepared with In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 thin films as the working electrodes, In2S3 as the buffer layer and Cu4Bi4S9 as the inorganic dye and hole collector were tested using standard techniques. Under the same conditions, the I–V characteristics and photocurrent spectra of the cells were systematically measured. It is shown that the four types of cells all have good photoelectric properties. However, the In2O3 and TiO2 cells show better performance than the other two cells, and the highest efficiencies are about 6.2% (In2O3), 5.5% (TiO2), 4.8% (ZnO) and 3.9% (SnO2). The overall efficiencies were also compared with various oxide film thicknesses and the best performance was for films of 6 μm thickness for each type of cell. Using steady state and electric field-induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy, we further studied the charge dynamics and the transport mechanism in the sensitized electrodes. It is suggested that the matching degree of energy levels between two conduction bands (Cu4Bi4S9 and the oxides) has an obvious effect on the transport of the photogenerated charges. For good performance, we should pay more attention to alternative materials with matching degrees of energy levels, besides the optical stability, film structure, substrate thickness and the carrier mobility for solid state solar cells in the future.
1 Introduction
In the past decade, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as low-cost alternatives for harvesting solar energy. Overall efficiencies of more than 12% have been reported for systems with organic metal complex dye-sensitizers, nanostructure substrates and liquid electrolytes.1,2 However, the limitations of evaporation, short or long term stability, irreversible reactions, and so forth, seriously restricted their potential applications.3 Efforts to solve these disadvantages were made, replacing the dye and liquid electrolyte with a thin inorganic absorber layer and a solid state hole collector, respectively.4–10 The structure composed of a nanostructured substrate coated with a thin film of inorganic material as the absorber and hole collector is known as a three-dimensional (3D) solar cell.3,11–13 Cu4Bi4S9 (CBS) has good optical stability, strong absorption of sunlight, and superior photoelectric properties in a broad solar spectrum, satisfying the basic conditions as a dye.14 In this work, we reported four types of 3D solar cells with In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 thin films as the working electrodes, and Cu4Bi4S9 as the inorganic dye and hole collector. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, I–V characteristics and the overall efficiencies with various thin film thicknesses of each kind of cell were measured. We then compared their performance with reported 3D solar cells. Subsequently, we discussed the effect of the substrate structure, thickness of the film and the carrier mobility on the photoelectric properties of the cells, as well as the effect of matching degrees of energy levels on the charge dynamics and transport mechanism.
As an important member of the copper-based multicomponent chalcogenide family, Cu–Bi–S compounds consisting of Bi and S have attracted much attention regarding their preparation and the investigation of their properties. Several methods, including chemical deposition, physical vapor deposition and sputter coating, have been developed to prepare Cu–Bi–S compound films.15–17 The narrow band gap (1.4 eV), high absorption coefficient (up to 105 cm−1), and the good electrical conductivity (84 Ω cm) of polycrystalline Cu3BiS3 film, reported by Haber and Gerein,17 make it highly suitable as a light absorption layer to prepare solar cells. Moreover, Nair et al.18 have demonstrated that Cu3BiS3 thin films have outstanding photoresponse characteristics. Recently, photoelectric devices based on single crystal Cu4Bi4S9 nanowires exhibited a photoconductive response with a high external quantum efficiency (2.9 × 108%).19 The measured temperature-dependent electrical transport properties of the Cu4Bi4S9 nanowires presented typical semiconductor behaviour in the temperature region of 10–140 K and metal-like characteristics in the temperature region of 150–300 K.19 The 1D Cu–Bi–S nanostructure (Cu4Bi4S9), specifically Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons with excellent surface photovoltaic properties, has been reported by Li et al.14 However, the systematic photoelectric properties of Cu4Bi4S9 and 3D solar cells with Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons as the inorganic dye have not been studied.
Indium oxide (In2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiO2) and tin oxide (SnO2) are all promising materials for the photoanode in solar cells. Firstly, In2O3 is a wide band gap (direct band gap of 3.5–3.7 eV and indirect band gap of 2.6 eV) transparent conducting oxide semiconductor, which is often used as the transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices (such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes20–22), sensors for gas and biological sensing, etc. Secondly, ZnO as a transparent conducting oxide has received considerable attention as a ‘versatile material’. The most important applications are focused on solar cells,23–27 quantum devices, piezoelectric devices, optoelectronics and optical sensitizers, owing to its good transparency, high electron mobility, wide and direct band gap (3.37 eV), high thermal conductivity and large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature.28–30 Thirdly, TiO2 has been widely used in solar cells and as a photocatalyst for the degradation of water pollutants.31–35 For the efficient photogeneration of charges, there are two typical problems: poor efficiency in the conversion of solar energy and difficulty in reclaiming used material as a powder. Recently, a coupled system consisting of TiO2 and other low band gap semiconductor has increased the light-to-electricity efficiency.36 Fourthly, SnO2 appears to be a good candidate for solar cell applications (e.g. as a window material) because of its wide band gap (3.6 eV) at room temperature. It has also been employed in a wide range of applications including solid state gas sensors, transparent conducting electrodes, plasma display panels (PDPs), etc.37–39
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of the samples
All reagents are analytical grade. 6 mmol of In(NO3)3·4.5H2O was dissolved in 60 mL of C5H8O2, which was stirred to obtain a transparent solution. Then 5 mL of C3H8O2 was injected into the solution under constant stirring for 1 h until a transparent sol of In2O3 was obtained at room temperature. By the same method, 0.2 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O was dissolved into 50 mL of C3H8O2. Subsequently, 0.2 mmol of C2H7NO was added to the solution, which was stirred continuously at a temperature of 60 °C to yield a transparent and homogeneous sol of ZnO. The titanium and tin precursors, C16H36O4Ti and SnCl2·2H2O (all 5 mmol) were each dissolved into 50 mL of ethanol to prepare sols of titanium oxide and tin oxide, respectively.
For the fabrication of CBS nanoribbons, 0.5 mmol of BiCl3, 0.5 mmol of CuCl, and 0.7 g of dodecylamine (DDA) were dissolved into 30 mL of toluene in a 50 mL flask. The flask was heated to 70 °C and kept at this temperature for 30 min with continuous stirring, until a blue transparent solution was obtained. Subsequently, 250 μL of CS2 was slowly added to the solution, and the blue solution gradually turned into a nut-brown colloid. The colloid was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and sealed quickly. Next, the autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 30 h and cooled naturally to room temperature. Finally, the obtained CBS nanoribbons were washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried for 4 h at 60 °C under vacuum.
For the synthesis of the 3D solar cells, firstly In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 sols were deposited onto FTO conductive glasses in turn via a spin-coating method, and the thin films were crystallized quickly by thermal annealing for 10 min at 500 °C. A similar process was repeated ten times and then the glass substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h to obtain the multilayer films. The thicknesses of the four types of thin films were determined to be about 6 μm by profilometry. Secondly, In2S3 buffer layers were prepared by spraying a 0.03 mol L−1 InCl3 solution on four substrates, which was followed by sulfurization at 200 °C in a volume ratio of Ar:H2S = 95:5. The thicknesses of all of the In2S3 layers were determined by the number of cycles (one cycle corresponding to about 1.5 nm). In this work, 20 spray cycles were carried out on these substrates. Thirdly, the CBS colloid was spin-coated onto the top of each buffer layer at a suitable rotation speed. Then these electrodes were maintained at room temperature for 0.5 h and dried in turn. The spin-coating was repeated ten times and then the electrodes were maintained in an autoclave at 180 °C for 30 h to form the sensitized electrodes. Finally, four types of 3D solar cells were fabricated. Spin-coatings with different numbers for the In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 sols were applied onto each FTO to obtain various film thicknesses (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 μm), and all of the substrates were treated with the same number of spray cycles to form the In2S3 buffer layer and the CBS absorber.
2.2 Characterization of the samples
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the nanocrystals were carried out with a Philips X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 0.154 nm). Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000) with BaSO4 as the reference standard, and were converted to the absorbance data through the Kubelka–Munk method. The morphologies of the as-synthesized samples and the thin films were determined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F), and the chemical composition of CBS was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX, APOLLO X) spectroscopy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100UHR) was used to observe the microstructure of the CBS nanoribbons. The thickness of the thin films was determined by profilometry (Dektak 3 profilometer, Veeco). The electrical characteristics of the thin film were measured with a Hall-effect measurement system (HMS-3000). The electronic work function and the surface potential of the materials were determined using a scanning Kelvin probe system (SKP370). Steady state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) was utilized to evaluate the photoelectric properties of the electrodes, using a homebuilt apparatus which consisted of a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W, China, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd., China), a double grating monochromator (Zolix SP500), a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) and a light chopper (SR540). In order to ensure accurate measurement and a high signal-to-noise ratio, a special ground wire for the SPS measurement system was made, with an earth resistance smaller than 4 Ω. The ground wire was connected to the metallic shield of the sample cell and the common ports of the SPS system. For the upper and lower ITO (indium tin oxide) glass in a sandwich structure (see Fig. S1, ESI†), only the lower glass was connected to the shield of the sample cell. Electric field-induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy (EFISPS) is a technique that combines the electric field effect principle with the SPS method. An external electric field was applied to two sides of the sample, and was regarded as positive when its direction was identical to that of the incident light.
2.3 Characterization of the 3D solar cells
The incident photon-to-current efficiency was obtained using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QTest Station 1000ADI). A system using a solar simulator (Newport-94043A) was employed to illuminate the 3D solar cells. The short-circuit photocurrent density and the open-circuit photovoltage were measured with a digital source-meter (Keithley 2400). In addition, the average overall conversion efficiency (η) is given by: η = VocJscFF/Pin.(1)
In eqn (1), Voc, Jsc and Pin represent the open-circuit photovoltage, short-circuit photocurrent per unit area and the incident light power (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) respectively. Aside from this, the fill factor FF is determined by: FF = VmaxJmax/VocJsc.(2)
In eqn (2), Vmax and Jmax represent the voltage and the current per unit area at the maximum output power point, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 XRD patterns

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized CBS nanoribbons. All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed based on the orthorhombic-phase Cu4Bi4S9 (JCPDS File Card no. 77-1238; a = 31.528 Å, b = 11.622 Å, c = 3.951 Å; space group Pbnm (62)). This result is identical to the report by Li et al.14 The crystal phases of the In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 thin films are shown in Fig. 1(b), and the reflection peaks correspond to In2O3 (JCPDS no. 65-3170), ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451), TiO2 (JCPDS no. 65-5714) and SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445), respectively. It is indicated that the four thin film oxides can be indexed as the well-crystallized structure after the heat treatment. The average crystallite sizes of In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 can be estimated from the strongest peaks of their XRD patterns using Scherrer's equation, and the corresponding sizes are about 18, 9, 12 and 11 nm, respectively.

3.2 SEM, TEM, HRTEM images, and EDX spectrum
The low-magnification SEM image of the as-grown CBS nanoribbons is shown in Fig. 2(a). As can be seen, the nanoribbons are very clear with lengths up to several hundreds of micrometers or longer. The ribbon-like structure can be seen more clearly from the high-magnification SEM images, with widths of 20–150 nm as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), suggesting that the aspect ratio (length to width) is very large. Additional SEM images, including low and high magnifications of the CBS nanoribbons, are shown in Fig. S2 and S3, ESI.† According to the EDX result of the CBS nanoribbons in Fig. 2(d), the atomic percentages (at%) of Cu, Bi, and S are about 36.70, 17.42 and 45.88, respectively, and no other impurity elements are detected.

The morphologies of the In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 thin films are shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† It is suggested that the nanoparticles of In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 are homogeneous, and their average sizes are smaller than 100 nm. It is also indicated that the four types of thin films all present nanoporous structures. The cross-sections of the SEM images of the four types of 3D solar cells are supplied in Fig. 3(a)–(d). From the results, we find that four heterojunctions are formed by spin-coating CBS into the structured thin films, and that the CBS nanoribbons have completely covered the In2S3 buffer layer. It is also shown that the CBS nanoribbons protrude clearly above all of the buffer layers and the top contacts can be applied directly to CBS.

The CBS nanoribbons have completely covered the In2S3 buffer layer so they protrude clearly above the buffer layer, and the top contacts can be applied directly to CBS. 
The TEM images shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) further confirm the ribbon-like structure and the smooth surface of the CBS nanoribbons. The additional TEM images with the same phenomenon are shown in Fig. S5, ESI.†Fig. 4(c) presents the high-resolution TEM image of the CBS nanoribbons. The measured lattice spacing of about 0.65 nm is consistent with the d-spacing of the (410) planes. The vertical-direction lattice spacing of about 0.39 nm corresponds to the d-spacing of the (620) planes. Meanwhile, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image is shown in Fig. 4(d). Therefore, the results of the HRTEM and SAED images demonstrate the high quality of the single-crystalline structure of the CBS nanoribbons.

3.3 Optical absorption spectra

Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of the as-obtained CBS nanoribbons. As can be seen, the CBS nanoribbons present strong optical absorption in the whole UV-vis range, with an absorption edge at about 1400 nm. The band gap (about 0.88 eV) can be estimated by extrapolating the tangent of the absorption edge to the lateral axis, as shown in Fig. 5(b). We find that the band gap of Cu4Bi4S9 is smaller than the result reported by Li et al.14 The exhibited parabolic band profile near the cutoff energy indicates that the CBS nanoribbons are direct transition semiconductors. The optical absorption spectra of the In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9, TiO2/Cu4Bi4S9 and SnO2/Cu4Bi4S9 sensitized electrodes (thin film thickness of 6 μm), as well as all of the other components, are shown in Fig. 5(c)–(f), respectively. It is suggested that the absorption characteristics of every sensitized electrode are similar to Cu4Bi4S9, but they are not completely consistent with Cu4Bi4S9, and they present the total absorption characteristics of the dye and the multilayer films. In Fig. S7, ESI,† the variation of (αhν)1/2 and (αhν)2 with the incident photon energy (eV) is shown for In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2. According to the equations (αhν)1/2 = A(hν − Eg) (for In2O3 and TiO2)40,41 and (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg) (for ZnO and SnO2),42,43 where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy, A is the constant relative to the material and Eg is the absorption band gap, the corresponding band gaps can be estimated to be about 2.7, 2.9, 3.1 and 3.2 eV for In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2, respectively.

3.4 
          I–V characteristics and IPCE spectra of cells
Using a scanning Kelvin probe system, the energy positions of the top of the valence band for In2S3 and CBS were calculated to be about +1.2 eV and + 0.31 eV vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. It is clear that the holes can be collected by CBS, as shown in Fig. 6. Regarding the photoelectric properties of the cells, we firstly measured the overall efficiencies of the four types of cells with various film thicknesses, and the results were compared as shown in Fig. 7(a). It is indicated that the efficiencies of the four types of cells are enhanced initially with the increasing film thickness and then become slower or saturated, but the starting points and the rates of increase are different. The efficiencies of the In2O3 and TiO2 cells increase quickly from thicknesses of 2 to 7.1 μm and 2.1 to 6.5 μm, respectively, and then the two growth curves become flat. The saturated efficiencies of ZnO and SnO2 cells are at thicknesses of 6.3 and 5.8 μm, respectively, and then the efficiencies drop.

 Fig. 7  (a) The overall light-to-electricity efficiencies of the four types of cells with various thin film thicknesses. (b) IPCE spectra of the four types of cells under the same working conditions. 
For a fair comparison, the I–V characteristics of the four types of cells were measured with the same film thickness (6 μm) and deposition number of CBS. Table 1 shows that these cells all exhibit good performance. The overall light-to-electricity efficiency (η) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the In2O3 cell are the largest, and the η and Jsc of the SnO2 cell are the smallest. An identical phenomenon can also be seen in Fig. 7(a). It is also shown that all of the efficiencies follow the same trend as the short-circuit current densities. From some reported works, the highest efficiency of our cells is lower than the best result (η = 7%)44 and higher than other efficiencies (η = 3.0%, 5.5%, 2.4%, 1.2%, 4.0% and 5.0%).45–50 Regarding the performance of our cells, we think that the structure of the thin film and the preparation technology are not at their optimum, which does not allow the efficiency to achieve or exceed 7%. However, these substrate films all have nanoporous structures with high surface areas, as shown in Fig. S4, ESI,† and the structures will promote the adsorption of Cu4Bi4S9. Furthermore, the absorber layer was deposited directly with the CBS colloid, which will improve the penetration of the dye. The corresponding high fill factors and superior performance of the cells have demonstrated these advantages. However, these absorber layers did not completely fill the pores of the films, as seen from the SEM cross-section images shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d), so the substrate structure and preparation technology should be further optimized in the future. Additionally, the four types of cells were illuminated and heated at 80 °C for a long time, and then their performance was measured again. The results show that the performance of the cells are mainly in accord with the cells at room temperature, suggesting that they have good optical stability. From this discussion, we come to the conclusion that the structure and thickness of the film are the factors affecting the photoelectric properties of the cells.

At the same time, the IPCE spectra, as a function of the illumination wavelength of the four types of cells, were measured as shown in Fig. 7(b). As can be seen, the four spectra and the highest IPCE values are different from each other. At 490 nm, the IPCE value (up to 76%) of the In2O3 cell is higher than the other three cells, but the value for the SnO2 cell is only 55%. Regarding the transport of charges, we also measured the carrier mobilities of the In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 sensitized electrodes, and the corresponding values are about 14.2, 16.4, 38.5 and 12.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, respectively. On the whole, a larger carrier mobility does not lead to the higher IPCE, Jsc and η values of the cells. For the same type of electrode with different preparation conditions, the larger carrier mobility can certainly improve the photoelectric properties of cells as shown in Table S1, ESI.† From previous reports,51–53 we found that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges had a direct effect on the photoelectric properties. In the following sections, we systematically analyse the charge dynamics and the transport mechanism in the sensitized electrodes with SPS and EFISPS.
3.5 Steady state surface photovoltage

Fig. 8(a) shows the surface photovoltage (SPV) response of the Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons. As can be seen, the SPV has a very broad region and expands from the UV-vis to the near-infrared region (about 1400 nm). It is also shown that the CBS nanoribbons exhibit two photovoltaic response regions. One region is from 300 to 780 nm and the other is from 780 to 1400 nm. Moreover, the intensity of the SPV in the UV-vis region (300–780 nm) is higher than that in the near-infrared region (780–1400 nm). It is suggested that the CBS nanoribbons have a very broad solar spectrum SPV response, and the separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the UV-vis region is higher than in the near-infrared region. Hence, this material may be a potential alternative to many existing costly and/or poisonous photovoltaic materials and present obvious advantages as a dye. It is inferred that CBS thin films should have the potential application as a light absorption layer to prepare DSSCs.14,17–19

However, the SPV intensity of the CBS nanoribbons in the whole response region is weak, which indicates the limitation of single CBS as a photovoltaic material. In this work, the performance of four types of cells have demonstrated its superiority as a sensitizer. Regarding the separation of the photogenerated charges, Fig. 8(a) also shows the SPV responses of the In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 sensitized electrodes under the same conditions. From the results, the four sensitized electrodes all present enhanced SPV responses in the two regions relative to single Cu4Bi4S9. The two response regions of the In2O3 and TiO2 electrodes have nearly joined together, but the two regions for the ZnO and SnO2 electrodes are separate from each other, as for the single Cu4Bi4S9. Moreover, there is not an obvious extension to the near-infrared region for any of these sensitized electrodes. From the photovoltaic responses, we think that there are differences in the charge dynamics.
The measured work functions (Φ) of Cu4Bi4S9, In2S3, In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2, determined using a scanning Kelvin probe system, are shown in Table 2. It is clear that the electronic work function of CBS is smaller than those of In2S3 and the oxides, suggesting that CBS can act as a sensitizer. After the construction of the heterojunction between CBS and the oxides, including the buffer layer, the free electrons will transfer from CBS to In2S3 and then to the oxides. This will form the built-in electric field in the direction from CBS to the oxides in the surface space charge region (SCR), and establish the interface barrier (the buffer layer will promote the interface barrier). Under the illumination without bias, this barrier will induce the photovoltaic response.

In order to study intensively the transport mechanism of charges to explore the difference in the I–V characteristics of the cells, as well as the various photovoltaic responses in the sensitized electrodes, we have measured the surface potentials (Φ0) of Cu4Bi4S9, In2S3, In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2, and the corresponding values are about 0.22, 0.20, 0.21, 0.14, 0.19 and 0.20 eV, respectively. According to the following equation:54 χ = Φ − Φ0(3)the calculated electron affinities (χ) are shown in Table 2. From Table 2, we find that there is energy level matching between the conduction bands of Cu4Bi4S9 and each oxide. However, the electron affinities of the oxides are different from each other. The matching degree of energy levels and the corresponding overlapping area of the wave functions will also different, as shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† From previous reports,51–53 the energy level matching can promote the separation of the photogenerated charges. Due to the good overlapping between Cu4Bi4S9 and two of the oxides (In2O3 and TiO2), the photoinduced electrons in Cu4Bi4S9 can easily transfer to In2S3 and then to the conduction bands of In2O3 and TiO2. Then the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges will increase in the two sensitized electrodes. The enhanced SPV and the obvious connection between the two response regions in Fig. 8(a) have demonstrated this phenomenon. The poor overlapping between Cu4Bi4S9 and the other two oxides (ZnO and SnO2) resulted in the weak SPV responses and the clear separation of the two regions, as shown in Fig. 8(a). It is suggested that the matching degree of energy levels plays an important role and affects the charge dynamics and the separation of the photogenerated charges.
3.6 EFISPS of sensitized electrodes

Fig. 8(b)–(f) show the SPV responses of the CBS nanoribbons and the four sensitized electrodes under positive bias. From the results, CBS and the four electrodes all present enhanced photovoltaic responses and red-shifts. It is indicated that the four oxides, In2S3 and CBS all exhibit n-type characteristics.55 From the discussion above, the positive bias has the same direction as the built-in electric field, which will facilitate the transport of photoexcited electrons from Cu4Bi4S9 to In2S3 and then to the oxides, and then the free electrons will shift quickly to the surface of the electrodes. This causes the high separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges and the high photovoltaic response. With the increasing of the bias, the electric field will have a stronger effect on the photogenerated charges and induce a more obvious SPV than before. All of the red-shifts observed in Fig. 8(b)–(f) are attributed to the Franz–Keldysh effect. For a sample under an external field, the electrons in the valence band can be excited to the conduction band by a photon with lower energy than the band gap due to the Franz–Keldysh effect.54 Under a negative SPV bias, the bias has the opposite direction to the built-in electric field, which will weaken the effect of the built-in electric field. Then the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges becomes low and the photovoltaic response evidently decreases. These results are not our research focus and are not shown here.
In order to further analyse the charge dynamics in the sensitized electrodes under various biases, we compared the SPV intensities of Cu4Bi4S9 and the four sensitized electrodes, as shown in Fig. 8(b)–(f). The highest values of the SPV for Cu4Bi4S9, In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9, TiO2/Cu4Bi4S9 and SnO2/Cu4Bi4S9 increase from 88 to 203 μV, 163 to 1155 μV, 132 to 796 μV, 141 to 918 μV and 112 to 524 μV under a zero to +2 V bias, respectively. The corresponding multiples of increase of the SPV are about 2.3, 7.1, 6.1, 6.5 and 4.7. It is clear that the increased amplitudes of the SPV for the sensitized electrodes are different from each other under the same conditions. Moreover, the larger difference of the conduction band edges between Cu4Bi4S9 and the oxide does not lead to a stronger photovoltaic response, that is to say, this phenomenon abides by the “inverted region effect”.51–53,55–58 When the conduction bands of different materials become much closer, the corresponding overlapping area of the wave functions will be enhanced, which can promote the separation of the photogenerated charges as shown in Fig. S1 and S6, ESI.† The EFISPS results further demonstrate the effect of the matching degree of energy levels on the charge dynamics.
In addition, it is known that the nanoporous structures of the four types of thin films will contribute to the adsorption and penetration of the dye. The sufficient adsorption of the dye can increase the contact area between Cu4Bi4S9 and the oxides (considering the buffer layer) and promote the transport and separation of the photogenerated charges. From this work, we identified the factors affecting the photoelectric properties of the solid state solar cells as the matching degree of energy levels, film thickness, structure of the thin film and the carrier mobility. Moreover, the four types of 3D solar cells with Cu4Bi4S9 as the sensitizer all show superior photoelectric properties, and further improvement in the preparation technology of the cells should result in a higher overall efficiency and bring practical applications in the future.
4 Conclusions
Single crystalline Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbon semiconductors with a ribbon-like structure have been prepared using a facile solvothermal method. The measured results indicate that the CBS nanoribbons show broad absorption of the solar spectrum, as well as obvious steady state and electric field-induced surface photovoltage responses from the UV-vis region to the near-infrared region. Four types of 3D solar cells were prepared with In2O3, ZnO, TiO2 and SnO2 as the working electrodes, In2S3 as the buffer layer and Cu4Bi4S9 as the inorganic dye and hole collector. The photoelectric properties revealed that the In2O3 and TiO2 cells had larger photocurrents and higher overall efficiencies than the other two cells with the same film thickness of 6 μm. The overall efficiencies of each type of cell with various film thicknesses were also compared. Then we analysed the effect of the matching degree of energy levels on the charge dynamics and transport mechanism. In order to achieve superior performance for solid state solar cells, factors including good energy level matching, the nanoporous structure of the film, the appropriate film thickness and the high carrier mobility should be considered in the future.
