    , Accepted 11th May 2016First published on 12th May 2016AbstractMultifunctional composite nanocables (CNCs) with a thermoelectric NaCo2O4 inner core and TiO2 outer shell were prepared by electrospinning and annealing, and further physically mixed with TiO2 nanocrystals to serve as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.05% was obtained for the DSSC device with 10 wt% CNCs in the TiO2 photoanode, compared with 7.47% PCE for the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode. The further performance improvement demonstrated with the thermoelectric–photoelectric CNCs was due to the inevitable temperature gradient between the two sides of working solar cells caused by irradiation differences on their two sides and the heating effect of sunlight irradiation. The temperature gradients of both −5 and +5 K were created and observed to lead to a significant increase to 10.07% and decrease to 7.76% of the PCE in the DSSC with 10 wt% CNCs, respectively. The difference was attributed to different directions of the thermoelectric electromotive force caused by different temperature gradients. This work not only is significant for developing novel photoanodes of DSSCs with high performance, but also provides an alternative to utilize multiple new energy technologies including photovoltaics and thermoelectricity for higher energy usage.
1. Introduction
As an ideal clean, safe and renewable energy source, solar energy has been utilized in the form of light and heat. Sunlight can be directly converted to electricity by solar cells, while solar radiant heat can also be collected and used for solar energy water heaters, solar thermal power generation and so on. However, radiant heat is undesired in solar cells. In particular, solar radiation can create a massive amount of heat and increase the temperature of solar cells, while the energy conversion efficiencies for most photovoltaic technologies would decrease with increasing temperature, especially for polycrystalline silicon solar cells.1,2 For example, Raga et al.2 reported a significantly decreased efficiency from 16.5 to about 10.5% with increasing temperature from −20 to 70 °C for polycrystalline silicon solar modules. In comparison, a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) can present an increased efficiency with increasing temperature in the low temperature range from 20 to 40 °C. Above 40 °C, the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is reduced slowly.2 When the solar cells are at work under solar radiation, not only the surface temperature of solar cells increases because of the heating effect of sunlight irradiation, but also a temperature difference between the two sides of solar cells is developed due to irradiation differences on the two sides of solar cells.3 The temperature difference is indeed necessary for a thermoelectric semiconductor that converts a temperature gradient to an electric voltage according to the Seebeck effect. Therefore, if thermoelectric materials are introduced into solar cells, the temperature difference derived from undesired solar radiant heat could be used according to the Seebeck effect to yield a thermoelectric electromotive force. As a result, it is possible for the introduced thermoelectric materials to convert the negative effect of radiant heat on the solar cells into beneficial influences on the photovoltaic performances of solar cells. Our previous work4 reported a hybrid device composed of a series connection of a transparent DSSC, a solar selective absorber, and a TE generator to fully use the solar energy to harvest electricity with a high conversion efficiency of 13.8%. This combination of photovoltaics and thermoelectric modules to develop integrated devices did not solve the problems of solar energy synergy utilization at the material level. Deng et al.5 reported that a photovoltaic material of CdTe and a thermoelectric material of Bi2Te3 with particular nanostructures were integrated into a single photoelectrode for solar energy synergy utilization. The CdTe/Bi2Te3/FTO photoelectrode showed higher photovoltaic properties than isolated CdTe nanowire arrays, but its photovoltaic performance was at a lower level. Meanwhile, Chen et al.3 fabricated a new dye-sensitized solar cell based on a thermoelectric Bi2Te3/TiO2 composite anode, in which the incorporated Bi2Te3 nanoplates functioned as built-in nanoscale electron generators to convert ‘‘waste heat’’ to electricity and as a good photoreaction catalyst to enhance the charge transfer rate, resulting in 28% improvement of the overall power conversion efficiency.
In order to mitigate the adverse effect of solar radiant heat on solar cells, DSSCs less affected by temperature are studied in this paper. Meanwhile, DSSCs have attracted ever-increasing attention because of many advantages including low-cost, simple processing, potential high theoretical conversion efficiency, etc.6–9 In a typical DSSC, a photoanode is made up of a dye-adsorbed porous nanocrystalline TiO2 film on a conducting glass substrate, and a platinized glass substrate acts as the counter electrode. An iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple electrolyte exists between two electrodes. The dye absorbs light, and the photo-excited dye molecules inject electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 nanocrystalline film. The injected electrons are then transported through TiO2 films and collected by the transparent front electrode and external circuit. The holes are transported to the counter electrode by the electrolyte. Until now, the reported highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs is about 12.3% by Yella et al.,8 which is much lower than that of crystalline Si solar cells with a PCE of more than 20%.10
If thermoelectric materials are incorporated into a DSSC, the thermoelectric electromotive force generated from the temperature difference between the two sides of DSSCs according to the Seebeck effect would effectively affect the separation of charge carriers, and improve the short-circuit current density (Jsc). In addition, high-performance thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3 and NaCo2O4 are semiconductors with a narrow band gap and a high electric conductivity.11,12 In practice, incorporating conductive materials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs)13,14 and graphene15 into TiO2 photoanodes is a common and effective way to improve the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. For example, Leung et al.14 introduced a nanocomposite photoanode with CNTs inserted inside the TiO2 nanorods, and reported the highest efficiency of 10.24%, with a high Jsc of 18.53 mA cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 74%. The conductive CNTs in the TiO2 photoanode improved the charge transport properties and extended the electron lifetime, and thereby improved the performance of the devices. Therefore, thermoelectric materials as a semiconductor with a high conductivity inserted into the photoanode have potential to act as a charge transport highway in the DSSC, and their photovoltaic properties could be affected by both the high electric conductivity and Seebeck effect of thermoelectric materials; unfortunately, this has not been reported yet.
In this paper, a new composite photoanode based on thermoelectric–photoelectric composite nanocables (CNCs) was designed as depicted in Fig. 1a. Here, p-type NaCo2O4 with a low resistivity of about 1 mΩ cm and a high Seebeck coefficient of about 110 μV K−1 around room temperature16 (Fig. S1†) was selected as the thermoelectric core. NaCo2O4 CNCs uniformly sheathed with a thin TiO2 layer were prepared by using a coaxial electrospinning technique.17 In this architecture, the TiO2 shells of the nanocables together with TiO2 nanocrystals received the injected electrons from photo-excited dye molecules. The NaCo2O4 cores of nanocables not only generate thermoelectric electromotive force from the temperature difference according to the Seebeck effect to promote charge separation, but also provide a direct fast pathway to transport electrons. The effect of the CNC loading in the photoanodes on the photovoltaic performance was studied. An enhanced conversion efficiency of the DSSC device was obtained by adding the CNCs in the TiO2 photoanode and further enhanced by adding temperature gradients. The mechanism for the enhanced photovoltaic performances by TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs and intentional temperature gradients was also proposed.

2. Methods
2.1 Synthesis of TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables via coaxial electrospinning
TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs were synthesized by using a typical coaxial electrospinning technique.17,18 In this study, NaCo2O4 spherical nanoparticles were used rather than a solution or sol precursor to produce the NaCo2O4 nanoparticles. The reasons can be illustrated as follows. The temperature requirements for the crystallization of NaCo2O4 and anatase TiO2 were conflicting. Crystallizing NaCo2O4 nanoparticles needs a calcination temperature higher than 750 °C, while anatase TiO2 needs a crystallization temperature lower than 600 °C, and a calcination temperature higher than 600 °C generates rutile rather than anatase TiO2. In order to avoid the above contradiction in the process of electrospinning, single-phase NaCo2O4 spherical nanocrystals (100–150 nm) were first synthesized by the sol–gel method with a calcination temperature of 800 °C for 2 h. Then the NaCo2O4 nanocrystals (0.1 g) were mixed together with distilled water (5 mL), absolute ethanol (5 mL) and PVP (0.8 g) to prepare a precursor slurry to fill the inner syringe for coaxial electrospinning. The outer syringe was filled with a solution consisting of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (1.5 g, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.), acetylacetone (3 mL), absolute ethanol (9 mL) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, 0.9 g) powder (Mw = 1300000). Electrospinning was carried out with an applied electric field of 1.0 kV cm−1, with feeding rates of 18 and 4 μL min−1 for the outer and inner syringes, respectively. The electrospun fibers were collected on an aluminum drum with an outer diameter of 75 mm, which was covered by a piece of slick paper rotating at 240 rpm. The collected fibers were dried at 80 °C for at least 1 h to evaporate the solvent, and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain the CNCs with a mass ratio of NaCo2O4 and TiO2 at about 1:4. The morphology of the CNCs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI INSPECTF) and transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2011).
2.2 Fabrication and characterization of dye-sensitized solar cells
A precursor solution containing tetrabutyl titanate, isopropyl alcohol, and acetic acid was spin-coated on cleaned FTO glass, and the as-coated film was then annealed at 500 °C for 20 min to obtain a TiO2 compact layer with a thickness of about 50 nm. Then, commercial P25 TiO2 nanopowders and TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs with different contents of 0, 10, 20, and 40 wt%, terpineol, and ethyl cellulose gel were added into ethanol and concentrated by rotary evaporation to obtain viscous pastes. The pastes were deposited onto FTO glass via the doctor-blade technique and then calcined at 500 °C for 15 min to obtain photoanode films with different contents of TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs. After cooling down, the photoanode films were soaked in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye at room temperature for at least 12 h. The dye-sensitized films were immediately washed with ethanol to remove physically adsorbed dye molecules before the cell assembly. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by pyrolyzing H2PtCl6 films on FTO glass at 400 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the dye-sensitized photoanodes and Pt counter electrodes were assembled into prototype DSSCs by sandwiching a liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 MI2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The active area of each device was approximately 0.12 cm2.
The UV-visible absorption spectra of photoanode films were measured by using a U-4100 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). To estimate the dye loading capacity of photoanodes, the dye molecules adsorbed on the photoelectrodes were desorbed in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and the UV-Vis absorbance spectra were used to quantify the concentration of the dye solution. A reference solution with a known dye concentration of 7.1 × 10−6 M and a NaOH concentration of 0.1 M was prepared. The dye loading capacity was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the dye solution and the reference solution. The current–voltage (I–V) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of all the DSSCs were measured by using a PARSTAT 2273 Advanced Electrochemical System (Princeton Applied Research, USA) under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator ABET SUN 3000 with AM 1.5G filter (calibrated by a silicon reference cell). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values were measured with an EQE system (Oriel QE-PV-SI, Newport Co. Ltd., USA).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of the TiO2–NaCo2O4 nanocables, which reveals predominantly both γ-phase NaCo2O4 and anatase TiO2 with good crystallinity. In addition, a small amount of Co3O4 phase appears in the nanocables, probably due to the sodium evaporation during calcination. As shown in Fig. 1c, the precursor composite nanocables before calcination display a smooth surface with a diameter of approximate 400 nm. After calcination at 500 °C, the diameters of the composite nanocables shrank to 200–300 nm, Fig. 1d, due to the decomposition of PVP. In order to disperse the CNCs into TiO2 nanocrystals, the CNCs were ground into short CNCs with a length of 2–4 μm, Fig. 1e. The TEM image, Fig. 1f, reveals that the NaCo2O4 nanoparticles are incorporated into the TiO2 nanofiber in a single CNC. Fig. 1g shows the HRTEM crystal lattice fringes of the TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables. The crystalline interplanar spacing of about 0.27 nm corresponds to the (110) planes of anatase TiO2, while the interplanar spacings of 0.25 and 0.22 nm correspond to the (100) and (102) plane of the NaCo2O4, respectively. The above XRD and microscopic analyses confirm that NaCo2O4 was inside the TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables were formed. The cross-sectional SEM image of the composite photoanode film with 10 wt% CNCs is shown in Fig. S2.† In the photoanode, some CNCs are randomly scattered in the TiO2 nanocrystalline particles with an average diameter of about 30 nm, and many TiO2 nanocrystals are attached on the surface of the CNCs, consistent with the expected design as shown in Fig. 1a.

Fig. 2A shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of photoanode films before absorbing dye molecules. The pure TiO2 film exhibits good UV absorption and little visible-light absorption, Fig. 2A(a), due to its wide bandgap of about 3.2 eV. However, the composite photoanode films with CNCs exhibit enhanced absorbance within the visible light range, Fig. 2A(b–d), because NaCo2O4 is a narrow-gap semiconductor with a band gap of about 1.1 eV.19,20 In addition, the visible-light absorption of the composite photoanode films increases with increasing content of CNCs. Since the sizes of the TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs, including a length of 3–5 μm and a diameter of 200–300 nm, are approximate to the wavelength of incident light, the added CNCs in the photoanode films can promote multiple scattering, and thus enhance the light harvesting efficiency.21–23 However, the visible-light absorption of the photoanode films is mainly determined by the photoabsorption of dye molecules possessing much stronger light absorption than inorganic oxide films. Therefore, good visible-light absorption is observed in the UV-visible absorption spectra of photoanode films with dye molecules, Fig. 2B. Quite different from Fig. 2A for the photoanode films before absorbing the dye, the photoanode films with the dye show decreasing visible-light absorption with increasing content of CNCs, Fig. 2B. The dye loading capacities of the photoanode films were measured by UV-vis spectroscopy after desorbing from a dye saturation adsorption film24 as shown in Fig. 2C and are listed in Table 1. The dye-loading capacities decrease gradually with increasing content of CNCs in the photoanode films, attributed to the fact that the CNCs have a much bigger size and consequently a smaller specific surface area than those of TiO2 nanocrystals, Fig. 1. Thus adding more CNCs into the photoanode would reduce the dye loading capacity and then lower the visible-light absorption.

Fig. 3A shows the photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs with different contents of TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables. The results of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSCs with different loadings of TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables are summarized in Table 1. The J–V characteristic curve in Fig. 3A(a) of the device with a pure TiO2 nanocrystal photoanode shows a common photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 15.16 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.747 V, a FF of 67.01% and a PCE of 7.47%. An enhanced performance is observed with a Jsc of 16.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.758 V, a FF of 70.76% and a PCE of 9.05%, Fig. 3A(b), i.e., an improved PCE by over 21% by adding 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs in the TiO2 photoanode. However, with further increasing the content of CNCs to 20 and 40 wt%, the photovoltaic parameters including the Jsc and PCE of the DSSCs decrease, Table 1, while their Voc and FF remain at a high level in comparison to the device without any CNCs.

For a typical DSSC, the Jsc can be expressed as:25 (1) EQE = ηLHEηinjηtrηcc(2)where q is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant, c is the light velocity, λ is the wavelength, EQE(λ) is the external quantum efficiency at a specific wavelength, Pin(λ) is the incident input power density at a specific wavelength, ηLHE is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection yield from the photo-excited dye into TiO2, ηtr is the efficiency of charge carrier transport throughout the device, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency at the electrodes. According to eqn (1), the Jsc is directly related to the external quantum efficiency (EQE). Fig. 3B shows the EQE spectra of the DSSCs with different contents of TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables. In the visible region, Fig. 3B shows that the device with 10 wt% CNCs has the highest EQE, and the EQE of the DSSCs decreases with further increasing the content of CNCs. The device with 40 wt% CNCs even shows a lower EQE than that of the DSSC without any CNCs. The influence and change of the EQE are exactly similar to that of the Jsc.
In a typical DSSC, the energy band structure of TiO2 matches well with that of dyes such as N719 and the work function of the FTO electrode, indicating good ηinj and ηcc.26 Nevertheless, the high resistivity of TiO2 as well as a great deal of grain boundaries and defects in the mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal films would limit the charge transport and diffusion, which would increase the probability of recombination and result in a lower conversion efficiency. Then, according to eqn (2), to improve ηLHE and ηtr is a feasible method to enhance the EQE and photovoltaic efficiency of DSSCs. The ηLHE depends on the properties of the dye, the amount of dyes attached on the TiO2 film, and the optical path length of incident light within the dye-sensitized film,23,26 and the ηLHE can be characterized by the absorption spectra of the photoanode films after absorbing dye molecules. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing the content of CNCs decreases the dye loading capacity and the visible-light absorption, and thus reduces ηLHE of DSSCs. On the other hand, the high resistivity of TiO2 as well as a great deal of grain boundaries and defects in the mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal films would lead to a lower ηtr. When the TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs with low-resistivity cores of NaCo2O4 are incorporated into the TiO2 photoanodes, the NaCo2O4 cores can act as charge transport highways, and thus the ηtr of the DSSC can be improved. When small amounts of CNCs are added into the TiO2 nanocrystal photoanode, the unfavorable influence of reducing the ηLHE is negligible, and the favorable influences of improving the ηtr play a dominant role and result in the improvements of the EQE and the Jsc. When the content of CNCs is further increased to 20 and 40 wt%, the unfavorable effect of reducing the ηLHE is drastically enhanced, so that it suppresses the favorable influences of improving the ηtr. As a result, both the EQE and the Jsc decrease.
Besides, Fig. 3A and Table 1 also show that the FFs of the DSSCs are enhanced by adding TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables into the photoanodes. According to the aforementioned physical mechanisms of DSSCs, the series resistance (Rs) influences greatly the FFs of the DSSCs, and a lower Rs implies a lower energy loss in the device and consequently leads to a higher FF.26Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with various contents of TiO2–NaCo2O4 composite nanocables and the equivalent circuit employed to fit the measured Nyquist plots. Two RC elements represent electron transfer at the FTO/TiO2 interface and charge transfer at the electrolyte/Pt–FTO interface.27 By fitting the measured Nyquist plots, the obtained values of Rs are listed in Table 1. The DSSCs with TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs in the TiO2 photoanodes show lower Rs than the device with only the pure TiO2 photoanode, attributed to the much lower resistivity of NaCo2O4 (about 1 mΩ cm) than that of TiO2 (about 200 mΩ cm).28 The reduced Rs by adding TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs causes the increased FFs of the DSSCs with TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs.

In order to disclose the thermoelectric Seebeck effect from the thermoelectric TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNC cores on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, controlled temperature gradients (ΔT) were applied on the two sides of the solar cells by slightly cooling or heating the counter electrode side of the device. A positive temperature gradient was created if the temperature at the side of the counter electrode was higher than that at the photoanode side, and the opposite was supposed as the negative temperature gradient. For comparison, a fixed temperature difference of +5 or −5 K was used between the two sides of each DSSC. The effect of the temperature gradient on the photovoltaic performances and the J–V curves in the dark of the DSSCs with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs and without CNCs was investigated, Fig. 5A and B, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. For the DSSC with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs, a negative ΔT of −5 K enhanced its photovoltaic performance distinctly, Fig. 5A(c), with Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE increasing to 18.55 mA cm−2, 0.763 V, 72.24% and 10.07%, respectively. While ΔT was +5 K, Fig. 5A(b), an obviously decreased photovoltaic performance was observed with a Jsc of 15.09 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.737 V, a FF of 69.80% and a PCE of 7.76%. The dark current is related to the reduction of I3− by electrons from the TiO2 conduction band at a specific applied potential.29 The dark current of the device was suppressed under a negative ΔT, and increased under a positive ΔT, Fig. 5B. For comparison, the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC without any CNCs was investigated with different ΔT values as shown in Fig. 5C and Table 2. However, the same change of temperature gradients did not produce similar results. No obvious variations in both the photovoltaic properties and dark current of the samples with the pure TiO2 photoanode under different temperature gradients were observed, Fig. 5C and D(b and c). This suggests that the temperature variation at the counter electrode side of the device should not be the main reason for the performance change of the DSSC with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs under different temperature gradients. Then, the ΔT effect on the photovoltaic performances of the DSSC with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs should be attributed to the added CNCs with the thermoelectric core.

According to the thermoelectric Seebeck effect, the carriers at the higher temperature side of thermoelectric materials have a higher kinetic energy and thus diffuse into the lower temperature side under the thermoelectromotive force.30 The accumulated electrons or holes at one end of the thermoelectric semiconductor can set up a self-built electric field to prevent carrier diffusion. Finally, a dynamic equilibrium is formed to cause a steady electric potential difference, i.e. Seebeck potential, which is decided by the temperature difference and Seebeck coefficient.
TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap and high resistivity. Actually, TiO2 also shows a negative Seebeck coefficient and exhibits an unsatisfactory weak thermoelectric performance due to its high resistivity,31 Fig. S1A(b).† Consequently, for the DSSCs with the TiO2 photoanode without any CNCs, the temperature gradient effect is suppressed and weakened so that there is no obvious difference among their J–V characteristics under different ΔT values, Fig. 5C and D. Meanwhile, NaCo2O4 is a p-type thermoelectric semiconductor with a positive Seebeck coefficient and a low resistivity,16 which are also confirmed by our measuring results, Fig. S1A(a) and S1B(a),† respectively. Therefore, for the DSSC with TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs, the temperature differences of −5 and +5 K between the two sides of the device produce thermoelectromotive forces in the opposite direction inside the thermoelectric core according to the Seebeck effect, which should be responsible for the temperature gradient effect of the DSSC with TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs.

Fig. 6 shows the schematic illustrations of charge transport in a composite nanocable of TiO2–NaCo2O4 under different temperature gradients. In a p-type thermoelectric semiconductor, the lower temperature side is enriched with holes and the higher temperature side gathers electrons, while in an n-type semiconductor, the electrons concentrate on the lower temperature side. Therefore, different thermoelectromotive forces with opposite directions are created inside the p-type NaCo2O4 cores and the n-type TiO2 shells under the same temperature gradient. When the temperature gradient is negative, Fig. 6a, the lower temperature side is the counter electrode. The thermoelectromotive force inside the NaCo2O4 drives holes to the lower temperature side, that is, to the counter electrode, and the electrons are collected at the photoanode. As a result, the lower temperature end of the NaCo2O4 core is enriched with holes. Considering that there are many TiO2 nanocrystals and TiO2 shells of the CNCs surrounding the lower temperature end of the thermoelectric NaCo2O4 core, when the photo-generated electrons are injected into TiO2 from dye molecules under solar irradiation, an obvious concentration gradient of electrons is developed to drive the electrons in TiO2 to diffuse into the lower temperature end of the NaCo2O4 core. Then, the thermoelectric equilibrium is destroyed. However, the Seebeck potential should be maintained unchanged due to the unchanged temperature between the two ends of the NaCo2O4 core. As a consequence, more holes move to the lower temperature end while the higher temperature end collects more electrons under illumination. Similarly, the collected electrons can be further driven by the concentration gradient and diffuse in the direction of the photoanode. The above process is equivalent to transport of electrons from the lower temperature end to the higher temperature end of the NaCo2O4 core, that is, from the counter electrode side to the photoanode side. As a consequence, the photo-induced charge separation is promoted and the recombination probability decreases. Finally, the electron transport in the photoanode under illumination is improved to obtain an improved charge transport efficiency and an enhanced Jsc for the DSSC with TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs under a negative temperature gradient, Fig. 5A(c). In the dark, there are no photo-induced charges, and the dark current is related to the reduction of I3− to I− by electrons from the TiO2 conduction band at a specific applied potential.29 For the TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs under a negative temperature gradient, the holes collected at the lower temperature end (the counter electrode side) consume electrons from TiO2. As a result, the electrons participating in the reduction of I3− to I− are decreased, and thus, the dark current under a temperature gradient of −5 K is suppressed as shown in Fig. 5B(c). In contrast, when the temperature gradient is positive, Fig. 6b, the lower temperature side is the photoanode. When the thermoelectromotive force inside NaCo2O4 drives holes to the lower temperature side, the electrons are collected in the direction of the counter electrode; this then leads to not only the increased probability of electron–hole recombination and reduced charge collection efficiency, but also an increased number of electrons for the reduction of I3− to I−. As a result, a temperature gradient of +5 K reduces obviously the photovoltaic performance including the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of the DSSC with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs, Fig. 5A(b), and increases its dark current, Fig. 5B(b). These above results imply that a further performance adjustment is possible for the DSSCs with the thermoelectric–photoelectric CNCs by controlling the temperature gradient in DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, composite nanocables (CNCs) with thermoelectric NaCo2O4 cores and TiO2 shells have been successfully prepared by using the coaxial electrospinning technique. The CNCs were added into the TiO2 nanocrystals to obtain a new thermoelectric–photoelectric composite photoanode. Different additive amounts of TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs caused different device performances. The DSSC with 10 wt% CNCs in the TiO2 photoanode demonstrates the best photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 16.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.758 V, a FF of 70.76% and a PCE of 9.05%, due to the reduced series resistance and improved electron transport. When the content of CNCs further increases to 20 or 40 wt%, the DSSC performance decreases due to the reduced dye loading capacity and decreased photoabsorption. In addition, the temperature gradient effect on the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs with 10 wt% TiO2–NaCo2O4 CNCs and without any CNCs was investigated. The negative temperature gradient of −5 K increased the PCE of the DSSC with 10 wt% CNCs from 9.05 to 10.07%, while the positive temperature gradient decreased its PCE to 7.76%, due to the thermoelectromotive force inside thermoelectric NaCo2O4 cores according to the thermoelectric Seebeck effect. These results demonstrate the positive effect of new thermoelectric–photoelectric composite nanocables for high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells.
