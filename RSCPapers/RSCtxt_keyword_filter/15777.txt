    , Accepted 31st May 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractSeparators in batteries have a great influence on their performance and safety, where both the properties of the separator and the separator–electrode interfaces affect ion diffusion. Microporous polyolefin membranes (MPM) with excellent properties are widely used as separators in commercial lithium batteries. However, MPM separators still suffer from serious thermal shrinkage and poor wettability, which lead to safety hazards and poor electrochemical performances. Furthermore, MPM separators cannot meet the higher requirements of next-generation high-energy-density batteries. With the fast progress in battery studies, researchers have gradually recognized that the separator is a favorable platform to address the key challenges of batteries. In this review, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on the function-directed design of MPM separators. Firstly, we briefly present the challenges associated with conventional MPM separators. Then, we summarize the methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators. Subsequently, we highlight the main functions of MPM separators including improving the wettability of liquid electrolytes, enhancing the thermal stability, inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products and stabilizing metal anodes. Finally, we present a summary and future outlook of MPM-based functional separators. Insights from this review show that MPM-based functional separators can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance and safety of batteries. Also, the rational design of advanced separators will play an increasingly important role in the future development of next-generation high-energy-density batteries.
1. Introduction
The industrial revolution has promoted the large-scale development and utilization of traditional fossil energy (e.g., coal, oil and gas), also resulting in a series of environmental, social and resource problems such as environmental pollution, greenhouse effect and energy dilemma. Therefore, people are increasingly becoming aware of the need to reduce the high dependence on traditional fossil energy. Accordingly, the development and utilization of new clean energy is a favorable approach to address the above-mentioned issues. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient energy storage devices to store surplus energy due to the intermittent characteristics of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar energy, wind energy and tidal energy).
Lithium (Li) ion batteries as effective electrochemical energy storage devices are of great interest in academia and industry due to their high energy density and low redox potential.1,2 Since the commercialization of Li ion batteries by Sony in 1991,3 the rapid development of Li ion batteries has not only promoted the progress of the information era but also greatly changed the modes of life and production of human race. Currently, Li ion batteries are widely used in portable electronic devices, mobile communications, automotive technology, smart grids, etc.4,5 The state-of-the-art Li ion batteries with graphite anodes and insertion compound cathodes are reaching the theoretical specific energy density, but still cannot meet the ever-increasing demands of the market.6 Therefore, new high-energy-density battery systems have been developed. Over the past decades, to enhance the energy density of batteries, researchers have mainly focused on the development of electrolytes and electrode materials with a high theoretical energy density.7–9
Since the 2010s, Li battery separators have received significant attention, resulting in their very fast development, especially in Li ion batteries and Li metal batteries (Fig. 1a and b). Traditionally, battery separators have two main functions, as follows: (i) preventing the physical contact of electrodes to avoid internal short-circuiting and (ii) accommodating the electrolyte for rapid ion transport.4,10,11 Therefore, separators must be electronically insulative and porous. Some recent studies have demonstrated that the properties of separators are very important for the cycling stability and rate performance of Li batteries, especially the high-rate performance.12–14 Thus, to optimize the performance of a Li battery, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the properties of the separator. Generally, the wettability, thermal stability, mechanical properties, pore size, chemical and electrochemical stability, uniform thickness and shutdown behavior should be considered.15,16 Furthermore, with the rapid development of next-generation high-energy-density battery systems, some recent studies have shown that separators are favorable platforms to address the key issues of these batteries, such as inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products, stabilizing the metal anodes, regulating ion transport and enhancing the battery safety.17 Obviously, the functionalization of separators can be achieved by regulating their microstructure and chemical composition, which is helpful to enhance the performance (capacity, rate performance, cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, etc.) and the safety of batteries, especially high-energy-density batteries.

Li battery separators are mainly divided into microporous membranes, non-woven mat membranes and inorganic composite membranes.
(i) Microporous membranes such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) membranes are prepared mainly via wet or dry processes. Other polymer materials including polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and poly(ethylene terephthalate)/PP blend polymers have also been used for the preparation of microporous membranes.18 Among them, microporous polyolefin membrane (MPM) separators including PE, PP and PP/PE/PP separators are widely used in commercial Li ion batteries because of their superior chemical stability, high mechanical strength, high porosity, acceptable cost, etc.10,11 However, MPM separators also have the shortcomings of inferior wettability towards liquid electrolytes (LEs) and serious thermal shrinkage. Thus, great efforts have been made to modify MPM separators by regulating their surface chemical composition and microstructure. Fig. 2 shows the representative research on MPM-based functional separators, from which the history of their development can be seen.

(ii) Non-woven mat membranes are normally prepared via electrospinning, melt blowing and wet-laid process and often used as separators in lead-acid batteries.18,19 In recent years, non-woven mat membranes have also received extensive attention because of their good wettability, thermal stability and application prospect in power batteries.10,20 However, non-woven mat membranes also have some defects, such as large pores, uncontrollable pore structure and poor mechanical properties, which hinder their widespread applications.
(iii) Inorganic composite membranes are prepared by incorporating inorganic nanoparticles in polymeric matrices. Compared with the other separators, inorganic composite membranes feature excellent ion conductivity and thermal stability due to the added inorganic fillers, but suffer from poor mechanical properties.21
Currently, there are some good reviews on separators in various battery systems (e.g., Li ion batteries and Li metal batteries), providing a summary of their materials, functionalization, safety issues, electrolytes, fabrication methods and characterization techniques (Fig. 1c and d and Table 1). Early reviews summarized separators based on various novel materials (e.g., polymer, inorganic and fillers) and analyzed how the properties of separators (wettability, thermal stability, chemical stability, mechanical properties, porosity and microstructure) affect the battery performance. Some recent reviews focused on the progress of functional separators in inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products and stabilizing metal anodes in metal batteries. In addition, some reviews summarized the origins of battery safety issues and the progress of separators in solving these issues based on thermotolerant and flame-retardant materials. However, to date, there is still no review on the function-directed design of Li battery separators based on MPM, although MPM separators are widely used. Thus, it is necessary to summarize the progress of MPM-based functional separators, considering the challenges of MPM separators in high-energy-density batteries and fast progress in this field.

We also hope that this review will be helpful to researchers for the design of novel functional separators.
2. Challenges of MPM separators in batteries
MPM separators are widely used in commercial Li ion batteries because of their attractive features.10,79 However, MPM separators have some common shortcomings in batteries (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Challenges associated with MPM separators in Li batteries. 
(i) MPM separators have poor wettability and low LE uptake,23 which lead to low ion conductivity and high internal resistance.18 This not only reduces the power density and cycling life of batteries, but also makes the battery assembly time-consuming, given that the LE filling process is the slowest step in the assembly of Li batteries.11,80
(ii) MPM separators exhibit inferior thermostability due to their low melting point,11,18 which may lead to internal short-circuiting and even cause fires and explosions.3,80
(iii) MPM separators cannot inhibit the shuttling of intermediate products. This is because MPM separators are usually microporous with a pore diameter of several hundred nanometers, which is significantly larger than that of the intermediate products such as Li polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8) in Li–sulfur (Li–S) batteries.81 In addition, the nonpolar MPM separators do not have chemical interactions with the polar intermediate products. The shuttling of intermediate products usually results in the loss of the active materials and anode passivation. Consequently, batteries with MPM separators often show sharp capacity decay, poor cycling stability, low coulombic efficiency and low S utilization.
(iv) MPM separators tend to form extremely nonuniform ion flux over the entire metal anode in Li metal batteries because their porous structure is nonuniform.33,38 In Li metal batteries, nonuniform nucleation and the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites not only accelerate the formation of dead Li and consumption of Li metal and LEs but also increase the internal short-circuiting risk.82 These issues lead to a sharp decline in battery performance including cycling life, capacity, coulombic efficiency and safety.
(v) The elastic modulus of MPM separators (e.g., 2.1 GPa for PP) is smaller than that of the metal dendrites (e.g., 4.0 GPa for Li dendrites). Thus, MPM separators cannot inhibit the puncture of metal dendrites, which may lead to battery failure and even battery accidents. The minimum theoretical elastic modulus of separators should be greater than 7 GPa to suppress the growth of Li dendrites.17,83 Increasing the thickness of separators can effectively enhance their elastic modulus, but also results in increased internal resistance and reduced energy and power densities.
(vi) Good electrochemical stability and high ionic conductivity of separators are also essential for high-energy-density batteries. However, the electrochemical stability of MPM separators is limited to 4.5 V. In addition, MPM separators are ionically nonconductive.
3. Methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators
Considering that MPM separators possess many excellent properties, but also the above-mentioned shortcomings, their modification is necessary. Currently, the modification of MPM separators mainly focuses on improving their wettability to LEs, enhancing their thermal stability, inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products and stabilizing metal anodes. Many effective and popular techniques including blade-coating, vacuum filtration, dip-coating, self-assembly, layer-by-layer self-assembly, chemical grafting, in situ polymerization and magnetron sputtering have been used to elaborately engineer separators for use in batteries.23,80,84–87 The key advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators are illustrated in Fig. 4. Herein, the most commonly used preparation methods are briefly described and discussed in this section.
 Fig. 4  Advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators. 
3.1. Blade-coating
Functional coatings can be easily introduced on the surface of MPM separators via the blade-coating technique (Fig. 4a).10,88–90 Firstly, ceramic and/or polymer materials are mixed with additives in a suitable solvent, forming a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry is coated on the surface of MPM separators via blade-coating. Finally, the modified separators are obtained by drying at a suitable temperature. The blade-coating technique has been widely used for the preparation of commercial ceramic-coated separators due to the controllable thickness of the coating layers, simple fabrication process, easy large-scale production and low cost.91–93 For example, Zhang et al. prepared a MOF/graphene-coated PP separator for high-loading Li–S batteries using an automatic doctor blade.94 The thickness of the MOF/graphene coating (6–30 μm) determined the capacity, cycling stability and rate performance of the Li–S battery and could be tuned by the automatic doctor blade.
In most cases, organic solvents are employed in the existing coating techniques to obtain modified MPM separators, which may cause environmental concerns. Thus, some efforts have been made to develop water-based separators.95–98 Yuan et al. prepared a water-based organic-SiO2 hybrid coated PE separator using a water-based cellulose diacetate binder.96
However, the blade-coating technique has some drawbacks including evidently increased separator thickness, partially blocked pores and reduced porosity.10,80 Moreover, the coating layer may fall off from the MPM separator during battery assembly and charge/discharge due to the weak binding between them.
3.2. Vacuum filtration
Vacuum filtration is also a common and effective method to obtain advanced MPM-based functional separators (Fig. 4b).99,100 In this method, the ceramic, binder and other additives are dispersed or dissolved in a solvent under vigorous stirring and ultrasonication to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Then, the homogeneous suspension is deposited on the surface of the MPM separator by vacuum filtration, followed by drying at a certain temperature. Vacuum filtration has been widely used to prepare functional separators due to its simple operation process, easy control of the ratio of various components, tunable weight of the coating, easy recovery of the solvent and low cost.101–103 For example, Manthiram et al. reported the preparation of an activated carbon nanofiber-coated PP separator via vacuum filtration for electrochemically stable Li–S batteries.104 The thickness and areal weight of the coating layer were highly adjustable by tuning the amount of activated carbon nanofibers and binders.
The vacuum filtration method also shows some drawbacks such as evidently increased separator thickness, partially blocked pores, reduced porosity and coating easily falls off.
3.3. Dip-coating
Dip-coating involves the precisely controlled immersion and withdrawal of substrates in a homogeneous solution for the purpose of depositing a thin layer on the surface and pore walls of the substrates (Fig. 4c). Generally, the microstructure and thickness of the coating layer determine the physicochemical properties of the thin film-coated substrates, which can be regulated by the composition, concentration and temperature of the solution, surface property of the pristine substrates, dipping time, number of dipping cycles, withdrawal speed, and environment humidity.105–107 The dip-coating method shows many advantages including simple and effective process, small coating thickness and good film-forming property. Thus, the dip-coating technique has been used to prepare modified MPM separators.23,108,109 For example, an aramid nanofiber-coated PP separator with high mechanical stability and durability in LEs was prepared by dip-coating in an aramid nanofiber/dimethyl sulfoxide homogeneous suspension.108 The concentration of the suspension and the number of dip-coating times greatly influenced the air permeability, porosity and stability of the separator.
However, dip-coating often reduces the porosity of MPM separators and causes a gradient change in the thickness of the coating layer from the top to bottom.
3.4. Self-assembly
Self-assembly is a process in which an individual component spontaneously forms an organized structure without external interference (Fig. 4d). Composite materials with specific physical and chemical properties and highly ordered structures can be effectively designed and prepared via self-assembly.110 Self-assembled films are spontaneously formed by chemical interactions between molecules and substrates, which usually have thermodynamically stable ordered structures. The chemical interactions usually rely on hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals.110,111 In recent years, the self-assembly of nanoparticles or polymers on the surface of separators and the subsequent formation of well-aligned nano- and microstructure protective layers have attracted great interest due to its precisely controllable microstructure and thickness at the molecular level, high repeatability, simplicity and low cost.111–114 For example, Wang et al. designed and prepared an MnO2-coated PE separator for high performance Li–S batteries.112 An ultrathin and lightweight MnO2 coating layer was coated on one side of PE via a chemical self-assembly method. This MnO2 coating layer was tightly anchored on the PE separator due to the relatively strong chemical force between the MnO2 nanoparticles and PE separator.
3.5. Layer-by-layer self-assembly
Different from self-assembly, layer-by-layer self-assembly is a simple and relatively cheap method to obtain films with multilayered nanoarchitectures (Fig. 4e). Layer-by-layer self-assembled films are prepared by depositing polymers with opposite charges or molecules with mutually interacting binding sites.115–117 Generally, the growth, structure, and properties of films with multilayered nanoarchitectures can be regulated by the assembly conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, solvent and adsorption time) and intrinsic properties of the polymers/molecules (e.g., charge density, concentration, molecular weight and structure).34,116
Layer-by-layer self-assembly based on electrostatic interaction is the most common method used to construct stable films with multilayered nanoarchitectures. Layer-by-layer self-assembly can also be applied to combinations of inorganic particles and polymers.118,119 For example, Yuan et al. reported the preparation of a ZrO/POSS multilayer-coated PE separator via layer-by-layer self-assembly to improve the cycling stability and rate performance of Li metal batteries.120 The thickness and porosity of the separator did not obviously change because of the molecular-level increase in the thickness of each monolayer. Thus, the ZrO/POSS multilayer-coated PE separator showed good wettability, high electrolyte uptake, ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number.
Compared with electrostatic interactions, layer-by-layer self-assembled films based on hydrogen or covalent bonding show better stability and robustness.116 Shi et al. reported a high Li ion flux polymer multilayer-coated PE separator for the advanced cycling stability of Li metal anode.121 The polymer multilayer-coated PE separator was prepared via layer-by-layer self-assembly based on hydrogen bonding between the building blocks poly(acrylic acid) and poly(ethylene oxide). The polymer multilayer-coated PE separator maintained the thickness and pore structure of the PE separator.121 Overall, the layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy features the advantages of precisely controllable microstructure, high repeatability, wide range of applicable materials, simplicity and low cost.
3.6. Chemical grafting
The chemical grafting technique involves the activation of the inert surface of MPM separators by pre-treatment (e.g., plasma,122,123 electro-beam,86,124 gamma-ray,125 and UV-irradiation85) to form some grafting sites, and then ceramic materials, functional groups and/or polymers are grafted onto these sites (Fig. 4f). For example, Cao et al. prepared an ultrathin Al2O3-grafted PE separator for safe Li ion batteries.124 Firstly, the PE separator was immersed in vinylsilane coupling reagent and treated with irradiation by an electron beam to obtain vinyltris(2-methoxyethoxy)silane-grafted PE separators, which were then immersed in Al3+ solution to obtain Al2O3-grafted separators by hydrolysis reaction. The Al2O3 ceramic-grafted separator showed significantly enhanced wettability, Li ion conductivity and thermal stability without sacrificing the porous structure and thickness of the pristine PE separator. Manthiram et al. reported the preparation of a hydroxyl and/or carboxyl group-grafted PP separator via sequential hydroxylation, polyacrylamide grafting and hydrolyzation to suppress the PS shuttle in Li–S batteries.126 Gao et al. reported the preparation of a functional separator via the electron beam radiation-induced graft polymerization of methyl methacrylate on a PE separator for Li polymer batteries.127
The chemical grafting technique can endow MPM-based functional separators with good wettability, thermal stability and unique functionalities, but often at the expense of their mechanical strength.10 This is because the pre-treatments can destroy the polymer matrices of the separators.113 Moreover, the pre-treatments are costly and difficult to scale-up.10,84
3.7. 
          In situ polymerization
MPM-based functional separators can be prepared via the in situ polymerization and/or crosslinking of polymers on the surface of MPM separators (Fig. 4g). The in situ polymerization method has many advantages, as follows: (i) robust adhesion between polymer coating and MPM separator, (ii) uniform distribution of polymer on the surface of MPM separator, and (iii) relatively small thickness of polymer coatings. The robust adhesion and uniform distribution of polymers are crucial to take full advantage of the polymers and obtain high-performance batteries,10 especially for high-energy-density metal batteries. In addition, the thin polymer coating formed by in situ polymerization does not block the pore structures of MPM separators.
Due to its good hydrophilicity, high compatibility and robust adhesion capability, polydopamine (PDA) has been used to modify MPM separators for high-power Li ion batteries via the in situ polymerization of dopamine.23,128–130 Similar to polydopamine, tannic acid can also be in situ polymerized and form a thin coating, given that tannic acid has abundant polyphenols.87 Li et al. reported the preparation of a tannic acid-coated PP separator via in situ polymerization in an aqueous solution at room temperature for Li ion batteries.87 Other polymers have also been used to modify MPM separators for Li metal batteries, such as in situ vapor-phase polymerization of polypyrrole131 and in situ growth of vertical MOF-derived Co9S8.132
Overall, the in situ polymerization method is simple, effective and green to obtain high-performance MPM-based functional separators. Meanwhile, the in situ polymerization method has some shortcomings such as limited polymerization materials and sophisticated process.
3.8. Magnetron sputtering
Magnetron sputtering is a physical vapor deposition process in which Ar ions are used to bombard the target cathodes to generate cathode sputtering, and subsequently the target atoms are sputtered onto the substrate surface to form a high-quality thin film (Fig. 4h).133–135 The target cathodes are prepared from the coating materials to be deposited on the separator surface. Conductive materials can be deposited using a direct current power supply and insulator materials can be deposited using a radio frequency power supply.135,136 The magnetron sputtering method has been used to prepare high-quality functional separators for Li metal batteries.137–141 For example, Zhang et al. reported the use of an ultrathin Cu film-coated PE separator to suppress Li dendrite growth in Li metal batteries.140 The Cu film-coated PE separator was prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering. The electrically conductive Cu film coating did not penetrate the other side of the separator and did not block the pores of the PE separator.140 Tang et al. reported the preparation of a thin-layer ultra-strong diamond-like carbon-coated PP separator via direct current magnetron sputtering.137 The diamond-like carbon film showed good chemical corrosion resistance, electrically insulating nature and high modulus of 100 GPa, which could effectively inhibit the growth of Li dendrites due to its high modulus.
Magnetron sputtering has high repeatability and the coatings show good mechanical strength, but is has some shortcomings such as limited target material and high cost.
3.9. Others
To obtain advanced composite separators for high-energy-density batteries, researchers have developed diverse methods to prepare MPM-based functional separators besides the above-mentioned methods, such as atomic layer deposition,142 chemical vapor deposition,143 and interface-induced growth.144 These methods are crucial nanotechnology to obtain functional films on the nanoscale. For example, the atomic layer deposition of Al2O3 can be used to modify PP separators in Li ion batteries.142 An ultrathin Al2O3 layer (<10 nm) was deposited on the internal and external surfaces of the PP matrix without increasing the separator thickness. The Al2O3 atomic layer-modified PP separators showed good wettability even for extremely polar propylene carbonate-based LEs. Kim and Park developed an SiO2 thin layer-coated PE separator by plasma pre-treatment and chemical vapor deposition.143 The internal and external surfaces of the PE matrix were fully covered by a thin layer of SiO2, forming a whole infused structure.
The electrospinning method, as a simple and effective method, can be used to prepare not only nanofibrous separators14,145,146 but also modified MPM separators.147,148 However, the modified separators prepared via electrospinning usually show relatively poor mechanical strength.
To improve the comprehensive properties of MPM separators, different modification methods can be used together, such as combining blade-coating and in situ polymerization,130 or combining electro-spraying and photopolymerization.149 For example, a PDA–SiO2 composite-modified PE separator was prepared for safe Li ion batteries.80 Firstly, SiO2 was coated on both sides of a PE separator using an automatic film-coating machine. Then, the SiO2-coated PE separator was immersed in a dopamine solution to form the PDA–SiO2–composite modified PE separator via the in situ polymerization of dopamine. The combination of SiO2 and PDA endowed the separator with excellent mechanical stability.
4. Functions of MPM separators
4.1. Improving wettability of LEs
As the host for LEs, separators must possess high porosity and good wettability toward LEs to increase their uptake and retention rate, which minimize the internal resistance and enhance the ionic conductivity. However, MPM separators intrinsically have poor wettability toward various LEs because of the abundant –CH2 and –CH3 groups on their surface. Thus, great efforts have been made to improve the wettability of MPM separators toward LEs by increasing their surface roughness and/or surface energy (Table 1). According to the Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel models,150,151 the introduction of a suitable micro-/nanostructure can make an LEphilic surface more LEphilic or even superLEphilic owing to the capillary effect. Alternatively, various materials including ceramic nanoparticles and polymers have been used to modify MPM separators.23,87,96,122,127,128,152–154

4.1.1. Modification with inorganic materials. 
Due to their uniform and tunable size and high wetting toward LEs, inorganic nanoparticles have shown great potential for the preparation of modified separators. With the help of binders, diverse hydrophilic ceramic materials (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2 and zeolite) have been introduced on the surface of MPM separators.96,98,154,155 Ryou et al. reported the preparation of an environmentally friendly and cost-effective water-based Al2O3-coated PE separator to improve the rate performance and capacity retention of Li ion batteries.98 The Al2O3-coated PE separator featured better wetting properties and higher LE uptake and Li ion conductivity compared to that of the pristine PE separator. Yang et al. developed a boehmite particle coating-modified PE separator to improve the Li ion transport and LE wettability.88 The Li ion batteries with the modified PE separator showed a high rate performance and cycling stability and excellent overcharge protection. Thus, currently, ceramic-coated separators based on Al2O3 and SiO2 are widely used in commercial Li ion batteries.
Generally, inorganic nanoparticle-modified separators suffer from some shortcomings such as inferior mechanical properties. The ceramic coatings may fall off from the MPM matrices during battery assembly and charge/discharge due to the weak adhesion between them, causing a rapid decline in the battery performance. Huang et al. reported the preparation of an SiO2-modified PP separator by soaking a PP separator in a hydrolysis solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate with the help of Tween-80.113 The stability and LE wettability of the SiO2-modified PP separator were obviously improved. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator showed superior cycling stability with 64% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.2C.
In addition, although many inorganic coatings can improve the wettability of MPM separators by LEs, the size and structure design of inorganic coatings and their influence on the wettability of separators and performance of batteries still need to be investigated in detail.


4.1.2. Modification with polymers. 
This approach involves the introduction of hydrophilic polymers or groups in MPM separators, which can enhance their surface energy. Kim et al. prepared a poly(ethylene oxide)-coated PE separator by soaking in a poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolyte solution.22 The separator showed excellent wettability and Li ion conductivity. Other polymer-coated MPM separators with good LE wettability have also been prepared, such as nanofiber-modified PP separator by electrospinning PVDF-chlorotrifluoroethylene and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene).156
Another very popular method is activating MPM separators via plasma, electron beam, γ-ray or UV light, and then chemical grafting of various polymers or groups onto the activated separators.95,157,158 Ahn et al. enhanced the wettability of separators toward LE via O2-plasma activation of a PE membrane, which greatly enhanced the LE retention.158 Although pre-activation could make the separators LEphilic and hydrophilic, the contact angle of water and LE gradually increased with storage time, owing to the spontaneous thermal motion of the polyolefin molecular chains to minimize the surface energy.35 Gao et al. reported the preparation of an LEphilic separator with high LE uptake and good Li ion conductivity via the electron beam-induced graft copolymerization of methylmethacrylate on a PE separator.127 However, the modified separators prepared by pre-activation usually sacrifice the overall mechanical properties of MPM separators.
Inspired by mussel proteins, Park et al. developed mussel-inspired PDA-coated MPM separators with significantly improved wettability.23,128,153 Subsequently, many studies have been reported to improve the separator wettability via this method.87,129,152,159 Lee et al. prepared two types of PDA-coated PE separators via simple dip-coating.159 The Li ion battery with the PDA-coated PE separator with low-porosity showed a superior enhancement in rate capacity (40% increase in capacity at 5C) and cycling stability (290% increase in capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5C) compared to that with the PDA-coated PE separator with high-porosity (13% increase in capability and 43% increase in capacity retention). In addition, inspired by PDA, other polymer (e.g., catechol/polyamine152 and tannic acid87)-modified MPM separators with good wettability and ionic conductivity have been reported.


4.1.3. Modification with inorganic–organic composites. 
To solve the shortcomings of inorganic material-modified and polymer-modified MPM separators, many efforts have been devoted to developing inorganic–organic composite-modified MPM separators.34,157 Wang et al. demonstrated a polyethylenimine/SiO2 composite coating to improve the LE wettability, LE uptake, Li ion conductivity and transference number, electrochemical stability and compatibility with Li electrode of the PE separator in Li ion batteries.111 The structure (well-preserved porous structure) and properties (LE uptake and Li ion transference number) of the PE separator were greatly improved. Consequently, the resistance and electrode polarization were significantly reduced, endowing the Li ion battery with excellent cycling stability and capacity retention at a high current density. Zhang et al. reported the preparation of a water-based superLEphilic and thermostable separator via the deposition and in situ crosslinking of an attapulgite–polyvinylalcohol (ATP/PVA) coating on the entire surface of a Celgard matrix (Fig. 5a and b).95 Different from conventional ceramic-coated separators, the ATP/PVA/Celgard separator possessed a unique sandwiched/infused structure. Consequently, the separator featured superLEphilicity with an LE contact angle of 0°, high Li ion conductivity (0.782 mS cm−1), excellent mechanical properties and high thermostability (Fig. 5c–e). Currently, inorganic–organic composite-modified MPM separators are of great interest because the composite coatings can effectively improve the overall performance of the MPM separators in high-energy storage batteries.

4.1.4. Superhydrophobic modification. 
Although modified separators show good wettability toward LEs, they are also hydrophilic (Table 2), causing inevitable moisture uptake during the use and storage periods. This is unfavorable for the assembly and performance of batteries, especially Li metal batteries. Accordingly, bioinspired superhydrophobic surfaces may eliminate the side reactions and safety issues of metal batteries by reducing moisture uptake, and also avoid additional challenges in battery assembly, given that the drying process of separators before battery assembly is energy- and time-consuming. Thus, we reported for the first time a design idea of superLEphilic/superhydrophobic separators by modifying a Celgard separator using silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) for Li metal batteries (Fig. 5f).35 The separators featured low moisture uptake, fast LE diffusion and high LE uptake, LE retention rate and Li ion conductivity. Consequently, the Li–Li and Li–LiFePO4 cells showed high cycling stability (96.05% after 350 cycles), good rate performance (125 mA h g−1 at 5.0C), low resistance and stable open circuit voltage at 160 °C (Fig. 5g and h). Moreover, the separators could improve the performance of other Li metal batteries with high-voltage cathodes and LiFePO4–graphite pouch cells.

Superhydrophobic separators can also improve the performance of Li–O2 batteries.170 Although water aggravates Li metal anode corrosion in Li–O2 batteries, it is widely recognized that the introduction of water is a restorative pathway to improve the performance of Li–O2 batteries.171 To reduce the corrosion of Li metal anodes, superhydrophobic nonwoven fabrics were prepared as membranes to improve the energy efficiency and long-term reversibility of Li–O2 and Li–air batteries.170,172
Superhydrophobic modification can endow separators with other functions besides improving their LE wettability. Moreover, the superhydrophobic modification of separators evidently changes the interfaces in batteries, thus significantly enhancing their comprehensive performances. However, superhydrophobic separators are still in the infant state. Thus, much attention should be given to this type of separator with special wettability. The design principles and methods for the preparation of superhydrophobic separators still need to be developed. Also, the relationship between superhydrophobicity and battery performance needs to be explored.


4.1.5. Modification for other LEs. 
The LE wettability of separators plays a key role in the internal resistance and Li ion transport. Currently, there are many methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators with good wettability toward conventional commercial LEs (e.g., ether-based and carbonate-based LEs). However, conventional commercial LEs are highly flammable liquids, which increase the safety risks of Li batteries. Thus, alternative LEs (e.g., ionic liquids and novel composite LEs) have been developed to improve the safety and performance of batteries.16,75,173 However, MPM separators including those modified via the above-mentioned approaches have poor wettability for these new LEs. Thus, novel functional separators with good wettability for these new LEs need to be developed before the commercialization of new LEs.


4.1.6. Section summary. 
The pore structure, porosity, and surface properties of MPM separators have an important influence on their wettability towards LEs. The LEs should completely wet both the external and internal pores of MPM separators to increase their ionic conductivity and reduce the resistance of batteries. The wettability and LE uptake of separators are also important for the rate capacity and cycling life of batteries. In addition, fast wetting is favorable for battery assembly because LE filling is the slowest step.16,35 In the future, the physical chemistry and microstructure of the LE-separator interface in batteries should been analyzed in depth, which will provide valuable guidance for the design of advanced separators with good wettability toward various LEs. In addition, more attention should be paid to some separators with unique wettability, such as superhydrophobic but superLEphilic separators.
Alternatively, a standard method for evaluating the wettability of separators towards LEs should be established. Currently, the contact angle of LEs and LE uptake are widely used to assess the wettability of separators. However, the contact angle of LEs on LEphilic separators often decreases gradually with time, which makes it difficult to record a constant contact angle value and compare the results from different studies. Also, some free LEs adhere on the surface of separators, making it difficult to measure the LE uptake precisely.

4.2. Enhancing thermal stability
MPM separators often have poor thermostability owing to the low melting point of PP (∼165 °C) and PE (∼135 °C), which may cause internal short-circuiting, ignition and even explosion in batteries.166 Thus, to enhance the thermal stability of MPM separators, two methods have been developed, as follows: (i) introducing protective layers with high thermal stability and (ii) introducing a shutdown function.3,174

4.2.1. Protective layers. 
Protective layers composed of thermally stable ceramic materials or polymers can be used for protecting MPM separators from thermal shrinkage. The protective layers can be applied on MPM separators by surface grafting and direct coating. However, to provide solutions that can be commercialized, the protective layers must also be manufacturable and cost effective.
(i) Inorganic materials. Ceramic materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 and diatom-inspired silica have been used to modify separators via the blade-coating and grafting methods.85,86,97,142,163,164,175–177 The modified separators show good thermal stability, high mechanical stability and relatively high thermal conductivity.16,18 Zhao et al. manufactured a high-temperature stable Al2O3 ultrafine powder-coated PE separator for Li ion batteries using an automatic film coating machine.164 The separator showed no thermal shrinkage up to 160 °C. Consequently, the battery showed high cycling stability and stable open circuit voltage at 165 °C. However, single-side ceramic coatings cannot effectively improve the thermal shrinkage of separators, given that the other side of the PE separator is still exposed to high temperature. Therefore, Jeong and Lee introduced a composite coating of SiO2 and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) on both sides of a PE separator.178 The separator displayed good thermal stability, and thus improved cycling stability and safety in the battery.
Some ceramic (e.g., Al2O3 and boehmite)-coated MPM separators have been widely used in commercial Li ion batteries and power batteries. However, ceramic-coated MPM separators often have some defects, e.g., weak binding of the coating on the separator, shrinkage of polymer binders at high temperature and swelling of polymer binders in LEs.145 Thus, to enhance the safety of Li ion batteries, Lee et al. selected co-polyimide with high thermal stability as the binder and prepared an Al2O3/polyimide-coated PP separator.179 Compared with the poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) binder, the Al2O3/polyimide-coated PP separator featured higher thermal stability. Consequently, the Al2O3/polyimide-coated PP separator inhibited internal short-circuiting of the Li ion battery at 160 °C, whereas that with the poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) binder was maintained for only 40 min under the same conditions. In addition, a series ceramic-grafted MPM separators (e.g., Al2O3-grafted,124 SiO2-grafted86,177 and TiO2-grafted163) with high thermal stability have been developed by electron beam irradiation and subsequent chemical reactions.
(ii) Polymers. Diverse polymers have been used as coatings to improve thermal stability of MPM separators, including poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/poly(methyl methacrylate),180,181 poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene),147 poly(ethylene oxide),182,183 poly(acrylonitrile-co-methyl methacrylate),184 poly(glycidyl methacrylate),185 poly(methylmethacrylate),127 and poly(methyl acrylate).186 By coating the polymers on one or both sides of MPM separators, better dimensional stability can be achieved compared to pristine MPM separators. However, the limited thermal stability of polymers restrict their application in modified separators with high thermal stability. Thus, some efforts have been made to coat MPM separators using polymers with a high melting point, such as poly(diethylene glycol dimethacrylate),187 polyarylate,188,189 PDA,153 and polysiloxane.190 Hu et al. coated a PP separator with aramid nanofibers for high safety Li ion batteries.108 The aramid nanofiber-coated PP separator exhibited a higher rupture temperature than the PP separator.
(iii) Inorganic–organic composites. Inorganic materials and polymers have their own defects when used for modifying MPM separators, such as the rigidity and hard film-forming nature of inorganic materials and poor thermal and chemical stability of polymers. Therefore, inorganic–organic composites such as PDA/SiO2-modified PE,176 biomineralized zirconia175 and polyethylenimine/SiO2 (ref. 111) are favorable to improve the thermal stability of MPM separators. For example, Zhang et al. coated a MPM separator with a PDA–ceramic composite (Fig. 6a and b).80 The PDA aqueous suspension diffused into the tortuous PE network and ceramic layer and was deposited on both the external and internal surfaces of the ceramic-coated PE separator, forming an overall-covered self-supporting film. Consequently, the PDA–ceramic composite-modified separator showed substantially enhanced thermal and mechanical stability. The separator did not show visual thermal shrinkage and could maintain its mechanical strength up to 230 °C (Fig. 6c and d).

4.2.2. Shutdown function. 
In the thermal shutdown function, the separator partially melts to close off the pores of the separator when the internal temperature of batteries increases to a critical value, which can prevent ion transport in the LE, and thereby shut down the battery permanently.3,29,105,191 The separators must have substrates with a high melting point to provide mechanical support, and thus not to show severe thermal shrinkage due to partial fusion of the separator. Thus, separators with the thermal shutdown function consist of at least two polymers with different melting points. Currently, PP/PE/PP membranes are commonly used in commercial Li ion batteries because of the different melting points of PP (∼165 °C) and PE (∼135 °C).3 The PE layer as the protective middle layer will melt, and then close off the pores when the internal temperature reaches a critical value (135 °C). Meanwhile, the PP layers provide mechanical support to avoid severe thermal shrinkage of the separator.
However, PP/PE/PP separators may lose control to thermal runaway in practical applications due to the small difference in melting point between PE and PP.29 Thus, the use of temperature-sensitive materials has been proposed to achieve better safety control in Li batteries. Baginska et al. achieved autonomic, thermally-induced shut-down of Li ion batteries by incorporating thermo-responsive paraffin wax microspheres in PE separators or anodes.191 When the internal temperature reaches a critical value, the ionically insulating paraffin wax microspheres melt, and then prevent Li ion transport and shut down the Li ion batteries. Ai et al. coated thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer microspheres on a PP/PE/PP separator for thermal shutdown protection of an Li ion battery.29 The thermos-responsive microspheres could melt to form a dense layer on the surface of the PP/PE/PP separator at 90 °C, which promptly cut off the Li ion transport between cathode and anode, thus preventing the battery from thermal runaway.
Different from the thermal shutdown function of separators with nonreversible pore collapse at elevated temperature, Liu et al. reported an iongate separator by depositing a polypyrrole/PDA film on a PP separator.39 This separator was designed based on the electrochemical activation mechanism rather than thermal shutdown, and thus does not require the temperature to increase to a certain value. The iongate separator is capable of allowing Li ion transport in the oxidized on state, but prevents Li ion transport when switched to the reduced off state. The iongate separator not only enhanced the battery safety at high temperature, but also avoided self-discharge and calendar life loss of the battery during storage.39 Functional separators with reversible shutdown function show great promise for the future improvement of battery safety.


4.2.3. Section summary. 
In general, thermal runaway is one of the main causes of battery safety events, which is normally induced by thermal shrinkage of MPM separators and chemical crossover at high temperature.192 Currently, various methods have been used to improve the thermal stability of MPM separators. However, most of these methods sacrifice the intrinsic properties of MPM separators, resulting in reduced mechanical properties, blocked pores, increased thickness and reduced porosity. Meanwhile, the coating layer will also bring some new defects, such as poor stability and extra side reactions. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the thermal stability of separators without sacrificing their intrinsic properties. In the future, some attention should be paid to modifying separators using thermosensitive materials, thermotolerant materials, flame-retardant materials, etc. In addition, we should modify both the external and internal surfaces of the MPM matrices by microscopic-level design, which can fundamentally improve the thermal stability of MPM separators.

4.3. Inhibiting intermediate product shuttle
During charge/discharge, the cathode materials in batteries will be reduced to some intermediate species that are soluble in LEs.193,194 These intermediate products pass through the MPM separators together with the LEs during cycling, and then deposit on the surface of the anode via reaction with the anode.195–198 The “shuttle effect” of the intermediate products not only causes irreversible loss of the active materials, but also destroys the anode structure, leading to gradual loss of the anode activity. For example, the soluble PS shuttle represents a well-known fading mechanism in Li–S batteries.199,200 Similar active material loss has also been observed in Li ion batteries with Mn-based cathodes, i.e., Mn dissolution.25,201
For batteries with MPM separators, the shuttling of intermediate products is attributed to two reasons, as follows: (i) the pore size of MPM separators is much larger than the size of the intermediate products (e.g., PS and Mn2+) and (ii) the interaction between the nonpolar MPM and polar intermediate products is very weak. Thus, to solve these issues, researchers have focused on the structural design of cathode materials and electrolytes.202–204 For example, an effective method to trap the intermediate products in Li–S batteries is to modify the S cathode using diverse materials, e.g., carbon materials, Co–SnS2, BiOX, Fe3O4 and TiO2-x.202,203,205–209 Unfortunately, PS shuttle is still serious in the long-term cycle process. In addition, the synthesis of structured cathodes is usually complicated and expensive.
In 2012, Manthiram et al. reported for the first time the idea of using microporous carbon paper as a bifunctional interlayer between the pure S cathode and PP separator in Li–S batteries.24 This design could effectively enhance not only the S utilization but also the capacity retention. Subsequently, diverse materials have been used as interlayers in Li–S batteries (Table 3), such as polypyrrole nanotube film,210 TiO2/graphene,211 TiO2-webbed carbon nanotubes,212 multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)213 and BN/graphene.214

However, the interlayer between the cathode and the separator may cause poor physical contact, and then increase the internal resistance and impede ionic diffusion. Thus, functionalization of the separator is a favorable approach to address the shuttling of intermediate products, while minimizing the impact on internal resistance and ion transport. Manthiram's group developed a series of functional separators by coating conventional separators with carbon materials, e.g., ultra-lightweight MWCNT,215 polyethylene glycol-supported microporous carbon,93 light-weight carbon,216 ultra-lightweight PANiNF/MWCNT,217 microporous carbon nanofibers104 and MWCNT/polyethylene glycol.118 These carbon coatings not only act as ‘‘upper current collectors’’ to improve the active material utilization but also as ‘‘physical stockrooms’’ to increase the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. The effects of the carbon coatings were further demonstrated in other studies using MWCNTs/MgAl2O4,218 Ketjen black,219,220 graphite and super P-coated separators.221
However, the shuttle effect is still serious over long-term cycling because the interaction between the nonpolar carbon and polar PS is weak.203 Thus, great efforts have been made to modify separators using diverse polar materials such as heteroatom-doped carbon materials, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, clay minerals, and MOFs.202,203 The inhibition of the PS shuttle using these polar material-modified separators is mainly owing to four basic principles, as follows: (i) chemical adsorption, (ii) catalytic conversion, (iii) electrostatic repulsion and (iv) molecular sieving effect.

4.3.1. Chemical adsorption. 
Unlike physical adsorption, chemical adsorption can form a strongly coupled interface between PS and adsorbents. The strongly coupled interface not only immobilizes the intermediate products within the scaffold of the adsorbents, but also effectively improves the electrochemical contact between the intermediate products and the conductive agents. This is helpful to increase the utilization of the active materials.222,223 In Li–S batteries, PS is usually fixed by two types of chemical bonding. One is Li bonding between the electronegative elements (N, O, S, B, P, etc.) of the adsorbents and Li element in PS,222 which is similar to hydrogen bonding. The other is M–S bonding between metal X of the adsorbents and S element in PS.193,194,224–227 Various materials such as polar carbon, polymers, ceramics, clay minerals and others have been used as adsorbents for inhibiting the PS shuttle.
(i) Heteroatom-doped carbon materials. Due to their good electronic conductivity and high surface area, various heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been used as coating layers of functional separators to enhance the cycling stability of Li–S batteries.228–232 This is owing to the strong affinity between the N/O-containing functional groups of carbon materials with PS. Zheng et al. designed a functional separator to inhibit the PS shuttle by coating 2D N-doped porous carbon nanosheets on one side of a PP separator.233 The separator significantly improved the capacity and cycling stability (12.1 mA h cm−2 after 100 cycles at 0.2C) of the Li–S batteries with a high S loading of 12.0 mg cm−2. This is because of the following reasons: (i) the close-packed nanosheets created a thin layered physical barrier for PS; (ii) the N-containing groups in carbon improved the PS-binding capability via chemisorption; (iii) the highly porous structure and ultrahigh surface area of the coating layer provided abundant adsorption sites for PS; and (iv) the coating layer with high electronic conductivity acted as an ‘‘upper current collector’’ to improve the electrochemical reuse of the trapped PS. Wang et al. reported the preparation of an ultralight MCNT/N-doped carbon quantum dot-coated separator, which endowed an Li–S battery with a high initial capacity of 1330.8 mA h g−1 and cycling stability with a capacity fade rate of 0.05% per cycle at 0.5C over 1000 cycles.234 The Li–S battery also exhibited an excellent rate performance and anti-self-discharge behavior.
Besides Li–S batteries, Dou et al. developed an N- and S-co-doped reduced graphene oxide-decorated separator for high-performance Li–organosulfur batteries.235 The batteries showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1364 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and a high cycling stability of 750 mA h g−1 at 1.0C after 700 cycles.
(ii) Polymers. Compared with carbon materials, polymer materials have stronger chemical adsorption capability for PS.236 Chung and Manthiram designed a composite separator for Li–S batteries with a pure S cathode.93 The composite separator was prepared via the modification of a Celgard separator using a polyethylene glycol-supported microporous carbon coating via the tape casting method. Polyethylene glycol enhanced the PS adsorption capability via chemical bonding and improved the mechanical strength of the composite separator. The microporous carbon could also trap PS in its micropores by physical adsorption. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the composite separator showed a high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Subsequently, polymer supported carbon-coated separators have been widely developed to improve the overall performance of batteries. Various polymers including chitosan,237,238 polyaniline,217 PDA,239 polypyrrole,131,240 PVDF241 and polyethylene glycol118,242 have been used.
(iii) Ceramic materials. Ceramic-coated separators have also been developed to improve the cycling stability of Li–S batteries owing to their strong PS-trapping capability.112 Li et al. reported an Al2O3-coated Celgard separator to reduce the PS shuttle and improve the stability of the S cathode.243 The porous Al2O3 coating not only provided pathways for Li ion transport but also trapped PS, which endowed the Li–S battery with an initial capacity of 967 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and a high reversible capacity of 593 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.
Modified separators, especially ceramic-coated separators, can inhibit the PS shuttle, but increase the thickness and sacrifice the Li ion conductivity. Thus, Li et al. reported the preparation of an MoS2/Celgard composite separator with high Li ion conductivity as an efficient PS barrier for highly stable Li–S batteries.244 MoS2 nanosheets with high Li ion conductivity were prepared via the intercalation of Li ions in bulk MoS2, and then deposited on the surface of a Celgard separator. The MoS2 nanosheets not only trapped PS by forming strong Mo–Sn2− bonds, but also provided free spaces to accommodate PS. Thus, the MoS2/Celgard composite separator featured fast Li ion diffusion, high Li ion transference number and conductivity and strong PS-trapping capability. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator showed a high initial capacity and good cycling stability.
Alternatively, ceramic coatings are usually loosely packed on the surface of separators, which is disadvantageous for the physical blocking of the PS shuttle and mechanical stability of the coatings.4,203 Therefore, an ultralight MoS2-polymer-modified separator was prepared through the layer-by-layer self-assembly of 2D MoS2 nanomaterials and poly(acrylic acid) for advanced Li–S batteries.34 The MoS2-polymer modified separator not only inhibited the PS shuttle because of the physical shield by its “nanobrick wall” structure and chemical adsorption by MoS2 and poly(acrylic acid), but also suppressed the growth of Li dendrites because of its robust mechanical strength and the Li-ion conductive MoS2 layers. Consequently, the Li–S batteries with the separator exhibited outstanding cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of 0.029% per cycle and a high reversible areal capacity of 2.0 mA h cm−2 at 1.0C.
Also, ceramic coatings often increase the weight and resistance of batteries, which result in a low energy density and poor utilization of the active materials. More importantly, the poor electronic conductivity of ceramic materials is not conducive to efficient charge transfer, and thus slows down the reaction kinetics of batteries. Thus, the integration of ceramic materials and conductive carbon materials as composite coatings can improve the PS-trapping capability, utilization of active materials, discharge capacity and cycling stability. Various composite coatings such as MgBO2(OH)/CNT,245 MnO2/GO/CNT,246 Ti3C2Tx/GO,247 Nb2O5/graphene oxide,248 MnO/Ketjenblack,249 Mg0.6Ni0.4O/Ketjenblack,250 Al2O3/CNT,251 Al2O3/graphene,252 Li4Ti5O12/graphene,253 WS2,254 BN255 and N-doped MXene256 have been used to modify MPM separators.
Besides metal-S batteries, the shuttle effect of intermediate products has also been observed in other batteries, such as Li ion batteries with Mn-cathodes.201 Lee et al. reported the use of a modified separator to improve the high-temperature performance of an Li ion battery with an Li1.1Mn1.86Mg0.04O4 spinel electrode.25 The separator was prepared by growing Al2O3 films on a PE separator, and subsequently introducing –OH groups via the hydrolysis of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The separator with carboxylate or sulfonate groups could solve the Mn dissolution issue of the Li ion battery at high temperature.
(iv) Clay minerals. Due to their unique nanostructures and abundant active sites, clay minerals (synthetic and natural) have shown great potential in the energy storage field.258–260 Ahn et al. inhibited the PS shuttle by modifying a PP separator using synthetic montmorillonite (MMT) and modifying the S cathode using 20 wt% MWCNT.261 Unfortunately, MMT is electronically nonconductive and its content was too high, causing an evident decrease in Li ion conductivity and energy density, and increase in interface resistance. LAPONITE®RD, a synthetic hectorite-type clay mineral nanomaterials, possessing abundant –OH groups and Li ions,101,262 which can be used for trapping PS and enhancing the Li ion conductivity. We reported the preparation of a LAPONITE®RD nanosheet (LNS) and carbon black (CB)-coated Celgard separator to inhibit the PS shuttle and improve the Li ion conductivity simultaneously (Fig. 7a).101 The separator featured the following advantages: (i) efficient inhibition of PS shuttle by Li–O and O–S bonding, (ii) fast and homogeneous Li ion transport through the separator due to the nanolayered structure and abundant Li ions of LNS, and (iii) reactivation and reutilization of the trapped PS by the conductive coating layer. The LNS/CB-Celgard separator showed fast Li ion diffusion, high Li ion conductivity (0.590 mS cm−1), good LE wettability and high thermal stability. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator and pure S cathode showed high cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.028% per cycle at 1.0C over 500 cycles), rate performance and ultralow self-discharge behavior (Fig. 7b). The LNS/CB-Celgard separator could also improve the performance of Li–LiFePO4 and Li–S batteries.

It is well known that the microstructure of nanomaterials has a great influence on the ion transport, PS adsorption and growth of dendrites in batteries.79,263 Thus, Zhang et al.257 reported the preparation of a series of natural clay mineral/carbon composite separators using natural minerals with 1D to 3D microstructures including halloysite (HAL, nanotubes), ATP (nanorods), MMT (nanosheets), illite/smectite (nanosheets) and diatomite (DAO, 3D porous) to inhibit the PS shuttle and improve the overall performance of Li–S batteries with a pure S cathode and composite cathode with a high S loading (Fig. 7c–f).264 It was found that the separators modified with 2D mineral nanosheets could effectively inhibit the PS shuttle and improve the Li ion transport in Li–S batteries. This is because of the abundant adsorption sites, high surface area, 2D channels and high packing density of the nanosheets. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the MMT/CB-Celgard separator showed the highest upper plateau discharge capacity, initial reversible capacity, rate performance and cycling stability. The MMT/CB-Celgard separator also enabled stable cycling of the Li–S battery with a high S loading of 8.3 mg cm−2. These works demonstrate that clay minerals are very promising nanomaterials for the development of novel battery separators, given that clay minerals possesses many advantages including diverse nanostructures, low cost and eco-friendly nature.
(v) Others. Other materials with high PS-trapping capability such as MOFs132,144 and LiF265 have also been used to modify separators to improve the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. MOF materials have high porosity, uniform pore size, tunable pore parameters and high surface area, and thus are very promising for the design of advanced separators for high-performance batteries. However, the large-scale preparation of MOFs is difficult and the conductivity of MOFs is usually low. Thus, Xu et al. reported a highly conductive Ni3(HITP)2-modified separator for inhibiting the PS shuttle to improve the cycling stability and rate performance of an Li–S battery with a high S loading of 8.0 mg cm−2.144


4.3.2. Catalytic conversion. 
Despite the great progress in inhibiting the PS shuttle via physical and chemical adsorption by coating materials on the surface of modified separators in recent years,197,203 this approach still has some shortcomings. Owing to the irreversible thermodynamic diffusion and slow redox reaction kinetic process of charge/discharge in Li–S batteries, the conversion of PS to short-chain Li sulfide (Li2S2/Li2S) is a very slow process. This leads to the enrichment of PS on the coating materials. Once the limited active sites of the coating materials are completely occupied by PS, their subsequent adsorption will inevitably be seriously hindered. Moreover, upon discharge in Li–S batteries, will the continuous production of PS result in adsorption saturation? After adsorption saturation, will the PS shuttle intensify again? Thus, accelerating PS conversion to solid Li2S2/Li2S is a promising approach to reduce the enrichment of PS on the coating materials and decrease their dissolution in LEs. Some recent studies implied that catalysts including metals and transition metal compounds can not only efficiently adsorb PS but also catalyze the conversion of PS.266–268 Thus, the modification of separators using catalytic materials is an alternative approach to inhibit the PS shuttle.
(i) Meal catalysts. Inspired by metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction, metals including Co and Ni have been developed for modifying separators to promote the conversion of PS to Li2S2/Li2S.269,270 Song et al. reported the preparation of a functional separator modified with an Ni composite with an Ni–N4 structure, which improved the kinetics in Li–S batteries.271 The Ni sites could efficiently trap PS via Sn2−⋯Ni–N bonding. Meanwhile, the charge transfer between the oxidized Ni sites and PS could promote the catalytic conversion of PS during charge/discharge by reducing the free energy and decomposition energy barriers of the trapped PS in the electrochemical process.
Besides Ni and Co, Fe is also a potential metal catalyst for the modification of separators to enhance the kinetics in Li–S batteries. Xie et al. reported the preparation of graphene foam impregnated with single-atom catalysts including Co, Ni and Fe modified separators for Li–S batteries with a high S loading.272 Among the metal catalysts, the Li–S battery with the Fe composite separator showed the best cycling stability, even at an ultralow Fe content (∼2 μg) and high S loading.
However, metal catalysts often reduce the energy density of Li–S batteries owing to their high intrinsic density. Thus, it is necessary to combine the minimum amount of metals with carbon materials, given that the light-weight carbon can provide abundant electron pathways. Considering this, Wang et al. developed a functional separator by coating Co-embedded carbon nanosheets and graphene on a PP separator, which not only could trap PS through chemical affinity, but also promote the kinetic conversion of the trapped PS (Fig. 8a).273 Consequently, the Li–S battery with the composite cathode (90% S content) exhibited a high reversible capacity (1103 mA h g−1) and volumetric capacity (1062 mA h cm−3) at 0.2C. More importantly, the separator endowed the Li–S battery consisting of a freestanding carbon nanofiber/S cathode (with a high S content of 78 wt% and S loading of 10.5 mg cm−2) with a high discharge capacity (1190 mA h g−1) and volumetric capacity (1136 mA h cm−3). In addition, the combination of metals (Ni and Co) with other materials (e.g., SiO2 (ref. 274 and 275) and g-C3N4 (ref. 276)) for the modification of separators has been developed to trap PS and promote the catalytic conversion of PS.

(g) Schematic illustration of the PS conversion processes on TiN, TiO2 and TiO2–TiN heterostructure surfaces. Reproduced with permission.31 Copyright 2017, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
(ii) Metal oxides. Metal oxides possess unique surface chemistry to strongly interact with PS. Several metal oxides including SnO2,277 MnO3 (ref. 278) and Sc2O3 (ref. 279) have been used to modify separators to promote the catalytic conversion of PS. However, the poor electronic conductivity of most metal oxides increases the kinetic barrier of electron transfer on the surface, which seriously affects the redox kinetics in Li–S batteries.267 Thus, Xu et al. designed a functional separator by coating a PP separator with TiO2 nanosheets possessing oxygen vacancies (Fig. 8b–f).280 The TiO2 nanosheets possessed high ion and electron conductivities, which not only improved the PS adsorption capability but also significantly enhanced the catalytic ability, as verified by first-principles calculations. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator and high S loading of 7.1 mg cm−2 exhibited a high areal capacity of 5.83 mA h cm−2 after 100 cycles. Therefore, the introduction of oxygen vacancies or other transition metals is a very promising way to increase the conductivity of metal oxides.
(iii) Metal sulfides. Different from metal oxides, 2D layered metal sulfides have good sulfiphilic sites and higher electronic conductivity.281,282 The catalytic activity of metal sulfides for PS is mainly derived from their unsaturated edge sites, which facilitate the transfer of ions and electrons. Brindha et al. reported the preparation of an SnS2 nanosheet-modified separator to inhibit the PS shuttle in Li–S batteries.283 Compared with SnS, the SnS2 nanosheets had poor conductivity because of their wide band gap. Liu et al. developed an SnS/carbon-coated functional separator for highly stable Li–S batteries.284 The SnS nanosheets had higher PS trapping capability and catalytic activity than SnS2 nanosheets. In addition, CoS,282 MoS2,285 VS2,286 ZnS287,288 and ReS2 (ref. 289) nanosheets have also been developed for the modification of separators in advanced Li–S batteries. Besides nanosheets, metal sulfides with other nanostructures (e.g., CoS2 nanoparticles277 and ZnS nanospheres290) have also been used for the preparation of functional separators, which endow Li–S batteries with excellent rate performances and cycling stability.
(iv) Other metal compounds. Recently, metal phosphides, nitrides and carbides (e.g., NbN,329 CoP,330 Ni3ZnC0.7,331 and Mo2C332) have been used for the design of functional separators due to their metallic conductivity. Wang et al. demonstrated that MoP2 nanoparticles had high catalytic activity for PS, and thus the Li–S battery with the MoP2/CNT-coated separator exhibited a high reversible capacity and cycling stability.333 Fan et al. found that an MoN composite separator could not only trap PS by Mo–S bonding but also promote the decomposition of PS in an Li–S battery.334
However, metal phosphides, nitrides and carbides usually have low polarity because their anionic species occupy the interstitial sites in the metal lattice, which leads to poor affinity for PS.267 Thus, Niu et al. designed a 3D hierarchical N-doped carbon nanosheet/MoP nanocrystal hollow nanosphere-coated separator to inhibit PS diffusion.335 MoP not only showed strong adsorption ability toward PS via physical and chemical trapping, but also accelerated the catalytic conversion of PS. Subsequently, nanocubic CoP/carbon336 and FeP/graphene oxide microsphere337 modified separators were developed, which showed strong PS trapping capability and high catalytic activity.
(v) Combination of adsorption and catalytic conversion. In Li–S batteries, the adsorption and catalytic conversion of PS are equally important in inhibiting the PS shuttle. Metal oxides possess strong PS trapping capability because of their high polarity, but the surface diffusion barrier is relatively high due to their low electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, metal nitrides and carbides have high catalytic activity because of their metallic conductivity, but their poor polarity limits their PS-trapping capability. Thus, a combined TiO2–TiN heterostructure with a synergistic effect was designed (Fig. 8g), i.e., high PS trapping capability of TiO2 and facile charge transfer on the conductive sites of TiN.31 Consequently, the Li–S battery with the combined TiO2–TiN heterostructure/graphene-coated separator exhibited outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 73% at 1.0C after 2000 cycles. Subsequently, other heterostructure materials including Fe2O3–Fe3C,338 MoO2–Mo2N339 and Co9S8–CoO340 have been designed to modify separators to improve the cycling stability of Li–S batteries. For example, Wang et al. designed a heterojunction of MoP–MoS2 for the modification of a PP separator, which enabled the effective anchoring of PS and enhanced the kinetics in lean electrolyte Li–S batteries.341
Moreover, the other catalytic materials including Ni3Fe,342 FeTaPc,343 Bi2Te2.7Se0.3,344 CoSe2 (ref. 345) and Sb2Se3−x346 also exhibited strong chemical affinity to PS and catalytic activity for the fast kinetic conversion of PS.


4.3.3. Electrostatic repulsion. 
During the discharge of Li–S batteries, S8 is first reduced to negative S82−, and subsequently to negative S62− and S42−.196,197,202,236 According to the charge repulsion effect, some electronegative group-grafted separators can repel the passage of electronegative PS anions (Sn2−), while selectively allowing the passage of Li ions. Nafion with abundant SO3− groups has been widely used for the modification of separators to the improve cycling stability of Li/Na–S batteries.27,347–350 Kaskel et al. developed for the first time a sodiated Nafion-modified PP separator to improve the performance of Na–S batteries.351 The Na–S battery with the separator showed good cycling stability (∼75% increase in capacity to 350 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles). Zhang et al. designed a Nafion-coated Celgard®2400 separator to enhance the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of Li–S batteries (Fig. 9a and b).27 The separator with abundant SO3− groups allowed Li ion hopping but rejected PS anion hopping. Consequently, the Li–S battery showed superior cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.08% per cycle at 0.2C over 500 cycles) and high average coulombic efficiency (95.6% over 500 cycles) (Fig. 9c). Subsequently, Nafion-modified separators such as Nafion-coating,352 Nafion/polyethylene oxide/super P coating,353 and Nafion/super P coating354 have been reported and promising results have been obtained. To obtain more efficient ion selective separators, Zhang et al.355 reported the preparation of a ternary layered separator, which endowed an Li–S battery with a high initial capacity (1057 mA h g−1), coulombic efficiency (95%) and cycling stability. Firstly, an ultra-thin GO coating as a barrier layer was used to seal the macropores on the Celgard separator, and then a Nafion layer was deposited on the GO layer.

Reproduced with permission.119 Copyright 2020, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Inspired by Nafion, other sulfonated materials have also been used to modify MPM separators for Li–S batteries.356,357 Wang et al. designed a sulfonated acetylene black-modified separator to improve the initial capacity (1262 mA h g−1) and cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.24% per cycle at 0.1C) of an Li–S battery with a high S loading (3.0 mg cm−2).358 In addition, functional separators with other electronegative materials such as polymers117,359,360 and clay minerals298 can also effectively inhibit the diffusion of PS anions.
Recently, Choi et al. reported the preparation of a dipole-aligned BaTiO3-coated separator to suppress PS migration in Li–S batteries.114 The ferroelectric character of BaTiO3 can give rise to permanent dipoles upon the application of an electric field. The permanent dipoles can effectively block PS via electrostatic repulsion. The Li–S battery with the BaTiO3-coated separator showed a significantly improved cycling performance of 82.8% retention after 50 cycles. In addition, the BaTiO3-coated separator showed high thermal stability, and thus suppressed thermal shrinkage of the PE separator at 120 °C.
Inspired by the repulsion effect of hydrophobic surfaces, a novel strategy of “PS-phobic” surface was developed via a “self-defense” mechanism to block the PS shuttle in Li–S batteries.36 2D VOPO4 sheets with abundant active sites can adsorb a large amount of PS by strong V–S bonding. The VOPO4 sheets anchored with PS showed strong electronegativity, and thus could suppress the PS shuttle via the Coulomb repulsion between PS anions, which was verified by advanced time/space-resolved operando Raman experiments. The Li–S battery with the separator showed a high capacity (1310 mA h g−1), rate performance (415 mA h g−1) and cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.012% per cycle at 3.0C).


4.3.4. Molecular sieving effect. 
Owing to the inevitable dissolution of the intermediate products in LEs, it is an effective approach to block their shuttle channels.14,196,197,293,361 Inspired by the molecular sieving effect, an ionic sieve has been proposed and developed to separate target ions from an ionic solution based on their size and shape, such as Li ions and PS in Li–S batteries.81,362 According to previous calculations, the monomer units of PS (Li2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8) in Li–S batteries show varying S–S bond lengths ranging from 2.01 Å to 2.39 Å and the Li–S bonds lengths of 2.57 ± 0.02 Å.363,364
On the one hand, if the pore size of the porous materials is smaller than the bond lengths of PS, the PS will not be able to pass through the separator. Thus, Manthiram et al. modified a PP separator using a polymer with intrinsic nanoporosity to suppress the PS shuttle in Li–S batteries.365 The polymer coating allowed Li ion transport, but blocked the passage of PS. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator delivered a specific capacity of 780 mA h g−1 and capacity retention of 81.7% after 200 cycles at 0.2C.
On the other hand, if 2D nanosheets can be precisely regulated to prepare layered coatings on separators, PS can also be effectively blocked because of the nanoscale interlayer spacing between the 2D nanosheets. Shao et al. developed an ultrathin separator (30 nm) with atomic-confined-space via the assembly of GO and layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH) on a PP separator (Fig. 9d).119 Both molecular dynamics simulation and experiments verified that the atomic channels (1.1 nm) of the LDH/GO ultrathin film not only blocked the PS shuttle (>1.5 nm) but also promoted the uniform diffusion of Li ions. Consequently, the Li–S battery with the separator showed a high initial discharge capacity (1092 mA h g−1) and good cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.08% per cycle) at 0.2C.


4.3.5. Section summary. 
The notorious shuttling of intermediate products causes the irreversible loss of active materials and destroys the anode structure, which result in severe capacity decay, poor cycling stability and low rate performance. Thus, MPM-based functional separators have been developed to address these issues physically (physical adsorption and molecular sieving effect) and chemically (chemical adsorption, catalytic conversion and electrostatic repulsion) (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of four basic principles for inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products. 
However, batteries still suffer from poor lifetimes with the use of MPM-based functional separators with only physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, catalytic conversion or electrostatic repulsion for intermediate products. This is because of (i) the weak interaction between the nonpolar materials and polar intermediate products, (ii) the contradiction between limited active sites for adsorption and continuous production of intermediate products, and (iii) the limited service life of catalysts. Therefore, MPM-based functional separators with multiple functions (e.g., high adsorption capacity and catalytic activity) should be constructed to efficiently address the shuttling of intermediate products. However, few works have been reported on this concept. Meanwhile, the synergistic mechanisms of multiple functions should be studied in detail via the combination of simulation, calculation and in situ characterization techniques. This is crucial to the structural design and optimization of novel MPM-based functional separators.
Different from other strategies, functional separators with a good molecular sieving effect should be an effective strategy to achieve the long-term stable cycling of batteries. MPM-based functional separators with the molecular sieve effect are usually achieved by regulating the size and uniformity of the porous structure. Thus, materials with a uniform pore size and tunable pore parameters are urgently needed for the construction of MPM-based functional separators to efficiently inhibit the shuttling of intermediate products. Covalent–organic frameworks, MOFs and their derived carbon materials are very promising to achieve this goal.

4.4. Stabilizing metal anodes
The demand for high energy-density storage has provided an incentive for the design and development of stable rechargeable metal batteries, such as Li, Na and Zn metal batteries.366–368 However, the nonuniform nucleation and uncontrollable growth of metal dendrites accelerate the consumption of LEs and metal anodes, which leads to poor cycling stability and safety issues in metal batteries.6,17,369 In rechargeable metal batteries, the nucleation/growth of dendrites is an intrinsic electrochemical deposition behavior of metal anodes. This is largely rooted in the unique metallurgic characteristics of metals and the mass transport of the metal ions via diffusion, migration and convection.82 During deposition, ions get electrons from the metal atoms, and then deposit on the metal anode surface, which are called “nuclei”. According to the tip-induced nucleation mechanism,83,370 subsequent metal ions tend to deposit on the nuclei and gradually form metal dendrites. Once the dendrites pierce the separator, thermal runaway, ignition and even explosion of the battery will happen because of internal short-circuiting.3
The separator is very important for metal batteries, which greatly affects the diffusion of metal ions in LEs and the growth of dendrites.83,384–386 Thus, the functionalization of separators by regulating their chemistry and/or structure is one of the most promising methods to stabilize metal anodes33,100,375,377,381 due to their direct contact with the anodes and easy large-scale production. Various functional separators have been designed for stabilizing metal anodes and the proposed methods can be classified into four categories (Table 4), as follows: (i) regulating the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrites by improving the ionic transfer and diffusion behaviors, (ii) suppressing dendrite growth via enhanced mechanical strength or chemical reaction, (iii) changing the dendrite growth direction via metallophilic nucleation sites or chemical reaction, and (iv) early smart detection of dendrite growth and others.

4.4.1. Regulating uniform nucleation and growth of dendrites. 
Metal dendrite formation and growth are rooted in the transport of metal ions, which are closely related to the properties of the separators. Fast ion transport provides sufficient metal ions in all directions and creates a uniform electrochemical deposition surface.82 In contrast, slow ion transport creates a strong concentration gradient on the surface of the metal anode, which induces dendrite growth. Thus, nonuniform ion flux and low ion transfer are responsible for the nonuniform electrochemical deposition and subsequent growth of dendrites, leading to internal short-circuiting and even explosion in batteries. The methods to obtain homogeneous ion flux and fast ion transfer include enhancing the wettability, improving the ion transfer characteristics by chemical adsorption and regulating the pore structure of separators.
(i) Wettability. The good wettability of a separator toward LEs can facilitate fast ion diffusion and well-distributed Li ion flux. Choi et al. developed a mussel-inspired PDA-coated PE separator to achieve excellent cycling life for Li metal anodes (Fig. 11a).153,388 The PDA coating turned PE hydrophilic toward Les, and then increased the LE uptake of the separator. The high LE uptake contributed to the formation of uniform ion flux over the entire Li anode, which resulted in less dendrite growth.153,388 Subsequently, PDA composite coatings including PDA/graphene389 and PDA/octaammonium POSS106 have been used to modify separators to regulate the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrites. In addition, other materials with good hydrophilicity such as Mg(OH)2 nanoflakes390 and polypyrrole131 have also been used to modify separators, which enable an uniform Li ion distribution on the Li anode surface in Li metal batteries.

(ii) Ions transfer characteristics. Improving the ion transfer and homogenizing the ion flow using nanomaterials with strong ion adsorption can also regulate the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrites.92,390,391 Wu et al. designed a functional separator by simply blade-coating polyacrylamide-grafted-GO onto a PP separator.375 The abundant CO and N–H groups of the polyacrylamide chains can offer high-concentration active sites for the efficient adhesion and homogeneous distribution of Li ions, leading to dendrite-free Li deposition. Moreover, GO nanosheets show high mechanical strength for inhibiting Li dendrite growth. Consequently, the Li metal anode with the separator showed a high coulombic efficiency of 98% and unprecedented stability of more than 1900 h cycling at 20 mA cm−2. Recently, Zhang et al. designed a bioinspired separator via the successive deposition of SNFs and PDA on a Celgard separator.377 The SNF/PDA composite coating offered abundant O,N-containing groups and Si–O groups, which not only could redistribute the Li ions in the LE for fast Li ion transfer and uniform Li ion flux, but also acted as lithiophilic sites for inhibiting the PS shuttle by chemical bonding (Fig. 12b). Consequently, the separator enabled long-term stable cycling of the Li metal anode (with stable voltage polarization of 25 mV for 2300 h at 1.0 mA cm−2, more than 600 h cycling at 10 mA cm−2) and high cycling stability (0.018% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0C) in an Li–S battery with a high S loading of 4.3 mg cm−2 (Fig. 12c). Moreover, other materials including MOF-Co nanosheets392 and HxMnO2+x/CNT/graphene99 have also been used to developed MPM-based functional separators for suppressing Li dendrite growth by creating a homogeneous Li ion flux and inhibiting the PS shuttle by chemical interactions. Armand et al. reported the preparation of a polyolefin-based Janus separator with a single-ion-conducting polymer-grafted side and a low-dimensional material-coated side for advanced rechargeable Na–S batteries.37 The single-ion-conducting layer not only stabilized the Na metal anode by forming a homogeneous Na+ ion flux but also inhibited the PS shuttle via electrostatic repulsion. In addition, the low-dimensional material layer (defect-rich and N-containing Ti3-xCNTy MXene) could improve the kinetics of the Na–S battery by the catalytic conversion of PS.

(iii) Pore structure. The commercial MPM separators are ionically insulating in nature, but become conductive because of the LEs in their pores. However, their extremely uneven pore structure leads to the anisotropic distribution of ions on the metal anode surface, then nonuniform nucleation, and finally fast dendrite growth. This is due to the fact that ions are enriched on the anode surface corresponding to the separator pores for electrochemical deposition, but are scarce on the anode surface corresponding to the separator matrix.33 Thus, Zhang et al. reported the concept of ion redistributors for dendrite-free Li metal anodes (Fig. 11d and e).33 The ion redistributor was prepared by using an Al-doped Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) coating layer on a PP separator. The LLZTO coating with 3D ion channels acted as a redistributor to regulate the transfer and distribution of Li ion flux on the anode surface (Fig. 11e). Consequently, the LLZTO-coated PP separator realized a high coulombic efficiency in an Li–Cu cell (98% over 450 cycles), high cycling stability in an Li–Li cell (1.0 mA cm−2 for 800 h) and high specific capacity (140 mA h g−1) and long cycling life (88% capacity retention until the 90th cycle) in an Li–LiFePO4 pouch cell. Nyholm et al. developed a tri-layer separator for stabilizing Li metal anodes by generating a well-distributed Li ion flux on the anode surface through uniform nanochannels of a cellulose nanofiber coating.123 The separator showed high dimensional stability even at 200 °C and good thermal shutdown function. Subsequently, other studies have also shown that regulating the pore structure of separators can improve the cycling stability of Li metal batteries.89,103,382 Following the theoretical analysis of both the electrochemical deposition behavior and spatial distribution of Li ions (Fig. 11f and g), a PVA/LNS nanocomposite separator with a nacre-like microstructure was prepared via the flow-induced alignment of LNS along the surface of a Celgard separator and in situ crosslinking of LNS with PVA (Fig. 11h).38 The symmetric Li–Li cells (with ether-/carbonate-based LEs) with the PVA/LNS nanocomposite separators showed a low overpotential and a long cycling life at a high current density of 10.0 mA cm−2, which is 10–20 times improvement in cycling life compared to the Li–Li cell with a Celgard separator. Remarkably, a stable Li metal anode with low overpotential and a long cycling life of over 2000 h was achieved by the separator even at a high current density of 30 mA cm−2 and a cycling capacity of 15.0 mA h cm−2. Consequently, the Li–S battery (5.4 mg cm−2) showed a high rate performance and cycling stability, given that the separator could efficiently suppress the growth of Li dendrites and PS shuttle. Moreover, the separator could also improve the performance of a high-voltage Li-NCM523 battery (8.8 mg cm−2).
(iv) Others. In addition, the alloying of Li anodes with abundant Li deposition sites can accelerate the rapid and uniform diffusion of Li ions. Zhang et al. reported the preparation of a nano-Si/poly(acrylic acid)-coated PP separator for stable Li metal anode.379 The nano-Si/poly(acrylic acid) coating could react with the Li metal and form a unique interfacial structure composed of Li–Si alloy and Li-poly(acrylic acid), resulting in accelerated and uniform Li ion flux and rich Li deposition sites. Li et al. developed a PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3-coated PP separator, which could be reduced by Li metal to form a Li–Pb alloy adhered on the Li anode surface.91 The Li–Pb alloy provided a uniform electric field across the interface, and then improved the Li deposition/stripping efficiency.


4.4.2. Suppressing uncontrollable dendrite growth. 
Due to the physical characteristics of metals, metal ions preferentially deposit on the defects (cracks and slip lines) in the metal anode surface, which results in the nonuniform nucleation and growth of Li dendrites.32 Therefore, the tendency of dendrite formation is usually unavoidable during charge/discharge. The strategies of physical barriers and chemical reactions are very useful methods to suppress uncontrollable dendrite growth in metal batteries. Physical barriers prevent dendrites from piercing the separators by super-strength separators. The strategy of chemical reactions involves stopping dendrite growth by chemical reactions between the coating layer of the separator and dendrites.
(i) Physical barriers. The mechanical strength of the separator is very important to prevent its piercing by dendrites. Once the mechanical modulus of a separator is 1.8-times higher than that of metallic dendrites, the separator would prevent dendrite proliferation.79,83 Thus, some efforts have been made to design ultra-strong separators for suppressing uncontrollable dendrite growth.34,102,378 An Al2O3/UV-cured ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate-coated MPM separator with exceptional nanoscale surface mechanical properties was developed for preventing Li dendrite growth.85 Yan et al. used 2D hexagonal VS2 flakes as the building blocks for the preparation of a layered composite separator to suppress the growth of dendrites and PS shuttle (Fig. 12a).286 The layered structure of VS2 not only enhanced the puncture resistance of the separator but also cushioned the volume expansion of the Li metal anode. Moreover, the VS2 coating showed high chemical affinity with Li metal anode because it is lithiophilic. Consequently, an Li–S battery with a high S loading (9.24 mg cm−2) showed a high initial areal capacity (8.3 mA h cm−2), which is 16-times higher than that with the PP separator (0.5 mA h cm−2). Also, Wang et al. reported the preparation of an inorganic hydroxyapatite-modified separator to suppress dendrite growth via the nanopile mechanical interlocking strategy.380 However, MPM and commercial ceramic-coated separators are still vulnerable and easily deform under the stress of external shock, which will create a high local current density, and thus trigger the formation of Li dendrites.393–395 Thus, Yu et al. designed a nacre-inspired separator to enhance the impact tolerance of Li batteries.396 The highly oriented aragonite platelet coating not only featured a high impact resistance because of the sliding of the aragonite platelets, but also maintained a uniform Li ion distribution because of its ion conductive and porous structure. Consequently, the Li metal pouch cell showed excellent cycling stability under external shock.
These studies demonstrate that improving the mechanical properties of separators is an effective approach to suppress the growth of Li dendrites.
(ii) Electrochemical reactions. It is well known that Li metal can electrochemically react with silica nanoparticles. Thus, Cui et al. developed a silica nanoparticle-coated separator to inhibit the growth of dendrites (Fig. 12b).397 The separator was prepared by sandwiching a layer of silica nanoparticles between two pieces of PE separator. Once the Li dendrites grew through the PE separator, they reacted with the silica nanoparticles via a solid-state conversion reaction, and thereby slowed further Li dendrite growth. Unlike the conventional ceramic-coated separators, this separator was not in direct contact with the cathode and anode, which avoided undesirable electrochemical side reactions.397 Subsequently, a PP/GO/PP trilayer separator was developed to improve the coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of Li metal batteries, given that GO can chemically etch Li dendrites via a spontaneous redox reaction.398 In addition, Huang et al. developed a “dendrite-eating” separator for high-areal-capacity Li metal batteries by introducing an Si coating on one side of a PP separator.90 The Si coating improved the Li electrodeposition and Li utilization via electrochemical reactions between Si and Li dendrites.


4.4.3. Changing the dendrite growth direction. 
Controlling the dendrite growth direction by functional separators can also stabilize metal anodes. Xie et al. developed a nanocarbon-coated separator to control the dendrite growth direction.32 The coating of the separator facing the Li metal anode not only had good electronic conductivity but also abundant immobilized Li ions. During charge/discharge cycling, Li dendrites started to form and grew out from the surface of the Li anode toward the separator and from the separator surface toward the Li anode (Fig. 13). These Li dendrites grew toward each other (through-plane direction) and eventually contacted. According to the tip-induced nucleation theory, the driving force of the Li dendrite growth disappeared. In the following charge/discharge cycling, the Li dendrites grew from the contacted dendrite in-plane direction as verified by in situ TEM. Consequently, this approach alleviated the formation of an SEI, reduced the decomposition of the Li metal and LEs, and thereby enhanced the cycling stability (with capacity retention of 80% after 800 cycles) and coulombic efficiency (>97%) of the Li–LiFePO4 battery. To further confirm this concept, Zhang et al. prepared a ultrathin Cu film-coated PE separator to guide the deposition of Li metal and change the Li deposition morphology through dendrite merging.140 The Cu coating acted as an additional conductive agent to facilitate the electrochemical deposition of Li metal, and also enhanced thermal stability of the separator and safety of the battery. Subsequently, functional separators with lithiophilic nucleation sites and lithiophilic polymers have been developed to control the dendrite growth direction, enabling the stable cycling of Li metal anodes.130,138,141,149

4.4.4. Early smart detection and others. 
Currently, it is impossible to completely eliminate the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites using the existing methods including functional separators, structured anodes, artificial SEI films and LE additives.366,399 Thus, Cui et al. designed a smart battery that employed a bifunctional separator composed of a polymer-Cu-polymer structure to monitor dendrite growth before internal short-circuiting.26 Once Li dendrites penetrated the separator, pronounced voltage changes could be detected, which is helpful to avoid internal short-circuiting, ignition and even explosion in Li batteries. This method has high accuracy and sensitivity for internal short-circuiting and can also be applied to other metal batteries besides Li metal batteries.400
In addition, Yang et al. developed a BN nanosheet-coated thermally conductive separator for stable Li metal anodes.100 The BN coating provided a homogeneous thermal atmosphere during the Li deposition/striping cycling because of its exothermal nature during electrochemical reactions. Consequently, the Li metal battery with the separator showed the uniform deposition of Li ions, and thus good coulombic efficiency (92% over 100 cycles) and cycling stability. Similarly, a BN/carbon-coated separator was developed to improve the cycling stability of Li–S batteries.255


4.4.5. Section summary. 
The growth of metal dendrites is determined by metal nuclei thermodynamically and kinetically.83 Currently, four methods have been developed for stabilizing metal anodes. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for stabilizing Li metal anodes 
Regulating the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrites is an effective approach to achieve stable metal anodes with long-term cycling stability. Thus, metal batteries with these MPM-based functional separators often show long cycling life, low consumption of LEs and metal anode, and high safety. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies indicate that stable metal anodes are only obtained in special electrolyte or battery systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a relatively universal strategy for stable electrochemical deposition in different LE systems.
The strategy of suppressing dendrite growth is based on the concept of forcing them to stop growing, and then to obtain stable metal anodes. The method of changing the dendrite growth direction involves the growth of dendrites from the opposite direction, and then changing the growth direction after the dendrites meet. However, if the balance between stopping and growing is broken, the metal dendrites will continue growing. Thus, the Li metal batteries with MPM-based functional separators designed via these two methods often show limited cycling life and higher consumption of LEs and Li metal anode.
Early smart detection can completely ensure battery safety. Thus, it is the pivotal to design some in situ approaches to monitor the internal conditions of batteries through voltage-, temperature- and pressure-sensing functions. Unfortunately, early smart detection is not only complicated and expensive, but also cannot fundamentally solve the thermal runaway in batteries.
Most of the studies on MPM-based functional separators suppressed Li dendrite growth via one of the above-mentioned approaches, whereas that via integrated approaches is rare. Moreover, in most studies on MPM-based functional separators, stable Li metal anodes were only obtained under a limited current density (≤5.0 mA cm−2) and/or cycling capacity (≤3.0 mA h cm−2) in special batteries. Thus, it is crucial to take advantage of various methods to achieve stable electrochemical deposition at a high current density and cycling capacity in different battery systems.

4.5. Others
High-voltage Li ion batteries (e.g., 5 V Li/NCM battery) have been developed because of their wide operation voltage window. However, although MPM separators have been widely used in commercial Li ion batteries, their electrochemical stability is limited to 4.5 V. Thus, MPM separators cannot meet the demands of high voltage batteries. Thus, some polymer composite separators with high electrochemical stability have been developed for high-voltage batteries.401,402 For example, an ATP/PVA-coated Celgard separator was prepared by deposition and in situ crosslinking for a 4.9 V Li/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery.95 These studies demonstrated that MPM-based functional separators with good electrochemical stability in high-voltage Li batteries can be achieved by using electrochemically stable materials and designing proper structures.
MPM-based functional separators with high ionic conductivity have also been developed to enhance the cycling stability and rate performance of Li ion batteries.84,160,403 For example, Zhang et al. prepared a high ion conductive separator by coating hydroxyethyl cellulose aerogel on a PP separator.403 The cellulose aerogel-modified PP separator showed high Li ion conductivity (2.03 mS cm−1) and Li ion transference number (0.46), which are two-times that of the pristine PP separator (0.95 mS cm−1 and 0.23, respectively). This is attributed to the macroporous structure of the cellulose aerogel layer, the LE retained in the pores, and the anions bonded with the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose aerogel.403 Consequently, an excellent rate performance and cycling stability were achieved by the cellulose aerogel-modified PP separator.
5. Conclusions and outlook
5.1. Conclusions
Separators are not necessarily electrochemically active materials, but they are far from being passive battery components. Currently, MPM separators are widely used in commercial Li ion batteries because of their many excellent properties. However, conventional MPM separators still suffer from poor wettability and serious thermal shrinkage, which lead to poor electrochemical performance and safety concerns in Li ion batteries.
Meanwhile, next-generation high-energy-density batteries are of great interest in academia and industry owing to the increasing demand for renewable energy resources. Thus, various new electrodes and LEs have been developed to meet the demands for new battery systems. These novel batteries and materials also generate many new scientific and technical challenges, such as the notorious shuttling of intermediate products, uncontrollable metal dendrite growth and more serious safety hazards. Moreover, the conventional MPM separators cannot meet the higher requirements of novel batteries. In the past few years, various novel MPM-based functional separators have been developed to enhance the battery performance and safety of new battery systems, although the existing problems have not been entirely solved.
In this review, we started by summarizing and discussing the challenges of the conventional MPM separators. Thus far, MPM separators mainly suffer from poor wettability, serious thermal shrinkage, nonuniform and larger pore structure and poor mechanical strength. Secondly, the methods for the preparation of MPM-based functional separators including blade-coating, vacuum filtration, dip-coating, self-assembly, layer-by-layer self-assembly, chemical grafting, in situ polymerization, and magnetron sputtering were briefly introduced. Then, the latest advances in the development of MPM-based functional separators for improving their wettability to LEs, enhancing their thermal stability, inhibiting the shuttling of intermediate products, stabilizing metal anodes, etc. were reviewed and discussed in detail. Lastly, we listed several possible directions for the future development of MPM-based functional separators, such as multifunctional separators, integrated design with electrodes, performance evaluation under critical metrics, safety and low cost.
Insights from this review show that the electrochemical performance and safety of various batteries can be significantly enhanced by using MPM-based functional separators. Also, advanced separators will play an increasingly important role in the future development of next-generation high-energy-density batteries. In addition, we believe that novel materials and techniques remain to be discovered, invented and integrated for the design of advanced separators.
5.2. Outlook
Owing to the key technical defects of MPM separators in batteries with LEs, solid-state electrolytes are regarded as the most likely substitutes. However, MPM separators and LEs will dominate for a long time because of the huge challenges faced by solid-state electrolytes. With our gradually deeper understanding of both the separator properties and the separator–electrode interfaces, it becomes evident that separator functionalization offers a large design space to significantly improve the comprehensive performance of various batteries, such as ionic diffusion, safety, coulombic efficiency, internal resistance, cycling stability and rate performance. However, although a series of separator functionalization methods has recently been proposed to address the key issues of batteries, the comprehensive properties of batteries still need to be further improved, especially high-energy-density batteries. The following items should be considered during the design of new advanced separators in the future.
(1) Multifunctional separators. Most of the existing studies about MPM-based functional separators enhanced the battery performance via only one of the functions in Section 4. Consequently, there is a large space to further enhance the comprehensive performance of batteries by designing novel multifunctional separators. To date, studies on multifunctional separators are rare. Given that the separator is in direct contact with the cathode and anode, it is possible to endow separators with multiple functions via their reasonable design to address the issues related to the cathode and anode. For instance, multifunctional separators with high mechanical strength and uniform nanopores structure can improve the cycling stability and rate performance of Li–S batteries by simultaneously suppressing the PS shuttle and Li dendrite growth. Multifunctional separators with high chemical and electrochemical stability toward LEs can help to enhance the operation voltage window of batteries. Currently, the development of multifunctional separators is one of the most promising approaches for obtaining high-performance and safe metal batteries. To achieve this goal, advanced materials with low-cost and simple fabrication techniques need to be developed besides new preparation techniques.
(2) Integrated design. Separator functionalization usually increases the thickness of MPM separators, which results in an increase in interface impedance and reduction in the volumetric energy density of batteries. Accordingly, the integration of the cathode with the separator makes it possible to avoid the above-mentioned issues. The integrated design of the electrode and the MPM separator can be achieved via two methods, as follows: (i) incorporation of active materials in the coating layer of the separator and (ii) direct deposition of active materials on the separator (as the current collector). It should be noted that the integrated design of the electrode and the separator is different from traditional functional design of MPM separators. Firstly, the integrated design not only can reduce the interface impedance and but also improve the ion transport by avoiding an interface gap between the cathode and separator. Secondly, the integrated design can enhance the energy density by reducing the thickness of the separator and avoiding the use of a metal current collector. Thirdly, the integrated design can provide extra capacity by the incorporation of active materials in the coating layer of the separator. Moreover, the integrated design makes the functional separators more robust in terms of thermal and mechanical stability. Although only limited studies have been reported, it can be predicted that more efforts will be devoted to the integrated design of the electrode and MPM separator in the future.
(3) Performance evaluation under critical metrics. Great efforts have been made to address the key scientific issues of batteries using MPM-based functional separators in the past few years. However, in most of the previous studies, the batteries were not assembled according to the industrial standards, such as high active material loading (>5 mg cm−2), low electrolyte-to-active material ratio (<5 μL mg−1), low negative/positive ratio (<5), ultrathin metal anode (<50 μm) and low carbon content (<5%) in pouch-type cells. Consequently, the reported significantly enhanced battery performance is often misleading. In fact, these parameters determine the energy density of batteries and the applicability of new functional separators. Therefore, it is important to note that the influence of MPM-based functional separators on the comprehensive performance of batteries must be studied under these critical metrics.
(4) Safety issues. With the rapid development of high-energy-density batteries, safety becomes one of the urgent and huge challenges to be solved. The safety risks of Li batteries mainly come from the poor thermal stability of the separator, the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites and chemical corrosion. The functional separator offers an ideal design platform, given that the separator is the final protective barrier to ensure battery safety. We should pay more attention to the development of high-security batteries by designing new MPM separators with the functions of alleviating dendrite growth, thermo-sensitivity, high thermotolerance, flame-retardant, etc. Thus, early smart detection, superior thermostable separators and high mechanical strength separators are crucial for battery safety.
(5) Advanced simulation calculation and characterization techniques. MPM separators are ionically nonconductive. Thus, studying the ion transport behaviors in separators using simulation calculation (e.g., COMSOL Multiphysics and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulation) and advanced characterization techniques will help further deepen the understanding of the ion transport mechanism. The deep excavation of this mechanism can further guide the functional design of separators in terms of structure and chemical composition. In addition, the interface reactions and stress–strain between the functional separator and the electrodes should be systematically studied and detected using more visual in situ techniques, which will aid the targeted design of functional separators for special battery systems.
(6) Commercialization. The large-scale application of MPM-based functional separators should be emphasized to accelerate their further commercialization. Currently, the main challenges faced by MPM-based functional separators for their commercialization are their high fabrication cost and complex preparation processes. For commercial MPM and ceramic-coated MPM separators, the global market average price of separators dropped rapidly by ca. 57%, from 2.6 $ m−2 (2018 year) to 1.1 $ m−2 (2020 year). With the expansion of battery separator production and increased competition in the industry, the price of the separator will fall continuously in the future. Thus, we should pay more attention to the development of MPM-based functional separators using low-cost materials and simple preparation processes.
