    , Accepted 21st May 2014First published on 23rd May 2014AbstractA novel organic small molecule water-soluble poly-N-alkylpyridine substitued metallophthalocyanine derivative VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, namely 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octakis-[N-methyl-(3-pyridyloxy)] vanadylphthalocyanine iodide (1:8), was synthesized and applied in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Notably, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.12% for the working area of 2 × 2 mm2 and a PCE of 7.23% for the working area of 4 × 4 mm2 have been achieved in the PSCs with this molecule as a cathode interlayer. They are comparable with the higher values of PCE of the PSCs reported currently, indicating that VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 is a new promising candidate as a good cathode interlayer for highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on blends comprising conjugated polymers and fullerenes are the subject of considerable investigation because of their potential to enable the fabrication of low-cost devices that convert sunlight into electricity.1 Currently, the record of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs has reached 9%.2 In order to improve the PCE of BHJ PSCs, significant efforts have been made in terms of new material synthesis,3 device structure optimization4 and controlling the morphology of the active layer.5 Moreover, the interface of an electrode and an active layer has well attracted increased attention to improve device efficiency by minimizing charge collection/extraction barriers and forming ohmic contact between an electrode and an active layer. Significant improvements in PCEs have recently appeared due to an introduction of a cathode interlayer between an active layer and a metal electrode. Many materials such as LiF,6 metal oxides,7 water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)8 and alcohol/water-soluble organic or polymeric electrolytes2a,b,9–11 used as cathode interlayers have successfully enhanced the PCE of PSCs. Compared to other cathode interfacial layer materials, advantages of alcohol/water-soluble organic or polymeric materials are apparent in the PSCs due to their simple, vacuum-free and environment-friendly procedure to form a film during the device fabrication. Because the alcohol/water solubility of the organic or polymeric materials can avoid intermixing between the active layer and the interlayer, alcohol/water-soluble organic or polymeric molecules are promising cathode interfacial layer materials for all solution processed PSCs. Incorporation of two conjugated polyelectrolytes, poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] (P3TMAHT) and poly[9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-fluorene]-b-poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] (PF2/6-b-P3TMAHT), have improved PSCs based on poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acidmethyl ester (PC71BM) with very good efficiencies, from 5% to >6%.9a Recently, Wu and co-workers demonstrated that by incorporating poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN), a typical example among alcohol-soluble polyfluorenes as a cathode interlayer, PSCs have shown simultaneous enhancement in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). As a result, PCEs of the PSCs based on PC71BM and polymer thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) can reach 8.37% in normal architecture2a and even up to 9.26% in inverted architecture.2b
To be a suitable cathode interlayer for PSCs, a material must meet several requirements. Firstly, it should have adequate alcohol/water solubility to avoid intermixing between the active layer and the interlayer. Secondly, it should effectively lower the work function (WF) of the cathode to facilitate electron extraction from the active layer to the electrode while its hole-blocking ability should be good enough as well. Thirdly, it should have good electrical conductivity and good film formation properties. Finally, it should benefit the contact and interfacial compatibility with the active layer. Until now, the reported organic/polymer cathode interlayers, which could efficiently improve the PCE of PSCs, are very limited. Actually, most of the alcohol/water soluble organic cathode interlayers have been designed and synthesized based on fluorine units with alcohol/water soluble groups.2a,b,9 In addition, some 3-(6-alcohol/water soluble polymer based on trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophenes have been used as cathode interlayers to construct high efficient polymer solar cells.10 So far, most of the cathode interlayers were formed by polymers. Small organic molecule based cathode interlayers were rare.11 Compared to polymers, the small molecules have the advantages of well-defined structures, high-purity without batch-to-batch variation and easy modification.12
In recent years, metallophthalocyanines have become a hot research topic in the field of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their easy synthesis and adjustable physical properties, high field-effect mobility, intense absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region and extraordinary thermal and photochemical stability.13 Generally, metallophthalocyanines are investigated as donors in small molecule solar cells.13b,c However, no research has been focused on metallophthalocyanine as a cathode interlayer in PSCs. It is well known that phthalocyanine based molecules are of easy modification, large conjugated π-system, and outstanding stability. Therefore, we selected poly-N-alkylpyridine phthalocyanine derivatives as target molecules first. In this study, we synthesized an organic small molecule VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 named 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octakis-[N-methyl-(3-pyridyloxy)] vanadylphthalocyanine iodide (1:8) (Scheme 1). The neutral 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octakis(3-pyridyloxy)vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc(OPy)8) could be synthesized directly by reaction between 4,5-bis(3-pyridinyloxl)phthalonitrile and vanadium(III) trichloride. The purification of VOPc(OPy)8 was very easy by recrystallization and column chromatography due to its good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran etc. Methylation of VOPc(OPy)8 with CH3I resulted in the water soluble vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc(OPyCH3I)8) (Scheme 1), which makes it a potential eco-friendly cathode interlayer in PSCs.

2.2 Device fabrication and characterization

Fabrication of polymer solar cells and electron-only devices: PTB7 and PFN were purchased from 1-material Inc. PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source. All materials were used as received. The blend ratio of PTB7:PC71BM is 1:1.5 by weight and the active layer was spin-casted from the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene–1,8-diiodoctane. PFN was dissolved in methanol under the presence of a small amount of acetic acid. VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 was dissolved in water in the presence of 0.6% acetic acid. Firstly PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 140 °C for 10 min. Secondly, blend films of PTB7:PC71BM were spin-casted from solution on PEDOT:PSS and then dried under vacuum. For Device I, 100 nm Al was directly vacuum-deposited on the activelayer. For Device II, 0.6% acetic acid treatment was carried out by spin-coating water with 0.6% acetic acid on the top of the active layer and then Al was evaporated as a cathode. For Device III and IV, ∼5 nm PFN and VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 were deposited on the active layer by spin-coating respectively and then Al was evaporated as a cathode. To fabricate electron-only devices, Al was vacuum-deposited on cleaned ITO as an anode. Then the same procedures with the fabrication of polymer solar cells described above were followed to complete counterparts (Devices V–VIII).

Characterization and measurement: Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. Solar cell performance was tested under 1 sun, AM 1.5G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech., Inc., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National institute of metrology, China. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were acquired using a Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech Inc. USA) at room temperature in air. In addition, the static contact angles of the as-prepared surfaces were measured with a commercial contact angle system (DataPhysics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature using a 4 μl water droplet as the indicator. AFM images were measured by using the S II Nanonaviprobe station 300HV by tapping-mode.
3. Results and discussion
In order to highlight the function of the novel small molecule VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer comparable to PFN in the PSCs, we prepared a set of devices with various cathodes having a working area of 4 × 4 mm2 as follows.
Device I: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Al].
Device II: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/0.6% acetic acid/Al].
Device III: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al].
Device IV: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8/Al].
For comparison, the two control devices (namely Device I and Device II) have been fabricated. In Device I, Al was directly deposited on the active layer. In Device II, Al was deposited on the active layer treated by the solution of 0.6% acetic acid in water, which is the solvent of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8. It aims to figure out that the main contribution of enhanced PSC performance is not from the solvent of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 but from VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 itself.

Fig. 1 shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the above four PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (a) and in the dark (b), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (c). Table 1 presents a summary of the open circuit (Voc), short circuit (Jsc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) derived from J–V characteristics under illumination, and the rectification ratio derived from J–V characteristics in the dark.

Under illumination, devices with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8/Al (Device IV) and PFN/Al (Device III) as cathodes show a Voc of 0.765 V and 0.755 V respectively, which are higher than the control devices with (Voc = 0.699V, Device II) and without (Voc = 0.675 V, Device I) 0.6% acetic acid treatment. The increase in Voc can be mainly attributed to the reduced work function (WF) of the Al cathode. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS) measurements were carried out with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.2 eV. Fig. 2 shows UPS spectra of bare Al, Al treated by 0.6% acetic acid in the water, Al covered by 5 nm PFN and Al covered by 5 nm VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 in the secondary electron cutoff region. WF is defined as a secondary electron cutoff. As a result, the WF values are 4.2 eV for bare Al, 3.5 eV for Al/0.6% acetic acid, 3.3 eV for Al/PFN, and 3.3 eV for Al/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, respectively.
 Fig. 2  UPS spectra of bare Al, Al treated by 0.6% acetic acid in the water, Al covered by 5 nm PFN and Al covered by 5 nm VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 in the secondary electron cutoff region. The work function (WF) is defined as the secondary electron cutoff. 
UPS measurements demonstrated that the WF of Al was decreased due to the treatment of 0.6% acetic acid and coverage of PFN or VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on the Al surface. More importantly, the PCE of Device IV (7.23%) is much higher than that of Devices I (4.77%) and II (5.18%) due to simultaneous enhancement in Voc, Jsc and FF as presented in Table 1. It is clear that introduction of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 between the active layer and the Al cathode results in the improved PCE and the contribution from the solvent (0.6% acetic acid) to the PSC performance is relatively smaller even though 0.6% acetic acid treatment improves Voc and FF as well. Moreover, the PCE of Device IV (7.23%) is also higher than that of Device III (6.99%) with PFN as a cathode interlayer. When PFN was replaced by VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer, Voc increased from 0.755 V to 0.764, Jsc from 15.23 mA cm−2 to 15.31 mA cm−2, and FF from 61% to 62% as shown in Fig. 1a and data in Table 1. We surmise at this point that incorporating VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer can more effectively enhance the PCE of PSCs than incorporating PFN as a cathode interlayer in this study. It should be noted that the working area of all devices shown in Fig. 1 is 4 × 4 mm2. When the device working area decreases from 4 × 4 mm2 to 2 × 2 mm2, the PCE of the PSCs with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer can reach 8.12% due to a Jsc of 16.6 mA cm−1, a Voc of 0.74 V and a FF of 66% as shown in Fig. 3.

J–V characteristics of the device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8/Al) with a working area of 2 × 2 mm2. 

Table 1 also presents series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of devices obtained from the slopes of J–V curves at Voc and Jsc, respectively (Fig. 1a). The Rs and Rsh of only-Al device (Device I) is 15.8 Ω cm2 and 588 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rs (14.9 Ω cm2) and Rsh (526 Ω cm2) of the device based on the active layer treated by 0.6% acetic acid (Device II) are more or less similar to those of Device I. However a decrease of Rs and an increase of Rsh are apparent when PFN or VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 was utilized as a cathode interlayer. For Device III with PFN, the Rs decreases to 10.2 Ω cm2 and the Rsh increases to 1003 Ω cm2. For Device IV with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, the Rs further decreases to 9.6 Ω cm2 and the Rsh increases to 1100 Ω cm2. The increase of the Jsc of the devices with a cathode interlayer is attributed to the resistance changes. The excellent diode quality of Devices III and IV with very low leakage current and high rectification ratio is clearly proved in the dark J–V characteristics.
In the dark, both Devices III and IV exhibit a turn-on voltage around 0.80 V while it is around 0.70 V for the control devices as shown in Fig. 1b. It indicates that the built-in voltage (Vbi) (here considered as a flat-band condition) of the device increases around 100 mV when incorporating PFN or VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer. Because Vbi influences the internal electric field in polymer BHJ solar cells and gives the upper limit for the Voc provided that the WF difference of electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset of the BHJ. Thus the increase of Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in the Devices III and IV with PFN and VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer, respectively. In addition, the electrical leakage for the devices with a cathode interlayer is suppressed because the Devices III and IV have higher rectification ratios at ±1 V than the control devices. As listed in Table 1, the rectification ratios of Devices III and IV are 24827 and 13513, respectively, while that of Device I (only Al) is only 251 and that of Device II (0.6% acetic acid treatment) is 7546. Device II has a lower leakage current and a higher rectification ratio than Device I, indicating that the solvent treatment can improve the diode quality and FF value.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of various devices from 400 nm to 800 nm are shown in Fig. 1c. The improved PCEs of Devices III and IV are consistent with higher EQE values, which approach 75% around 490 nm. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra are 15.12 mA cm−2 for Device IV and 14.72 mA cm−2 for Device III, which are in good agreement with the Jsc = 15.31 mA cm−2 of Device IV (ca. 1.2% error) and the Jsc = 15.23 mA cm−2 of Device III (ca. 3.3% error) obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination.
Compared to the control devices, Device III with PFN and Device IV with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 show higher FF values as listed in Table 1. It implies that introduction of the cathode interlayer (PFN or VOPc(OPyCH3I)8) effectively improved charge transport ability, in particular for electron transport. In order to confirm that electron transport of PSCs is enhanced when a cathode interlayer is used, we carried out J–V measurements of four electron-only devices, which are Device V (ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/Al), Device VI (ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/0.6% acetic acid/Al), Device VII (ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al) and Device VIII (ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8/Al). As shown in Fig. 4, current densities of devices with a cathode interlayer (Devices VII and VIII) are obviously higher than those of devices without a cathode interlayer (Devices V and VI). It means that the devices with a cathode interlayer have better electron collection and transport properties. More importantly the electron mobility can be measured in the space charge limited current (SCLC) regime as described by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3(1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the active layer, μe is the electron mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the active layer thickness. The above equation holds if the mobility is field independent. Fig. 4b presents our J0.5–V analysis for the four electron-only devices (Device V–VIII), where Vr (the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes) and Vbi (the built-in voltage due to the difference in the work function of the two electrodes at both sides of the active layer) are subtracted from experimental applied voltage.2a,15εr is assumed to be 3.9 in our analysis.2a A straight line going through the origin of J0.5–V curves for the four devices signifies that the mobility is field independent at a field up to 2 × 105 V cm−1. The field independent mobilities calculated from eqn (1) are 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Device V, 3.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Device VI, 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Device VII and 7.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Device VIII (details and parameters in Table S1†). For Devices I–VIII, the thickness of the active layer is 120 nm. The electron-only devices, in which the thickness of the active layer is 170 nm, displayed a similar mobility feature (see Table S1†). It is apparent that the incorporation of a cathode interlayer increases the electron mobility up to one order of magnitude and the sequence of the electron transport capability for the four electron-only devices is Device VIII > Device VII > Device VI > Device V. It is in agreement with the increasing trend of FF in PSCs as listed in Table 1. At the same time, in order to prove that introducing a cathode interlayer facilitates a balance of charge carrier transport, we also carried out the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices (J–V curves are shown in Fig. S2†), which are Device IX (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/MnO3/Al), Device X (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/0.6% acetic acid/MnO3/Al), Device XI (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/MnO3/Al) and Device XII (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8/MnO3/Al). According to eqn (1), hole mobilities in Devices IX–XII are 3.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is apparent that a perfect mobility balance of a hole and an electron has been achieved when VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 is used as a cathode interlayer.

(b) J0.5vs. Vappl–Vbi–Vr plots for the same electron-only devices as in (a). 

Fig. 5 shows the surface morphologies obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measured at ambient. The surface of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ film is smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.65 nm (Fig. 5a). However the surface of the PTB7:PC71BM film treated by 0.6% acetic acid in water become smoother due to a RMS roughness of 1.34 nm and remained homogeneous as shown in Fig. 5b. It indicates that no obvious reconstruction of the surface of PTB7:PC71BM blends after 0.6% acetic acid treatment. These observations are similar to the PCDTBT:PC71BM blends treated by methanol10a and slightly different from the PTB7:PC71BM blends treated by methanol, which did not cause an observable change in morphology and the roughness of the film.16 Therefore the improvement of Voc and FF in the Device II with 0.6% acetic acid treatment is hardly related to the change in morphology. When an ultrathin PFN film in the Device III is spin-coated on PTB7:PC71BM blends, the RMS roughness of the surface becomes 3.41 nm (Fig. 5c), indicating that PFN has a good film forming property on PTB7:PC71BM blends. However, the VOPc(OPyCH3I)8-treated surface of the PTB7:PC71BM blend shows a much rougher morphology with a RMS value of 9.34 nm. Notably, there are some visible islands distributed over the surface. The formation mechanism of the islands may be the self-aggregation of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 itself. This is probably due to its high polarity and adverse wettability of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 aqueous solution on the hydrophobic active layer. Moreover we found that the RMS roughness of the VOPc(OPyCH3I)8-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM increased with the development of time. As rough morphology is usually adverse for the device performance, the AFM result implies the great potential of VOPc as a cathode interlayer in PSCs.

In order to check the surface polarity, measurements of the water contact angle (θ) were performed on the surface of PTB7:PC71BM, PTB7:PC71BM/0.6% acetic acid, PTB7:PC71BM/PFN and PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8. The images were collected with a digital camera. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM treated by 0.6% acetic acid are largely hydrophobic, and the water contact angles of which are 101.7° and 100.8°, respectively. It indicates that 0.6% acetic acid treatment only slightly changed the surface polarity of PTB7:PC71BM. However when PFN was spin-coated on the PTB7:PC71BM film, the surface becomes slightly hydrophilic (θ ≈ 82.7°, as shown in Fig. 6c). In contrast, the surface of PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 is hydrophilic due to θ ≈ 50.3° presented in Fig. 6d, indicating that accumulation of an ionic component at the topmost organic surface and a dipole layer exists on the surface. The VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 interlayer induced the decrease of the WF of Al, and also demonstrated the formation of an interfacial dipole layer. The detail microscopic mechanism of the interfacial dipole remains unclear so far. However, the extensively accepted viewpoint is that the interfacial dipole can improve the charge transport, extraction and Voc of the solar cell.2a,b,8–11 Therefore, the PCE increase should be mainly attributed to the formation of the interfacial dipole layer in the solar cell. It is worth noting that other mechanisms including n-type doping of contacted PC71BM by anions of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8,17 the integer charge-transfer mode, electron cloud push-back effects and so on cannot be ruled out now.18

Four kinds of solvent conditions (methanol, methanol + 0.6% acetic acid, water, and water + 0.6% acetic acid) have been employed to dissolve VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 for the interlayer preparation. As a result, the device performance was best when 0.6% acetic acid was added into water as a solvent of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8. It was demonstrated that the introduction of a small amount of acetic acid could improve the polymer solar cell performance.2a,b,9c So far, a precise mechanism for the result in this study remains unclear. We suppose that an addition of a small amount of acetic acid may give rise to partial protonation of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 molecules that may consequently influence the microstructure of the interlayer.19 On the other hand, the residual trace of acetic acid in the interlayer may react with aluminum cathode, which should affect the property of the interlayer.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel cathode interlayer, VOPc(OPyCH3I)8, has been synthesized and successfully utilized in the PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM as an active layer. Compared to the two control devices, a simultaneous enhancement in Voc, Jsc and FF of the PSC with VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a cathode interlayer has been observed. As a result, a PCE of 8.12% for the working areas of 2 × 2 mm2 and a PCE of 7.23% for the working areas of 4 × 4 mm2 have been achieved. They are comparable with the higher values of PCE of the PSCs reported currently. It indicates that VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 is a new promising candidate as a good cathode interlayer for highly efficient PSCs. Recently, we have demonstrated that not only phthalocyanine but also other classes of organic conjugated molecules modified with poly-N-alkylpyridine anions can be employed as cathode interlayers to significantly improve the performance of PSCs. These results will be reported elsewhere. Therefore, the modification of organic molecules with poly-N-alkylpyridine anions should be an efficient strategy for the design and synthesis of high-performance alcohol/water soluble organic cathode interlayers that can be employed to fabricate high performance polymer solar cells.
