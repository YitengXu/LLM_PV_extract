    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractFive novel small molecules were designed and synthesized to investigate the relationships between molecular structures and photoelectric properties. Firstly, three A1–A–A1 type molecules, incorporating a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit with no, one or two fluorine atoms as the core, 2-ethylhexyl-substituted phthalimide (PI) as the terminal moiety and ethynyl functionalized thiophene as the π-linker, were synthesized to explore the effect of fluorination on photoelectric properties, namely (PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT. By introducing fluorine atoms on the molecular backbone, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be tuned efficiently, with minimal influence on optical absorption. Next, on the basis of the BT-based molecules, two extended molecules containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were constructed, namely (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI, improving optical absorption successfully, especially for FADPPPI with an absorption edge of 850 nm in the film. Considering the photoelectric properties of the above five molecules, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was chosen as the electron donor material to pair with these molecules, and preliminary device fabrication and investigation of photovoltaic performances were performed. These results demonstrate that our materials show great potential in being small-molecule acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs), and further research on device fabrication and optimization is in progress in our laboratory.
Introduction
As a promising candidate to provide clean and renewable energy, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much research interest and developed rapidly owing to their unique superiorities of low weight, low cost and flexibility, enabling the achievement of a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17%.1–4 Fullerene derivatives have been dominant electron acceptors in OSCs for the past few decades, and their success is attributed to their outstanding electron-accepting and charge transport properties.5,6 However, some intrinsic drawbacks, such as poor optical absorption, high-cost purification and difficulty in modifying chemical structures and energy levels, have restricted the further improvement of their photovoltaic performance.7,8
Non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NSMAs) are believed to be the best alternative to fullerene counterparts, showing great development prospects.9,10 By virtue of the easier modulation of optical absorption and energy levels relative to that of fullerene acceptors, OSCs employing non-fullerene acceptors have potential in realizing a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), and in turn higher power conversion efficiency (PCE).11–13 Through recent years of exploration, considerable progress has been made in the area of small-molecule acceptors, which has pushed the highest PCE of photovoltaic device based small-molecule acceptors to 14.57%.14
Successful small-molecule acceptors all have similar features, including great optical absorption properties, appropriate molecular energy levels that match well with those of donors, suitable solubility and crystallinity.15,16 As a powerful strategy of molecular design, fluorination on conjugated small molecule and polymer backbones has been shown to enable preparation of efficient photoactive-layer materials, improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.17 On the one hand, since the fluorine atom has a small size and strong electron-withdrawing character, fluorination on molecular backbones can decrease both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels with minimal undesirable steric effects, while exerting little influence on bandgaps.18,19 On the other hand, the intramolecular or intermolecular interactions caused by non-covalent bonds (F⋯S and F⋯H) lead to enhanced planarity and crystallinity of conjugated molecules, which will be conducive to forming a fine film morphology, facilitating charge transport.20,21 In recent years, small-molecule acceptors containing fluorine atoms, especially A–D–A type acceptors with fluorinated terminal units, have attracted much attention, and high-efficiency OSCs employing fluorinated acceptors have been reported successively.5,22 For instance, OSCs based on fluorinated INIC3 reported by Zhan and co-workers, achieved a higher PCE of 11.5% than that of INIC without fluorine atoms (7.7%).23 Hou et al. replaced the methyl group on each end-capping unit of INIC with two fluorine atoms to synthesize INIC3, which improved the PCE of the corresponding device from 10.5% to 13.7% successfully.9 Depending on the advantages of a strong electron-withdrawing nature, and ease of synthesis and purification, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) has been one of the most popular units used to construct photovoltaic materials, and BT-based OSCs have provided PCEs of over 10%.24,25 However, small-molecule acceptors based on fluorinated BT units have been seldom reported.
Extending the molecular π-conjugation system to improve light absorption without sacrificing suitable LUMO levels has been an efficient strategy for achieving a balance of molecular design.26,27 In 2017, the research group of Chen changed the terminal groups in FDICTF from phenyl-fused indanone to naphthyl-fused indanone, which caused an enhancement in the absorption maximum from 665 nm to 697 nm while having almost no impact on molecular energy levels, thus contributing to a PCE of 11.2%.28 On the basis of DPP7, DPP8 designed by Sharma and co-workers, in which an additional N-phenyl carbazole was introduced on the terminal unit to enlarge the molecular backbone, exhibited a broader absorption profile and similar LUMO level, and thus an increased PCE of up to 7.19% was obtained.29
In this work, five novel small molecules have been designed and synthesized to fully investigate how to tune molecular photoelectric properties efficiently through structural design and modifications. Firstly, we chose BT units with no, one and two fluorine atoms as the core, respectively, 2-ethylhexyl-substituted phthalimide (PI) as the terminal moiety and ethynyl functionalized thiophene as the π-linker that was used to bridge them, and constructed three linear molecules of the A1–A–A1 type, namely (PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT. By means of the effect of electron-deficient units in molecules and fluorine atom incorporation, the three molecules can guarantee low-lying LUMO and HOMO levels, satisfying the requirements for the preparation of acceptor materials, while their absorption maxima in solution were limited within 500 nm. In order to improve the shortage of optical absorption, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) having broad absorption and strong electron-withdrawing ability was used as the central unit to replace the BT unit, yielding the molecule (PIAT)2DPP, which caused the molecular absorption maximum to shift to 619 nm successfully. Based on (PIAT)2DPP, we continued to extend the molecular backbone by inserting fluorene as the core, and synthesised a A1–A–D–A–A1 type molecule, FADPPPI, whose absorption ability could be further improved. The photoelectric properties of the five molecules were fully investigated by employing theoretical calculation, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Considering the properties of the above five molecules, OSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor material and the synthesized molecules as electron acceptor materials were fabricated, and their photovoltaic performances were investigated preliminarily (Scheme 1).

Experimental and methods
Reagents and materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless specified. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried by distillation from metallic sodium/benzophenone under a nitrogen atmosphere prior to use.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Solution-processed photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:NSMAs/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned and ultrasonicated in deionized water, methanol, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, sequentially. Then, a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s. After being baked at 140 °C for 15 min, the prepared substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove box. Subsequently, a blend solution of P3HT and NSMAs in chloroform (total concentration of 9 mg ml−1) was spin-coated on top of the prepared ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s. Finally, an aluminium layer as cathode was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (ca. 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask, yielding eight individual devices with 5 mm2 effective area.
Measurements and characterization

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz spectrometer, using CDCl3 as the solvent and TMS as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was undertaken on a MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the synthesized NSMAs in chloroform solution and film state were recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted using a CHI610D electrochemical workstation from CH instrument, Inc. and recorded in 0.1 M anhydrous CH2Cl2/Bu4NBF4 solution under a N2 atmosphere, selecting the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as an internal standard. Moreover, the glass-carbon electrode, Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of MeCN) and platinum wire electrode were employed as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. By means of the measured onset oxidation potential (Eox) and onset reduction potential (Ered) relative to Ag/Ag+, and Eferrocene1/2 = 0.05 eV versus Ag/Ag+, the corresponding energy levels (HOMOCV and LUMOCV) and the electrochemical band gap (ECVg) could be obtained according to following empirical equations: LUMOCV/HOMOCV = −[Ered/ox − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] eV and ECVg = LUMOCV − HOMOCV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA Instruments-Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Instruments-Q20 differential scanning calorimeter under a N2 atmosphere with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a D/MAX-2400 X-ray diffractometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of photovoltaic devices were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit under the simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated with the standard silicon solar cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of photovoltaic devices were measured with an integrated system (Newport, America) in monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp, and the light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was conducted using a DI Nanoscope Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes for (PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT, (PIAT)2dfBT, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI are shown in Scheme 2, and the synthetic details of intermediates S5 and S6 are summarized in the ESI.† Compound 1 was prepared by the ammonolysis reaction of 4-bromophthalic anhydride and 2-ethylhexan-1-amine. Next, Sonogashira coupling of compound 1 and trimethylsilylacetylene took place in the presence of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI and triethylamine, generating compound 2 in a yield of 94%. In a mixture of methanol, tetrahydrofuran and K2CO3, compound 2 was further converted to compound 3 with a yield of 56%. Compounds S1–S4 were synthesized from 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 5-fluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole, 4,5-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole and 2-thiophenecarbonitrile via three steps, respectively, according to our previous report and literature procedures.31–33(PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT, (PIAT)2dfBT and (PIAT)2DPP were obtained by Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions via compound 3 with intermediates S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively, which gave a yield of 63%, 77%, 61% and 70%, respectively. Similarly, by the Sonogashira coupling reaction of compound S5 and S6, FADPPPI was synthesized in a yield of 47%. Five target products were fully characterized by HRMS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. Benefiting from alkyl chains in the molecules, the five synthesized materials possess good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran, which satisfies the requirements for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic devices. Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to investigate the thermal stability of the five materials by measuring the decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td). Fig. 1 shows that Td of (PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT, (PIAT)2dfBT, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI is 439 °C, 451 °C, 395 °C, 406 °C and 280 °C, respectively, suggesting their fine thermal stability for photovoltaic device applications. In the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, the five compounds have high melting transition temperatures ranging from 216 °C to 229 °C, and the corresponding curves are described in Fig. S20 (ESI†).

Theoretical calculations
With the goal of predicting the ground-state geometries, energy levels, electron-density distribution and absorption properties of the synthesized molecules, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD-DFT) calculations were performed by means of Gaussian 09 using the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6-31G(d) basis. Alkyl chains were replaced with methyl to simplify the calculation. A summary of the calculation and calculated data are listed in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively, while the data of electronic transitions acquired from TD-DFT calculation are summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.†

As shown in Fig. 2a, for the three molecules based on the BT unit, the electron densities of the HOMO and LUMO were distributed over the whole molecular backbone, promoting efficient electron delocalization.8 Unlike the BT-based molecules, the HOMO of (PIAT)2DPP was mainly located on the central DPP unit, while the LUMO was distributed over the entire molecule, facilitating an effective intramolecular charge transition (ICT) from the DPP core to the terminal PI units. Whereas in the case of FADPPPI, the electron density of the HOMO was dispersed over the whole π-conjugation system, and the LUMO was located on the DPP moieties as well as end-capping PI units, which indicated that an ICT from the central fluorene to DPP and PI units existed in FADPPPI. In addition, all five molecules possessed nearly planar backbones, which should favor forming closed π–π stacking, thus contributing to charge transport.34,35 Especially for the BT-based molecules, owing to non-covalent interactions present in the fluorinated molecules, the dihedral angles between the core and adjacent thiophene of (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT (0.3°, 0.1°) were smaller than that of (PIAT)2BT (1.7°), indicating that (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT have stronger intermolecular interaction, which was proved by the their fine crystallinity determined from the XRD patterns (Fig. S21 in ESI†).
 Fig. 2  The summary of theoretical calculations for the five compounds: (a) calculated energy levels and electron-density distribution; (b) side view of molecular structures; (c) top view of molecular structures; (d) predicted optical absorption profiles and electronic transition. 
With respect to the optical absorption properties of these compounds, two primary bands were observed in the predicted absorption profiles shown in Fig. 2d. The absorption bands at long wavelength were caused by the electron transition from HOMO to LUMO, while the short ones for the BT-based molecules, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI correlated with the electron transition from HOMO to LUMO+2, HOMO−2 to LUMO and HOMO−3 to LUMO+1, respectively. Moreover, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI with extended structures showed broader absorption profiles and a redshifted maximum absorption peak (λmax) relative to the BT-based molecules, suggesting the feasibility of the design strategy that we took. Although theoretical calculation and experiments can provide discrepant results, theoretical calculation, as an important reference, still plays a crucial role in guiding the design of new materials.
Photophysical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the five compounds in chloroform solution and thin film cast from chloroform are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1.

In solution, the three molecules containing BT units exhibited similar absorption profiles covering the 300–550 nm wavelengths. The absorption bands within 400 nm were caused by the π–π* transitions, while bands in the longer wavelength regions were ascribed to ICT effects, along with the λmax of 489 nm, 483 nm and 475 nm for (PIAT)2BT, (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT, respectively, suggesting that fluorination on molecular backbones has little effect on the ability to absorb photons. Compared to the BT-based molecules, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI, containing an increased conjugation degree, had stronger and broader absorption profiles from 300 nm to 700 nm, and their λmax redshifted to 619 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of 6.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 625 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of 7.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively, owing to the stronger ICT effects.
From solution to film, much broader absorption profiles were observed for these molecules, resulting from enhanced π–π interactions in the solid state caused by their excellent planarity. Especially for (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI, the absorption edges were over 800 nm, and an additional absorption peak at 790 nm was observed in the absorption profile of FADPPPI. Furthermore, the optical bandgaps estimated from the absorption edges in the film (Eoptg = 1240/λedge (eV)) are 1.89 eV for (PIAT)2BT, 1.90 eV for (PIAT)2fBT, 1.93 eV for (PIAT)2dfBT, 1.52 eV for (PIAT)2DPP and 1.46 eV for FADPPPI, respectively.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to investigate the frontier orbital energy levels of the five molecules, and the corresponding curves and data are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, respectively.

The HOMO/LUMO energy levels calculated from the onset potentials of oxidation (Eox) and reduction (Ered), were −5.59 eV/−3.71 eV for (PIAT)2BT, −5.69 eV/−3.76 eV for (PIAT)2fBT and −5.82 eV/−3.83 eV for (PIAT)2dfBT, respectively. We noted that with increasing the number of fluorine atoms in the molecules, the HOMO and LUMO levels become increasingly reduced, which is consistent with the results acquired from theoretical calculations. The measured HOMO/LUMO energy levels for (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI were −5.37 eV/−3.74 eV and −5.30 eV/−3.71 eV, respectively. The above results demonstrated that upon extending the conjugation backbones from the BT-based molecules, (PIAT)2DPP to FADPPPI, the upward trend in HOMO levels is more evident than that in LUMO levels, thus decreasing the molecular bandgaps and minimizing the influence on the LUMO levels. By virtue of the electron-donating effect of the central fluorene, FADPPPI with an extended A1–A–D–A–A1 type structure, showed the highest HOMO level and LUMO level, as well as the lowest bandgap of the five molecules.
As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the five compounds, which are lower than those of P3HT over 0.3 eV, respectively, can match well with those of P3HT, providing sufficient driving forces for exciton dissociation.36–38 The results indicated that the five molecules as acceptor materials have potential in fabricating solution-processable OSCs with P3HT as the donor material.

Preliminary investigation of photovoltaic properties
The five synthesized molecules were chosen to preliminarily investigate photovoltaic performance, and photovoltaic devices employing the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:NSMAs/Al were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of OSCs under illumination of AM 1.5 G. (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S22a (ESI†), and the pertinent device parameters acquired from the OSCs without any optimized treatments are summarized in Table 2. When blended with P3HT, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI showed a PCE of 0.02% and 0.10%, respectively, and (PIAT)2BT gave a PCE of 0.51%, with a Jsc of 2.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.21. The device using (PIAT)2fBT and P3HT exhibited a higher PCE of 0.70%, with a Jsc of 3.03 mA cm−2, a high Voc of 1.01 V and a FF of 0.23. Notably, among these molecules, (PIAT)2dfBT realized the highest PCE of 1.04%, which was two times higher than that of the nonfluorinated molecule, when applied in OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the five photovoltaic devices based on P3HT and the small molecules are shown in Fig. 6. In the case of the BT-based devices, they exhibited similar absorption bands in the range of 350–650 nm. Especially, a slightly broader and much stronger photocurrent response with the peak value of 27% was observed for the device based on (PIAT)2dfBT, which matched well with the higher Jsc value and PCE. For the two DPP-based devices, they had excellent optical absorption properties, but their EQE values were extremely low, indicating that their low PCEs were possibly ascribed to the process of charge separation and transport.

 Fig. 6  EQE curves of the five photovoltaic devices. 
In order to investigate the morphology of the blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was employed and the corresponding height images and phase images are shown in Fig. 7. The film of (PIAT)2DPP showed severe phase separations with a root mean square (RMS) of 1.24 nm, whereas that of FADPPPI had a relatively uniform and smooth surface with a RMS of 0.38 nm and the phase separation was not obvious, which probably caused inefficient charge separation and transport, resulting in their low PCEs. However, a fine networked interpenetration structure having a RMS of 0.78 nm helped the (PIAT)2dfBT-based device achieve the best PCE among these devices. In addition, Voc for OSCs is related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material, and increasing the energy difference generally enables the enhancement of the Voc value.39,40 Interestingly, (PIAT)2fBT had a deeper LUMO level than (PIAT)2BT, while the Voc value for the (PIAT)2fBT-based device was higher than that of (PIAT)2BT, which was explained by their different film morphologies. As revealed in Fig. 7, compared to the blend film of (PIAT)2BT, an evident phase separation and a networked interpenetration structure was observed in the (PIAT)2fBT blend film, contributing to prolonging the charge carrier lifetimes and decreasing combination losses, and thus resulting in a higher Voc value.41–43

Moreover, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI were also blended with PC61BM to fabricate photovoltaic devices, and the corresponding data and curves are described in Table S2 and Fig. S22b (ESI†). Especially, apart from being an acceptor material, FADPPPI also shows potential in being a donor material. The above results suggest that further optimized treatments of the devices, such as annealing, and adjustment of device composition and structure, are necessary, thus related work will be fully investigated.
Conclusions
In summary, five novel small molecules were designed and synthesized to explore how to tune molecular photoelectric properties efficiently through structural design and modifications. Firstly, three A1–A–A1 type small molecules based on benzothiadiazole with no, one and two fluorine atoms were constructed to investigate the effect of fluorination on photoelectric properties. By introducing fluorine atoms on the molecular backbone, (PIAT)2fBT and (PIAT)2dfBT showed lower molecular energy levels, stronger intermolecular interactions, and a similar absorption profile relative to (PIAT)2BT, which indicated that fluorination on molecular backbones can tune both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels efficiently and minimize the influence on optical absorption. Next, in order to further broaden the absorption range, the strategy of extending the molecular π-conjugation system was employed to synthesize two extended molecules containing DPP. Compared to the BT-based molecules, (PIAT)2DPP and FADPPPI showed similar LUMO levels, as well as stronger and broader absorption profiles, especially for FADPPPI with an absorption edge of 850 nm in the film. Considering the photoelectric properties of the above five molecules, P3HT was chosen as the electron donor material to pair with these molecules, and preliminary device fabrication and investigation of photovoltaic performances were performed. These results demonstrate that our materials are promising candidates as acceptor materials for OSCs. Further research on device fabrication and optimization is in progress in our laboratory, and better photovoltaic performances will be realized in the near future.
