    , Accepted 25th October 2022First published on 2nd November 2022AbstractGraphene and its derivatives (graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), doped graphene, and functionalized graphene (F-graphene) nanomaterials (NMs)) possess unique chemical and physical features, and thus huge efforts have been devoted to their study, achieving substantial advances in fuel cell (FC) applications. Herein, we provide a summary of the latest performance and progress in the synthesis, properties, and application of graphene-based NMs in membranes, bipolar plates (BPPs), and as electrocatalysts in various types of FC technological applications. Specifically, in this review, we explain in detail the effect of introducing an increased electrochemically active specific surface area (SSA) to achieve better electro-catalytic activity toward fuel oxidation and oxidant reduction processes using graphene-based NM dispersions on electrodes. Using materials based on graphene, the problem of the device stack durability and performance degradation brought by the corrosion of the BPPs is highlighted. Graphene-based NMs have demonstrated outstanding performances in different membrane devices with respect to high ionic conductivity and power density. The use of graphene in FC technology has demonstrated admirable performances, and thus has a promising future for industrial applications.
1. Introduction
Concern for the increasing energy demand globally and environmental pollution due to the use of fossil fuels has fuelled the development of renewable and eco-friendly energy alternatives. A renewable hydrogen economy strategy, involving hydrogen generation, storage, and transfer of its chemical energy to electricity is broadly considered a potential solution for the future of renewable energy production and environmentally safe consumption through fuel cell (FC) technology.1,2 FCs are crucial in hydrogen economy for introducing low carbon-based ground and aerial transportation, where it is predicted that the well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced to almost zero after hydrogen is employed to produce renewable energy. Renewable and environmentally friendly sources of energy have attracted global attention due to the need to address the increasing energy demand and environmental pollution due to the use of conventional fossil fuels. Among them, hydrogen economy based on renewable energy sources is widely considered a possible energy future option. However, this technology must be efficient and environmentally beneficial.2 FCs are a type of future novel energy conversion technology that generates electricity when a hydrogen-based fuel source is applied to the system. Given that the chemical energy of hydrogen-based fuels is directly transformed to electricity, FCs are more efficient systems than combustion engines, also reducing the pollutant emissions. Therefore, FCs are regarded as one of the most interesting future technologies for addressing the global energy and environmental concerns and making our lives cleaner and more sustainable.3–17
Generally, a conventional FC consists of an electrolyte (in liquid/solid form) layer sandwiched between two electrodes (Fig. 1(a)).18 The anode surface oxidizes the applied fuel and activated electrons (“e−s”) pass through an external circuit to reduce oxygen at the cathode. To complete the circuit, the produced mobile charge carriers (H+, OH−, CO32−, or O2−) pass through the electrolyte simultaneously. Generally, FCs are categorized into five types based on the electrolytes used in the devices, i.e., phosphoric acid FC (PAFC), polymer electrolyte membrane FC (PEMFC), alkaline FC (AFC), molten carbonate FC (MCFC), and solid-oxide FC (SOFC). PAFC, PEMFC, and AFC typically function at a relatively low temperature (<300 °C) and are appropriate for use in cars and portable applications, whereas MCFC and SOFC may use a variety of fuels owing to their high working temperature (≥500 °C), making them more suitable for stationary applications.18

In the next stage, the conversion of hydrogen into electricity is employed to run FC vehicles (FCVs), which are essential for providing low-carbon transportation in the hydrogen economy, and well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions should be lowered to almost zero when hydrogen is produced from renewable sources.20,21 FCVs and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are frequently compared as the two low-carbon transportation options.22 FCs are energy conversion devices that generally utilize hydrogen as a form of stored energy, whereas batteries are energy storage devices. Due to the higher energy density and faster refuelling times of FCVs than lithium ion batteries (LIBs), hydrogen offers intrinsic benefits as a storage medium. Because BEVs frequently display a significantly lower discharge capacity,23 FCVs are also superior to BEVs in sub-zero temperature settings. In the case of short-range cars (less than 200 miles or 322 km), the FCV costs are currently higher than that of BEVs, whereas for long-range vehicles, especially those with large yearly production rates, the FCV costs are equivalent to or cheaper than that of BEVs (above 300 miles or 483 km).24,25 However, the delivery efficiency of FCVs is significantly lower compared to BEVs, and hydrogen storage and the required infrastructure are still in their infancy.26,27
The general consensus is that FCVs are suitable for heavy-duty and long-distance transportation, and for other commercial vehicles such as forklifts, whereas BEVs are appropriate for light-duty and short-distance transportation (Fig. 1(b) and (c)).28 This is based on the differences in their technical characteristics. The fast technological advancement of LIBs over the past 20-years, together with grid at-home recharging has enabled the BEV industry to expand significantly. Alternatively, in the case of FCVs, there are technological challenges associated with PEMFCs, which are their main part. Additionally, the larger-scale commercialization of FCVs is significantly impacted by the performance, price, and durability of the PEMFC stack. Thus, the development of FCVs is essential to increase their power density.22,29 The second-generation MIRAI (Toyota FCV, 2020) achieved stack power densities of 4.4 kW l−1 and 5.4 kW l−1, an increase of 42% and 54% compared to that realized in the earlier generation, respectively.30 The stack power density objectives for automotive use are about 6.0 kW l−1 and 9.0 kW l−1, respectively, in accordance with Japan's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (Japan NEDO). A PEMFC stack with a power density of 5.38 kW l−1 (with end plates), current density of 2.67 A cm−2, and single-cell voltage of 0.6 V was recently shown by the European Union FC and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (EU-FCH2JU), whose target is 9.3 kW l−1 by 2024.19,31
By producing electricity through the electrochemical oxidation of renewable alcoholic fuels such as glucose, ethanol (EtOH), methanol (CH4O), and gaseous fuel hydrogen created by water splitting, FCs can minimize the demand for fossil fuels. Besides the traditional FC electro-catalysts, for instance mono- and bimetallic expensive metal electrocatalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic activity, graphene, MXene, and graphdiyne have become very attractive options as electrocatalysts due to their easy modification.1,2,32 Regardless of the use of 2D or 3D graphene structure, 2D graphene-based electrocatalysts can be divided into two categories. The first is anodic electrocatalysts for the oxidation of hydrogen in hydrogen-based FCs (HFCs) or anodic electrocatalysts for alcoholic fuels (CH4O, EtOH, and glucose) in alcoholic-FCs. The second is related to cathodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alcoholic FCs and HFCs. Recently, significant research efforts have been dedicated to this field, mainly focusing on use of novel electrocatalytic materials in FCs. However, the material selection for the components of FC devices is complicated by issues including low electrochemical performance, efficiency, and durability. Consequently, the superior chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties of graphene and its derivatives make them suitable alternative materials for application in FC devices. In the following section we discuss the structure, synthesis techniques and applications of graphene-based NMs in detail.
2. Structure and properties of graphene
Generally, graphene is a member of the carbon family, where the application of carbon materials (CMs) spans several different disciplines. Graphene-based nanomaterials (NMs) continue to attract attention and are regarded as promising materials for application in electronics, including FCs and other renewable energy devices, due to their abundant nature. This is because of the distinct electrical and chemical properties of these CMs. CM-based electrode materials are attractive compared to other materials because of their abundant resources, flexible nature of their bonds, light weight, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Carbon-based molecules play a significant role in supporting life on Earth. However, a “low-carbon” lifestyle is important. Carbon is a very attractive element due to its three different hybridizations, i.e., sp, sp2, and sp3 (Fig. 2).33 Thus, in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, research on full CMs has a surged in the last 20 years.

Recently, the design and synthesis of potential low-dimension CMs have become the focus of scientists/researchers because of their abundant nature. Currently, new 2D CMs are being produced by researchers, where the applications of these materials depend on the types of carbon atoms that they possess with a range of morphologies, such as, fullerenes (0D, 1985),35 carbon nanotubes (1D, CNTs, 1991),36 and graphene (2D, 2004).37 Over the past two decades, a variety of carbon allotropes, including CNTs, fullerene (sp2), G (sp2), and diamond (sp3), have been produced via the hybridization of different carbon atoms. Several applications using these materials have been executed successfully. Herein, we only focus only on 2D graphene-based NMs.
Graphene, a 2D NS composed of sp2 linked single-layer (SL) carbon-atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure, has sparked significant interest in the advanced nanotechnological world due to its broad novel application potential. For a long time, it was believed that the graphene-NMs, as single-atomic thick 2D nanosheets (NSs), served as the building block of all other dimensional carbon-compounds and 2DMs.38,39 A few of the notable novel chemical and physical properties of G NMs include high mechanical strength (1 TPa),40 high conductivity,41 and large specific surface area (SSA) (2675 m2 g−1),42 which may rival or even outperform other materials especially single-walled carbon-nanotubes (SW-CNTs) and multi-walled carbon-nanotubes (MW-CNTs).
Graphene doped with foreign components has become crucial in the study of green energy production. Thus, in recent years, significant attempts have been made to capitalize on potential use of graphene-based NMs in FCs. Research on the electrocatalytic applications of 2D graphene-based NMs in FCs is a prominent area in the development of green energy.8–17,43–74 Specifically, graphene-based NMs are good electrocatalyst supports given that they boost the number of active sites and facilitate electron transport in both fuel oxidation and ORR. The primary reason for this is that the modification of graphene NMs often improve the interaction between the graphene nanostructure and loaded materials. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical characteristics of graphene NMs have been thoroughly investigated. The most recent evaluations mostly concentrate on a single application sector related to FCs, such as the ORR, fuel oxidation, membranes, and bipolar plates (BPPs). Because of their good catalytic activity, great tolerance to poisoning, and low cost, metal-free graphene NMs have been shown to be viable candidates for the ORR. Extensive insights have been achieved into the impact of changes in the electrical structure of graphene, doping structures, defects, and functional groups on the performance of FCs. Furthermore, the integration of graphene NMs in polymer membranes increases their ionic conductivity and reduces the fuel crossover. Graphene NMs have strong proton conductivity and are impermeable to water, hydrogen, and methanol as proton-exchange membranes (PEMs). Furthermore, graphene NMs can enhance the current collection, fuel/air distribution, and stability of BPPs in addition to the electrolyte and electrode.
Although several early systematic studies explored graphene NMs and their applications in each FC component, a summary of the most recent discoveries in this field is lacking. Thus, in this review paper, we describe the important functions of graphene-based NMs in the FC electrodes, membranes, electrolytes, and BPPs, highlighting the recent breakthroughs such as 3D graphene-based electrodes and graphene-supported single-atom electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the essential elements influencing the performance of these graphene-based NMs in FCs are carefully investigated. Subsequently, the fundamental mechanics and design techniques are thoroughly examined. Finally, their limits and future research potential are discussed. Here, initially, we summarize the factors affecting the structure and properties of graphene in addition to the methods for their synthesis.
2.1. Structure of graphene nanomaterials
The structure of graphene is basically a layer of graphite that is roughly 0.34 nm thick or one atom thick. The size of an SL of graphite, which may range from nanometers (nm) to centimeters (cm), is determined by the method applied for its synthesis.75 A single graphitic layer may be transformed into 0D fullerene, 1D CNT, or 3D graphite by stacking on top of another layer.38 Mono-atomic or SL graphene refers to an SL of graphite, whereas bilayer (BL) and tri-layer refer to two and three layers of graphene, respectively. For example, few-layer (FL) 2D graphite (FL-graphene), which has 5 to 10 layers, is distinguished from multi-layer (ML), thick graphite, with 20 to 30 layers using terms such nanocrystalline thin graphite.76 It should be noted that larger layered formations should not be considered 2D graphene crystals, but rather as thin film 3D-type graphite.77 This type of graphite, known as SL graphite, is composed of covalently functionalized, sp2 linked carbon atoms organized in a honeycomb-like hexagonal lattice, where van der Waals (vdWs) forces bind the stack layers of graphene in graphite. SL graphene naturally occurs in a folded state similar to a corrugated NS with no stacking due to changes in the temperature.39 In contrast, FL graphene NMs demonstrate a preference for the coexistence of “AB” stacking and “ABC” (with rhombohedral arrangement) stacking, while double-layer 2D graphene NSs exhibit Bernal (“AB”) stacking rather than “AAA” stacking.39,78 Also, different properties will result from different structures, stacking structures, and layer counts.75 Thus, to control the structure of graphene, it is essential to understand its electronic dislocations.79 The mobility of the carbon atoms inside the unit cell is crucial for the continuous growth of nanostructured graphene. Significant efforts have been devoted to obtaining a nanostructured array with particular size, shape, crystallinity, and functionality. Consequently, these materials have been extensively used in electronics, optical devices, electrochemical energy conversion/storage, solar energy harvesting, and other applications. Consequently, several inorganic nanostructures have been combined with 2D graphene NMs to improve their characteristics, which will be explained in detail in the following sections.
2.2. Properties of graphene-based nanomaterials
High strength (130 GPa), high thermal conductivity (3000 W m−1 K−1), rapid theoretical SSA (2600 m2 g−1), and high charge mobility (230000 cm2 V−1 s−1) are a few of the intriguing characteristics of 2D graphene NMs.78 Thus, the scientific community has been inspired to learn more about the uses of 2D graphene NMs as a result of these characteristics. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the application of 2D graphene NMs based on their chemical, physical, mechanical, and electrochemical characteristics is necessary for FC applications.

2.2.1. Electrical property of graphene. 
The electrical characteristics of 2D graphene NMs are well understood. Graphene has Dirac points at the K and K′ sites in reciprocal lattice space, where the unoccupied conduction band (CB) (*π-band) and occupied valence band (VB) (π-band) come into contact, with slight overlap between the VB and CB (Fig. 3(a)).80,81 Consequently, pristine graphene is a unique type of intrinsic semiconductor that acts like Dirac fermions, which are massless relativistic particles (Fig. 3(b)).82 Different numbers of graphene layers result in various band structures, appearance of charge carriers, and overlap between the CB and VB. Due to its parabolic spectrum and incredibly tiny band overlap (1.6 meV), BL graphene can be described as a zero band-gap (B.G) semiconductor with one type of electrons and hole. However, given that charge carriers arise in three or more graphene layers, the band structure becomes considerably more complicated, and the CB and VB begin to noticeably overlap (Fig. 3(c)).83 The electronic conductivity of graphene completely determines its quality; consequently, the higher the conductivity, the better the quality (i.e., lower defect density in its crystal lattice). Defects are used as scattering sites to restrict the mean free path of electrons, preventing charge flow. The immaculate graphene created from 3D materials is fundamentally stable, indicating that no issues will arise even at high temperature, according to Geim and Novoselov.38 Surface charge traps, substrate ripples, and interfacial phonons are examples of the extrinsic sources that have an impact on the conductivity of graphene NMs.84–86

The resulting charge carrier mobility from various graphene extraction procedures is presented in Table 1.93 The ambipolar electric field effect of 2D graphene NMs, which allows the charge carriers to be constantly tuned as electrons and holes even under ambient conditions, is another essential feature.80 In field-effect devices, a positive gate bias raises the Fermi level over the Dirac point and promotes holes to the VB at concentrations of n = αVg (where “α” is a coefficient dependent on the SiO2 layer employed as a dielectric and Vg is the gate voltage).81 The charge mobility of graphene on an insulating substrate is ∼1.5 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K and 6 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 4 K, with charge concentrations of up to 1013 cm2 (combined electrons and holes). Compared to silicon (Si) (1.5 × 1013 cm2 V−1 s−1), suspended graphene has a low-temperature mobility that can approach 2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 and even exceed 2.5 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1.94,95 The charge carriers in graphene NMs can be detected through the special quantum Hall effect (QHE) and Berry's phase.96 The sheet resistance (Rs) is minimal (30 V sq−1), which is a result of the remarkable conductivity of graphene.81

2.2.2. Thermal properties of graphene. 
Graphene NMs are well known as being good conductors of heat and electricity, depending on their category and modified structure, attracting much interest in theoretical and experimental science and industry. Graphene NMs are frequently used in electronic equipment due to the increased performance and reliability of the resulting electrical components; however, their thermal management should be considered. The maximum thermal conductivity of SL graphene and supported graphene at room temperature (RT) was reported to be 5000 W m−1 K−1 and 600 W m−1 K−1, respectively.81 There are numerous reports in the literature on the conductivity of graphene NMs in last few years. For instance, Castro Neto et al.97 studied the essential theoretical issues related to graphene NMs using peculiar 2D Dirac-like electronic excitation. Ma et al.98 reported the current developments of graphene nanoribbons (G-NRs), particularly the longitudinal unzipping of CNTs. In their study, they also included a brief summary of the mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and edge reconstruction properties of capabilities graphene-NRs. The potential development of research on novel graphene NMs including their synthesis, characteristics, applications, and limitations of the current body of knowledge and future research paths was the focus of the study be Choi et al.99 To ensure uniform outcomes, the estimated heat conductivity of graphene NM was recorded. For instance, Baladin et al.100 and Ghosh101 measured the thermal conductivity of graphene-NM using Raman spectroscopy, which was determined to be 4840–5300 W m−1 K−1 (2–5 m diameter) and 3080–5150 W m−1 K−1 (1–5 m diameter), respectively. Additionally, according to Lee et al.,102 the thermal conductivity of suspended pristine graphene NMs ranged from 1800 W m−1 K−1 (at 325 K) to 710 W m−1 K−1 when employing the same experimental conditions (at 500 K). The thermal conductivity of a suspended graphene disk with a diameter of 44 mm was tested using the same approach by Faugeras et al.,103 which was determined to be 632 W m−1 K−1. The conductivity achieved by Balandin was around 8-times that reported by Faugeras et al.100 despite the fact that Faugeras utilized a suspended disk with a diameter that was 9-times larger than that of the 2D graphene-based NMs used by Balandin et al.100 Other testing techniques, including scanning thermal microscopy and use of micro electro-thermal system, in addition to Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the thermal conductivity of graphene NMs is in the range of 10–25 W m−1 K−1. Theoretical estimations indicate that they have a thermal conductivity in the range of 25 to 20000 W m−1 K−1.104Table 2 displays the thermal conductivity of graphene NMs measured under various conditions using Raman spectroscopy, micro electrothermal method, and scanning thermal microscopy. Clearly, the thermal conductivity of graphene shows inconsistent results. This is because several factors, including sample size, synthesis technique, structure, and temperature have an impact on the thermal conductivity of graphene NMs.

2.2.3. Optical properties of graphene. 
The optical characteristics of pristine graphene NMs are distinct because of their linear band structure, zero B.G, and intense interaction of Dirac fermions with electromagnetic radiation. Graphene-based NMs absorb in a broad spectrum range, which is due to their inter-band and intra-band optical transitions. The absorption of graphene NMs from the visible (vis.,) to near-infrared (NIR) range is characterized by inter-band transitions and is frequency independent, as defined by the fine structure constant. Intra-band transitions or free carrier absorption are responsible for the optical response in the far-IR range. Because of the momentum mismatch, direct photon absorption cannot be achieved via intra-band transition. Phonon scattering occurs to conserve momentum, and subsequently a population inversion of free carriers appears around the K-point. The free carrier absorption conductivity has a Drude-like frequency dependence. Plasmonic excitation of charge carriers can modify the far-IR sensitivity to the terahertz region. However, due to the huge momentum mismatch in photons and plasmons, plasmon-assisted light absorption is not permitted in graphene. Alternatively, electrostatic gate coupling and creating graphene nanostructures can stimulate plasmon excitation.140
A SL of graphene absorbs about 2.3% of incident light in a wide frequency range, from far-IR to vis., according to several studies on the optical response of graphene.141,142 The fine structure constant, a = e2/hc ≈ 1/37 (c = speed of light), provides a straightforward formula for the opacity of suspended graphene.143 Additionally, it has been discovered that the opacity increases with the membrane thickness; consequently, each graphene layer contributes an additional 2.3%, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The “G-opacity” is nearly wavelength independent (Fig. 4(b)).143 Although the absorbance of SL graphene is flat between 300 and 2500 nm, it exhibits a peak at 250 nm in the UV region because of the inter-band electronic transition from its unoccupied π*-states (Fig. 4(c)).144 The optical transition of graphene can also be altered by altering the Fermi energy.145 Electrical gating and charge injection in graphene optoelectronic devices were projected to lead to the development of tuneable IR detectors, modulators, and emitters.146 There has been significant interest in new photonic devices by combing the optical and electrical transport capabilities of graphene. Additionally, SL and FL graphene NMs with zero B.G and huge area can be used as ultrafast photodetectors, according to a previous discussion.147

The density of electrons and holes, temperature, and light absorption on the surface can affect the generation of electron and hole pairs, which can recombine very quickly (picoseconds).148 Additionally, when external and internal fields are applied close to the electrode and graphene contact, the electrons and holes may be separated, producing a photocurrent.147,149 Another feature of graphene NMs has been suggested to be photoluminescence. It is feasible to make graphene NMs luminous by introducing an appropriate B.G. Specifically, two methods have been proposed to achieve this, where the first technique involves breaking graphene NSs into NRs and quantum dots (QDs), while the second technique involves physically or chemically treating the electron network of graphene to reduce its association with other gases.150 For instance, photoluminescence can be generated by treating SL graphene on a substrate with oxygen plasma. Consequently, etching the top layer without damaging the underlying layer can create a hybrid structure.150 The structure of GO-based NMs is exceedingly disordered and shows various oxygen functional groups, namely, hydroxyls and epoxy, on the basal plane and a tiny quantity of carboxyls, carbonyls, and lactones at the margins, resulting in low electrical conductivity. The structure of GO NMs is shown in Fig. 4(d). The presence of these oxygen-rich functional groups has certain advantages for employing GO in the production of optoelectronic devices. Because of the presence of oxygen functional groups in GO, it is hydrophilic, forming stable dispersions in polar solvents and serving as a precursor for the production of graphene. GO-based NM dispersions may be placed on any hydrophilic surface. Fig. 4(e) depicts the IR spectra of GO, where the very significant band in the range of 3000–3700 cm−1 is caused by the stretching modes of the adsorbed/intercalated water and hydroxyls and carboxyls. The other GO vibrational modes are related to oxygen-containing functional groups, such as ketonic species (1650–1750 cm−1) and carboxyls (1600–1650 cm−1) and asymmetric vibrational stretching of CC coupled with water bending modes (1500–1600 cm−1) and epoxides (1230–1320 cm−1 and 850 cm−1). The spectral overlap region (850–1500 cm−1) is divided into three regions, i.e., α-region (900–1100 cm−1) for all ether derivatives, β-region (1100–1280 cm−1) for ketonic species including peroxides and pyran, and γ-region (1280–1500 cm−1) for epoxides. GO NSs are made up of tetrahedral sp3 carbon atoms with oxygen groups interleaved with un-oxidized graphitic sp2 carbon atoms (Fig. 4(d)).140
The chaotic structure of GO may be partially transformed to graphene-like NSs by eliminating its functional groups and restoring a conjugated structure. Generally, GO-based thin films are insulating, with a large energy B.G in the density of states (DOSs) and sheet conductivity of 1012 Ω sq−1 or higher. Thermal annealing in a vacuum or inert gas environment, exposure to hydrazine vapor or sodium boro-hydride, or laser heating can be used to reduce solution-processed GO films. The structure of rGO is defined as nanometer-sized graphitic islands separated by oxidized graphene. This asymmetric distribution of graphitic domains and oxidized sp3 domains in rGO violates the symmetry and opens a B.G. Because there are overlapping areas of mid-gap states, the B.G is a transport gap. The optical response of rGO is determined by the size of its graphitic domains and oxygen functional group coverage. Shen et al.152 examined the optical absorption of rGO in the IR to UV range. The optical absorption in the IR and vis regions was roughly 2.5–3.5%, which is comparable to that in the graphene layer. There was a noticeable peak in the UV area, which shifted from 5.1 to 4.5 eV with a decrease in the content of rGO. Theoretical studies indicate a linear drop in the B.G as the oxygen concentration of GO decreases. The UV absorption in rGO is caused by π to π* transitions, with values of 4.8 eV and 5.2 eV when the oxygen functional group coverage was 25% and 75%, respectively. Carbonyl groups are primarily responsible for the plasmon peak shift. Un-rGO has a high concentration of hydroxyl and epoxy groups with a low concentration of carbonyl groups, whereas rGO has a higher concentration of carbonyl groups. An increase in the content of carbonyl groups creates vacancies in graphene, where an increase in vacancies causes graphene sheet tearing and a reduction in B.G compared to functionalized graphene.140
The IR spectroscopic experiments by Acik et al.153 experimentally showed the production of carbonyl groups in rGO. The IR spectrum of GO and rGO NMs annealed at 180 °C (denoted as rGO-180) was evaluated, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Thermal annealing reduced the strength of the vibrational modes in the range of 3000–3700 cm−1 by removing the hydroxyls and adsorbed/intercalated water molecules from GO. In the case of rGO-180, the water modes disappeared but the oxygen-containing species remained. The vibrational peak in proportion to the ketonic area (1650–1750 cm−1) was elevated to some extent, indicating that carbonyls are formed during the elimination of hydroxyls through a free radical reaction. After mild thermal annealing up to 200 °C, the trapped water between the neighboring layers of GO drastically impacted the chemistry of ML graphene.154 The interlayer nano-spacing of stacked GO was confined water molecules, where the production of faults and carbonyl groups in ML graphene is aided by this restricted water. Subsequently, further annealing at 400 °C eliminated the oxygen functional groups and trapped water, resulting in the formation of defect graphene structures (Fig. 4(e)). Consequently, controlling the reduction and trapped water enables the electrical and optical characteristics of GO to be adjusted.140


2.2.4. Mechanical properties of graphene. 
The outstanding mechanical characteristics of graphene NMs are a result of the stability of their sp2 bonds, which create a hexagonal lattice and avoid any deformation in the in-plane. Hone and colleagues155,156 performed AFM nano-indentation (Fig. 5(a)) to assess the mechanical characteristics of free-standing SL graphene for the first time. The authors employed a force displacement response from graphene NMs with the intention of determining their elastic characteristics and breaking stress (Fig. 5(b)). Consequently, it was discovered that the force-displacement curves were independent of the tip radius, whereas the breaking force was susceptible to the tip radius but not membrane size. The maximum stress can be calculated using the equation σ2Dm = (FE2D/4πR)1/2 (where E2D is second-order elastic stiffness, R is the tip radius, and F is the applied force). The use of this equation results in the construction of third-order elasticity, which is related to the breaking force, leading to the calculated breaking strength of 55 N m−1, which cannot be regarded as correct. Assuming that the effective thickness is about 0.335 nm, this equation demonstrates that graphene NMs have a Young modulus of E = 1.0–0.1 TPa. Additionally, Hone and colleagues tested the intrinsic strength of defect-free SL graphene NMs, and the results suggested that the breaking strength of the SL membrane was 42 N m−1, which is equal to a strength of 130 GPa.156 For the investigation of the mechanical characteristics of graphene NMs and their application, a variety of methods have been used but more experiments should be conducted in the future.

3. Techniques used to synthesize graphene-based nanomaterials
The number of layers, defect and impurity content, solubility, lateral size, and surface chemistry are a few examples of the attributes, morphology, and structure of graphene NMs that are dependent on the utilized synthetic process. Fig. 6 demonstrates the two types of methods for the synthesis of graphene NMs, where one is the top-down and the other is the bottom-up-synthesis technique with almost 7 sub-classes of graphene synthesis techniques, which are further divided into 6 other classes. Based on these synthesis classes the obtained results are listed in Table 3, which also summarizes the advantages/disadvantages of several techniques for the synthesis of graphene NMs. The methods that are most commonly employed including mechanical exfoliation, chemical synthesis, epitaxial growth of graphene, wet chemical synthesis, and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) will be covered in this study in the following coming section.

3.1. Mechanical exfoliation method

3.1.1. Micromechanical cleavage or solid-phase exfoliation. 
One of the top-down procedures is mechanical exfoliation, where a transverse or longitudinal structure is generated over a layered structure. Weak vdWs forces hold the layers of graphene together in the form of the bulk structure of graphite, where the interlayer bond distance and bond energy are 3.34 nm and 2 eV nm−2, respectively. A layer of graphite must be extracted with an external force of 300 nN m−2 or more.176 The raw graphite precursor can be exfoliated to create NFs or NSs of graphene. In 2004, the publication by Prof. Novoselov et al.177 indicated that graphene can be produced via the repetitive usage of a technique known as micromechanical cleavage, or, more frequently, the Scotch tape approach. The micromechanical approach is simple to perform and does not require any additional tools, where just a piece of adhesive is laid on surface of graphite and peeled off. The graphite layers that adhere to tape are split at the crystal plane. By pushing a clean piece of tape against the graphite layer that is adhered to another piece of tape, more micromechanical cleavage is necessary to create FL and SL graphene NMs. To create thinner layers, these two pieces of tape are separated and the process repeated to get the appropriate graphite sheet thickness.
Optical and Raman spectroscopy and AFM are frequently used to characterize graphene produced via mechanical exfoliation (Fig. 7(a)–(c)). The next step in processing graphene NSs involves pressing the graphite layers onto a substrate, for example Si or silicon oxide (Fig. 7(d) and (e)). This method may produce a SL graphene NS with a thickness of around 0.4 nm and a lateral dimension of about microns.179 However, although this approach is straightforward, it is limited with respect to the charge mobility, purity, defects, and optoelectronic sample quality. Furthermore, this approach results in a low yield and throughput. Sonication- and shearing-based techniques are also frequently used to generate the required energy needed to overcome the interactions in the graphite layers.180 The insolubility of graphite invariably results in a broad thickness dispersion and poor exfoliation effectiveness. To achieve a greater exfoliation yield, graphite can be expanded with an increased interlayer distance using a non-oxidation intercalation process.181,182 For a variety of customer uses that call for high thermal/electrical conductivity, for example, conducting additives and filler-based nanocomposites (NCs) in renewable energy applications, graphene NFs produced by liquid-phase exfoliation have shown tremendous potential, which will be discussed in the next section.

3.1.2. Liquid-phase exfoliation technique. 
The importance of interfacial tension for submerging solid surfaces in liquid media has recently been highlighted. The poor solubility of a solid in a liquid is caused by the high tension at the solid and liquid interface.183 Accordingly, the layer-layer contact can be weakened by increasing the interlayer distance, where the physical agitation of dispersions should also be considered for liquid exfoliation processes.184,185 It was established in 1958 that the oxidation of graphite, also known as “graphite oxide,” may increase the interlayer distance from 3.4 to 7.0 Å. This opening of the interlayer spacing makes it feasible to scatter the individual graphite oxide layers by sonication.
The liquid exfoliation technique is an effective method for transforming pure 2D bulk materials into individual NSs in large quantities. Chemical vapor transfer (CVT) has been used to produce bulk materials since the late 1960s (Fig. 7(f)), although the majority of 2D bulk materials are now only accessible in limited numbers. The distinctive 2D character of bulk materials frequently requires their nano-dispersion into SLs, although easy exfoliation is hampered by the substantial vdWs energy of micron-scale materials. Despite the small vdWs pressure between neighboring layers, it can be difficult to exfoliate graphite into separate layers. Therefore, the vdWs forces between neighboring layers must be overcome for successful exfoliation. One of the most intriguing methods weakening the vdWs forces is liquid plunging, in which the dispersive London interactions add potential energy to the neighboring layers by decreasing the solvent medium in relation to vacuum.186
To separate the graphitic layers and graphene, it is crucial to choose solvents with a high surface tension given that they lower the interfacial tension between graphene and the solvent. Upon chemical treatment with reducing agents and thermal annealing treatment, the graphite oxide layers can be reduced to graphene NSs.187 To separate graphite into graphene-NMs without the use of surfactants, several organic solvents have been investigated, as shown in Table 4. However, employing surfactants can facilitate the exfoliation of graphene from graphite, mainly because the surfactant has elevated adsorption energy on graphene and greater interaction energy with graphene than the solvent molecules. Surfactants also help to stabilize the exfoliated graphene in organic solvents.

Generally, the structure of graphene NSs is seriously damaged during oxidation and reduction processes. However, the interlayer distance may be increased by intercalating ions and molecules in the layers to prevent this from happening. By applying a negative and positive bias, electrochemistry permits efficient cation and anion intercalation in an electrolyte solution. In liquid or vapor phase, organic solvents, alkali metals, and surfactants with surface energies comparable to that of 2DMs may also be directly intercalated. After intercalation, materials can be exfoliated into distinct 2D layers by using agitation techniques such sonication, homogenization, and microwave action. 2D NSs can be mass-produced at RT and atmospheric P using liquid exfoliation. However, this method also results in uneven NS thickness and damage that is apparently unavoidable. The surfactants utilized in this method are presented in Table 5.

3.2. Chemical synthesis methods

3.2.1. Reduction of graphene oxide to graphene nanomaterials. 
Another way to produce the required graphene is the reduction of GO NMs via the top-down approach. Initially, GO must be prepared using layered bulk graphite materials before graphene can be synthesized. The preliminary step in the fabrication of GO is the preparation of graphite oxide using oxidizing agents such as sulfuric and nitric acid to produce hydroxyl or carboxyl groups covalently bound to a planar carbon network of graphite. Several methods are used to produce GO, including the Brodie, Staudenmaier, and Staudenmaier–Hoffman–Hamdi methods. However, the Hummers' approach, in which graphite is combined with NaNO3, H2SO4, and KMnO4,188 is the preferred method for production of GO. Following the preparation of GO, the synthesis graphene NMs is the next stage, which may be accomplished using a variety of techniques, such as thermal reduction,189 solvothermal reduction,190 hydrothermal reduction,191,192 and chemical reduction.193 After exfoliation, it becomes FL or even SL GO with a high density of defects.182 GO is a key product category in the graphene industry, given that it is a water-soluble material. By further reducing GO, which can remove the majority of its oxygen-containing functional groups and partially regain its sp2-bonded carbon network,194 small-size graphene NSs can be produced. However, rGO is significantly more disordered with poorer quality than non-oxidized graphene NFs because it has many vacancy defects and Stone-Wales defects. The commercial applications of the resulting rGO include thermal dissipation coatings, conductive additives, and mechanical reinforcement for NC materials.
3.2.1.1. Thermal reduction technique. 
The removal of oxide functional groups from the surface of GO is accomplished using a technique called thermal reduction. A GO stack was reduced by Prof. Aksay's group after it was exfoliated and heated to 1050 °C, which caused its oxide functional groups to emit CO2. The authors reported that exfoliation must occur when the rate of the decomposition of the GO epoxide and hydroxyl sites exceeds the rate of diffusion of the generated gases; specifically, the yielding pressure must be sufficient to suppress the vdWs attractions keeping graphene together. The Hamaker constant was quantitatively evaluated to determine the estimated pressure needed to separate GO-based NSs. It was found that the pressure created was 1–2 orders of magnitude more than the vdWs forces keeping the GO-based NSs together during exfoliation. However, although 80% SL rGO was obtained, it had 30% mass loss, vacancies, and structural flaws, which affected its electrical and mechanical characteristics.22
3.2.1.2. Chemical reduction technique. 
The commonly accepted Lerf–Klinowski model of graphite oxide states that there are numerous oxygen-containing groups, including OH, epoxide, carboxyl and carbonyl groups, with the basal-plane of material being mostly composed of hydroxyl and epoxides. When GO is transformed into graphene NSs, its color changes from brown (GO) to black (graphene). The elimination of the oxygen-containing groups is caused by graphene-NM becoming more hydrophobic/aggregated. An increase in the C/O ratio and conductivity of graphene NMs indicates the reduction efficiency. The reducing agents employed for the chemical reduction of GO are shown in Table 6. The “well-supported” category includes substances that are often used in synthetic chemistry and react with particular oxygen groups. Alternatively, the proposed agents are novel and interact with all the oxygen moieties. The most used reducing agent for the production of graphene NMs from GO195 is hydrazine. Unfortunately, most of the reducing chemicals used, even hydrazine is hazardous. Thus, alternatives to hydrazine have been investigated, and it has been shown that ascorbic acid, better known as vitamin-C, is the only that is comparable to hydrazine with respect to effectiveness and capacity to form rGO.196 The production of rGO with vitamin-C can be performed in organic solvents such as NMP and DMF in addition to only water. Thus, vitamin-C has been revealed to be a better, safer, and more sustainable alternative to hydrazine for large-scale use.

3.3. Epitaxial synthesis of graphene-based nanomaterials
High-quality thin films with the same crystallographic orientation, fine SL controllability, and prevention of wrinkle creation on the wafer scale can also be prepared through epitaxial synthesis methods based on the development of graphene NMs on the Si face of SiC.259,260 The major uses of SiC-derived graphene NMs are still target electronics and RF transistors due to their high fabrication cost. The reuse of SiC wafers is necessary due to their high price, with the incorporation of additional devices. The SiC substrate undergoes thermal breakdown, which results in epitaxial growth of graphene-based NMs.261 The fabrication of graphene NMs was achieved on the 0001 (Si-terminated) and 0001 (carbon-terminated) sides of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC, respectively (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  (a) CVD technique for the formation of graphene NMs, (b) four basic steps of the development of graphene NMs on (c) Ni262 and (d) Cu. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from ref. 263. Copyright (2013), the American Chemical Society. 
When SiC substrates are subjected to heat treatment at about 1300 °C, Si will sublimate,264 which is frequently carried out under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) to avoid contamination.261 Given that the carbon-atoms are prevented from achieving a better rearrangement on the SiC (0001) face, a high sublimation rate of Si prevents the creation of good-feature graphene NMs, which leads to the nucleation and roughening of tiny graphene NFs.261 Emtsev et al.265 conducted an experiment using multiple heating temperature ranges in an environment with a high Ar-pressure. They noticed that the surface morphology improved when Ar was present. This is because SiC prevents the removal of the Si atoms, which lowers the rate of sublimation.265 The gradual development of the SiC (0001) face ends when extremely thin samples, up to a SL, are created during a brief period at a high temperature. However, the development of the SiC 0001 face does not self-terminate and lacks the ability to precisely regulate the sample thickness, resulting in thick samples (about 5–100 layers).266 The other methods to achieve the epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC substrates include segregating carbon-atoms from metal substrates (such as Ni, Pt, and Ru) and decomposing hydrocarbon gas on other carbide substrates (such as TaC, TiC, and WC).81
3.4. Wet chemical synthesis technique
The representative wet chemical production techniques include hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis, where substances are dissolved in an organic solvent or an aqueous solution at elevated vapor pressure and above 300 °C, respectively. Since the first report on the hydrothermal production of small quartz crystals in 1845, diverse NMs have been created in this way (Fig. 9(a)). Early in the twenty-first century witnessed a boom in the wet chemical production of pure 2DMs such as graphene and MoS2, and recently doped 2DMs, NCs, and their heterostructures have also been similarly produced by adding a mixture of precursors and dopants in a solvent to improve the material characteristics for particular devices. For instance, the addition of boron (B) dopants significantly improved the hydrogen evolution process in GO.267
 Fig. 9  (a) Timelines of wet chemical synthesis methods.178 (b–e) TEM and AFM investigations of GO and rGO NMs. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from ref. 268. Copyright (2020), Elsevier. 

3.4.1. Solvothermal reduction method. 
In addition to thermal reduction, another straightforward way to prepare rGO-based NMs is solvothermal synthesis reaction. Specifically, a GO dispersion is put in autoclave reactor, and the applied temperature of the system is increased beyond the boiling point of the solvent. In the autoclave, de-oxidation of GO is facilitated by high temperature and autogenous pressure. Some high-boiling point solvents are used for the solvothermal synthesis of rGO, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)269 and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).270 Yuan et al.190 tested dispersed GO in C3H6O with moderate ultrasonication for 1 h to evaluate the solvothermal synthesis reduction method, followed by the addition of NaClO. The above-mentioned mixture was transferred to an autoclave reactor made of stainless steel, sealed, and heated for 2 h at about 120 °C. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to RT before being cleaned with water and tetrahydrofuran and dried for 24 h in an oven at 80 °C. Consequently, the reduction process removed the bulk of the oxygen functional groups in GO, resulting in the creation of BL graphene. This approach is straightforward, cost-effective, and appropriate for manufacturing graphene on a large scale, according to the authors. The TEM and AFM images of GO and rGO are shown in Fig. 9(b)–(e). Although the height profile from AFM showed that the average thickness of the GO and rGO NSs was about 0.980 nm and 1.101 nm, respectively, the wrinkles in the TEM results showed that the NSs are relatively thin.271,272


3.4.2. Hydrothermal reduction technique. 
Graphene NMs are produced during hydrothermal synthesis by heating the epoxy rings and shattering them.273 To produce rGO, the temperature is typically in the range of 120–180 °C for 1–18 h.274 Oxygen-containing groups are eliminated by the overheated supercritical water acting as a reducing agent, which results in the recovery of the aromatic lattice structure of carbon.275,276 A further factor that requires attention is the pH of the aqueous media. Large graphitic domains are maintained when the procedure is performed at pH = 11, resulting in a stable suspension of graphene with a low content of defects. Alternatively, the aggregation of graphene and even other graphitic nanostructures typically occurs in an acidic environment (pH = 3). In addition, several defects and lower lateral sizes are created. Water acts as a source of H+ for OH protonation during the acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohol.277 In comparison to other chemical reduction techniques, hydrothermal synthesis is a simpler setup, which requires only an autoclave, and produces intrinsically pure and environmentally friendly products. Also, it produces fewer defects because the process recovers the conjugation after dehydration given that it occurs in a closed system at a relatively elevated temperature and P.278 However, the limitation of this strategy is that it is time-consuming.
Wet chemical synthesis is suitable to control the surface shape, crystallite size, and dopants in 2DMs for catalysis, renewable energy production/storage, and chemical/biological sensors. For different types of 2DMs and their NCs, the reaction temperature, precursors, and additives can be tuned, allowing for their practically limitless mass manufacture. It is also feasible to directly synthesize 2DMs on a specific substrate, although this process requires a little more time of up to a few days. Due to the limited durability of apparatus under harsh conditions, such as high P and corrosive chemicals, the growth temperature is frequently restricted to below 300 °C. It should be noted that although the bottom-up synthesis frequently results in low-quality, imperfect 2DMs, it is still viable to use these materials for catalytic purposes.

3.5. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique
For the significant production of 2DMs in large quantities, there are 4 typical bottom-up synthesis methods. The first is the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique. The other three bottom-up thin-film deposition methods including pulsed laser deposition (PLD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have also been studied for the fabrication large-size 2D films. CVD is mainly suitable for industry considering the uniformity and crystallinity of 2D NM-based thin films with high yield, low cost, and scalability. The other two methods being researched for the mass manufacturing of for 2DMs are bottom-up wet chemical synthesis and top-down liquid exfoliation.
On a metal surface at a high temperature, the CVD technique may create high-quality, large-area continuous graphene-NM-based thin films.279 This growth approach allows the precise control of the thickness of graphene NMs, although it has a significant energy and financial cost. A significant proportion of the expenditure is the fabrication of the metal substrate and the power needed for heat treatment. In the case of CVD synthesis method-based manufacturing of graphene-NM thin films with significant batch production and continuous growth, the batch-to-batch (B2B)280 and roll-to-roll (R2R) techniques are envisioned as two industrially significant techniques. Two commercial types of graphene-based NM products, i.e., inch-sized graphene wafers and continuous graphene films, are defined by these two commercially viable growth techniques. Between them, inch-scale graphene wafers exhibit greater quality and homogenous graphene growth, providing benefits in terms of scalability and price. Consequently, continuous graphene films can be employed to create transparent conductive films (TCFs) and graphene wafers to fabricate electronic devices. CVD uses the chemical reactions of gas-phase precursors on the surface of a heated substrate to fabricate various-sized thin films. Initially, the CVD technique was applied for the synthesis of Si materials, but later it was extended to 2DMs, for instance, graphene thin films. The most suitable technique for creating high-quality graphene-based thin films on a large scale is CVD.281 The basic CVD method involves the adsorption of reactant gases on the heated substrate or gas-phase reactions to form intermediate reactants, which also adsorb on the substrate. Gas species (such as hydrogen and Ar) are fed into the reactor during the CVD process, which pass through the hot zone, where hydrocarbon precursors (such as CH4) decompose on metal substrates (such as Cu and Ni) to create SL and FL graphene. After the initial or intermediate reactants diffuse to the substrate surface, heterogeneous reactions at the solid-gas interface result in the formation of thin films. The metal substrate serves as an electrocatalyst by reducing the energy needed for breakdown and by establishing the process of graphene deposition, which has a significant impact on the graphene quality.282 The control of the variables in the CVD method for the production of 2D graphene materials, for instance, electrocatalysts is crucial, including the precursors, gas flow rate, applied pressure/temperature, and time (Fig. 10(a)).
 Fig. 10  (a) Timelines of milestones for CVD.178 (b–e) 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC layer stacking, Reprinted (adapted) with permission from ref. 283 Copyright (1990), IOP publishing. 
The four fundamental steps in the CVD technique, which is a complex heterogeneous catalysis scheme, are as follows:
(1) Gas precursor adsorption and catalytic degradation.
(2) Diffusion of decomposed carbon species and dissolving into the bulk metal, both on the surface and in it.
(3) Dissolved carbon atoms accumulate on the metal surface.
(4) Surface growth and nucleation of graphene (Fig. 10(b)).284
There are several instances of the wafer-scale CVD creation of thin films (Fig. 10(b) and (c)). The most popular substrates, besides transition metals (TMs) such as Pt, Co, Ru, Au, and Rh, and alloys such as Cu–Ni and Au–Ni, are Ni and Cu.179 For instance, wafer-scale single-crystal SL graphene was produced using single-crystal substrates such as H-Ge (110) and Cu (111).292,293 Wafer-scale polycrystalline SL and ML graphene thin films have also been effectively produced by the CVD technique on polycrystalline Cu and Ni foils since 2009.294 The wafer-scale fabrication of single crystals based on ML graphene thin films was also accomplished on Si–Cu alloys.295 The CVD procedure with Ni films is presented in Table 7, whereas the conditions for the CVD process with Cu films are presented in Table 8.282 Because Ni has an unfilled d shell and exhibits a certain level of carbon solubility, forming 2D graphene NMs, it has distinct properties compared to Cu (Fig. 10(d)). Alternatively, Cu has weak affinity to carbon and is a filled shell metal, which impedes both the dissolution and subsequent segregation stages (Fig. 10(e)). Then, graphene can be produced by deriving carbon atoms from the hydrocarbon that directly diffuses on the metal substrate (Table 8). S. K. Bae et al.280 invented the R2R CVD approach given that the current method of transferring graphene to metal substrates using etchants is costly, creates hazardous waste, and results in graphene having structural flaws. However, its wider use such as electrical and optoelectronic applications still needs to be improved.

For high-quality thin film deposition, all CVD reactors must precisely regulate the delivery of the gas reactants to a vacuum-sealed chamber and the evacuation of unreacted species and gaseous by-products. The temperature must be high enough, or more energy must be added, for the gas-phase processes to take place (for example, with plasma). Given that different substrate catalytic capacities result in diverse outcomes, substrate selection and pre-treatment are essential for 2DMs to enhance thin film development. In a non-reactive environment, precursors such as hydrocarbons for graphene and oxide powders for TMDs react to form islands that develop and coalesce into a continuous thin film on the selected substrate. The temperature, concentration of active species, surface characteristics of the substrate, and other factors during the nucleation stage affect the nucleation density and nuclei orientation, which dictate the quality of the thin film. Final cooling promotes thin film growth and additional microstructural evolution of the film through wrinkling and folding.
Under atmospheric-pressure or low-pressure, CVD results in the formation of very good 2D films, and by enlarging the chamber, the size of the film can be readily scaled up. However, its industrialization may be hindered due to the requirement of high reaction temperatures (over 500 °C). Currently, there are insufficient precursors for the preparation of a broad range of 2DMs, including graphene, h-BN, and TMDs. The lack of dangling bonds on the surface of 2D vdWs NMs makes epitaxial growth challenging; hence, this method has limited control over the number of produced layers, which may be its biggest technical hurdle. To date, it is still difficult to manage the film stoichiometry and generate high-quality large-area TMD thin films. One type of CVD method (metal-organic CVD) creates consistent wafer-scale, atomically thin films of TMDs, but it has complicated growth parameters and requires numerous precursors. In general, high temperature and high vacuum conditions are required for CVD reactors for the preparation of 2DMs to fracture the precursors into reactive products that can easily form thin films but the residual precursors can seriously pollute the reaction chamber. Another difficulty is transferring films successfully from the target substrate for their growth. High-throughput in situ optical monitoring technologies including confocal laser scanning microscopy and Raman, wide-field Raman, and microwave spectroscopy can be used to improve the CVD procedure.
The crystallinity and freshness of the substrate surface affect the repeatability and dependability of CVD-grown thin films. For instance, to enhance the quality of graphene thin films, copper (Cu) foil is often electrochemically processed and re-crystallized. The homogeneity of the temperature and gas flow inside the CVD reaction chamber is also important for the synthesis of homogenous 2DMs. In the case of dependability, post-CVD treatments are also crucial. For instance, doping of graphene is desirable for real-world applications, but the instability and in-homogeneity of the doping compromise the repeatability. Thus, to advance CVD, new precursors must be developed, the deposition temperature must be lowered, and high-quality, large-scale thin films besides graphene must be consistently grown on a range of substrates for industrial use.
With the advantages and disadvantages of various manufacturing techniques, the graphene-based NM market has seen a significant rise in worldwide fabrication capacity in all three product groups over the past 10 years, going beyond research and development and into global commercialization. Particularly, recent improvements in manufacturing facilities and quality enhancement have led to CVD method-based graphene-based NMs occupying a larger share of the market. Chinese manufacturers, who have consistently increased their production capacity in recent years, have become the largest provider globally. The second-largest country, the USA, offers steadily rising manufacturing capacity. Even with the shortage of graphite, Europe is still in third position. Unfortunately, difficulties arise in the excessive manufacturing of graphene-based NMs, including pervasive inconsistent performances and characteristics. Thus, the road to optimum industrial production is still lengthy. Using China's graphene industry as an example, its capacity for economically scalable manufacturing is sufficient with the production volume of 2000 tonnes per year of graphene-NM powders and 3.5 million-m2 per year of graphene-NM-based thin films. However, in reality, the quality of graphene-NM-based products varies greatly given that it is influenced by the 2D graphene-NM supply, production processes, and fabrication conditions. There are still glaring discrepancies in the NF size and layer count of commercially available graphene-based NM powders, with significant variations in their defect density and impurity concentration. Due to these significant differences in quality, publications on the use of graphene-based NM powders have been overstated, with concerns raised about their inconsistent performance. Similar to CVD-based-synthesized graphene-NM-based films, graphene goods from various producers have drastically varying conductivities. The consistency of CVD graphene NSs varies from B2B.
For industrial-scale applications, the method for mass-producing graphene NMs must be able to deliver the necessary numbers, while guaranteeing consistent quality. However, the current methods for the production of graphene NMs are still inefficient and not cost-efficient.301,302 According to the production techniques, the worldwide market for graphene and its derivatives can be classified into three main product categories, i.e., graphene NFs (non-oxidized), GO or rGO, and graphene films. Graphene NM products show notable variations in impurities, size/thickness uniformity, yield, lateral size, defect density, manufacturing expenditure, marketplace portion, and potential device applications.
4. Graphene-based nanocomposite materials
Numerous graphene NMs can possibly be utilized to create NCs with remarkable qualities given that they feature a variety of novel characteristics.208 The corresponding graphene NM has potential to increase the conductivity and strength of bulk materials and contribute to the development of NCs with better properties. Graphene NMs combined with conductive NCs made of metals, polymers, and ceramics can withstand high temperature and pressure. Graphene-based NCs have demonstrated strong potential for numerous applications. One graphene-polymer based NC was shown to be light, flexible, and possess outstanding conductivity, while another dioxide-graphene NC was found have remarkable photo-catalytic efficiencies. There are many other possible combinations of materials that can one day be used to create various NCs, resulting in endless applications. The possible applications of graphene NCs include medical implants, technical materials for aircraft, renewable materials, and much more. However, the majority of these uses depend on the large-scale, industrial manufacture of synthetic graphene NCs in exceptionally high quality.303 The construction of complex nanoscale structures such as graphene NMs is necessary for more sophisticated applications in nanoelectronics given that they generally transmit electricity and tolerate heat better than bulk materials.
5. Perspectives and challenges in the synthesis of graphene toward industrialization
The aforementioned processes make it possible to produce 2DMs, especially graphene in large quantities, although significant advancements are still needed for some particular applications. Wafer-scale layer control has enabled the practical synthesis of single-crystal graphene NM-based films. Controlling the thickness of these materials is crucial for high-performance electronics and tunneling barriers. Flexible heterostructures with exceptional physical features can be created in 2D systems by mixing adjustable B.G semiconductors with metals and insulators. However, although numerous planar and vertical heterostructures have been created thus far, they are all micron-scale level.304,305 Generally, it is still difficult to generate different heterostructures on the wafer scale (Fig. 11(a)). Atomic saw-tooth surfaces can provide the best growth substrate for single-crystal 2DMs such as graphene and related heterostructures, but surface facet control is still difficult to achieve.
 Fig. 11  Challenges in the mass production of 2DMs. (a) Single-crystal homo/hetero-epitaxial development and wrinkle creation by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch in 2DMs and substrates, where cracking/contamination in the transfer route are the main concerns in the CVD method. (b) Inhomogeneous size and thickness of 2D NSs and low yield are drawbacks of liquid exfoliation. (c) Low durability and instability of 2DMs by defects and environmental pollution are drawbacks of wet chemical synthesis method. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from ref. 306 Copyright (2022), Springer Nature. 
Another significant problem is the development of wrinkles in 2DM-based films during their high-temperature formation, which results from the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch in the growth substrate and 2DMs. Recently, it was revealed that fold-free single-crystal graphene thin films could grow at about 750 °C;307 however, more research is needed to determine that this technique can be used for other 2DMs and low-temperature growth techniques. Due to the incompatibility of existing Si-technology with high-temperature procedures (over 400 °C), 2DM-based thin films generated by the CVD deposition method at an elevated temperature must be shifted on a target substrate. The traditional transfer method may result in major issues including 2D film folding and breaking, eventually reducing the film homogeneity and device performance. Additionally, the impurities in polymers, which are frequently included as a supporting layer for the transfer process, may result in accidental doping and high contact resistance in heterostructure devices and interfaces. Consequently, new techniques for the large-area direct growth of 2D films via CVD or sophisticated R2R transfer techniques are greatly required. The manufacturing process, including scalable methods (R2R, B2B, etc.), production capacity/expenditure, repeatability, and large-area homogeneity, should also be considered.308
For the bulk manufacture of 2DMs, wet chemical techniques such as liquid exfoliation and wet chemical production method also encounter several difficulties. For the mass manufacture of 2D NSs using liquid exfoliation, chemical vapor transport (CVT) or flux techniques are used to create pure 2D bulk materials. However, because these synthetic processes normally take place for at least a week, they reduce the manufacturing throughput, where businesses need to be able to supply these bulk materials on a greater scale. Additionally, using this approach makes it challenging to produce 2D NSs with a consistent size and thickness (Fig. 11(b)). Improved methods (such as density gradient ultra-centrifugation) are required to sort the produced NSs according to their size and thickness to overcome the above-mentioned issues. 2DMs with poor crystal quality are often produced via bottom-up chemical synthesis. The defect sites (i.e., edges) frequently act as active sites in 2D electrocatalysts, but they also cause problems including instability and low durability. Additionally, the size and thickness of the 2DMs produced by chemical synthesis are not dispersed consistently, necessitating extra attention during their synthesis. Also, the by-products routinely produced during chemical synthesis can prevent catalytic activity. Post-treatments such as thermal annealing and purification have been proposed to address these material quality and by-product problems, but a straightforward procedure without post-treatment would significantly increase productivity. The use of supercritical fluid regions may be considered as a facile way to reduce chemical use due to the environmental contamination produced by the significant number of hazardous chemical waste utilized in synthesis (Fig. 11(c)), which is another significant concern.309 Additionally, instruments for quick and accurate non-destructive characterization are crucial for assessing the wafer-scale quality and homogeneity of 2DM samples. The electrical and optical characteristics of 2D NM-based films can be analyzed using the most advanced terahertz image, i.e., phase-shift interferometry, and wide-field Raman imaging techniques, which have short acquisition times per mm2 and high spatial resolutions in the order of micrometers.310 A 12-inch wafer-scale sample still has to be extensively examined over an extended period, and thus the creation of improved characterization tools is still necessary. There is a lot of potential in the materials world for innovative 2D-NMs that have not yet been studied and their vdWs heterostructures. The industrialization and mass production of these freshly discovered 2D-NMs may benefit from artificial intelligence-based material design given that it is very hard to examine all these materials experimentally.311
6. Fuel cell technology
To obtain high electrical power densities required by a wide range of critical applications, FCs are the most promising technology. They achieve their goal by “changing the energy held in chemical bonds into electrical energy.” Specifically, FCs are electrochemical devices that transform chemical energy into electrical energy.312 Due to their exceptional energy density, high efficiency, and few pollutants released, FCs have been the subject of much study for both mobile and permanent applications that generate clean, sustainable and renewable energy. The different types of FCs include alkaline-FCs (AFCs), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) FCs, solid polymer electrolyte FCs (PEMFCs), direct-methanol FCs (DMFCs), phosphoric acid FCs (PAFCs), molten-carbonate FCs (MCFCs), and solid-oxide FCs (SOFCs), which are shown in Fig. 12.

In FCs, their structural arrangement results in an increase in temperature; however, it simultaneously causes an overall decline in effectiveness.313 This is the primary challenge with the many forms of FCs, which each has their own advantages, limits, and novel applications. Consequently, researchers are focusing on cutting costs, while increasing efficiency. In the next section, we summarize the basic working principle of FC devices.
6.1. Working principle and structure of fuel cell devices
The cogeneration unit of FC devices converts hydrogen-based chemical energy into heat and electrical energy.314 Generally, the hydrogen supplied at the anode is used as fuel, while the cathode provides an oxidant. The cell becomes polarized as a result of the hydrogen oxidation process (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which occur on the anode and cathode, respectively.315 At an externally connected load, the current generated by the reactions is measured. The theoretically proposed PCE of FCs is 83% at standard pressure and temperature settings, while accounting for generated heat. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of about 1.23 V has been achieved under these circumstances devoid of any electrical loss. However, the commercially available devices are not very effective and have a low OCV. The decreased performance of FC devices is attributed to their variable working conditions, including temperature and pressure. Additionally, the operation voltage losses significantly diminish their electrode potential and impair their efficiency. Performance problems in FC devices are caused by a variety of dynamics of electrochemical reactions, including the rates and electrochemistry of reactions, inability of gases to reach the reaction active sites, low internal electrical currents, high electrode resistance, and crossover effect.314 Additionally, the efficiency of the cell is impacted by the Ohmic losses, concentration, and activation polarization. The above-mentioned phenomena can be analyzed using the V–I polarization plot based on the entire range of power for FC devices.316 The OCV, current density, Tafel slope, transfer coefficient, maximum power density, and efficiency are some fundamental variables used to calculate the performance of FC devices. The following equation yields the V–I polarization curve:E = Er − RT/αFln(i + iloss/i0) − RT/nFln(iL/(iL − I) − iRintwhere, Er stands for the reversible potential under STP conditions, T denotes the applied temperature, R stands for the ideal gas constant, I is the transfer coefficient, “i0” the exchange current density, “iloss” the current loss, “iL” the limiting current density, “F” is Faraday's constant, “n” is the number of e−s per hydrogen molecule, and “Rint” the internal resistance.314 For FCs to convert energy electrochemically, the gadget must be properly designed. An FC assembly integrates BPPs, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), current collectors, and support components.317Fig. 13(a) and (b) schematically show the structure of an MEA. The parts assembled in Fig. 13(b) provide the functions needed for electrochemical processes and are essential for the functioning of the FC.318 The primary processes in FCs include removal of waste gases and by-products, electrocatalysis for the HOR and ORR, transfer of positively charged ions through the membrane, and electron transference through outwardly attached supporting elements. Fuel and oxidant gases flow at a constant rate over the channel of the BPPs and electrodes.

6.2. Importance of membrane in fuel cell technology
After William Robert Grove created the first FC in 1893, or over 109 years ago, it was rarely investigated. However, in the late 1980s, FCs emerged as one of the greatest alternatives for renewable energy application. The PEM serves as the foundation of FCs given that the other parts of FCs must be constructed in accordance with the characteristics of the PEM.320 However, electrolyte conductance also plays a significant role in the power density and efficiency of FCs. The efficiency of PEMFCs is substantially impacted by the performance of the MEA. Proton conducting membranes have historically been shown to be necessary for the longevity and effectiveness of PEMFCs.321,322 Thus, to improve the performance of FCs, novel polymeric proton conducting membranes are being studied. Nafion is the focus of study, but researchers are currently exploring ways to modify it and other polymers to create optimal membranes for FCs. The proton conducting membrane of FCs must have the following properties:
(1) High proton conductivity.
(2) Chemical and electrochemical stability.
(3) Thermal and hydrolytic stability.
(4) Outstanding water uptake.
(5) Strong chemical attributes.
(6) Limited permeability to reactive species.
(7) Fuel transport resistance.
(8) Reliable mechanical strength and stability.
(9) Extremely robust to make fast electrode kinetics possible.
(10) Adaptable to various fuels and inexpensive.
Additionally, the performance of FCs is significantly impacted by a membrane thickness and water management. In FC devices, the membrane primarily serves two purposes as follows:
(1) It may act as an electrolyte in the cathode and the anode for ionic conduction, but it is an electrical insulator and
(2) it may separate the two reactant gases.
The advancements in membrane technology are now strongly related to the performance of FC devices. However, only a few membranes are currently commercially available and have shown to be beneficial in FC systems, including perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) membranes, Dow membranes, and Nafion (DuPont de Nemours). Dow membranes function noticeably better than Nafion-117, and are also more affordable. However, Dow membranes have several major issues, including an inappropriate water balance and excessive CH4O permeability, and they cost roughly 800 USD. Furthermore, there are significant issues with the typical membranes related to temperature and the need for additional equipment to solve safety issues during their preparation and use. The conductivity of the Nafion membrane decreases at a rate of around 10 times in the temperature range of 600 °C to 800 °C. Corrosive gases and hazardous intermediates develop at high temperature exceeding 150 °C, increasing the safety issues. These issues related to the membranes may restrict the ability of FCs to be recycled and increase the risk of auto accidents.323 Therefore, PFI membranes are not suitable for commercialization in FCs because of their significant disadvantages and high cost. Consequently, finding less expensive polymers is crucial for the fabrication of decent membranes for FCs.
The features of membranes still require the development of their proton conductivity, CH4O crossover reduction, and thermal stability. Thus, to achieve this, new inexpensive polymeric membranes may be the best option. According to Smitha et al.,323 15 membranes out of 60 options can take the place of traditional Nafion-based membranes. However, without functionalizing or altering the membrane, it is difficult to get the necessary qualities. The plain poly(ether ether ketone) was first altered by Hasani-Sadrabadi et al.324 by adding sulfonated groups, which increased the negative functionalities and increased the proton conductivity of the polymer. Then, the sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) membrane was functionalized by adding a customized montmorillonite (MMT) for improved OCV and decreased CH4O uptake. In comparison to Nafion-117 and plain SPEEK membrane, the functionalized SPEEK/MMT-membrane performed better, according to the data. Subsequently, Li et al.325 added phenylidane to a polymer matrix made of polybenzimidazole (PBI), which improved the proton conduction of an electrolyte membrane used in high-temperature FCs. Similar to how Nafion has been altered in other experiments in various ways to improve its performance, Hasanabadi et al.326 synthesized and used Fe2O3 NPs to develop the performance of a Nafion membrane, in contrast to Makinouchi et al.,327 who employed SPI to change the Nafion membrane. Additionally, silica/silicotungstic acid (SiO2/SiWA) inorganic NCs328 and Pd–Si nano-fibers329 were added to Nafion to reduce the issue of CH4O crossover without compromising its proton conductivity in FCs. Similarly, several other studies have demonstrated the significance of membrane functionalization to enhance the performance of FCs. Currently, there is a big market for inorganic fillers for membrane modification in the energy sector.
Among the nano-sized CMs, CNTs have been quite successful in changing the membrane in FCs. However, since the introduction of graphene, the aim of researchers has changed. Graphene has made a substantial contribution to improve the performance of FCs, particularly at the cathode and in separation membranes. Recent research has shown that adding GO-based NMs to PEMs has a positive impact. The fundamental feature of GO is that it is a soft substance with an amphiphilic nature. It possesses exceptional chemical and physical properties with a high SSA. Additionally, GO has interfacial groups such as epoxy, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl that contain oxygen. Acidic groups and hydrophilic sites such as carboxylic acid and epoxy oxygen may enhance the hopping of electrons and the GO hydration.330 Due to the interactions in the intermolecular hydrogen bond and membrane structure, GO can also boost the proton conductivities of GO-NM-based membranes.331 To increase the utilization of graphene NMs as desirable fillers and achieve the required alterations in PEMs, GO-based NSs have been functionalized. Although the uniform distribution of GO NPs is somewhat challenging in some organic solvents because of the higher hydrogen bonding, which causes agglomeration,332 functionalized GO (F-GO) is easily dispersed in diverse organic solvents, enhancing the distribution of the nano-fillers in polymers.333 Additionally, the functionalization of GO can enhance the membrane structure for improved proton conductivity and water retention.334
In the manufacture of membranes for FCs, the significance of graphene has previously been demonstrated. In addition to being employed as a polymer matrix additive or filler, graphene may be present as papers or NSs, which must be assembled during the production of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).335 For energy devices and electrochemical applications, the Hummers' approach is typically favored; however, other methods and their modifications can be employed similarly to that outlined below. Tateishi et al.336 reported that GO NMs exhibit excellent proton conductivity regardless of having low temperature and relative humidity (RH). The main oxygen-containing functional groups in GO, epoxide, act as proton transfer sites after binding with water molecules, even at low RH and RT. The results demonstrated that the proton conductivities are between 105 and 104 S cm−1 at the temperature of 250 °C and RH of 10–20%. GO-based NMs can be employed in a variety of uses, e.g., electrochemical and battery-related ones. Commercial FCs have greater proton conductivity than thick GO paper when the Nafion membrane is completely wet at a high RH (100%). However, given that the thickness of GO films has a significant impact on their proton conductivity, thinner GO films can compete with Nafion membranes. The performance of a GO FC with Pt/C electrodes is shown in Fig. 14, where it is clear that it performed better than the Nafion membrane FC with Pt/C electrodes.

6.3. Various classifications of fuel cell technology
Typically, the working temperature, fuels, oxidants, and electrolyte type are characterized for FCs. Hydrogen–oxygen and ammonia-air FCs are examples of devices based on a particular fuel and oxidant, whereas temperature-dependent FCs are specified for their low/high working temperature, respectively. AFCs, PAFCs, MCFCs, PEMFCs, DMFCs, and SOFCs are various types of FCs based on different electrolytes, according to the most common foundation for the categorization of FCs. The type of electrocatalyst used, operating temperature, fuel compatibility, and other operational factors are all determined by the device type, together with the electrochemistry and kinetics of processes occurring in the cell. In Table 9, we focus on hydrocarbon FCs, in which liquid hydrocarbons, such as methanol or ethanol, are fuels and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM, primarily Nafion®) and the electrolyte. The comparative study of various FCs based on various electrolytes is summarized in Table 10.

6.3.1. Alkaline fuel cells (AFCs). 
The electrolyte membrane in AFCs is an alkaline electrolyte, for instance a concentrated solution (40%) of KOH. Negative ions (OH−) are delivered to the anode through the electrolyte in accordance with the basic principle of AFCs, combining with hydrogen to form water and generating negatively charged electrons. Over the years, AFCs have attracted significant interest. The two most well-known uses of AFCs are the space shuttle and Apollo programs. KOH solution is present in AFCs as an electrolyte absorbed in a polymer matrix (e.g., asbestos). For electrocatalysis over porous electrodes to accelerate the response, a range of metals including precious metals, e.g., Ni, Pd, and Pt, and associated oxides have been explored.347 The operating range for AFCs is in the range of 100–250 °C, despite the fact that a high performance of about 60% is attained for AFCs at 200 °C. As a result of the alkaline conditions that improve the electrode reaction kinetics and give nonprecious metal electrocatalysts options, AFCs are thought to be superior to PEMFCs.348
Another important part of AFCs is the anion exchange membrane (AEM), which supports the electrocatalysts, separates the fuel and oxidant, and enhances the transport of anions.349,350 Therefore, the creation of the necessary AEM with acceptable mechanical and conductivity characteristics is crucial for the application of AFCs. Relevantly, the characteristics of numerous polymeric membranes for FC application have been noticeably enhanced by the integration of inorganic fillers in the polymer matrix. The graphene-modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA/GO) NC-based membrane created by Ye et al.351 served as an electrolyte for AFCs. They created GO using a modified Hummers' technique, dripping GO in PVA solution before the addition of hydrazine. The plastic plate with the necessary thickness was cast using the viscous solution, and the cast PVA/GO membrane was then submerged in a concentrated KOH solution. According to their findings, graphene NM enhanced the ionic transport by forming continuous and well-connected ionic channels in the membrane structure. With 0.7 wt% graphene NM loading, the ionic conductivity of the GO-filled membrane also increased by 126%, while the CH4O permeability decreased by 55%. Upon the addition of GO, the power density and tensile strength also increased dramatically by 148% and 73%, respectively.351 Similarly, an AAEM for AAEM-FCs was prepared by modifying ML GO paper with KOH (GO-KOH); however, this membrane can also work in AFCs.352 The fabrication of the AAEM using the traditional filtering technique produced materials with an elevated tensile strength of 24.5 MPa and high swelling ratio. The GO-KOH based membrane exhibited decreased hydrogen gas permeability, highest anionic conductivity of about 6.1 mS cm−1 at 70 °C, and ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 6.1 mmol g−1, where this improved FC performance is comparable to that of conventional membranes.352
A graphene-NM-based membrane for AFCs was also created by Liu et al.353 using a different concept. They initially created quaternized graphene (QG) from graphene that had been functionalized by APTES and added to CMPSU. The various QG/CMPSU NC-based membranes were created by quaternization and alkalinization. The aim of this study was to examine how graphene NMs affected the characteristics of NC-based membranes. With 0.5 wt% and 0.25 wt% of QGs, a 4-fold increase in bicarbonate conductivity and 3-fold increase in tensile strength were observed, respectively. The linked transfer channel creation afforded by 2D graphene was believed to be the cause of the increased performance of the QG-filled membranes.
Graphene-NM-added membranes were also discovered to exhibit superior thermal characteristics, morphologies, oxide stability, alkaline resistance, swelling ratios, and water uptake to a virgin QPSU membrane.353 Consequently, the addition of graphene NMs has been shown to be a simple method for creating AEMs for FCs. The extensive description of the effectiveness of graphene-based NMs in membranes has demonstrated their potential in MFCs and AFCs. The final graphene-filled membranes have improved proton conductivity, durability, kinetics, and water retention ability, and less bio-fouling and oxygen crossover. Only a few polymer matrices were altered using graphene to create NC-based membranes for both FCs, but their modification has shown that graphene can be a potential material for PEMs in future FCs. The primary benefit of AFCs is their strong ORR activity, whereas their disadvantage is that they are susceptible to CO2. Actually, the very low amount of CO2 in the working environment affects the cell functions by reacting with KOH, therefore increasing the resistance.354 Thus, hydrogen and oxygen must be purified or pure reactant gases must be applied to prevent this. The first man-made spacecraft, such as the Apollo and Shuttle Orbiter vehicles, are well-known examples of the use of AFCs.


6.3.2. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). 
FCs produce clean, efficient energy without CO2 pollution and have high energy conversion efficiency. Based on their availability, benefits, and some practical drawbacks, the application of FCs is enhanced in different industries. PEMFCs have been shown to be superior in some aspects among the FC family members because of their low operating temperature, high power density, and superior proton conductivity. Consequently, they can be viewed as a clean power source of the future for a variety of devices. Fig. 15 depicts an overview of the gradual advancements required for PEMFCs to satisfy future high-power-density necessities, together with a description of their operating principle. Based on their specific components, the present technological status and widely recognized possibilities of PEMFCs are listed. A typical PEMFC consists of an MEA and BPPs, with the MEA consisting of a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a microporous layer (MPL), a catalyst layer (CL), and a PEM similar to regular FCs. In PEMFCs, generally a PEM made of a solid polymer electrolyte is employed with the benchmark Pt or recently by some modified electrodes with other NMs. The electrolyte is typically a polymer based on perfluorosulfonated acid (PFSA), which conducts protons. The benchmark traditional Pt/C (20 wt%) paste is employed as the electrocatalyst for pure hydrogen fuel and Pt-Ru alloy for fuel contaminated with CO2. The GDL is a layer of carbon paper, which plays several roles in gas transport, mechanical support, and electrical connection. It is generally linked to another layer composed of carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), called MPL, which aids in the elimination of electrochemically generated water. The CL is the location of the electrochemical HOR and ORR, which take place via a number of linked physiochemical methods. Because of its outstanding activity and stability in an electrochemical environment, Pt-loaded carbon finely distributed with ionomer is the most commonly employed catalyst. However, because of the high price and limited resources of the Pt-group-metal (PGM), reducing its loading is an enduring objective for the development of CLs. The PEM, which serves as a proton conductor, electrical insulator, and gas separator, is the heart of the PEMFC.19 In addition to the intended electrical output, electrochemical processes create water and heat, which impair the functioning of PEMFCs.

To achieve a good trade-off among enough PEM hydration, unobstructed reactant supply, high catalytic activity, and suitable component lifespan, it is critical to maintain the optimal water content and a reasonable operating temperature through water and thermal control. To fulfil the increased power density and durability needs in the future, better temperature and humidity range tolerances, and suitable mechanical strength are required. BP is a rigid support structure in the PEMFC stack, which is responsible for current collection and heat dissipation, and used for the fabrication of reactant and coolant flow fields. However, BP accounts for a significant amount of the stack volume and cost. Two BPPs made of graphite and two porous carbon (P-C)-based gas diffusion electrodes are employed.
PEMFCs exhibit outstanding efficiency compared to the environment and coal combustion engine, and thus are one suitable devices to generate power in accordance with the needs of the 21st century, which are straightforward, have a fast start-up, and can work at comparatively low temperature. These FCs may function at both low and high temperature in the range of 80 °C and 200 °C.356 PEMFCs have an efficiency in the range of 40–50%. High-temperature PEMFCs have been developed, solving the drawback of being vulnerable to CO poisoning.357 In high-temperature PEMFCs, PBI and sulfonated polymers are employed as electrolytes (ether sulfone). To obtain higher-power-density and lower-cost PEMFCs, the construction of a thinner BP with superior mass-transfer capacity, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and lower cost is an apparent design option. The main attributes that make PEMFCs the most widely used FCs are their straight-forward design, straightforward production, affordability, and durability.358 The following sections provide a more thorough view of the prospective expectations and probable pathways for their execution at the component level, as represented in Fig. 15.19
Here, we present the detailed structure and revolutionization of PEMFCs. The microstructure of Nafion-based PEMFC consists of a hydrophobic perfluorinated ionomer backbone and hydrophilic sulfonic acid pendant groups, and the high proton conductivity (0.1 S cm−1) can be maintained in a humid environment. The purpose of the PEM is to enable protons to flow through, while preventing the passage of other species.359 It is a semi-permeable membrane that is often constructed of an ionomer. It is important to create PEMs with the necessary characteristics, for example, high mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability and robust tolerance to electrocatalyst.360 PEMs are also used in redox flow batteries, electrolysers, and other electrochemical energy conversion/storage devices.359 Fuel crossover in two electrodes and electron transfer are both avoidable with PEMs. Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes, also called Nafion in the marketplace, are the most widely used PEMs due to their mechanical strength, high conductivity, superior chemical resistance, and durability.361 Ionomer membranes, as previously mentioned, are crucial in PEMFC systems. Currently, the use of perfluorinated ionomer membranes such as Flemion and Nafion is preferred in PEMFCs despite the fact that they have severe issues including high cost and high fuel crossover. However, Nafion has certain drawbacks, including high cost, the inclusion of electro-catalyst, electrolyte, shrinkage, high CH4O permeability, and dehydration at high temperature.362 Therefore, improvements in cost-effectiveness and discovery of alternative solid proton conductors have become a research focus in the PEMFC sector. Nafion still has issues including high cost, swelling, poor conductivity at high temperature and/or low humidity, permeable to CH4O, fuel crossover, and unstable mechanical strength at the working temperature.363 Thus, substitute solid proton conductors should be inexpensive, have abundant raw materials, and excellent proton conductivity, and not include any Pt.364 ZrP,21 PVA, urea copolymer NCs,365 and GO membrane are examples of Nafion-free electrolytes, which are the future of FC technology. Based on the main topic of this review, we will concentrate on graphene-based NMs.
PEMFCs, with excellent durability, elevated proton conductivity, highest power, superior thermal stability, and clearly reduced cost are presently the preference.366 Organic-inorganic hybrid NC-based membranes have recently been discovered to be a great replacement for traditional membranes. The distinctive changes in membranes using a mixture of organic and inorganic materials aid in reducing the major issues related to pure polymeric membranes.367 After inorganic fillers, the most desirable filler is graphene NMs, demonstrating potential for the modifications of the PEM for FC technology. Recently, graphene NMs have been reported as alternative PEMs to Nafion. In the future, the contribution of graphene NMs will be studied to develop the functionality of PEMs utilized in PEMFC applications. The excellent characteristics of GO include a wide working temperature range, big SSA, thermal stability, proton conductivity, strong mechanical strength, and a CH4O crossover barrier. Numerous studies have focused on GO alone or combined with Nafion and other polymers, or as a membrane that has been sulfonated. Among them, GO membranes have been given significant attention for applications as an electrolyte in PEMFCs.
One of the graphene derivatives with GO is produced by chemically functionalizing and exfoliating graphite powder, demonstrating a C/O ratio of 2.1.368 GO membranes are 2D, mixed-sp2 and mixed-sp3 hybridized graphite carbon materials functionalized with surface functional groups that contain oxygen.369 The oxygen functional groups of GO, a modified version of graphene, have a large SSA, which aids in the transport of protons via channels, and also stores water. It is interesting to note that pristine graphene was previously not a good candidate for membrane modification in FCs370 because of its high electrical conductivity, which led to a low FC voltage. However, with respect to its SSA, mechanical strength, and gas permeability, it has delivered some good results. Therefore, GO-based NMs are considered as a potential filler and electrical insulator; however, the advanced research GO NMs is extensively oxidized with a carbon to oxygen ratio of 2:1.371 Oxidation causes graphene NSs to split from the graphite stack by rupturing the bonds, resulting in the formation of sp2 graphitic domains, which are often covered by sp3 domains that contain oxygen groups.372 GO is transformed into an insulating and hydrophilic material by various oxygen groups, including epoxide, hydroxide, carbonyls, and carboxyls,373 while maintaining other qualities such as mechanical strength, SSA, and gas impermeability. Protons may be transported easily via GO and water can be absorbed more effectively.374 According to Table 11, the many characteristics of GO, including electrical insulation, gas permeability, and hydrophilicity, make it a suitable material for NC membranes (NCMs) in PEMFCs. These materials have some unique properties, including:

(8) The aforementioned acidic functional groups enable GO membranes to hydrate and absorb water molecules with ease.
It's interesting to note that the electrical conductivity predominates when the RH is lower than ∼40%. Numerous proton-conducting pathways can be produced by acidic functional groups and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. GO membranes get saturated with more water, which allows more water molecules to readily spin and permeate across the membrane. A water-mediated ion transport mechanism, namely the vehicle or Grotthuss method, controls the proton conductivity of GO membranes. The highest water content of GO membrane has been reported to reach 15 wt%.375 The acidic functional groups disappeared during the FC operation, and thus GO can be reduced to graphene. Therefore, GO membranes can be combined with a ceramic or polymer matrix to further enhance their electrical or mechanical characteristics.376 The MPD of 79 mW cm−2 was recently achieved by spraying a GO membrane (3 m) directly on the electrode surface.368 Overall, GOM-FCs offer the following benefits:
(1) Inexpensive and simple fabrication technique.
(2) Producing a thin, strong, solid, and homogenous membrane lacking any flaws or fractures.
(3) Possible to further increase the performance of hydrogen FCs by adding functional groups.362
GO membranes have been demonstrated to be a promising electrolyte and superior ionic conductor in the literature. Emerging technology known as hydrogen membrane FC (HMFC) gives FCs based on NC electrolytes made of hydrogen permeable alloy and perovskite proton conductor distinctive properties. These FCs do not require acid electrolyte, have high mechanical strength, little gas leakage, a Pt-free anode, and are simple to micro-fabricate, which are major benefits. However, the perovskite electrolyte has drawbacks because of its poor crystallinity, poor proton conductivity, and challenging manufacture, which is employed in traditional HMFCs. In this work, a novel HMFC employing a GO membrane as an electrolyte was proposed to address these shortcomings. The traditional perovskite electrolyte of HMFCs was replaced with a BL electrolyte membrane made of a pure GO membrane and an alloy layer that is hydrogen permeable, with a maximum hydrogen permeable thin film thickness of 40 nm. By bringing the operating temperature of the HMFC down from the intermediate temperature range to RT, this aimed to replace PEMFC. It satisfies a number of requirements, including preventing gas penetration, mechanical strength, low-temperature functioning, electronic insulation, resistance to reduction, and simplicity of micro-fabrication, by employing Pd or Ni64Zr36 hydrogen-permeable metal layers. Thus, the metal hydrogen permeable thin film on the GO membrane surface may reduce fuel gas leakage and hydrogen reduction when the FC is operating, and the hydrogen thin film also possesses catalytic activity and the capacity to transport protons, acting as the anode itself. Additionally, electrocatalysts become more effective in transferring electrons. The activation energy is decreased as a result of Pd or Ni-Zr on the surface breaking hydrogen bonds in contact with the anti-bonding orbits of the hydrogen molecules.
GO-based NMs have demonstrated potential benefits in membrane modification for PEMFCs and have outstanding compatibility with Nafion polymers. Thus, the exceptional compatibility of Nafion polymer with GO has drawn attention from numerous scientists because of their strong interfacial attraction. The side chains and backbone of Nafion can be improved by GO, improving its mechanical and thermal characteristics. Nafion has undergone several modifications as graphene has taken various forms over time. As an illustration, Ansari et al.377 changed Nafion by adding GO to the polymer matrix and discovered a considerable change in the ionic domains. In PEMFCs, NCMs made from GO and Nafion were successfully employed in 2012.378 TEM and SEM examination verified the dispersion of GO-based NMs in the Nafion polymer. The addition of GO-based NMs (4 wt%) to the Nafion polymer increased the proton conductivities of Nafion-212 and the pristine Nafion and Nafion NC by up to 0.068, 0.043, and 0.078 S cm−1, respectively at 300 °F and 100% RH. Compared to pure Nafion membranes, the greatest power density of the FC was 415 mW cm−2 when 4 wt% GO used at 30 °C and 0.390 V.378 Additionally, Nafion was studied in PEMFCs at high temperature and low RH.379 Here, polyoxometalate-coupled GO was used to modify Nafion rather than just pure GO NMs. Phosphotungstic acid (PW) and GO-based NMs were combined, and then integrated into the Nafion polymer matrix. The results demonstrated that the graphene-added membrane or Nafion/PW-mGO membrane had greater proton conductivity than the recast Nafion membrane. Additionally, the power density of the membrane with graphene-based NM was good, achieving 841 mW cm−2 with 20% RH at 800 °C,379 compared to just 210 mW cm−2 for the pure Nafion membrane. By retaining water through hydrogen bonding and lowering Ohmic resistance, the inclusion of GO aided in the transfer of protons across the membrane. Additionally, Peng et al.380 discussed the use of GO to alter the Nafion chains to create a nanohybrid membrane made of both GO and Nafion. They first created nanohybrids of GO and Nafion using an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reaction between the CC group of GO and C-F group of Nafion, as described using FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS. The interfacial compatibility that creates the proton conducting domains improved with the addition of GO to the Nafion chains. Consequently, the GO-based incorporated membrane had 1.6-times better proton conductivity than the recast Nafion membrane; moreover, the single cell test showed a 35–40% improvement in PEMFC performance.380
Consistent with this, Feng et al.335 modified Nafion NCMs using GO. Al-foil was utilized to cover a GO layer after GO was created from graphite NFs using a modified Hummer technique. The procedure involved adding GO to the polymer solution, followed by sonication for its dispersion. The Nafion membrane performed better once graphene was added. At 30 °C and 40% RH, the proton conductivity of the recast FC was reduced by 78.14%; however, with the addition of GO to the Nafion membrane, the reduction was closer to 68.08%. The authors claimed that the inclusion of GO may increase the ability of NCM to retain water, which may also have an impact on how the water absorption is measured (improved by 8.4%). Additionally, an F-doped GO-based NM was employed to alter the NCM for PEMFCs. The authors modified the Nafion electrolyte with F-doped GO NMs using the Hummers' approach to generate GO. With the help of a toluene and 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTMPS) solution, GO underwent special functionalization. A polymer NCM was made using the solution casting process. In comparison to the recast Nafion membrane, which had an IEC value of 0.91 meq g−1, the addition of 5 and 10 wt% of F-doped GO to the Nafion polymer matrix produced superior water uptake of 2% and 6% and IEC of 0.93 and 0.96 meq g−1, respectively. Additionally, it was discovered that at 120 °C and 30% RH, the proton conductivity was 4-times greater with the addition of F-doped GO than that with the regular recast Nafion membrane. Therefore, when the power density increased from 0.042 to 0.15 W cm−2, the PEMFC performance improved.381 To improve the performance of PBI, polyethylene oxide (PEO), sulfonated polyamide (SPI), and Nafion membranes for PEMFC applications at high temperature and low humidity, researchers are looking forward at GO and its countless forms.382,383
Another popular polymer for PEMFCs is SPEEK. SPEEK has also undergone several graphene modifications to enhance the membrane performance. Investigations into the impact of low- and high-degree GO (H-GO) oxidation on Nafion-SPEEK/GO-NCMs were conducted. The XPS study indicated that the concentration of oxygen functionality in H-GO and GO was 31.8% and 28.4%, respectively, but that GO was bigger than H-GO in size. With 0.75 wt% H-GO at 90 °C and 100% RH, the addition of graphene to the Nafion/SPEEK matrix showed outstanding proton conductivity of 322.2 mS cm−1 and power density of 621.2 mW cm−2.384 Accordingly, polydopamine-modified GO (D-GO) NSs were added to the SPEEK polymer matrix to create an anhydrous PEM.385 With an integrated SPEEK matrix, a homogeneous D-GO NS dispersion was observed. This enabled the remarkable electrostatic rearrangement of the membrane structure and NC chain packing (EA). The EA at the SPEEK/D-GO interface led to proton hopping and improved proton transfer according to the Grotthuss method, resulting in the generation of acid-based pairs. Membranes have substantially greater proton conductivities than pure polymer membranes under both hydrated and anhydrous environments. In hydrous circumstances at 120 °C, GO-modified NCMs improved the cell performance, with an increase in the highest current/power density of 47% and 38%, respectively.385 This demonstrates the ability of graphene NM to improve the performances of SPEEK membranes in FCs even at high temperature and anhydrous conditions.
PBI is an excellent compatible polymer with GO-based NMs, which was recently tailored with some high-quality inorganic fillers, including SiO2, ZrP, and TiO2, and has been found to be extremely effective for PEMs in PEMFCs.386 By incorporating F-doped GO in PBI, Chao et al.331 created high-temperature PEMs for PEMFCs. Triazole F-doped GO was first developed by Yang et al.387 They discovered that the PBI/GO-based CM had superior tensile strength and proton conductivity to pure PBI membrane. Additionally, because the triazole F-doped GO is simple to disperse in polar organic solvents, it has been found to facilitate the fabrication of homogeneous membranes. According to the authors, F-doped GO can be a promising option for creating inorganic polymer electrolytes for PEMFCs. Subsequently, Chao et al.331 produced GO/PBI (BuIPBI) and isocyanate GO (iGO)/BuIPBI NCMs for high-temperature PEMFCs using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 5-tert-butyl isophthalic acid. The SEM characterization verified that the PBI polymer matrix contained GO and iGO. Additionally, it demonstrated how well GO and iGO interacted with BuIPBI, supporting larger acid contents and enhancing the chemical stability of the membrane. The results revealed that the proton conductivities for the iGO/BuIPBI and GO/BuIPBI membranes at 140 °C were 0.027 and 0.016 S cm−1, respectively. In addition to these well-known polymers, GO has also been employed to modify several other polymers, demonstrating both its important contribution and versatility in functionalization. For PEMFCs, Sharma et al.388 treated GO with silica and evenly disseminated it into a matrix of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and chitosan. Following the addition of various concentrations of GO to PVA/chitosan matrix, the produced REMs were characterized. The addition of graphene caused the chemical, mechanical, and structural characteristics of the membrane to significantly improve, where the proton conductivity increased from 6.77 × 10−2 (pure PVA membrane) to 11.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 (GO-based filled membrane) at 90 °C. Additionally, the mechanical and thermal stability of the PEM also increased with the addition of GO. The resultant elastic modulus was about 21.37 MPa and the maximum stress was about 54 MPa. Consequently, inorganic fillers are being used to modify PEMs for energy applications. Furthermore, Cao et al.382 also created a graphene-based poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/GO-CM for low-temperature PEMFCs using the solution mixing approach. The proton in NCM was given by the partly ionized-COO– and H+ ions of the –COOH groups that are present on GO NSs. They examined the Young's modulus and tensile strength of PEO/GO-CM's and compared them to the pure PEO membrane, discovering outstanding results (Fig. 16(a)). When GO was added to PEO NCM at 60 °C, they also observed excellent proton conductivity of 0.09 S cm−1 and a power density of 53 mW cm−2. Additionally, the addition of GO to PEO polymers improves their ionic conductivity by releasing the proton from the COOH group.

To create PEMs for PEMFCs, thermally heat-treated GO and poly(2,5-benzimidazole)-grafted GO (ABPBI/GO) were added to the sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPAES) matrix. Graphite was chemically oxidized to create pure GO, which was then combined with 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid to create ABPBI/GO. The addition of ABPBI/GO to the SPAES matrix produced improvements in dimensional stability, mechanical strength, elongation, and Young's modulus. Consequently, the SPAES/ABPBI membranes outperformed the SPAES/GO-based CMs. Additionally, the SPAES/ABPBI/GO-based CMs had greater proton conductivity than the SPAES/GO and pure SPAES NCMs because the acid-base interactions added more proton routes to the membrane structure.391 Other fillers, including polymers, have also been functionalized using GO to improve their performance as a membrane material in FCs. For instance, Pt NPs were initiated, changed, and added to polymer matrices several times to enhance their performance because Pt NPs have greater proton conductivity and larger water content. Lee et al.383 used the Hummers' technique to create GO, and then used a microwave approach to deposit 1.8 nm Pt NPs on GO, forming (Pt-G). Due to the hydrophilic nature of GO, it was discovered that the Nafion/GO-CM had a somewhat greater water absorption than the Nafion/Pt-G-NCM. Fig. 16(b) illustrates the dramatic increase in mechanical characteristics after the addition of GO. The hydroxyl interaction in GO NPs and Nafion may be because OH functional groups are connected to both entities, but they were unable to offer a convincing explanation. Alternatively, the Nafion/Pt–graphene-based CMs did not significantly improve under various circumstances. The electrical network development by Pt was the source of the e− loss, and the inadequate performance of FC was caused by the low water retention capacity of GO.383
Similarly, Pt–graphene has been employed with Nafion, although this time SiO2 was used.392 With varying weight percentages of graphene, several Nafion/Pt–graphene/SiO2-based NCMs were created and evaluated for proton conductivity and water absorption. The results only indicated an increase in cell performance for Pt–graphene contents below 1.5 wt%. As a result of the loss of electrons from the Pt-network and excess inorganic fillers, the cell performance decreased and the proton conduction was inhibited beyond 1.5 wt% of Pt–graphene.80 The observed results also showed that the Pt–graphene concentration affected how effective SiO2 is. The Pt–graphene form of graphene has certain interesting properties that can be slightly changed for effective use in other energy applications; however, it does not function well in PEMs for PEMFCs using the disclosed approach.
Recently, Yang et al.393 modified Nafion/Pt-NP/TiO2-based NCMs for PEMFCs using GO. The addition of the GO to the Nafion polymer matrix led to a 15.3% increase in water absorption. Additionally, increased IEC and proton conductivity were seen with the inclusion of GO. Due to the blocking impact of GO NSs, excessive amounts of GO were not found to be acceptable for membrane production. The membrane could retain up to 32% free water with the inclusion of TiO2, but it increased up to 45% with the addition of GO compared to pure Nafion membrane, according to thermogravimetric data, which ultimately improved the cell performance.393 With the intention to further improve the performance of these NCMs for FCs, it is necessary to conduct studies on the effect of a decreased Pt concentration in inorganic fillers. The authors ascribed the considerable influence on water absorption to the excess quantity of Pt NPs.
Ionic liquids (ILs) are receiving increasing attention these days because of their unique characteristics. There are several polymeric membranes for PEMFCs that are ILs-based; however, we only discuss the NCMs that are GO-NM based and IL-modified. The kinetics of the electrode reaction would typically be optimized, the GO tolerance would be improved, and the excessive usage of the (Pt) catalyst would be avoided at high operating temperature (>100 °C), all of which will significantly increase the performance of PEMFCs. In contrast, the Nafion membrane loses a significant amount of water at 80 °C, making it unsuitable for use at higher temperature. Due to their stability even at high temperature, protic ILs (PILs) and polymer acid complexes have attracted interest from several scientists as alternative PEMs to Nafion. One effective polymer acid complex is the PBI/H3PO4 membrane.394 The PBI/H3PO4 membrane was mechanically sound with certain restrictions given that it has great ionic conductivity when the acid concentration is high. Consequently, as water evaporates at high temperature, the PBI/H3PO4 membrane can lose the free acid. One of the potential options to lower the acid content of the PBI membrane is the addition of appropriate solid conductors. Consequently, GO and S-doped GO were added to a PBI membrane with a low H3PO4 concentration by Xu et al.331 Additionally, NCMs based on PILs and graphene-modified IL polymer (PIL [NTFSI]-G] have been researched.370 With 0.5 wt% graphene loading at 160 °C, the (PIL [NTFSI]-G] membrane demonstrated good ionic conductivity of 7.5 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is much better than that of the sulfonated polyamide/PIL (SPI/PIL) membrane. Furthermore, the addition of graphene to the membrane improved its mechanical characteristics compared to the SPI/PIL membrane, increasing the Young's modulus by 127% and the tensile strength by 345% with just 0.9 wt% of graphene. Alternatively, they functionalized GO to change the PBI membrane for PEMFCs by using 3-aminopropyltriethoxtsilane IL material. They discovered that the addition of IL GO (IL-GO) to the PBI polymer matrix improved its proton conductivity, while the phosphoric acid loading was kept at the minimum. The ionic conductivity of the IL-GO/PBI membranes at 175 °C was 0.025 S cm−1 and 0.035 S cm−1 after repeating the units of 2.0 and 3.5,395 respectively, which was superior to that of the plain PBI membrane. Similar work was recently done for alkaline AEMFCs using IL-GO/PBI AEM. The IL-GO/PBI NCM that was produced exhibited high mechanical, thermal, and alkaline stability with increased conductivity of around 10−2 S cm−1. The developed membrane satisfies the prerequisites for AEMs and exhibits significant promise for next-generation FCs.396
In addition to this GO form, GO also exists in various functionalized forms that expand and reinforce its function as an FC membrane material. To make a sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) NCM, for instance, a combination of cis and trans mesonaphthobifluorene (MNF) form of graphene was utilized, followed by its characterization. The six conjugated phenyl rings on the MNF graphene moiety created sp2-bound carbon planar NSs. The main processes in the synthesis of graphene for the poly(ether sulfone) mesonaphthobifluorene (PMNF)-based materials were polycondensation, intra cyclization, and Friedel–Crafts reaction with FeCl3. However, H2SO4 was utilized to sulfonate MNF. The main factors used to evaluate SPMNF membrane were the proton conductivity, IEC, and water uptake. The authors disclosed the potential of graphene NMs to enhance the characteristics of the membrane and concluded by advising the use of SPMNF membranes for PEMFCs. A self-supporting graphene-based membrane for PEMFCs was also created using the vacuum filtering approach.397 In contrast, the traditional Nafion membrane was made by the authors, and both were examined before being used in a PEMFC. With respect to the water absorption, elastic modulus, swelling ratio, and tensile strength, the graphene-based membrane outperformed Nafion. Furthermore, under comparable circumstances, the graphene-based membrane outperformed the Nafion membrane with respect to proton conductivity and activation energy. Additionally, the self-supporting graphene-based membrane attained a maximum power density of 33.8 mW cm−2, which is the highest value recorded for this type of membrane. GO has several advantages as a membrane material for FCs, but it still has to be functionalized to be even better. For instance, sulfonated-GO has been shown to be an excellent membrane material for FCs. Although GO-based NMs increase the proton conductivity of NCMs, the poor performance of these membranes is caused by their poor mechanical characteristics and increased water/CH4O permeability. Therefore, the detrimental effect of polymer sulfonation, i.e., loss of mechanical strength, can be minimized by the insertion of an inorganic group with enhanced carbon nanostructures, such as sulfonated-GO. The sulfonated-GO boosts the mechanical strength, while decreasing the CH4O permeability given that it creates a more winding channel for the fuel. Numerous studies investigated how the incorporation of sulfonated-GO affects polymeric NCMs, as briefly explained below. Facile distillation polymerization was employed by Liu et al.398 to create sulfonated-GO NSs and introduce them in the chitosan (CS) matrix to create a nanohybrid membrane. Investigations were done on the membrane structure and characteristics. Due to the electrostatic attraction between the –NH2 of CS and –SO3H of sulfonated-GO, which reduced the mobility of the CS chains, the GO-filled membranes demonstrated greater mechanical and thermal stabilities than the CS pure membrane. Additionally, the structural stability of the sulfonated-GO-filled membranes was strengthened due to the decrease in their swelling area as a result of the inhibition of the mobility of the CS chains. The inclusion of sulfonated-GO creates proton-hoping sites and offers channels for proton transfer, which increase the proton conductivity in both the hydrated and anhydrous states. In comparison to the pure CS membrane, the addition of 2 wt% sulfonated-GO increased the anhydrous conductivity by 90.7% and hydrated conductivity by 122.5%.398
Kumar et al.399 also modified a SPEEK membrane for PEMFCs using sulfonated-GO. The channels for proton transfer were created by dispersing the sulfonic acid in the SPEEK structure after it was utilized to functionalize GO. By using FTIR and SEM to analyze the membranes, it was possible to see how F-GO and SPEEK interacted chemically and how sulfonated-GO was evenly distributed throughout the polymer matrix. When sulfonated-GO was added at 30% RH and 800 °C, the proton conductivity of the SPEEK-controlled membrane increased to 0.055 S cm−1. Additionally, the sulfonated-GO-filled membranes exhibited increased power density (378 W cm−2) compared to the pure SPEEK membrane, demonstrating the potential of graphene to improve the performance of PEMFCs. GO was functionalized to form sulfonated-GO and its performance in a PFSA-based electrolyte, for example, Nafion-115, was assessed in another work by the same authors. Initially, they vacuum-filtered a colloidal solution of sulfonated-GO on the membrane before applying it layer by layer. Through-plane and in-plane measurements, the proton conductivity of the membrane was determined to be 0.012 and 0.04 S cm−1, respectively. The IEC was increased with the addition of sulfonated-GO from 0.93 to 1.1 meq g−1. Although the OCV was just 0.72 V, the power density of the membrane was excellent, at 113 mW cm−2 at 0.39 V.374 It was found that gas crossover, not the graphene content was responsible for the decrease in OCV value. In another investigation, sulfonated-GO was combined with a PBI membrane for PEMFCs. Sulfonated-GO was integrated into the PBI polymer matrix by Xu et al.400 to change the PBI polymeric membrane. Phosphoric acid was used to create PBI/sulfonated-GO membranes for high-temperature PEMFCs to improve their proton conductivity. Following the evaluation of the PBI/GO and PBI/sulfonated-GO membranes using XRD, the intercalation of the PBI molecules in the sulfonated-GO layer was verified.
Reduced levels of acid loading resulted in less free acid, which prevented conductivity loss and water loss. At 0% humidity and 175 °C, the addition of GO and sulfonated-GO NMs to the PBI matrix improved the ionic conductivity to 0.027 S cm−1 and 0.052 S cm−1, respectively. With a power density of 600 mW cm−2 at 175 °C, the performance of the FC was similarly excellent.401 The PEMs utilized in PEMFCs have improved characteristics as a result of the addition of graphene. Compared to pure membranes, the graphene-loaded membranes showed better chemical and mechanical stability. Additionally, the improved membrane conductivity, electrical resistance, and water retention were ascribed to the addition of graphene. It also reduced the activation energy and CH4O permeability. According to Fig. 17, GO is compatible with the majority of polymers and solvents used to create NCMs for FC applications. However, sulfonated-GO has been found to be preferable to GO due to its notable impact on the electrochemical characteristics of NCMs. The fundamental functional characteristics of ILs and Pt NPs have been greatly improved by GO, and the PEMs have been effectively adjusted for PEMFCs.

The impact of GO on membrane alteration is suitable for use in DMFCs after PEMFCs. According to cutting-edge FCV products and global FC programs, the volume power density of a stack with end plates will approach 6 kW l−1 in the next 5 to 10 years, with the working current density and cell voltage increasing to about 3–4 A cm−2 and 0.7–0.8 V, respectively. In addition, with future advancements, an ultimate stack objective of 9 kW l−1 may be realized, with the cell operating points pushed to even higher levels, for instance, 4–5 A cm−2 and 0.8–0.9 V, respectively. The mathematical translation in two PEMFC performance indices (volume power density of stack, expressed in kW l−1, and current density of active area, expressed in A cm−2) is based on public domain data and calculation of the number of cells and end plate thickness. Unless otherwise noted, herein, the volume power density refers to that of a stack with end plates. To achieve the necessary significant increase in the PEMFC stack power density, complete knowledge of the existing problems and potential including all PEMFC components is required, which is the goal of this perspective.19


6.3.3. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). 
DMFCs are a form of PEMFCs, which are considered as one of the greatest future power-generation system alternatives due to their easy function and design with excellent energy efficiency (Fig. 18(a)). The PEM is a critical component of DMFCs, serving as a barrier to prevent direct contact between the oxidant and fuel and proton-conducting medium. One of the major hurdles in modern DMFCs is the creation of novel proton-conductive membranes. Polymer membranes must have good thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, with low cost, low permeability to reactants, accessibility, and strong proton conduction.405 Previously, researchers employed the commercially available DuPont Nafion membrane in DMFCs because of its strong proton conduction and outstanding mechanical and chemical stabilities. However, Nafion membranes have a few drawbacks, including a low operating temperature (about 100 °C or lower), expensive material costs, and elevated CH4O permeability. Besides Nafion, numerous polymeric polymers, for example, poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), PBI, and polysulfone (PSF), have been successfully employed in DMFCs as a result of their economical nature and strong thermal and mechanical stabilities at high temperature. To date, substantial research has been conducted to produce novel PEMs that can meet the current performance standards for DMFCs. Among them, graphene-based NCMs have received significant attention and found to exhibit an excellent performance in DMFCs. The incorporation of graphene in the polymer matrix improves the properties of pure polymeric membranes, which in turn improves the performance of DMFCs. Similar to PEMFCs, GO NMs have also demonstrated usefulness as membrane materials in DMFCs due to their distinctive 2D structure with flexible functionalization and strong thermal stability, meeting the PEM-recommended requirements. Compared to other inorganic materials, the presence of multiple functional groups makes them more adaptable for functionalization.

There are many studies on the effect of GO on polymer matrices in recent years. Nafion is a commonly utilized polymer for the PEM in FCs. As previously noted, GO exhibits great compatibility with Nafion; hence, GO-NM-based NCMs have been thoroughly investigated for DMFC applications. Lin et al.406 and Choi et al.,361 for example, employed GO with Nafion-115 and pure Nafion, respectively. Both studies used GO to functionalize their Nafion membranes to improve the performance of DMFCs. However, these membranes were created using distinct techniques for the same application. On the one hand, the results demonstrated that the GO-laminated dual-layer PEM had 70% lower CH4O permeability and 22% lower ionic conductivity than the recast Nafion membrane in DMFCs.406 The inclusion of GO in the polymer matrix favorably altered the transport characteristics of the ionic conductive NCM. Because of the modified ionic channels, the developed membranes maintained high ionic conductivity, while decreased CH4O crossover. Furthermore, the GO filler enhanced the interfacial contacts, which enhanced the mechanical and thermal characteristics of the Nafion/GO-CM.361 Under regulated operating conditions, the GO-NM-based NCMs significantly outperformed the Nafion-112 membranes in the DMFC. Recently, Yan et al.359 sandwiched SL graphene between two thin films of Nafion to create a new NCM for DMFCs. Their goal was to lower the CH4O permeability, while maintaining selectivity. Compared to the pure Nafion membrane, the addition of SL graphene increased the proton permeability, while decreasing the CH4O permeability by 68.6%. This concept presented an effective technique to decrease the CH4O crossover, while maintaining the high proton conductivity of the NCM, and it also enhances the performance of PEMFCs.
Wang et al.407 tailored Nafion-117 with GO for PEMs in DMFCs. To create GO NCMs, the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique was employed using PDHC. According to scientists, the LbL method provides strong membrane stability and prevents the dissolution of GO in water. Under the same conditions, the Nafion/GO NCMs had 2-times the CH4O permeability and 5-times the selectivity of the recast Nafion-117 membrane. Furthermore, the endurance duration of the Nafion/GO NCMs in Fenton's reagent was 10-times that of the recast Nafion-117 membrane. The Nafion/GO NCMs also exhibited an outstanding OCV of 0.67 V with the maximum power density of about 64.38 mW cm−2 at 200 mA cm−2 and 60 °C. Yuan et al.408 developed a CH4O blocking membrane for DMFCs using a similar LbL method. However, their method was slightly different given that they tailored GO with poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) and built it on the surface of a commercially available Nafion membrane. By generating a homogeneous and dense coating on the surface of a Nafion membrane, they tested the CH4O blocking function of BLs. Compared to a regulated Nafion membrane, the PDDA/GO BL NCM reduced the CH4O permeability by 67%. Furthermore, the limiting current density of the PDDA/GO BL NCM was about one-third that of the pure Nafion membrane, with a 63% reduction in CH4O crossover. The GO-filled membrane outperformed the pure Nafion membranes in both cases and was shown to be much better for DMFC applications.
Besides Nafion, sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) is a good GO-suitable polymer for PEMs, which has been utilized numerous times with F-GO in DMFCs and proven to be great with respect to PEM properties. To reveal its potential in DMFCs, a quick description of GO/SPEEK NCM is necessary. Recently, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) was used to modify GO, and this customized filler was inserted into a SPEEK membrane for DMFC applications.409 The water uptake, IEC, CH4O permeability, and proton conductivity of the SDB-sulfonated-GO/SPEEK NCMs were compared to that of Nafion-112 and pure SPEEK membranes. The SDB-sulfonated-GO filled membranes outperformed other similar membranes in DMFC application, as predicted. Recently, SPEEK has been employed with GO NSs to create hybrid PEMs for DMFCs.410 F-GO NSs were combined with histidine molecules and their influence on the NCM crystalline structure, fractional free volume, thermal stability, cross sectional morphology, and polymer chain stiffness was investigated. The concept was to merge fundamental imidazole groups (which accept protons) from the histidine molecules with acidic –SO3H groups (which donate proton) from SPEEK to generate acid-base pairs, which facilitate the synergistic transport of protons, resulting in efficient proton channels in NCM. Consequently, the proton conductivity of the hybrid membrane increased by 30.2% compared to the pure SPEEK membrane. In addition, the inclusion of F-GO NFs in the polymer matrix was responsible for low CH4O permeability of the DMFC cell of 1.32–3.91 × 107 cm2 s−1, outstanding selectivity of 5.14 × 10−5 S scm−3, and 80.7% greater maximum power density compared to plain SPEEK. SPEEK was once again tailored with GO to create an NCM for DMFCs. Lee et al.411 produced a self-humidifying membrane (SHM) by incorporating phosphotungstic acid (PWA) and carboxyl functionalized graphene (F-Gc) in a SPEEK film. According to them, the addition of G-PWA in an adequate proportion can enhance the microstructural design of SHMs by increasing their proton conductivity and water retention. After evaluation by different techniques such as XRD, SEM, XPS, and TGA, the parameters such as water absorption, IEC, and thermal stability, were studied. The results indicated that the inclusion of G-PWA in SPEEK enhanced the characteristics of the SHM at a temperature over 600 °C and has high potential for use in DMFCs at medium temperature.
Also, other GO-based polymeric membranes for DMFCs have been described. Scientists attempted to employ certain innovative ways to improve the functionalities of GO; hence, the investigations resulted in many enhanced parameters, opening the door for future PEM adjustments. Chu et al.412 studied a novel technique for using graphene in a polymeric matrix to form NCMs. They created NCMs for the first time by combining zwitterion-coated GO (ZC-GO) with PBI for DMFCs. The existence of ZC-GO was verified by FTIR, and the PBI structure and purity were studied using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results were in favor of including ZC-GO in the PBI matrix. With respect to water absorption, swelling ratio, CH4O permeability, proton conductivity, and thermal stability, the ZC-GO-containing membranes outperformed the pure PBI membranes. Especially, the proton conductivity and CH4O permeability of the 25% ZC-GO-filled membrane were 4.12 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 1.38 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1, respectively, which were superior to that of Nafion-117 under identical circumstances. The proton-transport channels in the NCMs were ascribed to the homogeneous and uniform dispersion of the ZC-GO filler. PBI/ZC-GO-CM exhibited a good performance for DMFC application. Kim et al.413 proposed a novel way to adjust GO for DMFCs. Initially, they prepared modified GO with vinyl groups (F-GO), modified montmorillonite clay with vinyl groups (F-MMT), and modified CNT with vinyl groups using an ion exchange process with 1-[(4-ethylphenyl) methyl]-3-butyl-imidazolium chloride (F-MWNT). Following the inclusion of vinyl monomers in a solvent combination of CH4O and water, a solvent-casting approach was utilized to construct polymeric NCMs containing F-GO, F-MWNT, and F-MMT by radiation-induced polymerization.
In the DMFC application, vinyl polymer-based NCMs are employed as separators. This is a novel way to improve the performance of DMFCs using vinyl polymer-based NCMs. However, graphene has demonstrated amazing flexibility with most polymers and been identified as a good material for future membranes for FCs. Furthermore, for DMFC applications, a PVA-grafted GO (PVA/GO) NC was integrated in sulfonated PVA.414 The findings were adequate and served to demonstrate the potential benefits of graphene in membrane formation for DMFC applications. Furthermore, Kumar et al.,415 for the first time, used GO paper as an electrolyte. However, the permeability of CH4O was about 18.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, which was greater than that of Nafion-115 (3.36 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) and resulted in an excellent performance with an increased power density of DMFC. Also, the latter graphene was employed as a PEM in a DMFC.416 The membrane was made by laminating GO nano-platelets. The increased proton conductivity and linear decrease in CH4O penetration rate were ascribed to the increase in the size of the nano-platelets after evaluating the membrane transport properties. The surface mobility of CH4O and proton molecules, and the many conduction channels formed by graphene may be key causes for the improved transport characteristics. Compared to commercial Nafion membranes, the GO membrane in DMFCs demonstrated a better power density and no observed loss in OCV. This demonstrates the significance of graphene-based membranes in DMFCs. After GO, sulfonated-GO has been widely employed to increase the performance of PEMs in DMFCs. GO is a non-conductive substance, requiring the removal of oxygen functional groups and reduction of the interlayer spacing to the increase conductivity; hence, GO must be converted to rGO.
Nonetheless, GO has potential to improve the proton conductivity of the polymer matrix. Heo et al.417 created an aa-type NCM to study the influence of sulfonated-GO on SPEEK for DMFC applications. When GO was sulfonated, the amount of sulfonic groups (SO3H) increased, considerably improving the proton conductivity of NCM. Furthermore, sulfonated-GO-filled membranes showed better mechanical stability than GO-added membranes and successfully stopped the flow of water and CH4O molecules through the membrane. As shown in Fig. 18(b), added sulfonic functional groups can act as a penetration route for protons, improving the membrane proton conductivity, considerably more than adding GO NPs. However, sulfonated-GO is efficient only up to a certain degree of loading, creating negative blocking effects beyond that. Similarly, sulfonated-GO and Fe3O4 were mixed, and the solution was put in a SPEEK/PVA matrix to create an NCM for DMFCs. The varying concentrations of sulfonated-GO/Fe3O4 NSs were utilized, followed by NCM performance testing. The findings indicated that including sulfonated-GO/Fe3O4 in a SPEEK/PVA mixture can improve the proton conductivity, CH4O barrier characteristics, and mechanical stability of NCMs. The best concentration of sulfonated-GO/Fe3O4 NSs was 5 wt%, with a low permeability of 8.83 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1, elevated proton conductivity of 0.084 S cm−1 at 25 °C, high tensile strength of 51.2 MPa, and good power density of 122.7 mW cm−2 at 180 °C.418 Currently, sulfonated-GO is being utilized to functionalize chitosan biopolymers (CS) for DMFCs [103]. Essentially, chitosan has limited proton conductivity and requires further modification to work well in essential energy applications. Thus, varying sulfonated-GO loadings were employed in the chitosan matrix to improve the electrochemical characteristics of the membrane. Consequently, the permeability of the sulfonated-GO-filled membrane was reduced by 23%, while the conductivity was enhanced by 454%; hence, the selectivity increased by 650% compared to the pure chitosan membrane.419
To maximize the characteristics of NCM, sulfonated-GO was functionalized with SPEEK. Jiang et al.422 effectively formed GO using 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and produced sulfonated organosilane F-GO (SSi-GO). SSi-GO was mixed with the SPEEK polymer, and the resulting GO-based CMs was evaluated in a DMFC. The inclusion of GO significantly improved the water absorption, IEC, and proton conductivity of the NCM. Furthermore, the optimum and regulated SSi-GO content showed approximately 17% and 38% greater power densities compared to Nafion-115 and Nafion-112 membranes, respectively. Thus, for future DMFCs, the SPEEK/SSi-GO membranes provide a low-cost, high-performance membrane alternative. Although sulfonated-GO has demonstrated extraordinary effects on membrane alteration, its properties are not restricted to this level and can be functionalized for some more effective forms. Several studies looked at the impact of novel functionalized sulfonated-GO forms on PEM changes. Recently, a sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membrane was modified for DMFCs using sulfonated propylsilane GO (SP-sulfonated-GO)423 and sulfonated imidized GO (SIGO).424 The inclusion of SP-sulfonated-GO in the SPI matrix increased its proton conductivity, thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability, and the bound content of water, which caused delayed dehydration of the membrane. In addition, the SPI/SP-sulfonated-GO NC PEM exhibited enhanced self-humidification and different acidic functional groups, which are responsible for water barrier characteristics and proton conduction, respectively. The addition of graphene increased the hydrogen bonding, resulting in organic polymer chains and linked graphene NSs, which offer a hydrophilic–hydrophobic phase separation and suitable proton-conducting channel structure, respectively. The greatest power density of the SPI/SP-sulfonated-GO CM was 75.06 mW cm−2 at 700 °C, whereas Nafion-117 had a power density of 62.40 mW cm−2.423 SP-sulfonated-GO was employed in a slightly modified version in another investigation. The same group functionalized graphene to N,N-dimethylenephosphonic acid propylsilane GO (NMP-sulfonated-GO) and distributed it in a matrix for DMFCs (N-o-sulfonic acid benzyl chitosan (NSBC)). The NSBC/NMP-sulfonated-GO CMs were evaluated for the same criteria as the SP sulfonated-GO-CM previously described. The results clearly demonstrated the potential benefits of graphene with respect to the stability (thermal, mechanical, and chemical), water retention capabilities, and proton conductivity of NCMs. The functional mechanisms of SP-sulfonated-GO, NMP-sulfonated-GO, and SIGO in polymer matrices are comparable, as detailed by the authors.425 Consequently, identical results were obtained with the integration of SIGO in the SPI matrix under similar conditions. The resulting SPI/SIGO had superior water retention capacity, increased mechanical, oxidative, and thermal stabilities, and high bound water content. Furthermore, the SPI/SIGO CM exhibited an IEC of 2.24 meq g−1, proton conductivity of 11.38 × 10−2 S cm−1, bound water content of 5.12%, and CH4O permeability of 10.52 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1. The greatest power density increased from 57.12 mW cm−2 (pristine SPI membrane) to 78.53 mW cm−2 (SIGO-filled membrane) at 700 °C using 2 M CH4O fuel. Furthermore, sulfonated-GO has excellent compatibility with Nafion polymer and is commonly utilized as an NC PEM for DMFCs. Sulfonated-GO NPs have a considerable influence on the Nafion polymer matrix, altering the electrochemical characteristics of the resulting NCM.
Chien et al.426 disseminated sulfonated-GO in the Nafion matrix to improve the structure of NCM for use in DMFC. The sulfonated-GO-filled membrane exhibited significantly improved CH4O permeability, water uptakes, swelling ratio, proton conductivity, and CH4O selectivity. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 18(c), they observed the considerable influence of the sulfonated-GO loading rheology of the Nafion polymer solution, where the cooperative bonding interaction between the sulfonated-GO particles and Nafion polymer may be the basis for the development of membrane characteristics. Furthermore, the backbone of the Nafion/sulfonated-GO-CM had a higher relaxation transition temperature, better P tolerance, and high storage modulus. XRD also demonstrated ionic cluster shrinking, which reduced the CH4O crossover in the NCM. In 1 M and 5 M CH4O solutions, the performance of the sulfonated-GO-based NCMs with DMFCs was superior to that of the commercially available Nafion-115 membrane. Furthermore, Choi et al.427 synthesized sulfonated-GO and distributed it in a Nafion polymer matrix for DMFC use. They created a homogeneous solution of sulfonated-GO and Nafion before casting the NCM. The scientists reported that the sulfonated-GO-filled NCMs outperformed the recast Nafion membrane in PEMFCs. Functionalization of polymeric membranes is critical for achieving excellent DMFC performances, where graphene has emerged with tremendous characteristics and has become the focus for PEM modifications in energy applications. Despite the scarce literature on graphene-NM-based membranes for DMFCs, the current study is capable of demonstrating the potential benefits of GO as a membrane material. The functionalization flexibility of 2D graphene NMs can lead to significant advances in membrane development for future FCs. The research on graphene-based membranes in FCs recently has been quite successful, which will undoubtedly serve as a template for future membrane research for energy applications. Although PEMFCs and DMFCs are different energy applications, the expected features and functionalities of graphene-filled membranes in both are basically identical. In summary, the addition of GO has introduced several great alternatives to pure Nafion membranes, which has also performed well with other polymers such as SPEEK, PBI, and PVA, strengthening their capabilities as PEMs for DMFCs. Furthermore, sulfonated-GO has demonstrated great impacts on the performance of PEMs in DMFCs; additionally, various types of sulfonated-GO, for example, SP-sulfonated-GO, NMPSO, and SIGO have demonstrated good results. However, sulfonated-GO requires more attention to be functionalized more effectively with the most suitable polymers to manufacture the necessary PEMs for DMFCs. Though the analysis concentrated on PEMFCs and DMFCs, the potential benefits of graphene-based membranes are not limited and have a substantial impact on the performance of other FCs.
Several investigations have been conducted on graphene utilizing Nafion NC as a membrane. Lin and Lu406 investigated a Nafion-115 membrane laminated with well-oriented GO paper and found that this type of NCM performed better in high CH4O-concentration DMFC systems. This is because the parallel alignment of the GO paper results in the successful prevention of CH4O crossing. Lee et al.383 conducted another investigation in which two types of membranes were prepared, i.e., Nafion/GO-based NCMs and Nafion/Pt–graphene-based NCMs. The water uptake and proton conductivity of both membranes were compared, and it was found that the water absorption of the Nafion/GO-based NCMs was much larger than that of the Nafion/Pt–G-based NCMs. This is because of the hydrophilic nature of GO, whereas Pt is hydrophobic, resulting in reduced water absorption. Furthermore, the Nafion/GO-CM exhibited greater proton conductivity due to the increased GO concentration.
Besides GO, another strategy was used to change graphene by adding sulphur to make sulfonated-GO, with PEMs in DMFCs performing significantly better as a result of sulfonated-GO. The sulfonated-GO outperformed GO in mechanical stability and efficiently avoided water and CH4O passage across the membrane. In addition, sulfonated-GO has sulfonic functional groups, which act as a proton permeate channel, increasing the membrane proton conductivity rather than increasing the amount of GO particles.417 However, at a certain level of loading, the performance of sulfonated-GO NM is ineffective and causes undesired blocking effects. Nicotera et al.428 studied aligned sulfonated-GO membranes and discovered an outstanding CH4O crossover blocking effect in an orthogonal route. This is the result of the elevated operating temperature (which may exceed 130 °C), which caused the twisting of the pathways to increase, while maintaining high proton mobility. The results further indicated that the Ohmic loss in a single DMFC decreased and that the appropriate power density was achieved at high temperature. Hence, the operating range of DMFCs is extended to elevated temperature. Hung-Chung426 conducted another investigation on DMFC membranes in which Nafion-115 was produced with sulfonated-GO. It was observed that the inclusion of sulfonated-GO improved the characteristics of the membranes, notably their permeability, conductivity, and mechanical stability.


6.3.4. Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs). 
As the electrolyte, MCFCs or high-temperature FC devices employ a mixture of alkali and molten carbonate salt.314 Negative ions are delivered to the anode of MCFCs through a penetrating membrane. Water and electrons are produced on the anode when electrons combine with hydrogen. Because conductive slats are generated by molten carbonates at higher working temperature (600–700 °C), MCFCs do not require reformers or precious noble metal (Pt and Ni) electrocatalysts. Self-reforming occurs when the fuel (natural or synthetic gas) reforms itself at high temperature in the FC device. Higher working temperature and corrosive electrolytes have several disadvantages, for instance, increased corrosion and reduced device life. The greatest efficiency achievable with MCFCs is between 60–80%. Currently, MCFCs are being tested for commercial applications.314


6.3.5. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). 
SOFCs are devices that transform chemical energy from hydrogen-enriched fuels into electricity. Because of their lower CO2 emissions, they are considered as a more ecologically benign energy source. In SOFCs, negative charged ions are transported to the anode by membrane penetration, creating water and electrons through interactions with hydrogen. These electrochemical conversion devices work at a temperature ranging from 600 °C to 1000 °C, with ions being conducted via oxide. SOFCs do not change the solid state, despite their high working temperature. SOFCs can get enhanced reaction rates at high operating temperature without the need of pricey metallic electrocatalysts. Furthermore, because gases are internally reformed at a higher working temperature, natural gas may be used directly as a fuel without the use of an external reformer.429 SOFCs may attain a maximum PCE of 50–60%. SOFCs use a solid and nonporous metal oxide ceramic electrolyte (e.g., yttrium oxide stabilized with zirconium oxide (YSZ)).314 BiMeVOx (Bi-bismuth, Me additive metal, V-vanadium, and OX–O2), in addition to Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2, can be utilized as an electrolyte in SOFCs. These devices are among the most well-known commercialized FC devices, with applications ranging from micro to several MW. Fig. 19(a) depicts the operating conditions of a type of FC.314 The integration of GO in electrodes has the potential to significantly lower the operating temperature of SOFCs. Khalil Ahmad et al.430 investigated the incorporation of 1 wt% and 1.5 wt% GO-based NMs concentrations in the La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.4Ti0.6O3 (LSFT) cathode material (Fig. 19(b)). The LSFT oxide material was created using the sol-gel method. The XRD technique was employed to study the crystal structure and crystallite sizes, which were 73–103 nm. The SEM analysis revealed the homogeneous and porous shape of the materials. FTIR spectroscopy was used to analyze the functional group information. Electrical conductivity was measured in air in the temperature range of 300–600 °C. The electrical conductivity increased significantly for the GO-containing LSFT cathode up to a maximum value of 7 S cm−1 for 1.5% GO-LSFT in an air environment at 600 °C. The minimum area-specific resistance (ASR) value was also computed, and the lowest value obtained was 0.02 cm2 for the same sample. Based on 1.5% GO-LSFT-produced cathode material, a peak power density of 362 mW/cm2 was attained.

6.3.6. Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs). 
The electrolyte used in PAFCs is an inorganic, chemically and thermally stable liquid H3PO4. Positively charged (H+) ions must be transferred from the electrolyte to the cathode for PAFCs to function. Heat and water are produced at the cathode when (H+) ions interact with electrons and oxygen. Graphite-based BPPs, a Pt/C electrocatalyst over a carbon electrode, and a diffusion layer are components of PAFC stack assemblies.347 The efficiency of PAFCs varies from 40% for pure electricity to 80% for combined power and heat generation. The operating range for PAFCs is 150–220 °C due to the possibility of electrolyte liquefaction at this temperature, where an active mechanism is needed to avoid warmness and electrolyte depletion. PAFCs have several benefits, including excellent stability, resistance to impurities, greater conductivity, and higher power for commercial use.431


6.3.7. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs). 
MFCs are new bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) that convert microbial metabolic energy directly to electricity. MFCs devices are well-known for their ability to generate bioelectricity from biodegradable substrates found in wastewater. Specifically, MFCs are green, sustainable energy sources that generate electricity by using the chemical energy in organic waste, with environmental bioremediation combined with power generation. This is accomplished by microbial metabolism, which releases the e−s trapped in organic substrates and transfers them to solid electrodes via direct or indirect extracellular electron transfer pathways. In principle, the bacterial film in MFC devices acts as an electrocatalyst, converting organic and inorganic materials into electrical current.432 In the event of a closed external circuit by load, the bacteria create the electron and hole transport it to the anode, where electrons travel to the cathode. The produced protons simultaneously travel through the PEM.433
One of the key barriers in the practical use of MFCs is their poor efficiency. Besides the inoculum, the electrode SSA, cell design, proton exchange material, and substrate all have an impact on the performance of MFCs. The anode material has a significant impact on power production because it has the most accessible area for bacterial cells to cultivate, and thus affects the surface electron transfer resistance. Therefore, a high-productivity anode material is critical to further improve the MFC output power performance. The roughness, area, biocompatibility, and potential of anode surfaces all have a substantial impact on the anodic response. The addition of NMs to the anode is one of the most successful strategies to improve the anode performance, which has a beneficial impact on the power production capacities of MFC devices. Because of their outstanding conductivity, vast SSA, and strong mechanical strength, graphene NMs have piqued the curiosity of many researchers. One of these major and promising applications is the direction of MFCs. The low productivity of MFCs compared to other FC technologies and the high cost of their components are the two main barriers preventing their industrialization. Graphene is proposed to assist in overcoming these issues by integrating it with biocatalysts for the construction of graphene-based MFCs, either as an anode to improve electron transfer efficiency or as a cathode to efficiently catalyze the ORR. This integration is only important if there is a conductive environment for bacterial bio-film adhesion to the 2D graphene-based NM modified surfaces (Fig. 20).

To increase the performance of MFCs, PEMs must have exceptional features.435 Because the performance of pure polymeric membranes has been shown to be restricted, scientists have focused on the effective functionalization of polymer or inorganic fillers to optimize the existing efficiency of MFCs. Besides Nafion, several polymers have been identified as potential electrolytes for MFCs; however, a few of them have been shown to be unsuccessful with respect to thermal and electrochemical stability, gas permeability, tensile strength, and ionic conductivity, resulting in their rejection. Alternatively, the use of inorganic fillers and their combination with other polymers can help to eliminate some of the issues associated with the rejected PEMs. For example, the addition of graphene-NMs to PVA-based electrolytes has enhanced tensile strength and proton conductivity. Khilari et al.436 used solution casting to create a graphene-NM-based modified PVA silicotungstic acid (PVA-STA) membrane for MFCs. They created a 100 μm-thick membrane by synthesizing GO NMs using a modified Hummers' technique and a PVA-STA solution. According to electron-impedance-spectroscopy (EIS), the addition of 2D graphene NMs increased the conductivity of the PVA-STA-GO membrane to 0.065 S cm−1; meanwhile, the conductivity of the pure PVA-STA membrane was about 0.046 S cm−1 and that of the Nafion-117 membrane was 0.062 S cm−1. Furthermore, the inclusion of GO NMs resulted in improved mechanical characteristics, i.e., 9.1, 31.3, and 37 MPa for the PVA-STA-GO, Nafion-117, and PVA-STA membranes, respectively. Furthermore, the power density of the GO-NM-based filled membrane was good at 1.19 W m−3, while the power density of Nafion-117 was 0.88 W m−3. Furthermore, Leong et al.437 created a PEM with a graphene-NM-based modification for MFCs. The authors created a GO/SPEEK NCM by using SL GO-NMs as a nano-filler in SPEEK. To determine the functional benefits of the graphene-NMs contained in the polymer matrix, the GO-NM-filled membranes were compared to Nafion-117 and pure SPEEK membranes. The results showed that the GO/SPEEK-based NCMs had the best selectivity, proton conductivity of 1.48 × 10−3 S cm−1, oxygen diffusion coefficient of 1.154 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and water uptake of 85.4%. Furthermore, the GO/SPEEK-based NCMs exhibited the maximum Coulombic efficiency (16.88%). In addition, the power density of the GO/SPEEK NCM was 902 mW m−2, which was higher than that of pure SPEEK membrane (812 mW m−2). However, in MFCs, the Nafion-117 membrane achieved the maximum power density of 1013 mW m−2.437 Because of its equivalent power density and good efficiency, the GO/SPEEK NCM is a potential and less expensive alternative to the Nafion-117 membrane for MFCs.

7. Applications of graphene nanomaterials for bipolar plate uses in fuel cells
The operational stability and endurance of FC devices are crucial for their practical use. The bipolar plates (BPPs) used in FC stacks typically corrode during oxidation, resulting in less stable devices with poor performances. In FCs, BPPs are employed for current collection, gas and heat distribution, and mechanical support. The BPPs should have high electrical and thermal conductivity, low interfacial contact resistance, low gas permeability, high corrosion resistance, and high mechanical strength, and be lightweight and inexpensive. Graphite is the most commonly used material for BPPs in PEMFCs because of its elevated corrosion resistance and high conductivity (103 S cm−1), but its mechanical strength is low and its fabrication costs are relatively high. Metallic BPPs have high electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, but they are not corrosion resistant in acidic environments. Because of these drawbacks, alternative BPPs with graphene modifications have been developed. As a protective coating for metallic BPPs, anti-corrosive graphene has been employed.
The performance of ordinary Cu and Ni-BPPs degrades with time. Alternatively, graphene-containing BPPs have been shown to be more durable and steady in operation. Consequently, graphene-based materials are a viable option for the BPPs in FCs. Through current–voltage–power (I–V–P) experiments, Lee et al.438 examined the performance of CVD-based graphene coated on Cu as BPPs. As shown in Fig. 21(a)–(d), the results verified that the graphene-coated Cu-BPPs in a single cell outperformed pure Cu-BPPs. The reduced efficiency of a single FC device employing a Cu-BP panel is caused by the surface oxidation of Cu. Furthermore, after 5 h of exposure, Cu-BPP exhibited an increased “Rs” and poor performance. In contrast, the graphene-coated Cu-BPP performed better than the pure Cu-BPP. The graphene coating protected the Cu plate from oxidation and boosted its longevity without sacrificing its performance. As a result, graphene-coated Cu-BPP is a viable option for the fabrication of high-performance, low-cost, long-lasting FC devices.

Sim et al.439 studied the long-term operational stability of 3D graphene-coated Ni-foam (NiF) ((3D-G/NiF) for BPP applications. Thermal annealing for a brief period produced highly crystalline ML 3D graphene coatings from poly(methyl methacrylate). In comparison to previous BPPs, the generated 3D-graphene/NiF retained a low corrosion current density after exposure to the operating environment. Furthermore, at a cell potential of 0.5 V, a hydrogen/air FC device with 3D-graphene/NiF BPPs achieved the highest power density of 967 mW cm−2.
According to the findings in Fig. 21(e)–(h), 3D-graphene can be employed as a protective layer for long-lasting BPPs in high-performance FC devices. Kakati et al.443 described natural graphite (NG), carbon black, carbon fiber (CF), and graphene polymer NC for BPPs in their article. To analyze the influence of NCs, the device performance, electrical conductivity of the BPP, corrosion current, flexural strength, and deflection at mid-span tests were done. The incorporation of CF with graphene in these NC BPPs resulted in a considerable increase in flexural strength from 45.97 to 54.23 and 57.28 MPa. Similarly, the deflection at mid-span changed from 3.03–5.2% and then up to 5.85%. The only difference is that the inclusion of CF reduced the conductivity of the BPPs. The inclusion of graphene improved the in-plane and through-plane conductivities, which varied from 424.96 to 435.31 and 115.71 to 130.17 S cm−1, respectively. The modification with CF increased the corrosion current, whereas the modification with graphene had no such impact. Because of the increased electrical conductivity of the graphene-based modified BPPs, the device performance was boosted from 397 to 437 mW cm−2 and the current density to 752–827 mA cm−2.
Jiang et al.444 investigated the use of graphene nanoplatelets (G-NPs) as the primary filler content in BPPs. As a small filler, poly phenylene sulphide (PPS) with CB was used. The flexure strength of the resulting PPS/G-NP- and PPS/CB/G-NP-based NCs increased monotonically with an increase in the G-NP concentration. Furthermore, enhanced permeability resistance and in-plane conductivities were recorded for both NCs. Fig. 21(i) and (j) depict the electrical conductivities of the NCs. Here, we conclude with graphene nanostructures as potential future uses for BPPs in electrochemical energy conversion devices. However, there are still obstacles in the use of graphene materials in BPPs. It was discovered that graphene had no progress in corrosion resistance at high temperature (>60 °C) for stainless steel plates without Ni coating or for Al-plates, which can be attributed to the galvanic corrosion mechanism or the reaction between ions and defect/grain boundaries in graphene. Because of the poor electrical conductivity of GO- and rGO-based coatings, the interfacial contact resistance may increase. Furthermore, the adhesion of hydrophobic graphene-NMs to metallic plates without the use of a binder is difficult. The binder invariably increases the interfacial contact resistance and expense. Another problem is creating gas flow pathways in graphene-based NMs without compromising their electrical and corrosion-resistant qualities.
For the use of FCs, especially PEMFCs for automotive applications in the late twentieth century, BPPs have continuously developed and innovated. However, further advances in stack power density to 6.0 kW l−1 and 9.0 kW l−1 will present further technological hurdles, still requiring a 20% contribution of power density from BPPs. In this section, we also explain the technical constraints of BPPs and address the basic issues involved in specific technical designs, in conjunction with publications from the US DOE and also Japan NEDO.19,445 Using these studies as examples, and Toyota and Honda products, we offer a complete review of the technological issues faced during the last two decades,30,446,447 as shown in Fig. 22. As a result of their long-term progress and outstanding advancement, both carbon and metal BPPs have been investigated. The mass transfer capacity is a critical parameter in the design of BPPs, which is mostly determined by the flow field structure.

As illustrated in Fig. 22, there are now two proven design paths for BPPs. The first involves modifying and narrowing their channel-rib structure, while the second involves developing flow fields without ribs but with micro-baffles or porous structures. These pathways offer several advantages over traditional designs, but they also introduce additional challenges. The 3D fine-mesh BPPs of the first-generation MIRAI, for example, displayed effective mass transfer, with baffles stamped in a fish-scale pattern. Alternatively, the tearing process results in fracture surface fractures, exposing the metallic substrate to an acidic electrochemical environment. Additionally, incremental stamping of improved meshes increase the cost of BPPs. The US DOE expects BPPs to achieve permeability to hydrogen and oxygen of less than 2 × 10−6 m2 by 2020, although present flow channels/fields with a depth of less than 0.5 mm may easily achieve a permeability of 10−8 m2. In the second-generation MIRAI, Toyota has replaced the 3D flow field with a 2D wavy channel. Recent BP design revisions suggest that the mass transfer capacity may not be a serious problem for contemporary stacks. However, there is still a gap between the current state (4.4 kW l−1 for second-generation MIRAI) and the power and current density targets (set by Japan NEDO). A simultaneous increase in the gas flow rate may worsen the pressure drop and mal-distribution in the flow channels/fields, resulting in an increase in parasitic power loss, local fuel famine, and hence mass-transfer loss.
Another concern is the liquid removal caused by the high rate of electrochemical water formation. Although improved MEAs can work at lower humidity levels, water condensation and build-up are still difficult to prevent, especially at current densities of 2 A cm−2 and above.448 However, at an operating temperature above 100 °C, evaporation may ameliorate this issue significantly. In summary, improving the mass transfer remains a major problem for the design of BPPs for next-generation PEMFCs. Other problems with the BPP design are related to heat and electron conduction. Given that the amount of heat evacuated via mass flow or dissipated from the cell edges is comparatively small, the majority of the waste heat must be transmitted through the MEA and BPPs before being removed by the external radiator coolant by thermal convection.449 The BPP has a thermal conductivity roughly 30-times that of the GDL or CL for a stack with a power density of around 4 kW l−1, but the interfacial thermal resistance between the BPPs and GDL can be about 10-times that of BPPs.450 The electrical resistance between the BPPs and GDL (about 10−6 m2) is roughly 4-orders of magnitude greater than that in BPPs (approximately 10−10 m2). Despite the fact that modern metal separators can readily achieve thermal and electrical conductivity values of 50 W m−1 K−1 and 1.4 × 106 S m−1, respectively, which are significantly greater than the US DOE standards for 2020, their interfacial resistance is equivalent. The Japan NEDO requested that the output voltage and operating temperature be increased from their existing levels of 0.65V and 90–100 °C to 0.85 V and 120 °C in 2040, respectively. Thus, the primary goal is to lower the thermal and electrical interfacial contact resistance between the BPPs and GDL, which are affected by the cell stack compactness, contact area between the BPPs and MEA, BPP surface roughness, and substrate conductivity. Furthermore, for the construction of a compact cell, the current coolant channels must be combined with hydrogen and/or air distributors, implying a trade-off between increasing the cooling capacity and decreasing thickness.
The durability of BPPs is primarily impacted by their electrochemical corrosion and mechanical deterioration. A further increase in current density (about 3.8 A cm−2 by 2030, according to the Japan NEDO) may result in an increase in the electrochemical corrosion of the components, which is the primary cause of cell failure, particularly for metal BPPs. Corrosion also happens in carbon; however, it is essentially non-existent under the typical working settings. To prevent corrosion, the BPP is usually coated with passive materials capable of creating low-resistance oxide layers or by deposition of corrosion-resistant coatings. The homogeneity of defect-free coatings, stable passive films, or nitride layers451 determines the corrosion resistance efficiency. The corrosion current density of the anode and cathode BPPs should be restricted to 1 A cm−2 in 2020452 according to the US DOE guidelines. Existing coatings on SS 316L (or graphite), such as multi-layer chromium carbide and amorphous carbon, already satisfy these criteria. However, sophisticated coating techniques are still required for improving the corrosion resistance, lowering the contact resistance, and crucially, reducing the coating cost.453,454 Mechanical swelling and shrinking of the MEA, and gas and coolant pressure changes can cause load and pressure fluctuations in metal BPPs, resulting in plastic deformation and fatigue failure.455 The 2020 US DOE flexural and impact strength standards for BPPs are 25 MPa and 40.5 J m−1, respectively. These characteristics have previously been addressed by typical BPP substrate materials such as stainless steel (by Honda456) and flexible graphite (by Ballard457). However, during the production process or long-term operation, localized thickness loss, fractures, and susceptibility to plastic deformation are expected. Furthermore, high compact pressure can cause the deformation of BPPs and their poor contact with the GDL458 in refined ribs, ultrathin plates, meshes, baffles, and metal ligaments.
Although reaching the desired transport capabilities, the manufacturing capacity of BPPs should match the industrial basis for the mass manufacture of FC products. Relying on the substrate material, production capacity, and coating technique,459 the cost and volume of BPPs can account for more than 30% and 70% of the whole PEMFC stack, respectively. The US DOE requirement for the total BPP cost in 2020, including materials, fabrication, and coating is US $3 kW−1. However, the cost of the substrate material alone, for example, SS 316L, is over US $2.7 kW−1, making this goal difficult to attain. Moreover, although the use of ultra-refined plates has recently become a popular strategy for the design of BPPs, it necessitates high-precision and quick manufacturing procedures for metal or graphite substrates, such as progressive stamping and compression moulding. The precision and consistent fabrication of both BPPs and coatings is expected to create significant technological challenges for high-volume production. Consequently, both the Japan NEDO and the United States DOE have highlighted the importance of cost reduction for BPPs for the advancement of FC technology and the FCV industry.19
7.1. Integrated porous bipolar plate-MEA design
Recently, a new type of BPPs w proposed, which uses metal/graphene porous foam as a reactant distributor.460 Due to their appropriate mechanical characteristics, porous BPPs with a reduced volume and weight can attain by uniform mass and heat distribution.461 These porous materials can be manufactured at a much lower cost than refined ribs or baffles, and their geometric parameters, including porosity, pore density and pore shape are controllable.462 This may permit the complete elimination of the GDL, where its substitution with a porous material for mass transport between the CL and external environment that is an integrated porous BPP-MEA design. Additionally to provide a very compact FC, this integration may beneficially remove the interfacial transport of mass, heat and e−s in the BPPs and GDL, thus avoiding interfacial transport resistances. Tanaka et al.463 developed a GDL-free FC device using a corrugated SS mesh flow channel rather than a porous material and a freestanding MPL, indicating the probability of integration. Park et al.462 studied graphene foam to manufacture a unified flow field/GDL lacking an MPL, where the FC thickness was reduced by 82%, while achieving a high power output over a broad current density range. Even though an enhanced performance was attained with a thinner cell in the integrated BPP-MEA design, porous flow field materials with high conductivity are vulnerable to chemical corrosion in an acidic environment. Therefore, effective coating materials and coating methods for 3D porous structures are essential to achieve long-term operational stability. Furthermore, porous materials reveal a lower stiffness than conventional-based BPPs. A BPPs stiffness improvement process, such as compression, is essential to avoid over-deformation of the flow field. In summary, integrated BPP-MEA or GDL-less design can concurrently develop mass transport, alleviate water flooding and decrease the volume of PEMFC stacks, and thus may present a promising approach to achieve an ultrahigh power density (9 kW l−1), owing to the considerable improvement in stack compactness.19
8. Graphene as electrocatalysts in fuel cells
The ORR reaction at the cathode and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode power hydrogen FCs (HFCs). However, the ORR has been the focus of the graphene electrocatalyst-driven HFC research over the last decade. According to reports, the processes at the anode and cathode in FCs are catalyzed by noble metals (including Pt, Ru, Pd, and Au), non-precious metal (e.g., Ni), and their alloys. Pt is the one of them that is most usually utilized as an electrode reaction electrocatalyst, particularly for FCs with low operating temperature.464 The drawbacks of these noble metals include their high cost, limited availability, poor reaction kinetics, low resistance to CO-poisoning, and crossover effects originating from fuel molecules diffusing from the anode to cathode.465 By adding an electrocatalyst support, the electro-active SSA and catalytic activities can be enhanced, the cycle stability and durability boosted, and the electrode cost reduced. Due to its low cost, carbon black is frequently chosen as a support for numerous FCs.466 Other non-carbon-467 and carbon-based materials, such as active pours-carbon,468 CNTs,469 graphite,470 and carbon aerogels,471 have been suggested as electrocatalyst supports. These electrocatalyst supports must have strong coupling with electrocatalysts, superior chemical and electrochemical stability in the electrolyte, with a big SSA for the even dispersion of the catalyst, and be reasonably priced.467,472 Large-SSA graphene can support and distribute electrocatalyst NPs uniformly to prevent inter-particle accumulation and increase the exposure of the electro-active area. Topographic flaws (for instance, vacancies, holes, edges, and distortion) and residual functional groups (for example, carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl) are frequently found in GO-derived graphene materials, which serve as an ideal substrate for electrocatalyst growth and immobilization with outstanding structural stability and interactions.473 The charge transfer from nanocatalysts to graphene and mass movement over the electrode surface may be enhanced, which lead to elevated conductivity, and the electrochemical stability of graphene coupled with its topographic flaws and residual functional groups can lead to high conversion efficiency.
As previously indicated, when graphene is used as an electrocatalyst support, the electro-catalytic activity for both the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) can be improved. Numerous studies have been conducted, particularly on Pt electro-catalyst hybrids with graphene-NMs. According to the findings, the increased implementation and activation of Pt on graphene NSs led to greater Pt on graphene NS dispersion because the graphene NSs had a bigger SSA. Additionally, they observed the microstructure of graphene, which includes flaws, functional groups, and interaction with Pt clusters.474 The tests performed to evaluate the performance of graphene NMs as electrocatalyst supports are listed below.
M/rGO (M = Pd, Pt, Au–Pd, Pd–Pt, Pd–Pt@Pt and Pt–Ag),475,476 MOx/rGO,477 and metal-free foreign element-doped graphene-based NM electrocatalysts demonstrated consistent activity in the ORR, as evidenced by their high current density output. Carbon materials with high SSA are thought to be effective electrocatalyst supports in FC devices. Doped graphene-NM derivatives with higher conductivity and charge transfer capabilities are predicted to increase the performance of FC devices when used as electrocatalyst supports. Tennyson et al.478 described boron (B)-doped graphene as a potential Pt electrocatalyst support and electrode in a solid acid FC (SAFC). The B-doped graphene NFs, created using pulsed laser ablation, performed well in a 250 °C SAFC (with cesium dihydrogen phosphate electrolyte). The decrease in graphene-NMs e− density caused by B-doping slowed oxygen chemisorption and stabilized the carbon electrodes in the hostile environment of the SAFC.
Kabir et al.479 investigated the performance of N-doped graphene in FCs as an electrode. They experimented with different N-moieties in the 2D graphene NMs and compared their ORR activity. Doped graphene-NMs with high amounts of hydrogenated-N and low levels of pyridinic-N exhibited the best current density, onset potential and half-wave potential. The authors postulated the ORR mechanism for each N-moiety based on their experimental results. Dong et al.480 observed the improved ORR performance of porous graphene foam doped with different elements, i.e., B, N, P, and Fe. H3BO3, (C6H5)2P, CN2H2, and FeCl2 were used as precursors, which were hard-templated with multi-doped graphene-NMs. To validate their practical application, the scientists investigated the electrode stability in various fluids. The negligible drop in half-wave potential revealed the enhanced stability of the electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes when evaluated at a constant potential. The multiple element-doped graphene foam demonstrated better catalytic activity than its single or dual-doped equivalents due to its high SSA, mesoporous structure, and synergistic effects.
Different forms of FCs contain Pt NPs attached to doped graphene-based NMs as electrocatalysts. One of the major difficulties for DMFCs is the MOR, which has been claimed to be improved by Pt-NPs supported on P–S co-doped graphene.481 Scientists deduced from DFT simulations that the creation of the P–C bonds improved the interaction between Pt and carbon by doping as a result of the change in charge density. In comparison to single-element-doped graphene-based NMs, the co-doped electrocatalyst showed greater electrochemical SSA, superior MOR activity and stability. Reda et al.482 theoretically studied the ORR electrocatalytic activity of N–G NMs. The authors noticed that the *O and *O2 adsorbates were more stabilized on the basal plane. They concluded through DFT calculations that the increased free N and solvation effects were responsible for the better electrocatalyst function than metal-based electrocatalysts.
Kabir et al.483 investigated the ORR catalytic activity of 3D N-doped graphene-supported Pd NCs for AEMFCs. Compared to Pd/carbon-black and other graphene NCs, the 3D-doped electrode had a greater onset potential for the ORR and a higher power density. The increased mass transfer kinetics and electrical characteristics of the support were responsible for the improved performance. Soft template assistance was used to generate co-doped N–S graphene-NMs using C3H6N6 and benzyl disulfide. The substance demonstrated strong CH4O tolerance and long-term FC electrocatalytic durability. Also, its high SSA and porous nano-architecture resulted in an improved performance. When combined with N-doped graphene, TM oxy-hydroxides also showed improved ORR activity. Li et al.484 presented as an example, a porous N-graphene encapsulated b-FeOOH hybrid. The surface FeO6 locations were converted into active sites, lowering the free energy gap of the ORR and improving the catalytic efficacy.
In acidic, neutral, and basic environments, the hybrid performed better than the commercial Pt/carbon electrocatalyst when used as a cathode in both MFCs and straight DMFCs. The TMs and oxides in doped graphene are frequently linked to the heteroatoms in the carbon network and have a promising future as FC electrode NMs. For instance, Kim et al.485 reported the use of N-doped graphene nano-platelets containing Fe for PEMFCs operating in acidic environments. Varga et al.486 examined the electrocatalytic activity of Co4N/N-graphene hybrids for AFCs in a recent research. Comparing the NCs to a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, they showed their greater tolerance to CH4O. Chuong et al.487 suggested that a ternary hybrid based on Fe2O3, MoS2, and N-graphene can solve the issue of CH4O crossover in cathodic electrocatalysts. An electrocatalyst with a high electron-transfer number (3.91–3.96) showed excellent operating stability. Pt/Au/Pt core/shell nanocrystals with 2D N-doped graphene NMs as a support were created by Xu et al.488 for the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid. This material, according to the scientists, may be regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts due to its increased mass and specific activity. Due to its high SSA and high electrolyte-accessible internal volume, the doped graphene displayed strong ORR activity and high power density. As an example, Wang et al.489 employed a graphene NM-based mesh/Co3O4 electrocatalyst that was B/N co-doped in a KOH solution (Fig. 23(a)–(f)).

Some study teams additionally looked at the crossover impact on the cathodic electrode ORR performance when alcohol (such as CH4O) is present. The outcome demonstrated that the graphene-based ORR electrocatalysts had strong tolerance to CH4O when added to the cathode area compared to the benchmark Pt/C cathode. This was also shown by the representative outcome exhibited by Prof. Wang's group in Zn-air battery research using a B/N co-doped graphene NM-based nano-mesh/Co3O4 electrocatalyst in KOH. Xie's group also used PtNCs@NGA to catalyze the ORR in H2SO4,492 and Lv's group used Pd-Cu NCs/rGO to catalyze the ORR in KOH493 (Fig. 23(g)–(i)). Similar to alcohol FC research, it is uncommon to see graphene-NM-based electrocatalyst-driven HFC or metal-air batteries at the device scale. Wang's group selected B/N co-doped graphene nano-mesh/Co3O4 as the cathodic material and MOx/rGO as the electrode material for a ZAB as a good illustration of this. After lengthy maintenance for 10 h, the battery displayed equivalent activity to the benchmark Pt/C cathode-driven ZABs, as evidenced by the battery performance during a single cycle of prolonged operation.489 In FCs, the cathode typically includes the reduction of O from the air, while the anode is associated with the oxidation of fuels (for example hydrogen, CH4O and CH2O2). The FC graphene hybrid electro-catalysts are shown in Table 12.

In a study on Pt/graphene electrocatalysts, Lei et al.521 produced electrocatalysts with the help of poly-diallyl dimethyl-ammonium (PDDA). The PEMFC performance and electrochemical stability were found to be very good. The uniform distribution of Pt-NPs on the surface of graphene was caused by the existence of PDDA, which improved the electrocatalytic activity. Ji et al.522 conducted a different analysis in which an effective and clean procedure was utilized, where ascorbic acid induced the reduction of the GO-NSs and Pt-NPs in a single step to create Pt-NPs attached to graphene-NSs. In comparison to regular Vulcan XC-72, these graphene-NM-supported Pt nano-clusters demonstrated higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for the electro-oxidation of CH4O. The Pd-NP electrocatalyst was removed using the pulse microwave-assisted polyol (MP) approach by Hsieh et al.523 from a graphene NS electrode for PEMFC with a variable pH. In contrast to employing GO NS, this MP approach used more graphene-based NS in a shorter time, where PEFCs were produced using a sub-nano-Pt anode electrocatalyst on GNS, according to a research by Yoo et al.524 In the hydrogen oxidation process (HOR), Pt electrocatalysts on graphene NSs were more CO-tolerant than Pt electrocatalysts on carbon black (Pt/CB). In the work by Liu et al.,525 graphene was written on the carbon fabric of the MFC anodes. Due to the great biocompatibility of graphene, the power density and energy conversion were enhanced. This advances bacterial development on the electrode surface and speeds up the transmission of electrons. Employing graphene as electro-catalysts still has problems to solve, such as electrocatalyst poisoning or corrosion, self-accumulation and oxidation of the electrocatalyst, and support in operational circumstances. However, due to the abundance of active sites in graphene, which aids in the uniform dispersion of electrocatalysts, utilizing doped-graphene or functionalized graphene as electro-catalyst supports for metal or oxide electrocatalysts can increase their electrocatalytic activity performance.179
In DMFCs, the MOR attracted the most research attention in alcoholic fuel electro-oxidation. Metal-loaded reduced graphene (M/rGO) and metal-loaded graphene aerogel (M/GA) have been the widely used electrocatalytic materials for the MOR in the last ten years. For 2D M/rGO or 3D graphene anodic electrocatalysts, Pt is the most often employed metal candidate. The Pt-loaded reduced graphene electrocatalysts (Pt/rGO or Pt/GA based) show stronger electrochemical activity in MeOH half-cell-scaled electro-oxidation than the commercial Pt/C, Pt/carbon-black or even pure Pt, according to results from various groups. This is demonstrated by the highest anodic sweep current density (Jf) of about 2540 A g−1 (unit mass)500 or 30 mA cm−2 (unit area).526 However, EtOH has emerged as a substitute fuel in the electro-oxidation investigation due to the toxicity of CH4O. Similar to the MOR, Pt-based graphene electrocatalysts have been widely employed in recent years and demonstrated significant activity in the EOR.527,528 The metal candidate was later replaced by a non-Pt monometallic or bimetallic electrocatalyst for the elimination of CO poisoning from the MOR and EOR in Pt/graphene anodic electrocatalysts due to the CO molecules blocking the active surface sites of Pt, which reduces the lifetime of the Pt/graphene electrocatalysts. Non-Pt mono-metallic electrocatalysts, such as, Pd, (2D M/rGO), Ni (2D M/rGO, 3D M/GF and M/GA), Cu, Ag, Au, and bimetallic catalysts (2D M/rGO and 3D M/GA or M/GF) have become alternatives.
These graphene electrocatalysts loaded with metals demonstrated significantly higher electrochemical activity in half-cell-scaled MOR (2D M/rGO and 3D M/GF), EOR (2D M/rGO and 3D M/GF and M/GA), butan-1-ol electro-oxidation (butan-1-ol OR),529 glucose electro-oxidation (GOR) (2D M/rGO and 3D M/GA) and formic acid electro-oxidation. In the MOR and EOR, these graphene-based electrocatalysts also outperformed monometallic Pt/graphene electrocatalysts. This was reflected in the high anodic peak current density observed from the best output current density of 4972 A g−1500 or 252 mA cm−2516 in the MOR, 2105.4 A g−1530 or 2219 mA cm−2531 in the EOR, and the best If/Ib ratio of 11.65 in the MOR530 and 5.45 in the EOR.532
Besides the MOR and EOR, butan-1-ol OR,529 FOR,533,534 and GOR535 catalyzed by graphene electrocatalysts have received attention in recent years. However, systematic research in this area is limited in comparison to the MOR and EOR, and non-Pt and bimetallic M/graphene electrocatalysts.536 M/rGO or M/GA-based electrocatalysts exhibit strong activity in the butan-1-ol OR (highest Jf:15.59 mA cm−2 or 105.98 mA mg−1125), FOR (max Jf: 61.6 mA cm−2533 or 3390 A g−1537), and GOR (max Jf:16.2 mA cm−2 (500–1248 cycles). To date, the majority of graphene electro-catalyst research has been done on a secondary substrate platform, for instance, glassy carbon electrode (GCE). These efforts involved the use of binding or stabilizing agents such as Nafion solution with ultrasonic handling for the manufacture of electrocatalyst inks. This approach has the unintended consequence of damaging the structure of graphene, which is especially noticeable for 3D graphene nanostructures. The use of a conductive binder also results in the binder reducing the catalytic active surface. A recent study showed that the use of a binder-free graphene electrode to increase the activity is an option. Binder-free graphene-NM-based electrodes provide various advantages over regular electrodes, as follows.
(1) Compared to the use of non-conductive and active binders, the specific capacity and conductivity of the electrode can be enhanced.
(2) The e− transport in the electrode can be improved by interconnecting or stacking graphene through self-assembly, forming a highly conductive and resilient network.
(3) Because of the great SSA of the electrode, the effective contact at the electrolyte and electrode interface reduces the diffusion resistance.538
Following the binder-free production of pure GA/NF as a direct SC electrode, the same chemical route was used to create a metal-loaded GA/NF direct electrode. High activity was reported for the MOR (max Jf = 798.8 A g−1) and EOR (max Jf = 862 A g−1) for the binder-free Pd/GA/NF electrode539 and EOR (max Jf = 3408.7 A g−1)540 and GOR (Ja2 = 379.4 A g−1541 for the binder-free Pd1Ptx/GA/NF. This discovery was exceptional in comparison to others made using typical electrode preparation procedures, with elevated stability of 150 cycles over 1248 cycles in the prolonged GOR and 100–500 cycles over 1456 cycles in the prolonged EOR. In comparison to the previously indicated basic half-cell-sized electrode study, a systematic investigation of graphene electrocatalysts in the FC unit is limited.542 The types of FC units were also restricted to DEFC543 and direct glucose FC (DGFC) units, with the findings demonstrating that the output power density and current density were greater than the existing non-graphene electrocatalyst-driven DEFC and DGFC units. Notably, the binder-free Pd1Ptx/GA/NF electrode plate-driven DEFC and DGFC units performed better than the Nafion-modified Pd1Ptx/GA/NF plate in the same DEFC (29.4% binder-free) and DGFC (66.5% binder-free) under similar fuel combination and working environments.
9. Conclusion and future prospects
Currently, graphene is an attractive material because of its superb electron transport capabilities and other characteristics, which its production developing swiftly. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the chemical and physical characteristics of graphene and its derivatives (i.e., GO, rGO, doped graphene, and functionalized graphene) for applications in FC technology. Herein, we summarized the latest performance and advancement in the use of graphene-based NMs in membranes, BPPs, and as electrocatalysts in many types of FC technology applications. The graphene dispersion over electrodes has exposed the enhanced introduction of electro-chemically active specific surface area for higher electrocatalytic activity toward fuel oxidation and oxidant reduction processes. The problems of device stack durability and performance deterioration caused by corrosion of the BPP are emphasized by employing materials based on graphene.
GO-based NMs offer a framework for investigating the relationships between the property and structure of polymer NCs. To improve the processibility, chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical characteristics of membranes, graphene is a superb material to mix with other polymers. In this review, we also methodically emphasized functionalized graphene as a viable membrane material for FCs, also enumerating the prospective benefits and most current developments in the production of graphene-based membranes and their impacts on the functionality of FCs. Proton conductivity, ionic conductivity, water absorption, decrease in CH4O permeability, IEC, ionic transport, swelling ratio, and proton transport are essential features of PEMs in FCs, which are positively altered by GO-NMs. It has been suggested that GO-NMs or their functionalized version be employed for membrane alterations in FCs because, in contrast to graphene, their attached oxygen groups (GO) are easily dispersible in common solvents. GO is primarily produced via the Hummer's technique, and subsequently GO-NMs may be further functionalized into other forms. According to studies, functionalized graphene-NMs are the most desirable fillers and materials with the most potential for use in FCs. GO-based NMs can be sulfonated or carboxylated chemically to enhance their properties even further. The mystery surrounding some parameters, such as the C/O ratio, water content, effective percentage as a filler, and the degree of sulfonation of GO, remains unsolved despite all the work reported on GO-based membranes. This calls for more focused research to examine the behavioral changes in GO as a filler with various polymer matrices. In addition, functionalizing ILs with GO filler has been proven to be more efficient for membrane modification; consequently, the use of GO-based fillers may one day prove to be an intriguing and successful technique to change the many properties of NCMs. However, this requires the thorough investigation of various functional groups and how they affect membrane modification. Research on graphene-modified polymer NCMs is accumulating swiftly and offering technical data and design guidance to improve their performance in a variety of energy applications. Studies on graphene-based polymeric membranes have entered a crucial stage of the product lifecycle, where they are being used in a variety of energy applications, with FC being one of the most alluring. The successful use of graphene in membrane alterations will be necessary to improve the existing situation and open up new prospects.
10. Rising issues in the industrial production of graphene nanomaterials and future development of fuel cells
Concerning problem of the uneven quality and characteristics of commercially accessible graphene NMs, there are two important issues. Firstly, as already noted, converting academic advancements into actual industrial development is now somehow difficult due to the need for precise control of the manufacturing methods, procedures, and product quality. Secondly, the graphene industry demands process repeatability, reliability, and clear gradation with respect to intrinsic qualities, performance related parameters, and modern techniques. This requires unified technological standardization, with a stable production process for graded products.
The industrial fabrication of graphene, with a focus on quality, affordability, repeatability, processability, and safety, provides the foundation for the commercialization of graphene NMs. The transition from lab size to pilot scale, and then to industrialization presents additional challenges that cannot be solved with simple mathematics. The structural characteristics of graphene NFs are extremely sensitive to the processing equipment and preparation conditions, which make them difficult to manage on an industrial scale. It is essential to improve the graphene product quality control. Recent studies on commercially available graphene-based NMs have revealed the poor genuine graphene content (less than 50%), low sp2-bond content (less than 60%), and significant levels of contamination, all of which are harmful for future nanotechnological applications. The mass manufacturing of graphene NFs also has to pay greater attention to uniformity and repeatability. For instance, there is a broad range of quality and inherent qualities in raw graphite materials used in exfoliation, which are sourced from diverse sources and often have varying morphologies and contaminants. Small graphene NFs are now only used commercially as additives for NCMs, where uniformity and performance repeatability are not necessary. Pollution issues arise from the use of surfactants, solvent, and graphene NM-based products, and some active oxidizing species are recognized as prone to detonation.544 Therefore, it will be crucial at the industrial scale to produce, store, transport, and apply graphene NFs in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.
Maximizing the total SSA of metal foil in the CVD chamber for graphene production is a clear strategy for increasing the production capacity in B2B processes for the industrial production of CVD graphene films. This is typically accomplished by broadening the CVD equipment or by effectively stacking metal foils. Both the macroscopic and microscopic environments will be altered significantly when scaled up. There would be a noticeable difference in the heat and mass transmission in the directions parallel and vertical to gas flow, especially at the microscopic level. The non-uniform thickness and domain size will drastically worsen the properties of the produced graphene. These problems can be possibly solved by using vertical gas flow, local feeding, or static sealing methods, in which formation chamber is supplied with enough reaction gas, and then sealed once it reaches the growth temperature. The mono-crystallization of the Cu-substrate, which may restrict the unidirectional orientation of the graphene-NM grains towards the creation of larger-size single crystals of graphene-NMs, is another efficient remedy.545 High-quality graphene can take several hours or even a whole day to produce (in big size), and a high-temperature B2B technique often results in a slow growth rate and low yield. Thus, there is a technical trade-off between quality and production speed.
Because the growth substrate is constantly moving during continuous dynamic production, the in-homogeneity of the heat and mass transport in the reaction chamber becomes a more significant component impacting the development. As a result of the restricted residence period of the substrate in the chamber during annealing and graphene-NM development in R2R, the film quality suffers given that the substrates typically move more quickly than graphene throughout its growth. Through the movement of heat and the carbon precursor, the formation of graphene in various places on the moving substrate can affect each another. For instance, downstream,546 graphene is added to the layer that was already created, while upstream, graphene is generated on a new substrate with inadequate annealing time. Some recent academic discoveries, such as mono-crystallization of metal substrates545 and exerting local control over the carbon supply to inhibit excess nucleation, can be used in the R2R technique to create homogeneous single-crystal graphene. Although Cu-foil is still the extensively used substrate for producing graphene thin films in large quantities, it is widely acknowledged that the Cu/Ni-alloy has special features that make it possible to manage the number of layers and domain size and accomplish rapid development.547 The progress of manufacturing methods for this alloy substrate would be further encouraged by the potential to produce high-quality graphene at a reasonable cost. The quality and performance of the produced graphene cost and its processability should be considered when determining the optimal substrate.5–7,10–13,15–17,43,45,52,55,56,60,63,67,69,71,73,548–609
Similar to the Si industry, graphene does not possess infinite potential. The secret to success depends in making advances in the techniques for the synthesis of this new material and identifying its most effective uses. As previously indicated, recent breakthroughs in research have discovered a number of possibilities for potentially fatal uses. Regarding applications in FCs, future GDL and MPL work should focus on optimizing cross-scale and cross-component transport, while remaining compatible with advancements in other components in terms of structural control and wettability. For the CL, innovative catalyst activities are sufficient at the RDE level but require significant progress at the MEA and stack levels. The use of molecular arrangements to modify carbon supports and catalyst/polymer interfaces has the potential to improve the ionomer distribution and catalyst usage. Because it offers great power density at ultralow catalyst loadings, the order-structured MEA is a promising choice. PFSA-based polymers with improved durability and flexibility are predicted to continue to dominate the PEM industry over the next 5–10 years. The long-term purpose of BPP design is to overcome the problems of corrosion, high manufacturing cost, and interfacial contact resistance. For future ultrahigh-power-density operations, the mass transport capacity must be increased. Because of the benefits of interface removal and volume reduction, the combined BP-MEA architecture is projected to give a viable route towards ultrahigh power density.
Although we should appreciate the ongoing attempts to reduce production costs, the cost of commercially available graphene NM-based items should be dictated by the performance of the product. Instead of only emphasizing the supply of inexpensive deals, the graphene research and industry community should concentrate on enhancing the quality and performance of graphene devices. Even if the price was 5-times higher, there would be a sizable demand for a product with a 10-fold increase in performance. Although graphene has been universally acknowledged as a promising 2DM with many intriguing features, it appears impossible to forecast the exact future of graphene business. Graphene industrialization and commercialization are long processes with no shortcuts to success; nonetheless, just a few years have gone from the initial transfer of academic research into practical applications. The graphene sector can have a better future thanks to ongoing advancements in industrial-scale material production and new, game-changing uses. Improving the power densities, lowering prices, and boosting the durability of FC devices will directly encourage large-scale commercialization. These three criteria are linked and restricted by each another, which should be evaluated holistically in the creation of various FC products. Overall, based on the existing framework of materials, building refined and controlled structural designs that can be quickly made is a crucial goal, and the creation of new 2D NMs is predicted to have far-reaching consequences in the long term.
