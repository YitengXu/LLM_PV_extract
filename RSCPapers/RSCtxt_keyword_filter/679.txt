A high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of up to 0.99 V was achieved in polymer solar cells with PCBM.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained considerable attention over the past few decades since they are lightweight, low cost, solution-processable and flexible devices.1–3 In particular, bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHSCs), comprising physical composites of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, are being intensively studied to achieve higher efficiencies in PSCs. Conducting polymers in these devices play the role of the electron donor while fullerene derivatives act as the electron acceptor. One of the common polymers used in PSCs are the 3-alkyl-substituted polythiophenes, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and (6,6)-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) composites routinely reaching up to 4–5%.4–7 Even though P3HT-based PSCs have shown promising results, insufficient light absorption of P3HT due to its bandgap (1.9 eV) and inability to control the molecular orbital energy levels8 limit its overall performance. Recently, a variety of low bandgap polymers that absorb more light by fine-tuning energy levels of polymers to better match their bandgaps with the solar spectrum have been reported. Among these dialkoxy substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) polymers have attracted our interest because of their exceptional performance as a common unit in PSCs with up to ∼8% efficiencies, which represents one of the highest efficiencies reported in the area of PSCs.9–12 Most dialkoxy substituted BDT based polymers have relatively high HOMO levels in the range of −4.90 to −5.22 eV leading to open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.56 V to 0.76 V and exhibiting PCEs up to 7.7%.10,12–14 Recently, dialkoxy substituted BDT units coupled with thienopyrrole were reported to have Voc of up to 0.91 V with PCE of 4.8%.15 While extensive research to control the bandgap and energy levels has been conducted by coupling alkoxy substituted BDT with various electron-withdrawing comonomers, few studies have been done on BDT itself.
Here, we report the design and synthesis of a new dialkylthio substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), which acts as an electron donor unit in BHSCs or in electron donor–acceptor conjugated polymers. There were several drivers for this research. First, the sulfur atom is known to be a poorer electron donor compared to the oxygen atom due to the poorer overlap of its orbitals with the π-system on the polymer backbone. This causes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymer to be lowered compared to alkoxy containing conducting polymers. Second, since sulfur and oxygen possess similar electronic properties, it could be anticipated that the excellent properties of the alkoxy substituted BDT for PSCs applications9–12 will still be retained in the S-analogs. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of conjugated polymers in PSCs are important factors because the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs is strongly related to the difference between the HOMO of the electron donor material, a conjugated polymer, and the LUMO of the electron acceptor, which are usually fullerene derivatives.16
Especially, a deeper HOMO level provides a greater difference between the HOMO of the electron donor (a conjugated polymer) and the LUMO of an acceptor such as PCBM, which may increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs. Third, the sulfur atom is amenable to further transformation to highly electron-withdrawing sulfoxide or sulfone functionality. The synthesis of dialkylthio BDT was conducted via a Newman–Kwart rearrangement (NKR), which is a well-known method for converting phenols to thiophenols as outlined in Scheme 1.

Compound 1 was prepared as reported17 and it was reacted with sodium borohydride to form 2. Compound 2 was treated with N,N-dimethyl thiocarbamoyl chloride, and the reaction was quenched by pouring into KOH solution followed by filtration to collect 3. It was then converted to 4 by a Newman–Kwart reaction (NKR) where the migration of the O-aryl to S-aryl occurs at high temperature. The ideal reaction condition for conversion to 4 was heating at 245 °C for 3 h in diphenyl ether. If the temperature were higher than 255 °C, less soluble dark powder would be obtained with lower recovery yield (30–40%), which could not be characterized. Also, under neat conditions, insoluble compounds were obtained. Under the optimized reaction conditions, we recovered the desired product in 79% yield with a purity of >95% by HPLC, which was sufficient to proceed to the next reaction step. Reduction of 4 with lithium aluminium hydride afforded 4,8-dimercaptobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, 5, with high recovery yield (∼94%), which was followed by alkylation with 2-ethylhexyl bromide to yield 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexylthio)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, 6, in a 54% yield after column chromatography. Here, we focus on the 2-ethylhexyl group side chain since it imparted superior solubility but various other alkyl groups could be similarly prepared. The monomer 7, 2,6-dibromo-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexylthio)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene, was obtained by treating 6 with bromine, whereas monomer 8, 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyl-thio) benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, could be prepared by forming the dianion of 6 with n-butyllithium, followed by reaction with trimethyltin chloride. Overall reaction yields from compound 1 to monomer 7 or monomer 8 ranged between 25–30%. The dialkylthio substituted BDT-based polymer, S-PBDT, was prepared by coupling monomers 7 and 8 through a Pd-catalyzed Stille reaction as shown in Scheme 2. The molecular weight of the S-PBDT polymer was Mn = 16.1 K with PDI = 3.81 by GPC. A 5% weight loss of the polymer under inert atmosphere occurred at 294 °C by TGA, which is acceptable thermal stability for polymer solar cell application.

The UV-vis absorption spectra for the S-PBDT in chloroform and in thin film are shown in Fig. 1(a). The polymer shows λmax of 497 nm and 536 nm in dilute solution and λmax of 507 nm and 548 nm in the solid state, respectively. The optical band gap of the S-PBDT was estimated from the absorption onset of the film, 594 nm, to be 2.08 eV. The electrochemical band gap of the S-PBDT polymer was determined by cyclic voltametry as shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from onset electrochemical oxidation (0.75 V) and reduction (−1.65 V) potentials. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the S-PBDT were −5.46 eV and −3.06 eV, respectively, and the electrochemical band gap of the S-PBDT was 2.40 eV, as shown in Fig. 1(b). S-PBDT, with its dialkylthio substituent, shows deeper HOMO and LUMO levels than the previously reported dialkoxy substituted BDT polymer analogue, 5.16 eV and 2.67 eV, respectively,13 while retaining other properties such as solubility, absorption and optical or electrochemical band gap. The deeper HOMO and LUMO levels result from the poorer electron donating ability of dialkylthio compared to dialkoxy substituents and support our molecular design strategy. The lower HOMO level should result in a larger difference with the LUMO level of an electron acceptor, PCBM, it may lead to a higher Voc when it is applied to PSCs. Since Voc is one of the main contributors to overall efficiency, polymers that include the dialkylthio substituted BDT unit have a potential to yield higher efficiencies in PSCs.

The highest PCE obtained to date of 2.75% was achieved from the device with a polymer and PCBM mixture ratio of 1:1. The most encouraging result from this work, however, is that Voc of the devices was close to 1.00 V, resulting from the deeper HOMO level of the polymer. An Isc of 5.45 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.51 were observed. We note that only a few homopolymers have achieved a PCE of more than 2% before being coupled to other monomers in electron donor–acceptor copolymers. The preliminary photovoltaic performance of the newly designed and synthesized dialkylthio BDT unit makes it promising as an electron donor material with the potential as a replacement for dialkoxy BDT in PSCs. Further studies including the optimization of photovoltaic performance of the S-PBDT homopolymer-based BHSCs as well as the incorporation of the S-BDT unit with electron acceptor comonomers to produce lower bandgap D–A copolymers are in progress.
