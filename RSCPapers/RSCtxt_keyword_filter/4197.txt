    , Accepted 18th December 2018First published on 19th December 2018AbstractRecent advances in flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their great potential for bendable and wearable electronic devices. In particular, developing high-quality low-temperature processed electron transport layers (ETLs) plays a pivotal role in realizing highly efficient flexible PSCs. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to fabricate graphene quantum dot/SnO2 composites (G@SnO2) as effective ETLs. Systematic optimization and investigation reveal that SnO2 blended with graphene quantum dots with ca. 5 nm diameter (G5@SnO2) has higher electron mobility, better film coverage and better energy level alignment compared to pristine SnO2, leading to promoted charge transfer and suppressed charge recombination. PSCs based on G5@SnO2 demonstrate superior photovoltaic performance with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6% and average PCE of 19.0%. Amazingly, the G5@SnO2 based flexible PSCs obtain a best PCE and stabilized PCE of 17.7% and 17.2%, respectively, comparable to the highest PCEs recorded for flexible devices. Moreover, our flexible PSCs demonstrate outstanding mechanical durability, retaining over 91% of the initial PCE value after 500 bending cycles with a bending radius of 7 mm.
Introduction
Over the past decade, remarkable advances have been made for metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the photovoltaic field.1–3 Solution-processed organometal halide perovskite materials with superb optoelectronic properties, such as extremely long carrier diffusion length, small exciton dissociation energy and ultrahigh light absorption coefficient, have promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organolead halide perovskite cells from 3.8% to 23.3%.4–7
At present, two main device architectures dominate PSC research: n–i–p type and p–i–n type, depending on which of the charge collecting layers is deposited on the transparent electrode.8–10 Thus far, n–i–p structure based PSCs have exhibited superior PCE as has been reported.11–13 As a crucial component of the device structure, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays an essential role in interfacial charge extraction and transfer, thus determining the photovoltaic performance.14 Currently, TiO2 is still the most commonly used ETL in high performance n–i–p PSCs. However, it was reported that significant electron accumulation caused by the charge barrier at the TiO2/perovskite interface always exists, leading to increased hysteresis and reduced efficiency.15,16 Besides, TiO2 suffers from low electron mobility (ca. 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and usually requires sintering at a high temperature (ca. 400 °C) for obtaining high efficiency PSCs.17,18 However, the high-temperature process limits the development of flexible PSCs, as ductile polymeric substrates tend not to be amenable to thermal annealing. Thus, it is extremely important to develop low-temperature processed ETLs for high-efficiency flexible PSCs.19–21
Recently, SnO2 has been regarded as a promising choice to replace TiO2 as the ETL in PSCs, owing to its suitable energy band alignment, high visible light optical transmittance, outstanding electron mobility and excellent low-temperature processability.22–29 Tian et al. reported the use of thermally annealed spin-coated commercial SnO2 nanoparticles as the ETL for PSCs and a PCE of 13.0% was obtained.30 Meanwhile, Fang et al. employed a SnCl2·2H2O sol–gel thermolysis method to prepare SnO2 thin films and achieved a best efficiency of 17.2%.22 Following these studies, various methods including solution processing,31–33 chemical bath deposition,23,34 atomic layer deposition35 and electrochemical deposition36 have been employed to synthesize low-temperature SnO2 films for high performance PSCs. Recently, You's group employed commercial high-quality SnO2 nanoparticles as the ETL and achieved a 19.9% certified efficiency,24 which was improved to 20.9% by further optimizing the PbI2 passivation layer on rigid substrates.37 Later, Huang et al. synthesized low-temperature processed SnO2 nanocrystals as ETLs in flexible PSCs and demonstrated a 16.5% device efficiency.38 However, the charge carrier accumulation and recombination caused by the insufficient electron mobility still hinder the charge transport and limit the PCE of both rigid and flexible devices.39 To further improve device performance, it is imperative to expedite charge transfer and suppress charge recombination via conductivity and mobility enhancement of ETLs. So far, graphene with high mobility and electronic conductivity has been strategically incorporated into traditional ETLs in solar cells to improve the electron extraction and transfer, thus improving the photovoltaic performance.40–44 For instance, Wang et al. employed graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites to improve the device performance and achieved a PCE of 15.6% owing to the efficient charge collection.40 Tavakoli et al. synthesized composites of graphene with ZnO and TiO2 as the ETLs for PSCs, resulting in an enhanced current density and better device performance.41–43 As the aforementioned high performance perovskite solar cells exhibited a mesoporous architecture, it is essential to develop an effective ETL with enhanced electronic properties for planar PSCs. Yang et al. used TiO2 doped with graphene as the ETL for a planar PSC and obtained an improved PCE which originated from the facilitated electron transfer.44 However, the optimized devices suffered from low fill factor with interfacial charge recombination caused by the large roughness of the ETL composites. To get compact and thin ETLs for highly efficient planar PSCs, it is highly desirable to replace large-size graphene flakes with smaller graphene nanodots.
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), few layers of graphene sheets, have been used as functional layers in many photovoltaic devices such as organic photovoltaics,45 silicon solar cells46 and PSCs47–50 with merits of high conductivity, quantum size effect, outstanding stability and tunable band gap.51 Zhu et al. and Jang et al. successfully used GQDs to modify TiO2 layers and achieved improved device performance in PSCs, respectively benefitting from facilitated electron injection.47,48 Recently, Wang and Yang's groups have introduced GQDs into SnO2 ETLs by the thermal decomposition of a Sn-based salt precursor, which significantly enhanced the fill factor and efficiency of PSCs.49,50 However, the annealing temperature and environment are critical when using this thermal decomposition process.52,53 Moreover, there are many oxygen defects and pinholes in the SnO2 films, which increase charge recombination and further lead to reduced device efficiency.54,55 Therefore, a combination of GQDs and SnO2 nanoparticles could be regarded as an effective strategy for enhancing the electronic properties to fabricate low-temperature processed ETLs for high-performance flexible PSCs.
Herein, we report a facile way to prepare GQD and SnO2 nanoparticle composites (G@SnO2) as ETLs for highly efficient rigid and flexible PSCs. Enhanced electron conductivity and better energy level alignment were realized via the introduction of GQDs into SnO2, leading to faster charge extraction and transfer from the perovskite film. Compared to SnO2 based PSCs, better photovoltaic performance with remarkably enhanced Jsc and suppressed hysteresis can be realized in G@SnO2 PSCs. We further systematically investigated the effect of GQD size and concentration on the electronic properties of G@SnO2, as verified by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM), photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, as well as on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on the G@SnO2 ETLs.
Experimental section
Materials
Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide substrates (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Yingkou Youxuan Trade Co., Ltd. PEN/ITO substrates (PECP-IP, 14 Ω sq−1) were bought from Peccell Technologies, Inc. Tin(IV) oxide nanoparticles (15 wt% in H2O dispersion), PbI2 (99.9985%), CsI (99.999%), PbBr2 (99.999%), dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.98%) and chlorobenzene (99.9%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Citric acid (CA) (99.5%) and NaOH (97%) were bought from Aladdin. NH2CHNH2I (FAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were purchased from Greatcell Solar. Spiro-OMeTAD (99.7%) was bought from Borun Chemical Co., Ltd., and other reagents and solutions were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the materials were used as received without any purification.
Preparation of GQDs and G@SnO2 precursors
GQDs with different sizes were prepared by directly pyrolyzing CA in alkalescent solution at different hydrothermal temperatures.56,57 In a typical process of GQD synthesis, 0.48 M NaOH was first dissolved into 30 mL deionized water. After stirring for 10 min, CA was added to the alkaline solution in a certain molar ratio (CA:NaOH = 1:3). After sonication for 5 min, the aqueous solution was subsequently sealed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept in a hot oven at 120 and 170 °C for 10 h, respectively. The final product solution was first placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight and further dialyzed in a dialysis bag for 48 h to remove excess CA. The dispersion obtained in the dialysis bag was vacuum freeze-dried and then centrifuged with ethanol to get the GQD powder. Following this, the powder was redispersed in deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. Different volume ratios of GQD and SnO2 water dispersions were mixed together and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for at least 5 h to get the G@SnO2 precursors, in which SnO2 was blended with GQDs of different sizes (ca. 5 nm and ca. 10 nm) and different weight percentages of 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2% and 5%, respectively.
Device fabrication
The FTO and ITO/PEN substrates were etched and cleaned successively in cleaning fluid, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol. Before use, the substrates were dried with N2 and treated with O2 plasma for 10 min. The SnO2 and G@SnO2 precursor solutions were spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then heated at 135 °C for 45 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature on a hot plate. A mixed-cation lead-halide perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in an anhydrous DMSO/DMF mixture with a volume ratio of 1:4. Then a 1.5 M stock solution of CsI in DMSO, was added into the above perovskite precursor at a volume ratio of 5:95.4,58 The perovskite precursor solution was stirred overnight to obtain a clear yellow solution and filtered with a 0.22 μm PTFE-filter before use. The perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step spin coating process (2000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s) with a quick dropwise addition of 100 μL chlorobenzene onto the center of the substrate 10 s before the end of the second spinning process. The perovskite film was then heated at 100 °C for 45 min. A spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and a 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The as-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and kept in a dry box overnight to get oxidized. Finally, a 70 nm thick gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss LEO1530, Germany) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2, FEI Company, USA) were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the samples. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded on a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA) in the wavelength range from 300 to 850 nm at room temperature. Raman spectra were measured on a laser micro-Raman spectrometer (HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) with a laser beam wavelength of 633 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by employing a D8 Advance Diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu-Kα1 (1.5406 Å) radiation operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the source. The gas discharge lamp was used for UPS, with helium gas admitted and the HeI (21.22 eV) emission line employed. The helium pressure in the analysis chamber during analysis was about 3 × 10−8 mbar. The data were acquired with −10 V bias. Two-dimensional (2D) atomic force microscopy (AFM) images with current mapping were obtained by conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM, Cypher AFM, Asylum Research Oxford Instruments). The CAFM measurement was performed in contact test mode with a bias of 1 V applied to the FTO substrate. The probe acquires the current and morphology information simultaneously from an area of 5 μm × 5 μm. Steady-state and transient PL decay spectra were obtained with a FLS920 transient optical spectrometer (Livingston, WL, U.K.). Steady-state PL measurements were performed by exciting the sample with a monochromatic xenon lamp source with a central wavelength of 460 nm. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using a time-correlated single-photon counting system using a pulsed laser beam (EPL405) with a wavelength and frequency of 405 nm and 10–20 MHz. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were tested with a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G illumination. The devices were illuminated using a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell). The active area (0.06 cm2) of the devices was defined by a black metal aperture. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement was carried out using a QEX10 system (PV Measurements, USA) in DC mode. The intensity of incident monochromatic light was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (012-2013, Pharos Technology). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a Zahner system (Zahner, Zahner-Elektrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). The EIS results were recorded at a potential of 1.0 V with a modulation amplitude of 10 mV at frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz in the dark.
Results and discussion
As described above, GQDs were fabricated based on a facile one-step hydrothermal process and further purified by dialysis.56 Fig. S1† shows TEM images and diameter distribution of GQDs synthesized at different temperatures. GQDs prepared at 120 and 170 °C have average sizes of 10.9 nm and 5.4 nm, respectively, which we denote hereafter as G10 and G5. This indicates that the size of GQDs decreased with the increasing hydrothermal reaction temperature. Fig. 1 shows the PL emission spectra of GQDs excited at 300 nm, revealing that G5 and G10 exhibited different peaks at 393 nm and 471 nm. The PL emission peaks, mainly related to the band gap energy of different GQDs, demonstrated a red shift with the decreasing reaction temperature. This phenomenon suggested that size effects can influence the band gap energy of GQDs.59,60 Specifically, GQDs with smaller sizes have a wider band gap than those with larger sizes. The optical images of G5 and G10 solutions under a 365 nm UV lamp displayed blue and cyan emission (inset of Fig. 1). The GQDs exhibited good crystallinity with a lattice spacing of 0.216 nm (Fig. S2† inset), which is consistent with the in-plane lattice spacing in graphite/graphene.61 A typical G band at 1598 cm−1 and D band at 1340 cm−1 were observed in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S2†) with a ratio of 0.88 (ID/IG), indicating the highly crystalline and graphitic structure of GQDs.62 As shown in Fig. S3,† SnO2 nanoparticles are well-crystalized with an average size of ca. 6 nm, which is suitable for blending with GQDs. A distinct raised C 1s peak displayed in the XPS spectra (Fig. S4a†) implies the successful blending of GQDs with SnO2, which is further confirmed by direct observation using TEM characterization (Fig. S4b†). Besides, Sn 3d peaks from G@SnO2 shift to a higher binding energy by ca. 0.10 eV in contrast to pristine SnO2, indicating that GQDs are bonded with SnO2via dangling O atoms.

Fig. 2a and b show the device architecture schematic and the cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC based on the GQD/SnO2 (G@SnO2) ETL. As shown in Fig. 2c, the energy band diagram of the whole device illustrates that a Cs containing mixed perovskite with a ca. 1.61 eV band gap matches better with G@SnO2 owing to the upshifted conduction band and Fermi level,48,50 extracted from the results of the UPS measurement (Fig. S5†). The better energy band alignment is beneficial for the reduced energy barrier and faster electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface.63Fig. 2d displays the top-view SEM image of the perovskite film with an obvious excess of PbI2, as further confirmed by XRD characterization (Fig. S6†). Previous work has reported that excess PbI2 located at grain boundaries is propitious to passivate defects.64,65 G@SnO2 demonstrated a lower PbI2 peak intensity compared to pure SnO2 due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GQDs, which might interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions and slightly suppress the excess PbI2.66

As shown in Fig. 3a, G5@SnO2 films exhibited no change in the transmittance within the wavelength range of 300–850 nm compared with pure SnO2 films. However, G10@SnO2 films showed lower transmittance than G5@SnO2 films, which was mainly caused by the wider absorption range of G10 and the reduced uniformity of G10@SnO2 films. Fig. 3b shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films based on different substrates. Cs containing mixed (CsFAMA) perovskite films show similar absorption in spite of the different ETLs. The emission peak at 775 nm related to the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the CsFAMA perovskite was clearly quenched when in contact with SnO2. The PL intensity was further reduced with G5@SnO2 as compared with G10@SnO2, indicating that G5@SnO2 extracts electrons from the perovskite layer better. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on SnO2, G5@SnO2 and G10@SnO2 ETLs are shown in Fig. 3c. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters for rigid PSCs. Compared to SnO2 ETL based devices, PSCs with G10@SnO2 demonstrated increased short circuit current density (Jsc) from 21.6 to 23.2 mA cm−2 and PCE from 16.8 to 18.1% in the reverse scan with small but non-negligible hysteresis, reflected by an H index from 0.101 to 0.094. Remarkably, G5@SnO2 exhibited an enhanced PCE of 19.2% with highest Jsc of 23.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.07 V and FF of 0.75 with a reduced H index of 0.047. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of devices based on different ETLs shown in Fig. 3d reveal that the tendency of integrated Jsc agrees well with that of the J–V curves. Fig. S7† displays the photovoltaic parameters of rigid PSCs based on different ETLs collected from 14 devices for each GQD size. The great performance enhancement, especially the improved Jsc of PSCs based on G@SnO2 compared with those based on SnO2, is ascribed to the improved electrical conductivity and promoted electron extraction and transport.67,68 To confirm this, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the FTO/ETL/Au structure (Fig. S8†) were measured and the related conductivities were calculated with the equation σ = (I × d)/(V × A)(1)where A is the active area (0.2 cm2) and d is the thickness of the ETLs (ca. 30 nm).69 The thickness was estimated from the cross-sectional SEM images of the different ETLs in Fig. S9.† As listed in Table S1,† the conductivity of G5@SnO2 and G10@SnO2 films is about 3–4 times higher than that of the SnO2 film. We further calculated the film mobility via space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement of different ETLs. Fig. S5† shows the lgJ–lgV plots. It can be observed that G@SnO2 ETLs exhibited higher electron mobilities of 7.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (G5@SnO2) and 9.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (G10@SnO2) than SnO2 at 2.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 by fitting lgJ–lgV curves using the equation (2)where J is the current density, μ is the zero-field mobility of electrons, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of SnO2 (≈13), d is the thickness of the ETLs (30 nm), and V is the applied effective voltage. The higher conductivity and mobility of G@SnO2 derived from the addition of GQDs contribute to the improved electron transport.70

To further understand the charge transport, recombination and photovoltaic performance of devices based on SnO2 ETLs with different GQD sizes, CAFM imaging of the different ETLs was carried out. Two-dimensional mapping reflects both the coverage and the conductivity distribution of ETLs. In Fig. 4a–d, the blue and red areas correspond to the parts with high and low conductivity, respectively. The average currents of the ETLs detected by CAFM are shown in the figure. It is evident that bare FTO exhibited the largest current of 10.42 nA. The value decreased to 2.95 nA due to the coverage by the SnO2 film, but partially recovered to 3.97 nA for G5@SnO2 and 4.47 nA for G10@SnO2 due to the enhanced conductivity. Compared to that of G5@SnO2, the increased current of G10@SnO2 results from the relatively larger size and inhomogeneous surface with pinholes, which can be seen in the SEM image (Fig. S9d†). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decays were measured to ascertain charge transfer at the ETL/CsFAMA perovskite interface. Fig. 4e shows the TRPL spectra of each ETL, and the corresponding PL lifetimes were calculated with a bi-exponential decay function including a fast decay and a slow decay process: y = y0 + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(3)

The faster time constant τ1 corresponds to the diffusion of photogenerated excitons into defects, while the slower time constant τ2 is associated with the exciton lifetime of the CsFAMA perovskite.69,71,72 The fitted lifetimes are summarized in Table S2.† G5@SnO2 showed a shorter lifetime as compared to G10@SnO2, which is attributed to the better coverage and flatter morphology of G5@SnO2 without pinholes than that of G10@SnO2 (Fig. S9†). Thus, G5@SnO2 exhibited a greater capacity to block holes and form high-quality perovskite, resulting in faster electron extraction and transfer.39,73 Of all the ETLs we studied, G5@SnO2 exhibited the smallest τ2 value, which reflects the most efficient electron extraction and transport, contributing significantly to the highest Jsc.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to obtain detailed information on interfacial resistance in PSCs. Fig. 4f displays Nyquist plots of devices employing different ETLs measured at a bias of −1.0 V in the dark, with the equivalent circuit model shown in Fig. S10.† Series resistance (Rs) and contact resistance (Rco) are ascribed to the high-frequency element, and recombination resistance (Rrec) corresponds to the low-frequency one in EIS, respectively.74 Table S3† summarizes the fitting results using the equivalent circuit. It can be noted that the semicircle at high frequency representing the charge transfer at ETL/HTL layers was too small to be observed in Nyquist plots measured in the dark.75 Thus, only one typical semicircle at low frequency (<103 Hz) attributed to the interfacial recombination resistance can be distinguished from the Nyquist plot. Rrec was 229.0 Ω for SnO2, 357.2 Ω for G5@SnO2, and 270.1 Ω for G10@SnO2 based devices, respectively. The highest Rrec value of the device employing the G5@SnO2 ETL suggests that charge recombination was effectively suppressed owing to the better energy band alignment and reduced energy barrier, leading to an increase in Voc and a small hysteresis.
Furthermore, PSCs based on G5@SnO2 with different GQD concentrations were fabricated to confirm the effect of G5 on device performance. The J–V curves for devices with different concentrations are presented in Fig. 5a and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. With the increasing concentration of G5 in the ETL, Jsc, FF, Voc, and PCE are enhanced up to a certain level, following which the device performance drops. This trend can be clearly observed from the photovoltaic performance distribution of rigid PSCs based on ETLs with different concentrations of G5 shown in Fig. S11.† The performance variation trend results from the competitive balance of charge transport and recombination, which is well supported by other previous work.50,68 The increased current from CAFM under a bias of 1 V (Fig. S12†) indicates the high conductivity and improved charge transfer of G5@SnO2 with increased G5 concentration. The charge recombination information was obtained from the Nyquist plot in Fig. 5b and the fitted Rrec is listed in Table 2. As the G5 concentration increases, Rrec initially increases and then decreases. With 0.5 wt% GQD concentration, G0.5@SnO2 shows a high current (3.86 nA) and the largest Rrec (446.1 Ω), indicating good charge transfer and effectively suppressed recombination. As a result, the 0.5 wt% G5@SnO2 based device (Fig. 5c) yielded a champion PCE of 19.6% with a Jsc of 23.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.08 V and FF of 0.77. The corresponding J–V curves and IPCE spectrum are displayed in Fig. 5c and d. Also, the average PCE value for 0.5 wt% G5@SnO2 based devices (19.0%) is remarkably higher than that of SnO2 based devices (15.5%) owing to the significant enhancement of Jsc and slight rise of Voc and FF. Moreover, the champion device showed good long-term stability without any encapsulation in ambient environment (Fig. S13†).

The low-temperature processed G5@SnO2 is quite suitable as the ETL for highly efficient flexible perovskite solar cells. Cross-sectional SEM images of flexible PSCs based on the G5@SnO2 ETL in Fig. S14† not only show that compact ETLs were entirely deposited onto flexible substrates (ITO/PEN) with great uniformity but also that CsFAMA perovskite films were well constructed and crystallized similarly to those obtained on rigid substrates. Fig. 6a displays the J–V curve of our champion flexible PSC with the inset showing a bending image of the real device. The device has a Jsc of 22.1 (22.2) mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.07 (1.04) V and a FF of 0.75 (0.74), and yields a PCE of 17.7 (17.1)% for the reverse (forward) scan, which agree well with those based on a rigid substrate. The lower transparency and higher sheet resistance of the flexible substrate (ITO/PEN) lead to the lower Jsc compared to that of the rigid substrate (Glass/FTO). IPCE measurement was further conducted and the integrated Jsc is 20.2 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 6b, which is close to the value achieved from J–V measurement. In addition, maximum power point (MPP) tracking was performed at a bias of 0.89 V to evaluate the stabilized power output and device characteristics (Fig. 6c). The champion flexible device presented a stabilized PCE of 17.2% with a photocurrent density of 19.4 mA cm−2. We further fabricated 20 devices based on G5@SnO2 to confirm their repetition rate. Fig. 6d shows the PCE distribution histogram obtained for these devices. Surprisingly, the flexible PSCs based on G5@SnO2 demonstrate a narrow distribution variance (17.2 ± 0.19%), indicating outstanding reproducibility.

To further evaluate the device mechanical durability and practicality for flexible PSCs, a bending test was carried out. According to previous reports, the resistance of the ITO/PEN plastic substrate was found to rise gradually when the bending radius was smaller than 6 mm.76 Moreover, the ITO layer tends to break off at a radius less than 4 mm, leading to severe degradation of conductivity and device performance.77 Thus, flexible devices were subjected to a manual durability test at a bending radius of 7 mm, for up to 500 bending cycles in the present study. As shown in Fig. 6e, the PCE of the devices dropped gradually to 91% of the original value (17.6%) after 500 bending cycles. The solid combination between GQD and SnO2 as well as enhanced mechanical strength of the GQD/SnO2 composites are thought to contribute to the good mechanical stability of flexible devices.78 In addition, the main loss of PCE can be attributed to the drop in FF concluded from the changing tendency of photovoltaic parameters in Fig. 6e with 500 bending cycles. Fig. S15† shows the J–V curves of the device after different bending cycles, in which an obvious loss of FF can also be observed. Recently, some flexible PSCs with high efficiency and durability fabricated by using durable substrates such as graphene and carbon nanotubes have been reported, owing to their excellent conductivity even under mechanical stress.79–81 We believe that the durability and stability performance of flexible PSCs will be further improved with more durable substrates.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully synthesized GQDs with different sizes and mixed them with SnO2 as effective ETLs in PSCs. Through optimizing the GQD size and concentration, high film conductivity, good film coverage uniformity, and raised Fermi energy level matching with that of perovskite were achieved, which is remarkably beneficial to facilitate electron transfer and suppress interfacial charge recombination, resulting in a significant enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. Based on the G5@SnO2 ETL, PSCs exhibit a champion PCE of 19.6% for the rigid substrate and 17.7% for the flexible substrate. Moreover, these flexible devices demonstrate outstanding durability, retaining 91% of their original PCE after 500 bending cycles. This work provides a facile route to develop effective ETLs for high-performance flexible PSCs and paves the way for further advances in flexible photovoltaic devices and optoelectronic applications.
