    , Accepted 22nd March 2017First published on 22nd March 2017AbstractExtensive knowledge of the dependence of solar cell and module performance on temperature and irradiance is essential for their optimal application in the field. Here we study such dependencies in the most common high-efficiency silicon solar cell architectures, including so-called Aluminum back-surface-field (BSF), passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT), and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. We compare measured temperature coefficients (TC) of the different electrical parameters with values collected from commercial module data sheets. While similar TC values of the open-circuit voltage and the short circuit current density are obtained for cells and modules of a given technology, we systematically find that the TC under maximum power-point (MPP) conditions is lower in the modules. We attribute this discrepancy to additional series resistance in the modules from solar cell interconnections. This detrimental effect can be reduced by using a cell design that exhibits a high characteristic load resistance (defined by its voltage-over-current ratio at MPP), such as the SHJ architecture. We calculate the energy yield for moderate and hot climate conditions for each cell architecture, taking into account ohmic cell-to-module losses caused by cell interconnections. Our calculations allow us to conclude that maximizing energy production in hot and sunny environments requires not only a high open-circuit voltage, but also a minimal series-to-load-resistance ratio.

Broader context
In many developing countries, electricity is currently provided mostly by fossil fuel combustion. With ongoing industrial development and population growth in these countries, the demand for electricity will increase dramatically in the future. This electricity should be supplied by a cost-effective technology that is, in view of the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, based on renewable energy resources. Silicon solar cells are perfectly suited to supply electricity under these conditions because the technology is mature and the base material is abundant. Furthermore, prices for solar cells have markedly decreased in recent years. Studies now indicate that solar will be the cheapest source of electricity in terms of capital expenditure, by 2030. Understanding how different photovoltaic technologies are influenced by temperature is mandatory in selecting the best technology. We compare the temperature and irradiance dependencies of the current standard cell technology (silicon-based aluminum back surface field, BSF) with those of an emerging technology (passivated emitter rear cell, PERC) and other advanced technologies such as silicon heterojunction solar cells. In addition, we discuss electrical cell-to-module losses and their impact on the energy production of each technology.

1 Introduction
To abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, future energy production will have to be fully supplied by renewable energy resources.1 Combined with storage solutions,2,3 a highly suitable candidate to produce 100% CO2-neutral energy is silicon photovoltaics (PV).4,5 Silicon PV is currently the dominant and most mature technology,7 and its base material is abundant, non-toxic and stable,8–10 making it also promising for terawatt deployment scenarios, provided a sufficiently low energy payback time can be guaranteed.6 Furthermore, prices for silicon PV have dramatically decreased in recent years and current studies indicate that by 2030, PV will be the cheapest source of electricity in terms of capital expenditure in many regions of the world.11–13 PV is already considered to be the most economical source of electricity in many regions in sub-Saharan Africa.14 Recently, the lowest ever bids for solar parks were submitted at levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) between 0.0507 USD per kWh and 0.0242 USD per kWh.15–17 The targeted capacities of these solar parks are in the range of hundreds of MW peak power, with optional future increases up to 5 GW.18 They are located in hot and sunny climates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Mexico). Given the future demand for electricity in developing countries, we need clear understanding of the temperature-dependent performance of different photovoltaic technologies to accurately predict local LCOEs, especially when considering that accurate LCOE prediction in general is a very challenging task.19
It is an established fact that the output power of silicon-based photovoltaic devices usually decreases with increasing temperature. These effects have been studied extensively in the past,20–22 most commonly observed is the reduced open-circuit voltage (VOC) at higher temperatures, which is driven by increased intrinsic carrier density and thus increased recombination current in the absorber material. Because it is directly linked to the operating voltage,23,24 the fill factor (FF) usually also decreases with increased temperature. The short-circuit current density (JSC) increases on the contrary because of temperature-triggered reduction of the absorber bandgap.22 Other secondary phenomena may also affect the relationship between temperature and device performance, such as the presence of carrier transport barriers inside the electrical contacts25–28 and temperature-dependent minority charge carrier recombination in the bulk and at the surfaces of the absorber.29–31
In this paper, we analyze state-of-the-art solar cell architectures based on p-type and n-type crystalline silicon, including the current industrial standard solar cell technology (i.e. aluminum back surface field, BSF) as well as other more advanced technologies, including passivated emitter and rear contact32 (PERC), passivated emitter rear totally diffused33 (PERT), and silicon heterojunction34 (SHJ) solar cells, which are expected to have increased industrial importance in the near future.35 In addition to temperature- and irradiance-dependent current–voltage J(V) measurements, we also examine the influence that operating temperature has on the surface passivation schemes used in the different cell architectures by measuring temperature-dependent transient photoconductance decay.30,36 Furthermore, we examine the impact of ohmic cell-to-module losses that occur due to the series resistance associated with cell interconnections, and how these losses impact TC and energy generation of each architecture in hot and moderate climates.

The p-BSF cell features a diffused n+ electron contact at the front, which is passivated by a silicon nitride (SiNx) anti-reflection coating (ARC), a screen-printed (SP) front contact silver grid and a full-area SP aluminum BSF as the hole contact.
The p-PERC cell also has a diffused n+ electron contact at the front, which is passivated by an SiO2/SiNx ARC stack. The front contact grid is electroplated and consists of a stack of nickel, copper and silver. On the rear side, the Al2O3/SiOx/SiNx passivation and rear reflector stack is locally opened with a laser and subsequently covered with sputtered AlSi1% (aluminum with 1% silicon), and finally annealed to form a localized hole contact in the ablated areas.38
All other devices are based on n-type c-Si. The standard and “advanced” passivated emitter, rear totally-diffused cells,39–41n-PERT and adv. n-PERT, respectively, feature a full-area p+ hole contact on the rear side, locally contacted through laser-ablated vias in an Al2O3/SiOx passivation and rear reflector layer stack by sputtered AlSi1%. Both variants feature a full-area diffused n+ front-surface field (FSF) and a plated Ni/Cu/Ag front contact grid, as well as an SiO2/SiNx AR and passivation stack. What differentiates the adv. n-PERT cell from the standard one is an additional local n++ region below the front contact grid that is obtained by laser doping to reduce contact recombination.
The n-hybrid cell42 has the same front side as the n-PERT cell, but the rear contact is a so-called passivating contact, realized by silicon heterojunction technology. The contact consists of an intrinsic and a p-type amorphous silicon layer (a-Si:H(i) and a-Si:H(p), respectively), giving it hole-collecting properties, capped by a stack of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and Cu/Al metallization.
The full SHJ solar cell34,43 (n-SHJ) features passivating contacts of both carrier types, formed by a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(p) and a-Si:H(i)/a-Si:H(n) stacks on the front and rear side, respectively. The a-Si:H layers on both sides are covered with TCO and a SP silver grid. The p-BSF and the n-SHJ cells were provided by external suppliers.
Furthermore, symmetrical test samples, featuring the same passivating schemes as used in the cells were prepared to test the temperature dependency of the passivation of each surface. In the solar cells featuring direct metal contacts, the symmetrical samples thus only represent the passivated areas.
We note that the performance of the analysed cells (Table 1) is representative of both the performance currently achieved in commercially available modules with the same cell architecture, and cells fabricated with our manufacturing process. The device-to-device variability for the silicon solar cells listed in Table 1 is below 0.3%abs.38,44,45
2.2 Characterisation/methodology

2.2.1 Temperature- and irradiance-dependent J(V). 
The cells were measured with a J(V) probing station (AM 1.5G, class A+A+A+ sun simulator with a temperature-controllable chuck). The temperature was varied between 15 °C and 75 °C, and the irradiation intensity was varied between 0.036 to 2 Sun by the application of different neutral density filters or lenses. We obtained a matrix of the irradiance- and temperature-dependent power output of each solar cell.
To accurately determine TCs of the J(V) parameters, the correct identification of the (relative) temperature is mandatory. We therefore took several measures to ensure that the cell temperature during the measurement was the same under VOC, JSC, and maximum-power-point (MPP) conditions, and that the surface temperature of the chuck was accurately known (see ESI†). To obtain the relative TCs, we linearly fitted the data between 25 °C and 75 °C and normalised to the value at 25 °C, as follows: (1)where P25°CMPP, V25°COC, J25°CSC and FF25°C are the values of the respective quantities at 25 °C. If not stated otherwise, all TCs given in the paper are relative TCs (normalized to the respective value at 25 °C).


2.2.2 Temperature-dependent charge carrier lifetime. 
To determine the temperature-dependent minority charge carrier lifetime, we used a Sinton Instruments WCT-120TS,46 and followed the generalized analysis method.47 The injection-dependent lifetime of the symmetrical samples capturing either the front or the rear side of the devices was measured at different temperatures between 30 °C and 120 °C. To avoid any effect induced by annealing during the measurement itself, the symmetrical samples were annealed prior to the measurements for 20 min at 190 °C. Furthermore, a reference lifetime measurement was performed before and after the temperature-dependent measurements to ensure that the characteristics of the samples did not change during the measurement. For the actual measurement, the chuck of the WCT-120TS was heated to 125 °C and a sample was placed on the chuck. Then, the measurements were performed while the chuck and sample were passively cooling down.


2.2.3 Calculation of annual energy production. 
To calculate annual energy production at two locations (Geneva and Abu Dhabi), we used weather data provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).48 The data describe a typical meteorological year and include irradiance data, as well as air temperature and wind speed at the given location in hourly timesteps. First, the effective in-plane irradiance and the module temperature were calculated based on the weather data and the PV-lib toolbox.49§ The module plane was tilted south by 40° for Geneva, and by 30° for Abu Dhabi, as these angles lead to the highest annual energy production at the respective locations, corresponding to their latitudes.
In addition to the temperature- and irradiance-dependent power output for each solar cell, obtained as described in Section 2.2.1, the produced energy per time step was then calculated. When ohmic cell-to-module losses were included, the power was calculated using eqn (7). More details are given in the ESI.†

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Temperature-dependent charge carrier lifetime
In Fig. 2, the injection-dependent carrier lifetimes for symmetrical samples representative of the passivation in p-PERC, n-PERT and n-SHJ solar cells are shown for temperatures between 30 °C and 120 °C. An increase in the minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature is observed in all passivation schemes investigated here.
 Fig. 2  Injection-dependent effective minority carrier lifetime, τmin, of symmetrically passivated samples as obtained from temperature-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements on a Sinton WCT-120TS setup. The lifetime curves indicate the passivation schemes in the investigated cells. (a) On p-type c-Si, homojunction passivation, (b) on n-type c-Si (homojunction), (c) on n-type c-Si (a-Si:H(i/p) and a-Si:H(i/n) passivation). 
As the temperature dependency of both Auger and radiative recombination in a silicon wafer is negligible in the investigated temperature range,50–52 changes in the minority carrier lifetime most likely arise from the temperature dependency of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination statistics in the bulk or at the surfaces. An increase in lifetimes of passivated29 and unpassivated30 silicon bulk material has been reported in the literature. Schmidt attributed the lifetime increase to the temperature dependent decrease of the hole capture cross section of Al-related defects in the silicon bulk material.29
The temperature-dependent lifetime of silicon heterojunction passivating contacts was studied by Seif et al.31 They reported an increase in the carrier lifetime with a-Si:H(i/p) and a-Si:H(i/n) passivating layers, but a decrease in carrier lifetime with a-Si:H(i) passivation. The origin of the increasing charge carrier lifetime in silicon is not fully understood yet. However, the findings underscore that the temperature dependency of the minority carrier lifetime can influence the TC of the VOC and therefore has to be considered for accurate modelling, as further discussed in Section 3.3.
3.2 Temperature coefficients of J(V) parameters
In Fig. 3, the temperature-dependent J(V) parameters of all investigated device architectures are shown at standard 1000 W m−2, with AM 1.5G irradiation. It can be seen that in general the parameters of the cells linearly follow the temperature. However, for FF and, as a consequence, also for the efficiency, η, this is not the case in the two cell architectures incorporating a silicon heterojunction passivating contact. The effect is more pronounced for the n-SHJ cell compared with the n-hybrid cell. The non-linearity of FF and η versus temperature was previously observed in such contacts25,28,53 and is commonly observed in solar cells incorporating thermionic barriers. Generally, increasingly linear behaviour can be achieved by increasing the conductivity of the contact layer28 and the use of thinner intrinsic buffer layers,25 for which the challenge is to maintain sufficient surface passivation.
 Fig. 3  Temperature-dependent J(V) parameters of the investigated solar cell architectures. The measurements were taken under AM 1.5G irradiance at 1000 W m−2. The parameters depend linearly on the temperature except for the FF of the solar cells incorporating silicon heterojunctions. As a consequence also the temperature dependency of the efficiency η is non-linear for these devices. The data were linearly least-square fitted to derive the TCs, as indicated by the solid lines. Dashed lines indicate linear extrapolation. 
Due to the non-linearity of the cells investigated here, the linear fitting to obtain the TCs was limited to the range between 50 °C and 75 °C in the n-hybrid and n-SHJ cells. In Table 2, the relative TCs of the investigated cells are summarized. The values obtained from the limited fitting range are marked with an asterisk. Relative TCs were normalized to the value at 25 °C. We maintained this normalization for the two non-linear cases. However, to preserve comparability with the TCs of the other architectures, P25°CMPP and FF25°C (cf.eqn (1)) were not taken from Table 1, but instead calculated by linear extrapolation using the fitted TC.¶ The TCJSC is similar for all investigated cells and positive. The JSC increases with temperature due to the reduced band-gap of silicon at higher temperatures22 and the accompanied enhanced absorption of infrared photons.54
Table 2 Relative TCs at AM 1.5G irradiance of 1000 W m−2 of the devices shown in Fig. 1, derived from linear fitting between 25 °C and 75 °C of the temperature-dependant J(V) parameters shown in Fig. 3. For the TCs marked with an asterisk, the fitting was limited to the range between 50 °C and 75 °C, as the data are only linear in this range. To obtain the relative TCs in these cases, P25°CMPP, FF25°C and R25°CMPP were obtained by linear extrapolation. Fitting between 25 °C and 75 °C would lead to a TCFF of −0.05% K−1 and thus TCPMPP of −0.26% K−1 for the n-SHJ solar cell. Additionally, the temperature coefficient of the characteristic load resistance, TCRMPP, is included

The cell architecture with the highest (best) TCPMPP is the n-SHJ architecture. This is due to higher TCVOC and TCFF. Included in Table 2 is also the TC of the characteristic load resistance at MPP (TCRMPP). For TCRMPP the value of the n-SHJ cell is the most favourable. Maintaining a higher characteristic resistance at MPP with increasing temperature helps to avoid the detrimental influence of series resistance caused by the interconnection of the cells in a module. This is discussed in Section 3.4.
3.3 Comparison of Vocversus temperature with models from the literature
In Fig. 4, the relationships between the open-circuit voltage and temperature in four of the cell architectures, p-BSF, p-PERC, advanced n-PERT and n-SHJ are compared; the others are not shown for clarity. We also show the same relationships as determinded by two models in the literature. The first model was proposed by Green et al.20,55 and describes the absolute TCVOC as a function VOC of the at 25 °C: (2)with the absolute temperature, T = 298.15 K, the bandgap of silicon at 0 K divided by the elementary charge ESig0/q = 1.206 V, the Boltzmann constant, k = 8.617 V K−1, and a factor depending on the mechanism determining the open-circuit voltage55γ = 3.
 Fig. 4  
V
OC values of four of the investigated solar cells versus temperature compared with two different modelled characteristics: a formula for the TCVOC as proposed by Green et al.20,55 and VOC(T) calculated from the temperature dependency of J0 due to SRH recombination at low injection.57 
In the second model, the temperature dependency of the recombination parameter, J0, of the classical one-diode model is used to calculate VOC(T) with eqn (3) and (4), taking JSC(T) from the measured data (see Fig. 3). (3)
When assuming a constant minority carrier lifetime, τmin, the temperature dependence of J0 stems only from the temperature dependence of the intrinsic carrier concentration, ni, described by the model of Misiakos and Tsamakis,56 which was used for the calculations presented here. With this, J0(T) is described as57 (4)with the elementary charge, q, the wafer thickness, W, the doping concentration of the majority charge carrier in the wafer, Ndop, and the minority charge carrier lifetime, τmin. W was taken from Table 1, Ndop was calculated from the wafer's resistivity and τmin was chosen such that the VOC derived from the model matches the measured value (see Table 1) at 25 °C.
As can be seen from Fig. 4, both models deviate from the measured trends of VOC(T) for most of the cells, seen by an underestimation of the VOC at higher temperatures. The deviation is more pronounced in the cells with lower VOC at 25 °C and almost vanishes in the n-SHJ cell, which features the highest VOC, approaching the theoretical limit. It should be noted that eqn (4) is only valid for so-called low injection conditions57 (the minority carrier density is much lower than doping density). Strictly speaking, this is only true for the p-BSF and p-PERC cells, but not for the n-PERT and the n-SHJ cell. However, especially for the cells were the model should be valid, it deviates from the measured data. This can be explained by the increased minority carrier lifetime (τmin) at higher temperatures, as reported in Section 3.1. As τmin increases with increasing temperature, the decrease of the VOC with increasing temperature is lowered, leading thus to a higher TCVOC than predicted by the models. This is not the case for the n-SHJ solar cell, because VOC is already close to the Auger limit and the temperature dependence of Auger recombination is negligible in the investigated temperature range.50
3.4 From cell to module
When going from solar cells to solar modules, additional optical losses occur due to enhanced parasitic absorption and reflection caused by encapsulant and glass, and additional electrical losses occur due to cell interconnections (Fig. 5). While the additional optical losses have no or only a minor impact, the additional electrical losses change the temperature dependency of the device, which we discuss here.
 Fig. 5  Schematic circuit of the solar cell and the additional resistance caused by the cell interconnection/wiring RCTM. The detrimental influence of RCTM is less when RMPP is large. 
In Table 3, the specifications of commercial solar cell modules are given, taken from data sheets for p-BSF, p-PERC, adv. n-PERT and n-SHJ modules. While the relative TC of the VOC and the JSC are comparable with our data obtained from the individual cells, the TCFF of the modules is generally lower. We find that this lower TCFF comes from the additional series resistance, caused by cell interconnections, as a silicon solar cell with a lower FF due to a higher series resistance will have a worse TCFF,21 which we elucidate in the following.

The power density generated by a solar cell that is delivered to the external circuit is PMPP = VMPP·JMPP = JMPP2·RMPP,(5)with the characteristic load resistance at MPP RMPP = VMPP/JMPP. The power lost from an additional series resistance, RCTM, can then be approximated by PCTMloss ≈ JMPP2·RCTM.(6)This approximation is valid as long as JMPP does not change with additional RCTM, which is true for the cases considered here.|| In all silicon solar cell devices, RMPP reduces when the temperature increases, as VMPP drops, but JMPP generally stays constant.** On the other hand, RCTM will increase with increased temperature.††PCTMloss also increases, while PMPP decreases with increased temperature due to the reduction of VMPP. Therefore, the fraction of power lost at RCTM under MPP conditions increases with increased temperature. Since the temperature dependencies of both VOC and JSC are not affected by RCTM, TCFF is reduced.
The power at MPP including the reduction due to an additional RCTM can be calculated using (7)
From this, it is evident that a device with a large RMPP (larger VMPP and lower or equal JMPP) will generally be less sensitive to additional series resistance. To achieve higher performance at higher temperatures, it is thus important to maintain RMPP as high as possible. Comparing the RMPP of the different architectures (Table 1) with its temperature coefficient (TCRMPP, Table 2), suggests that n-SHJ is best suited for applications in hot climates, as both the RMPP as well as its TCRMPP are the highest values among the examined architectures.
In Fig. 6, the relative power output versus temperature of the p-BSF cell is shown, as well as the relative power trend of a corresponding module (SolarWorld SW 320 XL, ). Furthermore, relative power trends that were calculated from the cell data using eqn (7) and an additional temperature-dependent RCTM(T) of 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1.0 Ω cm2 at 25 °C (R25°CCTM) are shown. The temperature-coefficient of RCTM (TCRCTM) was estimated from the literature58 to amount to −0.4% K−1. It can be seen that the TCPMPP deteriorates with the additional series resistance. As TCVOC and TCJSC are both not affected by a series resistance, this change is due to a decrease in TCFF. In the case here, the trend calculated from the cell data assuming an R25°CCTM of 0.8 Ω cm2 (data not shown in the figure) would fit well with the trend of the module . This can only be taken as an approximate value. For accurate determination of RCTM, data on the cells in the module are necessary. For example, the cells in the Panasonic module probably feature a higher FF than the n-SHJ cell considered in our study, as the difference in FF between our cell and the module data is only 0.2%abs (cf.Tables 1 and 3). Furthermore, another source of error in module data sheets is obvious: often, several J(V) parameter data sets are given for different power classes but only one data set is provided for the TCs. To which J(V) parameter data set it belongs is usually not stated. As the VOC per cell changes up to 10 mV between the different sets, this would obviously lead to different TCVOC.
 Fig. 6  Relative power (normalized to PMPP at 25 °C) versus temperature for the p-BSF cell at 1000 W m−2 with AM 1.5G irradiation. The dash-dotted lines are calculated from the cell data using eqn (7) for each temperature step and assuming an additional temperature-dependent (TCRCTM = −0.4% K−1) series resistance, RCTM, of 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1 Ω cm2 at 25 °C. The values in brackets correspond to TCPMPP and were obtained by linear fitting. The relative power of the module is calculated with the TCPMPP of the SolarWorld SW 320 XL module taken from Table 3. 
Summing up, additional series resistance due to cell interconnections in a module leads to a lower TCFF for the module than for single cells. Based on literature data,59,60 we assume R25°CCTM is generally below 1.0 Ω cm2.
Under the aforementioned assumption that the change of JMPP with increased temperature is negligible, and if TCPMPP of a cell and its RMPP at 25 °C conditions are known, the TC of a corresponding module including a temperature-dependent RCTM can be calculated as (8)Eqn (8) is derived in the ESI† and highlights two main conclusions:
(i) a solar cell architecture featuring a high RMPP will be less susceptible to power losses due to RCTM. One such architecture is the SHJ architecture or, more generally, passivating contact architectures due to their high VOCs,
(ii) ohmic losses (due to cell interconnections, RCTM) should be as low as possible, especially in hot and sunny environments.  decreases with increasing RCTM.
These findings are generally valid for silicon solar cells and not limited to a specific absorber material. The strategy to reduce ohmic losses on the module level using a high RMPP (high voltage, low current) is also reflected in the approach of using half-cells for module fabrication.61 However, this is only beneficial if the metallization of the cells is designed as if they were full-cells. General strategies to reduce the series resistance on modules but also on the cell level are reflected in multi-busbar and multi-wire interconnection technologies.62–64
3.5 Annual energy production
When comparing different photovoltaic systems with respect to their energy production performance, the energy per rated power under STC (yield)‡‡ in kWh/kW is usually used. In the case presented here, no solar systems are compared but single solar cells. Therefore, the most accurate performance measure would be the array yield, YA, as defined in IEC 6172465 as (9)with the produced energy per year and area (Eyr) and the rated power per area at STC (PSTCMPP). However, using YA to compare different technologies can be misleading in this case here, as added RCTM will lead to higher YA67 (cf. ESI†). That is because PSTCMPP is more strongly reduced by an additional RCTM than Eyr as part of the energy is also produced at irradiance levels lower than STC, where RCTM (or rather RS in general) is less detrimental. Therefore, we divide the produced energy by the rated power at the cell level, i.e. STC and RCTM = 0 Ω cm2 (PSTC,cellMPP) for each architecture and define the energy per rated power at the cell level as (10)In Fig. 7, the trends of EPRPcell are shown for the different solar cell architectures and additional series resistance values, R25°CCTM, between 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1.5 Ω cm2. The annually produced energy, Eyr, was calculated as described in Section 2.2.3 for temperate (Geneva) and hot and sunny (Abu Dhabi) climate conditions. The resulting value of EPRPcell is thus the amount of energy in kWh that will be produced by one nominal kW of solar cells and assuming different RCTM. Due to the non-linearity of the n-SHJ cell, its PMPP at STC is reduced compared to what would be expected from its TC derived between 50 °C and 75 °C (cf. Section 3.2). For a fair comparison, we therefore used the extrapolated value of PSTC,cellMPP as the divisor (the uncorrected data is about 1%abs higher). It can be seen that in the temperate climate, all solar cell architectures feature a very similar EPRPcell. However, the n-SHJ architecture suffers slightly less from the additional series resistance. In the hot climate, the differences between the technologies become more pronounced. Here, the n-SHJ technology benefits from its better TCPMPP. One kW of cells produces 2% more energy in comparison with the p-BSF architecture. The benefit increases further with the assumption of ohmic cell-to-module losses up to 3% at R25°CCTM of 1.5 Ω cm2. Note, however, that a realistic value for R25°CCTM would be below 1 Ω cm2, as discussed in Section 3.4. Limiting R25°CCTM to values between 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1 Ω cm2 allows us to compare the four technologies currently on the market (p-BSF, p-PERC, adv. n-PERT, n-SHJ), as shown in Fig. 7 on the right. It can be seen that the differences between the cell architectures are small enough to be potentially outweighed by the additional RCTM present in a module.
 Fig. 7  Yearly energy production per rated power at cell level (RCTM = 0, STC) for temperate (Geneva) and subtropical (Abu Dhabi) climate conditions. The data were calculated based on the temperature- and irradiance-dependent measurements of the different cell architectures and assuming temperature-dependent RCTM. Lines are guides to the eye. The dashed areas on the right illustrate the trends for four architectures, assuming that R25°CCTM is between 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1 Ω cm2 at the two different locations. 
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the slope of all curves is steeper with the subtropical climate conditions, indicating that RCTM is more detrimental to energy production performance in subtropical climates than in temperate climates. This is also partly associated with an increasing share of ohmic losses at higher temperatures as discussed in Section 3.4. However, the main driver behind this effect is that, in Abu Dhabi, a larger part of the energy is produced at higher irradiance, i.e., between 800 W m−2 and 1000 W m−2 (cf. the yield histogram shown in Fig. 8). At higher irradiance, the detrimental influence of RCTM is also higher as can be seen in Fig. 9, in which the irradiance-dependant efficiency at 25 °C is shown for the p-BSF cell. In Geneva, a larger share of the energy is produced at irradiances below 800 W m−2 and as a consequence the detrimental effect of RCTM is counterbalanced.

 Fig. 9  Efficiency of the p-BSF cell at 25 °C versus irradiance. The data in black correspond to the measured data; the grey data were calculated using eqn (7) and assuming additional ohmic cell-to-module losses, RCTM. 
It is striking that under temperate climate conditions (here: Geneva), EPRPcell is the same for all architectures. If the area for a photovoltaic system is not a constraint, all architectures will produce the same amount of energy at a given system power. Under hot climate conditions, the n-SHJ architecture produces more energy per kW. Depending on the price per kW, n-SHJ is therefore better suited for applications in hot climates. The superior performance of the SHJ architecture under hot climate conditions was also experimentally shown by Abdallah et al.68 based on data from an outdoor test facility.
Furthermore, for hot and sunny climates, a technology with very low series resistance, both on the cell and module level, should be chosen. However, in optimizing of modules for applications in hot and sunny climates, the energy gain due to thicker and thus less resistive cell interconnection ribbons may outweigh their additional costs. The awareness of these points enables the adequate choice of the solar cell and module technology for an accurate calculation of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).
4 Conclusions
We presented temperature- and irradiance-dependent J(V) measurements of silicon solar cells featuring state-of-the-art device architectures and the derived temperature coefficients (TCs) of the J(V) parameters. When comparing the TC of the power at the maximum power point (TCPMPP) with data from module data sheets, we found that the TCs of the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current density of modules and cells are similar but TCPMPP of the modules is generally worse.
This difference can be explained assuming that there is additional series resistance, RCTM, which is induced by cell interconnections in a module. The additional RCTM leads to a worse TC of the fill factor and hence a worse TCPMPP. We developed an equation to calculate the TCPMPP of a module when the TCPMPP and R25°CMPP of the cells as well as R25°CCTM are known.
Furthermore, we calculated the annually produced energy for the different architectures for two climates. Comparing the results, we showed that RCTM is more detrimental in hot and sunny climate conditions. A solar cell architecture featuring high internal resistance at the maximum power point (RMPP = VMPP/JMPP) performs best under such conditions and is less prone to losses due to RCTM. Candidates to fulfill this are solar cell architectures featuring passivating contacts and thus high operating voltages such as silicon heterojunction architectures, which are included in our analysis.
In summary, for the highest performance in hot and sunny climates, a high VOC on the cell level and low ohmic cell interconnections on the module level are essential.

Broader context
In many developing countries, electricity is currently provided mostly by fossil fuel combustion. With ongoing industrial development and population growth in these countries, the demand for electricity will increase dramatically in the future. This electricity should be supplied by a cost-effective technology that is, in view of the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, based on renewable energy resources. Silicon solar cells are perfectly suited to supply electricity under these conditions because the technology is mature and the base material is abundant. Furthermore, prices for solar cells have markedly decreased in recent years. Studies now indicate that solar will be the cheapest source of electricity in terms of capital expenditure, by 2030. Understanding how different photovoltaic technologies are influenced by temperature is mandatory in selecting the best technology. We compare the temperature and irradiance dependencies of the current standard cell technology (silicon-based aluminum back surface field, BSF) with those of an emerging technology (passivated emitter rear cell, PERC) and other advanced technologies such as silicon heterojunction solar cells. In addition, we discuss electrical cell-to-module losses and their impact on the energy production of each technology.

 	Fig. 2  Injection-dependent effective minority carrier lifetime, τmin, of symmetrically passivated samples as obtained from temperature-dependent minority carrier lifetime measurements on a Sinton WCT-120TS setup. The lifetime curves indicate the passivation schemes in the investigated cells. (a) On p-type c-Si, homojunction passivation, (b) on n-type c-Si (homojunction), (c) on n-type c-Si (a-Si:H(i/p) and a-Si:H(i/n) passivation).	 

 	Fig. 3  Temperature-dependent J(V) parameters of the investigated solar cell architectures. The measurements were taken under AM 1.5G irradiance at 1000 W m−2. The parameters depend linearly on the temperature except for the FF of the solar cells incorporating silicon heterojunctions. As a consequence also the temperature dependency of the efficiency η is non-linear for these devices. The data were linearly least-square fitted to derive the TCs, as indicated by the solid lines. Dashed lines indicate linear extrapolation.

 	Fig. 6  Relative power (normalized to PMPP at 25 °C) versus temperature for the p-BSF cell at 1000 W m−2 with AM 1.5G irradiation. The dash-dotted lines are calculated from the cell data using eqn (7) for each temperature step and assuming an additional temperature-dependent (TCRCTM = −0.4% K−1) series resistance, RCTM, of 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1 Ω cm2 at 25 °C. The values in brackets correspond to TCPMPP and were obtained by linear fitting. The relative power of the module is calculated with the TCPMPP of the SolarWorld SW 320 XL module taken from Table 3.

 	Fig. 7  Yearly energy production per rated power at cell level (RCTM = 0, STC) for temperate (Geneva) and subtropical (Abu Dhabi) climate conditions. The data were calculated based on the temperature- and irradiance-dependent measurements of the different cell architectures and assuming temperature-dependent RCTM. Lines are guides to the eye. The dashed areas on the right illustrate the trends for four architectures, assuming that R25°CCTM is between 0.5 Ω cm2 and 1 Ω cm2 at the two different locations.
