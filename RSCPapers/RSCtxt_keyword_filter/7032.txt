    , Accepted 15th March 2011First published on 12th April 2011AbstractA thin layer of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) deposited on a conductive glass was used as a photo-anode in photo-electrochemical solar cells yielding a photovoltage of 675 mV and 2 mA cm−2 short circuit photocurrent. The response of the QD based photoactive electrodes correlated with the absorption spectra of the QDs which is easily tuned by size modification. Similar geometry based on acid treated CdS quantum dots, provided a photo-cathode with complementary photovoltage. A tandem photo-electrochemical cell consisting of the two photoactive electrodes exhibits Voc of 816 mV. The tandem configuration enables achieving the highest photovoltage reported to date for QD based photo-electrochemical cells. However, current matching still requires optimization of the spectral response and charge collection efficiencies of the two photoactive electrodes. The results demonstrate a new approach for the beneficial utilization of QDs in photo-electrochemical cells towards efficient, low cost photovoltaics.

Broader context
Direct solar energy conversion to electricity by the photovoltaic effect is limited by the energy spectrum of the solar irradiation. It is therefore essential to minimize the energy losses associated with the mismatch between the photon energies and the active materials in the solar cell. This manuscript reports on a photo-electrochemical tandem cell that consists of two semiconductor quantum dot electrodes that are tuned to cover different parts of the solar spectrum. CdSe quantum dots directly deposited on a conductive glass serve as a photo-anode facing a CdS quantum dots photo-cathode mediated by polysulfide electrolyte. The photo-cathodic nature of the CdS is achieved via surface treatment that affects the relative electron–hole extraction rate to the electrolyte. The reported tandem configuration exhibits the highest photovoltage reported up to date for QD based photo-electrochemical cells. The results demonstrate a new approach towards efficient, low cost photovoltaics utilizing quantum dots in photo-electrochemical cells.

Introduction
Third-generation photovoltaics aim at low cost devices with conversion efficiencies beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 Several approaches towards multi-junction systems via tandem arrangement or spectral splitting were tested and other concepts involving optical and electronic up- and down conversion, impact ionization and hot electron utilization were suggested.2–7 Although these kinds of configurations can lead to high conversion efficiencies, usually their production is complicated and expensive. Quantum dots (QDs), having unique opto-electronic properties8–10 which can be tailored by changing their size11–13 appear as a good candidate for third generation photovoltaics.14–19 Many architectures for QD-based cells were proposed, including QD layers sandwiched between electron and hole conductors,20–23 QD/polymer blends,24–26 QD/nanocrystalline wide-bandgap semiconductor heterojunctions27 and the photo-electrochemical approach involving QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)28–36 and QD films immersed in an electrolyte.37–41 Recently, several attempts have been made in order to expand the spectral response window of the solar cell by coupling QDs with molecular dyes18,33,42 or by utilization of various types of QDs as co-sensitizers.43
Here we report on a QD based tandem solar cell utilizing two QD materials. The QDs deposited on conducting electrodes in a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC) are tuned to match the solar spectrum. The use of nanosize semiconductors in a PEC was introduced in the 80's, showing the ability to build charge within the nanocrystals immersed in an electrolyte.40,44 The measured photovoltage was explained by charge carrier trapping in surface states. A photo-anode was defined when holes were trapped at the surface allowing free electron transport to the substrate and vice versa for photo-cathode.
The photovoltage in a PEC is defined by the difference in chemical potential between the photo-electrode and the redox electrolyte, which is photo-inactive. It is possible to utilize two photo-electrodes that are connected in series via the electrolyte in a single PEC. The total photovoltage in such a cell is a sum of the chemical potential differences between each electrode and the electrolyte which is of advantage if one photo-electrode resembles an n-type material while the other acts as a p-type photo-cathode.
The tandem PEC reported here involves two photoactive electrodes in which QDs are the only active material. In other words both the photo-anode and the photo-cathode consisted of a thin layer of QDs directly deposited on a conductive substrate. Using CdSe as the anodic photoactive material and modified CdS as the cathodic one we show that QDs can solely generate photovoltaic activity when immersed in polysulfide electrolyte. Thus, illumination via the CdS photo-cathode enables efficient utilization of the solar spectrum, resulting in an open circuit photovoltage of 816 mV. The tandem configuration exhibits, to the best of our knowledge, the highest value for QD based solar cells. While discussing the photovoltaic mechanism in QD based PEC we demonstrate the power of this new approach as a method to achieve low cost, high voltage, tandem PEC.
Results and discussion
A schematic representation of the QD based tandem photo-electrochemical cell (PEC) is shown in Fig. 1. Both electrodes consist of a QD layer deposited directly on a transparent conducting glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO). For the photo-anode a 220 nm thick layer of n-type like CdSe QDs is used, whereas for the photo-cathode a 70 nm thick p-type like CdS QD layer is deposited. The two photo-electrodes were immersed in a polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S/0.1 M S) to form a sandwich type cell. Illumination was done from the CdS based photo-cathode side towards the smaller band gap CdSe based photo-anode. The optical parameters of the electrodes, controlled by the size of the QDs and layer thickness, are designed for efficient utilization of the light in the tandem configuration.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic representation of QD based tandem PEC, illuminated through the photo-cathode. (b) Energy band diagram for electron-transfer processes in the tandem cell: (1) exciton generation within the QDs, (2) hole removal from CdSe photo-anode by polysulfide electrolyte, (3) electron injection from CdS photo-cathode to the polysulfide electrolyte. Voc1 and Voc2 represent the photovoltage of the photo-anode and cathode, respectively. Voc total is equal to the sum of both. 
Under illumination, photons absorbed by the QDs generate excitons in the two electrode materials (Process 1, Fig. 1b). In the photo-anode, holes are quickly removed by the electrolyte while the electrons accumulate in the n-type like QDs generating photovoltage (Process 2, Fig. 1b). The opposite process occurs at the p-type like QD based photo-cathode, where electrons are removed by the electrolyte and holes accumulate within the QDs. The hole accumulation results in a photovoltage of negative sign with respect to the electrolyte potential (Process 3, Fig. 1b).
In PECs the photovoltage (Voc) is defined by the difference in chemical potential between the electrons and the holes transport media. In a single photo-electrode based PEC, the electrolyte serves as one of the charge carriers which is compared with the chemical potential of either the accumulated electrons (Voc 1, Fig. 1b) or holes (Voc 2, Fig. 1b). In a tandem QD solar cell, the Voc is determined between the chemical potentials of the photo-anode (electron carrier) and the photo-cathode (hole carrier). Consequently the overall potential is the sum of the photovoltages of both single photoactive electrodes (Voc total = Voc 1 + Voc 2, Fig. 1b). Table 1 summarizes the I–V performance of three PECs consisting of (i) CdSe photo-anode only countered by a Pt cathode (Voc = 675 mV, Jsc = 1.2 mA cm−2, FF = 44%), (ii) CdS photo-cathode only with the Pt counter as anode (Voc = −111 mV, Jsc = 0.1 mA cm−2, FF = 24), and (iii) a tandem cell combining both photoactive electrodes (Voc = 816 mV, Jsc = 0.5 mA cm−2, FF = 22).

The table demonstrates the contribution of both photoactive electrodes to the overall photovoltage in the tandem cell. The high Voc value achieved in the tandem cell, 816 mV, is slightly higher than the sum of photovoltages measured in the cells consisting of one photoactive electrode. This result demonstrates the need to optimize the spectral response of each electrode for operation within the tandem system. Similar conclusion is drawn from the low photocurrent and fill factor in the tandem configuration. The series connection between the photo-anode and the photo-cathode requires current matching via adjustment of the spectral response as per the solar spectrum and the external quantum yield of each electrode material. Improvement of the overall fill factor involves the recombination mechanisms in both the photoanode and cathode and charge transport in the two electrodes and the electrolyte.
Further evidence for the accumulative effect of the tandem PEC on the photovoltage is provided by photovoltage spectroscopy (PVS). PVS measures the open circuit photovoltage of a solar cell as a function of the illumination wavelength. Fig. 2a presents the absorption spectra of the two photoactive electrodes. Fig. 2b presents the PVS curves of two cells: (i) CdSe photo-anode only countered by a Pt cathode, and (ii) a tandem cell combining both photoactive electrodes. Scanning from the long wavelength part of the spectrum towards the higher illumination energies, both cells exhibit a photovoltage onset at 650 nm. The similar photovoltage onset of the two cells and the electrodes absorption data (Fig. 2a) indicate excitation of the CdSe QD photo-anode. Further scan towards shorter wavelength activates the CdS QD photo-cathode at ∼520 nm, resulting in a photovoltage step for the tandem cell in comparison with the CdSe photo-anode only.

Similar behavior is evident in the IPCE (incident photon to current efficiency) measurements of the tandem cell in comparison with the cell containing CdSe photo-anode only (Fig. 2c). Here also both cells exhibit a similar onset at 650 nm, and higher IPCE values are measured for the tandem cell at short wavelengths where both electrodes are active. Scanning towards longer wavelengths where the CdS photo-cathode loses the photoactivity results in a gradual drop of the IPCE values compared to the photo-anode only cell. Being in the dark in this spectral region the photo-cathode is inferior to the standard Pt counter electrode of the photo-anode only cell. We note that the lower IPCE values of the tandem cell are the result of a monochromatic light measurement. Under normal operation, where the whole solar spectrum is available, both electrodes are illuminated and are thus active.
The operation of the QD based photoactive electrodes was found to correlate with the absorption spectra of the QDs and the ability to extract the charge carriers. Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of the electrode spectrum which is modified by the QD growth duration. Longer growth leads to larger QDs and thicker films which extend the spectral window to longer wavelength and increase the optical density of the electrode. Consequently, the IPCE curves of the photo-anode only cells show higher values and wider spectral coverage for longer growth durations of the QD films on the conductive glass. Similar trend is obtained in the overall cell performance as presented in Table 2.

In the context of the current manuscript these electrodes provide a half of the tandem system having the advantage of higher photovoltage but with a need for current matching with the photo-cathode. Meanwhile we examine the limits of a photo-anode only cell based on modification of the QD material, size and shape. The performances shown in Table 2 demonstrate the prospect of this new approach towards efficient PECs.
The photo-cathode utilized in the tandem cell consists of CdS QDs that were chemically transformed to p-type like behavior. The chemical treatment involved dipping in 1% HCl aqueous solution for several seconds. Fig. 4a shows a gradual decrease of photovoltage measured for the treated CdS electrodes in a PEC, as a function of the surface treatment duration. Long treatments lead to inversion of the photovoltage to negative values corresponding to a transformation of a photo-anode to a photo-cathode. The same phenomenon is evident in the tandem cell measurements presented in Fig. 4b. The shift of the CdS photoactive electrode towards the cathodic behavior (longer HCl treatment) increases the Voc of the tandem PEC up to 800 mV. The low values measured for short treatment durations represent the distractive effect of utilizing two photo-anodes in a single cell.

The mechanism associated with the transformation of the CdS QD photo-anode to a photo-cathode presented in Fig. 5, involves kinetic considerations which are associated with a modification of the QD surface.40,44 The as prepared CdS QDs exhibit n-type like behavior which is expressed in electron accumulation within the film and hole removal to the electrolyte (Fig. 5a). The photovoltage of an as prepared CdS QD film in a polysulfide based PEC is 550 mV. Following 15 s of exposure to 1% HCl the CdS QDs have p-type like performance, where holes are accumulated in the QD film following fast removal of the electrons by the electrolyte (Fig. 5c). The photovoltage of the fully converted CdS QD electrode in a polysulfide based PEC is −110 mV. The transformation point between the n-type and p-type behaviors, defined by similar removal rates for the electrons and holes (Fig. 5b), is achieved following 6 s of HCl surface treatment. In this case, the photovoltage decreases to practically 0 mV indicating the inability of the system to build chemical energy within the QDs. This conversion mechanism was explained by a diffusion like model.44 Prior to exposure to HCl, the majority of the surface states can capture holes more effectively than electrons (acceptor surface states). Thus, electrons can diffuse toward the conductive glass and holes can be removed at the interface between the surface states and the polysulfide electrolyte, which serves as a recombination contact. After HCl treatment, the chemical properties of the surface states are altered, making electron capture more favourable than hole capture (donor surface states). In this case, holes will diffuse toward the conductive glass, while electrons can be removed via the recombination contact with the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in a photo-cathodic behaviour.
 Fig. 5  The transformation of the CdS QD from n to p-type like behavior is shown: (a) n-type like photo-electrode, accumulation of electrons within the film while holes are removed by the electrolyte. (b) Intermediate state in which electrons and holes transfer to the electrolyte. (c) p-Type like photo-electrodes, accumulation of holes within the film followed by electron injection to the electrolyte. 
This mechanism suggests that it may be possible to increase the efficiency of the photo-cathode via chemical modifications of the QD surface.
Experimental
CdS and CdSe QDs were synthesized by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique.45 For CdS QDs deposition, FTO electrodes were immersed in a mixture of 2.35 ml of 0.5 M CdSO4 and 2.65 ml of 0.7 M potassium nitrilotriacetate (K3NTA) at pH 8.5 adjusted by 10% KOH. This solution was mixed with 4.25 ml of 0.4 M thiourea and then diluted with 7.55 ml of distilled water. Finally the pH was readjusted to pH 11 using again 10% KOH. After the electrode was immersed into the solution it was heated up to 70 °C for two hours, resulting in 70 nm of CdS QDs on FTO. A pre-deposited CdS QD thin layer serves as a substrate for the growth of CdSe QDs. First, as the Se source, an 80 mM sodium selenosulfate (Na2SeSO3) solution was prepared by dissolving elemental Se powder in a 200 mM Na2SO3 solution. Second, 80 mM CdSO4 and 120 mM potassium nitrilotriacetate (K3NTA) were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:1. Finally, both solutions were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:2. Then, the FTO electrodes were placed in a glass container filled with the final solution for a 24 h deposition time at 10 °C. The CdSe QD films were modified by ZnS coating46,47 by twice dipping alternately into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions for 1 min per dip, rinsing with distilled water between dips. For the CdS QD surface treatment the film was dipped in dilute HCl (1%) for different periods of time and immediately washed with distilled water.
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were performed with an Eco-Chemie potentiostat. A solar simulator class A (new port) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 spectrum) served as a light source. The illuminated area of the cell was set to 1 cm2 using an aperture. 1 M Na2S, 0.1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M KOH solution served as the electrolyte. A sputtered Pt-coated FTO glass was used as a counter-electrode. A 250 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel) served as a light source for photovoltage spectroscopy (PVS), incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) and for the photovoltage measurements.
Conclusion
In this work we demonstrated the ability to construct photo-electrochemical cells (PECs) based on QD electrodes only. We show performance evolution of the CdSe photo-anode resulting in photocurrents up to 2 mA cm−2. In the same manner, we fabricated a photo-cathode by inducing a systematic shift of n-type like CdS QDs towards p-type like behavior by applying a simple surface treatment. We present, for the first time, a tandem PEC made solely from QDs acting as photoactive anode and cathode. Using an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte, the tandem cell exhibits among the highest photovoltage reported up to date (816 mV) for QD based PEC. The utilization of a photo-cathode working in an aqueous media opens a new path of further research on water splitting applications, while improving 3rd generation solar cell devices.

Broader context
Direct solar energy conversion to electricity by the photovoltaic effect is limited by the energy spectrum of the solar irradiation. It is therefore essential to minimize the energy losses associated with the mismatch between the photon energies and the active materials in the solar cell. This manuscript reports on a photo-electrochemical tandem cell that consists of two semiconductor quantum dot electrodes that are tuned to cover different parts of the solar spectrum. CdSe quantum dots directly deposited on a conductive glass serve as a photo-anode facing a CdS quantum dots photo-cathode mediated by polysulfide electrolyte. The photo-cathodic nature of the CdS is achieved via surface treatment that affects the relative electron–hole extraction rate to the electrolyte. The reported tandem configuration exhibits the highest photovoltage reported up to date for QD based photo-electrochemical cells. The results demonstrate a new approach towards efficient, low cost photovoltaics utilizing quantum dots in photo-electrochemical cells.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic representation of QD based tandem PEC, illuminated through the photo-cathode. (b) Energy band diagram for electron-transfer processes in the tandem cell: (1) exciton generation within the QDs, (2) hole removal from CdSe photo-anode by polysulfide electrolyte, (3) electron injection from CdS photo-cathode to the polysulfide electrolyte. Voc1 and Voc2 represent the photovoltage of the photo-anode and cathode, respectively. Voc total is equal to the sum of both.

          IPCE measurement of CdSe photo-anode as a function of deposition time. Longer deposition results in larger QDs and thus extension of the spectral response to the red.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Photovoltage of CdS photo-electrode as a function of the surface treatment duration with respect to polysulfide electrolyte. (b) Voc of the tandem cell as a function of the surface treatment duration.	 

 	Fig. 5  The transformation of the CdS QD from n to p-type like behavior is shown: (a) n-type like photo-electrode, accumulation of electrons within the film while holes are removed by the electrolyte. (b) Intermediate state in which electrons and holes transfer to the electrolyte. (c) p-Type like photo-electrodes, accumulation of holes within the film followed by electron injection to the electrolyte.
