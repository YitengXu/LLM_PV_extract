    , Accepted 27th March 2017First published on 10th April 2017AbstractThe migration of intrinsic ions (e.g., MA+, Pb2+, I−) in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites has received significant attention with respect to the critical roles of these ions in the hysteresis and degradation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we demonstrate that extrinsic ions (e.g., Li+, H+, Na+), when used in the contact layers in PSCs, can migrate across the perovskite layer and strongly impact PSC operation. In a TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC, Li+-ion migration from spiro-OMeTAD to the perovskite and TiO2 layer is illustrated by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry. The movement of Li+ ions in PSCs plays an important role in modulating the solar cell performance, tuning TiO2 carrier-extraction properties, and affecting hysteresis in PSCs. The influence of Li+-ion migration was investigated using time-resolved photoluminescence, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and external quantum efficiency spectra. Other extrinsic ions such as H+ and Na+ also show a clear impact on the performance and hysteresis in PSCs. Understanding the impacts of extrinsic ions in perovskite-based devices could lead to new material and device designs to further advance perovskite technology for various applications.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) represent a new class of promising photovoltaic materials with superior performance and low fabrication cost. One special feature of perovskite materials compared to the traditional photovoltaic materials (Si, CdTe, CIGS, etc.) is that their ionic constituents can move easily. Large current–voltage hysteresis is believed to be one major consequence of the ionic movement in PSCs. Ionic movement can also affect device interfaces and lead to stability issues. In this work, we show that not only the intrinsic ions (e.g. MA+, I−), but also extrinsic ions, such as Li+, Na+ and H+, when used in the contact layers of PSCs, can migrate across the perovskite layer and strongly affect PSC operation, including charge separation at the TiO2/perovskite interface and the current–voltage hysteresis in the solar cells. Similar modulation effects can be seen with H+ and Na+ ions. These results highlight the important roles of extrinsic ion migration on PSCs and can enable new material and device designs to further advance perovskite technology for various applications.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have recently drawn tremendous interest due to their potential for constructing high-performance solar cells1,2 and optoelectronic devices3–5 with low-cost and low-energy solution processing.6,7 The research enthusiasm is largely a result of the rapidly rising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs), surging from single digits to over 22% within four years.8–10 Hybrid perovskites have many ideal characteristics as photovoltaic (PV) materials, such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, and low density of trapping states.11–14 However, unlike most of the traditional PV materials, the hybrid perovskite materials (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) show very strong ionic characteristics.15 Numerous reports with both theoretical calculations16–18 and experimental observations19–22 show that the ions in perovskite materials (e.g., MA+ or I−) have low activation barriers and modest ionic diffusion coefficients to move within perovskite devices, especially when subjected to external bias or under light illumination. This feature of hybrid perovskites has inspired many exciting studies leading to novel optoelectronic/electronic applications, such as switchable PV23 and nonvolatile memory.24,25 However, it has also led to slow changes of optoelectronic properties and performances in perovskite-based devices on the timescales of seconds to minutes. This was initially noticed through the anomalous current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in the PSCs26 and subsequently evidenced by more phenomena such as solar cell performance modulation by pre-condition biasing and light soaking,27–29 slow photoconductivity response,30 and halide redistribution and segregation.31,32 Furthermore, ionic movement has adverse effects on the stability of PSCs because the migrating ions can react with metal electrodes33 and not return to the equilibrium position after electrical poling, resulting in the degradation of PSCs. Thus, understanding and controlling ionic movements in perovskite materials is critical for perovskite-based electronic and optoelectronic applications.
The discrepancy of J–V curves when scanned in the forward and reverse directions—so-called J–V hysteresis—is one of the obstacles hindering the commercialization of PCSs, due to the unstable PV output and difficulty in precisely determining the PV performance parameters.34 Several mechanisms have been suggested as origins of J–V hysteresis in PSCs such as ferroelectric polarization,35 trapping of carriers at interfaces36 and capacitive current induced by ion redistribution.37 However, the leading explanation is ion migration and accumulation at the two charge-extraction interfaces that modulate the built-in electric field in PSCs.27,38 More recent modeling and experiments suggest that J–V hysteresis is a combined effect of ion migration and change of interface recombination induced by the accumulated ionic species or defects.39,40 There are reports showing that ions from perovskites could move into the hole/electron transport layers (HTL/ETLs), enhance carrier-extraction ability, and reduce interface recombination, leading to reduced hysteresis.41,42 Regardless of the exact mechanism considered, most studies on ion migration have been focused only on the intrinsic ions (e.g., MA+, Pb2+, and I−) from the perovskite layer itself.15–20,22,23,29,37–42 Extrinsic ions from the transport layers (HTLs/ETLs), such as various dopants from these layers, have been largely overlooked to date.
Here, we demonstrate the significance of extrinsic ion migration to PSC operation. Using a common device architecture (TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) as an example, we show that Li+ ions from the spiro-based HTL can migrate across the perovskite absorber layer to reach the TiO2 ETL. Measurements from time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra indicate that the movement of Li+ ions in PSCs strongly affects the solar cell performance, TiO2 charge-extraction property, and hysteresis in PSCs. These results can be generalized to other extrinsic ions such as H+ and Na+. Thus, it is important to study extrinsic ion migration for better understanding the general operation mechanisms of perovskite devices.
Results and discussion
The depth profiles of several key elements in PSCs determined by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) are shown in Fig. 1. TOF-SIMS can detect elements and molecular species with parts-per-million or better sensitivity, with a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude. Two types of PSCs were analyzed. One used spiro-OMeTAD HTL doped with pre-oxidized spiro(TFSI)2 and Li-TFSI (referred to as a Li-containing cell), and a second cell used spiro-OMeTAD HTL doped with only spiro(TFSI)2 (referred to as a Li-free cell). Both cells show decent PV outputs, which will be discussed later. The positions of the different layers through the depth profile of the entire device were estimated by detection of the dominant secondary-ion signal for the various layers. It is worth noting that the layer thickness is not in direct proportion to the sputtering time as a result of different sputtering rates of different layers, because the sputter rate is related to the bond strength of the layer (e.g., gold sputters much slower than the HTL). The actual layer thicknesses were determined from cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the device as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). There is an apparent overlap between adjacent layers due to the roughness of each layer, probable inter-penetration of the adjacent layers, and a small artifact effect from SIMS beam mixing. In the Li-containing PSC, lithium is primarily located in the Li-doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL (which is determined using the element S from the TFSI− anions of the dopants); but there is also a significant amount of lithium found in the perovskite and TiO2 layer, which likely results from lithium diffusion across the device stack. In contrast, the Li-free PSC shows a lithium signal at or below the instrument background in the spiro-OMeTAD layer. It is well known that the Li+ ion is small and thus has a high diffusion tendency. The migration of Li+ through perovskite materials has been demonstrated by using MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 perovskites as anode materials in Li-ion batteries.43 It is interesting to note that lithium concentration does not follow a simple Fickian diffusion distribution in the Li-containing PSC; it rises to a higher concentration in the TiO2 layer than in the perovskite layer. This suggests a higher affinity of Li+ ions to TiO2 than to perovskite. This is consistent with the findings that TiO2 is also a good anode material for Li-ion batteries, such that Li+ could easily be inserted into or extracted from the TiO2 ETL in PSCs.44,45 These TOF-SIMS results show clear evidence that Li+ ions diffuse across the perovskite layer and enter the oxide layer. It is important to note that this Li+-ion migration differs from the commonly studied intrinsic ion migrations in perovskite materials (e.g., MA+ or I−). The Li+ ions are from an extrinsic ion source, Li-TFSI, which is used as a standard dopant for HTLs. However, the roles of extrinsic ions (such as Li+) on PSCs have been largely overlooked.

The sputter time is not scaled to the actual thickness of each layer due to the different sputter rates from different layers. 
We examined the influence of Li+ ions on device characteristics through PSCs with a series of Li-TFSI concentrations doped in the spiro-OMeTAD layers. The Li-free cell used pre-oxidized spiro-OMeTAD spiro(TFSI)2 as the dopant,46 whereas other cells used both spiro(TFSI)2 and different amounts of Li-TFSI as the dopants. All cells were tested under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination with the voltage swept first in the forward (short-circuit current [Jsc] to open-circuit voltage [Voc]) and then reverse (Voc to Jsc) directions with a scan rate of 0.4 V s−1. Representative J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a with each scan direction, and the stable power outputs are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The statistical performance parameters of the reverse scan are tabulated in Table 1 for PSCs with different Li-TFSI amounts. As the Li-TFSI concentration in the HTL is increased from 0 to 10 mg mL−1 (equivalent to a Li+/spiro molar ratio from 0 to 0.54), the fill factor (FF) increased monotonically from 0.48 to 0.79. Voc remains unchanged at concentrations from 0 to 5 mg mL−1 but is reduced dramatically at 10 mg mL−1. The overall PCE peaks at 17.0% with a Li-TFSI concentration of 5 mg mL−1. The resistivity of spiro-OMeTAD HTL with different amounts of Li-TFSI dopants was measured using a 4-probe configuration (Fig. S2, ESI†). Assuming that the only component changed in the solar cell is the HTL, the serial resistance (Rs) of the device is expected to change in proportion to the resistance of the HTLs. However, the Rs relationship to HTL resistivity is less straight-forward. Rs shows a rapid drop with increasing Li-TFSI concentration below 5 mg mL−1, while the HTL resistance barely changed. When Li-TFSI was increased from 5 to 10 mg mL−1, the HTL resistance dropped more significantly, yet the Rs remained almost unchanged. The incommensurate changes of Rs and HTL resistance suggest that HTL is not the only component changed in the solar cells when Li-TFSI dopant is added. It is likely that the Li+-ion migration observed (Fig. 1) is influencing other layers underneath the HTLs.

Besides the changes in device performance, more profound changes are found in the J–V hysteresis. The hysteresis effect is much more severe with a higher concentration of Li-TFSI in HTLs. This could be seen both from the J–V scans in Fig. 2a and the extracted PCEs of forward and reverse scans in Fig. 2b. The increased degree of hysteresis at higher Li-TFSI concentration suggests that Li+ could be one factor contributing to the hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs.
To further verify that the observed performance and hysteresis changes are affected by the Li+-ion migration (rather than just from the change of HTL), we compared two solar cells fabricated with the same Li-free HTL but following different fabrication approaches. Cell 1 was deposited with the Li-free HTL immediately after perovskite deposition. In Cell 2, the perovskite layer was initially coated with the Li-doped HTL and tested after finishing the Au electrodes (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Li-doped HTL and Au electrode were subsequently removed by soaking in chlorobenzene. Cell 2 was then re-deposited with the same Li-free HTL and Au electrode as Cell 1. Although the HTLs were identical, the two cells showed different J–V characteristics in Fig. 2d, with Cell 2 having better PCE and FF as well as larger hysteresis. The difference could be explained by the processing history of Cell 2 as illustrated in Fig. 2c. Li+ ions (schematically illustrated using light green crosses) migrated to the perovskite and TiO2 layer when Cell 2 was coated with the Li-doped HTL. The migrated Li+ ions remained in the perovskite and TiO2 layers when the Li-doped HTL was removed using chlorobenzene. The residual Li+ ions in Cell 2 improve the cell performance and cause larger J–V hysteresis. The residual Li+ ions in Cell 2 were also verified by induced coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). This suggests that the observed performance differences of solar cells with different Li+ doping are more related to the migrating Li+ ions, even though changes of HTL properties cannot be completely ruled out.

Fig. 3a compares the PCE of the forward and reverse scan at different scan rates (J–V scan showed in Fig. S4, ESI†). For the purpose of discussion, we define the hysteresis factor (HF) using the following expression: Hysteresis factor = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse.(1)The results for PSCs with and without Li+ in the HTL are compared in Fig. 3b. The hysteresis effects in PSCs are usually reduced with a slower scan speed.26,27 We observe a similar trend in the Li-containing cell. Starting with a large HF of 0.35 at 400 mV s−1, the forward and reverse PCEs converge to nearly identical values at a slow scan rate of 2 mV s−1. In contrast, Li-free PSCs exhibit a different behavior. Their HF values remain small at about 0.08 with a wide scan range (400 to 10 mV s−1), and increase significantly at slower scan rates (HF = 0.17 at 4 mV s−1; HF = 0.21 at 2 mV s−1). This anomalous behavior suggests that the hysteresis for PSCs with and without Li dopants could be dominated by different factors.

Ion migrations and subsequent accumulations at the interfaces between perovskite and electron/hole transport layers have commonly been proposed as the main physical origin of the hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs.27,38–42 It is worth pointing out that most such studies (including both theoretical and experimental work) have focused only on the intrinsic ions (e.g., MA+ or I−) as the source causing the hysteresis, which is clearly evident. However, based on our TOF-SIMS observation of Li+-ion migration as well as the distinct hysteresis behaviors in PSCs with and without the use of Li-TFSI in the HTL, it is clear that the Li+ migration in the Li-containing device also has a major contribution to the observed larger hysteresis effects compared to the Li-free devices. The ionic mobility of Li+ in the perovskite is expected to be higher than that of the intrinsic ions, given its smaller size. We hypothesize that the easy-migrating Li+ ions in Li-containing cells introduce a large additional component to the hysteresis at fast scans and reach a quasi-equilibrium state at slow scans. For Li-free devices, the intrinsic ions are “frozen” at relatively fast scan rates where the devices show negligible hysteresis.28 The intrinsic ions start to mobilize at slower scan rates and introduce hysteresis effects. Li+ can have different diffusion mechanisms in the perovskite lattice compared to intrinsic ions. The different diffusion kinetics can explain the different rate dependences of hysteresis effects observed in PSCs with and without Li dopants (Fig. 3a and b).
The different hysteresis behavior of PSCs with and without Li dopants is further illustrated from J–V scans shown with variable voltage steps in Fig. 3c and d. When the cell experiences a sudden increase in bias, the photocurrent generally shows an initial drop, followed by an increasing transition to reach an equilibrium state. These transitions usually take seconds or even minutes in PSCs. J–V hysteresis is generally observed when the bias is scanned so fast that the photocurrent has not reached the equilibrium state at each scanning voltage before being recorded in their transition states (lower in forward scans and higher in reverse scans). As illustrated in Fig. 3d, the magnitude of photocurrent transition (ΔI) in the Li-containing device is larger than that in the Li-free device, but the transition is faster (i.e., time constant τ is smaller). The large ΔI of Li-containing cells causes large current differences between forward and reverse scans at fast scan rates, resulting in a large J–V hysteresis. The slower photocurrent transition kinetics in Li-free devices supports our hypothesis that intrinsic ions migrate at a slower rate than the Li+-ion migration in Li-containing devices.
For a planar PSC architecture using TiO2 ETL, charge extraction from perovskite to TiO2 is often not ideal and can also contribute to hysteresis behavior.6,47 Doping TiO2 with lithium salt has been shown as one way to improve the charge injection from perovskite to TiO2.48,49 To understand why Li doping in the HTL can affect the hysteresis, we conducted TRPL measurements to examine the potential impact of Li+-ion migration on charge extraction at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Perovskite thin films were deposited either on glass substrates or on glass with a sprayed TiO2 compact layer. For all these samples, a 50 nm PMMA layer was coated on the perovskite layer to avoid degradation in ambient conditions. The TRPL results are shown in Fig. 4 and the derived TRPL lifetimes are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The laser pulse intervals were set to 10 μs. For certain samples with long PL lifetime, the observable residual PL signals from previous laser pulses were imposed to the TRPL spectra and raised the baseline. Perovskite deposited on the TiO2 layer does not show pronounced photoluminescence (PL) quenching compared to the pristine perovskite layer. It has been shown that TiO2 itself did not efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite and acted as a poor PL quencher in other studies.50 The PL showed a substantially faster decay when TiO2 was pre-doped with Li salt, with a lifetime of 2.8 μs for perovskite on pristine TiO2 compared to 2.0 μs for perovskite on Li-doped TiO2. Li doping modulates the perovskite/TiO2 interface and facilitates electron injection from the perovskite into TiO2, leading to a stronger quenching effect. Interestingly, better PL quenching is also observed when the Li salt is intentionally added to the perovskite layer or to the top PMMA coating layer when these samples are deposited on the TiO2 layer. In contrast, when the TiO2 ETL is absent, a modest amount of Li doping in the perovskite (TOF-SIMS element analysis; Fig. S5, ESI†) does not show any noticeable effect on the PL lifetime, as shown in the PL transient of the Li-doped-perovskite/PMMA sample (labeled as PVSK + Li+). Regardless of the specific layer doped with Li, the PL results all show faster decay when both Li and TiO2 are present in the sample stacks (Fig. 4). These results, especially with the TiO2/perovskite/Li-doped-PMMA sample, strongly suggest that Li+ ions migrate through the perovskite layer and modify the TiO2 interface, facilitating carrier injection from the perovskite to TiO2. This enhancement of carrier extraction assisted by the migrated Li+ ions is consistent with the solar cell performance results, where higher FF and PCE were attained with higher Li-TFSI doping in the HTLs.

The Li+-ion migration model can also be used to explain the solar cell performance changes after positive or negative pre-bias poling. Li+ ions are driven toward or away from the TiO2 interface under positive or negative external bias (the bias polarity is defined as follows: FTO/TiO2 is grounded and bias is applied to the HTL side, poling was taken under dark conditions). The accumulation or removal of Li+ at the TiO2 surface modifies the charge-separation process at the perovskite/TiO2 interfaces, thereafter affecting the overall performance of PSCs. Light soaking of PSC under open-circuit conditions can be considered as holding the solar cell under a positive pre-bias, so the light soaking can also exhibit a pre-bias effect.29 KPFM is a non-contact atomic force microscope technique to measure the surface potential distribution of materials at nm resolution. The KPFM of the cross-section of a PSC shows the potential profiles across different layers in the PSCs and can provide information such as junction position and width of the depletion region.51 The KPFM potential line profiles in Fig. 5a and b were measured at 0 V bias after the device was withdrawn from pre-bias at +1 V or at −1 V. The corresponding KPFM images are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The perovskite/TiO2 interpenetration region was difficult to resolve in the KPFM image due to the thin thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer. For a solar cell with 10 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI in spiro-OMeTAD, the potential drop was mainly seen at the TiO2/perovskite interface, indicating an n–p junction structure.51 The amount of potential drop at the n–p junction area is proportional to the local electric field. A larger potential drop indicates a stronger electric field and better charge separation at the particular interface. After being removed from the positive poling bias of +1 V, the electric field at the TiO2/perovskite interface is stronger initially but decreases gradually to an equilibrium state in several minutes. The potential change is more significant after −1 V negative poling. The electric field is weaker immediately after the poling with a normalized potential drop of about 0.6, but also gradually recovers to its steady state as the normalized potential drop increases to 0.8 after 9 minutes. This observation is consistent with our Li+-ion migration models that Li+ ions accumulate at the TiO2 interface driven by the positive poling and facilitate the charge separation. Because negative poling sweeps Li+ ions away from TiO2 interface, the charge separation is hindered at the beginning but recoverable when Li+ ions diffuse back to the equilibrium state. The change in charge-separation properties could also be seen from the EQE spectra of the PSCs after poling (Fig. 5c). The EQE spectra were taken at 0 V within 2 minutes after removing the pre-bias poling before the Li+ ions could migrate back to the equilibrium state. The EQE responses are enhanced after positive pre-bias and reduced after negative pre-bias. These changes are seen across the entire photo-response wavelength range. The increase or decrease of EQE after poling is another piece of evidence that the change of carrier-separation efficiency is affected by Li+-ion migration.

J–V hysteresis was also modulated by the pre-bias poling. The light J–V curves were measured repeatedly with forward and reverse scans after pre-bias poling, with each cycle taking about 6 seconds. Fig. 5d shows the J–V scans with the pre-condition of +1 V bias. After positive bias poling, Li+ ions accumulate at the TiO2 interface, leading to better carrier extraction and reduced interface recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interface. The device shows better FF and Voc at the 1st scan than the subsequent scans. Also, the hysteresis is significantly suppressed in the 1st scan after positive poling. In contrast, with pre-condition of −1 V poling (Fig. 5e), the Li+ ions are swept away from the TiO2 interface, hindering the carrier extraction and increasing recombination. Consequently, lower Voc and FF and large hysteresis are seen after the negative poling. In both cases, the J–V curves recover to a similar equilibrium state after about 10 repeated forward and reverse cycles. Hysteresis factors were calculated for each forward and reverse cycle and plotted in Fig. 5f. The hysteresis intensity changes along with the redistribution of Li+ ions in the devices. As pointed out by the modeling result, hysteresis requires conditions of both ion migration and sequential changes in interface recombination.39 After pre-bias of −1 V, the TiO2 interface is relatively Li-poor and inefficient in charge extraction. The interface recombination rate shows more profound changes from local Li+-ion movement driven by the forward and reverse scans, therefore resulting in a large J–V hysteresis (Fig. 5e). For the pre-condition at +1 V bias, TiO2 is preset to a Li-rich state with a reduced interface recombination; also the difference is trivial when Li+ ions are moved in and out of the TiO2 layer by the external scanning bias. Therefore, the hysteresis effect is less serious. This is consistent with other reports showing suppressed hysteresis in the PSCs by doping TiO2 with Li.48,49 The Li+ ions in HTMs have also shown impacts on the stability of PSCs under continuous light soaking as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The Li-containing solar cells suffered more degradation in the Voc and FF than the Li-free cells, indicating that the Li+ ions might deteriorate the interfaces in the solar cells under continuous operation. Understanding the detailed degradation mechanism requires further investigations.
The significance of extrinsic ion migration on the PSCs was further examined by using extrinsic ions other than Li+. Fig. 6 shows the impacts of extrinsic ions on the performance of PSCs using H+ and Na+ as examples. The reference cell was fabricated with pre-oxdized spiro-OMeTAD in the HTLs to avoid the extrinsic ion effects; it shows modest efficiency and hysteresis. H2SO4 and Na-TFSI were added to the HTL as the sources of H+ and Na+ ions. The solar cell performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. These results largely mimic Li+; both these two ions enhance the PCE of solar cells at the reverse scan, mainly through the improved FF. But the hysteresis between forward and reverse scan also became substantially larger with these extrinsic ions. The degree of the PCE improvement and the change in the hysteresis factor depends on the specific ions that have different migration kinetics and different impacts on the carrier collection at the interfaces. In this study, the extrinsic ions were only added through HTL dopants and the results clearly indicate that the Li+ behavior is generalizable. There are other examples in the literature showing that an alkaline halide dopant added in perovskite absorbers could lead to performance enhancement in PSCs.52–54 The improvement has often been attributed to crystallographical and morphological changes of the perovskite layers. However, our results raise the question of whether the extrinsic alkaline ion migration and modification of the carrier collection of the interfaces may also play a role in the efficiency improvement. Our study implies that the impact of extrinsic ion migration should be common to PSCs as well as other perovskite-related optoelectronic devices, with either ionic-doped contact layers or perovskite layers, and thus requires further investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated extrinsic ion (e.g., Li+, H+, Na+) migration in PSCs. We show that Li+ ions in the HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) layer diffuse across the perovskite absorber layer and accumulate in the ETL (TiO2) layer. The accumulation of Li+ ions at the TiO2 interface improves carrier injection from perovskite to TiO2, and also increases the Voc and FF in the Li-containing PSCs. Li-free and Li-containing solar cells show different hysteresis depending on the scan rate, due to the different kinetics of extrinsic and intrinsic ion migration. The migration of extrinsic Li+ ions under bias can be used to explain the changes of KPFM, EQE, and J–V hysteresis under positive and negative pre-condition poling. We have further demonstrated that other extrinsic ions (such as H+ and Na+), when added to the HTL material, can also modulate the PSC performance and hysteresis. These results suggest that, like the intrinsic ion migration, extrinsic ion migration is also a general phenomenon in perovskite-based devices with significant impacts on the performance, hysteresis, and even degradation of the PSCs. The investigation of extrinsic ion migration behaviors in perovskite devices sheds new light on current research efforts focusing only on the intrinsic ion migration, and would greatly deepen our understanding of their working mechanism and enable better device designs.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) represent a new class of promising photovoltaic materials with superior performance and low fabrication cost. One special feature of perovskite materials compared to the traditional photovoltaic materials (Si, CdTe, CIGS, etc.) is that their ionic constituents can move easily. Large current–voltage hysteresis is believed to be one major consequence of the ionic movement in PSCs. Ionic movement can also affect device interfaces and lead to stability issues. In this work, we show that not only the intrinsic ions (e.g. MA+, I−), but also extrinsic ions, such as Li+, Na+ and H+, when used in the contact layers of PSCs, can migrate across the perovskite layer and strongly affect PSC operation, including charge separation at the TiO2/perovskite interface and the current–voltage hysteresis in the solar cells. Similar modulation effects can be seen with H+ and Na+ ions. These results highlight the important roles of extrinsic ion migration on PSCs and can enable new material and device designs to further advance perovskite technology for various applications.
