    , Accepted 15th September 2015First published on 15th September 2015AbstractNon-fullerene acceptor based organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) reported so far are inferior to those derived from fullerenes. This increases the speculation on whether donors need to be tailored for advancing non-fullerene OPVs. We explored herein two direct arylation-derived diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based three-dimensional (3D) donors that can deliver respectable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.64% and 4.02% with polymeric acceptor N2200 blends, surpassing those obtained from PC71BM (3.56% and 3.22%, respectively). It is found that these 3D-shaped molecular donors can yield improved photo-to-current conversion and balanced charge transport when blending with the linear N2200 polymer. This finding suggests that engineering molecular geometry can be a promising approach for developing high-performance materials.
1 Introduction
Organic electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices have attracted extensive attention in the past decade due to their light-weight, good flexibility, and cost-effectiveness merits that can be potentially realized through simple solution processing.1 Ideally, these electron donors and acceptors should possess intensive and complementary absorption for efficient light harvesting, and the ability to form nano-structured interpenetrating networks of D–A phases for efficient photon-charge generation and transport. Although fullerene derivatives have been widely used as efficient electron acceptors for BHJ OPVs, they inherit certain drawbacks from pristine fullerene such as weak visible light absorption, limited electronic tunability, and high production cost. Therefore, vigorous efforts have been devoted to developing efficient non-fullerene acceptors,2 leading to encouraging performance for non-fullerene based OPVs.3,4
Usually, the development of non-fullerene based devices is focused on pairing acceptors with well-established efficient donors. Materials with non-planar and/or 3D architectures in general exhibit better performance in devices than planar ones,4–23 which coincides with the spherical feature of fullerenes facilitating multi-directional charge-transport in OPVs.24 Among numerous non-fullerene acceptors that have been developed so far, their device performances are usually lower than those derived from fullerenes using the same donors.3,4b,5–22 This intrigued the speculation whether the donors previously developed for blending with fullerenes are suitable for non-fullerene OPVs. It inspires us to explore possible strategies on making new donors for better pairing with efficient electron acceptors.
In this paper, four DPP electron-donating units are installed onto either a tetraphenyl-methane or a tetraphenyl-silane core via an atom efficient direct arylation reaction to result in two novel 3D-shaped donor molecules (named C-DPP and Si-DPP, Fig. 1). These donors are expected to transport hole carriers in multiple directions in devices.24 To verify our design concept, two well-known electron acceptors, polymer N2200 (ref. 25 and 26) and PC71BM were chosen to pair with 3D-DPP donors (hereafter, 3D-DPPs refer to both C-DPP and Si-DPP) for solution-processed BHJ OPV devices. The PCEs achieved for C-DPP:N2200 and Si-DPP:N2200 devices are 4.64 and 4.02%, respectively. In a parallel study, the performance of the devices made from these two molecular donors with PC71BM, C-DPP:PC71BM and Si-DPP:PC71BM have lower PCEs of 3.56% and 3.22%, respectively. The higher performance of the 3D-DPPs:N2200 devices is attributed to the improved incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) from the complementary and broader light absorption of 3D-DPPs:N2200 blends, and the more balanced charge mobility. The PCE of 4.64% is a respectable value for the non-fullerene OPVs using the molecular donor and polymer acceptor.26a–c,27 The current system also represents one of the most efficient BHJs composed of organic semiconductors obtained via direct arylation.28,29

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis, characterization and theoretical calculation

Fig. 1 depicts the synthetic route to C-DPP and Si-DPP, and the chemical structure of polymer N2200. An effective strategy to access multi-DPPs29 was used to install four DPP units onto tetraphenyl-silane and tetraphenyl-methane cores via a ligand-free palladium-catalyzed direct arylation reaction to afford C-DPP and Si-DPP with excellent yields (90% and 94%, respectively). The n-type polymer N2200 employed in this work (Mn = 49.2 kDa, Mw = 89.5 kDa and PDI = 1.8) was synthesized by using a modified reported procedure.25a The target 3D-DPPs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS) (Fig. S1–S5, see ESI†) and elemental analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were used to gain insight into the intermolecular interactions and crystallinity of C-DPP and Si-DPP. The DSC scanning from 5 to 280 °C did not find any melting or recrystallization peak (Fig. S6†), suggesting that both 3D-DPPs are non-crystalline in nature, which is similar to the 3D tetra-PDI previously reported.22
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was carried out to study the molecular geometries of 3D-DPPs. The DFT-optimized geometries show that four DPP units of 3D-DPPs are tetrahedrally orientated with radii of 2.02 and 2.05 nm, respectively (Fig. 1), owing to the sp3 hybridization of C and Si atom centers. Such a tetrahedral architecture should help suppress the tight packing of molecules.30 Structurally, the four DPP arms are connected via sp3 C and Si centers. Although the DPP arms have less molecular orbital (MO) overlap between each other, they are close to each other in space at the atomic scale. We speculate that the charges on 3D-DPPs would delocalize throughout the DPP arms, and can hop among each other. In this way, 3D distribution and transport of charges will statistically enhance the D–A charge separation and collection.
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2a shows the normalized individual UV-vis absorption spectra of the donors (C-DPP and Si-DPP), and the acceptor polymer N2200 from spin-coated films. C-DPP and Si-DPP films exhibit similar absorption spectra, with two peaks at 586 and 640 nm (C-DPP) and 582 and 640 nm (Si-DPP). These peaks are red-shifted compared to their solution absorption spectra (Fig. S7†). In order to maximize the light harvesting of BHJs, a low bandgap acceptor, N2200, with strong absorption peaks around 400 and 704 nm was chosen to complement the absorption of C-DPP and Si-DPP donors (Fig. 1a and 2b). Consequently, the blend films composed of 3D-DPPs and N2200 exhibit a strong absorption band ranging from 550 to 750 nm. In contrast to 3D-DPPs:N2200, the 3D-DPPs:PC71BM blends show mainly the 3D-DPP absorption features with a narrower band from 586 to 640 nm, along with the intense absorption at less than 350 nm arising from PC71BM (Fig. S8, see ESI†).

Besides complementary light absorption of the blends, suitable energetic levels with a sufficient frontier orbital energy (FOE) gap between the donor and acceptor are also important in driving photon-generated charge dissociation and thus determining the performance of BHJ OPVs. The electrochemical properties of C-DPP, Si-DPP, N2200, and PC71BM were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 solution. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are estimated from the E1/2 values in solution, using the value of −5.1 eV for Fc/Fc+.31Fig. 2c shows the FOEs of the donors and acceptors studied in this work. The bandgaps of C-DPP, Si-DPP, N2200, and PC71BM are 2.01, 2.04, 1.61 and 2.03 eV, respectively. The LUMO of N2200 (−4.11 eV) is close to that of PC71BM (−4.02 eV), indicating that N2200 may have comparable electron affinity with PC71BM.
2.3 BHJ device performances
Inverted devices with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/3D-DPPs:N2200/MoO3/Ag were subsequently fabricated to investigate the performance of corresponding BHJ OPVs. The devices based on the Si-DPP:N2200 (1:1) BHJ are first optimized with three sets of solvents: chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and the mixed CF/CB (1:1, v/v). The PCEs of Si-DPP:N2200 (1:1) based devices processed by CF, CB and CF/CB were 1.03, 1.73 and 3.76%, respectively (Fig. S9 and Table S1†). Note that the PCE of 3.76% in the Si-DPP:N2200 based device was accomplished without applying any post-treatments or additives. It is close to the highest PCE (3.9%) reported for the molecular donor/polymer acceptor device using the di-DPP:N2200 BHJ with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive.26a By adding 3% (v/v) CN, the PCE of Si-DPP:N2200 is further improved to 4.02%. Under similar processing conditions, C-DPP:N2200 exhibits the highest PCE of 4.64% (with an open circuit voltage, VOC, of 0.86 V; a short current, JSC, of 8.72 mA cm−2; a fill factor, FF of 0.62). Fig. 2d shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the optimal cells under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters.

The optimized 3D-DPPs:PC71BM devices were employed to compare with 3D-DPPs:N2200 devices. Unlike the 3D-DPPs:N2200, the desired solvent and effective additive for 3D-DPPs:PC71BM were CF and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3% v/v), respectively. The highest PCEs obtained for Si-DPP:PC71BM and C-DPP:PC71BM are 3.22% and 3.56%, respectively (Fig. 2d and Table 1), which are albeit lower than that obtained for the N2200-based cells. The inferior PCEs of 3D-DPPs:PC71BM are mainly ascribed to their lower JSC and FF. Although a large variety of star-shaped molecular donors have been developed for OPVs,32–34 the highest PCE for PCBM-based OPVs using these donors remains around 5%.34a,b These molecular donors may not be able to form optimal nanoscale D–A phase separated morphology with PC71BM (ESI, Fig. S13a†). However, the PCE (4.64%) achieved in our study without using fullerene is very close to the highest PCE of star-shaped donor:PC71BM BHJs reported so far,34a,b implying that polymer acceptors have the potential to be further explored for pairing with the star-shaped or 3D-shaped molecular donors.
2.4 Photoluminescence (PL) and IPCE measurements
To better understand their photophysical properties, PL spectra of neat films (3D-DPPs, N2200, PC71BM) and their corresponding D–A blends, in conjunction with the device IPCE spectra, were studied. The PL of 1:1 blends shows effective and mutual quenching of individual 3D-DPPs and N2200 emission, suggesting efficient charge transfer between 3D-DPPs and N2200 (Fig. 3). However, the emission of C-DPP can be quenched more effectively by N2200 than that of Si-DPP, which may account for the higher JSC observed for C-DPP:N2200 BHJ OPVs (Fig. 3a and Table 1). Fig. 3b displays the corresponding IPCE spectra of solar cells based on C-DPP:N2200, Si-DPP:N2200, C-DPP:PC71BM, and Si-DPP:PC71BM. The calculated JSC values from IPCE are 8.71, 8.21, 7.74, and 7.19 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 1), which are consistent with the measured JSC values. Interestingly, the IPCEs of 3D-DPPs:N2200 blends extend from 350 nm to 800 nm, which match well with their UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3b). It indicates that light absorbed by both 3D-DPPs and N2200 is effectively converted into current in solar cells (Fig. S11†), suggesting that excitons generated from the donor and acceptor domain can be dissociated effectively at the D–A junction.
 Fig. 3  (a) Steady PL spectra of 3D-DPPs, N2200 neat films, and 3D-DPPs:N2200 BHJ films (1:1, w/w) (excited at 650 nm) (b) IPCE spectra of 3D-DPPs:N2200 and 3D-DPPs:PC71BM BHJs. 
The IPCE spectra of 3D-DPPs:PC71BM BHJs range from 350–700 nm, which are slightly lower and narrower than those of 3D-DPPs:N2200. Aside from the weak absorption of PC71BM (Fig. S8 and S12†), the amorphous 3D-DPPs may intimately mix with PC71BM to prevent the formation of a suitable nanoscale D–A phase separation. As shown by the DFT calculations, 3D-DPPs have a radius of more than 2.0 nm (Fig. 1). The spherical PCBM with a diameter of ~0.8 nm35 would be embraced by 3D-DPPs, leading to intimate D–A mixing (Fig. S13a†). Such an intimate D–A mixing will enhance the quenching of PL emission (ESI, Fig. S14†), however, it will adversely affect charge separation,36 and decrease the IPCE of 3D-DPPs:PC71BM BHJs. Unlike fullerene-based BHJs, the blend of crystalline N2200 (ref. 3b and 25) with amorphous 3D-DPPs allows easier nanoscale phase separation (Fig. S13b†), facilitating better charge separation and transport.
2.5 BHJ morphology and charge carrier mobility
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements were further employed to investigate the surface morphology and charge mobility of the active layers. AFM scans were carried out for films spin-coated on ITO substrates. AFM images of the active layers based on 3D-DPPs:N2200 and 3D-DPPs:PC71BM are shown in Fig. S15.† As compared to Si-DPP-based BHJs, C-DPP-based BHJs generally exhibit a smoother surface (Fig. S15†). For the SCLC tests, all devices were fabricated by using the identical procedure for solar cell preparation. The J–V curves for the hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S16.† The third-last and second-last columns in Table 1 list the corresponding values. The hole mobility (μh) of C-DPP:N2200, Si-DPP:N2200, C-DPP:PC71BM and Si-DPP:PC71BM BHJs is 3.58, 2.12, 2.20, and 1.65 (×10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively, and the corresponding electron mobility (μe) is 2.87, 0.89, 0.11, and 0.33 (×10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. Among the four devices, C-DPP:N2200 exhibits the highest and the most balanced charge mobility with a μh/μe ratio of 1.25 (Table 1), compared with the more imbalanced μh/μe ratios of 2.3 for Si-DPP:N2200, 20.0 for C-DPP:PC71BM, and 5.0 for Si-DPP:PC71BM. This may explain the higher FF (0.62) obtained for the C-DPP:N2200 based device.
Although the electron mobility of 3D-DPPs:N2200 BHJs (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is one order of magnitude higher than that of 3D-DPPs:PC71BM BHJs (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), the hole mobilities of all four blends are very similar (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 1). This suggests that the hole-transporting channels generated from 3D-DPPs are quite insensitive to mixing with either N2200 or PC71BM, resulting in similar levels of hole mobility. This coincides well with the results of other 3D-shaped conjugated structures reported in the literature that also form uniform, amorphous thin films with isotropic properties due to the lack of grain boundaries.30 On the other hand, electron transport is more sensitive to the electron acceptor used, with polymer N2200 forming better nanoscale continuous networks than that of molecular fullerene when blended with 3D-DPPs.
2.6 General applicability
Usually, efficient OPV devices often consist of spherical shaped fullerenes as acceptors and linear polymer as donors, and the best performing non-fullerene acceptors are also non-planar or 3D-shaped.4–23 The same rationale could also be applied here, with a BHJ composed of a 3D donor and a linear polymer acceptor with one of the donor or acceptor4–23 being non-planar or 3D-shaped instead of both being 3D-shaped, to achieve high efficiency in devices.
To further assess the general applicability of 3D-donor/linear polymer acceptor combination, fluoro-substituted N2200 (di-F-N2200)3b was also used as another polymeric acceptor (ESI, Fig. S10†) to pair with the 3D-DPP donors. The preliminary device results derived from the 3D-DPPs:di-F-N2200 BHJs also showed promising PCEs of 4.41% (Si-DPP:di-F-N2200) and 4.60% (C-DPP:di-F-N2200), respectively (data not shown), which support the hypothesis of the effectiveness of 3D-donor:polymer acceptor blends.
3 Conclusions
In summary, two novel DPP-based 3D molecular donors were designed and facilely synthesized via an atom efficient direct C–H arylation reaction. The 3D-DPPs:N2200 BHJ non-fullerene based devices exhibit better performance than those derived from the fullerene-based ones, showing a respectable PCE of 4.64% for the 3D-DPPs:N2200, which is ∼30% higher than that obtained for the 3D-DPPs:PC71BM. The superior performance is attributed to the more efficient IPCE generated from the complementary light absorption of 3D-DPPs and N2200, and the high FFs obtained from the balanced charge mobilities. In contrast to the well-developed BHJs that consist of non-planar or 3D acceptors and polymer donors,4–23 the current work represents the first BHJ OPV device based on 3D donors and polymer acceptors. This preliminary yet promising result demonstrates that the strategy of blending 3D-donors with linear polymer acceptors can be effective for achieving high-performance OPVs.
4 Experimental
4.1 Materials and methods
Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and solvents were purchased from Aldrich. All 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in chloroform-d, with Bruker 300, and Bruker Avance DRX-499. 13C NMR (126 MHz) spectra were measured with a proton-decoupling pulse program. Chemical shifts for 1H and 13C NMR were referenced to residual signals from CDCl3 (1H NMR δ = 7.26 ppm and 13C NMR δ = 77.23 ppm). Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a Bruker Autoflex II. Samples were prepared by diluting the molecules in CH2Cl2 using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoicacid as the matrix. Elemental analyses were conducted on a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Theoretical calculations based on density functional methods have been performed for 3D-DPPs with the Gaussian 09 program. Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with 6-31G(d,p) basis was used to optimize the geometry.
DSC was performed on a WCT-2 thermal balance. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-670. PL spectra were measured on a Fluoroskan Ascent FL. CV was done on a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk, Pt plate, and standard 10 calomel electrode (SCE) as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) CH2Cl2 solution. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2.
The EQE system uses a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) to record the short circuit current under chopped monochromatic light. AFM images were obtained by using a Nano Scope IIIa (Digital instrument Inc.) operating in the tapping mode. SCLC was tested in electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/3D-DPPs:N2200 or PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (130 nm) and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/3D-DPPs:N2200 or PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The devices were prepared using the above-mentioned procedure. In hole-only devices, PEDOT:PSS (Clevios-PVP AI 4083) was spin-coated on ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current according to the following equation:  where J is the dark current density (mA cm−2), μ0 is the zero-field mobility (cm2 V−1 s−1), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (88.54 × 10−12 mA s V−1 s−1), εr is the relative permittivity of the material (3), V is the effective voltage (V = VApplied − VBuilt-in − Vseries resistance), and L is the thickness of the active layer.
4.2 Synthetic procedures
The synthetic procedures for precursors TBPM, TBPS and Ph-DPP can be found in the ESI.†

Synthesis of C-DPP and Si-DPP. 
The starting Ph-DPP (140 mg, 0.23 mmol), TBPM or TBPS (0.05 mmol, 31.8 mg and 32.6 mg for TBPM and TBPS, respectively), anhydrous K2CO3 (55 mg, 0.4 mmol), pivalic acid (PivOH, 6.1 mg, 0.06 mmol), and Pd(OAc)2 (2.3 mg, 0.01 mmol) were stirred in anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 5 mL) for 24 h at 105 °C under argon in a Schlenk tube. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into a 250 mL NaCl aqueous solution to remove salts and the high boiling point solvent (DMAc). The precipitate was extracted with CHCl3 (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with distilled water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of CHCl3 by using a rotary evaporator afforded the crude products, which were then purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and hexane as the eluent (6:1, v/v) to obtain the products. Both C-DPP (139 mg, yield 90%) and Si-DPP (145 mg, yield 94%) are dark blue solids.

4.3 Device fabrication
Solar cell devices were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer (90–100 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (120 nm). The ITO-coated glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min. A ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air to complete the thin layer of ZnO (ca. 30 nm).The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate C4H6O4Zn·2(H2O) (99.5%, Merck 1 g) and monoethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 98% Acros, 0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 98%, 10 mL) under stirring for 8 h for hydrolysis reaction and aging. The active layer was spin-coated from the blend solution (30 mg mL−1 for 3D-DPPs:N2200, and 15 mg mL−1 for 3D-DPP:PC71BM). After spin-coating, the films were placed in a closed jar for slow drying of the solvent. Finally, MoO3 and Ag were thermally evaporated as the anode electrode at a pressure of <10−7 torr. The active area of each device was 3.14 mm2 defined by a shadow mask which was cut by a laser beam technique. All masked tests gave consistent results with relative errors within 1%. The photovoltaic performance was measured under nitrogen inside a glovebox. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-meter under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination which was accurately calibrated employing a standard Si photodiode detector equipped with a KG-5 filter, which can be traced back to the standard cell of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Devices were measured with shadow masking. The AM 1.5G illumination was simulated by using an Oriel 300 W Solar Simulator. The solar cell devices were fabricated and over 20 devices were measured for reliability of the device performance.
