    , Accepted 12th June 2019First published on 12th June 2019AbstractA novel near-infrared-light-absorbing fused-ring electron acceptor, STIC, was developed for organic solar cells. STIC exhibited a narrow bandgap with an absorption edge reaching 940 nm, which was ascribed to the strong electron-rich selenophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–selenophene (ST) unit and strong intramolecular charge transfer of STIC. Also, STIC-based devices showed low open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss values, attributed to the rigid ST core providing low reorganization energy. The device based on the PBDB-T:STIC blend exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.68% with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.96 mA cm−2 and a low Voc loss of 0.55 eV.
Investigations of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant advances recently due to their broad absorption of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light, easily adjustable energy levels, and tunable active layer crystallinity.1–8 Currently, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) constitute the most successful type of NFA, and are represented by the star molecule ITIC and its derivatives.2,9–13 FREAs show several distinct advantages over other types of acceptors. First, the A–D–A skeleton in the FREA molecular framework can induce a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) through effective π-electron delocalization, and thus FREAs show relatively small bandgaps. Second, the FREAs have good molecular coplanarity and strong intermolecular interactions, which can decrease molecular rotational disorder and reorganization energy, and thus contribute to high charge mobilities and low Voc loss in their OSCs. In addition, the solubility and film-forming properties of FREAs could be changed by changing the side chains. Consequently, these characteristics enable FREA-based solar cells to achieve high PCE levels.9–18 Many highly efficient FREAs have been reported, and the PCE of the state-of-the-art FREA-based device has already exceeded 15%,17,18 indicative of its great potential for commercial applications.
One of the most straightforward ways to increase the efficiency of an OSC is to increase its coverage of the solar spectrum to efficiently harvest photons for high photocurrents. Thus, it is highly desirable to design low-bandgap NFAs with broad absorption, to utilize the solar spectrum as well as possible. The simplest and most effective strategy to design narrow-bandgap acceptors is to either enhance the electron-donating ability of the central core in order to elevate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, or to enhance the accepting ability of the terminal unit in order to decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. Application of this strategy would result in an improved ICT and reduced bandgap. However, it is noteworthy that the development of low-bandgap NFAs is still lagging behind that of medium-bandgap (>1.5 eV) acceptors. Thus, it is very desirable to develop highly efficient narrow-bandgap FREAs for OSCs.
Recently, a thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–thiophene (4T)-based low-bandgap compound, 4TIC, was successfully developed by Jen et al.,19 and the results from a comprehensive study including this compound showed the low resonance stabilization energy of the central core of 4TIC to be an important contributor to the relatively high ICT effect of 4ITC and hence the positioning of its absorption edge towards the NIR. Based on this encouraging result, herein, we focussed on another interesting donor unit, selenophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–selenophene (ST), by replacing the outermost thiophene of 4T with selenophene, resulting in another narrow-bandgap NFA, denoted as STIC, as shown in Scheme 1. The replacement of the sulfur atom of 4T with a selenium atom to form ST was expected to endow STIC with several distinct properties, such as a relatively looser electron cloud delocalization of the selenium atom reducing orbital overlap with the adjacent π-system, resulting in decreased aromaticity/resonance energy of selenophene compared to that of thiophene. This property would then have favored the quinoid resonance character of STIC at the ground state and hence an enhanced ICT and reduced bandgap. Besides, the more polarizable selenium atom in STIC was also expected to yield enhanced intermolecular interactions and hence greater charge carrier mobility and improved solar cell performance.

As expected, the STIC sample exhibited a broadened optical absorption, from 600 to 900 nm with an onset at ∼940 nm, i.e., a red shift of ∼50 nm compared to that of 4TIC. A crystallographic analysis revealed similar molecular geometries and packing motifs for STIC and 4TIC, but with the terminal groups of STIC forming an intermolecular π–π stacking distance of ∼3.409 Å, even smaller than that of 4TIC (3.536 Å). Such tighter packing was expected to facilitate charge transport. When blended with the polymer donor PBDB-T, the resulting PBDB-T:STIC-based device showed a PCE of 9.68% with a high Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2, and a small Voc loss of 0.55 eV, comparable to those of 4TIC (PCE = 10.2%, Jsc = 19.13 mA cm−2, Voc loss = 0.58 eV).
The protocol used to synthesize the ST core and STIC was similar to that used for 4TIC,19 and is shown in Scheme 1. Diester 3 was obtained in high yield by coupling compounds 1 and 2 using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. Then diester 3 was reacted with nucleophilic (4-hexylphenyl) magnesium bromide in a 1:2 molar ratio, followed by carrying out the Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization using amberlyst 15 to afford the central core ST. Subsequently, the di-carbaldehyde monomer ST-CHO was prepared by performing the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of ST with POCl3 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Finally, the target STIC was synthesized in 90% yield by carrying out the Knoevenagel condensation between ST-CHO and excess 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) in the presence of β-alanine. Details of the procedures used to synthesize the target acceptor are provided in the ESI,† and all of the intermediates and the target acceptor were characterized using conventional NMR and mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S12 in the ESI†).
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of 4TIC and STIC recorded in a dichloromethane (DCM) solution and in a thin film are shown in Fig. 1a, and the related data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). In solution, STIC exhibited a strong absorption band spanning the wavelength range 600–850 nm with the maximum absorption at 768 nm, representing a red shift of ∼30 nm compared to that of 4TIC. In the thin film, the absorption of STIC was further red-shifted to the NIR region, with the absorption edge at ∼940 nm, in contrast to the 886 nm absorption edge for 4TIC. The energy levels of STIC and 4TIC were studied by taking cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the samples in DCM solution, as shown in Fig. 1b. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of STIC and 4TIC were calculated to −5.20/−3.91 and −5.28/−3.87 eV, respectively. The higher HOMO energy level of STIC compared to that of 4TIC was due to the stronger electron-donating ability of the ST unit. The lower LUMO energy level of STIC was attributed to the ability of the ST central core to induce a stronger ICT effect with its terminal IC groups. Consequently, the STIC sample showed a much narrower electronic bandgap (HOMO–LUMO gap) than did 4TIC (Table S2 in the ESI†).

To further understand the difference between the energy levels of 4TIC and those of STIC, the electron density distributions and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 4T, ST, 4TIC and STIC were determined by carrying out density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. These calculations indicated no significant effect of the exchange of chalcogen on the electron density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). However, this exchange was calculated to have a significant impact on their HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Specifically, ST was calculated to have a 0.024 eV higher HOMO level and a 0.038 eV lower LUMO level than was 4T. Similarly, STIC was calculated to have a 0.045 eV higher HOMO level and a 0.011 eV lower LUMO level than was 4TIC, and hence a narrower bandgap.
Single crystals of STIC suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained for investigating the geometry and packing behaviour of the molecule. Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plot (ORTEP) drawings and three-dimensional (3D) packing structures of STIC are presented in Fig. 2, and those of 4TIC are also shown for comparison. The π-frameworks of the two molecules were observed to be almost planar, with this planarity due to the rigidity of fused ST and 4T (Fig. 2, side-view). The high levels of planarity of STIC and 4TIC also benefited from the unique interaction between terminal IC group and central ST and 4T units. In particular, the terminal IC and central ST and 4T units interlocked via intimate [Se⋯O] interactions in STIC and [S⋯O] interactions in 4TIC (Fig. 2, top-view), resulting in essentially only one molecular conformation and the enhanced molecular planarity, except for the ability of the terminal IC to rotate freely about its single bond. No obvious intermolecular interactions were observed from the ST and 4T central cores, due to the four bulky hexylphenyl groups oriented almost perpendicularly to the backbone of the ST and 4T units. Instead, the terminal IC groups formed a close intermolecular π–π stacking, with a distance of ∼3.409 Å and 3.536 Å for STIC and 4TIC, respectively (Fig. 2, 3D packing). The shorter intermolecular π–π stacking distance in STIC was expected to not only enhance charge carrier mobility but also reduce non-radiative bimolecular recombination to result in a smaller Voc loss.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of STIC- and 4TIC-derived solar cells, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:STIC and 4TIC/C60-bissalt/Ag configurations, respectively, were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, the PBDB-T:STIC-based as-cast devices gave a moderate PCE of 7.94%. After the addition of 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the PCE significantly increased to 9.68%, with a Voc of 0.77 V, an impressive Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63. In comparison, STIC yielded a slightly higher Jsc than did 4TIC (19.13 mA cm−2) due to its red-shifted absorption. Moreover, STIC exhibited a lower Voc loss (0.55 eV) than did 4TIC (0.58 eV). The smaller Voc loss might have resulted from the lower reorganization energy of STIC. However, the Voc and FF of STIC were lower than those reported for 4TIC owing to its decreased LUMO energy level and different structural order and morphology of the BHJ blended films (vide infra).

The morphology of the BHJ film was expected to be optimized by adding DIO to facilitate charge transport. To prove this point, the electron mobilities of the blended films were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (shown in Fig. S14 and Table S3 in the ESI†).20,21 The as-cast PBDB-T:4TIC and PBDB-T:STIC devices exhibited electron mobility values as high as 4.19 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After the 0.5% DIO treatment, the electron mobility of the PBDB-T:STIC-based device significantly increased to 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, consistent with the tighter packing indicated from the single crystal data. Therefore, the higher Jsc and FF values were concluded to have derived from the improved charge mobility. The increased Jsc was also confirmed by acquiring their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Jsc values were calculated from the EQE curves similar to the Jsc values measured from the corresponding J–V curves.
To investigate the mechanism of carrier recombination in the STIC and 4TIC devices, the light intensity dependence of Jsc and that of Voc were determined. In general, the relationship between Jsc and incident light intensity (I) follows the power-law formula Jsc ∝ Iα, where a slope of the curve (α) approaching 1 implies negligible bimolecular recombination.22–24 As shown in Fig. S15a (ESI†), the α values of the STIC and 4TIC-based devices were determined to be 0.89 and 0.93, respectively, indicating less charge recombination loss during charge extraction in the 4TIC-based devices, further supporting its higher FF compared with that of PBDB-T:STIC. In addition, the slope of the dependence of Voc on the light intensity was determined to be 1.34 kT q−1 for the PBDB-T:4TIC-based device, and 1.41 kT q−1 for the PBDB-T:STIC-based device (Fig. S15b in ESI†), also indicating less trap-assisted recombination having occurred in the PBDB-T:4TIC-based devices.
The morphology of a BHJ film plays a vital role in determining its OSC performance.25,26 Thus, a systematic morphological study including of structural order and phase segregation was performed. Fig. S16a (ESI†) shows the acquired 2D grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) pattern of the pure STIC film, and the corresponding 1D line cuts are shown in Fig. S16b (ESI†). Related results for 4TIC were previously reported,19 and showed a mainly face-on orientation, with (100) diffraction at 0.46 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, corresponding to a distance of 1.36 nm, and a (010) peak at 1.84 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 0.34 nm. STIC showed a preferred edge-on orientation, with distinct (100) diffraction at 0.40 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak at 1.78 Å−1 in the in-plane direction. Although the replacement of thiophene with selenophene in STIC dramatically changed the molecular packing of the solid state, STIC was still crystalline, due to its strong intermolecular interactions and self-assembly capability.
In BHJ blends, PBDB-T diffraction dominated the 2D pattern (shown in Fig. 4a). A peak at 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and another at 1.71 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction were observed, and were, respectively, (100) diffraction and (010) diffraction from PBDB-T, similar to those previously reported.27 The fitting results of the (010) diffraction are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The addition of DIO promoted a better structure, with a closer packing, and changes in the crystal size and crystallinity, as indicated by the observed changes in d-spacing, crystal coherence length and peak area for both blends. These results helped explain the significantly improved device performance, especially Jsc and FF, resulting from the addition of DIO. STIC blends were shown to be more crystalline. In the 4TIC blends, the polymer showed a smaller packing distance. This result was expected to facilitate electron hopping, and hence helped explain the high FF of 4TIC.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) at 285 eV was used to study the length scales of phase separation of the blended films, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4c. A broad and elevated hump from 0.02 Å−1 to 0.008 Å−1 was observed, indicating a quite broad distribution of phase separation length scales. To derive the average domain size, curves of Iq2versus q were plotted, as shown in Fig. S16c (ESI†). While PBDB-T:4TIC showed center-to-center distances of 48.5 nm and 57.2 nm for the as cast and DIO-modified blends, PBDB-T:STIC displayed center-to-center distances of 48.3 nm and 58.2 nm, respectively. Increased domain size not only benefited carrier transport but also did not hamper exciton splitting within this scale, and therefore contributed to the improved Jsc and FF. The STIC blends exhibited a stronger scattering intensity due to the incorporation of Se atoms having changed the intermolecular interaction with polymers, causing worse miscibility and the formation of two relatively pure phases, with more contrast. The purer phase region was conducive for carrier transport; thus STIC showed higher electron mobility.
In summary, a novel electron-rich central building block ST and a derivative NIR-light-absorbing acceptor STIC were successfully developed for OSCs. The structure of STIC was shown to be similar to that previously reported for 4TIC, with the major difference being just the replacement of the outermost thiophene in 4T with selenophene. The results from the study of single crystals revealed a smaller intermolecular π–π stacking distance for STIC than for 4TIC, resulting in increased electron mobility. In addition, STIC showed stronger absorption of NIR light with a bandgap of 1.32 eV, narrower than that of 4TIC (1.40 eV), and beneficial for achieving a high Jsc in OSCs. And indeed, the PBDB-T:STIC-based device exhibited a higher Jsc of 19.96 mA cm−2 along with a smaller Voc loss (0.55 eV). Our results demonstrated that ST is an effective building block for constructing NIR-light-absorbing NFAs for efficient OSCs.
