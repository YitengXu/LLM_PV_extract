    , Accepted 2nd January 2019First published on 3rd January 2019AbstractType-II van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are considered as a class of competitive candidates of high-efficiency photovoltaic materials, due to their spontaneous electron–hole separation. However, most of the vdW heterostructures possess an indirect gap and a large band offset, which would lead to low photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. Taking an SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure as an illustrative example, we propose interlayer compression and vertical electric field application as two effective strategies to modulate the electronic and photovoltaic properties of type-II vdW heterostructures. Our results reveal that a lattice-matched SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure has an indirect band gap of 1.34 eV with the conduction band minimum (CBM) at the Γ point and the valence band maximum (VBM) between the Γ and M points. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an SbI3/BiI3-based excitonic solar cell (XSC) is predicted to be about 14.42%. When compressing the heterostructure along the vdW gap direction, the highest valence band state at the Γ point is lifted significantly and the VBM gradually approaches the Γ point, implying an indirect–direct gap transition. This interesting evolution can be attributed to the increasing k-dependent electronic hybridization of the pz orbitals of interlayer adjacent I atoms with a reduced interlayer distance. Moreover, the interlayer compression also enhances the PCE of the system monotonically. When applying a vertical electric field, the band alignment of the heterostructure undergoes a transition from type-II to type-I and then returns to type-II between 0.1 and 0.6 V Å−1. Meanwhile, the PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC could be enhanced up to 21.63%. This work provides guidance for improving the electronic and photovoltaic properties of type-II vdW heterostructures.
1 Introduction
To meet the increasing energy demand and control CO2 concentrations, seeking alternative carbon-free energy sources to fossil fuels has attracted a lot of attention during the past years.1,2 Solar energy is regarded as one of the most promising candidates among various renewable energy resources. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the most widely-used silicon-based solar cell approaches its theoretical limit (29.1%).3 It is thus necessary to explore novel energy materials.
Recently, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures4 stacking with versatile 2D semiconductors have been considered as a class of competitive candidates for future high-efficiency optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.5–10 In particular, in a vdW heterostructure with type-II band alignment, photon-excited electron–hole pairs could be spontaneously separated and localized in its different constituents due to its staggered band alignment, which leads to fast charge transfer and reduction of carrier recombination.11 Moreover, the heterostructure takes advantage of the excellent physical properties of 2D materials such as ultrahigh specific surface area, which further enhances its photovoltaic performance.12,13 Experimental studies on a MoS2/WSe2 type-II vdW heterostructure show that the heterojunction area presents strong photo-response and electron transfer from WSe2 to MoS2 takes only 440 fs.14–16
Group-VA trihalides AI3 (A = As, Sb and Bi) constitute a class of potential photovoltaic materials. Previous theoretical investigations have revealed that exfoliated AI3 single layers from layered compounds possess suitable band gaps, tunable band edges and moderate carrier mobilities.17–19 An AsI3/SbI3 type-II vdW heterostructure is further proposed for high efficiency excitonic solar cells (XSCs) with theoretical power conversion efficiencies up to 18%.20 Experimentally, several BiI3-based vdW heterostructures such as WSe2/BiI3 nanoplates and graphene/BiI3 films have been demonstrated, and their photo-responsivities have been found to be comparable to those of many other 2D vdW heterostructures.21,22 It is thus interesting to investigate other AI3-based vdW heterostructures such as SbI3/BiI3 and explore their potential photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Moreover, since SbI3/BiI3 constitutes two compounds with the same crystal structure and similar chemical compositions, it is thus easy to synthesize through vdW epitaxial growths. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that AI3-based vdW heterostructures were predicted to possess an indirect gap, which would lead to weak absorption of solar light. In addition, the band offset is known to be responsible for the PCE of heterostructure-based excitonic solar cells. To further improve the performance of devices based on these heterostructures, it is thus crucial to modulate their electronic properties and band offsets rationally.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the stability and electronic structure of an SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure and evaluate the PCE of an SbI3/BiI3-based excitonic solar cell. Moreover, we propose that interlayer compression and external electric field application tune its electronic structure. Our results reveal that the SbI3 and BiI3 single layers could be constructed into a lattice-matched vdW heterostructure with type-II band alignment. The highest valence band state near the Γ point is lifted due to the strong interlayer coupling. While compressing the heterostructure along the z direction, the enhanced interlayer electronic hybridization further pushes up the highest valence band state at the Γ point, leading to an indirect–(quasi)direct gap transition and a monotonic enhancement of PCE. In the application of a vertical external electric field, the band alignment of the heterostructure maintains the type-II alignment under a negative electric field, but experiences a transition from type-II to type-I and then to type-II under a positive electric field, in which the PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC could be tuned from 14.42% up to 21.63%.
2 Computational details
The density functional theory calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code23,24 using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method25,26 and the general gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) implementation.27 To better estimate the interlayer distance and adsorption energy, the optB88-vdW functional28,29 is used to optimize the heterostructure and the single-layers, and has been successfully adopted to describe various layered materials and interface systems.30,31 Our previous study revealed that the spin orbital coupling (SOC) effect dominates the electronic structure of group-VA trihalides AI3.20 Hence, the electronic structure calculations with the SOC effect are performed for SbI3/BiI3. A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff of 500 eV is used in all calculations. A slab model with a vacuum space of at least 20 Å was used in the calculation. Γ-Centered K-points with 6 × 6 × 1 meshes generated by the Monkhorst–Pack32 scheme are used for geometry optimization of SbI3/BiI3. 12 × 12 × 1 k-meshes are adopted for density of states calculations. The lattice constant of the heterostructure is fixed at that of a BiI3 monolayer, and only atomic coordinates along the z direction are relaxed until the maximum force of all atoms is less than 0.01 eV Å−1. To apply a vertical external electric field in SbI3/BiI3, a dipole sheet parallel to the z direction is added in the unit cell.33 The charge transfer analysis is based on the Bader method.34
In addition, on the basis of the method developed by Scharber et al.,35,36 the PCE η of the SbI3/BiI3 excitonic solar cell (XSC) is obtained by the following formula:  
The integral in the denominator represents the total incident solar radiation. P(ħω)is the AM1.5 solar energy flux in units of W m−2 eV−1 and ħω is the photon energy. In the numerator, 0.65 is the fill factor and the integral denotes the short circuit current under the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency. The term (Edg − ΔEc − 0.3) is the maximum open circuit voltage, in which Edg is the band gap of the donor and ΔEc is the conduction band offset (CBO).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometry and electronic structure
Group-VA triiodide AI3 (A = As, Sb and Bi) monolayers possess a honeycomb-like lattice and consist of three atomic layers (I–A–I). The lattice mismatch between single-layer SbI3 and BiI3 is about 1.8% in the optB88-vdW functional,18,20 which is comparable with that of a graphene/h-BN heterostructure (1.9% in the GGA)37 and much smaller than the value of MoS2/MoSe2 (4.4%).38 The (1 × 1) lattice-matched model is used in the calculation, in which the SbI3 monolayer is stacked on the BiI3 monolayer and the lattice constant of the BiI3 single-layer (7.59 Å) is used. As shown in Fig. 1, four high-symmetry stacking configurations, named AA, AB, AA′ and AB′, have been considered. In the AA and AA′ (AB and AB′) configurations, the BiI3 layer is eclipsed (staggered) by the SbI3 layer, and the IB of SbI3 is placed above the IB (IT) of BiI3 for AA and AB (AA′ and AB′). As shown in Table 1, the AA and AB configurations are more energetically favourable than the AA′ and AB′ configurations. Among these four configurations, the AB stacking is the most stable with the smallest interlayer distance of 3.33 Å. Moreover, the adsorption energies of BiI3/SbI3 are much higher than those of graphene/h-BN (62 to 83 meV) and MoS2/MoSe2 (118 to 195 meV),37,38 implying a strong interlayer interaction.

It is known that a 2D vdW heterostructure tends to form a moiré pattern because of weak interlayer vdW binding.37,38 However, the strong interlayer interaction predicted above might raise the question whether the lattice-matched structure could occur in the SbI3/BiI3 vertical heterostructure. Following Kang et al.'s work,38 we calculate six stacking configurations with a relatively high symmetry for each pattern (AI to AVI and BI to BVI), as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), which are used to represent two possible SbI3/BiI3 moiré structures. From the energy point of view, the formation of a moiré pattern must satisfy that the strain energy induced by the lattice match must be larger than the formation energy of the moiré pattern, which is defined by Emax − Eaver, where Emax is the adsorption energy of the most stable stacking configuration and Eaver is the average adsorption energy of representative stacking configurations in the moiré pattern. The adsorption energies and interlayer distances of these twelve configurations after relaxation are listed in Table 2. For patterns A and B, the formation energies of moiré patterns are 102 meV and 97 meV, which are almost 7 times larger than the strain energy (15 meV) cost to stretched SbI3. Therefore, a lattice-matched SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure could be feasible.

To reveal the underlying mechanism of the strong interlayer binding of the vdW heterostructure, we analyze the charge transfer between monolayers for the AB and AB′ configurations. The xy-plane averaged charge density difference Δρ along the z direction is defined as:  where ρ(x,y,z), ρSbI3(x,y,z) and ρBiI3(x,y,z) are the charge densities of the heterostructure and the SbI3 and BiI3 monolayers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, considerable charge accumulation can be found between the monolayers, especially for AB stacking, implying strong covalent-like interlayer binding in the heterostructure. In addition, we can also find that each IB atom at SbI3 binds with three nearest-neighbor I atoms at BiI3 in the case of the AB configuration but only one I atom in AB′. This makes the close-packed AB stacking become more stable.

The green and red dashed lines represent SbI3 and BiI3, respectively. The isovalue is 0.00015 e Bohr−3, and the yellow and blue colors represent gaining and losing electrons. 
According to our previous works of free-standing SbI3 and BiI3 single layers,18,20 the band alignment of SbI3/BiI3 is expected to be staggered, which is beneficial to the separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs. The SbI3 and BiI3 act as the donor and acceptor in the heterostructure, respectively. We also present the detailed electronic band structure of free-standing BiI3 and stretched SbI3 single-layers in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The corresponding band gaps are about 1.56 and 1.81 eV, respectively. After stretching SbI3 to fit the lattice of BiI3, the absolute band edges of SbI3 move downwards slightly from −4.135 and −5.980 eV to −4.228 and −6.046 eV, but this does not change the role of SbI3 as a donor in SbI3/BiI3.
Here, we focus on the electronic structure of the most stable AB configuration. As shown in Fig. 3a, the heterostructure possesses type-II band alignment and its indirect band gap is reduced to 1.34 eV, which is larger than those of MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te)/black phosphorene.7 The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the heterostructure lies at the Γ point, and the valence band maximum (VBM) is located between the Γ and M points. The CBM is contributed by BiI3, while a strong interlayer electronic coupling can be found in the valence bands, especially the states near the highest valence band at the Γ point. The charge density distribution as shown in Fig. 3b also indicates that the electrons and holes are confined in the BiI3 and SbI3, respectively. This suggests that the electrons and holes can be separated spontaneously, which benefits potential photovoltaic applications. The Bader charge analysis reveals that 0.0034 electron is transferred from SbI3 to BiI3, which forms a built-in electric field pointing from SbI3 and BiI3.

Δd = d − d0, where d is the interlayer distance between monolayers and d0 is the equilibrium distance. The contributions from SbI3 and BiI3 are denoted by green and orange colors, respectively. The charge densities of the VBM and CBM of the heterostructure under an equilibrium state with an isovalue of 0.0006 e Bohr−3 (b). 
The projected band structures of both monolayers are also adopted to estimate the band edges and the offset of the heterostructure. It should be noted that the band offset of a three-dimensional semiconductor heterojunction is usually estimated by the Anderson rule, which is not suitable for a 2D vdW heterostructure with strong interlayer coupling.39 According to the quantum-mechanical criterion for the band edge of a vdW interface proposed by Koda et al.,39,40 the band edge is assigned to the constituent where the probability of finding a carrier is maximum. For equilibrium AB stacking, the estimated Edg and ΔEc values are 1.748 and 0.406 eV, respectively. The PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC evaluated using the method developed by Scharber et al.35,36 is 14.28%, which is larger than those of MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te)/black phosphorene.6
3.2 Applying interlayer compression
To understand the change in the energy band during stacking, we also present the energy band structures of vdW heterostructures with different interlayer distances. We can find clearly that the CBM always remains at the Γ point and the highest valence band state at the Γ point is lifted significantly with reduced interlayer distance. ΔEVG defined by the energy difference between the VBM and the highest valence band state at the Γ point of the equilibrium structure is 36 meV, which is much smaller than that of a stretched state with Δd = 1 Å (191 meV) (Fig. 3c). This indicates that the VBM approaches the Γ point, which also implies that the interlayer compression should be an efficient strategy to tune the energy band.
When the heterostructure is further compressed along the z direction, the ΔEVG value gradually decreases as shown in Fig. 4a. When the Δd decreases to −0.5 Å, ΔEVG becomes negligible and the VBM approaches the Γ point, leading to an indirect–(quasi)direct gap transition as shown in Fig. 3d. The species-resolved projected density of states (Fig. 5) indicates that the 3p orbitals of the interlayer neighbouring I atoms (IB of SbI3 and IT of BiI3) gradually dominate the states near the VBM. By contrast, the CBM of the heterostructure is still dominated by the p states of group-VA atoms. Since the Bi and Sb atomic planes are located at the center of the single-layer, they are far away from each other and the nearby I atoms also provide a strong screening. This results in the insensitivity of the CBM to interlayer compression. As shown in Fig. 4, the position of the valence band edge moves upwards, while the position of the conduction band edge remains almost invariant with the decrease of interlayer distance. This distinct response between the CBM and VBM on interlayer compression also leads to band gap reduction. It is noticed that the CBO reduces with interlayer compression, which is caused by the enhancement of charge transfer between monolayers (Fig. 4a and b). The PCE is known to be mainly related to the Edg and ΔEc, whose reduction could enhance PCE.41–43 With Δd changing from −0.1 to −0.3 Å, the Edg and ΔEc gradually decrease. As a result, the PCE increases, as shown in Fig. 4a. It should be pointed out that the type-II band alignment of SbI3/BiI3 may be violated as the interlayer distance decreases. When the Δd ranges from −0.1 to −0.3 Å, the contribution of SbI3 to the valence band edge of the heterostructure is larger than 70%, which means that the holes are most likely to gather in the SbI3 and the heterostructure could maintain the type-II band alignment.

ΔQ is defined as ΔQ = Qa − Qb, in which Qa and Qb represent the charges after and before forming the heterostructure, respectively. 
 Fig. 5  The layer- and atom-projected densities of states of SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructures with Δd = 1 (a), 0 (b) and −0.5 Å (c). 
In order to investigate the variance mechanism of valence band states, we further analyse the atom- and orbital-projected energy bands of vdW heterostructures with different interlayer distances. The corresponding results for free-standing monolayers are also given for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6a, the VBM of both single layers is composed mainly of px and py orbitals. The highest valence band state at the Γ point is dominated by pz orbitals in SbI3, while the px and py orbitals contribute largely in BiI3. The valence band states of the single layers are two-fold degenerate due to the present inversion symmetry. When the two single layers come close, the stacking breaks the inversion symmetry of the system, inducing valence band spin splitting. However, the energy levels at the time-reversal-invariant Γ and M points remain doubly degenerate due to the protection of time reversal symmetry in the present non-magnetic system. A similar phenomenon was also found in silicene and germanene on a substrate.44 As the interlayer distance decreases, the interlayer I(pz) states near the VBM increase and the relative contribution of the px and py orbitals decreases gradually (Fig. S4a–h, ESI†). According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, the pz orbitals of interlayer adjacent I atoms could react more easily than other orbitals. The overlapping pz orbitals of interlayer adjacent I atoms will recombine to form low-energy bonding and high-energy anti-bonding states. Since all pz orbitals are occupied, the highest valence band states at the Γ point, which are expected to be the anti-bonding states, are thus lifted significantly (Fig. 6b–e).

3.3 Applying a vertical electric field
In addition to interlayer compression, applying a perpendicular electric field is another effective way to tune the electronic and photovoltaic properties of vdW heterostructures, which has been evidenced to control carrier transfer,12 band alignment45 and the Schottky barrier height46 of vdW heterostructures successfully. We next study the effect of an external electric field (Eext) on the electronic structure and the PCE of an SbI3/BiI3 XSC. The electric field direction pointing from SbI3 to BiI3 is considered as the positive direction. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the energy bands of SbI3 move upwards with respect to BiI3 as the strength of negative Eext increases, which leads to band gap reduction and an increase in band offsets. As a result, the PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC decreases linearly, though the variation of Edg is small (Fig. 7a and b). However, the relative movement of the energy bands of the monolayers is opposite when positive Eext is applied. Because the VBO is smaller than the CBO shown above, BiI3 will replace SbI3 as the dominated constituent of the valence band edge. Then BiI3 is lifted over SbI3 at the conduction band edge. Therefore, the band alignment of SbI3/BiI3 undergoes a transition from type-II to type-I and then to type-II as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The donor of the heterostructure is changed to BiI3 in the final type-II band alignment. The CBO has a minimum value of 0.046 eV at 0.4 V Å−1, and the corresponding PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC achieves a maximum value as high as 21.63%, which is comparable with that of a hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cell (22.1%).47 Furthermore, the states near the VBM of both SbI3 and BiI3 monolayers are gradually dominated by the corresponding IB(p) (IT(p)) orbitals under positive (negative) Eext (Fig. 8 and 9).

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the stability and electronic structure of an SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure and evaluated the PCE of an SbI3/BiI3 XSC. Vertical compression and external electric field application are proposed as two effective ways to modulate its electronic and photovoltaic properties. Our results suggest that the SbI3 and BiI3 monolayers could be constructed into a lattice matched vdW heterostructure with type-II band alignment and an indirect band gap. The strong interlayer coupling pushes up the highest valence band state at the Γ point. Upon vertical compression, the heterostructure undergoes an indirect–(quasi)direct band gap transition. Moreover, the band alignment of the heterostructure experiences a transition from type-II to type-I and then to type-II under a positive electric field from 0.1 to 0.6 V Å−1. Furthermore, the PCE of the SbI3/BiI3 XSC could be tuned from 14.42% up to 21.63% under the positive electric field. The present study gives a full understanding of the electronic and photovoltaic properties of SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructures under compression and an electric field, which will be helpful to improve the power conversion efficiency of type-II vdW heterostructures with an indirect band gap.

 	Fig. 2  The plane-averaged charge density difference along the z direction and the isosurface of interlayer charge density difference for the AB (a) and AB′ (b) configurations. The green and red dashed lines represent SbI3 and BiI3, respectively. The isovalue is 0.00015 e Bohr−3, and the yellow and blue colors represent gaining and losing electrons.	 

 	Fig. 3  The layer-projected band structure of an SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure with Δd = 0 (a), 1 (c) and −0.5 Å (d). Δd = d − d0, where d is the interlayer distance between monolayers and d0 is the equilibrium distance. The contributions from SbI3 and BiI3 are denoted by green and orange colors, respectively. The charge densities of the VBM and CBM of the heterostructure under an equilibrium state with an isovalue of 0.0006 e Bohr−3 (b).	 

 	Fig. 4  The band edge, band gap and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructure as a function of Δd (a), and the corresponding charge transfer ΔQ (b). ΔQ is defined as ΔQ = Qa − Qb, in which Qa and Qb represent the charges after and before forming the heterostructure, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  The layer- and atom-projected densities of states of SbI3/BiI3 vdW heterostructures with Δd = 1 (a), 0 (b) and −0.5 Å (c).
