    , Accepted 7th April 2013First published on 9th April 2013AbstractThe thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole fused (bi)heterocycle is an electron deficient system with high oxidative stability and a rigid planar structure, enabling efficient intermolecular π–π overlap. The parent thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole moiety hence already possesses some appealing features towards applications in organic electronics. Moreover, aryl-functionalized thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole derivatives – expanding the conjugated backbone of the semiconducting material – are easily prepared. Surprisingly, interest in thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based materials has been rather low, until quite recently, when the high potential of these molecules was widely recognized, notably in the field of organic photovoltaics. Despite the almost exponential growth of activity, the synthetic chemistry behind these molecules has only been explored to a minor extent and there is plenty of room for improvement and broadening of the material scope. In this review, an overview of the currently available synthetic methods and the range of materials prepared to date, together with their basic material properties and main applications, is provided, with the aim to facilitate and stimulate further progress in thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based materials science.
1 Introduction
The majority of organic semiconducting materials reported and employed to date contains (one or more, sometimes fused) thiophene entities, taking benefit from the electron donating power of the heterocycle. One of the main drawbacks of thiophene-based systems is their sensitivity towards oxidation. By substituting one carbon by a nitrogen atom, a thiazole ring is obtained, which is more electron deficient and therefore more resistant to oxygen. In the early 60's, a new bicyclic system based on the thiazole ring was discovered, i.e. the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz). This fused heteroaromatic system has recently become subject of several studies in the field of organic electronics, in which its electronic characteristics are highly appreciated, with a particularly strong emphasis on organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In the last decade, the number of publications based on TzTz-type materials has increased almost exponentially (Fig. 1). For these applications, the TzTz is either incorporated into polymer structures or employed as a building block towards small molecules. Its main advantage is the higher oxidative stability compared to its thiophene analogues. Additionally, strong π–π stacking and overlapping of the orbitals in the solid state affords high electron and hole mobilities, which are crucial properties for efficient charge transfer in optoelectronic applications.1,2

To date, most synthetic procedures towards TzTz-based materials are still based on the pioneering work done by Ketcham et al.3 However, the ‘classical’ route does not allow to achieve high yields and is associated with troublesome isolation and purification protocols. A few attempts were made to improve the preparation process, but most of them are nowadays not being used.
In the present review, an overview of the state-of-the-art of TzTz-based materials is provided, including the reported synthetic protocols affording TzTz derivatives (small molecules, polymers, and metal complexes), their structural and electronic characteristics, and main applications in organic photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). As such, this overview can be employed as a springboard for scientists active in one of these domains, fostering further progress in TzTz-based material design and applications.
2 Material synthesis
2.1. The parent TzTz heterocycle – small molecules
The thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole heterocyclic system was initially discovered in 1960 by Ketcham, who was studying the reaction between dithiooxamide (or rubeanic acid) (1) and aromatic aldehydes (Scheme 1).3 Crystalline products were obtained, which were first thought to be 2,2′-diaryl-4,4′-bithiazetines (3′).4 Extensive study and analysis of the reaction products using elemental analysis, IR, UV-VIS, and other methods showed that the correct structures were actually 2,5-diarylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles 3, which are thermodynamically favoured over the bithiazetines.
 Scheme 1  Classical synthesis of 2,5-diaryl-substituted TzTz's. 
After this initial discovery of the novel biheterocycle, the biological activity of several 2,5-diarylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles (Ar = phenyl, naphthyl, thienyl, indolyl or quinolyl) was tested. In an extensive study for anti-viral/amebicidal activity and against various strains of bacteria, these molecules did not show significant effects, apart from a 20% increase in body cholesterol when administered to rats and highly selective effects on the central nervous system, manifested almost purely by the induction of sleep.5 Similar results were obtained by Ketcham and Mah, who found that certain TzTz derivatives prolongue barbiturate sleeping time and decrease locomotor activity. However, relatively high toxicity was associated with most of these compounds, with LD50 values only just above 0.5 g/Kg.6
The classical Ketcham reaction proceeds at high temperature without any solvent (Scheme 1).3 The first step involves a two-fold condensation reaction with the elimination of water, often seen as sputtering. In the next step, ring closure occurs, followed by oxidation to form the TzTz fused aromatic system. 2,5-Diaryl-substituted TzTz systems have a rather poor solubility, unless long alkyl chains are attached to the aromatic rings, so they readily precipitate from the reaction mixture.
Upon checking TzTz literature, it becomes immediately clear that the vast majority of published synthetic procedures are still based on the classical procedure as discovered by Ketcham.7 Reactions between dithiooxamide and (hetero)aromatic aldehydes have been carried out in different solvents, e.g. phenol and nitromethane, but most often DMF, or without any solvent. The vigorous conditions required, i.e. heating up to 200 °C, often led to black reaction mixtures with tarry by-products, decreasing the yields considerably to an average of around 50% and creating problems for up-scaling. Among some other disadvantages, there is also a limitation for the reaction to (hetero)aromatic aldehydes. Condensation products with aliphatic aldehydes were not reported yet. The limited scope and strong conditions applied for a rather simple two-step condensation and oxidation process should open many possibilities for improving the reaction. The unsubstituted ‘parent’ TzTz system cannot be prepared in one single step. It was done in two steps starting from 2,5-difuryl-TzTz 4, which was oxidized to dicarboxylic acid 5 and further decarboxylated to afford the unsubstituted thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (6) (Scheme 2).6,8
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of parent TzTz system 6. 
Over the years, a number of alternative approaches to prepare TzTz derivatives via simpler and more efficient routes have been introduced, although they have found limited use. The first procedure was reported by Seybold and Eilingsfeld in 1979, who synthesized a series of bicyclic systems, of which one was a TzTz material.9 They started from 2,5-bis(acetylamino)thiazole (7) which was treated with sodium thiocyanate in the presence of bromine to prepare thiocyanatothiazole 8. This was then further cyclized by a thermal treatment in methyl benzoate at 160 °C, affording the corresponding TzTz 9 in 60% yield (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of TzTz 9. 
A completely different approach was used by Valle et al.10 In continuation of their study on the reactivity of alkyl isocyanates towards compounds carrying an S–Cl group, they attempted the synthesis of 5,5′-diethyloxy-2,2′-bis(oxazolyl)disulphide (10) starting from ethyl isocyanoacetate (11) and dichlorodisulphane in the presence of triethylamine (Scheme 4). Instead of the expected product, TzTz 12 was isolated as colourless needles in 52% yield. This procedure enables preparation of thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-dicarboxylates 12 in a much more convenient way than the standard one via a tedious multi-step procedure starting from furfural and dithiooxamide. An extension to this procedure was published a few years later by Rössler and Boldt, who started from ethyl thioisocyanatoacetate (13) and used chlorine as the chlorinating agent.11 They reported a simplified synthetic protocol affording a similar yield of 49% (Scheme 5).
 Scheme 4  Unusual one-pot synthesis of ethyl thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-dicarboxylate 12. 
 Scheme 5  Improved synthesis of TzTz 12 starting from a thioisocyanatoacetate. 
Among the stepwise protocols reported so far, the procedure by Hansen and Liebich looks particularly interesting (Scheme 6).12 The starting compounds N,N′-bis(dialkylaminobenzyl)-dithiooxamides 14 and phenylisothiocyanate (15) are heated under milder conditions in either acetone or diglyme. Using this protocol, the authors reported a significant improvement in the yields for the synthesis of diaryl-TzTz's 3, ranging from 65–90%. The products were purified by simple recrystallization. Surprisingly enough, this method has not been applied by other people ever since.
 Scheme 6  Alternative procedure towards aryl-substituted TzTz's 3. 
Another synthetic approach involves closing of one thiazole ring at a time, which enables preparation of asymmetrically substituted TzTz's.13 Reaction between 5-amino-2-aryl-4-mercaptothiazoles 16 and orthoesters 17 in boiling alcohols with an acid catalyst for several hours furnished diaryl-TzTz's 3 in 40–75% yields (Scheme 7). Similar procedures using aldehydes instead of orthoesters (in refluxing toluene) were also used to afford TzTz compounds in 50–60% yields.14 Another patent from the same authors describes cyclization of 2-aryl-5-(benzylidenamino)-4-thiazolethiols 18 in high boiling solvents such as nitrobenzene, DMF or diethylene glycol to afford diaryl-TzTz products 3 in 86–96% yield (Scheme 8).15

Although the classical method is clearly most often employed, there seems to be plenty of options for increasing yields and enable easier processing, either by optimizing the condensation/oxidation steps or by adapting stepwise protocols (e.g. based on Scheme 6).
2.2. Extension of the TzTz chromophore
Extension of the TzTz chromophore, in particular with additional aromatic rings, is a very efficient way to extend the conjugation length (shifting the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths) and change the charge mobility features. There are two main synthetic methods that have been employed to achieve this. One of them is based on Ketcham's method and uses the corresponding extended aldehydes to build the TzTz system (Scheme 9, Path A).16 In the second method (Scheme 9, Path B), the extension of the TzTz core is achieved by Pd-catalyzed cross coupling reactions, e.g. Suzuki or Stille.17,18

2.3. TzTz-based polymers
In the greater part of recent publications, the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole system is introduced in a semiconducting polymer structure. Some of these polymers have afforded improved solar cell efficiencies as well as increased polymer stability in bulk heterojunction blends,2 both key factors for the successful commercialization of organic solar cells. The TzTz is incorporated into the polymer backbone in either homopolymer or copolymer configurations. To lower the optical bandgap of the copolymers and broaden the absorption window, donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymers are often pursued. In these cases, the TzTz acts as the acceptor part, and is combined with electron rich donor units such as 4H-cylopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT), benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), or other similar mostly thiophene-based moieties. As solubility is of high importance for the processability of such polymers, the heterocyclic building blocks are generally substituted with long linear or branched alkyl chains.
For the preparation of TzTz-based polymers, various polycondensation reactions have been used, such as palladium-catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, and oxidative polymerization reactions employing iron(III) chloride. The first syntheses of TzTz-containing polymers were based on simple polycondensation methods, resulting in polyesters, polycarbonates, etc.,19,20 whereas Stille and Suzuki reactions were almost exclusively used for the preparation of polymers for optoelectronic applications.
An interesting polymerization approach was reported by Belfield et al. in 2005.21 They prepared alternating fluorene-TzTz copolymers 20 by a simple polycondensation reaction between fluorene-dicarbaldehyde 21 and dithiooxamide, in 59% yield (Scheme 10). Unfortunately, no data on the molecular weight of the obtained polymer were reported.

The first successful Suzuki polycondensation reaction resulting in a TzTz-containing polymer was also performed in 2005. Using standard Suzuki conditions, fluorenes 22 and 23 were coupled to TzTz 24 in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) catalyst to prepare different copolymers 25a–e (Mw = 8–32 kDa) (Scheme 11).22 On the other hand, McCullough and co-workers synthesized thiophene-TzTz copolymers 28 and 30 using Stille cross-coupling reactions, catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3-P(o-Tolyl)3 (Scheme 12).2a

A different polymerization approach was used by Wudl et al., who prepared rather simple polymers 32a,b consisting of alkylthiophenes and TzTz units by oxidative polymerization in moderate yields between 30 and 60% (Scheme 13).1 The molecular weights of the obtained polymers were very high, in the range of 1–4 × 106, and the materials exhibited strong fluorescence in solution.

All successive publications using TzTz-based conjugated polymers have used palladium-catalyzed polycondensation reactions, due to the excellent regiocontrol and high purity of the obtained polymers, both of great importance for achieving good results in optoelectronic applications.
2.4. Metal complexes
The presence of S and N heteroatoms in the TzTz structure allows construction of coordinative compounds and several examples of this have been reported. The first ones were prepared in 2004 by Steel and co-workers.23 They prepared diastereomeric dinuclear ruthenium (Ru) complexes of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (33) as well as a copper (Cu) complex 34 (Fig. 2). The Cu complex was prepared simply by adding a methanolic solution of copper(II) nitrate to a solution of the TzTz derivative. Green plates precipitated after two days. On the other hand, the Ru complex 35 was prepared by refluxing the same TzTz ligand with [Ru(bpy)2Cl2].xH2O in a mixture of ethanol and water for two days and it was isolated as red crystals. Both complexes, including the isolated diastereomeric form, were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis. It was shown that the metal atom is bonded coordinatively between the two nitrogen atoms of the thiazole and pyridine rings, which are almost coplanar (dihedral angle 4.9°). The complexes exhibited a rather low bandgap, in the range between 2.00–2.06 V, as well as weak metal–metal interactions.

Similar complexes involving the nitrogen atoms of the TzTz core and the attached aromatic moiety were prepared by Zhang et al. using boron as the central atom (Scheme 14).24 After lithiation of 2,5-bis(2-bromophenyl)-TzTz's 36 and subsequent reaction with triphenylborane or dimesitylfluoroborane, a series of diboron ladder compounds 37–40 was obtained. In these complexes, boron is covalently attached to the phenyl ring and via a coordinative bond to the nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Single-crystal X-ray structure of boron ladder complex 39 (Reproduced based upon the data in the CCDC database). 
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of boron ladder complexes 37–40 and 42–45. 
In another publication from the same group, similar complexes 42–45 were prepared (Scheme 14).25 In this case, the boron atom was connected to the phenyl ring via a hydroxyl bridge. Such ladder type structures give good thermal stability to the complexes, accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields and strong electron affinities.
Another type of complexes has been created based on TzTz-dicarboxylic acid 5. Both the groups of Maspero and Wudl used this precursor to prepare a series of different metal complexes (Fig. 4).26,27 Using standard conditions, complexes with Mg, Ca, Sr, Co, Cu, and Zn were formed as 1-dimensional coordination polymers, in which the first oxygen atom of the carboxylic group is attached to the metal, while the second oxygen atom from another TzTz molecule is attached axially. Ba atoms form a 2-dimensional network, based on a face- and edge-sharing Ba polyhedral. One carboxylate oxygen atom and water molecules act as bridges between each Ba and its three neighbouring atoms. Ag atoms form more complex 3-D networks, in which each Ag atom is connected to five different atoms, thus forming a framework without cavities capable of hosting water molecules. Since the ligand contains two carboxylic acid groups, it can easily be decarboxylated at temperatures around 70 °C. The metal complexes are much more stable, up to about 150 °C, when water elimination usually starts.

3. Structural and electronic characteristics
3.1. Crystal structures
As mentioned before, the correct structures of the products obtained from the reaction between aromatic aldehydes and dithiooxamide were determined only after a detailed study using spectroscopic methods by Ketcham in 1960.3 For the first X-ray confirmation of the TzTz structure, it took a few more years until Porzio et al. obtained suitable single crystals of the parent thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (6) in 1987 (Fig. 5).28 X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the condensed rings lie around an inversion centre in the middle of the C–C bond and within one plane, with a maximum displacement of just 0.002 Å. Compared to single thiazole or thiophene rings, a slight decrease in aromaticity was observed after ring fusion, as indicated by the slightly longer bond lengths.
 Fig. 5  ORTEP drawing of the single-crystal X-ray structure of parent thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (6) (Reproduced from ref. 28). 
Furthermore, work done by Benin and co-workers on mono- as well as dihalogenated TzTz's showed a slight difference in bond lengths and bond angles between the two fused thiazole rings.8 A difference in the length between the two formally single C–S bonds was observed. Such difference, combined with the fact that the C–C bond is longer than a typical double bond, shows resonance delocalization. The same study also showed, from the measured angles between both thiazole rings across the central C–C bond (180.00° and 179.33° for the dibrominated and monobrominated TzTz, respectively), near to perfect planarity of the fused bicyclic ring system.
When thiophene rings were coupled to the TzTz core (see Scheme 13), X-ray analysis showed perfect coplanarity of the additional heterocycles (Fig. 6).1 π–π face-to-face stacking of the molecules could also be seen from the crystal structures of both monomers and polymers, with an interplanar distance of 3.47 Å. A short intermolecular S–N interaction (3.20 Å) was observed, significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.35 Å). On the other hand, the X-ray study performed by Wagner and Kubicki on 2,5-bis(thien-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole showed a small dihedral angle of 1.68° between the thiazole and thiophene rings.29 Similarly, also in this case a short intermolecular distance (3.58 Å between the S atoms in the planes) was observed and attributed to weak S⋯S and C–H⋯S interactions. Distortion in planarity was likewise reported by Pope et al. for 2,5-bis(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-TzTz (46),30 as well as by Yamashita et al. for 2,5-bis[5-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)thiazol-2-yl]-TzTz (47) and 2,5-bis[2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)thiazol-5-yl]-TzTz (48) (Fig. 7).16c

3.2. Electronic characteristics

3.2.1. Absorption spectra. 
An extensive spectroscopic study on the unsubstituted thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (6) has been conducted by Zanirato and co-workers in 1983.31 The ultraviolet spectrum of the TzTz vapours starts at 290 nm and consists of a broad absorption peaking at approximately 250 nm and a weaker absorption with some structure around 200 nm (Fig. 8). The main absorption starts with two shoulders at 272 and 275 nm, then rises to a first intense shoulder at 260 nm and a second strong maximum peaks at 248 nm. In the region of 200 nm a different electronic transition was observed, most likely to be a Rydberg transition. The absorption spectrum for the solution state corresponds in its major features to that of the vapour, except for the fine structure in the region around 200 nm, which was not observed (Fig. 8). All these data suggested the presence of two intense π→π* electronic transitions, overlapping in the region of the near-UV.
 Fig. 8  UV spectra of parent TzTz 6 in the gas phase (top) and in solution (bottom) (Reprinted from ref. 31 by permission of the publisher, Taylor and Francis Ltd, http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals). 
The absorption spectra of substituted TzTz's are all quite similar, at least for simple compounds. Their absorption maxima can be found red-shifted (as expected due to the extended conjugation of the π system) in the range from 350–400 nm, with typical log ε values around 4.5, and consisting of two closely overlapping peaks.3 2,5-Diphenylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole has been studied by Atvars et al. (Fig. 9).32 They showed that the maximum of the absorption band is centered at 357 nm, and they also observed overlap of two peaks. A slight solvatochromic effect was seen as a function of solvent polarity, without any noticeable peak broadening. A suggested explanation for the low vibrational resolution of the TzTz spectrum is the occurrence of rotamers around the C–C bond between the thiazole and phenyl rings.32 The energy barrier was theoretically estimated at 5.1/5.5 kcal mol−1, using HF and DFT methods, respectively (compared to a value of 4.95 kcal mol−1 reported by McCullough et al.33 for the energy barrier between the thiazole ring and a 3-methyl-substituted thiophene ring). Although the coplanar form is energetically most stable, according to the theoretical calculations several conformers can coexist at room temperature, thus causing broadening of the absorption peaks.

The absorption spectra are generally quite similar for TzTz-based polymers, except for the fact that additional conjugation causes an even larger bathochromic shift, resulting in absorption in the visible region and over a much wider spectral range (as shown for thiophene-TzTz polymers 30 in Fig. 10).2

3.2.2. HOMO–LUMO energy levels. 
The energy levels of TzTz molecules are important to judge their applicability in optoelectronic applications. Careful tuning of the HOMO–LUMO levels is for instance important to achieve high organic solar cell efficiencies. In general, both the HOMO and LUMO levels are lowered upon introduction of electron withdrawing groups. In most cases, the HOMO–LUMO values are estimated from oxidation and reduction potentials, as obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, together with optical bandgaps taken from the onset of the absorption spectra.34,35 Nowadays, for almost every new compound used in organic electronic applications, either a small molecule or a polymer, HOMO–LUMO energy levels are experimentally derived and often compared with calculated values. The HOMO–LUMO values for a range of TzTz-based molecules (Fig. 11 and 12) are gathered in Tables 1 and 2.

4. Applications
TzTz-based materials are recently mostly applied in organic electronic devices, i.e. organic solar cells, field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes, the latter two being used in active matrix displays. A common feature that makes these materials so popular lately is their excellent hole mobility throughout the molecule, as well as their high stability towards environmental influences such as oxygen and humidity.36
Before their recent use as organic semiconducting materials, the liquid crystalline properties of a series of TzTz small molecules and polymers were also studied.37–39 However, no significant progress has been made ever since. After a brief decline in the number of publications on the TzTz system in the period 1992–2000 (see Fig. 1), the TzTz revival started with a series of papers by Yamashita and co-workers who studied TzTz's in FETs, their first paper being published in 2004.16a They observed much higher field-effect mobilities for thiophene-TzTz oligomers in the range of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 than for analogous thiophene-thiazole oligomers. Several other publications then followed, all using similar small molecules containing a TzTz core with appended aromatic moieties carrying either electron accepting or electron donating groups to form n- or p-type materials, respectively.16
 Fig. 12  Structures of the TzTz-based small molecules listed in Table 2. 
4.1. OFETs
Small TzTz molecules with attached thiophenes were studied as p-type semiconducting materials. Several thiophene-substituted TzTz's were prepared, i.e. 2,5-bis(thien-2-yl)-TzTz 80, 2-bithiophenyl-TzTz 81 and 4-hexyl-2-bithiophenyl-TzTz 82 (Fig. 13). TzTz 80 didn't show any reasonable FET properties, due to its high ionisation potential, while the other two derivatives both showed good hole mobilities (2.0 and 0.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with on/off ratios of 103 for both materials). Easy derivatization of the TzTz structure hence enabled simple tuning of the FET characteristics. Further work from the same group focused on screening of different TzTz molecules, derivatized by heterocyclic substituents, also pursuing n-type semiconductor behaviour. In terms of n-type materials, the measured mobilities reached values of up to 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1, while for p-type devices based on 2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)thiazol-4-yl-substituted TzTz's, mobilities up to 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported.16
 Fig. 13  Structures of the TzTz semiconductors used in OFETs. 
Semiconducting TzTz-based polymers are nowadays mostly explored in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. However, their use in OFET applications might also have some advantages compared to small molecules, especially in terms of processability, since simple and low-cost solution deposition techniques can be used.18,58 Simple TzTz-thiophene copolymers 28/30 were synthesized by Stille polycondensation reactions by McCullough et al. (Scheme 12).2a Despite the rather low molecular weight of polymer 30 (Mw = 17.1 × 103), it exhibited surprisingly high mobilities of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 with on/off ratios of 106 after annealing. An additional advantage is also the high oxidative and environmental stability. On the other hand, polymer 28 was found insoluble in many solvents, even at elevated temperatures, and therefore could not be characterized.2a Similar results were later on published by the same group as well as by Zhan et al.,2,54 who reported carrier mobilities in the same range using similar polymers, simply decorated with longer alkyl side chains to achieve higher solubility.
An interesting polymer material was prepared in a collaborative effort of different research groups from China and Hong Kong.52 Instead of preparing standard type carbon-backbone polymers, platinum acetylide polymers 71a,b were synthesized, in which the Pt atoms are part of the main polymer chain (Scheme 15). Thus obtained polymers showed impressive peak field-effect charge carrier mobilities of 2.1–2.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on/off ratios of 0.8–1.0 × 105 for the holes. The high hole mobility reported for one of the polymers is among the highest reported for metallopolyynes.

4.2. OLEDs
Organic light-emitting diodes are currently extensively being used in displays, mostly for portable devices, due to their lower energy consumption compared to traditional LED displays. There are only a few publications where TzTz's have been used for the manufacturing of LED devices. Most of them concern TzTz-based polymers, which exhibit suitable properties required for high efficiency photoluminescent materials, such as amorphous or ‘solution-like’ solid state behaviour, charge transport ability, etc.
It is known from literature that fluorene-based polymers exhibit good electroluminescent properties as well as a good stability (among other advantages).59 However, poor electron mobilities generally prevent efficient hole and electron recombination, reducing the electroluminescence abilities. Therefore, copolymers 20 and 25 were prepared, combining fluorene in the backbone (to achieve good electroluminescent properties) with TzTz (to improve mobility) (Schemes 10 and 11). Indeed, this resulted in electroluminescent polymers that were 3 times more efficient than the fluorene homopolymers.22,50 Fluorene-free high molecular weight light-emitting polymers 67a–c (Fig. 11) were also prepared and showed high fluorescence both in solution and in the solid state.49
The only reports on the use of small TzTz molecules for OLED's were published recently by Zhang and co-workers.24,25 They synthesized boron-bridged ladder-type TzTz molecules 37–40 and 42–45 (Scheme 14), with bulky side groups attached to the boron bridge preventing π–π stacking. Consequently, such materials exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields and strong electron affinities. A simple electroluminescence device thus afforded the highest brightness (up to 18 × 103 cd m−2) and efficiency among all boron-containing materials reported at the time, as well as a good thermal stability.
4.3. OPVs
The vast majority of publications on TzTz's can be found in the field of organic photovoltaics, especially focusing on the synthesis of low bandgap copolymers for bulk heterojunction solar cells. Organic solar cells currently receive wide interest of researchers all over the world, as they show some appealing features such as simple preparation, aesthetics, flexibility, semi-transparency, better performance in diffuse light and reduced weight, which makes OPV particularly attractive for portable or wearable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The photoactive layer materials that are used can be divided into two main groups, namely small molecules (including oligomers) and polymers. Polymer solar cells are particularly attractive due to their ease of processing, which allows the use of straightforward large area printing procedures and enables competitive pricing compared to the established silicon solar cell technology. Rapid progress has been achieved in terms of solar energy power conversion efficiency (PCE), reaching values up to 10% now, as well as operational stability.2 However, there are still some important issues that need to be overcome before efficient and stable organic solar cells can be made widely available on the market. On the other hand, there is also a lot of prospect for solution-processable conjugated small molecules, as they have recently been shown to afford comparable efficiencies to the low bandgap conjugated polymers.43,57
Thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles have been shown to be powerful building blocks in the design of materials for organic solar cells, mainly due to their high environmental stability and charge transfer capabilities. The first synthesis of TzTz-based polymers for BHJ solar cells was performed by Choi et al. in 2010,40 who prepared a low bandgap polymer 49 using a Stille coupling reaction between TzTz 84 and the extended chromophore 85 (Scheme 16). When blended with PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) in a 1:2 ratio (polymer vs. PC71BM), a moderate PCE of 1.21% was achieved with this polymer.
 Scheme 16  Synthesis of TzTz-based D–A copolymer 49. 
Since then, a lot of publications have appeared on the preparation of new copolymers, using a similar D–A approach. The record PCE of 5.7% for TzTz-based polymers was recently achieved by Takimiya et al. using a rather simple copolymer 86 (Fig. 14),60 which was initially prepared for OFETs.2 The high molecular weight (Mw = 3 × 105; Mn = 33 × 103) obtained seems to be crucial for high PCE's. However, even lower molecular weight batches resulted in only a slight decrease in efficiency to 5.3%.
By combining two of the most common building blocks for polymer solar cells, namely TzTz and CPDT, and employing a Suzuki polycondensation reaction, the low bandgap material 60 has been prepared (see Fig. 11).17 Use of asymmetrical alkyl substitution on the CPDT unit improved solubility, while still enabling π–π stacking, resulting in a semicrystalline material. By improving the purity of the polymer, the PCE was noticeable increased, reaching 4.03% (when blended with PC71BM in a 1:3 ratio).
 Fig. 14  Structure of TzTz -based D–A polymer 86 affording a PCE of 5.7%. 
Besides polymers, also small molecules can be used in different types of solar cells. To date, there are not many examples of small TzTz molecules applied in organic solar cells. Donor–acceptor–donor type dyes 75 and 76 with triphenylamine donor groups flanking the TzTz were very recently synthesized (Fig. 12).56,57 The materials were solution-processed in a 1:4 blend with PC61BM, giving excellent thermal stability and a PCE up to 3.73%. On the other hand, similar materials 78 and 79a,b (Fig. 12) with electron withdrawing groups have been used as acceptor materials, replacing the standard fullerenes in BHJ solar cells in combination with MDMO-PPV as the electron donor polymer. Although the PCE achieved was very poor (0.1%), high open-circuit voltage (Voc) values were obtained and useful information on the charge transfer mechanism was gathered that may help in the further design of high performance devices.58
5. Conclusions
The thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole biheterocyclic system has been increasingly studied in recent years, mainly due to the steadily growing interest in its applications in organic electronics. Materials containing the TzTz structure generally exhibit a good stability towards oxygen and light, which are rather detrimental for a large number of the thiophene-based materials most often applied in devices. The excellent charge mobilities resulting from the planarity of the TzTz core and the high tendency for π–π stacking render TzTz derivatives excellent candidates for both OFETs and organic solar cells. Tuning of the electronic properties can readily be achieved by attaching different electron donor and/or acceptor groups. The low solubility of the parent TzTz structure requires substitution with alkyl chains whenever solution-processability is desirable.
Looking at the synthetic chemistry that has been explored so far for the development of TzTz compounds, it seems plausible that the best is yet to come for these materials. Although many novel TzTz derivatives have been synthesized during the last decade, most of the procedures still employ the original synthetic protocol, which is rather harsh and low-yielding. Some of the alternative procedures listed certainly deserve a novel more proper look. In particular pathways towards the parent TzTz system 6 are attractive to increase the diversity of structures. In general, there are certainly opportunities ahead for creative synthetic/material chemists, and the overview of synthetic protocols explored so far can serve as a source of inspiration. Further TzTz derivatization paths may open additional opportunities towards new materials with advanced properties.
