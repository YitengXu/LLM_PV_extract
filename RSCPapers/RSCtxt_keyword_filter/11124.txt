    , Accepted 29th July 2015First published on 29th July 2015AbstractA series of unsymmetrical π-conjugated small molecules have been constructed from meso-alkyl substituted porphyrins as the central unit and 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal group. Using PC71BM as an acceptor, and these small molecules as electron donors in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells, a high power conversion efficiency of 6.49% has been achieved.
With the development of accessible and renewable energy sources, solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) have been well developed and recognized as one of the most promising next-generation green technology alternatives to inorganic solar cells because of their solution processability, low cost, light weight, and flexibility.1,2 Specifically, small-molecule BHJ OSCs have attracted much attention recently, in which small molecules as donor materials have defined molecular structure and molecular weight, high purity, and less batch-to-batch variations in comparison with their polymer counterparts.3–5 With the tireless efforts of researchers in the past decade, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed small-molecule based OPVs have been improved up to 10% for single-layer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, which are approaching those of the widely investigated polymer-based OPVs.6–11 And the typical structures of small molecules with high efficiencies in BHJ OSCs are mainly dithienosilole-benzo-thiadiazole derivatives,12–15 benzodithiophene (BDT) derivatives16,17 and oligothiophene derivatives,18 thus searching for new potential donor materials with appropriate physical properties such as low band gap, suitable energy levels, high crystallinity, decent solubility, etc. is critical.19
In dye-sensitized solar cells, porphyrin-based push–pull photosensitizers have demonstrated their success for their large and rigid planar conjugated structures, which can enhance π-electron delocalization and promote intermolecular π–π interaction, as well as charge transport in devices.20 However, either polymers or small molecules that are porphyrin based show less contribution in BHJ OSCs, and the main impediments to performance are unfavorable aggregation, short exciton diffusion length and low charge mobility.21–23 Very recently, Peng et al. employed a porphyrin molecule with less bulky substituents at the periphery as the donor material along with PC61BM as the acceptor for solution-processed organic solar cells and achieved a PCE of up to 7.23%.24 We believe that porphyrin-based small molecules should play a more important role in BHJ OSCs with judicious structural optimization due to their strong absorption spectrum, high molar absorption coefficients, and unique photophysical properties. In the traditional porphyrin structures, peripheral meso-phenyl substituents stand at an almost orthogonal orientation relative to the porphyrin plane, which prevents intermolecular π–π stacking, as well as intermolecular charge transport.25 And the porphyrin framework with meso-alkyl chains instead of meso-phenyl substituents has never been investigated in the construction of small molecules for BHJ OSC applications.26,27 It was believed that the long alkyl chain could not only improve the solubility of small molecules in most organic solvents, but also control the film morphology and crystallinity, leading to the enhancement of charge transport.27
In this contribution, we first synthesized three new unsymmetrical push–pull A–D–A small molecules consisting of meso-alkyl substituted porphyrins 5,15-bis(2-octylundecyl)-porphyrin, 5,15-bis(3-octyl-1-tridecyl)-porphyrin and 5,15-bis(4-octyl-1-tetradecyl)-porphyrin as electron rich donor (D) units, ethynylbenzene as π-linkage, and 3-ethylrhodanine (RH) as the electron deficient acceptor (A). Specifically, the effect of the branching point of the alkyl chains on the film morphology, charge mobility and photovoltaic performance was investigated. As shown in Scheme 1, the precursors ZnPCHO were prepared in about 80% yield via Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira reactions between ZnBrP and 4-ethynyl-2,5-bis(hexyloxy)-benzaldehyde. Subsequently, the Knoevenagel condensation of ZnPCHO with 3-ethylrhodanine afforded the target molecules CS-I, CS-II and CS-III. As expected, these three π-conjugated small molecules show good solubility in most common organic solvents.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for CS-I, CS-II and CS-III. Reaction conditions: (a) Pd(PPh3)4, CuI, THF/Et3N, 50 °C, overnight; (b) 3-ethylrhodanine, dry CHCl3, piperidine, reflux, overnight. 
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the UV-vis absorption spectra of CS-I, CS-II and CS-III, measured in dilute chloroform (CHCl3) solution, exhibit identical peak maxima at around 474, 505 and 698 nm with similar molar extinction coefficients of 1.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1. It should be noted that a strong and broad absorption in the region of 600–760 nm was observed due the characteristics of the A–D–A molecular structure. Compared to their spectra in solution, their thin films prepared by spin-coating in chlorobenzene solutions show about approximately 40 nm redshifts. Obviously, the strong intermolecular π–π stacking of the molecules leads to a broader absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions. Such an ordered packing of small molecules is in favor of achieving an efficient charge mobility as discussed below.28 Besides, CS-I in the solid film shows a broader absorption band that presumably comes from stronger intermolecular interactions. Compared to CS-I and CS-II, CS-III exhibits a blueshift that might be a result of the difference in planarity caused by the orientation of the side chains that stretch out of the porphyrin ring. It is worth noting that CS-II in the solid state has a shoulder peak appeared at 414 nm. These phenomena are rather consistent with the different crystalline nature of CS-II. In addition, the optical band gaps of CS-I, CS-II and CS-III in the thin films were estimated from the onset of absorption to be approximately 1.50 eV, 1.55 eV and 1.54 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of CS-I, CS-II and CS-III in CHCl3 solution (a) and in the film (b). 
Cyclic voltammetry of the three small molecules in the solution of CH2Cl2 (Fig. S7, ESI†) was recorded to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) frontier energy levels. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.12 eV and −3.55 eV (Eg = 1.57 eV) for CS-I, −5.14 eV and −3.55 eV (Eg = 1.59 eV) for CS-II, and −5.17 and −3.54 (Eg = 1.63 eV) for CS-III, respectively. Obviously, the presence of the 3-ethylrhodanine in these molecules effectively decreases the band gaps and extends their absorption into the NIR region.29 On the other hand, the low-lying HOMO levels of the three molecules are favorable to generate high open circuit voltage in BHJ OSCs and the LUMO levels are higher than PC71BM (−3.8 eV) for exciton dissociation, which indicates their high suitability to act as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor in BHJ OSCs. As expected, the strategy of combining a weak D and a strong A moiety can provide a favorable HOMO and LUMO energy level, as well as a suitable band gap (Eg), which are beneficial for the performance of the photovoltaics in BHJ OSCs.30
The solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated utilizing PC71BM as the electron acceptor and three small molecules as the electron donors under a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)]-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene PFN)/Al, and then measured under AM 1.5 illumination. The ratio of the small-molecule donor and PC71BM was optimized to be 1:1 (w/w) and the blend films were processed with or without pyridine additives in chlorobenzene. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S8 and S9 in the ESI,† and the key device parameters are included in Table 1. A PCE of 3.19% with VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 8.41 mA cm−2 and FF = 44.79% was achieved for CS-I without pyridine additive (Fig. S8, ESI†). With 3% pyridine as the additive for the blend film, the device shows a much improved photovoltaic performance with VOC = 0.90 V, JSC = 13.72 mA cm−2 and FF = 52.12%, corresponding to a PCE of 6.49% (Fig. 2a). The highly enhanced JSC originates from the change of molecular assembly of the zinc porphyrin in the specific solvent additive.31 As shown in Fig. 2b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized device of 1:1 CS-I/PC71BM ratio with 3% pyridine and without pyridine additive (Fig. S9, ESI†) was measured. Both the devices show a very wide range of photocurrent generation in the range of 350–800 nm, with the highest EQE value of 72.46% at 510 nm and 60.04% at 740 nm achieved for the device based on the blend film with 3% pyridine additive. Unexpectedly, the performance of the device based on CS-II shows much inferior performance with a JSC of 6.29 mA cm−2, FF of 0.48 and PCE of 2.53%. This result is due to the inefficient exciton splitting in accordance with the macroscopic phase separation (vide infra). As for CS-III, a comparable VOC value of 0.87 V and a lower JSC of 10.50 mA cm−2 constrain the PCE to 5.12%.

Subsequently, we measured the hole mobilities of the donor/PC71BM blend films by spin-coating in chlorobenzene with and without pyridine as additive in the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. According to the experimental and calculated results, the hole mobility of the device without pyridine additive is 1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CS-I/PC71BM composite film, while the value is highly enhanced to 4.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon the addition of pyridine (Fig. S10, ESI†). Obviously, the presence of pyridine in the sample processing plays a very important role in the optimization of photovoltaic efficiency and EQE value, accompanying the reinforcement of intermolecular interactions and hence an enhanced hole mobility. Noteworthily, CS-III demonstrated its space-charge-limited (SCL) hole mobility of 6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S11, ESI†), while the film thickness of CS-II is not homogeneous and not suitable for further analysis using SCLC.32
To understand the effect of the molecular structure and the solvent additive on the photovoltaic performance, the morphology of the BHJ thin films spin-coated with and without the pyridine additive was characterized by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the peripheral alkyl substituents could not only enhance the charge mobility of the as-fabricated devices, but also affect the morphology of the films.27Fig. 3 compares the AFM blend films of CS-I/PC71BM thin films cast from chlorobenzene and 3% pyridine in chlorobenzene solutions at the optimized ratio. The blend film without pyridine additive exhibits obvious phase separation between CS-I and PC71BM with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.45 nm, which should be unfavorable for exciton diffusion, leading to the lower JSC value of the device (Fig. 3a and c).33 In contrast, a less well-defined phase separation and a smoother surface were found for the CS-I/PC71BM blend film in 3% pyridine additive with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.57 nm, due to much better miscibility between CS-I and PC71BM in the presence of pyridine (Fig. 3b and d). However, the topographic patterns for CS-II and CS-III appear to possess a rough nodular character when compared to those of CS-I, especially those for CS-II (Fig. S12, ESI†). Not surprisingly, the lower surface roughness and much smaller phase separation of the AFM imaging for CS-I result in a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, affording a higher JSC value and higher PCE.

In summary, a series of new unsymmetrical push–pull A–D–A small molecules based on different 5,15-dialkylated porphyrin cores were designed and synthesized, which show good solubility in common organic solvents, a broad absorption in the visible and NIR regions, a relatively high hole mobility and good film-forming properties of solution-processed BHJ OSCs. Based on the blend film of CS-I/PC71BM spin-coated from a mixture of 3% pyridine in chlorobenzene, a high PCE of 6.49% was achieved. These primary results indicate that the A–D–A small molecules based on meso-alkyl directly substituted porphyrin core are a new class of donor candidates for highly efficient BHJ OSCs.
