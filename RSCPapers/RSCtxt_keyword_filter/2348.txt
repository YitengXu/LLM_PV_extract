    , Accepted 9th August 2022First published on 10th August 2022AbstractDeveloping efficient singlet fission (SF) materials with high triplet energy and good stability for practical applications is still a challenge. Anthracene is stable and can carry out SF but with less efficiency, because its SF is strongly endothermic. Herein, using time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, we found for the first time an efficient SF material (ΦT = 164%) based on an anthracene dimer, with high triplet energy (1.51 eV) and good stability simultaneously. This is attributed to its orthogonal dimeric structure and the nearly perpendicular intermolecular conformation in its solid film that could decrease its triplet energy moderately to make SF thermodynamically isoergic. This result suggests that a covalently linked anthracene dimer might be an ideal structure skeleton to develop new SF materials with high efficiencies and good stability.
Introduction
Singlet fission (SF) is a spin-allowed process that can convert a high-energy singlet exciton into two low-energy triplet excitons,1 which has the potential to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit on the theoretical efficiency of a single-junction solar cell.2–5 Theoretical calculations have predicted that the maximum power conversion efficiency of a single-junction photovoltaic device could be increased from 33% to 45% by incorporating a layer of SF materials.4
However, utilizing SF to promote solar cell efficiencies was not very successful due to the limited number of efficient SF materials with high triplet energies over bandgaps of common semiconductors (such as silicon, with a 1.1 eV triplet energy)6,7 and good stability simultaneously.8,9 The reported efficient SF materials with the highest triplet energy (∼1.2 eV) are tetracene compounds.10–15 In tandem tetracene with silicon solar cells, however, the enhancement of the overall solar to current transferring efficiency is small because of the inefficient harvesting of its triplet excitons by silicon due to the low triplet energy transfer yield.9,16,17 Increasing triplet energies of SF materials can theoretically provide a large thermodynamic driving force for the triplet energy transfer and then improve the harvesting efficiency of triplet excitons by solar cells.6,17 Perkinson et al. have suggested that SF materials with triplet energies over 1.4 eV may be suitable, which can allow the exothermic transfer of triplet excitons to silicon.6
Anthracene has a relatively better stability and a higher triplet energy (1.78 eV) compared to tetracene (1.20 eV) and pentacene (0.86 eV), but anthracene undergoes only endothermic SF with low efficiency.6,18,19 Modification of anthracene could modulate singlet and triplet energies to make SF thermodynamically feasible.6,20–22 Ghosh and Wasielewski groups found that efficient SF could be conducted in films and nanoparticles of 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene and its derivatives.20,21,23 Unfortunately, their triplet energies decrease significantly to around 1.1 eV so that they cannot provide enough thermodynamic driving force to sensitize solar cells.6 Additionally, Perkinson et al. predicted that two anthracene derivatives might be SF materials with 1.5 eV triplet energy, but their SF efficiencies are low due to the endothermic nature of SF in it.6 It is difficult to achieve efficient SF and high triplet energy in anthracene derivatives simultaneously. So far, there is no anthracene-based SF material that can achieve efficient SF and high triplet energy (≥1.4 eV) simultaneously.
Herein, we present a new strategy for adjusting singlet and triplet energies to make SF thermodynamically allowed by dimerizing an anthracene molecule with an orthogonal conformation (9,9′-BiAn, Fig. 1a). SF in 9,9′-BiAn solid films is approximately isoergic and efficient (ΦT = 164%.). More importantly, its triplet energy (1.51 eV) is much higher than most previously reported SF materials.1

Experimental section
Materials and methods
9-PhAn and 9,9′-BiAn were synthesized following the previous report.241H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with chemical shifts reported in ppm (TMS as an internal standard). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker/ultraflex instrument. The solvents used for preparing the solutions for photophysical measurement were degassed first by the Freeze–Pump–Thaw method prior to use. All samples for photophysical measurement were prepared in a glovebox.
Preparation of the solid film
The pure film of 9-PhAn was prepared by spin-casting a 100 μL toluene solution (10−2 M) onto quartz substrates at 2000 rpm. The pure film of 9,9′-BiAn was prepared by vacuum evaporation under the pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa at 373 K. The films for the sensitization experiment were prepared by drop-casting a 30 μL toluene solution of a mixture of PtOEP (10−3 M) and 9-PhAn/9,9′-BiAn (10−2 M) onto quartz substrates.
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra
Absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 with three-monochromator spectrophotometer and three photomultiplier detectors. The emission and phosphorescence spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the detection system. The fluorescence lifetimes were measured using the FLS980 with the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method by excitation with a 441 nm picosecond laser (EPL 445). The absolute fluorescence quantum yields were measured with an integrating sphere.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectra
The pump beam was generated from a regenerative amplified Ti: sapphire laser system from Coherent (800 nm, 100 fs, 6 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate). The 800 nm output pulse from the regenerative amplifier was split into two parts with a beam splitter. The reflected part was used to pump a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) which generates a wavelength-tunable laser pulse from 250 nm to 2.5 μm as a pump beam. The transmitted 800 nm beam was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into a rotating CaF2 disk to generate a white light continuum (WLC) from 350 nm to 800 nm used for the probe beam. The probe beam was focused with an Al parabolic reflector onto the sample. After the sample, the probe beam was collimated and then focused into a fiber-coupled spectrometer and detected at a frequency of 1 KHz. The intensity of the pump pulse used in the experiment was controlled by a variable neutral-density filter wheel. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a motorized delay stage. The pump pulses were chopped by a synchronized chopper at 500 Hz.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectra
The pump beam was generated by using femtosecond laser pulses (800 nm 100 fs, 6 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) pumping TOPAS optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The synchronous output electric signal of the femtosecond laser is collected using a digital acquisition card (NI DAQ6612), and the trigger signal of the white laser is generated. The synchronization and delay of the output of the femtosecond laser and the white laser are realized. The transient absorption signal was then detected using a camera (visible E2V AT71YSM2CL2014-BAO) with a monochromator (zolix Omni-λ200i) at 1 kHz. The TAS signal is calculated by averaging 1000 times for each data point. The signal-to-noise ratio in the differential transmission is better than 10−4. The delay time is accurately calculated by the counter (Pendulum CNT-91), and the time resolution is smaller than 1 ns. All samples were prepared fresh prior to nanosecond transient absorption experiments.
Crystal structure determinations
Single crystals of 9,9′-BiAn were grown by the slow solvent-evaporation of a concentrated toluene solution. The crystallographic data of 9,9′-BiAn were collected using an Agilent Xcalibur Eos Gemini diffractometer with (Cu) X-ray source (Cu-Kα λ = 1.54184 Å). Experienced absorption was corrected by multiscan methods. The SADABS program was used to apply the empirical absorption correction. The structure was solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on F2, and all non-hydrogen atoms are refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. All the cell parameters and refinement details are given in the ESI† (Table S1). The crystal structure of 9-PhAn was downloaded from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.25
Powder XRD
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaka Ultima IV diffractometer operating at 40 mA and 40 kV, by using the Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength = 0.1538 nm). Bragg angles are scanned between 5° and 60° at a scan rate of 20° min−1 and step size of 0.028°/2.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure
A bulk single crystal of 9,9′-BiAn was prepared by slow solvent-evaporation of its concentrated toluene solution and its crystal structure is shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of solid films and crystal powder for 9-PhAn and 9,9′-BiAn were also measured (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XRD pattern of the 9-PhAn film shows main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 8.44°, 16.92° and 25.50°, which should be ascribed to the diffractions from the (001), (002), and (003) planes based on the same position as that of its crystal powder (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Additionally, a diffraction peak at 2θ = 23.91° with a d spacing of 3.71 Å could also be resolved. This peak is also presented in crystal powder which was caused by the π–π stacking of the 9-PhAn molecule. So, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 23.91° in the 9-PhAn film should also be originated from the π–π stacking. In other words, the arrangement of the 9-PhAn molecule is along the direction of the (0, 0, l) plane with an intermolecular distance of 3.71 Å. For the 9,9′-BiAn film, the main diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 8.54°, 11.26°, 16.9°, and 18.24°, which originated from (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), and (1, 0, 2) planes based on the similar position as that of its crystal powder, respectively. The similar diffraction peaks suggest that the molecular packing of 9,9′-BiAn in the film is similar to that in crystal powder. These results indicate that a similar molecular arrangement is adopted in solid films and the corresponding single crystals for these two molecules and the use of the dimeric structure in crystal powder to analyze different SF dynamics in these two solid films is feasible. A slip-stacked packing along the long-axis of the anthracene core with a π–π distance of 3.71 Å and a slippage of 4.87 Å is employed between the two closest anthracenes in the 9-PhAn crystal (Fig. 1b).24 The two anthracene units of the 9,9′-BiAn are nearly orthogonal. Furthermore, two adjacent 9,9′-BiAn molecules are also approximately perpendicular, with a center-to-center distance between the two neighboring anthracenes of 7.81 Å.25 Notably, the direction of the transition dipole moment of the lowest singlet state for anthracene is along its short axis,26 which is parallelly arranged in the 9,9′-BiAn crystal, so there is still intermolecular interaction between anthracene subunits of two adjacent dimer molecules, even though that the interaction strength may be small.
Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra
In solution, absorption spectra of 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn are similar (Fig. 2), but the maximum absorption peak of 9,9′-BiAn (377 nm) is significantly redshifted compared with that of 9-PhAn (363 nm) due to the strong intramolecular coupling in 9,9′-BiAn.27,28 The fluorescence spectrum of 9-PhAn presents a mirror-imaged emission compared to the absorption peaks, with a quantum yield (ΦF) of 0.66 and a lifetime of 7.42 ns (Fig. S4a, ESI†). However, 9,9′-BiAn presents a structureless emission spectrum resulting from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state with ΦF = 0.96 and a lifetime of 10.40 ns (Fig. S4b, ESI†).27
 Fig. 2  Absorption (solid line) and fluorescence (dash line) spectra of 9-PhAn (a) and 9,9′-BiAn (b) in toluene (black line) and solid film (red line), as well as their sensitized phosphorescence spectra in the doped solid film (n9-PhAn/9,9′-BiAn:nPtOEP = 20:1). 
In solid films, absorption spectra of both 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn are redshifted and broadened compared with those in solution, suggesting the presence of intermolecular interaction. Notably, the broadened degree is larger for 2-PhAn than that for 9,9′-BiAn, which may be caused by the stronger intermolecular interaction in the 2-PhAn film. Additionally, the presence of more Mie scattering tail in the longer wavelength region of the absorption spectrum for the 2-PhAn film compared to that for the 9,9′-BiAn film makes the absorption spectrum of the 2-PhAn film wider, which may be caused by the bigger size of the grains in the 2-PhAn film.20,29 Likewise, redshifted fluorescence spectra are observed, with strongly quenched intensity (ΦF: 0.13 and 0.04 for 9-PhAn and 9,9′-BiAn film, respectively). This is consistent with their faster fluorescence decays (Fig. 3) compared to those in solution (Fig. S4, ESI†). Strong fluorescence quenching implies the presence of other non-radiative decay pathways that compete with the emission. Furthermore, these fluorescence behaviors are very similar to the observation in the 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene film that shows efficient SF.6,20 So, the non-radiative decay in the 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn films may be the SF process. Additionally, the phosphorescence peaks of the 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn films obtained by the sensitization method30,31 are found to be at ∼820 nm (1.51 eV) and ∼730 nm (1.70 eV), respectively. The singlet state energies of 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn are determined to be 3.00 eV and 2.97 eV from the intersection (413 and 418 nm for 9,9′-BiAn and 9-PhAn, respectively) between their absorption and fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2).32 So, SF in the 9,9′-BiAn film should be isoergic, and SF in the 9-PhAn film should be strongly endoergic.

The presence of SF in the 9,9′-BiAn film is also supported by magnetic-field dependent fluorescence dynamics (Fig. 3b). When applying a magnetic field, an obviously enhanced fluorescence signal was observed, which is consistent with the observation in tetracene with efficient SF and is explained by the increased singlet population.33 But this enhancement is not observed in the 9-PhAn film (Fig. 3a), suggesting that SF in it is not efficient.
Transient absorption spectra
To further investigate the excited-state dynamics in these systems, a femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) experiment was conducted. In toluene, after photoexcitation, the TA spectra of 9-PhAn show immediately two photo-induced bleaching (PIB) bands corresponding to stimulated emission (SE) at 424 and 440 nm and two excited-state absorption (ESA) associated with the singlet (S1) state at 376 nm and 470–650 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). Then, the S1 state decays with a time constant of 6.23 ns, along with the formation of a slight triplet (T1) state via intersystem crossing (ISC) (Fig. S6, ESI†).
As for the 9-PhAn film (Fig. 4), similar S1 absorption bands were observed upon photoexcitation. However, the S1 state decays obviously faster than that in solution, almost half of the S1 absorption intensity decays within the first 20 ps followed by a slow decay. With the slow decay, a new weak spectral feature appears and is dominated by an ESA band at 455 nm. This new spectrum is attributed to the triplet state because of its well matching to the sensitized T1 spectrum (the inset of Fig. 4a and Fig. S7, ESI†). The global analysis34 result shows that the spectra between the first (SA) and the second (SB) component are very similar except a decreased S1 absorption intensity (Fig. 4c). This phenomenon was also observed in the 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene film, which is ascribed to singlet–singlet annihilation (SSA).20,21 After the SSA process, the triplet state is formed with τ = 93.9 ps, which is much faster than that of ISC in solution (6.23 ns). So, the triplet state in the 9-PhAn film should be generated from SF.20,21 However, the triplet yield is only 45 ± 15% as estimated by the GSB method (see the ESI† for the detail),11,35 which is less efficient and similar to other anthracene compounds.36,37 The low SF efficiency of the 9-PhAn film should be resulted from the large energy barrier for SF (ΔESF, 0.43 eV, is defined as 2E(T1)–E(S1)).

Upon photoexcitation, TA spectra of 9,9′-BiAn in toluene display immediately the GSB band at 394 nm, and the S1 absorption bands at 376 nm and 450–650 nm (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†). Subsequently, the S1 state evolves into the TICT state with τ = 7.94 ps (Fig. S8c and d, ESI†).27 Then, the TICT state decays (τ = 9.81 ns); meanwhile, the T1 state is formed at 435 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†).27 For the 9,9′-BiAn film, a similar spectral feature of the solution is observed at the beginning, with the GSB bands at 381 and 405 nm, and the S1 absorption bands at 373, 388 and 450–650 nm. In the first 2–4 ps, the S1 absorption bands at 373 and 388 nm show a huge decrease, but the ESA band after 450 nm has only a slight drop (Fig. 5a and b). Furthermore, the initial S1 band at 566 nm is blue-shifted to 558 nm. All these results indicate the formation of a new state with the main ESA at 558 nm that overlaps with the initial S1 state. This spectral evolution is similar to the formation of the TICT state in toluene (Fig. S8a, ESI†) and so we assign this new state to the CT state. Then, as the CT band at 558 nm decays, a new strong ESA band at 415 nm is formed gradually within 50 ps, which should be originated from the T1 state based on the sensitized T1 spectrum (the inset of Fig. 5a and Fig. S10, ESI†). Meanwhile, the GSB signal at 379 nm grows in intensity with the formation of the T1 state (Fig. 5b), suggesting strongly the occurrence of SF.20,38,39 These evolutions could also be seen clearly from the single-wavelength dynamics (Fig. 5b).

Next, we conducted a global analysis to analyze the TA data of the 9,9′-BiAn film (Fig. 5C and D) and found that the fitting result with a sequential four-component model agrees well with the raw data (Fig. S11, ESI†).34 The initial S1 state decays with τ = 0.49 ps, accompanied by the formation of the second state that displays a sharp decreased absorption at 373 and 388 nm as well as a constant absorption after 450 nm. This state should be the CT state according to the above discussion. Then, the CT state decays into the third state with τ = 8.98 ps. The third component spectrum has an obvious T1 absorption at 415 nm, but the CT absorption after 450 nm is still visible, and so this state may be a multiexciton state consisting of the T1 state and the CT state.38 We labelled it to the TT state. The final state is formed with τ = 59.6 ps from the TT state. The CT absorption is fully vanished in the spectrum of the final state, and the residual absorption is more resemble to that of the T1 state obtained from the sensitization experiment. So, we assigned the final state to the T1 state. At last, the triplet yield is calculated to be 164 ± 10%.11,35 This over 100% triplet yield also supports that the triplet state is generated from SF, the only channel by which more than one triplet is formed from the absorption of one photon.1 From the above discussion, we can see that the CT state participates in the formation of the triplet state and acts as an intermediate state for SF. This is similar to the observation in some covalently linked pentacene and tetracene oligomers in which the CT state acts as an intermediate state for SF.40,41 Compared to 9,9′-BiAn in solution, the CT state could also be formed, but SF cannot be proceeded. This is mainly because the triplet state energy is too high and makes SF not thermodynamically feasible. Instead, the decrease of the triplet state energy in the 9,9′-BiAn film makes SF thermodynamically feasible. Notably, the SF rate and yield of the 9,9′-BiAn film are enhanced significantly compared to 9-PhAn. This seems contradictory to the relatively small electronic coupling in the 9,9′-BiAn film brought by the larger separation distance between the adjacent anthracene units compared to that in the 9-PhAn film. However, it is not the larger the orbital overlap, the faster SF rate.1,21 Indeed, the SF rate is dependent on the effective electronic coupling. For example, Smith et al. claimed that the slip-stacked structure is more favorable for SF than the co-facial arrangement due to the slip-stacked structure that has a larger effective electronic coupling.1 Additionally, the Wasielewski group also found that the 9,10-Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene film with a relatively large lateral slip distance has a larger effective electronic coupling for SF compared to that with a small lateral slip distance and has a faster SF rate.21 Thus, the larger separation between the adjacent anthracene units in the 9,9′-BiAn film may not lead to a slower SF rate compared with the 9-PhAn film with a relatively small separation distance. More importantly, the SF energy barrier (0 eV) in the 9,9′-BiAn film is much smaller than that in the 9-PhAn film (0.43 eV), so 9,9′-BiAn has a faster and more efficient SF than 9-PhAn. Given that the singlet energies of these two films are nearly the same, the decreased energy barrier for 9,9′-BiAn should be caused mainly by its dropped triplet energy. To reveal the reason for the decrease of the triplet state energy of 9,9′-BiAn in the film, TD-DFT calculations were performed first. At the ground state, the electrons of HOMO and LUMO are mainly focused on the anthracene unit (Fig. S12, ESI†). The electrons of HOMO and LUMO are distributed uniformly on the two anthracene units of 9,9′-BiAn, suggesting that the singlet exciton is delocalized on the two anthracene units. This is consistent with the redshifted absorption spectra of 9,9′-BiAn and the decreased singlet state energy compared to that of 9-PhAn (Fig. 2). More importantly, the triplet state energy of 9,9′-BiAn (1.83 eV) is decreased compared to that of 9-PhAn (1.86 eV) (Table S2, ESI†). In other words, when two chromophores are connected into an orthogonal conformation, its triplet state energy would be decreased. But this effect is relatively small and cannot significantly decrease the triplet state energy, so SF in 9,9′-BiAn in the solution and the PMMA film is still strongly endothermic. This agrees well with the absence of SF in 9,9′-BiAn in the solution and the PMMA film (see below for the details). So, the aggregation effect also contributes to the decrease of the triplet state energy of 9,9′-BiAn in a solid state, which has been observed in the perylenediimide film due to the electronic coupling between the triplet exciton and the adjacent ground-state molecule.42 The greater decrease of the T1 state energy for 9,9′-BiAn compared to that for 9-PhAn indicates that the orthogonal dimeric structure and the nearly perpendicular intermolecular conformation are more favorable for the decrease of the triplet state energy. Additionally, steady-state photophysical properties of 9,9′-BiAn in the PMMA film were also measured. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of 9,9′-BiAn in the PMMA film are almost the same to that in solution (Fig. S13, ESI†), suggesting that the 9,9′-BiAn molecule in the PMMA film is a single-molecular state. However, the fluorescence quantum yield of 9,9′-BiAn in the PMMA film could reach 90%, which is close to that in solution. This means that no nonradiative decay pathway is presented in the PMMA film. In other words, SF is not conducted in PMMA films. This, together with the absence of SF in the solution, suggests that the intramolecular SF may not be the dominated mechanism. If the intramolecular SF is the dominated mechanism, SF should also be presented in the PMMA film of 9,9′-BiAn. Thus, the intermolecular SF may be the dominated mechanism for SF in the 9,9′-BiAn film.
Conclusions
In summary, we have achieved for the first time highly efficient SF in an anthracene dimer film. The triplet energy is as high as 1.5 eV, which is the highest among previously reported SF sensitizers.1 The result also shows that dimerizing an anthracene molecule into an orthogonal conformation should be an effective strategy to create new SF sensitizers based on anthracene derivatives. This principle might also be applied into large amount of other chromophores that are usually not regarded to conduct SF because of their unfavorable energy levels for SF, and thus opens a door to expand the family of SF sensitizers.
