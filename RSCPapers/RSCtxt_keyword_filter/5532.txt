    , Accepted 11th September 2015First published on 11th September 2015AbstractIn this study, we have used three D–A type carbazole substituted BODIPY (carbazole connected to the meso position of BODIPY) small molecules as donors along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The devices based on the as cast active layer showed power conversion efficiency in the range of 2.20–2.70%, with high open circuit voltage (Voc) in the range of 0.94–1.08 V. The high Voc is related to the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of these small molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices based on thermally annealed and solvent vapor annealed (TSVA) 3a:PC71BM and 3c:PC71BM processed active layers improved up to 5.05% and 4.80%, respectively, attributed to the improved light harvesting ability of active layers, better phase separation for exciton dissociation and balanced charge transport, induced by the TA and TSVA treatment.
Introduction
In last couple of decades solution processable organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers have been extensively investigated due to light weight, low cost of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1 The BHJ active layer used in these solar cells comprised fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), as electron-accepting materials, and various low band-gap π-conjugated polymers or small molecules as electron-donating materials. Recently, PCEs of over 10% and 11% have been achieved for the single BHJ layer and tandem solar cells, respectively.2,3 The organic solar cells based on conjugated polymers as donors suffer from inherent disadvantages such as batch to batch variations, broad molecular weight distributions and many difficult steps for purification, which can rule out further improvement of overall performance and device stability.4 On the other hand the conjugated small molecules (SMs) have well defined molecular structures and good batch to batch reproducibility, which make them promising photovoltaic materials as alternatives to polymer donors.5,6 The PCEs of the solution processed organic BHJ based on D–A small molecules as donors have been reached in the range of 8–10%.7
Boron dipyrromethane (BODIPY) based dyes exhibit strong absorption and emission, are thermally stable, and have strong acceptor nature.8 Their photonic properties can be easily tuned by chemical transformation.9 Carbazole derivatives have been extensively studied in optoelectronics owing to their low redox potential, hole transport properties, and strong electron donating ability.10,11 Employing the carbazole donating unit in D–A organic semiconductors, possessing the deeper HOMO energy level, leads to high open circuit voltage (Voc) in organic solar cells.12 Zhang et al. have reported that the introduction of carbazole groups into the BODIPY unit improves the photonic properties, resulting in the remarkable red shifted absorption spectra and better hole transport.13 It was reported that the insertion of a π-linker into the D–A type molecular structure enhances the conjugation and coplanarity of organic semiconductors leading to the increased intramolecular charge transfer and short circuit current Jsc.14
Our research group has shown the effect of different functional groups at the β-pyrrolic position and the meso-position of BODIPY on its photonic properties.15 Recently, we have synthesized three carbazole substituted BODIPY (carbazole connected to the meso position of BODIPY) small molecules and investigated their optical and electrochemical properties.16 We found that the electron donating strength of the carbazole is a direct function of the photophysical properties of carbazole–BODIPY conjugates and showed a strong donor–acceptor interaction through the π-linker. Recently, Zhang et al. have designed star shaped carbazole–BODIPY derivates and used them as donors in BHJ organic solar cells and reported a moderate PCE of 2.70% with a high Voc of 0.85 V.17 Furthermore, the ethynyl π- linker can increase the oxidation potential, hence increasing Voc.18 Recently, Liu et al. have reported a PCE of 3.13% for BODIPY based solution processed solar cells by dimerisation via the meso position.19 Inspired by these excellent properties, we explored the possibilities of carbazole–BODIPY conjugate small molecules (chemical structures are shown in Scheme 1) for their possible applications as donor materials in solution processed BHJ organic solar cells. The meso-alkynylated BODIPYs are highly planar which is reflected from their crystal structure.16 The high planarity ensures strong electronic communication between the meso substituent and BODIPY. There are no reports where carbazoles were substituted at the meso-position of BODIPY via the ethynyl linkage, which is being reported for solar cell applications. The carbazole substituted BODIPYs exhibits a strong D–A character. The donor–acceptor (D–A) interaction in meso alkynylated BODIPY is better as compared to α and β-alkynylated BODIPYs.15 The strong D–A interaction and absorption covering the entire UV-visible region make these molecules promising candidates for the solar cell applications. The BHJ solar cells based on these small molecules showed high Voc in the range of 0.94 to 1.08 V, with overall PCEs of 2.20 to 2.71% with the as cast blend active layer. The PCE has been enhanced up to 5.05% and 4.80% using the TSVA processed 3a:PC71BM and 3c:PC71BM active layers, respectively. The enhanced PCE has been correlated to the more favorable phase separation morphology, balanced charge transport, and light harvesting ability of the active layer, induced by the TSVA treatment.

Experimental details
Device fabrication and characterization
The solution processed BHJ organic solar cells with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al were prepared as follows: The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically and subsequently in aqueous detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone and finally dried under ambient conditions. An aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, clevious PVP, Al 4083) was spin cast on the ITO substrates to obtain a film with thickness of about 40 nm and dried for 10 min at a temperature of 120 °C. The mixture of a donor (3a, 3b or 3c) and PC71BM with weight ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in THF solution (concentration 10 mg mL−1) was prepared and then spin cast onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and dried under ambient conditions. The thickness of the active layer is about 85 nm ± 5 nm. Finally, the aluminum (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask of 20 mm2. All the devices were fabricated and tested under an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The hole-only and electron-only devices with ITO/PEODT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Au and ITO/Al/donor:PC71BM/Al architectures were also fabricated in an analogous way, in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter in dark as well as under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to give the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and the monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
Results and discussion
Thermal, photophysical and electrochemical properties
The thermal stability is a key requirement for organic semiconductors for their applications in optoelectronic devices. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under the nitrogen atmosphere was used to investigate the thermal properties of these small molecules. The decomposition temperatures (Td) for 10% weight loss in 3a, 3b and 3c were estimated as 322, 360 and 368 °C, respectively (Table 1). 3a shows lower thermal stability may be due to the presence of alkyl groups and steric hindrance, whereas, 3b and 3c show similar thermal stability.

The normalized absorption spectra of 3a and 3c in DCM solution are shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. Since 3b shows the similar absorption spectra to 3c, we have not shown the absorption spectra of this molecule and only optical data are given in Table 1. The carbazole–BODIPY conjugates 3a–3c show a strong and sharp absorption band in the wavelength range of 530–550 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient and also exhibits a pronounced shoulder in the 425–520 nm region. 3a shows an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band at around 595 nm, which may be exhibiting due to the strong donor–acceptor interaction between the carbazole donor and the BODIPY acceptor unit20 as compared to 3b and 3c. The strength of the ICT band in these small molecules follows the trend as 3a > 3c > 3b. The absorption spectra of 3a and 3c in a thin film are shown in Fig. 1. Compared to those in DCM solution, their absorption spectra in a thin film become broad and redshifted attributed to the intermolecular interaction between the molecules. The main absorption maxima are at 568 nm, 550 nm and 555 nm for 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively. The ICT band of 3a shifted to 620 nm. The optical bandgaps of these molecules estimated from the onset absorption edge of the absorption spectra in a thin film are about 1.75 eV, 1.94 eV and 1.90 eV, for 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of these small molecules were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry and reported in our earlier report16 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The cyclic voltammogram reveals that the redox peaks are irreversible in nature. The small molecule 3a shows two oxidation and reduction potential waves, whereas 3b and 3c show two oxidation and one reduction waves. The small molecule 3a shows easier oxidation, indicating a strong donor–acceptor interaction compared to 3b and 3c. The trend in the first oxidation potential follows the order 3b > 3c > 3a and supports the strength of the donor–acceptor interaction observed from the optical properties. The onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential relative to the reference energy level of Fc/Fc+ (4.40 eV below the vacuum level) were used to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these small molecules and are compiled in Table 2. In their negative potential region, these molecules exhibited a similar onset reduction potential and LUMO levels are −3.44 eV, −3.44 eV, and −3.46 eV, for 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively. Since the LUMO of the D–A conjugated material is decided by the electron accepting strength of the acceptor unit, identical LUMOs of these molecules are attributed to the same BODIPY acceptor unit. The positive onset oxidation potentials of 3a–3c are different and estimated values of HOMO energy levels are −5.48 eV, −5.54 eV and −5.62 eV for 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively. The different HOMO levels are attributed to the different electron donating ability of carbazole donors. The electrochemical bandgaps are 2.04 eV, 2.10 eV and 2.16 eV, for 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively. The trend of the electrochemical bandgap is similar to that obtained from the optical data. The LUMO energy levels of small molecules (3a, 3b and 3c) are suitable candidates to be used as electron donors when blended with PC71BM in BHJ organic solar cells. The deeper HOMO energy level of these small molecules is desirable for a high Voc21 and we expect a high value of Voc. The energy difference between the LUMO of these small molecules and PC71BM is higher than the exciton binding energy, indicating that efficient exciton dissociation in the D/A interface is present in the active layer.

In order to get more information about the geometry and electronic structure of 3a–3c, density functional theory calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09Wprogram and reported in our earlier paper.16 The theoretically estimated values of HOMO and LUMO are summarized in Table 2. The trend of theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the HOMO–LUMO gap is consistent with the experimentally observed values in the cyclic voltammetry measurement.
Photovoltaic properties
In solution processed BHJ organic solar cells, the performance of the device depends upon the relative amounts of the donor and acceptor materials employed in the photoactive layer and there should be a balance between the absorbance and charge transport within the active layer. The electron transport will be limited, when the active layer is too low, whereas the hole transport capability and absorbance in the active layer will be decreased, when the acceptor content is too high. In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of three donors, devices based on the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ active layer 3a or 3b or 3c:PC71BM/Al were fabricated with various donor to acceptor weight ratios. The detail of the fabrication procedure is given in the experimental section. Since 3b and 3c showed similar results, we have not included the figures for the device based on 3b and only given the data in Table 3. The weight ratio of the donor and the acceptor in the active layer was optimized, and it was found that D:A (1:2) is the optimized ratio of all three donors. We have chosen PC71BM instead of PC61BM as the acceptor since the former has a strong spectral absorption response in the visible region. Fig. 2a and 3a show the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best cells from 3a and 3c as donors in the optimized D:A weight ratio and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The higher value of PCE for the 3a:PC71BM (2.71% with Jsc = 7.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V and FF = 0.38) active layer as compared to 3b:PC71BM (2.24% with Jsc = 6.10 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V and FF = 0.34) and 3c:PC71BM (2.20% with Jsc = 6.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.04 V and FF = 0.34) has been attributed to the higher values of Jsc and FF. The value of Voc for 3b (1.08 V) and 3c (1.04 V) based devices is higher as compared to 3a (0.94 V), which may be attributed to the deeper HOMO levels of 3b and 3c, as Voc in the BHJ organic solar cells is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of acceptor materials used in the BHJ active layer. Still higher Voc can be achieved if the recombination of charge carriers can be suppressed.22 In order to verify the accuracy of the values of Jsc derived from the J–V characteristics, the corresponding IPCE spectra of the devices were measured and shown in Fig. 2b and 3b. The IPCE values are higher for the device based on 3a in the entire wavelength region as compared to that for 3c and closely resemble with the corresponding absorption spectra of the active layer. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectra were 7.38 mA cm−2 and 5.96 mA cm−2 for 3a and 3c based devices, respectively, which agree well with the Jsc values estimated from J–V measurements. Although the absorption near 700 nm is weak, the IPCE value is attributed to the fact that in the longer wavelength region, the electronic transitions are capable of transformation with sufficient efficiency of photons to electrons. The higher value of Jsc for the 3a based device may be attributed to the better absorption profile of the active layer and the low bandgap and higher hole mobility of the donor.23

In addition to the optical absorption and energy levels of the donor material, used in the active layer, charge carrier mobilities and balance charge transport are crucial factors for achieving a high PCE. We have estimated the hole mobility of donors 3a and 3c in the active layers using the J–V characteristics of the hole only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au employing the space charge limited current model.24 As shown in Fig. 4, the hole mobilities were calculated to be 7.84 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.68 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 3a and 3c, respectively. It is well known that the charge transport is limited by the thickness of the active layer. If the thickness is very small, than the FF will improve but the light harvesting ability of the active layer will reduce. Although the thickness of the active layer influences the charge carrier mobility, and we took much care to ensure alike film thickness of the active layer (85 nm ± 5 nm) and avoid substantial influence of this parameter on the devices' charge mobility. The higher hole mobility for 3a illustrates that the structural modification of the carbazole unit has been extended efficiently and its charge transport ability has improved. These results show that the hole mobility of 3a is higher than that for 3c and may be one of the potential reasons for the fact that 3a:PC71BM based devices exhibit higher Jsc and FF than that for 3c based devices.

In order to understand the intermolecular interchain and molecular packing, XRDs were also recorded for the films of 3a and 3c and shown in Fig. 5. Two sharp different peaks were observed in the small angle regions, i.e. 2θ = 4.58° and 2θ = 4.86° for 3c and 3a, respectively, corresponding to interchain d-spacing of 20.16 A and 18.24 A, respectively. The shorter interchain distance indicates that molecules pack closer by inter-digitizing the side chain. The stronger diffraction peak intensity for 3a is likely related to its high degree of crystallinity. Moreover, a broad peak in the wider angle (2θ = 20–25°) is displayed of both 3a and 3c, which is ascribed to the interlayer π–π stacking of the main chain. The higher crystallinity of 3a would increase the intermolecular interaction and facilitate charge carrier mobility and resulted enhancement in Jsc and PCE.

The devices based on the active layer using these three donors processed without any treatment exhibited low PCEs in the range of 2.20–2.71%. Although Voc for these devices is quite high but the poor PCE is mainly related to the low values of both Jsc and the FF. The relatively low hole mobility and the mismatch between the electron and hole mobilities may also be attributed to the low value of the FF in these devices and may also be a factor which limits the Jsc of the BODIPY based small molecule devices.24,25 The low values of the FF and Jsc may also be related to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layer for exciton dissociation and charge transport. In the solution processed BHJ organic solar cell, the absorption of photons by the active layer produces an exciton which must be dissociated into free charge carriers at the donor/acceptor interface present within the active layer. The morphology and phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials should be within the range of exciton diffusion length otherwise the exciton will be lost during its transportation towards the D/A interface.26 Therefore, the exciton dissociation and charge transport strongly depend on the optimized nanoscale morphology and phase separation of the BHJ active layer. In order to improve the morphology of the active layer, strategies such as thermal annealing and use of solvent additives and solid additives have been reported.27 In addition to above, solvent vapor annealing treatment can also help to form the crystalline domains suitable for ambient conditions and improves the overall PCE of the solution processed organic solar cells.28,29 We have used the two step treatment i.e., thermal annealing (TA) treatment followed by the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment for 3a and 3c BODIPY small molecules. In the case of thermal annealing the optimized active layer was thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. For SVA treatment, the active layer was exposed to chloroform vapor for 60 s after the TA treatment. This strategy has been found most suitable to achieve the high PCE for solution processed small molecule organic solar cells.7e,30 For this, first, the BHJ active layer as a cast from THF solution onto the PEDOT:PSS layer was heated on a hotplate at 110 °C for 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the film was placed on a Petri dish containing 200 μL chloroform for solvent vapor annealing for 60 s. The J–V characteristics of the devices with TA and TSVA are shown in Fig. 2a and 3a for 3a and 3c, respectively. After thermal annealing (TA), the devices based on 3a and 3c exhibited PCEs of 3.99% (Jsc = 9.24 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90 V and FF = 0.48) and 3.56% (Jsc = 8.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 and FF = 0.45), respectively. After the TSVA treatment, the performance PCEs were further improved up to 5.05% (Jsc = 10.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90 V and FF = 0.55) and 4.80% (Jsc = 9.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.52), for 3a and 3c based devices, respectively. It was observed that Voc is slightly lower for devices with active layers upon either TA or TSVA treatment. The TA and TSVA treatment leads to an increase in the interaction between the donor and the acceptor thereby influences the reverse saturation current, leading to a decrease in Voc.31 The increase in Jsc and the FF may be originated from the enhanced absorption, better nanoscale morphology of the active layer and more balanced charge transport, induced by the TA and TSVA treatments. The further increase in Jsc with TSVA treatment is attributed to the fact that the solvent vapor can penetrate into the film, allowing the molecules to reorganize for more ordered packing structures.
In order to get information about the enhancement in Jsc, we have measured the IPCE spectra of devices with TA and TSVA treated BHJ active layers and shown in Fig. 2b and 3b. The IPCE spectra of the devices based on TA and TSVA treated active layers show higher values of IPCE throughout the whole wavelength region of measurements. Since Jsc of the BHJ organic solar cell depends on the light harvesting ability of the active layer, we have measured the absorption spectra of the BHJ active layer with TA and TSVA treatment and as cast. As shown in Fig. 6a (for 3a) and 4b (for 3c), in comparison with the spectra of the as cast active layer, the spectra of the devices processed with TA show a red shift and intensity also increased. For the active layer films with further SVA treatment, the overall absorption intensity increased and thus resulting in an improved Jsc. The IPCE spectra of devices closely resemble with the corresponding absorption spectra of the active layers. The calculated Jsc values obtained from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 9.12 mA cm−2 (TA for 3a), 10.08 mA cm−2 (TSVA for 3c), 8.44 mA cm−2 (TA for 3c) and 9.52 mA cm−2 (for TSVA for 3c), and are in close agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V characteristics.

The surface morphology of the 3a:PC71BM thin film processed as cast, TA and TSVA treatments were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from these images that the TA processed film showed better phase separation as compared to the as-cast film and further improved with TSVA treatment. The better nanoscale phase separation and the bicontinuous interpenetrating network contribute to the high exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency resulting in enhancement of Jsc, FF and PCE.25

Moreover, the crystallinity of the active layer is another factor which also affects the charge transport and light harvesting efficiency of the device, thereby affecting the overall performance of BHJ organic solar cells. To get the information about the change in crystallinity of blended active layers processed by different treatments, we have recorded their XRD patterns and shown in Fig. 5b (for 3a:PC71BM only). Similar XRD patterns were also observed for 3c:PC71BM thin films. The cast 3a:PC71BM film shows relatively broad and weak diffraction peaks as compared to the pristine 3a film at 2θ = 4.86°, corresponding to the crystalline domains of 3a. However, in the TA processed film, this diffraction peak becomes narrower as well as more intense. Moreover, the full width at half maxima (FWHM) also reduced. These effects indicate the increase in the ordered crystallinity of 3a in the TA treated blend as compared to the as cast counter part. The intensity of the diffraction peak is seen to further increase with subsequent SVA, i.e. TSVA treatment, leading to further increase in the crystalline nature of the blend. The observed increase in crystalline nature between the active layers processed as cast and those with additional treatments is consistent with the significant increase in the FF. The overall increase in order of the molecular packing improves the IPCE values and is likely to be responsible for increase in Jsc and PCE.
In order to further demonstrate the simultaneous improved charge transport ability and its balance in the active layer, we have measured the hole mobility in the active layer, processed with different treatments, from the J–V characteristics of the hole only devices in dark (Fig. 4a and b) and using the SCLC model. For the TA based devices, the hole mobility increased up to 5.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 3a:PC71BM and 3c:PC71BM, respectively. Additionally, the device based on TSVA processed 3a:PC71BM and 3c PC71BM exhibits higher hole mobilities of 8.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.48 cm2 V−1 s−1 with much more balanced charge transport as shown in Table 3. The balanced charge transport is beneficial for the improved FF. The decrease in series resistance (Rs) and increase in shunt resistance (Rsh), as shown in Table 3, are responsible for the increase in Jsc and the FF in the devices based on the TA and TSVA treated active layers. Although the PCEs of the devices have been significantly improved after the TA and TSVA treatments, the FF is still low. The reasons for the low FF obtained in small molecule donor materials have been previously described by Marks et al.32 and shown that charge carrier extraction at the contacts had been the key to improve the FF of small molecule donor based organic solar cells. In particular, adequate energy level alignment is a requirement to ensure good extraction. Since the HOMO energy levels of these small molecules are quite deeper than PEDOT:PSS (5.0–5.2 eV), the extraction of the holes is not so efficient. It is quite possible that other hole selective layers like MoO3 may be beneficial to improve the contact. The same applies for the low WF contact such as the Al contact which has been processed in air (and measured) and it is known that a thin layer of Al2O3 may be generated under these conditions reducing the extraction ability.
Conclusions
In summary, we have employed three carbazole substituted BODIPY (carbazole connected to the meso position of BODIPY) small molecules as donors along with PC71BM as an electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ solar cells. The BHJ based on these small molecules showed quite high Voc in the range of 0.94–1.08 V, with overall PCEs in the range of 2.20 to 2.71% with as cast active layers. The high Voc attributed to the deeper HOMO levels of these small molecules. The PCEs of solar cells of 3a:PC71BM and 3c:PC71BM active layer processed with TSVA further improved up to 5.05% and 4.80%, respectively. The increase in PCE has been attributed to the enhancement in Jsc and the FF, related to the better phase separation, improved light harvesting ability of the active layer and more balanced charge transport, induced by the TSVA treatment.
