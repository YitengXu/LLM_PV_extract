    , Accepted 4th November 2022First published on 7th November 2022AbstractMicropatterning of metal oxides is of high interest for structuring electrodes in optoelectronic devices. In this work, the impact of infrared (IR) sub-picosecond Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP) on the surface morphology, surface chemistry, optical and electrical properties of Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) is studied. The topography characterization reveals periodic microchannels with an average height between 15 and 600 nm, depending on the applied laser fluence, decorated with Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS). The doping by aliovalent Sn atoms induced by non-linear IR absorption were revealed by X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. An increase in the average diffuse optical transmittance up to 730% was obtained in the spectral range 400–1000 nm as a consequence of the interaction of white light with the periodic micro- and nanostructures. The one-dimensionality of the microstructures caused a significant anisotropic electrical behavior, and an enhancement of the conductivity of up to 50% was obtained following the direction of the microchannels of the patterned films as compared to the unstructured material. Our results demonstrate that DLIP is a powerful technique for future application in structuring electrodes for highly efficient optoelectronic devices and sensors.
Introduction
Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are broadly employed in optoelectronic devices such as photodiodes,1 OLEDs,2 and solar cells, in particular in those based on thin-film inorganic,3,4 perovskite,5–7 Dye-Sensitized (DSSCs)8 and organic materials.9 In these devices, TCOs are normally used as an optical window for visible and Near-Infrared Radiation (NIR) and also as top electrodes. Among the entire universe of TCOs, fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (F:SnO2; FTO) is extensively used in thin film solar cells due to its thermal resistance, electronic compatibility and low cost.10,11 According to several studies, the overall efficiency of optoelectronic devices, especially solar cells, has a strong dependence on both the transparency and sheet resistance (RS) of FTO.12–17 To approach the maximum theoretical efficiency of solar cells,18 different strategies involving surface modification strategies of FTO thin films have been studied. In this direction, previous works have sought to increase the total transmittance (Ttot),19 to enhance the optical path by scattering the incident light (Tdiff),20 or to reduce the sheet resistance through the modification of the FTO microstructure by laser ablation,21 laser annealing,22 or by changing the fluorine doping concentration.23
In regards to surface modification using laser radiation, Li et al. achieved an increase in the crystallite sizes of SnO2 particles of ∼75% by annealing FTO thin films with a 532 nm nanosecond pulsed laser.24 This resulted in an averaged Ttot of ∼84% in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm which represents a relative increase of 20% compared to untreated samples and a decrease in RS of approximately 21%. In another work, An et al. structured FTO thin films using a 355 nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser system at different laser fluence levels.25 The power conversion efficiency of DSSCs fabricated with the patterned electrodes was up to ∼10% (relative) higher compared to the reference devices.
An approach for achieving surface periodic structures in the micro- and nano-scale that has been trending in the last decade is a technique known as Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP).26 By overlapping two or more laser beams, an interference pattern can be transferred to the surface of the irradiated material and thus, modify its geometry through laser ablation.27–29 Specifically, in TCOs, Ring et al. performed a two-beam interference DLIP process on 450 nm thick Al-doped ZnO by employing a 355 nm picosecond laser source to obtain U-shaped grooves with a spatial period of 860 nm.30 The structured TCO was used as a front contact in a silicon tandem-based solar cell and obtained a 10% relative increase in efficiency as an outcome. Additionally, Berger et al. employed two-beam nanosecond DLIP with ultraviolet (UV) sources (266 and 355 nm) to structure boron-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:B) films.31 They achieved a ∼30% (relative) enhancement on Ttot and Tdiff mainly around the 400 nm wavelength as a result of the generated grooves with a spatial period of 1.5 μm. Additional remarkable DLIP studies about the structuring of TCOs were reported by other authors.32–35 A common aspect among all these works is that UV laser sources were employed, which tend to have higher costs in terms of laser power (€ per W) and long-term stability issues (especially at 266 nm).36–38 To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies were published in which DLIP was employed to modify the optoelectronic characteristics of TCOs using stable and cost-effective IR laser sources.20,39 For instance, Zhang et al. structured FTO thin films with a 1030 nm femtosecond laser, obtaining birefringence properties. The fabrication of nanogrooves with a spatial period of ∼300 nm was achieved and the birefringence (Δn) reached a value of 0.20. Finally, our previous work was focused on structuring FTO by DLIP with IR (1064 nm) radiation from a ps-laser source (12 ps). The results indicated that a trade-off between optical transparency and electrical conductivity of the FTO film has to be found for optimizing the optoelectronic properties of a given device. As suggested in that work, a better compromise between optical and electrical properties can be achieved by using shorter pulse durations to induce cold ablation, which ultimately would lead to well-defined grooves with a minimum amount of debris.
In the present study, FTO films were treated with two-beam DLIP based on infrared sub-picosecond laser radiation. The changes in surface topography and chemistry induced by the laser radiation were analyzed, as well as the modification of the optical and electrical properties. In particular, optical transmittance in the 400–1000 nm region and sheet resistance as a function of the laser fluence were studied.
Experimental details
DLIP of FTO films
FTO films (550 nm thick) deposited on 25 × 20 × 3 mm3 glass substrates (XOP Física, Spain) were structured by the DLIP technique. Before the laser treatment, the surfaces were cleaned with ethanol and dried with compressed air. A DLIP workstation (developed by Fraunhofer IWS and TU Dresden, Germany) equipped with a sub-picosecond solid-state laser (LXR 100-1030, Luxinar GmbH, Germany) with a maximum average output power of 100 W at a pulse frequency of 1 MHz was used to pattern the FTO substrates. The laser operated at a wavelength λL of 1030nm with a pulse duration of 900 ± 100 fs and a repetition rate of 100kHz. The DLIP optical module consists of a telescope system that acts as a beam expander, and a diffractive optical element (DOE) that splits the main laser beam into two sub-beams which are then parallelized by a prism and focused on the sample by a convergent lens. The sample was translated in two-dimensional directions (x and y) by a mechanical stage (Aerotech PRO280LM (x-axis), PRO225LM (y-axis) and Aerotech PRO165LM (z-axis), USA) with a calibrated accuracy ±1 μm, resolution (min. incremental motion) 5 nm and a bidirectional repeatability of ±0.4 μm. An overlap of 99% was used between subsequent laser spots and a two-beam interference angle θ was set to 9.84°, which resulted in a spatial period Λ of 6.0 μm. The hatch distance hd, which is the lateral distance between spots, was set to 24 μm, while the fluence per pulse was varied from 0.42–0.73J cm−2. A total of 10 samples for each value of fluence were fabricated.
Characterization methods
In order to measure the surface topography of the structured FTO samples, an Atomic Force Microscope was used (AFM, Nanosurf AG, Switzerland) employing the dynamic force mode with a tip radius of 10 nm. The surface profiles and height average values of the topographies were obtained using SensoMAP Advanced Analysis Software (Sensofar, Spain) with rectangular elements of 60 × 60 μm length and by making an average of 20 different profiles at different cross-section positions. In addition, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Quattro ESEM, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Germany) analysis was performed at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV and the results were analyzed with Gwyddion software.40 Moreover, to carry out X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy the samples were transferred to an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (ESCALAB 250Xi by Thermo Scientific, base pressure: 2 × 10−10 mbar), and then the measurements were carried out using an XR6 monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and a pass energy of 20 eV. Finally, Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM) measurements were performed (Dimension FastScan® Brucker, UK). The equipment was operated by Current–Voltage spectroscopy mode by keeping the probe (SCM-PIT-V2, Bruker, USA) at a fixed distance of 1 μm above the sample surface to avoid the effects of atomic interactions. First measurement was performed at the resting voltage (0.00 V). Then, adjusting the probe voltage to the negative value (−6.00 V), a second measurement was performed. The resulting images were then analyzed using NanoScope Analysis.
Diffuse and total transmittances along with total reflectance were measured using a UV-NIR spectrometer (HR 2000+, Ocean Optics, USA) with an integrating sphere (Thorlabs IS236A-4, Germany). As a reference, a Spectralon white standard was employed. For the transmittance measurements, the samples were placed between the collimated white light from the lamp and the integrating sphere. With the remaining ports closed, the total transmittance is thus measured with the photospectrometer. In turn, for measuring the diffuse transmittance, the output port that is located in the direction of propagation of the collimated beam was left open, allowing the direct transmitted light to leave the sphere. In this way, only the diffuse light is collected by the photospectrometer. Finally, electrical characterization of the structured samples was performed with the four-point probe method (gold coated tips, Coda Systems Ltd., UK), using an electrometer (Sourcemeter 2450, Keithley, USA), and performing two types of measurements, one in the direction of the pattern (longitudinal) and the other one perpendicular (transversal) to the direction of the pattern. A total of 10 measurements for each mode was performed for statistical significance. A first estimation of the film resistance R was obtained by evaluating the ratio between the measured voltage V and the injected current I. To obtain the appropriate value for RS a correction factor of ∼0.90 was applied according to the National Bureau of Standards Technical Note 199 and considering the probe spacing (∼1.8 mm) along with the size of the sample (∼5 cm2).41 This adjustment is needed as the proximity of boundaries could limit the current paths in the sample. The values of RS were then approximated using the expression RS = 4.5 × 0.90 × R.
Results and discussion
Topography evolution upon laser structuring
In order to calculate the laser fluence levels that were applied in the experiments as well as the threshold fluence (Fth) of FTO and spot diameter (2ω0) on the sample, the D2 method was used,42 yielding the values Fth = 0.41 ± 0.01 J cm−2 and ω0 = 89.50 ± 2 μm. Comparing the value of Fth obtained in our previous work using 12 ps pulses (∼1.10 J cm−2),20 a 63% lower value was obtained with 0.9 ps pulses. This finding is in agreement with previous research on diverse materials such as copper, silicon, gelatin or borosilicate glass, that had determined the direct relationship between the threshold fluence and the pulse duration.43,44
In Fig. 1(a)–(h), the topography of DLIP-treated FTO thin films characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) along with selected height profiles as a function of fluence (see caption) are displayed. In all cases, line-like structures with a spatial period of 6.0 μm can be observed. For higher values of laser fluence (Fig. 1(a)–(d)), well-defined microchannels with an average height between 300 and 600 nm were obtained. The quality of these structures is reflected in the smoothness of the profile shown in Fig. 1(g) with an average height of ∼300 nm which corresponds to an applied laser fluence of 0.52 J cm−2. For lower values of laser fluence, less homogeneous microstructures were achieved (Fig. 1(e)–(f)). Nevertheless, the line-like pattern could still be distinguished as it is illustrated in the profile of Fig. 1(h) with an average height of ∼15 nm. No significant differences in the topography were observed between the samples fabricated with the same fluence level. The average structure height as a function of the applied laser fluence is shown in Fig. 2.

To contrast the obtained threshold fluence value calculated previously by the D2 method, a logarithmic fit using eqn (1) was performed using the measured average height of the microstructures (h) and the applied laser fluence (F):45 (1)This fitting, shown as a red line in Fig. 2, allows determining an approximation of the laser fluence threshold Fth of the FTO and the ratio 1/α where α is the absorption coefficient. The logarithmic fitting curve yielded Fth = 0.40 ± 0.01 J cm−2 and 1/α = 1.11 ± 0.07 μm, the former being in excellent agreement with the prior estimation of the value obtained by the D2 method (0.41 ± 0.01 J cm−2). On the other hand, the value found for 1/α differs significantly from the results of previous investigations (1/α@1030nm ∼2–10 μm).46–48 A possible explanation for the lower value obtained in this study might be related to the non-linear response of FTO towards sub-ps IR laser radiation. Previous research indicated that the presence of non-linear effects is a phenomenon worth considering on TCO thin films when ultrashort pulsed lasers are used.20,49
SEM images together with the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT) spectrum of selected samples treated with different fluence levels are shown in Fig. 3. Tilted images of structured FTO with 6.0 μm of spatial period and laser fluence of (a) F = 0.73 and (b) 0.52 J cm−2 can be observed. The formation of Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) can be seen in the valleys of the texture which is in coincidence with the maxima positions of the interference pattern. In Fig. 3(c) and (d) the distribution of LIPSS perpendicular to the polarization of the laser (indicated with the double arrow in Fig. 3(d)) can be observed. The absolute value of the FFT applied to Fig. 3(c) and (d), is illustrated in Fig. 3(e) and (f), respectively, showing the characteristic double-crescent shapes of LIPSS.50 From the position of these features in the image, the spatial periods of the LIPSS can be calculated, yielding 190 ± 40 nm and 200 ± 40 nm for the sample structured with a fluence of 0.73 and 0.52 J cm−2, respectively.

Zhu et al.51 carried out a theoretical-experimental study to gain insights into the non-linear optical response of FTO thin films in the NIR region. The results showed an increase in the response of non-linear absorption, particularly in the 1400–1650 nm range. If this multi-photonic effect is taken into consideration for 1030 nm (keeping in mind the mismatch of the previously calculated ratio 1/α), a wavelength three times smaller (meaning a three-photon absorption mechanism with λ ≈ 343 nm) might be the main contribution involving both the laser ablation and the LIPSS formation processes. Then, the ratio between LIPSS spatial period and the 3rd laser wavelength harmonic is between ∼0.4–0.6, which makes it difficult to classify these features as High (HSFL) or Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS (LSFL).52,53 On the other hand, taking into consideration the orientation of the LIPSS (which are perpendicular to the polarization), the generated LIPSS could be classified as Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS. In this context, it is worth mentioning the work by Zhang et al., where femtosecond laser irradiation was applied in FTO thin films at different wavelengths. In that study, LIPSS features with a spatial period of 300 nm were obtained at a wavelength of 1030 nm, while irregular HSFL with a spatial period of 126 nm could be obtained when using a 343 nm laser wavelength.39 In addition, studies carried out by Scorticati et al.54,55 showed the formation of LIPSS when SnO2 thin films were structured with a 343 nm ps-laser (6.7 ps). In these works, the authors reported that as the LIPSS had a spatial period in the range of 50–80 nm, i.e. less than half the wavelength of the laser, and that they are oriented parallel to the laser polarization, the observed LIPSS can be classified as HSFL. In consequence, although the findings in this study seem not to be rigorously supported by the available data in the literature about LIPSS formation on FTO films, it can be assumed that the observed LIPSS can be regarded as LSFL. However, more experiments are needed to explain the mechanism involved in the formation of LIPSS by sub-ps and fs infrared laser irradiation.
Optical characterization
To characterize the optical properties of structured FTO, total (Ttot) and diffuse transmittances (Tdiff) along with total reflectance (Rtot) and absorbance (A), defined as A = 100% − Ttot − Rtot, in the 400–1000 nm spectral range were measured. Overall, the total transmittance for patterned FTO is lower than that of the flat reference in the 400–650 nm range, in particular as shown in Fig. 4(a), the range of 400–500 nm appears to be heavily affected by the laser structuring. On the other hand, in the 650–1000 nm range, all the patterned films have a larger Ttot compared to the untreated sample, which could boost photon harvesting in photoelectronic devices in the near-infrared spectrum or improve light outcoupling for light-emitting diodes. In addition, Tdiff improves remarkably after the DLIP treatment, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Particularly, the film treated with a laser fluence of 0.73 J cm−2 exhibited the highest Tdiff in the whole spectrum, exceeding 50% in the 600–1000 nm range. However, as can be seen in Fig. 4(c), the increment in absorption in the 400–700 nm range is the cause of the loss in Ttot which could imply not only a modification on the surface geometry due to the DLIP process but also a change in the surface chemistry.
 Fig. 4  (a) Total transmittance, reflectance, (b) diffuse transmittance, and (c) absorption of structured FTO films for selected fluence values (continuous lines). The dotted line indicates the value for untreated FTO. 

Table 1 shows the average transmittances, reflectance, and absorbance, obtained as a function of the fluence in the 400–1000 nm spectral range. It is clear that although a reduction of the average reflectance was observed for all of the treated samples (up to 28% relative reduction for F = 0.66 J cm−2), the increase in absorbance is the main cause of the decrease in total transmittance in the 400–700 nm range. Nevertheless, an increase of up to 730% is observed in the average diffuse transmittance as a result of the surface patterning. Similar Ttot and Tdiff behavior were obtained in our previous study in which FTO thin films were structured with 12 ps infrared (1064 nm) DLIP. Total transmittance underwent a decrease in the 400–700 nm range and an increase in the 700–1000 nm range while diffuse transmittance reached an increment of up to 870% (relative) compared to unstructured FTO.20 The lower Tdiff obtained in this work might be related to the larger spatial period set on this experiment compared to our previous study (6 μm vs. 5 μm), implying a decrease in the structure aspect ratio (height to period ratio) and thus an overall decrease of the scattered and diffracted angles. In addition, former studies obtained also an enhancement of the diffuse transmittance through topography modifications. For instance, Wu et al.56 etched SnO2 films in a diluted HCl bath with varying concentrations of Cr. The authors reported a maximum diffuse transmittance of approximately 70% at a wavelength of 400 nm, which decreases to below 50% for the spectral range 600–800 nm. In another study, Scorticati et al.54 patterned FTO with LIPSS using a ps-pulsed laser and obtained an enhancement in the haze factor. However, the diffuse transmittance was below 15% in the visible and near-infrared spectra, probably due to the low structure height (arithmetic roughness Ra = 42 nm) of the LIPSS. Other works have shown how to grow FTO films on glass substrates with tuned roughness using methods like atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition or spray pyrolysis, so that they can achieve significant diffuse transmittances without the need for further patterning steps. Nonetheless, the results showed that in the spectral range of 700–1000 nm, where thin film solar cells normally suffer from a reduce absorption, the diffuse transmittance lies below 20%.19,57,58

A photograph of selected samples showing optical appearance differences can be seen in Fig. 5. These samples correspond to untreated (left side), treated with F = 0.73 J cm−2 (center) and F = 0.44 J cm−2 (right side). It can be observed that for the treated samples, the higher the fluence the stronger the yellowish coloration of the material which might imply a change on its chemistry. It is expected that the change in coloration is due to chemical changes in the bulk of the FTO as this thin film has an initial thickness of 550 nm, significantly lower than the calculated optical penetration depth of 1/α = 1.1 μm. Such finding was also observed by several studies that have reported a change in the color after annealing or hydrogen plasma treatment in FTO thin films which resulted in a higher absorption near the UV region.59–61 In addition, this further supports the previous statement suggesting the presence of multi-photon absorption since this process involves high energy (3–4 eV) photochemical reactions which favor changes in the chemistry of materials. In contrast, linear absorption of IR photon induces melting o ablation of material mainly by photothermal processes.62

Chemistry changes in the surface of FTO films were investigated by XPS analysis. In Fig. 6, deconvoluted XPS spectra corresponding to the orbitals O 1s (a) and Sn 3d5/2 (b) for untreated FTO (top rows) and structured FTO at a fluence of F = 0.44 J cm−2 (bottom rows) are displayed. The O 1s spectrum of the untreated and structured FTO presents high asymmetry and consists of four distinct species. The highest binding energy peak (OI) is associated with the O in metal carbonates (C–O–M) or molecularly chemisorbed H2O and is located for the untreated (structured) sample at 533.6 eV (533.9 eV). The peak located at 532.2 eV (532.7 eV) (OII) corresponds to surface hydroxyl groups. The peak positioned at 531.1 eV (531.2 eV) (OIII), is associated with oxygen in the proximity of oxygen vacancies. Finally, the lowest binding energy peak at 530.7 eV (O–Sn2+), also represents oxygen bonded to tin atoms.63 Comparing FTO samples before and after laser treatment, changes in the peak positions and relative intensity values can be observed. The increase in the O–Sn2+ signal might be related to aliovalent doping by tin atoms,64 being a consequence of the interaction between the multi-photon absorption of the sub-picosecond IR radiation (which can be effectively considered as UV radiation with a wavelength of 343 nm) and the surface of FTO. On the other hand, the Sn 3d5/2 main peak for the untreated (structured) sample is located at 487.1 eV (487.3 eV) and both were deconvoluted in two species in agreement with prior studies.60,65 The high binding energy peak is related to tin atoms at 4+ and 2+ oxidation states, while the low binding energy peak is associated with neutral tin atoms (Sn0).66 The variation of the sub-peak intensities after the laser treatment is in agreement with the doping by Sn2+, which could induce the yellowish color of the FTO structured surfaces. Furthermore, this observation is also in agreement with a theoretical-experimental study in which the doping by Sn atoms implied a shifting in the band-gap energy of SnO2 from 3.64 eV (undoped) to 1.55 eV (Sn-doped).64

Electrical characterization
With the aim of performing a qualitative electrical evaluation of generated microchannels, Electrostatic Force Microscopy was performed on structured FTO with F = 0.73 J cm−2, and its results are illustrated in Fig. 7. With this technique, locally electric trapped charges can be detected by measuring the phase shift of the oscillating movement of the probe.67 An AFM image of alternating valleys (brown color) and ridges (yellow) of the line-like texture (F = 0.73 J cm−2) can be seen in Fig. 7(a) while its phase shift measurement for a sample potential of −6 V (top) and 0 V (bottom) can be seen in Fig. 7(b). A notable phase difference can be observed between the structured and the unstructured zones. This might be a consequence of the difference in the surface height since the electromagnetic force that the probe measurement depends on the distance between the sample and the probe.68 Thus, an integrated profile measure was performed perpendicular to the direction of the pattern and its phase difference is illustrated in Fig. 7(c). A slight variation in the phase between the sample at −6 V and at 0 V can be noticed, in the structured region (ablated area), a change in the phase up to 1° was obtained while for the unstructured zone near 4° of variation was measured. This phase difference can be related to locally stored electric charges which are closely linked to the local conductivity.68,69 Then, the regions which were modified at the interference maxima positions are expected to have little to no stored charges and thus high resistivity due to the removal (or partial removal) of the conductive layer.

On the other hand, a quantitative characterization of the modified electrical properties of the structured FTO was performed through sheet resistance measurements with the four-point probe method as a function of laser fluence. The results are shown in Fig. 8 for transversal and longitudinal measurement modes (see section Characterization Methods for details). For a laser fluence of F = 0.42 J cm−2 no significant changes compared to the flat sample were observed as this value of fluence is close to the measured material's fluence threshold. For fluence levels between 0.44 and 0.59 J cm−2 a rising trend of RS with the laser fluence was observed in both directions as a result of the partial removal of conductive material. Differently, at higher fluence values (0.66 and 0.73 J cm−2) a clear anisotropic behavior in the electrical response is observed due to the formation of well-defined microchannels that present elevated conductivity in the unprocessed zones while the structured lines behave almost like a perfect insulator giving, as a result, a ratio between transversal and longitudinal sheet resistances of RStrans/RSlong ∼ 2 × 104 for F = 0.66 J cm−2 and ∼ 1 × 108 for F = 0.73 J cm−2. This is in agreement with the AFM measurements shown in Fig. 1, in which the average depth for the two highest values of laser fluence is greater than 550 nm, which is the estimated thickness of the FTO conductive layer. This anisotropic behavior was also observed for Indium-doped Tin Oxide (ITO) patterned with line-like textures using a 1030 nm femtosecond laser.70 The results showed the formation of microchannels with anisotropic electrical properties in which total insulation was obtained in the transversal direction.

Since the tips of the four-point probe have a ∼0.5 mm diameter, future experiments with a microscopic four-point probe should be carried out to measure the electrical properties of the microwires more accurately since the generated microstructures’ size and roughness could affect the outcome of the technique.71 Another alternative might be employing a four-point probe whereby the distance between the tips is shorter since the area affected by the injected current is proportional to the distance between the tips. Thus a smaller area could be analyzed by performing this experiment to retrieve local information from the micropatterned region.72
Conclusions
In this study, the morphological, chemical, optical, and electrical modifications induced by Direct Laser Interference Patterning based on an infrared sub-picosecond-pulsed source on FTO thin films were evaluated. As the laser fluence increased from 0.42 J cm−2 to 0.73 J cm−2, the FTO film progressed from a slight surface modification to the development of well-defined microchannels along with the formation of LIPSS with spatial periods between 130 and 200 nm. A yellowish color was observed after laser treatment as a consequence of the doping by aliovalent Sn atoms induced by the multi-photonic absorption in the FTO film. Nevertheless, a remarkable increase in diffuse transmittance up to 730% was achieved as a result of the diffraction of incoming light into several diffraction orders by the periodic texture. Additionally, the electrical sheet resistance showed a relative decrease of up to 50% for higher values of laser fluence given by the formation of conductive microwires with anisotropic electrical properties.
On the one hand, the enhancement of the scattering of light might benefit optoelectronic devices by increasing the absorbance in the active material, particularly for those devices based on photoactive materials with an optical bandgap in the NIR spectrum. On the other hand, the increase in the effective surface area by the formation of micro- and nanostructures might be beneficial for a more effective charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte in the DSSCs.
