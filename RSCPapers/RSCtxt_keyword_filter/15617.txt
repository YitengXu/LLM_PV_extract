    , Accepted 27th March 2018First published on 28th March 2018AbstractWe report on the synthesis, as well as photophysical and electrochemical characterization of a new family of pentacene derivatives, which are applied in n-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As far as the molecular structure of the pentacene is concerned, the synthetic design focuses on cyano acrylic tethered at the 13-position of the pentacene chromophore. The electrolyte composition features increasing amounts of Li+ ions as an additive. In general, the increase of Li+ concentrations extrinsically reduces the quasi Fermi level of the photoanode and as such facilitates the electron injection process. We demonstrate that pentacene derivatives give rise to a unique charge injection process, which is controlled by the positioning of the quasi Fermi level energies as a function of the Li+ concentration. As a result of the enhanced charge injection, device efficiencies as high as 1.5% are achieved, representing a 3-fold increase from previously reported efficiencies in pentacene-based DSSCs. These findings are supported by device analysis in combination with transient absorption and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy assays.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are considered as a mature solar energy conversion technology.1–3 The interest lies in their low-cost fabrication along with their high device efficiencies.4–6 One of the most essential components is the sensitizer, which is responsible for light-harvesting and, in turn, the generation of photocurrent.7 As of today, a myriad of sensitizers have been used in DSSCs,8–10 reaching the maximum power conversion efficiencies of 11% and 14% for a single dye11 and a mixture of dyes,12,13 respectively. Despite the major efforts, the scale-up synthesis of both types of sensitizers is limited mainly by cost constraints.14,15 Thus, there is growing interest in searching for new metal-free and easy-to-prepare organic sensitizers.7,14–17 The main design aspects involve: (i) anchors to provide an efficient electronic coupling between the sensitizer and the semiconducting electrode, (ii) broad absorption features, (iii) the presence of bulky substituents to prevent electron recombination across the electrode/electrolyte interface, and (iv) a push–pull design to simultaneously facilitate electron injection and dye regeneration.9,10,18,19
In this context, the acene family, that is anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene, has recently been investigated due to the ease of control of their electron mobilities and absorption features associated with the π-extended conjugation, as well as the well-known synthetic protocols to chemically functionalize the acene core with bulky groups, anchors, and push–pull moieties.20–22 In addition, several theoretical studies have promoted their use as sensitizers in DSSCs.23–25 In view of these promising features, it is surprising that only of a few studies have focused on using acenes as π-conjugated linkers in porphyrin sensitizers for the state-of-the-art acene-based DSSCs,26–28 while devices with tetracenes and pentacenes have poorly performed in terms of both charge injection and regeneration.29–32 For instance, the maximum solar energy conversion efficiencies of around 0.3% have been achieved in pentacene-based DSSCs.29 Here, we address two critical aspects related to DSSCs, namely (i) understanding the impact of the sensitizer design on the charge injection and recombination kinetics, since there are significant differences in electronic density delocalization upon functionalization at the 6- and 13-positions rather than the 1- and 8- or 2- and 9-positions,20,21,33,34 and (ii) design of new semiconducting electrodes with tailored quasi Fermi levels to enhance charge injection.
To shed light on these aspects, this work provides a comprehensive study involving the syntheses, as well as spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization, as well as device optimization of four new pentacene dyes substituted at the 6-position with a triisopropylsilylethynyl group for the purpose of steric stabilization and the 13-position with linkers that differ in length to allow fine control of the charge injection. As far as the device design is concerned, the charge injection process has been further optimized through both extrinsic doping of the semiconducting electrode with Li+ ions present in the electrolyte and using indium–zinc–oxide electrodes (IZO), in which the indium doping content allows control of the quasi Fermi level of the electrodes.38
As the most relevant finding, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) in concert with incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) assays reveal a unique charge injection behavior in pentacene-based DSSCs. In short, an inefficient electron injection takes place from the triplet excited state formed via intersystem crossing with and without Li+ doping. As such, short-circuit currents (Jsc) are greatly increased without affecting either recombination or regeneration processes. This leads to enhanced DSSCs featuring efficiencies of around 1.5%, which represents a 3-fold enhancement compared to the current state-of-the-art pentacene-based DSSCs.29 To the best of our knowledge, the unforeseen electron injection from triplet excited states and modulation thereof upon increasing Li+ concentrations in the electrolyte are unprecedented design aspects that need to be considered toward developing highly efficient pentacene-based DSSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
All four pentacene derivatives DPV1–4 were synthesized via a stepwise synthetic pathway, as depicted in Scheme 1. The main features of this route include the assembly of aldehydes 1–4 as precursors to the desired sensitizers/dyes, followed by introduction of cyanoacrylic acid via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to give DPV1–4. The synthesis of aldehydes 1 and 2 has been reported.39 The synthesis of aldehyde 3 required protection of the aldehyde group of 5-bromo-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde as the corresponding acetal to give 5. Lithium-halogen exchange with n-BuLi and 5 was followed by addition of lithiated 5 to ketone 6. Subsequent quenching of the reaction with saturated aqueous NH4Cl gave the intermediate diol 7, which was directly subjected to reductive elimination using tin(II) chloride and a diluted acid (H2SO4). In the presence of the acid, the acetal protecting group was also cleaved, to give the desired aldehyde 3 as a dark blue crystalline solid in 76% yield. The structure of 3 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis (see the ESI† for details). Aldehyde 4 was synthesized using a Sonogashira cross coupling reaction of terminal acetylene 8 with 2-bromo-5-thiophene-carboxaldehyde, to give the dimethylether intermediate 9. After workup, the crude product 9 was directly subjected to reductive elimination to give 4 as a cyan-green solid in 82% yield.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic pathways towards DPV1–4. 
The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of aldehydes 1–4 was accomplished through adaptation of published procedures using cyanoacetic acid and piperidine in the absence of light. Aqueous workup and solvent removal, followed by washing the product in pentane under ultrasonication gave pentacene cyanoacrylic acids DPV1–4 in yields of 74–86%. In solutions exposed to ambient light and air, the onset of decomposition is typically observed in ca. three to six hours (by TLC and/or color change), while in deoxygenated solutions the stability is extended to several days without noticeable decomposition.
As far as the acetylene spacer is concerned, its presence or absence changes the relative distance between the acene and the anchor by ca. 0.26 Å. The thienyl ring allows a conjugated, planar arrangement with the pentacene core in DPV3, whereas the phenyl ring enforces a non-planar, perpendicular (decoupled) orientation due to steric hindrance in DPV1. Finally, the cyanoacrylic acid anchor facilitates electron injection into the semiconductor and guarantees stability.
2.2 Photophysical properties

2.2.1 Steady-state spectroscopic assays. 
The pentacene derivatives DPV1–4 show strong absorption features in the visible range of the spectrum. In particular, DPV1 features two distinct transitions, namely the first and second singlet excited states centered at 550–650 and 400–500 nm, respectively. The strongest maximum is discernable at 622–623 nm with an extinction coefficient of 15300 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 1). In comparison with DPV1, the presence of the acetylenic linker of DPV2 red-shifts the absorption features with the strongest absorption at 665 nm and an extinction coefficient of 25000 M−1 cm−1. A similar trend is found for thienyl derivatives DPV3 and DPV4, where long wavelength absorption maxima at 625 and 677 nm and extinction coefficients of 19000 and 23400 M−1 cm−1, respectively, are noted. Finally, the adsorption onto TiO2 thin films leads to similar absorption spectra to those in solution, but red-shifted by up to 15 nm due to the electronic interactions with the semiconductor rather than aggregation on the surface (Fig. 1). All of the aforementioned aspects impact the excited state energetics and dynamics with the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LOMOs), which are more evenly distributed in DPV4 than in DPV3 – both the HOMO and LUMO were calculated using the TURBOMOLE package “B3LYP//def2-TZVP”. In both cases, the electron density in the HOMO is centered on the pentacene. In DPV3, the cyanoacrylic acid anchor lacks any appreciable electron density, which contrasts the finding for DPV4, in which the electron density spans across the pentacene, the acetylene spacer, the thiophene bridge, and the cyanoacrylic acid anchor. Similar observations were made for the LUMOs (Fig. S2†).

2.2.2 Spectroelectrochemical assays. 
Spectroelectrochemistry in solution was performed to investigate the optical characteristics of DPV1–4 upon oxidation. Fig. 2 presents the characteristic absorption spectra of DPV1–4 with and without applied oxidative potentials. A common feature for DPV1–4 is an evolving fingerprint in the near infrared region of the absorption spectra. For DPV1 and DPV3, these are maxima at 976 and 956 nm, respectively, while for DPV2 and DPV4 the maxima are located at 946 and 942 nm, respectively.

2.2.3 Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic assays with aluminum oxide films. 
To obtain insight into the excited state features and kinetics of DPV3 and DPV4 at the semiconductor interfaces, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) measurements were performed with samples immobilized on Al2O3 thin films (Fig. 3). To this end, Al2O3 with a wide band-gap of 7.2 eV vs. vacuum and a conduction band energy of 2.9 V vs. NHE, precludes electron injection from the excited states of DPV3 and DPV4.

Lower left parts – Population of the species shown in the upper right, illustrating the excited state dynamics. Lower right parts – Differential absorption changes (visible) obtained with several time delays between 0 and 7500 ps. 
In the case of DPV3@Al2O3 with an excitation wavelength of 610 nm, transient maxima are observed at 452 and 510 nm in addition to ground state bleaching at 595 and 645 nm. We assign the two maxima to a short-lived singlet excited state and a long-lived triplet excited state of DPV3, respectively, as they transform via intersystem crossing (ISC) on a timescale of 8.3 ± 0.5 ps (1.21 × 1011 s−1). For DPV4@Al2O3, the long-lived component with a transient maximum at 507 nm and ground state bleaching at 650 and 700 nm is found to be formed with 10.8 ± 1 ps (5.6 × 1010 s−1). Kinetic analysis yields 164 ± 10 ps (6.1 × 109 s−1) and 2950 ± 100 ps (3.4 × 108 s−1), which are assigned to the triplet recombination at interphase traps and recovery of the ground state, respectively. Very similar dynamics were found for DPV4@Al2O3: 116 ± 10 ps (8.6 × 109 s−1), and 4860 ± 100 ps (2.6 × 108 s−1) for the triplet recombination at the interface and the decay of the triplet excited state, respectively. Interestingly, the larger distance between the pentacene in DPV4 and Al2O3 slows down the excited state deactivation.


2.2.4 Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic assays with titanium dioxide films. 
The scenario for DPV3 and DPV4 immobilized onto TiO2 is fundamentally different, owing to a band-gap of 3.2 eV vs. vacuum and a conduction band energy of 0.7 V vs. NHE (Fig. 4). For these experiments, devices featuring a 1 μm thick photoelectrode were doctor bladed and afterwards sintered as described in the Experimental section. The latter were then immersed in the respective pentacene solution and, subsequently, used as working electrodes in conjunction with platinum-based counter electrodes. The devices were then completed with a solvent-based electrolyte – see the Experimental section for details. In this case, photo-induced charge separation between the dye and the semiconductor is likely to take place. Based on an intersystem crossing (ISC), as documented in DPV3@Al2O3 and DPV4@Al2O3, it is the triplet excited state, which is expected to dominate the interfacial charge injection. For DPV3@TiO2 and DPV4@TiO2, a maximum at 510 nm and minima at 595 and 650 nm were noted. Injection of charges was monitored by following the spectroscopic signature of the one-electron oxidized form of DPV3 and DPV4 in the NIR part of the spectrum.40 For example, DPV3@TiO2 gives rise to maxima at 843, 911, and 1021 nm, while maxima evolve at 860 and 918 nm for DPV4@TiO2. The transient signals in the NIR are in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic features recorded upon spectroelectrochemical oxidation of DPV3 and DPV4 on TiO2 (Fig. 4). From the latter, ISC were derived as 6.0 ± 0.5 ps (1.7 × 1011 s−1) and 17.0 ± 1.0 ps (6.3 × 1010 s−1) for DPV3@TiO2 and DPV4@TiO2, respectively. Following the initial ISC and injection of charges, charge recombination/recovery of the ground state takes place in 207 ± 10 ps (4.9 × 109 s−1) and >5000 ps (<2.0 × 108 s−1) for DPV3@TiO2 and 171 ± 10 ps (5.9 × 109 s−1) and >5000 ps (<2.0 × 108 s−1) for DPV4@TiO2, respectively.

2.3 Device fabrication and characterization

2.3.1 Device analyses. 
To ensure a complete coverage of the TiO2-based electrodes, time-dependent adsorption experiments were performed with DPV1–4 in solutions of THF at a concentration of 4.0 × 10−5 M (Fig. 5 and S1†) on 5 μm thick photoelectrodes. Although different adsorption times are required to fully cover the electrode surfaces, we selected 90 min as the standard.41–45 Importantly, neither broadening nor red-shifts in the absorption maxima were noted, suggesting the lack of aggregates during the adsorption process (Fig. 1 and 5). To finalize the device, a platinum counter-electrode and iodine-based electrolytes featuring 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide 99%, 0.05 M iodine doubly sublimed, x M lithium iodide (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (96% in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile 85:15 v/v) were utilized.

(b) Absorption spectra of TiO2 based electrodes with DPV3 after 1 (black), 30 (red), and 90 min (blue) sensitization times. 
This enabled the study of the injection behavior upon externally decreasing the quasi Fermi level of the electrodes. Here, Li+ concentrations in the electrolyte were gradually increased up to 4.0 M – vide supra. For reference measurements, DPV3 and DPV4 were also measured in devices featuring indium–zinc–oxide (IZO) electrodes, in which the indium doping internally decreases the quasi Fermi level, and, in turn, facilitates the charge injection.38 For all devices, current density–voltage (J–V), incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assays were performed. More details regarding the device configuration, fabrication, and characterization are provided in the Experimental section.
As representative examples, the figures-of-merit, such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η), of devices with DPV3 and DPV4 are discussed in the following (Fig. 6 and 7 as well as Table 1).

From the J–V analyses, we draw one major conclusion. Upon increasing the Li+ concentration from 0 to 1 M, a steady decrease of Voc points to the reduction of the photoanode’ quasi Fermi level, which is in sound agreement with the literature.35–37 Thus, interfacial Li+ doping facilitates the electron injection, as seen in an increase of Jsc from 0.5 to 2 mA cm−2 for devices with electrolytes featuring 0 and 0.5 M Li+, respectively. Beyond a Li+ concentration of 0.5 M, and up to 1 M, the Jsc decrease is quite likely related to insufficient dye regeneration. Thus, η follows the same trend as Jsc, owing to a reduction of the quasi Fermi level. From this point on, Li+ doping causes both a Jsc and η decline due to an effective trapping of injected electrons, which ultimately limits the electron diffusion length in the electrode network (vide infra).35–37
Above a Li+ concentration of 1.0 M, both Jsc and η steadily rise again until a plateau is reached at around 3.0 M Li+. Importantly, a continued decline is noted for Voc upon increasing the Li+ concentration, which attests that doping is still operative. It is striking that the Jsc behavior is identical for all DPVs (Fig. S3–S6†). Thus, we conclude that the changes in Jsc are an intrinsic feature of pentacene-based devices. It is noteworthy that the second increase in Jsc leads to an enhancement of the efficiency by a factor of 5 relative to a conventional electrolyte configuration, i.e. electrolytes without Li+ or with low Li+ concentrations.
At this point, two hypotheses are considered. On one hand, changes in the charge collection yield (ηcoll) of the electrodes due to extrinsic Li+ doping might be operative and, on the other hand, changes in the nature of the charge injection process might occur. Alternatively, a synergistic combination of these two processes might be possible, since enhanced electron injection rates often go hand-in-hand with an increase of ηcoll.
The Jsc dependence for all of the pentacene dyes is also reflected in the IPCE measurements and integrated Jsc values (Fig. S3, 7, and 9†). An increase in Li+ concentration is accompanied by a steadily increased IPCE across the entire spectrum. A notable exception is the 325 to 375 nm range, where, however, contributions from the electrolyte and the semiconductor hamper meaningful correlations. Overall, the loss in Voc upon increasing the Li+ concentration seems well compensated by the gain in Jsc. If anything, at a Li+ concentration of 1.0 M the effects are minimal, Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  (a) Absolute values of the integrated contribution of electron injection from the high energy band (380–420 nm) and low energy band (500–700 nm) to Jsc. (b) Trend of Jsc calculated from the IPCE integration upon increasing the amount of Li+ into the electrolyte. 
However, the stark increase in Jsc points to the facilitation of electron injection from the triplet excited state. To clarify this premise, we first confirmed that the changes in the electron injection are based on the external reduction of the quasi Fermi level of the electrode and not, for example, due to the interactions between Li+ and pentacene. Firstly, Li+ solutions in THF (4 M) were prepared, to which DPV1–4 were added stepwise to give solutions with pentacene concentrations of 5 × 10−7 to 2.0 × 10−6 M (Fig. 9). Secondly, 5 to 50 mg mL−1 of TiO2 nanoparticles (ca. 20 nm) were added to a 4 M Li+ solution in THF containing 5.0 × 10−6 M DPV1–4 (Fig. 9). In both assays, the lack of appreciable absorption changes of DPV1–4 helps to rule out the interactions between Li+ and the pentacenes.
 Fig. 9  (a) Absorption spectra taken upon stepwise addition of DPV3 into a Li+ solution in THF (4 M) – see the figure legend for details; (b) absorption spectra taken upon stepwise addition of TiO2 nanoparticles (18 to 20 nm) into a Li+ solution containing DPV3 – see the figure legend for details. 
Additional support for sizeable interactions between Li+ and pentacene came from electron injection processes in devices featuring IZO electrodes. In particular, indium doping of the electrode network enables control of the quasi Fermi level without affecting the charge recombination.38
Overall, indium doping evokes the same trends in terms of J–V and IPCE assays, as seen upon adding Li+ (Fig. S7†). In particular, a first maximum in η was noted at 15% indium followed by a decrease and a second increase in η with a maximum at 60% indium. The rise in η was solely due to an increase in Jsc, which was independently corroborated by the same IPCE behavior (Fig. S7 and S8†). All of the aforementioned observations are consistent with the conclusion that Li+/pentacene interactions are not responsible for enhanced device performance under operation. Changes either in the electron injection nature or in the recombination across the electrode/electrolyte interface, as well as the regeneration processes cannot be ruled out at this stage. To shed light on these aspects, the recombination behavior was studied by means of EIS, while the regeneration and injection processes were investigated by means of transient absorption spectroscopy.


2.3.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic assays. 
To investigate the recombination behavior upon increasing the concentration of the Li+ electrolyte, EIS assays were performed. Fig. S7† shows the Nyquist plots, which are best described as semicircles that correlate with the electron transfer processes across the electrode/dye/electrolyte interface as indicated by the maximum frequency of 20–500 Hz in the Bode Phase. The width of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot relates to a balance between the charge transport resistance (Rw) and resistance towards recombination (Rk), which are independently studied under illumination and dark conditions, respectively.46 Owing to the fact that only one semicircle is observed, a single semicircular fitting model was utilized (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  (a) Proposed equivalent circuit model for the EIS evaluation for sensitized solar cells with DPV3 as a function of Li+ concentration in the electrolyte redox couple under 1 sun AM 1.5 solar intensity and dark conditions; (b) resistance changes under light (Rw, black) and dark (Rk, blue) conditions; (c) capacitance (C, black) and lifetime (τ, blue) under 1 sun AM 1.5 solar intensity; (d) effective diffusion length (Leff, black) and lifetime (τ, blue) under 1 sun AM 1.5 solar intensity; (e) charge collection efficiency (ηcoll, black) and the density of states (DOS, blue) under 1 sun AM 1.5 solar intensity. 
A direct comparison of the EIS features as a function of Li+ concentration prompts to two major findings. On one hand, the semicircle is reduced and shifted to lower frequencies under illumination and using up to 0.5 M Li+ (Fig. S9–S13†), which is an indication of decreased Rw and increased capacitance (C) of the electrodes. From 0.5 to 1.5 M Li+, the semicircle starts to increase again, indicating an increase of Rw as Jsc is reduced (Fig. 7, 10, and S9–S13†). Beyond a Li+ concentration of 1.5 M, Rw enhancement is due to increased electron injection, as both the DOS profile and the reduction of the semicircle indicate. On the other hand, EIS studies under dark conditions and different Li+ concentrations have also been performed (Fig. 7, 10, and S9–13†). Here, the trend in Rk goes hand-in-hand with that noted for Rw, which, in addition, nicely correlates with the DOS calculated for the electrode upon increasing the Li+ concentration (Fig. 10 and S9–13†).
Observations related to C and the lifetime (τ ) offer further insight into the interactions between the electrode and Li+ (Fig. 10). For instance, τ increases from 1 × 10−3 s for devices without Li+ to 1.2 × 10−2 s for devices with 0.5 M Li+. Subsequently, a drop is observed at 1 M Li+ and a second rise until a maximum lifetime of 2.0 × 10−2 s is reached in devices with 3 M Li+. This is equivalent to an increase of 66% in τ between the first and second maxima. Notably, the same trend holds for C and DOS (Fig. 10).
All of the aforementioned trends are clearly summarized in ηcoll, which is shown in Fig. 10 and summarized in Table 2. ηcoll is based on the ratio of Rw and Rk (see eqn (3) in the Experimental section). Importantly, highly efficient DSSCs should feature high ηcoll through a wide range of bias voltages between short- and open-circuit conditions. As a matter of fact, ηcoll and η should be similar, and a clear relationship between both is noted in the present work upon increasing the Li+ concentration (Fig. 7, 10, and S9–13†). To this end, the increase of electron density likely stems from the enhancement of the electron injection rather than from a reduction of the electron recombination. Considering that the EIS experiments rule out an unexpected electron recombination upon increasing the Li+ concentration, it is not surprising that ηcoll tracks η.

2.3.3 Extrinsic change of the quasi Fermi-level of the semiconductor – transient absorption spectroscopy assays of full TiO2-based devices. 
To enhance the electron injection kinetics, high concentrations of Li+ were added as a means to down-shift the quasi Fermi level of the semiconductor. For these assays, devices featuring a 1 μm thick photoelectrode were employed in conjunction with platinum-based counter electrodes. The devices were then completed with a solvent-based electrolyte with stepwise increased Li+ content. Specifically, Li+ concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 M were added to the electrolyte mixture (vide supra). Regardless of the Li+ concentration, characteristics of the transient maxima and ground state bleaching are seen instantaneously (Table S1†). For DPV3@DSSC, kinetic analyses of the 510 nm maximum and the 595 nm ground state bleaching document that ISC is still discernable. The charge injection is on the order of 4.4–5.5 × 1010 s−1, mostly due to the extrinsic quasi Fermi level changes, (Table S1†). Charge recombination and recovery of the ground state take place on the nanosecond time scale. For DPV4@DSSC, a slightly faster injection rate is observed with 0.9–1.4 × 1011 s−1 followed by slower recombinations. These recombinations, as expected, are fast in the absence of Li+, but we observe changes that go in line with our collection efficiency and the generation of Jsc translating into a delay of hundreds of picoseconds in our spectroscopic analysis.

3. Conclusion
We report on the synthesis, the photophysics, and the electrochemistry of two new classes of pentacenes for n-type DSSCs. We believe that the most remarkable finding is the unique charge injection of pentacenes as the quasi Fermi levels are lowered via Li+ doping in TiO2 or InZnO. In particular, for bare/undoped TiO2/InZnO, charge injection originates from the triplet excited state following intersystem crossing. For doped TiO2, the very same triplet excited state dominates the charge injection, but as we lower the conduction band via doping a higher collection efficiency, as well as a direct change in the loss mechanisms of the device, is realized. As such, device efficiencies of up to 1.5% are realized. The latter features three times higher efficiencies than any previously reported pentacene-based DSSCs.29 Hence, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art efficiency of pentacene-based DSSCs is markedly enhanced by (i) molecular design and (ii) the optimization of the electrolyte composition. In the context of the design, the anchors are placed at the 6-position of the pentacene, which results in a better injection of charges, when compared to differently functionalized pentacenes. In the context of the electrolyte composition, high Li+ concentrations lead to an extrinsic lowering of the quasi Fermi level of the semiconductor. This approach also has some macroscopic effects, such as loss in efficiency to trap state formation as a function of concentration and an increase of the charge collection efficiency and density of states through triplet excited state injections.

Device fabrication and characterization
All chemicals were of the highest purity and are commercially available. Ethanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich), and valeronitrile (Alfa Aesar) were used without further purification. H2PtCl6 was used to prepare the counter-electrodes, as well as 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-tert-butylpyridine were used to prepare the electrolyte. FTO-glass slides (Pilkington, 3.2 mm, 8 Ω cm−2) were purchased from XOP glass. The titanium-dioxide paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) used was purchased from Solaronix. FTO substrates were cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonication bath for 15 min and then sonicated in a soap solution (deconex FPD 120, 1% vol. solution in 150 mL deionized water) for 15 min. Following these steps, the slides were sonicated for 15 min in pure deionized water. Finally, the substrates were dried under a nitrogen flow, sonicated in isopropanol for 15 min, and subsequently dried under a flow of nitrogen. To eliminate any organic residue from the electrode surface, the substrates were further treated for 18 min in a UV-ozone cleaner model 42-220 (Jelight Company). TiO2 films were prepared employing a commercially available Solaronix (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) paste. These pastes were doctor-bladed onto the aforementioned FTO slides using a circular scotch tape template with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of 50 μm. Subsequently, the first layer was dried at 80 °C, and a second layer was applied following the same procedure. Next, the slides were heated between room temperature and 500 °C with the following temperature ramps. Firstly, the slides were heated from room temperature to 150 °C with a ramp of 10 °C min−1 and were held at 150 °C for 10 min. Secondly, the temperature was increased from 150 up to 325 °C with a 15 °C min−1 ramp and held constant for 5 min. Thirdly, the temperature was further increased by 5 °C min−1 up to 375 °C and then held constant for 5 min. Fourthly, the temperature was additionally increased up to 450 °C at 7 °C min−1 and then held constant at 450 °C for 30 min. Fifthly, the final temperature of 500 °C was reached by an increase at 5 °C min−1, where the samples were kept for 15 min. The slides were then cooled to 80 °C before immersion for 2 h in a THF solution of the pentacene dyes (4 × 10−4 M) to fully cover the semiconducting surface. The measured film thicknesses were 9 μm for all the slides.
For the counter-electrode fabrication, FTO plates with two holes of 1 mm diameter at the edge of the active area were used. Prior to fabrication, the FTO slides were cleaned following the aforementioned procedure. A thin film of 26 μl H2PtCl6 (0.5 mmol in ethanol) was prepared from chloroplatinic acid hydrate ∼38 wt% Pt content and directly spread over the FTO plates and dried in air prior to baking at 400 °C for 20 min.
To finalize the device, both electrodes were sealed together with a transparent film of Surlyn (DuPont Ltd, UK) cut as a frame around the nanocrystalline film. A solution of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide 99%, 0.05 M iodine doubly sublimed, 0.1 M lithium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine 96% in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v) was employed as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was introduced through the aforementioned holes and the final cell was sealed immediately afterwards using another piece of Surlyn and a piece of a microscope slide.
Photocurrent measurements were carried out under AM 1.5 conditions using a custom-made solar simulator, including a 350–1000 Watt adjustable Xe lamp source (LOT) combined with an appropriate AM 1.5 filter. Current voltage measurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT30, Autolab) in the range from −0.8 to 0.2 V. All measurements were performed with a black mask after calibration of the aforementioned apparatus with a silicon solar cell reference SRC-1000-TC-K-KG5-N purchased from VLSI standards at room temperature. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Newport apparatus model 70104.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic assays (EIS) were carried out with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT30, Autolab) equipped with a frequency response analyzer module (FRA). Measurements were performed at the respective open-circuit voltage of the different devices in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5 filter, 100 W cm−2). The AC signal amplitude was set to 10 mV and modulated in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. The Nova 1.11 software was used to obtain the parameters from the equivalent circuit. With these data at hand, the charge collection efficiency yield (ηcoll), the electron lifetime (τ ), and the effective carrier diffusion length (Leff) were calculated by means of eqn (1)–(3), respectively.46 ηcoll = 1 − (Rw/Rk)(1) τ = 1/(2 × π × fmax)(2) Leff = (Deff × τ)1/2(3)where Rw, Rk, fmax, and Deff are the electron transport resistance, the charge-transfer resistance to recombination of electrons, the maximum frequency taken from the bode phase plot, and the effective diffusion coefficient, respectively.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
The measurements were carried out with a transient absorption pump/probe system (TAPPS) from Clark-MXR Inc. The excitation was performed with an amplified CPA-2101 Titanium:sapphire laser (1 kHz; 200 nJ laser energy) from Clark-MXR Inc. For detection, a HELIOS SYSTEM from Ultrafast Systems, working with a 1 kHz pump laser at 387 and 610 nm, was used. Due to photobleaching, we were unable to obtain reproducible data for DPV1 and DPV2 using either Al2O3 or TiO2 or in a full device. The low photostability of DPV1 and DPV2 in comparison with DPV3 and DPV4 is currently under investigation.
Spectroelectrochemistry
The measurements were carried out with a VARIAN Cary 6000 with in a homemade three neck cell equipped with a Pt-mesh as the transparent working electrode, a Ag-wire as the pseudo reference electrode, and a Pt plate as the counter electrode. As the electrolyte, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dichloromethane was used. A PGStat 101 from Methrom was used as a potentiostat, controlled by the NOVA 1.10© software provided by Methrom.
