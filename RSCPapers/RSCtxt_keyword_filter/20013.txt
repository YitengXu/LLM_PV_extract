    , Accepted 12th October 2015First published on 12th October 2015AbstractWe demonstrate for the first time an asymmetric squaraine-based low band-gap hole transporting material, which acted as both light harvesting and hole transporting layers in methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite solar cells. Opto-electrochemical characterization revealed extremely high molar extinction coefficients of the absorption bands in the low energy region and prominent space charge delocalization due to its electronically asymmetric nature. A suitable band alignment of the squaraine HOMO level with the valence band edge of the perovskite, and the conduction band of the TiO2 with LUMO of the perovskite allowed a cascade of hole extraction and electron injection, respectively. Red-shifted absorption was observed for both HTMs in thin films coated on the perovskite, and the optimized devices exhibited an impressive PCE of 14.7% under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5 G). The efficiency value is comparable to that of the devices using a state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer under similar conditions. Ambient stability after 300 h revealed that 88% of the initial efficiency remained for JK-216D, and almost no change for JK-217D, indicating that the devices had good long-term stability thus suggesting that the asymmetric squaraines have great potential as a dual-functional HTM for high performance perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
As a new class of solution-processable light absorbing materials, methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite has attracted prevailing attention from the material and photovoltaic communities.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been quickly increased from 3.9 to 20.1% as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)3 due to their intrinsic advantages like broad absorption in the visible regions,4 high absorption coefficient,5 high charge carrier mobility6 and long diffusion length.7 Since n-i-p PCSs inherited the configuration of solid state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSC), p-type semiconductors as hole transporting materials (HTMs) is one of the most critical components in the PCSs.8 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is by far the most studied and used molecular p-type HTM with a recently reported PCE of 19.7%.9 Similar to spiro-OMeTAD, a large series of triphenylamine (TPA)-based small molecules and polymers have been reported as alternative HTMs in PSCs.10–14 In most of these devices, these HTMs were wide bandgap semiconductors similar to spiro-OMeTAD, with absorption in the UV, and almost no absorption in the visible and near-IR regions of the solar spectrum as the neutral form. In this case the perovskite layer functions as the light absorber and the HTM layer is only responsible for hole transportation. Until recently, only a limited number of low band gap organic semiconductors have been used as HTMs in CH3NH3PbX3-based PSCs, including donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers,15–17 (A–)D–A-type oligomers18–20 and substituted phthalocyanines.21 Although there has been no report on the light absorption contribution from these low bandgap polymers, our group has found that with some visible to near-infrared light absorbing molecular HTMs, significant improvement of the photocurrent in the blue or red regions was observed respectively, which is in agreement with absorption of the corresponding HTM films.18,22 This indicates a synergistic and effective participation of these HTMs as light absorbers together with perovskites over the solar spectrum.
Squaraines are a promising class of pigments with a zwitterionic resonance structure and have found applications in areas such as imaging, nonlinear optics, photovoltaics, photodynamic therapy, and ion sensing,23 due to their extremely high molar extinction coefficients (ε > 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 650 nm) and intense absorption in the near infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum.24,25 It has been reported that upon modification, a squaraine can be used as a complementary absorber in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)26,27 due to its ability to efficiently convert the low-energy (∼1.4 eV) photons into electricity.28 At the same time, squaraines have been reported to have p-type semiconductive properties and exhibit field-effect hole mobilities of ∼10−5 to 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1,25,29 which indicates that squaraine pigments could carry out dual functions of light harvesting and hole transporting layers.
In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of two D–A–D–A-type low bandgap molecular semiconductors JK-216D and JK-217D based on an asymmetric squaraine chromophore and for the first time their use as HTMs in perovskite solar cells with mesoporous TiO2 as electron selective contact. The devices having the structure of FTO/compact layer TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au are fabricated. The optimized devices based on these new HTMs showed similar PCEs of up to 14.7%, which is slightly lower compared to the value of 15.3% from spiro-OMeTAD. As a result of strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, we observed again the contribution from the HTM layer to the photocurrent generated from the perovskite solar cells. These squaraine based HTMs showed excellent stability with 12% loss in the PCE with JK-216D and almost no change with JK-217D over 300 hours.
Experimental
Preparation of the squaraine based HTM molecules
The synthetic route to an unsymmetrical squaraine HTM by stepwise condensation reaction of different heterocyclic moieties with central squaric acid is shown in Scheme S1.† Half squaraines 1 and 2 were prepared by using the reported literature method.30 Then they were condensed with 3 to yield 4 and 5 and induce a panchromatic absorption. Suzuki coupling of 4 and 5 with 5-formyl thiophene-2-boronic acid in THF/H2O produced aldehydes 6 and 7. These precursors were further condensed with hexyl 2-cyanoacetate to afford the final compounds JK-216D and JK-217D (Fig. 1). The chemical structures of the synthesized products were verified by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Additional details are given in the ESI.†

Characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Erba Instruments CHNS-O EA 1108 analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMS-SX102A instrument. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively.
Fabrication of solar cells
FTO glass plates (Pilkington, TEC-8) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and rinsed with water and ethanol. The compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the etched F-doped tin oxide substrate by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C, using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution. The FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films were deposited by spin coating of a diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T, 1:3.5 w/w diluted with ethanol) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The films were sintered at 500 °C. PbI2 was purchased from Aldrich and CH3NH3I was prepared similarly to a previously published method.31 PbI2 and CH3NH3I were added to a 250 mL flame-dried 2-neck round-bottom flask with γ-butyrolactone (GBL). The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. Then, the solvent was removed and the product was washed with hexane to obtain CH3NH3PbI3. The CH3NH3PbI3 was stirred in a mixture of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h.32 The CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin-cast on top of the TiO2/FTO substrate at 3000 rpm. For deposition of HTM layers, JK-216D/chlorobenzene (20 mM), JK-217D/chlorobenzene (20 mM) and spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (60 mM) solutions were prepared with two additives. 3.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (520 mg/1 mL) and 8.0 μL (4-tert-butylpyridine) (TBP) were added to the HTM/chlorobenzene solutions as additives. The HTMs were spin-cast on top of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate at 3000 rpm. Finally, a ∼60 nm thick Ag electrode was deposited on top of the film under reduced pressure (lower than 10−6 Torr).
Results and discussion
Based on the squaraine unit, strong electron donating and accepting groups were introduced to push the electronic absorption further to the NIR region.33 The UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of JK-216D and JK-217D in chlorobenzene (CB) are shown in Fig. 2a. JK-216D and JK-217D exhibit almost identical absorption spectra with sharp absorption bands in the longer wavelength region 600–800 nm inside which high molar absorption coefficients of 119000 M−1 cm−1 and 147600 M−1 cm−1 were observed at 720 nm and 723 nm respectively. The spectrum of JK-217D red shifted slightly as compared to JK-216D due to increased electron donating ability after the substitution of hexyloxy groups. The optical band gap (Eg) of JK-217D and JK-216D is calculated (1.66 and 1.65 eV) from the absorption onset wavelength of the corresponding absorption spectrum respectively, which is to our knowledge one of the lowest bandgap HTMs ever used in perovskite solar cells20 (Table 1). It is expected that the strong absorption in the NIR region can harvest the complementarily unabsorbed light passing through the perovskite layer. The fluorescence spectra show maximum emission at 772 nm and 770 nm for JK-216D and JK-217D, with Stokes shifts of 52 nm and 47 nm respectively.

In Fig. 2b, UV-Vis absorption spectra of both HTM coated CH3NH3PbI3 films are shown. The contribution of light absorption from HTM layers coated on the perovskite can be demonstrated from the fact that the absorption band of neat perovskite films is strongly enhanced, especially in the wavelength above 550 nm.18 The enhancement in the absorption of these sandwich films by the HTM layers resemble each other in the low energy region, the onset of which is extended up to 825 nm. This behaviour resembles the case when organic dyes are absorbed on the TiO2 surface and is attributed to the formation of J-aggregation as envisaged in the literature.34
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of JK-216D and JK-217D are shown in Fig. S1† and the parameters are summarized in Table 1. The two HTMs JK-216D and JK-217D exhibited reversible oxidation processes with JK-217D having a lower oxidation potential due to the extra hexyloxy substituents. The HOMO energy levels are calculated from the CV data with the assumption that the energy level of ferrocene is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. No reduction potential was observed in the CV measurement. The HOMO levels of JK-216D and JK-217D calculated from the onset oxidation potential are −5.09 eV and −5.08 eV respectively. As the HOMO energy level of CH3NH3PbI3 is −5.43 eV,35 the two new HTMs are energetically favorable for hole transfer. These trends are reflected in the energy level diagram and compared with the energy level of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (Fig. 3). The LUMO energy level was estimated, based on ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0, to be −3.436 eV and −3.421 respectively, which will allow sufficient offset to the conduction band of the perovskite to not only block the electrons from the perovskite but also ensure a cascade of electron transfer at the interface when the HTMs are excited.

Calculations using time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to investigate the electronic properties of the squaraine-based HTMs. As shown in Fig. 3, the orbital density of the HOMO of representative JK-216D locates on the bis-DMFA-thiophene-pyrrole core owing to its greater electron-donating strength, whereas the orbital density of LUMO was predominantly located between the squaraine and cyanoacrylate unit. The efficient intramolecular charge transfer leads to a partial wave function overlap between LUMO and HOMO. A strong Coulomb interaction is induced, which will favor the formation of neutral excitons and hole transport.36
To evaluate the dual function of a low band gap HTM on the performance of perovskite solar cells, various HTM materials including JK-216D, JK-217D and spiro-OMeTAD were used for comparison. The cross-section SEM picture shown in Fig. 4 illustrates a typical perovskite solar cell in which the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on mesoporous-TiO2 (m-TiO2) by a one-step deposition method as described in the Experimental section. The perovskite penetrates into the m-TiO2 and forms a capping-layer on top at the same time. The HTMs form a thin capping layer on the top of the smooth perovskite layer. The current–density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized performance of three types of devices are shown in Fig. 5(a). The device performance data are summarized in Table 2.

As can be seen in the J–V curves, the reference cell with spiro-OMeTAD displayed a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.105 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1002 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.48%, resulting in a PCE of 15.33%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD devices prepared under similar perovskite composition and device architecture.37,38 Using JK-216D and JK-217D as HTMs, slightly increased JSC values of 21.754 and 21.226 mA cm−2 were observed respectively under standard global AM 1.5 illumination. However due to the relatively higher HOMO levels of JK-216D and JK-217D, their VOC values decreased compared to that of spiro-OMeTAD. The fill factor of the device based on JK-217D is higher (71.94%) compared to the device based on JK-216D (69.92%), which could be ascribed to the better ordering of JK-217D in the solid state in the presence of two hexyloxy chains. Therefore, the overall parameters contributed to the best PCE values of JK-216D and JK-217D as 14.74% and 14.73%, respectively. The statistical data of the perovskite solar cells containing the two new HTMs based on 85 identical devices are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) giving the average PCE values of 12.12% and 11.18%, respectively.

Fig. 5b shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the devices using the JK-216D and JK-217D HTMs. The perovskite solar cells using JK-216D show an excellent photocurrent response from 300 to 800 nm, with the IPCE reaching a maximum of 82% at 490 nm, while spiro-OMeTAD and JK-217D based devices showed a maximum IPCE of 84% at 490 nm and 80% at 480 nm, respectively. Although the photoresponse of the device using the spiro-OMeTAD is slightly better than the squaraine-based HTMs below 600 nm, it is noticeable to see an improvement of the photocurrent between 680 and 800 nm due to the contribution of the low bandgap squaraine. A shoulder at 740 nm with IPCE values of 65% correlated well with the absorption maximum in thin films (Fig. 2b). This result proved the dual function of squaraine pigments as light harvesting and hole transporting layers inside the perovskite solar cells. A mismatch between the IPCE spectra and absorption spectra is observed and is ascribed to the electron transfer from the excited aggregates to the perovskite as well as from the monomers which have different quantum yields.39,40
Finally, the operational stability of the squaraine-based perovskite solar cell was tested under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and the data are shown in Fig. 6. The unsealed cells showed little change in JSC and VOC over time but the FF decreases more prominently. After 300 h in the ambient environment, the PCE of the device with JK-216D as the HTM retains 88% of its initial value, however the JK-217D exhibited almost no change, indicating a superior long-term stability of the JK-217D.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported for the first time an asymmetric squaraine-based low band-gap hole transporting material, which acted as both light harvesting and hole transporting layers in perovskite solar cells. Optoelectrochemical characterization revealed extremely high molar extinction absorption bands in the low energy region and prominent space charge delocalization due to its electronically asymmetric nature. Suitable band alignments of the squaraine molecules with the perovskite and photoanode allowed a cascade of electron injection and effective hole extraction in perovskite solar cells. Red-shifted absorption was observed for both HTMs in thin films coated on the perovskite. The optimized devices exhibited an impressive PCE of 14.7% under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5 G), which is comparable to that of the devices using a state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer under similar conditions. Ambient stability after 300 h revealed that 88% of the energy conversion efficiency was retained for JK-216D and almost no change for JK-217D, indicating that the devices had good long-term stability thus suggesting that the asymmetric squaraine shows a great potential as a dual-functional HTM for high performance in perovskite solar cells.
