    , Accepted 1st March 2022First published on 1st March 2022AbstractWe herein report a triple helicene based molecular semiconductor (TBPC-611), characteristic of a fully fused conjugated backbone containing multiple pyrrole rings. TBPC-611 can be solution-processed with nonvolatile 4-tert-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide into a morphologically heat-resistant composite thin film which also possesses high electrical conductivity and high hole mobility. These combined quality factors allow for its use as the protective hole-transport layer of PSCs with 22.1%-efficiency which are remarkably stable at 85 °C for 2000 h. Joint experimental and theoretical investigations have uncovered the crucial correlation of the permeation of internal and external gaseous molecules with the thermal decomposition of perovskites, shedding light on durable perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
Under the stress of heat, light, bias potential, and moisture, the organic hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells needs to be able to resist the chemical and mechanical damage from diffusive species, protect the photoactive layer, and maintain a stable morphology, which ensures that the extraction and transport of holes do not degenerate. Therefore, it is pertinent to develop organic semiconductors with combined quality factors including the energy level, conductivity, glass transition temperature, and permeation coefficients. Due to the extremely low intrinsic carrier density of organic semiconductors, we stress that a sufficiently high carrier density by intentional or accidental doping is indispensable for a hole transport layer in efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%.1,2 The most efficient n–i–p typed PSCs have been so far manufactured by sequential solution-deposition of a photoactive perovskite layer and a hole transport layer (HTL) on a SnO2 or TiO2 based electron transport layer.3–6 For this type of device, the photovoltage is generated at the heterojunction between the perovskite and HTL. Therefore, the PCE is also profoundly dependent on the quality factors of a HTL.7,8 In the past decade intense investigation on HTLs including inorganic semiconductors,9–12 molecular semiconductors,7,8,13–21 and polymeric semiconductors22–27 has been witnessed; however only a few HTLs have been reported for the fabrication of over 20%-efficiency PSCs with excellent stability at 85 °C.10,20,28–31 For molecular semiconductors, one of the grand challenges consists of the trade-off between high glass transition temperature (Tg) for thermostable morphology and sufficient solubility for solution processability. In this regard, the delicate intermolecular noncovalent interactions need to be well addressed.

ortho-Fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, helicenes, are intrinsically chiral in spite of the lack of any stereogenic center.32 Due to the curved or twisted π-surfaces, only partial intermolecular π⋯π stacking exists.33 However, the extra molecular edges for solvation and the attenuated π⋯π interaction together always confer improved solubility on a helicene, in comparison with its planar analogue.32 In the recent years, multipolar helicenes which consist of two or more helical subunits fused together have been actively explored owing to their unique properties different from those of the single helicenes.34,35 To be specific, the three-dimensional configuration of multipolar helicenes endows organic thin films with the property of charge transport in multiple dimensions.36 In this work, we design and synthesize a triple aza[5]helicene based molecular semiconductor characteristic of a fully fused conjugated backbone (TBPC-611, Fig. 1a). With respect to the state-of-the-art molecular semiconductor spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 1b) for PSCs, the theoretical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of TBPC-611 is slightly higher on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) prediction. More critically, the combined structural features of he rigid backbone and helical shapes endow TBPC-611 with ample solubility, high Tg, and good hole mobility (μh), allowing for the fabrication of PSCs with over 22% PCE that are stable at 85 °C.

Results and discussion
Scheme S1 of the ESI† outlines the synthetic route to TBPC-611. In brief, three-fold Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (1) with 1-chloronaphthalen-2-amine afforded N1,N3,N5-tris(1-chloronaphthalen-2-yl)benzene-1,3,5-triamine (2), which was followed by direct arylation–cyclisation, alkylation, and bromination in sequence to produce 2,9,16-tribromo-7,14,21-trihexyl-14,21-dihydro-7H-benzo[g]benzo[4,5]indolo[3,2-a]benzo[4,5]indolo[3,2-c]carbazole (5). Next, 5 underwent three-fold Buchwald–Hartwig amination with 2-chloro-4-methoxyaniline, which was followed by direct arylation–cyclisation and alkylation to afford TBPC-611. The total synthesis of TBPC-611 was accomplished in 7 steps with an overall yield of 51%. For the details of synthesis, see the ESI.† The chemical structures of all new compounds were confirmed by their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, high-resolution mass spectra, and infrared spectra (see Appendix section of the ESI†). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the THF solution of TBPC-611 presents characteristic peaks at 322, 356, 397, and 414 nm.
X-Ray crystallographic analysis was further carried out to confirm the helical structure of TBPC-611 (Fig. 1c). The key single-crystal parameters are collected in Table S1 (ESI†). The molecules of TBPC-611 crystallize into the triclinic P space groups, with two racemic molecules in a primitive unit cell, which can be distinguished by the directions of three helical arms (Fig. 1a). The interplanar angles between the central and three terminal benzene rings are 18.33°, 23.25°, and 31.69°, respectively. Along the crystallographic b-axis (Fig. 1d), two molecules of different chiralities are alternately stacked to produce a racemic molecular string. In the bc plane (Fig. 1e), the molecular string can be translated to form a 3D molecular arrangement.
To evaluate the time constant (τh) and yield (ϕh) of hole extraction, we measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) trace (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the CsMAFA-based perovskite film deposited on the mesoporous alumina substrate, which was further capped with poly(N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK), TBPC-611, or spiro-OMeTAD. For details, see the Experimental section of ESI.† As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the amplitude-averaged photoluminescence (PL) lifetime () is 1258 ns with PVK. However, the presence of a HTL exerts a ca. two orders of magnitude shortened  value on CsMAFA, which is 12 ns with TBPC-611 and 20 ns with spiro-OMeTAD. The faster extraction of holes by TBPC-611 can be ascribed to the larger driving force. The values of ϕh are further calculated as 99.0% with TBPC-611 and 98.4% with spiro-OMeTAD.
The direct-current electrical conductivity (σ) of the neat TBPC-611 thin film deposited on the interdigitated gold electrodes37 was measured as 9.4 × 10−1 μS cm−1, over one order of magnitude larger than 8.5 × 10−2 μS cm−1 of its spiro-OMeTAD counterpart (Fig. 2a). From the impedance measurement of the metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) device (Fig. S3, ESI†),37 the hole density (p) of the neat TBPC-611 thin film (Fig. 2b) was derived as 4.0 × 1017 cm−3, 1.4 times higher than 2.9 × 1017 cm−3 of the spiro-OMeTAD one (Fig. 2c). Note that the intrinsic density of holes formed by disproportionation is less than 103 cm−3 for a single component organic material with >2 eV energy gap.38 We thereby remark that the natural doping of either the TBPC-611 or the spiro-OMeTAD thin film has actually occurred in dry air. The relative magnitude of measured p can be further understood in terms of the driving force for atmospheric oxidation. Using the equation μh = σ/qp where q is the elementary charge, the hole mobility (μh) can be further reckoned, to be 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the neat TBPC-611 film and 1.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the spiro-OMeTAD one. Moreover, the μh values of the neat organic films in the hole-only devices were also measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4, ESI†),39 to be 7.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TBPC-611 and 6.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD. In general, the relative trends of μh measured by these two methods are basically consistent.

The electrical conductivity (σ) is calculated with the equation , where n is the number of channels in the interdigitated electrodes, L is the channel length, W is the channel width, t is the channel thickness, and s is the slope derived from the linear fitting of the I–V plot. (b and c) The Mott–Schottky plot of (A/C)2 as a function of the voltage, where A is the device active area and C is the corrected capacitance. The green linear fitting is used to determine the hole density (p). (d) The typical I–V curve of the 15 wt% BPTFSI-containing the composite film of TBPC-611 or spiro-OMeTAD. (e and f) The ESR spectrum of the neat or composite film of TBPC-611 or spiro-OMeTAD. 
Our preliminary device simulation (Fig. S5, ESI†) has suggested that such low conductivity of the neat TBPC-611 film is not qualified for high-efficiency PSCs at all. Thus we blended TBPC-611 with a nonvolatile organic salt 4-(tert-butyl)pyridinium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (BPTFSI) to promote the air-doping level.40 Similar to spiro-OMeTAD, when BPTFSI is present, more TBPC-611 will be oxidized to its radical cations by oxygen in the air, according to the following equation:O2 + 4HTM + 4BPTFSI → 4HTM+TFSI− + 4TBP + 2H2OThe σ value of the spin-cast TBPC-611 composite film with 15% BPTFSI (mass content) increases along with storage time, reaching a constant value of 304 μS cm−1 after ca. 150 h (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is over one order of magnitude larger than 25 μS cm−1 of the spiro-OMeTAD congener (Fig. 2d). On the basis of the increments of electron spin resonance (ESR) signal in Fig. 2e and f, we then extrapolated the p values of the BPTFSI composite thin films, to be 2.4 × 1018 cm−3 for TBPC-611 and 8.7 × 1017 cm−3 for spiro-OMeTAD. The μh values of the composite films were calculated as 7.9 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for TBPC-611 and 1.7 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD. The SCLC based μh values of the BPTFSI composite films were measured as 8.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TBPC-611 and 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD (Table S3, ESI†). Encouragingly, TBPC-611 either in the neat or composite film exhibits a higher μh than spiro-OMeTAD. The σ and μh of the neat or composite TBPC-611 film are also compared with literature data (Fig. S7, ESI†).41–50 We remark that this comparison could be of better physical meaning, if the data on hole density have been reported in these literature studies. Upon introducing the air-doping promoter (BPTFSI), not only p but also μh has been considerably boosted. This scenario can be understood in terms of the analytic model on the charge transport of doped organic semiconductors, which states that at the high doping level, the overlapping of Coulomb potential wells can lower the activation energies of Coulomb traps, resulting in the increase of carrier mobility.51
Moreover, the Tg of an organic semiconducting film for durable PSCs should be sufficiently high to ensure the persistent atomic-scale amorphous structure under the 85 °C thermal stress.52,53 The Tg value of the neat TBPC-611 measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), TDSCg, is 192 °C, much higher than 121 °C of spiro-OMeTAD. Compared with the neat materials, the TDSCg values of the BPTFSI composites are reduced by ∼50 °C, being 75 °C for spiro-OMeTAD and 141 °C for TBPC-611. This implies that a good potential of TBPC-611 as the HTL for PSCs operated at 55 °C or stored at 85 °C. As noted from Fig. S8 (ESI†), there is an almost linear relationship between the molecular dynamics (MD) predicted values and the experimentally measured ones.
Subsequently, we used the neat film of TBPC-611 or spiro-OMeTAD as HTL to fabricate PSCs. We recorded the current–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. S9, ESI†) of the sealed PSCs under the 100 mW cm−2, air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) sunlight and listed the photovoltaic parameters in Table 1. The typical cell with TBPC-611 exhibits a JSC of 24.3 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.110 V, and a FF of 0.746, and a PCE of 20.1%, while the control cell with spiro-OMeTAD shows a JSC of 24.1 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.060 V, a FF of 0.630, and a PCE of 16.1%. The higher PCE with pristine TBPC-611 relative to spiro-OMeTAD is mainly due to the improvement of the FF, which is closely associated with the enhanced σ. In addition, the increased VOC with TBPC-611 can be attributed to its higher μh, which reduces the density of holes at the PVSK/HTL interface and thus the interface charge recombination. It seems that the better hole transport is also favorable for hole collection, generating a small increase in JSC.

Next, we employed the BPTFSI-containing composite of TBPC-611 or spiro-OMeTAD as HTL to fabricate PSCs. We recorded the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 3a and b) of the sealed PSCs under the 100 mW cm−2, air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) sunlight and compiled the photovoltaic parameters in Table 1. The exemplary cell with TBPC-611 exhibits a JSC of 24.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.140 V, and a FF of 0.791, and a PCE of 22.1%, while the control cell with spiro-OMeTAD shows a JSC of 24.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.140 V, a FF of 0.772, and a PCE of 21.6%. It can be noticed from the J–V curves at the forward and reverse scan directions (Fig. S10, ESI†) that our cells have very small electrical hysteresis. The maximum power point tracking (Fig. S11, ESI†) affords stabilized PCEs of 22.0% for the TBPC-611 cell and 21.4% for the spiro-OMeTAD one. In addition, device fabrication has good reproducibility, as shown by the narrow distribution of photovoltaic parameters in Fig. S12 (ESI†).

(d and e) The TRPL decay traces. Note that the sealing materials and gold electrodes were removed before absorption measurement. (f) The electronic absorption spectra. Aging was performed at 85 °C for 2000 h. 
From the further numerical analysis (Fig. S13 and Table S4, ESI†), it is found that the alteration of spiro-OMeTAD with TBPC-611 brings forth not only a reduced reverse saturation current (Is) but also an increased shunt resistance (Rsh). The favorable variation of these two parameters should lead to an improved VOC for the TBPC-611 cell, which is however fully counteracted by a smaller ideality (n), leading to an unaltered VOC in J–V measurements. The plots of light intensity dependency VOC are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), affording n values54 similar to those acquired by numerical analysis. It can also be perceived from Fig. S15 (ESI†) that the effects of these parameters are arranged in the order of n > Is > Rsh. At a given forward bias potential (V), the recombination resistances (Rre) derived from impedance spectra (IS) are comparable for PSCs with TBPC-611 and spiro-OMeTAD, accounting for the same VOC (Fig. S16, ESI†).55 On the other hand, a larger Rsh, a smaller Is, and a smaller series resistance (Rs) together confer a higher FF on the TBPC-611 cell, although a smaller n has an adverse effect. The order of action of these parameters on FF is Rs > Rsh > Is > n. Compared with the spiro-OMeTAD control cell, the smaller Rs of the TBPC-611 cell is essentially stemmed from the higher σ (Fig. 2d) of the BPTFSI-containing composite of TBPC-611.
Subsequently, we tested the thermal stability of PSCs at 85 °C for 2000 h, with 45–90% environmental relative humidity. As shown in Fig. 3a, b and Table 1, the TBPC-611 cell has a good PCE retention ratio of 83% after aging, which is significantly higher than 63% of the spiro-OMeTAD control (Fig. S17, ESI†). Note from Fig. S11 (ESI†) that the maximum power point tracking of aged cells yields comparable PCEs to J–V measurements. In our comparative experiments, we did not observe a positive influence of encapsulation on the 85 °C thermal stability of PSCs for 7 days. The substantial reduction in PCE for the spiro-OMeTAD cell can be further decomposed into the 21% decrease in FF, 16% in JSC, and 7% in VOC. Numerical simulation of the J–V data of the fresh and aged cells (Fig. S18, ESI†) turns out that after aging, the negative effects of the increase in Is and the decrease in Rsh overwhelm the beneficial effect of the increase in n, resulting in a decrease in VOC for the spiro-OMeTAD cell. The order of influence on VOC is Is > n > Rsh. IS measurements (Fig. S16, ESI†) suggest that with respect to the aged TBPC-611 cell, the spiro-OMeTAD counterpart shows a greater reduction in Rre, which is consistent with its larger VOC attenuation. In addition, the small favorable contribution of the increase in n to FF is obviously unable to counter the huge adverse effects of both the increase in Rs and Is and the decrease in Rsh. The order of influence on the FF is Rs > Rsh > Is > n. In general, these two rules also apply to the aged TBPC-611 cell (Fig. S19, ESI†) which retains better VOC and FF, but the order of Rsh > Is has changed for the FF.
As presented in Fig. S20 (ESI†), there is an almost linear relationship between the photocurrent densities (JEQESC) predicted from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve and JSC from the J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 3c, a perceivable imparity of EQE maximum is noticed for the aged cells with spiro-OMeTAD and TBPC-611, while the EQE spectra for the fresh ones are indeed very similar. After aging the EQE maximum of the spiro-OMeTAD cell drops from 93% to 78%. Nevertheless, the degree of decrease in the EQE maximum is profitably damped for the TBPC-611 analogue, i.e. from 93% to 90%.
TRPL measurements on the sealed dummy cell of Al2O3/PVSK/PVK (Fig. S21, ESI†) reveal a shortened  from 1258 to 879 ns upon aging at 85 °C for 2000 h, which can be explained in terms of the accelerated non-radiative recombination, owing to the gradual augmentation of perovskite defects.56–58 However, the  values of the aged PSCs are prolonged from 12 to 15 ns for the TBPC-611 cell and from 20 to 36 ns for the spiro-OMeTAD one (Fig. 3d and e). This scenario suggests that a barrier layer between the CsMAFA-based perovskite and HTL could appear, weakening the electronic coupling of hole extraction. Recall that an organic coating with a higher Tg can better control the  attenuation of CsMAFA at 85 °C.40 Also, the Tg of the BPTFSI-containing composite of either spiro-OMeTAD (121 °C) or TBPC-611 (192 °C) is much lower than 208 °C of PVK. Thus, we deduce that if charge extraction does not occur, the  of the herein discussed PSCs should be shorter than 840 ns. It can be further inferred that after aging the charge separation yields (ϕcs) values could be much lower than 95.9% for the spiro-OMeTAD cell, and slightly lower than 98.3% for the TBPC-611 one (Table S5, ESI†). It is very likely that the decrease of ϕcs is relevant to the reduction of EQE, mainly due to the degradation of the perovskite.
Furthermore, we removed the gold electrode and sealing materials of PSCs for further characterization studies. Indeed, there is no difference in the optical density at each wavelength for the two fresh PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD and TBPC-611. After aging, the optical densities of both devices decrease to some extent. The TBPC-611 cell has a smaller drop of optical density than the spiro-OMeTAD one (Fig. 3f). By taking a close look at the light harvesting yield (Fig. S22, ESI†) and the normalized EQE (Fig. S23, ESI†), we can only ascribe the EQE degradation in the infrared region partially to the decrease of light absorption. We deduce that the larger degree of EQE reduction in the infrared region could be also related to the reduced collection yield of electrons. Moreover, the EQE drop in the region of blue-green light is not affected by the variation of light absorption.
In fact, there is no significant difference between the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of HTL-covered perovskite films in the fresh PSCs (Fig. 4a and b). However, after aging, some sub-micron pinholes or craters appear for the spiro-OMeTAD cell (Fig. 4d). The cracked HTL can cause some local contacts between the gold electrode and the perovskite layer, producing some new charge recombination interfaces as suggested by the increased Is and decreased Rsh, which are directly linked to the large reductions in both VOC and FF. Meanwhile, the TBPC-611 one basically maintains its original appearance (Fig. 4c). The improved morphological stability of the TBPC-611 based HTL under thermal stress can be preliminarily ascribed to its higher glass transition temperature. We note that after 85 °C aging for 3 days, the conductivity measured by interdigital electrodes and the hole mobility by SCLC devices did not decrease for the BPTFSI-containing composite films of either TBPC-611 or spiro-OMeTAD; however at least 8% degradation in PCE occurred in PSCs, mainly due to the increase of Rs and thereby the drop of FF. This could be caused by the increase of interface resistance after initial thermal aging.

(e and f) The XRD patterns of fresh and aged PSCs. Diffraction intensities are normalized with respect to the (110) plane of CsMAFA. (g–j) The fluorescence optical microscopy images. The sealing materials and gold electrodes were removed before XRD and fluorescence optical microscopy measurements. For fluorescence optical microscopy, HTLs are also washed away with chlorobenzene. 
As presented in Fig. 4e and f, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaked at 2θ = 14.0° corresponds to the (110) plane of the α-phase perovskite. The appearance of PbI2 (001) diffraction centered at 2θ = 12.7° for the fresh samples can be ascribed to the small quantity of excess PbI2 added during the deposition of the CsMAFA-based perovskite layer. After aging, the intensity of PbI2 diffraction of the spiro-OMeTAD cell (Fig. 4f) is remarkably increased by ca. 6.9 times, which is in stark contrast to only ca. 1.7 times for the TBPC-611 one (Fig. 4e). Obviously, TBPC-611 restrains the 85 °C decomposition of the CsMAFA-based perovskite to a much larger extent than spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, we used chlorobenzene to wash away HTLs by spin-coating for fluorescence optical microscopy measurements. As shown in Fig. 4g and h, dark images without distinguishable features are recorded for the fresh samples. However, a large number of a few microns long, needle-like PbI2 can be clearly visualized for the aged spiro-OMeTAD sample (Fig. 4j), in sharp contrast to the TBPC-611 one (Fig. 4i). Clearly, electronic absorption, XRD, and fluorescence optical microscopy measurements have jointly unraveled that under the 85 °C thermal stress the gradual decomposition of the CsMAFA-based perovskite into PbI2 can be remarkably influenced by the choice of HTL.
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the thermal decomposition of perovskites, we further performed MD simulations on the permeation of gaseous molecules in the HTL.59–61 The boxes in Fig. 5a and b are built with 400 hole-transporting molecules with 200 extra BPTFSI molecules. To acquire reasonable microstructures at 85 °C, multiple heating–cooling cycles and multiple compression–decompression processes were carried out during MD simulations. The theoretical permeability coefficient (P) of H2O (Fig. S24a, ESI†) in the BPTFSI-containing composite of TBPC-611 at 85 °C is 2.6 × 10−2 barrer (1 barrer = 10−10 cmHg−1 cm2 s−1), which is nearly one order of magnitude smaller than 2.5 × 10−1 barrer in the spiro-OMeTAD counterpart. Meanwhile, the simulated P value of CH3I (Fig. S24b, ESI†) is 3.1 × 10−3 barrer for the TBPC-611 composite, which is ca. 40 times lower than 1.2 × 10−1 barrer for the spiro-OMeTAD one. Obviously, there is a good correlation between the degradation of perovskite and the gas permeability of both H2O and CH3I through HTL. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, the TBPC based HTL with a thermostable morphology functions as a robust barrier for the permeation of gaseous species, greatly restraining the decomposition of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite.57,62–64 In addition, the BPTFSI containing composite film of TBPC-611 displays a higher water contact angle than its spiro-OMeTAD counterpart (Fig. S25, ESI†), which could also contribute to the better device stability.

(c) Schematics of inhibiting the permeation of H2O and CH3I by a robust TBPC-611 based HTL, restraining the thermal decomposition of the hybrid perovskite. 
Moreover, after 2000 h aging at 85 °C, the PCE of PSCs with neat TBPC-611 drops to 15.3%, which is still higher than 11.1% for the spiro-OMeTAD counterpart. Our study has suggested that the use of BPTFSI to promote air-doping is not detrimental to device stability.
The operational stability was also tested by tracking the maximum power point under the continuous illumination of one-sun-equivalent light-emitting diode array. After 500 h light-soaking at 55 °C, the PSC with BPTFSI-containing composite of TBPC-611 cell presents an excellent operating stability, retaining 95% of its initial PCE, which is much higher than 64% of the spiro-OMeTAD control (Fig. S26, ESI†).
Conclusions
To summarize, we have synthesized a triple-helicene based molecular semiconductor for the solution-deposition of organic semiconducting thin films for perovskite solar cells reaching 22.1% efficiency. Moreover, the high-efficiency solar cell has achieved a good retention of photovoltaic parameters after 2000 h of aging at 85 °C. The morphology of the triple-helicene based hole transport layer is more resistant to thermal stress than the spiro-OMeTAD control due to the increased glass transition temperature. Molecular dynamics simulation has also suggested that the gas permeability in the hole transport layer should be highly relevant to the decomposition extent of perovskite. Our study has shed light on the use of future materials and device development of durable perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Under the stress of heat, light, bias potential, and moisture, the organic hole transport layer of perovskite solar cells needs to be able to resist the chemical and mechanical damage from diffusive species, protect the photoactive layer, and maintain a stable morphology, which ensures that the extraction and transport of holes do not degenerate. Therefore, it is pertinent to develop organic semiconductors with combined quality factors including the energy level, conductivity, glass transition temperature, and permeation coefficients. Due to the extremely low intrinsic carrier density of organic semiconductors, we stress that a sufficiently high carrier density by intentional or accidental doping is indispensable for a hole transport layer in efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.
