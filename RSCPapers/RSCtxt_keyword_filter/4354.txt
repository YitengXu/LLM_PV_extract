    , Accepted 9th April 2019First published on 10th April 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid double perovskites (OIHDPs) are playing increasingly important roles in the development of stable and lead-free perovskite materials. However, most of them are indirect-band semiconductors with large band gaps which severely limit their development for practical applications. Here we theoretically investigate the intrinsic structures/properties and biaxial strain-induced changes for the monolayer lead-free OIHDP, MA4[AgBi]Br8 (MA = CH3NH3+), and propose to use strain to tune its electronic structures and so optimize its properties. Our results reveal that pristine MA4[AgBi]Br8 has an indirect band gap originated in the inequality of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects on its valence and conduction band extrema and on two directions around the high symmetry point of the Brillouin zone as well, and that the strain tunes the band gap and the Rashba effect, and as a result it mediates the band structure. The band gap of MA4[AgBi]Br8 varies linearly with the strain ratio and a ≥2% stretching can turn it into a complete direct-band semiconductor. MA4[AgBi]Br8 shows different properties under various strain conditions. Compression strengthens the giant SOC-related characteristics including the SOC-induced indirect band gap and Rashba band-splitting, while moderate stretching not only lessens the band gap but also can enhance the carrier mobility and exciton separation. These results indicate that MA4[AgBi]Br8 has the potential to be a stable and non-toxic multifunctional perovskite material. This work also provides some full-scale insights into the Rashba effect on band structures and the correlation between structures/properties and the strain ratio.
1 Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) with the chemical formula ABX3 have become one of the most active fields of composite material research since 2009 due to their enormous potential in the applications of solar cells, light emitting diodes and spintronics devices, and also in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis. MHPs possess fascinating properties such as optimal band gaps for harvesting sunlight, high optical absorption, high charge-carrier lifetimes, low effective carrier masses and long diffusion lengths, etc.1–6 Their optoelectronic properties can also be tuned through independent substitutions on the A, B and X sites. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a perovskite-based solar cell studied by Miyasaka’s group in 20093 in initial research was 3.8%, but then quickly soared to more than 23% in a few years.7 Aside from the high PCE, perovskite-based solar cells also benefit from ease of fabrication and low cost. Despite these advantages, their limited operational stability and the toxicity of the materials remain of foremost concern.1,2,8,9
MHPs such as MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, methylammonium cation, X = I, Cl or Br) have some crucial disadvantages such as sensitivity towards environmental factors such as moisture and heat10–12 and the severe environment toxicity of Pb2+.13 Taking into account the pollution of Pb, several works have suggested to develop Pb-free perovskite solar cells by using metal substitution.14–16 As a group 14 element with a comparable ionic radii, Sn, was first explored to replace Pb in solar cells.17,18 The strategy of completely replacing Pb by Sn has so far been unsuccessful, due to the tendency of Sn to oxidize to the +4 state rather than remaining in the desired +2 state19 Transition metals such as Cu, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and even rare-earth metals have also been found to be promising alternatives to Sn and Pb, owing to their rich chemistries and multiple oxidation states. In the past few years, we have observed a few unique devices based on transition-metal or rare-earth perovskites.20
More recently, many works suggested to exploit the strategy of cation-exchange to design stable Pb-free halide perovskites for solar cells. The idea is to replace two divalent Pb2+ ions by one monovalent M+ and one trivalent M3+ ion, forming a rich class of quaternary halides with double-perovskite structure. All inorganic Pb-free double-perovskite compounds have been synthesized by using heterovalent substitution with monovalent Cu, Ag, K or Au, and trivalent Sb or Bi or Ti.21–32 These compounds have exhibited highly tunable band gaps and low effective masses. Despite their compositional versatility, most halide double perovskites feature wide indirect band gaps, which limit their development for practical applications.
The 2D derivatives of the 3D perovskites are formed by “slicing” the 3D frameworks into well defined 2D slabs with more flexible and deformable structures. A remarkable advantage of the layered perovskites is that their functionality can be easily tuned by incorporating a wide array of cations into the 2D framework, in contrast to the 3D analogs which have limited scope for structural engineering.4 Ultrathin 2D perovskite materials have shown much stronger photoluminescent properties,33–35 and better moisture stability than their bulk counterparts.36–39 Besides, these 2D perovskites, like other 2D materials, may also have special properties as a consequence of the adjustment of tunable structural parameters. By engineering an ultra-stable 2D/3D (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite junction, Grätzel’s group has demonstrated one-year stable perovskite devices.40 Nowadays, many strategies have been proposed to fabricate 2D perovskite materials (e.g.ref. 41–43). Theoretical studies on ultrathin 2D perovskites have mainly focused on the intrinsic properties and defect effects on the properties, or on designing new 2D materials through partially replacing the metal and cations in the crystal structures so that the band structures, carrier migration and other related properties can satisfy the requirement of photoelectric applications (e.g.ref. 42 and 44–46). Our group have performed a detailed theoretical study on how the structures and properties of 2D perovskites vary with the number of layers.47
Very recently, dimensional reduction of double metal perovskites Cs2AgBiBr6 through nanostructuring of the bulk material was reported,48 and layered derivatives of Cs2AgBiBr6 were also synthesised.49 Connor et al.’s investigation showed that the indirect bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 became direct when the infinitely thick inorganic lattice is reduced to monolayer form.49 This trend of property change may lead to different applications of the material. However, when turning to organic–inorganic hybrids, the issues could be different.50,51 Strain could be an alternative choice to tune electronic structures and optimize the properties. Actually, in the semiconductor industry, strain engineering has become one of most common and widespread techniques to tune the electronic structures of semiconductor materials. For example, the strain can enhance carrier mobility of silicon, which has been practically applied in current metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors. The 2D-layered perovskites are essentially natural quantum wells with charge carriers mainly confined in the 2D crystal planes. Compared with bulk materials, they are inherently more flexible and can sustain a higher degree of mechanical strain before rupturing, offering greater opportunities to tune the optoelectronic, catalytic, magnetic and topological properties of the materials.
To develop a type of lead-free 2D perovskite material with heterovalent substitution, we propose to use strain to control the structural and electronic properties of a monolayer Pb-free double metal perovskite, aiming to design a multifunctional material for various uses such as in optoelectronic or spin-based devices. Here we choose Ag(I) and Bi(III) to replace Pb(II) in the MHP lattice because Bi(III) has the same electronic structure as Pb(II). Tl(I) also has the same electronic structure, however it is also much more strongly toxic than Pb(II), so we use the high conductivity Ag(I) instead. A first-principles investigation on the structures and optoelectronic properties of monolayer OIHDP MA4[AgBi]Br8 under various strain effects has been carried out. We calculate the intrinsic structures/properties and the strain-induced changes on them, such as the geometric and band structures, optical absorption spectra, effective masses, exciton-binding energies, and Rashba spin-splitting parameters, etc., by first-principles approaches to show how these characteristic properties vary with the strain ratio quantitatively. It is shown that, under different strain conditions, MA4[AgBi]Br8 could perform differently, indicating that MA4[AgBi]Br8 possesses tunable band gap and electronic properties, thus extending the availability for various applications.
An inherent SOC effect in band structures of Pb-containing HOIPs has been observed, which significantly reduces the band gaps and splits both the valence and conduction bands due to the existence of the heavy atom and the inversion symmetry breaking.52 Since the structures of HOIPs do not have inversion symmetry, the spin degeneracy condition is no longer valid except for high symmetry points of the structure, leading to a band splitting. The momentum-dependent splitting of spin bands has been explained by the Rashba–Dresselhaus (R–D) effect,53,54 which origins from a combined effect of spin–orbit interaction and asymmetry of the crystal potential, and may govern the charge carrier recombination, which eventually controls the carrier lifetime and diffusion length, and therefore the solar cell efficiency for hybrid perovskite materials. In the bulk phase of HOIPs, the same Rashba spin splitting along Γ → Y and Γ → X directions has been observed.46,52 In 2D perovskites, due to the significant structural distortions associated with different surface terminations, the influence of the Rashba effect should be different. In fact, our previous work47 has shown that unlike the bulk phases, Rashba-type splittings along the directions of Γ → Y and Γ → X are unequal in 2D (PEA)2PbI4(N) (PEA = Ph(CH2)2NH3+, phenylethylammonium cation) due to the asymmetry of the crystal potential. MA4[AgBi]Br8 possesses a two-metal core of Ag/Bi, and its structural symmetry is further reduced compared to (PEA)2PbI4 and the relativistic effects of Ag and Bi are also different, therefore the Rashba effect in band structures of MA4[AgBi]Br8 should be different from the monocore structures. In spite of several recent reports on Rashba effects in 2D perovskites, the influence of the Rashba effect on 2D OIHDPs still remains to be determined. Here, we thus calculated the R–D parameter αR (defined as ΔE/2κR, where κR is the momentum shift and ΔE is the difference between the energy minimum of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and its corresponding energy at the Γ-point) of pristine and biaxial strained MA4[AgBi]Br8 in order to characterize the strain-induced changes on the band structure quantitatively. We will demonstrate the unique intrinsic and strain-induced spin-dependent properties of MA4[AgBi]Br8, which provides possible guidance for material applications in spintronics applications.
2 Computational detail
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)55–57 to study how the geometries and electronic structures of monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8 varies with the strain. The Projector Augmented-Wave plane wave basis Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PAW-PBE)57 pseudopotentials in VASP 5.4.1 code with a cutoff energy of 500 eV were utilized to carry out the geometry optimization and electronic properties simulation of all the atoms in the slab. In addition, a vacuum layer of 20 Å was inserted in the Z-direction of the monolayer structure. The generalised gradient approximation PBE exchange–correlation (XC) functional57 with dispersion correction of DFT-D2 method of Grimme58 was applied to optimize the geometrical structures. During the optimization of the geometries, all structures were allowed to relax. Since PBE always underestimates the energy gap, for the property calculations we adopted the hybrid DFT-XC functional PBE059 which includes a fraction, α = 25%, of screened HF exchange. The SOC effect is included in the calculations of electronic structures and photoelectric properties. The electronic constituents are 5d 6s 6p for Bi, 4p 5s for Br, 2s 2p for C and N, and 1s for H. For the primitive cells of the structure, we used a 4 × 4 × 4 gamma-centered k-point grid generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for the bulk structure and 4 × 4 × 1 for the monolayer, respectively. To obtain the detailed band structure, we used a 10 × 10 × 10 k-point grid for the bulk structure and 20 × 20 × 1 for the monolayer, respectively. The minimum energy on the atoms is 1.0 × 10−5 eV, above which the total energy was continuously allowed to iterate.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure variation with the strain
Before we carried out the first-principles calculations of electronic structures and optical properties, we calculated the tolerance factor t,60 of the perovskite compound MA4[AgBi]Br8, which is related to the mechanical stability. The calculated tolerance factor t of MA4[AgBi]Br8 is 0.963, slightly higher than that of the most notable compound, MAPbI3 (about 0.9261), indicating that the structure of MA4[AgBi]Br8 is stable.
The geometric structures of bulk MA2[AgBi]Br6 and monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8, shown in Fig. 1, were optimized, and the parameters and lattice constants of the processed structures are shown below. When the structures change from the bulk phase MA2[AgBi]Br6 to monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8, we observe that both the lattice constants and the bond lengths of Bi–Br and Ag–Br shrink and the Ag–Br–Bi angles tend to be widened (maximum value of 173.17 in MA4[AgBi]Br8 and 162.53 in bulk MA2[AgBi]Br6), indicating that the dimensional reduction makes the monolayer structure become more orderly and flat (Table 1).

To show the influence of strain on the geometry of MA4[AgBi]Br8, we calculated the degree of structural strain of the monolayer by considering the distortions of the inorganic building blocks, namely the [MBr6]4− (M = Ag or Bi) octahedra. The deformation of Oh symmetry involves modifications in bond length of M–Br and angle of Br–M–Br, with changes in slab width (Br⋯Br distances) and Oh volume compared to those of the ideal octahedra slab. The octahedral elongation  and angular variance  have been calculated to characterize the changes by following the definition of Robinson et al.62,63 Here ri are the M–Br (M = Ag or Bi) average bond lengths, r0 is the center-to-vertex distance of a regular polyhedron of the same volume, and αi are the angles of Br–M–Br.
The calculated results of λoct and σoct2 (shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b)) show that the compression increases both λoct and σoct2, indicating that the compression effect may greatly distort the lattice, while the extension is more complicated. It is seen that σoct2 decreases with the extension of the slab, meaning that the tension tends to flatten the single-layer lattice while λoct decreases before stretching to 10% and rises after 10%, inferring that moderate stretching can partly reduce lattice distortion, but excessive stretching can greatly weaken the interior force and make the lattice unstable, indicating that the octahedral coordination of the lattice is unstable and may dissociate spontaneously under such a strong strain effect.
 Fig. 2  Optimized structural data, λoct (a) and σoct2 (b) for MA4[AgBi]Br8 as a function of strain ratio, and (c) formation enthalpy for MA4[AgBi]Br8 as a function of strain ratio calculated at theoretical level of PBE0 + SOC. 
The phase-transition formation enthalpy defined as ΔHf = HMHP − 2HMABr − HBiBr3 − HAgBr provides information about the thermal stability of the structure.64,65 Usually, ΔHf < 0 means that the system has good thermal stability, while ΔHf > 0 means that it tends to decompose thermally. We thus calculated ΔHf (see Fig. 2(c)) while the entropies of all strain systems are not included. The formation enthalpy increases when the perovskite layer is strained, no matter whether it is extended or compressed. When the layer is stretched over 10%, we notice that ΔHf > 0 and it increases rapidly with further increase in strain ratio, indicating that it may be easy to decompose spontaneously with significant strain. So it is evidenced that to keep the perovskite layer stable, a strain of below 10% is required. Thus in the following calculations, we focused on the structures with strain ratio below 10%. However, it is suggested that a strain of 5% has already increased the total energy of the slab by at about 2.5 eV per formula unit. Though the rapid growth of the energy could not destroy the lattice directly when ΔHf < 0, it may produce certain lattice defects into the monolayer structure. In this situation, some measures should be taken experimentally to stabilize the lightly deformed lattice.
3.2 Electronic structure variation with the strain
Before we start to demonstrate the strain effect on the electronic structures of monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8, we calculated its band structure and density of states (DOSs) in the absence of strain (see Fig. 3) and comparison with the results of bulk MA2[AgBr]Br6 can be made. The results for the bulk structure MA2[AgBr]Br6 are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI.†
 Fig. 3  Band structures (units of eV, shown in middle panels) and DOSs for MA4[AgBi]Br8 at the Γ-point (right panels) and all k-points (left panels) calculated by PBE with (a) and without (b) involving the SOC effect. The green trace in DOSs denotes the pDOS of Ag-4d orbitals, the orange traces for Br-4p and Bi-6p orbitals, and the light blue traces for s-orbitals. 
In both structures, the valence band maximum (VBM) contains mostly Ag 4d and Br 4p orbitals, in agreement with other reports,26,29,65 and the conduction band minimum (CBM) contains mostly Bi-6p (with minor contributions from Br-4p). Different from lead-based mononuclear perovskites, Ag atoms have a significant contribution to the valence bands due to their 4d-electrons, which makes the top of valence band increase and the band gaps become indirect. This band-edge orbital composition will definitely affect the property of the band-gap transition of double perovskites, which are supposed to have substantial metal-to-metal charge-transfer character.
Both bulk and monolayer structures do have a wider direct band gap although they are indirect semiconductors. When the SOC effect is not accounted for, the differences between the direct bandgap on the Γ-point and the indirect bandgap are about 0.8 and 0.2 eV, respectively. Similarly to Pb atoms, Bi atoms have a conspicuous relativistic effect. The SOC effect on heavy Bi atoms strongly decreases the energy level of Bi-6p so that the frontiers of CBs are pushed down. The main contribution of Ag is that its 4d electrons generate the VBM level. The relativistic effect in lighter Ag atoms is very weak, therefore VBs are less affected by the SOC effect. When the SOC effect is taken into account, the difference between the direct and indirect gaps becomes small, it is only 0.2 eV in the bulk phase and is about 0.05 eV in the monolayer. Since the extension of Z-direction is terminated when one considers the 2D monolayer structure, and the contribution of Ag-4d dominates the VBM with the dimension reduction,49 the monolayer structure still shows an indirect band gap. However, the difference between the direct and indirect energy gaps become much smaller than for the bulk phase. The SOC-induced CBM valley moves near to the Γ-point, forming a SOC-induced indirect band gap in the monolayer structure.
To obtain more accurate results, we calculated the bandgaps and DOSs of MA4[AgBi]Br8 by PBE0 + SOC with and without involving strain effects. Together with those of bulk phases, we show the results in Table 2, Fig. 4 and S3† (for stretching above 10%), with the band structures of MA4[AgBi]Br8 as a function of strain ratio shown in Fig. 5. The results show that the band gap shrinks gradually with the stretching of the lattice. The bandgaps of MA4[AgBi]Br8 predicted by PBE0 + SOC vary from 2.973 to 1.603 eV with a linear response to the strain ratio. An extension ratio of 5% or above will shrink the band gap for undecorated MA2PbI4 which has a direct band gap of 2.600 eV, making it suitable for optoelectronic applications. Despite the gap being reduced with increasing tensile ratio, too large a stretching too large is not possible owing to reduced thermal stability.

It is universally acknowledged that the SOC effect is induced by the spin–orbit field with odd momentum produced by the crystal field, and those effects only exist in 2D systems with a broken spatial inversion symmetry. MA4[AgBi]Br8 has lower symmetry than its monocore derivatives such as MA2PbI4, so it may have a stronger SOC effect than those monocore halide perovskites.47,50,52,70,71 In fact, we observe very obvious R–D spin splitting53,54 in the bottom of CBs. To characterize the SOC-induced band splitting effect quantitatively, we thus calculated the R–D parameter, defined as αR = ΔE/2κR, with different strain ratio varied from 5% compression to the maximum stretching in its definition. The calculated values of αR are shown in Fig. 6. For monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8, R–D spin splitting in the bottom of CBs around the high symmetry point Γ is unequal, leading to more distortion of the electron wavefunctions and results in a remarkably stronger spin splitting appearing in the Γ → X direction than in the Γ → Y direction, which is different from monocore MA2PbI4 where one can observe the same R–D spin splitting along both directions.47
Like the band structures, the SOC-induced momenta shifting and spin-band splitting are also tunable via the strain. Since compression always gives rise to repulsion of the orbitals of electrons close to the nuclei, it is clear that compression enhances the SOC-induced spin splitting around the CBM (ΔE, shown in Fig. 6). On the other hand, the restriction of locking spins in the linear momenta and spin splitting become weaker when the slab is extended because stretching always weakens the ionic interactions. αR of the CBM decreases quickly with the stretching of the structure, and it shrinks from 0.153 to 0.084 as the strain ratio is changed from −5% to 2%, indicating that stretching can turn an indirect gap gradually towards a direct gap, which is verified by the change of band structures shown in Fig. 5. We also calculated the k-point momenta offsets κR (see the inset in Fig. 6) of the band valleys on the CBM. In the original structure, the energy band minimum is deviated from the Γ point, lying at 0.3332 in Γ–X direction. Compression does not change the value, but stretching has a significant effect on it. When the tension reaches ∼2%, the value has been reduced to 0.2102. When structure is stretched over 5%, the R–D coefficient is undefined because the SOC-induced momenta shifting (κR) disappears, making the band gap finally becoming direct and right on the Γ-point, indicating that the R–D momenta shifting has a negative linear response towards the extension.
 Fig. 6  The k-point momenta offsets kR (a) and R–D parameters αR (b) of MA4[AgBi]Br8 as a function of strain ratio calculated by PBE0 + SOC. The inset in the upper panel shows the Rashba bands, and the definition of kR and ΔE on the CBM. The dashed line represents the value at which the energy is supposed to be for extending stretching beyond 2%, though the actual value is undefined. 
For VBM, the SOC-induced momenta shifting and band splitting are very weak and the degenerated two Rashba bands are very close to each other (<10−3 eV). VBM bands also show little response to strain effect on R–D SOC band-splitting. This unique spin-dependent performance on conduction band tuning with strain suggests possible application to room-temperature spintronics or nano-electric units, such as magnetic-induced devices such as Hall sensors and spin-induced diodes.70,72
Together with band gaps, the curvature of bands, representing the mobility of carriers, also changes with different strain. It is evident that with larger stretching, each band occupies a lower energy level range than for the pristine material, while compressing induces the opposite effect, which can be confirmed by the charge distributions (Fig. S4†).
On the other hand, under excessive strain (see Fig. S3–S5†), the characteristic contribution bands of each atom become more obvious and sharp with the increasing of the strain ratio, indicating that the energy levels become localized gradually. Under this situation, the ionic bands between metal and Br ions almost do not exist, and there is no continuous energy band and this is replaced by a simple transition. So we deduce that excessive stretching (or compressing) could weaken or even destroy the crystal structure, especially in the 2D forms, and inhibit adequate performance of those perovskite layers in photoelectric applications.
3.3 Optoelectronic properties variation with strain
In addition, we have investigated how the optical and transport properties varied with the strain ratio. The optical absorption spectra, effective masses and exciton binding energies have thus been calculated under various strain effects. Fig. 7 and S5† (for stretching above 10%) show MA4[AgBi]Br8 samples exhibiting strong absorption in the wavelength range of 460–660 nm, indicating that MA4[AgBi]Br8 has a strong response to visible light and so may show potential to become a key material for optoelectronic components. The overall optical absorption slightly decreases with an increase of strain. When the structure is stretched beyond 5%, new absorption peaks appear below 2.0 eV, and they become more obvious for a stretching ratio larger than 10%. We observe that the strongest absorption peak red-shifts to the near-infrared region and a broadened region appears in the visible region when the stretching ratio reaches 20% (Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 7  The absorption spectra of MA4[AgBi]Br8 as a function of strain ratio calculated by PBE0 + SOC. 
It is universally acknowledged that the mobilities of charge carriers are closely relevant to their effective masses (m*),73,74 which are related to VBM and CBM features and the bandgap of the material. Hereafter, we calculated the effective masses of MA4[AgBi]Br8 series by fitting the energy dispersions of VBM and CBM to quadratic functions as . Fig. 8(a) summarizes the calculated results at the k-point of Z (0.5, 0.5, 0), which includes the components in Γ–X and Γ–Y. The results reveal that the effective masses are sensitive to the change of strain ratio. In the VBM, the hole carriers become lighter when the structure is extended, and a little compression makes it remarkably heavier. This phenomenon can be explained by the hydrogen bonding between MA and Br ions.75 The force of the hydrogen bonds induces dispersion and flattens the VBM band. With the distances between ions increasing by extension, hydrogen bonds are rapidly weakened, leading to lighter hole carriers, from 27.94% m0 in the pristine structure to 13.46% m0 (m0 is mass of an electron) for 5% extension. Compression is found to lead to opposite behavior. For 5% compression, mh* decreases dramatically to 15.14% m0 because under such strong distortion, the first two VBM bands contributed by Ag-4d and Br-4p orbitals combine as one, leading to a larger curvature and lighter mh* . For CBM, electron mass me* on CBM is 28.67% m0 for the pristine structure, and me* is always lighter while the slab is under strain, either via extension or compression. The reduction of effective mass in CBM with strain can be explained by various aspects. Extending the slab can both push down the CBM energy level and partly reduce lattice distortion. When the M–Br–M angle is moderately straightened to linearity, the overlap of the electron cloud between Br–M ions increases. As a consequence, the charge carriers have lower masses than those in the pristine structure. While when the slab is compressed, the SOC-induced band splitting becomes bigger, leading to an increase of the curvature of first CBM band and lighter me*. So we deduce that band gap tuning of MA4[AgBi]Br8 series via appropriate strain has a marked influence upon charge carrier mobilities.
 Fig. 8  The relative effective masses of electrons and holes (a), dielectric constant (b) and exciton binding energy (c) of MA4[AgBi]Br8 varied with strain ratio calculated by PBE0 + SOC. 
A common sense approach suggests that lower exciton-binding energy results in more effective exciton separation and higher PEC efficiency.47 To describe the optoelectronic features of the materials, we additionally calculated the dielectric constant (ε) and exciton banding energy (Eb) (see Fig. 8(b) and (c)). A Wannier exciton model was used to calculate the exciton binding energy, Eb = E1sμ/ε2.76 Here E1s is the energy of the fundamental state of hydrogen atoms, μ is the reduced exciton mass for electrons and holes, and ε is the (high frequency) dielectric constant. The larger the dielectric constant, the higher the conductivities for materials. It is shown that dielectric constants of the MA4[AgBi]Br8 perovskite increase gradually as the structure is stretched and decrease steeply as it is compressed, indicating that appropriate stretching could improve the conductivity for materials since limited stretching can straighten the metal–Br framework. Similarly, compression leads to the opposite behavior.

b rises dramatically from 35.47 meV to over 60 meV when the structure is compressed due to strong distortion of the lattice and repulsion between ions. As a result of the SOC-induced indirect band gap, compression makes the excitons bind more strongly, indicating that the electron spin of the excited state is more stable, and so is beneficial for spintronic devices. Meanwhile, stretching a little could decrease Eb gradually, from 35.47 meV in the pristine structure to 19.81 meV at 5% stretching. So this is a remarkable proof that limited extending can be effective for exciton separation and conductivity. The variation of exciton-binding energy vs. strain shows that stretching leads to more effective exciton separation, which may favor optoelectronic applications.
4 Concluding remarks
We have performed a theoretical investigation on the intrinsic structures/properties (e.g. the geometry and band structures, optical absorption spectra, effective masses, exciton-binding energies, and the R–D spin-splitting parameters) and strain-induced changes for a monolayer OIHDP. Some novel findings have been observed. For example, we find that MA4[AgBi]Br8 is an indirect-band semiconductor with large energy gap of 2.81 eV and Rashba effect on the extrema of valence and conduction bands is unequal; its energy gaps (both the band and optical gaps) and exciton binding energy decrease with an increase of stretching ratio and a stretching of about 2% can turn MA4[AgBi]Br8 into a direct-band semiconductor. MA4[AgBi]Br8 performs differently under various strain affects. The following interesting conclusions can be drawn.
(1) Monolayer MA4[AgBi]Br8 possesses a slightly distorted structure compared with its monocore precursors such as MA2PbI4 due to the reduced symmetry. Application of strain results in changes in geometric structures. Compression distorts the slab remarkably while moderate stretching flattens the slab, while excessive stretching (larger than 10%) pulverizes the structure, resulting in thermodynamic deformation and lattice defects.
(2) Pristine MA4[AgBi]Br8 is an indirect-band semiconductor with a band gap of 2.81 eV. Its electronic structure is different from MA2PbI4 with the notable difference attributable to the contribution of the Ag-4d orbital to the VBM and the giant spin–orbit interaction in the CBM. Due to the double metallic cation Ag/Bi core of MA4[AgBi]Br8, a combined effect of spin–orbit interaction and asymmetry of the crystal potential results in a giant Rashba effect appearing only in CBMs, which shows a larger effect along the Γ → X direction than along Γ → Y. MA4[AgBi]Br8 shows great potential for room-temperature spintronics applications.
(3) Strain engineering tunes the band gap and the SOC-related characteristics (including the amplitude of R–D band-splitting and the k-point momenta shifting offsets), as a result, it tunes the band structure of MA4[AgBi]Br8. Both the band gap and SOC-related characteristics can be tuned continuously. The band gap varies linearly with the strain ratio. Compression enhances the giant SOC-related characteristics while moderate stretching shows opposite effects toward the band structure. For example, stretching reduces the Rashba effect and it finally completely eliminates this SOC-induced shifting at 5% strain ratio; stretching lessens the band gap and turns MA4[AgBi]Br8 into a complete direct-band semiconductor at ∼2% stretching ratio, enabling MA4[AgBi]Br8 to replace Pb-reliant perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
(4) Additionally, appropriate stretching can not only extend the range of the solar spectrum response but also can effectively reduce the effective masses of its carriers and the exciton-binding energy, which enables more photon absorption and effective separation of photo-generated charges, so benefiting photovoltaic applications. The exciton-binding energy shares the same trends with the band gap vs. strain ratio. It appears that moderate extension could push down the exciton-binding energy to a lower level, leading to strong exciton mobility and higher PEC efficiency. Moreover, the spin-induced indirect gap resists the rapid recombination of the carriers while compressed, and appropriate compressing causes a huge energy gap to maintain the stability of the excitons for longer times.
We conclude that 2D perovskite MA4[AgBi]Br8 with appropriate strain of below 10%, has good potential in optoelectronic and spintronics applications. Appropriate stretching may be beneficial for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications while compression may lend to exciton-related spintronics applications. This work provides some full-scale insights into the correlation between the structures/properties and the strain ratio, and it has some considerable theoretical implications for the band structure tuning and property optimization for non-toxic environmental-friendly perovskites. Besides, this work also suggests opportunities for incorporation of this 2D-layered material into optoelectronic and spintronic devices.
