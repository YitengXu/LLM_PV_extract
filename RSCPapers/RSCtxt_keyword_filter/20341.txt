    , Accepted 24th February 2020First published on 25th February 2020AbstractThe incorporation of bulky organic cations into metal-halide perovskites, forming 2D–3D heterojunctions, has dramatically improved the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these PSCs are typically sacrificed because the formed 2D structures possess larger dielectric confinement, wider bandgaps, higher exciton binding energies and lower charge-carrier mobilities than 3D perovskites. Here, we demonstrate that the environmental stability of PSCs could be significantly improved without sacrificing the efficiency by introducing hydrophobic polyfluorinated cations (CF3CF2CH2NH3+, 5F-PA+) to metal-halide perovskites. Due to the large 2D perovskite formation enthalpy with polyfluorinated cations, the addition of such cations will form a protective layer at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskite rather than forming 2D perovskites. The resultant solar cells based on 5F-PA0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 exhibit a substantially increased PCE of 22.86% compared with the control Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 devices (20.69%). More importantly, the optimized devices could retain 80% of their original PCEs after >3000 h in the ambient environment with a 65 ± 10% relative humidity, which is attributed to the hydrophobic fluorine moieties. This work provides new understanding of the enhancement of PSC stability by incorporating polyfluorinated cations.
In the last decade, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been apace improved from 3.8% to 25.2%, reaching those of traditional solar cells.1–3 However, instability under moisture, UV irradiation, and high temperatures seriously hinders the commercialization of 3D PSCs.4–7 By contrast, low-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites have demonstrated higher environmental stability because of the powerful van der Waals interaction between the hydrophobic bulky cation and the [PbI6]4− units.8,9 In addition, optoelectronic properties of these 2D RP perovskites can be easily adjusted by employing various bulky cations, which makes them promising alternatives to 3D perovskites in solar cells.10
The generic structural formula of 2D RP perovskites is L2An−1MnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2, …, ∞), where L is a large alkylammonium cation, A is an ammonium cation, M is a divalent metal, and X is a halide.11–14 Nowadays, various bulky organic molecules are being tried in 2D PSCs, such as C6H5C2H4NH3 (PEA), n-C4H9NH3 (n-BA), iso-C4H9NH3 (iso-BA), CH3(CH2)2NH3 (PA), propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA), and 2-thiophenemethylammonium (ThMA).10,15–20 To achieve decent efficiency and good stability simultaneously, 2D–3D heterostructured PSCs were developed by Snaith et al.21 By incorporating n-BA into the cesium-formamidinium lead halide perovskite, the 3D perovskite grain boundaries (GBs) were protected by layered 2D RP phases. The authors achieved a 17.5 ± 1.3% PCE and 1000 h stability in air. Liu et al. introduced 2-chloroethylamine (CEA+) into Cs0.1FA0.9Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 (FA = CH3(NH2)2+) 3D perovskite to form the 2D–3D heterostructure, obtaining a 20.08% PCE and 2400 h stability at room temperature.22 To further enhance the stability of 2D RP PSCs, some more hydrophobic fluorinated cations were introduced recently.23–28 A stability of 576 h and a PCE of 13% were obtained under the ambient environment at 70 °C. However, the formation of 2D RP phases will typically cause a blueshift of the absorption edge, leading to less light absorption than in their pure 3D counterparts. Furthermore, a spread of bandgaps in RP perovskite owing to the varied degree of quantum confinement will result in charge-carrier localization, which also hinders further improvement in PCEs.29 Therefore, it will be better if one can develop high efficiency and environmentally stable perovskite film structures without the aid of 2D perovskites.
Herein, with the help of density functional theory (DFT) guided material design, a novel polyfluorinated cation, CF3CF2CH2NH3I (5F-PAI), is incorporated into 3D perovskite. No 2D RP perovskite could be identified in these perovskite films, owing to the large formation enthalpy. A novel film structure of 3D perovskite grains encapsulated by amorphous hydrophobic protective layers is achieved. Such a kind of structure guarantees minimization of photogenerated charge-carrier localization and maximization of light absorption while improving stability. Additionally, because fluorinated moieties have better hydrophobicity than their nonfluorinated analogues, higher device stability can be achieved with this polyfluorinated cation.30 Ultimately, the PSCs based on 5F-PA0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (MA = CH3NH3+) exhibit substantially increased PCE (22.86%) compared with those based on Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (20.69%). More importantly, the optimized devices could retain 80% of original performance after >3000 h at a 65 ± 10% relative humidity, or could retain 80% of their ‘post burn-in’ performance after 1896 h under sunlight. These results provide an effective route to understanding and designing large fluorinated organic cations for efficient and stable PSCs.
To date, fluorinated moieties greatly affect the formation energy of RP perovskite.24 Here, a series of large organic cations were designed and DFT simulations were used to simulate the formation enthalpies (ΔHf) of PA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (PA = CH3(CH2)2NH3+), 1F-PA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1, 3F-PA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 and 5F-PA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3) via the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).31,32 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was used for the electronic exchange and correlation function.33 The energy cutoff was 500 eV and a Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was employed in the calculations.34 All atoms were allowed to relax during the geometrical optimization until the force acting on a single atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. The optimized structures are shown in Fig. S1.† The ΔHf values are calculated to be −0.1174 eV, −0.00796 eV, 0.397758 eV and 0.596591 eV for PA2MA2Pb3I10, 1F-PA2MA2Pb3I10, 3F-PA2MA2Pb3I10 and 5F-PA2MA2Pb3I10 respectively. Among these RP perovskites, 5F-PA2MA2Pb3I10 possesses the largest positive formation enthalpy. Therefore, forming 2D RP inside the perovskite films may be difficult for the polyfluorinated 5F-PAI.
Based on DFT calculation results, the 5F-PAI was used as the bulky cation for mixing with the perovskite precursor according to the designed proportion, and a one-step spin-coating method was employed to fabricate perovskite films as reported earlier.35 The molecular structures of the 5F-PA+ and PA+ are shown in Fig. 1a. To examine the morphology variation of the perovskite films, top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed and the images are shown in Fig. 1b, c and S2.† Compared with the control 3D perovskite film, the films incorporated with a suitable amount of 5F-PAI exhibit an enlarged grain size. These results illustrate that incorporation of a suitable amount of 5F-PAI could facilitate the crystallization of perovskite for a homogeneous and pinhole-free film. However, when the molar ratio of 5F-PAI was further increased to over 7%, the grain size decreased, which could be caused by the 5F-PAI behaving as an impurity and hindering the grain growth.36 After optimization, the perovskite film deposited with 5% 5F-PAI showed the largest grain size. Notably, with the molar ratios of 5F-PAI being increased to over 5%, the flaky analogues increase significantly. We attribute these flakes to unreacted PbI2 rather than 2D RP perovskites, which will be further confirmed below. In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on pristine, 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated and 5% PAI-incorporated perovskite films and the high-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. 1d–f. When the 5F-PAI was introduced, an amorphous protective layer (about 5 nm) formed at the perovskite GBs, which could passivate interfacial defects and enhance moisture tolerance. And, significantly more F elements were found at the GBs compared to the I and Pb elements (Fig. S3†), which further confirmed the incorporation of 5F-PAI at the perovskite GBs. However, an obvious 2D–3D heterojunction structure can be observed in the PAI-incorporated perovskite films.

(h) Magnification of the XRD peaks, (i) absorption spectra, and (j) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine perovskite and 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite with different 5F-PAI ratios. 
In order to examine the crystal structure of the 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskites, thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. Fig. 1g and h show that all perovskite films featured 3D perovskite diffraction peaks and these peaks didn't shift when the 5F-PAI was incorporated at different molar ratios, indicating that these perovskites retained the 3D crystal structure rather than forming 2D–3D heterojunctions.21 In addition, the intensity of the PbI2 diffraction peak increases with the 5F-PAI incorporation ratio. These results further suggest that the increased flakes are unreacted PbI2 rather than 2D RP perovskites. According to a report, a moderate residual amount of PbI2 may benefit the performance and stability of devices.37 However, when the PAI was introduced to the perovskite films, the diffraction peaks of the (110) and (220) planes slightly shifted to low angles (Fig. S4†) owing to the formation of a 2D–3D heterojunction structure.21,22 To probe the effect of 5F-PAI incorporation on optical performance, absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured (Fig. 1g–i). Fig. 1i clearly shows that the linear absorption of the pristine and 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite is very similar to each other. The 5F-PAI incorporation only induces slightly enhanced light absorption at photon energy above the band gap of the pristine 3D perovskite. The enhanced absorption could be attributed to the enlarged grain size and improved film coverage with incorporation of a suitable amount of 5F-PAI.38Fig. 1g shows that the PL intensity of the perovskite film could be largely enhanced with 5% 5F-PAI incorporation. Given the similar thickness of all the films, the largely enhanced PL intensity indicates that nonradiative recombinations are greatly suppressed with incorporation of a suitable amount of 5F-PAI. The reduced nonradiative recombination will also benefit the performance of PSCs based on these materials. It is noteworthy that both the absorption edge and the PL peak position are not shifted, which further confirms that there is no low-dimensional perovskite formation within the films. Retaining the 3D perovskite crystal structure could minimize nonradiative recombination and maximize light absorption within the films. However, for the PAI incorporated perovskite film (Fig. S5 and S6†), the photon absorption edge and the PL peak position are obviously blue-shifted. The PL intensity is also slightly enhanced. These results indicate the presence of 2D perovskite.
To examine the impact of 5F-PAI molecules on the performance of PSCs, planar solar cells were prepared. Fig. 2a shows the typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device, consisting of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. The J–V curves of the champion devices with various 5F-PAI concentrations are displayed in Fig. 2b and the detailed parameters are shown in Table S2.† Compared to the PCE of the pristine perovskite device, introducing 5F-PAI with molar ratios of 1%, 3% and 5% enhanced the PCE from 20.69% to 21.65%, 22.67% and 22.86%, respectively. But, further improving the molar ratio of 5F-PAI decreased the efficiency to 22.31% and 21.63% for 7% and 10% 5F-PAI-incorporated PSCs, respectively. For each 5F-PAI concentration, 20 PSCs were fabricated and the statistical results of device performances are shown in Fig. S7.† Consequently, the best-performing device was acquired with a 5F-PAI molar ratio of 5%, which closely matches with the results from film morphology, crystallinity and optical measurements. Notably, negligible hysteresis is observed in PSCs with 5% 5F-PAI, which can be attributed to the reduced perovskite crystal defects (Fig. 2c and Table S3†).39 Consequently, a stabilized PCE of 22.34% was obtained with 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated PSCs, while a stabilized efficiency of only 19.58% was obtained with the pristine perovskite device, as shown in Fig. 2d.

The stability test for PSCs using pristine perovskite and 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite (g) under light illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in a glovebox and (h) under dark conditions in the ambient environment at 25–35 °C and with a 65 ± 10% humidity. 
The effect of 5F-PAI incorporation on carrier recombination within the device was studied by measuring light intensity dependent JSC and open circuit voltage (VOC) (Fig. 2e). Typically, the PSCs with no space charge effects showed a slope close to 1.40 The solar cell with pristine perovskite gave a slope of 0.92, while the device with 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite gave a slope of 0.96. These results indicate that the 5F-PAI incorporation could efficiently improve the perovskite crystal quality, promote charge carrier dissociation and reduce nonradiative recombinations. Fig. 2f displays the dependence of voltage on the light intensity (I). The diode ideality factor (n) can be calculated using the following equation: (1)where n, kB, q and T are the ideality factor, Boltzmann constant, elementary charge, and temperature. Generally, the fitted n values are located at 1–2, which suggests trap-assisted recombination.41 In the present case, the PSC using pristine perovskite exhibited an n value of 1.68, demonstrating a strong energy loss owing to trap-assisted recombination. For the solar cell employing the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite, the n value decreased to 1.17, showing reduced trap-assisted recombination. This result is in accord with the conclusion from the J–V curves that the 5F-PAI could efficiently passivate the defects of the perovskite films.
The stability of PSCs without encapsulation was investigated under light illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in a glovebox or under dark conditions with a 65 ± 10% humidity (Fig. 2g and h).42 The device performances based on pristine and 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskites were recorded periodically. As expected, the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated PSCs exhibited dramatically enhanced stability. Under continuous light illumination, the lifetime, 80% degradation (t80) post “burn-in” performance, for PSCs prepared with the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite is 1896 h whereas the lifetime of the PSCs based on the pristine perovskite is 888 h. We further monitored the time-dependent PCE variation under dark conditions with a 65 ± 10% humidity. The PCE of Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 devices completely decreased after 1848 h. In contrast, the 5F-PA0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 devices retained over 80% of their initial performance after 3000 h. In addition, 5% nonfluorinated PA-incorporated PSCs were also prepared. The device performances are shown in Fig. S8.† Under the same conditions (a dark environment with a 65 ± 10% humidity), the PA0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 PSCs retained only 20% of their initial PCE after 3000 h (Fig. S9†). The 5F-PAI-incorporated films exhibited stronger water resistance than pristine and PAI-incorporated perovskite films as evidenced by the contact angle analysis (Fig. S10†).43 Therefore, the addition of hydrophobic polyfluorinated 5F-PAI could greatly enhance the environmental stability of the PSCs.
To explore the fundamental impact of 5F-PAI incorporation on charge carrier dynamics, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on the 0% and 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films were conducted. Fig. 3a shows the PL kinetics of the 0% and 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films. The 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite film possesses a prolonged PL lifetime (671 ± 15 ns) compared to the pristine perovskite film (262 ± 20 ns). The enhanced PL lifetime indicates that the 5F-PAI incorporation could effectively suppress nonradiative recombinations, which is in agreement with the results of JSC and VOCversus light intensity measurements. Obviously, the 5% PAI-incorporated perovskite film has a shorter PL lifetime (578 ± 15 ns) than the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite film (Fig. S11†). To calculate the charge carrier diffusion length of the two films, TRPL of perovskite/PCBM bilayers and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD bilayers was measured (Fig. 3b and c). The extracted PL effective lifetimes τeff of pristine perovskite/PCBM and pristine perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD are 7.8 ± 0.3 ns and 10.1 ± 0.3 ns, respectively. However, for the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films, the τeff dropped to 5.4 ± 0.2 ns and 5.8 ± 0.1 ns for the PCBM and spiro-OMeTAD interface bilayers respectively. Based on the drift-diffusion model, the mobilities could be obtained.44 For the pristine perovskite films, the extracted electron and hole mobilities are 0.73 ± 0.11 cm2 s−1 V−1 and 0.55 ± 0.14 cm2 s−1 V−1, respectively. For the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films, the corresponding mobilities are enhanced to 1.1 ± 0.08 cm2 s−1 V−1 and 1.05 ± 0.1 cm2 s−1 V−1 (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, the carrier diffusion lengths can be obtained using the following equation: (2)where μ is the mobility, τ is the charge carrier lifetime and e is the elementary charge. Notably, the pristine perovskite film yields electron and hole diffusion lengths of 693 ± 60 nm and 602 ± 51 nm. However, the corresponding carrier diffusion lengths of 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films are improved to 1372 ± 80 nm and 1331 ± 73 nm (Fig. 3e). The superior carrier mobilities and diffusion lengths in 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films should originate from the large perovskite grain size and effective defect passivation.35 To evaluate the trap densities of the perovskite films, a photo-injected carrier density dependent PL method was implemented (Fig. 3f).45 According to the fittings, the trap density of the control perovskite film was calculated to be 3.3 × 1016 cm−3, which is significantly higher than that (1.6 × 1015 cm−3) of the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite film. These results further confirmed that the 5F-PAI incorporation can efficaciously reduce the trap density and enhance the carrier mobilities and carrier diffusion lengths.

To further probe the dimensionality distribution and carrier dynamics in these 5F-PAI incorporated perovskites, ultrafast transient absorption (TA) was conducted. Fig. 4a–f shows the representative TA spectra of the 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 10% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite films following excitation at 425 nm (1 KHz, 100 fs, ∼0.5 μJ cm−2). The results show TA spectra of all the films matched closely with those reported for the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 3D perovskite,46 which demonstrates that these films should be dominated by the 3D perovskite. Fig. 4a–f also shows that the intensity of the photobleaching (PB) peaked at 730 nm could be slightly increased by incorporating a suitable amount of 5F-PAI, which agrees well with the PL results. In the whole visible range, except the two typical PB peaks (located at 470 nm and 730 nm) related to the 3D perovskite that could be monitored, no other PB peaks related to 2D counterparts could be identified for all the films,24 even at much higher pump fluences and 5F-PAI incorporation ratios (Fig. S12–S15†). The TA kinetic traces are fitted and shown in Fig. 4g. The 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated perovskite film showed a longer lifetime (43 ns) than the pristine perovskite film (21 ns). This elongated carrier lifetime should be induced by the 3D perovskite grains that are passivated and protected by the hydrophobic 5F-PAI, which is also consistent with the TRPL observations. In contrast, there are PB peaks associated with 2D perovskite in non-fluorinated PAI incorporated perovskite films (Fig. 5). These results suggest again that the 5F-PAI incorporation will not induce the formation of RP perovskites. However, at high 5F-PAI incorporation ratios, the excitonic absorption bleaching peak (500 nm) of PbI2 could be detected.47

Conclusions
In summary, the environmental stability of PSCs could be significantly improved without sacrificing the efficiency by introducing hydrophobic polyfluorinated 5F-PAI into metal-halide perovskites. Due to the large formation enthalpy, the addition of 5F-PAI will form a protective layer at the 3D perovskite GBs rather than forming 2D perovskites. Therefore, dielectric confinement, wide bandgaps, high exciton binding energies and low charge-carrier mobilities associated with 2D perovskites could be avoided in the 5F-PAI incorporated perovskites. Furthermore, the trap density in the 3D perovskite could be largely reduced by protection with this amorphous hydrophobic layer. As a result, high-performance PSCs with a PCE of 22.86% were obtained based on the 5F-PA0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 perovskite, which is higher than that of the control one (20.69%). More importantly, the 5% 5F-PAI-incorporated PSCs could maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after exposure to 65 ± 10% humidity in air for 3000 h. This work provides new understanding of the enhancement of PSC stability by incorporating polyfluorinated cations.
