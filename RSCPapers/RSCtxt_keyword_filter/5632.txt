Direct comparison to the non-fluorinated analogue demonstrates that fluorination results in an increase in ionisation potential with no change in optical band gap, and enhanced aggregation over the non-fluorinated polymer. These desirable properties result in a significant enhancement in OPV device performance in blends with PC71BM.
The development of low band gap conjugated donor polymers for use in organic ambipolar transistors, and in particular organic photovoltaic cells has attracted much attention in recent years.1 In the area of OPV a particularly successful strategy for the development of low band gap polymers has been the so called donor–acceptor approach.2 Here a variety of electron rich donor monomers are co-polymerised with electron deficient monomers. The resulting polymers exhibit low band gaps due to the hybridisation of the molecular energy levels.
The donor–acceptor approach is attractive for OPV polymers because the molecular energy levels can be readily tuned by co-polymerisation of the appropriate monomers. This is important since device efficiency is related, amongst other factors, to the product of open circuit voltage and short circuit current, and these can be related to the absolute energy of the donor polymer HOMO and the polymer band gap respectively.3 Since open circuit voltage is related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor polymer, and the LUMO of the acceptor, typically a fullerene derivative, lowering the donor HOMO in energy will lead to an increase in cell voltage.4 In the ideal case, both the donor polymer HOMO and LUMO would be simultaneously lowered in energy with respect to the acceptor, to increase Voc whilst maintaining optical band gap, and therefore light harvesting. This approach should work providing a sufficient offset is maintained between the LUMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor to drive charge separation.
The incorporation of electron accepting groups on the polymer backbone is expected to lead to a simultaneous lowering of both HOMO and LUMO. Here the use of fluorine is attractive since its small size is expected to minimise any undesired steric interactions which may otherwise perturb backbone planarity, whilst its strong electron accepting nature is expected to stabilise the HOMO and LUMO. Indeed the direct incorporation of fluorine onto the periphery of electron accepting benzothiadiazole5 (BT) and benzotriazole6 monomers has recently been shown to increase photovoltaic performance of some (but not all) donor polymers, primarily through an increase in open circuit voltage. However in many instances it has been necessary to include an additional thiophene ring either side of the strong BT acceptor. The resulting motif 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) has been co-polymerised with a number of donor monomers to afford high efficiency polymers.1,2 The insertion of the additional thiophene rings between the donor monomer and the BT mainly serves to reduce torsional disorder along the polymer backbone allowing full delocalisation to occur. However due to the electron rich nature of thiophene, it can also result in an undesirable reduction in polymer ionisation potential and therefore open circuit voltage.7,8 Here we demonstrate that incorporation of fluorine on the flanking thiophenes in DTBT is a useful strategy to overcome this loss in cell voltage without detrimentally increasing band gap.
For the donor co-monomer, we utilised a disubstituted dithienogermole, which is an interesting electron rich donor monomer.9–11 In comparison to the analogous carbon bridged fused aromatic, the inclusion of the germanium bridging group leads to an increase in polymer crystallinity, which can enhance phase segregation in solar cell blends.12 Here we report the synthesis of a novel tetrafluorinated acceptor monomer, 4,7-bis(5-bromo-3,4-difluorothiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TFDTBT), and its co-polymerisation with 4,4′-bis(2-ethyl-hexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole. We directly compare the resulting polymer PGeTFDTBT, to the non-fluorinated analogue PGeDTBT, and demonstrate fluorination improves solar cell performance.
The synthesis of PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT is shown in Scheme 1. Bulky 2-octyldodecyl chains were employed as the bridging groups in order to ensure polymer solubility and processability. The required dibromo-di-(2-octyldodecyl) germane (3) was synthesized in a two step procedure. Treatment of germanium tetrachloride with a fourfold excess of freshly prepared 2-octyldodecyl magnesium bromide, afforded a mixture consisting of predominately dialkyldichlorogermane. The high boiling point precluded purification by vacuum distillation, and so treatment with an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide afforded a mixture which was stable to purification by column chromatography. Treatment of the resulting 2 with bromine in refluxing dichloroethane afforded dibromo-di-(2-octyldodecyl) germane (3) in quantitative yield.

The highly fluorinated acceptor co-monomer 10 was prepared by a two step reaction. Suzuki coupling of the known (5-bromo-3,4-difluoro-thiophen-2-yl)-trimethyl-silane13 (7) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) (8) afforded the fully desilylated product 9 in 73% yield, with cleavage of the TMS groups occurring during the reaction. Bromination of 9 afforded co-monomer 10 in a yield of 66%.
The bridged monomer dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole 5 was synthesized by dilithiation of the known 4, followed by addition of the dibromogermane 3. Purification was complicated by protodesilylation of the TMS groups during chromatography.11 Therefore the obtained mixture of partially desilylated dithienogermoles was treated with mild acid to fully remove the silyl groups to isolate 5 in a yield of 43% from 3. This was stannylated by treatment with n-BuLi followed by (CH3)3SnCl. In common with other reports,9 we found that the monomer was prone to destannylation during attempted purification by column chromatography. High purity monomer was therefore obtained by preparative gel permeation chromatography in 88% yield.
Polymerisation of donor monomer 6 and acceptor monomers 10 or 11 was carried out by Stille coupling under microwave-assisted conditions. After precipitation and solvent extraction to remove lower weight oligomers and catalyst residues, the resulting dark solid was further purified by preparative GPC (chlorobenzene). The resulting PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT had a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 37 KDa with a PDI of 2.8 and (Mn) of 39 KDa with a PDI of 2.5 respectively, as measured by GPC in hot chlorobenzene (80 °C). The similar molecular weight of polymers allows for more accurate comparison of physical properties. The thermal properties of PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The polymers exhibited good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss at temperature higher than 370 °C and showed no obvious thermal transitions between 25 and 300 °C.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT in dilute chlorobenzene (CB) and as a thin film are shown in Fig. 1. Both polymers exhibit similar absorption maxima at 653 nm for PGeTFDTBT and 665 nm for PGeDTBT in solution, and 656 nm and 675 nm in thin film. However the fluorinated polymer displays a clear shoulder at 700 nm in both solution and thin film, with the shoulder increasing in intensity upon film formation, and decreasing in intensity upon heating the solution (Fig. S3, ESI†). Such shoulders are typically indicative of aggregation in the solid state. Interestingly this shoulder is absent in the non-fluorinated polymer, suggesting that thiophene fluorination does not hinder backbone planarisation and in fact improves aggregation, possibly due to non-covalent interactions between the fluorine atoms and components on adjacent aromatics.14 The absorption onset of PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT in solid state are 796 and 788 nm, corresponding to nearly identical optical band gaps of 1.56 and 1.57 eV.

The ionization potentials of a thin film of PGeTFDTBT and PGeDTBT were measured by photo electron spectroscopy in air (PESA) to be 5.28 and 5.04 eV. Cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4, ESI†) of thin films demonstrated similar differences in the oxidation potential, although the absolute values calculated by reference against ferrocene are slightly different (5.50 and 5.28 eV). Both sets of data suggest that the incorporation of the fluorinated thiophene spacers have a strong electron accepting affect. Since the optical band gaps for both polymers are nearly identical, it also indicates that fluorination has a similar stabilising influence on both the HOMO and LUMO.
The charge carrier mobilities of these two polymers were investigated in bottom gate, bottom contact (Au) field effect transistors. The transfer and output curves are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). Both polymers exhibited rather low saturated charge carrier mobilities in terms of FET applications, but sufficient for OPV usage. The fluorinated polymer had a saturated FET mobility of 0.003 cm2 Vs−1, which is substantially higher than the 6 × 10−4 cm2 Vs−1 observed for PGeDTBT. The higher mobility is in agreement with the stronger tendency to aggregate observed by UV/Vis. However in both cases the output curves demonstrate clear indications of contact resistance, in agreement with the low lying HOMO's. The relatively low mobility values measured are probably a reflection of the long and branched alkyl chains used to ensure solubility.
The photovoltaic properties were investigated in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells using a conventional device architecture consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The optimal blend ratio was first investigated with four blend ratios of PGeTFDTBT:PC71BM from 1:1 to 1:4 (w/w) with spin coating from o-dichlorobenzene (Fig. S7, ESI†). The devices were tested under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The optimal blend ratio was found to be 1:2 (see Table S1, ESI†) and comparative devices were therefore fabricated for both polymers at this blend ratio. The J–V curves of organic photovoltaic cells are presented in Fig. 2, with the relevant device data summarised in Table 1. The current densities are corrected for spectral mismatch.

We observe significant differences in performance between the two polymers. The fluorinated polymer exhibits both a higher open circuit voltage (by 0.05 eV) and a much larger photocurrent than the non-fluorinated polymer, although the fill factor is lower. The increase in Voc can be correlated to the increase in ionisation potential (I.P.) observed upon fluorination. However the increase in Voc is relatively small compared to the increase in I.P., which may be indicative of some pinning effects due to the electrodes utilised, or losses due to non-geminate recombination.15 The increase in photocurrent is much larger, almost a factor of two. This increase in photocurrent was corroborated by examination of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2). These are consistent with the absorption spectrum of the polymer blends, and show photocurrent generation across the whole visible range. The fluorinated polymer blend shows a consistently higher photoconversion process than the non-fluorinated polymer. The high photocurrent is qualitatively in agreement with the higher transistor mobilities observed for the fluorinated polymer over the non-fluorinated. However it may also reflect that geminate recombination is more pronounced in the non-fluorinated polymer than the fluorinated, and further investigation into the origin of this effect is in progress.
The differences in fill factor between the two cells may be due to differences in charge collection efficiency, and could be most obviously related to differences in morphology for the two devices. Examination of the surface morphology of the two blends by AFM does indeed show differences, with the PGeTFDTBT film exhibiting a much more homogeneous distribution of domains than the PGeDTBT (Fig. 3). Further optimisation of the blend morphology by the use of surfactants and/or solvent blends may further enhance performance.

In conclusion we have prepared a highly fluorinated 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole monomer and report its polymerisation with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole. The resulting polymer exhibits a low band gap combined with a high ionisation potential, and exhibits a stronger tendency to aggregate than the analogous non-fluorinated analogue. Solar cells device fabricated from blends with PC71BM show power conversion efficiencies of 5.5% in BHJ solar cells without solvent additive or thermal annealing, demonstrating the thiophene fluorination is an effective strategy to further enhance polymer performance in OPV devices. Further detailed investigation into the origins of these performance gains are in progress.
