    , Accepted 9th August 2018First published on 13th August 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 22%, but they exhibit instability in moist environments and at high temperatures. Compared to 3D perovskites, two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites display excellent environmental stability but relatively poor photovoltaic performance. Here, we combined 2D/3D perovskites and simultaneously introduced the cesium cation (Cs+) to fabricate benzylammonium–caesium–formamidinium mixed-dimensional (MD) perovskite (BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite) solar cells. The BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite device with an optimal benzylammonium content exhibits a PCE as high as 19.24%. The improved PCE of 19.24% (BE/FA/Cs MD, x = 0.05) is attributed to great crystal orientation, outstanding surface quality, superior optical properties and enhanced charge transfer. More importantly, the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite devices display superior humidity and heat stability. When subjected to 50% relative humidity (RH) for 1600 h and 85 °C for 240 h in the dark, the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) devices without encapsulation retain 85% and 83% of their initial PCE, respectively. These results provide us with an important method to obtain highly efficient MD PSCs with long-term stability as a next-generation photovoltaic energy source.
Introduction
Recently, the rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) has made organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites become the most promising photoelectric materials due to their excellent properties,1–3 including suitable band gaps,4 prominent charge diffusion lengths,5 low preparation costs,6 low-temperature processability7 and high absorption coefficients.8 At present, tremendous efforts have propelled the small-laboratory-based cell PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to reach a certified value of 22.7%.9
Although PSCs have high PCE, these perovskite materials exhibit intrinsic instability upon exposure to moisture, light, oxygen and heat which has impeded their large-scale commercial application.10–16 Especially, perovskites based on the methylammonium (MA) cation display poor humidity stability due to the pronounced hydroscopic nature and the low formation energy of MAPbI3.17,18 MA-based PSCs also suffer from fast degradation upon exposure to high temperature which is ascribed to the volatilization of the MA cation from the film during heating.19,20 Formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites have been previously reported to exhibit higher intrinsic heat stability than MA-based perovskites and they can be used to obtain more highly efficient PSCs with high humidity, heat and structural stability by introducing the cesium (Cs) cation.21–24
To enhance the stability of PSCs, various efforts have been made,25–30 besides developing stable cesium doped FA-based perovskite materials, two-dimensional (2D) and mixed-dimensional (MD) perovskites are the most considered due to their more tunable optoelectronic properties and higher long-term stability.31–36 However, these 2D and MD PSCs exhibit poor PCE due to their high exciton binding energy, poor charge transport and low absorption coefficient.32 In 2016, Tsai et al. reported out-of-plane orientated 2D Ruddlesden–Popper PSCs with a high PCE of 12.5% and high stability using a hot-casting technique.37 Subsequently, via cesium doping, Zhang et al. acquired 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite devices with 13.7% PCE and enhanced heat and moisture stability.38 More recently, Wang et al. found that 2D–3D heterostructured butylammonium–cesium–formamidinium lead halide PSCs exhibit the highest PCE over 18% among the reported 2D perovskite devices and outstanding moisture resistance.39 Although the photovoltaic performance and humidity stability of 2D and MD PSCs are significantly improved, obtaining higher PCE and higher stability against humidity, light and heat is still an urgent need.
In this study, we introduced benzylammonium into the caesium–formamidinium lead halide perovskite to fabricate MD perovskite [(BE2PbI4)x(FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3)1−x]0.85(FAPbBr3)0.15 (simplified as BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites) solar cells. We explored the impact of different benzylammonium contents (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) on the properties of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites. The results show that the crystallinity, surface morphology, optical properties and charge transfer of the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites were all remarkably improved. When x = 0.05, high-performance MD PSCs are obtained which have an optimal PCE as high as 19.24%. Additionally, we observed that the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite devices exhibited greatly improved superior humidity and heat stability in contrast to the MAPbI3 perovskite devices. The unsealed BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) devices retain 85% of their initial PCE at 50% relative humidity (RH) in the dark for 1600 h. On aging at 85 °C in the dark for 240 h, 83% of the initial PCE is retained.
Results and discussion
Herein, benzylammonium iodide (C6H5CH2NH3I, BEI) was employed to prepare MD mixed-compositional perovskite films based on the general formula of [(BE2PbI4)x(FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3)1−x]0.85(FAPbBr3)0.15 as light-absorbing materials. We tuned the content of the BE2PbI4 2D component with x ranging from 0.03 to 0.05 and 0.10. For a clearer understanding, a simple schematic illustration of the proposed MD perovskite structure is presented in Fig. 1a. The 2D perovskite (BE2PbI4) displays the lattice constants of a = 8.689 Å, b = 9.162 Å, and c = 28.78 Å.40

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of MAPbI3 and [(BE2PbI4)x(FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3)1−x]0.85(FAPbBr3)0.15 (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) thin films are demonstrated in Fig. 1b. The peaks of MAPbI3 and BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites around 14.2°, 20.0°, 24.5°, 28.4°, and 31.8° are assigned to the (110), (112), (202), (220), and (310) crystal planes, representing 3D perovskite characteristic peaks. Compared to the MAPbI3, the strong 3D perovskite peaks of the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites without a PbI2 peak illustrate their great crystal structure. In addition, in Fig. 1c, the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites display a set of diffraction peaks before 10° which belong to the 2D perovskite characteristic crystal planes of (002) and (004), indicating the formation of the MD perovskite structure. In Fig. 1d and e, the peak positions of the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites at around 14.2° and 28.4° slightly move toward smaller angles as x increases. This represents the change of crystal lattice constants due to the formation of a more 2D structure, resulting in an enhancement of band gaps (Eg).
Furthermore, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphologies of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite thin films. Fig. 2a shows the top view SEM images of the MAPbI3 and BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites. The MAPbI3 film displays a very poor surface morphology with many small pinholes and incomplete surface coverage, whereas, outstanding surface coverage is observed for all the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite films. Then, we compared the surface quality of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites with different x values. When x = 0.05, the BE/FA/Cs MD film exhibits a smoother, more uniform and dense surface with low surface roughness. On further increasing x values to 0.10, the film shows a deteriorated and rugged surface with high surface roughness, which makes it difficult to obtain high performance devices. Hence, the highest surface quality of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites is obtained when x = 0.05.

To confirm whether the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites with different x values are advantageous or disadvantageous to optical properties, we examine the UV-vis absorption spectra and normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 3a and b. As shown in Fig. S1,† the Eg of MAPbI3 and [(BE2PbI4)x(FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3)1−x]0.85(FAPbBr3)0.15 (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) films can be calculated as 1.581, 1.612, 1.619 and 1.625 eV, respectively. It is found that the band gaps of the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites (1.60–1.63 eV) are close to that of the 3D MAPbI3 film (1.58 eV), indicating that they have a good absorption range for photovoltaic applications, whereas, an evident decrease in the absorption intensity is observed when x = 0.10. As the amount of introduced BE increases, a mild blue shift in the UV-vis absorption and PL peaks can be observed which is in accord with the slight shrinkage of the perovskite crystal lattice. A more obvious blue shift tendency is displayed in the partially enlarged normalized UV-vis absorption spectra and PL spectra in Fig. S1b and c.† These results reveal that BE is indeed introduced into the perovskite lattice which does not change the intrinsic optical properties of the 3D perovskite.

In order to detect internal charge carrier recombination in the light absorption layer, transient absorption (TA) responses were recorded. The normalized TA responses and detailed fitted charge lifetimes which are fitted using a single exponential decay function are exhibited in Fig. 3c and d. The longer carrier lifetimes directly indicate more superior film properties. It can be clearly observed from the TA responses that the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite film displays a longer carrier lifetime of 119 ns, but the MAPbI3 film only has a short carrier lifetime of 84 ns. This improvement can be attributed to the combination of BE/FA/Cs which is beneficial to the charge transfer in the layered structure of the MD perovskite.39
To exhibit the impact of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites with different x values on photovoltaic performance based on the device structure of FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, current density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion devices were recorded which are shown in Fig. 4a. The complete photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite devices with different x values, it can be found that when x increases from 0.03 to 0.10, the Jsc sharply reduces from 22.85 to 21.72 mA cm−2 due to the blue shift of absorption spectra and the decrease of absorption intensity, but the Voc increases from 1.09 to 1.12 V owing to the augment of Eg (Fig. S1d†). Thus, the PCE has a champion value when x = 0.05, and the champion device displays a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 22.79 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.10 V and a fill factor (FF) of 76.74%, obtaining a PCE of 19.24%. The MA device only has a PCE of 16.53% under the same preparation conditions, which is evidently reduced for the BE/FA/Cs MD devices. In addition, when the content of BEPbI4 increases to 0.10, the content of the 2D structure in the MD perovskite will continuously increase which will cause the Jsc to sharply decrease due to the blue shift of absorption spectra and the narrow absorption range and then cause the PCE to decrease. On the other hand, with the increase of BE content, there is more 2D perovskite in the perovskite layer, and it is hard to avoid some 2D perovskite from being not incorporated into the 3D perovskite crystal, which will stay at the grain boundary and the interface layer of the perovskite layer, ETM, and HTM, leading to the decline of photovoltaic performance.

Anomalous hysteresis has an adverse influence on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.39 Hence, to acquire a better understanding, we measured the hysteresis behavior of the MAPbI3 and the MD (x = 0.05) perovskite devices in reverse and forward scan directions which is shown in Fig. 4b. On changing the scan directions, the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite device demonstrates a negligible PCE variation from 19.24% to 18.69% and displays a hysteresis of 0.55%, but the PCE of the MAPbI3 device changes from 16.53% to 14.86% with a hysteresis of 1.67%. This indicates that BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) PSCs have negligible and successfully alleviated hysteresis. We obtained a stabilized power output at the maximum power point as a function of time for the best performing MAPbI3 and MD (x = 0.05) devices, which exhibit stabilized PCEs of 15.85% and 18.87%, respectively.
Then, we collected the PCE of 30 BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite (x = 0.05) devices; the statistical histogram with a Gaussian distribution of photovoltaic parameters is displayed in Fig. 4c and S4.† It is observed that the average Jsc, Voc and FF of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite (x = 0.05) devices are 21.98 mA cm−2, 1.10 V and 74.53%, respectively. Therefore, the average PCE of BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite devices exhibits a statistically significant enhancement of 14.24%, which increases from 15.80% to 18.05% (Fig. 4c). This proves that the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite can enhance photovoltaic performance with high reproducibility.
The measured incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the integrated Jsc of the MAPbI3 and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite are displayed in Fig. 4d. The IPCE of the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite device shows over 80% from 350 to 750 nm and is higher than that of the 3D MAPbI3 PSC, which is in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 3a. Compared to 3D MAPbI3, the blue shift of the IPCE spectrum of the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) indicates enhanced Eg. We further integrated the IPCE spectra to obtain the calculated Jsc which is, respectively, 20.92 and 22.17 mA cm−2 for the MAPbI3 and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite devices. Compared with the Jsc values from the J–V curve, the integrated Jsc values all show excellent match within 3%.
To investigate the impact of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites on the device stability, we performed the long-term stability measurements of the perovskite devices at about 50% RH and at 85 °C (all devices were stored in the dark without any encapsulation and more detailed ageing test conditions are shown in the Experimental section). Fig. 5 displays the results of humidity stability tests. Fig. 5a shows the normalized PCE variation of MA and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) as a function of testing time. It is observed that the unsealed BA/FA/Cs MD devices achieve improved humidity stability, in comparison with the MA device at about 50% RH. After 1600 h at about 50% RH, the PCEs of the BA/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) devices, respectively, maintain 81%, 85% and 73% of their initial values, which are much higher than that of the MA device (ca. 25%). This shows that the BA/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) device has the slowest PCE degradation and highest humidity stability compared to the other devices. The PCE of PSCs is closely associated with the optical properties, and thus, we also determined the UV-vis absorption intensities of the perovskite films at 600 nm. The normalized absorbance intensity variations of MA and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) in Fig. 5b also indicate that the BA/FA/Cs MD films have higher humidity stability than the MA film at about 50% RH.

Furthermore, the XRD patterns of BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films before and after exposure to about 50% RH were recorded. After exposure to about 50% RH, it can be noted that the intensities of 2D characteristic peaks for BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films significantly increase in the first 400 h and then become weak in the following 600 h. The intensities of 3D perovskite characteristic peaks at around 14.2° and 28.4° gradually become weaker, and the intensities of the δ-phase FAPbI3 characteristic peak at about 11.7° and the PbI2 characteristic peak at 12.7° gradually become stronger, as the aging time increases. However, for the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) perovskite film, the intensities of 3D perovskite peaks become stronger in the first 400 h and then only slightly decrease after 1000 h. It can be inferred that the humidity may induce the formation of 2D perovskites in a short time which will decompose and give rise to the emergence of PbI2 in the following aging tests, but 3D perovskites under the influence of humidity will slightly transform from α-phase FAPbI3 into δ-phase FAPbI3. Therefore, the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskites can maintain 3D perovskite components without serious degradation, resulting in no prominent reduction in the properties of the MD devices.
In addition, we also carried out the heat aging test on the MA and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) devices without encapsulation at 85 °C. It is found from Fig. 6a and b that the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) devices display enhanced thermal stability, compared to the MA device. The MA perovskite device suffers from a striking degradation in PCE and normalized absorbance intensity which, respectively, were only 30% and less than 40% of their starting values after 240 h. In contrast, the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) devices, respectively, retain 80%, 83% and 75% of their starting PCEs and 75%, 80% and 69% of their initial absorbance intensities after 240 h storage at 85 °C.
 Fig. 6  (a) Normalized PCE variation curves of unsealed MAPbI3 and [(BE2PbI4)x(FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3)1−x]0.85(FAPbBr3)0.15 (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite devices, (b) normalized absorbance intensity variations of MAPbI3 and BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films and (c–e) XRD patterns of BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films before and after exposure to 85 °C. 
The heat stability of the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films was further checked using XRD patterns (Fig. 6c–e) after exposure to 85 °C. After exposure to elevated temperature, for the BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films, the changes of all the characteristic peaks are in accord with those of humidity stability tests. This indicates that the changes of crystal structure for these three BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites in the temperature aging are similar to their transformation in humidity aging.
The results demonstrate that the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites display enhanced humidity and thermal stability which are mainly attributed to the components of BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites. Firstly, employing FA-based perovskites without MA+ provides BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites with higher intrinsic stability against humidity and heat.41 Then, BE/FA/Cs MD perovskites can obtain higher structural stability by the introduction of Cs+ and Br− which can be confirmed by Goldsmith tolerance factor calculations. Finally, BE+ and 2D perovskites not only significantly improve the crystallinity and film quality, but also coat the 3D perovskite and protect the 3D perovskite from decomposition by moisture and heat, and thus enhance the stability.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated MD perovskite compositions displaying significantly improved photovoltaic performance and superior long-term stability by combining them with 2D/3D perovskites and introducing Cs+. By adjusting the BE content, we obtained high-quality BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite films with high crystal orientation, superior surface morphology, outstanding optical properties and improved charge transfer, thus resulting in significantly enhanced PCE and operational stability. The BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite device with an optimal benzylammonium content displays an improved PCE from 16.53% (for MAPbI3) to 19.24% (BE/FA/Cs MD, x = 0.05). In addition, the BE/FA/Cs MD perovskite devices display superior humidity and heat stability. The unsealed BE/FA/Cs MD (x = 0.05) devices retain 85% of their initial PCE (at 50% RH for 1600 h) and show greatly enhanced tolerance to high temperature (at 85 °C for 240 h). These findings provide a possibility to develop more highly efficient and stable MD perovskite materials which may become a meaningful direction for further developments in PSCs and the optoelectronic industry.
