E-mail: hong-lin@tsinghua.edu.cnReceived 6th August 2013, Accepted 25th September 2013First published on 26th September 2013AbstractOver the past decade, room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been widely recognized as alternative green, tunable and robust electrolytes for mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their unique properties. The negligible volatility of RTILs renders them more suitable than molecular solvents for long-term device use, while the high thermal and electrochemical stability fulfill the essential requirements for electrolyte applications. In spite of the relatively high viscosities of common RTIL iodides, the mass transport limitations can be effectively alleviated by the contribution of a Grotthous-type charge exchange mechanism. More interestingly, the physicochemical properties of RTILs can be facilely tuned by tailoring their cationic and anionic structures, which provides great feasibility for the specific designing of application-oriented RTILs. In this Feature Article, recent progress on highly efficient DSCs with RTIL electrolytes are summarized, with a special focus on the structural-dependence of the ionic diffusion property in RTIL electrolytes, as well as the charge transport and recombination kinetics at RTIL electrolytes/dye molecule/TiO2 electrodes interfaces. Furthermore, recent advances in RTIL electrolytes with iodine-free redox couples have been reviewed. Crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of future developing low-cost and high-efficient RTIL electrolytes are also discussed.1. IntroductionThe development of clean alternatives to current power generation methods is immensely important to preserve the global environment and assure sustained economic growth.1,2 Introduction of solar powered devices made from nanomaterials holds the potential to impact global energy markets and economic development. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis from porphyrin derivative chlorophyll, which absorbs light and transfers its energy to neighboring proteins in green leaves, mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are currently attracting worldwide scientific and technological interest in virtue of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple fabrication process,3–16 which have been widely regarded as a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices for sustainable energy supply at low cost and high environmental friendliness. In conjunction with a highly volatile iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte and polypyridylruthenium complexes sensitizer, a current validated PCE record up to ∼11% has been achieved among all types of organic photovoltaic cells.17–20 More encouragingly, recent efforts on the novel cobalt bipyridine redox couples have led to a novel PCE record up to 12.3% with meticulous retarding the interfacial back electron transfer.21The major electron transfer processes in DSCs are schematically depicted in Fig. 1. Generally, the kinetic competitions between the forward and back pathways are critical to determining the efficiencies of charge separation and collection.22–25 As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the relevant processes of the electrolyte include dye regeneration, electrolyte diffusion and regeneration, as well as the charge recombination with the injected electron in TiO2 electrode. On the basis of the representative time constants for these processes, it is obvious that competition arises between the electron diffusion in mesoporous TiO2 film and interfacial recombination between injected electrons and electron acceptors in the electrolyte.11 Equally attention should also be paid to the charge diffusion process in the electrolyte, which shows a representative time constant in the same range of microsecond and millisecond. Therefore, massive efforts have been dedicated to improve the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs through tuning the redox mediator,26–31 organic solvent,32–36 and various functional additives.37–39 In addition, regarding the practical application of DSCs, a large amount of researches and development efforts on electrolyte composition have been undertaken to improve the PCE and long-term stability.40–43 Enhanced stability can be expected by modifying the TiO2/dye interface or reducing solvent vapor pressure. The latter is especially important for outdoor applications where cyclic temperature changes require a very robust sealing condition. Hence, it is pertinent to investigate solvent-free room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs),44,45 polymer electrolytes46–48 or all-solid-state hole-transport materials49–51 for utilization in DSCs. Fig. 1  Schematic dynamics diagram of major electron transfer processes in DSCs with I−/I3− electrolyte. The numbers in parentheses are representative time constant for each process. Forward processes include light absorption, electron injection, dye regeneration, electrolyte diffusion and regeneration. The competing loss pathways contain the excited-state decay to ground state and electron recombination with dye cations or oxidized redox couple in electrolyte. Interests in the utilization of RTILs as solvent-free electrolytes in DSCs have grown dramatically in the scientific community over the past decade due to their unique properties, such as negligible vapor pressure, excellent electrochemical and thermal stability, good solvent property and high ionic conductivity.52–57 Generally, RTILs are formed by organic salts containing cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium or quaternary alkylammonium ions and anions from the halide family to noncoordinating ions such as BF4− and PF6−. Some representative cationic and anionic structures of RTILs are shown in Fig. 2. Amongst, RTILs based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium salts have been firstly used as solvents and iodide sources for DSCs as early in 1996.58 These RTIL salts appeared to afford particular advantages over organic liquids solvents for solar cell electrolytes. Cell performance showed outstanding stability, with an estimated sensitizer turnover in excess of 50 million. However, the relatively high viscosity of this imidazolium RTILs appears to limit their PCEs due to severe transport limitations. For instance, the most commonly applied RTIL iodide, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), shows a viscosity of 986 cP at 298 K, which is almost thousand times higher than that of organic solvents such as acetonitrile (0.34 cP) and 3-methoxypropionitrile (1.60 cP).59 It has been identified that the triiodide diffusion coefficients in RTIL electrolytes are generally about 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those in volatile organic nitrile solvents. As a consequence, the efficiency of the regeneration of oxidized sensitizer (S+) by the reduced form of the redox couple is limited, especially at high illumination intensities. Moreover, it has been revealed by laser transient measurements that a high concentration of imidazolium iodide in pure RTIL electrolyte leads to a reductive quenching of the exited dye molecules.60 Fig. 2  Representative structure of cations and anions of RTILs. To mitigate the diffusion limitations, electrolytes based on RTILs generally require a higher triiodide concentration than that of organic solvent electrolyte. It has been acknowledged that doping pure iodide melts with iodine concentration levels below 0.2 M results in poor efficiencies, primarily due to the mass transport limitations affecting the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) values. Further employing PMII along with 0.5 M I2 and the amphiphilic polypyridyl ruthenium sensitizer cis-bis(isothiocyanato)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)(4,4′-di-nonyl-2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Z907) sensitizer boosted the PCE to over 6% under AM 1.5 full sunlight.55 Nevertheless, a high concentration of iodine also increases the visible absorption by electrolytes, thus competing with the dye absorption and lowering the generated photocurrent.54 On the other hand, high concentration of triiodide anions promotes the back electron transfer from conduction band of photoanodes to triiodide anions, thus deteriorating the achievable open-circuit photovoltage (Voc).61Impressively, great advance has been achieved in the exploration of low-viscosity RTILs as robust electrolytes in DSCs to alleviate the diffusion difficulties, rendering the PCE boost from initially 1% to over 8% during the last decade. Satisfactory stability was also obtained under light soaking for 1000 h with full solar intensity (100 mW m−2) at 60 °C. The efficiency progress has been reviewed elsewhere44,45 and will be therefore only briefly mentioned here. More importantly, a molecular insight into mechanism of the electrolyte/electrode interface reaction is highly desirable for further sensible design of more efficient RTILs.62 Herein, recent progresses on the molecular engineering of RTILs electrolytes in DSCs are selectively summarized. Advances regarding the structural-dependence of the ionic diffusion property in RTIL electrolytes, charge transport and recombination kinetics across RTIL electrolytes/TiO2 electrodes interfaces will be selectively reviewed. Incorporation of several advanced characterization techniques such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) in RTIL electrolytes has also been highlighted, which provided reliable evaluation tools for the RTIL ionic structure-modulated dye regeneration and electron injection kinetics in such promising devices. Furthermore, latest studies on RTIL electrolytes with iodine-free redox couples (especially thiolate/disulfide and sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−)) have also been summarized. A brief concluding remarks and future prospects will be given at the end.2. Charge diffusion in the binary RTILs electrolytesBinary RTIL electrolytes with a high mole fraction of iodide source and another low-viscous RTIL were widely regarded as attractive solutions for the dilemma between viscosity and photocurrent density.56,60,63–65 The diffusion-controlled currents reflect the contribution both from the physical diffusion of triiodide and iodide and electron exchange between them, as described by the Dahms–Ruff equation:66Dapp = Dphys + Dex = Dphys + kexδ2c/6, where Dapp, Dphys, and Dex are the apparent diffusion coefficient, physical diffusion coefficient, and electron exchange diffusion coefficient, respectively; kex is the rate constant of electron exchange; c and δ are the concentration and average center-to-center distances between redox species. To understand the triiodide transport in such RTIL electrolytes, detailed studies with different mixtures of electrolytes with various viscosity were constructed.60,67–69 In these binary RTIL electrolytes, lowering the electrolyte viscosity will effectively augment the iodide diffusion coefficient. It has been observed that increasing the volume ratio of PMII from 20 to 50% in a binary RTIL electrolyte increases the iodide flux and the viscosity. The photovoltaic performance also increases considerably due to a more effective dye regeneration at the higher iodide concentration. Further increasing the concentration of PMII decreases the PCE primarily due to the reductive quenching, as revealed by transient absorption measurements.60 The temperature dependence of the Grotthus exchange mechanism on the diffusion constant of triiodide in binary RTIL electrolyte was also investigated by different electrochemical methods.70–72 It was demonstrated that the magnitude of the Grotthus contribution decreased with increasing temperature due to the decreased viscosity with temperature which in turn enhanced physical triiodide diffusion. The Einstein–Stokes ratios strongly increased as a function of the PMII mole fraction and viscosity.Recently, some imidazolium salts with anions such as thiocyanate,64 dicyanoamide,63 tricyanomethide,60 tetracyanoborate,56 triflate,80 trifluoroacetate,75etc. show relatively low viscosities at ambient temperature. Fig. 3 summarizes the structures and viscosities of several commonly applied low viscous RTILs in DSCs with the same cation of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium. Wang et al. first reported the RTIL electrolyte system composed of PMII and a low viscous RTIL, 1-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMIDCA), and lithium iodide. In conjunction with Z907 sensitizer, devices showed an efficiency of 6.6% at an irradiance of air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and even higher PCE up to 7.1% at lower light intensities.63 The use of amphiphilic Z907 sensitizer markedly suppressed the interfacial charge recombination due to the long hydrocarbon chains in the Z907 sensitizer structure, which might interact laterally to form an aliphatic network, thereby increasing the distance between the triiodide and electrons trapped on the TiO2 surface and thus hindering the back electron transfer process. Addition of lithium iodide to pure RTIL electrolyte was also found to significantly enhance the efficiency stemmed from an increase in the electron injection yield and dye regeneration rate. A RTIL electrolyte composed of PMII and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMINCS) has also been used in combination with Z907 dye and a 3-phenylpropionic acid coadsorbent. Efficiencies of the cells were found to be 7.0 and 7.7% under 1.0 or 0.1 sun illumination, respectively. The viscosity of EMINCS is 21 cP and the diffusion coefficient of triiodide is found to be 2.95 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, which is 1.6 times higher than that of pure PMII electrolyte.64 The coadsorbent significantly improved the Jsc from 11.4 mA cm−2 to 13.3 mA cm−2 although the dye loading amount was lowered by 15%. Possible reason for the Jsc enhancement might be the mixed dye/coadsorbent monolayer appeared to be more robust to impair the escape of photoinjected electrons into the electrolyte. These pioneering works have triggered intensive research works on the utilization of other low viscous RTIL. Further utilizations of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide (EMITCM) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMITCB) RTILs conferred to PCEs over 7% under standard illumination condition.60,56 More importantly, device with the EMITCB/PMII RTIL electrolytes demonstrated stable device performance after aging at 80 °C and under AM 1.5 full sunlight at 60 °C for 1000 h. The recent PCE progress and corresponding triiodide diffusion coefficients in RTIL electrolytes have been selectively summarized in Table 1. Spectacularly, cell efficiency using eutectic melt of DMII/EMII/EMITCB RTIL electrolytes reached over 8.2%76 and 9.1%77 under simulated illumination of 100 and 10 mW cm−2, respectively. The cell retained over 93% of its initial PCE over the light soaking for 1000 h with full solar intensity at 60 °C, further confirming the high stability of these devices. This provides practical advantages in realizing flexible devices where the use of molecular solvents not only present technological challenges for sealing but also permeate across plastic substrates.

Anionic-dominated energetic and charge transfer kineticsOne of the most fascinating features of RTILs lies in the fact that their physicochemical properties can be easily tuned by controlling the structures of component ions.81 The viscosity of RTIL is strongly correlated to the interaction between cationic and anionic components of the RTIL, as well as the van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding. It is thus possible to decrease the viscosity of RTILs, and to reduce the transport limitations by altering the component structure. Binary RTIL electrolytes were constructed by mixing PMII with different anions based low-viscous RTILs, i.e., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (EMIPF6), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetic acid (EMIATF).82 The apparent diffusion coefficient of triiodide species, viscosity, and ionic conductivity over a wide temperature range were investigated systematically. It was revealed that both the diffusibility of the electrolyte and the photovoltaic performance showed a strong dependence on the anionic structures. As tabulated in Table 2, the anionic structure-dependent physical property of the RTILs electrolytes were discussed in terms of the van der Waals radius, the atomic charge distribution over the anion backbones, the interaction energy of the anion and cation coupled with the presence of ion-pairs and ion aggregates. Among these structural parameters, the anionic donor ability, more intrinsically, the negative charge distribution over the anion backbones was suggested to be the dominant factor for the fluidity dependence. It has been well illustrated that the relatively high anionic donor ability of ATF− anion derives from the large negative charges on the oxygen atoms and its asymmetric distribution. For the moderately donating TFSI− anion, the negative charges are symmetrically distributed on the nitrogen and four oxygen atoms, while the low anionic donicities of BF4− and PF6− anions can be attributed to the equally distributed negative charge on the fluorine atoms and to the small absolute values.83 It was further revealed that increasing the fluidity of the RTIL electrolytes not only significantly decreased diffusion resistance of I3− in the RTIL electrolytes, but also effectively shielded the charge recombination reaction between the injected electrons with triiodide species in the RTIL electrolyte, thus improving the effective electron lifetime and the electron diffusion length in the corresponding device.

A comparison study was made between tetracyanoborate (TCB−) and dicyanamide (DCA−) anions in solvent-free RTIL electrolytes upon the optoelectronic features of DSCs.84 With respect to DCA− anion, TCB− counterpart confers a bathochromic and higher photocurrent response upon a dye-coated mesoporous TiO2 film, together with a downward displacement of Ec, thus generating a more favourable energy offset at the TiO2/dye interface accompanied with a better exciton dissociation yield.84 Moreover, such a high Ec position of titania in contact with DCA− containing electrolyte were supported by the negative charge density distribution from quantum calculations85,86 and dipole moment (μD) from density functional theory (DFT)87 as illustrated in Fig. 4. Based on the quantum calculations, a higher negative charge density could cause a strong coordination of nitrogen with the unsaturated titanium species on the mesoporous TiO2 film, uplifting Ec as the commonly applied 4-tert-butylpridine (TBP) additive does.85,86 Further DFT calculations afforded the μD of the TCB− anion, which is highly symmetrical, to be zero, while the μD of DCA− anion reaches ∼0.5 D. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, a dipole pointing from electrolyte toward titania tends to prompt a conduction band edge elevation,87 thus explaining the relatively higher Ec position of TiO2 in contact with DCA− containing electrolyte than that for the TCB− counterpart. Additionally, the negative impact of an about four times higher recombination reaction rate constant of the DCA− cell is overwhelmed by the noticeably high Ec position, leading to the experimentally observed anion-dependent Voc. Further implementation with a high absorption coefficient ruthenium sensitizer (C106),88 a slightly shorter photoluminescence lifetime of C106 grafted on alumina is probed for TCB− based reference cell with respect to DCA− counterpart. However, owing to a more favourable thermodynamic driving force of almost 90 meV, the TCB− anion prompts an almost three fold faster electron injection from the excited-state dye to TiO2 than that in DCA−, leading to a higher charge separation yield, which is in good agreement with an almost indistinguishable ratio of external quantum efficiency enhancement in the whole spectral response region. Similar demonstrations of DCA− effect on the surface states and electron transport in the mesoporous semiconducting film have also been witnessed in conjunction with the tetrahydrothiophenium-based89 and N-methyl-N-allylpyrrolidinium based90 RTILs electrolytes.

The electron injection efficiency is another important factor that governs the overall photovoltaic performance. Femtosecond TAS was recently applied to investigate the electron injection efficiency of N719 sensitized TiO2 system in the presence of two different RTILs varying their anionic counterparts (TCB− and DCA−), while keeping the cationic counterpart (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, EMI+) invariant.91 TAS technology is widely employed to observe the electron injection process in DSCs, and the reaction mechanism has been understood as a function of the sensitizer dye, semiconductor, and electrochemical environment.22,92–94 The effect of RTIL environments on the metal−ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band of the adsorbed N719 on mesoporous TiO2 film was probed by steady state absorption spectroscopy, and the effect on cyano stretching frequency of RTILs in the presence of TiO2 films was investigated using attenuated total reflectance-IR (ATR-IR) method. From the results of ATR-IR, it was suggested that DCA− anions adsorbed on TiO2 surface more favorable than TCB− anions, indicating a more negatively charged condition for TiO2 surface in the presence of EMIDCA electrolyte. Based on the TAS data, it was found that the electron injection efficiency was higher in the N719/TiO2 system in the presence of EMITCB environment than that of EMIDCA by ∼20%, as demonstrated in Fig. 5, which is mainly due to the modulation of the Ec energy of TiO2 nanoparticles in different RTIL electrolytes.84 Fig. 5  Femtosecond time profile of N719/TiO2 in different RTIL environments at room temperature, with excitation wavelength of 532 nm and probe wavelength of 800 nm (excitation energy = 0.2 mW).

Cation-correlated electron transfer and dye regeneration kineticsGenerally, cations provide electroneutrality in the electrolytes and not explicitly appear in the cell function of a DSC device. However, several recent investigations indicated significant influences of the cations upon primary processes relevant to the overall dynamic of DSC, such as electron injection yield,95,96 electron life times,38 and the rate of regeneration of photo-oxidized dye.97 The cations also affect electron diffusion coefficient in the photoanodes because the transport of electrons is accompanied by the diffusion of counterion charges in the electrolyte.98,99 As mentioned in the introduction part, a high concentration of redox couple is generally needed to ensure efficient dye regeneration in most of the RTIL electrolytes. As a consequence, the cationic effect in the RTIL electrolytes should not be ignored.Studies on the physicochemical properties of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium RTILs have found that viscosity of the RTILs increases with the alkyl chain length due to the strengthen of the van der Waals forces.52,107 Consequently, the conductivity of the RTIL decreases due to the low mobility of the ions in the viscous liquids. At the early period of the application of RTILs in DSCs, it has been demonstrated that the Jsc increased with lengthening the alkyl chain up to C7 in the imidazolium family and then started to decline.52 Apart from the alkyl imidazolium cation, other RTILs with cations such as sulfonium,100,108 guanidinium,101,102 ammonium,103 or phosphonium104–106,109 have also been explored but showed low device efficiencies due to mass transport limitation. Table 3 selectively summarized the photovoltaic parameters with the reported non-imidazolium RTIL electrolytes. Apparently, the PCEs of such imidazolium-free systems are restricted by the diffusion limitations originated from the relatively high viscosities. The observed apparent triiodide diffusion coefficients were almost one order of magnitude lower than that of high efficiency imidazolium counterpart. Recently, efficiency enhancements were obtained in conjunction with tetrahydrothiophenium-based89 and N-methyl-N-allylpyrrolidinium based90 RTILs.

Comparable efficiencies were obtained from electrolytes with pyridinium iodide salts in conjunction with N719 sensitizer.111 It is further disclosed the structural variation of the pyridinium cation directly correlates with the device performance. For instance, when a pyridinium ring is modified to picolinium bearing a methyl group, a notable Voc drop has been observed. However, the length of the alkyl chains on the pyridinium ring does not affect Voc of the devices. The odd-numbered alkyl chains show slightly lower Voc compared to that of even-numbered, probably due to the different packing structures and densities of the pyridine configuration on the TiO2 surface.111 Moreover, N-ethylpyridinium iodide (NEPI) has been employed as an alternative iodide source in DSC electrolyte, featuring high ionic conductivity and superior electroactivity. Encouraging PCE up to 8.23% was achieved through judicious interfacial molecular engineering in combination with an acetonitrile solvent electrolyte.110 The kinetic electron transport and recombination analysis from intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) indicated that the electron diffusion coefficient in the TiO2 electrode was considerably higher in the surrounding of NEPI-based electrolyte primarily due to a more shallow distribution of the surface trap states after the adsorption of pyridinium cations on the TiO2 electrode surface.110SECM technique has also been used to investigate the kinetics of dye regeneration on N719/TiO2 electrodes in contact with different RTILs electrolytes.112 Specifically, EMITFSI electrolyte was compared to acetonitrile electrolytes containing various concentrations of intentionally added Li+, 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium (DMPI+), and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) cations. The effective rate constant for the dye regeneration process was derived from a revised model for relating steady state approach curves in the SECM feedback mode. It has been noted that acetonitrile electrolytes resulted in a faster N719 regeneration rates than that of EMITFSI. A remarkable dependence of the dye regeneration rate on the nature and concentration of deliberately added cations in the electrolytes has also been revealed. For instance, as shown in Fig. 6, it was found a monotonic decrease in the effective dye regeneration rate constant (keff) with increasing cation concentration for each of the investigated cations. A similar decline behavior was noticed for DMPI+ and Li+, however a more gradual decrease in keff was observed for TBA+. These differences were primary related to their structural characters, such as cationic size and adsorption properties.38,113,114 Lithium inclusion in electrolyte has been widely used in DSCs, where Li+ adsorbs onto the metal oxide surface and increases the charge injection efficiency of dyes by shifting the Ec to more positive potentials.115,116 It was also reported that imidazolium cations can adsorb on the metal oxide surface and align the anion species due to electrostatic interaction, and thereby facilitate electron transport.117 TBA+ is bulkier and probably less adsorptive on the nanostructure electrode surface than DMPI+.114 The larger size of TBA+ could increase the double layer thickness for TBA+-containing electrolytes, therefore the concentration of I− near the N719/TiO2 surface could decrease and hence lower the dye regeneration rate at the conducting electrodes surface.

RTILs based on iodine-free redox couplesEfforts to replace the ubiquitous I−/I3− electrolyte redox couple has been recognized as a critical hot topic due to its disadvantages in terms of corrosion of metal-based current collectors (especially for silver), evaporation losses, and visible light absorption.31,41 Clearly, development of non-corrosive redox mediators with reduced mismatch between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox couple, is of vital importance to enhance the PCE and also to promote the commercialization of such photovoltaic technology.28,30,31,40,118–123 Until now, three main kinds of iodine-free electrolytes, based on metal complexes,28–30,124,125 inorganic materials,65,126,127 or organic redox couples,26,119,128,129 have been developed. Encouragingly, meticulous device and sensitizer engineering in conjunction with the cobalt complex redox shuttles gives rise to a new PCE record up to 12.3% under AM 1.5 G sunlight recently.21 However, these iodine-free electrolytes also contain volatile organic solvents, which significantly restricts the long-term stability of such electrolytes.Pseudohalides of SCN−/(SCN)2 and SeCN−/(SeCN)2 have been employed as iodine-free redox couples with the standard N3 sensitizer.127 The standard equilibrium potentials of the SCN−/(SCN)2 and SeCN−/(SeCN)2 couples are respectively 0.19 and 0.43 V more positive than that for I−/I3− couple. However, upon shifting the redox equilibrium potential more positive, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was found to decrease by a factor of 4 for (SeCN)2/SeCN− and a factor of 20 for (SCN)2/SCN− compared with I−/I3−. TAS studies demonstrated that the lower efficiencies are related to a slower dye regeneration rate with SCN− or SeCN−. RTIL electrolyte with (SeCN)3−/SeCN− redox couple was constructed with a low viscous ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium selenocyanate (EMISeCN).65 The viscosity of pure EMISeCN was determined to be 25 cP at 21 °C, thus generating a diffusion coefficients of SeCN− and (SeCN)3− of 2.80 × 10−6 and 1.28 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively, which were about 9 and 7 times higher than the respective values for iodide and triiodide in the pure PMII ionic liquid. Corresponding device exhibited an IPCE exceeded 80% in a spectral range from 470 to 580 nm and reached a maximum of 85% at 550 nm. The photovoltaic parameters of Jsc, Voc, FF of the above device were 14.56 mA cm−2, 699 mV, and 0.735, respectively, yielding a PCE of 7.5%. At low light intensity of 30 mW cm−2, the efficiency even reached 8.3%. Such a PCE is unprecedented for solvent-free non-iodide redox RTIL electrolytes.Analogous to the formation of common I−/I3− system based RTIL electrolytes, recent approaches to formulate new iodine-free redox mediators based RTIL electrolyte adopts a suitable thiolate salt and another solvent RTIL with low viscosity.130 Pioneering studies on the utilization of thiolate based RTILs in DSCs were conducted by Sun et al. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, thiolate RTILs of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazole-modified mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole (EMIMMT) and 1-hexyl-2,3-dimethylimidazole-modified mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMHIMMT) were blended with its corresponding disulfide dimer (BMT) to formulate the iodine-free RTILs electrolytes. A PCE of 3.4% was achieved for devices based on the RTIL electrolyte with EMIMMT/BMT redox couple under 10 mW cm−2 illumination.130 However, the mass-transport limitations stemming from the relative high viscosity of 100 cP for EMIMMT restricted the photovoltaic performance under high illumination intensities. A large cathode resistance could presumably be caused by the high viscosity of the RTIL solvents as well as the poor electrocatalytic activity of conventional platinized cathode towards these iodine-free RTIL electrolytes. Fig. 7  Structures of several iodine-free redox couple based RTILs (EMIMMT: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazole-modified mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole; BMT: disulfide dimer; DMHIMMT: 1-hexyl-2,3- dimethylimidazole-modified mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole; BMPyS: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium sulfide; TMAS: tetramethylammonium sulfide; DMPIS: 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium sulfide). In order to further decrease the viscosity of organic solvent-free electrolytes, subsequent works introduced 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMITCB) to prepare a thiolate/disulfide RTIL electrolyte with low viscosity.131 Additionally, CoS cathode was incorporated and exhibited better catalytic activity and thus better photovoltaic performance than that with the platinized cathodes. A PCE up to 4.4% with a Jsc of 1.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 620 mV and a FF of 0.68 was obtained under 0.1 sun irradiation. At even lower intensity of 5 mW cm−2, efficiency up to 5.0% was achieved. Moreover, preliminary stability tests of these thiolate RTIL electrolytes under dark conditions at room temperature showed stable photovoltaic properties over 220 h. Novel electrolytes with S2−/Sn2− redox couple and iodide RTIL were also prepared recently, reaching efficiencies of 5.2–6.4% under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, as well as 6.6% efficiency under 0.1 sun irradiation.132 Two kinds of sulfide sources, tetramethylammonium sulfide (TMAS) and 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium sulfide (DMPIS) were prepared to formulate RTIL electrolytes in combination with iodide source RTIL, such as PMII and the eutectic mixture of EMII and DMII. The binary redox systems of (S2−/Sn2− and iodide) exhibit significantly lower light absorption in the visible light region than the standard I−/I3− electrolytes. Moreover, the presence of S2− in the RTIL electrolyte may suppress the formation of I3− and the redox potential of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple is more positive than that of I−/I3− redox couple,133 together with a negatively shift of the Ec of TiO2 electrode as determined from the capacitance–voltage Mott–Schottky method, yielding a notable higher Voc than that of I−/I3− redox couple counterpart. Interestingly, similar application of these robust S2−/Sn2− RTIL electrolytes has been designed for compatibility with CdSe quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).134 Device with a pyrrolidinium RTIL (1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium sulfide, BMPyS) electrolyte reached 1.86% efficiency and a Jsc close to 14 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination and improved the device lifetime with good stability over 240 h.6. Conclusions and outlookDuring the foregone decades, RTILs have received great interest as solvent-free electrolytes for robust DSCs in virtue of their unique properties embracing negligible volatility, high thermo- and electrochemical stability, the ability to dissolve a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds. Meanwhile, RTILs have been denoted as “tunable” solvents since their physicochemical properties can be readily varied by modification the anionic and/or cationic components. Commendable progress has been staggering as PCEs of RTIL-based DSCs have risen from initially 1% to ca. 9% in recent publications. Satisfactory stability was also obtained under light soaking for 1000 h with full solar intensity (1 000 W m−2) at 60 °C. These trends will definitely continue as we develop a growing understanding of the fundamental factors that rule the complex behavior of RTILs, especially the electron transfer and recombination dynamics at the RTIL electrolyte/dye/nanocrystalline electrode interface. Further comprehensive analysis to draw an explicit microscopic picture of the interaction between the RTIL structural components (both anions and cations) and titania electrode or dye molecules should also draw attention with the aid of some modern physical characterization techniques, such as SECM and femtosecond TAS, as well as quantum calculations and density functional theoretical investigation.Recent progress with the novel iodine-free redox couples intrigued the urgent demand for formulation of RTILs containing those non-corrosive redox mediators for the sake of good long-term stability as well as photoanode and/or dye molecule compatibility. Mimicking the formation of common iodide RTILs systems, various cationic structures has been incorporated in these iodine-free RTIL electrolytes, such as imidazolium, pyrrolidinium and ammonium in combination with thiolate/disulfide or S2−/Sn2− redox couples. Efficiencies up to 6% have been gained under low incident illumination of 10 mW cm−2, indicating an attractive potential for indoor application. However, significant mass-transport limitations stemming from the relative high viscosities of these iodine-free RTILs and poor electrocatalytic activity of traditional platinized cathodes should be addressed for further efficiency enhancement. The recent advances in nanostructured materials of both semiconductors and catalysts will definitely contribute increasing momentum to this development.During the preparation of this Feature Article, the organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskites light harvesters has attracted great attention due to its superb light-harvesting characteristics, as highlighted in some recent Perspectives.135,136 Recent reports of efficiencies of 12–15% have led to make the bold prediction of “The Next Big Thing in Photovoltaics”.137–141 The excellent light harvesting property entails to reduce the electrodes thickness to sub micrometer, which might perfectly resolve the current mass transport limitation of RTILs based devices. Efficiency bottleneck breakthrough can be anticipated when the compatibility between light absorber, RTIL electrolyte and cathode material has been well handled.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the financial support provided by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2006AA03Z218 and 2011AA050522), the International Cooperation S&T Cooperation Program of China (2010DFA64360, 2013DFG53010), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (50672041, 51272126) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2062013).Notes and referencesN.
