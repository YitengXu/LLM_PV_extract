    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 27th July 2018AbstractA hole transport layer (HTL) plays a key role in efficient hole extraction and transfer in inverted planar perovskite solar cells. A 10–20 nm thick poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer is the most popular HTL in such a device structure. But is it essential to construct such a thick PEDOT:PSS layer? To address this question, herein self-assembled PEDOT:PSS monolayers are obtained on the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface through a facile water rinsing process. Perovskite solar cells with water rinsed PEDOT:PSS as a HTL yield improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 13.4% to 18.0%, compared with the control cells with as-cast PEDOT:PSS. The main contribution is from the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Characterization indicates that the majority of PEDOT:PSS is washed away, but an ultra-thin layer of PEDOT:PSS can attach strongly onto ITO via In–O–S chemical bonds between the PSS chain and ITO. Subsequently, PEDOT and PSS form a bilayered structure due to Coulomb interaction. Such an arrangement induces an oriented electric field from positively charged PEDOT to negatively charged PSS, which can accelerate the process of hole extraction. Moreover, the oriented arrangement of PEDOT:PSS monolayers provides higher work function and stronger hydrophobicity, leading to the enhancement in Voc and stability in the ambient environment. This work suggests that there is still room for the efficiency improvement of perovskite solar cells by optimizing the traditional functional layers.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials have attracted tremendous research interest due to their excellent optoelectronic properties since they were first introduced as light harvesting materials in dye-sensitized solar cells.1 After a series of device architecture innovation,2–4 component optimization,5–9 and interface engineering,10–14 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has surged to the latest published record of more than 22% within a short time span.15 A planar inverted p–i–n structure is a promising configuration with low processing temperature and simple fabrication procedures, so it is more close to commercialization, as compared with the mesoporous architecture.16–19
To achieve highly efficient and low-cost inverted PSCs, much effort has been devoted to the discovery of high-performance hole transport layers (HTLs).11,17,20–25 Until now, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been the most popular HTL material due to its good processibility, high thermal stability, good mechanical flexibility, sufficient optical transparency, and suitable energy levels.10,23,26–31 Usually PEDOT:PSS HTLs are formed on transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide (ITO) by solution-processing techniques.32,33 The thickness ranges from 10 to 20 nm depending on the viscosity of PEDOT:PSS solution, the deposition rate and so on.34–36 To date, no report considers whether a much thinner PEDOT:PSS layer could be better than the as-cast thick PEDOT:PSS HTL. In fact, due to the hygroscopic and acidic properties of the PSS polyelectrolyte, a thick PEDOT:PSS HTL causes deterioration of a perovskite film.37 Moreover, a thick HTL without oriented internal electric field could lead to back-recombination of carriers.4 Meanwhile, inadequate coverage of the ITO surface would also result in poor performance because of leakage currents.37–39 Therefore, the ideal PEDOT:PSS HTL should be oriented monolayers of PEDOT:PSS that contain minimum amount of PSS and cover the entire ITO surface.
In this work, we present a facile approach to fabricate oriented PEDOT:PSS monolayers via spin coating ultrapure water on the PEDOT:PSS film surface. The results show that the majority of PEDOT:PSS can be rinsed away, leaving an ultra-thin PEDOT:PSS monolayer on the ITO surface. The PSS chains of the remaining PEDOT:PSS are linked to ITO by In–O–S chemical bonds; and the PEDOT component stays on top of PSS via Coulomb interaction. Such a bilayered structure leads to a directional electric field from PEDOT to ITO bonded PSS, which is beneficial for the extraction of holes and transfer from the active layer to the ITO electrode. As a result, the best device based on water rinsed PEDOT:PSS achieved a PCE as high as 18.0%, compared to 13.4% of the control device. The enhanced performance is attributed to the comprehensive improvement of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). Device stability is also improved after water rinsing, owing to the more hydrophobic surface of the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS. Our results suggest that there is still much room for improvement even in the classic cell architecture and most common materials.
Experimental
Materials
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al 4083) aqueous solution was purchased from Heraeus and used without further treatment. The weight ratio of PEDOT to PSS was 1:6, and the weight concentration of PEDOT:PSS was 1.3–1.7%. Rhodamine 101 (RhB101), PbCl2 (>99.99% purity), and PbI2 (>99.99% purity) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl iodide (PC61BM, >99.5%) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, >99.5%) were supplied by Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All other solvents, like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99%) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL, >99% purity) were purchased from Admas. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
Inverted planar perovskite solar cell devices were fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The substrates were sequentially cleaned by ultra-sonication in detergent solution, deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. They were blow dried with nitrogen and then UV-ozone treated for 30 min before using. The HTLs were fabricated by spin coating a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution filtered through a 0.45 micron Teflon filter at 8000 rpm for 40 seconds, and then annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 20 min. After the films were cooled down to room temperature, water rinsing of PEDOT:PSS films was carried out by adding 150 μl of ultrapure water dropwise onto the spinning PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate (8000 rpm for 40 seconds), followed by annealing at 120 °C for 5 min. The MAPbI3−xClx, PC61BM, and RhB101 layers were fabricated in a glove box with dried nitrogen (O2 < 10 ppm; H2O < 1 ppm). The perovskite precursor solution was prepared using a mixture of 1.26 M (581 mg) PbI2, 0.14 M (39 mg) PbCl2 and 1.3 M (209 mg) MAI in 1 ml co-solvent of GBL:DMSO (7:3 volume ratio). The perovskite films were obtained by spin coating 50 μl precursor solution at 1000 rpm for 20 s and then 3500 rpm for 40 s. Notably, 1 ml toluene was injected directly onto the spinning film 15 s before the end of the spin coating process. The perovskite films were put in a low vacuum (0.2 bar) for 1 min before being annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. PC61BM dispersed in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 23 mg ml−1 was deposited on the perovskite layer by spin coating at 2500 rpm for 40 s. After this, 60 μl RhB101 with a concentration of 0.6 mg ml−1 was spin coated on top of the PCBM layer at 1500 rpm for 30 s. LiF (1.2 nm) and Ag (100 nm) with an active area of 0.11 cm2 were deposited in a thermal evaporation chamber at a base pressure of approximately 8 × 10−7 mbar.
Device characterization
Optical properties including transmittance and absorption were measured using a Shimadzu UV-1800 UV-vis spectrophotometer. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse, Agilent) with an excitation wavelength of 486 nm was used to collect steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-7800F field emission scanning electron microscope. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed using an axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with or without irradiation using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, 2612A) that is calibrated by using a silicon reference cell to provide a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
PEDOT:PSS, whose chemical structure is depicted in Scheme 1(a), is essentially a polymer composite integrated via Coulomb interaction between negatively charged PSS and positively charged PEDOT. In this work, after obtaining a pristine PEDOT:PSS film on ITO by spin coating and thermal annealing, ultrapure water is dripped on the spinning PEDOT:PSS film to wash away majority of components (details can be found in the Experimental part). Such a water-rinsed PEDOT:PSS film (denoted as “Water rinsed”) is employed as a HTL in perovskite solar cells whose architecture is shown in Scheme 1(b). Fig. 1a depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best control device and water-rinsed PEDOT:PSS based PSCs under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The control device with a pristine PEDOT:PSS HTL exhibits a PCE of 13.4%, with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 18.48 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.3%. In comparison, the device fabricated on water rinsed PEDOT:PSS achieved a much higher PCE of 18.0% than the control device. The enhancement of PCE performance is mainly contributed by an improved Voc of 1.11 V and a FF of 80.6%; the Jsc also increased slightly to 20.11 mA cm−2. A statistical analysis was performed on over 10 PSCs for each condition, and the corresponding results are summarized in Fig. 1b. It reflects the same trend as suggested by the comparison of best devices.

To investigate the underlying mechanism of the observed improvement in device performance, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was first utilized. As depicted in Fig. 2a, the effective work function increases from 5.06 eV for pristine PEDOT:PSS/ITO to 5.19 eV for water rinsed PEDOT:PSS/ITO. The larger work function can lead to a better energy level alignment between the HTL and the valence band edge of the perovskite, resulting in more efficient hole extraction and improved Voc. In addition, absorbance spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, steady state photo-luminescence (PL) spectra, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were recorded to provide insight into the improved Jsc and FF. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the perovskite film prepared on the PEDOT:PSS film with or without water rinsing exhibited almost identical absorption profiles in the visible light range, which ensures a high utilization of incident sunlight. Moreover, the influence of the PEDOT:PSS surface on the perovskite morphology was evaluated by SEM. There are no obvious changes in the morphology of the perovskite films, both of which exhibit a uniform polycrystalline surface with a grain size of 300–500 nm (Fig. S1†).

(c) PL spectra with the structure of ITO/pristine PEDOT:PSS or water rinsed PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM and (d) EIS spectra of full cells. 
In contrast to the film absorption and morphology, the perovskite film fabricated on water rinsed PEDOT:PSS exhibited more effective PL quenching at the peak position of 761 nm (Fig. 2c). This implies that more efficient hole carrier extraction and transfer took place between the perovskite and water rinsed PEDOT:PSS than the pristine one.40 Moreover, EIS spectra supplied more information on electrical properties at the interfaces, such as inner series resistance, charge transfer, and carrier recombination dynamics in the device. Fig. 2d shows the Nyquist plots of the PSC devices with pristine or water rinsed PEDOT:PSS at frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. The device based on water rinsed PEDOT:PSS exhibited a smaller semi-circle than the control device, reflecting a smaller charge transfer resistance.41–43 Moreover, a smaller starting value of the semi-circle was also observed, indicating a small inner series resistance (Rs) in “water rinsed” devices, which is consistent with the J–V characteristics.
To understand the role of water rinsing process in the PEDOT:PSS film, the film thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS were measured using a step profiler. The pristine PEDOT:PSS film shows a thickness of around 9 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. In great comparison, no prominent “step” could be found on the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS/ITO sample, indicating that the remaining PEDOT:PSS layer is ultra-thin. Topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are recorded for PEDOT:PSS/ITO, water rinsed PEDOT:PSS/ITO and bare ITO (Fig. S2†). The PEDOT:PSS film can completely cover the ITO, showing a distinctive morphology that is in good agreement with previous literature.30,44,45 In contrast, the morphology was greatly changed after water rinsing, with the ITO surface exposed. The similar morphology and roughness between water rinsed PEDOT:PSS/ITO and bare ITO indicate that most of the PEDOT:PSS is rinsed away from the ITO surface. To confirm this, optical transparency of the PEDOT:PSS w/o water rinsing on ITO and the bare ITO film was compared (Fig. 3b). The transmittance profile of the PEDOT:PSS film showed a distinctive change after water rinsing, with its characteristic antireflection peak shifted from 490 nm to 450 nm. Consequently, the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS film on ITO exhibited almost identical transmittance spectrum to the bare ITO, re-confirming that the thickness is extremely small.

(d and e) High-resolution XPS profiles for In 3d, O 1s, and S 2p in ITO, PEDOT:PSS and water rinsed PEDOT:PSS films. 
The resistance and hole transport properties of PEDOT:PSS w/o water rinsing were evaluated by recording the dark curves of the sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS w/o water rinsing/Ag. Fig. 3c shows that the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS can sustain a higher current density than the pristine film under the same bias. In other words, the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS film exhibits lower resistance and better charge transport properties,11 which is consistent with the EIS results.
In order to investigate the interaction between PEDOT:PSS and ITO, the surface chemical environment was evaluated by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on In 3d, O 1s, as well as S 2p orbitals. Fig. 3d shows that both the UV-ozone cleaned ITO and the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS exhibit strong characteristic signals from In 3d orbitals (binding energy of 458–440 eV). In contrast, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film exhibits much weaker In 3d signals. Since the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS film is beyond the detection depth of XPS, the weak signal in pristine PEDOT:PSS is attributed to the small quantity of dissolved indium in the PEDOT:PSS film. Furthermore, the unsymmetrical In 3d doublet peaks of ITO can be fitted with two pairs of doublet peaks. The peaks located at lower binding energy can be assigned to the In–O bond of bulk ITO; while the peaks at higher binding energy correspond to the In–OH bond at the ITO surface.46 It is worth noting that an apparent shift of the peak position was observed in the water rinsed film, compared with the bare ITO film. In addition, the signals can be fitted with three pairs of doublet peaks. Two of them have exactly the same peak positions as the fitted peaks of the ITO sample. So they can be assigned to the In–OH bond and the In–O bond of ITO, respectively. Interestingly, a new pair of indium characteristic peaks appeared at the binding energies of 445.3 eV and 452.9 eV. To understand the provenance of the uncharted In 3d peaks, the O 1s and S 2p signals were further analyzed (Fig. 3e and f). For the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, the asymmetric O 1s XPS peak resulted from the overlapping of two separate peaks at 533.3 eV and 531.9 eV, which can be assigned to the oxygen atoms in PEDOT and PSS, respectively.27 Similarly, S 2p XPS peaks of the pristine PEDOT:PSS also exhibit two pairs of sub-peaks, with the S from PEDOT at high binding energy and S in PSS at low binding energy. Notably, after water rinsing no change was observed in the O 1s characteristic peaks, but an evident shift to lower energy was found for the S 2p peak assigned to PSS, while the S 2p peak of PEDOT remained unchanged. Moreover, binding energy shifting was also observed in the In–O bond, which shifted from 530.3 eV for ITO to 530.8 eV for water rinsed PEDOT:PSS, while the peak position of Sn–O at 531.3 eV was unchanged. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the peaks located at 445.3 eV and 452.9 eV were due to the chemical bond of In–O–S, which formed by the interaction of PSS and ITO. The formation of such a chemical bond is able to link PEDOT:PSS strongly to ITO glass. For example, the PEDOT:PSS signals can still be detectable even after ten times of repeated water rinsing.
Distribution of PEDOT and PSS in the vertical direction of the PEDOT:PSS monolayers was investigated by static contact angle measurements using deionized water. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS film showed an obviously greater contact angle of 21.5° than the pristine PEDOT:PSS film (6.3°) and UV-ozone treated ITO (5.8°). The strong hydrophobicity of the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS film suggests that more hydrophobic PEDOT chains are distributed at the surface.44 The PSS chains incline to the bond with ITO through the In–O–S bond. So a bilayered nanostructure with PEDOT at the surface and PSS at the bottom close to ITO is formed. A hydrophobic surface and less hydroscopic PSS component could be beneficial to the device stability in a humid environment. The device stability was evaluated through measuring the devices stored in an ambient environment without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 4d, for the PSCs fabricated on water rinsed PEDOT:PSS, more than 50% of the initial PCE value was maintained after 240 hours of exposure to air. However, the PCE of the devices fabricated on pristine PEDOT:PSS films degraded to zero under the same condition. These results indicate that more stable devices could be obtained with PEDOT:PSS monolayers.

(d) Evolution in normalized PCE values of control devices based on PDEOT:PSS w/o water rinsing without encapsulation and stored in ambient condition with 55% ± 5% humidity. The inset shows the digital pictures of the cells after exposure to air for 200 hours. 
Based on the device performance and characterization, a possible model of the water rinsed PEDOT:PSS hole transfer layer is illustrated in Scheme 2 in conjunction with the fabrication process. Firstly the ITO substrate is treated with UV-ozone to create hydroxyl groups on its surface. Then PEDOT:PSS was spin coated followed by annealing at 120 °C for 20 min. This process induced the In–O–S chemical bond formation between ITO and PSS chain at the interface, as suggested by XPS analysis. Subsequently, ultrapure water was spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS film to rinse away the non-bonded PEDOT:PSS. As a result, the retained PEDOT:PSS shows an ordered distribution with PSS chains bonded with ITO via In–O–S bonds and PEDOT binds with PSS via Coulomb interaction. The self-organized PEDOT/PSS bilayers can form an oriented internal electric field with direction from a positively charged PEDOT layer to negatively charged PSS, as suggested by the UPS results. Such a unique nanostructure is able to facilitate efficient hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the ITO electrode, as well as to enhance the air stability of the devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported a facile method to construct PEDOT:PSS monolayers with an oriented internal electric field on top of ITO. By water rinsing the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films, the perovskite solar cells showed an improvement in PCE from 13.4% to 18.0% and an enhanced air stability. The better device performance is ascribed to the internal electric field rooted from the PEDOT/PSS bilayered nanostructure that can facilitate better hole extraction. The more hydrophobic surface and less hydroscopic components in the film can also lead to better device stability in a humid environment. This work suggests that there is still room for the efficiency improvement of perovskite solar cells by optimizing the traditional functional layers. In light of the simple treatment but dramatic improvement in device performance, it is believed that this method can also be applied to other opto-electronic devices such as organic solar cells,47–51 light-emitting diodes52,53 or lasers,54–56etc.
