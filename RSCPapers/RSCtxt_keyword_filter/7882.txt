    , Accepted 1st July 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractThe power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress. However, little attention has been paid to improving the thermal stability of nonfullerene OSCs, which is critical for future practical application. Herein, two novel isomeric nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (n-SMAs) based on the classical ITIC acceptors, namely oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, with fluorine atoms substituting at the ortho-alkyl and meta-alkyl positions of the phenyl side chains, respectively, are designed. The effect of fluorinated side-chains on the efficiency and thermal stability is systematically investigated. When combined with PBTIBDTT, both oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC devices show enhanced PCEs as compared to the ITIC device. More importantly, these active layers show distinct degrees of morphological deterioration under thermal annealing. Among the acceptors, mF-ITIC shows the best thermal stability, retaining 92% of its initial device efficiency after thermal annealing for 96 h at 150 °C, while ITIC and oF-ITIC devices only preserve 82% and 67% of their initial efficiencies, respectively. Investigation indicates that the miscibility of donor/acceptor and crystallinity of the acceptors synergistically affect the thermal stability of the active layers, which provides a new molecule design strategy to achieve high efficiency nonfullerene OSCs with outstanding thermal stability.
Introduction
Given the increasingly serious problems of fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution, organic solar cells (OSCs), which convert sunlight into electricity, featuring light weight, low cost, flexibility and roll-to-roll production capability, have obtained widespread attention.1 Over the past several years, most of the efforts were devoted to designing and preparing high efficiency devices in organic photovoltaic research, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have surpassed 16%, mainly benefiting from the rapid progress of nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (n-SMAs).2 However, long-term stability as one key issue has to be considered for future practical application due to the fact that it is directly related to the lifetime of OSCs. It is recognized that the stability of OSCs closely relates to three aspects: (i) the diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers, (ii) degradation of the organic materials and (iii) the morphological stability of the active layers.3 Not only in fullerene OSCs but also in nonfullerene OSCs, the morphological stability is particularly striking.4 This is mainly due to the fact that the nano-scale phase separation and interpenetrating network are essential for optimal morphology to achieve high efficiency of the BHJ active layer, which is metastable and readily moves toward a thermodynamic equilibrium state to form large phase separation.5 Generally, the morphology deterioration cannot be completely eliminated due to the accumulated heat from the long-term sunlight irradiation in practical application, which will dramatically decrease the interfacial area, increase the exciton recombination, and thus cause a negative effect on the device efficiency.6 In the past, many strategies have been developed to enhance the thermal stability of fullerene OSCs, such as adopting amorphous fullerene electron acceptors, introducing compatibilizers or crosslinkers, or using other techniques.7 Compared with the fullerene acceptors, n-SMAs exhibit impressive advantages such as strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, adjustable energy levels and easy accessibility. However, there is one considerable difference between the fullerene acceptors and the n-SMAs in the molecular geometry. This would lead to a discrepant interaction between the donor and acceptor, which would have a profound effect on the aggregation behavior of the n-SMAs and thermal stability of the active layer.8
Among these n-SMAs, molecules bearing an electron-rich (D) core flanked with two electron-deficient (A) segments (A–D–A type n-SMAs) have been proved to be the most promising candidates for achieving excellent photovoltaic performance in OSCs.9 By manipulating or varying the central donor cores, electron-withdrawing terminals and side chains, the optoelectronic properties of n-SMAs could be fully modulated to match different types of polymers with complementary absorption, suitable energy levels and so on, expectedly achieving satisfactory PCEs.10 Beyond the excellent efficiencies, several OSCs based on A–D–A type n-SMAs also exhibited decent thermal stabilities. For example, when combining polymer donor PBDB-T with the typical n-SMA ITIC, the device showed excellent thermal stability, with little PCE decline after heating at 100 °C for 250 h.11 Devices based on PTZ1:IDIC also demonstrated desirable thermal stability, in which the PCE of the unencapsulated device could still retain 81% of its initial value after thermal annealing for 10 h at 100 °C in air.12 Moreover, OSCs with active layers incorporating conjugated polymer PTB7-Th as a donor and IDT-BT-R or IRT-BT-R-CN as acceptors, respectively, both showed excellent thermal stability.13 However, most of the OSCs based on n-SMAs still showed poor thermal stability, and the influence of the molecular structure on the thermal stability of nonfullerene OSCs has rarely been reported.14
For n-SMAs, the side chain characteristics not only affect the solubility and geometry of the n-SMAs but they also affect the absorption, energy levels and charge transport properties. Most importantly, the side chain provides an opportunity to tune the corresponding solid-state packing and thin film morphologies.15 Generally, the thin film morphology is closely bound up with the thermal stability of the active layer.3b,16 People have done a lot of work in side chain engineering for A–D–A type n-SMAs like optimizing the n-alkyl substituents of ITIC derivatives, introducing alkoxy-phenyl side-chains and so on, which significantly enhanced the device performance.15d,17 But all of these efforts were aimed at achieving high PCEs, and the potential influence of side chains of n-SMAs on the thermal stability of the corresponding devices remains unexplored.
In this work, two novel A–D–A type n-SMAs based on typical ITIC acceptors, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, with fluorine atoms located at the ortho-alkyl and meta-alkyl positions of the phenyl side chains, were designed to investigate the effect of side-chain engineering on the thermal stability of active layers. When paired with our previously reported polymer donor PBTIBDTT, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC devices showed improved efficiencies as compared with their counterpart ITIC device.18 More importantly, the mF-ITIC device could keep 92% of its initial efficiency after an accelerated annealing at 150 °C for 96 h, while ITIC and oF-ITIC devices could only retain 82% and 67% of their original efficiencies, respectively. The morphology and microstructure evolutions of the blend films were systematically investigated, which indicated that the blend miscibility and acceptor crystallinity synergistically affect the morphology stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the influence of the side chains of A–D–A type acceptors on the thermal stability of nonfullerene OSCs has been disclosed, which would provide a guideline for acceptor design to achieve high thermal stability devices.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The chemical structures and synthetic procedures of oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC are depicted in Fig. 1. 4-Bromo-2-fluoro-1-hexylbenzene,1-bromo-2-fluoro-4-hexylbenzene and diethyl 2,5-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)terephthalate (compound 1) were synthesized according to previous works.19 Compounds 2a and 2b were acquired via the same synthetic route by lithiation of 4-bromo-2-fluoro-1-hexylbenzene and 1-bromo-2-fluoro-4-hexylbenzene, respectively, at −78 °C, and then adding compound 1 to give the crude intermediate products, followed by dehydration with concentrated sulfuric acid. Noticeably, a stoichiometric ratio of 1:0.5 (compound 4-bromo-2-fluoro-1-hexylbenzene/1-bromo-2-fluoro-4-hexylbenzene to the corresponding n-Buli) was applied and the lithium time and temperature were carefully controlled to prevent the coupling of intermediates. The detailed synthetic procedures are given in the Experimental section in the ESI.† Subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reactions and Knoevenagel condensations were used to produce the final products oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC. Compounds oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC were fully characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (1H, 13C) (Experimental section, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties

PBTIBDTT depicted in Fig. 2a was selected as the donor due to its appropriate energy level and complementary absorption when combined with ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC. Furthermore, our previous work showed that PBTIBDTT featured not only excellent photoelectric properties but also a high decomposition temperature, which fulfils the need to study the thermal stability of OSCs under high temperature. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure PBTIBDTT and pure acceptors both in solution and film state are presented in Fig. 2b and c, respectively, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. In going from solution to film, the acceptors exhibited a remarkable bathochromic shift and an enlarged absorption range, indicating more ordered molecular packing in the films. As presented in Table 1, the absorption onsets of the films are at 780 nm, 763 nm and 776 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps of 1.59 eV, 1.63 eV and 1.60 eV for ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, respectively. It could be found that the oF-ITIC film has a slightly blue-shifted absorption of about 13 nm and a larger band gap compared with mF-ITIC, which has a negative effect on the short current density (Jsc), indicating the weakened intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) effect in oF-ITIC with fluorine atoms located at the ortho-alkyl position on the phenyl. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of these acceptors, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.64 eV/−3.86 eV, −5.73 eV/−3.93 eV and −5.66 eV/−3.88 eV for ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out for the three acceptors, as depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels were −5.47 eV/−3.34 eV, −5.60 eV/−3.44 eV, and −5.49 eV/−3.36 eV, for ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, respectively, being consistent with the variation trend of the CV results. It could be observed that oF-ITIC showed obviously decreased energy levels as compared with mF-ITIC, indicating that fluorination at different positions of the side chains can obviously affect the energy levels of n-SMAs.

Photovoltaic properties
Devices with the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTIBDTT:acceptors/PDINO/Al were prepared to probe the influence of side-chain fluorinations on the photovoltaic performance. All the active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene (CB) solutions with a film thickness of 100–110 nm. The detailed optimization processes are presented in the ESI† (Tables S1–S3). The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding parameters are collected in Table 2. It could be observed that the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC devices afforded the highest PCE of 9.50% among the three acceptors with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.53 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.11%. While for ITIC and oF-ITIC devices, the optimal PCEs were 8.89% (Voc = 0.96 V, Jsc = 14.39 mA cm−2 and FF = 64.39%) and 9.01% (Voc = 0.94 V, Jsc = 13.49 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.03%), respectively. Due to the relatively lower LUMO energy level of oF-ITIC, PSCs based on oF-ITIC showed a slightly lower Voc of 0.94 V. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of oF-ITIC, ITIC and mF-ITIC based devices are shown in Fig. 3b. It could be found that the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC device showed higher EQE values and a wider response range of 450–800 nm as compared to PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC, which contributed to its relatively higher Jsc value. In addition, the deviations between the integrated current densities derived from EQE spectra and the Jsc values were within 5%, demonstrating the accuracy of the measurements.

To understand the influence of side chains on the exciton generation and dissociation processes of the devices, photocurrent density Jphversus effective voltage Veff of the optimal devices with different side chains was characterized. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage.20 As presented in Fig. 3d and Table S5 (ESI†), under the maximum power output and short-circuit conditions, the saturation photocurrent Jsat (Veff = 2 V) and exciton dissociation probabilities Pdiss(Jsc/Jph) were calculated to be 14.70 mA cm−2/95.2%, 14.60 mA cm−2/95.7% and 15.58 mA cm−2/96.6% for the OSCs with ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC as acceptors, respectively. The slightly higher Pdiss value of the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC device as compared to PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC and PBTIBDTT:ITIC devices suggests its more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes. The dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Plight) for the devices with different acceptors was described by fitting the power-law equation Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, as plotted in Fig. 3c, to explore the charge recombination process. In principle, the α value approaches 1 when the photocurrent loss and bimolecular recombination are negligible, while α < 1 suggests the existence of charge recombination.21 As presented in Table S5 (ESI†), the fitted α values were 91.7%, 92.5% and 93.0% for the devices with ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC as acceptors, respectively, which suggested that the bimolecular recombination is weaker in the devices using side-chain fluorinated acceptors. Therefore, due to the enhanced exciton generation ability, increased charge dissociation possibility and suppressed charge recombination, the FF and Jsc are obviously improved for mF-ITIC based devices, accounting for the best performance of the mF-ITIC devices.
Thermal stability of the OSCs
In order to exclusively disclose the influence of side chains of n-SMAs on the thermal stability of the active layers, thermal stability tests were conducted under the same conditions for the three acceptors. Herein, thermal annealing of the active layers was performed prior to the deposition of the interface layer and the cathode, so that other factors affecting the morphology and device performance could be eliminated. A high annealing temperature of 150 °C, which is much higher than the standard temperature (85 °C), was applied in the accelerated aging test to evaluate the thermal stability.22 The thermal degradation test was performed inside a glove-box to prevent interactions of the polymer donor and/or n-SMAs with oxygen and/or moisture. The normalized PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF as a function of annealing time for these OSCs are plotted in Fig. 4 and the specific parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It could be found that the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC device demonstrated the most stable performance, and the PCE only decreased from 9.39% to 8.67% (PCE loss ratio: 8%) after annealing for 96 h. For this device, all the photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 4a–c) almost remained constant during the experiment time, and negligible thermally-induced morphological changes were expected to occur. In contrast, the PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC device showed the poorest thermal stability. The PCE sharply dropped from 8.87% to 7.15% (PCE loss ratio: 19%) within the initial 24 h, and then reduced to 5.94%, leading to a PCE loss of 33% after thermal annealing for 96 hours, which was attributed to the fast decay in Jsc and FF. While the PBTIBDTT:ITIC device showed an intermediate behaviour between the two acceptor cases. The efficiency lost 18% of its initial PCE after annealing for 96 hours, which was mainly ascribed to the decreased Jsc and FF. It should be noted that all the active layers were prepared under the optimal conditions aforementioned. The PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC device achieved its optimal efficiency with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2 and 0.5% in volume DIO (which was removed by methanol in the spin-coating process) as an additive, which was slightly different from the preparation conditions of the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC and PBTIBDTT:ITIC blend films. To eliminate the effect of the difference in active layer preparation processes, the thermal stability of the oF-ITIC device with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 and without adding an additive was also estimated. After annealing for 96 h, it still showed the worst thermal stability among these acceptors with a PCE loss ratio of 24% (Table S6, ESI†). Therefore, the thermal stability of the OSCs based on the three acceptors ranked in the order of mF-ITIC > ITIC > oF-ITIC. Given that the molecular structures of these n-SMAs were identical except for the side chains, it was reasonable to conjecture that the thermal stability of the reported polymer/n-SMA blend films has a direct correlation with the type of side chain.

Charge carrier mobility
The changes in hole and electron transport properties with thermal annealing of the devices were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with device configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTIBDTT:acceptors/Au and ITO/ZnO/PBTIBDTT:acceptors/PDINO/Al, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. For the pristine blend films, they all exhibited comparable electron mobility (μe) with the values of 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blends based on ITIC, oF-ITIC, and mF-ITIC, respectively. It could be seen that when the annealing time was prolonged, the electron mobilities of these blend films declined, indicating that the good percolating electron transport pathway gradually deteriorated. After annealing for 96 h, the electron mobility of the PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC blend sharply declined by an order of magnitude, while the PBTIBDTT:ITIC blend exhibited a ca. 2 fold decrement. But the electron mobility of the PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC blend almost remained unchanged after annealing for 96 h. The variation trend of the electron mobilities after annealing was consistent with the efficiency variations. The hole mobilities of these blend films were also examined. Interestingly, the initial blends showed slightly different hole mobilities, with the values of 4.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBTIBDTT:ITIC, PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC and PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC blends, respectively. The difference in hole mobilities may be attributed to the different crystallinity of PBTIBDTT induced by the different side chains of the n-SMAs. While the more unbalanced hole and electron mobilities (μe/μh = 8.6) for the initial PBTIBDTT:ITIC device as compared to the other two devices (2.9 and 2.4 for oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC based devices, respectively) explained its lowest FF. After long-term annealing, the μh values of these blend films showed little change. These results indicated that the rapid degradations of the FF and Jsc values in PBTIBDTT:ITIC and PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC devices arose from the declined electron mobilities. The more stable and balanced hole and electron mobilities for the initial and annealed PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC devices indicated a low degree of geminate and nongeminate recombination in the devices, explaining their high capability in resisting thermal annealing.23

Morphology study
To give reasons for the different thermal stabilities of the active layers induced by the n-SMA structures, we first took the images of pure as-cast ITIC, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC films via optical microscopy to get a preliminary judgment of the aggregation abilities of the acceptors, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Both ITIC and oF-ITIC pure films showed numerous aggregations, as shown in the dark blue areas of Fig. S8a and b (ESI†), respectively, which originated from their strong crystal ability to promote aggregation during film deposition (Fig. S9, ESI†). In contrast, uniform films without any aggregation regions could be observed for the mF-ITIC as-cast film, accounting for the weak crystal and aggregation abilities of mF-ITIC molecules as compared to ITIC and oF-ITIC molecules. Furthermore, the morphology evolutions of the blends after thermal annealing were examined via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 6. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 48 h and 96 h, large aggregations with feature sizes of ca. 100–200 nm dispersed in the PBTIBDTT:ITIC and PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC matrices were observed. In order to define the attribution of the particles, the pure PBTIBDTT film was thermally annealed at 150 °C for 96 h and no observable aggregation was observed on the micrometer scale (Fig. S8d, ESI†). This evidenced that the large particles in the blend films were the aggregations of ITIC or oF-ITIC. All the initial blend films exhibited uniform nano-scale phase separations and well-defined interpenetrating networks. The morphologies of these blend films underwent gradient deteriorations and n-SMA aggregations with different diameters gradually formed with the annealing time. Among all the blend films, PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC blends showed the worst morphological stability. A large number of large oF-ITIC aggregations formed when exposed to thermal stress for 48 h at 150 °C. As the annealing time was prolonged up to 96 h, the size of oF-ITIC aggregations continued to increase, forming large phase separations with a domain size of about 200 nm (Fig. 6f). The large phase separations could lead to the diminution of the interfacial area between polymer donor and n-SMA components, as well as the attenuation of efficient bicontinuous pathways for charge transportation. Thus, the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge carrier mobility decreased, resulting in a sharp decrease of Jsc, FF and PCE. The ITIC aggregations in the PBTIBDTT:ITIC blends with a much larger size than those of oF-ITIC aggregations in blend films became visible at 48 h (Fig. 6b). During the following thermal annealing, the density of ITIC aggregations increased slowly, while the size remained almost unchanged. The morphology of mF-ITIC blend films seemed to be most insensitive to thermal stress. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 48 h, no observable aggregations formed and only clear crystal whiskers could be observed (Fig. 6h). As the thermal annealing time extended to 96 h, only a tiny amount of small aggregations could be found. Moreover, the morphology evolution of oF-ITIC active layers with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 and without adding an additive was also studied (Fig. S12, ESI†), which also exhibited severe morphology thermal instability with the size and number of oF-ITIC aggregations gradually increasing as the annealing time went on. Therefore, the morphology deterioration of PBTIBDTT:mF-ITIC effectively slowed down during the thermal annealing and the optimal morphology and good interpenetrating network of mF-ITIC blends could be retained after long-term thermal annealing, resulting in much more stable device performance.

Crystallinity and ordering
Introducing fluorine atoms and manipulating their positions on the side chains of n-SMAs may have dramatic effects on their crystallinity and structure order, which further affect the thermal stability of active layers.24 Therefore, the influence of fluoro-side-chains on molecular organization behaviors of the acceptors was explored by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). For ITIC, the GIWAXS pattern clearly showed numerous diffraction rings both in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and in plane (IP) direction, indicating the strong crystallinity of ITIC. While for oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC with fluorinated side-chains, as shown in the line profile (Fig. S10a and b, ESI†), both the number and intensity of the diffraction peaks decreased as compared to ITIC, and no observable π–π stacking peak could be seen, illustrating that the crystallinity of oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC was weakened due to side-chain fluorinations. According to the line-cuts in the OOP direction, the lamellar distance (dL) was calculated to be 1.37 nm for ITIC, 1.06 nm for oF-ITIC and 1.61 nm for mF-ITIC, indicating that the interdigitations of side chains for oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC molecules were strengthened and weakened, respectively. Therefore, fluorination at the different positions of the n-SMA side-chains would obviously affect the crystallinity and molecule self-organization behaviors.
The microstructure evolutions of the blend films were further measured via 2D-GIWAXS to give an insight into the effect of side-chain engineering of acceptors on the thermal stability of OSCs, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S10 (ESI†). To define the attributions of the peaks, a pure PBTIBDTT film was also characterized, as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). All the blend films exhibited obvious (010) π–π stacking peaks at qz = 18.9 nm−1 in the OOP direction, and (100) lamellar peaks at q ∼ 3.2 nm−1 both in the OOP directions and in the IP directions, revealing the mixed face-on and edge-on orientations for PBTIBDTT in the blend films. For the acceptors in the pristine blend films (Fig. 7a, d, and g), oF-ITIC exhibited the strongest crystallinity with an obvious (010) π–π stacking peak at qz = 17.0 nm−1 in the OOP direction as compared to ITIC and mF-ITIC even though ITIC molecules seemed to crystalize more easily than oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC in the pure films, as discussed above (Fig. S9, ESI†). Moreover, PBTIBDTT in ITIC pristine blend films also exhibited the weakest crystallinity among the unannealed blends as demonstrated by its weakest (010) diffraction rings (Fig. 7a). This might be due to the good compatibility between the PBTIBDTT donor and the ITIC acceptor, which inhabited the diffusion of the ITIC acceptor and formation of large aggregations. With the annealing time, the π–π stacking peak at qz = 16.6 nm−1 belonging to ITIC gradually emerged and strengthened, indicating that ITIC molecules gradually escaped from the constraint of the polymer and self-organized into large aggregations, which was in line with the gradually degraded morphology seen in the TEM images. For oF-ITIC blends, oF-ITIC molecules seemed to more easily form large aggregations than ITIC, due to the fastest increased intensity of the π–π stacking peak of oF-ITIC under thermal stress. In contrast, mF-ITIC in the blend films always produced no apparent (010) π–π stacking peaks even after thermal annealing for 96 h due to its weakest crystal ability, explaining its best thermal stability. Moreover, the 2D-GIWAXS evolution of the PBTIBDTT:oF-ITIC blend film with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 and without adding additive was also studied to make a parallel comparison with ITIC and mF-ITIC under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), which also showed obvious (010) π–π stacking peaks in the unannealed blend film and the (010) π–π stacking peaks increased and strengthened greatly under thermal stress, consistent with the PCE degradation and morphology evolution shown in the TEM image (Fig. S12, ESI†).

Mechanism
It is still not so clear how the fluoro-side-chains affect the thermal stability of the donor polymer/n-SMA blend and thus device efficiency. It is speculated that the synergistic effects of the crystal ability of the component (donor and/or acceptor) and the miscibility between donor and acceptors determined the thermal stability of the active layers.22,25 Introducing fluorine atoms to the phenyl side-chains reduced the crystallinity of oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC as compared with ITIC (the crystallinity ranked in the following order: mF-ITIC < oF-ITIC < ITIC). Generally speaking, the reduction of crystallinity is beneficial for improving the thermal stability due to the weak driving force to form large aggregations.22 However, the thermal stability of the blend films ranked in the order: PBTIBDTT/mF-ITIC > PBTIBDTT/ITIC > PBTIBDTT/oF-ITIC. Due to the use of the same donor polymer PBTIBDTT, the difference in the crystallinity of the acceptors in the pure films and in these blends might be induced by the different miscibility of donor and acceptor. After attaching fluorine atoms to the phenyl side-chains of ITIC, the polarity of oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC increased, which might decrease the miscibility of donor and acceptors. The decreased miscibility would contribute to the phase separation. Therefore, although oF-ITIC showed moderate crystallinity in the pure film, PBTIBDTT/oF-ITIC showed the worst thermal stability, while for the PBTIBDTT/mF-ITIC blend, its thermal stability is mainly contributed by the weakest crystal ability of mF-ITIC molecules.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we produced two novel n-SMAs based on the classic ITIC, namely oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC, with fluorine atoms substituting at the ortho-alkyl and meta-alkyl positions of the phenyl side chains, respectively, to disclose the effect of the side-chain on the thermal stability of active layers. After introducing fluorine atoms into the phenyl side-chains, oF-ITIC and mF-ITIC displayed weaker crystallinity as compared to ITIC (ranked in the following order: mF-ITIC < oF-ITIC < ITIC), which was beneficial for improving the device thermal stability. However, when these acceptors were combined with the PBTIBDTT donor, the thermal stability of these blends ranked in the following order: PBTIBDTT/mF-ITIC > PBTIBDTT/ITIC > PBTIBDTT/oF-ITIC. The PBTIBDTT/mF-ITIC device showed the best thermal stability, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after thermal annealing for 96 h at 150 °C. While ITIC and oF-ITIC devices could only retain 82% and 67% of their original efficiency, respectively. The morphology and microstructure evolution processes were systematically investigated, which indicated that the thermal stability of the active layers was synergistically affected by the crystallinity and the miscibility of the two components. Our work discloses the effect of side-chain engineering on the thermal stability of non-fullerene OSCs for the first time, which provides a way to design n-SMAs to realize the excellent thermal stability of non-fullerene OSCs.
