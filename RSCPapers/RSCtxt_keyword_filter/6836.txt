    , Accepted 8th September 2016First published on 9th September 2016AbstractThe sulfur ion concentration dependent morphological evolution and its subsequent effect on photo-electrochemical properties of chemically synthesized CdS thin films have been systematically investigated. The plausible growth mechanism for the morphological evolution of CdS thin films due to a change in sulfur ion concentration has been proposed. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) reveal that the morphology of CdS thin films has been changed from spherical grains to vertically aligned nanoflakes by systematic control of sulfur ion concentration. This article elucidates the astute relationships between precursor concentrations, reaction rate and morphological evolution. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the formation of hexagonal wurtzite CdS thin films with the preferred (002) orientation for CdS nanoflakes, which is further supported by the analysis of the high resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEMs). Optical absorption studies show a red shift in the absorption edge with an increase in sulfur concentration. The beneficial role of nanoflake formation is easily reflected in the photo-electrochemical performance. Improved solar cell performances are observed for CdS nanoflakes grown with a sulfur to cadmium ion concentration ratio of 4 (S:Cd = 4).
1. Introduction
For the last few decades, CdS has been the focal point of materials scientists due to its attractive properties such as direct band gap transition, high photoconductivity, high electron affinity and electronic band gap tunability. All these properties of CdS are characteristic of the size and shape of CdS nanocrystals.1 The size and shape of the nanocrystals are key factors determining their optical and electrical properties and overall functionality; so the control of the size and shape of the nanocrystals is crucial for their implementation in proposed applications.2,3 Concerning their application in photo-electrochemical solar cells, the morphologies of nanocrystals that can facilitate easy charge transport and have the capability to harvest maximum incident light through multiple scatterings and trapping phenomena are mostly preferred. Such nanostructures include nanoconduits, networks of nanoflakes or nanosheets, nanorods and many other hierarchical nanostructures.4,5 The size and shape of a growing crystal can be tailored with an understanding of its crystal symmetry and growth habits. CdS has two types of crystal structures: cubic zinc blend and hexagonal wurtzite. The stacking sequence of the close packed planes of the zinc blend (the (111) planes) is represented by the ABCABCABC repeating pattern, while that of wurtzite is represented by the ABABAB repeating pattern.6,7 Among them the most thermodynamically stable crystal structure of CdS is wurtzite, which can be described as a number of alternating planes composed of tetrahedral coordinated S2− and Cd2+ ions stacked along the c-axis.6,7 The hexagonal wurtzite CdS can undergo anisotropic growth due to its different crystallographic planes possessing different energies and polar surfaces, thus various kinds of light trapping nanostructures of wurtzite CdS can be synthesized via chemical as well as physical techniques by controlling the growth parameter.1,6
The various physical and chemical techniques implemented for the synthesis of CdS nanostructures are electrochemical synthesis, solvothermal synthesis, thermal evaporation, vapor–liquid–solid growth, chemical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, and pulsed laser deposition, etc.6 All of these methods are useful but have some limitations; some of them require elevated temperatures, or use toxic agents, or need significant energy input, or have poor reproducibility. Compared with the above-mentioned methods, the reflux method is an easier, low-cost, highly efficient and simple technique as schematically illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1. This is very much similar to the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method but has an advantage over CBD in that it does not allow the growth solution to waste through evaporation. Also it is a highly reproducible technique as it offers uniform heating and maintains constant growth conditions throughout the deposition. Especially when a volatile complexant such as ammonia is used, the pH of the solution changes due to evaporation in CBD, which affects the reproducibility of the technique; however, such problems are avoided in the reflux method. Also this method offers facile tuning of the growth parameters, with a view to synthesize a variety of nanostructures. Various nanostructures such as nanosheets, nanorods, and nanosyringes were synthesized via the appropriate control of the growth parameters in the reflux method.8,9
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of all the CdS thin films deposited with different sulfur concentrations. The inset on the right shows a schematic diagram of the reflux technique. 
In this work, desired nanostructures such as interconnected nanoflakes offering maximum active surface area (electrode–electrolyte interface) and effective light trapping through diffuse scattering were synthesized by altering the growth conditions of the reflux method. We controlled the growth rate by changing the sulfur ion concentration to control the size and shape of the growing CdS nanostructures. In particular, the growth rate of CdS was controlled in such a way that the shape of the CdS product changes from spherical granules to vertically oriented flakes wherein the height and density of the flakes continued to increase as a consequence of the enhancement in growth rate due to the increase in concentration of sulfur ions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on such a fine tuning of CdS nanostructure morphology without the use of templates, surfactants and with an all substrate compatible low cost technique. Recently P. Yin et al. reported on the growth of CdS nanoflake arrays, but they used a 3-step chemical vapor deposition technique, whereas here we demonstrate a single step, facile, highly cost-effective technique which affords a better solar cell performance compared to theirs.10 Herein we discuss the effect of morphological modulation on optical, structural, photo-electrochemical and charge transport properties of the CdS thin films.
2. Experimental details
The films were deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The substrates were first washed using a detergent then ultrasonically cleaned for 20 minutes in acetone followed by ultrasonic cleaning in isopropyl alcohol for another 20 minutes and then used for deposition.
The growth solution was prepared in the following way. First the aqueous solution of cadmium sulfate CdSO4 (0.025 M) was prepared and then aqueous ammonia was added dropwise under constant stirring. Initially a white precipitate was observed, which subsequently dissolved back in solution upon further addition of aqueous ammonia. The pH of the solution at this stage was ∼12. Then an aqueous thiourea solution was added into the above solution under constant stirring. The concentration of thiourea was varied in the following steps: 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 1.0 and 1.25 M concentrations, in order to adjust the sulfur to cadmium precursor molar ratio (S:Cd = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The CdS thin films prepared at different sulfur ion concentrations are denoted as SCd-1 (1:1), SCd-2 (2:1), SCd-3 (3:1), SCd-4 (4:1) and SCd-5 (5:1). Pre-cleaned FTO substrates were immersed vertically in a conical flask containing the growth solution, then the flask was heated at 95 ± 5 °C for 45 minutes in a reflux unit. After deposition the films were rinsed with distilled water, air-dried and used for further characterizations.
Crystal structure identification was carried out using the X-ray diffraction pattern collected using a Rigaku DMAX 2200 diffractometer under CuKα1 radiation. The surface morphology and size of the CdS nanostructures were characterized using a SEM (JEOL JSM6360, Japan). The detailed study of the nanostructures and crystal phases was carried out using TEM and HRTEM images collected using a Jeol JEM 2100F. The optical absorption spectra were measured using a UV-VIS (Shimadzu model 1800) spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (VG Multilab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, UK). Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon Horiba LABRAM-HR visible spectrometer equipped with an argon ion continuous-wave laser (488 nm) as the excitation source. The I–V characteristics of the CdS thin films were recorded using a semiconductor characterization system (SCS-4200 Keithley, Germany) with a two-electrode configuration, under the illumination of a halogen lamp (27 mW cm−2). PEC measurements were performed using a cell configuration of Glass/FTO/CdS/Na2S-NaOH-S/Graphite. The average area of film used for the PEC measurements was 1 cm2. The electrochemical impedance study was assessed using an electrochemical workstation (ZIVE SP5). The frequency range used was from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with an AC amplitude of 100 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Reaction mechanism
The reflux method is based on controlled precipitation under a constant heat supply through convection; the formation of a solid phase takes place upon transfer of a supersaturated solution to the saturated state, where the nucleation and subsequent particle growth leads to the formation of thin films. The formation of CdS thin films is illustrated in the following stepwise chemical reactions.
The cadmium sulphate salt is dissolved in distilled water, which results in the formation of hydrated cadmium ion complexes, since at low pH (6 to 7) metal ions exist in aqueous solution as aqua co-ordination complexes.11 nCd(SO4) + npH2O → n[Cd(H2O)p]2+ + nSO4−−(R1)
After the addition of aqueous ammonia to the above solution, initially (at pH ∼ 9) the hydrated cadmium ion complexes are transformed into intermediate solid products of cadmium hydroxide [Cdn(OH)2n] via the stepwise replacement of water molecules by hydroxide groups, this process is referred as ‘olation’ as given in reaction (2).2,12 n[Cd(H2O)p]2+ + m(NH4OH) ↔ [Cdn(OH)m(H2O)(np − m)](2n − m)+ + m(NH4+) ↔ Cdn(OH)2n(s) + (np − m)H+ + m(NH4+)(R2)
Upon further addition of aqueous ammonia solution the white Cd(OH)2 precipitate is dissolved (at pH ∼ 12) and a clear solution of Cd(NH3)q2+ complex is formed, here q can have values ranging from 1 to 4 but the most stable co-ordination number is 4.11 Cdn(OH)2n + q(NH4OH) ↔ Cdn(NH3)q2n+ + q(H2O) + 2n(OH)−(R3)
Then aqueous thiourea solution is added to the clear solution of the Cd(NH3)42+ complex, to form a growth solution. Among all the sources of sulfur ions, thiourea is preferred for the benefits of its low solubility and capping activity, which help in growing nanosized particles.13–15 The FTO coated glass substrate was immersed in the growth solution and refluxed at 95 ± 5 °C. The formed cadmium tetra-amine complex underwent a heterogeneous reaction as per the global reaction of formation of CdS (reaction (4))16–20 [Cd(NH3)4]2+ + CS(NH2)2 + 2OH− → CdS + 4NH4OH + CN2H2 + 2H2O(R4)
In detail we can say that first the Cd(NH3)42+ ions react with the hydroxide ions to form the dihydroxo–diamino–cadmium complex which on reaction with thiourea forms the adsorbed metastable complex [Cd(OH)2(NH3)2SC(NH2)2]. This complex then undergoes decomposition leading to the formation of CdS and a new surface.
3.2 X-ray diffraction study

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the CdS thin films deposited at different sulfur ion concentrations. It is well known that CdS exhibits cubic and hexagonal phases. The peaks for both the polymorph structures are observed at almost the same angles. All the films show diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 26.5°, 43.6° and 52.2° corresponding to the (002), (110) and (112) planes, respectively, for the hexagonal structure of CdS (JCPDS:41-1049), while the same values correspond to the (111), (220) and (311) planes, respectively, for its cubic structure (JCPDS:75-1546). However, shown in Fig. 1 the SCd-1 and SCd-2 films show the presence of other phases corresponding to CdO and Cd(OH)2, which later on disappear as the S:Cd ratio is further increased. In addition to this, the SCd-1 and SCd-2 films show the presence of a peak at ∼30.7°, which explicitly corresponds to the (200) peak for the cubic phase of CdS. Hence the SCd-1 and SCd-2 films are grown in the cubic structure. Furthermore, not only the peak at 30.7° disappears for the SCd-3 and SCd-4 films deposited with an increased S concentration, but there is also an appearance of shoulder like peaks at 24.8° and 28.1° which are indexed to the (100) and (101) planes of the hexagonal structure of CdS. Hence, with all due respect to the doubts regarding polymorphism being observed in the CdS structure, the films grown with the higher S concentration can be considered to grow into a hexagonal crystal structure. The (100) and (101) planes corresponding exclusively to the hexagonal CdS structure have been submerged for the SCd-5 sample; this hints towards the distortion of the structure to a cubic crystal structure due to increased chemical kinetics of CdS formation on account of increased sulfur ion concentration in the bath solution.
3.3 Surface morphological study

Fig. 2 shows scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of CdS thin films, with corresponding cross-sectional images in the inset. The images depict that the shape and size of the CdS nanostructures are very sensitive to the precursor concentration ratio. The morphology of the CdS thin films is altered from granular structures to vertically aligned nanoflakes, with a change in the S:Cd ratio as seen from Fig. 2(a–e). For the SCd-1 sample, the granular structures of CdS seem to be randomly distributed over the substrate. The average size of granules is 170 nm; these particles are interconnected to each other to form a cluster with some voids (Fig. 2a). For the SCd-2 sample, a similar kind of morphology to SCd-1 is observed with a reduced cluster size and an increased number of voids; again the average size of granules is reduced to 80 nm (Fig. 2b). The film thickness is found to be enhanced to ∼800 nm for the SCd-2 film compared to the SCd-1 film with ∼500 nm; the increased thickness can be attributed to the increase in sulfur concentration. A further increase in sulfur concentration causes a considerable change in the CdS morphology. In the SCd-3 sample, the surface of the CdS thin films changed from granular structures to vertically aligned nanoflakes. The nanoflakes possess an average height of about 2 μm and a thickness of ∼60 nm, as seen from Fig. 2c. These nanoflakes are interconnected to each other in order to form networks with triangular voids with an average size of ∼400–600 nm. Fig. 2d also depicts that a further increase in sulfur concentration (sample SCd-4) results in the formation of a similar type of nanoflakes with an average height of about 2.4 μm and a thickness of ∼40 nm. The density of the flakes is relatively enhanced compared to SCd-3, so the size of the voids is reduced to ∼300–500 nm. The porous voids generate abundant space ensuring easier electrolyte penetration and charge transport through the walls, which is desirable for PEC solar cells.21–23 Upon further increase in sulfur concentration, the morphology of the CdS thin films collapsed and a rough, loosely bound surface is formed (Fig. 2e).

3.4 Growth mechanism
The morphology of a film is greatly influenced by varying the sulfur ion concentration. The rate of reaction plays a crucial role in determining the shape, size and morphological features of the growing nanostructures. When the rate of reaction is low, the reaction proceeds under thermodynamic control, leading to isotropic growth of crystals. When the rate of reaction is high, the reaction proceeds under kinetic control, leading to anisotropic growth of crystals.24–26Fig. 3 shows schematic presentation of the steps involved in the formation of CdS thin films at different sulfur ion concentrations. Fig. 4 shows the growth of the nanoflakes with respect to time. These figures reveal that there is a continuous generation of nuclei at the substrate surface; initially these nuclei grow as discrete structures and as time passes they tend to coalesce with neighboring nuclei leading to the formation of films of CdS nanoflakes.

 Fig. 4  SEM images of the SCd-4 samples synthesized at different time periods. 
For sample SCd-1 (S:Cd = 1:1), the rate of reaction is low because the availability of sulfur towards the growing crystal faces is low, which is a consequence of the slow release of sulfur ions from the hydrolysis of thiourea. This is because of the lower solubility of thiourea, i.e. 0.2860 in 1000 ml of water or only a 0.2860 mole fraction of thiourea dissociates at 85 °C.13,27 At a low reaction rate, the nuclei tend to undergo isotropic growth leading to the formation of a thermodynamically favorable spherical morphology, so here we find the somewhat faceted quasi-spherical grains in the SCd-1 films.26 When the sulfur ion concentration is increased (SCd-2), the nucleation rate is found to be enhanced, while the consistent growth of the nucleated particle is reduced. This may be a consequence of the consumption of a large number of precursor ions in the nucleation process, which leads to a reduced ion concentration for the consistent growth of nucleated particles. This is an ordinary phenomenon for the continuous growth behavior.24 Thus at a S:Cd ratio of 1 we get large sized grains, whereas at a S:Cd ratio of 2 we get large numbers of small sized grains due to the enhanced nucleation rate and reduced growth rate. Further enhancement in sulfur concentration causes the reaction to proceed under kinetic control leading to anisotropic growth of crystals forming vertically aligned nanoflakes. The formation of flakes takes place in the initial period when the rate of reaction is high, and as time passes the reaction rate goes on decreasing due to the consumption of precursor ions during flake formation, thus in the later period of deposition there is formation of spheres due to the reduced reaction rate, and these spheres are found to be settled on flakes.25 Thus we get the nanoparticle loaded, vertically aligned CdS nanoflakes for SCd-3 films. For the SCd-4 sample, the nucleation rate increases even more than that for SCd-3, hence there is the formation of large numbers of flakes with enhanced density. Similar to the SCd-3 sample, here the formation of the CdS nanoparticles also takes place in the later period of deposition, due to the reduced reaction rate, which is a consequence of the decrement in ion concentration. Further increase in concentration, i.e. for sample SCd-5, results in an overloading of flakes and particles on the substrate, thus the film gets peeled off from the substrate.
3.5 Transmission electron microscopy
Low and high resolution TEM analysis was carried out on the SCd-4 sample by preparing a suspension of CdS nanocrystals in methanol and then loading it onto a holey carbon Cu grid. Fig. 5(a) shows a low resolution TEM image consisting of nanosized CdS flakes randomly bunched together. A well-articulated individual 2D nanosheet of CdS is depicted in Fig. 5(b). One can notice a gradual change of contrast in the TEM image omnipresent towards the edges of the nanosheet as shown in the inset (area marked between lines), implying that the 2D nanocrystal gets thinner at the edges. A feature like this suggests a gradual two-dimensional growth along the lengths and breadths of a nanocrystal with little influence on the thickness or height of the flake. The HRTEM image of the CdS nanoflakes (Fig. 5(c)) at the edge gives a better picture where one can distinguish the presence of growth steps marked as area 1 and area 2 spanning towards the edge. The growth has taken place along the ab-plane, understood from the interplaner spacing of 0.20 nm and 0.35 nm along the (110) and (100) planes, respectively. The growth along these planes elucidates well with the 2D growth of the wurtzite CdS nanocrystals. Fig. 5(e) gives a better understanding of the atomic arrangements and structure of the CdS nanoflakes. It shows a HR-TEM image of the distinct CdS nanoflakes present in the SCd-4 sample. Fig. 5(d) and (f) respectively show the FFT image and the magnified clear picture of the atomic arrangement (inverse FFT image) observed in the marked area. The FFT pattern confirms the presence of a (100) family of planes that form the wurtzite crystal structure with an interplaner spacing of 0.35 nm and zone axis 〈0001〉. A symbolic picture of the atomic arrangement is depicted in the inset of Fig. 5(f) which elucidates the atomic configuration of the 2D nanosheet consisting of (100) planes spanning along the basal plane. This signifies that the growth of the 2D CdS nanocrystals has been confined along the family of 〈100〉 directions and the (0001) plane. This kind of growth is kinetically driven and occurs only when the rate of growth is higher along the 〈100〉 direction and significantly less along the 〈0001〉 direction. Thus one can conclude that the increase in sulfur ion concentration has led to the formation of a growth unit that finds a wide range of growth sites along the 〈100〉 direction to drive the formation of CdS nanoflakes.

The FFT processed image of the selected flake area is shown in figure (f). 
3.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
The composition and phase purity of the CdS thin film surfaces were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Fig. 6 shows the XP survey spectrum of all CdS films in the range of 5–1000 eV. All the peaks observed in the spectrum are appropriately indexed to the photoelectron response from the elements Cd, S, O and C. The impurity of C may be due to oils from the vacuum pump, and O impurity may be due to chemisorbed oxygen. There is no impurity peak of nitrogen and sulphates arising from the precursors of sulfur and cadmium during CdS growth. The core level spectrum of Cd comprises of two strong peaks forming a doublet (Fig. 6a). These doublet feature results due to the spin–orbit splitting give rise to a Cd3d5/2 peak corresponding to the lower binding energy (BE) of 405.3 eV and a Cd3d3/2 peak at a higher BE of 412 eV.28 These two peaks are observed to be at a standard spin–orbit separation of 6.7 eV.29 Similarly the core level spectrum of S comprises of two peaks corresponding to S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 observed at around 161 eV and 162.1 eV30 with a spin–orbit separation of about 1.15 eV (Fig. 6b).28
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra of the CdS thin films deposited at different sulfur concentrations: (a) full spectra, (b) Cd3d spectra, and (c) S2p spectra. 
It is noticeable to observe that even though the sulfur concentration is varied through the films from SCd-1 to SCd-5, the ratio of Cd:S remains nearly the same at 1.4, indicating the formation of sulfur deficient CdS films, which is quite common in the chemical deposition of CdS, and sulfur deficiency in CdS contributing to its n-type conductivity.31,32 Thus it seems that even though the amount of S ions is considerably varied, the surface composition of the film remains the same. Hence the variation in S ion concentration has a dominant effect only on the reaction dynamics, which alters the morphology and has no influence on the elemental composition of the film surface.
3.7 Raman spectroscopy studies
The Raman spectra for the CdS films over 100 to 950 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 7(a). There are two major peaks at 300 cm−1 and ∼600 cm−1 with a broad hump appearing at around 900 cm−1. The peak at 300 cm−1 corresponds to the fundamental phonon mode, while those at around 600 and 900 cm−1 are the two respective overtones of the fundamental mode.33 These fundamental phonon modes appear in the case of both cubic and hexagonal structures of CdS. The peak at about 300 cm−1 resembles the peak for the LO phonon mode for the cubic structure, while the same peak also appears for the A1(LO) + E1(LO) phonon mode for the hexagonal crystal structure. These peaks along with their higher order overtones at about 600 cm−1 and 900 cm−1 are observed both in the hexagonal and cubic crystal structures of CdS.34,35 This is because the longitudinal phonon modes are polarized in the x–y face with strong coupling to excitations along the c-axis. The anion–cation bonds along the c-axis of the crystal structure are the same for the hexagonal and cubic crystal structures. The influence of different bonds for other atoms on the top or bottom ions does not seem to be important because of the symmetry on the anion–cation longitudinal vibrations. Thus these vibrational modes for both the cubic and hexagonal polymorphs of CdS nearly coincide and cannot be used to distinguish the structures.34,35 Furthermore, there is an upward trend in all the films towards the higher frequencies, which may be due to photoluminescence superimposed signals.35,36 The inset of the figure shows the normalized signal of the fundamental phonon mode and its first overtone, of all the films. It is interesting to observe that the intensity of these phonon modes decreases up to SCd-4 and then increases for the SCd-5 film. This decrease in the intensity in the present case is consistent with the transformation of CdS morphology from spherical particles to vertically aligned nanoflakes, which further increases in the case of the SCd-5 sample consisting of flake-like arrangements with an increased growth of spherical particles.

The insets show the background-removed signal of fundamental phonon mode and its first overtone. (b) UV-Visible absorption spectra. (c) Tauc plot for the CdS thin films for different sulfur concentrations. 
3.8 Optical absorption studies
The variation of optical absorption density (αt) with a wavelength (λ) studied at room temperature (∼27 °C) is shown in Fig. 7(b) and the Tauc plot is shown in Fig. 7(c). All films present an intrinsic absorption band edge at wavelength ∼540 nm, which is caused by the transition of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. The additional absorption hump in the visible region of the SCd-3 and SCd-4 films belongs to the light scattering effect offered by triangular voids formed in the network of vertically aligned nanoflakes.37,38 This phenomenon in the SCd-3 and SCd-4 films cause light extinction via diffuse reflections within the voids, which results in an enhancement in photon absorption and hence an electron–hole pair generation.37,38
The Tauc plot, (αhν)2versus hν,39–41 based on the spectral response of the samples, gives a straight line extrapolation from the linear part of the curve. This extrapolated intercept corresponds to the band gap value Eg of the samples. The observed band gap values are 2.0 eV, 2.18 eV, 2.27 eV, 2.30 eV and 2.10 eV respectively for SCd-1, SCd-2, SCd-3, SCd-4 and SCd-5. The band gap values seem to be increasing with the increase in S:Cd ratio. The widening in the band gap can be attributed to the increased thiourea concentration, change in morphology and surface nanostructures.42,43 It has been reported that an increase in thiourea concentration reduces the particle size and widens the band gap.15
3.9 Photo electrochemical solar cell study

Fig. 8 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) plots for the CdS thin films under dark and illumination of 27 mW cm−2 conditions. The photo electrochemical measurement confirms the photo-activity of the CdS thin films prepared using the reflux method. The power conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cells is calculated using the following equation: (1)where FF is the fill factor and is calculated using the formula (2)Here Imax is the maximum current density, Vmax is the maximum voltage, Voc is the open circuit voltage, Isc is the short circuit current density and Pin is the power density of the incident light.
 Fig. 8  Current density–voltage characteristics of the CdS thin films deposited at different sulfur concentrations on FTO with a CdS/Na2S + NaOH + S/CE cell structure under dark conditions and illumination of 27 mW cm−2. 
Important parameters that are obtained from the power output curve are listed in Table 1. From the table we observe that Isc, Voc and hence the efficiency of the solar cell also increases with the increase in sulfur ion concentration and then decreases drastically for the SCd-5 sample. The maximum power conversion efficiency of about 0.6% is obtained for the SCd-4 films. The power conversion efficiency is determined by various factors such as (i) the surface area of the film, which provides effective interfacial reaction sites, (ii) the morphological features (size, shape, grain boundary, and interconnection of particles) that define the energetics and kinetics at the electrode interface and (iii) efficient harnessing of the photogenerated charge carriers in the semiconductor.44 Here in the case of the SCd-1 and SCd-2 thin films, the granule-like morphology provides less active surface area and therefore does not facilitate efficient charge transport due to maximum grain boundaries. Furthermore, effective light harvesting through the scattering phenomenon is not observed in the SCd-1 and SCd-2 films. Whereas for the SCd-3 and SCd-4 films, the flake-like morphology provides a large surface area that traps light in voids of interconnected nanowall networks; it allows light to undergo multiple scatterings, which leads to an increase in the optical path length within the photoanode and thereby an increase in the probability of interaction between the photons and the CdS photoanode. The nanomorphology also facilitates an easy and direct transport of the photo-generated electrons through hexagonal crystallites of flakes to the conducting substrate; due to the decrement in grain boundary resistance in the charge transport process, the data of series resistance obtained from J–V plots also supports this assumption. Thus power conversion efficiency is found to be enhanced for these films due to efficient light trapping structures, offering easy charge transport with a minimum recombination loss. For the SCd-4 film the density of the flakes is found to be enhanced compared to SCd-3, so it possesses a slightly higher light harvesting capability compared to SCd-3. The light trapping structures found in the SCd-3 and SCd-4 films start to collapse with further enhancement in thiourea concentration (SCd-5), which deteriorates the light harvesting and power conversion efficiency.

3.10 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

Fig. 9 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of all CdS thin films with the FTO/CdS/Na2S-NaOH-S/G configuration measured in the dark. The inset figure demonstrates the corresponding equivalent circuit diagram. The electrochemical impedance spectra exhibit two arcs, the small arc at higher frequency is related to the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct), whereas the larger arc at a lower frequency corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the CdS photo electrode/electrolyte interface (Rw). CPE1 and CPE2 represent the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to Rct and Rw, respectively.45 The ohmic serial resistance Rs is associated with the overall series resistance of the electrolyte and the electric contacts. The diameter of the arcs decreases with the increase in sulfur ion concentration up to SCd-4, indicating an enhancement in the ease of charge transfer at the interfaces of the counter electrode/electrolyte (Rct) and the CdS/electrolyte (Rw). The structure was ruptured for SCd-5, which hampers the charge transfer kinetics, resulting in enhanced arc diameter.

4. Conclusion
We have successfully synthesized hexagonal wurtzite CdS nanoflake SCd-3 and SCd-4 thin films via a simple, one step and template free reflux method. The shape evolution of the CdS nanostructures with a change in sulfur concentration has been manifested. Sulfur concentration plays an important role in defining the size and shape of the CdS nanostructures. An increase in sulfur concentration enhances the rate of reaction, which leads to anisotropic growth of the crystal face oriented along the c-axis, resulting in the formation of CdS nanoflakes. Photo-electrochemical studies demonstrate the good feasibility of the CdS nanoflake structures for PEC solar cell applications.
