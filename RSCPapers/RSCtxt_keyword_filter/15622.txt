Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted significant attention as low-cost alternatives to commercial solar cells.1 With the general composition of a photoanode (usually TiO2 sensitized with dye), electrolyte and counter electrode (generally Pt), DSCs simulate the photosynthesis process in nature for realizing photoelectric conversion. One of the key constituent parts of a DSC is the electrolyte, which is in charge of charge transfer, thus showing significant impact on the DSC performance. Conventional liquid electrolytes have achieved high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with good reliability.2–5 However, the traditional liquid electrolytes suffer from volatilization of organic solvents, resulting in the electrolyte leakage, sealing difficulty, decreased efficiency and unsatisfactory stability performance. This limits the further practical application of liquid electrolytes. Therefore, a wide variety of alternatives have been investigated, including ionic liquids (ILs)6–22 and quasi-solid-state23–42 and solid-state electrolytes.43–54 Aqueous-based electrolytes is another important alternative system, emerging with the features of safety, environmental compatibility, low cost and stability.55–58 Among them, solvent-free room temperature IL-based electrolytes have exhibited attractive photovoltaic performance due to their excellent physicochemical properties.16–18 The problem of the IL electrolytes is that the present efficiency is restricted and unsatisfactory compared with liquid ones due to the limited types of traditional ILs and the low conductivity and high viscosity accompanied with incomplete filling of the electrolyte in mesoporous TiO2 films. In addition, some ILs with complex procedures and expensive starting materials hinder the further development and application of IL-based electrolytes. As a consequence, it remains a challenge to develop new families of IL-based electrolytes with high conductivities and superior photovoltaic performances.
Herein, we report a new series of soft materials, which were successfully obtained by a simple synthetic method with a task-specific ionic liquid (TSIL) and metal oxides in water. The coordination reactions of the TSIL with different metal oxides were systematically investigated and analyzed. The series of obtained ionic liquid–metal complexes (ILMCs) were developed for efficient electrolytes of DSCs, which exhibit remarkable increases in efficiency with a multiple of 1.46–2.63 when compared with the IL electrolyte without a metal center. A high conversion efficiency of 6.38% was achieved. The influencing factors on the photovoltaic performance of cells resulting from different metal centers are systematically analyzed and discussed. The novelty is mainly embodied in three aspects. First, the ILMCs with different metal centers of Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, La, Pb, Zn, and Cd are obtained by our developed simple synthetic method using water. Second, there have been only few reports on the different task-specific ionic liquids for solubilizing metal oxides.59,60 Furthermore, the reported products are solids, not the quasi-solid-state soft materials in this work. In another word, the developed ILMCs with different metal centers in this work are novel themselves. Third, the application of the developed ILMCs with different metal centers is also novel. There have been no reports on these ILMC-based electrolytes for DSCs. The advantages of a clean and easy preparation method, simple composition, high conductivity, and superior conversion efficiency qualify the developed ILMC-based soft materials as promising alternative electrolytes for DSCs.

All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Preparation of ionic liquid–metal complexes
A typical synthetic method for ILMCs with different metal centers is as follows. Rare earth metal oxides or transition metal oxides (La2O3, Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Y2O3, Er2O3, Nd2O3, ZnO, Eu2O3, PbO, CdO, CuO, WO3, Cr2O3, Al2O3, Co2O3, Fe2O3, and NiO) (4 mmol) were introduced into a task-specific ionic liquid with a carboxylic acid group, CEMImBr (10 mmol). Then the mixtures in 100 ml H2O were heated at 100 °C for 12 h. After that, the reaction mixtures were filtered to remove the excess metal oxides and the filtrate was further processed by rotary evaporation to remove water. Then, transparent ionic liquid–metal chelate complexes with different colors and significantly increased viscosity were obtained. The ILMCs with different mental centers were further dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight to obtain the final products. The products with successful chelation reactions were named as Eu-ILMC, Gd-ILMC, Er-ILMC, Nd-ILMC, Y-ILMC, Sm-ILMC, La-ILMC, Pb-ILMC, Zn-ILMC, and Cd-ILMC, respectively. More detailed synthetic and characterization information on all ten complexes can be found in the ESI† along with the 1H-NMR results, mass spectra, Raman spectra, thermogravimetric results, SEM, optical microscope images and computerized tomography (CT) images.

Traditional liquid electrolyte contained the components of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII and additives of 0.1 M GuSCN and 0.5 M TBP.

Preparation of the TiO2 photoanode and fabrication of solar cells
A 10 μm thick layer of 20 nm TiO2 (P25, Degussa, Germany) was attached to a FTO glass by a screen printing technique. The obtained film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 films were immersed in 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye in ethanol for 20 h. The dye-sensitized photoanode (area: 0.16 cm2) was assembled with a platinized counter electrode with the corresponding electrolyte injected into the cell.
Characterization
Infrared absorption spectra were recorded within the region of 4000–400 cm−1 on a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Nicolet 380, USA) by the KBr pellet technique. SEM images were taken by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020, Hitachi, Japan). The measurement parameters of the accelerating voltage, the E beam current, and the work distance were set as 2.0 kV, 10 μA and 3 mm, respectively. Laser Raman spectra were studied on a laser Raman spectrometer (LabRam HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyzer (Bruker AVANCE 600, Switzerland). Mass spectra were recorded by using a Q-TOF MS apparatus with the ESI ionization mode (ESI-QTOF, Bruker, Germany). Thermogravimetric studies were analyzed by using a DSC-60A (Shimadzu, Japan) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a temperature range of 0–700 °C using dried nitrogen as the purging gas. Optical microscope images were measured on an optical microscope (BX53M, Olympus, Japan). The computerized tomography measurements were conducted on a 3D X-ray computerized tomograph (Xradia 410 Versa, Carl Zeiss, USA). Current–voltage curves were conducted by using a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2400, USA) under a solar simulator simulating the AM 1.5 spectrum (100 mW cm−2, Class AAA, Oriel, USA). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (Newport, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Zenium Zahner, Germany) was actualized under dark conditions with a bias voltage corresponding to Voc. The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz and the AC amplitude was set to 10 mV. The ionic conductivity measurements were determined by an AC impedance technique using Zahner Zennium (Germany) with the sandwiched conductors between two identical Pt electrodes. The frequency ranged from 1 Hz to 1 MHz and the AC amplitude was set at 10 mV. The diffusion coefficient value (D) of I3− was obtained from the polarization measurements (Zenium Zahner, Germany) with symmetrical Pt cells injected with an electrolyte and sealed with a Surlyn film. The diffusion-limiting current density was measured by cyclic voltammetry using a scan rate of 2 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
The simple synthetic route of ILMCs with different metal centers of Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, La, Pb, Zn, and Cd is shown in Fig. 1a. The soft materials could be successfully achieved by adding rare earth metal oxides or transition metal oxides with the carboxyl-functionalized task-specific ionic liquid into the water. In this work, the IL-based starting material is 1-(1-carboxyethyl)-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide (CEMImBr). The presence of water could facilitate the dissolution process of metal oxides in carboxylic acid group-based ILs.60 It could be attributed to the deprotonation of the carboxyl group and increased mobility of the carboxylic proton to a great extent.59,61 After reflux and filtering excess metal oxides, the obtained solutions were further evaporated to remove water and give ILMC complexes with different metal centers (M-ILMC). Rare earth metal oxides containing Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Er2O3, Nd2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3 and La2O3, transition metal oxides PbO, ZnO, and CdO were found successfully reacted with CEMImBr to form the ILMC complexes. Some metal oxides, such as CuO, WO3, Cr2O3, Al2O3, Co2O3, Fe2O3, NiO, were insoluble and could not react with CEMImBr under the same conditions, even when the reaction time was extended to 24 h (W, Al, Fe, Ni). This phenomenon is similar to the conclusion from the other reports with different TSILs.59Fig. 1a shows the pictures of the starting material CEMImBr (left) and the obtained ILMC complexes with different metal centers (right). Eu based-ILMC is designated as the reference object, which has been reported in our previous work.62 The ILMC complexes exhibited obvious different colors (transparent pale yellow Eu-ILMC, transparent colorless Gd-ILMC, orange red Er-ILMC, purple Nd-ILMC, light yellow Y-ILMC, bright yellow Sm-ILMC, transparent colorless La-ILMC, transparent faint yellow Pb-ILMC, white Zn-ILMC and Cd-ILMC). Among them, Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, and La-based ILMCs appeared as a quasi-solid-state, Pb-ILMC was a completely liquid-state, and Zn and Cd-based ILMCs showed a solid state (shown in Fig. 1). It's interesting that the comparatively harder state Nd-ILMC and Y-ILMC among the quasi-solid-state samples and the solid-state Zn and Cd-based ILMCs provide an obviously different 3D morphology under X-ray computerized tomography, as shown in Fig. 2. The detailed 2D and 3D morphology information with different transparency values is listed in Fig. S1–S4.† Here, the quasi-solid-state Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, and La-based ILMCs as a kind of soft materials are different from the reported typical and representative IL-water gels.63,64 It's worth noting that water is introduced into the reaction as the solvent in the synthesis of ILMC complexes. In this chelate reaction, the metal oxides reacted with the –COOH group from CEMImBr. The carbonyl group chelates with the metal center and H2O is correspondingly formed. Excess metal oxides are removed by filtration and the filtrate was further processed to remove water to obtain the final pure ILMCs with different metal centers. In this process, water acts as the reaction solvent, not as the liquid medium of the conventional “gel”. It's the final obtained ILMC complexes that exhibit the gel-state or gel-like appearance and some similar characters by themselves. This is different from the conventional concept of “gel”, which consists of a solid three-dimensional network that spans the volume of a liquid medium and ensnares it through surface tension effects.

The FT-IR spectra of CEMImBr and ILMCs (with metal centers of Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, La, Pb, Zn, and Cd) with the highest exposure to the region below 2000 cm−1 are provided in Fig. 3. This region often gives more features for FT-IR spectra. All the ILMCs show the distinct characteristic peaks from CEMImBr in the FT-IR spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a and S5,† the characteristic peak of νCO for –COOH from CEMImBr is situated at 1724 cm−1. However, it disappears in all the spectra of the above mentioned ILMCs. Correspondingly, two new characteristic peaks near 1570 and 1440 cm−1 are found for ILMCs (the detailed characteristic peaks are shown in Table S1†).

Take La-ILMC for instance, as shown in Fig. 3b and S6,† the characteristic peak of νCO at 1724 cm−1 from the –COOH group of CEMImBr is substituted by the peaks at 1570 cm−1 and 1437 cm−1, which could be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretch of the carboxylate group (νas(–COO−) and νs(–COO−)), respectively. The whole FT-IR spectra with exposure to the region below 4000 cm−1 are provided in the ESI (Fig. S5 and S6†). The result indicates that the –COOH group from CEMImBr has successfully reacted with metal oxides to form the chelate metal complexes.62,65–67 All the ten ILMCs containing metal centers of Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, La, Pb, Zn, and Cd exhibit the new generated characteristic peaks of νas(–COO−) and νs(–COO−), indicating that the obtained chelate complexes are derived from the coordination of –COO− groups with metal centers.59–62,65–67 However, Cu, W, Cr, Al, Co, Fe, and Ni-based reactions show no change in the FT-IR spectra of Fig. S7,† meaning no chelate metal complex is formed under our conditions, which is similar to the results using different TSILs.59 Furthermore, the comparison characterization on the Raman spectra of all the complexes and CEMImBr have also been carried out as the supplementary instruction on the FT-IR measurements. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of CEMImBr and ILMCs (with metal centers of Eu, Gd, Er, Nd, Y, Sm, La, Pb, Zn, and Cd) in the range of 500–2000 cm−1 (Fig. S8† offers the corresponding comparison Raman spectra in the range of 0–3200 cm−1). The differences are seen very clearly in the characteristic peak values of CEMImBr and ILMCs with different metal centers below 1000 cm−1 from the comparison spectra shown in Fig. S9–S18.† It's worth noting that the characteristic peak of νCO for –COOH from CEMImBr at 1713 cm−1 disappears in all the spectra of ILMCs. This result is in correspondence with that of FT-IR spectra.

The obtained soft materials were developed as high efficient electrolytes of DSCs. A series of ILMC-based electrolytes were prepared by simply adding 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, PMII into the ILMC complexes (V:V = 3:1). Meanwhile, the IL-based electrolyte was also prepared with the same composition for comparison. The detailed information on the electrolyte and fabrication of cells could be found in the Experimental section. All the ionic liquid mixtures in electrolytes of IL/PMII and ILMC/PMII exhibited good thermostability, especially La-ILMC, Gd-ILMC, Sm-ILMC, Y-ILMC, Er-ILMC, Nd-ILMC and Eu-ILMC, as shown in (Fig. S19 and S20†). In our previous work, the Eu-ILMC based electrolyte exhibited a remarkable improvement in photovoltaic performance compared with ILs without a metal center. A power conversion efficiency of nearly 7% and superior long-term stability were achieved. Here, a series of ILMCs with different metal centers are compared with Eu-ILMC, which is designated as the reference object. It is noteworthy that no other additives are used in the ILMC electrolyte system.

Fig. 5 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the TiO2 electrode filled with the ILMC-based electrolyte. Fig. 5a and b give the surface morphology of the TiO2 electrode and TiO2 electrode filled with the La-ILMC based electrolyte. The SEM images of the TiO2 electrode and TiO2 electrode filled with the La-ILMC based electrolyte under the same magnification are shown in Fig. S21 and S22.† The optical microscope results in Fig. S23 and S24† exhibit the intuitive view of the TiO2 electrode and TiO2 electrode filled with the La-ILMC based electrolyte. The surface morphology in Fig. 5c exhibits the homogeneous and smooth features of the ILMC. The cross-sectional morphology of the TiO2 electrode filled with the La-ILMC based electrolyte in Fig. 5d clarifies the fact that ILMC-based electrolytes could be effectively filled into the inner nanonetwork of the TiO2 electrode.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSCs with ILMC-based electrolytes are shown in Fig. 6 with the corresponding parameters summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 6a, all of the ILMC electrolytes with different metal centers exhibit almost the same level open-circuit photovoltage (Voc). However, the differences in short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) result in completely different photovoltaic performances. Among them, the La-ILMC device provides the best photovoltaic performance (PCE of 6.38%) due to the highest Jsc (12.68 mA cm−2), which is slightly lower than the value of 7.08% for traditional liquid electrolytes with additives (Fig. 6b and Table S2†). The values of Voc, Jsc and fill factor (FF) of the Gd-ILMC based DSC are 0.69 V, 11.73 mA cm−2, and 0.76, respectively, yielding the PCE of 6.15%. The Sm-ILMC device results in a PCE of 5.26%. The DSCs with Y, Er, Nd and Zn-ILMC electrolytes exhibit similar PCEs ranging from 4.14% to 4.83%. Although with a higher Jsc, the PCE of the Zn-ILMC electrolyte is lower than the values of Er and Nd due to the slightly lower Voc and FF. It's noteworthy that seven kinds of M-ILMC electrolytes achieve superior photovoltaic performance compared with our previously reported Eu-ILMC (performance of Pb is similar to Eu).62 Cd-ILMC is not listed here due to the desorption effect on dyes. The remarkable improvements on the photovoltaic performance are achieved for all the ILMC electrolytes compared with an IL electrolyte without a metal center (Table S2†). Although the present conversion efficiencies in this work are lower compared with the best results of DSCs,16,68 it's worth noting that all the corresponding experimental data in this work are obtained without any optimization. We kept all the experiments and measurements under the same conditions for precise comparison on the photovoltaic performance of ILMCs and IL in the simplest situations. It's well known that the photovoltaic performance of the device is closely connected with the properties of each component and the optimization on device and related materials is an effective method for further improving the performance of the device, such as using a high-efficient TiO2 photoelectrode and a counter electrode and adding additives of TBP and GuNCS in the electrolyte system, as well as a proper different redox couple.68

To further investigate the effect of different metal centers of ILMCs on the solar cell performance, the conductivity, polarization measurement and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are employed. The conductivity of the electrolyte is regarded as one of the key factors that affect the performance of DSCs.16,45 The ionic conductivity can be calculated by the following equation:69 (1)where L is the thickness of the electrolyte, A is the area of the electrode and Rb is the bulk resistance of the electrolyte obtained from impedance measurements. Rb is taken at the intercept of the Nyquist plot with the real axis. As shown in Fig. 7a, the ILMCs with different metal centers exhibited the room temperature conductivities ranging from 0.21 to 1.04 mS cm−1. The corresponding ILMC electrolytes give higher conductivity values from 1.48 to 2.42 mS cm−1. The enhanced conductivity of ILMC electrolytes could be attributed to the accelerated charge transfer resulted from the typical three-dimensional network structures of these ionic liquid–metal complexes and the interactions between Li+ and carbonyl groups in complexes.61 This result is consistent to previous reported work.45,62 Furthermore, both of the conductivities of ILMC and ILMC electrolyte series are in good accordance with the Jsc values in the order of La, Gd, Sm, Y, Zn, Er, Nd, Eu, Pb from the highest to lowest.
 Fig. 7  (a) The conductivity of conductors based on ILMCs and ILMC electrolytes. (b) Polarization measurements of ILMC electrolytes with different metal centers. 
The polarization measurement is introduced to investigate the charge transport and diffusion mechanism in different electrolytes. The polarization curves of ILMC electrolytes are shown in Fig. 7b. The diffusion coefficient of I3− (DI3−) in an electrolyte could be determined from the limiting current density (ilim) by the following equation:27,70,71 (2)where n is the number of electrons transferred in each reaction (here n = 2), F is Faraday's constant, L is the distance between two electrodes (here L = 75 μm) and CI3− is the molar concentration of I3− (here CI3− = 0.1 M). The obtained ilim and DI3− values for ILMC electrolytes with different metal centers are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 7b and Table 1, the ilim values of ILMC electrolytes range from 0.93 to 2.17 mA cm−2 with a result of the corresponding DI3− from 1.81 to 4.23 × 10−7 cm2 s−1. This result follows the order of conductivity and is also consistent with the tendency of Jsc. Here, the high diffusion coefficient of I3− in the electrolyte facilitates the I− generation process and suppresses the recombination between I3− and injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band, contributing to the improvement of photovoltaic performance of the device.
To further clarify the electron transport mechanism of different photovoltaic performances of ILMC electrolytes, the EIS results of four typical electrolytes based on ILMCs with metal centers of La, Sm, Y and Eu are shown in Fig. 8. The series resistances, Rs, are almost the same due to the similar FTO substrates. The charge transfer resistances in the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, Rct, are 7.51 Ω, 11.41 Ω, 12.04 Ω and 13.50 Ω for La, Sm, Y and Eu-based electrolytes, respectively. The lowest charge transfer impedance at the counter electrode with the La-ILMC electrolyte is in accordance with the highest limiting current density for the iodide/triiodide couple and the highest Jsc. On the contrary, the lower Jsc values of Sm, Y and Eu-ILMC electrolytes are obtained with the higher charge transfer resistances. Furthermore, EIS can also be used to analyze the relationship between Voc and the interfacial charge transfer kinetics. The Voc can be expressed as the following equation:72 (3)where R is the molar gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, β is the reaction order for electrons, A is the electrode area, I is the incident photon flux, n0 is the concentration of accessible electronic states in the conduction band, and k1 and k2 are the kinetic constants of the back reaction of injected electrons with triiodide and the recombination of these electrons with oxidized dyes (D+), respectively. Here, k1 can be replaced by the frequency at the maximum imaginary resistance of the intermediate semicircle (ωmax).73Voc will depend logarithmically on (1/ωmax) as [I3−] is constant and the loss term (n0k2[D+]) can be neglected. Thus, a higher ωmax will result in a lower Voc. This could explain the fact that the Sm-ILMC electrolyte obtained a slightly higher Voc of 0.71 V than La-ILMC with the ωmax values of 836 and 1320 Hz, respectively. This result gives further support for the varied photovoltaic performance of the ILMC electrolytes with different metal centers.

Conclusions
In conclusion, ten new soft materials of ionic liquid–metal complexes with different metal centers were successfully developed by a simple synthetic method. The coordination of carboxyl-functionalized task-specific ionic liquids with different metals was systematically investigated and analyzed. The obtained ILMCs as efficient electrolytes of DSCs exhibited superior photovoltaic performance and remarkably increased PCEs with a multiple of 1.46–2.63 compared with that of IL electrolyte without metal center. The PCEs up to 6.38% were achieved based on ILMC electrolytes without any purification, which is comparable to the value of traditional liquid electrolytes. The mechanism investigations clarified the influences of different metal centers on the conversion efficiencies of the corresponding devices. The high conductivity and diffusion coefficient of I3−, suppressed electron recombination, as well as low charge transfer impedance, contribute to the superior photovoltaic performance of the devices. The advantages of simple composition, high conductivity, and superior conversion efficiency along with an easy fabrication method qualify the developed ILMC-based soft materials as promising high-efficient alternative electrolytes of DSCs. The findings presented in this work will provide an effective way for designing new types of electrolytes towards high-efficient DSCs. To further improve the conversion efficiencies of the ILMC-based DSCs, it's feasible to improve the ILMC materials, such as changing the metal center and the task-specific ionic liquid. Furthermore, very effective methods are to optimize the photoelectrode, counter electrode, and electrolyte composition, add additives of TBP and GuNCS in the electrolyte system, search for a better different redox couple, and so on.
