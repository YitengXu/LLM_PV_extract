It was found that the decay of open circuit voltage (Voc) was significantly minimized by avoiding the direct contact of nanotubes to the conducting substrate by introducing a thin buffer layer of TiO2 while maintaining the superior electron collection efficiency from the incorporation of nanotubes.
During the past decade, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) attracted considerable attention as an alternative technology for future energy generation due to their facile, cost-effective fabrication method.1–3 DSSCs are generally constructed with a dye-adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 film as the photoanode, electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples, and a Pt-coated counter electrode. The charge transport across the mesoporous TiO2 electrode is known to be a major bottleneck limiting energy conversion efficiency. Even though the well ordered or aligned TiO2 network with one-dimensional directionality has been suggested for effective electron transport pathways,4–10 it was generally proved to be unsuccessful in enhancing the overall efficiency of DSSCs.7
Meanwhile, numerous studies have been reported to incorporate carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the TiO2 mesoporous layer11–17 to take advantage of highly efficient electron collection and transporting capability instead of developing a metal oxide based one-dimensional aligned structure in the photoelectrode. However, it was found that the net power conversion efficiency was not enhanced even with the increase of the photocurrent density due to the significant decay of open circuit voltage (Voc) in DSSCs.11,13,14 This was attributed to the facilitated recombination loss of electrons in the photoelectrode with redox couples in the electrolyte18,19 upon incorporation of nanotubes in the TiO2 layer. We noted that the recombination process is dependent on the formation of two different types of surface states or traps at hetero-junction interfaces of FTO|CNTs and TiO2|CNTs, lying energetically below the Fermi level of FTOs and the conduction band edge of TiO2 nanoparticles (ECB,TiO2), respectively. This is generally consistent with the negative shift of the quasi Fermi level of the photoelectrode due to equilibration with a much lower Fermi level of carbon nanotubes (−4.64 eV). In this study, we designed three different spatial arrangements of CNTs in the mesoporous TiO2 layer to control the distribution and density of surface states in the photoelectrode (as described in Scheme 1) to elucidate their effects on the overall photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs.

EFTO and ECNT are the Fermi energies of FTO and CNT, respectively. The quasi Fermi level of TiO2 (EFn) shifted negatively for CNTs–TiO2 photoelectrodes () due to equilibration with surface states having much lower energy levels (red line) at the interfaces of FTO|CNTs and TiO2|CNTs. The green shaded region shows the exponential distribution of the surface states. 
Photoelectrodes of three different spatial arrangements of nanotubes in the TiO2 layer with ca. 1 μm thickness were prepared by spin coating. It was desirable to maintain the thickness of the TiO2 layer at a thin enough level to isolate and amplify the effect of surface states on cell performance when nanotubes were introduced into the photoanode. First, the CNT-dispersed TiO2 colloidal mixture was spun coated twice on FTO in a similar way to the conventional design of CNT-incorporated TiO2 photoelectrodes reported elsewhere.12–15 In addition, TiO2 film of the same thickness was prepared over the nanotubes layer deposited on FTO electrophoretically20 as described in ESI.† This provided the electrode structure with nanotubes localized only at the interface between the FTO and TiO2 layer. Another structure was prepared by the introduction of a thin TiO2 layer between FTO and a nanotubes–TiO2 mixed layer as a buffer layer to prevent nanotubes from having direct contact to FTO. Hereafter, we designate these three types of photoelectrodes SI, SII, and SIII, respectively. Fig. 1 shows their cross-sectional SEM images along with the reference TiO2 photoelectrode. The nanotubes were clearly localized between FTO and TiO2 nanoparticles in SII structure, while they were well dispersed and buried in the mesoporous TiO2 layer in SI and SIII. All the fabrication processes and the measurements of photovoltaic properties are described in ESI.†

The homogeneous distribution of optimum amounts of CNTs into the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network enhanced the overall energy conversion efficiency for cells with SI and SIII, while the localization of CNTs on the conducting substrate (FTO) in SII did not contribute positively. SI and SIII exhibited 13 and 14% enhancement of overall energy conversion efficiency, respectively, whereas SII showed a decrease of up to 19% compared to the reference photoelectrode having the same thickness of the TiO2 layer only. The short circuit current density (Jsc) for SI, SII, and SIII increased by up to 19, 9, and 17%, respectively. The significant improvement of current densities can be attributed to the superior charge collection and transport properties of CNTs as reported previously.13,15,17 However, SII and SIII showed lower photocurrent compared to the conventional CNTs-dispersed structure (SI). For SIII, the thin TiO2 buffer layer slightly retarded the charge transport and collection from the CNTs–TiO2 mixed layer to the conducting substrate, FTO. It was notable that the highly localized CNT layers at the current collecting substrate in SII could still offer a higher current collection rate even without the presence of nanotube-based fast charge transporting channels within the TiO2 layer. The increased back reaction rate via substrate (known as leakage current) due to the existence of the nanotubes layer was also responsible for the lower current density in SII.
The variation of open circuit voltage was also significantly dependent on the electrode structure. Voc was almost similar to that of the reference system for SIII, while SI and SII displayed the decrease by ca. 30 and 56 mV, respectively. The formation of surface states or traps at hetero-junction interfaces of FTO|CNTs and TiO2|CNTs, denoted SFC and STC, respectively, were still considered a main source of Voc decay. Nevertheless, the existence of CNTs in the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network was very effective in boosting up the charge collection efficiency.
Both SFC and STC are formed energetically below the Fermi level of FTO and the conduction band edges of TiO2 (ECB,TiO2), respectively, because the Fermi energy of MWCNTs (−4.64 eV)18 is more negative than those of FTO (−4.4 eV)21 and pristine TiO2 nanoparticles (ca. −4.2 eV)22 as depicted in Scheme 1. The overall negative shift for the pseudo Fermi level of the photoelectrode23 is consistent with the significant decrease of apparent Voc upon incorporation of CNTs into the TiO2 layer.
The formation of these surface states was investigated by monitoring the non-faradic current flow at these electrodes. The capacitive charging current appearing in the forward scans in cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3a) could be attributed to the filling of coordinatively unsaturated Ti species (Ti4+ + e− ↔ Ti3+) on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, of which energy levels are below the conduction band edge of TiO2.24,25 The current essentially reached zero for reverse scans at sufficiently positive potentials because of the regeneration of most of the surface states by discharging. The higher capacitive currents for SI and SII compared to that of the TiO2 photoelectrode without CNTs indicated the existence of additional electronic states as traps below the conduction band edge of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles by introducing CNTs.
 Fig. 3  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of SI, SII, SIII, and reference TiO2 photoelectrodes in 0.5 M LiClO4 dissolved in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The capacitive charging current appearing at negative potential is due to filling of surface states below the conduction band edge of TiO2 for all structures. (b) The exponential distribution of density of states (DOS) was deduced by plotting capacitive charging of electrons into the surface states vs. applied potential. 
The distribution of trap states can be estimated from the density of states (DOS) calculation by DOS = dQ/dV × (F/NA), where Q is the total charge injected, NA the Avogadro number, F the Faraday constant, and V the potential applied to the electrode. It is generally consistent with the exponential distribution as shown in Fig. 3b while the onset of the DOS is dependent on the electrode structure. It was found that the energetic distribution of DOS for SIII was almost similar to that of the reference electrode with the onset of DOS for SIIIca. −4.42 eV (ca. vs. vacuum), while it was −4.5 and −4.6 eV for SI and SII, respectively. The downshift of the onset of the state distribution suggested a similar tendency of the conduction band edge shift26 and it is consistent with the variation of Voc for these electrode structures.
The Fermi energy difference caused by the surface states (Δ) quantitatively correlated with the ratio between the electron recombination rate from surface states to oxidized species (ks) and the electron detrapping rate to the conduction bands (ε) by the equation19EFs = EFn − Δ,where EFs and EFn are the Fermi energies of surface state and the pristine TiO2 film, respectively, with Δ = kBT ln(1 + ks/ε) depending on thermal energy for electron trapping (kBT). The value of ks/ε depended on the additional lower energy level surface states, which facilitating the recombination of trapped electrons with redox couples in the electrolyte. Surface states generated by CNTs in the TiO2 layer, being energetically deeply poised, would consequently increase the Fermi energy difference (Δ), which is in turn responsible for the Voc decrease because it is defined as the difference between the pseudo Fermi level of the photoelectrode and the energy level of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The bigger the Fermi energy difference, the more the recombination loss of electrons and therefore the more decrease in Voc. As a result, when CNTs were introduced into the TiO2 layer, Voc should have decreased by the enhanced electron recombination at FTO|CNTs and TiO2|CNTs interfaces.
Two types of surface states, the distribution of which was controllable by different special arrangements of nanotubes in the TiO2 layer, collectively contributed to increase the Fermi energy difference (Δ), and concurrently increase the back electron transfer to the electrolyte. The contribution of SFC, highly localized at the FTO surface, was most significant in SII but was eliminated in the SIII arrangement by introducing a thin TiO2 buffer layer. However, STC is homogeneously distributed over the mesoporous TiO2 layer in SI and on the upper layer in SIII, while the population of this state was highly localized on the FTO surface in SII arrangement. Similarly, the contribution of SFC to the J–V characteristics in SI was insignificant compared to that of STC. Therefore, consistent with the results in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the notable drop of Voc in SI and SII, attributable to the highly concentrated SFC particularly in the latter, almost disappeared in the SIII arrangement, in which the contribution of SFC was essentially removed by the buffer layer. The more favorable charge recombination to the electrolyte under the significant contribution of SFC in the SII arrangement is consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement.
The kinetics of electron transfer processes at the TiO2–CNTs|electrolyte interface measured by EIS under dark conditions explain the back transfer of electrons from both the conduction band of TiO2 and substrate to I3− of the electrolyte. The Bode plot and the calculated kinetic information of the cells with SI, SII and SIII electrodes are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. The rate of back electron transfer to I3− at the interface of TiO2|electrolyte (kT/E) was estimated from the mid-frequency peak as ωmax = kT/E.27 The high-frequency peak, , was related to both the charge transfer processes at the Pt|electrolyte and substrate|electrolyte interfaces. Due to the invariance of Pt|electrolyte interfaces for all electrodes in this study, any change of  was considered to originate from the variation of the back electron transfer rate at the interface between conducting substrate of photoelectrode, regardless of whether it was modified by CNTs, and the electrolyte solution. This allowed us to consider  as the apparent rate of back electron transfer from the substrate to electrolyte phase (kS/E), which corresponded to the electron leakage at the photoelectrode. The low frequency peak, which is related to the ionic diffusion process in the electrolyte, was supposed to merge into the mid-frequency peak as usual, but this was not clearly seen in our data. Enhancement of measured kT/E values for all electrodes having CNTs, being highest with the SII arrangement, strongly suggest facilitating back electron transfer to electrolyte via TiO2 particles. This was attributed to the role of CNTs as a highly conducting scaffold at the FTO–TiO2 contact and the enhancement of back electron transfer at TiO2|electrolyte interface at the closest TiO2 layer through the high density of localized surface states (both SFC and STC, respectively) in SII. The increase of back electron transfer from TiO2 to electrolytes (kT/E) attributable to the highly localized STC was additionally contributed by the conductivity increase at the FTO–TiO2 contact layer due to CNTs. The CNTs at the FTO–TiO2 contact were clearly localized as described in the SEM image of SII (Fig. 1). Similarly, the apparent rate of back reaction via substrate (kS/E) increased for cells with SI and SII arrangements and it was highly dominating for the latter. This induced a significant increase in the back reaction rates in the cell and therefore the Voc decay. Furthermore, the contribution of the local density of SFC was more significant than STC. This effect was expected to be even more severe when the cell was operating under light conditions because of the enhanced concentration of triiodide ([I3−]) by accumulation at the vicinity of the conducting substrate as suggested previously.28

Fig. 5 and Table 2 summarize the characteristic J–V curves and corresponding cell parameters for both higher (0.20%) and lower concentrations (0.01%) of CNTs than the optimized level (0.025%) with respect to TiO2. The significant decrease in cell performance on highly concentrated CNTs is generally attributed to the blocking or attenuation of light absorption due to the inherent dark nature of CNTs.16,17

Furthermore, the facilitation of the electron back transfer by the increased contribution of surface states within the photoelectrode was also partly responsible for the decrease of the photocurrent density in addition to the decrease of dye loading sites due to the higher amounts of nanotubes in the mesoporous TiO2 layer (see Table 2).14 Specifically, for SI with 0.2% (w/w) CNTs, a 12% pronounced decrease in the current density was observed along with the additional decrease of Voc up to ca. 40 mV, which was slightly greater than that with the optimized CNT content of 0.025%. The smaller decay of Voc in the SIII arrangement was consistent with the effect of the introduction of the buffer layer observed for cells with 0.025% CNTs. The higher value of current density measured for SIII, compared to SI, at 0.2% CNTs was attributed in part to the relative enhancement of dye loading and light absorption due to the absence of CNTs in the buffer layer.
However, the effect of nanotubes was not very prominent below the optimum CNT level, as shown in Fig. 5b, mostly due to the very low densities of both surface states. The photocurrent enhancement and degree of Voc drop were not as much as those of cells with 0.025% (w/w) CNTs for cells in the SI arrangement with 0.01% CNTs. Furthermore, in contrast to the other two cases, the overall cell efficiency did not increase after use of the buffer layer even though the Voc decay was almost eliminated in the SIII arrangement. This suggested no enhancement of the photocurrent due to the insufficient formation of channels for efficient collection and fast transport of photoelectrons within the TiO2 layer below the optimum level of CNTs. Therefore, it was necessary to optimize the concentration of nanotubes to take advantage of the superior electron collection efficiency while minimizing the attenuation of light absorption by nanotubes. This would be dependent on the overall thickness of the photoanode and ca. 0.025% (w/w with respect to TiO2) was closest to the optimized concentration for electrodes with the TiO2 layer thickness used in this study, ca. 1 μm.

Fig. 6 and Table 3 show J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters for cells with similar design of photoelectrodes with CNTs when the thickness of the CNT–TiO2 layer is significantly increased up to ca. 12 μm. The enhancement of Jsc for the cells with SI and SIII indicated that the incorporation of CNTs is still effective in electron collection under the highly optimized conditions, while no notable current increase for SII. The tendency of Voc decay was also very similar but generally much smaller to hardly characterize quantitatively as in the case with a thin TiO2 layer mostly because the relative contribution of SFC significantly decreased with the thickness of the CNT–TiO2 layer.

In conclusion, it was found that the direct contact of nanotubes with the conducting substrate was mostly the source of back electron transfer to electrolytes via both TiO2 nanoparticles and conducting substrates themselves through these surface states. They were found to be collectively contributing to Voc decay significantly even though the incorporation of carbon nanotubes into the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network was highly advantageous in electron harvesting efficiency due to the superior charge collection and transport properties. It was possible to avoid the intrinsic problem of the open circuit voltage decay, implemented upon incorporation of nanotubes, by the very simple approach of introducing a thin buffer layer of TiO2 to prevent nanotubes from direct contact to FTO while preserving the superior electron collection efficiency simultaneously. Meanwhile, the optimization of the overall amount of nanotubes was required not only to establish an appropriate level of channels for express electron transport but also to minimize the attenuation of light absorption and/or dye loading at higher concentration of nanotubes. This study provides a valuable approach in developing a high performance dye-sensitized solar cell by introducing highly efficient conducting materials, such as carbon nanotubes, for an electron collecting and transporting channel. Furthermore, this approach will offer an important route to provide an optimized condition of CNTs-incorporated TiO2 electrode structure to resolve the intrinsic problems of open circuit voltage decay and low conductivity across a thin TiO2 photoanode, particularly for a flexible application.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of SI, SII, SIII, and reference TiO2 photoelectrodes in 0.5 M LiClO4 dissolved in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The capacitive charging current appearing at negative potential is due to filling of surface states below the conduction band edge of TiO2 for all structures. (b) The exponential distribution of density of states (DOS) was deduced by plotting capacitive charging of electrons into the surface states vs. applied potential.
