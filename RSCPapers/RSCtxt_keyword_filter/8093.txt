    , Accepted 30th March 2020First published on 31st March 2020AbstractBiVO4 has been widely used as a photoanode material, while the slow surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics still severely hinders its performance. Here, an efficient bimetallic cocatalyst (named FeSnOS) was obtained by post-annealing a Fe/Sn-containing metal chalcogenide coordination compound to enhance the OER activity of BiVO4. The synergistic effect of Fe and Sn species in the amorphous FeSnOS cocatalyst efficiently lowers the interface impedance of the photoanode, reduces the electrochemical reaction overpotential, and promotes the surface OER dynamics. At the same time, a type-II heterojunction was constructed due to the process of post-annealing, which efficiently improves the bulk phase charge separation efficiency of the photoanode. The obtained optimal photoanode (named FeSnOS-BiVO4) shows a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 3.4 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode, and its onset potential shifts negatively from 0.44 V to 0.25 V. This work presents a simple and effective method to build a bimetallic cocatalyst for improved photoelectrochemical performance, which extends the application of polymetallic metal chalcogenide complexes.
1. Introduction
Clean and sustainable energy such as hydrogen has received more and more attention, especially in the case of energy crises and environmental pollution in recent years.1–4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been a promising approach for hydrogen production.5,6 Since the process of water oxidation determines the final water splitting efficiency, the preparation and optimization of photoanodes are the core issues in this field.7 Monoclinic BiVO4 possessing a narrow band gap and suitable band position has emerged as a promising metal oxide photoanode material for PEC water splitting.8,9 Nevertheless, it suffers from a small hole transportation depth,10 dull OER kinetics,11 and poor bulk charge separation12 that will hinder it from achieving theoretical efficiency.
Many cocatalysts such as CoP,13–15 NiOOH,16 FeOOH,17,18 black phosphorene,19 and CoOx20 have been extensively developed to deposit on BiVO4 to extract the photo-generated holes from the bulk BiVO4, suppress the recombination of photo-generated carriers, and promote the surface OER kinetics. Bi's group adopted a facile solution impregnation method for growing an ultrathin (2 nm) highly-crystalline β-FeOOH nanolayer, which could significantly facilitate the hole transport, reduce the surface charge recombination, and increase the number of surface active sites.21 However, compared with a single-metal cocatalyst, the synergistic effects between the two metals of a bimetallic cocatalyst not only combine the advantages of different elements, but also interact mutually to achieve higher performance.22–26 In addition, a bimetallic cocatalyst can lead to the exposure of more active sites, and reduce the overpotential as compared to a single-metal cocatalyst.27,28 A large number of bimetallic cocatalysts (NiFe, NiCo) have also been used.29–34 Bian's group designed and fabricated a CoMoO4-coupled BiVO4 (BiVO4/CoMoO4) film as the photoanode for PEC water oxidation.35 The transferred holes induce the formation of Co3+ active sites on CoMoO4 that could synergistically oxidize H2O to molecular O2 with stable activity. At present, most methods for constructing bimetallic cocatalysts are relatively complicated, such as electro-deposition, photo-deposition, pulsed laser deposition, plasma treatment, etc.36,37 There has still been a challenge for constructing an efficient bimetallic cocatalyst on a BiVO4 photoanode by a simple method.
Herein, a metal chalcogenide coordination compound of {[Fe (phen)2]2Sn2S6}·(C12H8N2)·H2O (denoted as FeSnS) was selected as a precursor to fabricate a bimetallic cocatalyst for a BiVO4 photoanode. The dispersion of FeSnS was spin coated on the surface of BiVO4 (denoted as FeSnS-BiVO4), followed by post-annealing at 350 °C in air to form a composite photoanode (denoted as FeSnOS-BiVO4). The amorphous FeSnOS cocatalyst and the O–S bonds were formed in FeSnOS-BiVO4 during the annealing of FeSnS. Meanwhile, the surface of BiVO4 (denoted as Sur-BiVO4) was affected by FeSnS during annealing, leading to an upward Fermi level compared with pristine BiVO4. Therefore, a type-II heterojunction was constructed from Sur-BiVO4 and bare BiVO4 at the bottom, which efficiently improves the bulk phase charge separation efficiency (ηsep.) of the sample. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe and Sn species, the FeSnOS bimetallic cocatalyst effectively reduces the electrochemical reaction overpotential of the interface water splitting, lowers down the electrochemical impedance, and promotes the surface OER kinetics. FeSnOS-BiVO4 shows a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is 3.4 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode.
2. Results and discussion
The fabrication process of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is shown in Scheme 1. Fig. 1a and b show a similar worm-like feature of pristine BiVO4 and FeSnOS-BiVO4, indicating that the surface cocatalyst prepared by this method did not significantly change the morphology of the BiVO4 photoanode. The cross-sectional SEM image of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is shown in Fig. S1.† Fig. S2† displays the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two samples. The surface of pristine BiVO4 is smooth as shown in Fig. S2a,† while FeSnOS-BiVO4 has a rough surface as shown in Fig. S2b,† confirming the decoration of the cocatalyst on the surface of BiVO4. The corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the two samples are shown in Fig. 1c and d. Fig. 1c shows the crystal lattice spacing of 0.312 nm, corresponding to the (103) plane of BiVO4, while Fig. 1d shows a similar (103) plane with a lattice spacing of 0.310 nm. The slight variation in the lattice spacing may be caused by the surface doping during the low temperature annealing process. Meanwhile, there is an amorphous cocatalyst layer with a thickness of about 5 nm on the surface of BiVO4, indicating the existence of FeSnOS. FeSnS was annealed by the same method to further characterize the composition and crystallinity of the surface cocatalyst. As shown in Fig. S3,† the X-ray diffraction (XRD) characteristic peaks of FeSnS disappeared after annealing, indicating that FeSnS was transformed into the amorphous state. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns indicate the clear point shape for pure BiVO4 (inset of Fig. 1c) and the circle shape formed by some points for FeSnOS-BiVO4 (inset of Fig. 1d), verifying that the decoration of FeSnOS obviously lowers the crystallinity of BiVO4. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 1e) and EDS line scanning (Fig. S4†) jointly indicate that the elements Bi, V, O, Fe, Sn, and S are all present and uniformly distributed. Furthermore, the existence of Fe, Sn, and S elements arising from FeSnS manifests that the FeSnOS cocatalyst was prepared on the surface of BiVO4. The XRD patterns of pristine BiVO4, FeSnS-BiVO4, and FeSnOS-BiVO4 are shown in Fig. S5a.† All the typical diffraction peaks could be well indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (PDF # 83–1699)38 and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates with no transparent difference. The Raman spectra of the above two samples are also unchanged as shown in Fig. S6,† illustrating that the decoration of the cocatalyst does not change the crystal structure of BiVO4 owing to the low loading amount. Narrow-scan XRD of BiVO4, FeSnS-BiVO4, and FeSnOS-BiVO4 was conducted as shown in Fig. S5b.† BiVO4 and FeSnS-BiVO4 possess exactly the same half-peak width and peak position at the (112) plane. Notably, the half-peak width of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is slightly widened, proving the worse crystallinity, which is consistent with the SAED results.39 Moreover, the slightly shifted peak position indicates that Sur-BiVO4 was doped during the decoration of FeSnOS.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the surface chemical states of BiVO4 and FeSnOS-BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 2. Compared with pristine BiVO4, FeSnOS-BiVO4 exhibits a positive shift for Bi 4f (separately from 158.97 eV and 164.25 eV to 159.10 eV and 164.38 eV), V 2p (separately from 516.55 and 524.08 eV to 516.75 and 524.28 eV), and O 1s (separately from 529.63 eV and 531.33 eV to 529.78 and 531.48 eV).40 Limited by the XPS detection depth, the peak intensity of Bi, V, and O of FeSnOS-BiVO4 was reduced because of the signal obscured by the FeSnOS cocatalyst layer on the BiVO4 surface. Furthermore, it was found that Fe and Sn elements appear in FeSnOS-BiVO4 as shown in Fig. 2d and e, proving that the surface cocatalyst was successfully constructed. Due to the tiny amount of cocatalyst, a large amount of substrate (BiVO4) will greatly affect the signal of cocatalyst elements. To eliminate the shadow interference of BiVO4, FeSnOS was employed to determine the chemical state of the S element. As shown in Fig. 2f, S 2p peaks at 160.39 eV and 161.69 eV, corresponding to S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, are attributable to S2− in FeSnOS. Meanwhile, a new peak at 167.35 eV is assigned to the O–S bond,41 which is on account of air annealing. It could be jointly confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis that the treatment by low temperature annealing resulted in the formation of an amorphous cocatalyst and the introduction of the O–S bonds, which are beneficial for the OER kinetics. The XPS experiment of the S element in Na2SO4 was also conducted, as shown in Fig. S7.† Unlike the O–S bond, the S in SO42− has two peaks, indicating that the O–S bond does not come from SO42−.

Fig. S8–S10† show the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of FeSnOS-BiVO4 obtained under different treatment conditions, including different anneal temperatures (100 °C, 300 °C, and 500 °C, Fig. S8†), various spin-coating times (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Fig. S9†), and different spin-coating speeds (1000, 2000, and 3000 rpm per s, Fig. S10†). The optimal sample leads to a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 3.4 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode of 0.90 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a). The onset potential (Von) of FeSnOS-BiVO4 shifts negatively to 0.25 V from 0.44 V. Furthermore, to emphasize the advantage of a bimetallic cocatalyst, the monometallic complexes of [Fe(phen)3]2− and [Sn2S6]4− precursors were employed to modify BiVO4 by using the same method of FeSnOS-BiVO4, which led to the formation of two other catalysts (denoted as Fe-BiVO4 and Sn-BiVO4). And their mixture with the atomic ratio of 1:1 was also used to decorate BiVO4 to form (Fe + Sn)-BiVO4. As shown in Fig. S11,† the performances of the samples with two types of metals (FeSnOS-BiVO4 and (Fe + Sn)-BiVO4) are obviously higher than that of the other two samples, demonstrating that the bimetallic cocatalyst is more efficient than the monometallic cocatalyst in improving the PEC activity. Furthermore, the J value of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is also higher than that of (Fe + Sn)-BiVO4, suggesting that the metal pre-integration of FeSnS is beneficial for the performance of PEC water splitting compared to the mechanical mixing of two metals. There is no clear difference between the UV-visible spectra of pristine BiVO4 and FeSnOS-BiVO4 as shown in Fig. S12.† The band gaps of the two samples from the Tauc plot (inset in Fig. S12†) are both 2.54 eV, which indicates that the improved PEC performance is irrelevant to the promotion of light absorption ability. The improved incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) further demonstrate the enhanced PEC activity as shown in Fig. S13.† To demonstrate the role of FeSnOS as a superior cocatalyst for improving the PEC performance of BiVO4, the double-layer capacitance (Cdls) was measured to determine the electrochemical surface area (ECSA).42,43 Fig. S14a and S14b† show the cyclic voltammograms in the non-faradaic region (1 V–1.1 V vs. RHE) with different scan rates (0.01–0.15 V s−1). Fig. 3b shows that the Cdls of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is greater than that of pristine BiVO4. The more positive slope manifests more active sites. Therefore, FeSnOS-BiVO4 provides more surface active sites and more reaction area than pristine BiVO4. Furthermore, the reaction dynamics at the interface of the electrode surface and electrolyte was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. 3c, the inset is the fitting circuit. The smaller semicircle diameter indicates a smaller electrochemical impedance, suggesting that FeSnOS-BiVO4 has excellent interfacial charge transfer capability.

The J–V curves tested in an electrolyte containing 0.5 M Na2SO3, which is used as a hole scavenger, are shown in Fig. S15.† The charge injection efficiency (ηinj.)44 was measured under simulated solar light illumination to investigate the effect of the FeSnOS cocatalyst as shown in Fig. 3d. The ηinj. of the as-prepared FeSnOS-BiVO4 is significantly enhanced as compared with pristine BiVO4, which is ascribed to the decoration of the FeSnOS cocatalyst on the surface of BiVO4. The modification of FeSnOS boosts the transmission capability of photo-generated holes on the interface and lowers the transport resistance of the photoanode. The FeSnOS–BiVO4 photoanode exhibits high activity, especially in the low voltage region. It solidly elucidates that the decorated cocatalyst efficiently lowers the interface transmission impedance, increases the amounts of reactive sites, and accelerates the OER kinetics on the surface of the photoanode, thus enhancing the PEC performance of BiVO4. As shown in Fig. 3e, the ηsep.44 of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is improved. To investigate the reasons for the improved ηsep., the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of pristine BiVO4 and FeSnOS–BiVO4 was conducted, as shown in Fig. S16a andS16b,† respectively. The band positions of the bottom BiVO4 and Sur-BiVO4 are shown in Fig. 3f. The upward of the band position of Sur-BiVO4 is due to the surface decoration by FeSnOS. When FeSnOS–BiVO4 was treated at low temperature, some elements (Fe, Sn, or S) may be doped into BiVO4, leading to the changed band position of Sur-BiVO4, while the bottom BiVO4 does not change. Thus Sur-BiVO4 has constructed a type-II heterojunction with the bottom BiVO4, leading to the fast separation and reduced recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs.45
To explore the surface kinetics with a multi-step charge transfer reaction, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) kinetic analysis was conducted.46 The surface charge-transfer efficiency (ηct) can be calculated according to the following equation:ηct = Ktran/(Ktran + Krec)where Ktran and Krec separately denoted the surface charge-transfer and recombination rate constants. Fig. S17† and Fig. 4a display the IMPS complex curves of pristine BiVO4 and FeSnOS-BiVO4 photoanodes at different applied potentials under λ = 365 nm irradiation, respectively. ηct could be obtained from the intercept ratio of the photocurrents between the intercept of low-frequency and high-frequency, while (Ktran + Krec) can also be determined. Fig. 4b shows that the ηct of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is higher than that of pristine BiVO4 at different potentials. The Ktran and Krec rate constants are also shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The Ktran of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is larger than that of pristine BiVO4, while the Krec of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is not clearly lower than that of pristine BiVO4 across the entire voltage range. These suggest that the FeSnOS cocatalyst mainly improves the charge transfer of photo-generated carriers, but not obviously reduces the interface recombination.

Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis can provide the information about the charge concentrations according to the following equation:471/C2 = (2/e0εε0NDA2) [(V − VFB) − κT/e0]where C is the specific capacity, ε is the dielectric constant of the photoanode, ε0 is the electric permittivity of vacuum, ND is the carrier density, A is the area, VFB is the flat band potential, V is the applied potential, κ is the Boltzmann constant, e0 is the electron charge, and T is the absolute temperature. The carrier density is inversely proportional to the slope. Clearly, the carrier concentration of FeSnOS-BiVO4 is increased as shown in Fig. S18.† Moreover, its flat band potential is also lower than that of pristine BiVO4, which is basically consistent with the trend of Von. This indicates that during the preparation of the FeSnOS cocatalyst by low-temperature treatment, BiVO4 was also partially doped. The doping of BiVO4 leads to an increase of photo-generated carrier concentration, the upward of the band position, and the improved bulk ηsep. of the photoanode.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we employed a metal chalcogenide coordination compound to fabricate an efficient cocatalyst (FeSnOS) to promote the PEC performance of the BiVO4 photoanode. Due to the synergistic effect of Fe and Sn species, the FeSnOS cocatalyst reduces the OER barrier, accelerates the surface kinetics, and lowers the interfacial electrochemical impedance. Furthermore, owing to the surface doping during the post-annealing, the band position of Sur-BiVO4 is moving up, which could further construct a type-II band alignment with the bottom pristine BiVO4. As a result, it improves the bulk phase ηsep. of BiVO4, reduces the bulk phase charge recombination, and further increases the concentration of photo-generated charge carriers, which lead to an optimized photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. This work provides a new idea for constructing cocatalysts for BiVO4, and lays the foundation for the application of more multi-metal chalcogenide coordination complexes.
4. Experimental section
Synthesis of BiVO4
BiVO4 was fabricated according to the literature.48 KI (0.996 g), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.294 g), and p-benzoquinone (0.149 g) were dissolved with deionized water (15 mL) and absolute ethanol (6 mL) and HNO3 (0.02 mL). Electrodeposition was conducted on an electrochemical workstation in a tri-electrode cell with a working electrode (FTO substrate), counter electrode (Pt foil), and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) to fabricate BiOI48 at −0.1 V for 180 s. After that, DMSO (10 mL) was used to dissolve VO(acac)2 (0.5304 g), and then 200 μL of the above solution was added dropwise onto the as-fabricated BiOI film. The film was heated at 450 °C for 2 h and the excess V2O5 was removed by dipping it into 1 M NaOH solution for 20 min and washed with distilled water.
Synthesis of FeSnOS-BiVO4
FeSnS was synthesized according to the literature.49 A dispersion containing 15 mg FeSnS, 4 mL H2O, and 2 mL EtOH was obtained after stirring for 8 h. Then, 100 μL of the above dispersion was taken and added dropwise onto the surface of the BiVO4 film, with the spin coating speed rate of 1000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the film was annealed at 350 °C in air for 3 h to obtain FeSnOS-BiVO4.
Material characterization
The morphology of the prepared photoanodes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010, Japan). High-resolution TEM was conducted on an FEI Tecnai G20 S-TWIN TMP, FEI, USA. The phase and the purity of all the samples were determined by XRD (D2 PHASER, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54056 Å; Bruker). Raman spectra were recorded on a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer (HR800, France HORIBA Jobin Yvon). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an SSIS-Probe XPS system with a concentric hemispherical analyzer and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The energy band of the samples was evaluated by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The distribution of the elements was conducted by using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) under a TEM with an annular dark-field (ADF) detector. UV-VIS (SHIMADZU UV-3150) was used to identify the optical properties of all photoanodes.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
A three-electrode system was conducted to estimate the electrochemical and PEC performance of the as-fabricated samples using an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT 302N, Autolab, Switzerland), in which the as-fabricated photoanodes, saturated Ag/AgCl electrode, and Pt mesh acted as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. The measured potential versus Ag/AgCl was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale referred to the Nernst equation:44  where EAg/AgCl represents the measured experimental potential versus Ag/AgCl reference and  = 0.1976 V at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained with the frequency varying from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at an open-circuit voltage under light illumination. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were recorded at an AC frequency of 1.0 kHz with an amplitude of 0.01 V in the dark.
Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at the scan rate of 0.01 V s−1, 0.03 V s−1, 0.05 V s−1, 0.07 V s−1, and 0.09 V s−1 in a non-faradaic region (0.85 V vs. RHE, plotted as a function of scan rate).
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated using the following equation:  where VRHE represents the working electrode potential (versus the RHE), Jdark and Jlight represent the measured current density in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination, separately, and Psunlight represents the incident light power (100 mW cm−2).
During the determination of the injection efficiency (ηinj.) and charge separation efficiency (ηsep.), we employed Na2SO3 electrolyte as the hole scavenger. The hole collection efficiency is 100% under this circumstance. ηinj. may possibly be estimated through calculating the photocurrent ratio measured without/with Na2SO3. ηsep. is the value of the photocurrent density measured with Na2SO3 divided by the light absorption efficiency. Here, ηsep. represents the proportion of the electrode/electrolyte interface photo-generated holes, while ηinj. represents the proportion of those holes at the photoanode/electrolyte interface for water oxidation:44    where Jmax represents the maximum photocurrent density that is achievable for BiVO4 (6.47 mA cm−2), and JH2O and JNa2SO3 represent the photocurrent density tested in 0.5 M Na2SO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO3, respectively.
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) kinetic analysis was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CIMPS, Zennium Zahner) in a three-electrode system as that of the PEC measurements. The irradiation source is a LED (s/n Ls 1272, Zennium Zahner) with 365 nm wavelength, and the power intensity is 45 W m−2. The frequency range is 3 kHz–0.1 Hz, and the ±5% modulation intensity is around 45 W m−2. A Nyquist plot was used to get the rate constants of the surface charge-transfer and recombination (imaginary vs. real components of the normalized photocurrent, IIM vs. IRE).50
