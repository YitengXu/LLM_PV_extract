    , Accepted 15th July 2019First published on 16th July 2019AbstractOrganic solar cells based on small organic molecules have some unique advantages. Non-planar small-molecule boron subphthalocyanine chloride, one of the promising materials of organic solar cells, has attracted global researchers. The axial substitutions of subphthalocyanine show noticeable influences on their photoelectrical properties. In this paper, we systematically study the effects of axial halogen (F, Cl, Br) substitutions of chlorine atoms on the optical and physical properties of subphthalocyanine/C60 solar cells by combining a DFT/TDDFT study and the available experimental data of X-subPC/C60 (X = F, Cl) solar cells. Two favorable configurations (umbrella/bed: C60 in/on the concave/convex of subphthalocyanine, respectively) at the heterointerface of the solar cell are modeled. By utilizing long range corrected density functionals and the polarizable continuum model, we find that the wavelengths of the absorption peaks and the calculated open circuit voltages of the subphthalocyanine/C60 series slightly increase from fluorine to chlorine to bromine substitution. The latter has the same trend as the calculated first charge transfer states of TDDFT. Furthermore, interestingly, the computed data demonstrate that both F-BsubPC/C60 configurations have the smallest exciton binding energy among these bi-molecular systems, though the exciton binding energy of the F-BsubPC monomer is larger than that of X-BsubPC (X = Cl, Br).
Introduction
Boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl-BsubPC), first synthesized by Meller and Ossko in 1972,1 is a very attractive organic solar cell (OSC) donor material due to its superior properties such as a wide absorption range (460–580 nm),2–4 higher solubility (compared to phthalocyanines),5 and high hole mobility.6 Specifically, its non-planar bowl structure makes it an appropriate donor combined with a fullerene acceptor.3–5,7,8
To date, X-BsubPC/C60 solar cells (X = F, Cl), specifically, Cl-BsubPC/C60, have been studied quite comprehensively by experimental/computational physicists and chemists. For example, Mutolo et al. first fabricated a Cl-BsubPC/C60-based device with high open circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to CuPC/C60 solar cells;9 Huang et al. claimed that the performance of the Cl-BsubPC/C60 device can be improved by inserting a MoO3 buffer layer;10 Jin et al. studied the interface engineering of organic Schottky barrier solar cells by analysing Cl-BsubPC/C60 and other solar cells;11 Lin et al. manufactured a Cl-BsubPC/C60 planar heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) device with both high Voc and high efficiency by adding a donor buffer layer;12 Morris et al. analysed the performance of the F-BsubPC/C60 device and found that the axial fluorine substitution of chlorine results in a smaller Voc using both experimental and computational methods;13 Wilcox et al. calculated the interfacial charge transfer rate of Cl-BsubPC/C60 using density functional theory (DFT) and Marcus theory.14 Rhoda et al. analysed the electron structure of Cl-BsubPC/C60 based on experimental and density functional theory;15 Cabaleiro-Lago et al. studied the bi-molecular system of Cl-BsubPC/C60 (C60 in the concave of Cl-BsubPC) using density functional theory.16
Despite the exciting progress, a systematic study of X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) solar cells is still missing, specifically, no experimental and computational exploration of Br-BsubPC/C60 solar cells yet exists. Furthermore, axial atomic halogen substitution of boron subphthalocyanine has one exceptional benefit: it does not introduce complicated substitutional functional groups, and allows changing the properties of BsubPC without affecting the electronic properties of the macrocycle made by isoindole rings much.8,17,18 In addition, the axial substitutions will influence molecular packing and arrangements, dipole moments, open circuit voltages, absorption spectra, and therefore charge transfer properties and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Thus, in this paper, we concentrate on the effects of axial halogen substitution on the performance of these solar cells.
In the present work, utilizing traditional and long range corrected (LRC) DFT and time dependent DFT,19–22 we investigate the effects of different halogen axial substitutions on the geometry and the electronic structures of the ground state and excited states of X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) bi-molecular systems at the heterointerface. We systematically explore their geometry parameters and photoelectric properties including binding energy, electronic structures, open circuit voltage (Voc), absorption spectra, and exciton binding energy, and provide comparisons between experiment and computations, and finally present conclusions.
Computational details
Considering the importance of environmental effects on X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) bi-molecular systems in the solid state (thin film),23,24 the polarizable continuum model (PCM)25,26 was applied in all our calculations. The relative dielectric constant ε = 3.0,27,28 which is appropriate for organic solar cell materials, was chosen. All of the monomers were optimized using the B3LYP functional (Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional).29 To obtain correct bi-molecular structures, GD3 (Grimme's dispersion with the original D3 damping functional)30 was used. Meanwhile, the 6-31G(D) basis set was selected for all atoms in this work.31
There are two favourable configurations of X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems after geometry optimizations, as shown in Fig. 1. They are named umbrella (C60 in the concave) and bed (C60 on the convex).

To explore the binding force in these bi-molecular systems and the effect of halogen axial substitution, we calculated the binding energy and measured intermolecular distances. The binding energy was calculated using the following equation: Ebinding = EAB − EA − EB(1)where EAB is the energy of X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems; EA and EB represent the monomer energy of X-BsubPC or C60. The basis set superposition error (BSSE) of X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems was calculated in the gas phase (see Table S1, ESI†).
To calculate the open circuit voltages (Voc) in the solid state, we used the following equations32,33 (2) εPCMHOMO,D = εgasHOMO,D + [IPD,gas − IPD,PCM](3) εPCMLUMO,A = εgasLUMO,A + [EAA,gas − EAA,PCM](4) (5)where Voc is the open circuit voltage in the solid state; e is the electron charge; εHOMO and εLUMO mean the energy of the frontier orbitals of X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems; IPD and EAA denote the ionization potential of the donor and the electron affinity of the acceptor respectively; ε is the relative dielectric constant and set at 3.0 in our calculations; DS and DGC are the shortest atomic distance between two separate fragments and the distance between the geometry centers of two separate fragments, respectively; Dave is the arithmatic average distance of DS and DGC. Previous studies have shown that the methods of calculating Voc in the solid state, used here, are quite reliable. For more details, please see ref. 24, 32, and 33.
To calculate the exciton binding energy of monomers and X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems in the solid state, we used the following equations34 Eb = Efund − Eopt(6) Efund = IP − EA(7) IP = EPCMN−1 − EPCMN(8) EA = EPCMN − EPCMN+1(9)where Eb is the exciton binding energy; Efund and Eopt are the fundamental gap and the optical gap, respectively; EPCMN is the energy of neutral molecular with PCM; EPCMN−1 and EPCMN+1 are the energy of the positive and negative molecular with PCM, respectively; IP and EA are the ionization potential and the electron affinity, respectively.
Regarding the wavelength of the simulated absorption peaks, we used following equation: (10)where OSn is the oscillator strength of the nth excited state and λn is the corresponding wavelength. The subscript n means the nth excited state of the TDDFT results which belong to the same band.
To obtain the meaningful frontier orbital energies and excited states, we used the following long-range corrected (LRC) functionals in DFT and TDDFT calculations:
(1) CAM-B3LYP22
(2) ωB97XD35
(3) LC-ωPBE21
which provide ways to overcome the problems of derivative discontinuities and the electronic self-interaction error of conventional DFT.36,37
To obtain the surface area (van der Waals surface area) of both X-BsubPC/C60 configurations, the B3LYP/6-31G(D) theory level was selected for gas phase calculations based on optimized structures with the PCM, and the electron density of the equivalent surface was set at 0.001. The surface area is constructed with the van der Waals sphere of the respective atom of molecules.38
All computations were executed with the Gaussian 09 Rev E.01 version software package.39 Frontier molecular orbitals were drawn using the GaussView software package,40 where the iso-surface value was set at 0.03 a.u. We also used the MultiWFN software package to generate electronic absorption spectra and obtain the surface areas (van der Waals surface area).41
For comparison, all gas phase results are available in Fig. S1, S2 and Tables S1, S2, S5–S7 (ESI†).
Results and discussion
In this section, we present the calculated properties of both X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) umbrella and bed configurations, including geometry parameters, binding energy, frontier molecular orbitals, open circuit voltage, charge transfer state, and absorption spectra.
Geometry parameters and binding energy of X-BsubPC/C60
In Fig. 2(b) and Table S2 (ESI†), we present the binding energy of X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) umbrella and bed configurations. In addition, we present the intermolecular distance of X-BsubPC/C60 in Fig. 2(b). On the one hand, the binding energy (103.63, 102.96, 102.92 kJ mol−1) of U configurations is about two times larger than that of B configurations (47.13, 45.04, 57.03 kJ mol−1), respectively. This can be attributed to the difference in geometry parameters between two fragments: the U configurations have much shorter DGC/DAve than B configurations, and thus have a larger binding energy. On the other hand, due to the different halogen substitutions, the variation of binding energy in B configurations is much larger (11.99 kJ mol−1) than that (0.71 kJ mol−1) in U ones. This discrepancy can be explained by the difference between the induced dipole moments of C60 in umbrella and bed configurations. From F to Cl to Br, the dipole moment and B–X bond length of the X-BsubPC monomer increase, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). But the Mulliken charge of the X atom does not always increase. The chlorine atom has slightly less negative charge than the fluorine atom. The different halogen atoms have a stronger influence on binding energy in B configurations because the negative halogen atoms are closer to C60 in B configurations than those in U ones. In addition, as we can see in the Table S3 (ESI†), the distance between X atoms and C60 is different: the bromine atom is closer to C60 than the chlorine atom. Consequently, in B configurations, Br-BsubPC/C60 has the largest binding energy. Finally, with the BSSE corrections obtained in the gas phase, the binding energy of both configurations always increases from F to Cl to Br substitution (see Table S1, ESI†).

(b) The intermolecular distance of X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) bi-molecular systems by with eqn (5), X(U)/X(B) means the X-BsubPC/C60 umbrella/bed configuration, respectively. 
Frontier molecular orbitals of X-BsubPC/C60
Here, we present the calculated HOMO, LUMO, and gap energy of X-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations obtained with three LRC functionals, as shown in Fig. 3, Table 1 and Table S4 (ESI†). One can see that the HOMO/LUMO/gap energy of umbrella configurations is lower than those of bed ones, respectively. Besides, the energy gaps increase slowly from F to Cl to Br substitutions in both B and U configurations in all three functionals. This can be attributed to the energy drop of the HOMOs of X-BsubPC monomers from F to Cl to Br substitutions, as shown in Table 1, since the LUMO/HOMO of X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems is similar to that of the C60/X-BsubPC monomer, respectively. Last but not least, compared to the data of ωB97XD and LC-ωPBE, the CAM-B3LYP results have a higher/lower HOMO/LUMO, respectively, and therefore predict a smaller energy gap.

Next, in Fig. 4, we analyze the energy differences of frontier molecular orbitals between each X-BsubPC/C60 bimolecular system and monomer X-BsubPC or C60. The HOMO/LUMO energy difference equals (EHOMO,X-BsubPC/C60 − EHOMO,X-BsubPC)/(ELUMO,X-BsubPC/C60 − ELUMO,C60), respectively. Overall, we can see that most of the orbital energy differences are quite small (<0.05 eV), except for the LUMO ones of the B configuration (>0.1 eV), and the results obtained with different LRC density functionals show the same trend. Moreover, the axial halogen substitutions seem to have small effects on the HOMO energy of both B and U configurations, and in contrast to this, the fluctuations of the LUMO energy differences due to halogen substitution are noticeable (about 0.05 eV). This can be interpreted with much smaller distances between X atoms and C60 in the B configurations (see Table S3, ESI†). The schematic representation of the frontier molecular orbitals is available in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

 Fig. 6  The calculated Voc of X-BsubPC/C60 configurations using eqn (2), and the energy of charge transfer states obtained with LRC LC-ωPBE, ωB97XD, and CAM-B3LYP TDDFT calculations with the PCM. Color code: blue-ωB97XD, orange-LC-ωPBE, and grey-CAM-B3LYP. 
First, in Fig. 6, the trends of Vocs and the CT state energies of both X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) U and B configurations, obtained with three LRC functionals, are exactly the same. The reason is that the calculations of Vocs involve the energy difference between the HOMO of X-BsubPC and the LUMO of C60, and the charge transfer state energy is also mainly determined by the energy difference. Furthermore, we can see that from F to Cl to Br substitution, the Vocs and the energies of the CT states of X-BsubPC B or U configurations slightly increase because of the slight increase of the energy gap of the X-BsubPC/C60 configuration from F, Cl, and Br substitution (see Table S4, ESI†). Besides, we find that each B configuration generally has a larger value of Voc and the CT state energy by at least 0.3 eV than the U one. This finding is consistent with the previous study of Cl-BsubPC/C70 solar cells.24 Therefore, one may conclude that both the Voc and the CT state energies are significantly influenced by different configurations, which can be mainly attributed to the different pathways of electron transfer between the X-BsubPC and C60 in both B and U configurations. As we can see in Fig. 2a, since we choose Dave (the average of DS and DGC) as the length of the electron pathway, in the B configuration which is much longer than that in the U ones, both the Voc and the CT state energies are larger in the B configurations than those in the U ones.
One may note that the ωB97XD and LC-ωPBE Vocs and CT energy results are noticeably larger than those in CAM-B3LYP ones. We think there are two reasons: (1) the energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO energies of ωB97XD and LC-ωPBE density functionals are much larger than those of CAM-B3LYP; (2) the exchange–correlation kernel of CAM-B3LYP only includes 19% HF at short range and 65% HF at long range, which is quite different from ωB97XD and LC-ωPBE kernels.21,22,35 Generally, the more HF exchange included in the density functional, the higher the excited state energy in the TDDFT results.
Next, in Table 2, we compare the calculated Vocs with the available experimental data (X-BsubPC/C60 solar cells, X = F and Cl). Generally, the Voc differences between the calculated results of B configurations and the experiment are larger than those between the ones of U configurations and the experiment. Thus, the Vocs of U configurations match better with the experimental results than those of B configurations in the results of all three LRC functionals. This implies that the U configuration may be more common in these organic solar cells. Furthermore, all calculated Vocs obtained with LRC functionals are overestimated with respect to the available experimental data. However, the Vocs of X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl) U configurations, obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional, are the closest to the experiment, and the deviation is only 0.17 V. (In Table S8 (ESI†), we list the experimental Vocs of F-BsubPC/C60 and Cl-BsubPC/C60, which are 1.00 ± 0.019 V and 1.06 ± 0.002 V measured under the same conditions, respectively.) Lastly, the calculated Vocs with all three LRC functionals show the same trend as the experimental data; that is, the open circuit voltage of F-BsubPC/C60 is less than that of Cl-BsubPC/C60. We therefore can deduce that Br-BsubPC/C60 (no experimental results yet) has a slightly higher Voc than X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl) solar cells.
Absorption spectra of X-BsubPC/C60
In this section, for clarity and simplification, we only show the simulated absorption spectra of F-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations, as depicted in Fig. 7. Other simulated spectra results are available in Fig. S4–S6 (ESI†). Generally, from monomer to U to B configurations of each halogen substitution, the surface area and the oscillator strength always show the same trend. But for the wavelength of the absorption peak, the trends are quite different, in which for F substitution it always increases, and for Cl and Br substitutions it increases firstly and then drops.
 Fig. 7  The simulated electronic absorption spectra of F-BsubPC/C60 B and U configurations and the F-BsubPC monomer obtained with the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G*/PCM level. OS: oscillator strength and SA: surface area. 
For both F-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations, there are weaker absorption strength and noticeable red-shifts of absorption peaks (about 10/30 nm in the visible/ultraviolet region, respectively) with respect to the monomer F-BsubPC. These red-shifts could be attributed to the interplay between the frontier molecular orbitals of BsubPC and C60, which lowers the fundamental energy gap (see Fig. 3 and Table S4, ESI†).
Next, the F-BsubPC monomer and both F-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations each have stronger oscillator strength in the ultraviolet region than that in the visible region. However, in the ultraviolet region, the oscillator strength becomes much lower in both F-BsubPC/C60 configurations with respect to the F-BsubPC monomer. Besides, the oscillator strength of the U configuration is noticeably weaker than that of the B one (0.4453 versus 0.6403) in the visible region, which is consistent with the previous study of Cl-BsubPC/C70.24
In addition, we also list the surface areas (SAs) of all X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) bi-molecular systems and absorption strength, as shown in Fig. 7 and Tables S9 and S10 (ESI†). The surface area is important because the larger SA means more contact with surrounding molecules and more photon absorption. Note that the B configurations always have larger SAs than the U ones. It seems that the larger the SA, the larger the electric transition dipole moment (see Tables S9 and S11, ESI†). Therefore, we may conclude that the larger the surface area, the stronger the oscillator strength for the different configurations of the same X-BsubPC/C60. In contrast, for the same U or B configurations, in the order from F to Cl and Br substitution, the oscillator strength becomes smaller towards the larger surface area of X-BsubPC/C60.
Finally, in Fig. 8 and Table S10 (ESI†), we present the total absorption strength and λaves of both X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) U and B configurations with three LRC functionals. Firstly, the total oscillator strength of B configurations is always stronger (by at least 0.14) than that of U ones. Moreover, in the sequence F, Cl, and Br substitutions, λaves increase slightly in both X-BsubPC/C60 B and U configurations and this trend is the same as the X-BsubPC monomers. However, for the total oscillator strength, the situation is a little different: from F to Cl to Br substitutions, for B configurations, it increases slightly first, then drops, whereas the absorption strength always decreases slightly in U configurations. Last but not least, one can see the trend of the results obtained with all three functionals being the same. (In Table S12 (ESI†), we also list all excited states in the visible region calculated with three LRC functionals.)

Exciton binding energy
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is one of the important parameters of charge separation and determines the performance of organic photovoltaic materials. Hence, we provide the calculated Ebs of X-BsubPC monomers and X-BsubPC/C60 (X = F, Cl, Br) bi-molecular systems. We only list the data obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional in Fig. 9 and Table 3 since this functional could reproduce the energy of experimental Vocs well, as mentioned in the previous sections.

In the order from F to Cl to Br substitution, the exciton binding energies of X-BsubPC monomers drop first, and then increase, whereas Ebs of both X-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations always increases. Therefore we may conclude that the introduction of C60 is able to reduce the exciton binding energy because both X-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations have a smaller Ebs than that of the monomer of X-BsubPC, which can be attributed to the smaller EA of C60 with respect to X-BsubPC. Furthermore, each B configuration has a smaller Ebs than the U ones due to the larger optical gaps, as shown in Table 3.
One may realize that both F-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations have the smallest exciton binding energy among these bi-molecular systems, although the Eb of the F-BsubPC monomer is the largest among these monomers. We think that the reason is due to the smallest fundamental gaps of F-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems among three halogen substitutions. However, the differences in the exciton binding energy between F substitution and others are less than 0.1 eV. According to the experimental results, the F-BsubPC/C60 solar cell has a smaller Jsc and power conversion efficiency than the Cl-BsubPC/C60 one. Besides, compared to both Cl-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations, the two fragments of the F-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular system are closer (see Fig. 2). We therefore think that the rates of charge recombination of F-BsubPC/C60 in both configurations may be much larger than those of Cl-BsubPC/C60 ones, or such a small exciton binding energy difference may not be important. We are working on the next project to predict the charge transfer and the charge recombination rate constants of this series and hopefully to answer this question in the future.
Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the effects of axial fluorine and bromine substitutions of chloride on the optical and physical properties of both X-BsubPC/C60 B and U configurations by combining a DFT/TDDFT study and experimental data. We find that the open circuit voltages of X-BSubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems slightly increase from F to Cl to Br axial substitution, which is the same trend as the calculated TDDFT charge transfer states. The calculated results also suggest that the long range corrected functional CAM-B3LYP is able to reproduce the experimental Voc quite well.
We further calculate the exciton binding energy of X-BsubPC monomers and X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems. The computed data demonstrate that X-BsubPC (X = Cl, Br) has the smallest and second smallest binding energy among these monomers, respectively. However, we find that the exciton binding energies of both F-BsubPC/C60 U and B configurations have the smallest exciton binding energy among these bi-molecular systems.
This work suggests a new way to fine-tune the donor materials based on BsubPC molecules through axial halogen substitutions.
In the future work, we plan to calculate the charge transfer and recombination rates in these X-BsubPC/C60 bi-molecular systems using Marcus theory.
