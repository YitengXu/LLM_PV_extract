    , Accepted 4th January 2021First published on 5th January 2021AbstractTwo new indacenodithienothiophene–naphthalene diimide polymer acceptors PIN-1 and PIN-2 are rationally designed by two side-chain design strategies (SE-2 and SE-3) and are synthesized by the direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation (DHAP) method. Their physicochemical properties are investigated. Both polymers have similar narrow bandgaps and electron energy levels, which match well with the wide bandgap polymer donor PBZ-C6. The all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) based on the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blend and the PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blend display power conversion efficiencies of 5.81% and 5.00%, respectively. The results indicate that SE-2 and SE-3 are two promising side-chain design strategies and DHAP is an alternative method for obtaining efficient naphthalene diimide polymer acceptors for all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), employing polymeric donors and acceptors in the photovoltaic active layer, have attracted great attention in recent years.1,2 Polymer donors have been widely studied and rapidly developed in the field of fullerene-based solar cells, and they have also been extended to the field of non-fullerene-based solar cells with great success.3–7 However, efficient polymer acceptors, whether discussing the number of types or the quantity, are much less studied than polymer donors.8–11 The design of efficient polymer acceptors for all-PSCs is still an important and challenging issue in the organic photovoltaic field.1,2,12,13 On account of the electron-withdrawing nature of acceptors, developing strong electron-deficient unit based polymers becomes a new research hotspot.14–17 Among them, naphthalene diimide (NDI) polymers are promising due to their appealing properties including photochemical stability and tunable electronic structures and properties.18–21
Various design strategies have been used in designing NDI-based polymer acceptors (see Fig. 1). The first method is main-chain engineering. A lot of electron-rich donor units have been directly introduced into conjugated backbones to obtain a donor–acceptor type of NDI polymer (ME-1 in Fig. 1).22–27 A typical example is N2200, a commercial high-performance polymer acceptor, whose all-PSCs can show high efficiencies of 5–11%.28–30 The introduction of electron-deficient acceptor units into NDI conjugated backbones for building the acceptor–acceptor type of NDI polymers has also been reported (ME-1 in Fig. 1).31–34 Tuning the conjugated NDI core by fusing heterocyclic rings is another route (ME-2 in Fig. 1).35,36 An extended route is developing NDI random terpolymers (ME-3 and ME-4 in Fig. 1).37–42 The second method is side-chain engineering. A typical route is to optimize the symmetrical side chains of the NDI conjugated cores for the resulting co-polymers (SE-1 in Fig. 1).43–46 Another alternative route in this engineering is combining it and a random copolymerization strategy for NDI terpolymers, whose conjugated backbones maintain the binary alternating forms (SE-2 in Fig. 1).47–49 It is a simple and efficient strategy to improve the photovoltaic performances of polymer acceptors in all-PSCs. For example, Huang et al. reported that all-PSCs based on a 2,2′-bithiophene-NDI random terpolymer acceptor containing 10% content of linear oligoethylene oxide side-chains displayed an impressive PCE of 8.1% with very good device stability.48 The NDI polymer acceptors with asymmetrical side chains are also noteworthy for researchers.50 Obviously, the SE-2 type of NDI polymer acceptors have identical conjugated main chains to their SE-3 counterparts. We are interested in the work that involves simultaneous introduction of two different side chains into NDI conjugated backbones to construct the two types of NDI polymer acceptors mentioned above.

We therefore compared the NDI polymer acceptors, which were designed by two side-chain design strategies, SE-2 and SE-3. A known donor unit, indacenodithienothiophene, was utilized to build the conjugated backbones considering that its advantages of a planar conjugated skeleton, high solubility and peripheral tetrahexylphenyl units could contribute to suppress molecular self-aggregation.12,32 Importantly, how to synthesize NDI polymer acceptors is also an important issue. Most high-performance NDI polymer acceptors (PCE >5%) had been prepared by traditional Stille polycondensations (see Table S1 and Fig. S1, ESI†), which are low atom economy and not an eco-friendly method because of toxic waste by-products formed during the reactions. Instead, direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation (DHAP) is a relatively preferred method.51–56 Therefore, the target indacenodithienothiophene–naphthalene diimide polymer acceptors, PIN-1 and PIN-2 (Fig. 2), were synthesized by DHAP methods. Their physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance were compared.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic routes for the target polymers, PIN-1 and PIN-2, are displayed in Scheme 1. They were synthesized by DHAP methods with IDT and relevant NDI units in good yields (see the ESI†). Both polymer solutions were green and their films show a metallic luster. The molecular structures of the polymers were confirmed via1H NMR (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). Both polymers were easily soluble in chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene. The molecular weight information of PIN-1 and PIN-2 was collected by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PIN-1 and PIN-2 were estimated to be 12.4 and 77.9 kDa, with PDIs of 1.67 and 2.66, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). Obviously, PIN-2 had a much higher molecular weight than PIN-1. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), both polymers displayed high thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of over 450 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†). This might be due to the polymers’ rigid conjugated structures, which consist of fused heterocyclic units.

 Fig. 3  Thin-film absorption spectra of the polymer acceptors and donor. 
The optical properties of PIN-1 and PIN-2 were investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The solution and thin-film absorption spectra of PIN-1 and PIN-2 are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and Fig. 3. The relevant data are collected in Table 1. Both polymers showed two absorption bands, a high-energy absorption band (300–450 nm) and a low-energy absorption band (550–850 nm). The former could be attributed to the π–π* transition and the latter could be accounted for the intramolecular charge transfer absorption. In the visible region, the maximum absorption peak of each polymer film generated a bathochromic shift of ∼10 nm in comparison with that of each corresponding polymer solution (Fig. S8, ESI†). Both polymer films had very weak absorption in the range of 450–600 nm, which was in agreement with their colors. Generally, an ideal photovoltaic active layer requires absorbing visible light to the greatest extent. Owing to the use of PIN-1 and PIN-2 for photovoltaic acceptor materials, some photovoltaic donor materials, which could display strong absorption in the range of 450–600 nm, were needed. As shown in Fig. 1, the donor PBZ-C6 (its chemical structure had been presented in Fig. S9, ESI†), is eligible for realizing nearly total absorption of visible light together with PIN-1 or PIN-2.

The electron energy levels of the PIN-1 and PIN-2 thin films were evaluated via cyclic voltammetry. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (ELUMO) of both PIN-1 and PIN-2 thin films were estimated to be −3.84 eV (Table 1) according to their respective onset reductions (Ered) (Fig. 4a). Both polymers also had similar highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels (EHOMO) (Table 1), which were estimated from their respective onset oxidations (Eox) (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b displays the energy level diagram of the new acceptors (PIN-1 and PIN-2), and the donor PBZ-C6. The LUMO energy level differences between the donor PBZ-C6 and acceptors (PIN-1 and PIN-2) were both 0.42 eV. The HOMO energy level differences between PBZ-C and acceptors were both over 0.20 eV. This indicated that the new acceptors and donor PBZ-C6 possessed matching electron energy levels.

To compare the photovoltaic properties of both polymers, the all-PSCs were constructed with a frequently-used configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (the blends of PBZ-C6 (D) and the new acceptor(A))/PFN-Br/Ag (see the ESI†). PBZ-C6 is a two-dimensional-conjugated polymer containing bithienylbenzodithiophene-alt-benzotriazole backbone. Polymers of this type are an important family of polymer donors in high performance PSCs.57 Three optimization procedures were conducted. First, it was the D/A weight ratios. The test data of the devices based on blends with different D/A weight ratios have been collected in Tables S3 and S7 (ESI†). Accordingly, 1:1 and 1.5:1 are the optimal D/A weight ratios for PBZ-C6/PIN-1 and for PBZ-C6/PIN-2, respectively. Second, the solvent additive was investigated for the PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blends (Table S4, ESI†). The addition of 0.5 vol% solvent additive to the chlorobenzene solution could improve the PCEs of the devices due to the significant increase in the fill factor (FF). The 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive seemed to be a little better than the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive. Therefore, the DIO content was further optimized to be 2 vol% for PBZ-C6/PIN-2 (Table S5, ESI†). It should be noted that the 2 vol% DIO solvent additive was also further employed in the PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blends. Third, it was thermal annealing treatment. Based on the former two optimum conditions, the PCEs of the devices were affected by this optimization procedure for both blends (Tables S6 and S8, ESI†). The best PCEs of the devices based on the PBZ-C6/PIN-1 and PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blends could, respectively, reach 5.81% and 5.00% after the blend annealing at 170 °C for 10 min (Fig. 5a and Table 2). The corresponding EQE spectra of the best devices are shown in Fig. 5b. The broad spectral response of 300–800 nm showed that both PBZ-C6 and acceptor components conduce to photocurrent generation, which was corresponding to their complementary absorption. The peak values of over 55% were located at 500–650 nm, which was ascribed to the contribution of the wide bandgap donor PBZ-C6. It is worth noting that there was a low photo response in the NIR region, which was ascribed to the contribution of the polymer acceptors. It is a typical defect of the photovoltaic devices based on the blends of wide bandgap polymer donors and NDI polymer acceptors, presumably because NDI polymers possess insufficient molar extinction coefficients in the NIR region.

The bulk charge transport properties of both the optimized blends were investigated by the space charge limited current method. As displayed in Fig. 6 and Table S9 (ESI†), the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blend showed a hole mobility (μh) of 9.47 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 4.22 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to a μh/μe value of 22.44, and the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blend showed a μh value of 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 3.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, corresponding to a μh/μe value of 33.94. The relatively balanced charge transport properties might contribute to a higher FF for the former than that of the latter. The surface morphology of the blends was investigated by topping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 7). The optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blend displayed a relatively uniform morphology with a root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 2.44 nm, while the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blend showed a rough morphology with an RMS value of 4.67 nm. The results also supported that the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blend could show better device performance than the optimized PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blend to some extent. As mentioned before, PIN-1 and PIN-2 showed a significant difference in molecular weights. It seemed that PIN-1 had a better compatibility with the polymer donor PBZ-C6 than PIN-2. This result showed that suitable rather than high molecular weights were beneficial for effective mixing with the polymer donor in the blend, which could be the reason for the observed difference in the morphologies. Therefore, suitable molecular weights for polymer acceptors are significant for the improvement of the PCEs of the resulting devices.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed two new indacenodithienothiophene–naphthalene diimide polymer acceptors PIN-1 and PIN-2 by two side-chain design strategies (SE-1 and SE-3), and have synthesized them by convenient and green DHAP methods. Both polymer acceptors showed similar absorption spectra and electron energy levels. Although PIN-2 had a much higher molecular weight than PIN-1, the latter-based all-PSCs had a slightly higher PCE (5.00% vs. 5.81%). The reason might be that the PBZ-C6/PIN-1 blends could display better bulk charge transport properties and surface morphology than the PBZ-C6/PIN-2 blends. The results have indicated that both side-chain design strategies, SE-2 and SE-3, are alternative routes for designing efficient NDI polymer acceptors for all-PSCs. A slight difference between SE-2 and SE-3 is that the symmetrical NDI monomers for SE-2 can be relatively easily obtained, compared with the asymmetrical counterparts for SE-3. Importantly, DHAP is a promising green and low-cost synthetic method. Although there are still very few high-performance NDI polymer photovoltaic acceptors synthesized by DHAP methods, we believe that DHAP possesses great potential for developing them and also for exploring new types of acceptors.
