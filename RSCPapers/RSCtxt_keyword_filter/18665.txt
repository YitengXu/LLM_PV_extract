    , Accepted 16th September 2012First published on 18th September 2012AbstractA novel, asymmetric DPP bridge/core was synthesized and tested in DSC devices. By desymmetrising the DPP core/bridge, a remarkable IPCE of >80% and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.7% were achieved. With the use of a wide-bandgap co-sensitizer, 8.6% PCE was realized under standard AM1.5G sunlight.
Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 10%1–3 make dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology a leader in the field of non-conventional photovoltaics. Optimizing components such as the appropriate nanostructured metal oxide, sensitizer, and redox shuttle offer control over aesthetic properties such as transparency and colour, as well as performance parameters such as current density and output voltage.2 The sensitizer is one of the most important components, determining both light harvesting efficiency and the colour of the DSC device. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has the potential to harvest photons up to 1000 nm in wavelength and is well known as an industrial colorant;4–7 developing this core into an effective π-bridge, for use in D–π–A sensitizers, could break performance barriers and further increase the appeal of integrating DSCs into building materials. DPP-based sensitizers have been reported for use in DSCs only a handful of times,8–12 and we recently completed a structure–property relationship study concerning the symmetric Thienyl-DPP (ThDPP) core, where the sensitizer coded DPP03 achieved 5% PCE.13 The success of a ThDPP-based sensitizer, and the continued success of Phenyl-DPP (PhDPP) sensitizers,11 led us to investigate a novel structural modification. Herein, we demonstrate a new and successful design for DPP-based sensitizers, utilizing an asymmetric Th-DPP-Ph core (DPP07, see Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structures of DPP07 and NT35. 
It was apparent from our first study13 that incorporating a phenyl group between the DPP unit and both the donor and acceptor moieties of the dye was advantageous. We envisaged that an asymmetric DPP core, with one flanking thienyl and one flanking phenyl, would allow us to gain colour over the strictly phenyl-substituted DPP while improving IPCE performance over the strictly thienyl-substituted DPP: the planar thienyl group was utilized in conjugation with the donor, while the phenyl group was utilized in conjugation with the acceptor. This is an entirely new class of DPP-based sensitizers, and it requires a modified synthetic protocol.
In order to realize industrial relevance, we utilized a synthetic route for this asymmetric core similar to that reported by BASF Schweiz14 for the synthesis of a thiophene-furan asymmetric DPP core (see Scheme S1, ESI†). It should be noted that BASF (formerly CIBA) developed this DPP chemistry on the ton scale, and that this core should be very attractive for commercial applications. The maximum absorbance of the sensitizer was observed at ∼560 nm, which is ∼80 nm blue-shifted compared to DPP03 (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The hypsochromic shift for DPP07 is explained by the increased dihedral twist at the DPP–Ph bond (see Fig. S2, ESI†), the increased aromatic stabilization energy of the phenyl group, and the decreased electron donating strength of phenyl compared to thiophene. Electrochemical features were characterized with cyclic voltammetry measurements in a 0.1 M dimethylformamide solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Platinum counter and reference electrodes were used with a glassy carbon working electrode. The ground-state oxidation potential (E(S+/S)) was determined to be 0.29 V vs. Fc+/Fc, corresponding to 0.98 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (using E0(Fc+/Fc) = 0.69 V vs. NHE15). The reduction potential (Ered) was determined to be −0.87 V vs. NHE. Given the HOMO–LUMO gap (E(0,0)) taken from the onset of the absorbance, ∼1.90 eV, the corresponding excited state oxidation potential (E(S+/S*)) is calculated to be −0.92 V vs. NHE.
The DPP07 sensitized solar cells generated a PCE of ∼7.70% (see all photovoltaic details in Table 1 and Fig. 2) and exhibited over 80% incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) from 500 to 640 nm (see Fig. 3). Compared to 5.03%, the performance with DPP03, it is apparent that the DPP07-based solar cells outperform the DPP03 sensitized solar cell (see IV curves comparison in Fig. S3, ESI†). Despite the decreased spectral breadth of DPP07 compared to DPP03, the asymmetric nature of DPP07 yielded an increased IPCE and ultimately higher performance: DPP03 sensitized solar cells exhibited an IPCE extending to longer wavelengths, close to 800 nm, but fewer photons were converted to photocurrent.13 The reason for the higher performance of DPP07 sensitized solar cells is mainly a result of linear current generation with light intensity. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the current dynamics as a function of light intensity, which displays the individual photocurrents normalized to 1 sun Jsc.

The photocurrent from the DPP07 sensitized solar cell shows exceptional linearity, achieving a plateau at intensities between 0.01 and 1 sun, compared to the DPP03 solar cell which fails to plateau. It is noted that the presence of CDCA improved the current linearity for both sensitizers. This linearity is likely ascribed to less aggregation for DPP07, as the asymmetric DPP bridge/core could impede π–π interactions between the sensitizers. Further work is underway concerning this non-linear photocurrent response.
To realize the full potential of this relatively low-bandgap sensitizer, a wide-bandgap co-sensitizer16–21 was utilized to eke out more current from the high energy photons, as well as to aid in surface coverage leading to improved Voc.22 With an optimized molar ratio 1:1 (among 4:1, 1:1, 1:4), the PCE is improved to over 8.30% for photovoltaic devices utilizing the new co-sensitizer NT35 (see the structure in Fig. 1) as well as with D35.23 NT35 (D35 sans thiophene) has its maximum absorbance at ∼415 nm on the TiO2 surface, which is ∼35 nm blue shifted when compared to D35 (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The wide-bandgap sensitizers substantially increased the high-energy visible light absorption from 400–550 nm, broadening the IPCE spectra of the co-sensitized photovoltaic devices when compared to the DPP07 single-sensitizer devices (see Fig. 3). Despite a slight loss in DPP07's absorption in the presence of D35 (see Fig. S6, ESI†), the light harvesting efficiency exceeding 95% over most of visible light (400–635 nm) is expected, given the thicker TiO2 film used for PV characterization. The IPCEs of co-sensitized devices maintained high values even at low energy wavelengths and they (particularly DPP07/D35) show nearly-ideal panchromatic shapes from 400–750 nm.

Interestingly, the Voc of co-sensitized cells, particularly DPP07/D35, were improved. The increase is likely due to an increase in electron lifetime in the presence of the wide bandgap sensitizer (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The DPP07/D35 co-sensitized solar cell showed the longest electron lifetime, followed by DPP07/NT35. The increased lifetime is plausibly ascribed to either the functional group dihexyloxybiphenyl3,24,25 at the donor ligand of the wide-bandgap dyes or general passivation by the wide-bandgap dyes acting as co-adsorbents.20 Ultimately, a peak-performance DPP07/D35 co-sensitized solar cell achieved 8.6% power conversion efficiency, improved from 7.7% obtained by the DPP07 single-sensitizer solar cell, due to an increase in both Voc and Jsc.
A rationally designed asymmetric DPP bridge/core was synthesized for DSC applications. A remarkable IPCE exceeding 80% across the visible light region was achieved with this asymmetric core, leading to a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.7% for the single dye DPP07. This improvement over DPP03 comes as a result of increased photocurrent, despite a hypsochromic shift in the spectral absorbance. The asymmetric ThDPPPh-based sensitizer for DSC applications reveals a balanced approach to DPP design, maximizing spectral response and IPCE. This asymmetric approach is expected to yield higher performance sensitizers with the use of stronger donating groups to maximize light absorption. The use of a wide-bandgap co-sensitizer to eke out greater current density from the high-energy region of the solar spectrum yielded an ultimate PCE of 8.6% at AM1.5G sunlight. A preliminary stability test conducted under successive 1 sunlight soaking at 60 °C showed that the efficiency remained at 80% of the initial value without a drop of the photocurrent after 1000 h (see ESI†). Our further study is towards dyes designed to gain not only absorbance in the red/near-IR with this asymmetric approach but also a long-term stability.
