These light-harvesting semiconducting electron donor polymers are of high interest in the field of organic photovoltaics as both the block architecture and the (functionalized) side chains play a crucial role in determining the bulk heterojunction active layer blend (nano)morphology and thereby the final polymer solar cell efficiency and lifetime.
Since the discovery of electrical conductivity in organic polymers in the late 1970s,1 these materials have found many applications. Polythiophenes show high conductivity, stability, and processability and have therefore become one of the most popular classes of conjugated polymers,2 widely studied in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),3 light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),4 solar cells,5 and chemical sensors.6 Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on conjugated polymers, as an alternative to the traditional silicon-based solar cells, have received great attention over the last decade due to the eminent interest in low cost energy production employing renewable resources.7 Polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have extensively been studied for the benchmark P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester) combination.7,8 The morphology of the conjugated polymer:fullerene active layer blend has been identified as one of the most important features that control the function within these devices and it is a key issue to improve both the power conversion efficiency and the long term stability of the devices.9 This nanoscale morphology can be optimized towards an ideal phase-separated structure, enabling efficient charge transfer and providing percolation pathways for the charge carriers, by varying the blend composition, processing from different solvents, the use of additives, and/or thermal or solvent annealing.10,11 Even when an optimal morphology can be achieved, the blend components tend to phase-separate over time, creating individual polymer and fullerene regions and rendering the devices less efficient. This decline in photovoltaic performance proceeds considerably faster at higher (operational) temperatures. It has been shown that the thermal stability of the blend nanomorphology can be significantly improved by utilization of high Tg conducting polymers,12 side chain functionalization,13 or crosslinkable14 polymers and/or fullerenes.
Another way to achieve control over the blend morphology is the implementation of block copolymers.15–18 Due to their well-defined sequences, ordered chain architectures, and capability of self-assembly, block copolymers tend to phase-separate into well-ordered domains. Block copolythiophenes composed of two different polythiophene blocks have been prepared for several optoelectronic applications, such as FETs,19 polymer solar cells (for photoactive or hole transporting layers),20,21 and memory devices.22 Block copolythiophenes have generally been prepared by the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization, taking advantage of the living nature of the system.8,23
The ‘Rieke zinc method’ has also been applied for the synthesis of polythiophenes. The Rieke procedure uses highly reactive Rieke zinc metal powder (Zn*) which undergoes oxidative addition to 2,5-dibromo-3-alkylthiophenes at cryogenic temperatures to afford 2-bromo-5-(bromozincio)-3-alkylthiophenes in a highly regioselective way (the minor 5-bromo-2-(bromozincio)-3-alkylthiophene isomers are formed in ∼5% only).24 The regioselectivity of the oxidative addition increases at lower temperatures. The organozinc compound formed in excess then undergoes regioselective polymerization affording highly regioregular (rr) polymers.24 In contrast to the GRIM method, the procedure is compatible with numerous side chain patterns, including aldehydes, ketones and nitriles, making it a very useful synthetic protocol.25 Nevertheless, the Rieke polymerization has only scarcely been used and elaborated, apart from some notable exceptions,26 mainly due to difficulties in the preparation of the Rieke zinc and reproducibility issues. As such, block copolythiophene synthesis via the Rieke method has not been reported before, apart from a single patent by Rieke himself.27
We have recently developed a synthetic method which enables the preparation of Rieke zinc in an efficient and reproducible way and we have successfully applied this optimized procedure to the synthesis of regular P3HT.28 It was shown that the benzothiophene impurity, present in commercial naphthalene samples in small quantities, has a crucial effect on the physical properties and reactivity of the formed active zinc powder. Addition of 3 mol% of benzothiophene (with regard to ZnCl2) to the lithium naphthalenide precursor solution (prepared in situ) is crucial to prevent agglomeration of the resulting Zn* particles. In this study, we show that this optimized procedure also allows preparation of ester side chain functionalized diblock copolythiophenes.
The GRIM and Rieke polymerization methods towards regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) are transition metal (Ni) catalyzed cross-coupling reactions proceeding via a cycle of three sequential steps, i.e. oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination.8,29 It is formally accepted that these reactions are polycondensation reactions and therefore they should follow a step-growth mechanism. Nevertheless, it was proposed by Yokozawa et al. that the GRIM and McCullough Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling polymerization reactions proceed via a chain-growth mechanism.23a Moreover, McCullough and co-workers suggested that the polymerization is not only chain-growth, but it is also a ‘living’ system.23b Since the polymerization is considered living, the addition of Grignard reagents (RMgX) at the end of the reaction leads to end-capped rr-P3ATs.30,31 The McCullough group has also observed that addition of a new portion of the 2-bromo-5-chloromagnesium-3-alkylthiophene monomer to the Ni-terminated P3AT resulted in an increase of the molar mass, affording a polythiophene composed of two different blocks.23b
The high chemoselectivity, functional group tolerance and stability of organozinc compounds32 render the Rieke zinc protocol highly attractive for more advanced polymer topologies. To be able to synthesize well-defined block copolythiophenes via the Rieke method, the propagating chain has to maintain its reactivity over a sufficiently long period of time, enabling sequential addition of different monomers. For our block copolymer synthesis trials, dibrominated thiophenes with ester-functionalized side chains were chosen as the second monomer units, besides regular 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (M1), for several reasons. The ester functions can smoothly be converted to other functional groups (carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc.) by postpolymerization reactions.13c,e Moreover, we have recently shown that ester-functionalized random copolythiophenes can be beneficially applied to increase the thermal stability of BHJ organic solar cell active layer blends.13 Previous results have indicated that the GRIM procedure also tolerates esters,33 but the organomagnesium intermediates have to be prepared via halogen/Mg exchange at low temperatures to avoid side reactions, which is not required for the Rieke protocol due to the higher chemoselectivity of organozinc reagents.
The synthetic strategies employed for the preparation of the 2,5-dibromothiophene monomers and the ester-functionalized diblock copolymers are outlined in Scheme 1. 2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (M1) was prepared according to the standard literature procedure via Kumada coupling of 3-bromothiophene and hexylmagnesium bromide and subsequent dibromination with an excess of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF.34 A similar route was used to prepare the ester-functionalized monomers M2a,b. Nonetheless, in the first step an organozinc compound was employed instead of the traditional organomagnesium reagent. Following our optimized procedure to prepare Rieke zinc in a highly reactive form,28 the alkylester bromide precursors were treated with an excess of Rieke zinc at room temperature to afford the organozinc reagents in excellent yields (>99%, as determined by GC-MS analysis after quenching an aliquot from the reaction with a saturated NH4Cl solution). The coupling reaction with 3-bromothiophene was performed in the presence of the Ni(dppe)Cl2 catalyst with addition of LiBr to shorten the reaction time.35 Dibromination was performed with bromine in dichloromethane.35

The synthetic approach for the preparation of the block copolymers then consisted of two steps (Scheme 1). The first reaction involves the synthesis of the monobromo-terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT–Br) block, requiring oxidative addition of Rieke zinc to M1 in a regiospecific manner (Organozinc I).28 Polymerization of the organozinc monomer was performed by addition of a catalytic amount of Ni(dppe)Cl2 at 40 °C for 15 minutes. In the second step, the organozinc solution (Organozinc II) of the respective ester-functionalized thiophene monomer M2a,b, prepared in the same manner in a separate Schlenk tube, was transferred dropwise to the polymerization mixture. This was only done after complete conversion of M1 was confirmed by 1H NMR and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The polymerization was allowed to continue for an additional 30 minutes and then quenched with a 2 M HCl solution. The diblock copolymers were precipitated in methanol, followed by sequential Soxhlet extraction steps with methanol, hexanes and chloroform, respectively. The chloroform fractions were concentrated to afford the block copolymer materials in around 65% yield. The resultant diblock copolythiophenes are readily soluble in organic solvents. The polymerization was performed for the two different ester-functionalized monomers M2a,b with monomer feed ratios of 50/50 and 85/15. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1. The amount of catalyst was adjusted to 3 (P2) or 1 mol% (P1) with respect to the total amount of monomer. The monomer concentration was 0.1 M for the P2 polymers, whereas it was 0.015 M for the P1 block copolythiophenes. The high dilution was applied to prevent possible precipitation of the resultant polymers (notably P1). Despite the fact that a lower amount of Ni catalyst (1 mol%) was employed for the P1 polymers, the resulting materials had similar average molar masses (Table 1), which can be due to the non-optimized polymerization conditions.

Fig. 1 shows the size exclusion chromatograms of the P3HT-b-PE6TH 50/50 (P2-50/50) block copolymer and its precursor (1st block). The chromatogram clearly shifted to higher molar mass, while maintaining a narrow dispersity (D 1.18), confirming the formation of a block copolymer through chain extension of the Ni-terminated P3HT–Br prepolymer.36 The successful addition of the second block and the built-in molar ratio were also confirmed by 1H NMR. The built-in ratios closely respond to the monomer feed ratios (Table 1). Fig. 2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the P2-50/50 diblock copolymer. The ester-functionalized M2b monomer can be identified by the appearance of a quadruplet and a triplet at 4.10 and 2.31 ppm, respectively, arising from the methylene protons closest to the ester moiety. The monomer incorporation ratio was determined by integrating either of these signals and the triplet arising from the methyl protons of the hexyl side chains.

Rapid heat–cool (RHC (ref. 37)) DSC thermograms for the different copolymers are presented in Fig. 3 and the values of the melting peak temperatures and enthalpies are gathered in Table 2. Glass transition temperatures were hard to define for all materials studied, which is not surprising as the glass transition for pure P3HT is usually hard to determine. Both the P1 and P2 block copolymers show semi-crystalline behavior. For the P1 materials, this is most pronounced in the 50/50 composition, where a melting peak temperature (174 °C) is found that is very similar to that of a P3HT precursor polymer (177 °C) obtained via quenching after polymerization of the first block only (Mn = 4.9 × 103 g mol−1, D = 1.18; no Soxhlet purification was performed on this sample though). The lower melting enthalpy, about 58% of that of the P3HT single block, is a possible indication that the melting can be entirely attributed to this block in the copolymer, as this corresponds well to the built-in molar ratio (56/44) derived from 1H NMR. For the P1-85/15 material a very small melting peak is observed at reduced temperature.

The P2-50/50 polymer shows the clearest indication of block copolymer behavior, exhibiting a double melting peak, which may be attributed to both blocks forming a separate crystalline phase (confirming the melting temperature of 177 °C for the P3HT block). The P2-85/15 copolymer exhibits a single pronounced melting peak at a higher temperature. This is a striking change as compared to the 50/50 composition as well as the precursor polymer. When comparing the P2-85/15 copolymer with the analogous random copolymer prepared before (Tm 207 °C, ΔHm 19.8 J g−1; Mn 15.4 × 103 g mol−1, D 1.67),13d,e the statistical monomer distribution seems to increase the melting temperature to a larger extent, although this may as well be related to the higher Mn for this material.37,38 All in all it is quite hard to draw any conclusions from this limited dataset regarding actual trends. Comparison of the different materials is additionally complicated by the molar mass differences among the samples studied, which can quite drastically affect the thermal properties, especially in the low molar mass regime, as recently reported for a series of P3HT fractions with varying Mn (keeping D almost constant).38 It should be noted that a transition is also visible at around 60 °C for the P3HT precursor material. This may be explained by the phenomenon of side group melting, which is only observable at low Mn and when the material is cooled sufficiently slow.39
In conclusion, the Rieke zinc method has successfully been implemented towards the synthesis of all-conjugated diblock copolythiophenes, in an efficient way and under common laboratory conditions, by applying an optimized protocol for the preparation of highly reactive Rieke zinc.28 The formation of block copolymers by sequential organozinc monomer addition was confirmed by SEC and 1H NMR, and further substantiated by RHC thermal analysis. The polymerization conditions have to be optimized further to achieve higher molar mass block copolythiophenes (by adjusting the monomer to catalyst feed ratio) and efforts in this direction, including addition of other types of monomers, are currently ongoing, as is the application of the block copolythiophene derivatives in organic solar cells.40

The tailing at the high molar mass side in the SEC profiles of the other block copolythiophenes (Fig. S1–S3†) might be related to some extent of termination (disproportionation), which is also reflected in the somewhat higher D values. A slightly low molar mass tailing is common for most controlled/living polymerization reactions.
