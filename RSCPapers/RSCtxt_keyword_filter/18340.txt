    , Accepted 31st August 2016First published on 31st August 2016AbstractRecently, solar cells based on 2D (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite have realized a power conversion efficiency of 3.23%. In this work, we study the defect properties of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 through density-functional theory calculations. It is found that the lower crystal structure dimensionality of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 makes the valence band maximum lower and the conduction band minimum higher as compared to its 3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite counterpart, resulting in relatively deeper defect transition levels. Our calculated defect formation energies suggest that if the 2D (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite absorbers are synthesized under Pb-poor and I-rich conditions, the dominant defects should be Pb vacancies, which create shallow levels. The resultant perovskite films are expected to exhibit p-type conductivity with a relatively long carrier lifetime.
Solar cells based on polycrystalline organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite films have realized a remarkable improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the last six years, showing a current record PCE of over 22%.1,2 However, some significant challenges must be resolved before this photovoltaic technology can be commercialized. One of the challenges is that lead halide perovskite absorbers react with moisture quickly and degrade to PbI2, losing the excellent photovoltaic properties.3,4 So far, extensive efforts have primarily focused on mitigating the moisture-induced degradation of perovskite solar cells. Besides encapsulating the devices using glass plates or moisture resistive polymers such as nanotube embedded polymer matrix (PMMA),5,6 adding hydrophobic cations into the perovskite absorbers has also been used to improve the moisture resistivity.7–9 On the anion site, it has been reported that adding pseudohalide SCN− can improve the moisture resistance of the perovskite absorbers.10,11 Recent reports have shown that after adding pseudohalide SCN−, the absorber becomes a 2D perovskite with a composition of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 (MA: CH3NH3) (see the crystal structure in Fig. 1a).12,13 It was further found that this 2D perovskite has a bandgap of slightly over 2.0 eV with a large absorption coefficient.14,15 The carriers are mobile, but are confined in the 2D layers.14,16 It was also suggested that this 2D perovskite could be considered for use as an absorber for the top cell of a tandem solar cell, if films could be grown with the 2D layers aligned perpendicular to the substrate.14

More recently, solar cells based on (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 absorbers have realized a PCE of 3.23%.12 Considering the large bandgap and the layered structure, this PCE value is surprisingly high and better than other 2D single-layered perovskite-based solar cells.17,18 Furthermore, the reported (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films were highly orientated along the (100) direction,12,14 which is unfavourable for solar cell device application due to the strong anisotropic transport and optical properties of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2. As we previously pointed out, if the (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films were grown with the 2D layers perpendicular to the substrate, similar to the 1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaics reported by Zhou et al.,19 the transport and optical properties, and, therefore, the PCE could be significantly improved. To understand fully the potential of the 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite for solar cell applications, it is important to study the defect properties of this 2D absorber, as the results may provide valuable guidance for further improving the performance of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2-based solar cells and also have implication for other prospective optoelectronic application.
In this work, we present a density-functional theory study on the defect properties of 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite. We find that this layered material may exhibit defect properties suitable for solar cell applications, if the absorbers are synthesized using Pb-poor/I-rich conditions. In this case, the dominant defects should be Pb vacancies, which create shallow levels. The absorber layers are then expected to have long carrier lifetime and exhibit a p-type conductivity.

Fig. 1b shows the calculated chemical potential window, in which, (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is stabilized against possible competitive phases including Pb, I2, MAI, MA(SCN), PbI2 and Pb(SCN)2. The chemical potential window polyhedron has a long but narrow shape, as is typical for halide perovskites,20,21 indicating that the chemical growth condition should be carefully controlled to form pure (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 phase.
The photovoltaic properties of an absorber are partially determined by the defect properties of the absorber including the charge-state transition levels and formation energies of point defects. We first calculated the charge-state transition levels for intrinsic acceptor-like (red) and donor-like (blue) defects in (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional,22 as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. VMA is a shallow acceptor with the (0/1−) transition level at 0.06 eV above the VBM, which is primarily due to the highly ionic nature of the MA+ anion. VPb exhibits a shallow (0/1−) transition level right at the VBM, but a deep (1−/2−) transition level at 0.44 eV above the VBM. VI has a deep (0/1+) transition level at 0.40 eV below the CBM. Compared with VI, VSCN shows a shallower (0/1+) transition level at 0.11 eV below the CBM, which should be attributed to the stronger ionicity for the SCN− anion than for the I− anion. MAi has a shallow (0/1+) transition level at 0.14 eV below the CBM, again, because of the high ionicity of the MA+ cation. In contrast, the Pbi has a very deep (0/2+) transition level at 0.86 eV below the CBM, because of the lower ionicity of Pb. Both Ii and SCNi have shallow (0/1−) transition levels (0.10 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively, above the VBM). The slightly shallower (0/1−) transition level of SCNi than that of Ii, again, could be attributed to the higher ionicity of the SCN− anion than the I− anion. The behavior of an antisite can be qualitatively understood by being considered as a pair of interstitial and vacancy. MAPb antisite, which can be viewed as a combination of MAi and VPb, has a relatively shallow (0/1−) transition at 0.15 eV above the VBM, which is understood from the shallow nature of both MAi and VPb. PbMA antisite (viewed as Pbi + VMA) also has a relatively shallow (0/1+) transition at 0.11 eV below the CBM, despite the deep nature of Pbi which features the formation of a covalent Pb dimer. All the other antisites have deep transition levels in the bandgap, as seen in Fig. 2. For the above results, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect, which is important for Pb 6p states, is not included, which may affect the calculated defect transition levels.24 Therefore, we further calculated the transition levels of some dominant defects, VPb, VI, and VSCN, using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)25,26 hybrid functional with SOC (HSE + SOC). The calculated (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transition levels of VPb are at 0.18 eV and 0.56 eV above the VBM, respectively. For VI and VSCN, the (0/1+) transition level is at 0.43 eV and 0.28 eV below the CBM, respectively. These HSE + SOC results are in general similar to the above PBE non-SOC results.

Compared with those in 3D MAPbI3,20,27 the defect transition levels in 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are generally deeper. This can be understood based on the differences of the electronic structures and the band edge positions of these perovskites. Fig. 3 shows the alignments of the experimental band edge positions (referred to the vacuum level) of the 3D MAPbI3 and 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites, with the transition levels of the dominant defects, VPb and VI, being shown. The VBM positions for MAPbI3 and (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 were reported to be −5.4 eV23 and −5.7 eV,12 respectively. Considering the bandgaps of 1.5 eV23 and 2.3 eV,15 the CBM positions of MAPbI3 and (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are calculated to be at −3.9 eV and −3.4 eV, respectively. As we reported previously, because of the electronic confinement along the interlayer direction, the VBM and CBM of 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 become less dispersive, leading to the lower VBM and the higher CBM, as compared with 3D MAPbI3. As seen in Fig. 3, the (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transition levels of VPb and the (0/1+) transition level of VI (and also VSCN) in 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 and 3D MAPbI3, to some degree, are similar with respect to the vacuum level. Therefore, the lower VBM and the higher CBM make the transition levels of acceptors such as VPb and donors such as VI deeper with respect to the band edge positions.
 Fig. 3  Alignment of VBM and CBM positions and defect transition levels with respect to the vacuum level of 3D MAPbI3 and 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites. The experimental VBM positions of −5.4 eV23 and −5.7 eV12 and bandgaps of 1.5 eV and 2.3 eV15 are used for MAPbI3 and (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2, respectively. The defect transition levels of MAPbI3 are taken from ref. 20. 
We have further calculated the formation energies of the above point defects. Here, we chose two representative chemical potential points in Fig. 1b for the following discussion; P (ΔμPb = −2.78 eV, ΔμI = 0 eV, ΔμSCN = −1.13 eV and ΔμMA = −3.97 eV; denoted as “Pb-poor/I-rich”) and B (ΔμPb = 0 eV, ΔμI = −1.39 eV, ΔμSCN = −2.52 eV and ΔμMA = −2.58 eV, denoted as “Pb-rich/I-poor”). The calculated formation energies ΔH of the intrinsic defects as a function of EF at these chemical points are plotted in Fig. 4a and b. Under the Pb-poor condition, VPb has the lowest ΔH over essentially the whole EF region and is the dominant defect, which should be mainly responsible for the intrinsic p-type conductivity of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films reported by Liu et al.12 IPb also has low ΔH, but is stabilized in the neutral charge state in the highly p-type region (EF < 0.40 eV), and therefore has little contribution to the p-type conductivity. For quantitative analysis, the equilibrium EF (EF,e) at 300 K (i.e., growth and defect formation at room temperature) was calculated by considering all the ΔH values and the semiconductor statistics,28,29 giving EF,e − EV = 0.05 eV and a hole concentration as high as 5.2 × 1018 cm−3. As the (1−/2−) transition level of VPb and the (0/1−) transition level of IPb are ∼0.4 eV above the EF,e, there is little possibility for these transitions to occur, which, therefore, won’t be recombination centers. As the chemical potential point shifts from the Pb-poor side to Pb-rich side, the ΔH of the acceptor defects including VPb and VMA increase, while those of the donor defects including VI and VSCN decrease. Under the Pb-rich condition, the ΔH of the dominant donor VI and the dominant acceptor VPb intersect at a n-type EF of 1.54 eV above the VBM (i.e., 0.50 eV below the CBM), where the EF is pinned by the formation of compensating V2+Pb and V−I charged defects, indicating a compensated n-type conductivity. For quantitative analysis, the electron concentration at EC − EV = 0.50 eV was estimated to be 1.1 × 1011 cm−3 at 300 K. As the dominant defect VI has a (0/1+) transition level just above the EF,e, it is likely to behave as a recombination center, which should be avoided for photovoltaic applications. These theoretical results indicate that the electrical properties of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 can range from high-density p-type to low-density n-type, depending on the growth condition. It is suggested that the (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films should be synthesized under the Pb-poor condition in order to realize good p-type conduction and maximize the photovoltaic performance. It should be pointed out that the p-type (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2-based solar cells have initially a PCE of 3.23%, which is not a bad start for a 2D absorber material. The PCE may be improved if further material and device optimizations are performed.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the defect properties of the 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite by density-functional theory calculations. It is found that the lower crystal structure dimensionality of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 makes the VBM lower and the CBM higher as compared to its 3D MAPbI3 perovskite counterpart, resulting in relatively deeper defect transition levels. Our calculated defect formation energies suggest that for optimal photovoltaic applications, the 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite absorber layers should be synthesized under Pb-poor and I-rich conditions so that the dominant defects are VPb, which create shallow defect transition levels. The thin films synthesized under these conditions should be intrinsically p-type.
Experimental section
Total-energy defect calculations were performed with the VASP code,30 using a plane wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and the Γ-only k-mesh for the 400-atoms supercell (2√2 × 2√2 × 1 unit cells). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)22 was used for the exchange–correlation functional, which predicts a bandgap of ∼2.1 eV for (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2,14 fairly close to the experimental values (∼2.1 eV in ref. 14 and ∼2.3 eV in ref. 15), because the underestimation due to the well-known standard DFT bandgap error and the overestimation due to the exclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) cancel each other.31 The atomic positions of the defect structures were relaxed until the total force on each atom was smaller than 0.05 eV Å−1. As the exclusion of the SOC may affect the defect transition levels, we also performed total-energy calculations for some dominant defects with the PBE-relaxed defect structures using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)25,26 hybrid functional with 43% of Hatree–Fock exchange and SOC, which reproduces the experimental bandgap of (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 and interprets well the lower conduction band derived from the Pb 6p states.14 The potential-alignment, image charge and band-filling corrections were applied by the methodology described in the literatures.21,32 For a defect (D) in a charge state q, the formation enthalpy is calculated through the equation33 ΔHD,q(μ, EF) = (ED,q − EH) − ∑nαμα + q(EF + EV),(1)where (ED,q − EH) is the energy difference between the defect and host supercells. nα indicates the number of α atoms added (nα > 0) or removed (nα < 0) when a defect is formed, and μα is the chemical potential of the α atom, which can be expressed with respect to that of the elemental phase (μelα) by μα = μelα + Δμα. EF is the Fermi level referred to the VBM, EV. The μα value varies depending on the experimental conditions.34 The equilibrium Fermi levels (EF,e) were determined using the calculated density of states (DOS) by solving semiconductor statistic equations self-consistently so as to satisfy the charge neutrality condition.28,35
The chemical potential window of the 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is determined using three steps. First, to stabilize the (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 phase, the following thermodynamic equilibrium must be reached: 2ΔμMA + ΔμPb + 2ΔμSCN + 2ΔμI = ΔH((MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2) = −12.98 eV,(2)where ΔH((MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2) is the formation enthalpy of MA2Pb(SCN)2I2, as referred to the elemental solids Pb (cubic structure, space group Fmm) and I2 (orthorhombic, Cmca), and organic groups CH3NH3 (MA) and SCN (i.e., assuming gas models). Second, to exclude the elemental phases, it is required that ΔμMA < 0, ΔμPb < 0, ΔμSCN < 0, and ΔμI < 0. Third, to avoid the formation of the competing secondary phases including MAI (tetragonal, space group P4/nmm),36 PbI2 (trigonal, Pm1),37 MA(SCN) (following Cs(SCN), orthorhombic, Pnma),38 Pb(SCN)2 (monoclinic, C2/c),39 and MAPbI3 (tetragonal, I4/mcm),40 the following equations also must be satisfied: ΔμMA + ΔμI < ΔH(MAI) = −3.72 eV(3) ΔμMA + ΔμSCN < ΔH(MA(SCN)) = −5.10 eV(4) ΔμPb + 2ΔμI < ΔH(PbI2) = −2.04 eV(5) ΔμPb + 2ΔμSCN < ΔH(Pb(SCN)2) = −5.04 eV(6) ΔμMA + ΔμPb + 3ΔμI < ΔH(MAPbI3) = −5.95 eV(7) Under the above constraints, the allowed ΔμPb, ΔμI, and ΔμSCN for single-phase (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are bound in a polyhedron as shown in Fig. 1b, whereas ΔμMA is associated with ΔμPb, ΔμI, and ΔμSCN through eqn (2).

 	Fig. 3  Alignment of VBM and CBM positions and defect transition levels with respect to the vacuum level of 3D MAPbI3 and 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskites. The experimental VBM positions of −5.4 eV23 and −5.7 eV12 and bandgaps of 1.5 eV and 2.3 eV15 are used for MAPbI3 and (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2, respectively. The defect transition levels of MAPbI3 are taken from ref. 20.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated formation enthalpies ΔH of intrinsic defects in (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 as a function of Fermi level EF at two representative chemical potential points in Fig. 1b, (a) P (Pb-poor) and (b) B (Pb-rich). Defects with very high ΔH values are shown by dashed lines. The vertical dashed lines mark the calculated equilibrium Fermi level EF,e at T = 300 K.
