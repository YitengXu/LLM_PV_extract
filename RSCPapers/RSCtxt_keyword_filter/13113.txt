    , Accepted 27th November 2022First published on 12th December 2022AbstractHigh-performance non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) are valuable for promoting the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, owing to their adjustable surface tension and molecular packing, asymmetric NFAs are promising for the development of novel organic photovoltaic materials. Herein, three novel asymmetric NFAs, namely Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3, have been designed and synthesized by rationally tuning the branching position of the carbazole-terminal side-chains on the pyrrole ring along with varying halogen substitutions on the indanone end-groups. Consequently, in the PM6:Y6-SCz2 combination, the systematically optimized absorption, energy level, Flory–Huggins interaction parameters, and charge transport process generate a champion PCE of 15.60% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V in OSCs. Our findings deliver new insights into the molecular design of asymmetric NFAs, which are of great importance for further practical implementation of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies owing to their advantages of low cost, light weight, and flexibility.1–16 Currently, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which are based on a π-extended benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (BT) fused-ring core (BTP) and indanone terminal groups in a banana-shaped molecular geometry, greatly promote the progress of OSCs.1,3,17–19
To fully explore the photovoltaic performance of NFAs, molecular engineering, e.g., fused-ring donor core, end-group moiety, and π-bridge unit, has been systematically investigated to adjust the optical-electrical characteristics and solid-state morphology. In particular, the asymmetric structure regulation of NFAs shows potential for improving polarity, dipole moment, and intermolecular interactions to facilitate the dissociation of charge transfer states. For instance, Lin et al. designed and synthesized an asymmetric acceptor Y6-4O with a highly polarizable oligo(ethylene glycol) side-chain onto a pyrrole core, in which the high permittivity (εr) of the side-chain affords an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2% in non-halogenated solvent fabrication.20 Huang et al. developed two isomeric NFAs, namely EH-HD-4F (2-ethylhexyl and 2-hexyldecyl side-chains) and Bu-OD-4F (2-butyl and 2-octyldodecyl side-chains), to modulate molecular packing and orientation in the matrix, yielding a champion PCE of up to 18.38% in OSCs.21 Besides, considering the unique properties of aryl–alkyl chains, such as diverse aryl selectivity, multiple substitution sites, and strong electron transfer capacity, Hsu et al. recently reported two asymmetric acceptors BTP-EHBO-4F and BTP-PHD-4F with aromatic side-chains, offering greatly enhanced open-circuit voltage in OSCs, which is crucial for practical applications.22 Meanwhile, halogen substitution on the indanone end-groups of NFAs has been widely utilized to increase the dipole moment and enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer effect as well. However, research on aryl–alkyl side-chain engineering in asymmetric halogen-substituted NFAs is quite limited. Moreover, the synergistic effect of aryl–alkyl chains and halogen substitution on asymmetric NFAs must be revealed to achieve high-performance OSCs.23
Herein, we designed and synthesized three asymmetric NFAs, namely Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3, by rationally pairing halogen substitution and carbazole-terminated side-chains with different alkyl spacer lengths into the Y6 skeleton, in which the carbazole derivative is a representative aromatic heterocyclic unit to enhance space conjugation along the lamellar packing lattices. The corresponding intrinsic properties, i.e., absorption, energy level, surface tension, and molecular packing, could be finely regulated. In the optimal PM6:Y6-SCz2 combination, a champion PCE of 15.60% with a decent open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V was achieved, which was attributed to the simultaneously upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, hyper-miscibility-induced small domains, and high crystallinity in the matrix. The results given herein offer essential guidelines for the molecular design of high-performance asymmetric NFAs in OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Molecular design, synthesis, and characterization
Given the molecular structure of champion semiconductors in OSCs, we selected an NFA based on the Y6 acceptor as the model platform of the backbone. To comprehensively investigate the synergetic effects of the carbazole-terminated side-chain and halogen-substituted end-group in the asymmetric Y-series acceptor, we designed and synthesized novel Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 acceptors with varying alkyl spacer length and halogen substitution unit (Fig. 1a). Their synthetic routes are presented in Scheme S1, and the corresponding molecular characterizations are detailed in the Experimental section in the ESI.†

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the three acceptors in chloroform (CF) solution and the thin-film state were measured. As shown in Fig. 1b, in chloroform solution, both Y6-SCz1 and Y6-SCz2 exhibit almost identical absorption profiles with a similar maximum absorption peak at 727 nm, suggesting that the length of alkyl spacer in the carbazole-terminated side-chains impacts molecular aggregation in the solution state. Meanwhile, the chlorinated Y6-SCz3 exhibited 15 nm red-shifted spectra (742 nm) relative to the fluorinated acceptors, which is attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect in Y6-SCz3.24 Additionally, obvious bathochromic shifts of 69, 59, and 65nm were observed for Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3, respectively, yielding maximum absorption peaks in the order of Y6-SCz2 (790 nm) < Y6-SCz1 (803 nm) < Y6-SCz3 (813 nm), which are complementary to the absorption spectra of the PM6 donor polymer (Fig. 1c). This observation implies that alkyl spacer and halogen substitution can greatly affect molecular packing in the solid state.25,26 The electronic energy levels of the three acceptors were measured using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and Fc/Fc+ couple as an internal reference, whose curves are plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). According to the equation ELUMO/HOMO = −e(Ered/ox + 4.36), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) and LUMO energy level (ELUMO) were calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eox) and onset reduction potential (Ered), respectively. The estimated ELUMO/EHOMO values of Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are −3.84/−5.86 eV, −3.82/−5.80 eV and −3.85/−5.83 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c and Table 1).

Moreover, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to assess the thermal properties of the three acceptors. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss are 324 °C, 322 °C and 321 °C for Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3, respectively, featuring excellent thermal stability for applications in OSCs. Specifically, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a visibly higher melting temperature and distinct cold crystallization behavior were observed in Y6-SCz2, signifying its higher priority in crystallization in the non-equilibrium quenched state (Fig. S2, ESI†).27
2.2 Photovoltaic properties
To further understand the impact of the carbazole-terminated alkyl spacer length and halogen substitution unit on photovoltaic performance, we fabricated OSC devices based on Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2 and Y6-SCz3 with the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:acceptor/PDINN/Ag,28 in which PM6 was selected as the polymer donor.29 Detailed device optimizations are provided in the ESI.† Based on the prepared photovoltaic devices, the optimal photovoltaic parameters of the devices are collected in Table 2, and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The PM6:Y6-SCz1-based device yields a PCE of 14.05%, VOC of 0.866V, JSC of 24.90mAcm−2, and FF of 66.88%. For the PM6:Y6-SCz2-based device, the VOC and FF increase to 0.870V and 73.08%, respectively. The higher VOC is mainly due to the slightly upshifted ELUMO of Y6-SCz2. Hence, an outstanding PCE of 15.60% is obtained for the Y6-SCz2-based device. As for the PM6:Y6-SCz3-based device, the decrease in VOC is consistent with its lower LUMO level, and the slightly higher JSC might be related to the red-shifted absorption region. To further confirm JSC accuracy, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 2b, all EQE spectral profiles are quite similar, and the integrated current densities (JCal) for the OSCs based on Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are 23.94 mA cm−2, 23.60 mA cm−2, and 23.98 mA cm−2, respectively, which agrees well with the comparable JSC output obtained from J–V measurements.

2.3 Morphological analyses
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was carried out to probe the molecular packing behavior of the neat and blend films. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), increased alkyl spacer length in the carbazole-terminated side-chain induces the transformation of the π-orientation from dominantly π-edge-on in Y6-SCz1 to π-face-on in Y6-SCz2. Additional replacement of the halogen unit in the end-group of Y6-SCz2 leads to relatively loose π-stacking but maintains dominant π-face-on orientation in the Y6-SCz3 film. Upon blending with the PM6 donor polymer, the PM6:Y6-SCz2 combination exhibits not only a superior (010) coherence length (CCL) of 34.91 Å in the out-of-plane direction but also closer lamellar packing in the in-plane direction, which favors the charge transport process in vertically constructed OSCs (Fig. 4 and Table 4).
The surface and bulk morphologies were further characterized using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a–c, interpenetrating networks with smoother domains are observed in the PM6:Y6-SCz2 matrix, with the smallest root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value of 0.733 nm, indicating finer miscibility between PM6 and Y6-SCz2 in the blend. Meanwhile, based on contact angle measurements, the estimated surface tensions of PM6, Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are 19.94. 23.19, 21.93, and 22.92 mN m−1, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 3). All three acceptors exhibit larger surface tension than PM6, as the acceptors with strong withdrawing groups in general possess regionally higher polarity. Compatibility among the components was further evaluated by calculating the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ. The χ value of the PM6:Y6-SCz2 combination is 0.05, far lower than those of PM6:Y6-SCz1 (χ = 0.12) and PM6:Y6-SCz3 (χ = 0.10). The resulting smaller χ value indicates stronger interaction between PM6 and Y6-SCz2 and accounts for the finer phase separation phenomenon in the matrix.

2.4 Exciton dissociation and charge transport processes
To directly compare the exciton dissociation probability (ηdiss) of the blends, the dependence of net photocurrent (Jph) on effective applied voltage (Veff) was investigated. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are photocurrent densities under standard illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vbias is the external voltage applied to the device. According to Fig. 2d, Jph is saturated (Jsat) when Veff is higher than 1 V as charge recombination is minimized at higher voltage owing to the high internal electric field in the device. Thus, ηdiss can be estimated from the value of the photocurrent density Jph divided by the saturated photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions.30 The closer the ηdiss value is to 1, the more effective the exciton dissociation process in the device. The Jsat of devices based on Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are 25.62 mA cm−2, 25.04 mA cm−2, and 26.41 mA cm−2, respectively. The ηdiss values were calculated to be 0.973, 0.986, and 0.981, respectively. It is obvious that the devices based on the three acceptors present satisfactory ηdiss values, indicating that these devices can achieve comparable high exciton dissociation efficiency. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of PM6 in the three blend films was measured, as displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). All three devices show excellent fluorescence quenching efficiency, which is well consistent with the aforementioned ηdiss results.
Next, the charge recombination behavior in the blends was studied by plotting the dependence of JSC and VOC on different light intensities (Plight) (Fig. 2e and 3f). Generally, the relationship between JSC and Plight can be described as JSC ∝ Plightα. The extracted α values of Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are 0.940, 0.973, and 0.956, respectively, illustrating the most suppressed bimolecular recombination in the PM6:Y6-SCz2 device and consistent with FF outputs in OSCs. For the dependence of VOC on Plight, their relationship can be described as VOC ∝ n(KT/q)ln(Plight), where n, q, T, and K are the ideal factor, elementary charge, temperature in K, and Boltzmann constant, respectively. The value of n normally lies in the range of 1–2. n = 2 indicates that trap-assisted recombination dominates in the device, and the closer n gets to 1, the more suppressed the trap-assisted recombination. As shown in Fig. 2f, the n values of the devices based on Y6-SCz1, Y6-SCz2, and Y6-SCz3 are 1.17, 1.02, and 1.09, respectively. The results suggest that the PM6:Y6-SCz2 device exhibits the least charge recombination probability, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced VOC and FF parameters in OSCs.
Besides, to gain more insight into the charge transport properties of the devices, the charge mobilities were estimated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method.31 As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Table 1, for the PM6:Y6-SCz1- and PM6:Y6-SCz3-based devices, their electron (μe)/hole (μh) mobilities were estimated to be 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μe/μh ratios of 0.77 and 0.89, respectively. For the PM6:Y6-SCz2-based device, the corresponding μe and μh values are 3.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh ratio of 0.90. The higher and more-balanced μe/μh values in the PM6:Y6-SCz2 blend are an important factor for achieving superior performance in OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, through the rational molecular design of both the carbazole-terminated side-chain and halogen-substituted end-group in asymmetric Y-series acceptors, a novel high-performance Y6-SCz2 asymmetric acceptor was developed. Optimal phase separation texture with enhanced π-face-on crystallization was achieved in the PM6:Y6-SCz2 combination, yielding an outstanding PCE of 15.60% and high FF of 73.08% in OSCs. Our results demonstrate a novel design approach of asymmetric NFA via synergetic alkyl spacer length and halogen substitution, which is of great importance for subtly controlling the semiconductor physical properties, nano/micromorphology, and charge transport process in the active layer. The protocol herein opens an avenue for fully excavating the semiconductor characteristics of state-of-art conjugated materials toward organic electronics.
