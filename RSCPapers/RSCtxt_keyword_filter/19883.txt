    , Accepted 25th September 2017First published on 26th September 2017AbstractIn this work, efficient nonfullerene (NF) polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a polymer donor PM6 containing a fluorinated-thienyl benzodithiophene unit and a small molecule acceptor ITIC were developed. PM6 possesses a strong absorption in the short wavelength region of 300–685 nm with a large bandgap of 1.80 eV, which is complementary to that of ITIC (1.55 eV) and facilitates achieving high short-circuit current (Jsc) in PSCs. Moreover, PM6 shows a deep HOMO level of −5.50 eV, a strong crystallinity and a dominant face on packing, which helps to achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) in PSCs. As a result, the PM6:ITIC-based PSCs obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% with a Voc of up to 1.04 V, a Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Notably, the energy loss (Eloss) of the PSCs is as low as 0.51 eV, which is smaller than the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV. The PCE of 9.7% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for PSCs with a Voc over 1.0 V and an Eloss less than 0.55 eV.
Introduction
As a promising clean-energy technology, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have shown considerable potential for application in flexible and semitransparent large-area solar cell panels by simple solution-processing methods.1–4 As we know, the three key parameters that determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs are open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).5–7 And these parameters can be effectively promoted simultaneously or separately by tuning molecular absorption, energy levels and charge mobilities of the organic photovoltaic materials.8–12 Over the past few years, for PSCs based on the most widely used fullerene derivatives as electron acceptor materials, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM),13–16 much work has focused on the design and synthesis of highly efficient donor polymers and PCEs of over 11% in PSCs have been achieved.17,18 However, further promotion of device efficiency faces enormous challenges due to the large energy loss (Eloss) and the tradeoff between Voc and Jsc in fullerene-based PSCs.19
Recently, nonfullerene (NF) small molecules (SMs) have flourished as promising electron acceptor materials in PSCs due to their distinctive advantages of highly adjustable absorption and frontier energy levels, and stable morphology.19–38 To date, the efficiencies of NF-PSCs based on SM-acceptors have been rapidly increased up to 10–13%.26–38 Among the NF-SMs, an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type low bandgap (LBG) SM-acceptor named ITIC (see Fig. 1a) has become one of the dominant acceptors for efficient PSCs due to its broad absorption spectrum and high extinction coefficient.20 When ITIC is blended with wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors to form a bulk active layer with complementary absorption, the PSCs tends to attain high Jsc and PCE values.19,26–29 For example, Li et al. reported a WBG donor polymer named J71, and the polymer possesses complementary absorption to ITIC in the wavelength region of ca. 300–800 nm. As a result, the J71:ITIC-based PSCs exhibited a high PCE of 11.41% with a high Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2.19a In our previous work, efficient ITIC-based PSCs with a PCE of 10.5% and a Jsc of up to 19.0 mA cm−2 were also obtained by using a spectral complementary strategy.29a However, although previously reported ITIC-based PSCs have gained high Jsc and PCE values, their lower Voc values of 0.85–0.95 V still limit the further improvement of efficiencies in PSCs due to the ubiquitous existence of a tradeoff between Voc and Jsc in PSCs.19,27–29

As is known to all, the Voc in PSCs is proportional to the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor.39 To gain high Voc in PSCs, researchers have done a lot of work and found that the Voc values of the devices increase gradually with decreasing ΔEHOMO (HOMOdonor–HOMOacceptor) between the polymer and ITIC.19,26a Our recent work shows that PSCs can attain a high Voc of 1.01 V and a high Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2 simultaneously, when the corresponding ΔEHOMO of 0.18 eV is less than the empirical value of 0.3 eV of the minimum driving force for exciton dissociation (holes hop from the HOMO of ITIC to the HOMO of the polymer donor).26a Li et al. found that PSCs can still achieve a high Voc of 0.94 V and a high Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2 simultaneously even if the corresponding ΔEHOMO is reduced to 0.11 eV.19a The above results imply that the exciton dissociation only requires a low driving force in ITIC-based PSC systems, and provides a simple and effective strategy to minimize the tradeoff between the Voc and Jsc by introducing a WBG polymer donor with a deep HOMO level to match ITIC in order to gain complementary absorption and small ΔEHOMO in PSCs. However, although high Voc is extremely important for practical applications of high-performance PSCs, efficient ITIC-based PSCs with a Voc over 1 V have still been rarely reported to date,26 because too small ΔEHOMO may hinder the exciton dissociation in devices. Therefore, developing efficient ITIC-based PSCs with a Voc over 1 V is an interesting but challenging topic.
Here, efficient NF-PSCs containing a WBG polymer donor PM6 (ref. 40) with a fluorinated-thienyl benzodithiophene (BDT-2F) unit and a SM-acceptor ITIC20 (see Fig. 1a) were fabricated. The absorption spectrum of the PM6 film is complementary to that of the ITIC film from 300 to 800 nm (Fig. 1b), which facilitates achieving high Jsc in PSCs. The PM6:ITIC blend possesses a very small ΔEHOMO of 0.10 eV (Fig. 1c) due to the deep HOMO level of PM6, which helps to gain a high Voc and lowers the Eloss during the exciton dissociation in PSCs.19,26a Moreover, our previous work showed that PM6 has strong crystallinity and a dominant face on packing, which facilitates achieving high charge mobilities in PM6:ITIC-based PSCs.40 As a result, the PM6:ITIC-based PSCs displayed a PCE of 9.7% with a Voc of up to 1.04 V, a Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2, and an Eloss as low as 0.51 eV, simultaneously. The PCE of 9.7% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V and an Eloss less than 0.55 eV.
Results and discussion
An inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:ITIC/MoO3/Al was fabricated for the NF-PSCs, where the ZnO and MoO3 were inserted as the cathode and anode interlayers, respectively. The influence of the D/A weight ratios (PM6:ITIC, w/w) from 1:1 to 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (CB) on the device photovoltaic performance was probed first (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). It was found that all devices exhibited a high Voc of 1.03–1.05 V, which is significantly higher than that of the analogous polymer PBDB-T with a Voc of 0.899 V and is consistent with the variation of the HOMO levels.28a Moreover, the PSCs with an optimal D/A ratio of 1:1 displayed the highest PCE of 8.6% with a Voc of 1.04 V. And then, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) with a high boiling point was used to optimize the blend morphology for gaining more efficient PSCs. It was found that blending 0.5% DIO into the CB blend solution can improve the PCEs of the PSCs from 8.6% to 9.3% due to the increased Jsc from 14.7 to 15.8 mA cm−2, and almost constant Voc and FF values (see Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). Subsequently, thermal annealing experiments at different temperatures in a glovebox were carried out to optimize the device performances (see Fig. S3 and Table S3, ESI†), and found that the PM6:ITIC blends annealed at 100 °C for 10 min can also improve the PCE (9.7%) of the PSCs due to the slightly increased Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 58% simultaneously.

Fig. 2a summarizes the current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the PSCs based on PM6:ITIC (1:1, w/w) with the different processing conditions, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. As we know, the PCE of 9.7% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for PSCs with a Voc more than 1.0 V and an Eloss less than 0.55 eV. Moreover, for charge mobility experiments using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S4, ESI†),29,39 the devices with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min show higher hole/electron (μh/μe) mobilities of 6.08/5.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.11 compared to the devices with 0.5% DIO (4.55/3.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.27) and the as-cast devices (3.04/2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.24), which is in agreement with the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the devices was measured to confirm the Jsc in PSCs (see Fig. 2b). All the devices exhibit a wide EQE photo-response in the wavelength region of 305–800 nm, and the highest EQE values reached 66%, 68% and 71% for the PSCs as-cast, with 0.5% DIO, and with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min respectively, indicating efficient photon harvesting and charge collection in the PSCs.19,29 Moreover, the PSC with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min shows higher EQE values in the wavelength range of 530–730 nm than other PSCs as-cast or with 0.5% DIO. Notably, these PSCs display high EQE values in the region of 655–800 nm that belongs to ITIC, which implies that efficient hole transfer occurred from ITIC to PM6 despite the ΔEHOMO between ITIC and PM6 being only 0.10 eV.19,26 The errors between the integral Jsc from the EQE curves and the measured Jsc values are below 5%.
To further probe the influence of the different processing conditions on the charge generation and extraction mechanism of the PSCs, the photo-current density (Jph, defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark) versus effective voltage (Veff, defined as V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is 0, and Vappl is the applied bias voltage) of the devices was investigated (see Fig. 2c).41 In this case, the Jph can reach the saturation current density (Jsat) conditions at high Veff ≥ 2 V. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) are determined from the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Under the maximum power output conditions, Pdiss values were calculated to be 82.5%, 85.0% and 86.5% for the devices based on PM6:ITIC blends as-cast, with 0.5% DIO, and with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, respectively. The higher Pdiss implies that the device with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min has more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction, which agrees with the fact that the related PSC has a high PCE value.
The Jph values under different light intensities (P) were measured to probe the charge recombination mechanism in the PSCs. By convention, the relationship between Jph and P is defined as Jph ∝ PS.41 If the electrodes are able to sweep out and collect all free carriers before recombination, the slope (S) should be equal to 1, while S less than 1 implies the existence of bimolecular recombination. The S values of the fitted linear lines in logarithmic coordinates for the devices as-cast, with 0.5% DIO, and with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min are 0.983, 0.993 and 0.999, respectively. The higher S value for the device with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min means less bimolecular recombination in PSCs, which agrees with the fact that the related PSC has balanced carrier mobilities and should partially account for the higher FF and Jsc.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PM6, ITIC and the related blend films were measured to investigate the photo-induced charge transfer behavior between PM6 and ITIC (see Fig. 2e–f). The blend films with extra treatments exhibited higher PL quenching efficiencies of more than 90% (90.8–93.4%) compared to the blend film as-cast (85.7–88.8%). Moreover, compared to the non-annealed blend film, the annealed blend film displays higher PL quenching efficiencies. High PL quenching efficiency implies that the blend film with 0.5% DIO and annealing at 100 °C for 10 min has more efficient photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and ITIC in PSCs, which is in agreement with the high Jsc in PSCs.
The surface and bulk morphologies of blend films in PSCs were probed by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. In the AFM images (Fig. 3a–c), with DIO or combinations of DIO and annealing treatments, the blend films show a gradual increased root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value from 1.29 to 1.57 nm, which is probably due to the enhanced intermolecular aggregation effect and increased crystallinity of PM6 and ITIC in the blend films by extra treatments. In the TEM images (Fig. 3d–f), the blend films as-cast showed no apparent phase separation. With DIO or combinations of DIO and annealing treatments, the blend films showed obvious phase separation with fiber structures, which is consistent with the AFM tests and facilitates the charge separation and transport in PSCs.

Fig. 4a summarizes the correlation of eVoc with the optical bandgap (Eoptg) obtained in this work and comparison with the other PSCs with PCEs of over 8% based on the polymer:NF-acceptor (see Table S4 for details, ESI†). The major PCE reduction in the PSCs is due to the Voc loss for most cases. As shown in Fig. 4, the majority of the devices display an Eloss (Eloss, defined as Eoptg − eVoc) of over 0.6 eV of the empirical limit. Only few D/A pairs with suitable energy levels have been applied to minimize the Eloss and maximize the Voc. Herein, we have successfully developed a D/A pair which can obtain high photovoltage at low voltage loss. The PSC exhibits an Eloss as low as 0.51 eV due to the small Eoptg (1.55 eV) of the ITIC film and the high Voc (1.04 V) of the device, which is much smaller than that of the other polymer:ITIC-based PSCs with a similar Eoptg.19–21,26–29 However, it is usually difficult to obtain high EQE values for PSCs at low Eloss due to the tradeoff between Voc and Jsc values. Recent results indicated that higher EQE values close to 70% can be gained at Eloss less than 0.6 eV in PSCs by using reasonable matching D/A pairs.7,22a,26a,35,38 In this work, the PSCs still achieve a high EQEmax of 71% and a PCE of 9.7% when the Eloss of 0.51 eV is even far lower than the empirical limit of 0.6 eV (Fig. 4b–c). Such a small Eloss along with high EQEmax and PCE values in PSCs benefitted from the very small ΔEHOMO of 0.10 eV between PM6 and ITIC.19,26

Conclusions
High-performance PSCs based on a WBG polymer donor PM6 containing a BDT-2F unit and an n-type SM-acceptor ITIC were developed. The PM6 possesses a deep HOMO level of −5.50 eV, and complementary absorption spectra to ITIC in the wavelength region of ca. 300–800 nm, which helps to gain high Voc and Jsc values in the PM6:ITIC-based PSCs simultaneously. As a result, the PSCs gained a PCE of 9.7% with a Voc of up to 1.04 V and a high Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2. Notably, the Eloss of the PSCs is as low as 0.51 eV, which is smaller than the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV. The PCE of 9.7% is one of the highest values reported in the literature for PSCs with a Voc over 1.0 V and an Eloss less than 0.55 eV.
