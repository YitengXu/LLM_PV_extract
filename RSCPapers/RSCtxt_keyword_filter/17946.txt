    , Accepted 17th October 2016First published on 21st October 2016AbstractThe intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of allenol esters, which were in situ generated by Pt-catalyzed 1,3-acyloxy migration of propargylic esters, with C60 proceeded regio- and stereo-selectively to give a novel class of alkylidenecyclobutane-annulated fullerenes. The cyclobutane-annulated fullerene derivatives have high-lying LUMO levels, which gave a high open-circuit voltage in organic solar cell applications. The observed high electron mobility provided a good fill factor compared with the PCBM-based devices.
Ring annulated fullerenes have attracted considerable attention because PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), which is a cyclopropane-annulated fullerene, displays outstanding performance as a material for organic photovoltaics (OPVs).1 In this research field, we are particularly interested in functionalized cyclobutane-annulated fullerenes. Despite the tremendous efforts devoted to the synthesis of cyclobutane annulated fullerenes based on [2+2] cycloaddition reactions,2,3 application studies as a material for OPVs were still insufficient to discover a cyclobutane-annulated fullerene that exhibits a high performance as a material. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that studies on cyclopropane- or cyclopentane-annulated fullerenes have been pursued vigorously.4
In this study, encouraged by the recent progress in the in situ generation of allenol esters from propargylic esters by transition-metal catalysts (Scheme 1),5–9 we envisaged the [2+2] cycloaddition of in situ generated allenol esters with C60, which would give a novel class of alkylidenecyclobutane-annulated fullerenes.
 Scheme 1  Transition-metal catalyzed 1,3-acyloxy migration of propargylic esters. 
In the first investigation, when a mixture of propargylic ester 1a and C60 was treated with 0.5 equiv. of AuCl(PPh)3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at 80 °C for 6 h, no reaction took place (Table 1, entry 1).10 However, when we used PtCl2 as a catalyst for 1,3-acyloxy migration of 1a under similar conditions, the [2+2] cycloaddition product 2a was obtained in 21% yield as a single isomer (Table 1, entry 2). Prolonging the reaction time to 18 h resulted in a significant improvement in the yield of 2a to 47% (Table 1, entry 3). The amount of PtCl2 was reduced to 0.1 equiv. without a decrease in the yield (Table 1, entries 4 and 5). In entry 4, the isolated yield of 2a was 31%, whereas the yield based on the amount of C60 consumed was 67%. In the case of entries 2–5, multiple cycloaddition products were also detected as side products by LC-MS analysis. The structure of 2a was characterized using HRMS and NMR techniques (1H, 13C, DEPT, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY) after purification using silica-gel column chromatography (see the ESI†). The geometry of the product 2a was the Z-isomer, which was presumably because of the steric repulsion between the Bu group and C60.

Having adopted the optimized conditions mentioned in entry 4, we next explored the scope of the intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with C60. The reaction of 1b with C60 gave the corresponding [2+2] cycloaddition product 2b in 40% yield (Table 2, entry 1). The propargylic ester 1c bearing a p-chlorophenyl group also reacted with C60 to afford 2c in 31% yield (entry 2). The propargylic ester 1d bearing a 2-thienyl group displayed higher reactivity than 1a, and in this case, a large amount of multiple cycloaddition products was also formed (entry 3). The terminal acetylene 1e tolerated the reaction conditions to furnish the corresponding [2+2] cycloaddition product 2e in 33% yield. The geometry of the product 2e was E-isomer due to the steric repulsion of the OPiv group towards the fullerene ring (entry 4).

We also examined the propargylic ester 1f having a phenyl acetylene moiety (Scheme 2-1). Surprisingly, in this case, the fullerene 3a, which was derived via [2+2] cycloaddition with the pivaloxyalkene portion, was obtained in 42% yield regio- and stereo-selectively. The 1,3-diphenyl-substituted propargylic ester 1g also afforded the similar cyclobutanol-annulated fullerene 3b, albeit in low yield. In this case, the conversion of C60 was low (HPLC analysis: 3b/multiple cycloaddition products/C60 = 12/13/70) and a [2+2] dimerization product of the in situ generated allenol ester was observed (Scheme 2-2).8

Using a similar protocol, the propargylic carbonate 4 was successfully reacted with C60 to give the corresponding adduct 5 in 41% yield, which was further converted into the ketone 6 by acidic treatment with TsOH·H2O (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Reaction of C60 with carbonate 4 to give 5 and 6. 
To confirm the stepwise reaction via the formation of an allenol ester, we carried out the reaction of C60 with the isolated allenol ester 1a′, which was obtained by the Pt-catalyzed 1,3-acyloxy migration of 1a and purified by silica filtration to remove PtCl2. As we expected, the product 2a was obtained in 30% yield (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Control experiments. 
A plausible mechanism for the present cycloaddition is illustrated in Scheme 5. The activation of the propargylic ester 1a by the platinum catalyst would induce a 1,3-acyloxy migration to generate the allenol ester 1a′. A single-electron transfer (SET) from the aryl group of allenol ester 1a′ to C60 would then occur to give a radical ion pair11,12,13,14 consisting of the radical anion C60˙− and a radical cation of 1a′. The radical anion C60˙− would react regioselectively with the radical cation of 1a′ to give the [2+2] cycloaddition product 2avia the zwitterionic intermediate A (Scheme 5, path 1 for 2a). In the case of 1f, which gave a regioisomer, a similar zwitterionic intermediate B would be formed via a SET pathway from the aryl group of the allenol ester 1f′ to C60 to give 3a (path 2 for 3a). We deem that in both cases SET with the benzene ring is crucial for the regioselective reaction.
 Scheme 5  Plausible mechanism. 
To determine the physical properties of the alkylidenecyclobutane-annulated fullerenes prepared in this study, we chose 2a and the hydrolyzed ketone 6 as model probes. Optical bandgaps were derived from the UV-visible absorption spectra of 2a and 6 (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI†), which were 1.71 eV for both compounds. The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated from the DPV data. The LUMO levels of 2a and 6 (−3.71 and −3.69 eV, respectively) were higher than those of PC61BM (−3.74 eV for PCBM, determined by CV in dichloromethane).15 These results promise to provide a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) in organic solar cell applications.
We investigated the photovoltaic performance of the obtained fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors in standard bulk heterojunction organic solar cells using P3HT as an electron donor (Table 3, Fig. 1). Solubilities of these electron acceptors in organic aromatic solvents were respectable, which were similar to PCBM, enabling thin-film fabrication with active layer solvents at similar concentrations for the standard P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction devices. First of all, we examined donor:acceptor ratios in the photoactive layer from 5:3 to 2:3. The best donor:acceptor ratio for devices using 2a was 1:1, whereas that for devices employing 6 was 5:4. Notably, these ratios are almost the same as the ratio in a P3HT:PCBM device. The devices were thermally annealed at 120 °C. The obtained VOC of devices using 2a (0.60 ± 0.004 V) was slightly higher than that of a device using PCBM (0.58 V) because of the high-lying LUMO levels of this fullerene derivative. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of P3HT:2a and P3HT:6 were 0.95 ± 0.015% and 2.64 ± 0.020%, respectively. The low PCE of the device using 2 is attributable to the large volume of the Piv group, which hampers fullerene–fullerene interactions.16 With 6 exhibiting the best performance, we tried to increase the PCE of the P3HT:6 device by modifying the solution concentration of the active layer and the annealing temperature after spin-coating. The PCE reached 2.96 ± 0.05% (the best performance was 3.00%) with a good fill factor (FF, 0.65) and short-circuit current density (JSC, 8.60 mA cm−2) when the concentration was 30 mg mL−1, and the annealing temperature was 150 °C. We fabricated devices employing these conditions with other fullerene derivatives, but the PCE decreased because their solubility was lower than that of 6. Finally, we used the low band-gap polymer PTB7 as an electron donor instead of P3HT and obtained a PCE of 3.78% with a VOC of 0.74 V, JSC of 8.28 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.62 without using additives (Table 3). The PCE was higher than that of a device using PC61BM17 (PCE = 3.6%, VOC = 0.71 V, JSC = 9.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.53) with a good VOC and FF.

We hypothesized that the relatively high FFs compared with those of PCBM devices were derived from the high electron mobility of 6 or good film morphology. The electron mobility of the electron-only devices was measured using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI†). The device structures were Al/active layer/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al. The electron mobilities of the P3HT:6 and PTB7:6 devices were 1.3 × 10−4 and 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the active-layer film thickness of 310 and 150 nm, respectively. These electron mobilities were higher than those obtained from P3HT:PCBM and PTB7:PCBM electron-only devices.18 The morphologies of the P3HT:6 devices were investigated by atomic force microscopy (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†). In agreement with the performance obtained for the devices annealed at 120 and 150 °C, high temperature annealing increased the surface roughness, which probably led to a good FF and mobility. On the other hand, the PTB7:6 film had a smoother surface compared with the P3HT:6 film. This implies the high miscibility of PTB7 and 6. We ascribe this to the high solubility of 6.
In conclusion, we have developed the regio- and stereo-selective intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of in situ generated allenol esters with C60. For the regioselective cycloaddition of allenol esters with C60, we proposed pathways involving a radical ion-pair formed by a SET process. Measuring the physical properties of 2a and ketone 6 for comparison with PCBM, we obtained a respectable PCE of 3.78% using PTB7 with ketone 6 with a good VOC (0.74 V) and FF (0.62), which were derived from the high-lying LUMO level and higher electron mobility of ketone 6, respectively (VOC and FF of a PC61BM device are 0.71 V and 0.53, respectively).

The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenol ester with isocyanate, which gave β-lactam, was known.   J. D. Buynak, M. N. Rao, H. Pajouhesh, R. Y. Chandrasekaran and K. Finn, J. Org. Chem., 1985, 50, 4245–4252 CrossRef CAS .
The reaction product of propargylic ester with allenol ester was obtained in the presence of AuCl(PPh3)3. In the case of using AuCl(PPh3)3/AgOTf or AgSbF6 as a catalyst, same results were obtained. This gold catalysed reaction has been already reported in ref. 8. See the ESI† for details of a survey of catalyst and solvent.
In the case of using undec-6-yn-5-yl pivalate as an aliphatic substrate, despite the corresponding allenol ester was observed, the desired product was not obtained and all C60 was recovered. This result exhibits that the nucleophilic attack of allenol esters to C60 does not seem to be involved in the reaction mechanism because the aliphatic allenol ester generally shows the same nucleophilicity as the aromatic allenol ester (see ref. 7).
In the chemistry of fullerenes, many reactions of C60via single-electron transfer (SET) process are known. See: ref. 4.
It is well known that C60 acts as an effective electron transfer (ET) inhibitor (see ref. 4b). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no examples that ET scavenger has acted as the inhibiter effectively in the reaction of C60via SET. Actually, although we used an excess amount of 1,4-dinitrobenzen as an ET scavenger under the conditions of Table 2, the yield of the reaction of 1b with C60 did not decrease.
It has been reported that the reaction of C60via the formation of a radical ion pair is not affected by the presence of a TEMPO as a radical inhibitor. We obtained the same result by using the excess amount of a TEMPO in our [2+2] cycloaddition. See:   H. Tokuyama, H. Isobe and E. Nakamura, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1994, 2753–2754 RSC .
LUMO level (eV) = −(4.8 + the first half-wave reduction potential vs. Fc/Fc+). This method depends on the choice of solvent, e.g., −3.61, −3.74, and −3.80 eV for 1,2-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and THF, respectively. Comparison is meaningful only when the same solvent is used.
