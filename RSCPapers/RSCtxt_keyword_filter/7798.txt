    , Accepted 23rd May 2019First published on 23rd May 2019AbstractHybrid perovskite-type light absorbers, notably based on methylammonium or formamidinium, have promising application in optoelectronics; however they are notorious for their characteristic low moisture stabilities and monotonous band gaps. Constructing new stability-enhanced hybrid lead iodine perovskites (HLIPs) with desired band gaps is imperative, but still a critical challenge. Herein, we demonstrate two effective strategies, which provide new ways to solve the above two issues. The “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy is aimed to enhance the stability of HLIPs by prohibiting organic components from forming strong hydrogen bonds with external water molecules. The “dual-iodine” strategy is used for the synthesis of stable HLIPs with reduced band gaps, which indicates that the I-coordinated metal complex can strongly reconstruct both the bottom of conduction bands (CBs) and the top of valence bands (VBs) of the inorganic lead iodine skeleton to reduce the band gaps. As a proof-of-concept application, ambient-stable HLIPs (1,1′-diethyl-[2,2′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium)Pb3I8 (denoted as EtBpy-Pb3I8) and [Cu(2,2′-bipyridine)2I]2Pb2I6 (denoted as CuIBpy-Pb2I6) are synthesized, which can endure a relative humidity (RH) of 100% and sunlight irradiation for at least 60 days. Both EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 show good photoconduction behavior with short rise and decay recovery time, and exhibit excellent repeatabilities of photocurrent. This work not only provides two new promising stability-enhanced lead-based semiconductors for light absorption application, but also opens new ways to enhance the stabilities and tune the band gaps of HLIPs.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite absorbers, especially hybrid lead halide perovskites, have received enormous interest owing to their remarkable physical properties and low-cost solution fabrication processing, both of which are favorable for optoelectronic1–8 and photocatalytic applications.9–11 In just a few years, hybrid lead halide perovskite absorbers have endowed the perovskite solar cells with an astonishing increase of power conversion efficiency presently exceeding 23%.12 Despite the substantial success, hybrid lead halide perovskite absorbers still face great challenges including (1) characteristic low moisture stabilities, which prevent them from competing with the established technologies, and also make the toxicity of lead non-negligible and (2) being underpowered to meet all the requirements for tunable band gaps,13 which restricts their widespread applications.
Several strategies have been applied to tune the band gaps or influence the optical absorption of hybrid lead iodine perovskite (HLIP) absorbers, including (1) changing the organic cations;14–17 (2) substituting Pb with other metals;18,19 (3) substituting I− with Br−, SCN− or others;20–22 and (4) introducing additional triiodine or iodine molecules into the crystal lattice.23 Among them, substituting an organic cation is the most anticipated way to get tunable band gaps, due to the adoption of so many different types of organic species.24 However, previously used substitutes are always confined to organic amine-type cations e.g., RNH3+ (R = Et, Pr, Bu, Ph), Me2NH2+, Me3NH+ and guanidinium, which have relatively poor band-gap tenability to HLIPs.25,26 The employment of function-enhanced organic species e.g., a N-heteroaromatic molecule or its complex to design HLIPs with tunable band gaps is limited; in particular, their peculiar mechanism to tune the band gaps of HLIPs has not been documented in detail.27–33 Most importantly, the mixed tin lead perovskite MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 has a small band gap of ∼1.2 eV; however there is still no guiding strategy for the synthesis of HLIPs with band gaps lower than this value, despite the fact that such narrowest band-gap materials are required for a rear cell in all-perovskite tandem cells.13
On the other hand, HLIPs based on methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or their mixtures are the most studied light absorbing materials. They are famous for the ascending power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells that other absorbers cannot exhibit. However, these absorbing materials are notorious for low moisture stabilities, which stem from the hydrophilic characteristic of ammonium cations.13 A straightforward strategy to enhance the moisture stabilities of HLIPs is employing hydrophobic organic species e.g., N-heteroaromatic molecules to replace MA and FA. However, such heteroaromatic molecules always perform N-protonation reactions to possess positive charges, which will still form inescapable N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds with external water molecules and thus results in imperfect moisture stability.34,35 Given the above discussion, it is urgent to propose new strategies to construct HLIP absorbers simultaneously with desired band gaps and enhanced moisture stabilities.
Herein, two strategies were proposed for the above two issues (Scheme 1). The “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy that proposes introducing N-alkylation or N-metal coordination reactions on N-heteroaromatic molecules to preclude the N atoms from forming N–H⋯O typical hydrogen bonds with external water molecules36–38 was used to design two moisture stable hybrid lead iodines, namely (1,1′-diethyl-[2,2′-bipyridine]-1,1′-diium)Pb3I8 (denoted as EtBpy-Pb3I8) and [CuII(2,2′-bipyridine)2I]2Pb2I6 (denoted as CuIBpy-Pb2I6). Both materials can endure a relative humidity (RH) of 100% and direct sunlight irradiation for at least 60 days. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the “dual-iodine” strategy, combining iodine coordinated complex cations with the inorganic metal iodine framework in one crystal lattice, was effective in reducing the band gaps. In this case, CuIBpy-Pb2I6 achieves a band gap of 0.89 eV, representing the narrowest band gap for HLIPs. Therefore, the present work not only recommends two important hybrid lead iodines for light absorption applications, but also paves new ways to get stable HLIPs with tunable band gaps.

Results and discussion
Structural description for EtBpy-Pb3I8

EtBpy-Pb3I8 has an unprecedented crystal structure and was reported for the first time (Table 1). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis discloses that it crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and is composed of one-dimensional (1D) (Pb3I8)2− anionic chains and bivalent (Et2Bpy)2+ cations (Fig. 1a and b). The asymmetric unit consists of three crystallographically distinct Pb2+ ions, eight I− ions and one (Et2Bpy)2+ cation. The Pb atoms are all in octahedral environments formed by one It atom (terminal I), three μ2-I and two μ4-I atoms for Pb1 and Pb3 atoms, and two μ2-I and four μ4-I atoms for Pb2 atoms. As illustrated in Fig. S2a (ESI‡), the (Pb3I8)2− chain can be described as being built from stacks of the trinuclear (Pb3I14) units, each of which contains three edge-sharing distorted (PbI6) octahedra. Such building units stack with each other through sharing six Pb–I bonds to generate a zigzag-like chain propagating along the a direction. The Pb–μ4-I bond distances with a mean value of 3.369 Å are significantly longer than the Pb–μ2-I bond distances with a mean value of 3.174 Å and the Pb–It distances with a mean value of 2.998 Å (Fig. 1e and Table S8, ESI‡).38 The N-ethylated Bpy cations with a dihedral angle of ca. 82.68(8)° between the two pyridine planes stacked in an orderly way along the a axis to form the (Et2Bpy)n2n+ organic cation columns. Six such organic columns aggregate parallelly to generate a tube-like structure, which holds the inorganic (Pb3I8)2− anionic chain (Fig. S2b, ESI‡). As shown in Fig. S2c and d (ESI‡), there are abundant C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds between the inorganic chain and the organic tube-like structure. Each (Pb3I13) building unit in the inorganic chain utilizes one μ2-I and two It atoms connecting with three (Et2Bpy)2+ cations on the inner wall of the organic tube to stabilize the three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular structure (Fig. S2c and d, ESI‡). Remarkably, EtBpy-Pb3I8 contains an unprecedented inorganic (Pb3I8)2− anionic chain. Fig. 1c and d give a convenient diagrammatic representation of the stacking pattern observed for the (Pb3I8)2− chain. The Geiser notation, which was first introduced to specify the stacking patterns for pseudoplanar halogencuprate oligomers,39,40 can also be applied to the lead iodine chain here, yielding an unprecedented 3(1/2, −1/2)(1/2, 1/2) stacking designation.41

Structural descriptions for EtBpy-Pb2I6, CuIBpy-Pb2I6 and bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6
The three materials crystallize in different centrosymmetric space groups of orthorhombic Pbca for EtBpy-Pb2I6, monoclinic P21/c for CuIBpy-Pb2I6, and triclinic P for bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6. The crystal structures of EtBpy-Pb2I6 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 have been reported,33,38 so they were only described briefly here. The three hybrid materials all contain the 1D chain-like (Pb2I6)4− polyanion, charge compensated by different N-heteroaromatically derived cations, namely alkylated Bpy cations, I-coordinated Cu Bpy cations, and I, Cl-bridged binuclear Mn phen cations (Fig. 2). The (Pb2I6)4− anionic chain was constructed by the (PbI6) octahedra sharing the two opposite edges with neighboring units. The 1D (Pb2I6)2− chains expand along the b, c and the [−110] direction with diameters of 5.165, 5.115, and 5.477 Å, respectively. The Pb–I–Pb bond angles are comparable with each other, which are in the ranges of 74.04(1)–76.75(1)°, 73.89(1)–76.41(1)°, and 74.72(1)–78.96°, respectively.

EtBpy-Pb2I6 contains a similar N-ethylated cation (Et2Bpy)2+ to that in EtBpy-Pb3I8. A dihedral angle of ca. 81.56(17)° between the two pyridine planes is slightly smaller than that of 82.68(8)° in EtBpy-Pb3I8. The (Et2Bpy)2+ cations aggregate in a side by side pattern to afford organic (Et2Bpy)n2n+ columns along the b direction. The (Pb2I6)2− chains reside in the elliptic-like channels formed by the parallel aggregation of six (Et2Bpy)n2n+ columns (Fig. S4, ESI‡).
In CuIBpy-Pb2I6, the mononuclear complex cation is formed by two chelating Bpy ligands and a monodentate I− ion around a Cu(II) center in a quadrangular pyramid configuration, as shown in Fig. 2d. As demonstrated in Fig. S5a (ESI‡), two neighboring mononuclear Cu complexes interact with each other through π⋯π stacking interactions with a centroid to centroid distance of 3.652 Å to form a [CuII(Bpy)2I]22+ pair. The (Pb2I6)2− chain connects with the [CuII(Bpy)2I]22+ pairs via C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds to form hybrid supramolecular layers parallel to the bc plane, which are further stacked together along the a axis to form a 3D supramolecular structure (Fig. S5b, ESI‡). The nearly no residual electron density suggests no unidentified solvent molecules in the supramolecular framework.33
Interestingly, the binuclear Mn complex cations reside in the crystal structure of bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6, which represents the first example of utilizing binuclear metal complex cations with aromatic ligands to synthesize hybrid lead iodine.42 As shown in Fig. 2e, each Mn center is coordinated by four N atoms from two chelating Phen ligands to form an unsaturated [Mn(Phen)2]2+ moiety. The I− and Cl− ions are located at different distorted sites, both as bridging atoms linking two [Mn(Phen)2]2+ moieties to form the [MnII(Phen)2Cl0.65I0.35]22+ cation. The π⋯π stacking interactions between the two aromatic rings of neighboring Phen ligands link the binuclear Mn complex cations to form 1D supramolecular [MnII(Phen)2Cl0.65I0.35]2n2n+ chains extending along the [2–10] direction (Fig. S6a, ESI‡). Furthermore, such supramolecular cationic chains aggregate side by side in the ab plane to form a two-dimensional (2D) metal complex cationic layer (Fig. S6b, ESI‡). The inorganic (Pb2I6)2− chain was sandwiched between two cationic layers that stacked along the c axis (Fig. S6c, ESI‡).
Optical properties
The optical band gap is one of the fundamental properties of HLIP absorbers. Solid state UV-vis absorption spectra of the four materials and inorganic bulk PbI2 calculated from the diffuse reflectance data by using the Kubelka–Munk function are plotted in Fig. 3a, where the photographs of the single crystals of the four materials are inserted. CuIBpy-Pb2I6 shows a black colour, while the other three hybrids are yellow-coloured; all the colours coincide with their band gaps. It can be seen that hybrids EtBpy-Pb3I8, EtBpy-Pb2I6, and bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6 have similar band gaps of 2.35 eV, 2.41 eV, and 2.39 eV, respectively, which exhibit a slight blue shift compared with the measured value of 2.30 eV for bulk PbI2. This is ascribed to the quantum confinement effects, where the excitons were confined within the inorganic lead iodine components in these hybrid materials.43–45 All the band gaps are smaller than those of the 1D hybrid lead iodines directed by aliphatic amine cations (usually above 2.5 eV), such as [(Hen)4(H2.5O)2I]PbI6 (2.87 eV), (H3tepa)PbI5 (2.85 eV)38 and (Bz2dabco)Pb2I6·0.5H2O (2.62 eV),46 suggesting an enhanced visible light absorption by introducing N-heteroaromatic derived cations. The band gaps are also close to the value of 3D lead bromine semiconducting absorber MAPbBr3 (2.30 eV), forecasting its comparable optical absorptions.

(b) A detailed optical absorption spectrum of powdery CuIBpy-Pb2I6 showing the MLCT and XLCT absorption of the I-coordinated Cu complex. (c) Comparison of the band gaps of the four hybrids in this work (dark red bars) with the mostly reported widely used perovskite absorbers. The detailed band-gap values are summarized in Table S6 (ESI‡). (d) The partial density of states (pDOS) of CuIBpy-Pb2I6. Sa–e represents the maxima of the density of states in the corresponding regions. 
Noticeably, CuIBpy-Pb2I6 shows two main absorptions, with absorption cutoff energies of 0.89 eV and 1.79 eV, respectively, which show 1.41 eV and 0.51 eV red shifts compared with the absorption of bulk PbI2 (Fig. 3a). From the structural point of view, all the four hybrids have 1D inorganic lead iodine chains at the nanoscale; the main difference of CuIBpy-Pb2I6 from the other three materials is a Cu-based complex counter cation. Generally, copper complexes with heteroaromatic ligands are reported to have significant absorption in the visible light region due to metal-to-ligand charge transition (MLCT).47 In this case, the MLCT absorption occurred near to the near-IR region with maxima at 759 nm and 1005 nm, as shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S7 (ESI‡). The red-shift of the Cu-complex MLCT leads to the absorption of the nearly full visible spectrum and even expands to the infra-red region, which makes CuIBpy-Pb2I6 the most promising candidate for full spectrum (UV, visible and near-IR) absorbing materials. Although a similar red-shift of the MLCT absorption can also be found in a recently reported copper bromide coordination polymer,47 the Cu-based complex has never been proposed as a band-gap regulator for a hybrid perovskite absorber. The band gap of CuIBpy-Pb2I6 was deduced as 0.89 eV, which is obviously smaller than that of the methylamine perovskite absorber MAPbI3 of 1.55 eV, and those of other well-known perovskites, such as FAPbI3 (1.48 eV) and the mixed tin lead perovskite MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 (1.17 eV, Fig. 3d). Accordingly, CuIBpy-Pb2I6 represents the narrowest band gap for hybrid lead halides. The above results preliminarily indicate that the band gaps of HLIPs can be regulated by the incorporation of N-heteroaromatic derived cations into the inorganic lead iodine skeletons. In particular, the I-coordinated Cu heteroaromatic complex could significantly reduce the band gaps, and hence greatly enhance the light absorption of HLIPs. In addition to the different optical contributions from organic counter cations, EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 also have different absorption features in the visible light region (Fig. 3a), which is ascribed to the electronic communication between different organic and inorganic moieties.
Electronic structure calculations
To understand the optical spectra and disclose the roles of N-heteroaromatically derived cations to tune the band gaps, theoretical calculations, which include band structures along with high symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone, as well as density of states, were performed using the CASTEP code (Fig. 3d, 4 and Fig. S8, ESI‡). The calculated band gaps using the local density approximation (LDA) are 1.86 eV for EtBpy-Pb3I8, 1.35 eV for EtBpy-Pb2I6, 0.90 eV for CuIBpy-Pb2I6, and 1.62 eV for bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6. The band-structure plots suggest that except for EtBpy-Pb2I6 being an indirect band-gap material, the other three hybrids are all direct band-gap materials, where the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum are located at the same K point.
 Fig. 4  Band structures (left side) and PDOS (right side) of (a) EtBpy-Pb3I8, (b) EtBpy-Pb2I6, (c) CuIBpy-Pb2I6 and (d) bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6. The inserted FMOs of N-heteroaromatically derived cations between the top of VBs and the bottom of CBs are marked as gray. The Fermi level is set at 0 eV. 
From the DOS and partial density of state (PDOS) diagrams shown in Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S7a, b (ESI‡), it can be observed that the top of the VBs of EtBpy-Pb3I8 between −2 and 0 eV is mainly from the contributions of the 5p state of I and a small contribution from the 2p state of C of (Et2Bpy)2+. The bottom of the CBs between 0 and 3 eV is nearly entirely from the contribution of the p–π* anti-bonding orbital of (Et2Bpy)2+. Accordingly, the intrinsic optical absorptions of the hybrid can be mainly ascribed to the charge transitions from the 5p state of I to the p–π* orbitals of (Et2Bpy)2+ cations, mixing with a small amount of π → π* charge transitions within the (Et2Bpy)2+ cation.
As shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. S7c (ESI‡), CuIBpy-Pb2I6 shows a relatively complicated electronic structure. The top of the VBs between −2 and 0 eV not only comprises the contribution of the 5p state of I from (Pb2I6)2−, but also contains noticeable contributions from the 5p state of I that coordinated to Cu (denoted as c-I) and p–π bonding orbitals of the Bpy ligand. The bottom of the CBs between 0 and 3 eV is all from the mononuclear Cu complex cation, including the 3d state of Cu and the p–π* anti-bonding orbitals of Bpy. Based on these analyses, the absorption at 1005 nm (1.23 eV, Fig. 3b) is ascribed to the charge transition within the Cu complex cation, exactly from Cu to the p–π* orbitals of the Bpy ligand (MLCT). This absorption is anastomotic with the calculated Sc → Sd state transition (calculated 1.42 eV, Fig. 3d). The absorption at 759 nm (1.63 eV, Fig. 3b) may arise from the charge transition from c-I to the p–π* orbitals of Bpy (denoted as XLCT), corresponding to the calculated Sb → Sd transition of 1.67 eV.47 Because the four hybrids and bulk PbI2 all have a similar absorption maximum around 3.3 eV (Fig. 3a), the absorption at 373 nm (3.32 eV) of CuIBpy-Pb2I6 was assigned to the charge transition from I to Pb within the inorganic lead iodine chain, corresponding to the calculated Sa → Se transition (3.84 eV).48 At last, the edge absorption at 0.89 eV is assigned to the charge transitions between (Pb2I6)4− and the Cu complex cation, and mixing with a small amount of charge transitions within Cu complex cations.
The above analyses suggest that the band gaps of HLIPs can be tuned by the insertion of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs, shown as gray in Fig. 4) of N-heteroaromatic derivative cations into the empty bands of the inorganic lead iodine framework. Such a conclusion can also be deduced from the electronic structures of EtBpy-Pb2I6 and bi-MnPhen-Pb2I6 (Fig. 4b and d, and a detailed discussion in the ESI‡). Thus, the inserted FMOs constitute the new bottom of CBs and/or new top of VBs of hybrid perovskites, and then tune the band gaps of hybrid lead iodines. Most importantly, the introduction of [Cu(Bpy)2I]+ (denoted as CuIBpy) in the lead iodine framework seriously reconstructs both the bottom of CBs and the top of VBs of hybrid perovskites. Such a strong reconstruction effect manifests the effectiveness of the “dual-iodine” strategy in reducing the band gaps of HLIPs.
To further clarify the feasibility of the “dual-iodine” strategy, the FMOs of (Et2Bpy)2+, [Cu(Bpy)2I]+, [Cu(en)3]2+, [Cu(Bpy)3]2+, [Cu(en)3]2+, [Mn(Phen)2Cl0.65I0.35]22+, [Mn(Phen)2Cl]22+ and [Mn(en)3]2+ were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) methods at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. The calculated FMO energies are shown in Fig. 5 and Table S7 (ESI‡). It can be seen that the I-coordinated Cu complex CuIBpy has the narrowest energy gap (between FMOs, 0.121 hartrees) among all the calculated models, which is coincident with its strongest band-gap reduction effect on HLIPs. Furthermore, both aliphatic ethanediamine-coordinated Cu complex [Cu(en)3]2+ and I-free Bpy-coordinated Cu complex [Cu(Bpy)3]2+ have obviously larger energy gaps than [Cu(Bpy)2I]+. These results confirm that the coordinated I ligands and the N-heteroaromatic Bpy ligand are indispensable for the peculiar band-gap reduction effect of [Cu(Bpy)2I]+. A similar conclusion was also drawn in the Mn complex series, where [Mn(en)3]2+ and bi-chlorine bridged Mn-Phen binuclear complexes have larger energy gaps than mixed I, Cl bridged Mn-Phen binuclear complexes (Table S7, ESI‡).

Spatial plots of HOMOs and LUMOs for [Cu(Bpy)2I]+ are inserted, which clearly shows the contributions of both I and Bpy ligands to band gap reduction. 
Stability studies
As is well known, moisture, light and thermal stabilities are crucial for HLIPs for light-absorbing applications. Here, to evaluate the stabilities of EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6, harsh experiments were conducted. For moisture stability evaluation, the freshly synthesized powders of both materials were exposed to a 100% relative humidity environment with shading treatment for as long as 60 days. Then, PXRD measurements were used to check the phases of the samples after the above tests. In this case, the PXRD patterns show that the main PXRD peaks in the range of 8°–55° (2 theta) of both samples after 100% RH treatment basically agree with those of their freshly synthesized samples. To make the “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy more convincing, MAPbI3 was chosen as the “hydrogen-bond” material to testify the effectiveness of the strategy. The control experiments suggest that the structure of MAPbI3 changed when the sample was exposed to water for no more than 5 days (Fig. S9c, ESI‡). These results indicate the strongly enhanced moisture stabilities of EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6, and the effectiveness of the “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy proposed in this work (Fig. 6 and Fig. S9c, ESI‡).49 Furthermore, severe light stability evaluation for EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 was performed by exposing their crystalline powders directly to sunlight (July to August Jinan, Shandong). The PXRD patterns after as long as 60 day-irradiation imply the excellent light stabilities for the two hybrids (Fig. 6). CuIBpy-Pb2I6 can also remain stable when simultaneously soaked in water and irradiated by a 500 W Xe lamp for 6 hours, which also supports its excellent water and light stabilities (Fig. S10, ESI‡). Finally, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under an N2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 313–1273 K suggest that EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 are stable up to 525 K and 462 K respectively (Fig. S11, ESI‡). These decomposition temperatures are higher than those of the organic amine cation directed hybrids with similar 1D lead iodine moieties, such as [Cl(CH2)2NH3]2PbI4, (423 K),50 [(C5ONH9)2H]PbI3 (398 K), and [(CON2H4)2H]PbI3 (423 K),51 which indicates their good thermal stabilities.
 Fig. 6  Experimental and simulated PXRD patterns of (a) EtBpy-Pb3I8 and (b) CuIBpy-Pb2I6. The powdery samples of EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 were exposed to sunlight to check their photostability, and to a 100% RH environment to check their moisture stability for a period of 60 days, respectively. A few of the weakened or enhanced diffraction peaks were marked as gray stars. 
Besides the contributions illustrated in the “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy, the significant enhanced moisture and thermal stabilities of the two hybrids may also arise from the following two aspects: (1) the organic and inorganic moieties assemble into a 3D supramolecular framework via hydrogen bonds, π⋯π stacking interactions and/or coulomb interactions, which is also in favor of their enhanced stability and (2) the N-heteroaromatic molecule-derived cations are typically hydrophobic and less volatile.
Photoconductive properties
The photoconductive properties of the involved four hybrid materials were explored. As depicted in Fig. 7a, finely ground powdery samples of the hybrids were coated on a gold interdigital electrode with adjacent intervals of around 80 μm by a drop coating method (details are provided in the ESI‡). The Xe lamp with incident-light power density fixed at 85 mW cm−2 was used to apply light. The I–V curves exhibit a linear relationship with or without the Xe lamp irradiation, which indicates that the powdery samples are in ohmic contact with the gold interdigital electrode. Among them, the conductivities of EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 were in the nA scale and are comparable with the conductivity of 1D lead bromine hybrids [C6H14N]PbBr352 and 2D (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10,14 which indicate their good conductivities. As shown in Fig. 7b and c, the two hybrid lead iodines have good responses to the Xe lamp irradiation with an on/off ratio of 5.0 for EtBpy-Pb3I8 and 3.9 for CuIBpy-Pb2I6 when a positive bias voltage of 5.0 V was applied. Further experiments demonstrate that the photoconductive devices exhibit a clear wavelength-dependent photoresponse. As shown in Fig. 7b, c and Fig. S13 (ESI†), EtBpy-Pb3I8 shows a monotonic decreasing spectral response in the wavelength range from 365 nm to 700 nm, while a slight undulation occurred for the response of CuIBpy-Pb2I6, all of which are in accord with their optical absorptions and indicate their wide spectral response range. Importantly, such types of photoelectric devices based on the two hybrid lead iodines exhibit excellent repeatabilities of photocurrent under photo-switching conditions (Fig. 7d and e). Besides, Fig. 7f and Fig. S14 (ESI‡) further clearly indicate that both CuIBpy-Pb2I6 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 have fast response speed with a rise (tr) and decay time (td) of 120 ms. All these imply that these hybrids may serve as candidates in photoelectric fields.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown two effective strategies to synthesize moisture stable HLIPs with desired band gaps. The “hydrogen-bond-free” strategy aims to enhance the stability of HLIPs by preventing organic components from forming strong hydrogen bonds with external water molecules, e.g., designing alkylation reactions or coordination reactions on N-heteroaromatic molecules to get organic counter cations avoiding the formation of protonated cations. The “dual-iodine” strategy proposes that the I-coordinated metal complex can seriously reconstruct both the bottom of CBs and the top of VBs of the inorganic lead iodine skeleton to seriously reduce the band gaps of HLIPs. To demonstrate this proof-of-concept, ambient-stable lead iodine materials EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 with significant optical absorption are synthesized, which can endure 100% RH and sunlight irradiation for at least 60 days. Importantly, both EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 show good photoconduction behavior with short rise and decay recovery time, and exhibit excellent repeatabilities of photocurrent. This work not only provides several promising lead-based semiconductor absorbers with enhanced stabilities, but also provides new strategies to tune the band gaps and enhance the stabilities of HLIPs.

 	Fig. 5  The calculated frontier molecular orbitals and the energy gaps (shown as gray numbers) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level with the optimized geometries of (Et2Bpy)2+, [Cu(en)3]2+, [Cu(Bpy)2I]+, [Cu(Bpy)3]2+, [Mn(en)3]2+, bi-MnPhen and [Mn(Phen)2Cl0.65I0.35]22+ (abbreviated as Cl2–Mn). Spatial plots of HOMOs and LUMOs for [Cu(Bpy)2I]+ are inserted, which clearly shows the contributions of both I and Bpy ligands to band gap reduction.	 

 	Fig. 6  Experimental and simulated PXRD patterns of (a) EtBpy-Pb3I8 and (b) CuIBpy-Pb2I6. The powdery samples of EtBpy-Pb3I8 and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 were exposed to sunlight to check their photostability, and to a 100% RH environment to check their moisture stability for a period of 60 days, respectively. A few of the weakened or enhanced diffraction peaks were marked as gray stars.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) The schematic diagram of the photoconductive device based on hybrid lead iodines. The I–V curves of EtBpy-Pb3I8 (b) and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 (c) in the dark, and under illumination with selected monochromatic light, or simulated sunlight with a fixed incident power density of 85 mW cm−2. The time-dependent photocurrent response curves of EtBpy-Pb3I8 (d) and CuIBpy-Pb2I6 (e). (f) The response time of the photoconductive device based on EtBpy-Pb3I8. All the tests were performed at room temperature.
