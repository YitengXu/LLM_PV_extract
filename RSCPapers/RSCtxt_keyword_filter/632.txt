    , Accepted 15th May 2023First published on 15th May 2023AbstractA set of ullazine-derived D–π–A–π–A photosensitisers were considered and selected for a potential dye with the best performance via computational approaches. The designed dyes HJ1–HJ13, which originated from dye YZ7, were constructed with different π-linking motifs and two kinds of auxiliary withdrawing groups. The photoelectric and photovoltaic parameters were determined by density functional theory approaches, and PBE0 optimisation with the TD-cam-B3LYP method was shown to be the best choice of functional in these designed dyes, with the calculated maximum absorption wavelength and excited lifetime in accordance with the experimental findings for YZ7. Replacement of the CC bond by the CC bond could reduce aggregation and improve the photoelectronic property. In addition, the D–π–A–π–A-type photosensitiser was found to achieve higher light-harvesting efficiency and higher performance for dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs). HJ8 was selected as the potential dye for DSSCs, as it had a 69 nm redshift in the maximum absorption wavelength and a 66% increment in the maximum extinction coefficient compared to YZ7, and achieved 99.9% light-harvesting efficiency, the longest excited time of 2.82 ns, a suitable driving force of injection and regeneration, the largest short-circuit current density and the largest open-circuit voltage. Our theoretical results provide strong guidance for discovering new efficient D–π–A–π–A-type organic dyes in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) are of great interest and a key area of technology development due to their low production cost, long life, low optical power, wide variety and good mechanical stability.1–5 The first DSSC was developed in 1991 by Oregan and Grätzel et al.6 with a photovoltaic conversion rate of 7.1%. Since then, the performance of DSSCs has been continuously developed and optimised on the basis of the structure and technical architecture of that first DSSC. Recently, Ren et al. reported a high-efficiency DSSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2%, and the PCE of the device reached 28.4–30.2%.7 Lu and Zhang et al. systematically discussed the effect of the structure, electronic and optical properties, and the intramolecular/interfacial charge transfer process of dyes in DSSCs with a series of anchoring moieties.8 Xie and Bai et al. have identified and demonstrated the influence of different electric field directions on dye sensitisers on a theoretical basis.9 Xie and Zhang et al. reported the theoretical analysis of π-spacer tuning in D–π–A organic dyes for DSSCs.10 Janjua and Haroon et al. structurally engineered many series of D–π–A DSSCs and provided excellent theoretical elucidation of the photovoltaic properties of hole-transporting materials.11–17 Mahmood, Wang and Zhou et al. applied advanced machine learning and molecular dynamics simulation to screen the most efficient photosensitisers from a large library of potential organic molecules, leading to a revolution in computer-aided design approaches for optical materials.18–21 In recent years, organic dyes have gradually been derived with D–D–π–A-type,22 D–A–π–A-type23–25 and D–π–A–π–A-type26–29 dye sensitisers based on the basic D–π–A structure, and these derived structures have higher solar absorption efficiency and more efficient electron transport than the original basic sensitisers. The D–π–A–π–A type was formed by an additional secondary electron-absorbing group introduced between the electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) as an auxiliary electron acceptor. Compared to the D–π–A type, the charge separation and migration properties of the dye molecule can be effectively improved in D–π–A–π–A-type dyes.28,29
The ullazine moiety is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic system whose structure is shown in Scheme 1(a). The 16 π-electron conjugation on this group facilitates the absorption of energy and electron leap in the visible-UV band of sunlight. Ullazine was first introduced to dye solar cells by Michael Grätzel et al.,30 with advantages of good conjugation of the planar structure, easier adjustment of the molecular structure, better internal charge transfer, etc. There are also many substitution sites on the ullazine group for modulating the electron donor intensity and the overall dye morphology, making ullazine an attractive electron donor in dye molecules.31–35 Experimentally, Zhang et al. investigated various D–π–A–π–A-type dye-sensitised molecules based on the ullazine electron donor: YZ7, YZ12, YZ14, YZ15, JD21 and C218.36 The spectroscopic and electrochemical results showed that YZ7 (Scheme 1(b)) had the best performance, with a maximum absorption wavelength of 532 nm, open-circuit voltage of 551 mV and photoconversion efficiency of 5.6%.36
 Scheme 1  The ullazine moiety and the YZ7 dye reported by Zhang et al.36 

YZ7 used ullazine as a donor motif, cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as an electron-rich π-bridge and the ubiquitous cyanoacrylic as an acid acceptor. YZ7 is an excellent D–π–A photosensitiser and its optical properties can be improved by computational structural modification. Considering the computational cost, the Hex group was simply replaced by the methyl group. First, the CC alkyne bond was replaced by a CC olefin bond (HJ1 is also a D–π–A-type dye, in Scheme 1(b)). Since the original conjugation with the CC alkyne bond would cause heavy aggregation in the synthesis, replacing the CC bond with a CC bond can avoid this problem. The D–π–A–π–A type, based on the ullazine moiety, was then constructed by extending HJ1 with the additional electron acceptor A1 and various π-bridging moieties, as shown in Scheme 2. The A1 acceptor was inserted between the CC bond and the CPDT π-bridge. At the same time, different π2 motifs occupied the position of the CPDT π-bridge, forming HJ2, HJ3, HJ4, HJ5, HJ6 and HJ7 dyes. The selection of the appropriate electron acceptor A1 and the π-bridge moieties was based on previous studies.8–21,37–40 In addition, the carboxyl acceptor A2 was replaced by the disulfide carboxyl acceptor A3, yielding the potential solar dyes HJ8, HJ9, HJ10, HJ11, HJ12 and HJ13, as shown in Scheme 2.

2. Methods
2.1 Geometric optimisation
Various studies have shown that density functional theory (DFT) can obtain reasonable properties for organic dyes in DSSCs.8–30,41–46 In this work, the structures of the molecules were optimised in the Gaussian 16 program47 with CH2Cl2 solvation. The standard integral equation formalism polarisable continuum model (IEFPCM)48,49 was used with a dielectric constant of 9.08 for CH2Cl2 solvation. As the different functionals in the DFT calculation would give results with different precision, it was necessary to select the appropriate methods for the calculation. Two DFT methods, B3LYP50 and PBE0 (PBE1PBE),51 were considered in the geometric optimisation using the 6-311+G** basis set. All optimised structures were studied without imaginary frequency.
2.2 Excitation energy calculation
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a sufficient method for accurate calculation of the vertical excitation energy.8–30 Similar to the DFT calculation, the choice of functionals is directly related to the degree of accuracy of the results. Seven functionals, B3LYP,50 B3LYP-D3,52 cam-B3LYP,53 M06-2X,54 PBE0,51 PBE55 and ωB97XD,56 were used with the single point calculation for the first excited states in the basis set of 6-311+G**. The IEFPCM solvation model48,49 was used for CH2Cl2 solvation.
2.3 Property calculation
The DFT/TDDFT orbitals and transition density matrix analysis were supported by the Multiwfn analyser.57 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies indicated the electron transfer capabilities. The parameters that determine the performance of the dyes in the DSSCs, such as the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), the estimated open-circuit photovoltage (eVoc) and the first excited lifetime (τ), were determined. The LHE of the maximum wavelength can be obtained from the following equation:58 LHE = 1 − 10−f(1)where f is the oscillator strength at the maximum wavelength.
As the number of electrons in the conduction band was uncertain, it was difficult to obtain the exact Voc from the theoretical calculation. Therefore, the estimated photovoltage eVoc was used in the following equation:59 eVoc = ELUMO − ECB(2)where ELUMO is the energy of the calculated LUMO orbital and ECB is the energy of the conduction band of TiO2, with a value of −4.0 eV60 according to experimental measurement.
The lifetime of the excited state is a key factor in charge transfer efficiency, and a longer lifetime is more favourable for charge transfer. The excited state lifetime (τ) can be obtained from the following equation:61 τ = 1.449/fE2(3)where f and E are the oscillator strength and vertical excitation energy (in cm−1) of the excitation considered.
In addition to the photoelectronic property, some parameters of DSSC efficiency should also be addressed, such as the injection Gibbs energy (ΔGinj), the regeneration Gibbs energy (ΔGreg), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc). ΔGinj is used to reflect the force of electron injection from the dye to the solid film material (e.g. TiO2, Al2O3), as shown in the following equation:62 ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB(4)where Edye* is the excited state potential and ECB is the energy of the conduction band of the semiconductor material. When considering the semiconductor TiO2, ECB is usually experimentally set at −4.0 eV in vacuum.60 However, in the TDDFT calculation, the potential of the first excited state is rarely the energy of the LUMO orbital. Therefore, ΔGinj is calculated as follows:63 ΔGinj = Edye + Eex − ECB(5)where Edye is the ground state potential and Eex is the vertical excitation energy corresponding to the calculated maximum absorption wavelength λmax.
ΔGreg is used to reflect the power of dye regeneration in the electrode I−/I3−, as shown in the following equation:47 ΔGreg = Eredox − Edye(6)where Eredox is the redox potential of the electrode I−/I3−, with a value of −4.6 eV,60 and Edye is the potential of the ground state.
The short-circuit current density Jsc and the open-circuit voltage Voc depend on the conduction band of the dye-TiO2 system and the redox potential of the electrode I−/I3−. The variation of the conduction band edge due to the interaction between the dye molecule and TiO2 can be obtained by the following:64 (7)where q is the meta charge, μmormal is the dipole moment perpendicular to the surface of TiO2; γ is the concentration of the dye adsorbed onto the surface of the titanium dioxide semiconductor and ε0/ε is the dielectric constant of the vacuum/organic dye. Voc has a positive relationship with the absolute value of ΔECB, and Jsc can be obtained from the following equation:65 (8)where LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency at wavelength λ, Φinj is the charge injection efficiency and ηcoll is the electron collection efficiency. Since the electrode I−/I3− is considered in this work, ηcoll can be considered as a constant. Furthermore, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and incident light intensity (Pinc) determine the total efficiency (η) of dye-sensitised solar cells, as shown below.66 (9)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Choice of calculation methods
The absorption wavelength of YZ7 calculated by each functional is shown in Table 1. The ideal calculation scheme was determined from the combinations of two DFT optimisation methods with seven TDDFT excitation energy calculation approaches, by comparing the calculated absorption wavelength with the experimental result. The energy schemes with the TD-B3LYP, TD-B3LYP-D3, TD-PBE0 and TD-PBE approaches were inaccurate in both the B3LYP and PBE0 geometric optimisations, as their results with a maximum wavelength of 740–940 nm were far from the experimental value of 532 nm.36 In the B3LYP optimisation, TD-cam-B3LYP, TD-M06-2X and TD-ωB97XD gave 546 nm, 549 nm and 523 absorptions, respectively, which were theoretically reasonable, with errors of −5 nm to 17 nm. In the PBE0 optimisation, TD-cam-B3LYP and TD-M06-2X gave the highest intensity absorption at 535 nm and 359 nm, respectively, very close to the experimental values of 532 nm36 with errors of only 3 nm and 7 nm. Therefore, for the ullazine-derived organic sensitisers, the PBE0 geometric optimisation was determined instead of the B3LYP approaches. For the excitation energy calculations, the TD-cam B3LYP method was favoured because the secondary absorption wavelength was in better agreement with the experimental measurement than TD-M06-2X.36 Therefore, PBE0 optimisation and TD-cam-B3LYP excitation calculations were chosen for the subsequent computational design in this study. Many previous theoretical studies of organic sensitisers41–46 have relied on the B3LYP optimisation scheme, mainly because of the technical problem of PBE0 convergence failure for large organic systems. Gaussian 1647 has been updated with more accurate integrals, making the geometric optimisation by PBE0 converge easily.

3.2 Optimised geometry
The optimised bonding and dihedral parameters between each donor motif, acceptor motif and π-bridge are listed in Table 2, and the Cartesian coordinates of each optimised geometry are listed in the ESI.† There was a close relationship between the molecular structure of the sensitised solar dyes and their performance, especially for the planar structure between donors, acceptors and π-bridges. As shown in Table 2, YZ7 was almost a planar molecule with Φ1, Φ2 and Φ3 values of 1.8°, 0.1° and 0.0°, respectively, which was consistent with previous results.36 The planar structure may enhance the optoelectronic properties of the dye molecules, but the strong π–π interaction would cause the dyes to spontaneously aggregate. Previous experimental research has found strong aggregation on solid films of TiO2, mainly due to π–π stacking within the planar structure. To avoid aggregation, CC was introduced into the molecule by replacing CC, thereby destroying the planar structure of the dye. The Φ1 and Φ2 values for HJ1 were 29.7° and 10.4°, respectively, showing a partially non-planar structure. The D–π–A–π–A dyes HJ2–HJ7 were constructed based on the non-planar D–π–A dye HJ1 by adding another acceptor motif and π-linking groups. HJ2 and HJ4–HJ7 continued the partial non-planar structure between D, π1, A1 and π2 with Φ1, Φ2 and Φ3 values of 22.4°–30.2°, 3.6°–9.6° and 17.1°–18.4°, respectively. A2 and π2 in HJ2 and HJ4–HJ7 dyes showed a planar structure with Φ4 values of 0.2°–0.6°. In contrast to the other dyes, HJ3 had a planar structure between A1 and π2 with a Φ3 dihedral angle equivalent to 0.3°. The designed dyes would benefit from the non-planar configuration by avoiding the problem of π–π stacking found in the original YZ7 dye. The dyes with disulfide carboxyl groups had structures similar to those with carboxyl groups.36 For example, the optimised geometries of HJ2 were 1.456 Å, 1.441 Å, 1.438 Å, 1.409 Å, 29.7°, 8.5°, 17.9° and 0.2° for R1, R2, R3, R4, Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 and Φ4, respectively, while the corresponding parameters of HJ8 were 1. 455 Å, 1.441 Å, 1.436 Å, 1.401 Å, 35.7°, 4.7°, 18.7° and 0.2° for R1, R2, R3, R4, Φ1, Φ2, Φ3 and Φ4, respectively.

3.3 The photoelectric property
The energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 1. Matching the dye molecule with the titanium dioxide semiconductor and the redox electrolyte energy level is a prerequisite to determine whether the dye molecule can be used in dye-sensitised solar cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the LUMO energy levels of the dye molecules were all higher than the conduction band edge of titanium dioxide (−4.0 eV),60 and the HOMO energy levels were all lower than the potential of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte pair (−4.6 eV),60 which ensured that the dye molecules were able to inject electrons into titanium dioxide and ensured the reduction of the dye molecules in the oxidised state.
 Fig. 1  The energetic profiles of the designed organic dyes YZ7 and HJ1–HJ13. 
A redshift occurred in the D–π–A–π–A sensitiser compared to D–π–A dyes, due to the smaller HOMO–LUMO gap and more energetically contracted HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 orbitals. YZ7 had a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.97 eV, and the HOMO–LUMO gap in HJ1 changed to 3.96 eV when the CC moiety was replaced by the CC moiety in the D–π–A-type sensors. Conversion of the D–π–A type (YZ7, HJ1) to the D–π–A–π–A type (HJ2–HJ7) lowers the HOMO–LUMO gap from ∼3.9 eV to ∼3.8 eV. The HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 orbitals of the sensitisers, which played a secondary role in the photoelectric property of the DSSCs, were dramatically changed after the addition of another π-bridge and acceptor motif to HJ1. In the D–π–A–π–A-type dyes, the energy levels of HOMO−1 (approximately −6.1 eV) were much higher than those in the D–π–A dyes (approx. −7.0 eV), and the LUMO+1 orbitals in HJ2–HJ7 (approx. −1.4 eV) were lower than those in the D–π–A dyes YZ7 (−0.96 eV) and HJ1 (−0.89 eV).
Conversion of the A2 carboxylic acceptor to A3 dithiocarbonyl would also cause a redshift and give good light-absorbing properties. Comparing the energetic profiles of HJ8–HJ13 with those of HJ2–HJ7, dithiocarbonyl systems have lower LUMO energy levels (approx. −2.6 eV), resulting in lower HOMO–LUMO gaps (3.5 eV). Yang et al. have shown that the disulfide carboxyl group (–CSSH) has good light-absorbing properties.36,67 In particular, the A2 or A3 acceptor was related to the LUMO orbital, as the energies of HOMO, HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 were almost the same after the change from –COOH to –CSSH.
The light-absorption property of the dye molecules is key to the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the dyes. The main parameters of the selected dyes are listed in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the maximum absorption wavelength λmax of HJ1 (541 nm) has a slight redshift (6 nm) compared to that of YZ7 (535 nm) due to the replacement of the CC π-bridge by the CC motif. The energetic levels of the HOMO and HOMO−1 increased, causing the slight redshift, as the strong D–π conjugation was partially damaged by the CC replacement. In addition, HJ1 with the CC motif achieved a slight increase in the maximum extinction coefficient ε compared to YZ7 with the CC motif, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 2. An obvious redshift occurred when another π bond and acceptor were added, indicating that the D–π–A–π–A-type dye can be an excellent model for light absorption. HJ2–HJ7 had maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) of 552 nm, 548 nm, 544 nm, 538 nm, 547 nm and 546 nm, with a redshift of 3 to 17 nm compared to YZ7 (535 nm). More importantly, the maximum extinction coefficients for the D–π–A–π–A dyes were increased by 18–51%. More solar energy can be utilised in solar cells via D–π–A–π–A dyes. HJ2 achieved the largest maximum extinction coefficient ε and the highest light-harvesting efficiency of 11.076 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 99.8%, respectively, in the HJ2–HJ7 systems.

 Fig. 2  The TDDFT calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of YZ7, HJ1, HJ2 and HJ8. The calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of other species are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). 
The A3 disulfide carboxyl acceptor would further enhance the absorption spectrum redshift effect. HJ8–HJ13 had maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) of 604 nm, 597 nm, 591 nm, 567 nm, 598 nm and 595 nm, respectively, with a significant redshift of 32–69 nm compared to YZ7 (535 nm). The D–π–A–π–A type, together with the disulfide carboxyl acceptor, even achieved a 67% increase in spectral absorbance intensity and reached 99.9% light-harvesting efficiency in the HJ8 dye. We also knew, from the calculated UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 2, that HJ8 had a huge absorption in long-wavelength sunlight, especially in the range 400–1100 nm, while the original YZ7 can only absorb wavelengths less than 800 nm. In addition, the lifetime of the excited state was a key factor affecting the charge transfer efficiency, with longer lifetime being more favourable for charge transfer.68 The calculated lifetime of the first excited state in YZ7 was 1.54 ns, in agreement with the experimental lifetime of 1.25 ns.36HJ8 had the longest first excited state lifetime of 2.82 ns, ensuring efficient electron transfer and electron injection of dye molecules. Therefore, HJ8 was determined to be the ideal sensitised dye due to its perfect photoelectric performance in this series.
Additionally, the mechanism of the efficiency enhancement in the contribution of the D–π–A–π–A type and disulfide carboxyl acceptor can be understood via the TDDFT orbital analysis shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3. The HOMO orbital of YZ7 had an electronic distribution in the ullazine electronic donor and π-bridge. The electrons of the LUMO orbital in YZ7 were located in the π-bridge and acceptor motifs, similarly to the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) results obtained by Zhang et al.20 When the CC motif was changed to the CC motif, the molecular aromaticity decreased slightly, but it can also be seen that the orbital distribution in HJ1 can be displayed in the ullazine electronic donor and the π-bridge. When another π-bridge and acceptor motifs were added to the systems, forming the D–π–A–π–A type, the frontier molecular orbitals became more delocalised. The HOMO electronic distribution appeared in the D1, π1, A1 region and the orbital expanded in the π1, A1, π2, A2 region in the LUMO orbital for the HJ2/HJ8 species. The conjugation property made the frontier orbitals in the D–π–A–π–A-type dyes more contracted and increased the probabilities of excitation occurring in the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 orbitals. The electron distribution of the LUMO+1 orbital appeared near the ullazine group in YZ7, while in D–π–A–π–A, HJ2 limited the electronic cloud of the LUMO+1 orbital to the π-bridge and acceptor motifs, stabilising the LUMO+1 orbital in the D–π–A–π–A-type dyes. These conjugation properties significantly enhanced the absorption intensity of the dye molecule and induced a significant redshift in the position of the maximum absorption peak. In the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) shown in Table 3, HOMO → LUMO excitation is dominant in the D–π–A dyes, accounting for 69.7% and 69.2% in YZ7 and HJ1, respectively. In the D–π–A–π–A-type dyes, the contribution of HOMO → LUMO excitation decreased to approximately 35%, and the contracted HOMO−1 → LUMO increased to approximately 30%. For example, the first excitation of HJ2 held the 38.8% HOMO → LUMO contribution, 34.1% HOMO−1 → LUMO contribution and 16.2% HOMO → LUMO+1 contribution. The disulfide carboxyl acceptor decreased the percentage of HOMO → LUMO excitation and increased the percentage of HOMO−1 → LUMO excitation along with the drop in energy level of LUMO orbitals. HOMO−1 → LUMO excitation even became the main component in the first excitation in some D–π–A–π–A dyes with disulfide carboxyl acceptors, such as HJ8, HJ11 and HJ12. The main electronic transition component of HJ8 was the HOMO−1 → LUMO excitation, which accounted for a 43.6% contribution, while the secondary HOMO → LUMO excitation had a 34.4% contribution.

3.4 Photovoltaic properties in DSSCs
The photovoltaic properties should be considered when the dyes are merged into the solar cell. The electrons from the donor motifs of the dye are transferred to the acceptor motifs induced by sunlight, followed by the electrons injected into the semiconductor films and solar cell utility. ΔGinj indicates the driving force of the electron injection. On the other hand, the electrons of the dye would be replenished and regenerated by the redox electrode, whose driving force was determined by the parameter ΔGreg. YZ7 and HJ1–HJ13 had ΔGinj and ΔGreg values greater than 1.0 eV. According to Islam's theory,69 ΔGinj greater than 0.8 eV and ΔGreg greater than 0.5 eV can handle fast electron injection and regeneration. Therefore, all the dyes in this work, including HJ8, had sufficient driving force to ensure the injection of electrons into the semiconductor and to be injected by the redox electrode.
The short-circuit current density Jsc and the open-circuit voltage Voc were two vital and fundamental parameters for the designed solar cells, which affected the commercial value and use scenarios of the systems. For YZ7 a short-circuit current density Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage Voc of 559 mV have been reported in experimental results.20 It was difficult to obtain the values of Jsc and Voc in the theoretical calculation, but, in general, a qualitative judgement can be made from eqn (7)–(9) that the larger the LHE and μnormal, the more Jsc and Voc can be obtained to some extent. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, all our designed dyes had larger LHE and μ values than YZ7. In addition, replacement of the A2 carboxyl acceptor with the A3 disulfide carboxyl acceptor also contributed to a slight increase in the values of LHE and μ. Therefore, both the D–π–A–π–A type and the disulfide carboxyl acceptor improved the photovoltaic properties of the solar-sensitised dye by increasing the short-circuit current density Jsc and the open-circuit voltage Voc. Most importantly, HJ8 achieved the highest Jsc and Voc with the largest LHE and μ values, making it the most efficient potential dye for DSSCs. In addition, the –CSSH group of HJ8 should be anchored to the TiO2 (or other semiconductor substrate) when the dye is incorporated into the solar device. Although previous reports on the combination of CSSH and TiO2 are limited, the tridentate bond between the S atom and TiO2 was predicted by DFT calculation,70 and current synthesis technology can also achieve doping of sulfur on the surface of TiO2.71 The bonding type of –CSSH on the TiO2 surface with different substituted groups is also an interesting topic, which we will consider in future investigations.

From a comprehensive analysis of the above, HJ8 was selected as the potential dye from the series of D–π–A–π–A systems for efficient dye-sensitised solar cells, with the largest absorption in long-wavelength sunlight, the longest first excited lifetime and the largest short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage.
3.5 Transition density matrix analysis
The transition density matrix (TDM) contained a considerable amount of information about the electron jump characteristics of the dye molecules during excitation. The coefficients with absolute values greater than 10−4 were taken into account in the analysis of the TDM in order to ensure the reliability of the results. Fragment TDM was used in this investigation. YZ1 and HJ1 were divided into three fragments in the TDM analysis, including donor fragment (Fragment 1), π fragment (Fragment 2) and acceptor fragment (Fragment 3), while the other dyes HJ2–HJ13 contained five fragments: D1 fragment (Fragment 1), π1 fragment (Fragment 2), A1 fragment (Fragment 3), π2 fragment (Fragment 4) and A2 or A3 fragment (Fragment 5). Details of the fragmentation are given in the ESI.†

Fig. 4 shows the heat map of the S0 → S1 fragment transition matrix of YZ7, HJ1, HJ2 and HJ8 as representative photosensitisers with mainly structural modifications. The heat map with TDM properties of other dyes are given in the ESI† (Fig. S3 and S4). In the original dye YZ7, none of the non-diagonal values were significant relative to the diagonal elements. The largest values (in red) were concentrated on the ullazine donor fragment and the π fragment had intermediate values (in cyan), indicating the S0 → S1 excitation resulting from the local excitation of the ullazine donor fragment and the π fragment. Small values (in light blue) appeared in non-diagonal elements between Fragment 1 and Fragment 2, indicating the electronic transition from the ullazine donor fragment to the π fragment in the S0 → S1 excitation. When CC was replaced by CC, forming HJ1, the values of the diagonal π fragment (in yellow) and the non-diagonal Fragment 1/Fragment 2 (in yellow and green) increased, indicating the more likely electronic transition from the ullazine donor fragment to the π fragment and obtaining better photo-optical properties compared to YZ7. Although not many references have focused on the characteristic difference between CC and CC, the TDM results provide a better photoelectronic performance for CC than for CC. In the D–π–A–π–A-type dye HJ2, the two largest diagonal values (in red and in green-yellow) with local electronic transitions were also found in the ullazine donor fragments and the π2 fragment, similarly to YZ7 and HJ1. The heat map of HJ2 featured many non-diagonal elements with notable values, e.g. non-diagonal Fragment 1/Fragment 3 (in green) and Fragment 4/Fragment 3 (in green), indicating that electron transfer in the D1 motif, A1 motif and π2 motif of the D–π–A–π–A molecule was crucial for its optoelectronic properties. It can also be seen from Fig. S3 (ESI†) that HJ3–HJ6 had similar heat maps to HJ1. When the A3 disulfide carboxyl acceptor was considered, the proportion of Fragment 5 was increased by the A3 disulfide carboxyl acceptor in HJ8–HJ12, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the main local transitions switched from the ullazine donor to the π2 bridge and the A3 disulfide carboxyl acceptor specifically for HJ8, as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S4 (ESI†).

In general, our theoretically designed D–π–A–π–A-type dyes are only the tip of the iceberg in the development of dye cells. As the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology expands in the field of dye design, a large number of donor, π-binding and acceptor ligands could be considered, and our research will be an important precursor and reference for future guidance.
4 Conclusion
In summary, we have designed a series of ullazine-derived D–π–A–π–A dyes, HJ1–HJ13, derived from dye YZ7. These dyes were characterised by DFT and TDDFT calculations to investigate their validity and efficiency. First, suitable density theory functionals were determined to ensure the accuracy of the results. PBE0/6-311+G** optimisation with TD-cam-B3LYP/6-311+G** property calculations were found to agree with experimental results. Then, the significance of replacing the CC π-bridge with the CC motif was that aggregation of dye molecules on TiO2 during synthesis could be avoided to some extent, and the absorption spectrum of the photosensitive material could be slightly redshifted and the light-absorption efficiency slightly improved. In addition, the photoelectric properties and photovoltaic parameters, including the maximum absorption wavelength, frontier molecular orbitals, first excited lifetimes, Gibbs energies of injection and regeneration, light-harvesting efficiency, etc., were calculated to understand the efficiency of the designed dyes. After comprehensive analysis, HJ8 was considered as a potential dye for DSSCs. More importantly, our study demonstrated that the D–π–A–π–A type can achieve a large light harvest and that the disulfide carboxyl group is a good receptor for dye molecules, which can be applied to the design and study of new dye molecules. The present theoretical results are expected to provide guidance for the design of efficient D–π–A–π–A-type organic dyes and directions for the synthesis of efficient dye-sensitised solar cells.
