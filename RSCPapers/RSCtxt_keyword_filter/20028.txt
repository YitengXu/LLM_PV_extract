Zn1NH3A with electron donating and anti-aggregation meso substituents has achieved the highest efficiency of 6.10%. These porphyrins with three p-carboxyphenyl groups are more stable toward photo-bleaching than their single anchoring group analogs.
The recently emerged technology of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is one the most promising candidates for the development of affordable, high performance, and clean energy resources.1 During the past few years tremendous efforts have been devoted to the design, synthesis, and application of highly efficient ruthenium, porphyrins, and organic sensitizers.2–9 Ruthenium sensitizers exhibit an average efficiency of 11%, however their practical application might be hindered because of limited resources and environmental concern. Porphyrin sensitizers YD2 and YD2-o-C8 with a push–pull (D–π–A) incorporated system have achieved 11% and record breaking 12.3% efficiencies, respectively.10,11 However, their mass production and long term thermal stability are concerns owing to an expensive palladium catalyzed step in the preparation and the presence of an unstable ethynyl bridged unit. Therefore, in pursuit of simple, efficient, stable, and cost effective sensitizers for DSSCs we have designed a series of porphyrin sensitizers with three p-carboxyphenyl units as meso substituents (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1D–π–3A porphyrin sensitizers. 
The zinc porphyrins used in this study Zn1T3A, Zn1U3A, Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, and Zn1ND3A were synthesized in three steps, namely (i) mixed condensation,12 (ii) zinc metalation,13 and (iii) base hydrolysis.14 The detailed synthetic routes and characterization data for all studied porphyrins are described in the ESI.† The synthetic steps involved here are facile with good yields. The starting materials of all reactions are readily available. The overall yields of these studied porphyrins are 5.91, 2.31, 9.41, 4.91 and 1.80% for Zn1T3A, Zn1U3A, Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, and Zn1ND3A, respectively. Gram-scale mass production is easily accessible, thus overall synthesis of these dyes is cost-effective. Among the studied dyes Zn1NH3A demonstrates a power conversion efficiency of 6.10%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report demonstrating a higher than 5% efficiency for any porphyrinic sensitizers synthesized in three steps starting from commercially available starting materials.
The UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. S1 in ESI†) of the studied zinc porphyrin dyes show one strong Soret band and two Q bands. The peak positions and their molar absorption coefficients (ε) are summarized in Table 1. The porphyrin Zn1TPA3A with a triphenyl amine unit at the meso position is slightly red shifted compared with the remaining porphyrins. The Soret band of Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A is broadened because of the presence of an electron donating amino unit. The compound with the highest extinction coefficient (ε) has been observed for Zn1U3A. Although the ε values are not high for Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A, the lower absorbance might be compensated by broaden absorption and better electron injection to result in high overall conversion efficiencies (vide infra). The emission spectra of Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A are significantly red-shifted compared to those of Zn1U3A and Zn1T3A porphyrins (Table 1).

Cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S3 in ESI†) of 1D–π–3A porphyrins show well-resolved and reversible waves for the first oxidation couple. The values of oxidation potential depicted in Table 1 indicate that the porphyrins with an amino group at their meso positions, viz: Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A, show well-resolved two successive oxidations; the first one belongs to the oxidation of an amino unit and the second for porphyrin core oxidation.15,16 The systematic energy level diagrams of studied porphyrins, shown in Fig. 2, demonstrate that the oxidation potentials of all studied porphyrin dyes are more positive than that of the I−/I3− couple assuring the regeneration of oxidized dyes and the excited state oxidation potentials (EOX*) are more negative than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.50 V vs. NHE), exhibiting sufficient driving forces for electron injection from the excited state of the dyes to the CB of TiO2. The systematic energy level diagrams of studied porphyrins exhibit the feasibility of dye regeneration with the electrolyte and electron injection to the conduction band.17

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations done at a B3LYP/6-31G level illustrate the electron density distributions of studied porphyrins in their respective HOMO – 1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO + 1 molecular orbitals (Fig. S4 in ESI†). Analyzing the orbitals in detail, for HOMO – 1 and HOMO orbitals, the electron density distributions for porphyrin dyes without an electron donating amino moiety are distinctively different from those with an amino moiety. The electron density mainly localizes on the porphyrin core for HOMO – 1 and HOMO orbitals in Zn1T3A and Zn1U3A while a majority of electron density localizes on electron donating amino units in Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, and Zn1ND3A. While the porphyrin core is still the main electron population site in LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals, a significant amount of electron density extensively populates toward the p-carboxyphenyl substituents. It is observed that the electron density localizes at 5,15-p-carboxyphenyl for the LUMOs and at 10-p-carboxylphenyl for the LUMO + 1 orbital for all porphyrins. Evidenced from our ATR-IR analysis of having two arms in the cis position anchoring to TiO2 with one dangling p-carboxyphenyl group for these three p-carboxyphenyl substituted porphyrin dyes,18 it is likely that LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals synchronize to pump electron density into the conduction band of TiO2. Nevertheless, it is clearly evidenced from the electron density distributions that the porphyrin dyes containing an electron-donating meso substituent provide a better charge separation which slows down the charge recombination and results in a more efficient electron injection.
The photovoltaic performance data for all 1D–π–3A porphyrin dyes are summarized in Table 2. The I–V curves of all the studied three p-carboxyphenyl substituted porphyrins are shown in Fig. 3a. The Zn1T3A and Zn1U3A dyes having no electron donating substituents at their meso-positions exhibit moderate efficiencies of 4.51% and 3.80%, respectively. Whereas the porphyrin dyes Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A have power conversion efficiencies of 5.36%, 6.10% and 5.80%, respectively. The higher efficiencies of these sensitizers are most likely because of their stronger electron donating character, inhibition of charge recombination, and effective charge separation. Sensitizers Zn1NH3A and Zn1ND3A give higher efficiency compared to Zn1TPA3A because of their intrinsic anti-aggregation properties acquired by the presence of long alkyl chains on electron donating substituents. The twelve carbon N-dodecyl alkyl chain of Zn1ND3A gives the highest JSC of 13.61 mA cm−2 and a moderate VOC of 0.65 V contributed to the efficiency of 5.80%. The presence of the most suitable six carbon N-hexyl alkyl chain in Zn1NH3A helps to generate the moderate JSC of 12.66 mA cm−2 and the highest VOC of 0.70 V leading to the highest efficiency of 6.10%.

 Fig. 3  (a) I–V and (b) IPCE curves of 1D–π–3A porphyrin sensitizers measured under AM 1.5 G one-sun illumination. 
The IPCE spectra of studied porphyrins are shown in Fig. 3b. The IPCEmax values demonstrated at the Soret band region are consistent with the performance of porphyrin dyes. The highest IPCEmax value of 84% is observed for Zn1NH3A having the highest efficiency of 6.10% whereas the IPCEmax value of 60% is observed for Zn1U3A having an efficiency of 4.51%. The dye loading of porphyrins on TiO2 films is examined and summarized in Table 2. The dye densities and efficiencies of porphyrins are roughly consistent; Zn1NH3A has the highest dye loading density giving the highest efficiency whereas, despite a low dye density, Zn1TPA3A, with an electron donating substituent, is able to give good performance. It is worth mentioning that regular desorption solvent, 0.1 M KOH(aq) in THF (2:8, v/v), failed to completely desorb these three p-carboxyphenyl substituted sensitizing dyes with even a 24 h exposure. It requires a solution of 0.2 M KOH(aq) in THF (1:1, v/v) to completely desorb the dye attached onto the TiO2 surface. The use of high concentration of base to desorb the dye is an additional support to prove higher stabilities of three meso-p-carboxyphenyl groups possessing porphyrins than those of a single meso-p-carboxyphenyl group possessing porphyrins.
For the commercialization of DSSCs, long term stability is an important advantage along with a high efficiency. We have used a straightforward method reported in the literature to examine the stability of studied dyes.19,20 To obtain the stability information, absorption spectra of three p-carboxyphenyl groups possessing porphyrins Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, and Zn1ND3A are compared with that of a single anchoring group possessing porphyrin Zn3TPA1A21 upon irradiation. The TiO2 plates adsorbed with Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, Zn1ND3A, and Zn3TPA1A as sensitizers were irradiated under standard one-sun illumination and the absorption curves were monitored after irradiation for 0, 5, and 30 min (Fig. S5 in ESI†). The observed results suggest that the absorbance of dyes decreases at various rates but without any shifting of the wavelength of maximum absorbance. The decrease in the absorbance is significantly larger for Zn3TPA1A in comparison with Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, and Zn1ND3A and suggests that the porphyrins possessing multi-anchoring groups are more stable compared to porphyrins possessing a single anchoring group.
In conclusion 1D–π–3A porphyrins with three p-carboxyphenyl groups as the meso substituents have been synthesized from commercially available starting materials in high yields. The synthesis of studied sensitizers is facile, straightforward, and scalable thus termed as cost-effective. Higher than 5% efficiency has been achieved for a device with either Zn1TPA3A, Zn1NH3A, or Zn1ND3A as the sensitizer. The strong electron donating character, fair extinction coefficients, better electron injection, intrinsic anti-aggregation, and suppressed charge recombination capacity contributed to the highest efficiency of Zn1NH3A (6.10%). The photo-stability study demonstrates that the multi-anchoring-group porphyrins are more stable compared to their mono-anchoring-group analogs.
