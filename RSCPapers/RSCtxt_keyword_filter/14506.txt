Both the insulating properties of GO and the non-uniform coating of the transparent electrode with GO cause the poor morphology of perovskite induced low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.4%. On the other hand, PeSCs with a GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL, exhibited a higher PCE of 9.7% than that of a device fabricated with conventional PEDOT:PSS showing a PCE of 8.2%. The higher performance is attributed to the decreased series resistance (RS) and increased shunt resistance (RSh). The well-matched work-function between GO (4.9 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV) probably results in more efficient charge transport and an overall decrease in RS. The existence of GO with a large bandgap of ∼3.6 eV might induce the effective blocking of electrons, leading to an increase of RSh. Moreover, improvement in the long-term stability under atmospheric conditions was observed.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials such as methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3) have attracted significant attention as promising materials for photovoltaic applications due to their high absorption coefficients, excellent carrier transport, chemical and structural diversity, and proper band gap. After perovskite was used as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka in 2009, the PCE of solar cells including perovskite materials has been rapidly increased up to ∼20% over the last 5 years.1–8 Although the toxicity of soluble lead(II) salts has emerged as a critical problem, several reports on the life cycle and environmental impact analysis of lead based perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) described that there is no need to dismiss lead based perovskites as considerable materials for solar cell technology.9,10 In general, high efficiency perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) employed meso-superstructured or condensed metal oxides such as TiO2 and Al2O3. In that case, because a high-temperature process (>450 °C) is required for the preparation of high-quality metal oxides, they are not suitable for flexible power sources.6–8,11–14 To overcome this issue, planar heterojunction PeSCs consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/HTL/CH3NH3PbX3/1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61(PCBM)/metal cathode have been suggested by several groups.15–17 In contrast to conjugated polymers, because perovskite materials have long exciton diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm) and lifetimes (∼100 ns), they can be applied to planar structured solar cells.18 To demonstrate highly efficient planar solar cells, the choice of appropriate electron acceptor layer is very important. Among various materials, fullerenes are considered as excellent candidates owing to efficient and fast charge transfer (0.40 ns) from perovskite to fullerenes.19,20 Moreover, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of fullerenes and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of CH3NH3PbX3 are well aligned for electron transfer.15 These properties make fullerenes ideal electron acceptor materials and thus interest in CH3NH3PbX3/PCBM planar PeSCs has been dramatically increased. Most studies on planar PeSCs have been focused on the optimization of the morphology of the perovskite active layer by controlling the crystallization process.16,21–24 Yang Yang et al. reported a PeSC with a PCE of ∼11% using a mixed halide (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) absorber layer fabricated by a vapor-assisted solution process.16,21 Alex Jen et al. and D. Y. Kim et al. studied the effect of additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) on the morphology and overall PCE of PeSCs, respectively.22,23 In addition, Jinsong Huang et al. produced a high quality perovskite layer by optimizing sequential 2-step spin coating of lead halide and methyl ammonium iodide.24
For further improvement in the performance of planar PeSCs, efficient carrier transport to electrodes through the HTL and electron acceptor layer is also a crucial requirement.25–28 In general, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is widely used as a HTL in polymer solar cells, has been applied as a HTL for generated hole transport from the perovskite active layer to ITO. However, because PEDOT:PSS has latent problems such as high acidity and a hygroscopic nature, inhomogeneous electrical properties, and a poor electron blocking ability, a few studies on the development of promising alternatives to PEDOT:PSS HTLs have been reported by several groups.29–36 Improved PeSCs with nickel oxide (NiOx) HTLs have been demonstrated as a result of improved wetting and better aligned energy levels with CH3NH3PbI3.32,33 However, to obtain considerable efficiency, additional high temperature processing or UV/O3 treatment, which are incompatible with the simple and low cost manufacturing of PeSCs, is required. Application of a high work function (WF) self-organized HTL composed of PEDOT:PSS and perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) also improved the PCE of a PeSC by increasing the built-in potential.34 Very recently, 2-D carbonaceous materials such as GO and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been used as HTLs in PeSCs.35,36 B. Sun et al. investigated the effect of GO thickness on the performance of PeSCs and J.-S. Yeo et al. compared the performance of RGO incorporated PeSCs with devices containing PEDOT:PSS and GO HTLs. Generally due to the insulating property of GO, the performance of solar cells is highly sensitive to the thickness of the HTL, thus it can be disadvantageous for the realization of GO as HTLs. Furthermore, because several RGOs reduced by using chemicals have low dispersion concentration and stability, they are difficult to apply to the scalable and reproducible manufacturing of PeSCs.37
In this study, as a promising candidate for the practical application of carbonaceous HTLs, we investigated a GO/PEDOT:PSS composite. We expect that the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL can complement the drawbacks of single GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS. Composite HTLs were fabricated by sequential spin-coating of commercialized GO and PEDOT:PSS. Electrical, optical, and structural properties were characterized and their effects on the performance as well as long-term stability of PeSCs were studied.
Experimental
Cleaned ITO coated glass substrates (Samsung Corning Co.) were treated with UV/O3 plasma for 20 min to make a hydrophilic surface state. The commercialized GO (Graphene-Supermarket) was dispersed in DI water with a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 and the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTLs were fabricated by sequential spin-coating of the GO dispersion and PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, CleviosTM P VP AI 4083, a weight ratio of 1:6) at 6000 rpm for 40 s onto ITO followed by annealing at 150 °C for 5 min under atmospheric conditions. For comparison, GO and PEDOT:PSS HTLs were also spin-coated and annealed at the same conditions. To fabricate the CH3NH3PbI3 active layer on each HTL, a 20 wt% precursor solution was prepared by dissolving methyl ammonium iodide and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%, Aldrich) with a 1:1 molar ratio in 2-methoxyethanol. After stirring and filtration, 3.5 vol% CHP was added into the precursor solution as a morphology controller to achieve highly smooth film morphologies.23 Then, the mixture solution was spin-coated at 7000 rpm for 90 s onto each HTL followed by annealing at 140 °C for 30 s in an N2-filled glove box. After that, PCBM electron acceptor layers were formed on CH3NH3PbI3 active layers by the spin-coating of a PCBM solution dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mg ml−1) at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the metal cathode of LiF (0.7 nm)/Ag (80 nm) was thermally evaporated under vacuum with a pressure of <10−6 Torr.
Optical and structural characteristics were carried out using a UV-vis absorption spectrophotometer (Varian AU/DMS-100S) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, HORIBA EX-250), respectively. Surface morphologies of each HTL were observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM, NT-MDT Prima). Information on the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 was obtained from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data taken using a PANalytical Empyrean with Cu Kα (λ = 0.1542 nm) radiation.
After light intensity calibration with a certified reference silicon solar cell, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 under the AM 1.5 G condition of 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra were obtained via an Oriel® IQE-200 QE measurement system. Also, the change in performance with exposure time under atmospheric conditions was recorded without any encapsulation.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, bi-layered heterojunction PeSCs were fabricated with GO, PEDOT:PSS, and GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTLs. Due to its ultimate transparency and easy synthetic process, GO has been more attractive than conventional PEDOT:PSS as a charge transporting interlayer for organic optoelectronics. To achieve high performance with an insulating GO HTL, uniform and full coverage of ITO with very thin GO is important. In addition, post chemical or thermal treatment to improve the electrical properties of GO as a result of the removal of oxygen function groups is needed. In our previous report, ITO was successfully coated with one or two layers of GO by using synthesized GO under critically controlled conditions and by applying a moderate thermal treatment at ∼250 °C for a few minutes, superior PCE and stability was achieved in polymer solar cells, compared to a conventional PEDOT:PSS system.38 However, when we used mass-produced GO, formation of a homogeneous dispersion of GO is difficult and thus full coverage of ITO with high uniformity was not observed. In this case, poor hole transport and collection to ITO can be expected at the uncovered ITO regions due to the direct contact of the perovskite active layer and ITO. Furthermore, non-uniform GO on ITO induces inhomogeneous electrical characteristics owing to the insulating properties of GO which can be considered as a critical problem leading to poor reliability of device performance for the commercial market. To overcome this point, as a practically applicable 2-D carbonaceous HTL for the low temperature (<150 °C) solution processed manufacturing of PeSCs, GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTLs were prepared by successive spin-coating of GO and PEDOT:PSS and compared with single GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS in terms of their influence on the performance as well as long-term stability.

Before the fabrication of the devices, we investigated the electrical, optical and structural characteristics of the HTLs on ITO. Because the light is absorbed through the HTLs on ITO, the optical transparency of the HTL is an important factor determining photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 2(a), all of the HTLs are highly transparent in the overall wavelength range with transmittance values up to 85% and do not significantly alter the transparency of ITO. Next, to find the effect of the HTLs on the electrical properties of intrinsic ITO that affects charge transport and collection, we measured the sheet resistance of ITO substrates with and without the HTLs using a 4 point-probe as exhibited in Fig. 2(b). Since very thin HTLs were coated on ITO, there is no noticeable difference in the sheet resistance. Slightly increased sheet resistance from ∼9.5 Ω □−1 to 9.7–10 Ω □−1 was evaluated after the incorporation of the HTLs. Interestingly, ITO with the GO HTLs showed a relatively large variation in the sheet resistance and this might be attributed to the non-uniform covering of ITO with insulating GO. Fig. 2(c) shows AFM images of each HTL on ITO. Because the surface morphology of the HTL has a crucial influence on the electrical properties of devices such as the series resistance (RS) and the shunt resistance (RSh), we observed AFM images of HTLs on ITO. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values of PEDOT:PSS and GO in an area of 5 μm × 5 μm were evaluated to 1.8 nm and 3.2 nm, respectively. In our previous work, RMS roughness of a GO HTL fabricated using carefully synthesized and dispersed GO was similar to PEDOT:PSS, while a high RMS roughness was obtained in this study. This indicates that mass-produced GO, which is used in this study, can't fully cover the ITO with high uniformity, as we discussed. Meanwhile, by applying PEDOT:PSS on GO, the RMS roughness was decreased to 1.8 nm, indicating that sequential deposition of PEDOT:PSS results in planarization of the rough GO HTL.

As mentioned, for highly efficient PeSCs, control of the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to minimize large morphological deviation is the most important and difficult issue. Because the surface properties of the HTL also strongly affect the quality of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, we examined the structural and optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3 formed on various HTLs. First, we measured absorption properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films on each HTL as shown in Fig. 3(a). The shoulder band around 480 nm and onset at ∼790 nm correlated to the optical band gap of ∼1.5 eV were observed in all absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 on different HTLs.23,39 Absorbance indicating the light harvesting ability was similar for all CH3NH3PbI3. Also, surface morphology that highly affects the device performance was investigated using FE-SEM surface images of CH3NH3PbI3 films on each HTL fabricated under identical conditions (shown in Fig. 3(b)). Both CH3NH3PbI3 films grown on PEDOT:PSS and GO/PEDOT:PSS showed highly homogeneous pin-hole free film morphologies constructed with large crystalline domains. On the other hand, CH3NH3PbI3 films on GO HTLs exhibited pin-holes on the perovskite film acting as defects to induce severe degradation in the performance. For a further examination of the effect of HTLs on the CH3NH3PbI3 films, we studied the structural properties of the perovskite film by XRD analysis. As shown in Fig. 3(c), a strong peak at 14.11° assigned to (110) was observed in the XRD patterns of all perovskite films on the different HTLs. This indicates that every CH3NH3PbI3 film has excellent crystallinity and growth of large domains with a more preferential in-plane orientation of the (110) plane occurred. Additional prominent peaks at 28.41° and 31.9° corresponding to (220) and (310) were also shown for all films.15 From all these results, we can expect higher PCEs of devices with PEDOT:PSS and GO/PEDOT:PSS than those of GO incorporated PeSCs.

The fabrication of the devices was completed with the spin-coating of PCBM electron acceptors and confirmed through cross-sectional SEM images. As shown in Fig. 4, similar thicknesses of CH3NH3PbI3 (∼110 nm) and PCBM (∼60 nm) layers were formed, irrespective of the HTLs. The thickness of GO was too thin to be distinguished as shown in Fig. 4(b). The thickness of single PEDOT:PSS and GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTLs were almost the same and evaluated to be ∼25 nm. Formation of uniform and dense CH3NH3PbI3 films on PEDOT:PSS and GO/PEDOT:PSS also can be confirmed in the cross-sectional images. In contrast, the cross-sectional image of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the GO HTL showed many pin-holes in the active layer, in accordance with the surface morphology.

The potential of the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite as a HTL in PeSCs was evaluated by the measurement of J–V characteristics under standard conditions. For comparison, solar cells employing PEDOT:PSS and GO also were characterized and the resultant performances of each device are shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table 1. When the devices were fabricated without any HTLs, seriously poor performance was obtained or devices did not operate. Hence, we believed that the HTL is a crucial requirement for the successful operation of PeSCs. The PeSC with a conventional PEDOT:PSS HTL showed a reasonable PCE of 8.23% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.80 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 14.35 mA cm−2, and fill-factor (FF) of 71.61%. In the case of the device with GO, a relatively poor performance (VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 12.75 mA cm−2, FF of 59.58%, and PCE of 6.42%) was exhibited. It is attributed to the non-uniform formation of an electrically insulating GO layer on ITO and the growth of an inhomogeneous perovskite active layer with many pin-holes on the GO HTL. In contrast, by using the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL superior performance to single GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS based PeSCs was achieved as follows: VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 15.72 mA cm−2, FF of 73.71%, and PCE of 9.74%. In particular, anomalous hysteresis has been raised as an important issue to confirm the accurate characterization of PeSCs. Several studies on the hysteresis of PeSCs reported that perovskite solar cell architectures consisting of mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/hole transport materials (HTMs) undergo a large hysteresis with the scan direction in the J–V measurement.7,40 On the other hand, planar structured PeSCs of perovskite and PCBM have been demonstrated to show negligible hysteresis behavior due to more efficient electron extraction through PCBM, resulting in balanced electron and hole transport.41–43 We also have carefully observed the hysteresis properties of PeSCs for the accurate characterization of J–V performance. As shown in Table 1, devices with PEDOT:PSS, GO, and GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTLs showed virtually no hysteresis in forward and reverse scan directions.

For further confirmation on the possibility of using GO/PEDOT:PSS HTLs, the reliability of the device performances was investigated and important parameters were recorded in Fig. 5(b). GO/PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS based devices showed excellent reproducible performances. On the contrary, devices with GO exhibited relatively wide variations due to the poor uniformity of GO and large morphological deviations of the perovskite active layers. EQE and IQE of the devices with different HTLs were also measured as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The calculated JSC values using the EQE spectra were well-matched with the JSC values evaluated from the J–V curves and the PeSC employing the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL illustrated the highest and broadest spectrum from 300 nm to 800 nm. In the case of the PeSC containing GO/PEDOT:PSS, an EQE of ∼80% was obtained at the maximum peak, whereas the PEDOT:PSS based device exhibited a lower EQE of ∼65%. Moreover, the IQE spectrum of the PeSC using the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL showed higher values in the overall wavelength range compared to the spectra of PEDOT:PSS and GO based devices. Although the absorbance of the perovskite active layers on each HTL is similar as discussed, the highest IQE was obtained in the case of the composite HTL incorporated device. This indicates that photon-to-electron conversion occurs more efficiently in the PeSC with the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL.
The reasons for the improvement in the performance can be found from the analysis of the electrical properties of each device. The RS and RSh, strongly affecting the overall performance of the devices, were calculated from the J–V curves shown in Fig. 6(a). By applying the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL, a reduced RS was obtained compared to GO and PEDOT:PSS based devices. This suggests the superior charge transport ability of the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL. According to the work-function (WF) of GO and PEDOT:PSS measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), the energy diagram of each layer can be drawn like Fig. 6(b). A well-matched WF between GO (4.9 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV) probably results in more efficient charge transport and collection to ITO. Furthermore, a higher RSh was evaluated in the case of the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL, implying a more efficient suppression of carrier recombination. The existence of GO with a large bandgap of ∼3.6 eV might induce the effective blocking of electrons.44 The aforementioned reasons suggest that the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL can be a promising alternative to conventional PEDOT:PSS.

Finally, to examine one of the most important requirements for the commercialization of PeSCs, the effect of different HTLs on the long-term stability was investigated. The change of PCE with exposure time under atmospheric conditions (temperature of 21–24 °C and humidity of 38–55%) was recorded without any encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS based device showed a sharp decline, while the degradation of the PCE was considerably improved by inserting the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL or GO HTL. The improved stability in the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL is expected because GO prohibits direct contact of ITO with highly acidic PEDOT:PSS. An unexpected reason for the improved stability was found through the XRD measurements. As shown in Fig. 7(b), we measured the XRD patterns of the perovskite layers that were exposed to atmospheric conditions for 2 days and 5 days. In the case of the XRD patterns of the as-fabricated perovskite layer on different HTLs, there is no noticeable difference. After exposure to air for 2 days, a new peak at 12.65° assigned to the (001) crystal plane of PbI2 was observed in the XRD patterns of every perovskite layer. In particular, a more prominent (001) peak of PbI2 with the decreasing of the (110) peak of CH3NH3PbI3 was shown in the XRD patterns of the perovskite layer deposited on conventional PEDOT:PSS. This indicates that severe degradation of the perovskite structure had occurred on PEDOT:PSS. After 5 days, a strong (001) PbI2 peak was observed in all perovskite layers. The color of the films also changed from dark brown to yellow resulting from the decomposition of crystalline perovskite. We believed that the faster decomposition of perovskite on PEDOT:PSS than that on GO or GO/PEDOT:PSS also caused significant degradation in the PCE of the device. Consequently, the PeSC using the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL exhibited excellent efficiency and reliability as well as improved stability compared to general PEDOT:PSS based PeSCs. For the further improvement of the stability without any degradation of the PCE, development of a novel composite of GO with an oxide HTL is currently underway.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite, which is considered as a promising candidate to complement the drawbacks of single GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS, was employed as a HTL in planar heterojunction PeSCs. A conventional PEDOT:PSS based PeSC showed a reasonable PCE of 8.23%, while a device with a single GO HTL exhibited a relatively low performance of 6.42%. Low efficiency was caused by the inhomogeneous coating of ITO with mass-produced GO, resulting in the poor morphology of the perovskite layer. In contrast, a PeSC with the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite fabricated by sequential spin-coating of GO and PEDOT:PSS, demonstrated superior performance as follows: VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 15.72 mA cm−2, FF of 73.71%, and PCE of 9.74%. A well-matched WF between GO (4.9 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV) probably results in more efficient hole transport and collection to ITO. In fact, decreased RS, which is an important parameter determining carrier transport and collection, was evaluated from the J–V curves. Higher RSh, implying more efficient suppression of carrier recombination, was also calculated. The existence of GO with a large bandgap of ∼3.6 eV might induce effective blocking of electrons. The aforementioned reasons suggest that a decreased RS and increased RSh strongly affect the improvement of the performance of GO/PEDOT:PSS based PeSCs. Furthermore, significant enhancement in the stability under atmospheric conditions was observed, compared to a conventional PEDOT:PSS system. GO prohibiting direct contact of ITO with highly acidic PEDOT:PSS might result in improved stability. Also, we found that decomposition of perovskite to PbI2 slowly occurred when the perovskite was prepared on a GO/PEDOT:PSS HTL. This phenomenon was reproducibly observed in the XRD analysis. The study on the restricted decomposition of perovskite on GO/PEDOT:PSS is currently underway. These results demonstrate that the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite can be sufficiently considered as practically applicable 2-D carbonaceous HTLs for low temperature solution processed manufacturing of PeSCs.
