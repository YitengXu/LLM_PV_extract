    , Accepted 26th November 2015First published on 27th November 2015AbstractTo obtain a broad spectral response in the visible region, TiO2 film is co-sensitized with a porphyrin dye (FNE57 or FNE59) and an organic dye (FNE46). It is found that the stepwise co-sensitization in one single dye solution followed by in another single dye solution is better than the co-sensitization in a cocktail solution in terms of photovoltaic performance. The stepwise co-sensitization first with a porphyrin dye and then with an organic dye outperforms that in a reverse order. DSSC devices based on co-sensitizers FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 with a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte generate power conversion efficiencies of 7.88% and 8.14%, respectively, which exhibits remarkable efficiency improvements of 61% and 35%, as compared with devices sensitized with the porphyrin dyes FNE57 and FNE59, respectively. Co-sensitization brings about a much improved short-circuit photocurrent due to the complementary absorption of the two sensitizers. The observed enhancement of incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency from individual dye sensitization to co-sensitization is attributed to the improved charge collection efficiency rather than to the light harvesting efficiency. Interestingly, the open-circuit photovoltage for the co-sensitization system comes between the higher voltage for the porphyrin dye (FNE57 or FNE59) and the lower voltage for the organic dye (FNE46), which is well correlated with their electron lifetimes. This finding indicates that not only the spectral complementation but also the electron lifetime should be considered to select dyes for co-sensitization.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) made from mesoporous TiO2 electrodes have drawn much attention as promising candidates because of their high power conversion efficiencies, ease of fabrication, and low manufacturing costs.1–3 The photosensitizers, as important components in DSSCs, play a crucial role in getting a higher solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency. A lot of efforts have been devoted to the development of novel and efficient sensitizers, such as ruthenium complexes,4–7 zinc porphyrins8–12 and metal-free organic dyes,13–17 serving as efficient light harvesters for DSSCs. DSSCs employing ruthenium(II)-based dyes have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >11% so far.4,6,18 However, the rare resources of ruthenium and environmental problems may hamper their widespread applications. Thus, metal-free organic dyes and noble-metal-free porphyrins have been intensively explored owing to their ease of molecular modification and large molar extinction coefficients.8–17
Porphyrins and related derivatives have been considered to be promising candidates for DSSCs due to their intense Soret and Q bands, versatile modifications of their core, and tuneable spectral properties. The breakthrough achieved in 2011 by Michael Grätzel et al. is a PCE of 12.3% obtained from a push–pull zinc porphyrin YD2-o-C8 co-sensitized with an organic dye (Y123).10 This milestone finding stimulates the investigation of D–π–A porphyrin dyes in developing high-efficiency DSSCs.11,12,19–23 However, the drawback of porphyrin dyes is that they display pretty weak absorption in the spectral region between the Soret and Q bands. To overcome this drawback, the design of sensitizers towards broad visible light absorption into the near-infrared (NIR) region22,24–26 and co-sensitization21,27–30 with different dyes (cocktail-type) has been demonstrated to be an effective means to broaden the photoelectric response range. Among them, co-sensitization through a combination of two or more dyes having complementary absorption properties has been demonstrated to extend the spectral response range effectively. For example, the co-sensitization of two organic dyes (JK2 and SQ1) with complementary spectral responses resulted in an improved photovoltaic performance relative to those of the individual dyes;31 the co-sensitization of TiO2 films with ruthenium dye (the black dye) and an organic dye Y1 yielded a significantly enhanced photocurrent such that the device performance attained a PCE of 11.28%.27 For porphyrins, a device based on the co-sensitization of a TiO2 film with XW4 and an organic dye C1 showed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) increase by 24% and a slight improvement of the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) by 5%, resulting in an improved cell efficiency (10.45%).21 However, the co-sensitization of YD2-o-C8 with Y123 produced an enhancement of Jsc from 17.3 to 18.2 mA cm−2 but a decrease in Voc from 965 to 891 mV.10 While the co-sensitization is extensively employed for photocurrent enhancement, its effect on Voc, the cause of the voltage change, and the effect of the co-sensitization sequence on solar cell performance have rarely been studied.
Recently, we have designed and synthesized three novel D–π–A Zn(II)-porphyrin sensitizers (FNE57, FNE58, and FNE59) containing the same electron donating moiety (carbazole) and the same electron-withdrawing moiety (cyanoacrylic acid).32 The effect of the position of the incorporated auxiliary acceptor, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (DPQ), on the absorption properties of the sensitizer and the photovoltaic performance is systematically investigated. However, a quasi-solid-state device based on the porphyrin dye FNE59 only reaps a PCE of 6.02%. In an effort to obtain highly efficient properties for porphyrin sensitizers, we make use of an organic dye (FNE46),33 which has a strong light response at 525 nm to complement the spectral response of porphyrin sensitized devices, to co-sensitize the TiO2 film aiming at enhancing the absorption in the valley between the Soret and Q bands for the porphyrin. As the quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte is much better than the volatile organic electrolyte in view of long-term stability, quasi-solid-state DSSCs have been systematically studied in this work. To understand the effect of the co-sensitization sequence on the solar cell performance, we have compared the stepwise co-sensitization in different orders. Furthermore, the co-sensitization effect on the photovoltage and the cause of the voltage change have also been investigated in order to clarify the factors influencing the co-sensitization effect besides the spectral complementation.
Experimental section
Synthesis of dyes
The detailed synthetic processes for porphyrin dyes (FNE57 and FNE59) have been reported in the literature.32 Firstly, the porphyrin core was obtained using functionalized aldehyde precursors and 2,2′-dipyrromethane through acid-catalyzed condensation in dichloromethane followed by oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone. Then, the monoaldehyde-substituted porphyrin derivative was synthesized by Vilsmeier reaction. Zn(II)-porphyrin was prepared by the metalation of free base porphyrin and zinc acetate. Finally, the desired Zn(II)-porphyrin sensitizers FNE57 and FNE59 were obtained through a Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The organic dye FNE46 was prepared according to a previous method.33 The dye starting from 5,8-dibromoquinoxaline, was synthesized via Stille coupling, Vilsmeier reaction, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation. All target dyes were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.
Characterization and measurements
The UV–vis absorption spectra of the dyes were measured in THF solutions and on TiO2 films using a Shimadzu UV–2550PC spectrophotometer. The time-resolved luminescence experiments were recorded on a Lifespec-ps PDL 800-B (Edinburgh). The charge densities at the open-circuit were investigated using the charge extraction method.34 The electron lifetimes were obtained from controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS),35 which was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany) equipped with a white light emitting diode (LED). The intensity-modulated spectra were scanned in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz under the illumination of an LED light with various light intensities ranging from 20 to 120 W m−2, with a modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
A 15 μm thick TiO2 film (active area 0.25 cm2) was prepared using a screen-printing technique. The films were first sintered at 500 °C for 2 h and then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min before immersing in dye solutions. 0.2 mM porphyrin solutions containing 0.4 mM deoxycholic acid (DCA)32 and 0.4 mM FNE46 were used in this work. TiO2 films were immersed in a single dye solution or a cocktail-type dye solution for 18 h. For the stepwise co-sensitization, TiO2 electrodes were first immersed in a porphyrin dye solution (0.2 mM in THF/ethanol, 3:2, v/v) with 0.4 mM DCA for 6 h, rinsed with acetonitrile, and then transferred into FNE46 solution (0.4 mM in THF) for 12 h. For comparison, stepwise co-sensitization with opposite order was also carried out. Afterwards, the electrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile to remove the physically adsorbed dyes. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by coating a drop of H2PtCl6 solution on an FTO plate and heating for 30 min at 400 °C. A DSSC device was fabricated with a dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode, Pt-counter electrode and a redox electrolyte. The quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a UV curing sealant. The working performance of the DSSCs was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light coming from a solar simulator (Sol3A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter, Newport). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150). The action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were recorded using an SM-250 system (Bunkoh-Keiki, Japan). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured using a Si detector (S1337-1010BQ).
Results and discussion
Structures and energy levels of dyes
The structures of the porphyrin dyes (FNE57 and FNE59) and the co-sensitizer (FNE46) are depicted in Scheme 1a, and the energy diagram is shown in Scheme 1b.32,33 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the three dye molecules are more negative than the conduction band (CB, −0.50 V vs. NHE) of TiO2 (Scheme 1b), which enables the electron injection from the excited states of the dyes to the CB of TiO2.36 On the other hand, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the three dyes are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.40 V vs. NHE, Scheme 1b), indicating that the oxidized dyes generated by the electron injection process can thermodynamically accept electrons from I− ions to regenerate the oxidized dye molecules.

Optical properties

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of FNE57, FNE59, and FNE46 in THF solution and on TiO2 films, respectively. The porphyrin FNE57 in a THF solution shows a strong absorption peak centered at 427 nm and two weak absorption peaks at 557 and 598 nm, which respectively correspond to the Soret and Q bands of porphyrin-based dye molecules.32 For FNE59, the Soret band is located at 425 nm, and the Q bands are located at 557 and 597 nm. FNE46 presents strong absorption between 460 and 540 nm in THF solution (Fig. 1a),33 where the absorption for the porphyrins is very weak. The complementary absorption of FNE46 and the porphyrins is crucial to co-sensitization.37

Fig. 1b presents the absorption spectra of the individual dye and co-sensitizer anchored TiO2 films on transparent conducting glass. When the individual dye molecule was attached onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, similar absorption features to the corresponding dye solutions were observed for sensitizers FNE57 and FNE59. However, a hypochromic shift of 25 nm was observed for the sensitizer FNE46, which is attributed to the H-type aggregation of FNE46 on the TiO2 surface.38 The co-adsorbed TiO2 film with FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 exhibited enhanced light absorption as compared with the individual dye loaded films. Notably, the absorption around the Q band was obviously broadened in comparison to the absorption characteristics in solution. Moreover, the ratio of intensities at 558 and 430 nm was increased from 0.1 (FNE57 and FNE59) to 0.5 (FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46), respectively, indicating that the absorption around the Q bands was strengthened significantly by the co-sensitization of FNE46. And the ratio of intensities at 430 and 493 nm was increased from 0.77 for FNE46 to 1.19 for FNE57 + FNE46 and 1.37 for FNE59 + FNE46, respectively, indicating that the absorption near 430 nm for FNE46 was also complemented by the Soret band of the porphyrin dyes. The broad and strong spectral coverage from 400 to 700 nm achieved with the co-sensitization of FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 exhibits panchromatic sunlight harvesting to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE).
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The quasi solid-state DSSCs co-sensitized by FNE57 (or FNE59) with FNE46 on TiO2 films of thickness 15 μm were achieved via a stepwise approach: the TiO2 electrode was firstly immersed in the FNE57 (or FNE59) solution for 6 h and then immersed in the FNE46 solution for 12 h. Afterwards, the co-sensitized film was assembled into a DSSC device with a Pt-coated counter electrode and filled with a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows the IPCE action spectra as a function of the light wavelength and the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the individual dye or co-sensitizer based devices under standard test conditions, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that the IPCE spectra of individual FNE57, FNE59, and FNE46 display typical characteristics of the electronic absorption of the sensitized TiO2 layer.32,33 After co-sensitization, the IPCE spectra of FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 became broader with high IPCE values between 400 and 650 nm, and the tail extended to 800 nm.

The IPCE is determined by the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), the quantum yield of electron injection (Φinj), and the collection efficiency of the photo-generated charge carriers (Φcoll), as shown in the following equation:4 IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × Φinj × Φcoll(1) These different factors will be clarified separately to find out the reasons for the much higher IPCE values obtained with co-sensitizers as compared to those obtained with the single dye. Here, as all the single dyes have similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels, Φinj should be similar for the three individual dyes and their mixtures. As the absorbance at the Soret band for FNE57 and FNE59 and the absorbance at 495 nm for FNE46 loaded 2.5 μm thick TiO2 films are 0.73, 0.95, and 0.47, respectively, the LHE for the 15 μm dye-loaded TiO2 film is close to unity for all these films. Owing to the similar LHE and Φinj, the IPCE enhancement from individual dye sensitization to co-sensitization should be attributed to the improved charge collection efficiency.
To further unravel the possible difference of injection efficiency between the individual dye and co-sensitizers, time-resolved luminescence experiments were performed. Fig. S1 in the ESI† presents the time-resolved luminescence of the three individual dyes in THF solutions and adsorbed on 2.5 μm TiO2 films. The fluorescence lifetimes for FNE57, FNE59, and FNE46 in THF solutions were 1.08, 0.96, and 0.45 ns, respectively. The fluorescence of FNE57 and FNE59 decayed more rapidly than the organic dye FNE46. The fluorescence decay was further enhanced for co-sensitizers FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 adsorbed on the TiO2 film. The rapid quenching of luminescence suggests unity charge injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2.10,39
The photovoltaic results display a clear trend with the PCE for the single-dye sensitized devices in the following order: FNE46 (PCE = 6.87%) > FNE59 (PCE = 6.02%) > FNE57 (PCE = 4.90%). Upon co-sensitization, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE57 + FNE46 and FNE59 + FNE46 gave improved DSSC performance, which achieved a Jsc of 16.59 and 17.03 mA cm−2, a Voc of 676 and 683 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, corresponding to a PCE of 7.88 and 8.14%. The Jsc value of the DSSC with co-sensitizer sensitized devices is 61% and 35% higher than that of FNE57 and FNE59, respectively, as weak Q bands of porphyrins are strengthened by the absorption of FNE46. Owing to the significant improvement of Jsc, the PCE is enhanced notably upon co-sensitization.
To study the effect of the dye loading sequence on the device performance, we investigated the soaking process of FNE59 and FNE46 dyes, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The anode TiO2 film sensitized first with FNE59 (6 h) and then with FNE46 (12 h) (denoted as A) gave the best PCE of 8.14%. When a reverse soaking process was applied, the device (denoted as B) achieved a PCE of 7.88%. When the anode film was immersed in a cocktail dye solution of FNE46 + FNE59, the efficiency depended on the molar ratio of the two dyes. The molar ratio between co-sensitizers FNE59 and FNE46 was optimized for a cocktail-type quasi-solid-state DSSC, and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As seen in Table S2 (ESI†), the FNE46 and FNE59 co-sensitized device with a molar ratio of 3.5:1 (denoted as C, Table 1) achieved the best efficiency of 7.56%.
The efficiency increases in the order of C, B, A, which is consistent with the Jsc order of C (16.32 mA cm−2) < B (16.60 mA cm−2) < A (17.03 mA cm−2). The photocurrent order is confirmed by the IPCE spectra shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), where the IPCE values in the visible region increase in the order of C < B < A (see the ESI†). To understand the photocurrent differences from a chemistry perspective, the quantity of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 was estimated by desorbing the dyes from the TiO2 film into a 0.01 M Bu4NOH–THF solution. Table S3 (ESI†) lists the dye-loading densities calculated from the absorption spectra of the resultant solutions (see the ESI†). The adsorbed amount of porphyrin in film B (1.96 × 10−8 mol cm−2) is lower than that in film A (2.77 × 10−8 mol cm−2) by 29% while the loading amount of FNE46 is similar in both films, indicating that the first loading of the FNE46 dye may inhibit further adsorption of the bulky porphyrin while first loading of the bulky porphyrin does not influence the adsorption of FNE46 with smaller size. Therefore, device A produced a higher Jsc than device B. Compared with A and B, the lower photocurrent of C is attributable to its smaller amount of dye adsorption on the TiO2 film. The above results suggested that the incubation of the FNE59-adsorbed film in FNE46 solution is the most appropriate method in our research.
It is noted that Voc is different for these devices. Voc/mV displays a systematic trend for devices in the order of FNE59 (703) > FNE57 (689) > FNE59 + FNE46 (683) > FNE57 + FNE46 (676) > FNE46 (661). Voc of a DSSC device is determined by the conduction band edge and the recombination of photo-injected electrons in the TiO2 film with either electron accepting species in electrolytes or dye cations.40 To understand the difference of Voc for these devices, the relative conduction band edge positions and electron lifetimes in the DSSCs were investigated by means of the charge extraction technique and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurement. Fig. 3 shows the plot of Vocvs. Q for the single dye-sensitized and co-sensitized systems at seven intensities of white light from a LED lamp. In general, DSSCs sensitized with the individual dye or co-sensitizers feature a similar extracted charge (Q) at the same potential bias Voc, suggesting a similar conduction band edge of TiO2 for these devices. Therefore, the different Voc values observed for these quasi-solid-state DSSCs should be ascribed to the different charge recombination kinetics.

Fig. 4 shows the electron lifetime as a function of the charge density for these quasi-solid-state DSSCs. The electron lifetime was measured by IMVS and obtained from the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) according to eqn (2):41,42 τ = (2πfmin)−1(2)
 Fig. 4  Electron lifetime as a function of charge density at open-circuit photovoltage for DSSCs based on FNE57, FNE59, FNE46, FNE57 + FNE46, and FNE59 + FNE46. 
As shown in Fig. 4, the porphyrin dye exhibits higher electron lifetime than the organic dye. This is due to the bulky structure of the porphyrin, which is more effective to block charge recombination between electrons and I3− ions. As FNE59 is bulkier than FNE57, it is reasonable that the former gives a longer electron lifetime than the latter.32 The co-sensitized system comes between the individual dyes in the electron lifetime, which is because the porphyrin has a stronger suppressing ability of charge recombination than FNE46. The electron lifetime decreases in the order of FNE59 > FNE57 > FNE59 + FNE46 > FNE57 + FNE46 > FNE46 at a given charge Q, which is consistent with the trend of variation of Voc. Therefore, the different Voc values can be explained by their different electron lifetimes because these photoanodes have similar CB edges.
Co-sensitization has been extensively studied using porphyrin dyes and metal-free organic dyes.43–45 While the Jsc enhancement was achieved, Voc sometimes increased and sometimes decreased, depending on the co-sensitization system. This was attributed to the collective effect of the shifted conduction band and the changed charge recombination rate, as revealed by Diau et al.44,45 In our system, as the conduction band does not shift, Voc is well correlated with the electron lifetime. The experimental results suggest that not only the spectral complementation but also the electron lifetime should be considered to select dyes for co-sensitization. For future research work on co-sensitization, one should first select dyes having good spectral complementation, and then study the kinetics of charge recombination. Those dyes possessing both good spectral complementation and the same or similar electron lifetime should be selected for co-sensitization. This not only can improve Jsc significantly, but also can avoid voltage loss.
For future practical applications, it is of importance for the DSSC devices to achieve a long lifetime. Since quasi-solid-state gel electrolytes are non-flowing and non-volatile, the corresponding quasi-solid-state DSSCs have shown good stability. We tested the stability for the FNE59 + FNE46 co-sensitized quasi-solid-state DSSCs under one sun soaking for a period of 1000 h. Fig. 5 shows the temporal variations of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE for the system. Voc, FF, and PCE values increased initially followed by a plateau, while the Jsc values faintly decreased at the beginning and then remained almost constant. For example, the device attained a PCE from 7.62% to 7.79% during the period of 24–120 h; the efficiency then increased to 8.14% at 200 h. After 200 h, the performance of the co-sensitized device remained stable until the end of the test (1000 h). The overall efficiency changed within 7% of the initial value during 1000 h of one sun soaking, which indicates that the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on co-sensitizers FNE59 + FNE46 demonstrates good long-term stability during light soaking.

Conclusions
In summary, porphyrin dyes show obviously enhanced photovoltaic performance for quasi-solid-state DSSCs when co-sensitized with an organic dye that has a complementary spectral response. The co-sensitization approach significantly enhanced the Jsc value and broadened the IPCE response. Thus, the best cell gives Jsc = 17.03 mA cm−2, Voc = 683 mV, FF = 0.70, and PCE = 8.14% under standard AM1.5G one-sun irradiation, which exhibits remarkable overall efficiency improvement of 35% as compared with the device individually sensitized by the porphyrin dye FNE59. The co-sensitized devices also exhibit good long-term stability after continuous light soaking for 1000 h. The photovoltaic performances of single-dye and co-sensitized systems are related to the absorption properties of the dye loaded TiO2 film and the charge recombination rate for the device. The enhanced Jsc of the co-sensitized systems is due to the combined light-harvesting effect of two dyes that have a complementary absorption range. The change of Voc is well correlated with the electron lifetime. To get a high photovoltage for the co-sensitized system, the same or similar electron lifetime of the used dyes should also be considered in addition to the spectral complementation.
