1. Introduction
Compared to many other types of photovoltaic technologies that have been explored to convert sunlight to electricity, polymer solar cells (PSCs) are attracting increasing attention due to their relatively shorter energy payback time which makes them more affordable in the mid-long term.1 In addition, PSCs are lightweight and flexible, they can be made from abundantly available raw materials and fabricated on a large scale by employing solution-based techniques such as screen printing, spray coating, etc.2–4 With the synergistic efforts of material innovation, morphology control and interface engineering, significant progresses have been made in organic photovoltaics in the past decade, and the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 12% have been achieved in both single-junction and tandem PSCs.5–9 At the same time, stability studies have showed a possible operating lifetime of around 10 years for PSCs.10,11 All these significant advances suggest a bright future for PSCs.
The most efficient PSCs are based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure with p-type semiconducting polymers as electron donors and n-type materials (fullerene derivatives, conjugated polymers, or small molecules) as electron acceptors.12,13 Since the invention of the BHJ solar cells in 1995,12 fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM and PC71BM) have become dominant acceptors due to their fast photo-induced electron-transfer, low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, high electron mobilities, and unique spherical structures which tend to phase separate from rod-like semiconducting polymers.2 Therefore, in the past two decades, most semiconducting polymers were designed to match the energy levels as well as the absorption profiles of fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM, etc.). It is known that the absorption bands of most fullerene derivatives are located in the short-wavelength region (300–600 nm). Therefore, low bandgap (LBG) polymers have the advantage of enhanced light absorption in comparison with wide bandgap (WBG) polymers due to the less spectral overlap in the short-wavelength region. For this reason, a WBG polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), is becoming less popular although it is a standard donor material used to blend with fullerene derivatives in the early years of research on PSCs. In contrast, the PCEs of PSCs have exceeded 10% with optimized LBG polymers which have complementary absorption with fullerene derivatives.14–16 Nonetheless, it is difficult to further improve the PCE of single-junction PSCs to far beyond 10% using LBG polymers and fullerene derivatives because of the trade-off between their short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) values. As such, a multi-junction device with a tandem structure is an alternative for broadening the light-harvesting spectra and increasing the VOC values at the same time. For a tandem device, two cells with BHJ layers having complementary absorption spectra are usually needed, where a WBG material is utilized in a bottom cell and a LBG material is used in a top cell. Recently, efficient tandem devices were demonstrated by combining high performance WBG polymers with LBG copolymers.6,17–20 At the same time, some benchmark non-fullerene acceptors were used to replace the fullerene derivatives to achieve PSCs with PCEs over 10%.9,21a Unlike traditional fullerene electron acceptors which have intense absorption bands in the short-wavelength region, these non-fullerene acceptors exhibit strong absorption bands in the long-wavelength region. Thus, in order to achieve complementary absorption, donor materials with relatively wide bandgaps have been demonstrated to be successful in achieving high performance non-fullerene PSCs.21b–h For example, with a benzodithiophene-based WBG copolymer, Sun et al. fabricated efficient non-fullerene PSCs which exhibited an outstanding PCE of 10.6%.21m Furthermore, WBG polymers are also useful in improving the absorption strength in the short wavelength region of ternary PSCs based on LBG polymers.21i–l Therefore, it is time to reevaluate the importance of WBG polymers in enhancing the performance of PSCs.
For easy reference, semiconducting polymers in this review are classified into two categories according to their optical bandgaps: LBG (Eg < 1.8 eV)22a,b and WBG (Eg ≥ 1.8 eV).22c It should be noted that for some polymers with the optical bandgap in the range of 1.6–1.8 eV, they were classified as medium bandgap polymers.22d,e Since there have been several comprehensive and excellent reviews on conjugated polymers for PSCs with an emphasis on LBG copolymers,3,23 in this article we mainly focus on the recent advances of WBG polymers regarding their structure–photovoltaic property relationships. These WBG polymers have been mainly used for fullerene PSCs although some of them have also been used for efficient non-fullerene PSCs. It should be pointed out that this review mainly considers recent WBG semiconducting polymers for PSCs with PCEs >5% due to limited space and all the bandgaps of the polymers summarized in this review mean their optical bandgaps. We hope that this review can provide useful guidelines for the future rational design of high performance WBG polymers.
2. Wide bandgap polymers
The PCE of a solar cell is calculated by the equation of PCE = VOC × JSC × FF/PIN, where VOC is the open-circuit voltage, JSC is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor, and PIN is the input power. As is known, the bandgap of a material is determined by the energy level difference between its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). For solar cell application, LBG polymers usually have strong absorption bands in the long wavelength region and they can harvest more photons which is beneficial for achieving increased JSC values of the resulting devices, whereas, a polymer with a deeper HOMO energy level will lead to a PSC with a large VOC because the VOC of a device is found to be correlated with the energy difference between the LUMO of acceptor materials (e.g., fullerene derivatives) and the HOMO of donor materials (p-type semiconducting polymers). Therefore, an ideal WBG polymer should exhibit a deeper HOMO energy level and a suitable absorption band in the short wavelength region which is complementary to that of the non-fullerene acceptor material or the other LBG material for a given tandem or ternary blend device. By now, there are some excellent electron-rich homopolymers exhibiting wide bandgaps. With the donor–donor type molecular configuration, overlarge bandgaps would be obtained if deep HOMO levels of the homopolymers are maintained.24 Note that a polymer with an extremely wide bandgap may sacrifice too much light absorption thereby reducing the JSC. However, through rational side chain modification, homopolymers with down-shifted HOMO levels and reduced bandgaps can also be achieved.25 Nonetheless, in the past decade, the donor–acceptor (D–A) design strategy has been dominant for WBG conjugated polymers. Different from the homopolymers which have only an electron-rich repeat unit, the repeat unit of D–A polymers comprises a donor moiety and an acceptor moiety. In D–A polymers, the energy levels and bandgaps can be rationally tuned through the selection of donors (or acceptors) with different electron donating (or withdrawing) abilities. The molecular orbital hybridization effect between D and A can lead to a redistribution of molecular orbitals of D and A, which generates relatively higher-lying HOMO and lower-lying LUMO levels for the newly formed molecular orbitals (see Fig. 1).2 In addition, one of the characteristics of D–A polymers is that their HOMO and LUMO levels are mainly localized on the D moiety and the A moiety, respectively. Therefore, the energy levels of the conjugated copolymers can be optimized by independently tuning the electronic properties of the D and A units.3 To obtain WBG polymers based on this design strategy, both the electron-donating ability of D and the electron-withdrawing ability of A should be relatively weak because a weak D unit lowers the HOMO level and a weak A unit raises the LUMO level of D–A copolymers.

2.1. Homopolymers
The repeating unit of a homopolymer usually comprises a single aromatic unit or fused aromatic rings. Fig. 2 depicts the chemical structures of several typical high performance homopolymers. P1, P2 and P3 are all classified as homopolymers with the same polymer backbone although P2 and P3 can also be classified as D–A copolymers if the relatively electron deficient thiophene units are treated as acceptors. The corresponding bandgaps, HOMO levels, and photovoltaic properties of the homopolymers are shown in Table 1. All the polymers exhibit large bandgaps over 1.90 eV. The physical properties of these homopolymers are mainly determined by the intrinsic properties of the constituting single or fused aromatics, with appreciable contribution from steric hindrance between adjacent repeating units.24

P3HT (P1) is the most classic homopolymer with a bandgap of 1.90 eV. Through the optimization of the active layer morphology via thermal or solvent annealing, P3HT:PC61BM-based PSCs showed PCEs of 4–5%.26–28 The small energy difference between the HOMO level of P3HT and the LUMO level of PC61BM leads to a low VOC of around 0.60 V for the corresponding PSC. To increase the VOC of P3HT-based PSCs, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) with a higher-lying LUMO level was used as the acceptor material. As a result, an improved PCE of 6.48% with an increased VOC of 0.84 V was obtained from the P3HT:ICBA-based device.29 This PCE can be further enhanced to 7.5% by device optimizations.30,31 Another way to increase the VOC of a polythiophene:PC61BM-based device is to decrease the HOMO level of the donor material. Hou and coworkers developed a homopolythiophene derivative, P2, by attaching electron-withdrawing carboxylate substituents in the side chain. The HOMO level of P2 was determined to be −5.26 eV, much deeper than that of P3HT (−4.90 eV). Therefore, PSCs based on P2:PC71BM under optimal conditions exhibited a PCE of 7.2% with a high VOC of 0.91 V.25 With the relatively large bandgap, P2 is also an excellent donor material for non-fullerene PSCs. When 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) with a low bandgap was used as an acceptor material, the resulting device exhibited a high PCE of 10.16%.32 Besides, the introduction of fluorine atoms on the polythiophene backbone can decrease the HOMO levels of the resulting copolymers. Jo et al. synthesized a fluorinated polythiophene derivative, P3, which has a bandgap of 1.91 eV and a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.42 eV. As a result, the P3-based devices exhibited an increased VOC of 0.87 V with a PCE of 5.2%.33
Benzodithiophene (BDT) is one of the most popular donor units for semiconducting polymers due to its rigid and planar structure which is beneficial for achieving polymers with high hole mobilities, tunable molecular energy levels and optical bandgaps.34,35 Kim and co-workers developed a novel BDT-based homopolymer (P4) with a wide bandgap of 2.13 eV and a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.44 eV. The PSC based on P4 exhibited a PCE of 6.12%, benefiting from both high VOC (0.93 V) and large JSC (11.95 mA cm−2) values of the device.36 Later, Hwang et al. introduced an alkylthio-substituted thiophene on the BDT and synthesized another BDT-based homopolymer (P5). They found that the polymers with the alkylthiothiophene substituent have a down-shifted HOMO energy level and a higher absorption coefficient than their corresponding alkylthiophene-based counterparts. Consequently, an increased VOC of 0.99 V was achieved for the P5:PC71BM-based PSC in addition to a high PCE of 7.05%.37
Based on a single-type repeat unit, homopolymers can be synthesized by a shorter synthetic route in comparison with D–A type copolymers. However, there are less chemical structural modifications available for fine tuning of their chemical, physical and photovoltaic properties.
2.2. D–A type copolymers based on fluorene, indenofluorene and related derivatives
As a planar aromatic unit, fluorene has been used for constructing D–A copolymers which have features of wide bandgaps and deep-lying HOMO energy levels. When one of the two benzene rings in the fluorene is replaced by a thiophene ring, indenothiophene is formed. At the 9-position (sp3-hybridized carbon) of fluorene, various functional groups (such as Si and N atoms and carbon double bonds) can be introduced to tune its electron donating ability. Furthermore, several fluorenes can be fused to form ladder-type aromatics with extended π-conjugation. Such rigidified coplanar structures can suppress the rotational disorder around interannular single bonds and lower reorganization energy, which in turn enhances the intrinsic charge mobility.38 In addition, copolymers based on a ladder-type donor unit may exhibit good thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities, and a broader, more intense absorption band which is favorable for enhanced solar light harvesting.24Fig. 3 depicts the chemical structures of some typical WBG copolymers based on fluorene, indenofluorene and the related derivatives. The bandgaps, HOMO levels, and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers are listed in Table 2.

9,9-Dialkylfluorene is a popular weak donor unit used in D–A copolymers due to its features of good thermal and chemical stability, high absorption coefficients, and the easy synthetic access.39–41 In 2003, Andersson and co-workers first reported a polymer, P6, based on the fluorene and dithienyl-benzothiadiazole moieties with a bandgap of 1.90 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of −5.70 eV. Although a high VOC of 1.04 V was achieved for the PSC based on P6:PC61BM, a relatively low PCE of 2.2% was observed which was mainly caused by its small JSC of 4.66 mA cm−2 and a low FF of 46%.42 However, through side-chain engineering on the fluorene-based backbone, an optimized copolymer (P7) exhibited an enhanced PCE of 4.5% with an increased JSC of 9.1 mA cm−2 and an enlarged FF of 51%.43
Further optimization on the electron-donating ability and other physical properties of the fluorene unit can be achieved through changing the specific atoms at its 9-position.44,45
For example, Cao and co-workers reported an alternating polymer (P8) by replacing the sp3-hybridized carbon atom in its fluorene unit with a silicon atom. P8 has an optical bandgap of 1.82 eV and a HOMO level of −5.39 eV. Compared to its fluorene counterpart (PFO-DBT), P8 showed a higher hole mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PFO-DBT) in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and a stronger light absorption, which resulted from the better π–π stacking and the less steric hindrance induced by the longer C–Si bond in comparison with the C–C bond in the fluorene. Therefore, a larger PCE of 5.4% with a JSC of 11.9 mA cm−2 was achieved for the P8-based PSCs.44
It has been disclosed that the bulky side chains on the sp3 hybridized carbon of the fluorene unit “stick out” from the fluorene core and hinder the close π–π stacking of the resulting polymers in solid film, which impedes an efficient carrier transport.46,47 Thus, Dai et al. developed a highly crystalline polymer (P9), by using ethylene bridging units to ensure a coplanar configuration between the side chains and the fluorene core.48 This coplanar configuration facilitates a close intermolecular π–π stacking between the polymer chains, leading to an enhanced charge transport in PSCs. P9 possesses an optical bandgap of about 1.84 eV with an elevated HOMO level of −5.31 eV. PSCs based on P9:PC71BM showed a PCE of 5.07% with a JSC of 11.04 mA cm−2, and a VOC of 0.85 V.48
Replacement of the sp3 carbon in the fluorene unit with nitrogen affords carbazole. Compared with fluorene, carbazole is a stronger electron-donating unit due to its electron-rich nitrogen. Therefore, the HOMO energy levels of carbazole-based D–A polymers increase. One of the first D–A copolymers based on carbazole was P10, which has a bandgap of 1.88 eV and a HOMO level of −5.5 eV. Although the initial PCE of PSCs based on P10 is only 3.6%,49 it can be improved to 6% after meticulous device optimizations.50,51
In 2016, our group introduced a new building block, i.e. indenothiophene, to construct D–A copolymers.52a The indenothiophene-based donor unit was first copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) and monofluorinated BT to afford P11 and P12, respectively. The optical bandgaps of both copolymers are around 1.80 eV. Similar to fluorene, the relatively weak electron donating feature of the indenothiophene unit ensured deep-lying HOMO levels (below −5.48 eV) of the two copolymers which are helpful for achieving high VOC values of the resulting PSCs. As expected, without any additive, the P12-based device exhibited an impressive VOC of 0.995 V with a PCE of 6.72%. By introducing diphenyl ether (DPE) as a solvent additive, the PCE increased to 9.14% with a reduced VOC of 0.90 V. Under the same device fabrication conditions, the P11-based device displayed a PCE of 5.92% with a VOC of 0.94 V.52a When the difluorinated BT was used as an acceptor unit, the resulting indenothiophene-based copolymer (P13) exhibited a wider optical bandgap of 1.82 eV with a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.54 eV.52b Through systematic morphology control and device engineering, the best performance solar cell based on P13 showed a high PCE of 9.01% with a large VOC of 1.0 V. The PCE is the highest for single-junction polymer fullerene solar cells with VOC values up to 1.0 V.52b These results demonstrated that indenothiophene is an excellent donor unit for efficient WBG copolymers.
At the same time, ladder-type oligo-p-phenylenes which have an extended π-conjugation in comparison with fluorene were first introduced into D–A copolymers by Zheng et al. in order to increase their light-harvesting properties. The ladder-type oligo-p-phenylene-based D–A copolymers exhibited wide bandgaps around 1.96 eV and deep HOMO levels of about −5.47 eV. Compared to fluorene-based copolymers with the same acceptor unit, these ladder-type oligo-p-phenylene-based copolymers showed enhanced and bathochromically shifted absorption bands and much better solubility in organic solvents. Without extended optimizations, a PCE of 4.5% and a high VOC of 1.04 V were achieved from the P14:PC71BM-based device fabricated under an ambient environment.53 It was found that the alkyl side chains have a negligible influence on the optical and electrochemical properties of these ladder-type oligo-p-phenylene-based polymers, but play an important role in determining their solar cell performance. For example, when the side chains of indenofluorene-based copolymers were changed from the n-octyl group to the branched 2-ethylhexyl group, the copolymer (P20) with better solubility and a higher mobility was obtained, which exhibited a higher PCE of 5.05% in comparison with a PCE of 2.44% for the n-octyl group-based counterpart.54 By replacing the two hexyl groups on the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene backbone of P14 with two methyl groups, our group synthesized an optimized copolymer (P15) which exhibited an increased PCE of 5.39%.55 When two alkoxy groups were introduced into the BT unit of P15, P16 was developed, which exhibited a PCE of 5.73% with a VOC of 1.02 V.55 Furthermore, the incorporation of fluorine atom into the BT unit gave polymer P17 which exhibited a moderate PCE of 4.5% with a high VOC of 1.09 V.55 With the relatively large bandgaps and deep HOMO energy levels, these copolymers are promising short-wavelength absorbing materials for tandem solar cells with high VOC values.
When the central sp3 carbon atom in a ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene unit is replaced with a nitrogen atom, diindenocarbazole (DIC) is formed. By using the DIC and dialkoxy-substituted BT as the donor and the acceptor units, respectively, our group designed and synthesized a D–A copolymer (P18) with a wide bandgap of 2.01 eV, and a deep HOMO level of −5.43 eV. PSCs based on P18 exhibited an attractive PCE of 7.26% with a VOC of 0.93 V, and a JSC of 14.22 mA cm−2.56 After side engineering of the DIC-based copolymers with different alkyl chains or anchoring positions on the donor and acceptor units, it was found that the copolymers with a shorter length of side chains on the DIC unit exhibited a relatively higher hole mobility and better miscibility with PC71BM. As a result, the copolymer with methyl chains on the nitrogen (P19) showed an increased PCE of 7.34% with a VOC of 0.95 V.57
The indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit was first reported by Wong et al. in 2006. Structurally, IDT can be viewed as the replacement of two benzene rings in an indenofluorene unit with two thiophenes. The extended conjugation and coplanarity of IDT make it a good building block for constructing WBG copolymers. Because of the electron-rich nature of the thiophene, the IDT unit exhibits stronger electron-donating characteristics than its benzene analogue (indenofluorene). In order to obtain a similar wide bandgap as the indenofluorene-based counterpart, relatively weak acceptors are required. Using thiazolothiazole as an acceptor unit, Li et al. synthesized an IDT-based WBG polymer, P21, with a bandgap of 1.83 eV and a HOMO level of −5.21 eV. PSCs based on P21:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 5.79% with a VOC of 0.89 V.58 When N-alkyl 2-pyridone dithiophene (DTPO) was used as an electron-deficient unit to copolymerize with the IDT unit, a new copolymer (P23) was synthesized which exhibited a wider bandgap of 2.05 eV with a deeper HOMO level of −5.32 eV in comparison with P21. Therefore, PSCs based on P23:PC71BM delivered an increased PCE of 7.33% with an enlarged VOC of 0.97 V, compared to devices based on P21:PC71BM.59
Several IDT analogues have also been developed and used for constructing WBG D–A copolymers with PCEs of around 6%. Jen et al. synthesized a new copolymer (P22) by extending the IDT with two fused thienyl units (IDTT). With a similar wide bandgap of 2.0 eV and a HOMO level of −5.24 eV, P22 was demonstrated to deliver a PCE of 5.90% with a VOC of 0.90 V.60 The replacement of the central benzene in IDT with naphthalene affords dithienonaphthalene (DTN). Similar to most fused aromatics, DTN contains two isomers, including linear- and angular-shaped DTN. By using linear- or angular-shaped DTN as a donor unit, and a substituted BT as an acceptor unit, two copolymers (P24 and P25) were synthesized in our group.61 It is found that the angular-shaped DTN-based copolymer (P25) exhibited a deeper HOMO level, a wider optical bandgap, and a higher hole mobility in comparison with its linear-shaped DTN-based counterpart (P24).61a As a result, P25:PC71BM-based solar cells exhibited a higher PCE of 6.44% with a larger VOC of 0.92 V in comparison with the P24-based devices (PCE = 4.78%, VOC = 0.86 V).61b These results indicated that the curvature of the polymer backbone has large impacts on HOMO levels, optical bandgaps, and hole mobilities as well as photovoltaic properties of the semiconducting polymers.
2.3. D–A type copolymers based on benzodithiophene and its derivatives
As discussed in Section 2.1, BDT and its derivatives are one of the most widely used building blocks for construction of high performance D–A copolymers, especially LBG copolymers. For achieving high efficiency BDT-based WBG D–A copolymers, the selection of acceptor units with appropriate electron-withdrawing ability is critically important. In this section, we mainly focus on summarizing and discussing the recent developments in BDT-based D–A copolymers exhibiting optical bandgaps greater than 1.80 eV. The chemical structures of the WBG D–A copolymers based on BDT and its derivatives are shown in Fig. 4 and their bandgaps, HOMO levels, and photovoltaic properties are listed in Table 3.

2-Alkyl-benzotriazole (BTA) has a low electron affinity and a high-lying LUMO level because the lone-pair electron on the nitrogen atom at the 2-position is highly prone to be donated to the triazole ring.62 As a result, conjugated polymers using BDT as a donor unit and BTA or its derivative as an acceptor unit usually exhibit wide bandgaps. By the copolymerization between the dialkyl-substituted BDT and the fluorinated BTA, You et al. synthesized a new copolymer (P26) exhibiting a wide optical bandgap of 2.0 eV, and a HOMO level of −5.36 eV. The P26:PC61BM-based device exhibited a PCE of 7.1% with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 11.83 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.9%. The outstanding FF and JSC of P26-based devices are attributed to the high hole mobility of 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.62 Material optimizations were further explored by varying the substituents on both the BDT and BTA units. As mentioned above, the incorporation of alkylthio side chains on the BDT unit has been used to effectively down-shift the HOMO energy levels of the resulting copolymers and thereby increasing VOC values of the related PSCs. Peng et al. reported a D–A copolymer (P27) consisting of a dialkylthiol-substituted BDT and a monofluorinated BTA with an optical bandgap of 1.81 eV and a HOMO level of −5.32 eV. The single junction devices based on P27:PC71BM generated a PCE of 7.7% and the tandem devices using P27 as a short wavelength absorbing material exhibited a high PCE of 9.4%.19 Wang et al. introduced octylthio-substituted thiophene into BDT and synthesized P29. Compared to the corresponding polymer with octyl side chains on the thiophene moieties (P28), P29 exhibited a similar optical bandgap of 1.90 eV, but a deeper HOMO level of −5.73 eV (−5.50 eV for P28). Moreover, the SCLC hole mobility of the P29 blend (1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of the P28 blend (8.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As a result, the best performance PSC based on P29 showed a high PCE of 8.3% with a VOC of 0.83 V, outperforming the P28-based devices (PCE = 5.1%, VOC = 0.71 V).65
Inspired by the success of the fluorinated BTA unit, several other BTA derivatives have been explored and used for constructing WBG polymers based on BDT. For example, Huang et al. synthesized an electron-deficient moiety, naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis(2-octyl-[1,2,3]triazole (TZNT), by fusing two BTA units in an angular shape. When the TZNT was copolymerized with an alkylthienyl-substituted BDT unit, a wide bandgap polymer (P30) was obtained which showed a bandgap of 1.93 eV with a HOMO level of −5.23 eV. The PSC based on P30:PC71BM delivered a PCE of 7.11%, with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 11.71 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65%.66 By replacing the remaining two hydrogen atoms on the BTA unit with cyclic imide, the same group reported an acceptor unit based on cyclic-imide substituted BTA. Similarly, the introduction of the cyclic-imide group reduces the HOMO levels of the resulting copolymers. When copolymerized with 2-ethylhexylthienyl-substituted BDT, P31 was obtained with a bandgap of 1.81 eV and a HOMO level of −5.34 eV. The best performance PSC based on P31 showed a PCE of 8.63%, with a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 13.50 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 74%.67 You et al. developed a BTA derivative based on cyano substituted pyridine-fused triazole (m-PyCNTAZ). When the m-PyCNTAZ was copolymerized with the dialkyl-substituted BDT unit, P32 was obtained which exhibited a high PCE of 8.4% with a large VOC of ∼1 V.68
Recently, benzodithiophenedione (BDD) was frequently used for constructing high performance WBG polymers due to its good planarity, relatively weak electron accepting ability and easy availability. Moreover, BDD-based copolymers usually exhibit strong π–π stacking interactions and thus provide highly ordered crystalline structures in the solid state, which is beneficial for charge transport.69 Through the copolymerization between the BDD and the 2-alkylthiophene-substituted BDT, Hou et al. developed a new copolymer (P33) with a bandgap of 1.83 eV. The optimized PSC based on P33:PC61BM exhibited a PCE of 6.67% with a VOC of 0.86 V.69 In particular, a high PCE of 11.21% with excellent thermal stability was obtained when P33 was used as a donor and ITIC was used as an acceptor in the non-fullerene PSC.21a By replacing 2-ethylhexylthienyl in P33 with 2-ethylhexylthiothienyl, a new polymer, P34, was developed. This slight change in the chemical structure effectively increases the extinction coefficient of the copolymer while leaving its HOMO energy level and optical bandgap almost unaffected. As a result, the JSC and PCE of the corresponding PSCs increased from 10.55 mA cm−2 and 6.57% (for P33) to 13.13 mA cm−2 and 8.09% (for P34), respectively.70a More detailed studies on the influence of alkyl chains on the properties of P34 were carried out by Sun et al.21m They found that the longest alkyl substituents on the BDD unit can cause large steric hindrance and lead to a twisted molecular geometry. Consequently, P35 having 2-ethylhexylthiothienyl groups on BDT and 2-butyloctyl groups on BDD gave the best photovoltaic performance. In combination with PC71BM, P35-based PSCs showed an impressive PCE of 10.3%. Furthermore, an improved PCE of 10.6% was achieved when it was paired with a non-fullerene acceptor.70b These results demonstrate that P35 is a good WBG material for OSCs. By inserting fluorine atoms into P33, Zhang et al. developed a new polymer (P36) with high crystallinity. In comparison to the non-fluorinated polymer (P33), P36 showed a similar bandgap of 1.80 eV but a deeper HOMO level of −5.45 eV, which is beneficial for achieving a high VOC. As a result, P36:PC71BM-based PSCs exhibited an increased VOC of 0.98 V with a PCE of 9.2%.71 In addition, several building blocks derived from the BDT unit were also developed and copolymerized with the BDD unit to construct high performance WBG polymers. Sun et al. developed a P33 analogue polymer (P37) by replacing the BDT unit with π-extended dithienobenzodithiophene. P37 has an optical bandgap of 1.85 eV with a deep HOMO level of −5.36 eV and a high hole mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs. The champion device based on P37 exhibited a high PCE of 9.74%, with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 14.11 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75%. This high efficiency is attributed to efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection in devices.22e When the 2-ethylhexylthienyl-substituted BDT unit in P33 was changed to the 2-ethylhexylphenyl-substituted benzodifuran unit, the same group developed a novel copolymer, P38, with a similar bandgap of 1.83 eV, a HOMO level of −5.43 eV, and a hole mobility of 0.014 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs. PSCs based on P38 showed a high PCE of 9.43% with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 13.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.4%.72
With its symmetric and coplanar structure, thieno[3.4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) has been intensively explored for high performance copolymers with a strong intra/inter-molecular interaction and a low-lying HOMO level.73 Leclerc et al. firstly developed a BDT-TPD-based copolymer (P39) with a bandgap of 1.81 eV and a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.56 eV. The P39-based PSC exhibited an initial PCE of 5.5% with a VOC of 0.85 V.74 To further improve the photovoltaic performance of P39, the side chains on the BDT and TPD units have been carefully optimized. Beaujuge et al. found that the BDT-TPD-based copolymer with branched 2-ethylhexyl on BDT and linear alkyl chain on TPD adopts a preferential face-on orientation relative to the substrate, which benefits the charge transport. Fine tuning the linear alkyl chain length on the TPD unit gave a PCE of 8.5% in the optimized P40:PC71BM-based PSC.75 Ma et al. reported a copolymer (P41) composed of BDT with alkylthienyl side chains and TPD with an n-octyl side chain. P41 has a wide bandgap of 1.85 eV and a deep HOMO level of −5.61 eV. PSCs based on P41 exhibited a PCE of 6.17% with a high VOC of 1.0 V.76 The VOC of P41-based devices was much higher than that of P39-based PSCs. Replacement of alkoxy with alkylthienyl on the BDT led to deeper lying HOMO energy levels and higher VOC values in the resulting PSCs. Additionally, several WBG copolymers based on TPD and BDT derivatives were reported. Beaujuge et al. synthesized a WBG polymer (P42) by replacing the BDT unit in P39 with a benzodifuran (BDF) motif. In their study, P42 showed a wider bandgap of 1.97 eV compared to P39. Moreover, the HOMO level of P42 was 0.12 eV lower than that of P39. BHJ solar cells fabricated with P42 showed a PCE of 7.4% with a high VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 11.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68%.77 Zhu et al. reported a copolymer, P43, based on alkylthienyl-substituted naphthodithiophene and TPD inserted with alkyl substituted thiophene as π-bridges. P43 has a bandgap of 1.94 eV and a HOMO level of −5.55 eV, and the resulting P43-based PSCs showed a PCE of 7.5%, with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 12.73 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68%.78
In addition to BTA, BDD and TPD units, there are many other acceptor units, such as angular-shape naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NTDI),22,79 pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione (DPPD),80,81 thiazole derivatives,82,83 dialkoxy-functionalized benzothidiazole (BTO),84 dithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTPO)85,86etc., that were used to construct the BDT-based WBG copolymers. PSCs based on these copolymers showed relatively high PCEs in the range of 5–8%. These results indicate that BDT and its analogues are versatile and useful building blocks for the design of high-performance WBG polymers.
2.4. D–A type copolymers based on oligothiophene
As effective building blocks for high-mobility semiconducting polymers, oligothiophenes are attractive for application in PSCs. Oligothiophenes typically have a high degree of conjugation due to the small thiophene resonance energy, which would enhance light absorption when copolymerized with appropriate acceptor units. The chemical structures of the oligothiophene-containing WBG polymers are shown in Fig. 5, and their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 4. Note that the high mobilities of oligothiophene-containing copolymers may suppress charge recombination and thus enhance the FF and JSC, which makes them ideal candidates for thick film BHJ solar cells. For example, Osaka et al. developed a series of thiazolothiazole–bithiophene-based copolymers with different side chain compositions. These copolymers have wide bandgaps of about 1.80 eV and HOMO levels of around −5.20 eV. Among them, P44 exhibited a well-ordered face-on orientation, which is beneficial for hole transportation in the vertical direction. Thus, the P44-based PSCs with a thick active layer (330 nm) afforded a maximum PCE of 7.5% with a FF of 65%, and moreover they showed a PCE approaching 6% with thick layers up to 1 μm.87 Guo et al. synthesized two semicrystalline copolymers (P45 and P46) by copolymerization between terthiophene and TPD or 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI). The two copolymers have optical bandgaps of around 1.81 eV, with low-lying HOMO levels of about −5.55 eV. Both polymers exhibited a high hole mobility of about 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in SCLC devices which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in the vertical direction for PSCs. Therefore, BHJ solar cells using these polymers as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor showed PCEs of 7.9–8.7% with remarkably high FFs of 76–80%. Impressively, a FF of >70% can be also obtained from PSCs based on P45 with the active layer thickness up to 300 nm.88 The high FFs of P45 and P46-based solar cells were mainly attributed to highly ordered, face-on oriented microstructures with close π–π interplane spacings, ordered BHJ bicontinuous networks, and vertical phase gradation.88 Recently, Yan et al. reported a WBG copolymer (P47) based on quarterthiophene and fluorinated BTA. P47 has a bandgap of 1.88 eV and a HOMO level of −5.43 eV. Moreover, P47 exhibited strong interchain aggregation in solution and intense π–π stacking in the solid film, resulting in a high SCLC hole mobility of 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs based on P47:PC71BM (active layer thickness = 250 nm) exhibited a maximum PCE of 7.8% with a VOC = 0.82 V, a JSC = 13.6 mA cm−2, and a FF = 71%.89

Ding et al. first synthesized a pentacyclic aromatic bislactam, thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]-isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione (TPTI), as an electron acceptor for D–A copolymers. The polymer based on TPTI (P48) has an optical bandgap of 1.86 eV and a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.42 eV. PSCs based on P48:PC71BM showed outstanding PCEs up to 7.80%, with a VOC of 0.87 V.90 The PCE of the best performance PSC based on P48:PC71BM increased to 9.20% after device optimizations.91 Replacing the central benzene of the TPTI unit in P48 with bithiophene afforded a novel copolymer, P49, which has a similar bandgap but a deeper HOMO level of −5.52 eV in comparison with P48. As a result, P49:PC71BM-based solar cells delivered a decent PCE of 9.13% with an increased VOC of 0.96 V.92
Kroon et al. developed a tetracyclic lactam unit and synthesized a new polymer, P50, which has a wide bandgap of 2.20 eV with a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.94 eV. Film microstructure studies revealed that P50 is semicrystalline and predominantly ordered face-on in thin film, which persists upon blending with fullerenes. As a result, a decent PCE of 5% with a VOC of 0.90 V was achieved for the PSCs based on P50:PC71BM with >200 nm thick active layers.93 It should be mentioned that the deep-lying HOMO energy level of P50 did not lead to a high VOC of the resulting PSC which may be related to its deep-lying LUMO energy level.
WBG polymers can also be achieved by copolymerization with two different donor moieties. For example, Beaujuge et al. developed a WBG polymer (Eg = 2.1 eV), P51, composed of benzodithiophene (BDT) and 3,4-difluorothiophene motifs. In their work, the HOMO level of P51 (−5.29 eV) was lower than that of P3HT (−4.65 eV). PSCs based on P51 achieved a PCE of 7.0% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 10.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72%.94a Recently, Jung et al. synthesized a donor–donor type alternating copolymer, P52, that employed IDTT and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in the polymer backbone. P52 has an optical bandgap of 2.14 eV and a HOMO level of −5.35 eV. A high PCE of 7.1% was achieved for the P52:PC71BM device with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 11.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66%.94b
Some acene compounds, such as naphthalene and anthracene, have also been used as donor units for constructing WBG polymers.95 Owing to their weak electron-donating properties, acene-based polymers usually possess deep HOMO energy levels, which is favorable for high VOC values in PSCs. Moreover, the planar and rigid characteristics of acene units render the related copolymers with high charge transporting properties.95a Our group synthesized a naphthalene-based copolymer (P53) from naphthalene with two 2-decyltetradecyloxy chains and hexyloxy-substituted BT. P53 possesses a HOMO level as low as −5.44 eV and a bandgap of 1.86 eV. PSCs based on P53:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 6.24% with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 10.76 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62%, which indicated that dialkoxynaphthalene is an excellent weak donor for constructing high performance WBG polymers.96 More recently, Jo et al. synthesized a WBG polymer, P54, comprising 9,10-thienylanthracene and difluorinated BT, which has an optical bandgap of 1.91 eV and a HOMO level of −5.55 eV. As a consequence, BHJ PSCs fabricated from P54:PC71BM blend delivered a respectable PCE value of 8.05% along with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 12.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65%.97
3. Conclusions and outlook
In order to increase the JSC and VOC of PSCs simultaneously, three main solar cell device structures have been developed in the past few years which are tandem PSCs, ternary blend PSCs and non-fullerene PSCs. In all the three device structures, WBG semiconducting polymers play a key role in determining the highest achievable JSC and VOC values as well as the final PCE of PSCs. Therefore, increasing efforts have been made in the design and synthesis of WBG polymers though many efforts were focused on LBG polymers in the past decade. So far, the best PCE of single-junction PSCs with WBG polymer donors is over 10%. In this review, we summarized the recent progresses in high performance WBG polymers in order to provide useful strategies in designing materials for PSCs.
WBG conjugated polymers have the disadvantage of poor light absorption in the near-IR region where most of the solar flux is located. Therefore, fullerene-based BHJ solar cells made from these WBG copolymers usually showed a lower JSC value compared to those based on LBG polymers. To overcome this problem, it is critical to improve the light-absorption coefficient and increase exciton separation efficiency as well as enhance charge transport and collection. From the view of materials design, several promising guidelines can be considered: (1) forced planarization by covalently fastening adjacent aromatic and heteroaromatic rings to enhance the electron delocalization and inter-chain π–π interactions; (2) utilizing noncovalent coulombic interactions to increase the planarity and ordering of polymer chains, such as intramolecular O⋯S, F⋯S, and CH⋯N interactions; (3) fine-tuning the side-chain structure and position to offer good solubility without causing serious steric hindrance; (4) proper incorporation of π-bridge units to obtain a straight and planar backbone conformation. In addition, morphology control and interface engineering are also crucial for achieving a high JSC value because effective exciton separation and charge-carrier transport need a bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology with optimal phase separation scales, while efficient charge collection requires an ohmic contact between the active layer and metal electrodes.
With a large number of high performance non-fullerene acceptors developed in the past few years, WBG polymers will receive increasing attention because the absorption bands of most high performance non-fullerene acceptors are located in the long-wavelength region. For non-fullerene solar cells based on WBG polymers, the light-harvesting ability of the active layer in the long-wavelength region can be compensated for by using non-fullerene acceptors. One successful example is the ITIC acceptor reported by Zhan et al., whose main absorption band is in the range of 600–780 nm.98 The strong absorption of ITIC effectively complements the main absorption of WBG polymers (300–690 nm), thereby leading to an appreciable increase in the JSC and PCE of the related solar cells when compared with those of fullerene-based counterparts. It should be mentioned that unlike fullerene derivatives, the bandgaps and energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors can be easily tuned by a wider range through chemical modifications. If the absorption bands of non-fullerene acceptors can be extended to 1000 nm, the JSC of the resulting PSCs will further increase provided that there is a suitable WBG polymer whose bandgap and energy levels match well with those of non-fullerene acceptors. Taking into account the fact that utilizing the multiple-junction and ternary blend strategies in the device structure can further improve the performance of PSCs, we believe that a PCE of 15% and beyond is achievable for PSCs in the near future.
