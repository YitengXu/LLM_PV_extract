The dye-sensitized solar cells assembled with a CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE achieved excellent values of open-circuit voltage (0.743 V), short-circuit current density (17.276 mA cm−2), fill factor (0.670) and a wonderful power conversion efficiency (8.60%), which is higher than that of DSSCs with a Co9S8 CE (7.69%) or a Pt CE (8.13%) under the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G).
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are clean, low-cost and easily-fabricated equipment to convert solar energy into electricity.1–3 Today many researchers try their best to explore cheap and highly efficient materials to fabricate DSSCs. In general, a DSSC includes three parts: a dye-sensitized photoanode (typically, TiO2), an electrolyte (typically, I3−/I−), and a counter electrode (CE). The role of CEs is to collect the electrons from the photoanode by the external circuit and catalyse the reaction for the reduction of I3−/I−.3 Platinum metal is one of the most commonly used materials for CEs, while the characteristics of exorbitant price and low corrosion resistance limit its application.4 Nowadays many other materials are candidate materials for the fabrication of the CEs of DSSCs, such as carbon materials,5–7 conducting polymers,8–10 alloys,11,12 metal-oxide,13 -nitride,14 -sulfide,15,16 -selenide,17,18 -phosphide19 and hybrid materials.20–22
Cobalt sulfide is one kind of transition metal sulfide catalytic material and it includes a variety of binary sulfides, such as CoS, CoS2, Co3S4 Co9S8 and so on.23 Among these cobalt sulfides, Co9S8 has attracted intense interest because of its complicated structure and interesting properties. Hence, Co9S8 was widely employed in hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization,24 as a cathodic material for lithium batteries,25,26 supercapacitors27,28 and in other fields.29 Based on its good catalytic activity, some researchers synthesized Co9S8 to be the CE material of DSSCs. In 2013, Chang et al.30 prepared a Co9S8 nanocrystal ink by spray-deposition and the large area DSSCs with this Co9S8 CE obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.02 ± 0.18%, which was similar to that of a DSSC with a Pt CE (7.2 ± 0.12%). Chen et al.31 fabricated a novel one-dimensional Co9S8 acicular nanotube array (ANTA) on a conducting plastic substrate by a two-step approach. With this Co9S8 ANTA as the CE, the DSSCs achieved a PCE of 5.47%, which was comparable to that of the DSSC using sputtered Pt (5.62%). In addition, CoMoO4 has attracted researchers’ attention due to its advantages of low cost, being non-toxic, and exhibiting enhanced electrochemical properties on lithium batteries32 and supercapacitors.33,34
In this paper, CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes were synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. In the first step, Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanoneedles were fabricated and used as the templates for fabricating CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes.35 The as-obtained hybrids could take advantage of the favorable property of CoMoO4 and Co9S8. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel tests proved that the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CEs possessed good conductivity and catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−/I−. With CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes as CEs, the DSSCs had a high current density (17.276 mA cm−2) and an excellent PCE of 8.60%, which was higher than that of DSSCs with a Pt CE (8.13%).
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and materials
Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, ≥99%), urea (≥99.0%), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, ≥98%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, ≥99.7%), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 99.9%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%), tetraethyl ammonium iodide (98%), tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (99%), tetramethyl ammonium iodide (99%), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP, 96%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, 99.9%), sodium iodide (NaI, >99%), potassium iodide (KI, 99%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.5%), and iodine (I2, 99%) were all A. R. grade and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. Ammonium molybdate ((NH4)2MoO4, 99.99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate) was acquired from Dye sol.
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (14 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Wuhan Lattice Solar Energy Technology Co. Ltd, China. The FTO glass was cut into pieces (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) and washed with cleaner, acetone and IPA in turn and stored in anhydrous ethanol.
2.2. Synthesis of CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes
The CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes were fabricated by the same two-step hydrothermal method as Co9S8 (Scheme 1). First, in order to prepare a precursor of Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods with CoCl2·6H2O and urea, 10 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O and 10 mmol of urea were added into 60 mL deionized water under intense stirring. Then the solution was stirred for 10 minutes and transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated in an oven at 130 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, the underlying precipitation was washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol three times respectively and dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h and the precursor powder was obtained.

Followed by a hydrothermal process with (NH4)2MoO4 and Na2S·9H2O, the precursor was transformed into CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes. In brief, 400 mg of precursor, 1.2 g of Na2S·9H2O and (NH4)2MoO4 (60 wt%) were mixed with 60 mL deionized water under intense stirring for 10 minutes. Then the solution was stirred for 10 minutes and transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated in an oven at 180 °C for 8 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, the as-prepared CoMoO4/Co9S8 nanotubes were washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. For comparison, the pure Co9S8 was synthesized by the same method without the addition of (NH4)2MoO4. The effect of different contents (20, 40, 60, 80 wt%) of (NH4)2MoO4 on the performance of CEs was studied and the relevant CoMoO4/Co9S8 nanotubes were marked CoMoO4/Co9S8-x (x = the content of (NH4)2MoO4, x wt%).
2.3. Preparation of CoMoO4/Co9S8 counter electrodes
The CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE was prepared by a spin-casting method. Typically, 100 mg of the as-prepared CoMoO4/Co9S8 was added into 10 mL IPA and sonicated for 20 min. Then the solution was coated onto FTO glass by spin-casting three times at a rate of 4000 rpm for 20 seconds. After each time of spin-casting, the FTO substrate was thermally treated at 80 °C for 10 min and then the next layer was coated. The Co9S8 CE was fabricated with the same method.
2.4. Fabrication of DSSCs
The TiO2 photoanodes consisted of a ∼160 nm TiO2 under-layer, a 12 μm TiO2 nanocrystalline layer and a scattering layer treated with TiCl4 solution. After sensitization with a 0.3 mM N719 dye ethanol solution for 24 h, the TiO2 photoanodes absorbed N719 dye were fabricated. In addition, the active areas of the photoanodes were about 0.3 × 0.4 cm2. A DSSC was a sandwich structure assembled by attaching a dye sensitized TiO2 photoanode to a CE with a I3−/I− electrolyte between them. It was then employed in photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) tests. In a DSSC, cyanoacrylate adhesive was used to adhere these two electrodes together and a vacuum pump was used to inject electrolytes into the cell internal space. The I3−/I− electrolyte was prepared by adding tetraethyl ammonium iodide (0.1 M), tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (0.1 M), tetramethyl ammonium iodide (0.1 M), NaI (0.1 M), KI (0.1 M), LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.05 M), and tBP (0.5 M) into an ACN solution. A Pt CE (2.5 × 2 cm2, prepared by magnetron sputtering, Wuhan Lattice Solar Energy Technology Co. Ltd, China) was used as a comparison. A traditional symmetrical cell (CE/electrolyte/CE) was assembled with two identical CEs and was used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel tests.
2.5. Characterizations and measurements
The crystal structures of Co9S8 and CoMoO4/Co9S8 were obtained by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The composition of CoMoO4/Co9S8 was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo). XPS was performed by using Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) with a power of 150 W and a beam spot of 500 μm. The XPS data were calibrated by C 1s (284.8 eV) and fitted by the XPSPEAK 4.0 software. The surface morphologies of the as-prepared products were measured using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU8010, HITACHI), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to investigate the element distribution and element types of CoMoO4/Co9S8-60.
The electrochemical properties of the CEs were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), EIS and Tafel tests with an electrochemical working station (IM6, Zahner, Germany). CV tests were used to study the electrocatalytic ability of the CEs for I3−/I− by a three-electrode cell, in which an as-prepared CE was used as a working electrode, a Pt sheet was used as a CE and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Meanwhile the tests were performed in an ACN solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 100 mM LiClO4 from −0.4 V to 1.4 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. EIS measurements were conducted in dark conditions and the frequency range was from 100 kHz to 100 mHz under a bias voltage of 0 V and the corresponding amplitude of 5 mV. ZsimpWin software was used to fit the EIS data. Tafel curves were recorded at a voltage range from 1 V to 1 V and at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.
J–V tests of the DSSCs were performed under simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) with a solar simulator (PVIV-94043A, Newport, USA) and a 450 W xenon lamp as the light source. All the tests were performed five times and an average of the data was taken.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and compositions of the CEs
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Co9S8, CoMoO4 and CoMoO4/Co9S8-60. The as-prepared CoMoO4 in the absence of Na2S has obvious diffraction peaks, which were assigned to the planes of CoMoO4 (JCPDS 021-0868). Meanwhile, the Co9S8 and CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 both have the same diffraction peaks as the planes of Co9S8 (JCPDS 65-1765). Meanwhile, there are some other small peaks that could be detected in the XRD pattern of CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 and they can be well indexed to CoMoO4. This indicted that the resulting product was a hybrid material of CoMoO4 and Co9S8, which was prepared with 60 wt% (NH4)2MoO4 in the second hydrothermal process.

To further research the chemical compositions and the element valence of the CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE, XPS was employed in the study and the data are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the survey scan of the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE, which illustrated the presence of Co, O, Mo and S. Fig. 2b is the high resolution scan of the Mo 3d peak and there is one characteristic doublet of hexavalent molybdenum of Mo 3d at 235.9 and 232.8 eV, which correspond to Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 orbitals, respectively.36 Fig. 2c shows the high resolution scan of the Co 2p3/2 region and there are two obvious peaks at 780.4 eV and 778.4 eV that belong to Co2+ and Co9S8.34,37 Fig. 2d shows the core level spectra of S 2p and there are two characteristic doublets of Co9S8 at 161.4 and 162.5 eV which correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.37

Fig. 3 shows the FESEM and EDX images of the surface morphology of the as-prepared materials. Fig. 3a shows the surface morphology of precursor (Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O), which consists of many nanorods (∼200 nm in diameter, and lengths of several micrometers). After a hydrothermal process of precursor and Na2S·9H2O, the as-prepared product of Co9S8 was transformed into nanotubes with smooth surface (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile the addition of (NH4)2MoO4 in the second hydrothermal process could change the surface morphology of CoMoO4/Co9S8. The CoMoO4/Co9S8-40 hybrid consisted of some nanotubes and some sheets (Fig. 3c). With the increase of (NH4)2MoO4 content to 60 wt%, the length of the Co9S8 nanotubes was increased and the surface was rougher with the CoMoO4 nanosheets (Fig. 3d), and this rough surface topography was beneficial to improving the contact of the CE and the electrolyte and the catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I−. When the (NH4)2MoO4 content was 80 wt%, the length of the nanotubes of CoMoO4/Co9S8-80 were shortened and there were many lumps (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, the CoMoO4/Co9S8-90 hybrid was fabricated with layered materials which aggregated and some nanotubes were attached onto their surface (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3g shows the element mapping of CoMoO4/Co9S8-60, in which Co and S were uniformly distributed in the nanotubes and Mo was distributed in the sheets of the nanotubes’ surface. Fig. 3h shows the EDX spectroscopy results confirming that the composite of CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 consisted of four elements (Co, Mo, O, S).

The formation mechanism of the Co9S8 nanotubes can be illustrated by the Kirkendall effect.37,38 In the first hydrothermal process, urea could hydrolyze to yield OH− and CO32− in the solution, and the OH−, CO32− and Cl− reacted with Co2+ to form a Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 precipitate (eqn (1)–(4)).39 
H2NCONH2 + H2O → 2NH3 + CO2
(1) 
NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−
(2) 
CO2 + H2O → CO32− + 2H−
(3) 
Co2+ + 0.35CO32− + 0.20Cl− + 1.10OH− → Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10
(4)
In the second step, the as-prepared Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 reacted with Na2S and (NH4)2MoO4 to fabricate Co9S8 nanotubes and CoMoO4 nanosheets on their surface. Firstly, on the surfaces of the nanorods, S2− ions and Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanorods reacted to form a thin layer of Co9S8 nanocrystallites, which contain many grain boundaries to the benefit of the diffusion and reaction of materials through the Co9S8 layer. According to the Kirkendall effect, the different diffusivities of the different components finally lead to the formation of tubular structures. Meanwhile, the hydrolyzation of (NH4)2MoO4 can be expressed as in eqn (5), and the MoO42− ions would react with Co(CO)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 to fabricate CoMoO4 on the surface of the Co9S8 nanotubes.

3.2. Electrochemical properties of the CEs
In order to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CEs and have a comparison with a Pt CE, CV, EIS and Tafel measurements were employed. Fig. S1† shows the effect of (NH4)2MoO4 on the CV of the CEs. The over potentials (ΔE) and the cathodic current density (JRed-1) are shown by the left hand peaks and the absolute values are recorded in Table S1.† The values of ΔE and JRed-1 are two important factors needed for the investigation of the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs for I3−/I−. Smaller ΔE values and higher values of JRed-1 indicate that the CEs had an excellent electrocatalytic activity. The similar shapes of the CV curves indicated that these CEs have similar electrocatalytic activity. With the increasing (NH4)2MoO4 content, the electrocatalytic activity was improved. When the (NH4)2MoO4 content increased to 60 wt%, the value of ΔE was the smallest and the value of JRed-1 was the highest. However, with further increase in the (NH4)2MoO4 content, the value of ΔE was increased and the value of JRed-1 was decreased. The reason may be that the number of CoMoO4 sheets was increased and had an aggregation with a higher content of (NH4)2MoO4 in the second hydrothermal process. This greatly prevents the contact of the CE and the electrolyte and limits the electronic transmission from the CEs to the electrolyte. Hence, the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs was decreased. Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the CoMoO4, Co9S8, CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 and Pt CEs. Though the shapes of the CV curves are similar, the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE has a larger JRed-1 and a smaller ΔE than that of the pure Co9S8 CE. Compared to the Pt CE, the CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE has a smaller value of Epp (0.402 V) and a numerical equivalent JRed-1 (0.931 mA cm−2) (Table 1). The result showed fully that the introduction of CoMoO4 to a Co9S8 CE could increase the electrocatalytic activity of the CE, which was comparable to that of a Pt CE.

Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells with Co9S8, CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 and Pt CEs. The inset is the equivalent circuit and the relevant values are summarized in Table 1. There are two semicircles and the high-frequency intercept of the left semicircle on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle is related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which reflects the catalytic activity of different CEs on the reduction of I3− to I−. Fig. S2† shows the EIS results of the symmetric cells with CEs prepared with different (NH4)2MoO4 contents and the values of Rs and Rct were recorded in Table S1.† Among these CEs, the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE with 60 wt% (NH4)2MoO4 exhibited the smallest values of Rs and Rct which indicated that this CE has excellent conductivity and electrocatalytic properties. In Fig. 5, the Rs of the symmetric cell with CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CEs is smaller than that of the cell with Co9S8 CEs, which is caused by the introduction of CoMoO4 to Co9S8 and the stronger adhesion of CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 on the FTO. Meanwhile, the value of Rct for the symmetric cells with CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CEs is 2.29 Ω cm2, which is smaller than that of cells with Co9S8 CEs (9.52 Ω cm2) and Pt CEs (5.21 Ω cm2). It can be observed that this result is in agreement with the data of the CV measurements. The small Rs and Rct made the DSSCs with a CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE have high Jsc and FF values.
 Fig. 5  EIS curves of Co9S8, CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 and Pt CEs and the insert is the equivalent circuit diagram. 
Tafel polarization was used to further elucidate the catalytic activity of the CEs, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S3.† The Tafel curves described the relationship between overpotential and current density and give information about the exchange current density (J0), which is the slope in the anodic or cathodic branch. A larger value of J0 means that the CE has a better electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−/I−. Fig. S3† shows the Tafel curves of the symmetric cells with CEs prepared with different (NH4)2MoO4 contents. Among these CEs, the CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE exhibited the largest value of J0, which indicated that this CE has excellent electrocatalytic properties. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the value of J0 for CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE is larger than that of the Co9S8 CE and is similar to that of the Pt CE. This means that the CoMoO4/Co9S8-60 CE has the highest electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−/I− among these three CEs. In addition, the J0 has a close positive correlation with Rct as demonstrated by eqn (6), in which R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, n is the electron number involved in the reaction and F is the Faraday constant. Hence the result of the Tafel tests is consistent with the EIS result.

Compared to Co9S8 and Pt CEs, the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE made the photovoltaic property of DSSCs were improved: Voc = 0.743 V, Jsc = 17.276 mA cm−2, FF = 0.670 and PCE = 8.60%. Fig. S4† shows the J–V curves of the CEs with different (NH4)2MoO4 contents and the relevant parameters were recorded in Table S2.† The values of Voc for these CEs were similar, and the results of Jsc, FF and PCE agree with the results of the CV, EIS and Tafel tests.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this paper described the preparation of CoMoO4/Co9S8 hybrid nanotubes by a simple two-step hydrothermal method. This material was coated onto FTO glass to fabricate a CE by spin-casting. The addition of (NH4)2MoO4 in the second hydrothermal process made the surface of the Co9S8 nanotubes rougher in order to have good contact between the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE and the electrolyte, improving the electrochemical property of the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE. The CV results indicated that the electrocatalytic activity of the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE was similar to that of the Pt CE when the (NH4)2MoO4 content was 60 wt%. Meanwhile the EIS and Tafel measurements demonstrated that the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE had smaller values of Rs and Rct than the Pt CE. The DSSCs assembled with the CoMoO4/Co9S8 CE exhibited excellent photovoltaic properties with Jsc = 17.276 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 8.60%, which were higher than that of DSSCs with the Pt CE (Jsc = 16.504 mA cm−2, PCE = 8.13%). This work used a simple approach to prepare a low-cost hybrid material with good electrochemical properties to fabricate a non-Pt CE for DSSCs.
