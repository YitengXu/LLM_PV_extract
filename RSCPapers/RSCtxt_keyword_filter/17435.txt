    , Accepted 8th December 2013First published on 12th December 2013Abstract2,2,3,3,4,4,4-Heptafluoro-N-phenyl-butyr-amide (F-ADD) was synthesized and shown to induce a composition gradient in a blend of P3HT and PC60BM. The addition of small amounts (ca. 0.5 wt%) of F-ADD modulated the chemical distribution in the blend along the vertical direction by controlling the blend component interface energy through selective interactions between F-ADD and PC60BM. A homogeneous compositional distribution along the vertical direction in the nanostructured bulk heterojunction (BHJ) increased the interfacial area, which shortened the exciton path length to the donor–acceptor interface and improved the photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) present one of the most promising options for alternative energy sources.1–3 Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on donor–acceptor types continue to be of interest as promising candidates of low-cost renewable energy that convert sunlight into electricity due to their possibility for solution processing and high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing.4,5 BHJs consist of a blend of an electron donor (D, e.g., a photoactive polymer) and an electron acceptor (A, e.g., PC60BM or its derivatives). Electricity is generated in a device via four consecutive steps: the generation of excitons by an active polymer that absorbs light, the diffusion of excitons toward PC60BM units, the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers (holes and electrons), and the transport of free charge carriers to their respective electrodes.6 A high interfacial area in a BHJ is important for reducing the exciton pathway length (less than 10 nm) required to reach the interface between the donor and acceptor domains.6,7 A high interfacial area can enhance the generation of photo-induced electrons in a PSC. Vertically aligned charge pathways between two electrodes are particularly useful in facilitating effective charge collection (Fig. 1).8,9
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of vertically aligned charge pathways in D and A blend films on a PEDOT:PSS layer. Three cases are shown in which the D and A surface energies (γs) are related as indicated. 
Several groups have reported BHJs with a large interfacial area and vertically aligned charge pathways (Case 2 in Fig. 1). For instance, Yang et al. thermally deposited additional PC60BM on top of the [poly(3-hexylthiophene)] P3HT:PC60BM active layer to achieve a vertical composition gradient in the BHJ structure (power conversion efficiency (PCE): 3.8% to 4.5%).10 Yang et al. also achieved a vertically phase separated morphology by treating P3HT:PC60BM with high pressure (gas phase) carbon dioxide (CO2) for 48 h (PCE: 1.59% to 2.47%).11 PC60BM could be selectively plasticized by CO2 in the blend film and be drawn towards the surface due to the depressed surface energy. Baik et al. introduced an extra P3HT layer between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PC60BM layers using the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp method (PCE: 2.01% to 2.88%).12 Huck et al. demonstrated a double nanoimprinting process that allowed the formation of nanostructured polymer heterojunctions of composition and morphology that can be selected independently (PCE: 1.09% to 1.85%).13 Wang et al. reported an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template-assisted strategy in combination with a cross-linking approach to construct an array of robust and well-organized cross-linkable [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester nanorods.14 However, these fabrication processes are very difficult or expensive for large-area fabrication approaches. A BHJ with a large interfacial area and vertically aligned charge pathways may be constructed by tuning the interactions between D and A in a mixed solution.
Such interactions depend strongly on the surface energies (γs) of the materials. For example, materials with different surface energies can form segregated phases due to strong repulsive interactions between the D and A domain surfaces. If the surface energy of A is closer to that of the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer, aggregated A domains may localize around the PEDOT:PSS layer,15 thereby forming a gradient nanostructure with A-rich domains at the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer and D-rich domains at the top surface. Such structures yield inefficient charge collection (Case 1).8,9 The reverse gradient case could yield efficient charge collection in principle (Case 3); however, the interfacial area in such a BHJ would be low due to the large domain sizes. The rate of successful exciton diffusion to the interfaces would, therefore, be low. In the event that D and A were characterized by similar surface energies, the repulsive forces between D and A domains would be weak, leading to the formation of a homogeneous phase with a large interfacial area (Case 2).
Here, we report a novel method for modulating the compositions of BHJs along the vertical direction to achieve a large interfacial area between the P3HT and PC60BM domains via the addition of small amounts (ca. 0.5 wt%) of a novel composition gradient inducer, 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-N-phenyl-butyramide (F-ADD) (Fig. 2).16 F-ADD, which comprises a benzene moiety and a fluorinated alkyl substituent, exhibited good solubility in several organic solvents, including chloroform, acetonitrile, and dichlorobenzene. Previously, a fluorinate alkyl substituent fullerene (F-PC60BM) was reported by Hashimoto and coworkers. Hydrophobic F-PC60BM, which has low miscibility with P3HT and PCBM, was located between a photoactive layer and an Al electrode and acted as a dipole induced interlayer.17

See Fig. S2† for UV-Vis absorption spectra in various concentrations (the inset shows a film prepared from F-ADD). Films were obtained by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) onto a PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrate. The film thickness was 200 nm. Films were heated at 150 °C for 10 min. 
Two BHJ blend additives have been described previously: one additive induced crystallization18 and another promoted the processability of the blend.19,20 These additives were not found to modulate the nanostructure alignment, therefore, this is the first demonstration that a small molecule present at a concentration of less than 1.0 wt% can induce a gradient in the nanostructure alignment simply by mixing the additive with the active polymers and PC60BM. The increased interfacial area shortened the path length traveled by an exciton to the donor–acceptor interface, thereby improving exciton separation and charge collection.
Experimental section
Instrumentation

1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker BioSpin AG system operated at 400 MHz. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an OPTIZEN POP UV-vis-near-IR Single beam spectrophotometer and Jasco FP-6500 spectrometer, respectively. The atomic force microscope (AFM) (Dimension 3100, VEECO) was operated in tapping mode to acquire images of the surfaces of polymer blend films.
Sample preparation for AFM, contact angle and SIMS measurements
Samples were prepared on 25 × 25 mm non-patterned ITO coated glass substrates. The ITO-coated glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. Solar cells were fabricated by first spin-coating a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, VP Al 4083, PEDOT:PSS:IPA = 1:2 (by volume)) buffer layer on top of ITO-coated glass substrates at 3500 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 180 °C for 12 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. 200 μL of 20 mg mL−1 of blended solutions was spin-coated on ITO at 1000 rpm. The resulting thin films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes.
Device fabrication and evaluation
Solar cell devices were fabricated on 25 × 25 mm pre-patterned ITO coated glass substrates. The ITO-coated glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. The ITO-coated glass was treated with UV-ozone for 5 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P, VP AI 4083, PEDOT:PSS/IPA (1/2 by volume) solution was spin-coated with 30 nm thickness and the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 180 °C for 12 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. The blend of P3HT:PC60BM (1:1 (by weight), 1,2-dichlorobenzene–chlorobenzene = 9:1 v/v) solution was spin-coated at 600 rpm for 40 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a 230 nm thick active layer. The cathode consisted of Ca (∼3 nm) capped with Al (100 nm) which was thermally evaporated at a pressure of ca. 1 × 10−6 torr to obtain 16 identical cells (an active area of 0.04 cm2). The unencapsulated solar cells were tested under ambient conditions using a Keithley 2400 SMU and an Oriel xenon lamp (450 W) with an AM1.5 filter. A mask was used to define the device illumination area of 0.04 cm2 to minimize photocurrent generation from the edge of the electrodes. The solar cells (with no protective encapsulation) were then tested in air under an AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator), which was calibrated with a KG5 filter covered silicon photovoltaic solar cell traceable to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a photomodulation spectroscopic setup (model Merlin, Oriel), a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR570 low noise current amplifier.
Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurement was done using the SIMS system (IMS-6f (Physical Electronics USA, Chanhassen, MN)). Beam energy was 15 keV using CS+ ions as the primary ions and raster was 250 microns (depth) and 100 microns (image). Base pressure was always below 2 × 10−9 torr.
Synthesis and characterization of 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-N-phenyl-butyramide (F-ADD)
In an oven dried 100 mL round bottom flask, aniline (500 mg, 5.3 mmol) and triethylamine (540 mg, 5.4 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of acetonitrile and then stirred at room temperature under argon atmosphere for 15 minutes. 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-Heptafluoro-butyryl chloride (1.5 g, 6 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture reacted for 2 h at room temperature. The solvents were removed by vacuum distillation, and then a white solid was obtained. The pure white solid was obtained after recrystallization from dichloromethane with 80% (1.2 g) yield. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.82 (b, 1H, NH), 7.50 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 2H, –Ph), 7.34 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H, –Ph), 7.21–7.17 (m, 1H, –Ph). 19F-NMR (CDCl3, 282 MHz): 80.5 (t, J = 8.7 Hz, 3F, CF3), 120.3 (m, 2F, CF2), 126.7 (s, 2F, CF2). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz): 155.6, 136.7, 129.6, 126.3, 121.9, 117.7, 108.9, 108.8.

Results and discussion

Fig. 2a and b compare the miscibilities among F-ADD, P3HT, and PC60BM. F-ADD was highly miscible with PC60BM, and no phase separation was observed;21 however, P3HT and F-ADD were immiscible and produced a phase-separated film with a rough surface. The miscibility results indicated that F-ADD preferentially and selectively interacted with PC60BM but not with P3HT. The selective interaction between F-ADD and PC60BM was not expected to disrupt the crystallinity of the P3HT domains. Indeed, F-ADD did not produce any concentration-dependent changes in the absorption spectra of the films on a PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate. Note that F-ADD does not display an absorption band in the range of 300–700 nm (see Fig. 2e). The characteristic absorption peaks at 555 nm and 600 nm of the blend films containing F-ADD originated from the vibronic absorption of the crystalline domains.22,23 These peaks were indistinguishable from the peaks of the control blend (Fig. 2c). These results were consistent with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study results, in which similar intensities for the (100) diffraction peak were obtained at 2θ = 5.4°, corresponding to an edge-on structure (Fig. 2d).24,25 These results demonstrated that F-ADD did not disrupt the crystallinity of the P3HT domains due to the strong selective interactions of F-ADD with PC60BM. Consequently, we investigated the origin of the selective interaction between F-ADD and PC60BM to confirm the π–π interactions between the PC60BM core and the F-ADD benzene moiety.26,27 We measured the solubility of PC60BM in hexane (0.087 mg mL−1) and fluorinated alkyls such as tetradecafluorohexane (0.040 mg mL−1) which were much less than that in benzene (16.0 mg mL−1),26 indicating strong interactions between the PC60BM core and the F-ADD benzene moiety, rather than the fluorinated alkyl side. These results suggested that the selective interactions between F-ADD and PC60BM could be mainly ascribed to the π–π interactions between the PC60BM core and the F-ADD benzene moiety, rather than the fluorinated alkyl group of F-ADD.

Fig. 2e or f show the absorption spectra, respectively, in a chloroform solution or in the film state, of a blend containing F-ADD and PC60BM. The film was prepared on a PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate. No significant intermolecular interactions were observed in the chloroform solution containing the mixture of F-ADD and PC60BM, as the intermolecular π–π interactions were not strong in solution (Fig. 2e and S2†). By contrast, the intensity of an absorption band observed in the film state over the range 370–550 nm, which corresponded to disordered aggregates of PC60BM, decreased as the F-ADD content increased (Fig. 2f) due to the increased π–π interaction strength between the benzene moiety of F-ADD and the PC60BM core. No photophysical interactions were observed between F-ADD and PC60BM, based on the unchanged absorption band at 335 nm (λmax).
The ability of F-ADD to tune the PC60BM surface energy as well as the interaction strength between P3HT and PC60BM was tested by measuring the surface energies of mixtures containing PC60BM and various amounts of F-ADD (Fig. 3). The surface energy (44.6 mN m−1) of PC60BM exceeded that of P3HT (32.3 mN m−1). The surface energy of F-ADD on the PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrate could not be measured, most likely due to the hydrophobicity of F-ADD (see the inset in Fig. 2f as well as Fig. S1† for an enlarged image). The synergistic reduction in the surface energy of the mixture (PC60BM and F-ADD) depended on the concentration of F-ADD present, and an exponential decrease was observed with increasing F-ADD concentrations.29 The surface energies (34.5–30.6 mN m−1) of certain mixtures of PC60BM and F-ADD (0.5–1.0 wt% F-ADD) were comparable to the surface energy of P3HT. An F-ADD content exceeding 3.0 wt% yielded a mixture surface energy that was much smaller than that of P3HT. These results demonstrated that the addition of small amounts of F-ADD to PC60BM was sufficient to tune the surface energy of the mixture containing PC60BM. The tunable surface energy could be used to modulate the phase-separated nanostructure morphologies in the P3HT and PC60BM blends.
 Fig. 3  The surface energy of mixtures containing PC60BM and various amounts of F-ADD. Schematic diagram illustrating the intermolecular interactions between P3HT and PC60BM molecules. The presence of F-ADD modulated the interaction strength, as indicated by the contact angle measurements obtained using DI water and glycerol (see Fig. S2†). 
We next measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the blend films (Fig. 4a). The PL intensities increased with increasing F-ADD content (up to 10 wt%). This was ascribed to a reduction in the interfacial area in the BHJ. In general, PL quenching due to charge transfer from excited P3HT centers to PC60BM centers is enhanced for larger interfacial areas. A larger interfacial area is only possible with the formation of small P3HT and PC60BM domain sizes. We therefore concluded that small P3HT and PC60BM domains increased in prevalence upon the addition of up to 1.0 wt% F-ADD but decreased in prevalence upon the addition of more than 3.0 wt% F-ADD (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4c shows AFM images of the top surface of the blend films. Rough surfaces with phase separation became smooth until the addition of 1.0 wt% F-ADD to the blend.23 The dependence of the surface roughness on the F-ADD content was attributed to the relative surface energies of PC60BM and P3HT, as discussed above. In addition, this result suggested that the chemical composition could be inversed depending on the amounts of F-ADD as illustrated in Fig 4b.

The film thickness was 200 nm; films were treated at 150 °C for 10 min. 

Fig. 5b shows the relative [S]/[O] ratios at the top layer of the P3HT and PC60BM blends on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate, obtained from a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) (see Fig. S3†).30 The oxygen signal from PC60BM could not be distinguished from the oxygen signal from F-ADD; therefore, the values were corrected based on the amount of F-ADD added to each mixture. The relative ratio of [S]/[O] (S and O from P3HT and PC60BM/F-ADD, respectively) decreased as the F-ADD content in the blend increased, indicating that the top layer was gradually enriched with PC60BM. This result also suggested that the chemical composition along the vertical direction could be varied.

The chemical compositions of the blends along the vertical direction, modulated by F-ADD, were characterized by surface mapping analysis of the oxygen atoms at the top surface and at a depth of 170 nm (Fig. 5c). Prior to the addition of F-ADD to the blend, a greater concentration of oxygen atoms was observed at the bottom layer, indicating the presence of a PC60BM-rich domain (Case 1, γs(PEDOT:PSS) ≫ γs(M) > γs(P3HT)), where M indicates PC60BM or a mixture containing PC60BM and F-ADD. This concentration yielded a vertical nanostructural gradient in the BHJ. The images obtained at the surface and at a depth of 170 nm were indistinguishable upon the addition of 0.5 wt% F-ADD. These images indicated a vertically homogeneous compositional distribution in the BHJ (Case 2, γs(PEDOT:PSS) ≫ γs(M) ≈ γs(P3HT)). The addition of 10 wt% F-ADD increased the concentration of oxygen atoms at the top surface in a PC60BM-rich domain (Case 3, γs(PEDOT:PSS) ≫ γs(P3HT) > γs(M)). This distribution indicated the formation of a vertical nanostructural gradient in the BHJ. The composition distribution of the nanostructures along the vertical direction could be modulated by controlling the surface energy of the mixture, which contained PC60BM domains, through the addition of F-ADD. F-ADD addition therefore inverted the chemical composition distribution relative to the surface.
We further characterized the fluorine atom content in the P3HT and PC60BM blends on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates. One possibility was that F-ADD segregated from the surface of the films due to the low surface energy of the fluoroalkyl chains, indicating that the F-ADD molecules did not selectively interact with the PC60BM domains, as observed by Hashimoto and coworkers using F-PC60BM.28Fig. 6 shows that, in general, the fluorine atoms were vertically well-dispersed from the surface to the bottom layers of the films, but the relative fluorine atom content varied with the F-ADD concentration. A 1.0 wt% F-ADD blend yielded a uniform fluorine atom content at both the surface and the bottom layers, as expected in Case 2. The fluorine atom content increased as the F-ADD content in the blend increased (Case 3), indicating that the top layer gradually became enriched with F-ADD, consistent with the trend observed with PC60BM. This result demonstrated that F-ADD selectively interacted only with PC60BM.
 Fig. 6  Vertical distribution of F-ADD, obtained from a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS), in P3HT:PC60BM blend films with 1.0 (a), 3.0 (b), and 5.0 (c) wt% F-ADD. The instrumental detection limit was 1.0 wt% F-ADD. 
Finally, we measured the photovoltaic performances of the nanostructures using a 230 nm thick active layer (Table 1, Fig. S4 and S5†).16 The devices (4.3–4.4% PCE: power conversion efficiency) with a vertically homogeneous composition in the nanostructured BHJ (Case 2), which were characterized by a large interfacial area stabilized by the addition of 0.5–1.0 wt% F-ADD, exhibited much better photovoltaic performances than the control device (3.2%, Fig. 7a). The performance improvement was mainly due to an increase in the current density (Fig. 7b, see also Fig. S6†) and fill factor (FF), demonstrating the formation of BHJs with a high interfacial area and good vertically aligned charge pathways. The photovoltaic performance decreased, however, as the F-ADD content was further increased (3.0–10 wt%, Fig. 7c). These devices formed a vertically aligned gradient in the nanostructured BHJs in which the PC60BM-rich domains were localized at the top and the P3HT-rich domains were localized at the bottom layers (Case 3). Although a high JSC value was expected, this was not, in fact, observed, most likely due to the large domain sizes.

The JSC values were found to correlate well with the PL quenching, suggesting that the BHJs with small domain sizes retained a short exciton pathway length and a higher number of photoinduced electrons could be generated. The dark current density (JDARK) was lower in the nanostructured BHJ with a vertically homogeneous distribution than in the BHJ with a vertical gradient (Fig. 7d, see also Fig. S7†). The smaller domains yielded smoother surface, as shown in Fig. 4b, thereby improving the contact between the active layer and the cathode and reducing the leakage current.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the in situ modulation of a vertical compositional distribution in a blend of P3HT and PC60BM by adding a novel composition gradient inducer. F-ADD selectively interacted with PC60BM due to a strong π–π stacking between PC60BM and the benzene moiety, thereby altering the surface energy of the domain containing PC60BM. The BHJs with a vertically homogenous compositional distribution and small domain sizes formed under conditions in which the surface energies of P3HT and PC60BM (0.5–1.0 wt% of F-ADD) were similar. These BHJ devices exhibited better photovoltaic performances than the nanostructured BHJ devices with vertical gradients. Ongoing studies will continue to systematically optimize the composition and concentration of the additives in an effort to apply this novel concept to the development of devices prepared from more highly efficient polymers. This novel concept will be extended toward the creation of new photoactive materials with tuned surface energies.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of vertically aligned charge pathways in D and A blend films on a PEDOT:PSS layer. Three cases are shown in which the D and A surface energies (γs) are related as indicated.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Images of pure P3HT films or blend films containing P3HT and F-ADD. (b) Images of pure PC60BM films or blend films containing PC60BM and F-ADD. (c) UV-Vis absorption spectra of the P3HT:PC60BM blend films containing F-ADD. (d) XRD spectra of the P3HT:PC60BM blend films containing F-ADD. (e and f) UV-Vis absorption spectra of F-ADD, PC60BM, or a blend containing PC60BM and F-ADD, in either 8.0 × 10−4 M chloroform solution or the film state, respectively. See Fig. S2† for UV-Vis absorption spectra in various concentrations (the inset shows a film prepared from F-ADD). Films were obtained by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) onto a PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrate. The film thickness was 200 nm. Films were heated at 150 °C for 10 min.	 

 	Fig. 3  The surface energy of mixtures containing PC60BM and various amounts of F-ADD. Schematic diagram illustrating the intermolecular interactions between P3HT and PC60BM molecules. The presence of F-ADD modulated the interaction strength, as indicated by the contact angle measurements obtained using DI water and glycerol (see Fig. S2†).	 

 	Fig. 4  Photoluminescence (PL) spectra with excitation at 570 nm (a), schematic representation (b) of the expected top morphology and AFM images (height mode) (c) of P3HT:PC60BM blend films containing various amounts of F-ADD on a PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate. The film thickness was 200 nm; films were treated at 150 °C for 10 min.	 

 	Fig. 5  Plausible mechanism for the formation of vertical composition gradients (a); relative [S]/[O] ratios at the top layer (30 nm) (b), obtained from a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS); and surface mapping analysis images of the oxygen atoms at the top surface and at a depth of 170 nm (c) in the P3HT and PC60BM blends on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate (image dimensions: 95 μm × 75 μm).	 

 	Fig. 6  Vertical distribution of F-ADD, obtained from a secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS), in P3HT:PC60BM blend films with 1.0 (a), 3.0 (b), and 5.0 (c) wt% F-ADD. The instrumental detection limit was 1.0 wt% F-ADD.
