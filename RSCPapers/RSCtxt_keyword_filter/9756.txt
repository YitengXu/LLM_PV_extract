    , Accepted 23rd August 2018First published on 27th August 2018AbstractColloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells based on lead sulfide (PbS) have attracted tremendous interest due to their strong near-infrared absorption and air-stable photovoltaic performance. To improve the electron transporting layer in PbS CQD solar cells, we have invented a new synthesis protocol to achieve uniformly Cs-doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with finely controlled doping concentrations. An optimal amount of Cs doping can effectively passivate the ZnO defects, resulting in excellent transparency, ideal energy levels, high nanoparticle crystallinity, large conductivity, and smooth film morphology. These Cs-doped ZnO NPs can be used as the low-temperature solution-processed electron transporting layer in PbS CQD solar cells. Consequently, the PbS CQD solar cells adopting 5% Cs-doped ZnO achieved the best PCE of 10.43%, while the devices using pristine ZnO NPs only exhibit a PCE of 9.20%, which can be attributed to the reduced interfacial recombination and improved charge extraction at the PbS/ZnO interface. In addition, the devices using Cs–ZnO show extremely stable performance over three months storage under ambient conditions. Moreover, compared to reported Cs-doping of ZnO using sol–gel processing, our doped ZnO NPs demonstrate superior properties without high-temperature annealing, which makes them excellent candidates for use as the ETL in future flexible photovoltaics.
1. Introduction
Nanocrystal (NC) solar cells based on lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest in recent years.1–6 Due to their low-temperature solution processing, PbS CQD solar cells exhibit potential for low-cost and large-scale production.7–9 In comparison with organic and perovskite materials, PbS QDs possess an extremely strong quantum confinement effect, large absorption coefficients, high electron mobilities, and superior air stability after iodide passivation.10–15 In addition, recent studies have confirmed that lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) show a strong multiple exciton generation (MEG) effect,16–19 which can increase the theoretical efficiency of single junction QD solar cells to ∼44%.20 During the past five years, synergistic efforts on the surface chemistry of CQDs1,21–24 and device architecture optimization2,25–29 have rapidly boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PbS CQD solar cells to 12%.30
In solution-processed solar cells, interfacial layers are often introduced to reduce the contact resistance between the active layer and charge-collecting electrodes, resulting in improved device performance.31 To date, the most efficient device structure in CQD solar cells is based on a depleted heterojunction between the CQD active layer and an n-type metal oxide layer (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, etc.).32–34 This architecture created a depletion region in the CQD active layer, facilitating charge carrier separation and transport. Among the reported n-type metal oxides, ZnO has been commonly used as the electron extraction layer in organic solar cells and perovskite solar cells, especially in PbS CQD solar cells, due to its high conductivity, optical transparency and simple low-temperature solution processability.1,22,35–41 Nevertheless, low temperature-processed ZnO nanoparticles usually show numerous surface defects,42,43 leading to a reduced electron extraction efficiency and increased charge recombination between the n-type metal oxide/p-type CQD interface. In addition, the work function (WF) of ZnO nanoparticles (∼4.40 eV)44 is not well matched with the conduction band of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI)-treated PbS CQD films (∼4.26 eV). To solve the aforementioned drawbacks, several approaches have been developed, including using organic and inorganic passivating agents or interlayers.3,27,44–47 However, the incorporation of organic passivating agents results in limited charge transport.47 And inorganic passivating agents27,44 usually require high-temperature treatment. Interlayer strategies form an interfacial dipole between the CQD active layer and ZnO for effective electron extraction but do not directly reduce ZnO surface defects. Therefore, in order to further boost the efficiency of CQD solar cells, it is necessary to develop new approaches to achieve a ZnO film with both improved passivation and desired band-alignment. Cs-doping of ZnO is a promising approach and has been reported in organic and hybrid solar cells.48–50 However, these reported Cs-doped ZnO films were obtained by sol–gel processing and required high-temperature annealing treatment, which makes them unsuitable for use as the electron transporting layer (ETL) in future flexible photovoltaics.
Herein, we first reported the synthesis of cesium (Cs) doped-ZnO nanoparticles for application in PbS CQD solar cells by a facile wet chemistry synthetic protocol. A combination of characterizations indicate that 5% molar ratio doped ZnO can balance transparency and energy levels, as well as film crystallinity, conductivity, and morphology, and exhibit significantly improved electron extraction compared to pristine ZnO nanoparticles. This in situ doping of ZnO NPs during synthesis without high-temperature annealing shows great advantages over the previously reported post-doping of ZnO by mixing the dopant with a ZnO sol–gel.48–50 Consequently, the PbS CQD solar cells adopting Cs-doped ZnO as the electron extraction layer achieved the best PCE of 10.43%, while the device using pristine ZnO nanoparticles only exhibited a PCE of 9.20%. All these results demonstrate that Cs-doped ZnO is an excellent candidate for the electron extraction layer in CQD solar cells and may be implemented in other solution-processed flexible devices.
2. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, Cs-doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared according to a modified protocol for ZnO NPs:51 zinc acetate (ZnAc) and methanol were added to a flask, and after heating up to 65 °C, potassium hydroxide dispersed in methanol was added dropwise to the flask followed by heating at 65 °C for 3 h. Here, we conducted in situ Cs doping by replacing ZnAc with CsAc at varying molar ratios. The as-synthesized Cs-doped ZnO NPs were separated from the solution by centrifugation and dispersed in chloroform and methanol. Consequently, Cs-doped ZnO NPs with a doping level ranging from 0% up to 20 mol% were produced by varying the initial ratio of the CsAc precursor with respect to ZnAc, keeping all the other parameters constant. Unexpectedly, we found that when the molar doping ratio is higher than 20%, a large amount of precipitates appear, hindering the formation of monodispersed NPs. In order to confirm the Cs-doping, we performed morphological characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and elemental mapping on the 5% and 20% Cs-doped ZnO NPs (Fig. 1 and S4†). Elemental mapping measurements were performed on the selected area in the STEM image. Apparently, the entire three elements Zn, O and Cs are well distributed in the NP matrix, indicating the successful Cs-doping of ZnO NPs. Similar results can be found for the 20% molar ratio doped ZnO NPs (see Fig. S4†), which were also investigated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) (see Fig. S6†). The Cs peaks in the EDX spectrum again demonstrate the successful incorporation of Cs into ZnO NPs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic depiction of the synthesis of Cs-doped ZnO NPs. The right panel shows the drift-corrected HAADF-STEM images and the elemental mappings of Zn, O, and Cs for 5% Cs-doped ZnO NPs performed on the selected area in the STEM image. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then carried out to further investigate how Cs exists in ZnO NPs. As shown in Fig. S12a,† the Zn 2p peak remains unchanged after the Cs-doping. Thus, it is less likely that Zn is substituted by Cs. Instead, the Cs fills the oxygen vacancy in the ZnO. As shown in Fig. S12c,† the O 1s core level spectra show two peaks: the peak at ∼530.5 eV is assigned to lattice oxygen atoms (Zn–O) and the peak at ∼532 eV is due to oxygen-deficient defects (oxygen vacancies (Ov)), surface adsorbed O2, H2O and metal hydroxide species.47,52,53 After the Cs doping, we can observe that the peak of oxygen-deficient defects is considerably decreased, which indicates that Cs can effectively passivate the ZnO defects, resulting in less adsorbed O2, H2O and surface hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl-induced degradation is considered as a main factor for the reduction of device performance during storage.52,54 This mechanism can be interpreted by the following equation: Zn–OH + Cs–OH → Zn–O–Cs + H2O.53,55
In order to investigate the size distribution of the obtained NPs with varying Cs doping amounts, we first performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. As shown in Fig. 2, the pristine ZnO NPs exhibit a relatively small particle size of around 5 nm with uniform distribution. After incorporating Cs at relatively low contents (1% and 5%), the size and distribution difference between these Cs-doped and undoped ZnO NPs is almost negligible. However, as shown in Fig. 2d–f, further increasing the doping ratio from 10% up to 20%, Cs-doped ZnO NPs show an increased particle size and agglomeration. Specifically, 20% Cs-doped ZnO NPs present a serious degree of aggregation, which is not ideal for preparing a uniform and dense film. To confirm these results, we further performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements on the Cs-doped ZnO thin film (Fig. S1†). We found that the neat ZnO thin film and low-content doped ZnO thin film exhibit relatively uniform surface morphologies with less pin-holes. In contrast, higher concentration of Cs-doping significantly alters the surface morphology, inducing more pinholes and cracks on the surface. Therefore, both TEM and SEM results demonstrate that lower content Cs-doping will not have a significant impact on the size, distribution and relevant thin film morphology.

We then turned to investigate the optical properties of these doped ZnO NP films. The transmittance spectrum was first recorded to investigate the effect of Cs-doping on the optical properties of the relevant ZnO thin film. As shown in Fig. S3,† the ZnO thin film on quartz exhibits high transmittance in the visible spectral range, with an average transmittance of over 95% in the spectral range from 400 to 800 nm. The high transparency of the electron extraction layer guarantees the optical absorption of the photovoltaic device. However, Cs-doped ZnO films demonstrate decreased transparency in the visible spectral range with the increased Cs content in the film. We noticed that a higher doping concentration will result in reduced nanocrystal dispersity, as seen in the TEM image (Fig. 2). Subsequently, when cast from a solution with the same concentration, highly Cs-doped ZnO forms a thicker and rougher film. The increased film thickness and enhanced scattering due to surface roughness will lead to decreased film transmittance.48,56,57 Nevertheless, Cs-doped ZnO films at relatively low doping content (1–5% molar ratio) exhibit similar optical properties in comparison with the pristine ZnO thin film. All these films exhibit over 95% transmittance at a wavelength ranging from 400 to 800 nm, ensuring the high absorption and photocurrent generation in PbS QDs.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was then used to measure the energy levels of the pure ZnO and 5% Cs-doped ZnO NPs. In principle, the work function of these thin films with respect to the vacuum level (Evac) can be determined using the difference between the incident photon energy (21.2 eV) and the secondary electron cut-off in the high binding energy region. It is well known that alkali-metal doping can decrease the WF of ZnO.52,53 As shown in Fig. 3a, the WF is calculated to be 4.40 eV and 4.29 eV for the pure ZnO and 5% Cs-doped ZnO, respectively. The Cs doping can enhance the carrier concentration in the ZnO film and meanwhile decrease its WF by filling the oxygen vacancies and passivating ZnO defects, which is useful for improving open circuit voltage and increasing the depletion region width in the device.21,27,44

The crystal structure and crystallinity of the NPs are also important factors in determining the transport properties of the relevant thin film. Subsequently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to investigate the crystal structures of the pure ZnO and Cs-doped ZnO. Fig. 3b depicts the XRD patterns of ZnO NPs with different Cs doping concentrations. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the wurtzite structure of ZnO (JCPDS card no. 36-1451), and no additional phases or impurities are formed, confirming that the Cs atoms are well incorporated into ZnO and do not alter the original crystal structure. In addition, we observe gradually increased peak intensity with increasing Cs content in the NPs, suggesting improvement in crystallinity. This enhanced crystallinity would certainly indicate the decreased number of defect sites and charge recombination events, which is beneficial for achieving improved carrier extraction and charge transport. In addition, we observed a slight shift of the (101) diffraction peak towards lower angles when increasing the Cs doping concentration (see Fig. S5†), indicating increased lattice expansion. This may be attributed to the larger ionic radius of cesium (169 pm) compared to either zinc (74 pm) or oxide (140 pm). Therefore, Cs substitution at either Zn sites or O vacancies will lead to the increase of lattice constant.
The performance of Cs-doped ZnO as an ETL for CQD solar cells was further investigated by using a widely reported device structure,1 as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The ZnO or Cs-doped ZnO is used as the ETL, TBAI-treated PbS is used as the active layer, 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)-treated PbS is used as the hole transporting layer and gold is used as the top anode, respectively. Fig. 4b depicts the cross-sectional SEM image of the optimized CQD solar cell, which clearly shows each of the corresponding layers, and the thicknesses of each constituent layer of the device are measured to be 80 nm, 200 nm, 40 nm and 100 nm for ZnO, PbS–TBAI, PbS–EDT and Au, respectively. Fig. 4c indicates that the 5% Cs-doped ZnO has better energy level alignment with PbS–TBAI than pristine ZnO. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CQD solar cells based on Cs-doped ZnO as a function of doping concentration (0–20% molar ratio) were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 4d). The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The reference device with a non-doped ZnO film exhibits a PCE of 9.20% with a Jsc of 24.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.575 V, and an FF of 65.5%. In contrast, the performance of the devices with the doped ZnO layer is clearly dependent on the doping concentration of Cs. Increased Voc, Jsc and FF for the doped devices are clearly observed. The reduction of Rs for the doped devices indicates improved charge transport. The 1% Cs-doped ZnO-based CQD solar cells exhibit a Voc of 0.590 V, a Jsc of 25.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.8%, and a PCE of 9.88%. And the 5% Cs-doped ZnO based CQD solar cells output the best performance, with a Voc of 0.590 V, a Jsc of 26.2 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.5%, and a PCE of 10.43%. On further increasing the doping content to 10%, the devices exhibit a slightly decreased PCE of 9.77%, together with a Voc of 0.585 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.1%, and a slightly reduced PCE of 10.13%. Moreover, higher Cs-doped ZnO based devices exhibit dramatically decreased photovoltaic performance: the 15% Cs-doped ZnO based CQD solar cells show a Voc of 0.585 V, a Jsc of 25.2 mA cm−2, a FF of 58.1%, and a reduced PCE of 8.43%, while the 20% Cs-doped ZnO based CQD solar cells show a greatly reduced PCE of 3.07%, together with a Voc of 0.430 V, a Jsc of 24.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 28.9%. We speculate that the significantly decreased performance when adopting heavily Cs-doped ZnO may be attributed to the poor surface morphology that deteriorates the interfacial contact with PbS–TBAI. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies show that the ZnO film doped with 20% Cs has a much rougher surface (RMS roughness of 29.39 nm), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which is also consistent with the corresponding TEM and SEM observations (Fig. 2 and S1†). The external quantum efficiency spectrum (EQE) of the optimized CQD solar cells with/without (w/wo) 5% Cs-doping is shown in Fig. S7.† In comparison with the reference device, solar cells based on the Cs-doped ZnO film exhibit higher EQE values in the range from 400 to 800 nm, which is consistent with their measured short circuit current density.

Meanwhile, we investigated the effect of ZnO doping on the device long-term stability, which is considered critical to the practical application of solution-processed solar cells.58 Previous work has demonstrated that PbS CQD solar cells using the structure of ITO/ZnO/PbS–TBAI/PbS–EDT/Au exhibited excellent stability even under ambient conditions.1,45 However, to further improve the device stability, it is crucial to decrease the surface adsorbed O2 or H2O, which are known to trap the charges at the interface between ZnO and the active layer.52,55 Meanwhile, the hydroxyl-induced degradation is also considered as a main factor for the reduction of device performance during storage.59 A preliminary test of stability under ambient conditions (temperature: ∼20 °C and relative humidity: ∼30%) without any encapsulation shows that the PbS CQD solar cell with the Cs-doped ETL is more resistant to moisture and oxygen than the device with pristine ZnO, which is consistent with the decreased oxygen-deficient defect peak, indicating decreased surface adsorbed O2, H2O and hydroxyl groups after Cs doping, in the O 1s spectra (see Fig. S12†). As shown in Fig. 4f, there is only an ∼3% efficiency drop after three months storage under ambient conditions for the Cs-doped device, whereas under the same conditions the measured PCEs decreased by over 10% from their initial values for the device adopting pristine ZnO.
To further confirm the reasons for the improvement of device efficiency, a series of characterizations were carried out to gain insight into the interfacial energy level alignment, trap state density, and charge extraction and recombination inside the device. Surface potential variation was measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to verify the correlation between Voc and interfacial energy level alignment. As shown in Fig. 5, Cs–ZnO films present a lower surface potential profile compared to pristine ZnO films, indicating that the Cs-doping results in a decrease of 100 meV in the WF of ZnO films. This result is consistent with the UPS measurements. Hence, benefiting from the improved alignment between the WF of the Cs–ZnO ETL and the conduction band of the PbS–TBAI layers, the electron extraction from the active layer to the ETL becomes more efficient and meanwhile the energy loss at the PbS–TBAI/ZnO is reduced, resulting in enhanced Voc.

To further understand the enhanced performance of the CQD solar cells adopting Cs-doped ZnO ETLs, we measured the device J–V characteristics under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. S9,† the Cs-doped ZnO-based cell has lower leakage current and similar forward output current compared to the solar cell based on undoped ZnO, suggesting improved rectification and diode properties. In order to get more insight into the charge recombination kinetics at the PbS–TBAI/ZnO heterojunctions, we studied the changes of Jsc and Voc as a function of the illumination intensity.45 The power law dependence of Jsc upon the illumination intensity can generally be expressed as Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor, and the values of the exponential factor (α) of the device made from both ZnO and Cs-doped ZnO are found to be close to unity from the light intensity dependence of Jsc (Fig. S10†), indicating that both devices have very little bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. In Voc – light intensity measurements, the Voc should follow a power law relationship Voc ∼ sI, where s > 1.0kT/q is indicative of significant trap-assisted recombination. As shown in Fig. 6a, the value s is determined to be 1.72kT/q and 1.32kT/q for the device based on ZnO and Cs-doped ZnO, respectively. The significantly lower value in the Cs-doped ZnO based device indicates reduced trap-assisted recombination by adopting Cs-doped ZnO as the ETL.

(c) The Mott–Schottky plot of capacitance versus voltage measured in the dark for neat ZnO and 5% Cs-doped ZnO substrates. (d) The impedance spectroscopy analysis of the devices based on ZnO and 5% Cs-doped ZnO. 
In order to confirm the decrease of traps and defects in Cs-doped ZnO, we conducted photoluminescence (PL) measurements of ZnO and Cs-doped ZnO thin films on a quartz substrate. Previous work has indicated that the ZnO NP film shows two PL peaks: the sharp luminescence in the UV region (∼365 nm) which is attributed to the bandedge emission by exciton-involved radiative recombination and the broad luminescence in the visible region (∼550 nm) which is due to the defects of ZnO.45,60 As shown in Fig. S8,† a much decreased peak at ∼550 nm in the PL spectrum of the Cs-doped ZnO confirms reduced defects of the doped film. In addition, we also measured the electrical conductivities of pristine ZnO and the Cs-doped ZnO thin films by evaluation of the J–V characteristics of diodes with a device architecture of ITO/ETL/Ag (Fig. 6b). The electrical conductivity (σ) is described as I = σSd−1V, where d is the film thickness and S is the device area.61,62 The electrical conductivities of the pristine ZnO thin film, and the 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% Cs-doped films are calculated to be 1.32 × 10−3, 1.92 × 10−3, 2.38 × 10−3, 1.81 × 10−3, 1.71 × 10−3 and 1.69 × 10−3 S m−1, respectively. These results exhibit a similar trend to the corresponding solar cell performance. Cs doping at relatively low concentration (<10% molar ratio) leads to gradually increased conductivity, while doping into ZnO NPs at a higher content, the conductivity unexpectedly decreases. According to the XRD characterization, the crystal structure of the host material is disrupted by the added Cs atoms; and the surface morphology of the heavily doped ZnO film becomes worse, which may interpret the decreased conductivity at a higher doping concentration.
Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed to investigate the charge carrier density of ZnO and Cs–ZnO layers with a silver top contact and an ITO bottom contact.63 As shown in Fig. 6c, the charge carrier density of the Cs-doped ZnO film (1.03 × 1017 cm−3) is significantly higher than that of the pristine ZnO layer (7.48 × 1016 cm−3). The increased charge carrier density would promote the charge transport. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also employed to further confirm the interfacial charge extraction and recombination dynamics in CQD solar cells. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of the devices based on ZnO and Cs–ZnO ETLs, and the equivalent circuit model is presented in Fig. S11,† which is composed of the series resistance (Rs) and the recombination resistance (Rrec). The Rs and Rrec values shown in Table S1† correspond to the high-frequency region and the low-frequency one in the Nyquist plots, respectively. In both ZnO and Cs–ZnO based devices, the interfaces of PbS–TBAI/PbS–EDT and Au/PbS–EDT remain the same. Thus the change of Rs and Rrec mainly reflects the properties of the ZnO (or Cs–ZnO)/PbS–TBAI interface. Apparently, the Rs of the device with the Cs–ZnO ETL is 13.9 Ω, which is significantly lower than that of the device with the non-doped ZnO (23.3 Ω), indicating more efficient electron extraction. Furthermore, the enlarged Rrec values for the device with Cs-doped ZnO indicate reduced interfacial charge recombination at the Cs–ZnO/PbS–TBAI interface and suppressed leakage current.
3. Experimental
3.1. Materials and characterization
Lead(II) acetate trihydrate (PbAc2·3H2O) (99.9%, Alfa), zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(Ac)2·2H2O] (99.0%, Alfa), cesium acetate (CsAc) (99.0%, Alfa), potassium hydroxide (99.98%, Alfa), 1-octadecene (ODE) (tech. grade, 90%, J&K), oleic acid (OA) (tech. grade, 90%, Alfa), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide [(TMS)2S] (98%, J&K), hexane (95%, J&K), acetone (99.5%, J&K), isopropanol (g95%, J&K), acetonitrile (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), chloroform (99.7%, Enox), tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) (98%, Alfa), and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) (98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich). All the chemicals are used as received.
The morphologies were characterized with TEM (Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope). TEM samples were prepared by drop casting on copper grids with a carbon membrane. Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained using a Zeiss Supra 55 field emission scanning electron microscope in high vacuum mode at 15 kV accelerating voltage. Transmission spectra were recorded by UV-Vis-NIR spectrometry on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750 with an integrating sphere. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Veeco Multimode V instrument. UPS measurements were performed using an Omicron Nanotechnology system with a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 Torr. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements of the electron transporting layers were performed with a Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed using a precision impedance analyzer (6500B series). Photoluminescence measurements were performed on the samples prepared on quartz substrates by spin-coating ZnO or Cs-doped ZnO layers. The second harmonic (400 nm) of a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Mira 900, repetition rate: 76 MHz) was used to excite the samples. The optical emission was recorded using a cooled array detector (Andor, iDus 1.7 μm). The impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using an impedance analyzer (Metrohm AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) under open-circuit conditions. The equivalent electrical circuit diagram was determined by fitting the data using ZSimDemo3.30d software.
3.2. Synthesis of ZnO and Cs-doped ZnO NPs
The conventional ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized according to our previous report with modifications.51 2.95 g (13 mmol) of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O was dissolved in 125 ml of methanol in a three-necked bottle. Potassium hydroxide (26 mmol, 1.48 g) dissolved in methanol (65 ml) was slowly added to the Zn(Ac)2·2H2O solution, and the solution was kept stirring in ambient air at 65 °C for 3 h. ZnO nanoparticles were obtained by centrifugation and then washed twice with methanol followed by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min). The final product was then dispersed in 10 ml of chloroform, and the solution was filtered with a 0.22 μm filter for ETL deposition.
For the synthesis of the Cs–ZnO NPs, Zn(Ac)2·2H2O and CsAc at a molar ratio of 99/1 (1.46/0.02 g), 95/5 (1.40/0.06 g), 90/10 (1.33/0.13 g), 85/15 (1.25/0.19 g) and 80/20 (1.18/0.26 g) were used together, corresponding to the Cs-doping ratio of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively. The Cs and zinc precursors were dissolved in methanol (62 ml) followed by the addition of the potassium hydroxide solution (13 mmol in 32 ml of methanol) and continuous stirring at 65 °C for 3 h. The obtained solution was centrifuged and then washed twice with methanol followed by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min). The final product was then dispersed in 5 ml of chloroform, and the solution was filtered with a 0.22 μm filter.
3.3. Synthesis of PbS QDs
The synthesis of oleic acid (OA)-capped PbS QDs was performed via a rapid hot injection method under an inert atmosphere by following our previous work.41 In a 250 ml three-neck flask, PbAc2·3H2O (10 mmol, 3.8 g) and OA (7.0 g) were dissolved in ODE (60.0 g). The mixture was heated up to 100 °C and vacuumed for 2 hours to form lead oleate. The sulfur precursor was prepared by mixing 1 ml of (TMS)2S and 9 ml of ODE. When the solution was cooled down to 75 °C under nitrogen, the sulfur precursor was rapidly injected into the lead precursor solution with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was kept for the corresponding reaction time. After synthesis, the solution was transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. QDs were purified by adding a mixture of hexane and isopropyl alcohol, followed by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 5 min). The extracted QDs were then re-dispersed in hexane and acetone (volume ratio: 1:1) to precipitate QDs, followed by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 5 min). The obtained PbS QDs were dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored in solid form in the glovebox. For device fabrication, PbS QDs were re-dispersed in hexane (40 mg ml−1 for PbS–TBAI layers and 20 mg ml−1 for PbS–EDT layers).
3.4. Device fabrication and characterization of PbS CQD solar cells
Patterned ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, isopropyl alcohol and acetone in turn and then treated with UV-ozone plasma. A solution of ZnO/Cs–ZnO nanoparticles was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 2500 rpm for 15 s. The PbS CQD layers were fabricated layer-by-layer via spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 10 s in ambient air. For the PbS–TBAI layers, ∼40 μl of the PbS QD solution (40 mg ml−1) was spin-cast onto the substrate. A TBAI solution (10 mg ml−1 in methanol) was applied to the as-made PbS layer for 30 s, followed by two rinse-spin steps with acetonitrile. For the PbS–EDT layers, ∼30 μl of the PbS QD solution (20 mg ml−1) was spin-coated, followed by ethanedithiol (EDT) solution (0.04 vol% in acetonitrile) treatment and rinsing twice with acetonitrile. This process was repeated until the desired thicknesses were obtained. The films were stored in air overnight and then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox for electrode evaporation. A Au electrode (100 nm thick) was thermally evaporated onto the films at a pressure of 10−6 mbar. The active device areas are defined by the overlap of the anode and cathode to be 7.25 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PbS solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150 V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The EQE spectra were measured using an IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments, Inc., Solar CellScan100).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have invented a new synthesis protocol to achieve uniformly Cs-doped ZnO NPs with finely controlled doping concentrations. An optimal amount of Cs doping can effectively passivate the ZnO defects, resulting in excellent transparency, ideal energy levels, high nanoparticle crystallinity, large conductivity, and smooth film morphology. These Cs-doped ZnO NPs can be used as the low-temperature solution-processed electron extraction layer in PbS CQD solar cells. Consequently, the PbS CQD solar cells adopting 5% Cs-doped ZnO achieved the best PCE of 10.43% together with improved stability under ambient conditions, while the devices using pristine ZnO nanoparticles only exhibit a PCE of 9.20%, which can be attributed to the reduced interfacial recombination and improved charge extraction at the PbS/ZnO interface. Moreover, compared to Cs-doped sol–gel ZnO, our doped ZnO NPs demonstrate superior properties without high-temperature annealing, which makes them excellent candidates for use as the ETL in future flexible photovoltaics.
