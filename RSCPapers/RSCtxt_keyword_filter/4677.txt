    , Accepted 5th August 2009First published on 21st August 2009AbstractWe have developed a dual-chamber microfluidic microbial fuel cell (MFC) system that allows on-chip bacterial culture and conversion of bacterial metabolism into electricity. The micro-MFC contains a vertically stacked 1.5 µL anode chamber and 4 µL cathode chamber, and represents the smallest MFC device to our knowledge. Microfluidic deliveries of growth medium and catholyte were achieved in separate flow channels without cross-channel mass exchange. After inoculation of electrogenic Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1, current generation was observed on an external load for up to two weeks. Current production was repeatable with replenishment of organic substrates. A maximum current density of 1300 A/m3 and power density of 15 W/m3 were achieved. Electron microscopic studies confirmed large-scale, uniform biofilm growth on the gold anode, and suggested that the enhanced cell/anode interaction in the small volume may accelerate start-up. Our result demonstrates a versatile platform for studying the fundamental issues in MFCs on the micro-scale, and suggests the possibility of powering nanodevices using on-chip bioenergy.
Introduction
The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an electrochemical device that converts organic substrates into electricity viacatalytic conversion by microorganisms.1–3 It mimics the pathway that nature uses to recycle the energy from renewable biomass and represents a clean energy source independent of fossil fuels or solar illumination. In the past few decades, the concept of the MFC has been validated by successful demonstration of macroscopic devices and their subsequent uses for generating current from a variety of carbon sources.4–6 Power output in such devices has shown a continuous increase as a result of optimization in device architecture and operation,1 suggesting potential applications such as waste water treatment.7,8
Recently, there has been a growing interest in miniaturized MFC devices,4,9–13 not only because of their potential uses for portable power, but for their usefulness in studies of well-defined microbial communities to determine the maximal potential and fundamental limits of MFCs. High current and power densities have been achieved from mL-scale MFCs,9,10 although few studies have been reported for µL-scale MFCs, presumably as a result of the increasing technical challenges. Despite the originality of intricate designs for previously reported µL MFCs, maximum power generation from these MFCs was 0.5 µW/cm3,11,12 with power generation lasting up to 3 hours,13 performance that is insufficient for a practical on-chip power supply. Furthermore, the interaction between bacterial cells and the anode in µL-scale MFCs had yet to be investigated.
We report here our development of a novel microscale MFC system to address these key issues. The 1.5 µL anode chamber of our MFC is, to date, the smallest for all reported MFCs. The microfluidic MFC is fabricated on a silicon wafer that combines on-chip cell culture with local power generation, and could serve as a versatile platform for studying a variety of bacteria/anode systems in real time. We employed this device to study the interaction between Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and a gold anode. Current up to 2 µA has been generated from metabolism of an organic substrate followed by the expected response to substrate depletion. Correlation of current generation with data from our electron microscopic studies revealed enhanced cell growth on the gold anode in the microenvironment of our MFC relative to other niches.
Materials and methods
Materials and reagents
The following chemicals and materials were used in our experiments: Single side polished silicon wafers (3 inch, 380 µm thickness, 1–10 ohm cm resistivity, University Wafer, South Boston, MA), Nano SU-8 developer and SU-8 2050 photoresist (Microchem Corp., Newton, MA), Shipley SPR 220 positive photoresist (Rohm and Haas Corp., Philadelphia, PA), Nafion® membrane (Nafion 117, Dupont, Wilmington, DE), carbon cloth (Clean Fuel Cell Energy, Clearwater, FL), 184 Silicone elastomer kit (K.R. Anderson, Santa Ana, CA), polyethylene tubing (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), tryptic soy broth (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), sodium lactate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 18 MΩ water (purified with a Milli-Q Advantage A10, from Millipore, Billerica, MA), and Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA).
Device fabrication and assembly
Our micro-MFC device is constructed by stacking a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cathode chamber, a carbon cloth cathode, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) in sequence onto a silicon chip prefabricated with a gold anode and a SU-8 microfluidic anode chamber (Fig. 1A). Independent supplies of culture or growth medium (anolyte) and Fe(III) electron acceptor solution (catholyte) were delivered through the top of the device via two sets of microfluidic pathways.

Arrows indicate microfluidic flow pathways of electrolytes; dashed lines indicate the alignment of components for anolyte flow. (B) Operating principles of a MFC. Bacteria in the anode chamber (white) metabolize organic feedstocks and produce protons and electrons that are subsequently conducted to the cathode chamber (yellow) via PEM and an external circuit, respectively. (C) Photograph of a micro-MFC device filled with electrolytes. The signs denote the cathode and anode of the fuel cell, and a dashed line indicates the PEM. Scale bar is 2 cm. 
The anode chamber was defined by SU-8 negative photoresist on gold film. First, Ti/Au films (20/500 nm) were evaporated onto the polished side of a silicon wafer. The wafer was then spin coated with SU-8 2050 negative photoresist at 1000 rpm for 120 s. The photoresist was prebaked at 95 °C for 10 min prior to near-ultraviolet (UV) exposure from a flood source (Karl Suss America, Inc., Waterbury Center, VT) through a negative photomask containing the anode flow channel design. Following exposure, the wafer was baked at 95 °C for 10 min and agitated in Nano SU-8 developer for 3 min. The gold surface in the channel functions as the anode. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed the thickness of the SU-8 layer to be 100 µm, corresponding to the depth of the anode flow channel.
We used a commercial Nafion® 117 membrane as PEM. Nafion membrane was pretreated by sequentially boiling in H2O2 (30% v/v) and water, followed by soaking in 0.5 M sulfuric acid solution and then water, each for 1 h. The activated membranes were cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm squares and stored in water prior to use.
A PDMS stamp containing a cathode chamber was prepared in a silicon mold using standard soft-lithography techniques.14 A silicon wafer was first patterned with SPR-220 positive photoresist, followed by UV exposure and dry etching (SLR ICP system, Plasmatherm/Unaxis, Petersburg, FL) to create the mold. To replicate PDMS stamps, a 10:1 mixture of Sylgard 184 elastomer and curing agent was poured onto the silicon mold and cured at 60 °C for approximately 3 hours, then peeled off. Holes for insertion of 1.5-mm-diameter polyethylene (PE) tubing were punched through the PEM and PDMS stamp at the end positions of the anode and cathode flow channels. Conductive carbon cloth was cut to approximately 10 mm × 12 mm to serve as the cathode.
To assemble the dual-chamber micro-MFC, the anode chip was first sterilized with 70% ethanol then blown dry with nitrogen. The PEM, carbon cloth cathode and PDMS stamp were manually stacked in sequence while carefully aligning the tubing holes for the flow channels. The device was mounted on a custom chip carrier, and sandwiched between two acrylic plates. A thin carbon cloth wire and an electrical wire were used to extend the anode and cathode, respectively, to the copper pins on the chip carrier. An external load connected to the pins completed the circuit. For liquid transport, four sterile PE tubes were plugged into the holes in the PDMS stamp to form two independent routes for liquid. The assembled micro-MFC device used in our experiments has an anode chamber of 15 mm × 1 mm × 100 µm and a cathode chamber of 10 mm × 4 mm × 100 µm. Each device was tested by flowing sterile water through the chambers to ensure there was no cross-channel leakage.

          Cell inoculation and culture in micro-MFC device
The facultative anaerobe Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 (ATCC 700550) was used as a model bacterial system for micro-MFC operation. S. oneidensis was cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) under aerobic conditions at 30 °C for 24–48 hours with shaking at 100 rpm. At an optical density of 0.4–0.6 at 600 nm, the culture was shifted to room temperature and transferred with a sterile syringe to the inlet tubing of the MFC anode chamber. Once the tubing was flushed and the anode chamber was filled, the outlet tubing was heat sealed to avoid possible oxygen diffusion and contamination. The micro-MFC was monitored for current generation both before and after inoculation. Fresh anolyte solution (the TSB culture or 20 mM sodium lactate) was slowly injected into the anode chamber using a syringe when current dropped to the baseline level. The lactate defined minimal medium consists of (per liter of deionized water) 20 mM sodium lacate, 28 mM NH4Cl, 1.34 mM KCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.7 mM Na2SO4, 1 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 20 mM PIPES [piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)], 52 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and 1 mL trace metal elements.15 Fresh catholyte solution (50 mM buffered ferricyanide) was introduced continuously (50 µl/hr) through a syringe pump (KD scientific Inc., Holliston, MA) during operation of the MFC.
Electrical measurement and calculations
An external resistor (R) was connected between electrodes of the micro-MFC to close the circuit. Potential drop (V) across the resistor was recorded every minute (Keithley Semiconductor Characterization Systems, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH). Current through the resistor (I) was calculated via Ohm's law: I = V/R. Output power (P) was calculated viaP = V*I. Current density and power density were calculated based on the anode area or anode chamber volume, respectively.
Coulombic efficiency of MFCs operated in batch mode was calculated as previously described,1,9,12E = (CP/CT)*100%, where CP is the total coulombs generated by the MFC in one batch, and CT is the total energy content theoretically available, assuming lactate is completely converted to acetate. CP was obtained by integrating the area in the current versus time plot during lactate consumption. CT is calculated as CT = 4*F*V*[lactate], considering that conversion of 1 mol lactate yields 4 mol electrons (see equation 2). F is Faraday's constant, V is the volume of anode chamber and [lactate] is the initial concentration of sodium lactate substrate.
Bacterial fixation and imaging
After operating the MFC for several days to two weeks, minimal media15 was flowed through the anode chamber to remove nonadherent cells. The MFC was disassembled, rinsed, and adherent bacteria on the anode surface were immediately fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed with water, stained with 1% osmium tetroxide solution for two hours, and rinsed again. Samples were then dehydrated by serial, 10 min transfers through 50, 70, 90 and 100% ethanol. Fixed samples were examined using a field-emission SEM (FEI XL40 Sirion FEG digital scanning microscope, Oxford Instruments, UK).
Results and discussion
The general mechanism for energy production in MFCs is shown schematically in Fig. 1B. Bacteria in the anode compartment scavenge and consume organic substrates, producing energy for metabolic activity as well as electrons and protons. It has been reported that electrogenic bacteria can transfer electrons produced intracellularly by their central metabolism to an extracellular anode that serves as electron acceptorvia either self-secreted electron mediators, direct cell membrane-anode coupling, or electrically conducting pili.13,16–19 Once these electrons arrive at the anode, they are elevated to the higher potential cathode through an external circuit, forming a current. Efficient capture of these electrons, up to the limit tolerated by the electrogenic bacteria, is the basis for current generation in a MFC.1–3 In the case of the ferricyanide catholyte and lactate substrate, the electrochemical reaction occurring at the respective electrodes can be described by the following reactions:1,17 Cathode: Fe(CN)63− + e→Fe(CN)64−(1) (2)

Protons generated from the metabolism of lactate to acetate are conducted through the PEM to balance the charge in the cathode compartment. In this regard, our micro-MFC exhibits a short proton diffusion length (100 µm), which should theoretically lower electrolyte resistance and enhance power output.9,20 In addition, the short chamber height of our micro-MFC may increase the probability of cell attachment and biofilm formation on the anode, which would favor more efficient electron coupling.
Before closing the MFC circuit with a 100 Ω load, the open circuit voltage measured in this system was about 0.6 V (data not shown). Prior to injection of bacteria, measurements for sterile TSB medium that was injected into the anode channel as a negative control revealed a stable background current of about 50–70 nA for more than 10 hours (blue region in Fig. 2A). This background current could be due to the slow oxidation of organic substrates on the anode or trace metal impurities in the gold, and was on the same order of magnitude for several devices. Subsequently, 2 mL of S. oneidensis culture was slowly injected to flush and fill the anode tubing/chamber, and then the end of tubing was sealed for batch mode growth. Following the injection of bacteria, current increased to 700 nA within approximately 12 hours, followed by a relatively rapid decrease to baseline. Onset of current generation was fast upon inoculation; we did not observe a significant lag period in current generation as reported for most macroscopic MFCs. The lag period reflects the time needed to establish initial bacteria-anode electron transfer, and is dependent on the suspended cell density, adherence rate and subsequent electron transfer rate. The fast current response observed in our experiments suggested that the cell-anode coupling is efficient in our micro-MFCs. This is consistent with observations with micro-MFCs reported elsewhere13 and could be a generic advantage of these small devices.
 Fig. 2  Current produced from micro-MFC in batch mode operation in response to additions of (A) live S. oneidensis culture in rich growth medium (TSB) or (B) 20 mM sodium lactate in defined minimal medium. The data in (B) were recorded beginning 3-day post-inoculation. A filled arrow indicates the point of cell inoculation; unfilled arrows indicate batch additions of anolyte. Blue and pink backgrounds highlight the negative control and current generation regions, respectively. 
Once current production dropped to baseline, a fresh addition of cell culture was injected into the anode chamber. Current increased to an initial value of 500 nA, then further increased to a peak value of 1.8 µA over approximately 20 hours (Fig. 2A). A repeated cycle of addition showed good reproducibility of current generation in terms of peak profile and maximum current. Considering that current generation was observed after bacterial inoculation, sustained for a significant time, and was nearly two orders of magnitude larger than the negative control, we believe the observed current is an electrical visualization of bacterial metabolism in the micro-MFCs. In addition, the first peaks of current generation were smaller and more irregular than the subsequent ones, but lasted for a similar length of time. This start-up phase is attributed to the accumulation and/or acclimation of bacteria on the anode of MFCs operated in batch mode.21 Once established, more stable power output is observed upon organic substrate addition. Notably, our micro-MFCs exhibited a much shorter start-up phase (2-3 days) compared to their macroscopic counterparts (a few weeks). Considering the wide range of growth rates of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, with temperature-dependent doubling times ranging from 0.75 to ∼67 hours at 22 °C and 3 °C, respectively,22 the effects of storage on start-up and operation of this device remain to be determined. The use of bacterial spores or fresh inocula are likely to be required following prolonged storage.
Besides using TSB as organic fuel, sustained operation of the micro-MFCs was also demonstrated using a chemically defined medium. After 3-day preculture, 20 mM sodium lactate in minimal medium was introduced as new carbon source. Carrying an external load of 10 kΩ, the MFC exhibited repeatable current generation following each substrate addition (Fig. 2B). The maximum currents achieved in all batches were similar, 1.2–1.5 µA, which is indicative of reproducibly attaining maximal cell density under these growth conditions, leading to the stabilization of biocatalysis and MFC operation. Despite the tiny amount of lactate added to the anode chamber (30 nmol), current generation lasted for more than 30 hours, comparable to previous reports using Shewanella species in mL-scale MFCs.9 Estimated Coulomb efficiency of our dual-chamber micro-MFC, which has not been optimized for internal resistance and bacterial respiration, is 2.8%. This value is nearly 30-fold lower than the best value (85%) reported for all macroscopic MFCs1 yet 100-fold higher than other reported micro-MFCs (0.027%).11
Analysis of power and polarization curves derived from typical operation of our MFC (Fig. 3) yielded rich device performance information. By systematically increasing external load and recording voltage data at equilibrium, we noted the maximum power output from a single device was 23 nW. This is 11 times larger than reported for previous micro-MFCs11 and sufficient for powering ultra-low power nanoelectronics, such as nanowire biosensors23,24 or single electron transistors.25 Micro-MFCs can also be coupled in series to achieve larger potential and power as needed. The MFC polarization curve (Fig. 3, blue curve) exhibited a near-linear drop in voltage as current increased to 2 µA, indicating the micro-MFC operation takes place in the Ohmic region of the curve, which is typical for most MFC devices.26 Linear fitting of the curve yielded a relatively high total internal resistance of 30 kΩ, although separate resistances from contacts, electrolyte and PEM are yet to be determined. Higher internal resistance is expected for micro-scale electrochemical devices due to substantial increases in contact and electrolyte resistances associated with small contact area, although a reduced proton diffusion length can partially counteract this effect. High internal resistance could limit the maximum power obtained from micro-MFCs and adversely affect bacterial respiration. We believe this could be an inherent challenge for all (sub)micro-scale MFCs. Solving this problem via non-conventional approaches, e.g. utilizing nanomaterials to fabricate an anode with high surface area and enhanced reactivity, may facilitate breakthroughs in (sub)micro-MFC power and stability, which would redirect fundamental studies to the key step of bacteria/anode interaction.

It has been suggested that both adherent cells on the anode (biofilm) and cells in liquid suspension contribute to electron transfer, although the former is considered as the main contributor to power generation in most cases.9 Electron microscopic examination of gold anodes removed from our MFCs after one week of batch-mode operation revealed uniform biofilm coverage on the anode (Fig. 4). The biofilm contained densely packed S. oneidensiscells arranged in a multi-layer structure. A biofilm was only observed on the gold anode exposed in the channel and not on the PEM. After one week of MFC operation, actively dividing cells were visible (Fig. 4, inset), indicating the vitality of the biofilm.27

To address the influence of micro-MFC dimensions on cell adherence, we compared bacterial growth in (1) a 5-mL petri dish containing a 1cm × 1cm gold anode, (2) a 1.5-µL MFC with an open circuit, and (3) a 1.5-µL MFC with a closed circuit. A pregrown culture of S. oneidensis was used to inoculate each device with bacteria at the same cell density. After five days of growth, the gold anodes were washed with minimal medium and fixed, followed by examination for adherent cells using both optical and electron microscopy (Fig. 5). Anaerobic culture conditions in the petri dish (Fig. 5A and B) led to relatively low cell density on the gold surface (5 × 104cell/mm2), whereas the same culture conditions in the open circuit MFC (Fig. 5C and D) and closed circuit MFC (Fig. 5E and F) led to significantly enhanced cell densities of 3 × 105 and >2 × 106cell/mm2, respectively. We attribute this contrast to distinct differences in the microenvironments. Our micro-MFC has a much larger anode area-to-culture volume ratio (10 mm−1) than the petri dish (0.02 mm−1), which suggests that a cell from suspension has a much higher probability of contacting the anode surface in the micro-MFC. Surface chemistry predicts that organic molecules in solution will concentrate near a surface, favoring cell adhesion and eventual biofilm formation in this nutrient rich environment.28 On the other hand, the gold anode in a closed-circuit MFC serves as an active electron acceptor for bacterial respiration, while the gold anode in an open-circuit MFC or petri plate does not support respiration and is merely a surface. Although more quantitative studies are yet to be carried out to validate this hypothesis, we observed enhanced biofilm formation in the closed-circuit micro-MFCs, which is consistent with the significant current generation and short start-up phase seen for our devices.

Table 1 compares our results with representative miniaturized MFCs reported in the literature.4–13 Despite diverse experimental conditions, e.g. reactor design and size, organism, anode material, etc, all of which are known to influence MFC performance, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, without further optimization, our micro-MFC has achieved higher current/power density than the other previously reported µL-scale MFCs.11–13 We attribute this increase in performance to efficient proton transport, improved biofilm growth and excellent sealing in our device. Second, the present limitation in the development of µL-MFCs lies in the design and device fabrication for efficient harvest of bioenergy, as there is a drastic drop of current/power densities as device size shrinks. Third, the selection of anode materials could exert substantial influence on cell attachment and electron coupling. The best electrodes used in macroscopic MFCs have been carbon-based materials, such as graphite felts, graphite rods, carbon cloth, etc, due to their large surface area and functional organic groups favoring cell vitality4 as well as easy handling. As a result, the best output and stability have been reported from MFCs with carbon-based anodes.1,4 However, the intrinsic advantages of traditional carbon anodes have not yet been translated to microscale MFCs, as these materials are bulky and not compatible with microfabrication. Investigation of non-conventional nanoscale electrodes, such as carbon nanotubes,29graphene, or semiconductor nanowires will be indispensible for the future development of high-performance micro-MFCs.

Conclusion
We designed and fabricated a novel dual-chamber micro-MFC device and used it to investigate electrogenic bacteria-anode interaction for the development of an on-chip energy supply. Despite being the smallest MFC reported so far, the device showed significantly enhanced power density and sustainability compared to previously reported µL-MFCs. Through correlation with electron microscopic studies, we conclude that metabolic activity of the microbial biofilm and its efficient electronic coupling with the anode are responsible for the observed current generation in our micro-MFC. As the size of MFC devices shrink, optimization of the cell-anode interface is of primary importance. The microfluidic MFC device we developed could serve as a versatile platform for studying the interactive effects of cell growth, electrode reactivity, and ion transport at the micro-/nano-scale.

 	Fig. 1  Micro-MFC design and assembly. (A) Schematic representation of the MFC components. Arrows indicate microfluidic flow pathways of electrolytes; dashed lines indicate the alignment of components for anolyte flow. (B) Operating principles of a MFC. Bacteria in the anode chamber (white) metabolize organic feedstocks and produce protons and electrons that are subsequently conducted to the cathode chamber (yellow) via PEM and an external circuit, respectively. (C) Photograph of a micro-MFC device filled with electrolytes. The signs denote the cathode and anode of the fuel cell, and a dashed line indicates the PEM. Scale bar is 2 cm.

 	Fig. 2  Current produced from micro-MFC in batch mode operation in response to additions of (A) live S. oneidensis culture in rich growth medium (TSB) or (B) 20 mM sodium lactate in defined minimal medium. The data in (B) were recorded beginning 3-day post-inoculation. A filled arrow indicates the point of cell inoculation; unfilled arrows indicate batch additions of anolyte. Blue and pink backgrounds highlight the negative control and current generation regions, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  MFC polarization curve (blue) and power output (red) measured as a function of current.	 

 	Fig. 4  
SEM image of gold anode after MFC operation for a week, showing uniform coverage of S. oneidensis biofilm. Scale bar is 20 µm. Inset: individual bacterial cells in the biofilm. White arrows indicate cells undergoing binary fission. Scale bar is 1 µm.	 

 	Fig. 5  Optical and electron microscopy images of S. oneidensis adherent growth on gold anodes as a function of culture environments. (A, B) 5 mL petri dish; (C, D) open circuit micro-MFC; (E, F) closed circuit micro-MFC. Scale bars are 10 µm. Images shown on the left hand and right hand sides are optical and electron microscopy images, respectively.
