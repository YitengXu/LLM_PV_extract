    , Accepted 25th January 2019First published on 25th January 2019AbstractA systematic study for the rational design of porphyrins (P4 spider-shaped derivatives) with potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells is presented. Using density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/6-31G*) and time-dependent DFT (M06/6-31G*) we show that the UV-vis absorption properties of a spider-shaped Zn(II) porphyrin, previously synthesized by Stangel et al., may be greatly improved by applying some push–pull strategies in meso positions. We found that the selected triphenylamine push group induces a remarkable improvement in the absorption bands of P4 spider-shaped derivatives. The pull effect reached through the π-electron-rich phenyl group and the benzodithiazole (BTD) group allowed the Q bands to be red-shifted up to 689 nm, much longer than the 593 nm reported experimentally for the original spider-shaped porphyrin. The adsorption results of the P4 spider-shaped derivatives onto a TiO2-anatase surface model [Ti16O34H4] through the carboxylic acid group showed that the adsorptions energies were favourable and very similar in all cases. Natural bond orbitals (NBO) indicated a two-center bond (BD) O(carboxyl)–Ti(TiO2) for the porphyrin with the highest adsorption energy (8.27 kcal mol−1), and donor acceptor interactions from LP O(carboxyl) to Ti(TiO2) for the other porphyrins. The natural transition orbitals (NTO) for P4-derivatives-TiO2 confirm the nature of the excited states associated with Q and Soret bands. Finally, the frontier molecular orbitals revealed charge-separated states between those occupied and unoccupied, indicating a favourable charge-transfer process between the dyes and the surface conduction bands. In conclusion, this work showed a systematic study based on the push–pull strategy that improves the performance of porphyrins with the purpose to be used in dye-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Although there are efficient technologies for the collection of solar energy close to 50% in the case of multi-junction technologies, such materials are still excessively costly in terms of manufacturing and implementation. In contrast, solar cells based on colorants and organic chromophores still arise as a better alternative, reaching yields of around 15%, but with low manufacturing costs. Inspired by photosynthesis and natural pigments with a biological role, the use of molecular macrocyclic chromophores like porphyrins has been widely used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).1–6 These systems show efficient electron transfer properties with large possible modifications to improve panchromatic capabilities expanding the range of the absorption spectrum, as occurs with titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based DSSCs.7 This fact allows an improvement over light harvesting and light conversion capabilities, and an attractive green technology.
The study of porphyrins (also frequently called porphines in the past), has been described largely in recent decades, considering synthesis, spectroscopic aspects, and electronic descriptions, from the free porphyrin base to complex macrocycle derivatives.8–25 Through these studies, the presence in the visible region of the solar spectrum of one strong Soret (also called B) band around 400 nm and weak Q bands in the 500–650 nm region, has been described as characteristic of these types of molecules.8,11,23,25,26 However, changes in the intensity and red/blue shift of these bands can be achieved by chemical modifications of the porphyrin structure by addition of central or peripheral substituents.5,27–31 Diau et al. synthesized a porphyrin dye with a D–π–A (D = donor, A = acceptor, and π = aromatic porphyrin ring) architecture, reaching a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 10% (10.06, 10.17, and 10.24%).32–34 This type of rational design is called push–pull strategy31,35–40 and has been widely applied to improve the absorption properties of different metallo- and free-base-porphyrins.38,41–43 Other strategies to achieve an improvement on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells include the anchoring group position of the ruthenium dye molecule on titania surface,44 the alkyl chain substitution on dye efficiency45 and the introducing of better donors, π-bridges and acceptors in dye SM315,46 among others.
Some years ago, Stangel et al. synthesized a new Zn–porphyrin that they called “spider”-shaped porphyrin.47 This chromophore presents in each meso-position a para-phenylene vinylene (PPV) pyridyl moiety substituted in both meta- and ortho-with a dodecyloxy chain. The PPV moiety is a conducting group characterized by a small optical band gap, and its bright yellow fluorescence makes this group a candidate in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LED) and photovoltaic devices.48,49 The presence of dodecyloxy chains increases the solubility of spider-shaped porphyrin in organic solvents like dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene, and prevents the aggregation of porphyrins (steric effects). The authors show that these spider-shaped porphyrins have a PCE value of 5.12%.
Recently, Xie et al. reported the synthesis of four Zn–porphyrins (similar to the previously reported porphyrin dye YD20) containing a triphenylamine as a strongly electron-donating unit and ethynyl benzoic or benzothiadiazole (BTD) acid as acceptor units.50 These porphyrins showed a PCE between 8.6–10.9%. The triphenylamine (denoted YD20 in this work) substituent has been used as strong electron-donor moiety to design efficient DSSC51–53 Due to the electron richness, aromatic derivatives are widely used to improve the capacity of electron-acceptor groups.1,52–54
The purpose of the present work is double. On one hand, we wish to show that the photoelectronic properties of the spider-shaped-porphyrin could be improved by the bonding in meso positions of the electron donor and electron acceptor moieties used by Xie et al. On the other hand, to demonstrate that the application of a protocol of computational calculation in a systematic way can be very useful for the rational design of porphyrins with potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells.
2. Computational details
Full molecular geometry optimizations for the ground states reported in this work (Fig. 1) and derivative compounds were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G*55 level of theory in the gas phase, with no pseudopotentials being used. D3 dispersion was not necessary to consider in the optimization because the optimized structures describe adequately the photoelectronic properties when they are available. B3LYP combines the Becke's three-parameter nonlocal hybrid exchange potential with the nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr.56–58 This functional has been widely used for the calculation of the geometrical properties of organic macrocyclic compounds, providing results that are comparable to experimental data.59,60 Vibrational frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to effectively obtain a true-minimum of the potential energy surface (PES). Molecular orbitals and HOMO–LUMO energy gap were obtained using the aforementioned level of theory. Taking into account our previous works on the spectroscopic properties of porphyrin derivatives,7,61–65 the excited states and the electronic absorption spectra were obtained in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) in the solution phase. This methodology has been widely tested in the literature and also in our group, and the results are comparable to UV-vis measurements.7,61–68 The theoretical electronic spectra were obtained by Franck–Condon type singlet–singlet vertical transitions using 80 excited states for every molecular system, giving a total of 960 excited states. The solvent effect (toluene) was taken into account in the absorption spectra using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) with a dielectric constant (ε) of 2.37.69 The solvent toluene was chosen for the calculations, because it corresponds to that used for the measured spectrum of the spider-shaped porphyrin. The level of theory used for the calculation of the excited states was M06/6-31G*70,71 and has been successfully employed by our group in previous work.61 Because all the structures are closed shell, we did not consider using diffuse functions in the ground and the excited states. Truhlar's M06 functional is a global hybrid meta GGA (generalized gradient approximation) with 27% of Hartree Fock exact electronic exchange that includes a correction in the kinetic energy.72 All the calculations for the ground and excited states were performed using the Gaussian09 computational package.73 Density difference plots were made using Multiwfn74 in conjunction with Chemcraft75 software at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.

In order to gain more details regarding the electron injection capacity of the porphyrins studied in this work, we carried out calculations for the porphyrins attached to the TiO2 semiconductor surface through the carboxylic anchor group (COOH).28,76–78 The carboxylate group was bonded to the (101) plane of the TiO2 (anatase) model using the bidentate-bridging linkage mode. The TiO2 surface cluster model consists of [Ti16O34] atoms with four hydrogen atoms saturating the oxygen dangling bonds (see Fig. S1, ESI†). This [Ti16O34H4] cluster model was kept fixed in the structure optimization of dye–TiO2 complex so that it retains its anatase-phase structure. This type of constraint has been used successfully in studies of the interactions between TiO2 and different dyes.79–81 Our TiO2 model has an energy gap of 3.3 eV, which is consistent with the experimental results reported in the literatura.82
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          P8 spider-shaped model
Stangel et al. used a reduced model (P8) of the spider-shaped porphyrin by replacing the dodecyloxy-chains linked to the phenyl group by methoxy groups (Fig. 1).47 This change should not affect the energy of the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO, LUMO). They found that this reduced model presents a very similar structure with respect to the results obtained experimentally. In addition, their calculations indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals are entirely focused on porphyrin in accordance with Gouterman's four-orbital model.14 Inspired by this, we wanted to evaluate the ability of the reduced model P8 to predict the UV-vis spectrum by using the TD-DFT methodology at a theoretical level of M06/6-31G* in the solution phase. It is well known that the electronic absorption spectra are very dependent on the functional used. This is the reason why we performed a calibration procedure of the functional for P8 that consist to find the functional that predicts the best agreement with the experimental value. The calibration considered six functionals; pure (PBE), hybrid (B3LYP), meta GGA (TPSS), hybrid meta GGA (M06) and separated range (CAM-B3LYP, wB97XD). The results obtained for the excitation wavelength of P8 are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The longer deviation for each functional follow the order M06 (0.15 eV) < TPSS (0.19 eV), B3LYP (0.20 eV) < PBE (0.28 eV) < wB97XD (0.34 eV) < CAM-B3LYP (0.95 eV). Considering that the best description is found for M06, and that in our previous studies for porphyrins and similar compounds, M06 has been successful in the prediction of UV-vis spectra,61 we chose this functional for the whole study in this work. It is important to note that although B3LYP is a good functional to get optimized structures, it does not describe well the spectra of the porphyrins studied in this work, as above mentioned. The same solvent (toluene) as that used in the experimental work was used.47Table 1 collects the characteristic absorption properties of P8 obtained by our calculations for the Q and Soret bands, in terms of the excitation wavelength (λ, nm), oscillator strength (f), the electronic transition between molecular orbitals and its composition in terms of the molecular fragments. We also include the absorption deviation (eV) with respect to the experimental data.

As expected for porphyrin, two weak (Q) bands and one strong (Soret) band are obtained for P8. The theoretical results are in a very good agreement with the experimental data and show a negligible deviation in the Soret band (0.01 eV) and no deviation for the Qy band. For Qx the error is 0.15 eV. It is well known that an acceptable error in TDDFT calculations is about 0.2–0.3 eV,83,84 so the results obtained validate the level of theory used. Q and Soret bands correspond to electronic transitions between the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) (H−1, H, L, L+1) and follow Gouterman's model. They are porphyrin-based π orbitals.
In relation to the P8–TiO2 complex, both fragments were linked by a carboxyl moiety as an anchor group. At the experimental level, the porphyrin absorption bands of the complex are slightly red-shifted by about 5 to 12 nm with respect to P8 (see Table 1). The results obtained by means of TD-DFT calculations present the same trend, even producing a lower deviation with respect to the measured bands (0.09 eV for the Qy band). The Q bands for P8–TiO2 are transitions that involve only the porphyrin fragment (P → P), and with respect to P8, these are red-shifted by 51 nm (for Qx) and 28 nm (for Qy). An interesting aspect is noted for Soret band of P8–TiO2. The largest coefficient of the transition that contributes to the more intense band is not a transition porphyrin (P) → porphyrin rather it corresponds to porphyrin → TiO2. In order to take into account all the transitions of Soret band, we computed the natural transition orbitals (NTO) for that excited state. The results indicate that this band has contributions P → P as also P → TiO2. The latter means that a charge transfer between P8 and TiO2 could take place at about 437 nm. The localization of the electronic density in one fragment after the transition would lead to a destabilization of the complex. This is verified by a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of P8–TiO2 (2.09 eV) compared to the single porphyrin P8 (2.84 eV).
The results discussed so far indicate that the reduction of the long chains (dodecyloxy) to shorter ones (methoxy) do not dramatically affect to the electronic absorption. Furthermore, the TiO2 model used is suitable because an excellent agreement with the experiment was predicted for P8–TiO2.
3.2 Study of the influence of “spider legs” on photoelectronic properties
In this section, we want to study the influence of the “spider-legs” in the absorption properties and the stability of the spider-shaped porphyrin. For this, we cut off the spider's legs and replace them with hydrogen atoms. Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of spider-shaped porphyrin derivatives (P8–P2) and Table 2 shows the results obtained for the absorption bands. P6 system represents “six spider-legs”, P4 “four spider legs” and P2 “two spider legs” (for a molecular view of the optimized structures see Fig. S2, ESI†).

The results show a systematic blue-shift in the absorption wavelength and a reduction in the intensity of the bands from P6 to P2. In comparison to P8, Q bands are shifted up to ∼23 nm, and Soret band is shifted up to ≈12 nm. This means that the removal of spider-legs causes an increase of the HOMO–LUMO gap leading to a slightly increased stability in the order P8 (2.84 eV) < P6 (2.88 eV) < P4 (2.95 eV) < P2 (3.00 eV). Such stability varies around 0.1 eV (2.3 kcal mol−1) between porphyrins. An interesting point here is that the removal of spider-legs does not affect the nature of the absorption bands because all the porphyrins have P → P transitions. The results shown indicate that there is no substantial variation of the photoelectronic properties when we cut off the spider-legs.
3.3 Improving the photoelectronic properties of P4-spider-shaped porphyrin derivatives
As shown above, the electronic absorption properties of spider-shaped porphyrin derivatives do not vary considerably when the “spider legs” are cut off, and this scenario allows us to think about the improvement of the photoelectronic properties of this system. By improvement, we mean to achieve an absorption that requires less energy.
As stated above, Xie et al. synthesized a series of porphyrins containing an acetylenic triphenyl amine (Ac-YD20) derivative as donor group, and both acetylenic phenyl (Ac-Ph) and acetylenic phenyl benzodithiazole (Ac-PhBTD) moieties as acceptor groups. They applied these systems for the development of dye sensitizer solar cells, obtaining efficiencies between 8.6 and 10.9%. Inspired by this and by the push–pull strategy, we used these substituents for the P4 system, which is more symmetric and presents two free meso positions that can be used for adding substituents. Furthermore, the photoelectronic properties of P4 do not differ significantly from P8. In addition to that, we used a third acceptor group, an electron-rich biphenyl group (Ac-DiPh). Fig. 3 shows the molecular structures of the electron donor and electron acceptor groups together with the optimized structures of P4 derivatives.

(b) Optimized molecular structures of P4-spider-shaped porphyrin derivatives calculated with B3LYP/6-31G*. (c) Electron density difference (Δρ) surfaces of P4 derivatives at 0.0003 isovalue. Blue = charge concentration, orange = charge depletion. 

Table 3 summarizes the results of the photoelectronic properties of P4 derivatives. As can be seen, compared to P4, these compounds present a remarkable improvement in the absorption bands. The addition of the Ac-YD20 electron donor group to P4 leads to a strong red-shift of both Q and Soret bands, from 535 (P4) to 595 nm (P4-YD20-H) for the Qx band, and from 428 (P4) to 453 nm (P4-YD20-H) for the Soret band. Such displacement occurs with maximum values of 60 nm and 25 nm for the Qx and Soret bands, respectively. These results show that it is possible to tune and improve the photoelectronic properties of porphyrin-based compounds by adding a strong electron donor group in the meso position to the above-mentioned system. The results obtained for P4-YD20-H are even better than those calculated for P8 (554 nm for Qx, 437 nm for Soret). We find that the absorption bands of P4-YD20-H (595, 578, and 453 nm) are comparable to the spider system synthesized by Stangel et al., 593 and 553 nm for the Qx and Qy bands, respectively, and 435 nm for the Soret band.

In relation to the other substituted P4 structures (Fig. 3), the bands have a significant red-shift, especially the Q bands, as well as an important increase in intensity, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The values for the Qx band are 647 nm (P4-YD20-Ac-Ph), 654 nm (P4-YD20-Ac-DiPh), and 689 nm (P4-YD20-Ac-PhBTD). These results could be understood in terms of the frontier orbitals energies shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The addition of a “pull” unit in the meso position opposite to the triphenylamine causes a drop of the LUMO orbital and a rise the HOMO orbital compared to the corresponding orbitals in the P4-YD20-H dye, which lack this unit. In addition, we see that the modification from a π-electron rich substituent (Ac-Ph and Ac-DiPh) to an extra auxiliary electron acceptor group (BTD) stabilizes even more the LUMO orbital in the P4-YD20-Ac-PhBTD porphyrin, leading to red-shifting of their Q bands. For the Soret band there is no a clear trend between the effect of the electron acceptor moieties and the excitation wavelength, but the Ac-PhBTD group generates a slight increase of 4 nm (457 nm for Soret) with respect to P4-YD20-H.

On the other hand, we also calculated the HOMO–LUMO gap and the results for P4 derivatives indicate a gradual decrease; P4-YD20-H (2.41 eV) > P4-YD20-Ac-Ph (2.19 eV) > P4-YD20-Ac-DiPh (2.17 eV) > P4-YD20-Ac-PhBTD (2.00 eV), as shown in the molecular orbital energy diagram in Fig. S3 (ESI†). These results can be understood from the electron density difference between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1), as shown in Fig. 3(c), where it is seen that there are regions with a charge concentration (in blue) and others with a charge depletion (in orange) due to the excitation. This behaviour lead to charge-separated states that could produce more reactive states and consequently a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap.
The molecular orbitals involved in the transitions are not uniquely localized on the porphyrin macrocycle, but they have a high contribution of the electron donor and the electron acceptor groups (Fig. S4, ESI†). Electronic transitions concerning Q bands have a greater contribution to the frontier molecular orbitals according to Gouterman's classic four-orbital model. However, the nature of the transitions is not only π–π*, but there is also a high contribution of charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor group. This is a particular aspect of the push–pull strategy of design, and it can explain the increase in the oscillator strength values in relation to traditional porphyrin systems. In the case of Soret bands, there are mixtures between π–π* transitions and charge transfer from a donor to an acceptor group, including that from donor aryl (DAr) groups belonging to P4-spider-shaped porphyrin. Alternatively, we can see the charge transfer from the electron density difference (Δρ) plots between the first excited state (corresponding to a Q type band) and the fundamental state. As expected, the regions of density depletion (orange, Fig. 3c) are located mainly in the triphenylamine donor group and part of the acetylenic bridge, while regions of density increased (blue, Fig. 3c) are mostly localized on the porphyrin macrocycle. For the latter, as in the case of P4-YD20-H, and to a greater extent, on the electron acceptor groups added as acetylenic phenyl (Ac-Ph) and acetylenic phenyl benzodithiazole (Ac-PhBTD).
3.4 Adsorption of P4-spider-shaped porphyrins on the TiO2 anatase-type model
It is widely accepted that the absorption spectrum of free dyes can be affected when they are absorbed on a TiO2 surface85–87 and this is due to the usually covalent interaction of the dye and TiO2, which allows us to obtain the electron injection efficiency, that indicates the charge transfer capacity that will exist between the dye and the semiconductor.
To have more details in the charge transfer process between the dye and the semiconductor, we have performed theoretical calculations of the P4-spider-shaped porphyrin derivatives adsorbed on a TiO2 surface using our anatase cluster model and a carboxyl moiety as an anchor group. There are several forms of interaction between carboxyl and the surface of TiO2, however in the literature it is reported that the bidentate coordination88–90 favours the chemisorption. Based on this, we calculated the P4-derivatives-TiO2 complexes with this type of coordination, and the optimized molecular structures are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
Because the geometry of the systems can affect their electronic properties, a geometrical analysis of the type RMSD (root mean square deviation) was performed by comparing the isolated P4-porphyrin and the same porphyrin bound to the TiO2 surface. We obtained RMSD values of 0.22, 0.28, and 0.33 for P4-YD20-Ac-Ph, P4-YD20-Ac-DiPh, and P4-YD20-Ac-PhBTD, respectively, indicating that TiO2 does not generate a significant change in the geometry of the porphyrin.
In addition, the adsorption energies were calculated for each of the complexes, and the values are presented in Table 4. The results are very similar, and they vary between 7.57 and 8.27 kcal mol−1. The P4-YD20-Ac-Ph-TiO2 complex has the highest adsorption value (8.27 kcal mol−1), indicating the strongest interaction between porphyrin and the TiO2 surface. This interaction shows a similar range of distances between the carboxylate O and the five-fold Ti atoms in the three porphyrin derivatives (2.12–2.32 Å), and they are in agreement with other theoretical study using cluster models.79 To elucidate why the P4-YD20-Ac-Ph dye presents the greatest adsorption energy, a frontier molecular orbital analysis has been performed. The results show that this dye presents a larger LUMO orbital stabilization that results in a lower energy HL gap (0.64 eV) than those of the other P4-derivatives-TiO2 (Fig. S6, ESI†). From the optimized structures for these systems (Fig. S5, ESI†) it is seen that both P4-YD20-Ac-DiPh-TiO2, and P4-YD20-Ac-PhBTD-TiO2 present a distortion (torsional angle of 35°) between the two 6-membered rings of the anchoring moiety. The lack of symmetry between such rings affects the communication between the dye and TiO2, and as a result leads to a lower adsorption energy for these systems, which suggest a lower charge transfer.

Along with this, we analysed the natural bond orbitals91 for P4-derivatives-TiO2 looking for two-center bonds between the carboxyl O atom and the five-fold Ti atoms of the surfaces. The results indicate that P4-YD20-Ac-Ph is the only dye that presents an accepted two-center bond Lewis structure on the NBO92 analysis of the type BD O (carboxyl)–Ti(TiO2), confirming the highest adsorption energy with respect to the other P4-derivatives-TiO2. In according to the second order perturbation theory analysis of Fock matrix in NBO basis, the latter only presents donor–acceptor interactions from LP O(carboxyl) to Ti(TiO2).
On the other hand, in order to study how the interaction between semiconductor and porphyrin affects the absorption bands of the porphyrin, TD-DFT calculations have been carried out for P4-derivatives-TiO2. Table 4 summarizes the results of these calculations and the complete spectra are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Because some bands involve some transitions P → TiO2, natural transition orbitals (NTO)93 (NTO) that consider all the electronic transitions that contribute to an excited state were calculated. This methodology helps us gain more insight with respect to the nature of the excited states and has been widely applied in different studies.94,95 The results indicate that the selected excited states correspond to the representative absorption bands of the porphyrins (Q and Soret), which have the characteristic of being of the π–π* type. However, there is a small contribution of the donor and acceptor moieties, as can be seen in Fig. 5 for P4-YD20-Ac-Ph-TiO2. NTO results for the other P4-derivatives-TiO2 are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Natural transition orbitals (NTO's) of the Q and Soret bands for P4-YD20-Ac-Ph-TiO2 calculated at the M06/6-31G* level of theory in the solution phase (toluene). 
It is seen that Q bands are weakly affected by TiO2 and are nearly equal to those of the isolated porphyrin fragment (Table 3). This can be explained by the fact that TiO2 does not absorb in the visible region and the porphyrin maintains the chromophore nature. In the case of Soret bands, besides the contribution of porphyrin, they also present a contribution of the aryl groups due to their spider form.
Finally, the analysis of the frontier molecular orbitals for P4-derivatives-TiO2 were obtained and are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). For comparison, P4–TiO2 and P8–TiO2 are also included in the same figure, where it is seen that HOMO and HOMO−1 are mainly localized on the porphyrin core and present contributions of the electron donor moiety (YD20). For the systems containing P4, LUMO and LUMO+1 are localized on the electron acceptor fragment (TiO2). In all the cases, except for P8–TiO2, a charge transfer is produced between occupied and virtual molecular orbitals. In P8–TiO2, LUMO is localized on the PPV moiety and higher energy is required to arrive at TiO2 by LUMO+1.
In summary, our results demonstrate that the substitutions made on P4-spider-shaped porphyrin present an improvement of the absorption properties of these types of porphyrins. Furthermore, we showed a systematic method that allowed finding better photosensitizers with potential to be used in dye sensitized solar cells.
4. Conclusions
Several Zn(II)–porphyrin derivatives from the so-called “spider”-shaped dyes were modelled and studied systematically using DFT and TD-DFT theoretical calculations. We proposed improvements of these dyes using the well-known triphenylamine electron donating group and three different electron acceptor groups. For the P8 dye the results showed that the reduction of the long dodecyloxy chains to methoxy moieties does not dramatically affect the absorption bands, except for Qx, which is blue-shifted with respect to the spider-shaped porphyrin. Moreover, the systematic removal of the so-called “legs” showed an incremental blue-shift from P8 to P2, as a result of the destabilization effect of the legs in the frontier MOs, but maintaining the characteristic P → P transitions in this type of porphyrins.
Following the push–pull strategy to improve this type of porphyrins, our results indicated that the selected triphenylamine push group induces a remarkable improvement in the absorption bands of all P4 spider-shaped derivatives. In addition to this, the pull effect reached through the π-electron-rich phenyl group, and the auxiliary BTD group allowed the Q bands to be red-shifted up to 689 nm, much longer than the 593 nm reported experimentally for the original spider-shaped porphyrin. These results are associated with the well-directed effect of the donor group in the destabilization of frontier molecular orbital HOMO in all P4 derivatives, according to the Gouterman model. In the same way, the acceptor group stabilizes the LUMO orbitals, making these types of dyes more reactive in the visible region of the spectrum.
Finally, the adsorption of the P4 spider-shaped derivatives onto a TiO2-anatase surface model through the carboxylic acid group showed that: (a) the adsorptions energies were favourable and very similar in all cases; (b) the Q bands were practically unchanged with respect to the isolated dyes, maintaining the chromophore nature; (c) the calculated molecular orbitals involved in the electronic transitions revealed that the HOMO was delocalized over the electron donating group and porphyrin core, while the LUMO was delocalized on the TiO2 surface atoms, indicating a favourable charge-transfer process between the dyes and the surface conduction bands.
In summary, this work showed that the rational design is successfully applied to systematic studies of porphyrins improved by push–pull strategies within the context of their potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells.
