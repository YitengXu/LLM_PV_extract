    , Accepted 5th November 2013First published on 6th November 2013AbstractThree new donor–acceptor copolymers P1, P2, and P3 were synthesized with benzodithiophene with bithienyl substituents as the donor and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptors, respectively. The insertion of thiophene spacer between the donor and the acceptor broadened the absorption of the polymers P2 and P3 and resulted in a red shift of ∼30 nm as compared to that of the polymer P1. However, the inclusion of fluorine atoms on the polymer had detrimental effects on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. The synthesized donor–acceptor polymers were tested in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor. Polymer P2 gave a PCE of 3.52% with PC71BM in which the active layer was prepared in chloroform with 3% v/v 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. The effect of fluorine substitution and thiophene group insertion on the UV/Vis absorbance, photovoltaic performances, morphology, and charge carrier mobilities for the polymers are discussed.
1. Introduction
The low cost, light weight, flexibility, and easy processability on large area substrates make polymer solar cells promising candidates for renewable energy resources. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) as high as 9.2% have been reported.1,2 Extensive research has been performed in the past decade to improve the PCE of polymer solar cells in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device architecture.3–7 The active layer which is a blend of donor semiconductor polymers and fullerene acceptor of a bulk heterojunction solar cell (BHJ) plays a pivotal role. The short circuit current density (JSC) and the open circuit voltage (VOC) depend on the electronic properties of the active layer. A deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a strong absorption overlapping the solar spectrum are desirable properties of donor semiconducting polymers which are expected to provide high VOC and JSC, respectively. The benzodithiophene (BDT) donor–acceptor copolymers are in the forefront of the field of organic solar cells due to several advantages, such as a planar backbone and flexibility of attaching different substituents on the central benzene ring to fine tune the energy levels of the polymer.4,8,9 Alkyl, alkoxy, thioalkyl, phenylethynyl, and thienyl substituted BDT have been synthesized by various research groups and PCEs as high as 7% have been achieved.8–17
Previously, our research group reported the synthesis of a bis(bithienyl)-substituted BDT as a donor for organic solar cells which gave a PCE of 2.52% with benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor unit (Table S5 and Fig. S29 in ESI†).18 The attachment of six alkyl substituents per BDT repeat unit was highly beneficial due to several advantages: (1) highly soluble polymers with very high molecular weights could be synthesized, (2) the insertion of alkyl chains on the acceptor units was deemed unnecessary, due to the solubilizing effect of the six alkyl substituents attached to BDT unit, and (3) the conjugated bithienyl substituents perpendicular to the polymer backbone provided a broader absorption in the visible region.
Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole has been widely used as a strong electron withdrawing acceptor moiety in D–A copolymers.19–21 Recently, several groups have reported the insertion of thiophene spacer group in between the donor and acceptor moieties for efficient device performances in BHJ solar cells.22–24 The insertion of the thiophene spacer groups relieved the steric hindrance between the acceptor and the donor units and hence the polymers had a planar polymer backbone.19 This enhanced the conjugation along the polymer backbone, reduced the band gap, and improved the solid state packing and hence increased the JSC of the BHJ devices. The VOC of a BHJ solar cell device is largely determined by the HOMO level of the donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer as the VOC is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the D–A copolymer and the LUMO level of the acceptor fullerene.25 It has been demonstrated that the use of fluorine atom on the acceptor in D–A copolymers decreased the HOMO level and hence increased the VOC of the BHJ solar cell devices.26–29 In addition, the smaller size of the fluorine atom as compared to other electron withdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl groups and cyano groups has not imparted too much steric hindrance on the polymer backbone.15
Here we report the synthesis of three donor–acceptor polymers with bis(bithienyl)-substituted BDT as the donor unit and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptors by Stille coupling polymerization. The effect of fluorine atom substitution and thiophene insertion on the photovoltaic properties of the D–A copolymers has been investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Structural analysis

NMR measurements. 

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C or otherwise at indicated temperatures. The spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or in toluene-d8. The data are reported as follows: chemical shifts are reported in ppm on the δ scale relative to trimethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard, multiplicity (br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet).


GC–MS measurements. 
GC–MS was obtained on an Agilent 6890-5973 GC/MS workstation. The GC column was a Hewlett-Packard fused silica capillary column cross-linked with 5% phenylmethylsiloxane. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL min−1). The following conditions were used for all GC/MS analysis: injector and detector temperature, 250 °C; initial temperature, 70 °C; temperature ramp, 10 °C min−1; final temperature, 280 °C.


Solid–liquid chromatography. 
Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed on EM reagents 0.25 mm silica gel 60-F plates. Column chromatography was performed using the indicated solvent system on select silica gel (SiO2) 230–400 mesh.


Size exclusion chromatography. 
The average molecular weights of the synthesized polymers were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis on a Varian PL-GPC 220 system equipped with Varian PL-Gel Mixed D column (300 mm × 7.5 mm, 5 μm) and Varian PL-Gel guard column (50 mm × 7.5 mm, 5 μm). A GPC solvent/sample module was used with chlorobenzene with 0.0125% BHT as the eluent and the calibrations were based on polystyrene standards. The running conditions for SEC analysis were as follows: flow rate = 1.0 mL min−1, injector volume = 200 μL, detector temperature = 80 °C, column temperature = 80 °C. All the polymer samples were dissolved in chlorobenzene and the solutions were filtered through PTFE filters (0.45 μm) prior to injection.

2.2. Optoelectronic properties of the synthesized polymers

UV-Vis measurements. 
The UV-vis spectra of polymer solutions in chloroform solvent were carried out in 1 cm cuvettes using an Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrometer. Thin films of polymer were obtained by evaporation of chloroform from polymer solutions on glass microscope slides. In order to measure absorption coefficient of the polymers, 5 mg mL−1 polymer solutions were spin-coated at 600 rpm, 800 rpm and at 1000 rpm on pre-cleaned glass slides and the absorption were measured at the absorption maxima of each polymer. The film thickness for each glass slide was measured using a Veeco Dektak VIII profilometer.


Cyclic voltammetry. 
CV was obtained with a BAS CV-50 W Voltammetric Analyzer (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). Electrochemical grade tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was used without further purification. Acetonitrile was distilled over calcium hydride and collected over molecular sieves. The electrochemical cell was comprised of a platinum electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Acetonitrile solutions containing 0.1 M TBAP were placed in a cell and purged with argon. A drop of the polymer solution was evaporated in ambient air. The film was immersed into the electrochemical cell containing the electrolyte and the oxidation potential was observed and recorded. All electrochemical shifts were standardized to the ferrocene redox couple at 0.474 V.


Preparation of solar cell devices. 
Glass substrates coated with ITO were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. (Taiwan) and were patterned using standard photolithography. The substrates were cleaned by sonication for 20 minutes in acetone, methanol, toluene, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were subjected to UV/ozone treatment for 20 minutes prior to use. After the ozone treatment, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS was spin coated on the substrates (4000 rpm, 1740 rpm s−1, 90 s). The substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. Polymer/PCBM blends were prepared in chloroform with a total blend concentration of 15 mg mL−1. For the solar cells with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, the blends were prepared by adding DIO dissolved in chloroform to a polymer/PCBM blend such that the total concentration was 15 mg mL−1. These blends were spin coated (2000 rpm, 1740 rpm s−1, 60 s) on to the PEDOT:PSS treated substrate. Films of 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al were thermally evaporated on to the substrates at a rate of 2.75 Å s−1 through a shadow mask to obtain the solar cell devices.
IV testing was carried out under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere using a Keithley 236, model 9160 interfaced with LabView software. The solar simulator used was a THERMOORIEL equipped with a 300 W Xenon lamp; the intensity of the light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a NREL certified Hamamatsu silicon photodiode. The active area of the devices was 0.1 cm2. The active layer film thickness was measured using a Veeco Dektak VIII profilometer.


Space charge limited current measurements. 
ITO patterned glass substrates were cleaned by sonication for 20 minutes in acetone, methanol, toluene, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were subjected to UV/ozone treament for 20 minutes prior to use. After the ozone treatment, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS was spin coated on the substrates (4000 rpm, 1740 rpm s−1, 90 s). The substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. Polymer solutions (15 mg mL−1 concentration) were prepared in chloroform and were spin coated (2000 rpm, 1740 rpm s−1, 60 s) on to PEDOT:PSS treated substrate. Aluminum (100 nm thickness) was thermally evaporated on the substrates at a rate of 2.75 Å s−1 through a shadow mask to obtain the solar cell devices.
IV testing was carried out under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere using a Keithley 236, model 9160 interfaced with LabView software. The active area of the devices was 0.1 cm2. The active layer film thickness was measured using a Veeco Dektak VIII profilometer.


Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscopy (TMAFM). 
Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscopy (TMAFM) was carried out on the active area of the solar cell devices and on the area in between the channels of the OFET devices. AFM studies were carried out on a VEECO-dimension 5000 scanning probe microscope with a hybrid xyz head equipped with Nano-Scope Software. AFM images were obtained using silicon cantilevers with nominal spring constant of 42 N m−1 and nominal resonance frequency of 300 kHz (OTESPa). Image analysis software Nanoscope 7.30 was used for surface imaging and image analysis. All the AFM measurements were taken of the active area of solar cell devices and were conducted under ambient conditions. All cantilever oscillation amplitude was equal to ca. 375 mV, and all images were acquired at 2 Hz scan frequency. Sample scan area was 5 μm.

Three alternating donor–acceptor polymers have been synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization using (4,8-bis(3,3′,5′-trihexyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane)as the donor monomer. Equimolar quantities of (4,8-bis(3,3′,5′-trihexyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) were reacted with 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Scheme 1 and S1 in the ESI†) in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphene)palladium(0) catalyst. The synthesis of polymers P1, P2 and P3 is shown in Scheme 2. The SEC analysis was used to determine the molecular weights of the polymers. The estimated molecular weights had values ranging from 20000 g mol−1 to 28000 g mol−1 (Table 1).

The synthesized polymers had relatively broad polydispersity index (PDI) which are due to the non-living nature of the Stille coupling polymerization. Polymers P1, P2, and P3 had good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene. The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR and the 1H NMR spectra of the reported polymers are shown in (ESI†).
3.2. UV-Vis spectroscopy
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded for the polymers P1–P3 in chloroform solution and in thin films obtained by the drop-casting the chloroform solutions onto glass substrates (Table 1, Fig. S19 in ESI†). Polymers P2 and P3 showed two absorption maxima, one at 350 nm and the second one in the visible region (> 550 nm), whereas polymer P1 showed several absorption maxima bands, among which the most prominent bands with very high intensity are at ∼350 nm and ∼650 nm. The strong absorption peaks in the visible region (∼653 nm for polymer P1, ∼621 nm for polymer P2 and ∼615 nm for polymer P3) are due to the π–π* transition along the conjugated polymer backbone.17,32 The absorption maxima observed in the UV region (∼343 nm for polymer P1, ∼374 nm for polymer P2 and ∼368 nm for polymer P3) is due to the conjugation along the side chain of the benzodithiophene moiety. Both polymers P2 and P3 showed a red-shift (∼28 nm for polymer P2 and ∼13 nm for polymer P3) in absorption bands of polymer thin films compared to that of the solutions. However, polymer P1 did not show any red-shift in the absorption bands of the polymer thin films as compared to that of the solution. The absence of a red- shift was attributed to the fact that the polymer P1 has a rigid rod conformation both in solution and thin films.33,34 The red-shift in absorption maxima in thin films compared to that of the solution, for the polymer P2 and P3 indicated more structural organization and ordered packing which enhanced the aggregation of the polymer in thin films compared to that of the solution. The incorporation of thiophene spacer in between the donor and the acceptor in the polymers P2 and P3, may result in a less rigid and planar structure in solution due to the twisting of the polymer chain and this may be prevented in solid state resulting in ordered packing, enhanced conjugation and π-delocalization hence a red shift in thin films.35 The onset of absorption for the polymer P1 was 725 nm, for polymer P2 was 737 nm and for the polymer P3 was 750 nm corresponding to optical band gaps of 1.71 eV, 1.69 eV, and 1.65 eV, respectively.
The absorption coefficients of the polymers were determined by spin coating polymer solutions on glass substrates at different spin rates (1000 rpm, 800 rpm and 600 rpm) to obtain different film thicknesses. The absorption coefficients of these polymer films were calculated at the maximum absorption of the polymers. Table S1 in ESI† summarizes the absorption coefficients obtained for the polymers at different polymer film thicknesses. The absorbance coefficient for all the polymers decreased with the increasing the thickness of the polymer film.
3.3. Cyclic voltammetry
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry using Ag/Ag+ non-aqueous electrode as the reference electrode as well as using the photo-electron spectroscopy. For the cyclic voltammetric measurements the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the polymers were calculated by using the following equations: HOMO = − [Eox + 4.71] eV; LUMO = − [Ered + 4.71] eV, where the Eox and Ered are the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials respectively (Fig. S20, ESI†). The HOMO levels of the polymers measured from cyclic voltammetry and that from photoelectron spectroscopy showed similar trends (Table 1).
Polymer P1 had a HOMO level of −5.64 eV while polymer P3 had a HOMO energy level of −5.52 eV. By contrast, polymer P2 had a higher HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV. This was attributed to the incorporation of electron withdrawing fluorine substituents to the conjugated polymer backbone which decreased the HOMO level of polymers P1 and P3.15 Both polymers P2 and P3 have a 0.2 eV difference in their HOMO and LUMO values compared to that of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer P1 which was attributed to the more extended conjugation and the π-electron delocalization arising from the incorporation of thiophene spacer in between the donor and the acceptor moieties. All reported polymers have deep lying HOMO energy levels which are lower than the air oxidation threshold (ca. −5.27 eV) indicating good air stability.36,37 Moreover, due to the lower HOMO energy level of these polymers a higher VOC for BHJ could be potentially obtained.25
3.4. Thermogravimetric analysis
The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S21 in ESI†). The onset of decomposition temperature for all the three polymers P1, P2 and P3 is above 400 °C indicating good thermal stability.
3.5. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell studies
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated for the polymers P1, P2 and P3 in bulk heterojunction solar cell using PC71BM as the acceptor. The solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer: PC71BM/Ca/Al with a device area of 0.1 cm2 for the polymers P1, P2 and P3 and were tested under AM 1.5 AMG illuminations.
In order to maintain a constant active layer thickness for the solar cell devices of the polymers a total blend concentration of 15 mg mL−1 in chloroform was maintained and the polymer blend was spin-casted at a spin rate of 2000 rpm on ITO substrates that have been treated with PEDOT: PSS. The effect of PC71BM on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by varying the blend ratio of polymer: PC71BM from 1:1 to 1:4 (Table 2).

Polymer P2 with 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor unit gave the highest PCE of 2.96% (VOC = 0.91 V, FF = 0.42 and JSC = 7.90 mA cm−2) for the polymer: PC71BM 1:1 weight ratio. The PCE of polymer P2 decreased with increasing the PC71BM weight ratio and a decrease in the open circuit voltage (VOC) was also observed. The polymer P3 with 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor moiety gave a PCE of 2.67% (VOC = 0.90 V, FF = 0.37 and JSC = 8.03 mA cm−2) for the polymer:PC71BM 1:1 weight ratio. The short circuit current density (JSC) and the PCE of the polymer P3 decreased with the increase in PC71BM weight ratio. The polymer P1 gave a lower PCE of 1.19% for the weight ratio of polymer: PC71BM 1:1 (VOC = 0.96 V, FF = 0.39 and JSC = 3.20 mA cm−2). A similar trend was observed for polymer P1 as compared to polymers P2 and P3 upon increasing the PC71BM weight ratio. All polymers gave exceptionally high VOC which was attributed to the low lying HOMO levels of the polymers (HOMO < −5.2 eV) as the VOC is related to the energy difference between the HOMO the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor.25 The insertion of fluorine atom on the acceptor decreased the HOMO and the LUMO levels of the polymers P1 and P3 as compared to the polymer P2.
Although the deeper HOMO levels are beneficial for the VOC, due to the large band gap the excitons diffusion may be hindered and may also increase the charge recombination which in turn will decrease the short circuit current JSC of the device. This may be the reason for the lower JSC values and lower PCE measured for the polymer P1. It can be observed that the insertion of the thiophene spacer had a significant influence on solar cell performance. A two fold increase in JSC was observed for the polymers P2 and P3 as compared to polymer P1. This was attributed to the increased conjugation and enhanced absorption due to the thiophene spacer. However, the presence of fluorine had a negative effect on the device performance as polymer P3 had lower PCE as compared to P2.
We attempted to further optimize the BHJ performance by using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive for the polymer–PC71BM blend (Table 3, Fig. 1, S22, S23 and S24 in ESI†). This high boiling point solvent (DIO) can selectively dissolve fullerene components in the polymer blend and thereby can affect the morphology of the active layer.38 However, the effect of DIO as an additives on the solar cell device performance depends on the structure of the polymer and can either enhance39–41 or decrease11,42,43 the efficiency of the BHJ devices. For the polymers P1, P2 and P3 the DIO concentration was progressively increased from 1 to 5% v/v. The BHJ devices were fabricated with the same set of conditions used to obtain the highest PCEs for each polymer. For the polymer P1, addition of DIO had a detrimental effect on the JSC, fill factor as well as on VOC, thereby reducing the overall device performance (Table 3and S2 in ESI†). Previous work in our group has also shown that upon the addition of DIO as an additive decreased the device performance of the polymer(Table S5, S6 and Fig. S29 in ESI†).18 For the polymers P2 and P3 an optimal DIO concentration of 3% v/v was used to obtain an increase in the PCE of the BHJ devices. Polymer P2 gave the highest PCE of 3.52% with an impressive open circuit voltage of 1.03 V (FF = 0.48 and JSC = 7.04 mA cm−2) for 3% (v/v) DIO content (Table 3 and S3 in ESI†). A similar trend was observed for the polymer P3 in which the highest PCE of 2.93% was obtained with a VOC = 0.86 V, FF = 0.43 and a JSC = 7.72 mA cm−2 for 3% (v/v) DIO content (Table 3, S4 in ESI†). For polymers P2 and P3 the fill factor increased with increasing the DIO concentration which could be attributed to the fact that upon the addition of DIO the phase separation was improved which in turn enhanced the charge transport and decreased the recombination losses.

3.6. Tapping Mode Atomic Force Microscopy (TMAFM) analysis
To investigate the differences in the efficiencies of the reported polymers the morphology of the active layer of the BHJ devices were investigated using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM). It has been observed that smoother surface and a good phase separation are critical for good device performances as a smoother surface induces better contact with the electrode and the bicontinuous phase separation influence better charge transport and excitons dissociation.18,44 The polymers with thiophene spacers (P2 and P3) showed improved morphology with less surface roughness and better phase separation compared to the polymer P1, for which the PCBM and the polymer phase segregated and formed large domains. Presumably these larger domains may be PCBM (Fig. 2, S25 and S26 in ESI†). The active layer of the polymer P2 showed a very smooth surface with an rms of 1.15 nm and the polymer P3 had an rms of 1.22 nm. However, the active layer of polymer P1 had a much less smooth surface and had an rms of 1.46 nm. Thus, the smoother morphology of the active layer of P2 and P3 seemed to aid the charge transport resulting in a better device performance. However, the higher surface roughness and the aggregation observed in the active layer of the polymer P1 reflected in the poor device performance of the BHJ device.

TMAFM analysis was also performed for the solar cell devices of P1, P2, and P3 with 3% DIO additive. A comparison of the TMAFM images of P2/PC71BM blend with 0% and 3% DIO indicated that upon the addition of DIO a very smooth active layer morphology was obtained (polymer P2: rms = 0.877 nm) which improved the device performance. The surface roughness of the polymer P3 remained almost the same upon the addition of DIO which reflected in a very slight increase of PCE. However, for polymer P1 the addition of DIO increased the surface roughness (rms = 2.08 nm), which contributed to the poor device performance (Fig. 3, S27 and S28 in ESI†).

3.7. Space charge limited current studies
To investigate the vertical hole-carrier transport behaviour of the reported polymers, the space charge limited current (SCLC) model was employed using the following equation:  where J is the current density, ε0εr is the permittivity of the polymer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the active layer thickness.
A device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Al was employed and the mobilities were extracted in the SCLC region. The Fig. 4 shows the current density and voltage curves for the reported polymers. Polymer P2 showed the highest charge carrier mobility of 8.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer P3 had a charge carrier mobility of 4.54 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1, while polymer P1 had the lowest charge carrier mobility of 1.33 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These measured mobilities are consistent with the solar cell data, in which the highest PCE was obtained by the polymer P2 due to its larger short circuit current density.

4. Conclusion
Three new donor–acceptor copolymers P1, P2 and P3 were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization with bis(bithienyl)- substituted BDT as the donor and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the acceptor units, respectively. The polymers had comparable molecular weights (Mn ∼ 20000 g mol−1) and they had good solubility in common organic solvents. The insertion of the thiophene spacer between the donor and the acceptor units broadened the absorption spectrum of the polymers P2 and P3 as compared to polymer P1. Moreover, polymers P2 and P3 showed a larger red shift in the UV/vis spectrum indicating better solid state packing and improved the conjugation which was beneficial for the charge transport. The attachment of the fluorine atoms on the acceptor had an adverse effect on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, most likely because the electron withdrawing fluorine deepened the HOMO level of the polymer, which in turn increased the band gap of the polymer and consequently resulted in lower JSC in the BHJ solar cells. Polymer P2 had the highest charge carrier mobility of 8.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 as determined by SCLC method and gave the highest PCE of 3.52% in BHJ with PC71BM acceptor.
