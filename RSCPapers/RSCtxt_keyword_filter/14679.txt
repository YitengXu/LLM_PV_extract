    , Accepted 28th January 2021First published on 29th January 2021AbstractMesoscopic photovoltaic devices (MPDs) are significantly promising for sustainable light-harvesting through solid-state compact designs. Materials with multifunctional properties play a vital role in improving the processability, stability, and cost of such devices. Here, a single-route synthesized sensitizer and multifunctional organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) are introduced, and OIPCs are employed as a redox couple and light-harvesting contributor as a binary sensitizer-electrolyte system enabled via energy transfer in a photovoltaic device. Materials OIPC-I, OIPC-Br, and SK4 sensitizer possess a typical N-alkyl-phenoxazine (POZ)–N-alkyl-benzimidazole (BM)-type architecture, and OIPCs hold additional iodide and bromide anions at the quaternary nitrogen of BM. OIPCs show redox potential generated from anions corresponding to I−/I3− and Br−/Br3− as well as suitable molecular energy levels due to the POZ–BM donor–acceptor pathway, which results in a self-regenerative photovoltaic response in FTO/p-TiO2/OIPC/Pt configuration without any sensitizer. The SK4 sensitizer has suitable energy levels below the redox potential level of OIPCs, which are well regenerated by OIPCs during the photo-electricity generation in the photovoltaic device. Here, an OIPC–Br-based device with high photovoltage (0.98 (±0.02) V) and pronounced photocurrent from extra electrons gained through the POZ donor present in OIPC by the energy transfer mechanism shows 45% energy transfer towards the dye or TiO2. The OIPC-I based device demonstrated 43% (±3) higher efficiency compared to the conventional benzimidazolium-based electrolyte due to improved photocurrent and photovoltage. Single component OIPC-I based solid-state MPD devices show excellent ∼95% stability up to 5000 h, which is more than the OIPC–Br based device.
Introduction
Third-generation photovoltaic device research is in the versatile age to increase solar energy contribution in global energy consumption demand for the post-2020 era. Perovskite solar cells (PeSCs)1 lead the field surpassing dye-based mesoscopic photovoltaic devices (MPDs)2 in terms of efficiency, recording 25.2%.3 However, instability and inadequate reproducibility of 3D perovskite affected by humidity/heat factors and low performance of low dimensional/lead-free perovskite materials limit their commercialization. Hence, MPDs are still considered a promising way to harvest solar energy due to the freedom of their fabrication methods, stability, and environmental convenience compared to PeSCs.4 Progress in MPDs has become popular for hybrid device designs in storage devices,5–7 low-light indoor performance,8–11 hybrid material implementation,12,13 water-based approaches,14–16 optical shading technology17,18 and applications in IoT (Internet of Things)19 after the field limits itself with saturation searches on sensitizer/electrolytes. These smart ways utilize high-efficiency devices that provide many benefits for useful applications but have limited power conversion efficiency (PCE), which necessitates a new commercialization form. Recently, the Japanese company Ricoh launched world's first solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) modules to use indoor day light for IoT and charging purposes.20 There is an extensive demand for new material combinations of MPDs that can enable low-cost synthesis of materials, solid-state charge transporters involving multi-function properties, and single-component materials, avoiding additives and providing long-term stability in devices.
D–A′–π–A (donor–acceptor–spacer–acceptor)-based metal-free organic sensitizers are considered as most efficient to exhibit high PCE over 11–13% under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in solid-state MPDs.21,22 In addition to the art of dye molecule design, significant efforts have been made to improve the performance and stability through choosing an efficient electrolyte in liquid as well as solid DSSCs, i.e. it is possible to improve performance by the addition of ionic liquid type supporting moieties in conventional electrolytes23 and achieving high Voc results by replacing I3−/I− with Br3−/Br− redox couples.24,25 Moreover, through the polymer gel electrolytes (PEGs),23,26–28 ss-MPDs also integrated solid metal complex salts,29 solid organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs)30,31 and solid organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs)32–38 as well as solid organic ionic conductors (SOICs)39–42 to improve stability. HTMs require tedious, costly synthesis procedures and demonstrate lower performance in ss-DSSCs. Meanwhile, OIPCs are emerging materials in MPDs and PeSCs due to their facile synthesis procedures, high conductivity, thermal stability, elasticity, and application feasibility in liquid and solid photovoltaic devices.
The summaries of best-performing OIPCs reported in solid-state DSSCs with different dye and additive compositions in an electrolyte are provided in Fig. 1(a) and Table S1 (ESI†). At the beginning of this decade, MacFarlane et al. introduced a pyrrolidinium-based OIPC as an efficient solid-state electrolyte mediator combined with traditional I3−/I− composition with and without SiO2 additives, achieving 4.8–5.1% PCE.43,44 Further, considerable efforts have been made by Yan et al. in applying different OIPCs containing 5-azoniaspiro [4.4]nonane, pyrrolidinium, and imidazolium with varying alkyl chains and anions as plastic electrolyte mixtures to achieve 3.8–5.4% PCE, which also achieved high-temperature stable devices.45–47 Jang et al. reported the highest PCE of 7.8% in MPDs with an OIPC composition prepared from succinonitrile and imidazolium–benzimidazolium mixed ionic salts.48 The latest report by Officer et al. achieved 7.4% PCE using phosphonium-based OIPCs embedded in a SiO2 matrix.49 The aforementioned reported OIPCs are usually integrated with costly noble-metal-based dyes, and most of the compositions contain multiple components and supporting additives (see Table S1, ESI.†). Usually, these additives make electrolyte application difficult and increase the cost, hindering the scale-up of devices. It is worthwhile to implement additive-free single component OIPCs in MPDs. Recently, we introduced a low-cost phenoxazine (POZ)–benzimidazole (BM)-based single component OIPC, OIPC-I, as a hole transporter in PeSCs, achieving 15% PCE with excellent device stability.50

Here, we have introduced the similar phenoxazine-based OIPC materials OIPC-I and OIPC-Br (Fig. 1(b)) to achieve low-cost, stable, and efficient devices by utilizing their redox properties originating from iodide and bromide anions for the first time. The new dye molecule SK4 (Fig. 1(b)) was derived with a two-step annulation of the synthesis route of OIPCs to obtain an efficient D–A′–π–A metal-free sensitizer. Electrochemical and photophysical studies of materials were carried out to evaluate the alignment of energy levels between the OIPCs and SK4 sensitizer. Further, photovoltaic devices were fabricated to measure the photovoltaic response. A case study is examined here; OIPC-I performs as a light harvester due to visible photoabsorption and a self-regenerative redox mediation in a mesoscopic TiO2-based single-component device with a good photovoltaic response due to suitable energy level alignment. Hence, the multifunctionality of OIPCs as an electrolyte as well as a secondary light harvester was studied using incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and a control device was studied without sensitizer. TRPL study was performed to support the energy/charge transfer mechanism in the hybrid devices. Density functional theory (DFT) was used on binary molecules to study their molecular interactions and charge transfer. It was noted that the light-harvesting ability along with excellent ionic conductivity, ionic diffusion, and suitable redox potential of OIPC-I improved the SK4 dye performance by ∼43% (±3) compared to conventional electrolytes. The achieved photovoltaic performance was better than that of conventional phenoxazine-free benzimidazole electrolytes due to the photoresponsive current enhancement from the OIPCs.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, India, and were used without further purification. Transparent conducting glass (FTO, 12Ω) and Meltronix tape (25 μm) were used as the substrate and sealant, respectively, and were purchased from Solaronix, SA, Switzerland. 5-Formylfuran-2-ylboronicacid (97%), Pd(PPh3)4 (97%), 1–10 phenanthroline, cyanoacetic acid, TiO2 (P25), ethylcellulose (99%), alfa-terpineol (99%), titanium isopropoxide (97%), and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used as received without purification. Ethanol (KUC, India) was purified using the standard process.
Device fabrication
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was cleaned by sequential sonication in detergent, deionized water, and alcohol and was dried with a nitrogen gun. The buffer TiO2 layer was coated using titanium isopropoxide by spin-coating followed by sintering at 450 °C in air. A mesoporous TiO2 film (9 μm) was composed of nanoparticles doctor bladed on the pre-sintered TiO2 substrate using prepared titania paste consisting of TiO2 (P-25, anatase), ethylcellulose, and α-terpineol based on a reported method.51 The resultant film was again sintered at 450 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1, and after cooling at room temperature, the electrode was placed in 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 25 min at 50 °C, followed by heating at 450 °C for 25 min in air. During cooling to 70 °C, the TiO2 film was placed for sensitization in 5 × 10−4 M SK4 dye solution (methylene chloride) for 14 h in the dark. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating H2PtCl6 (50 mM in IPA: EtOH) on the FTO followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The dye-loaded TiO2 working electrode and Pt-coated counter electrode were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (25 μm) and were sealed by pressing them under heat. A solid electrolyte solution in acetonitrile (ACN) was injected into the interior space of the cell from the two predrilled holes on the counter electrode and dried out in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for at least 4–5 h to remove the solvent. The same process was repeated 3–4 times to ensure that the TiO2 porous film area was filled with a compact layer of OIPC material. The electrolyte compositions were prepared and named as follows: BMII/I2: 0.6 M BMII, 0.03 I2, 0.1 M 4-TBP. OIPC-I/I2: 0.6 M OIPC-I, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M 4-TBP. OIPC-I: single component. BMIBr/Br2: 0.6 M BMIBr, 0.03 M Br2, 0.5 M 4-TBP. OIPC-Br/Br2: 0.6 M OIPC-Br, 0.03 M Br2, 0.5 M TBP. OIPC-Br: single component. The reference liquid-state device was prepared with a conventional imidazolium-based electrolyte containing components of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.5 M 4-TBP, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile. The fabricated cells were stored in dark conditions to carry out the I–V, impedance and other photovoltaic measurements. It was confirmed that the active area of 0.25 cm2 was fixed firmly to all the devices.
Characterizations

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR instrument in DMSO-d6 as the solvent. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy from Shimadzu, Japan. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile was carried out using a three-electrode system in which a Pt disk, Pt wire, and non-aq. Ag/Ag+ served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, TBAPF6, as the supporting electrolyte at 25 mV s−1 in a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. Ag/Ag+ electrode was calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+). The redox potential of electrolyte was calculated using the Nernst equation method reported elsewhere52 and then converted from NHE (V) to vacuum (eV). The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluoromax 4P spectrophotometer. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements to determine the exciton lifetimes of the samples were recorded in a LifeSpec II Edinburgh instrument with a lamp frequency of 5 MHz. A neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used to excite the samples at a wavelength of 405 nm. Theoretical DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed in the Gaussian interface using the B3LYP 631G basis set.
The ionic conductivity and diffusion coefficient were studied from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements with OIPC sandwiched between two symmetrical Pt electrodes. The Nyquist plot measurements were collected by sweeping the frequency from 120 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV in Solartron 1260 + 1287 interfaces, and the data were analysed using CorrView and Zplot software (Scribner's Associates Inc.). The conductivity calculated from eqn (1) and the ionic diffusion were calculated using eqn (2),53 respectively. (1)where σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, Rs is the resistance of the electrolytes, l is the thickness between two symmetric electrodes and A is the active surface area of the electrode. Dn = L2/ω(2)where Dn is the diffusion coefficient, L is the thickness of the electrolyte and ω is the fitting value for the Ws element of the circuit model (ESI†).
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured using a Keithley 2450 digital source meter controlled by a computer scan rate of 10 mV s−1. A solar simulator (PET 80AAA, USA) 500 W Xenon lamp, connected with an AM 1.5 G filter to serve as the light source, gave 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the test cell to remove ultraviolet and infrared radiation. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was recorded using a Newport Oriel IQE-200, where a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp was used as the light source. The stability of the devices was monitored by measuring the I–V response using a Keithley 2450 source meter in the ambient environment in the presence of outdoor sunlight (0.8–1 sun). The devices were connected to the source meter during the measurements. For the rest of the time, the devices were disconnected from the source meter.

Results and discussion
The synthesis of SK4 sensitizer was carried out using a simple microwave-assisted two-step procedure in which the OIPC intermediate was carried forward from our earlier work. The molecular architecture of the newly designed D–A′–π–A sensitizer SK4 depicted in Fig. 1(b) and the corresponding synthesis route are facilitated in Scheme 1, which shows a single route product of sensitizer from the intermediate material carried forward from the OIPC synthesis route. Structural characterization of the SK4 sensitizer was carried out with 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR (ESI†) and mass spectroscopy.

It is well known that the tricyclic iso-ester of the hetero-anthracene molecule, POZ, shows superior electron donating ability, and a hexyl chain substituted on nitrogen provides enough solubility in various organic solvents.39 As shown in Fig. 1(b), SK4 dye relies on three simple building blocks, namely, hexyl-substituted donor moiety (POZ), benzimidazole (BM), an extended furan bridge (as a spacer) and cyano acrylic acid as an anchoring as well as an acceptor group. Here, -the CN part of the BM unit will work as an auxiliary pseudo-acceptor, which helps to drive the excited electrons towards the anchoring sites through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Here, the benzene and furan units improve the absorption span by providing π spacing. In the OIPCs, the substituted POZ acts as the donor and the quaternized nitrogen-bearing BM cation acts as an acceptor, similar to reported donor–acceptor ionic HTMs.54 UV-visible and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were performed to evaluate the probable photophysical requirements of the sensitizer and its energy levels to prove the facile energy level architecture for workable successive mechanisms in MPD. The UV-vis absorption spectra of SK4 sensitizer and OIPCs in dichloromethane solution are measured at a concentration of ca. 10−4 M, and the corresponding graphs and data are shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1.

It can be found that the sensitizer exhibits two distinct absorption bands, which are similar to those of a reported D–A′–π–A sensitizer,55,56 with optical absorption in the visible region between 350–630 nm with peaks at 391 and 455 nm corresponding to the π-π* transition and ICT from the donor to the acceptor side, respectively. Meanwhile, on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 2(b)), the redshift of the absorbance and a broadening of the spectra were observed as an indication of the facile plantation of SK4 sensitizer on the nano-granules through deprotonation. OIPCs also show strong absorbance in the range of 300–600 nm; here, the iodide anion-bearing moiety shows more redshift in the absorbance than the bromide anion-based OIPC. The solid absorbance of coated OIPCs on dye/TiO2 improves the overall absorbance capability of SK4 sensitizer through their absorbance ability as a secondary absorber. The broadening and significant redshift in solid absorbance compared to the solution may result from π–π stacking between close molecular arrangements in the solid state.53 The normalized PL in the liquid solutions suggests red-shifted PL between 500 to 750 nm with a peak at 613 nm (Fig. 2(a)). In contrast, the PL response of the OIPCs lies between 400–700 nm, with a peak at around 505 nm. This suggests that the subtle changes in the donor–acceptor-type energy transfer may be radiative or non-radiative.
To investigate the possibility of electron injection from the excited state of the organic dyes to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the regeneration of the dyes, the redox behavior of the sensitizer and OIPCs was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2(c)). For the SK4 molecule, the first oxidation versus vacuum was calibrated by Fc/Fc+, corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dye (−5.40 eV). It was found to be more positive than the redox potential values of I−/I3− (−4.80 eV) and Br−/Br3− (−5.12 eV), which indicates that the oxidized dyes can be regenerated effectively. The redox potential of OIPCs was estimated from the first two redox couples corresponding to mono and triiodide/bromide redox reactions vs. Ag/Ag+. The estimated excited-state potential of the dye that corresponds to the LUMO level is −3.15 eV, calculated from HOMO + Eg. The LUMO level of the dye is more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV). This reveals that the dye has sufficient driving force for electrons to transfer from an excited state to the TiO2 surface. The higher redox potential of Br−/Br3− will help to perform MPD with superior output voltage due to the higher difference between the redox potential and the Fermi level of the TiO2 band. Here, the LUMO value of the OIPCs is higher than the LUMO level of the SK4 sensitizer, and this suggests that OIPC-I and OIPC-Br can inject electrons into the LUMO of the dye and subsequently in the TiO2. The HOMO levels are equal to the sensitizer, and thus they can quickly regenerate by donating holes to the redox mediator (Fig. 2(d)).
The dye regeneration kinetics depends on the ionic conductivity, ionic diffusion, and appropriate redox potential of an electrolyte. It is worth noting that the ionic conductivities of OIPC-I and OIPC-Br were observed at 0.33 mS cm−1 and 0.22 mS cm−1, respectively.50 The significant conductivity observed in additive-free (I2, LiI, Br2, LiBr, etc.), POZ donor-substituted BM OIPCs may originate from the charge transfer along the closely packed iodides/bromides in the absence of iodine/bromine by a Grotthus-type mechanism.57 The ionic conductivity of these OIPCs is further improved up to 2.18 mS cm−1 and 1.42 mS cm−1 by the addition of I2 and Br2, respectively. This improvement is expected from the formation of a high tri-halide concentration.41 The diffusion coefficient was calculated from the Warburg impedance extracted from the impedance spectra measured between two symmetrical platinum electrodes53 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The ionic diffusion was found to be 3.2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 and 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for OIPC-I and OIPC-Br, respectively. The conductivity and ionic diffusion of OIPC-I are slightly higher than the OIPC-Br. This may be due to the higher diffusion of iodides/polyiodide anions compared to bromide/polybromide anions between the bulkier cations of OIPCs. It is worth mentioning that the superior hole mobility of these materials was already derived and studied in our earlier work, typically 1.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OIPC-I and OIPC-Br, respectively. However, materials can be fit in the MPD mechanism through a redox couple generated from the iodide and bromides, which will play the role of sensitizer regeneration. It appears that the set of OIPC and the new sensitizer SK4 are suitable for application in solid-state MPD devices.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the synthesized materials, the MPDs were fabricated for comparing the OIPCs-based solid-state electrolyte in the presence of I2/Br2 with additives and as a single component with SK4 dye. However, before beginning the study of the new materials, the J–V performance of SK4 dye was measured with imidazolium-based liquid electrolyte, a conventional known electrolyte, for better comparison, which shows 6.58% PCE (Fig. S2, ESI†). The prevalent benzimidazolium-based electrolyte BMII and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIBr) were used to fabricate reference solid-state devices without POZ substitution on the benzimidazole. The OIPC-I and OIPC-Br-based electrolytes were employed with the POZ substitution on benzimidazole. The performance of all the MPDs was tested under AM 1.5G irradiation (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). To prevent inflated photocurrents arising from stray light, a black metal mask surrounded the active area. The relevant measured J–V characteristics are given in Fig. 3(a–c) along with a detailed description of the electrolyte systems used and the corresponding photovoltaic data; the achieved short circuit current density (Jsc, mA cm−2), open circuit potential (Voc, V), fill factor (FF, %) and power conversion efficiency (η, %) are tabulated in Table 2. In solid-state MPD with electrolytes (BMII/I2, BMIBr/Br2), the SK4 dye performs with 4.66% (Jsc = 13.1 mA.cm−2, Voc = 0.67 V, FF = 53.4%) and 3.82% (Jsc = 8.0 mA.cm−2, Voc = 0.97, FF = 48.5%) PCEs, as depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. In the second set of devices, upon replacement of BMII/BMIBr with OIPC-I/OIPC-Br, the optimum increment in performance was observed through upgrades in the Jsc and Voc values, and the efficiencies reached 7.57% with OIPC-I/I2 and 5.38% with OIPC-Br/Br2, respectively. The efficiencies achieved here are very near to reports of various OIPC-based devices with the highest efficiency to date (ESI Table S1†).

The performance of bromide-containing OIPC-Br shows the highest performance in the category of devices reported in the solid-state with metal-free sensitizer (Table S2†). The visual difference in the voltage profile is due to the difference between the TiO2 CB (conduction band) and the redox potential value of redox mediators I3−/I− and Br3−/Br−, while the Br3−/Br−-based device achieved the superior voltage. Here, Jsc is dominant in the iodide-based device, which corresponds to higher diffusion of iodide ions compared to the bromide ions in bulk. Compared to the conventional electrolyte, an approximately ∼43% (±3) increment of efficiency was observed with these OIPCs. The significant contribution that arose from the Jsc enhancement is the contribution of the phenoxazine portion of OIPC as a secondary absorber by energy transfer and the function of the electrolyte. The improvement in Voc is affiliated with the decrement in the charge recombination from dye-TiO2 to the electrolyte in the presence of OIPCs. The solid-state devices of OIPCs as a single-component electrolyte without any additives also demonstrates good efficiency (Fig. 3(c)). Here, the superior performance of OIPC-I is related to its higher conductivity and the diffusion observed in the earlier study of electronic measurements.

Fig. 3(d) shows the IPCE spectra of the ss-MPDs of BMII/I2, and OIPC-I/I2 shows the photocurrent action spectra, of which the OIPC-I-based device showed ∼30% more current output along with a broad absorbance spectrum compared to the BMII/I2-based device. This reveals good agreement with the UV-vis performance of solid films, where the absorption width is broadened in the presence of OIPC-I. Further, to study the role of the secondary absorber and for the increment in the charge generation originating from the sensitizer, we have carried out time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the dye-sensitized photoanode (bare) and OIPC-I thin film coated on TiO2 + SK4 dye at a similar excitation wavelength of 405 nm (Fig. 3(e)) and the relevant extracted lifetime by bi-exponential fitting58 parameters are tabulated in Table S3†. As observed in this figure and the extracted data, the average exciton lifetimes <τ> = 0.652 ns and <τ> = 0.294 ns for the TiO2 + SK4 dye and TiO2 + SK4dye + OIPC-I, respectively. It is clearly revealed that the charge transfer rate from the dye to TiO2 is tremendously increased in the presence of OIPC materials. The higher electron density arises in the presence of OIPC-I from the molecular blend of the similar donor portion present in the SK4 sensitizer and OIPC-I electrolyte.59 Presumably, the fast electron injection in the case of TiO2 + SK4 + OIPC-I is suggesting energy transfer from OIPC-I to SK4 or TiO2, as observed in well-known P3HT/PCBM blends.60 The TRPL and IPCE measurement gives evidence of the electron injection contribution of OIPC as the dual character of a secondary absorber, which is functioning as a light harvester and as a dye regenerator within the system. The donor to acceptor energy transfer ηET (%) was found to be 44.8%, calculated from the TRPL parameters. However, it is difficult to estimate the absolute current contribution in this type of multi-functional mechanism, but the IPCE measurement of devices clearly indicates the quantitative improvement in current density from the phenoxazine donor present with the benzimidazole acceptor.
Additionally, to verify the dual function of the light-harvesting properties, the redox mediator of OIPC was employed in the control device with the structure of FTO/TiO2/OIPC-I + I2/Pt/FTO without using the primary light harvester SK4. The J–V curve and photovoltaic parameters are described in Fig. 3(f) and Table 2, which show the facile photogeneration and electrolytic characteristics of the OIPC-I molecule with I2. The device performed with 2.9 mA cm−2 current density with an overall PCE of 0.43%. As described in the photophysical properties, OIPC-I has a higher LUMO level than the SK4 sensitizer; thus, it can inject electrons into the TiO2 conduction band and survive self-reduction through the redox couple loop present due to iodide-triiodide. This observation confirms the donation of extra electrons in SK4 and TiO2 directly as a secondary light harvester.
Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies were carried out to understand the better structural properties and the relationships of two model molecules, SK4 and OIPC-I, for intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer Fig. 3(g) and (h). The presence of donor and acceptor parts in both molecules created polar interaction sites, which forced the molecules to arrange with each other in parallel fashion with structures as highly distorted as possible up to a distance of 3–4 Å in a vacuum due to tilted hexyl and butyl chains. The selected HOMO and LUMO Frontier orbitals of the optimized structures are shown in Fig. 3(h). We can see that charge transfer is possible between these molecules via the conjugation present in the whole moiety. The HOMO and HOMO-1 densities occupied the donor portion POZ of OIPC-I and iodide, respectively. For the LUMO levels in both cases, the charge densities shift on the dye molecules and support the secondary absorber phenomena.
To understand the resulting behavior of the voltage (Voc) and the charge transfer kinetics of ss-MPD, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurement61 was carried out in the dark. The Nyquist plots measured at 0.6 V and 0.9 V middle bias for the iodide and bromide-based devices are displayed in Fig. S3(a) and (b),† respectively, and the corresponding parameters extracted by fitting an equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. S3(a)†) are listed in Table 2. The first semicircle (Rpt) is assigned to charge resistance transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. In contrast, the second semicircle (Rrec) is accorded to charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which denotes back electron transfer resistive behavior from dye-TiO2 to the electrolyte.15 The last minor arc is related to Warburg impedance arising in the bulk of the electrolytes. The Rpt values of the OIPCs-based devices are greatly suppressed compared to those of the reference devices; this is assumed to be due to the better contact formation between the OIPC layer and platinum counter layer. It is also noticeable that the bromide-based OIPCs show higher charge transfer resistance, which can be assigned to the weak interaction of bromide compared to iodide-based bulky ionic solids. The Rrec value of the reference electrolyte (BMII/I2, BMIBr/Br2) is lower than the Rrec values in the OIPC-I/OIPC-Br based devices. This denotes the facile regeneration of the sensitizer in the presence of OIPCs and is directly related to the suppression of back electron transfer events from the dye-TiO2 to the electrolyte, which can suppress the destructive recombination for overall device performance. The corresponding electron lifetimes are 1.91 ms and 2.12 ms for BMII/I2 and OIPC-I/I2 and at 1.13 ms and 1.44 ms for BMIBr/I2 and OIPC-Br/Br2, respectively, calculated by the equation τr = Rrec × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance)62. The electron lifetime trend is in good accordance with the current density and Voc enhancement results of the photovoltaic data. The recombination resistance is exponentially dependent on the bias voltage, and it can be understood by eqn (3). Rrec = R0exp(−β(qVcorr)/KbT)(3)where R0 is a constant and β is the charge transfer coefficient, related to the sublinear recombination kinetics of the devices.63 To understand the transfer coefficient kinetics in our device, bias voltage-dependent EIS spectra were recorded in the dark. The recombination resistance and lifetime extracted from the EIS were plotted at different voltage ranges and exponentially fitted to utilize eqn (3) (Fig. 4(a–c)). The β value was found to be less than 1, which suggests that nonlinear recombination occurs in all the devices.64 Here, the higher conductivity and diffusion of OIPC-I dominate the OIPC-Br and transform the maximum kinetics in a fruitful direction for power conversion. However, both OIPCs play a better role in dye regeneration than the referenced benzimidazolium-based electrolyte systems. This suggests that in the presence of OIPCs, the SK4 dye performs with minimum charge recombination defects during the operation and suppresses the dark current, resulting in improvement in the voltage output.

(d) Power conversion efficiency stability of devices under ∼0.8–1 sun illumination for OIPC-I-based devices for 5000 h and OIPC-Br based devices for 2500 h. 
The stability of these solid devices is a prominent factor over other third-generation photovoltaic devices; hence, it is essential to understand the worthiness of newly designed materials. We have monitored the photovoltaic performance for a long-term test under real sun environment conditions at ∼0.8–1 sun illumination to check the stability in all three categories in ambient conditions (Fig. 4(d)). Usually, the solar spectrum also covers the UV portion of radiation, and it is supposed to damage the organic layers, which leads to deformation in the device performance. The exposure hours were cumulatively counted for each day exposure time and provided data for 5000 h in the OIPC-I set and 3000 h for the OIPC-Br set of devices. This method incorporates the aging factor of the devices along with the photoconversion stability. The additive-based devices showed nearly 70–80% decrement in the PCE due to loss in the current generation, which may align with damage of additives and cross interactions. Notably, single component-based devices have excellent stability, retaining an initial performance of ∼95% after long-term exposure.
Conclusions
According to the above discussion, a simple POZ-based efficient dye as a primary light-harvesting sensitizer and corresponding suitable organic ionic plastic crystals were successfully synthesized through a facile microwave-based single-step synthesis. The anion selectivity of iodide and bromide with the bulkier cation of POZ-substituted BM showed dual character both as a redox mediator and as a light harvester in a compilation with SK4 phenoxazine dye in ss-MPDs. An enhancement in voltage was observed in the bromide-based electrolytes over iodide. Moreover, the donor portion of the OIPCs, which absorbs UV-visible light in a similar region of the sensitizers, contributes to improving the overall current generation as a secondary absorber. This unique combination of dye and organic ionic plastic crystals results in ∼40–45% performance enhancement over conventional MPDs. Here, SK4 dye with the OIPC-Br/Br2 system shows 5.38% PCE at 1 sun illumination, which is the highest performance achieved to date in phenoxazine-based metal-free dye and bromide electrolyte-based MPDs assemblies. However, OIPC-I/I2-based devices exhibit a PCE of 7.57% in solid-state MPDs. It is studied that the device materials provide sufficient stability under real sunlight exposure for a long-term period. This unique design of photovoltaic device materials saves costs by eliminating multi-step complex synthesis and device structure complexity for future development.
