    , Accepted 6th April 2023First published on 6th April 2023AbstractCsPbI2Br perovskite films have a suitable band gap for the fabrication of tandem solar cells and excellent thermal stability. However, their halide phase separation and water instability lead to challenges for the practical industrialization of CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a molecule stapling strategy is demonstrated to assist the fabrication/stabilization of a high-quality large-area CsPbI2Br film by using a series of cesium perfluorodioate salts. According to density functional theory and experimental attempts, hexafluoroglutarate anions possessed a stronger interaction between chelated oxygen and surface Pb2+ ions due to the matchable stapling configuration, which effectively improved moisture tolerance, reduced defects and further improved the phase stability of the CsPbI2Br films. In the prepared high-quality CsPbI2Br films, the fabricated PSCs achieved 16.4% efficiency in a small area. The devices displayed high stability, retaining 92.9% of their initial efficiency for more than 400 h under 85 °C and N2 conditions and 91% of their initial efficiency for 300 h at a relative humidity of 30% without encapsulation. More importantly, this developed strategy can be employed for the production of large-area perovskite solar modules. A mini perovskite solar module with an efficiency up to 12.35% in a large area of 16 cm2 was successfully fabricated.
Introduction
With the rapid development in the successful production of metal-halide hybrid perovskite films and device configuration upgrades,1,2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a prospective candidate for next-generation low-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaics.3 However, the instability of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs still remains unsolved due to the volatility of their organic components (especially the CH3NH3+ organic component), which often cause degradation of devices under either air or thermal conditions.4–9 Replacing the organic cations with inorganic cesium ions (Cs+) can offer an inherently thermally stable perovskite phase over 400 °C with a tunable band gap between 1.73 eV for CsPbI3 and 2.25 eV for CsPbBr3 by using different halides.10–13 Among the above inorganic perovskites, CsPbI2Br perovskite14–18 is considered to be a good candidate for high-performance and robust all-inorganic devices due to its reasonable Goldschmidt tolerance factor and suitable band gap. Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI2Br devices is over 17%,19–22 but fabricating scalable, uniform and dense CsPbI2Br films and stabilizing them under moisture and light illumination are the main challenges for the improvement of the PV performance of the corresponding devices and their practicability.
Unfortunately, due to the moisture instability of the black-phase CsPbI2Br structure, the CsPbI2Br polycrystalline film easily transforms into a non-photoactive phase during the production procedure and reduces the corresponding PSC performance, especially under ambient air conditions. Various strategies to tackle this problem, such as crystallization regulation,23–26 interface/surface engineering,27–30 and mixed heterojunction structures,31,32 have been employed to fabricate high-quality CsPbI2Br films for high-performance PSCs. For example, Lewis bases, such as amino-functionalized polymers (PN4N)33 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)34 as interlayers, have been employed to not only improve the crystallinity of CsPbI2Br films but also interact strongly with Pb2+ ions from CsPbI2Br films to passivate the surface trap states. Among Lewis bases, oxoacid salts35–38 have been reported as novel dopants that can regulate perovskite film growth and enhance the overall stability by using multiple oxygen atoms interacting with uncoordinated Pb2+ ions to form strong Pb–O bonds. For example, lead(II) propionate39 used as an additive in the CsPbI2Br precursor certainly improved PSC environmental stability and showed a higher PCE of 14.58%, attributed to improved crystallinity and photoluminescence and defect passivation. In principle, a reliable and effective additive agent for perovskites can be achieved by tailoring uniform CsPbI2Br film growth and inhibiting water attack during the crystallization process. Among various bonding types, stapling coordination has a special bonding mode of polydentate molecules to metal ions and enhances the bonding ability compared to conventional monodentate additives. However, there is still a lack of a rational structure design method for effective perovskite coordination. Therefore, exploiting a facile strategy to produce and stabilize high-quality and robust inorganic CsPbI2Br films represents a tough challenge for highly efficient and ultra-stable inorganic PSCs toward potential large-scale fabrication.
Here, we report new additive engineering to use a series of cesium perfluorodioate salts as effective additives for inducing high-quality perovskite film crystallization and blocking water invasion, thus promoting the stabilization of highly stable CsPbI2Br films for photovoltaics. According to density functional theory and experimental trials, cesium hexafluoroglutarate (i.e., C5F6O4Cs2) was optimized and used to assist the formation of even and high-quality CsPbI2Br films and enrichingly stapled in grain boundaries and interfaces to coordinate the unsaturated Pb2+ ions. Multifluorine atoms can resist moisture attack and fix halide ions to suppress I/Br halide phase segregation. Consequently, together with excellent long-term moisture and thermal stabilities, the C5F6O4Cs2-based PSCs achieved a champion efficiency of 16.4%. Moreover, 16 cm2 area PSC modules based on molecular-stapling CsPbI2Br films having the best efficiency of over 12.35% were successfully constructed by blade coating.
Results and discussion
Molecule stapling-assisted growth of high-quality CsPbI2Br films
In this work, a stapling binding additive, cesium hexafluoroglutarate (i.e., C5F6O4Cs2), was added to the fabrication procedure of CsPbI2Br perovskite films via typical coating methods (such as spin coating or blade coating). C5F6O4Cs2 was produced by the reaction of hexafluoroglutaric acid with CsOH and further purification. In particular, an optimized amount of C5F6O4Cs2 powder was mixed into the CsPbI2Br solution and then involved in the production of CsPbI2Br films by solvent evaporation, as shown in the ESI.† As proposed in Fig. 1a, due to the strong chelation of C5F6O4Cs2 with Pb2+ ions,40,41 C5F6O4Cs2 was introduced into the perovskite precursor to regulate the growth of perovskite films by retarding film crystallization. As shown in Fig. 1b, c and S1,† the C5F6O4Cs2-stapled CsPbI2Br film (denoted as Cs-HFG) showed a dense and more even surface morphology compared with the control film. The F and O element mapping of EDS analysis confirmed the uniform distribution of C5F6O42− ions on the perovskite film's bulk phase and surface (Fig. S1 and 2†). As seen in the XRD patterns, the intensities of the [100] and [200] oriented peaks of the Cs-HFG film were obviously increased compared to those of the control sample (Fig. 1d). PL and UV-vis spectra (Fig. 1e and f) indicated that C5F6O4Cs2 stapling effectively improved the crystallinity and quality of CsPbI2Br films, indicating largely decreased non-radiative recombination defects. Based on the XRD patterns and PL and UV-vis spectra, the C5F6O4Cs2 addition content was optimized to be 1.5 mg mL−1 for the precursor solution during film fabrication (Fig. S3–5†).

To verify the rationality of the stapling molecule design, we designed and synthesized a series of cesium perfluorodioates, including cesium tetrafluorosuccinate (C4F4O4Cs2, TFS), cesium hexafluoroglutarate (C5F6O4Cs2, HFG) and cesium octafluorohexanedioate (C6F8O4Cs2, OFA), to be introduced into the perovskite films by the same process as for Cs-HFG films. As seen in Fig. S6,† the decomposition temperatures of all cesium perfluorodioates exceed 200 °C, indicating excellent thermal stability. We used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the adsorption energies (ΔEad) of perfluorodioate anions onto the perovskite surface. For simplification, the α-phase CsPbI3 structure was used as a paradigm, and the computational details are also given in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1g, S7 and Table S1,† the results show that HFG can be adsorbed strongly on the perovskite surface with a maximum adsorption energy (−8.76 eV), while TFS and OFA on the surface possess weaker absorption energies (−7.15 eV and −5.96 eV, respectively). In addition, the optimized structures of these perfluorodioate salts show that the molecular radial length of HFG is 6.28 Å, which is basically matched with that of Br–Pb–Br (∼6.0 Å)42 to I–Pb–I (∼6.2 Å),43 of the length of the CsPbI2Br unit cell, while those of TFS and OFA are 5.11 Å and 7.73 Å, respectively. Combined with the above results, these results suggest that size matching before absorption may also be an important reason for the stability enhancement of the CsPbI2Br film with HFG. As shown in Fig. S8 and 9,† all cesium perfluorodioates could evidently ameliorate the film quality and PL intensity of the CsPbI2Br films when compared with the control film. These results underlined the fact that dicarboxylate anions are ideal candidates for crystallization and defect passivation in CsPbI2Br perovskites.
Molecule stapling improved CsPbI2Br-based photovoltaic performance
Benefiting from the improvement, we used the configuration of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to fabricate regular PSCs (Fig. S10†). A high PCE of 16.43% in the RS mode with a high Voc of 1.30 V, a high FF of 74.83% and a Jsc of 16.89 mA cm−2 was readily obtained in the Cs-HFG cells, which obviously exceeded that of the best-performance control sample possessing an efficiency of RS 11.36% with a lower FF of 62.93%, Jsc of 15.17 mA cm−2 and Voc of 1.19 V under AM 1.5 G illumination, as shown in Fig. 2a. For the FS mode, a much higher efficiency of 16.31% was realized in the Cs-HFG device than 9.77% in the control device. Integrated currents sourced from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum data were 15.93 and 13.99 mA cm−2 for Cs-HFG and control devices, respectively, which are in accordance with their results of J–V measurements (mismatch by approximately 2.4%) (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the Cs-HFG devices presented average PCEs of RS 15.87% and FS 15.63% with a narrower distribution, in comparison with control PSCs (RS 10.45% and 9.01%) (Table S2†), indicating the superior repeatability of the Cs-HFG devices (Fig. 2c).

(f) Operation stability of control and Cs-HFG devices under LED light irradiation in a N2 atmosphere. 
As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S3,† the efficiencies of all devices with different C5F6O4Cs2 concentrations were promoted compared with that of the control sample. The optimized amount of C5F6O4Cs2 for additive engineering was demonstrated to be 1.5 mg mL−1, which is consistent with the above PL and XRD analysis results. Moreover, the PSCs treated with TFS (RS 15.07%) or OFA (RS 15.19%) salts also displayed improved PV performance (Fig. S12 and Table S4†). Here, the stabilized operating PCE of the Cs-HFG device was found to be 16.28% at the maximum power point (MPP) tracking for approximately 400 s (Fig. 2d), proving its better performance than that of the control device (10.80%). Under 25 °C and 30% RH storage conditions (Fig. 2e), the unencapsulated Cs-HFG devices had a significant increase in stability and maintained 91.0% of their original efficiency after 300 h, while that of the control sample dropped to 33.0% of its original value, which should have been attributed to the hydrophobicity of the multifluorine atoms from the C5F6O42− ion and further confirmed by the water contact angle of 57.8° increasing from 40.2° in the control film (Fig. S13†). Meanwhile, as seen in Fig. 2f, the Cs-HFG PSCs showed markedly improved light stability and maintained 91.8% of their original PCE, while for control devices, it rapidly dropped to 36% of their original efficiency after 500 h under AM 1.5G illumination in a N2 atmosphere. These results suggested that C5F6O42− stapling effectively improved the performance of CsPbI2Br-based PSCs.
Reducing CsPbI2Br defects by strong interaction between C5F6O42− and CsPbI2Br
To further study the regulatory mechanisms of molecular stapling, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to examine the detailed chemical states in the Cs-HFG films. Compared to the control film, the binding energies of the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks for the Cs-HFG film increased (Fig. S14†). The peaks of C 1s, F 1s, and O 1s in the Cs-HFG film confirm the existence of the C5F6O42− ion and the new chemical bond of Pb–O on the perovskite film (Fig. 3a and S15†). We concluded that C5F6O42− could not be doped into the perovskite lattice but reorganized on the perovskite surface and boundaries by strongly interacting with Pb2+ ions. To further elucidate the stapling interaction of C5F6O42− with the perovskite films, we used Raman spectroscopy to detect the Pb–O bond (Fig. 3b). The feature peak of perovskite is broad at approximately 100 cm−1. Interestingly, a new peak at 149 cm−1 emerged, which can be ascribed to the Pb–O bond that was derived from C5F6O42− interacting with the Pb2+ ion, consistent with previous research work.44

(f) EIS characteristics of the champion PSCs with control and Cs-HFG films measured at 0 V bias under dark conditions. 
To reflect the surface valence band level, the XPS valence band spectra were studied, as shown in Fig. 3c. The maximum valence band (VBM) of the Cs-HFG film is 1.05 eV which is higher than that of the control sample (0.95 eV), and would promote an increase in Voc for the Cs-HFG device. As seen in Fig. 3d, the built-in potentials (Vbi) in both cells are also assessed by Mott–Schottky analysis, which plots C2−versus V. The extracted Vbi increased from 1.05 V in the control sample to 1.17 V in the Cs-HFG cell. A ΔVbi of 120 mV should help increase the Voc and FF of the Cs-HFG cells. As characterized by the time-resolved PL spectra (Fig. S16†), a longer decay time of 360 ns in the Cs-HFG film than 140 ns in the control film revealed that nonradiative recombination was effectively decreased by molecular stapling. The dark leakage current was significantly reduced in the Cs-HFG device under dark conditions (Fig. 3e). The Nyquist plots for the PSCs based on control and Cs-HFG films were measured at 0 V bias under dark conditions. The recombination resistance Rrec derived from the low frequency region increased from 1.14 × 104 to 2.06 × 105 Ω after C5F6O42− passivation (Fig. 3f). The lower transfer resistance and higher recombination resistance in the Cs-HFG cell also confirmed better carrier extraction and less nonradiative recombination. The above results demonstrated that molecule stapling not only reduced the trap state density of CsPbI2Br films but also accelerated interfacial charge transfer, which was beneficial for scalable and reproducible fabrication of modules. Compared to the control film, the FTIR spectra of the Cs-HFG film obviously showed three peaks belonging to the –COO and –CF2 groups, which further confirmed the presence of C5F6O42− ions in the solid CsPbI2Br films (Fig. S17†).
Moreover, in accelerated moisture-aging experiments (20 °C and RH 70%), the Cs-HFG film still retained the black phase of perovskite, in contrast with the colorless phase of the control film over 4 min, which indicated that C5F6O42− effectively stabilized the CsPbI2Br film (Fig. S18†). As shown in Fig. S19,† the intensities of the (100) and (200) XRD peaks of black-phase CsPbI2Br became slightly weakened in the Cs-HFG film, and only a small amount of the δ phase emerged, in contrast to the black phase in the control film, which mostly degraded to the δ phase over 3 min, which was consistent with the above results of device moisture stability. Halide phase separation has been certified to be a possible origin of CsPbI2Br cell intrinsic degradation in continuous operation, which can be detected by PL spectra under AM 1.5G illumination. As seen in Fig. S20,† the PL peak of the control film had a redshift of approximately 9 nm, while in the Cs-HFG film, the PL peak had no obvious change under continuous light illumination for 50 min, suggesting that C5F6O42− effectively suppressed I− or Br− migration in halide separation to promote performance enhancement. Encouraged by the robust stability of the Cs-HFG film, we further used P3HT as the HTL to test the thermal stability of CsPbI2Br devices, and the increased PCE of the target device was RS 14.57% compared to the RS 9.38% PCE of the control device (Fig. 4a and Table S5†). At 85 °C and in a N2 atmosphere, the Cs-HFG device retained 92.9% of its original PCE value, while that of the control device rapidly dropped to 65.0% of its initial PCE value for 400 h (Fig. 4b). Based on the above results, such an improvement will be helpful for enhancing the stability of CsPbI2Br films in PSC modules.

Large-area modules based on Cs-HFG films by blade coating
In addition to the photovoltaic performance, another issue for the future commercialization of CsPbI2Br-based PSCs is their large-scale modules. With this motivation, the stapling engineering developed in this work was extended to fabricate large-area perovskite films and then fabricate inorganic PSC modules in the configuration FTO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.45 A schematic illustration of the fabrication process by blade coating and post annealing is shown in Fig. S21.† The mini module has four subcells and an overall size of 4 × 4 cm2 (16 cm2) (Fig. 4c and d), and the optimized laser-patterning lines were described in previous studies.46,47 As shown in Fig. 4e, the 8 cm2-active-area Cs-HFG module exhibited a Jsc of 3.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 4.49 V, and a high FF of 72.01%, giving a PCE of RS 12.35%, which is one of the highest PCEs among those of the reported inorganic Cs-based PSC modules by blade or spin coating methods (Table S6†). In the FS scan, an efficiency of 12.07% with a Jsc of 3.76 mA cm−2, a Voc of 4.52 V, and an FF of 71.03% was achieved (Table S7†). Moreover, the excellent reproducibility in the (RS 11.7 ± 0.5%, FS 11.4 ± 0.6%) efficiencies of 15 modules was verified (Fig. 4f). This stapling passivation strategy shows the great potential of additive engineering for the production of stable and large-area all-inorganic perovskite solar modules.
Conclusions
In summary, a molecule stapling strategy of effective additives for CsPbI2Br polycrystalline films was proposed and successfully implemented by assisting the fabrication of high-quality CsPbI2Br films using cesium perfluorodioate salts. It was experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that due to the strong stapling interaction between dicarbonate and Pb2+ ions, moisture invasion was effectively inhibited by fluorine groups, thus improving phase stability and suppressing halide segregation in CsPbI2Br films. Consequently, equipped with cesium hexafluoroglutarate, the corresponding devices favourably achieved the champion efficiency of 16.4% with less hysteresis and excellent stabilities. Moreover, the blade-coated large-area PSC modules based on molecule-stapling CsPbI2Br films were successfully produced and had a champion efficiency over 12.35% on 16 cm2 of total area with high reproducibility. This stapling binding strategy for additive engineering of scalable inorganic perovskite films will help promote the commercialization of stable perovskite modules.
