1. Introduction
To adapt to the changes in the environment, biological systems have optimized their complex structure and properties through billions of years of evolution and natural selection.1 Previous studies have identified that the formation of highly ordered natural biological materials like nacre and bone is controlled accurately by biological systems,2–4 which is hard to duplicate through large-scale manufacturing techniques. With nearly 60 years of experimental and theoretical studies on the structure and formation mechanisms of some natural materials, a lot of knowledge on biomimetism and bioinspiration as tools for the design and synthesis of artificial materials has been achieved.5–8
Bioinspired synthesis provides an alternative strategy to produce functional bionanomaterials, whose structure, properties and functions mimic those of natural materials or living matter.2,9 For example, microscopic studies on some organic matter like the tokay gecko foot,10 lotus leaf,11Morpho-butterfly,12 cicada wing,13 and O. wendtii brittlestar14 indicated that these biological systems have developed various strategies to achieve advantageous unification between structure and bulk properties. With deep investigations on the synthesis mechanisms, structures, and properties of various bioinspired nanomaterials, it has been found that many kinds of biomolecules, such as DNA, proteins, peptides, viruses, enzymes, and others, could be crucial as building blocks to mediate or promote the bioinspired synthesis of functional nanomaterials.15–19
Compared to traditional chemical synthesis, biomimetic or bioinspired synthesis reveals a few advantages. Firstly, the reaction conditions are much milder (usually at ambient temperature) than those used in traditional material-processing techniques. Secondly, the size, shape, chemistry, and crystal structure of bioinspired nanomaterials can be exquisitely controlled. Thirdly, biomolecules provide great potential for producing materials with highly specific and multiple functions. Fourthly, nature provides a large number of biomolecules that can be used for the biomimetic synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials. Most importantly, biomolecules may provide unique properties of bottom-up self-assembly and molecular recognition,20–22 which play important roles in tailoring the structures and functions of bioinspired materials.
Biomolecular self-assembly provides a potential way to form highly ordered biomaterials from zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) structures,16,18,23,24 in which the self-assembly formation of materials is mediated by various molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and π–π interactions. In addition, biomolecules exhibited unique abilities to inspire the formation of hybrid bionanomaterials with improved functions through several bioinspired synthesis strategies, such as molecule–molecule interaction,25 molecule–material recognition,26 molecule-mediated nucleation,27 and molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation.28 Therefore, further understanding of biomolecular self-assembly for inspiring the formation and assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) can promote the design and fabrication of functional nanomaterials. Various self-assembled biomolecular superstructure-inspired nanomaterials have been fabricated and utilized for applications in biomedicine,29 tissue engineering,30 sensors,31 nanodevices,32 optical materials,33 energy storage,34 environmental monitoring,35 and others.
Previously, several important review papers on the structure, formation mechanisms, and applications of bioinspired materials have been published.36–41 For example, Xia et al. provided a comprehensive overview of synthetic methods towards bioinspired smart interfacial materials.37 Chen and co-workers illustrated the functional adaptations and structural designs of bioinspired materials through many examples.38 Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the developments in the fabrication of nano/micro-scale bioinspired hybrid materials, especially nacre- and bone-inspired structural materials.41 However, there are still a lot of gaps in this interesting and growing research field. In particular, the biomolecular self-assembly-bioinspired synthesis of functional nanomaterials and their energy and environmental applications should be introduced and discussed with a comprehensive study.
In this review paper, we focus on recent advances in bioinspired synthesis and applications of hierarchical nanomaterials based on biomolecular self-assembly, and the main contents are shown in Fig. 1. In part 2, we first discuss biomolecular self-assembly towards biological nanomaterials, in which the mechanisms and ways of biomolecular self-assembly as well as various self-assembled biomolecular nanostructures are demonstrated. Then the main bioinspired synthesis strategies (part 3), including molecule–molecule interaction, molecule–material recognition, molecule-mediated nucleation and growth, and molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation, are introduced and discussed. In addition, a lot of examples and discussions on how biomolecular self-assembly inspires the formation of hybrid nanomaterials are presented. After that, we demonstrate recent applications of molecular self-assembly inspired nanomaterials in energy (biofuel cells, light-harvesting materials, supercapacitors, batteries, catalysts) and environmental (water/air purification and environmental monitoring) research in parts 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, current challenges and future outlooks towards bioinspired materials are discussed in part 6. We believe that this review will be very helpful for readers and researchers to understand the self-assembly of biomolecules and the biomimetic/bioinspired strategies for synthesizing functional bionanomaterials on the one hand, and on the other hand to design novel materials for extended applications in nanotechnology, materials science, analytical science, and biomedical engineering.

2. Biomolecular self-assembly towards hierarchical nanomaterials
Biological nanomaterials based on the self-assembly of biomolecules have exhibited wide applications from nanotechnology to biomedical engineering due to their unique properties such as controllable self-assembly, good biocompatibility, high thermal stability and flexibility, easy functionality, and facile synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that different biomolecules, such as proteins, peptides, DNA, viruses, and others, were used to self-assemble into various nanostructures including 0D nanoclusters/NPs, 1D nanofibers/nanotubes, 2D nanosheets/films/membranes, and 3D hydrogels.16,17,42,43 In this part, we would like to demonstrate various biological nanostructures prepared via biomolecular self-assembly by presenting basic self-assembly mechanisms and strategies of biomolecules.
2.1. Protein self-assembly
Protein is one of the basic and important biomolecules in all areas of biology, which plays major roles in the process of functions and activities in living organisms. Importantly, the self-assembly function of proteins also plays key roles in biological systems including gene delivery, tissue regeneration, molecular recognition, and others. Over the past decades, various self-assembled protein supramolecular nanostructures from 0D to 3D have been reported.44–46
0D protein biomaterials, including NPs, nanospheres, and rings, are one type of the basic structures for protein self-assembly. For example, Piccinini et al. presented colloidal bio-NPs by the self-assembly of concanavalin A lectin and GOx by recognition-driving and the colloidal bio-NPs exhibited a great catalytic activity for glucose detection.47 Recently, Indelicato and co-workers have designed novel protein NPs by using a single protein building block via the formation of specific clusters.48 In their work, proteins were presented in a linked helical structure and then designed into trimeric and pentameric coiled coils, respectively. Subsequently, these units were multiple copied and self-assembled into 0D protein NPs (Fig. 2a).

Yin et al. fabricated protein nanofibers by using relatively hydrophilic domains of silk fibroin (SF) with the “bottom-up” method.49 Helbing et al. even produced hybrid protein nanofibers composed of human hemoglobin (HGB) and human serum albumin (HSA) proteins by a co-assembly method.50 In this case, both protein solutions were mixed and reacted to form nanofibers in ethanol/water solution, which was driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The protofibrils were grown into hybrid protein nanofiber and ribbon structures and finally formed twisted hybrid nanofibers with the increase in self-assembly time (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, protein nanowires via a metal-coordination strategy can also be obtained. For example, the protein glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum (SjGST) with two N-terminal His-tags that can bind with Ni+ revealed the ability to self-assemble into protein nanowires.51
Metal-directed self-assembly can promote the formation of self-assembled 2D biomaterials. For example, Qiao et al. fabricated a 2D wavy structure by the self-assembly of a V-shaped SMAC protein through metal coordination.52 Zn2+ prefers to bind with the BH1 motif when the bis-histidine motifs are unsaturated and therefore the way of protein self-assembly depended on the interactions between unsaturated bis-histidine motifs with Zn2+. The V-shaped protein first self-assembled into nanowires and then grew into a bunch structure due to the BH2–Zn–BH2 interactions with the addition of Zn2+, and finally grew into a 2D wavy nanostructure, as shown in Fig. 2c (up pathway). However, the protein can self-assemble in two directions with Zn2+ saturation and form 2D wavy protein biomaterials in one step (down pathway). In another study, Suzuki and co-workers found that the metal-mediated assembly of C4-symmetric L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (RhuA) could assemble into the lattice by metal-mediated interaction.53 Knowles et al. designed nanostructure films from amyloid protein fibrils in a two-step process.54 Firstly, the protein molecules self-assembled into elongated fibrils under optimal conditions. Secondly, the fibrils were casted into thin films and resulted in nanostructured protein films.
In addition, Kong et al. designed protein hydrogels based on protein fragment reconstitution.55 Liljeström and co-workers designed 3D protein crystals via electrostatic interactions by two methods,56 as shown in Fig. 2d. In the first method, the biotin-functionalized unit was firstly interacted with avidin to form the biotin–avidin complex due to the well-known molecular recognition reaction, and then the negatively charged cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and the positively charged biotin–avidin complex were mixed and assembled into 3D crystals in a strong ionic strength solution via electrostatic interaction. In the other method, CCMV was firstly self-assembled with avidin into 3D CCMV–avidin crystals, and then the biotin-functionalized unit was added to modify the CCMV–avidin complex via the avidin–biotin interaction.
2.2. Peptide self-assembly
Self-assembled peptide nanostructures have been considered to be ideal biomaterials for various biological applications, such as drug delivery, cell imaging, biomimetic mineralization, and tissue engineering. Lots of self-assembled peptide nanostructures including nanospheres, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanosheets, and hydrogels have been exploited.16,57–59 For instance, in a recent topical review, Guler and co-workers presented the design, synthesis, characterization, and applications of functional peptide nanostructures and nanomaterials via biomolecular self-assembly.58
Abaci et al. prepared diphenylalaninamid (FFA) peptide NPs through the FF derivatives crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA).60 The prepared FFA solution in HFIP self-assembled into NPs after GA was added for overnight reaction at room temperature. The morphological characterization of FFA NPs indicated that the formed PNPs show uniform spherical structures with diameters of 448 and 460 nm, respectively. Sun and co-workers used a pH-sensitive method to produce peptide NPs by the self-assembly of cyclic peptides.61 Two methods were used to form peptide NPs with different diameters. It is interesting to note that the cyclic peptide could form peptide nanofibers and nanotubes by increasing the pH of the solution with the same methods.
Peptide nanofibers and nanotubes are typical structures formed during biomolecular self-assembly in solution, on substrates, and in the air–water interface. Zhao and co-workers fabricated peptide nanofibrils and nanotubes by controlling the self-assembly of I4K2 and KI4K peptides, respectively.62 In the case of I4K2, the peptide self-assembled into nanofibrils in water due to the hydrophobic interaction limited the stacking of β-sheets in width and formed twisted nanofibrils, as shown in Fig. 3a. However, for KI4K, the lateral stacking and twisting of the β-sheet were caused by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions; due to their electrostatic repulsion, the interaction has little influence on the self-assembly of KI4K. Therefore, the peptide was finally transformed into nanotubes with large diameters (Fig. 3b).

Peptide nanobelts and nanosheets can also be produced through peptide self-assembly.63–65 Ling et al. constructed 2D peptide nanosheets by the self-assembly of a designed PA, F6C11.66 In their work, the peptide was firstly dissolved in HFIP solution to break the hydrogen bond and then the peptide solution was added into PBS, and then peptide nanosheets were formed via hydrogen bonds and aromatic interaction-induced molecular self-assembly in X- and Y-axial directions, respectively. In another case, Lee and co-workers fabricated water-floating giant nanosheets at the air–water interface by using a peptide (YFCFY) folding into a helical structure via self-assembly.67 The peptide solution was heated at 80 °C to promote the oxidative reaction and form the YFCFY dimer, and then the peptide solution was dropped onto a glass substrate after the incubation to induce the formation of giant sheets in the air–water interface.
Recently, various 3D hydrogels through peptide self-assembly have drawn great attention due to their potential applications in drug delivery and protein release, tissue engineering, and biosensing.68–70 For example, two different charged peptides were used to self-assemble into positively-charged and negatively-charged peptide network gels for protein release.70 Xing and co-workers designed injectable peptide hydrogels by self-assembling two peptides with different charges.71 In another case, Motamed et al. fabricated a peptide hydrogel by using the helices of N-acetylated-β3-tripeptides functionalized with a hydrophobic acyl chain,72 which can self-assemble into nanofibers in solution and finally form the hydrogel when the peptide concentration is 7.5 mg mL−1.
2.3. DNA and RNA self-assembly
DNA-based nanostructures that serve as potential building block materials have attracted large attention due to their various applications in biosensing, biomedicine and nanotechnology.73–75 Self-assembled DNA nanostructures can also be classified into four types, namely 0D NPs, 1D wires/nanotubes, 2D films/arrays, and 3D hydrogels.
For example, He et al. prepared DNA NPs through a novel strategy,74 in which only one target DNA was used to self-assemble into NPs through multiple catalyzed hairpin assembly reactions and sticky end self-assembly. It can be found from the obtained AFM results that uniform and highly dispersed DNA NPs with a diameter of 200–500 nm were produced. In addition, the formed DNA NPs were used to colorimetrically detect nucleic acids and exhibited superior sensitivity.
DNA hybridization-based self-assembly could be utilized to synthesize 1D DNA nanostructures. Mohammed et al. used DNA origami seeds to prepare DNA nanotubes by DNA self-assembly.76 In their experiment, DAE-E tiles were firstly assembled at a temperature of 45–65 °C. Secondly, DNA nanotubes were formed by the hybridization of the sticky ends of tiles at a lower reaction temperature (30–40 °C), as shown in Fig. 4a. In another case, Maier and co-workers designed microscale helical DNA nanotubes with controllable helical diameters from nm to a few μm.77

2D DNA arrays have attracted large attention for their specific structure to serve as templates to fabricate functional nanomaterials for various applications.78 For instance, recently, Subudhi's group have designed and synthesized 2D branched DNA (bDNA) lattices by controlling the self-assembly of Y-shaped bDNA on Al foil.79 It was found that Y-shaped bDNA cannot self-assemble in aqueous solution; however it was easily assembled on the Al foil surface in the absence of ligase, as shown in Fig. 4b. In other cases, LaBean et al. constructed DNA arrays for guiding the self-assembly of proteins on the surface of DNA arrays.80,81
DNA hydrogels can be divided into two types, pure and hybrid hydrogels. In this section, pure hydrogels prepared by DNA self-assembly without adding other building blocks are demonstrated. For example, Cheng et al. prepared a DNA hydrogel with three 37-mer DNA strands, which was triggered by the pH change from 8 to 5.82 In another study, Zhang and co-workers prepared an aptamer-functionalized pure DNA hydrogel for target-responsive protein detection.83 The pure DNA hydrogel was constructed by using Y-shaped DNA and an aptamer linker through the DNA self-assembly method.
Besides DNA, RNA molecules can also be used to fabricate various nanostructures (triangles, squares, nanotubes, lattices, hexamers, and 3D cubes) by bottom-up self-assembly because RNA can form a variety of distinct base pairs having at least two hydrogen bonds, which can form a large number of building blocks for the preparation of multifunctional nanomaterials.84–86 It is well known that RNA self-assembly is highly related to intra- and inter-RNA interaction, and therefore understanding the self-assembly mechanisms of RNA molecules is crucial for designing and synthesizing functional RNA nanostructures.87 Recently, Van Treeck et al. have provided experimental evidence that RNA–RNA interactions could contribute to the assembly of stress granules, and found that pathogenic dipeptides increased the propensity of RNA to assemble.88 Li et al. demonstrated the precise control on the self-assembly of RNA tetrahedra, which exhibited potential applications in targeted cancer diagnostics.85 In another study, Boerneke et al. presented the crystal-structure-guided design of RNA molecules and the controllable self-assembly towards RNA nanotriangles.86
2.4. Enzyme self-assembly
Enzyme, one type of highly active protein, has been often immobilized on an electrode surface by self-assembly for biosensor applications.89–91 In general, enzymes can be conjugated to the surface of materials via noncovalent and covalent binding.92–94 Lai et al. fabricated an electrochemical immunosensor by using GO as a substrate for signal antibody and HRP loading via EDC/NHS linking.95 In addition, lots of enzyme–metal nanohybrid materials have been reported. For instance, Lin and co-workers synthesized enzyme–inorganic hybrid nanoflowers by the self-assembly of HRP and copper phosphate in solution via metal coordination to promote the nucleation of the HRP–Cu2+ crystal.96 In another case, Liang et al. fabricated a Zn2+/adenosine monophosphate (AMP) hydrogel for loading GOx and HRP simultaneously via the metal coordination between an enzyme and metal ions.97
In addition, enzymes can self-assemble into nanofibrils and nanofilms at the air–water interface, solid–liquid interface, and substrate.54,98,99 For example, Lara et al. synthesized self-assembled lysozyme nanotubes by the self-assembly of lysozyme under acid hydrolysis conditions.100 In their work, lysozyme was firstly self-assembled into twisting ribbons and then transformed into large-scale helical ribbons through a transformation step. Finally, the large helical ribbons were transformed into nanotubes with a diameter of dozens of nm. Knowles et al. fabricated lysozyme nanofibril films by enzymatic self-assembly with a two-step process.54 Hen egg white lysozyme was firstly self-assembled into nanofibrils in hydrochloric acid solution for 14 days. Subsequently, the fibril suspension was added to perform the polymerization reaction and then plasticizers were added to form a hydrogel. Finally, the obtained hydrogel was transferred to a flat polytetrafluoroethylene film to form a functional nanofibril film at the air–water interface (Fig. 5a).

In another case, Wang et al. fabricated a large-scale lysozyme film based on the self-assembly of lysozyme with three different substrates, namely solid/liquid interface, vapor/liquid interface, and water-sensitive substrate.98 In the first method, the surface of materials was immersed in a lysozyme solution mixture with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) buffer, which induced heterogeneous nucleation and assembly of lysozyme and promoted the formation of lysozyme films on the surface of materials (Fig. 5b). In the second method, the free-floating film was fabricated at the vapor/liquid interface (Fig. 5c), which can transfer to the hydrogel surface, and then dropped onto the water-sensitive substrate by the contact-printing technique (Fig. 5d).
2.5. Virus self-assembly
Virus, a protein-based molecule, can self-assemble into different dimensional structures in solution, on the substrate, and at the liquid/liquid interface.101 Recently, virus-based superstructures have attracted large interest in diagnosis, sensing, hybrid nanomaterial formation and tissue engineering. For example, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has been used to self-assemble into nanorods, nanofibers, and nanowires.102 He et al. used densitometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and neutron scattering techniques to study the influence factors such as concentration, pH, ionic strength and aspect ratio on the self-assembly of TMV at the oil–water interface.103 The results indicated that the self-assembly of TMV depended mainly on the concentration of TMV and ionic strength. At low TMV concentration, the rods oriented parallel to the interface, which mediates the interfacial interaction at the greatest extent per particle. However, at high TMV concentration, the rods were oriented flexible to the interface, which mediates the interfacial interactions and neutralizes the inter-rod electrostatic repulsion.
2.6. Biopolymer self-assembly
In general, biopolymers come from plant (soybean, pectin), algae (sodium alginate) and animal (chitosan) origin, and so on. Some biopolymers can self-assemble to form supramolecular structures such as nanofibers, films, and hydrogels, which have exhibited wide applications in food engineering, tissue engineering, and biomedicine.104
For example, Viswanathan et al. designed biopolymer nanofibers by the self-assembly of cellulose and cellulose–heparin composites using a nonvolatile room temperature ionic liquid solvent through electrospinning.105 In another study, Wang and co-workers developed gelatin-based biopolymer films based on corn oil and gelatin powder solution.106 In their study, the effects of pH and the content of corn oil on biopolymer film formation were studied. It was found that the corn oil content has an effect on the thickness, tensile strength and puncture strength of assembled polymer films, and the pH shows an effect on the percentage elongation at break point.
McClements and co-workers prepared a few biopolymer hydrogels and microgels based on molecular self-assembly through electrostatic interaction.107–109 In their work, gelatin and pectin were first mixed in solution at pH 10. Subsequently, the pH of the gelatin–pectin mixture solution was adjusted from 10 to 4.4 to promote the formation of biopolymer hydrogels due to the electrostatic attraction between the positively-charged gelatin and negatively-charged pectin (Fig. 6a).107 Furthermore, they investigated the effects of experimental parameters on the formation of biopolymer hydrogels and found that the salt concentration could inhibit the formation of hydrogel particles. In addition, the size of the particles was also affected by the shear rate and acidification rate. In another work, they used glutaraldehyde as a cross-linker to prepare gelatin and pectin biopolymer microgels by adjusting the pH of the solution from 10 to 5 at 40 °C.108 In addition, they used laccase to serve as a cross linker of the ferulic acid group on beet pectin and fabricated gelatin–beet pectin hydrogels under the conditions of pH 4.4 and 35 °C.109

Guan et al. prepared chitosan-based biopolymer hydrogels and encapsulated Ag+ to the fabricated hydrogels for antibacterial applications.110 In their work, the cross linking between dialdehyde hemicelluloses (DHC) and chitosan was performed to form hydrogels through the Schiff base reaction between the amino groups of chitosan chains and the aldehyde groups of DHC. Furthermore, the hydrogels were modified with AgNPs by immersing the hydrogels in Ag+ solution due to the reduction of Ag+ by aldehyde groups (Fig. 6b).
2.7. Summary of the self-assembly mechanisms and strategies
Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the internal interactions such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, π–π interaction, DNA/RNA base pairing, and ligand–receptor interaction play important roles in mediating the self-assembly of biomolecules and promoting the formation of biological nanostructures and nanomaterials. Usually, the self-assembly of biomolecules is related to single or multi intra- and inter-molecular interactions.
The self-assembly of biomolecules is highly sensitive to external stimulations, and therefore many strategies, including adjusting the solution conditions (pH, ionic strength, and temperature), using organic stimulators (ethanol, surfactants, and others), and adding nanoparticles or enzyme stimulators, have been proved to be effective to promote the self-assembly of biomolecules.
3. Bioinspired synthesis strategies for hierarchical hybrid nanomaterials
In part 2, we demonstrated the formation mechanisms and strategies of various biological nanomaterials by biomolecular self-assembly. To extend the applications of the obtained biological nanomaterials, bioinspired synthesis strategies based on the structures and functions of biomolecules have been utilized to prepare molecule/superstructure-based hybrid nanomaterials. In this part, we focus on how to use bioinspired synthesis strategies to produce hybrid nanomaterials. Four typical bioinspired strategies based on (i) molecule–molecule interaction, (ii) molecule–material recognition, (iii) molecule-mediated nucleation and growth, and (iv) molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation are presented by analyzing some typical examples (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  The bioinspired synthesis strategies for hybrid nanomaterials. 
3.1. Molecule–molecule interaction bioinspired synthesis
Designing and developing functional nanomaterials through molecule–molecule interaction have attract specific attention because this bioinspired synthesis offers outstanding advantages, such as controllable size, nanostructure, functions, and properties. Molecule–molecule interactions, such as protein–protein, protein–peptide, peptide–peptide, DNA–DNA, and others, have been utilized to produce hybrid nanomaterials.25,111
Lu and co-workers designed an injectable hydrogel by protein–peptide interaction,112 as shown in Fig. 8a. In this case, two components, a recombinant dimerization and docking domain (rDDD) polypeptide with an RGD binding motif and an A-kinase anchor protein with PEG were firstly prepared. The two components were simply mixed together to form the hydrogel by Dock and Lock mechanism-based self-assembly. The properties of the obtained hydrogel can be tuned by the AD peptide sequence, the concentration and ratio of each component, and the number of peptides on the cross-linking polymer. Furthermore, the fabricated hydrogel exhibited good recovery and biocompatibility for cell and drug therapies.

Zhang and co-workers designed a photo-responsive UVR8-derived protein for the synthesis of responsive hydrogels through peptide–protein interactions.113 In their work, the peptide Nap-GFFYGEK was first modified with tax-interacting protein-1 (TIP-1) to obtain the Nap-GFFYGEK(TIP-1) conjugate, and then the hybrid nanofibers were produced by the co-assembly of Nap-GFFYGEK and Nap-GFFYGEK(TIP-1), as shown in Fig. 8b and c. Due to the specific interactions between the small peptide motif (GGGWRESAI) of the UVR8-1 protein and TIP-1 protein, the UVR8-1 protein can be conjugated to the formed hybrid nanofibers via peptide–protein interactions. Finally, the UVR8-1 protein and the nanofiber solution were linked and self-assembled into a photo-sensitive hydrogel through the peptide–protein interaction between TIP-1 and the hexapeptide WRESAI. Interesting, the obtained hydrogel could be dispersed into the solution under UV light and re-organized to the hydrogel under visible light.
Gao et al. developed a multienzyme supramolecular network through protein–enzyme interaction.114 In this case, two enzyme–protein complexes, the LDH (leucine dehydrogenase)–PDZ (PSD95/Dlg1/zo-1) domain and the FDH (formate dehydrogenase)–PDZ ligand, were first prepared. Due to the protein–protein interactions between the PDZ domain and the ligand, the LDH–PDZ domain and the FDH–PDZ ligand were co-assembled into a multienzyme supramolecular network in vitro and in vivo. SEM and AFM characterization proved that the self-assembled nanomaterials show a 2D layer-like structure. In addition, the formed multienzyme supramolecular network exhibited improved catalytic activity for trimethylpyruvic acid and NADH compared to the unassembled structures.
The intermolecular interactions can be used to design functional biological hybrid materials.115 For instance, Gazit and co-workers demonstrated the co-assembly of FF and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-Phe-L-Phe-COOH (Boc-FF) peptides into nanotubes by using the peptide–peptide interaction.116 The FF and Boc-FF peptides were mixed at various ratios due to the inspired ability of the Boc-FF peptide to control the shape of various structures. In another case, Zheng and co-workers designed a 2D NP array through DNA–DNA interaction and DNA molecule-inspired binding and organization of AuNPs.117 Their study presents a simple and effective strategy for the formation of functional hybrid nanomaterials bioinspired by DNA hybridization.
3.2. Molecule–material recognition bioinspired synthesis
The interactions between biomolecules (peptides, proteins, DNA, etc.) and materials (metal NPs, solid substrates, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and others) can guide and inspire the synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials.26,118
Using the specific molecule–material recognition between molecules and materials, Li and co-workers fabricated Cu-based inorganic–protein nanoflowers on a fibrous membrane.119 In their work, the poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE)/PET nanofiber membrane was firstly fabricated by coating PVA-co-PE on the PET substrate (Fig. 9a). Secondly, the nanofibrous membrane was immersed in the NaOH and dioxane solution step by step for the adsorption of Cu2+. Finally, the nanofiber membrane with Cu2+ was soaked in the protein solution (such as BSA, papain, laccase and HRP) and the Cu-based inorganic–protein nanoflowers with different shapes and sizes were produced. The obtained results indicated that the structure of hybrid nanoflowers was related to the concentration and structure of the protein, reaction time, and the structure of the nanofiber membrane. In another work, Miao et al. utilized the specific recognition of cricoid protein rings with CdTe QDs to synthesize highly ordered nanostructures including hybrid protein–QD nanowires, nanowire bundles, and networks.118 In a further study, they demonstrated that the core-cross-linked micelles can direct the connection of cricoid protein rings to form self-assembling nanowires through protein–micelle recognition and protein–protein interactions.120

Many kinds of functional hybrid nanomaterials have been fabricated by using biomolecule–graphene recognition.121–124 Lim et al. developed fluorescent turn-on sensor based peptide–GO composites for lipopolysaccharide detection.125 Liu et al. fabricated a fluorescent protein kinase sensor by using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-capped AuNCs and GO composites via the recognition of the peptide with GO and AuNCs.126 Wei et al. designed a few graphene-based peptide nanofibers for different applications based on specific functional motifs for recognition with graphene.127–129 Tadepalli and co-workers investigated the behavior of SF and amphiphilic GO by controlling the pH of the SF solution,130 and found that interactions between the silk protein and GO can be adjusted by altering the pH and tailoring the structure of protein molecules. Song et al. developed a virus–GO hybrid structure for detection and disinfecting applications.131 In this case, GO can serve as a platform to capture the virus at room temperature and then disinfect at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 9b.
Other types of molecule–material recognition such as antibody–cell and amino acid–porphyrin have been reported. For example, Dou and co-workers132 designed a surface that was functionalized with the epithelial cell adhesion molecule antibody (anti-EpCAM) for capturing and releasing circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as shown in Fig. 9c. The recognition between the antibody and cells is ascribed to the interactions between the antibody and the antigen on the cell surface. Jiang et al. fabricated chiral nanohelices and microflowers by the chiral amphiphilic histidine (LHC18 or DHC 18)-mediated self-assembly of porphyrins (TCPP) with four carboxylic acids.133 For the formation of chiral nanohelices and microflowers, the structure was affected by the molecular chirality of amphiphilic histidine, the molar ratio of LHC18 or DHC18 to TCPP, the solvent, and the concentration of LHC18 or DHC18. Furthermore, the interactions of TCPP and LHC18 or DHC18 were demonstrated and they were hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions, as shown in Fig. 9d.
3.3. Molecule-mediated nucleation and growth
Molecule-mediated nucleation and growth is an efficient, green strategy for the bioinspired synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials,27,134 in which the biomolecules or self-assembled bionanomaterials can inspire the formation of nanoclusters, NPs, HA, and others in the absence of any reducing reagents.135–138
Previously, Wei et al. used a few biomolecules or superstructures (such as proteins, fibrinogen nanofibrils, and peptide nanofibers) as nucleation substrates to produce HA minerals.128,134,139,140 In a typical example, GO–fibrinogen NF hybrid composites on a silicon substrate was prepared by the layer-by-layer method and used for the nucleation and growth of HA in simulated body fluid at different periods, as shown in Fig. 10a.140

The Royal Society of Chemistry. (b) Peptide nanofiber-mediated growth of AuNCs on a nanofiber. Reprinted with the permission from ref. 28. Copyright 2017. American Chemical Society. 
Recently, a silk–HA hydrogel has been prepared and used for injectable bone applications by Kaplan's group.141 In their work, the silk-coated HA NPs were firstly prepared by using silk as a template to promote the nucleation and growth of HA NPs. Then the SF nanofibers were formed in water at 60 °C. Finally, the silk-coated HA NPs and SF nanofibers were mixed together to fabricate hybrid SF–HA hydrogels, which can serve as injectable bone materials for biomedical applications. In vitro and in vivo cell studies demonstrated that the SF–HA hybrid hydrogel has good cytocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation capacity.
The formation of metal NPs mediated by biomolecules (peptides, proteins, DNA, etc.) has also been reported widely. It is well known that a few amino acids like tryptophan (W) and tyrosine (Y) can be employed for the nucleation and growth of metal NPs without the use of secondary reduction reagents.28,142,143 For example, Mishra and co-workers synthesized AgNPs by the guidance of short PA to reduce Ag+ to AgNPs under sunlight.142 The prepared nanofiber–AgNP hybrids are uniform and controllable by adjusting the temperature.
Recently, Zhang et al. have designed peptide nanofiber–gold nanocluster (PNF–AuNC) by using the specific AuNC nucleation ability of the CCY peptide motif.28 In this case, a novel peptide (RGDAEAKAEAKCCYYCCAEAKAEAKRGD) was designed and used as a template for the nucleation and growth of AuNCs due to the reduction of Au3+ into AuNCs by the CCY domain. Finally, the peptide–AuNC self-assembled into PNF–AuNC, as shown in Fig. 10b. The resulted PNF–AuNC exhibited high luminescence and can be used as fluorescent thermometers and for cell imaging. In a similar case, Song and co-workers fabricated novel peptide–AuNC nanoclusters, which serve as a novel fluorescent probe for the detection of protein kinase.143 In their study, a peptide sequence (CCYLRRASLG) containing two regions was designed, in which the CCY domains were used for the reduction of Au3+ and the capture of AuNCs, and the LRRASLG domain was used for the binding of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Hence, the peptide–AuNC exhibited great potential for PKA biosensing due to the specific recognition and quick response. In another case, Munro and co-workers studied the effects of peptides on the reduction, nucleation, and growth of AuNPs by adjusting the ratio of peptides to Au3+, the reduction time, and the peptide sequence.144 They found that the tryptophan (W) residue was responsible for the reduction of Au3+ while the entire peptide plays a key role in the nucleation, growth, and stabilization of AuNPs in solution.
Very recently, Guterman and co-workers have reported the synthesis of PNFs by using bacterial type IV pili (T4P)-mimetic peptide building blocks.145 It was found that the formed PNFs were capable of binding metal oxide particles efficiently and reducing Au ions analogously to the native counterparts, making it possible to prepare multifunctional peptide–metal nanocomposites through bioinspired synthesis.
3.4. Molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation
Unlike the molecule-mediated nucleation and growth strategy, the molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation strategy for bioinspired hybrid nanomaterials is based on the chemical reactions with either reducing or oxidizing agents. The biomolecular superstructures can serve as building blocks for the binding and assembly of various inorganic NPs for hybrid nanomaterials.
Previously, Wei et al. synthesized fibrinogen nanofibrils by controlling the self-assembly of fibrinogen in a highly concentrated ethanol solution,146 and the obtained nanofibrils were further utilized to adsorb AuCl4− ions and form AuNPs by chemical reduction. In a further study, they investigated the synthesis of four protein (fibrinogen, γ-globulin, hemoglobin, and fibronectin)-inspired AuNPs by a simple adsorption and chemical reduction strategy.147 The prepared protein-protected AuNPs could be assembled on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through covalent binding.
Peptides have widely served as templates for metallization to form metal nanowires.148–150 In a typical study, Djalali et al. used histidine-rich nanofibers as templates to fabricate Au nanowires, as shown in Fig. 11a.151 Bis(N-R-amido-glycylglycine)-1,7-heptane dicarboxylate molecules (10 mM) were firstly self-assembled into nanofibers in a citric acid/NaOH solution (pH 5.5) and the histidine-rich peptide (AHHAHHAAD) was then conjugated to the nanofibers. Then chemically reduced AuNPs could be organized on the histidine binding sites to form Au nanowires. Recently, Feng et al. have used the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide to produce various nanostructures (NPs, nanoribbons, nanofibrils, and nanoflowers) via molecular self-assembly,152 which served as templates for the bioinspired synthesis of Au nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 11b. In their work, the Aβ25–35 peptide (GSNKGAIIGLM) was self-assembled in PBS for 0, 3, and 12 hours and in water for 0 h to form monomers (P0), protofibrils (P3), fibrils (P12), and monomers (W0), respectively. Then the resulted peptide structures served as templates for growing Au nanostructures through the chemical reduction of Au3+ with NaBH4.

American Chemical Society. (b) Peptide-mediated chemical reduction and synthesis of four Au nanostructures. Reprinted with the permission from ref. 152. Copyright 2018. American Chemical Society. 
Besides proteins and peptides, other biomolecules such as DNA and enzymes are also versatile templates for producing hybrid nanomaterials based on the reduction/oxidation method. For instance, Wang et al. studied the effects of different DNA sequences on the formation of AuNPs.153 Three different DNAs were firstly immobilized on the Au nanosphere surface by adding a hydroxylamine reducing agent, respectively. Then HAuCl4 was introduced into the mixture solution and stirred to form DNA based flower-like AuNPs with different morphologies. They found that the affinity of DNA to AuNPs plays a major role in the morphological control of NPs. In other cases, Wang's group synthesized AuNPs by the mediation of an immobilized enzyme (GOx), which can adsorb AuCl4− ions and guide the formation of AuNPs in the presence of NaBH4.154,155
3.5. Biomolecular self-assembly inspired formation of hybrid nanomaterials
Based on the above introduction on the bioinspired synthesis strategies for producing biomolecule-based functional nanomaterials, in this part we would like to summarize the examples to illuminate how biomolecular self-assembly inspired the formation of various hybrid nanomaterials, as shown in Table 1.

Based on the typical bioinspiration strategies, such as molecule–molecule interaction (type I), molecule–material recognition (type II), molecule-mediated nucleation and growth (type III), and molecule-mediated reduction/oxidation (type IV), various hybrid bionanomaterials by combining with the corresponding building blocks like NPs, CNTs, graphene, and others could be fabricated effectively to 0D,94,126,152,154,156–158 1D,28,116,118,129,142,152,159,160 2D,114,125,127,128,130,131,152,161 and 3D94,113,119,140,141,152,153,162–164 structures.
4. Energy-related applications
Hybrid bionanomaterials inspired by biomolecular self-assembly have been widely used in biomedical applications, and now more and more attempts have also been made to explore their potential applications in the energy field. In this part, we will present and discuss the applications of biomolecule-inspired nanomaterials in biofuel cells, light-harvesting systems, batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts.
4.1. Biofuel cells
Biofuel cells can produce electricity for various applications by using living organisms. In this section, the fabrication and characterization of enzymatic and microbial biofuel cells will be introduced and discussed.

4.1.1. Enzymatic biofuel cells. 
Based on the immobilization of enzymes on the electrode surface, enzymatic biofuel cells have become popular electronic devices for energy and environmental applications through replacing precious metals with enzymes as a catalyst to oxidize the fuel.165 As a small energy equipment, they have been used for many applications such as bioelectric catalysts and electrochemical sensors.166 The electron transfer mechanisms in enzymatic biofuel cells are generally divided into two types: mediated electron transfer (MET) and direct electron transfer (DET).167 The former allows enzyme and electrode reactions to exist independently while the latter does not. In MET, the mediator plays an important role, which can be fixed in the substrate with the biocatalyst or covalently bound to the surface. DET is an enzyme-catalyzed electrode process, in which electrons are transferred directly from the electrode to the substrate molecule. Combined with other nanomaterials, the electron transfer rate of enzyme electrodes can be increased greatly.
Among the enzymatic biofuel cells, GOx-inspired bio-anodes have been used widely. Unlike ordinary biofuel cells, enzymes can replace the membrane separator.168 However, it was plagued by the inefficiency of electron transfer. In order to solve this problem, some inorganic nanomaterials such as NPs and CNTs can be added to improve the performance of the enzymatic electrodes.169 For instance, Zebda et al. connected GOx with conductive pure CNTs to form 3D CNT bio-anodes by mechanical compression.170 The fabricated bio-anodes had a porous matrix, which guaranteed the diffusion of the enzyme substrate and improved the efficiency of electron transfer. Therefore, the designed glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) exhibited high current density. In addition, chitosan can be used to improve the stability of CNTs in GBFCs.171 Similarly, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have also been applied as a support for the enzyme to form a 3D bio-anode.172 It can also be applied to the bio-cathode through lipid functionalization.
In addition to CNTs, graphene can also be integrated with enzymes to improve the power output of a biofuel cell. For example, Tan and Sato developed a new type of GBFC by compressing the enzyme, the mediator and graphene through centrifugation.173 Graphene-combined GOx as a bio-anode and Pt wire as a cathode were utilized to produce a maximum open circuit voltage of approximately 0.38 V. It was found that the GBFC exhibited a high power density of approximately 70 μW cm−2. In addition, the fabricated bio-anode revealed high catalytic activity to the redox mediators and the centrifugation process improved the interactions of enzymes. In another case, Pakapongpan et al. used magnetic Fe3O4 NPs and RGO for fixing GOx to fabricate a novel bioelectrode, which showed potential applications in mediatorless GBFCs.174 The formed Fe3O4–RGO had a positive charge on its surface and combined with negatively charged bilirubin oxidase (BOD) or GOx by electrostatic interaction, as shown in Fig. 12a and b. It was a kind of biofuel cell without using both film and medium, which had strong tolerability, high surface activity, and low toxicity. Jia and co-workers demonstrated the fabrication of a high-potential biocathode based on the co-immobilization of GOx and HRP on a graphene electrode modified with CNTs and carbon microfibers.175

The unique catalytic properties of laccase make it widely used in biological catalysis and electrochemistry. Zhao et al. used GOx as an anodic biocatalyst and laccase as a cathodic biocatalyst to fabricate a novel CNT–HA biofuel cell.176 Their method solved the problem of slow electron transfer between the redox center of the biocatalyst and the bottom electrode, and improved the power density of the fabricated biofuel cells.
BOD shows good stability in a neutral environment while laccase is limited to the acidic environment.177 In addition, the resistance of BOD to other chelators is stronger than that of laccase. Therefore, the combination of BOD and the electrode can make up for the deficiency of the laccase electrode. For example, Dronov et al. investigated the electron transfer between cytochrome c and BOD.178 BOD, cytochrome c, and poly(aniline sulfonic acid) (PASA) were immobilized on gold electrodes that contain a polyelectrolyte multilayer. Then proteins were assembled on the electrode by electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly. The electrode facilitated the transfer of electrons from the electrode to multiple protein layers without a mediator and direct electron transfer was achieved in the protein components. A large reduction current was found, showing that the electrode activity was the strongest in neutral environments.
Dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the redox reaction of substances. The substance is oxidized by oxygen through the electron transport chain after catalytic hydrogenation. Dehydrogenase is also widely used in biofuel cells. Apart from the problem of electron transfer efficiency, the immobilization technology of the enzyme also needs to be improved. For example, Takeo Miyake et al. used carbon nanotube forest (CNTF) to dynamically capture fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) through liquid-induced shrinkage, so that the enzyme electrode showed renewable activity, as shown in Fig. 12c.179 The key of the entrapment is the sufficient loading of enzymes. Combining the FDH-based anode with the LAC-entrapped CNTF cathode (Fig. 12d) increased the power density of enzyme biofuel cells. In addition, it retained the activity of the FDH enzyme.
DNA has been widely used in many fields because of its specificity, especially artificially selected functional DNA. As a new type of aptamer, it can be used in biocomputing, which drives the development of biotechnology. For instance, Zhou et al. tried to control the power release of biocells through aptamer-based biochemical signals in an aptamer system.180 The outlet of biofuel cells allowed the flow of PDMS. The inlet of biofuel cells contained two on-chip patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) with GOx/aptamer-modified bioanode and BOD/aptamer modified biocathode. Then the reciprocal relationship was formed between aptamers and biofuel cells (Fig. 13a and b). The fabricated biofuel cell using this system was simple and efficient, which had better target affinity and higher repeatability. Specifically, the addition of diagnostic aptamers will enable logic systems to play an important role in intelligent diagnosis.

It is clear that the combination of enzymes with nanomaterials improves the catalytic efficiency of enzymes and the power of the fabricated biofuel cells, which provides a potential strategy for improving the performance of batteries.


4.1.2. Microbial biofuel cells. 
Microbial fuel cells, a device that converts biochemical metabolic energy into electric energy, play an important role in energy and environmental applications.181 It provides a new way for renewable energy production and waste disposal. Compared with the traditional biofuel cells, it has the advantages of no pollution, no emission and no energy input. Therefore, it is receiving more and more attention. However, general microbial fuel cells also suffer from low power as a result of weak interaction between electrodes and bacteria, especially the anode.182 Because the different sizes and shapes of bionanomaterials can provide large surface areas for immobilizing bacteria, some scientists are considering combining them with other materials to improve battery performance, increase conductivity and improve energy conversion.183
Xu et al. reported a novel anodic modification method using self-assembled peptide nanotubes which fixed the redox mediator riboflavin (RF) on a carbon cloth.184 The RF/PNT anode (Fig. 14a and b) can increase the efficiency of electron transfer between bacteria and electrodes as well as the electrochemical activity, thus improving the power generation efficiency of microbial fuel cells. The morphological (Fig. 14c and d) and structural (Fig. 14e) characterization indicated the combination of PNT and carbon cloth and its high crystallinity. More importantly, this modified anode reduced the internal resistance and promoted power generation compared with other similar anodes.

Besides, they also used self-assembled peptide nanotubes for another experiment to modify the cathode.185 The PNT/RM/CP cathodes not only increased the electronic conductivity and improved the power of the microbial fuel cells (Fig. 14f), but also removed azo dyes effectively (the principle can be seen in Fig. 14g). The modification of the electrode improves the performance of the microbial cell and provides a strategy for pollutant treatment as well. In addition, electroactive biofilms also affect the electron transfer efficiency. According to the report, bacterial tetraheme cytochrome c3 promoted electron transfer on ferredoxin, showing that protein/protein/electrode ternary complexes increase the efficiency of electron transfer.186 Besides, soluble protein was also designed as a protein membrane for electrode modification. In general, compared with the ordinary structure, the multilayer protein structure can improve the electron transfer efficiency at a higher level. But this structure of the electrode is also challenging.187 In fact, to solve this problem, on the one hand, the study of charge transport at the microbe–electrode interface needs to be performed, and on the other hand, we also need to understand the electronic transfer mechanism of proteins and enzymes.

4.2. Light-harvesting systems
In this section, we demonstrate the biomolecular self-assembly inspired nanomaterials for light-harvesting systems and their potential applications in solar cells and photocatalysts.

4.2.1. Protein-based systems. 
The design and synthesis of customized functional protein-based nanomaterials have led to increased applications in light-harvesting materials. For example, Sun et al. used self-assembled protein nanowires as multi-purpose scaffolds for lighting-harvesting systems.120 They found that the micelles, acting as organic NPs, can control and induce the process of protein self-assembly. In addition, the self-assembly of proteins mainly depends on the electrostatic interaction in this process. This kind of supramolecular scaffold was versatile and can be operated optionally, which further led to the development of artificial light-harvesting systems. In another example, the self-assembly of proteins has been induced by DNA to obtain a novel light-harvesting material by Henry et al.188 The development of DNA-directed light-harvesting protein assembly guides the way to prepare multidimensional light-harvesting materials.
QDs can also induce the self-assembly of proteins to functional nanomaterials for light-harvesting materials. Recently, Miao et al. have combined the stable protein one (SP1) with QDs via electrostatic self-assembly.118 Ring-like SP1 carried a large amount of negative charge (red color) while QDs had a positive charge (blue color); thus they were self-assembled into nanowires with a sandwich structure, as shown in Fig. 15a. The obtained results indicated that QD1 had higher energy transfer efficiency than QD2. Since QD1 and QD3 have less overlap at their emission peaks, the self-assembly of QD1 and QD3 together with SP1 nanometer can achieve effective energy transfer. The connection of QD3 at the head or middle of the nanowires resulted in nanowires with different heights (Fig. 15b and c), which can be assembled either directly or indirectly, as shown in Fig. 15c. The strategies shown in this case can be used for the design and construction of highly-ordered functional protein nanomaterials and the fabrication of functional optical nano-devices.

4.2.2. Peptide-based systems. 
Since the structure of the peptide is easy to program and its self-assembled structures are adjustable, peptide-inspired nanomaterials have shown promising applications in light-harvesting materials.
PA and metalloporphyrins can also combine and self-assemble into high quality nanofibers for light-harvesting systems. For instance, Fry et al. designed a peptide sequence c16–AHL3K3–CO2H, and then combined metalloporphyrin zinc protoporphyrin IX(PPIX)Zn to form a long PA–metalloporphyrin fiber with a β-sheet structure (Fig. 15d).189 The fabricated long fibers included single, double, and triple units with different heights, as shown in the AFM image (Fig. 15e). It is clear that the fabricated nanofibers provided sufficient binding sites for metalloporphyrins and allowed (PPIX)Zn to be photo-excited, which provided the possibility for peptide-based photovoltaic materials.
In addition to nanofibers, dipeptides and porphyrins can also be self-assembled into porous microspheres for light-harvesting systems. The peptide–porphyrin microspheres had good stability and photocatalytic activity, which can be developed into light-harvesting components.190 Liu and co-workers investigated the self-assembly mechanism of dipeptide–porphyrin co-assembly systems.191 It was found that the self-assembly of dipeptide–porphyrin at the molecular level was driven mainly by electrostatically enhanced hydrogen bonding. In addition, the hydrophobic effect also played a significant role in the stability. More importantly, different types of dipeptides can self-assemble into different nanomaterials with porphyrins, such as dilysine (KK3+ alan) tends to self-assemble into fiber bundles while diphenyline (FF+) tends to be formed in the shape of a microsphere. In general, the nanomaterials assembled from peptides and molecules with physical and optical properties have taken an important step towards building light-harvesting nanostructures. Besides, the fabricated peptide-inspired nanomaterials have also shown potential applications in optical reactions and energy transfer.


4.2.3. DNA-based systems. 
Compared with proteins and peptides, DNA has obvious advantages of simple molecular structure and unique DNA hybridization properties. As for light-harvesting materials, chromophores and DNA can be assembled by covalent and noncovalent connections.192 Although noncovalent self-assembly can be utilized to fabricate light-harvesting materials, covalent DNA systems based on DNA base substitution and modification can overcome the disadvantage of artificial self-assembled light-harvesting materials. It can control the distance within a certain range accurately, and the π–π interactions keep the structure stable.193
DNA-inspired nanomaterials have been applied for the development of supramolecular light-harvesting antennas. For instance, Albert et al. used the solid-phase “click” chemistry approach to synthesize DNA–oligo(p-phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) hybrid amphiphiles (Fig. 16a).194 Influenced by the hydrophobic and π–π stacking interactions of OPEs, fluorescent nanovesicles with tunable emission were produced. It can be found that DNA was distributed at the two poles of the vesicle membrane. In a further step, AuNPs were used to modify the vesicle surface by DNA hybridization. The introduction of suitable FRET acceptors to the DNA-based material system was performed to design a supramolecular light-harvesting antenna.

(c) Theoretical simulation of a square-shaped DNA origami platform for light harvesting. Reprinted with the permission from ref. 197. Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society. 
In addition, DNA as a scaffold for the positioning of chromophores can also be combined with porphyrin for artificial light harvesting. Woller et al. used porphyrin–thymine nucleoside as an energy receptor and YO-PRO-1 (YO) as a donor, and then fixed them together on the lipid bilayer based DNA template to build an efficient light-harvesting system (Fig. 16b).195 This novel DNA-based antenna complex had high light-harvesting efficiency and high overall transmission efficiency.
Recently, Bösch et al. have demonstrated the self-assembly of dsDNA molecules containing phenanthrene to form vesicles for light harvesting.196 It can be found that an ordered array of phenanthrene promoted the energy transfer and improved the light harvesting efficiency. In addition, the light-harvesting properties of the DNA-inspired vesicles are reversible.
DNA origami can control the spatial structure of DNA to assemble 2D ordered nanomaterials, which can also be useful for the fabrication of light-harvesting systems. Hemmig et al. used DNA origami to program antenna arrays for antenna systems.197 This antenna model was composed of two layers of a DNA origami platform, and Cy3 and Cy5 were used as the receptor dye and donor dye to form the donor–acceptor pairs, respectively. Six Cy3 attachment points formed a ring with a Cy5 attachment point at the center with another Cy5 attachment point outside the ring, which is clearly shown in Fig. 16c. The energy transfer efficiency of single donor–acceptor pairs can be used as a basis for estimating interchromophore distances. According to the flexibility of DNA origami, they changed the number and location of neighboring donors, then assembled a lot of structures. The relation between the antenna effect (AE tot) and the number of adjacent donors (N) was linearly fitted. This research made a great breakthrough in exploring the reasonable design of light-harvesting building blocks and the nature of photoexcitation in antenna systems.


4.2.4. Other biomolecule-based systems. 
Viruses have attracted large attention in materials science, nanotechnology, and optical fields due to their uniform nanostructure and specific binding properties.198
M13 is a common virus model, which can be combined with zinc porphyrins (ZP) and self-assembled into a novel light-absorbing material. The existence of hydrophobic interaction and π-conjugated macrocycles between them resulted in a straight structure of ZP–M13. Moreover, it also exhibited the quenching of fluorescence emission, in which Dexter-type electronic interactions between porphyrins played an important role.199
TMV has also been utilized for light harvesting. For example, Endo et al. arranged Zn-coordinated porphyrin (ZnP) and free-base porphyrin (FbP) on the self-assembly of TMV protein to construct the TMV–porphyrin system.200 In this system, the self-assembly of TMV served as a 3D scaffold, and ZnP and FbP acted as the donor and receptor, respectively, and the multi-effects promoted the energy transfer and light-harvesting activity. Interestingly, the TMV–porphyrin conjugates self-assembled into double-layered disk structures under neutral conditions, while they self-assembled into rod-like structures under weakly acidic conditions.
Native TMV assemblies exhibited similar functions for the fabrication of light-harvesting systems. Miller and co-workers assembled disk- and rod-like materials to deliver energy by using TMV.201 They developed a strategy to introduce cysteine residues with fluorescent chromophores into the TMV protein shell, which could self-assemble into materials with different shapes to build light-harvesting systems. This kind of material had a high efficiency in light collection and energy transfer, which can be widely used as a component of photovoltaic devices. Besides, in the photosynthetic antenna complex, cysteine was involved in the activation of energy by electrostatic interaction and π–π stacking.202 Composite nanomaterials based on small biomolecules such as cysteine also possess the properties of light collection. Shao et al. reported that lysine head groups participated in the synthesis of well-ordered 1D nanotubes.203 As a tool for collecting light, it can promote charge transfer and energy transfer. In general, the combination of biomolecules and chromophores with photochemical properties can stimulate potential energy, which makes it possible for the highly effective and economical use of light energy.


4.2.5. Solar cells. 
Bioinspired synthesis can provide a new way for the development of solar cells. Self-assembled peptide nanostructures as scaffolds allow energy transfer and have a strong absorption capacity in the near ultraviolet region, thus increasing their potential for use as a prototype of dye-sensitized solar cells.204 For example, TiO2 and peptides can be used in the production of dye-sensitized solar cells. Gatto et al. incorporated the synthesized helical hexapeptide into the gold-covered TiO2 surface, which exhibited unique self-assembly properties on the surface, as indicated in Fig. 17a.205 This kind of peptide was thought to be a good electron medium for electron transfer by enhancing the photocurrent. It can be applied to photoelectric appliances and solar conversion. In addition, the self-assembled peptide monolayers can also be fixed on the TiO2 surface through electrostatic interaction. It could change the properties of the metal surface and improve the efficiency of charge transfer, and the solar cells made of this material had the characteristics of high efficiency and long life.206

Hollow TiO2 nanoribbons can be obtained by using peptides as templates. Han et al. deposited a TiO2 layer on the self-assembled FF nanoribbons to obtain hollow TiO2 nanoribbons after pyrolysis at high temperature,207 as shown in Fig. 17b. They can be used as a photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells, which improved the power conversion efficiency of the fabricated solar cells.
As a good semiconductor and photocatalyst, TiO2 can not only bind with peptides, but also self-assemble into nanoclusters based on a DNA mediator. TiO2 NPs were self-assembled on a DNA template to form a linear structure through simple electrostatic interaction and covalent modifications.208 The obtained DNA–TiO2 1D nanowires were proved to be good anode materials for solar cells with a high cycle life. In addition, TiO2 can combine with CNTs to form composite nanomaterials by using viruses as templates. For instance, Dang et al. used the genetically engineered M13 virus to synthesize SWCNT–TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites through a general and programmable method, as shown in Fig. 17c.209 It can be seen that after the formation of virus/SWCNT complexes, a mixture of the SWCNT/TiO2 complex with sol–gel TiO2 NPs was obtained through the virus-inspired biomineralization of TiO2 nanocrystals. This system maintains the original structure of each part and exhibits the characteristics of high electron mobility, which can be used to improve power conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells (Fig. 17d).
Besides, proteins can also combine with DNA and self-assemble into solar battery materials. For example, Kumar et al. designed a protein/DNA scaffold that combined with a dye through covalent conjugation.210 The solar cells containing these materials had good energy conversion efficiency and thermal stability, revealing great progress in the design and fabrication of biological solar cells.
Based on the above introduction, we suggest that composite nanostructures based on biomolecular self-assembly and bioinspired synthesis could be alternative materials to fabricate photoelectric devices with an improved photoelectric conversion rate.


4.2.6. Photocatalysis and photosynthesis. 
Most photocatalysts consist of inorganic light-absorbing materials, which can optimize the separation of a charge carrier.211 Zou et al. assembled positively charged dipeptides and negatively charged porphyrins by electrostatic interaction to synthesize porous microspheres.190 Due to the existence of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals force, a multi-chamber structure of the microspheres was formed. The obtained microspheres were rich in water, and had the characteristics of light stability and light resistance. The photocatalytic applications of the formed microspheres was tested by putting the materials in a solution containing 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), which could be reduced to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by photo-irradiation, as shown in Fig. 18a and b. The synthesized microspheres can serve as a model for the photosynthetic system, which promoted sustainable energy production.

Self-assembled peptide superstructures are ideal templates for the bioinspired synthesis of functional nanomaterials for photocatalysis applications. For instance, Naik and co-workers assembled CdS/Pt NP photocatalysts as an enzyme mimic using peptide templates.212 Due to the use of enzymes, it can solve many problems such as thermal denaturation and long-term stability. In addition, because of the special structure and good catalytic activity, porphyrins can also be combined with peptides for designing functional nanomaterials.213
For example, to mimic photosynthesis and collect solar energy, Kim et al. used self-assembled peptide nanotubes as templates and bound them with porphyrins through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds for biomimetic photosynthesis,214 as presented in Fig. 18c. FF and tetra(p-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (THPP) were selected due to their similar optical and electrochemical properties and unique hydrophobic interactions. The platinum nanoparticles (nPt) were then deposited on the surface of FF/THPP nanotubes to ensure efficient electron transfer. In addition, through comparative experiments, it was found that FF/THPP/nPt nanotubes not only had good turnover frequency and cyclic usability, but also accelerated the production of NADH and the synthesis of redox enzymes (Fig. 18d and e).
Guler et al. demonstrated a facile and reliable method to fabricate TiO2 and ZnO semiconductor 3D nanonetworks by using self-assembled PA nanofiber networks as templates.215 TiO2 and ZnO were deposited on the formed peptide nanofibers by atomic layer deposition. After removing the peptide template, 3D TiO2 and ZnO nanonetworks were formed, which exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities. Their study presented for the first time a successful example to fabricate 3D semiconductor nanonetworks with controlled band gap energies.
Besides, proteins can serve as templates for producing photocatalysts. For instance, Garderes et al. found that TiO2 can be combined with self-assembled protein fibers to form a template for a TiO2 photocatalyst.216 Biphasic bioengineering was used to synthesize self-assembled protein fibers, which controlled the self-assembly of silicatein outside the cell. Finally, TiO2-decorated silicatein/silintaphin microfilaments were synthesized through weak non-covalent interactions. This kind of photocatalyst can solve the problem of post-treatment recovery.
To sum up, photocatalysts with biomolecular self-assembly and bioinspired synthesis exhibited good catalytic activity, which played a great role in mimicking photosynthesis.

4.3. Batteries

4.3.1. Li-ion batteries. 
The lithium ion (Li-ion) battery has received much attention because of its several merits such as long service life and high energy density. However, the performance of the Li-ion battery needs to be further improved, especially the improvement of electrode materials. Therefore, lots of efforts have been made to overcome these shortcomings.
Due to the multiple length scales of viruses, a hierarchical assembly can be designed through virus–virus interactions. Therein, M13 is a good viral template for developing Co3O4 nanowires as electrode materials. Nam et al. used modified M13 virus protein shells (p8) as biological templates to synthesize Co3O4 and Au–Co3O4 nanowires via electrostatic interaction (Fig. 19a).217 The genetically modified M13 bacteriophage virus containing a gold-binding peptide motif (LKAHLPPSRLPS) was able to undergo bioinspired binding to Au–Co3O4 (Fig. 19b). The morphological characterization indicated the formation of uniform Au and Co3O4 NPs on the M13 template (Fig. 19c and d). The obtained self-assembled composite material-based electrode materials can be used as Li-ion battery devices, which can improve the battery capacity and ensure the stability of charging and discharging capacity. In another example, the preparation of a 3D high capacity composite silicon anode via the TMV template has been reported.218 The fabricated Li-ion battery had excellent discharge cycling stability. Importantly, the sponge-like silicon structure formed after this process can improve the reaction kinetics and anode stability. Due to the simple structure, a virus is the best choice for a biological template. It will continue to play an important role in the preparation of electrode materials.

As a unique structural template, self-assembled peptide superstructures can form stable nanostructures with other materials through various molecular interactions such as electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonds.219 Owing to the structural diversity and biocompatibility, the self-assembled peptide nanomaterials can be used in energy storage and conversion equipment.220 For example, Han et al. fabricated conductive core/shell nanowires using graphene and peptides.221 The hollow graphene–shell network obtained after thermal calcination had high electrical conductivity as an electrode material.
Although graphitic materials have a stable structure, their theoretical specific capacity is still relatively small, so metal oxide is considered as a high specific capacity anode material with remarkable performance.222 Ryu et al. incorporated self-assembled peptide nanotubes into Co3O4 to produce functional energy storage nanomaterials.223 Co3O4 exhibited high electrochemical activity in hybrid nanowires, which enhanced the capacity of the lithium ion battery electrode. Interestingly, pure peptide nanowires also showed electrochemical activity with Li in this experiment. In another case, Rosant et al. described that a tetrapeptide inspired the formation of Co3O4 NPs with different sizes.224 This peptide-based phage electrode ensured the integrity of particle aggregates, which can be used as an electrode material template for Li-ion batteries.
In addition to Co3O4, TiO2 has been used for the bioinspired synthesis of electrode materials. Kim et al. designed a 3D network of TiO2 hollow nanoribbons by using peptide self-assembly via atomic layer deposition.225 This highly ordered network structure facilitated electronic transmission, which improved electron conductivity. Due to good circulation stability and structural stability, this hollow ribbon TiO2 network was regarded as an excellent electrode material for Li-ion batteries.


4.3.2. Micro, Li–S, and Ni–Zn batteries. 
In addition to Li-ion batteries, the combination of biomolecules with other nanomaterials can be used to fabricate other batteries like micro-batteries and secondary batteries, such as Li–S and Ni–Zn batteries.
Nam and co-workers proposed using a combination of biological assembly and micro-contact printing to produce layered nanostructured electrode materials.226 The assembled virus-based Co3O4 nanowires can be printed on a Pt microstrip current collector (Fig. 20a), and the optical (Fig. 20b) and AFM (Fig. 20c) images of the fabricated electrode indicated a uniform structure of the electrode. Virus nanowires (Fig. 20d) and virus-inspired Co3O4 (Fig. 20e) nanowires were bound to the electrode surface successfully. This virus-based microcell electrode was flexible and stable and this method also provided a new approach for the preparation of electrode materials. A self-assembled peptide has certain conductivity and its structure can be adjusted to bind to sulfur for Li–S batteries. When self-assembled peptide superstructures were incorporated into sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs), the recyclability of Li–S batteries could be increased, which is ascribed to the strong combination of the peptide with sulfur via a hydrogen bond.227

(a–e) Virus-based Co3O4 nanowires for microbattery applications: (a) fabrication procedure; (b) optical and (c) AFM images of an electrode; (d) electrode with virus nanowires; and (e) electrode with virus-inspired Co3O4 nanowires.

Reprinted with the permission from ref. 228. Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. 
Protein is also involved in the preparation of multifunctional electrode materials. For example, Fu and co-workers produced Li–S batteries (Fig. 20f) by using a polysulfide nanofilter (PSNF) through combining self-assembled proteins with conducting particles (Fig. 20g), which had a separate stable conductive layer.228 The bioinspired materials displayed a 3D porous structure and functional layer-like surface, which could be the key factors to improve performance. The PSNF can be used to capture sulfide in Li–S batteries and facilitate the transport of lithium ions between two electrodes, thus improving the electron conductivity. A comparison of the PSNF-based Li–S battery before and after 200 cycles of charging–discharging was made (Fig. 20i and j), and it was found that the pores of the PSNF had been filled with active substances, which proved its efficient capture of sulfide. In addition, the PSNF can also be used as a separator coating to improve electrochemical performance. It can be clearly seen that PSNF@CS had the best cycling stability compared to the other two coatings (Fig. 20h). Besides, a self-assembled virus can also be used as a biological template. For example, TMV was self-assembled to form rod-like particles which can perform uniform deposition of metal ions on the surface for metal-directed coating.229 It can be applied to nickel and zinc batteries, which increases the effective surface area and capacity of the battery and extends the battery life.
In another example, Ni-plated TMVs were self-assembled into a nanorod structure on a gold coating, which formed a 3D layered electrode.230 This Ni/NiO electrode with TMVs as the template greatly increased the charge storage capacity of the battery and the stability of electrochemical cycling. Similarly, the bioinspired synthesis method can be used to improve the performance of sodium ion batteries. For example, self-assembled M13 viruses can combine with SWCNTs, which were used as nanostructured FePO4 generated templates.231 The M13 virus and Fe3+ combined mainly by electrostatic interactions; this composite electrode can increase the power and capacity of sodium ion batteries and promote the development of sodium ion batteries.

4.4. Supercapacitors
Similar to biofuel cells, supercapacitors are also receiving a lot of attention in recent years. A supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage device between a conventional capacitor and a rechargeable battery, which has high power and good cycling stability. In this section, various supercapacitors based on self-assembled biomolecular superstructures and other materials (carbon nanomaterials and metal oxide) are demonstrated.

4.4.1. Combining with carbon nanomaterials. 
Self-assembled peptide nanotubes not only have good optical properties but also have unique electrochemical properties.232 This is of great significance for the modification of an electrode with biological superstructures. For instance, the modification of a carbon electrode by coating peptide nanotubes through physical vapor deposition has been reported by Beker and co-workers.233 By comparing several groups of nanotubes with different thicknesses and densities, they explored the optimal size to improve the performance of the supercapacitor. The surface area of the carbon electrode modified by peptide nanotubes can be increased directly to improve the capacitance. Most importantly, they demonstrated that the wetted surface area of the nanoscale hydrophilic channels of peptide nanotubes was a key factor affecting the capacitance. Therefore, the performance of the electrode had a direct influence on the improvement of the overall performance.
CNTs are the most popular materials for energy-storing electrodes due to their unique pore structure and good electrical performance, mechanical performance, and thermal stability.234 CNTs can combine with biomolecules such as DNA to improve the performance of supercapacitors. For example, Hur et al. demonstrated that porous DNA hydrogels (Dgel) can be good templates for electrodepositing CNT layers and polyaniline layers,235 as shown in Fig. 21a. The insulating Dgel was transferred to a conductive one through the electrostatic deposition of PAHs, CNTs, and PANI in the Dgel (Fig. 21b), which was formed by the self-assembly of X-shaped DNA building blocks (Fig. 21c). The formed supercapacitors exhibited good biocompatibility and circulation stability. In another case, Shin et al. combined DNA with CNT fibers to prepare DNA–SWNT-hybrid fibers by wet-spinning.236 Cross-linked DNA as a binder acted on the CNT sidewall through π–π interaction, which enhanced the capacitance and conductivity. It was proved that the DNA–SWNT fiber exhibited excellent performance of the supercapacitor and actuation.

Although CNTs were widely used in supercapacitors, the contact resistance between electrodes and current collectors reduced the performance of the supercapacitors. Owing to the good chemical stability, high conductivity, and surface area, graphene as a competitive material has received great attention recently.237 Han et al. assembled an aromatic peptide of diphenylalanine (FF) along with graphene to form core–shell nanowires through electrostatic attraction.221 After thermal calcination, a hollow graphene–shell network was obtained, which has been used as the electrode of the supercapacitor to improve the conductivity.
Overall, the combination of carbon materials with biomolecular superstructures for electrode modification could be an ideal way to improve the performance of supercapacitors.


4.4.2. Combining with metal oxides. 
As an electrochemical active material, metal oxide can accelerate the redox reactions on the electrode to improve the capacitance and energy.238 Therefore, it is possible to combine self-assembled biomolecular nanostructures with metal oxide to fabricate novel electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
Nithiyanantham et al. designed a novel route to assemble TiO2 into wire-like clusters on a DNA template for supercapacitor applications.208 DNA was combined with TiO2 through a simple electrostatic interaction between DNA and a Ti salt and subsequent heating (Fig. 22a). DNA as an electronegative structural template attracted metal cations to bind along the DNA scaffold. The DNA-inspired wire-like clusters of TiO2 nanoparticles can be a good material for the fabrication of a supercapacitor, which improved the cycle life and increased the capacitance.

Copyright 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Self-assembled peptide superstructures can also be utilized to bind TiO2 for supercapacitors. For example, Hu and co-workers demonstrated the formation of TiO2 on the surface of self-assembled FF nanotubes, and further explored the applications of peptide-inspired TiO2 nanotubes in supercapacitors.239 This peptide–TiO2 modified electrode exhibited outstanding stability and capacity as a supercapacitor. It showed more than 95% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles and mass-specific capacitance of 125 F g−1 at a 0.1 A g−1 current density.
Similarly, MnO2 can combine with biomolecules to modify an electrode for supercapacitor applications. For instance, Guo et al. used the DNA-assisted assembly approach to combine DNA, CNTs and MnO2 to produce a porous structural electrode,240 which exhibited potential as the anode material of an asymmetric supercapacitor. In their study, CNTs were first functionalized with DNA to form CNTs@DNA hybrids via π–π interaction, and then MnO2 nanospheres were connected to the CNTs@DNA chain to form a network structure, as shown in Fig. 22b. This fabricated electrode promoted electrolyte transport in the supercapacitor, which possessed the advantages of high energy and high power density. In another study, Ede and co-workers developed a new DNA-assisted approach to prepare flake-like and wire-like MnO2 nanomaterials for supercapacitor applications.241 Through comparative experiments, they observed that the flake-like MnO2 nanostructures were more suitable for capacitors than the wire-like nanostructures.
In fact, besides carbon materials and metal oxides, many other materials such as SnWO4, Nb2O5, and SrTiO3 can also be combined with biomolecular nanostructures to improve the performance of supercapacitors,242–244 which should be investigated further.

4.5. Catalysis applications
The efficiency of chemical synthesis can be promoted by catalytic reactions.245 As a substance that can change the reaction rate of reactants, the catalyst plays an important role in the modern chemical industry. Nowadays, catalysts are mainly developed towards green chemistry. Combining self-assembled biomolecules with other materials is an alternative way to obtain effective catalysts. In this section, we mainly focus on electrocatalysis and hydrogenation catalysis with bioinspired nanomaterials.

4.5.1. Electrocatalysis. 
Based on the abundant information and simple structure of amino acids, self-assembled peptides are beneficial for the construction of catalysts. Considering the catalysis of metal ions, self-assembled metallocatalysts can be obtained by self-assembled peptides via non-covalent interactions.246 Reback et al.247 synthesized an electrocatalyst based on a structured peptide outer coordination sphere. The peptide-based metal complex with added nickel provided a scaffold for a high efficiency electrocatalyst, which greatly enhanced the electrochemical activity. It can be found that most amino acid residues can be tailored to control the local hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and dielectric environments around active sites. Compared with the enzyme, this catalyst not only transformed electrons more efficiently, but also had higher catalytic efficiency.
In addition to nickel, Pt nanocomposites are also beneficial for developing new green energy materials. For example, Manivannan et al. utilized the M13 virus (M13) as a scaffold to fabricate an electrocatalyst for energy applications.248 Given the biocompatibility, low cost production and high stability of M13, it can be used as a biological template for designing bioactive catalysts. They designed 4E peptide-engineered M13 (M134E) for the bioinspired formation of Pt4E nanostructures by electrochemical co-deposition (Fig. 23a). The strong cation binding ability of peptides promoted the nucleation and growth of Pt4E as well as the catalytic activity of bioinspired nanomaterials. They also evaluated the electrocatalytic activity of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with ITO/Pt4E electrodes at different concentrations of M134E, as shown in Fig. 23b. It can be seen from the comparison that the ITO/Pt4E electrode had the strongest electrocatalytic activity at a concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1 M134E, and the catalytic efficiency was also greatly improved in the presence of 0.1 M CH3OH in 0.1 M KOH. Besides, the electrocatalyst had outstanding sensitivity and stability.

Peptide-based nanomaterials can combine with not only a single metal, but also bimetallic NPs for electrocatalysis. Li and co-workers prepared an AuPd catalyst based on the peptide sequence (FIgA3) for catalysis applications.249 It was found that the bioinspired Au33Pd67 exhibited good catalytic activity and the peptide-enabled approach was a great choice for the fabrication of electrocatalysts.
By using the ferritin protein, Wei et al. demonstrated the self-assembly of ferritin on RGO and the subsequent biomimetic synthesis of FePt bimetallic NPs in the core of ferritin.250 The obtained GN–FePt nanohybrids exhibited multi-functions like high water solubility, ferromagnetism, fluorescence, and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.


4.5.2. Hydrogenation catalysis. 
The hydrogenation catalysis, one of the most important catalysis reactions in industrial production, has been widely studied. The targets of improvement are catalytic efficiency and catalytic activity. At present, many new types of hydrogenation catalysts have been developed, such as nitrodoped porous carbon (NPC) materials. However, there are some difficulties in selecting the hydrogenated target functional groups, and the by-products can be easily produced in complex reactions.251 In fact, introducing biomolecules into metal complexes is a potential efficient method for hydrogenation catalysts.
For example, Jain et al. synthesized a peptide-based metal complex through a bottom-up approach.252 This kind of catalyst contained a peptide-based outer-coordination sphere, which can accelerate the catalytic efficiency. The designed peptide had a helical structure, which was extended away from the active site, as shown in Fig. 23c. Besides, peptides can be freely changed in the 3D space of metals, and the catalyst can be recycled and reused. The significance of this synthesis method was that it integrated the characteristics of enzymes and promoted the development of molecular catalysts.
Nanomaterial-based catalysts also play an indispensable role in the hydrogenation reaction, which promotes the energy-related applications of various materials. By studying how the molecular substrate structure affected the activity of peptide-templated Pd nanomaterials, Pacardo et al. investigated the applications of peptide-templated Pd nanomaterials in the hydrogenation reaction and found that the proposed peptide–Pd material was suitable for the energy-efficient catalysis,253 as shown in Fig. 23d. The obtained results indicated that the isomer formation, material structure, substrate molecular size, and composition influenced the reaction activity of the final bioinspired nanomaterials. In short, biomolecule-based catalysts play important roles in promoting sustainable energy production and protecting the environment.

5. Environmental applications
Bioinspired nanomaterials exhibited potential for environmental applications, such as the purification of waste water and polluted air, as well as the monitoring of pollutants in the environment. In this part, we would like to present recent advances of biomolecular self-assembled bioinspired nanomaterials in these aspects.
5.1. Water purification
Water purification includes the removal of dyes, pathogenic microorganisms, and toxic metal ions from water systems.

5.1.1. Removing dyes. 
Dyes in many industries include the use of textiles, foams, cosmetics, paper, printing materials, plastics, pharmaceuticals, foods and other products in color.254–256 This color cover affects the penetration of sunlight into water and the solubility of gas in water, and it also inhibits the growth of aquatic organisms. Therefore, it is very important to remove these toxic dyes from waste water.
Self-assembled peptide hydrogels have been used in waste water purification. For example, Banerjee et al. developed a new class of hydrogels based on synthetic self-assembling of N-terminally Boc-protected tripeptides.257 A series of tripeptides have been synthesized to study their self-assembly behavior in an aqueous medium. It was found that three peptides formed thermo-reversible translucent gels at basic pH (pH 11.5–13.5). These hydrogels can be potentially utilized for the treatment of waste water and the organic dyes (rhodamine B, reactive blue 4 and direct red 80). In addition, the obtained peptide hydrogels can be recovered easily just by changing the pH of the medium. In a further study, they found that a strong hydrogel can be fabricated from a short peptide-based molecule in PBS at pH 7.46.258 The obtained hydrogel exhibited an entangled nanofibrous network structure and can be used for the removal of both cationic and anionic toxic organic dyes (brilliant blue, Congo red, malachite green, and rhodamine B). It should be noted that only a small amount of hydrogel was required (less than 1 mg mL−1) to prepare this hydrogel, and the formed hydrogel could be reused three times for dye adsorption. Their studies indicated the importance of bioinspired hydrogel materials towards the purification of waste water. In another case, Reddy et al. investigated the synthesis of pH-controlled ambidextrous hydrogels and organogels through the co-assembly of several fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-functionalized amino acids and peptides.259 It was found that the formed hydrogels exhibited potential applications in removing methyl red from water with a quick response (60% in 5 min) and high efficiency (75% in 42 h).
Besides hydrogels, peptide-based organogels and xerogels have been also used for water purification. For instance, Koley and Pramanik investigated the formation of multilayer vesicles, nanotubes, and organogels by controlling the self-assembly of two terminally protected tripeptides.260 They found that the formation of various nano- and microstructures through self-assembly is related to the solution polarity (Fig. 24a). To explore the removal of hazardous toxic dyes from waste water, the xerogels were prepared in chloroform and used for the adsorption of rhodamine B, and it was found that most of the dyes were adsorbed to the xerogels after 24 h and the UV-vis test indicated that a maximum amount of rhodamine B adsorbed by the obtained xerogels was about 5.24 mg g−1, as shown in Fig. 24b. In addition, the formed mesoporous materials prepared in toluene exhibited high performance for adsorbing I2 vapor (Fig. 24c). After 24 h of adsorption, the synthesized peptide materials without a porous structure changed the color from white to yellow (top image of Fig. 24c); however the mesoporous materials exhibited a color change from white to dark-brown (bottom image), indicating the uniform and higher adsorption ability of porous materials. In another study, Kar et al. demonstrated the fabrication of the hydrogel and xerogel through the self-assembly of a low molecular mass PA molecule.261 It was found that the designed PA molecule exhibited high ability to form gels in a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and chloroform via noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding, π–π interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and van der Waals interaction. The adsorption of crystal violet (CV) with the synthesized peptide xerogel indicated the quick and effective removal of dyes. After 10 h, more than 95% dyes were removed and the adsorbed amount of CV in 24 h was about 8.4 mg g−1 by UV-vis measurement.

The self-assembly of biomolecules in the presence of a metal and other kinds of nanoscale building blocks is also a possible way to produce functional hybrid nanomaterials for removing dyes from water. For instance, Pu and co-workers demonstrated the synthesis of metal–biomolecule 2D frameworks by controlling the self-assembly of DL-glutamic acid–copper ion hybrid building blocks.262 It was found that the self-assembly of this supramolecular nanofibers can be tuned by adjusting the chirality of the used ligands, proving the possibility to produce uniform 1D and 2D nanomaterials for removing anionic dyes like Congo red from water. Cheng et al. investigated the formation of the polydopamine (PDA)-assembled graphene aerogel for removing dyes, and found that the graphene-based aerogel exhibited outstanding performance (89 to 380 mg g−1 towards different dyes) on adsorbing organic dyes from water.263 In another case, Li et al. synthesized 3D flower-like self-assembled hybrid nanocomposites with copper phosphate, laccase, GO, and CNTs via a facile one-pot strategy under mild conditions.264 The prepared enzyme-inspired nanocomposites exhibited excellent removal efficiency for water-soluble dyes.


5.1.2. Removing pathogenic microorganisms. 
Pathogenic microorganisms exist in surface water and groundwater, which mainly include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. There are as many as 700 viruses in water that can cause diseases such as diarrhea, fever, and hepatitis. Compared with conventional nanomaterials, bioinspired nanomaterials have high chemical activity due to their special physical and chemical properties such as good biocompatibility and large specific surface area. These special properties make bioinspired nanomaterials have good photocatalysis, adsorption, reduction, and sterilization, and have excellent effects on the removal of pathogenic microorganisms from water.
Miller et al. demonstrated the synthesis of colistin-functionalized AuNPs for the rapid capture of Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative bacterium.265 To achieve this aim, AuNPs were conjugated with colistin by using PEG as a linker via a two-step self-assembly process. The obtained colistin–PEG–AuNP hybrid nanomaterials revealed quick (in 7 min) and effective adsorption of Acinetobacter baumannii.
Hassan et al. prepared thin film membranes for removing E. coli bacteria from water by using palm fruit stalk cellulose nanofibers (CNF), oxidized carbon nanofibers, and activated carbon (Fig. 25a).266 The prepared hybrid membrane showed high capability for removing E. coli bacteria (rejection similar to 96–99%) and high resistance against the growth of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. In another case, Trang et al. prepared antibody-conjugated Fe3O4–Ag@APTES hetero-nanocomposites by utilizing a two-step synthetic technique consisting of co-precipitation and a subsequent hydrothermal reaction,267 followed by the functionalization steps with APTES and the antibody against Salmonella enteritidis (Fig. 25b). Due to the use of a specific antibody, the developed Fe3O4–Ag@APTES@SE–Ab conjugates are capable of selectively capturing Salmonella enteritidis at a low concentration (10 CFU mL−1). Moreover, the prepared magnetic materials revealed high efficiency (91.36% in 20 min) to remove Salmonella enteritidis from water solution.

5.1.3. Removing toxic metal ions. 
Bioinspired 1D peptide nanofibers can be used in heavy metal ion detection and remediation. For instance, Knerr and co-workers found that a twenty-residue peptide could be used to bind with monomethylarsonic acid, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ or Hg2+, which promoted the conformation transition of the peptide into an amphiphilic β-hairpin for the subsequent self-assembly formation to peptide nanofibers.268 The binding of peptide molecules with metal ions in a 1:1 stoichiometry was proved, which demonstrated the possibility to form functional hydrogels for the adsorption of metal ions.
The membrane separation technology has shown a few advantages of small occupation area, convenient operation and management, high efficiency, and no secondary pollution for water purification. Bioinspired 2D nanomaterials have also been used for removing metal ions from water. For instance, Mezzenga et al. reported inexpensive bioinspired hybrid membranes for removing heavy metal ions from water,269 which were made from self-assembled amyloid protein fibrils and activated porous carbon, as shown in Fig. 26a. It was found that the concentration of heavy metal ions was reduced by three to five orders of magnitude per passage during the adsorption process. In addition, the obtained 2D hybrid membranes can be reused after post treatment by thermally reducing the adsorbed ions in the membranes. It is very interesting to note that a single-crystal Au film was produced by the chemical reduction of gold ions that adsorbed on the hybrid membranes. Recently, Yu and co-workers have reported the fabrication of the AuNC–embedded protein nanofiber–graphene hybrid membranes for detecting and separating Hg2+ in water.270 The as-prepared BSA nanofibers were covalently assembled on the surface of graphene and then AuNCs were formed by the chemical reduction of gold ions on the surface of nanofibers. The prepared hybrid AuNC–nanofiber–graphene membranes exhibited excellent selectivity and highly-efficient separation performance (94%) toward Hg2+.

Banerjee prepared a strong hydrogel from a short peptide-based molecule in PBS at pH 7.46, which can be used for the removal of Co2+ and Ni2+.258 Moreover, this hydrogel can be reused for the absorption of metal ions.
Magnetic adsorbents have the advantages of fast adsorption speed, large adsorption capacity and easy recycling. Recently, Dinari et al. have reported the facile and green synthesis of magnetic Fe3O4@layered double hydroxide (LDH)@guar gum bionanocomposites (GLF-BNCs) for water purification applications.271 To achieve this aim, magnetic Fe3O4 NPs were first coated with LDH via electrostatic interaction, and then guar gum was conjugated to Fe3O4–LDH via an in situ growth method, as shown in Fig. 26b. The obtained GLF-BNCs revealed high ability to remove Cd2+ from aqueous solutions with an adsorption capacity of 258 mg g−1. In addition, the obtained GLF-BNCs exhibited a quick response towards the adsorption of Cd2+ (in 5 min), proving the potential applications of this bioinspired magnetic material in highly effective and economical water treatments.

5.2. Air purification
In recent years, with the increase of the global greenhouse effect, new materials capable of combining carbon dioxide (CO2) are crucial for combating climate change. Biomolecular self-assembly makes it possible for producing CO2 capture materials for air purification applications. For instance, Li and co-workers for the first time reported that a hexapeptide sequence (VQIVYK) from the Tau protein can self-assemble to amyloid fibers for the selective capture of carbon.272 It can be found that the amyloid fibers containing alkylamine groups bind CO2 reversibly via carbamate formation. Thermodynamic and kinetic capture-and-release tests show that the carbamate formation rate is fast enough to capture CO2 by dynamic separation. This kind of amyloid nanofiber in powdered form can capture CO2 strongly in the presence of water and release the captured CO2 under heating, indicating regenerated materials with a high energy efficient process.
In a further study, they demonstrated a structure-based method to utilize the atomic structures of amyloid peptides to design functional self-assembled amyloid materials for capturing CO2.273 Peptide nanofibers based on three proteins, insulin (LVEALYL), α-synuclein (TGVTAVA), and amyloid β protein (KLVFFA), were designed with the self-assembly of structure-tuned peptide sequences. The structural and property characterization proved the formation of designed amyloid nanofibers, as shown in Fig. 27a. The dynamic CO2 binding capacity of the designed peptide nanofibers were measured by breakthrough experiments and it was found that the designed LKQALKL, VKAVAK, and KLVFFAK nanofibers exhibited double capacity of the VQIVYK nanofibers (Fig. 27b).

Automobile emissions are composed of NOx and unburned hydrocarbon that contribute significantly to major environmental and health issues. Radhakrishnan and co-workers synthesized natural absorbents based on the cross-linking and self-assembly of Moringa oleifera pod powder and calcium alginate, which exhibited high ability to reduce the emission gas concentrations of vehicular exhaust.274 The maximum biosorption capacity was found to be 14.45 and 123.51 mg g−1 for HC and NOx, respectively.
Weiss et al. utilized a bottom-up strategy to tailor the formation of supramolecular nanofibers through the self-assembly of 1,3,5-benzenetrisamide polymers, which were formed in situ inside the viscose/polyester microfiber nonwovens.275 The fabricated nanofiber-based filter revealed high filtration efficiencies to remove more than 95% particles of 0.2 μm, offering high potential for air filtration applications.
5.3. Environmental monitoring
Besides the purification of water and air, the detection of pollutants (such as pesticide residues, pathogenic microorganisms, and heavy metal ions) in water is of great practical significance for environmental monitoring and human health. In this section, we would like to present the monitoring of these pollutants with bioinspired nanomaterials.

5.3.1. Monitoring pesticide residues. 
Sun et al. fabricated a highly sensitive amperometric biosensor based on the modification of a glassy carbon electrode with chitosan and chitosan-adsorbed hollow gold nanospheres.276 Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was immobilized on the modified electrode for specific binding of pesticide residues. Under optimum conditions, the fabricated AChE-based biosensors exhibited linear detection ranges of 0.1–150 and 0.1–200 μg L−1 as well as detection limits of 0.06 and 0.08 μg L−1 for chlorpyrifos and carbofuran, respectively. In addition, the control experiments with practical tests proved that the fabricated biosensors could be used for the trace detection of pesticide residues in both vegetables and fruits effectively.
In another case, Chen and co-workers fabricated an enzymatic biosensor by self-assembling the AChE enzyme on the top surface of film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs),277 which mediate the specific binding of organophosphorus pesticides. The fabricated biosensor exhibited linear responses, simple operation, good reproducibility, and a remarkable detection limit (43 pM) for monitoring ethyl para-nitro-phenyl solution. This novel biosensor could be useful for monitoring a wide variety of biological reactions such as antigen–antibody, protein–ligand, DNA hybridization, and others.


5.3.2. Detection of pathogenic microorganisms. 
The microbial safety of drinking water constitutes a major concern in all countries at all levels of economic development. Therefore, developing rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective methods for detecting pathogenic bacteria like E. coli is highly required.
Based on the FRET technique, Song et al. developed a biosensor for detecting Salmonella enteritidis by using the self-assembly of nicking enzymes on CNTs.278 It was found that the fabricated biosensor exhibited a linear relationship with the concentration of Salmonella enteritidis from 102 to 3 × 103 CFU mL−1 in water and from 1.5 × 102 to 3 × 103 CFU mL−1 in milk. In another case, Jin and co-workers developed an aptasensor platform for the rapid, ultrasensitive, and specific detection of bacteria based on DNA–aptamer interaction, where AuNPs were conjugated with aptamers and the upconversion NPs were functionalized with the corresponding complementary DNA.279 The fabricated aptasensor exhibited a linear detection range of 5–106 CFU mL−1 with a detection limit of 3 CFU mL−1 for E. coli ATCC 8739 (a model analyte).
You et al. developed a rapid and highly sensitive method for the visible detection of bacteria in real matrices based on the aggregation of AuNPs without requiring any readout device.280 AuNPs were functionalized with streptavidin and the anti-bacteria antibody was biotinylated first. Due to the specific streptavidin–biotin recognition, the aggregation of AuNPs was induced through a molecule–molecule interaction inspired self-assembly process, causing the color change due to the SPR effect, as shown in Fig. 28a. By varying the used amount of streptavidin–AuNP, the detection limit of the fabricated sensor can reach 10 CFU mL−1 for E. coli and Salmonella. In another case, Wen and co-workers developed a decomposable QD/DNA nanosphere probe based on the self-assembly of streptavidin-conjugated QDs and the Y-shaped DNA nanostructure,281 which can be used for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of extracellular respiring bacteria (ERB) (Fig. 28b). This QD/DNA nanosphere-based fluorescent immunoassay is ultrasensitive for the model ERB (Shewanella oneidensis), presenting a wide detection range of 1.0–1.0 × 108 CFU mL−1 with a low detection limit of 1.37 CFU mL−1. In addition, the proposed fluorescent immunoassay exhibits high specificity, acceptable reproducibility, good stability, and high potential for the practical monitoring of Salmonella enteritidis in river water.

5.3.3. Monitoring heavy metal ions. 
In this section, the monitoring of heavy metal ions with bioinspired nanomaterials will be introduced and discussed from three main analytical techniques, electrochemical, fluorescent, and colorimetric monitoring.
5.3.3.1. Electrochemical monitoring. 
Electrochemical methods play an important role in the field of detection of heavy metal ions due to their excellent low detection limit, low cost, and simple operation.
Wu et al. developed an electrochemical sensor for the sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ based on target-induced structure-switching DNA.282 To mediate the specific binding of Hg2+, a 33-merDNA aptamer was bound to the electrode surface via self-assembly, which leads to the formation of the T–Hg2+–T complex in the presence of Hg2+.283 The fabricated sensor exhibited a sensitive response to Hg2+ in a concentration range from 0.1 nM to 5 μM with a detection limit of 60 pM. Chen and co-workers developed a signal amplification method based on methylene blue and nicking endonuclease (NEase) for Hg2+ detection.284 Under optimum conditions, this assay achieved a detection limit of 8.7 × 10−11 M (S/N = 3). Miao et al. reported an electrochemical biosensor for Hg2+ detection by using the DNA-based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) coupled with positively charged Ag@Au core–shell nanoparticle (Ag@Au CSNP) amplification.285 Under optimal conditions, such a sensor presents good electrochemical responses for Hg2+ detection with a detection limit of 3.6 pM.
Bioinspired nanomaterials can also be used for the electrochemical detection of other metal ions. Willner's group reported the combination of the hemin/G-quadruplex nanostructure and the Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme to develop a sensitive SPR sensor for Pb2+.286 This method enables the sensing of Pb2+ ions with a detection limit down to 5 fM. Zhuo et al. designed an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescent sensor for the detection of Pb2+ based on target cycling amplification and a 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride derivative functionalized signal probe.287 The sensor had a good linear response to Pb2+ concentration in the range of 1 pM to 1 μM with a detection limit of 1 pM. Zhang et al. described an amplified detection strategy employing nanoporous Au and AuNPs to detect Pb2+ ions in aqueous solution.288 The thiol modified Pb2+-specific DNAzyme was self-assembled on the surface of the nanoporous Au-modified electrode for hybridizing with the AuNP-labelled oligonucleotide and for forming the DNA double helix structure. The fabricated electrochemical sensor could detect Pb2+ in the concentration range of 0.05–100 nM quantitatively with a detection limit of 12 pM.
Viguier et al. described the combination of self-assembled peptide nanofibrils with metal electrodes for the development of an electrochemical sensor of Cu2+.289 The obtained peptide nanofibrils were assembled on gold electrodes as biorecognition elements for complexation with Cu2+. The response of the obtained biosensor was linear up to 50 μM Cu2+. In addition, the fabricated sensor could be regenerated to a copper-free state allowing its reutilization.
5.3.3.2. Fluorescent monitoring. 
Compared with the traditional detection methods, fluorescent sensors have the advantages of high sensitivity, good selectivity, and simple fabrication. Fluorescence analysis, especially fluorescent probe detection, has been widely used in the detection of heavy metal ions with bioinspired nanomaterials.
Guo et al. developed a simple, selective and sensitive turn-on fluorescent sensor for the detection of Hg2+ using Sybr Green I as the signal reporter and aptamer–SWCNT as the quencher (Fig. 29a).290 The obtained fluorescent sensor showed a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of Hg2+ was observed in the range of 20–1250 nM with a detection limit of 7.9 nM. Zhang et al. developed a highly sensitive, selective, and reusable fluorescent sensor with photonic crystal (PC) films for Hg2+ detection,291 based on the Bragg reflection of PCs and formation of the T–Hg2+–T complex (Fig. 29b). The detection limit for Hg2+ was calculated to be 4 nM, and the sensor could be easily regenerated and reused by decoupling the T–Hg2+–T base pairs using cysteine.

To detect Pb2+, Zhao et al. developed a turn-on fluorescent sensor based on xylenol orange (XO)-functionalized CdSe/CdS QDs for the determination of Pb2+.292 CdSe/CdS QDs were first modified by mercaptoacetic acid (MAA), and then capped with chitosan and negatively charged XO. The XO-functionalized QDs were formed via layer-by-layer self-assembly. The fluorescence of the QDs was quenched by the electron transfer mechanism after XO was bound to the QDs. Upon the addition of Pb2+, a dramatic enhancement of the fluorescence intensity was observed, which resulted from the coordination between Pb2+ and XO on the QD surface and the disruption of the electron transfer mechanism. The fabricated turn on fluorescent Pb2+ sensor revealed a linear detection range of 0.05 to 6 μM with a detection limit of 0.02 μM.
He and co-workers demonstrated a novel, sensitive, and promising assay for fluorescence sensing of Cu2+ in aqueous solutions based on FRET between Au nanorods and the DNAzyme.293 The proposed sensor showed high sensitivity toward Cu2+ with a detection limit of 9.83 pM and a linear range of 0.016 to 40 nM.
5.3.3.3. Colorimetric monitoring. 
In recent years, colorimetric sensors have been established for the rapid detection of heavy metal ions with the naked eye or UV-vis spectroscopy. For example, Mashhadizadeh et al. reported a DNA spectrophotometric biosensor for monitoring Hg2+ by using the self-assembly of oligonucleotides on the AuNP surface and the subsequent Hg2+-induced T–T mismatching.294 The UV-vis spectrum analysis indicated a linear correlation between the absorption peak of methylene blue and the concentration of Hg2+ over the range from 10 nM to 10 μM with a detection limit of 6 nM. In another study, Memon and co-workers demonstrated the fabrication of a colorimetric Hg2+ sensor by using DNA oligonucleotides and AuNPs as indicators.295 In the presence of Hg2+, the formation of the T–Hg2+–T complex inhibited the aggregation of AuNPs after adding salt (Fig. 30a). Based on this DNA mismatching method, the fabricated sensor showed a linear detection range of 50 to 300 nM with a detection limit of 15 nM.

To monitor Pb2+, Li et al. fabricated a colorimetric Pb2+ sensor by using an electrospun polyamide-6/nitrocellulose nanofiber/net (PA-6/NC NFN) membrane as a platform and a BSA–AuNP composite as a probe (B–Au probe) (Fig. 30b).296 In their work, the PA-6/NC NFN membrane was firstly prepared by a dual-component alternate distribution multi-jet electrospinning which contains PA-6 and NC. Then the B–Au probe was prepared by mixing BSA and AuNP solution and shaking at room temperature. Finally, the B–Au probe was immobilized on the PA-6/NC NFN membrane surface and immersed in glycine–NaOH buffer and Na2S2O3 solution to detect Pb2+. The existence of Pb atoms in the redox process of Pb2+ promoted the aggregation of AuNPs, causing the color change from deep pink to white. Furthermore, the colorimetric sensor exhibited good selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.
Ge and co-workers developed a colorimetric sensor for Cu2+ by using the metal ion-induced folding of DNAzyme.297 In this case, a G-quadruplex-forming sequence was firstly prepared via the cycloaddition reaction of two short G-rich sequences by adding Cu2+ and sodium ascorbate. Then the G-quadruplex-forming sequence and hemin could self-assemble into the hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme complex in solution, which can catalyze TMB from colorless to blue with after adding H2O2. Hence, the whole process can be utilized to monitor and detect Cu2+ with good selectivity and a low detection limit.

6. Conclusions and outlook
Based on the above introduction and discussion, it can be concluded that biomolecular self-assembly is a facile strategy to produce biological nanomaterials with adjustable shapes and sizes. The biomolecular self-assembly is related to intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, π–π, and other interactions. To promote these interactions and the self-assembly formation of various nanostructures like biological NPs, nanowires, nanofibers, nanosheets, and hydrogels, some effective strategies by tailoring the molecular structure, adjusting the pH, ionic strength, and temperature, and adding organic and enzymatic stimulators could be utilized.
Biomolecules and their self-assembled superstructures exhibited excellent abilities to produce functional hybrid nanomaterials based on bioinspired and biomimetic synthesis strategies. The molecule–molecule interaction strategy is the most important method to inspire the formation of functional hybrid nanomaterials, which could be achieved through several typical interactions such as antigen–antibody, protein–protein, peptide–peptide, protein–peptide, DNA hybridization, and other interactions. With special molecular properties, some hybrid nanomaterials could be fabricated by using the molecule–material recognition strategy. For example, the specific binding between DNA and peptide molecules with carbon nanomaterials (CNTs and graphene) made it possible to synthesize a lot of functional hybrid nanomaterials for wide applications. In addition, biomolecules have the functions to mediate the bioinspired synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials by “green” growth and chemical reduction/oxidation.
Biomolecular self-assembly-inspired nanomaterials have shown great applications in energy and environmental fields. The bioinspired nanomaterials exhibited a few advantages like easy synthesis, adjustable structure, flexible tailoring of functions, and high performance, which promoted their potential applications in biofuel cells, light-harvesting systems, batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, water/air purification, and environmental monitoring.
Although a lot of achievements have been made in this interesting and growing research field, future studies could also be performed in these suggested aspects. Firstly, the structural design of biomolecules for controllable self-assembly could be performed further. The previous energy and environmental applications of bioinspired nanomaterials are mainly based on 1D biomolecular superstructures; however, very limited studies based on 2D and 3D superstructures have been reported. Therefore, the design of molecular sequences (especially DNA and peptide) with high potential for 2D and 3D structures is expected.
Secondly, the functional tailoring of biomolecular bioinspired nanomaterials should be done, which could be achieved via the fine-tuning design of biomolecules at the molecular level. For example, functional peptide sequences could be designed by motif-tailoring to mediate the specific interactions between molecules and molecules as well as between molecules and materials on the one hand, and on the other hand to inspire the growth and binding of the desired nanoscale building blocks (NPs, CNTs, and QDs). In addition, molecular dynamics simulations could be an ideal technique to prove the feasibility of molecular design.
Thirdly, more attention should be focused on the fabrication of 2D and 3D hybrid bioinspired nanomaterials for energy applications. For instance, self-assembled peptide nanomaterials can be used for light-harvesting systems, especially solar cells. Metal oxides like SnWO4, Nb2O5, and SrTiO3 are expected to combine with biomolecular superstructures to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Hybrid nanomaterials based on biomolecular self-assembly and bioinspired synthesis of transition metal (Co, Fe, Ni, Mn) oxides/sulfides/nitrides/phosphides for high-performance catalytic hydrogen production (hydrogen evolution reaction) are also highly desired. In addition, self-assembled highly ordered PNF and PNW nanomaterials for piezoelectric and triboelectric energy generators could be further studied. Previously, only a few studies on the fabrication of power generators by using self-assembled peptide nanostructures have been reported.298,299
Fourthly, environmental applications of bioinspired nanomaterials should be developed. For instance, biomolecular superstructures like 2D networks/films and 3D hydrogels could be used to inspire the formation of porous minerals (hydroxyapatite or CaCO3) to improve the adsorption performance of metal ions, and the combination of biomolecular superstructures with graphene could be used to produce hybrid hydrogels and aerogels for removing dyes effectively. In addition, it is expected to design functional biomolecules, control biomolecular self-assembly, and combine with metal NPs to fabricate colorimetric and spectrometric sensors, which could be advantageous to monitor pollutants in waste water systems easily with portable instruments like UV-vis and Raman spectrometers.
Fifthly but not finally, based on the light-harvesting properties, it is possible to use bioinspired nanomaterials for light-guided drug delivery and photothermal therapy of tumors. The 2D and 3D biomolecular superstructure-based nanomaterials with improved therapy efficiency are highly expected.
