    , Accepted 18th August 2019First published on 19th August 2019AbstractFour novel porphyrin dyes XW48–XW51 with a doubly strapped porphyrin framework and judicious optimization of the substituents of the phenothiazine donor have been synthesized and utilized as DSSC dyes. On the basis of XW40, bulky 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl groups were incorporated into the phenothiazine donor by replacing the hexyl, 4-hexyloxyphenyl and both of them, to afford XW48, XW49 and XW50, respectively. On the basis of XW50, XW51 was synthesized by using 2,4-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl in place of the 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl units. As a result, the Voc values were enhanced stepwisely from 730 mV (XW40) to ca. 750 mV (XW48/XW49) and then to 761 mV (XW50). Compared with XW50, XW51 contains a bulky donor with more evenly distributed alkoxyl chains, which tend to form a more compact self-assembled monolayer to impede the penetration of I3−. Hence, an extraordinarily high Voc of 781 mV was achieved for XW51. As a result, the efficiency was dramatically improved to 11.1%, which is the highest efficiency for DSSCs based on an individual sensitizer using the iodine electrolyte, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, high efficiencies of 10.1% and 9.7% were also obtained for XW50 and XW51, respectively, based on the cobalt electrolyte.
Introduction
The increasing consumption of fossil energy resources accompanied by the ongoing rapid development of industry and economy has encouraged increasing research on alternative energy. In this respect, solar energy has stimulated worldwide attention due to its superiority in sustainability, environmental friendliness, global availability and so on.1–3 The emergence of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has dramatically promoted the development of photovoltaic technology with inexpensive production cost and easy fabrication.4–7 Since the landmark work reported by Grätzel et al. in 1991,8 remarkable progress has been achieved in the past two decades.9–14 As a key component of DSSCs, sensitizers with the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration exhibit outstanding ability in light harvesting and power conversion.15–19 Among them, porphyrins and their derivatives are promising candidates with the advantages of facile structural modification, strongly absorbing Soret bands (400–450 nm), moderately absorbing Q bands (550–650 nm) and outstanding redox properties.6,20,21
Excellent light-harvesting ability of sensitizers in a broad wavelength range is particularly essential for achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of DSSCs.22,23 Hence, the sensitizers are usually designed with extended π conjugation frameworks and strengthened intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) by using suitable donors and acceptors.24,25 However, such approaches often lead to severe dye-aggregation and low electron-injection efficiency.7,26 To overcome such drawbacks, bulky substituents have been incorporated into the dye backbones to effectively suppress dye aggregation. In 2010, Hupp and co-workers first wrapped the porphyrin macrocycle with four dodecoxyl chains.27 Inspired by this strategy, many sensitizers with superior photovoltaic performance have been developed.9,28–30
As far as the donor is concerned, many sensitizers based on carbazole,13 indoline,31 triphenylamine,32,33 thiophene34 and perylene29 have been developed for fabricating DSSCs with high efficiencies. In comparison with them, phenothiazine (PTZ), a heteroanthracene moiety containing two electron-rich heteroatoms—nitrogen and sulfur, exhibits strong electron-donating ability and superior anti-aggregation character due to its butterfly-like configuration. These features ensure its application as a promising donor candidate for developing efficient sensitizers. Indeed, a number of sensitizers based on the PTZ donor have been developed with high photovoltaic performance.12,36–39 However, the inherent potential of PTZ-based donors is yet to be further realized through systematic structural optimization. Recently, we reported a PTZ donor based dye XW10, with the porphyrin framework wrapped with four dodecoxyl chains, which exhibited an efficiency of 8.6%.12 On this basis, we further developed an effective novel strategy of doubly strapping the porphyrin macrocycle to further suppress the dye aggregation. As a result, an enhanced efficiency of 9.3% was achieved for the doubly strapped dye XW40.35 With the purpose to further suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination between the injected electrons and I3−/cations. Herein XW48–XW51 have been designed and synthesized by systematically varying the substituents on the PTZ unit (Chart 1). As a result, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) have been gradually improved from 730 mV for XW40 to a high value of 780 mV for XW51 based on the iodine electrolyte. Finally, a photovoltaic efficiency over 11% has been achieved for XW51 based on the iodine electrolyte without resorting to any cosensitizer or coadsorbent. In addition, a cobalt-based electrolyte has also been employed to afford an efficiency of 9.7% for XW51, which is comparable to 9.7% obtained for the benchmark dye SM371,9 but slightly lower than that of 10.1% obtained for XW50 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the combination of a bulky phenothiazine donor containing alkoxyl substituents in different distribution modes with a doubly strapped porphyrin framework is an effective approach for developing efficient DSSCs based on either the iodine or the cobalt electrolyte.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the dyes
The synthetic routes to the porphyrin dyes XW48–XW51 are illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, 1a, 1b and 1c were synthesized according to the procedures modified from previous reports.40 Then, Suzuki coupling reactions of 1a–1c and subsequent Sonogashira reactions afforded the corresponding ethynyl derivatives of phenothiazine, 3a–3d. Finally, successive Sonogashira coupling reactions of the doubly strapped porphyrin ZnPBr2 (ref. 35) with 3a–3d and methyl 4-ethynylbenzoate, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting esters, afforded the target sensitizers XW48–XW51.

Reaction conditions: (i) for 2a, 2b and 2d: (2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl)boronic acid/(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)boronic acid/(2,4-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl)boronic acid, Pd(PPh3)4, THF, 2 M K2CO3, reflux, overnight; for 2c: (2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl)boronic acid, SPhos, K3PO4, Pd2(dba)3, dry toluene, reflux, overnight; (ii) TMSA, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI, PPh3, THF/piperidine, reflux; then 1 M TBAF, THF/MeOH; (iii) 3a–3d, Pd2(dba)3, AsPh3, THF/Et3N, 55 °C; (iv) methyl 4-ethynylbenzoate, Pd2(dba)3, AsPh3, THF/Et3N, 65 °C; (v) LiOH·H2O, THF/H2O, 55 °C. 
Spectral properties
The absorption and emission spectra of the sensitizers XW48–XW51 were recorded in THF (Fig. 1 and S1†), and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. All four dyes exhibit the characteristic absorption of a typical porphyrin dye: a sharp Soret band around 460 nm and less intense Q bands in the longer wavelength region (600–700 nm). XW48 exhibits almost identical absorption maxima to the reference dye XW40, indicating that the 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl and 4-hexyloxyphenyl units attached at the phenyl unit of the phenothiazine donor have a similar electronic effect. However, the Q band maxima of XW49 and XW50 are slightly red-shifted to 667 nm, relative to that of 664 nm observed for XW40, indicative of the stronger electron-donating ability of the 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl moiety than the hexyl moiety attached at the N atom of the phenothiazine donor.

The absorption spectra of XW48–XW51 anchored on 3 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 films were also recorded (Fig. S2†). Compared with the corresponding absorption spectra in THF, all the sensitizers exhibit obviously broadened absorption and red-shifted onset wavelengths on the films, which is favorable for light harvesting.
Electrochemical studies
To evaluate the electrochemical compatibility of the sensitizers with the redox shuttles and conduction band (CB) of TiO2, cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in acetonitrile (Fig. 2, Table 2, and Fig. S3†). The HOMO levels of XW48–XW51 were found to be more positive than that of I−/I3− (0.4 V vs. NHE) and Co(bpy)33+/2+ (0.56 V vs. NHE), indicating sufficient driving force for dye regeneration. On the other hand, the LUMO orbital levels of the dyes were calculated to be −0.95 to −0.97 V, more negative than the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicative of the thermodynamically favored electron injection from the excited state of the dyes to the CB of TiO2.

Theoretical calculations
To gain insight into the molecular structures as well as the influence of different substituents on the electron distribution, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level41–43 using the Gaussian 09 program package.44 As depicted in Fig. S4,† the LUMO orbitals of all four sensitizers are mainly delocalized on the porphyrin macrocyclic skeletons and the acceptor moieties. The HOMO orbitals mainly delocalize on the phenothiazine donors and the porphyrin macrocycles. The overlapping of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals on the porphyrin frameworks is beneficial for the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and subsequent injection into the conduction band of TiO2.
Photovoltaic performance
Photocurrent density–voltage curves (Fig. 3a) of the DSSCs employing XW48–XW51 as the sensitizers were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using the I−/I3− redox couple as the electrolyte (see Table 3). Through optimization of the substituents on the phenothiazine donor, all four dyes (XW48–XW51) exhibit improved efficiencies (9.5–11.1%), higher than that of XW40 (9.3%), as a consequence of the dramatically enhanced Voc. Compared with the respective hexyl and 4-hexyloxyphenyl groups attached at the N atom and the phenyl group of the phenothiazine moiety in dye XW40, both dyes XW48 and XW49 contain a more bulky 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl unit at one of these two positions, and thus the Voc values have been improved from 730 mV for XW40 to 755 and 753 mV for XW48 and XW49, respectively. Furthermore, XW50 contains two 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl units, and thus the Voc was further improved to 761 mV. These observations may be ascribed to the enhanced anti-aggregation abilities of the dyes after wrapping the PTZ donor with extra alkoxyl chains. XW51 also contains four hexyloxy chains at the PTZ donor, but the more evenly distributed chains and extended configuration are favorable for forming a more compact hydrophobic monolayer, and thus impede I3− from approaching the TiO2 films and suppress the recombination of the electrolyte with the electrons injected into the TiO2 film.45 As a result, the highest Voc of 781 mV was achieved for XW51. On the other hand, the variation in the donor has negligible effect on the dye loading amounts, and all the sensitizers feature similar absorption. Therefore, similar short-circuit current density (Jsc) values between 18.09 and 18.96 mA cm−2 were obtained for XW48–XW50. Notably, a highest Jsc value of 20.07 mA cm−2 was achieved for XW51, which is consistent with the IPCE spectra (vide infra) and may be interpretable by the small loss of injected electrons through charge recombination due to the superior anti-recombination ability of XW51.46 As a result, the highest efficiency of 11.1% was achieved for the individual XW51 dye based on the I−/I3− electrolyte. When chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was used as a coadsorbent, lowered photovoltaic performance was observed, which may be ascribed to the lowered dye loading amounts (Table S1†).

To further understand the photocurrents, the corresponding incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of XW40 and XW48–XW51 were recorded and are shown in Fig. 3b. All the dyes exhibit broad spectral responses between 300 and 770 nm, indicating their ability to efficiently convert the visible and near infra-red (NIR) light into photocurrent. The IPCE spectra of XW48–XW51 show only a slight difference from that of XW40 owing to their similar backbones and absorption spectra. Notably, the IPCE spectra of XW51 show a slightly higher plateau and a smaller valley around 550 nm than those of the other sensitizers. Consistently, the highest Jsc value of 20.07 mA cm−2 was achieved for XW51.
As we know, the cobalt-based electrolyte is superior than the I−/I3− redox shuttle in terms of achieving a higher Voc value because of the less overpotential for dye regeneration.4,47 Hence, a Co(bpy)33+/2+ based electrolyte was further employed with the purpose of obtaining higher Voc and efficiencies (Table 3 and Fig. S5†). As expected, all the DSSCs based on XW48–XW51 using the cobalt-based electrolyte exhibit higher Voc compared with their iodine electrolyte-based counterparts. However, decreased Jsc values were obtained for the cobalt electrolyte based DSSCs, which was due to the slow dye regeneration process induced by the low diffusion rate of the cobalt redox shuttle, as well as faster charge recombination resulting from the one-electron charge transfer mechanism.48 As a result of the contradictory variation trends of Voc and Jsc, efficiencies of 8.9%, 9.5%, 10.1% and 9.7% were achieved for XW48–XW51, respectively. In contrast to the DSSCs employing the iodine electrolyte, the cobalt based DSSCs sensitized with XW50 exhibit higher Jsc and efficiency compared with those of XW51. This result may be rationalized by the observation that obviously higher IPCE values in the Soret and Q bands regions and slightly lower IPCE responses between the two bands were observed for XW50, which may be ascribed to the better deaggregation effect49,50 of the four alkoxyl chains wrapping around the donor of XW50, compared with that of the extended alkoxyl chains in the donor of XW51. Notably, an efficiency of 10.1% was achieved for XW50, slightly higher than that of 9.7% obtained for the benchmark dye SM371 under the same conditions, but the efficiency obtained in this work for SM371 is much lower than the reported one of 12.0%,9 which may be ascribed to the different device fabrication procedures. These results indicate that XW48–XW51 may be used for fabricating efficient DSSCs based on either the iodine or the cobalt electrolyte.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
To gain insight into the variation of photovoltaic behavior of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark. As is known, the Voc of a DSSC represents the potential difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 (EF,n) and the redox electrolyte (EF,red). Since the redox electrolyte is fixed in the experiments, the alteration of Voc only originates from a shift of EF,n, which is affected by two main factors: (i) the position of the TiO2 conduction band, which could be inferred from the chemical capacitance (Cμ); (ii) the electron density in the semiconductor, which is related to the charge recombination resistance (RCT). Here, the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and charge transfer resistance (RCT) were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots of the cells with an appropriate equivalent circuit model.51 As shown in Fig. 4a, the logarithm values of Cμ increase linearly with the increase of forward bias and all the curves exhibit similar slopes. At a fixed forward bias, XW48–XW51 exhibit almost identical Cμ, which indicates negligible influence of the conduction band positions of TiO2 on the variation of Voc. Hence, the RCT was further obtained from the impedance spectroscopies (Fig. 4b), in which RCT is related to the recombination of I3− or cations with the electrons injected into the TiO2 film.51–54 At a given voltage bias, the RCT values lie in the order of XW49 < XW48 < XW50 < XW51, which is in good agreement with the increasing Voc trend. In addition, the electron lifetime (τ), another important parameter for DSSCs could be calculated from the equation of τ = Cμ·RCT (Fig. 4c), and the τ order is also in accordance with the order of the Voc values. Taking 750 mV bias for example, the τ values follow the order of XW49 (0.027 s) < XW48 (0.033 s) < XW50 (0.036 s) < XW51 (0.051 s). The larger RCT and longer electron lifetimes indicate more effective suppression of charge recombination between injected electrons and I3− or cations at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.28,55 As discussed above, it can be concluded that the introduction of additional alkoxyl chains into the phenothiazine donor can distinctly suppress the charge recombination rate, and the bulky donor in XW51 with evenly distributed alkoxyl chains exhibits a superior suppression effect to the wrapped donor in XW50, Therefore, XW51 exhibits a high Voc of 781 mV, dramatically higher than that of 730 mV obtained for XW50.

Photostability
Photostability under long-term sunlight soaking is a critical parameter for the practical applications of DSSCs.56,57 To evaluate the stability of the cells, the XW51 based DSSC with the best photovoltaic performance was subjected to a durability test for a period of 1000 h continuous full sunlight soaking at 60 °C. The recorded PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF indicate good photostability of the cells (Fig. 5). After 1000 h, the efficiency remained at 10.3%, higher than 90% of the initial value of 11.1%.

Conclusions
In summary, the strategy of suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination is an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In this work, various substituents were introduced into the phenothiazine donor of a doubly wrapped porphyrin dye XW40 to afford dyes XW48–XW51 for systematic research on the photo-electricity conversion efficiencies. Firstly, either the hexyl chain or the 4-hexyloxyphenyl unit attached respectively on the N atom and the phenyl unit of the phenothiazine donor was replaced with a bulky 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl moiety to afford XW48 and XW49, respectively, which exhibit an improved Voc of ca. 750 mV and enhanced efficiencies of 9.7% and 9.5%, respectively, higher than the corresponding values of 730 mV and 9.3% obtained for XW40. On this basis, XW50 was synthesized by replacing both the hexyl chain and the 4-hexyloxyphenyl unit in XW40 with the 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl units, and thus the efficiency was further improved to 10.1% with a higher Voc of 761 mV. On the basis of XW50, dye XW51 was synthesized by further adjusting the positions of the hexyloxy chains, and thus the phenothiazine donor was substituted with four evenly distributed alkoxyl chains. Thus, XW51 exhibits an impressive ability to suppress charge recombination. As a result, a high PCE of 11.1% was achieved for XW51 based on an iodine electrolyte without resorting to any cosensitizer or coadsorbent. Furthermore, efficiencies of 10.1% and 9.7% were also achieved for XW50 and XW51-based DSSCs, respectively, using a cobalt redox, and higher efficiencies may be achieved by further optimizing the device fabrication processes considering the relatively low efficiency of 9.7% obtained for the benchmark dye SM371 (ref. 9) in this work, which is under way in our lab. Considering the different efficiency variation trends of XW50 and XW51 obtained for the iodine and cobalt electrolytes, it may be concluded that different substitution modes of alkoxyl chains may be employed for designing sensitizers suitable for different electrolytes. These results compose a novel approach for developing efficient DSSCs by combining a bulky phenothiazine donor composed of alkoxyl substituents in different distribution modes with a doubly strapped porphyrin framework, which may be effective for both the iodine and the cobalt electrolytes.
