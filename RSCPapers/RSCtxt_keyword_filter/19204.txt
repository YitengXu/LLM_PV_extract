    , Accepted 4th November 2011First published on 25th November 2011AbstractA mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT [poly(3-hexylthiophene)] heterojunction solar cell displays reduced external quantum efficiency (EQE) at a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. This loss in EQE is due to incomplete charge carrier transport because the transportation of charge carriers generated in P3HT by the absorption of light into Sb2S3 was inefficient, and consequently, the carriers recombined. The depression of the EQE was greatly relieved by introducing the porous structure formed by thermal decomposition of 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) into the P3HT layer.
Introduction
Inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles and quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as promising alternatives for sensitizer to conventional dye-sensitized solar cells1 because of their excellent properties such as high extinction coefficient, convenient spectral tunability of the band gap, larger dipole moment, good stability, and multiple exciton generation.2,3 Hence, metal chalcogenide-based photovoltaic cells such as CdS,4,5CdSe,6–9 PbS,10–13PbSe,14,15 and Sb2S3 (ref. 16–19) have been intensively studied and these studies have resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency of these cells. Among the metal chalcogenides, Sb2S3 is very attractive as a sensitizer because of its high absorption coefficient (α = 105 cm−1) in the visible region and a suitable band gap of 1.7–1.9 eV.20–23 S. Nezu et al.17 have demonstrated that the Sb2S3-based photovoltaic cell with mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/Sb2S3/CuSCN as the photoanode/sensitizer/hole conductor attains a high power conversion efficiency of ca. 3.7% under 1 sun illumination. Recently, we also fabricated the nanostructured Sb2S3/P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) inorganic/organic heterojunction solar cell.19 The nanostructured Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunction solar cell has a high efficiency of ∼5% owing to its good fill factor; however, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the heterojunction solar cell is slightly diminished at a wavelength of around 650 nm because of the absorption of P3HT.19 This is unlike the mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/Spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobi-fluorene) solar cell18 wherein the Spiro-MeOTAD hole conductor has a relatively wider band gap than P3HT. Therefore, it is challenging to find a way to be able to relieve the EQE loss due to the light absorbed by the P3HT present in the nanostructured Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunction solar cell.
To this end, in this study, we introduced a porously structured P3HT by thermally decomposing 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in a P3HT/AIBN mixed layer; consequently, the EQE loss due to the absorption of P3HT was significantly reduced.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
A 50 nm thick dense TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) was deposited on FTO (Fluorine doped Tin Oxide) glass (TEC15, USA) by the spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) of a 0.02 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in order to prevent direct contact between FTO and P3HT. Then, mp-TiO2 (Degussa P25, primary particle size = 20 nm, anatase:rutile = 3:1) layer was screen printed to a thickness of ca. 1.0 μm on the bl-TiO2 and sintered at 500 °C for 1 h.12 It should be noted that here, we used conventional mp-TiO2 (P25) to check if the proposed concept is working or not even though the device efficiency fabricated from P25 photoanode is lower than the previously reported one (TiO2 size = ∼50 nm, crystalline phase = anatase).19 The junction among the nanocrystalline TiO2 particles was modified by dipping into a 20 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution for 12 h and sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The Sb2S3 inorganic semiconductor sensitizer was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD)21 by dipping a mp-TiO2 film into a mixture of 1.14 M of SbCl3 (Junsei) in 2.5 mL acetone (Aldrich), 25 mL of a 1 M Na2S2O3 (Aldrich) aqueous solution and 72.5 mL deionized water at 7 °C for 2.5 h. The orange-colored amorphous Sb2S3 film was then annealed at 300 °C in Ar atmosphere for 20 min. The porously structured P3HT layer was synthesized as follows. P3HT solutions of different AIBN:P3HT percent weight fractions were spin-coated on a mp-TiO2 film at 2500 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for 40 min. The P3HT concentration was fixed at 15 mg mL−1 and the AIBN weight fractions were 0, 4, and 8. The Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Torr. The active device area was fixed to 16 mm2.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the device were measured under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 global, 100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Newport, Class A, 91195A) using a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter and a calibrated Si reference cell (certified by NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a home-designed system consisting of a light source (300 W Xe lamp, Newport, 66902), a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260), and a multimeter (Keithley 2002). All measurements were performed by masking the cells with a 9.6 mm2 metal mask on the active area. The photoluminescent (PL) spectra were measured by a Perkin Elmer fluorescence spectrometer (Model: LS55). We measured the PL of P3HT coated on mp-TiO2, Sb2S3 deposited on mp-TiO2, and P3HT/Sb2S3/mp-TiO2 film, respectively, in steady state condition by illumination of 530 nm wavelength light as excitation light.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the prepared nanostructured Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunction solar cell. The device structure consists of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au as the transparent conducting oxide/blocking layer/electron conductor/inorganic sensitizer/hole-transporting material/counter electrode. An external source of illumination to Sb2S3 generates electron–hole pairs, the generated electrons are injected to the mp-TiO2 layer, and the holes are independently transported to the P3HT layer. At the same time, the co-absorbed light in the P3HT layer can generate charge carriers as well. The generated electrons in P3HT are transported to either the mp-TiO2 or Sb2S3, and the generated holes are transported to the Au counter electrode as depicted in Fig. 1a. It has been reported that the exciton diffusion length of the TiO2/P3HT (electron acceptor/donor) is optimum at <10 nm and the generated charge carriers in thicker P3HT layers are degraded by the exciton–exciton annihilation.24 Therefore, it is expected that the porously structured P3HT layer will reduce the recombination of the generated charge carriers in P3HT and safely deliver the hole generated from the Sb2S3 to the Au counter electrode through the P3HT intermediate. In addition, the extended interface area between P3HT and Au electrode will reduce the charge transfer series resistance at the interface. Fig. 1b shows that the Sb2S3 inorganic sensitizer deposited onto the mp-TiO2 surface has a polydispersed size of less than 10 nm (see more TEM images in Fig. S1†).

We added AIBN, as a nanopore-generating agent, to the P3HT solution to create a porous morphology in the P3HT layer. The solid AIBN present in the P3HT layer, which was deposited on Sb2S3 by spin coating, acts as a nanopore-generating agent because it generates N2 gas upon thermal decomposition at 100 °C; the liberated N2 gas remains in the nanoholes of the P3HT layer.25 Therefore, the decomposition of AIBN can form the porous morphology in P3HT without deforming the mp-TiO2 layer that has an irregularly structured geometry. The topology of the mp-TiO2/P3HT film is too rough and it cannot be distinguished from the roughness of the original and the porously nanostructured film, which was formed because of the thermal decomposition of AIBN. Therefore, we compared the topologies of the original P3HT film and the porously nanostructured P3HT film by spin-coating AIBN-containing P3HT solution on glass plates as shown in Fig. 2. Three-dimensional topographic images and roughness analysis performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) clearly indicate that the porously nanostructured P3HT film formed by the thermal decomposition of AIBN is considerably rougher than the original P3HT film. In addition, the rms roughness of the porously structured and the original film was 10.716 nm and 4.880 nm, respectively. The roughened morphology of the modified P3HT layer implies that the Au counter electrode will penetrate deeper into the P3HT layer than the original one. As a result, efficient charge collection will occur because the extended interface between the P3HT and the Au counter electrode will extract the charge carriers more effectively by reducing the charge transfer series resistance at the interface and the shortened diffusion pathway to the Au electrode will reduce the recombination of the charge carriers during their intra-P3HT layer transportation.

To further check the effect of the porous nanostructure in the P3HT hole-transporting material, we firstly compared the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the solar cells prepared with two different concentrations of AIBN in the P3HT layer (Fig. 3a). The EQE spectra with the concentration of the added AIBN in P3HT show that the EQE increases up to a certain concentration of added AIBN in P3HT (see AIBN-4 in Fig. 3a) and then decreases as shown in the AIBN-8 sample. These phenomena are attributed to the fact that the generated nanoholes in the P3HT layer may transport the generated charge carriers from either Sb2S3 or P3HT to the Au counter electrode. However, the excessive formation of nanopore in the P3HT layer deteriorates the contact between the Sb2S3 and P3HT or causes direct contact between the Au electrode and Sb2S3 or mp-TiO2. Additionally, an excessive amount of AIBN in the P3HT layer may disturb the crystallinity of P3HT thereby diminishing the carrier mobility. A comparison of the EQE spectra of the AIBN-0 and AIBN-4 samples shows that the EQEs for wavelengths <450 nm, for which there is no absorption by P3HT, are almost the same whereas the EQEs at wavelengths >450 nm improve by the formation of the porously structured P3HT layer. For comparison, we used mp-TiO2/Sb2S3 films with the identical absorbance. Therefore, we believe that almost the same number of charge carriers are generated in each sample; thus, the improved EQE at wavelengths >450 nm is attributed to the improved charge collection resulting from the porously structured morphology of the P3HT layer. In contrast, the EQE of the AIBN-8 sample was slightly degraded in the whole visible region (Fig. 3a). If we assume that the generated charge carriers are almost the same due to the nearly same absorption in each sample, the degradation of EQE may be attributed to the deteriorated charge collection efficiency by either excessively generated nanopores or residues of AIBN. These EQE spectra also imply that the short circuit current density (Jsc) of each sample will be in the order of AIBN-4 > AIBN-8 ≈ AIBN-0.

Fig. 3b displays the J–V curves of each sample, corresponding to Fig. 3a, measured under dark and 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 global, 100 mW cm−2). We can see here that the Jsc correlates well with the EQE values, and the device performance of the porously structured P3HT layer (AIBN-4) improves: Jsc = 11.3–11.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 552–566 mV, fill factor (FF) = 61.6–66.7%. The resulting overall power conversion efficiency (η) was improved by approximately 16% as compared to the reference cell. These characteristics of the J–V curves and EQE spectra suggest that the porously structured P3HT layer may improve the charge collection efficiency due to the extended interface between the P3HT and Au counter electrode, and the shortened transporting pathway. The photoluminescent (PL) spectra in Fig. 3c also confirm that the EQE loss from 450 nm to 650 nm in wavelength is derived from the absorption of the P3HT and, consequently, the incomplete transport of charge carriers generated in P3HT into mp-TiO2. The reduced PL intensity of the mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT sample compared to the mp-TiO2/P3HT sample indicates that the generated charge carriers in P3HT are incompletely transported to either Sb2S3 or mp-TiO2. For further confirmation of the effectiveness of this proposed concept to relieve the EQE loss by introduction of porously structured P3HT in a Sb2S3-sensitized heterojunction solar cell, we fabricated additional model devices of AIBN-0, AIBN-4, and AIBN-8 and summarized their device performances in Table S1†.
Conclusion
We have introduced a porously structured P3HT layer in a mp-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunction solar cell by thermally decomposing AIBN to reduce the EQE loss by absorption of the P3HT hole-transporting material. The transport of the generated charge carriers in the P3HT by the external light to either the Sb2S3 or mp-TiO2 layer is incomplete, and, consequently the absorption of P3HT degrades the EQE in the wavelength range of 450 nm to 650 nm. The porous morphology of the P3HT layer can not only reduce the charge transfer resistance between P3HT and Au electrode by the extended interface area but also shorten the transport pathway of the generated charge carriers in either P3HT or Sb2S3. As a result, the device efficiency was improved by approximately 16% as compared to the reference cell, which is mainly ascribed to the improvement of the charge collection efficiency that results from the porously structured P3HT layer. We believe that this design concept of porously structured P3HT can be applied to any kind of hole transporting materials, which absorbs light in the visible range, to further improve the efficiency of sensitized heterojunction solar cells.
