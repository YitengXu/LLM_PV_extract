    , Accepted 29th March 2019First published on 29th March 2019AbstractBis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole-capped indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) have been constructed as hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Two IDT-based HTMs, one with 3,6-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK1) and another with 2,7-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK2), show different performances in PSCs. The PSC device based on YK1 displays a very impressive PCE of 20.13% under AM1.5G solar illumination, which is much higher than those of the devices based on YK2 (17.35%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (19.01%) under the same working conditions. This is mainly because YK1 has more effective intermolecular π–π stacking, a lower-lying HOMO level and higher hole-mobility than YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, the YK1-based PSC exhibits excellent long-term stability retaining 94% of the initial PCE value after a 600 h lifetime without encapsulation owing to its better film morphology and hydrophobicity. These findings would shed light on the crucial importance of molecular engineering and allow its extension into general principles for the design of new HTMs for highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells (PSCs) have been recognized as promising alternatives for next-generation solar cells due to their cost-efficient solution-based fabrication and remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–9 The reported PCEs of PSCs have exhibited a dramatic improvement from the initial 3.8% to a certified record value of 23.7% under AM1.5G solar illumination in just a few years.10,11 During this unexpected progress in PSC technology, the hole-transport material (HTM) has always been one of the most significant components in high-performance PSC devices, since it can not only efficiently extract and transport photo-generated holes from the perovskite material toward the back contact electrode for effectively reducing the undesired charge-recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface, but can also act as a potential moisture and oxygen-blocking layer to prevent the decomposition of the perovskite light absorber, leading to the enhancement of the performance and long-term stability of PSC devices.12–16 To date, a broad variety of organic small-molecule HTMs including carbazole, triphenylamine, fluorene, phthalocyanine, porphyrin, phenothiazine and spirobifluorene cores have also been developed for the fabrication of PSCs that have shown outstanding photovoltaic performances,17–23 among which Spiro-OMeTAD has been demonstrated to be the most commonly used HTM for highly efficient PSC devices since its first introduction in 1998.24 However, the synthesis of twisted spiro-bifluorene cores involves tedious synthetic procedures with a low total yield of lower than 40% and time-consuming purification,19 which makes Spiro-OMeTAD cost ineffective with a price ten times more than that of gold. Thus, the high-cost Spiro-OMeTAD is not beneficial for realistic large-scale industrial applications. Additionally, Spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low intrinsic hole-mobility and conductivity, which results in high interfacial charge-recombination losses.25–27 To address the aforementioned shortcomings, extensive research efforts have been focused on the development of new high hole-mobility and conductivity HTMs through more facile synthetic procedures to replace Spiro-OMeTAD for PSC applications, but only a few hole-transporting alternatives have been reported which have achieved comparable photovoltaic performance to that of Spiro-OMeTAD with PCEs exceeding 20% (Table S1†). From a structural viewpoint, the effects of molecular planarity,28 alkyl chain length,29 three dimensional molecular structure,30 different central scaffolds,31–34 and electron donor groups35 on the HTM properties have been systematically investigated; however, the positioning effect of a donor group in HTMs on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of HTMs has not been well understood yet.
The methoxytriphenylamine-substituted indacenodithiophene (IDT) group has been widely utilized as a promising building block to construct non-fullerene electron-transport materials for highly efficient organic photovoltaics.36–38 The extended fused ring coplanar aromatic π-conjugation of IDT and the easy polarization of sulfur atoms in the IDT unit are beneficial for the formation of intermolecular π–π stacking for the enhancement of the conductivity and efficient charge transportation in the solid thin-film.39,40 Furthermore, the bulky hexylphenyl substituents introduced into the π-conjugated backbone can effectively enhance solubility and hydrophobicity, which could be expected to achieve high uniformity HTM films and enhance the ambient stability of the PSC devices. Recently, Xu and co-workers reported a HTM based on IDT as the central core bearing two methoxytriphenylamine donors (IDTC6-TPA); MAPbI3-based PSCs employing undoped IDTC6-TPA exhibited a 15.43% efficiency under AM 1.5G irradiation.41 At this stage, further development of highly efficient IDT-based HTMs for PSCs achieving over 20% efficiency is promising for realizing the future application of PSC devices.
Considering all the above points, in this work, two new IDT-based HTMs capped with 3,6-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK1) or 2,7-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]carbazole (YK2) were synthesized, as shown in Fig. 1. The positioning effect of the di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino at the carbazole on their optical and electronic properties and PSC performances was systematically studied. It was found that YK1 could enable more effective intermolecular π–π stacking, a lower-lying HOMO level, higher hole-mobility, better film morphology and hydrophobicity, better performance and higher stability of solar cells than the analogous YK2. The PSC device based on YK1 exhibited a promising PCE of 20.13% with excellent long-term stability, in comparison with those based on YK2 (17.35%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (19.01%) under the same working conditions. More importantly, this work on the relationship between the structure and hole-transporting properties could provide clear insights for the design of new HTMs for efficient PSC application.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to the IDT-based HTMs YK1 and YK2 are outlined in Scheme S1,† and the detailed synthetic protocols towards the two HTMs are depicted in the ESI.† The two HTMs were synthesized in good yields through a straightforward condensation reaction. The two new target HTMs were fully characterized using NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S4†). Both YK1 and YK2 exhibit high solubility in common organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc., at room temperature.
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of YK1 and YK2 in CH2Cl2 solution and in the thin-film are shown in Fig. 2a and their spectroscopic data are displayed in Table 1. It can be noted that both the HTMs display two major absorption bands ranging from 300 nm to 500 nm. The maximum absorption peaks for YK1 and YK2 are located at 410 nm and 390 nm, respectively, and can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the whole molecule. In comparison with those of their absorption spectra in solution, the respective ICT peaks of YK1 and YK2 in the thin-films were red-shifted to 444 nm and 412 nm, respectively. This could be explained by the fact that the π-conjugated IDT backbone induced strong intermolecular π–π stacking in the thin-film,42–44 which would undoubtedly enhance the charge-carrier transport between neighboring molecules in PSCs. Compared with YK2, YK1 displays a more remarkable red shift, which indicates that 3,6-bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino] substitutions at carbazole lead to less steric hindrance and a more planar molecular structure.

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) (Fig. 2b) was performed to estimate the relative energy levels of YK1 and YK2, and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3b, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of YK1 and YK2 are found to be −5.19 and −5.11 eV, respectively, and are sufficiently positive with respect to that of the mixed-ion perovskite light-harvester material used in this work (−5.65 eV), which can provide sufficient driving force for the efficient extraction and transfer of photogenerated holes at the perovskite/HTM interfaces.45 Notably, YK1 has a slightly lower HOMO level than YK2, which is potentially helpful to achieve higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the PSC device (vide infra).46 In addition, the values of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of YK1 (−2.44 eV) and YK2 (−2.23 eV) are much higher than that of the perovskite material (−4.05 eV), which could effectively block the undesired electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM layer, thus suppressing charge-carrier recombination.47,48 Based on the obtained HOMO and LUMO energy levels, both YK1 and YK2 should be potential candidates for efficient HTMs in PSCs.

The hole-mobility of the two HTMs in PSCs was estimated by space-charge-limited-currents (SCLCs) according to previous reports.49,50 The obtained I–V curves are displayed in Fig. 4a and the evaluated hole-mobilities of YK1 and YK2 are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the hole-mobility of YK1 is 6.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about eight times higher than that of YK2 (8.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is related to the stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction in YK1. Moreover, the hole-mobility of YK1 is also much higher than that of the standard HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).51 Thus, our results clearly indicate that IDT structured molecules could be effective HTM candidates for highly efficient PSC application. Furthermore, the hole-extraction ability of YK1 and YK2 was demonstrated by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite/HTM films.52,53 As shown in Fig. 4b, the perovskite layer without the HTM layer exhibits a very strong PL peak between 700 and 850 nm. In contrast, the PL was significantly quenched after the deposition of the HTMs onto the perovskite film, which clearly confirms the efficient extraction of holes at the perovskite/HTM interface. In particular, the PL quenching efficiency of YK1 (ca. 96%) is higher than that of YK2 (ca. 87%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 90%). This result indicates that YK1 shows more efficient hole extraction in PSCs than YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, which should be highly beneficial to its photovoltaic performance in PSCs.

The photovoltaic performance of these two new HTMs (YK1 and YK2) in PSC devices was evaluated with the common mesoporous device configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2//(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTMs/Au (Fig. 3a). Fig. 5a displays the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based champion PSC devices under simulated AM1.5G irradiation, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best PSC based on YK1 produces an impressive PCE of 20.13% with a JSC of 23.55 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.11 V, and a FF of 0.77. And the YK2-based PSC device exhibits an inferior PCE of 17.35% owing to a lower JSC (22.52 mA cm−2), VOC (1.07 V) and FF (0.72). Impressively, the champion PSC based on YK1 shows a much better performance than that based on the standard HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (JSC = 23.34 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.10 V, FF = 0.74, and PCE = 19.01%) under the same fabrication and working conditions. Obviously, the JSC, VOC and FF values of the YK1-based device are much higher than those of the YK2-based device. The higher VOC value of the YK1-based device can be ascribed to its relatively lower-lying HOMO level. The higher hole-mobility, more efficient hole extraction and smoother HTM morphology (vide infra) of YK1 should be responsible for the higher JSC and FF. The integrated JSC values were calculated to be 22.14, 22.05 and 21.12 mA cm−2 for YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, from the incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5b), which match well with the experimental J–V measurements. To determine the reliability of the three HTM-based PSC devices, the stabilized PCEs were measured within a time period of 2000 s under the maximum power point working conditions. As shown in Fig. 5c, both PSC devices exhibited reliable high photovoltaic performances with steady PCEs of 19.68%, 16.91% and 18.33% for YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. In addition, statistical efficiency analysis of PSC devices based on these three HTMs was carried out for around 36 individual devices (Fig. 5d); PSCs based on YK1 and YK2 as HTMs show good reproducibility with narrow PCE distributions.

The stability tests of devices based on YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD were studied without encapsulation at room temperature. Fig. 6a shows the stability tests of corresponding PSCs without encapsulation in a N2 environment. After 600 hours of storage, the PCEs of YK1 and YK2-based solar cells retain 94% and 92% of the original values, respectively, while the PCE of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device dropped by nearly 80%. We also carried out stability tests of PSCs with these three HTMs without encapsulation in an ambient environment of 40% relative humidity at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 6b, the PSC devices based on YK1 and YK2 retain 79% and 74% of their initial PCE after 300 h storage, respectively. In contrast, the PCE of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device decreased to 51% of its original value under the same working conditions. Obviously, the PSCs based on YK1 and YK2 as HTMs exhibited much more resilience to moisture and higher long-term stability than the Spiro-OMeTAD counterpart, which could be mainly attributed to the larger water contact angles and better HTM thin-film morphology, as discussed later.

In order to get more insights into the reasons for the different photovoltaic performances and stabilities exhibited by the PSC devices based on YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, the HTM thin-film morphology and the water contact angles on the HTM surfaces were investigated. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to study the thin-film morphology of HTMs on top of the perovskite layer under the same working conditions, as shown in Fig. 7a. In our results, the YK1- and YK2-based films have extraordinarily homogeneous HTM surfaces with small RMS roughness of 1.45 nm and 2.17 nm, respectively; the very smooth HTM surface should be beneficial for efficient charge extraction and transport in the film,54,55 resulting in excellent photovoltaic performance. Moreover, the good uniformity of the HTM layer is expected to prevent the penetration of moisture into the perovskite film, thus enhancing the long-term stability in the resulting PSCs. When Spiro-OMeTAD was coated onto the perovskite surface, some observable large particles formed on the film, which can significantly decrease the device performance and stability of Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC devices.56–58 We further examined the hydrophobic properties of YK1, YK2 and Spiro-OMeTAD-coated thin films. As shown in Fig. 7b, the contact angles of water on YK1 and YK2 films are 102° and 95°, respectively, and thus the hydrophobic nature of YK1 and YK2-based HTMs can efficiently prevent moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. In comparison, the contact angle of water on the Spiro-OMeTAD-based HTM film is measured to be 75°, revealing an increased affinity to environmental moisture. These results clearly show that the hydrophobic properties of YK1 and YK2 lead to the formation of a more effective moisture barrier than those of Spiro-OMeTAD which could improve the long-term stability of PSCs. In addition, YK1 exhibits a much better thin-film morphology and relatively higher water contact angle as compared to YK2.

To further understand the interfacial charge transport process in perovskite solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been performed in the dark (Fig. 8). The Nyquist plot of EIS displays a primary semicircle in the middle frequency region, which represents the charge transport resistance (Rct) at the perovskite/ETL and HTL/perovskite interfaces. Considering the fact that all PSC devices contain the same TiO2/perovskite interface, the Rct is mainly dominated by the HTL/perovskite interface.56,59 Generally, a lower Rct indicates much more efficient charge transfer at the interface in the device. The Rct value, which was obtained by fitting the EIS spectra using the equivalent circuit model, follows the order YK2 (62.5 Ω) > Spiro-OMeTAD (46.4 Ω) > YK1 (38.2 Ω). The Rct value for the YK1-based PSC is lower than that for the YK2-based PSC, indicating that more efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/YK1 interface leads to better performance in the resulting PSC.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two novel HTMs (YK1 and YK2) comprising methoxytriphenylamine-substituted indacenodithiophenes as the π-linker in order to systematically investigate the influence of the different positioning of a bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine donor group at the 3,6-positions (YK1) or 2,7-positions (YK2) of the molecular framework on the optical and electronic properties and their solar cell performance. It has been found that introducing the donor group at the 3,6-positions of the molecular framework can contribute to the lower HOMO energy level, faster charge extraction and transport ability, excellent thin-film morphology and superior hydrophobicity. The YK1-based PSC exhibited an impressive PCE value of 20.13% in air, superior to that of the device fabricated with YK2 as the HTM (17.35%). The PSC device based on YK1 shows high long-term storage stability by retaining >90% of its initial PCE. Therefore, this work will provide important and helpful information for the design of new highly performing HTMs for photovoltaic applications in the future.
