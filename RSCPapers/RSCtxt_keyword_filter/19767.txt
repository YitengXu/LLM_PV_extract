    , Accepted 18th February 2013First published on 25th February 2013AbstractControl over the structure of donor/acceptor blends is essential for the development of solution processable organic solar cells (OSCs). We have used time-resolved neutron reflectometry (NR) and in situ annealing to investigate the nanoscale structure and interdiffusion of sequentially spin-coated thin films of poly(3-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and correlated the evolving structure with the device performance. While the as-prepared film shows a clear two-layer structure it is evident that (19 wt%) PCBM has percolated throughout the lower P3HT layer. Upon heating, analysis of time-resolved NR data shows that the diffusion process is dependent on the annealing temperature. At temperatures up to 110 °C, the two-layer structure is retained and only a small amount of PCBM diffuses from the interface into the lower layer, increasing the total PCBM content throughout the P3HT layer to 26 wt%. Significantly, this small change in acceptor content leads to a profound increase in device performance; with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs increasing from 0.47% (unannealed, 19 wt% PCBM) to 3.23% (annealed, 26 wt% PCBM) with the latter showing a similar efficiency to devices prepared from a blend containing 50 wt% PCBM. Further annealing at 120 and 130 °C sees rapid interdiffusion between the two layers, along with an overall expansion in the thickness of the bilayer film. Despite the complete intermixing of the PCBM and P3HT to form a structure resembling a bulk heterojunction, essentially no improvement in device performance was observed for annealing at temperatures above 110 °C.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are making important strides towards being a renewable energy source that is portable (mechanically flexible, lightweight) and potentially inexpensive.1,2 We have witnessed impressive progress in recent times with state-of-the-art single bulk heterojunction (BHJ)3,4 solution-processed OSCs already demonstrating 9.2% efficiency.5 Such progress has been achieved via the implementation of several approaches including materials innovation, such as the development of narrow optical gap (“low bandgap”) polymers, and understanding the correlation between film structure (morphology) and device performance. The last point is particularly important given that the interpenetrating network structure in a BHJ arising from the phase separation of the donor and the acceptor materials under favorable processing conditions plays a key role in device operation.6 In the BHJ architecture photogenerated excitons need to diffuse to a donor–acceptor molecular interface in order to dissociate, with the respective charges then extracted through the percolation pathway formed by the interpenetrating network structure to the respective electrodes. However, the short exciton diffusion length in most organic semiconductors (of order 10 nm) dictates that the phase structure needs to be on the nanoscale, which presents a challenge in terms of characterization and processing.7–9 The optimal film structure is widely acknowledged as being defined by a delicate balancing act between forming the percolated interpenetrating network and excessive phase segregation causing carrier traps and reducing the available interfacial area for exciton dissociation.10
Given that the BHJ geometry is the architecture of choice for solid-state OSCs, it comes as no surprise that significant effort has been expended on studying this acceptor–donor phase separation and seeking the optimum processing conditions that leads to a structure that permits efficient splitting of excitons into charge carriers and charge collection.11–14 However, our understanding of the genesis of the BHJ film structure for each materials combination is still incomplete,15 and only in recent times have the formation and structure of the BHJ film been directly observed. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) has been used to gain insight into nanoscale phase separation;16 while neutron reflectometry (NR) has revealed the distribution of components within the BHJ film normal to the substrate.17–21 In addition, in situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) has been used to follow the solvent drying process that leads to the formation of a blended film,22 and electron tomography has been used to identify the network structure in BHJ films.9 It is agreed that the miscibility and diffusivity of the donor and acceptor components in the heterojunction are of immense importance, as they drive molecular ordering and phase separation processes.15,23,24 Many of the studies on structure have been carried out on the as-formed film or the final (blended) heterojunction film so while the final “structural outcome” has been elucidated the process by which it has formed is still somewhat of a mystery.25–27
It is now well established that heterojunctions comprised of poly(3-n-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-penyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PCBM) [the classic polymer-fullerene model] for efficient OSCs can be formed by either depositing a solution containing the two components followed by a thermal anneal, or by forming a P3HT film first with subsequent deposition of the PCBM and thermal annealing (the sequential approach). While the properties of the BHJ films formed by the two methods, and indeed the final film structure, are essentially the same17 the process by which the heterojunction is formed by the sequential deposition technique is not well understood. It is known that after deposition of the fullerene onto the P3HT from an orthogonal solvent, some PCBM does immediately diffuse into the P3HT layer17 but thereafter, it is not clear how the fully blended heterojunction evolves. In an effort to gain further insight into the diffusion of PCBM into P3HT two separate studies have formed true bilayer structures by laminating ‘floated’ regioregular P3HT films onto films of PCBM and then studying the film structure during thermal annealing.28,29 These studies have however proved contradictory – in one case complete and rapid diffusion of the PCBM into the P3HT was reported,28 with the other stating that only a relative low volume percentage of PCBM enters the P3HT layer.29 Therefore, a clear understanding of the diffusion process is still required if sequential deposition of donor–acceptor blends is going to be a useful method for forming BHJ devices.17 Indeed, more generally, new high efficiency small molecule bilayer (or linear heterojunction) OSCs are emerging,30 and such questions of interdiffusion are as yet even to be posed let alone addressed. Based upon such motivations, in this work we investigate the diffusion process of PCBM into a pre-cast P3HT layer by time-resolved neutron reflectometry (NR) under changing annealing temperatures. We17,21,31–38 and more recently others18–20,29 have established NR as a powerful tool for investigating organic semiconductor films. NR is a non-destructive technique that is able to reveal the precise structure normal to the film surface with essentially atomic-scale resolution.39 In this paper we show that the ability to make multiple measurements on the same sample with good temporal resolution delivers a detailed understanding of changes in film structure during annealing. NR makes this possible as it is a non-destructive method, in contrast to secondary ion mass spectrometry,28 which relies on the destructive sputtering of material from the film surface and therefore requires multiple samples that have different histories.15
Results and discussion
The sequentially deposited P3HT/PCBM films were prepared on Si wafers by solution processing following a reported method.17 It is important to note that the method gives rise to films before and after annealing with similar absorption spectra to neat ordered P3HT films (e.g., showing the shoulder at 600 nm, which is normally attributed to intermolecular ordering in the polymer) indicating that the PCBM deposition and subsequent thermal annealing has minimal effect on the highly organized P3HT regions. That is, the PCBM essentially diffuses into the amorphous regions of the film. This means the changes observed in the structure of the films during the neutron reflectometry study can be directly related to the diffusion process without complications caused by significant further changes to the organized P3HT regions. Selective deuteration was not required to give the necessary NR contrast given the significant neutron scattering length density (SLD) difference between P3HT (0.80 ± 0.01 × 10−6 Å−2) and PCBM (4.34 × 10−6 Å−2).17,40 As reported in our earlier work,17 the as-cast films can be modeled using a two-layer system representation with a top (PCBM rich) layer and a bottom layer that is P3HT rich. That is, the upper (near the air interface) and lower (near the silicon substrate) layers contain some P3HT and PCBM, respectively, prior to annealing. Analysis of the refined SLD profile indicates that the lower layer is composed of 83% P3HT and 17% PCBM by volume. These proportions correspond to 81% and 19% by weight for P3HT and PCBM based on the densities of 1.3 g cm−3 and 1.5 g cm−3, respectively. The densities of the two materials were extracted from NR data and are consistent with previously reported results.29,41 For the time-resolved NR measurements the sample stage was held at a fixed angle (1.1°) and the data collected in event mode while the film was annealed in situ, at temperatures between 70 °C and 130 °C (the typical annealing range for optimum P3HT:PCBM devices). For analysis, the data was re-binned to 5 min intervals. For clarity, we present only a selection of the measured NR profiles in Fig. 1, with the corresponding calculated SLD profiles shown in Fig. 2. Apart from the very highest temperatures, the data sets could be fitted well with a two-layer model. From the complete data set, we extracted detailed structural parameters from the SLD profiles. Fig. 3 plots the change in SLD values for the upper and lower layers. The results show that PCBM diffusion into the P3HT is a multi-step process. The first diffusion process begins at low temperatures, possibly below 70 °C, and continues up to 110 °C. The key feature of the diffusion in this temperature range is the reduction in the thickness of the upper layer from 190 Å to 140 Å (Fig. 2) without there being a substantial decrease in SLD, which only reduces from 4.34 × 10−6 Å−2 to 4.00 × 10−6 Å−2. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 that within this temperature range the PCBM in the upper layer is essentially removed from the P3HT:PCBM interface. Fig. 3 shows that the SLD of the lower layer increases steadily, which is consistent with an increasing content of evenly distributed PCBM, and there is little if any diffusion of P3HT into the upper layer. Interestingly, after 40 min at 90 °C the amount of PCBM in the lower layer increased only slightly to 22 wt% from the starting 19 wt%, and even after a further 15 min at 110 °C there is only 26 wt% of the PCBM in the lower layer. At 120 °C there is a clear change in the diffusion process. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that while the position of the interface between the layers only changes a little, there is a significant decrease in the SLD of the upper layer. The decrease in SLD in the upper layer is mirrored by an increase in the PCBM content in the lower layer (Fig. 3). This behavior indicates that P3HT can now diffuse into the PCBM-rich upper layer in significant quantities and vice versa. At the end of the 120 °C heating cycle the film was found to suddenly expand and high-SLD material (presumably PCBM) was found to begin to accumulate at the silicon dioxide interface. This process suggests that there is a critical concentration of PCBM in the P3HT at which a significant change in structure occurs. The amount of PCBM in the P3HT-rich lower layer at which this occurred was 26 wt%. These results provide a physical explanation of capacitance measurements on P3HT:PCBM BHJ films in which it has been reported that there was a change in capacitance at 80–100 °C and another at 120 °C.42 The lower temperature transition was reported to correspond to a glass transition temperature, while the change at 120 °C was attributed to a major change in the film “morphology”, with the softening of the P3HT allowing the PCBM to diffuse and cluster (generating an optimal blend “morphology”). In addition, more interestingly the weight percent of P3HT (74 wt%) is close to that reported (65 wt%) for the formation of a eutectic composition of P3HT and PCBM suggesting that such a composition provides a trigger point for rapid interdiffusion.23 Heating the film at 130 °C further drove its expansion, increased interdiffusion of the PCBM in the P3HT rich layer, and increased the thickness of the PCBM rich layer at the silicon dioxide interface. Accumulation of the PCBM at the silicon dioxide interface has also been previously observed by NR following ex situ annealing at 150 °C (ref. 17) and is consistent with electrical measurements by Labram et al.43 In Labram et al.'s study it was found that when using a bottom-gate, bottom-contact field effect transistor with a P3HT:PCBM semiconducting channel, electron mobility in the device could only be measured when it was annealed at 130 °C. The NR studies clearly show that this is due to the PCBM diffusing down into the conducting channel region at the interface with the SiO2.
 Fig. 1  Selection of measured NR profiles (data points) taken at the beginning of each annealing temperature. Solid lines are calculated NR profiles, determined using the structural models shown in Fig. 2. The ‘doublet’ peak feature between Q of 0.04–0.05 Å−1 is characteristic of a two layer system and can be seen clearly in the measurement at RT and 90 °C. With further annealing this feature begins to disappear, indicating a change in the film structure. 
 Fig. 2  Neutron SLD profiles obtained by fitting the measured NR data shown in Fig. 1. For annealing at 120–130 °C, SLD profiles taken at 5 minute intervals are shown to indicate the rapid change in the film structure caused by the annealing at these temperatures. 
 Fig. 3  Change in the SLD for the PCBM layer (circles) and P3HT layer (triangles) as a function of annealing temperature and time. The PCBM diffusion shows two very distinct regimes of mixing. The hollow triangles represent the SLD of the lower layer adjacent to the Si at higher temperatures, while the solid triangles are measured at 400 Å from the Si. 
Returning to our NR study, after this in situ heating cycle up to 130 °C, the film was allowed to cool to room temperature. Although the room temperature profile after the heating cycle was a little difficult to fit due to interfacial roughness, the interdiffusion of the two materials appears to have continued during the cooling to the extent that there is near complete mixing of PCBM and P3HT although the PCBM rich layer remains at the silicon dioxide interface. In addition, the film did not decrease in thickness upon cooling to room temperature relative to that observed at 120 °C and 130 °C.
The final step in our analysis was to relate the structural changes observed in the film by the time-resolved NR measurements to device performance. The OSCs were fabricated by the same method as that used for the NR film except that the layers were deposited onto the standard anode-hole transport layer combination of indium tin oxide [ITO and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)], and each device was held at a specific annealing temperature for 20 minutes before being removed from the hot plate (see Experimental for full details). Removal of the device from the hot plate allowed the structure to rapidly cool thus freezing in the structure. The device performance statistics are summarized in Table 1, with the efficiency trend shown in Fig. 4(a) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best device for the selected annealing temperatures shown in Fig. 4(b). It is important to note that Table 1 represents results from at least 6 devices per temperature and as described in the Experimental section, significant care was taken to ensure accurate performance parameters were obtained. As Fig. 4(a) illustrates, the general trend for the device performance is an improvement with the annealing temperature. The as-prepared two-layer OSCs have a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 0.47%, even though some PCBM (19 wt%) has diffused into the lower layer as a result of the fabrication process. Significant improvement in device performance was observed even when the devices were annealed at only 90 °C. The average PCE increases from 0.78% (following annealing at 60 °C for 20 minutes) to 2.77% after annealing at 90 °C for 20 minutes. A similar change can be observed in the typical EQE spectra [Fig. 4(b)] – with the spectrum for the device annealed at 90 °C approaching that of devices annealed at higher temperatures. The improvement in performance is a little surprising given that there is only a small increase (to 22 wt%) in the PCBM concentration in the bottom P3HT rich layer and apparent retention of the overall two-layer structure. The NR data shows that the film annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes still remains as a two-layer structure (i.e., the P3HT and PCBM rich layers) with the P3HT rich layer containing 26 wt% of PCBM. The devices prepared under these conditions had an efficiency of 3.23%, which is close to that of the devices produced by fully annealing the film at 150 °C for 20 minutes, and standard optimised BHJ devices reported in the literature prepared from a 1:1 by weight ratio of PCBM and P3HT.17 These results show that with this film structure the minimum amount of PCBM required in the P3HT rich layer to achieve percolation of electrons is around 26 wt%.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have investigated the diffusion of PCBM into P3HT using time-resolved neutron reflectometry. The NR data shows that the diffusion process is annealing temperature dependent. In the low temperature regime the PCBM diffuses from close to the interface with the P3HT making the PCBM-rich layer thinner. At higher annealing temperatures the intermixing continues with the PCBM diffusing throughout the P3HT-rich layer. Interestingly at a concentration of PCBM in the P3HT-rich layer close to the eutectic composition and a temperature of 120 °C the film expands, and rapid and complete mixing of the P3HT and PCBM occurs. Finally, we have shown that efficient two layer solar cells can be prepared with the P3HT rich layer containing only 26 wt% of PCBM and correlated our temporal structural observations with macroscopic device outcomes to gain a more complete understanding of the implications of structural evolution of films in organic solar cells.
Experimental
Device fabrication
OSC cells were fabricated on pre-patterned indium-doped tin oxide (Kintec) substrates. The substrates were first cleaned in a warm detergent (Alconox), followed by successive sonications in a detergent solution, deionized water, acetone, and finally 2-propanol for approximately 6 min each. The substrates were then blown dry with nitrogen. A thin (∼45 nm) layer of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonicacid) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP Al 4083) was deposited by spin-coating at 5000 RPM for 120 s. The PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were then baked on a hot plate for 20 min at 180 °C.
A 15 mg mL−1 P3HT (Merck, RR 95.6%, w = 72200, polydispersity 1.93) solution in o-dichlorobenzene, and a 5 mg mL−1 PCBM (Nano-C) solution in dichloromethane (DCM) were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere. For continuity, the same batch of P3HT was used as described in ref. 17, and the PCBM was purchased from Nano-C and used as received. Both solutions were filtered (0.25 μm) prior to spin-coating. The P3HT powder was not prewashed in DCM.17 The P3HT solution was then heated to 60 °C for ∼1 hour under nitrogen before being cooled to room temperature for spin-casting. P3HT was deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate by spin-coating at 1000 RPM for 25 s, followed by 2000 RPM for 35 s to help dry the P3HT film. Additional drying was achieved by placing the substrate onto a hot plate at 60 °C for 20 min. This produced a 60 nm thick P3HT film, as measured by a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150). The PCBM solution was deposited onto the P3HT-coated substrate by spin-coating at 4000 RPM for 10 s. The structure was then annealed by placing the substrate onto a hot plate for 20 min at varying temperatures ranging from 60–150 °C. The OSC cells were completed by depositing the top electrode by thermal evaporation. Under vacuum (1 × 10−6 mbar), 20 nm of Ca was deposited (at a rate of 0.4 Å s−1), followed by a 50 nm of Al (initially at a rate of 0.4 Å s−1, which was then increased to 2.5 Å s−1). The electrode was defined by a shadow mask, resulting in an active device area of 0.2 cm2, and each substrate contained 6 devices.
Characterization
Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit in a 4-point source-sense configuration under nitrogen (<1 ppm oxygen and water). An AM 1.5 solar simulator (ABET Technologies) at ∼100 mW cm−2 intensity (the exact illumination being used for efficiency calculations) was used for illuminated measurements, and calibrated with a NREL certified standard photodiode. The EQE was measured using a PV Measurement QEX7 setup. Integrating the area underneath the EQE curve yields the short circuit current density JSC, which provides an independent way to cross-check the accuracy of our electrical characterization. We note that the JSC measurements using the current–voltage sweep and the EQE were in agreement within 5%.
Time-resolved neutron reflectometry
Films for NR were spin-coated onto polished 2′′ Si wafers using the same method as described above. NR measurements were recorded using the Platypus time-of-flight neutron reflectometer and a cold neutron spectrum (2.8 Å < λ < 18.0 Å).44,45 20 Hz neutron pulses were generated using a disk chopper system (EADS Astrium GmbH) in the medium resolution mode (Δλ/λ = 4%) and recorded on a 2-dimensional helium-3 neutron detector (Denex GmbH). Static measurements were acquired at incident angles of 0.5° (0.19 mm slits) and 2.0° (0.64 mm slits), for 30 min. and 90 min. respectively. For the time-dependent measurements, the reflected beam spectra were collected at 1.1° (0.85 mm slits). This angle enabled the ‘doublet’ peak feature between Q of 0.04–0.05, which is characteristic of a bilayer film system, to be continually monitored. The data were acquired in event mode (time of flight, x and y detector pixel position, and the time of each frame being recorded for every reflected neutron). These data were then re-binned to 5 minute time windows for analysis. Direct beam spectra were collected under identical collimation conditions for 1 hour each.
A custom built experimental cell with in situ annealing capabilities was used for the experiment. An aluminum block heating stage, isolated from the neutron cell by a ceramic stand, was heated (10 °C min−1 during ramp) with two cartridge heaters and the temperature controlled by a Watlow series 988 temperature controller. The cell was kept under vacuum (≈1 mbar) during all experiments. Least squares analysis of the reflectivity profiles were performed using the Motofit reflectometry analysis program,46 with all the models including a 12 Å oxide layer on the surface of the substrate and error estimates on fitted parameters reported as ±1 standard deviation.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Selection of measured NR profiles (data points) taken at the beginning of each annealing temperature. Solid lines are calculated NR profiles, determined using the structural models shown in Fig. 2. The ‘doublet’ peak feature between Q of 0.04–0.05 Å−1 is characteristic of a two layer system and can be seen clearly in the measurement at RT and 90 °C. With further annealing this feature begins to disappear, indicating a change in the film structure.	 

 	Fig. 2  Neutron SLD profiles obtained by fitting the measured NR data shown in Fig. 1. For annealing at 120–130 °C, SLD profiles taken at 5 minute intervals are shown to indicate the rapid change in the film structure caused by the annealing at these temperatures.	 

 	Fig. 3  Change in the SLD for the PCBM layer (circles) and P3HT layer (triangles) as a function of annealing temperature and time. The PCBM diffusion shows two very distinct regimes of mixing. The hollow triangles represent the SLD of the lower layer adjacent to the Si at higher temperatures, while the solid triangles are measured at 400 Å from the Si.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Average efficiency in the bilayer OSCs fabricated under varying annealing temperatures for 20 min (from Table 1). The general trend is for the device performance to improve with the annealing temperature, with a sharp increase at 90 °C. (b) External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best device fabricated as-cast, and annealed at 90, 110 and 150 °C.
