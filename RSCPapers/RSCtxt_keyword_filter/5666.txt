    , Accepted 14th June 2022First published on 14th June 2022AbstractThermal vacuum deposition is a stimulating technique for upscaling perovskite solar cells. However, the operational complexity of multisource vapor deposition (MSVD) and achieving stoichiometric perovskite layers may impede its implementation. The single-source vapor deposition (SSVD) method has recently emerged as an alternative for MSVD due to its inherent functionality and ease of operation. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a successful SSVD approach for fabricating pure CsFAPbI3 and FAPbI3 thin films from pre-synthesized perovskite powders. We carried out structural and photophysical investigations to optimize the phase purity and shelf-life of the deposited thin films. Furthermore, we probed the perovskite layer compatibility with various underlayers; we noted that MeO–2PACz, an organic underlayer, displayed superiority over other organic underlayers such as Spiro-OMeTAD and TaTm, and the SnO2 metal oxide layer, which might indicate that this method is more suitable for p–i–n solar cell fabrication. Our approach presents a straightforward methodology and avoids the use of multiple thermal sources to deposit CsFAPbI3 and can further ease the vacuum deposition methodology.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has improved over the last decade, from 3.8% in 2009 to over 25% today.1,2 This increase in PCE is remarkable and makes perovskite solar cells a promising technology for reducing carbon emissions.33 Perovskites are considered inexpensive,4 easy to process, and recyclable,5 factors contributing to achieving UN sustainability goals.3 Nevertheless, commercialization is still challenging due to the instability of the overall device and the perovskite material's intolerance to environmental stresses,6–9 complicating large-scale production. Various strategies such as compositional and process engineering have been adopted to overcome these difficulties. The degradation-prone methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) was replaced by formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) due to its reduced optical bandgap and higher thermal stability.10 However, the critical phase transition (α- to δ-phase) of FAPbI3 at room temperature hindered its application. Further extension of compositional engineering using FA-site doping with smaller cations and anions such as methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), bromide (Br−), and chloride (Cl−) helped to stabilize the perovskite phase.11,12 Through process engineering, various thin film fabrication methods such as the two-step sequential spin-coating method, a one-step spin-coating method, a vapor-assisted solution process, and the vacuum deposition method emerged. While solution-processed PSCs possess low-cost and higher efficiencies at the lab scale, the technique is not yet fully optimized for large-scale PSC fabrication.13–15 Moreover, toxic organic solvents are used in perovskite precursor solutions. Employing these at an industrial scale could severely impact human health and the environment.16,17 In this context, vacuum deposition techniques provide a solvent-free alternative to solution processing. Advantages include large-scale compatibility, nanometer-scale precision, and prevention of intermixing of different layers.18,19
In conventional vacuum deposition methods (also known as multisource vacuum deposition (MSVD)), precursor powders are sublimed simultaneously from different crucibles.13 In the literature, MSVD was first reported by Borchert et al. in 2017, describing the large-area (16 cm2) fabrication of FAPbI3 films with a stabilized efficiency of 14.2%.19 Inspired by solution-process techniques, MAI,20 Cs+,21 PbBr2,22 guanidinium iodide,23 and excess FAI were co-sublimed to stabilize the α-FAPbI3 layer, leading to two-, three- or four-source vacuum deposition processes.23,24 Controlling the stoichiometric ratio in MSVD-fabricated thin films is difficult for mixed anion or mixed cation perovskites. Each material must be calibrated first and later in the perovskite to obtain the correct stoichiometry. Evaporating, therefore, a pre-synthesized perovskite material from a single source could shorten the efforts made in the evaporation process and could be ideal for commercial application.
Moreover, high vapor pressure and low decomposition temperatures of organic ammonium halides challenge compositional tuning of the final thin film.25 A single-source vapor deposition technique (SSVD), where the pre-synthesized perovskite powder is sublimed instead of individual precursors, has emerged as one possible solution to overcome such barriers. Few examples of single-source thermal evaporation of perovskite materials are found in the literature. Fan et al. reported firstly the SSVD for halide perovskite thin films and deposited a 400 nm thick MAPbI3 layer leading to a 10% PCE.15 In 2019, Zheng et al. reported the single-source evaporation of two-dimensional perovskite layers (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 with a focus on understanding the crystallization during solvent annealing, reaching an efficiency of 4.67%.26 Similarly Li et al. reported the efficient fabrication of CsPbBr3 by single-source evaporation and reached a PCE of 8.65%.27 In recent work single-source evaporation of CH3NH3SnI3 for Pb-free PSCs reached a PCE of 1.7%.28
Also, inorganic CsPbX3 thin films employing SSVD were reported, and the thin films showed improved crystallinity relative to MSVD.29 It was suggested that during SSVD, at least a portion of the perovskite powder gets sublimed in the form of CsPbX3 instead of undergoing a complete decomposition to CsX + PbX2 as observed for the MSVD process. The rapid, straightforward, and effective operational procedure made SSVD superior to MSVD. Recently, Crane et al. employed the SSVD technique for the ball-milled (FA0.81MA0.14Cs0.05) Pb(Cl0.02Br0.14I0.84)3 perovskite powder, observing PbI2 excess in the deposited film. Excess use of FAI and MABr in the ball-milled powder led to appropriate perovskite formation.25 The presence of unreacted and excess precursor materials could impede the batch-to-batch reproducibility and thin film stoichiometries.
Thus, the simplification of the vacuum deposition technique is paramount, especially when considering the up-scaling of this future technology. Herein, we have successfully employed the SSVD technique to deposit CsFAPbI3 and FAPbI3 thin films from pre-synthesized perovskite powders for the first time. We synthesized the perovskite powders without an excess of the precursors to investigate if stoichiometric thin films can be evaporated from stoichiometric perovskite powders. The structural and optoelectronic studies confirmed the phase-pure thin films with commendable stability, and the perovskite layer compatibility with different underlayers was studied.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated.
2.2 Perovskite powder synthesis
The δ-FAPbI3 powder was synthesized through a previously reported room temperature precipitation method where 2.675 mmol FAI (synthesized from formamidinium acetate) was dissolved in 30 ml of acetonitrile (HPLC grade, Alfa Aeser) by stirring. 2.075 mmol of PbI2 (99%) was added to the stirring solution and the stirring was continued for another 24 hours.30 The yellow powders were filtered, and the residual PbI2 and FAI were removed by washing five times with acetonitrile solvent followed by a one-time wash with diethyl ether. A roto-evaporator was used to remove the solvents, and vacuum dried powder was used for further characterization.
The α-CsFAPbI3 powder was synthesized by annealing the previously reported δ-CsFAPbI3 powder31 in a tube furnace at 150 °C for 1 hour under an N2 atmosphere. Then the obtained α-CsFAPbI3 powder was transferred to a clean vial and kept in the glovebox until use.
2.3 Underlayer and device fabrication
Thin films were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (TEC-15AX, NSG group) previously cleaned with sequential sonication treatment in a 2% Hellmanex solution, acetone, and isopropanol, followed by ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 15 min. A compact blocking layer of TiO2 (planar-TiO2, 30 nm thick film) was then deposited onto the FTO-coated glass substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (1 ml of TAA in 15 ml ethanol), and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, 20 nm SnO2 was prepared by dissolving SnCl4 (Acros) in deionized water (12 μl in 988 μl water). This solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s (1000 rpm s−1 acceleration) on top of the meso-TiO2. After annealing at 190 °C for 1 h a 20 nm thick layer was formed. The MeO–2PACz solution was prepared by weighing 1.5 g into ethanol. The solution was sonicated for 15 min. Then the solution was spin-coated in a nitrogen-filled glovebox deposited on pre-cleaned substrates (10 min additionally in the oxygen plasma). The MeO–2PACz solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 35 s and directly annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. MoO3, TaTm, and Spiro-OMeTAD were evaporated in a PRO Line PVD 75 vacuum chamber from Kurt J. Lesker Company equipped with four thermally controlled sources. 5 nm MoO3 was evaporated at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1 at 76 A, the 10 nm Spiro-OMeTAD was prepared at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1 at ∼290 °C, and 10 nm TaTm was evaporated at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1 at ∼295–300 °C.
The prepared layers were transferred to the PRO Line PVD 75 vacuum chamber from Kurt J. Lesker Company equipped with four thermally controlled sources. The crucibles were filled with the perovskite precursors, and power was applied to sublime the perovskite powders. CsFAPbI3 perovskite powder was evaporated at 0.35 Å s−1 (16.2% power), and FAPbI3 was evaporated at a rate of 1.0–1.5 Å s−1 (16.2%) under a vacuum pressure of ∼1 × 10−6 mbar. During perovskite deposition, the deposition rate of the perovskite powder was kept constant and monitored by a quartz microbalance crystal sensor (QCM) situated above the source. The substrates were kept at room temperature and under rotation of 5 rpm. For n–i–p device fabrication, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (acc. 1000 rpm s−1) from a chlorobenzene solution (80 mg in 1023 μl, 60 mM). The solution contained the dopants: bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li–TFSI) (19 μl from a 517 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile), tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (32 μl) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoro methane)sulfonimide] (FK209 Co(II)TFSI salt) (14 μl from a 517 mg ml−1 stock solution in acetonitrile). Then the 70 nm gold top electrode was evaporated. For p–i–n devices, 20 nm of C60 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) was thermally evaporated followed by 3 nm of BCP (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%). Finally, 1 nm Cr and 70 nm Au were deposited by thermal evaporation as the top electrode.
2.4 Materials characterizations
The XRD patterns of the prepared films were measured using a D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg–Brentano geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded with an LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc.), at an excitation wavelength λ = 450 nm. A Fluorolog TCSPC (HORIBA, Ltd) was used to measure the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) with 760 nm as the detection wavelength.
X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) patterns represented in reciprocal lattice space were obtained at SPring-8 on beamline BL19B2. The samples were irradiated with an X-ray energy of 12.39 keV (λ = 1 Å) at a fixed incident angle on the order of 0.12° through a Huber diffractometer. The 2D-WAXS patterns were measured with a two-dimensional image detector (Pilatus 300K). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a VersaProbe II (Physical Electronics, Inc.) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operating at 1486.6 eV. The spectra were referenced using the Pb 4f signal. Data were processed using CasaXPS.
An FEI Teneo Schottky Field Emission SEM was used for recording the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images by an in-lens detector at an energy of 1.5 kV for top-view imaging and 1 kV for cross-section analysis.
The thermogravimetric measurements were done in a TGA 4000 from PerkinElmer. In the tared crucibles (N5200040) 2–15 mg of sample were added. Then under a nitrogen atmosphere, the following steps were performed: 1 min isotherm at 30 °C, heating up to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, and 1 min isotherm at 700 °C for FAPbI3 and the same but until a higher temperature (1 min isotherm at 900 °C) for CsFAPbI3.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and analysis of pre-synthesized powders
The α-CsFAPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3 powders (termed as CsFAPbI3 and FAPbI3 powder) were synthesized and detailed in the experimental section. The FAPbI3 powder was synthesized accordingly as reported,31 while the CsFAPbI3 powder was synthesized by simply heating the previously reported δ-CsFAPbI3 at 150 °C for 1 hour in a tube furnace (Fig. S1, ESI†).31 We characterized the perovskite powders using X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. XPS was used to analyze the elemental composition and the nature of chemical bonding for both perovskite powders. The signals from the core levels are presented (Fig. S2 for CsFAPbI3 and Fig. S3 for FAPbI3, ESI†). The XPS signals corresponding to Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 at 721.8 and 735.77 eV (Fig. S2a, ESI†), respectively, are visible for CsFAPbI3 powder and a small shift in the I 3d3/2 = 615.38 eV, I 3d5/2 = 626.88 eV (Fig. S3b, ESI†) and Pb 4f7/2 = 134.50 eV, Pb 4f5/2 = 139.40 eV (Fig. S2c, ESI†) and core level signals emerges from the inclusion of the Cs.31,32 The XPS signals for FAPbI3 powder are I 3d3/2 = 615.75 eV, I 3d5/2 = 627.25 eV, for I 3d and Pb 4f7/2 = 134.99 eV, Pb 4f5/2 = 139.92 eV for Pb 4f, without any shift (Fig. S3b and c, respectively, ESI†).31 As depicted in the diffractograms (Fig. S4, ESI†), the powders exhibited exceptional phase purity with no trace of residual components.31,33 The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) values were measured for the FAPbI3 and CsFAPbI3 powders (Fig. S5, ESI†). The FAPbI3 starts to lose FAI at 325–397 °C, while in the case of the CsFAPbI3 powder it starts at 343–497 °C. High-temperature stability and the low phase-transition temperature of both pre-synthesized perovskite powder suggest solvent-free single-source evaporation merits. This opened the pathway of replacing the complicated multisource evaporation with single-source evaporation of pre-synthesized perovskite powders.

3.1.1 PXRD, 2D-GIWAXS, and photophysical characterization of single-source evaporated thin films. 

Fig. 1a shows the schematic description of the single-source evaporation process used to sublime the perovskite powders. It is worth noting that, here, we have not used any precursor materials (like FAI or CsI) in excess as reported in the literature for mixed-perovskites.19 First, the thermal evaporation at subsequent evaporation rates was performed to optimize the thin film deposition process for the perovskite powders (Table S1, ESI†). The deposition rate is directly related to the sublimation power, i.e., the higher the rate, the higher the applied sublimation power. To simplify, we will describe the SSVD process by deposition rate in this paper. The CsFAPbI3 powder was sublimed at three different deposition rates, i.e., 0.25 Å s−1, 0.35 Å s−1, and 1.0–1.05 Å s−1, and the phase purity of each deposited thin film was probed using PXRD measurements. As depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the diffractogram of the as-deposited CsFAPbI3 at 0.35 Å s−1 reveals the characteristic α-phase diffractions, i.e., (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220) and (300).31 A faster deposition at 1.0–1.05 Å s−1 leads to δ-phase with two major reflexes at (022) and (211). Furthermore, the slower deposition at 0.25 Å s−1 led to a mixed-phase perovskite, and the diffractograms identified the presence of (100), (111), and (211) reflections indicating the α-phase along with the (022) and (211) reflections indicating the δ-phase. Similarly, the FAPbI3 powder was sublimed at two different rates, i.e., 1.0–1.05 Å s−1 and 3.0–3.05 Å s−1. At 1.0–1.05 Å s−1 deposition, diffractograms indexed with (010), (011), (120), (022), (012), (021), (122), (130), (022) and (204) reflections indicated the δ-phase. However, deposition at 3.0–3.05 Å s−1 led to a mixed-phase perovskite layer which includes the α- and δ-phases along with excess PbI2 (Fig. S7a, ESI†). We attribute the intense PbI2 presence to the FAI decomposition at a faster deposition rate, which is in agreement with previous reports.24 Furthermore, we annealed, and diffractograms and UV-Vis absorption data were collected from the thin films to probe the phase purity and crystallinity. CsFAPbI3 deposited at 0.35 Å s−1 showed enhanced crystallinity through rapid annealing at 60 °C for 5 s (Fig. S8, ESI†). The reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) (for the as-deposited film from 0.14° to annealed 0.11°) and enhanced peak intensity for (h00) planes indicate the improved crystallinity for the annealed CsFAPbI3 thin film (Fig. S8, ESI†). This is further substantiated by the enhanced UV-Vis absorption coefficient (Fig. S9a, ESI†), and the 0.35 Å s−1 deposition was identified as the optimum for CsFAPbI3 powder. Similarly, the deposited FAPbI3 thin films were annealed at 200 °C for 5 s, and the corresponding diffractograms (Fig. S7b, ESI†) and the absorption data (Fig. S9a, ESI†) are presented with an optimized deposition rate of 1.0–1.05 Å s−1.

We employed 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) at 0.12° (Fig. 2a and b) to track the crystal orientations in the optimized thin films. The integrated q-data analysis identified the presence of δ-CsFAPbI3 in the as-deposited film (Fig. 2c, q = 0.9 A−1), which was not detected in PXRD. As depicted (Fig. 2b), post-annealing at 60 °C resulted in a pure α-CsFAPbI3 film. The azimuthal integration of the GIWAXS films at 100 reflexes (q = 1.0 A−1) showed a preferred crystal orientation along in-plane and out-of-plane at χ100 = 16°, χ100 = 79° (Fig. S10a and b, ESI†) for the unannealed films. However, the post-annealing leads to a reordering of the film resulting in a less-preferred in- and out-of-plane orientation (Fig. S10b, more flat part, ESI†). From the GIWAXS analysis for the post-annealed α-FAPbI3 film (Fig. S11, ESI†), the q-integration of the image identified traces of δ-FAPbI3 in the film (q = 0.8–0.9 A−1). The azimuthal integration of the GIWAXS at 100 reflexes (q = 1.0 A−1) shows a preferred crystal orientation with both in-and out-of-plane at χ100 = 16° and χ100 = 79°, similar to the one described for the as-deposited CsFAPbI3 film (Fig. S11a, and c, ESI†). The collective analyses using UV-Vis absorption, PXRD, and GIWAXS suggest the exceptional phase purity for CsFAPbI3 and a commendable phase purity for FAPbI3 thin films. Moreover, the UV-Vis absorption spectra and the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of α-CsFAPbI3 and α-FAPbI3 thin films (Fig. S9a and b, ESI†) display red-shifting of absorption onset, and the red-shifting PL maximum (from 801 nm to 810 nm) indicates the inclusion of smaller Cs cation inclusion in the FAPbI3 structure.34 This certifies the applicability of our SSVD work in realizing mixed-perovskite thin films. Furthermore, we carried out time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on the optimized CsFAPbI3 and FAPbI3 thin films (Fig. S12, ESI†) and for the lifetime measurements, the samples were excited at 640 nm. The corresponding decays were fitted to a double exponential equation. The fast component (τ1) is related to trap-assisted recombination at defect sites, and the slow component (τ2) corresponds to radiative recombination inside the grains.35,36 As tabulated (Table S2, ESI†), the CsFAPbI3 film exhibits τ1 and τ2 values of 18.89 ns and 61.61 ns, whereas the FAPbI3 thin film showed shorter lifetimes of 1.09 ns and 27.03 ns, respectively. These deposited SSVD thin films have shorter lifetimes than those of the solution-processed perovskites, which indicates trap-assisted recombination in the thin films.37 However, the thin films from vapor deposition techniques typically display short lifetimes,19,38 and optimization of the material properties in the vapor deposition methods is required in the near future.

3.1.2 Stability of thin films. 
The stability of fabricated perovskite layers is crucial for their implementations. The shelf-life of the CsFAPbI3 (Fig. 3a) and FAPbI3 (Fig. 3b) films on glass substrates was monitored by PXRD measurements over two weeks. Contrary to the solution-process method,39,40 the FAPbI3 films showed better shelf-life stability than the CsFAPbI3 film. Upon dry-air storage for 7 days, the CsFAPbI3 layer showed a significant decrement in the (100) reflection intensity along with the emergence of new reflections belonging to the δ-phase (Fig. 3a). Remarkably, the annealed FAPbI3 thin films did not show any sign of degradation within these two weeks, indicating better film stability (Fig. 3b). Further analysis is necessary to quantify the underlying mechanisms.

3.1.3 Morphology and crystallization of thin films. 
The ultimate aim of the SSVD technique is to fabricate the PSCs on an industrial scale, and the compact deposition of multilayers is very crucial for the interfacial issue. It has been widely reported that the chemical groups of the underlayer influence the perovskite formation and stability,41 therefore, we investigated the formation of the perovskite layer on different organic materials. We extended our study to the state-of-the-art used underlayers. MoO3/TaTm (TaTm = N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetra([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine), MoO3/spiro-OMeTAD (N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′ spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine), c-TiO2/SnO2 and MeO–2PACz ([2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazole-9-yl)-ethyl)phosphonic] acid. The underlayer chosen was of interest due to its different chemical nature and functional groups. Specifically, with an aim to deduce the effect induced by the interfacial chemistry between the evaporated perovskite and under layers, we evaporated the perovskite on different underlayers. Various underlayer coated substrates were used for one type of perovskite deposition to ensure that the only variable during the evaporation process is the under-layer used. We used the evaporation rate of 0.35 Å s−1 for the evaporation of the α-CsFAPbI3 powder and the evaporation rate of 1.05 Å s−1 for the evaporation of the δ-FAPbI3 powder. The CsFAPbI3 perovskite films were annealed at 60 °C for 5 s and the FAPbI3 perovskite films were annealed at 200 °C for 5 s to ensure the α-perovskite phase.
TaTm contains only benzene-groups, while Spiro-OMeTAD and MeO–2PACz contain methoxy-groups and, phosphoric acid groups respectively, and SnO2 was used as an electron transporting underlayer to compare with the organic hole transporting underlayers.
TaTm,42 Spiro-OMeTAD,41 and MeO–2PACz24 have been studied as underlayers in vacuum-deposited PSCs, and the influence of functional groups was reported. Marcel Ross et al.24 reported the impact of phosphonic groups in MeO–2PACz on the FAPbI3 perovskite formation during the MSVD process. We have described a positive effect of MeO-groups on the perovskite crystallization, leading to micrometer-sized crystal features.41
Microstructure analysis was undertaken by performing scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Top-view SEM images of the post-annealed α-CsFAPbI3 and α-FAPbI3 thin films deposited with the SSVD (Fig. 4a and b) reveal the formation of large perovskite grains with homogeneous coverage without pinholes at the surface for both types of perovskites. The α-CsFAPbI3 reveals agglomerates and a grain-like feature formed on top of the underlayer MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD and MoO3/TaTm. We made a grain size distribution (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†) and noted that the perovskite formed on the MoO3/TaTm has larger grain sizes with an average grain size of ∼358 nm than the grains on MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD (∼333 nm). On SnO2 and MeO–2PACz, the perovskite grains showed a larger average size (∼455 nm and ∼404 nm) and can be easily distinguished by their grain-like features. The top-view SEM images for α-FAPbI3 show agglomerates of grain-like features for the perovskite on MoO3/TaTm (∼324 nm), while for MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD, pyramid-like grain features (∼484 nm) appear. For the underlayer SnO2 and MeO–2PACz, similar features can be observed for α-FAPbI3 as for α-CsFAPbI3, the grains formed with clear grain boundaries, indicating the larger grain sizes. Larger grains can be observed for the perovskite on SnO2 (∼530 nm) than for the perovskite on MeO–2PACz (∼398 nm). By comparing the crystal size of α-CsFAPbI3 with α-FAPbI3 (excluding the perovskite on top of MoO3/TaTm due to unclear grain-like features), one can observe that the total crystal sizes are smaller for the α-CsFAPbI3 than for α-FAPbI3. This aligns with our hypothesis, where we noted a shift in XRD peak towards a higher 2θ value as a result of the incorporation of Cs into the crystal structures and an increase in intensity due to higher crystallinity. Cs reduces the grain sizes by increasing the density of crystal nuclei during the film formation, leading to reduced grain sizes and the absence of agglomerations.40 The SEM cross-section images (Fig. S15a, ESI†) for CsFAPbI3 indicate that the perovskite layer is not fully crystallized on the underlayers of MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD and MoO3/TaTm. On MeO–2PACz and SnO2, the perovskite crystallization is improved, revealing large crystals (∼450 nm for MeO–PACz and ∼400 nm for SnO2). Similar observations are also inferred from the cross-section images for FAPbI3 (Fig. S15b, ESI†). The FAPbI3 layer generally shows an improved crystallinity than CsFAPbI3, and the perovskite layers are not fully attached to the substrate, revealing either complete separation (MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD and MoO3/TaTm) or pinholes (MeO–2PACz and SnO2). The typical perovskite crystallization was difficult to achieve on MoO3/TaTm and MoO3/Spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting a negative effect of methoxy and benzene-groups on the perovskite crystallization when deposited by SSVD methods.
 Fig. 4  Top-view SEM images of annealed perovskite deposited on different underlayers, (a) α-CsFAPbI3 (0.35 Å s−1) (b) α-FAPbI3, (1.0–1.05 Å s−1): (ev) = evaporated layer and (sp) = spin-coated layer deposited at 0.35 Å s−1. 
Interestingly, the cross-section images for both the perovskites reveal different layer thicknesses when considering the underlayers SnO2 and MeO–2PACz, where the perovskite crystallized with large grains. Of note here, the samples with the similar perovskite were fabricated during the same evaporation process; therefore, this change cannot be explained due to inconsistencies between the evaporation processes. Nevertheless, the cross-sectional images show significant deformity in the perovskite at the interface and reveal a difference in perovskite thickness when comparing the samples deposited on the metal oxide SnO2 (∼400 nm thickness) and the organic underlayer MeO–2PACz (∼450 nm thickness). The interaction of the perovskite can explain this difference in the thickness with the underlayer as metal oxides are known to have a catalytic surface. Olthof et al. reported that a passivation layer of 30 nm of degradation products is deposited first until the perovskite formation can start.42
On the other hand, the perovskite formation already starts after 3 nm of deposition for organic underlayers.41 In earlier studies, we have determined the influence of the underlayer on the co-evaporated methylammonium lead iodide perovskite formation. Metal oxides were significantly hindered due to their catalytic nature, promoting perovskite growth, only after 100 nm precursor deposition.42 In the case of the underlayer SnO2, large holes can be observed independently of the deposited perovskite. Similarly, large holes are also observed for the α-CsFAPbI3 and α-FAPbI3 films with the underlayer of MeO–2PACz. The perovskite layers show a compact nature and contain large grain sizes; however, further optimization of the SSVD process is necessary to prevent the formation of pinholes at the interface to the underlying layer and to fabricate efficient PSCs (Fig. S16, Table S3, ESI†). Our findings suggest the underlayer MeO–2PACz and SnO2 as the HTL and ETL are suitable candidates to continue optimization for the implementation in p–i–n or n–i–p device structures respectively.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the employment of a single-source vapor deposition technique to fabricate CsFAPbI3 and FAPbI3 thin films without the excess usage of FAI or CsI. An array of structural and optical studies suggests the high phase purity of the deposited films. Furthermore, we have analyzed the feasibility of device fabrication from single-source vapor deposition layers and noted that impairment of the perovskite could be seen with all of the state-of-the-art underlayers except on SnO2 and MeO–2PACz. These findings suggest that optimization of the composition of the perovskite powder is crucial when following up on the single-source evaporation as an upgraded technique for large-scale application in the future. Our presented methodology decreases the complexity involved in the formulation of vacuum-deposited halide perovskite thin films by avoiding the use of a multisource deposition crucible.
