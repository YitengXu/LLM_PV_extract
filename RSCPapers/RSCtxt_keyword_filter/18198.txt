    , Accepted 11th October 2017First published on 12th October 2017AbstractCombined theoretical and experimental approaches were implemented to design model far-red sensitive unsymmetrical squaraine dyes in order to estimate the minimum energy barrier required for dye regeneration. Our logical molecular design indicated that it is possible to have a fine control on the energetics within 0.2 eV only by the judicious selection of substituents and alkyl chain length keeping the main π-molecular framework the same. The utilization of the LSDA functional under TD-DFT calculations offered an effective and economical computational method for the reliable prediction of the energetics as well as the absorption maximum of the sensitizers. Among the designed dyes under investigation, SQ-75 exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, having a short-circuit current density of 10.92 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage of 0.57 V and a fill factor of 0.67, leading to a photoconversion efficiency of 4.25% despite having photon harvesting mainly in the far-red region. The best photon harvesting by SQ-75, even with an energy difference of only 0.12 eV between the energy of its highest occupied molecular orbital and redox energy level I−/I3− electrolyte, corroborates the possibility for dye regeneration with such a small driving force.
1. Introduction
Growing demands for energy due to the ever-increasing world population and the standard of human life have increased the fast paced utilization of fossil fuels as major energy resources. This has not only led to the fast depletion of precious non-renewable energy resources, but has also enhanced greenhouse gas emissions leading to the danger of global warming.1 This has imposed an urgent need for the implementation and utilization of renewable energy resources, and solar energy seems to be one of the amicable solutions, owing to its vast availability as a gift from nature.2 The implementation of solar cells is undoubtedly an important strategy to harness this immensely available light energy into directly usable electricity. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as important candidates among the next-generation solar cells, due to their ease of fabrication, economic viability and environmental friendly solar energy harvesting.3 Research and development carried out in the past two decades have led to the achievement of photoconversion efficiency (PCE) over 12%, surpassing the commercially available amorphous silicon solar cells.4 This has become possible by the optimization of various components such as wide band gap mesoporous semiconductors, potential photosensitizers, redox electrolytes and counter electrodes.5–8
Sensitizing dyes play a pivotal role in controlling the overall external PCE since they are directly involved in the trapping of photons from sunlight. It is remarkable to see that the utilization of some potential sensitizers in DSSCs has led to the attainment of PCE beyond 12%, even having photon harvesting mainly in the visible wavelength region from 400 nm to 750 nm.9,10 This has imposed an urgent need for the logical design and development of sensitizers having the capability for photon harvesting in the near infra-red (NIR)-IR wavelength region. Panchromatic photon harvesting by implementing novel NIR sensitizers in combination with the already developed potential visible dyes for further enhancement of the external PCE is therefore highly desired. These two kinds of dyes can be easily incorporated into DSSCs by adopting hybrid or tandem device architectures.11–14 In the past, efforts have been directed towards the design and development of far-red and NIR sensitizers with successful far-red photosensitization, but unfortunately, efficient photon harvesting in the NIR wavelength region of the spectrum is yet to be achieved.15,16
Apart from the wide wavelength photon harvesting, sensitizing dyes must possess energetic cascades with the electron accepting wide band gap semiconductor and redox electrolyte in order to have facile electron injection and dye regeneration, respectively. In this regard, the design and development of efficient NIR dyes are rather challenging, due to the relatively small band gap (Eg). This small Eg of NIR sensitizers imposes strict control of the energetics for their optimal function, and a judicious molecular design is highly desired. At the same time, it becomes very important to know the minimum possible energy barrier for both of the electron injection as well as the dye regeneration. Such knowledge about this energy barrier offset will help in the design of novel sensitizers having the maximum possible wavelength window for a given set of mesoporous wide band gap semiconductors and redox electrolytes. Using model squaraine dyes, we have recently demonstrated that it is possible to control the energetics by 0.1 eV simply by changing the substituents, keeping the main π-conjugated framework the same, by only the alteration of the alkyl chain length.17 At the same time, we have also reported that it is possible to have electron injection from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the photo excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 with the energy barrier as small as 0.16 eV.18
State-of-the-art theoretical calculations using the Gaussian program package have been extensively utilized to facilitate the design and development of novel sensitizers in the recent past.19 The theoretical predictions of the energies of dye molecules in the ground and excited states, along with the electronic absorption spectra, are highly desired in order to accelerate the development of potential sensitizers. Based on our combined theoretical and experimental approaches, we have recently shown that with a logical selection of the basis set and functional under the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), it is possible to minimize the error between theoretically calculated and experimentally observed values of the energetics and electronic absorption maximum (λmax).20 The present investigation deals with the estimation of the minimum possible energy barrier for the regeneration of the oxidized dye from the most widely used iodine-based (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte, using some model unsymmetrical far-red sensitive squaraine dyes with molecular structures as shown in Fig. 1. In combination with our previously reported work on minimum energy barrier for electron injection, the results obtained in this work are expected to synergistically accelerate the development of novel NIR sensitizers. The dyes shown in Fig. 1 were synthesized, characterized and subjected to photophysical investigations, and theoretical calculations were carried out in order to correlate the theoretical results with the experimentally obtained values. The calculated results for the energies of the molecules in the ground and excited states, band gap and λmax for these molecules were then compared with the experimentally observed values to find the optimum molecular structure with the smallest driving force for dye regeneration.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
All of the chemicals and solvents used in this work were of analytical/spectroscopic grade and were used as received without any further purification. The synthesized dyes and their respective intermediates were analyzed for purity by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry, fast ion bombardment (FAB)-mass spectrometry in the positive ion monitoring mode, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (JEOL, 500 MHz) were utilized for structural elucidation. Electronic absorption spectra of the dyes in ethanol solution as well as in thin films were obtained for the dyes adsorbed on TiO2, using a UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO model V550). The energy band diagram for the dyes was constructed after estimating the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the energy band gap (Eg) and the energy of their LUMO. The HOMO energy levels of the sensitizing dyes were estimated using photoelectron yield spectroscopy (Bunko Keiki, model KV-205 HK, Japan). The LUMO energy level was estimated using the relation LUMO = HOMO + Eg, where Eg is the optical band gap; Eg was estimated from the energy corresponding to the onset of the optical absorption edge of the solid-state electronic absorption spectrum of the respective dyes.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the dyes under investigation was performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a Pt counter electrode and working electrode, along with a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. CV studies were conducted using a 2 mM solution of dyes as well as ferrocene and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexa-fluorophosphate in DMF solution, at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. An auto-polarization system (HSV-100, Hakuto Denko, Japan) was used for the CV measurements. Along with dyes, CV measurements were conducted for ferrocene as the reference redox material under similar electrochemical conditions. The HOMO energy level was calculated by measuring the shift in the oxidation potential of the sensitizing dyes with respect to the oxidation potential of the Fc+/Fc redox couple. The fluorescence lifetimes of the dyes in the ethanol solution were measured using a fluorescence lifetime measurement system (Quantarus Tau Model C-11370, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Theoretical quantum chemical calculations pertaining to the structural optimization, calculation of energies of the HOMO and LUMO along with the electronic absorption spectra were executed on a Dell workstation using the Gaussian G09 program package.20 The calculations were performed for the isolated single molecule in the gaseous state using TD-DFT theory, 6-311G basis set and linear spin density approximation (LSDA) as the optimal functional, based on our previously published work.19
DSSCs in this work were fabricated using dye-adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 coated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the photoanode, Pt-sputtered FTO as the counter electrode and the most commonly employed iodine-based redox electrolytes. TiCl4 surface treatment was conducted on FTO before and after the coating of the mesoporous TiO2 layer by screen-printing. Two electrodes were assembled in a sandwich configuration using a hot melt spacer and finally sealed with epoxy resin after the introduction of the electrolyte. FTO glass (2 cm × 1 cm) was subjected to subsequent washing with detergent, distilled water, acetone and isopropanol. The FTOs were then subjected to plasma treatment. The cleaned FTOs were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 minutes at 70° and sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes. DSSCs were fabricated using Ti-nanoxide D/SP paste (Solaronix SA), which was coated on a low E FTO glass (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.) by screen printing. The TiO2 coated FTO substrate was baked at 450 °C for 30 min to fabricate TiO2 layers of about 10 μm thickness. The substrates were again subjected to TiCl4 treatment as described above. The substrate was then dipped in the 0.25 mM ethanolic solution of the respective dyes in the presence of 25 mM of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) acting as the co-absorber for 4 hours. A Pt sputtered FTO glass substrate was employed as the counter electrode. Electrolyte containing LiI (500 mM), iodine (50 mM), t-butylpyridine (580 mM) and MeEtIm–DCA (ethylmethylimidazolium dicyanoimide) (4:6, wt/wt) (600 mM) in acetonitrile was used to fabricate the DSSC. A hot melt polymer film (Meltonix-1170, Solaronix) of 25 μm thickness was used as a spacer.
The photovoltaic performance of the cells was measured using a solar simulator (CEP-2000 Bunko Keiki Co. Ltd, Japan) equipped with a xenon lamp (Bunko Keiki BSO-X150LC) as the light source for simulated solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G. The power of the light exposure from the solar simulator was also adjusted with an amorphous Si photodetector (Bunko Keiki BS-520 S/N 353) to avoid the optical mismatch between the calibration diode and the DSSCs. The photocurrent action spectrum was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 800 nm, with a constant photon flux of 1 × 1016 photon per cm2 at each wavelength in DC mode, using the action spectrum measurement system connected to the solar simulator (CEP-2000, Bunko Keiki, Japan). The cell area was maintained precisely using a black metal mask having an area of 0.2025 cm2 during the measurement of the photovoltaic performance.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical characterizations
Squaraine dyes in general exhibit strong optical absorption in the far-red (550–700 nm) wavelength region, which is attributed to the intramolecular π–π* transitions along with the fluorescence emission in the visible to near IR-region.28 Electronic absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the unsymmetrical squaraine dyes synthesized in this work are shown in Fig. 3. The results pertaining to the photophysical characterizations have been summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 3 clearly indicates that all of the dyes exhibit strong light absorption mainly in the far-red region (550–700 nm) of the spectrum with high molar extinction coefficient (ε) between 1.8–3.5 × 105 dm3 mol−1 cm−1, along with the clear vibronic shoulders between 550–600 nm. Among the dyes considered in this work, SQ-94 exhibited a noticeable bathochromic shift in the optical absorption maximum (λmax) as well as the optical absorption edge. This bathochromic shift could be attributed to the presence of the electron donating methoxy group in the 5th position of the indole ring opposite to the indole ring bearing –COOH group.
The observed Stokes shifts in all of the squaraine dyes under investigation were very low (16–18 nm) indicating the conformational rigidity, i.e., keeping the nearly similar configuration of the dye molecules in both of the ground as well as the excited states.29
Normalized electronic absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed on a thin film of mesoporous TiO2 along with the corresponding results in ethanol solution are shown in Fig. 4. A perusal of spectral features clearly corroborates that upon adsorption of dyes onto the TiO2 surface, there is spectral broadening and increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as compared to that of the corresponding spectrum in the ethanol solution.
 Fig. 4  Normalized electronic absorption spectra of unsymmetrical squaraine dyes in ethanol solution (dotted lines) and adsorbed on to mesoporous TiO2 (solid lines). 
This spectral broadening is attributed to the molecular aggregation in the condensed state and the interaction of the carboxylic acid functional group of the dyes with the TiO2 surface.30 At the same time, a very small vibronic shoulder in the 550–600 nm observed for dyes in solution became highly pronounced after adsorption onto the TiO2. This enhancement in the vibronic shoulder in squaraine dyes has been reported to be associated with dye aggregate formation and is verified by its decrease in the presence of a dye co-adsorber like chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).31
It is worth mentioning here that this broadening in the solid-state is more pronounced towards the lower wavelength region, indicating the dominance of H-aggregates. At the same time, unsymmetrical squaraine dyes SQ-64 and SQ-94 exhibit relatively pronounced absorption and clearly visible absorption peaks in the 400–500 nm wavelength regions, which could be associated with the enhanced intermolecular interactions assisted by H-aggregate formation. In an interesting report, Kim et al. have clearly demonstrated the formation of blue-shifted H-aggregates in squaraine dyes adsorbed on the SnO2 surface.32 H-aggregate formation by these dyes is further supported by relatively diminished fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3) in solution, indicating H-aggregate assisted fluorescence quenching. Xu et al. has also clearly demonstrated that H-aggregated squaraine dyes are nearly non-fluorescent and there was pronounced fluorescence turn-on upon their interaction with the bovine serum albumin.33
3.2 Theoretical MO calculations
Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been widely utilized for the design and development of novel sensitizers for DSSC in order to have a deeper insight about energetics, electronic absorption spectra and electronic distribution.34 Widespread acceptance of DFT for quantum chemical calculation is due to the fact that it takes account of the electron and lone pair correlation, like the ab-initio method, at the diminished computation cost generally observed using the Hartree–Fock method. It has been shown that its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT) gives reliable results for electronic absorption spectra using the standard correlation functional implemented in the Gaussian program package.35 Structural optimization of the squaraine dyes under investigation were conducted using DFT, 6-311G basis set and linear spin density approximation (LSDA) functional under the Gaussian G09 program. Default convergence criteria were maintained for all of the calculations during the geometry optimizations. We have previously shown that utilization of LSDA functional under DFT provides relatively more reliable results for the prediction of not only the HOMO energy level but also the λmax, as compared to other functionals implemented under the Gaussian program for squaraine dyes.36 Electron density distribution after structural optimization in the HOMOs and LUMOs of the dyes under investigation is shown in Fig. 5(a).
 Fig. 5  Calculated HOMO and LUMO orbital diagrams after structural optimization (a) and electronic absorption spectra in isolated gaseous state (b) for unsymmetrical squaraine dyes using the LSDA functional under the TD-DFT and 6-311G basis set. 
The figure clearly corroborates that the electron density in the HOMO of the dyes is mainly located in the central squaraine core, while in the corresponding LUMOs, there is a clear shift of electron density distribution towards the outer indole ring bearing the –COOH functional group. This seamless shift in electron density from the HOMO to LUMO level is very important for the facile charge transfer. At the same time, the presence of sufficient electron density at the anchoring group ensures the good electronic coupling between the excited dye molecules and the 3d-orbital of the TiO2 after the adsorption of dye molecules leading to the efficient interfacial injection of electrons from the excited state of the sensitizer molecule into the conduction band of the semiconductor. It has been widely accepted that TD-DFT provides reliable predictions for the electronic excitation of sensitizers used for DSSCs and the accuracy of the results depends on the functional and basis set employed for the calculations.36,37Fig. 5(b) exhibits the simulated electronic absorption spectra for the unsymmetrical squaraine dyes obtained using the LSDA functional and 6-311G basis set under TD-DFT. It can be seen that simulated electronic absorption spectra exhibit distinct and strong absorption between 500–700 nm associated with π–π* electronic transition and spectral shape, very similar to that of the corresponding results in the solution shown in Fig. 4. It can also be seen that the calculated values of λmax as shown in Table 1 are a bit smaller as compared to the corresponding experimentally measured values in solution, which is because the calculation has been done for the single molecule in the gaseous state where intermolecular interactions are highly diminished as compared to the solution. In the meantime, SQ-90 and SQ-94 exhibit 4–8 nm red-shifted λmax as compared to other dyes, indicating a similar trend to that measured experimentally. Therefore, such a precise and reliable prediction made by TD-DFT in the present case ensures that the functional and basis set selected for TD-DFT calculations are quite adequate.
3.3 Energy band diagram
Dye molecules adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 get excited from the ground state due to incident photons resulting from the intramolecular π–π* electronic transition. The difference in the energy levels of two materials in contact is usually the driving force for electron transfer;38 therefore, sensitizers having higher energy levels compared to the TiO2 conduction band (CB) are susceptible to electron injection after the photoexcitation. As a result, dye molecules attain the oxidized state and need to be reduced by electron transfer from the redox couple (I−/I3−), a process well known as dye regeneration.39 An energetic cascade among the TiO2, CB, dye molecules and the redox couple is highly desired for electron injection and dye regeneration. Utilizing combined theoretical and experimental approaches, we have recently demonstrated that it is possible to inject electrons from the excited dye molecules to the CB of TiO2 with the minimum possible energy barrier as low as 0.15 eV.36 In this work, unsymmetrical squaraine dyes have been logically designed in order to find the minimum possible energy barrier for the regeneration of the excited dye molecules by redox electrolyte using the most widely used I−/I3− redox couple. In a typical DSSC, the dye regeneration efficiency is controlled by the dye molecular structure and the HOMO energy level. The energy diagram for all of the dyes utilized along with the TiO2 and I−/I3− is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Energy band diagram for sensitizing dyes. Values of HOMO energy levels shown in () are experimental values by CV, while those shown in [] are theoretically calculated values using TD-DFT. 
The energy band diagram was constructed by considering the redox potential of the I3−/I− redox couple to be 0.44 V vs. NHE or −4.90 eV with respect to the vacuum level.40 On the other hand, the CB energy level for TiO2 was taken to be −4.0 eV as per the reference reported by Li et al.41 Energy levels of dye molecules in this work exhibit energetics having favourable energy levels with respect to the CB of TiO2 and the redox energy level of the I3−/I− redox couple, ensuring the thermodynamic possibility for electron injection and dye regeneration. Apart from the estimation of the HOMO energy level of the dyes by PYS as shown in Fig. 6, it was also verified by CV, which is one of the most commonly employed techniques in the DSSC research. To accomplish this, first CV was carried out for ferrocene, followed by the measurement of the CV of sensitizing dyes, as shown in Fig. 7 under similar electrochemical conditions. Ferrocene (Fc) has been widely used as a reference material and to define the HOMO energy level of dyes by measuring the shift in the oxidation potential of the dyes with respect to it. In spite of different reports about the absolute potential of the Fc+/Fc redox couple in literature, its oxidation potential of −5.01 eV, based on the report by Su and Girault, has been taken into consideration.42 The validity of this value has also been theoretically verified via the benchmark calculation by Namazian et al.43 Values of the HOMO for all of the dyes estimated by CV not only represent similar trends, but also only a small difference from that determined by PYS, validating the reliability of the reported experimental values.
 Fig. 7  CV of the sensitizing dyes, along with ferrocene as reference, in DMF solution. Peak values of the current for the respective dyes were normalized in order to clearly visualize the shift of the oxidation potential of dyes with respect to ferrocene. 
It is interesting to note that the values of the HOMO energy levels of dyes calculated using TD-DFT depict very good similarity (only an error of 0.01–0.09 eV) to their corresponding experimentally measured values by PYS as well as CV. This further ensures the reliability of our theoretical prediction of the energetics. It can be clearly seen from the energy band diagram that the change in dye molecular structure has a direct and significant impact on their energy levels. SQ-97 depicts its HOMO energy at −5.09 eV and LUMO energy at −3.16 eV, and a downward shift of energy levels was observed in the case the of SQ-90, which could be associated with the presence of the electron withdrawing –Br attached to the indole ring (Fig. 1). Similarly, in the case of SQ-94, there was an upward shift in the energy levels, due to the presence of the electron donating –OCH3 group. Squaraine dyes with long alkyl chains like SQ-75 and SQ-64 exhibited an increase in their energy levels as compared to the dyes with short alkyl chains, reaching HOMO energy levels very near to the I3−/I− redox energy level, with a minimum difference of 0.11 eV for SQ-64. Previously, we showed that there is an upward shift in the energy level of squaraine dyes as a function of increasing alkyl chain length, suggesting the possibility for fine tuning the energetics by controlling the alkyl chain length.44
3.4 Photovoltaic characterizations
Good energetic matching of the unsymmetrical squaraine dyes with respect to the CB of TiO2 and the redox energy level of the iodine-based redox electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 6, encouraged us to investigate their photovoltaic characteristics. Another aim was to probe the minimum driving force required for the dye regeneration, since we have already reported a minimum energy barrier of 0.16 eV for electron injection.36Fig. 8(a) depicts the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve for the DSSCs based squaraine sensitizers measured under global AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination. The photovoltaic parameters deduced from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 2. It can be clearly seen from the figure and table that DSSC fabricated using SQ-75 gave the best photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.25%, having a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.92 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.67. Among the dyes used, this dye SQ-75 exhibited both the highest Jsc and Voc, leading to the best PCE. The reason for the high value of Jsc could be associated with the facile electron injection as well as dye regeneration. This was further supported by very good photosensitization as confirmed by photocurrent action spectral measurement, shown in Fig. 8(b).

In the action spectrum, dye SQ-75 exhibited the highest incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of (∼56%), mainly in the far-red region, with wavelength peaking at around 640 nm and could be responsible for the observation of the highest Jsc in the J–V characteristic amongst the dyes used as sensitizers in this work. A perusal of Fig. 8(b) and Table 2 indicates that for all of the sensitizers used for DSSC fabrication, the integrated Jsc form, IPCE, is lower than that obtained from the J–V characteristics. In fact, there are many reports with similar observations. Some of the possible reasons for this discrepancy are associated with the lower illumination intensity of the monochromatic light during IPCE measurement, recombination processes like trap states, the nature of recombination and space-charge effects.45 Zimmermann et al. have reported that the ∼20% difference between the Jsc obtained from one sun illumination and that extracted from the integration of the IPCE curve represents a reasonable correlation.46 In the present work, in some cases such as for DSSCs based on SQ-94 and SQ-97, this discrepancy is more than 20%, which could probably be due to the relatively enhanced charge recombination as indicated by the hampered Voc.
Organic dyes typically bearing a flat molecular structure are prone to dye aggregation; such dye aggregates, especially blue-shifted H-aggregates, exhibit hampered electron injection as compared to their monomeric dye counterparts.47 This hampers electron injection due to dye aggregation, leading to enhanced back electron transfer or charge recombination, which finally leads to hampered Voc and PCE. Inoue et al. demonstrated that symmetrical squaraine dyes with H-aggregates exhibit poor Jsc as well as poor Voc, both finally leading to the hampered DSSC performance.48 We have already discussed in Section 3.1 that H-aggregated squaraine dyes exhibit enhanced light absorption in the lower wavelength (400–500 nm) region. SQ-75 does not show any absorption in this lower region, even in the solid-state (Fig. 4). Therefore, such a small aggregation of SQ-75 dye molecules could be attributed to the observed highest Voc, which was further supported by an appreciable fluorescence lifetime (1.044 ± 0.005 ns) as shown in Table 1.
In spite of nearly similar energetics, SQ-64 exhibits a drastically hampered PCE of 3.08% (reduced Jsc and Voc), which might be due to increased charge recombination as confirmed by the decrease in fluorescence lifetime (0.9478 ± 0.00423 ns). This increase in recombination could be associated with the hampered electron injection into TiO2, facilitated by H-aggregate formation. It is worth mentioning here that SQ-97 and SQ-94 also exhibit pronounced dye aggregation, as confirmed by solid-state electronic absorption spectra shown in Fig. 4. A perusal of Table 2 and Fig. 7(a) clearly indicate that DSSCs based on dyes SQ-97 and SQ-94 give poor efficiencies of 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively. The presence of enhanced light absorption (Fig. 4) and a clear peak in the action spectra (Fig. 8(b)) in the lower wavelength region (400–500 nm) might be responsible for the hampered PCE, especially Voc. This interpretation is based on our previous reports on the utilization of symmetrical squaraine dyes with small and long alkyl chain lengths for DSSC fabrication. Dyes with short alkyl chain lengths (ethyl) exhibit relatively lower Jsc, Voc and have a clear peak in the 400–500 nm region (associated with dye aggregation), along with hampered external quantum yield as compared to the long alkyl chain (octyl) substituted counterparts.48 Femtosecond transient absorption studies on these two dyes have also indicated that dyes with short alkyl chains have a hampered electron injection efficiency of 75%, as compared to that of its long alkyl chain (90%) counterparts.49
At the same time, relatively decreased lifetimes for dyes SQ-97 and SQ-94 in ethanol solution with measured values of 0.904 ± 0.004 ns and 0.434 ± 0.076 ns, respectively, verify the possibility of relatively enhanced charge recombination leading to lower Voc. It can be seen that by judicious molecular design, we have demonstrated the fine control of the HOMO energy level. It is interesting to note here that unsymmetrical squaraine dye SQ-75 exhibited the highest PCE and the best photon harvesting in the far-red region, in spite of its very small energy difference of 0.12 with respect to the I3−/I− redox energy level. As compared to many efficient sensitizers reported for DSSC exhibiting Voc > 0.7 V, the squaraine dyes used in this work have exhibited relatively lower Voc (0.5–0.6 V), indicating the existence of charge recombination and relatively poor charge injection, as well as dye regeneration. Lower Voc in these dyes could also be attributed to the formation of positive dipoles at the TiO2/dye interface, leading to negative shift of the surface potential, and downward shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge as previously reported by us based on scanning Kelvin probe microscopic investigations.50 Moreover, among the dyes with varying energetics used in this work, SQ-75 exhibited the highest Jsc as well as Voc, in spite of such a small driving force of 0.12 eV for dye regeneration. Combining this newly obtained result on the minimum energy barrier for dye regeneration (0.12 eV) with our result on the estimation of the minimum driving force required for electron injection (0.16 eV),36 it can be concluded that it is practically possible to design and develop novel sensitizers having an energy band gap of 1.18 eV for DSSCs. Such newly designed sensitizers could be utilized for the fabrication of high-efficiency DSSCs using mesoporous TiO2 as the dye adsorption scaffold and the I3−/I− redox electrolyte having the capability of photon harvesting up to 1050 nm.
4. Conclusions
Far-red sensitive unsymmetrical squaraine dyes were logically designed and successfully synthesized using combined theoretical and experimental approaches in order to probe the minimum driving force for dye regeneration. It has been demonstrated that only a slight positional variation of the long alkyl substituents, while keeping the same π-molecular framework (SQ-64 and SQ-75), led to drastic differences in their photovoltaic performances, which was explained by their differential aggregation behavior. It has been shown that the use of the LSDA functional under DFT predicts the energetics and electronic absorption spectrum of squaraine dyes under investigation very well. Calculated values of the HOMO energy level of the dyes exhibit only an error of 0.01–0.09 eV, compared with their corresponding experimentally measured values by PYS, which validates the reliability of our theoretical prediction of the energetics. The highest photon harvesting exhibited by SQ-75 clearly corroborates the possibility for the dye regeneration with a minimum energy barrier of 0.12 eV with respect to the most commonly employed I−/I3− redox electrolytes. In combination with the minimum energy barrier needed for electron injection published earlier by our group, the current result on the need for the minimum driving force of 0.12 eV for dye regeneration indicates the possibility for the novel dye design being capable of photon harvesting up to 1050 nm.
