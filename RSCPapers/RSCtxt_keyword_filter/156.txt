    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 5th June 2019AbstractA new additive method for inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was developed by adding tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) additive into the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 precursor solution. The CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film shows high crystallinity, large grain size, low trap density, and excellent charge transport properties. Finally, the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 15.21%, which outperforms many reported inorganic PSCs. Meanwhile, the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC could retain over 93% of the initial PCE after being stored in a N2 glovebox for 1600 hours.
Due to the outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processability of organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite (OIHP) materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of their solar cells has skyrocketed from 3.8% to a certified value of 24.2% in just a few years.1,2 Despite great progress in the photovoltaic (PV) performance of OIHP material based perovskite solar cells (PSCs),3 lead toxicity and device stability are two key issues that will affect the commercialization of PSCs. Recently, great efforts have been made to develop lead-free perovskite materials and analogues.4 The poor long-term stability is mainly due to degradation and volatilization of organic components.5 Thus, an inorganic halide perovskite, formed by replacing the organic cation with cesium (Cs), is a promising candidate for developing stable devices.
Recently, inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted broad interest because of ideal bandgaps, excellent carrier mobility, and intrinsic stability. CsPbBr3 solar cells were first reported by Hodes et al. and they gave a PCE of 5.95%.6 However, a wide bandgap of 2.3 eV for CsPbBr3 limits its absorption and performance. Thus, the highest PCE for CsPbBr3 solar cells is 10.6% to date.7 On the contrary, CsPbI3 exhibits a suitable bandgap of 1.73 eV, which is suitable for solar cell applications. Its solar cells were first made using the HI additive, giving a PCE of 2.9%.8 Unfortunately, ideal α-CsPbI3 (cubic phase) can only remain stable at high temperature (>300 °C), and would transform to undesired δ-CsPbI3 (non-perovskite phase) at room temperature or under ambient conditions with moisture.8 So it is very hard to fabricate α-CsPbI3-based solar cells using a general experimental method. Then great efforts have been made to address this problem, such as reducing crystal size or dimension engineering,9 adding additives,10 and surface passivation engineering.11 Recently, the CsPbI3 solar cell has achieved the best PCE of 17.06% via phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) post-treatment on the α-CsPbI3 films.11 In addition to these strategies, partially substituting iodide (I) with bromide (Br) is another effective method by tuning the tolerance factor of the perovskite structure, which is a simple approach for balancing the bandgap (light absorption) and structural stability.12 Yip et al. reported CsPbI2Br PSCs with a SnO2/ZnO bilayer electron transport layer (ETL), which gave a PCE of 14.6% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23 V.13 To make high-quality CsPbI2Br films, Liu et al. used the Lewis base adducts PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) as precursors to slow the crystallization of the perovskite film, and a PCE of 14.78% was realized.14 The gradient thermal annealing after anti-solvent preparation can control the growth of CsPbI2Br, yielding a PCE of 16.07%.15 Recently, CsPbI2Br PSCs have achieved a PCE of 16.2%, the highest PCE reported for CsPbI2Br PSCs to date by introducing amino-functionalized polymer PN4N as a novel cathode interlayer, and a dopant-free PDCBT for the hole transport layer (HTL).16 Although great efforts have been made,17 many research works focus on CsPbI2Br or CsPbIBr2, and their PV performances are still sluggish. There is still large room for improving the PCE of CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 solar cells. We believe that the I/Br ratio is an important factor, which should enable CsPb(IxBr1−x)3 to achieve the lowest possible bandgap without sacrificing the phase stability. Thus we used CsPbI2.4Br0.6 as a light absorber in this work.
Here, we report a simple additive method to produce high-quality CsPbI2.4Br0.6 perovskite thin films by adding the tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) additive into the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 precursor solution. The effects of the TBAB additive on the optical properties, crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layers were investigated. The TBAB additive helps to form high-quality films. Solar cells with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/ZnO/perovskite/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/MoO3/Ag were made. The PCE of CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs is increased to 15.21% from 13.75%. The stability of these devices was also studied.
CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films were prepared via a simple one-step solution process using mixtures of CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2 with or without TBAB as precursors (Fig. 1b). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted to analyse the elemental composition of the perovskite film (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the detailed data are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). From the results, the perovskite was named as CsPbI2.4Br0.6. The chemical structure for TBAB, a sort of organic halide salt, is shown in Fig. 1a. The alkyl chain in TBAB may alter the crystallization of the perovskite films, and the halide atoms of TBAB might be ionized during the thermal annealing process, providing free halide ions which may participate in the perovskite crystal formation or may help to form the perovskite crystal with large grain size and good surface coverage.18 In addition, the melting point of TBAB is about 103 °C, and it could be easily removed during the thermal annealing process (280–350 °C). Optical characteristics of these films were investigated. The UV-vis absorption spectra for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films, whose thicknesses were carefully controlled to be the same, are shown in Fig. 1c. These films show nearly the same absorption, and their absorption onset locates at ∼680 nm, which is consistent with a previous report.19 To investigate the bandgap of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films, Tauc plots were plotted based on the above absorption spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†). They show a direct band gap of 1.83 eV. This indicates that adding TBAB to the precursor solution has a negligible variation in absorption and bandgap. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra for glass/SnO2/ZnO/CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and glass/SnO2/ZnO/CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB were measured to explore the charge extraction ability of different perovskite layers in the same electron transport layer. As illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†), they show a broad emission band of about 85 nm centered at 668 nm originating from CsPbI2.4Br0.6. The PL intensity of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film was slightly better quenched, which is mostly due to the enlarged grain size with fewer defects and the reduction of surface defects of CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films that will be discussed in the morphology characterization section.20

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films are shown in Fig. 1d. For both films, the main diffraction peaks at 14.45° and 29.31° were observed, corresponding to the (100) and (200) planes of the α-CsPbI2.4Br0.6 black phase. Besides, no other peaks obtained from any impurity phase are observed in the XRD patterns. When TBAB was applied, no additional peaks showed up. Meanwhile, the diffraction intensity of the perovskite film with the TBAB additive is higher than that of the pristine film. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) could be extracted from Fig. 1d. The FWHM of the (100) peak reduced from 0.205° to 0.186°, and the FWHM of the (200) peak reduced from 0.230° to 0.217° when TBAB was added (Fig. S4, ESI†). This indicates that the enhanced crystallinity and a larger grain size with fewer grain boundaries are caused in the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film. The larger grain size could be observed from the following scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization.
Furthermore, the morphology for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films on glass/ITO/SnO2/ZnO substrates was studied via SEM. As shown in the SEM images of Fig. 2a and c, both films exhibit a relatively smooth and uniform surface coverage without observable pinholes. However, the grain size of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film is larger than that of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 film. The distribution statistics of grain size for these films, derived from SEM images (Fig. S5, ESI†), are shown in Fig. 2b and d. Importantly, the average gain size of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 film is 312 nm, and it increased to 496 nm when TBAB was applied. This is in good agreement with the XRD results. We assumed that TBAB might provide interactions with the perovskite, and could alter the crystallization kinetics for the perovskite films.18 Moreover, larger grain sizes would lead to fewer grain boundaries, which is beneficial for charge transport and reduces charge recombination. Consequently, uniform coverage with larger grain size and fewer defects may be one of the reasons for improved PV performance of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film.

To further explore the trap-state density, we fabricated the electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/ZnO/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag (inset in Fig. 3a and b) and measured dark current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the devices (Fig. 3a and b). As shown in Fig. 3, the I–V curves show three regions of behaviour. The first region at low bias voltage is the ohmic region (n = 1). The second region is the trap-filling region, where the current quickly increases when the bias voltage exceeds the kink point (known as the trap-filled limit voltage, VTFL). From this region, the trap-state density can be determined by VTFL using the equation:21  where e is the electron charge, ntrap is the trap-state density, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant for CsPbI2.4Br0.6. The VTFL of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films is 1.08 and 0.85 V, respectively, indicating a reduced electron trap density of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film. The lower trap-state density of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film could be attributed to the high quality film, as corroborated by XRD and SEM results. The decrease of trap-state density results in reduced charge recombination, leading to increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE of the PSCs. The third region at high bias voltage is the trap-free space charge limit current (SCLC) region (n = 2). From this region, electron carrier mobility could be calculated according to the Mott–Gurney law:22  where J is the current density, μ is the mobility of electrons, and V is the effective voltage. The electron mobility of CsPbI2.4Br0.6 is 4.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while it increased to 1.93 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after TBAB was applied, 4.6 times higher than its original value (Fig. S6, ESI†). This finding suggests that CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB has better electron transport, which contributes to the high Jsc and fill factor (FF) in the PSCs.

To evaluate PV performance for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB films, perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/SnO2/ZnO/perovskite/PTAA/MoO3/Ag (Fig. S7, ESI†) were made. The TBAB content, annealing temperature, and annealing time were carefully optimized (Fig. S8–S10 and Tables S2–S4, ESI†). The current–voltage (J–V) curves for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs and their performance data are presented in Fig. 4a and Table 1. The cell fabricated without TBAB exhibits a PCE of 13.75%, with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 16.16 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.94%. When TBAB was introduced, the PCE of the PSC was improved. When the film was optimized, the PCE of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC was improved to 15.21%, with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 17.50 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.75%. These findings indicate that the improved PV performance of CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB could be mainly attributed to the increase of the Jsc and FF. Moreover, the higher Jsc and FF may be due to the lower trap density, reduced charge recombination, and higher electron mobility of CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB. Furthermore, an increase in the TBAB content leads to the decline of PCE. The performance data for the cells using the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film annealed at different temperatures and different times are presented in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs are shown in Fig. 4b. Compared with the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 based PSC, the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC shows enhanced EQE at 320–680 nm, consisting of higher Jsc. The integrated current densities obtained from the EQE spectra of CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs are 15.17 and 16.33 mA cm−2, respectively. The enhanced EQE might be caused by enhanced charge transport and decreased charge recombination.

The PCEs of the reported inorganic perovskite solar cells are presented in Fig. 4c, and the detailed performance data of these PSCs are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). Although many kinds of inorganic perovskite materials have been attempted to fabricate PSCs, only a few works could realize a PCE of over 15%. This is the first time that CsPbI2.4Br0.6 was applied for inorganic PSCs. CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB film based PSCs delivered a PCE of 15.21%, which outperforms many reported inorganic PSCs. The stability of CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs without encapsulation was studied when being stored in a N2 glovebox (O2 < 10 ppm; H2O < 0.1 ppm) (Fig. S11, ESI†). As can be seen, the PCE of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 based PSC drops relatively faster and to 76% of its initial value after 1600 hours, while the PCE of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC can remain over 93% of the original value after 1600 hours, indicating that the device possesses better stability. The improved result might be due to better film quality.
To investigate the charge transport properties of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 and CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSCs, the transient photovoltage decay (TPV) and transient photocurrent decay (TPC) were measured. As shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†), the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC shows a longer charge-recombination lifetime (92.41 μs), compared with that of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 based PSC (74.13 μs). Furthermore, the charge-extraction time of the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC is 0.03 μs, which is much smaller than 0.12 μs in the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 based PSC (Fig. S12b, ESI†). These findings indicate that charge recombination is slower and charge extraction efficiency is higher in the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC, which is due to reduction in charge traps. These results may account for the higher Jsc and FF in the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new TBAB additive in CsPbI2.4Br0.6 inorganic perovskite to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. It is found that, by introducing the TBAB additive, CsPbI2.4Br0.6 perovskite films were formed with higher crystallinity, larger grain size, fewer defects, and higher electron mobility. Compared with the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 based PSC (PCE 13.75%), an impressive PCE of 15.21% for the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC is achieved, which outperforms many reported inorganic PSCs. In addition, when stored in a N2 glovebox, the CsPbI2.4Br0.6-TBAB based PSC could retain over 93% of the initial PCE after 1600 hours. Thus, this additive method would provide a promising strategy to improve the performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells.
