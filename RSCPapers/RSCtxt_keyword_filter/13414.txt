Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) have gained considerable attention in view of their potential use in various industrial applications to circumvent the setbacks of volatile organic solvents. The common classes of cations encompass imidazolium, pyridinium, phosphonium, and ammonium, whereas the anions are usually inorganic such as halides, sulphates, and phosphates.1 ILs are molten salts that have negligible vapour pressure, superior electrochemical and thermal stability and high ionic conductivity.1,2 Due to these desirable properties, ILs have been extensively explored in several industrial and research fields such as extraction and separation processes, lubricants, waste recycling, catalysis, gas separation, CO2 capture and Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs).3,4
Generally, the characteristic properties of ILs vary with different combinations of cations and anions. The structures of ILs directly impact upon their properties, in particular the transport properties, such as viscosity. Viscosity is a physicochemical characteristic that well defines a fluid's internal resistance to flow and can be described as a measure of fluid friction.1,5 According to this definition, it can be theorized that the higher the viscosity, the bigger the internal friction of compounds. Viscosity information of fluids and their mixtures needs to be considered in industrial design of process equipment such as heat transfer equipment, process piping, reactors and stripping columns including other process units used in major chemical, oil, paint, clay, dairy and food industries.5 As the flow behaviour is highly affected by the fluid viscosity, this factor must be considered as an input for process analysis, simulation and optimization purposes. In the field of electrochemical devices such as dye sensitized solar cells, the potential use of ionic liquids has been explored as an alternative to replace organic solvents to counter the sealing issue due to possible leakage and evaporation of the organic solvent. This constitutes the major drawback of organic solvents, which shortens the device lifespan and thus limits its commercialization.6–8 On the other hand, pure ILs in comparison with organic solvents exhibit higher viscosity and lower ion mobility, which may hinder the transport process of ions (namely iodide/triiodide) in electrolytes and decrease the efficiency of restoring the oxidized dye due to the diffusion coefficients of triiodide in ILs.9,10
In fact, numerous studies have been carried out to formulate a suitable IL-based electrolyte for DSSC applications. It has been reported that binary ionic liquids formed by mixing another IL of lower viscosity in the pure IL solvent of a DSSC can reduce the overall viscosity of the electrolyte and improve the solar cell performance. The power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on a cis-(SCN)2bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate)ruthenium (N3) sensitizer was improved from 2.6% to 4.99% by the addition of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [C2C1im][BF4] into the 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide [C3C1im]I electrolyte, which is a 92% improvement.11 A novel cost-effective and low-viscosity binary room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) mixture of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate [C2C1im][TFA] and 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide [C3C1im]I with an overall power conversion efficiency of 5.22% was reported, which represents a 30% improvement.12 Yusof and Yahya13 reported that a binary ionic liquid electrolyte of [C3C1im]I and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate [C4C1im][SCN] at a ratio of 1:0.75 yields improved conversion from 1.19% to 1.89%.
Despite the observed perks, the experimental determination of the binary IL viscosity is time-consuming, expensive and unrealistic as there are more than 108 ILs that can be obtained by different sets of anions and cations.14 Hence, a priori prediction of the viscosity value would provide a preliminary understanding that aids in selection and design of suitable ILs. In fact, recently much attention has been devoted to research on the prediction of ILs’ viscosity.3,14,15 Generally, there are two main categories of approach, namely the group contribution method (GCM) and the quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) approach.
In the GCM, development of the relationship between the chemical sub-structures and the desired physical property is needed as the addition of the contributions of certain defined groups of atoms will then enable one to predict the estimated property value.5,16 In 2008, Coutinho and Gardas17 recommended an Orrick–Erbar-type approach with the GCM to predict the IL viscosity. They investigated 500 experimental data points comprising 29 imidazolium-, pyridinium- and pyrrolidinium-based ILs with temperature ranging from 293 to 393 K and viscosity ranging from 4 to 21000 mPa s. Although the model has an acceptable AARD of 8%, the equation contains a density term, which needs to be estimated prior to the calculation, thus becoming a disadvantage. One year later, they attempted to improve the previous model by using the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) equation as follows: (1)where ni is the number of groups of type i, k is the total number of different groups in the molecule, and T is temperature in K, while ai,η, bi,η and T0η are adjustable parameters. Their model indeed shows a good agreement between experimental and calculated viscosity values (R2 = 0.991, AARD = 7.50%). However, an empirical fitting parameter T0η, known as the Vogel temperature, is required. Estimation of this parameter is done by assuming the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the IL is known, otherwise the VTF equation is not applicable for prediction of the IL viscosity.
To overcome this limitation, Gharagheizi et al.5 introduced a GCM for viscosity value prediction of 443 ILs (1672 data points) (R2 = 0.874, AARD = 6.32%) coupled with 4 different temperature terms as follows: (2)where Nai and Nci are the number of occurrences of the i-th sub-structure of the anions and cations, and ηai, ηci and η0 are the contribution of the i-th sub-structure of the anions and cations, and the intercept, while A, B and C are constants, respectively. The model shows fairly good results, but the model is heavily trained on ILs containing the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion, thus the model may not be applied for ILs with different anions. In addition, the data set used to develop the model contained 638 duplicates, thus only 1034 data points used were unique. Consequently, by removing the duplicated values, the average error in terms of log(η) increases to 7.06%. Sattari et al.3 also presented a similar approach by using the Arrhenius equation to develop a predictive model to correlate and estimate the viscosity with temperature dependency of fluorine-containing ionic liquids (F-ILs). They tested the model using two extensive datasets in which one was from reliable sources consisting of 863 experimental viscosities for 85 F-ILs (R2 = 0.977, AARD = 3.23%), and the other was collated from unreliable sources consisting of 1160 experimental data points for 332 F-ILs (AARD = 4.85%). Nevertheless, this model is not applicable for other types of ILs.
In recent years, application of machine learning algorithms has become an interesting topic in the modelling field. Baghban et al.1 proposed a GCM combined with the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) approach, which included 1672 data points for 443 different ILs with a wide range of temperatures (253.15–433.15 K), that gives a high R2 value (0.98) and low AARD (1.47%). On the other hand, Paduszyński and Domańska18 reported a model which employs a two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (FFANN) strategy to correlate the viscosity with input variables encompassing temperature, pressure and group contributions. Given that they have used an extensive database consisting of more than 13000 data points, an R2 of 0.972 and an overall AARD of 14.7% achieved for the test set can be perceived as satisfactory, but the model requires 242 GC inputs, which is excessive and cumbersome for users to obtain. The main advantage of using the group contributions method is its simplicity. Prediction with reasonable accuracy can be easily performed provided all the necessary inputs are known from experimental data for every structural element. Although these models provide accurate predictions for the viscosity of ILs, the viscosity for certain ILs could not be estimated due to the lack of some group contribution values and those values are an indispensable input in the GCM.
QSPR is another impactful approach in establishing a quantitative relationship between a physicochemical property and a series of descriptive parameters related to the molecular structure.19 The established QSPR correlation equation can be applied to prioritize or screen compounds with the desired property and fill the gaps in data.20 The main descriptors used in existing models that affect the viscosity values are quantum chemical, electrostatic, and constitutional species. Based on several recent attempts on establishing accurate and efficient methods for describing the IL viscosity, temperature is undeniably a significant parameter to be incorporated into the regression model. Chen et al.21 developed a simplified QSPR model based on temperature, molecular weight, and group contributions from cations and anions as the descriptors, using 304 data points for viscosity prediction of 26 imidazolium-based ILs (R2 = 0.9888). However, the number of anion types used is only 8, thus the model may be lacking extrapolation ability. Additionally, the QSPR model still relies on GC input, which does not differentiate the model from the previous GC models. In 2016, a novel temperature-dependent structure–property model of viscosity for ionic liquids was introduced by Barycki et al.15 with descriptors consisting of the size and branching of the cation and the size, shape, symmetry and the vertical electron binding energy of the IL's anion for 23 ILs (R2 = 0.968). Despite a high goodness of fit, the descriptors of these equations require significant effort to be calculated. A simple correlation is more favourable as compared with a complicated predictive model in practical applications so that iterative calculations can be user-friendly, thus simplicity of the equation was considered in this study.
Yan et al.14 applied the serial norm indices method using atom properties such as the van der Waals radius, electronegativity, atomic weight, atomic charge and branching degree to formulate a η–T–P model as follows: (3)where β, γ and χ are adjusted based on molecular structures. Their model included 3228 data points of 349 ILs and covered temperatures ranging from 253.15 K to 573.00 K (R2 = 0.964, AARD = 4.62%). The parameters used in both the aforementioned models are related to molecular structures as well as cation–anion interactions, which can improve the predictive accuracy. It is undeniable that their models generate a high goodness of fit. Nevertheless, they do not provide molecular insights and understanding on the contribution to viscosity of each parameter. It is essential to develop a model which gives a valuable theoretical basis for the significance of each factor affecting the viscosity.
On this note, Yu et al.19 established 8 QSPR correlation equations for 8 sets of data at different temperatures which included 344 ILs to predict the viscosity of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Tf2N]−-based ILs with a temperature range 283–343 K (R2 > 0.82). Their models indeed promote some understanding of the importance of different intermolecular interactions towards the viscosity change, for instance the viscosity at lower temperature is mainly driven by van der Waals forces, while at high temperature, steric structural or geometric factors possess higher impact. Despite being interesting, as mentioned earlier, their models are generated solely based on one anion, thus all calculations have to be repeated for different sets of cation–anion pairs to determine the proper correlation coefficient. Another drawback associated with their model is that the data being split according to temperature would drastically confine its application to predict viscosity at any temperature. A universal correlation for a wider range of ILs is of importance.
These shortcomings encouraged us to build a comprehensive QSPR model that not only has high accurate predictive capability and simplicity but also features valuable insights into the impact of each class of molecular interaction energy on the IL viscosity. In the present study, the viscosity of a large number of ILs has been estimated and correlated via a stepwise regression approach with a set of descriptors, namely the interaction energies of the IL cation–anion pairs generated by the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). The performance and accuracy of the predictive model was evaluated by undertaking statistical error analyses of the results. Based on their linear dependence, an extended list for the viscosity of ILs is proposed in this work.
Methodology
Dataset
Various experimental data available in the literature were collected to build the predictive model.14,22–36 The database was prepared consisting of 100 data points (40 ILs) with a wide range of temperatures (273.15–393.15 K) at atmospheric pressure. Most sources of the data points reported minimal and negligible traces of impurities such as water and residual chloride. This assures the reliability of the data points used to build our model as the presence of water reduces the viscosity of ILs, whereas the presence of chloride contamination increases the viscosity of ILs.37 The cations include 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [C2C1im]+, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [C4C1im]+, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium [C3C1im]+, 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium [C4C1C1im]+, 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium [C5C1im]+, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium [C6C1im]+, 1-heptyl-3-methylimidazolium [C7C1im]+, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium [C8C1im]+ and 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium [C10C1im]+, whereas the anions include bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [N(CF3SO2)2]−, bromide Br−, chloride Cl−, iodide I−, methanesulfonate [CH3SO3]−, tetrafluoroborate [BF4]−, acetate [CH3CO2]−, dicyanamide [N(CN)2]−, ethylsulfate [C2H5SO4]−, hexafluorophosphate [PF6]−, methylsulfate [CH3SO4]−, perclorate [ClO4]−, nitrate [NO3]−, tetracyanoborate [B(CN)4]−, thiocyanate [SCN]−, tricyanomethanide [C(CN)3]−, trifluoroacetate [CF3CO2]− and trifluoromethanesulfonate [CF3SO3]−. The anions used cover a broad range of polarity, from highly polar Cl−, to relatively non-polar [N(CF3SO2)2]−. The chemical structures of the cations and anions are depicted in Fig. 1. The training set was constructed using the experimental viscosity data collected from the work published by Yan et al. (80 data points).14 The constructed model was then tested using the test set where the experimental data points were taken from several kinds of published literature other than Yan et al. (20 data points).22–36 The ratio of the number of data points of the training set to that of the test set is in accordance with the rule of thumb.5 The training set is used to develop the model while the test set is used to validate and fine tune the model. Both the training and test set data are provided in Table S1 in the ESI.†

COSMO-RS
The Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS), developed by Klamt,38 is a quantum chemical based framework used to predict the thermodynamic properties of pure and mixed fluids. From COSMO calculations, three intermolecular interaction energies, namely electrostatic/misfit (EMF), hydrogen-bonding (EHB) and van der Waals forces (EvdW) can be estimated.39 These energies are described by eqn (4)–(6), respectively: (4) EHB = αeffcHBmin(0;min(0;σdonor + σHB) × max(0; σacceptor − σHB))(5) EvdW = αeff(τvdW + τvdW′)(6)where σ and σ′ are the screening charge densities of two different segments; aeff, σ′, cHB and σHB are the effective contact surface area, the misfit energy constant, the hydrogen bond coefficient and the cutoff of hydrogen bonds, respectively; σdonor and σacceptor represent the screening charge densities of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor segments, respectively; and τvdW is the element-specific vdW interaction parameter. Additionally, these three interaction energies form the total interaction energy EINT as described in eqn (7): EINT = EMF + EHB + EvdW(7)
There have been several successful attempts made by researchers in developing models based on these energy descriptors generated by COSMO-RS to predict the hydrogen-bond basicity of ILs,40 the ability of ILs as thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors for methane hydrates41 and the contact angles and wettability of ionic liquids on polar and non-polar surfaces.42 In this work, the IL cation–anion pair interaction energies were generated using the COSMOthermX program with the parameter file BP_TZVP_C30_1201 to develop the model. All the COSMO files required are available in the COSMOthermX database. The IL cation–anion interaction energies generated are provided in Table S1 in the ESI.† The additional descriptor considered in this model is 1/T as the viscosity is temperature dependent.
Development of the model
The crux in developing a QSPR model is to develop and establish a relationship between the molecular descriptors and desired physical property. For simplicity, a multi-linear relationship between the viscosity and interaction energies is assumed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a common method used in QSPR due to its simplicity, transparency, reproducibility and interpretability.5,20 This method correlates a set of data points of a desired property (y) with one or more descriptors (xn) in a linear form as described in eqn (8):16 (8)where y represents the property value, xn is any molecular descriptor and an is the regression coefficient. Furthermore, a stepwise model-building approach was applied.42 The correlation model was initiated using only one single descriptor as a variable. Then, the model was recurrently improved by adding or eliminating a new variable until no further improvements can be made. The best MLR equation was selected based on the lowest Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD) and the highest R-squared (R2) value as screening criteria. The accuracy of the final QSPR model was ascertained by more statistical analyses including the Standard Deviation Error (STDE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Results and discussion
The viscosity of ionic liquids is one of the pivotal properties in developing these fluids for numerous applications, especially as electrolytes for DSSC applications. Thus, systematic analysis of the effect of the interaction energies on their viscosity is of high interest. Since all systems studied in this work share imidazolium-based cations, it allows us to evaluate the impact of the alkyl chain length and anion on the viscosity. The experimental and predicted viscosity values are given in Table S1 in the ESI.†
QSPR model for the prediction of viscosity
The correlations between the selected descriptors and viscosity upon stepwise regression are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. A total of 80 experimental viscosity data points of imidazolium-based ionic liquids, gathered from Yan et al.,14 were used as the training set data to build the predictive model. The first three equations (cf. eqn (9)–(11)), consist of (i) the individual interaction energy that arises from each cation and anion, and (ii) temperature.

Based on Table 1, it shows that hydrogen-bonds have less impact on the viscosity as compared to electrostatic forces and van der Waals forces. As interactions in such polar and non-coordinating liquids are complex, the influence of electrostatic as well as van der Waals bonding on the viscosity is significant.43 The correlation using EvdW produced the highest R2 and F values as well as the lowest AARD values when compared to the other single interaction energy correlations. This indicates that the van der Waals interaction energies between the cation and anion of an ionic liquid play a dominant role in the magnitude of the flow resistance of these fluids. In general, ILs with higher cation–anion interaction energies correspond to a higher viscosity value. Additionally, all equations are in good agreement that temperature is an indispensable descriptor as the viscosity decreases when the temperature increases, which follows the Arrhenius rule.44
Although a simple 3-descriptor correlation using EvdW and 1/T can be reasonably proposed for the prediction of viscosity, this model only yields an R2 of 0.8723 and an F value of 173.0131. In fact, higher R2 and F values are necessary to allow better prediction capability and reliability as the ILs used to train the model are limited. Consequently, the correlation of viscosity using a multi-descriptor approach was attempted. Note that ERing was not considered as the study is limited to imidazolium-based ILs. Since EvdW was deemed as the dominant interaction energy, extra descriptors were further added to eqn (11), resulting in a series of eqn (12)–(14) as listed in Table 1. Addition of EMF or EHB to eqn (11) results in similar R2 and F values and thus these 5-descriptor correlations are not statistically significant. Interestingly, major improvements in the R2 and F values, 0.9812 and 537.0863, respectively, can be observed by combining all three types of interaction energies, which signifies that the viscosity is also controlled by electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions to a minor extent.
The model was then optimized by summing the cation and anion contribution for each interaction energy. As a result, the total misfit interaction energies and total hydrogen-bonding interaction energies are giving similar correlations as compared to the respective cation–anion energies. However, the total van der Waals energies EvdW do not contribute similarly to the model, which indicates that the impact of dispersion interactions is asserted differently by the cations and anions. Despite the simplification, eqn (15) still yields comparatively high R2 and F values with respect to eqn (14).
By using eqn (15), the test set collated from various literature sources is plotted to further analyse the reliability and goodness of fit of the model. The cross-plot of experimental data versus calculated/predicted data is presented in Fig. 3. The calculated statistical error parameters for ln(η) are shown in Table 2. According to Fig. 3, a tight cluster of points close to the trend line elucidates the robustness of the proposed QSPR model for the prediction of the viscosity of imidazolium-based ILs.

The relative deviations for both the training and test set data are plotted in Fig. 4. It shows that more than 90% of the relative deviations are within ±10%. One possible reason for the observed deviations of the predicted values from the experimental values, especially the test set, is due to discrepancies in the experimental viscosity values of the ILs which are not as reliable as claimed. Nevertheless, the overall R2 of more than 0.95 and overall AARD of 4.66% have shown that all 5 descriptors have a significant impact on the estimation of the viscosity. Another point worth highlighting is that both our training set and test set contain totally different sets of ILs, which means that our model has the capability to predict the viscosities of other ILs accurately.

Effect of the alkyl chain length on the viscosity
Aiming to determine the influence of the alkyl chain length on the viscosity of imidazolium-based ILs, a comparison of the different sets of results is carried out here. Fig. 5 presents the effect of the alkyl chain length on the viscosity of ILs. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the viscosity of imidazolium-based ILs paired with the [PF6]− anion increases with increasing alkyl chain length. This is in good agreement with experimental results reported by Xue et al.36 which show that the viscosity of [CNC1im][N(CF3SO2)2] increases from [C3C1im][N(CF3SO2)2] (43 mPa s) to [C7C1im][N(CF3SO2)2] (82 mPa s) at 298.15 K. Martins et al.48 also revealed that the viscosity of water-saturated asymmetric ionic liquids increases with increasing alkyl chain length at 0.1 MPa. Ebrahimi49 carried out a comparison study for imidazolium-based ILs paired with the alaninate anion [ALA]− and showed that a higher viscosity value was obtained for [C10C1im][ALA] (ln(η∞) = 11.4039) as compared to [C2C1im][ALA] (ln(η∞) = 10.5992). An increasing alkyl chain length, which means an increase in the cationic size or more specifically the number of –CH2– units, enhances the van der Waals interactions in the context of the alkyl chain–ion inductive forces and the CH–CH bond interaction.49,50 As the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain increases, the impact of van der Waals forces becomes more dominant and causes an increase in viscosity attributed to the higher frictional forces among ions, aggregates and clusters.

Effect of different anions on the viscosity
Driven by the prediction results presented above, eqn (15) was then used to predict the viscosity values of other ILs not studied in this work (or ILs with no available experimental data). A database of viscosities comprising 9 different 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based cations combined with 42 anions resulting in a total of 378 ILs was built. The full name, abbreviation, and cation or anion numbering of the ILs are given in Table S2 in the ESI.† The predicted viscosity values are given in Table S3 in the ESI† and depicted in Fig. 6. In general, ILs composed of phosphate or borate anions display low viscosity regardless of the alkyl chain length. In contrast, halide ions (anions number 40 to 42) display high viscosity values, which compliments their high melting point properties.51 ILs that are paired with highly symmetric anions such as [PF6]− or almost spherical anions such as I− are more viscous, while weakly coordinating or less symmetric anions such as [N(CF3SO2)2]− favour lower viscosity.21 Additionally, the predicted viscosity values support the idea that despite the fact that the alkyl chain length affects the viscosity, the IL anion presents a higher contribution to the variation in the viscosity value. Nevertheless, variations in an IL's structure can be utilized to fine-tune its physical properties depending on certain requirements of the application. In short, Fig. 6 can be used as a priori information for selection of suitable ionic liquids before carrying out experimental trial-and-error activity.

Comparison with existing models
The existing predicted viscosity data from COSMOthermX was used for comparison to verify the predictive performance of the model proposed in this work. Fig. 7 presents the experimental viscosity value, predicted viscosity value from COSMOthermX and predicted viscosity value from the present work for [C4C1im]+ paired with [N(CF3SO2)2]− while Fig. 8 presents the values for [C4C1im]+ paired with [PF6]−. The viscosity values are given in Table S4 in the ESI.† Examination of the result clearly shows that our model has improved the statistical goodness of fit as compared to the COSMO model, even though the COSMO model was built with more than 50% of its training data being [N(CF3SO2)2]−-based ILs.52 The GCM model reported by Gharagheizi et al.5 shows low deviation between experimental and calculated values in Fig. 7 but high deviation in Fig. 8 as their model uses a large number of data points containing the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion and contains duplicated data points. In comparison, every data point used in our training set and test set is unique. The predictive capability of the model of Yan et al.14 is surprisingly accurate for an extensive database but the model is complex and requires more effort in calculating the input required by the equation. Our model provides a much simpler calculation with only 3 parameters to be obtained using the COSMO-RS software. Nevertheless, our model has a limitation in which the predicted values slightly deviate from the experimental value at much higher temperature (>320 K), which may be due to the tendency of hydrogen bonds to dissociate at higher temperature as there is a change in the material structure.43 Thus, enhancement can be done in the future to improve the reliability of our model in predicting viscosity values of ILs at temperatures above 320 K.

To further verify the predictive performance of the model proposed in this work, the overall R2 values of two GCM models and four QSPR models with multiple types of ILs were used for comparison. Table 3 lists the compared parameters for each model reported in the literature. The result shows that our model has a comparable statistical result as compared to the QSPR models of Barycki et al.15 and Yan et al.14 The R2 value of the COSMO model reported by Eiden et al.52 is 0.91, which is lower than that of our model (R2 = 0.965). The model by Baghban et al.1 using a GCM combined with the LSSVM method demonstrated an R2 of 0.973. However, the GCM is limited to the number of group functions used in the model, and thus cannot be applied when a new group is introduced. Our model (R2 = 0.965) is more accurate than the linear model proposed by Yu et al.,19 which does not have a universal correlation. All these results showed that our QSPR model is robust and could accurately describe the viscosity of ILs at various temperatures.

Conclusions
In this study, a QSPR model was successfully built to estimate the viscosity of imidazolium-based ionic liquids at different temperatures. A comprehensive data set of 100 viscosity data points belonging to 40 ILs composed of 18 anions and 9 cations was employed to develop this model. A training set composed of 80 experimental data points was correlated with a low AARD% (4.28). A test set consisting of 20 data points was used to validate this model. It shows an AARD% of 6.17 for the test set and an overall AARD% of 4.66 as well as a good R2 of 0.965 for all the data points. Herein the model proposed in this study is reliable and can be used to predict viscosities. Unlike general predictive models, stepwise regression was performed to provide valuable and interesting understanding of the impact of different classes of interaction energies on the viscosity. The van der Waals forces were found to have the most important effect on the viscosity of ILs followed by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions. Furthermore, both electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction energies have a collective effect from both the cation and anion, but the impact of van der Waals interactions is asserted differently by the cation and anion. It should be pointed out that this work provides valuable knowledge to the ionic liquid research community encompassing the impact of interaction energies on ILs’ viscosity for the rational design of ILs.
