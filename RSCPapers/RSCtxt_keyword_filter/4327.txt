    , Accepted 8th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015AbstractA novel donor–acceptor (D–A) donor di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTTT) was designed and synthesized according to the structure of the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor. The random polymers with different ratios of DTTT/DPP, PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, and the alternating polymer PDTTT-DPP were synthesized through random copolymerization and direct arylation schemes respectively. Although the planarity of the DTTT structure is not as good as the DPP molecule, incorporation of DTTT and DPP molecules stimulates the polymers to achieve a high hole mobility, as determined by polymer thin film transistor (PTFT) devices, as well as yield fine power conversion efficiencies in polymer solar cells. Especially for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, the PTFT devices obtain a high hole mobility of 0.627 cm2 V−1 s−1. The results demonstrate that DTTT-T-DPP based random polymers are promising candidates for various high-performance organic electronic devices. Moreover, the strategy of designing new D/A molecules on the basis of high-performance structures is proved to be effective.
Introduction
The development of new conjugated polymers has brought rapid progress in polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–4 The significant increase in device performance largely originates from the successful development of new semiconducting materials with extended π-conjugation.5,6 Of the wide range of semiconducting polymers developed, donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers which alternate a conjugated electron-rich donor (D) unit with a conjugated electron-deficient acceptor (A) unit in the same polymer backbone have emerged as a promising class of materials.7–9 Therefore, the creation of excellent building blocks for constructing D–A polymers is particularly crucial to reach a high device performance. Among those superior blocks in high performing materials, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is one of the most versatile and widely used structural motifs.10–14
As a polar bicyclic lactam electron-deficient unit, DPP exhibits off-axis dipoles along the polymer backbone, which have been known to promote intermolecular interaction.4 Meanwhile, as a result of interactions between the sulfur atom on the flanked thiophene and the oxygen atom on the lactam ring (S–O), the DPP unit has low conformational disorder leading to highly coplanarity in polymer chains.1 At the same time, for the purpose of constructing an excellent D–A polymer based on the DPP molecule, the appropriate donor units are also extremely important to be exploited. Specially, a donor possessing an analogous structure with a DPP molecule may be promising in view of the outstanding properties of DPP.
To date, the donor part copolymerized electron-deficient DPP unit with thiophene (T) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) has afforded high mobility materials for PTFT devices.13,14 Inspired by this, a novel donor unit 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTTT) based on T and TT, where the TT core is flanked by thiophene at the 3,6-position of TT, has been designed and synthesized to imitate the geometry feature of the DPP molecule. Similar to the DPP molecule, the interactions between the sulfur atoms on T and TT units (S–S) are supposed to favor a high degree of planarity and facilitate charge transport. By a combination of the fused aromatic DTTT and DPP blocks, the new D–A conjugated copolymer is expected to obtain superior charge transporting ability and photovoltaic performance. However, most of DPP-based alternating polymers failed to achieve a high organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance due to their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level over −5.2 eV as well as the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) about 0.6 V. Thus, the frontier orbital energy levels of DPP-based D–A copolymers need to be further adjusted carefully. Comparing with D–A alternating polymerization, D–A random copolymerization is more excellent in controlling the energy levels of the copolymers by tailoring the co-monomer (donor, acceptor, or linking unit) feed ratio.15,16 Nevertheless, according to our previous study, the charge-transport properties and device performance of random copolymers are strongly influenced by the molecular geometry of both donor and accept molecules. The difference in molecular geometry between the donor and the acceptor will be magnified through random polymerization, resulting in poor performance. In this sense, the structure similarity of the DTTT and DPP can avoid the negative effect caused by the molecular geometry difference. In addition, the involvement of a simple conjugated molecule (such as a thiophene) as the linking unit will not affect the primary molecule structures.
Based on the above mentioned aspects, choosing thiophene as the linking unit, random copolymers, poly{3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-thiophene-3,6-di-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione} (PDTTT-T-DPP), were synthesized with two different feed ratios of DTTT/DPP of 3/7 and 4/6, namely PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6. As reported in the literature and our previous study,15 the slightly larger content of the acceptor unit (DPP) than the donor unit (DTTT) was beneficial for device performance, thus two feed ratios of 3/7 and 4/6 were selected. Moreover, the corresponding alternating polymer poly{3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-alt-3,6-di-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione} (PDTTT-DPP) was also prepared by the direct arylation scheme starting from 2,5-dioctyl-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTTT) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (dibromo-DPP) as monomers.17 The comparison between the PDTTT-T-DPP with a random arrangement and alternating polymer PDTTT-DPP on charge transport properties and the photovoltaic performance has been given special attention.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the monomer and copolymers
The detailed synthetic routes and chemical structures of the monomers and copolymers are described in Scheme 1 and the ESI.† A simple 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene molecule was employed as the bridge to construct D–A random copolymers with brominated DTTT and DPP through Stille coupling polymerization, using a tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3) catalyst and a tri-o-tolylphosphine ligand (P(o-tolyl)3). In addition, the alternating polymer PDTTT-DPP was prepared by direct arylation using palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2), potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMAc). To ensure sufficient solubility and self-organization, linear chain octyl and branched 2-octyldodecyl side chains were substituted on the DTTT and DPP units, respectively. These resulting copolymers are highly soluble (∼20 mg mL−1) in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and chloronaphthalene. The structures of monomers and the polymers have been confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S1–S11†). Molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the data are listed in Table S1.† As can be seen from it, the D–A random copolymers, PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, are likely to have a higher molecular weight. Their number average molecular weight (Mn) is 17.6 and 14.7 kg mol−1 respectively, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.13 and 2.32, whereas the Mn of the D–A alternating copolymer PDTTT-DPP is only 10.8 kg mol−1 with a smaller PDI of 1.65. Moreover, by comparing the respective integration of the H atom on the side chains (S–C–C–H and N–C–H) of DTTT and DPP, the actual compositions of the random polymers were calculated and the date is also shown in Table S1,† which were consistent with feed ratios of the co-monomers. The thermal parameters are also presented in Fig. S12, S13 and Table S1.† All the three polymers displayed a similar high decomposition temperature (5% weight loss, Td), close to 400 °C, regardless of the polymerization pattern or the molecular weight.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1(a) shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute chloroform solution and in a solid film. The polymers PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 exhibit similar absorption spectra, while PDTTT-DPP shows a much different absorption spectrum. As listed in Table 1, the absorption maxima of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 and PDTTT-DPP are located at 710 nm, 752 nm, and 650 nm respectively in solution. From the solution state to solid film, the absorption peaks of all these three polymers are red-shifted. Obviously, the random polymers show the red-shifted peaks compared to the alternating counterpart, suggesting that PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 have a more efficient conjugation with the backbone due to the insertion of extra thiophene, meaning that a higher performance may be obtained in the devices. In detail, the three polymers show near absorption edges in the long wavelength direction and the optical band gaps (Eoptg) are 1.36 eV for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, 1.37 eV for PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, and 1.32 eV for PDTTT-DPP.

The HOMO and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) level values of these polymers were estimated from electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Fig. S14† shows the CV plots and the related data are presented in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO levels were calculated to −5.21/−3.63 eV for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, −5.25/−3.60 eV for PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, and −5.17/−3.71 eV for PDTTT-DPP from onset oxidation potentials (Eonsetox)/reduction potentials (Eonsetred). In order to make a distinct comparison, the energy level diagrams of polymers and PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester) are described in Fig. 1(b). The random polymers PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 show lower HOMO levels and higher LUMO levels than PDTTT-DPP. The decreased HOMO energy level is expected to be beneficial for increasing the stability of the polymer against oxidation as well as for enhancing the hole injection from the gold source electrode into the p-type thin film. Furthermore, the lower HOMO levels and higher LUMO levels of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 will offer a relatively higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and more efficient charge transfer from electron donors (polymers) to electron acceptors (PCBM).
Theoretical calculation and crystallinity
Density functional theory (DFT) computation is performed to give a preliminary insight into the electronic structures of DTTT (D) and DPP (A) by using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(**) level with the Gaussian 09 package. For more convenient simulation, the alkyl groups are replaced by methyl groups, where the electronic properties and equilibrium geometries will not be influenced significantly.18,19 Each molecule is optimized under several conformations and is determined at its lowest energy. As shown in Fig. 2, the dihedral angle between the TT unit and flanked thiophene in the single DTTT is 37.2° and −41.4°, while the values for single DPP are −5.1° and −5.2°. Regrettably, the planarity of the DTTT structure is not as good as the DPP molecule, which is beyond our original speculation. The molecular simulation is also executed on these polymers with the different arrangements of DTTT–DPP (D–A), DTTT–T-DPP (D–π-A), DTTT–T-DTTT (D–π-D), and DPP–T-DPP (A–π-A) (Fig. 3). When linking the DTTT with DPP, a minor dihedral angle is present between the units D and A, meanwhile, the high co-planarity of DPP is maintained during the incorporation of the two segments. On further adding thiophene (T) to the arrangement of D–A, there is no apparent influence on the geometry of the molecular backbone. In other words, the construction of a random polymer does not distort the plane of the backbone in the system. Additionally, the special cases of D–π-D and A–π-A exhibit different results. For D–π-D, the dihedral angle between every two neighboring units emerges at a relatively high level. However, A–π-A has a decrescendo dihedral angle like D–A or D–π-A. The results proved that the DTTT/DPP ratios of 3/7 and 4/6 in the study were useful to keep the chain's planarity, as A–π-A is the dominant arrangement in polymers PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were used to reveal the molecular arrangement of the three polymers in pristine thin films. As shown in Fig. 4, the random polymers PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 showed a diffraction peak at 2θ of around 4.5° characteristic of lamellar d-spacing (100 peak) which translates into an inter-lamellar distance of approximately 19.6 Å. However, a slightly lower angle of 4° with a larger d-spacing of 21.9 Å was found for PDTTT-DPP with respect to PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6. More importantly, the intense and sharp peak (100) for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 implied a more ordered interlayer packing structure than PDTTT-DPP. There is also a smaller crystalline peak at 2θ = ∼9° in PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, related to the (200) peak. This peak is indicative of the increased crystallinity for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, which is in agreement with the greater intensity of their (100) peaks. It is noticed that a π–π stacking (010) peak at 2θ of around 23° (3.85 Å) existed in PDTTT-DPP, which is favorable for vertical charge transport. However, no clear (010) peak can be observed in the diffraction patterns of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 films.

Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement
Hole-only devices were specifically fabricated to estimate the charge mobility of pure polymers and polymer/PCBM blend films by the SCLC model with a device configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers (or polymer:PCBM)/MoO3/Ag. The fabrication procedure is described in the Experimental section and Fig. S15† exhibits the hole-only dark I–V curves. In pristine films, the calculated hole mobility values of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, and PDTTT-DPP are 2.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 7.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. That PDTTT-DPP exhibits the lowest mobility is surprising since the XRD measurement shows a better π–π stacking between polymer PDTTT-DPP chains. On the other hand, although there is no evident difference in the optical, electrochemical and crystalline properties of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 achieves a higher mobility compared to PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, which probably results from PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 containing more content of the preferably planar DPP unit. As listed in Table S2,† after blending with PCBM, the hole mobility of these polymers is down-shifted. The blend film of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7:PCBM has the highest mobility as expected. Since the collected current is dependent on the charge transporting properties of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer, a higher hole mobility may translate into a larger Jsc for the PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 based device. Moreover, PDTTT-DPP and the PCBM blend film reveal the lowest mobility, suggesting that the morphology of the PDTTT-DPP film and the PDTTT-DPP/PCBM blend film is unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mobility of the polymer and the PC71BM blend showed values similar to those obtained for polymers and the PC61BM blend, despite the better charge transport properties of PC71BM relative to PC61BM.
Polymer thin film transistor (PTFT) measurement
Bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) PTFTs were fabricated to investigate the charge transport properties of random and alternating polymers, represented by PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-DPP respectively. The channel width (W) was 1400 μm and different channel lengths (L) of TFT devices (from 5 to 50 μm) were investigated to optimize device performance. Table 2 lists the extracted electrical parameters of the PTFT device. Fig. 5 presents the typical output and transfer curves of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7-based TFT devices, and the corresponding curves for PDTTT-DPP are shown in Fig. S16.† All devices with L = 50 μm (W/L = 28) exhibit the optimal hole mobility, as shown in Table S3.† At room temperature, PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 shows a high hole mobility of 0.460 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a threshold voltage (Vth) of −3.2 V and a notable on/off ratio ((Ion/Ioff) of 4.6 × 106. In contrast, a hole mobility of 7.55 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Ion/Ioff = 2.3 × 105, Vth = −19.4 V) was obtained for the PDTTT-DPP-based PTFT device. The higher hole mobility of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 should be related to the better backbone co-planarity and strong layer interaction observed from UV, theoretical calculations and XRD measurements. Moreover, molecular weight played a key role in improving charge mobilities, because thin film crystallinity could be enhanced with increasing molecular weight.20 The relatively low molecular weight of PDTTT-DPP compared with PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 also should account for the lower hole mobility. Furthermore, on account of this thermal annealing was beneficial for improving the charge mobility as reported in many literature studies,21–23 and the field-effect hole mobility was also investigated after thermal annealing at various temperatures for 1 h in vacuum. With a rise in annealing temperature from 100 to 200 °C, the hole mobility of the PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7-based device tended to increase, and afforded the highest hole mobility of 0.627 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at 200 °C, with an on/off ratio of 2.9 × 106. In general, when TFT devices are annealed, the residual oxygen and moisture (H2O) trapped at the interfaces are released. This leads to a shift in the Vth to a smaller value and then facilitates the hole transport.24 Similarly, a device using PDTTT-DPP shows the same variation. After annealing, PDTTT-DPP-based devices give a high hole mobility of 2.11 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 100 °C and of 3.51 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 200 °C.

Photovoltaic characteristics
Single-junction solar cells were fabricated using the inverted device structure ITO/ZnO/polymers:PCBM (PC61BM or PC71BM)/MoO3/Ag. Solutions were prepared using different solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and their mixed solvent. The parameters of devices with the best efficiency are listed in Table 3 and all results are summarized in Table S4.† For the polymer solar cell (PSCs) devices processed from pristine CB solution (Fig. S17†), the PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7-based devices exhibit an inferior PCE compared to PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, due to the lower short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Because there are delicate differences in photoelectric properties between PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, we speculated that the origin behind the poor performance of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 could be correlated with the unfavorable blend film morphology spin-coating from CB solution. As the acceptor varied from PC71BM to PC61BM, the enhancement of Jsc which multiplied from ∼3 mA cm−2 to ∼6 mA cm−2, may stem from the lower LUMO level of PC61BM than that of PC71BM, as a larger energy difference between the LUMO levels of the donor polymer and PC61BM will facilitate efficient exciton splitting and charge dissociation. In addition, the poor PCE appearing in the PDTTT-DPP-based devices is probably due to the worse and discontinuous active layer film seen even in a macroscopical view, originating from its poor film-forming properties with PCBM.

Generally, CN as the additive will improve the morphology of mixtures of low band gap polymers with PCBM, and according to a recent report, CN can even be used as a single solvent to enhance the device performance.25 Thus, the PSCs processed from pristine CN solution were prepared. Using CN as the solvent, solar cells made from PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7:PC61BM achieve an obviously increased PCE of 2.7% with a Jsc of 7.638 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.587 V, and a FF of 59.6%, which is 80% enhancement over the CB solvent device (Fig. 6). However, the CN solvent device based on PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 only obtains a slightly improved PCE. Thus it can be seen that, when the film morphology gets optimized, the advantageous hole mobility of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 helps its device to achieve a better PCE. In order to further increase the PCE using the positive function of the CN solvent, devices with the active layer prepared from CB with different concentrations of CN as the additive were fabricated, and the related data are presented in Table S4.† Although the PCEs from the PSCs based on these polymers processed from CB solutions with increasing concentrations of CN are higher than those from pristine CB solution, a higher PCE than 2.7% was not obtained. On the other side, although the energy levels have been tuned via random copolymerization in this work, the relatively high HOMO levels (∼5.20 eV) and low LUMO levels (∼3.65 eV) of these polymers are still not appropriate enough, which should be a reason for the imperfect PCE in PSC devices.

Morphology study
The surface morphology properties of the polymer:PCBM blend films were tested by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to understand the significant effects of CB and CN solvents, and the size of AFM was 5 × 5 μm2. Fig. 7 and S18† show the typical height images and phase images of polymer (PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 and PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6):PCBM (PC61BM and PC71BM) blend films respectively, and the 3D images are presented in Fig. S19.† Notably, all the PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7-based films processed from the CB solvent exhibited large grains and a smaller grain-boundary density with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness in excess of 7 nm, which implied a reduced heterojunction interface area for exciton dissociation and consequently led to a low Jsc of their OPVs. For PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6, their films also show some aggregation, but due to their smaller RMS values (about 5 nm) and more continuous phase-separation as observed from 3D images compared with the PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 film, the OPVs based on PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 from the CB solvent yield a better performance. When prepared from the CN solvent, the blend films formed fine granular domains with a RMS roughness of about 3 nm. Obviously, the large heterojunction interfaces and sufficient percolation paths can be realized to facilitate charge transport as well as device efficiency. Moreover, the film of PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7:PC61BM consisted of intertwined grains, which is of great benefit to decrease photocurrent recombination and accelerate charge transport. Consequently PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7:PC61BM achieved the best PCE with the highest Jsc.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a novel D–A donor di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTTT) according to the structure of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). Using DPP as the acceptor and thiophene as the linking unit, the random polymers PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7, PDTTT-T-DPP_4/6 and the alternating polymer PDTTT-DPP were synthesized through random copolymerization and direct arylation schemes respectively. Although the planarity of the DTTT structure is not as good as the DPP molecule, incorporating DTTT and DPP molecules prompts the polymers to achieve a high hole mobility, especially for PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7. Polymer thin film transistor (PTFT) devices based on PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7 possess a high hole mobility of 0.627 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the corresponding space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement also shows a high hole mobility of 2.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Besides, PDTTT-T-DPP_3/7:PC61BM shows a PCE of 2.7%. Thus, the design of the new donor unit DTTT and its random copolymers with the DPP molecule is reasonable, demonstrating that the negative effect of molecular geometry on the random copolymer can be weakened by selecting a suitable structure of the donor and the acceptor. Therefore, via random copolymerization, more D/A blocks can be designed and synthesized, by imitating these excellent structures, to further boost the performance of organic electronic devices efficiently.
