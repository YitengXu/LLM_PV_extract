    , Accepted 9th April 2022First published on 21st April 2022AbstractThe integration of thin 2D perovskite layers at the 3D PVK/HTL interface is known to improve the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report a novel approach consisting of mixing two alkyl-based cations that form 2D perovskites (propylammonium iodide (PAI) and octyl ammonium iodide (OAI)) to form mixed cation 2D halide perovskite layers. The solar cells containing the mixed cations demonstrate enhanced device stability retaining 95% of performance after 1000 h under maximum power point tracking, far exceeding PSC samples with single OAI, 88% and PAI, 80% 2D layers. By cation mixing, the formation of a novel 2D perovskite crystal structure was confirmed by XRD and PL analysis and it was shown to have a uniform quasi-2D state (n = 2), a feature not found in single OAI and PAI samples. Notably, the novel morphology of the crystal structure leads to improved carrier dynamics and enhanced PSC stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone rapid development since their inception in 2009 (ref. 1) to show today's record power conversion efficiency of 25.5%.2 Light-absorbing, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials, consisting of three-dimensional ABX3 unit cell crystals,3 have many favorable properties for the development of PSCs such as facile and versatile fabrication,4–6 optoelectronic tuning through composition engineering,7–10 high defect tolerance,11,12 long electron–hole diffusion lengths,13,14 and enhanced absorption coefficients.15 These unique semiconductor characteristics have enabled PSCs to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) that continues to approach the Shockley–Queisser limit. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of 3D perovskite materials to degradation limits PSC long-term stability, and thus, prevents the commercialization of PSC technologies.16,17
A common approach to enhance PSC stability is to modify the interfaces, specifically the interface between the perovskite film (3D PVK) and hole-transporting layer (HTL), an approach that aims to minimize interfacial recombination by defect passivation.18–21 To this end, interfacial 2D perovskite films are ideal candidates due to their electron-blocking, wide bandgap and facile formation on 3D perovskite surfaces containing excess PbI2.22–25 Examples of this approach include using precursors such as phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide,26,27n-butylammonium iodide,28N-(3-aminopropyl)-2-pyrrolidinone,29 and 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI).30,31 Such 2D materials could be characterized by their respective lattice structure, which follows Ruddlesden Popper materials with the R2An−1BnX3n+1 formula where R represents an organic (alkyl chain or aromatic ring) component, B is a divalent metal cation, X is a halide anion, and n is the number of repeating inorganic units bound by the A+ cation.32–34 2D perovskite materials are known to be relatively stable as demonstrated by their exceptional exciton binding energy33,35 remarkable photoluminescence yield,36 bandgap tunable properties,37,38 band-alignment, and defect passivation capability, making them ideal interfacial layers. However, further strategies are necessary to exploit the enhancements in stability provided by 2D perovskites.
The integration of mixed 2D cations into perovskite films provides the possibility of improving the optoelectronic and crystalline properties of the 2D perovskite film. In 3D perovskite systems, combining two or more cations with different size cations (e.g. methylammonium, formamidinium and cesium)7,39,40 yielded significant device improvement due to the optimization of the Goldschemit tolerance factor.40,41 Many studies reported improved PSC stability due to highly uniform 3D perovskite grains with minimal phase impurities. In a similar fashion, a cation mixing strategy for 2D perovskite systems has the potential to enhance PSCs. In this work, we apply the cation mixing approach to 2D perovskites, by mixing two alkylammonium based cations with different alkyl chain lengths (octyl ammonium and propylammonium). We confirm the formation of novel 2D perovskite crystals with a uniform quasi-2D state (n = 2). Moreover, the novel 2D perovskite exhibits unique surface morphology, improved carrier dynamics and extended stability when applied at the interface of the 3D PVK/HTL in devices. The mixed ligand approach has been reported previously in the development of 2D perovskite LEDs,42,43 however, there is no investigation for the passivation layer in perovskite solar cells as we present in this work.
Results and discussion
We introduce mixed cation 2D perovskite films at the interface of the 3D PVK/HTL layer by depositing a mixed solution of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) and n-octyl ammonium iodide (OAI) to form a 2D layer (denoted as OAI + PAI), as illustrated conceptually in Fig. 1a. Reference samples were based on single cation 2D perovskite samples deposited on 3D perovskites (denoted as OAI and PAI). The molecular ratio of the two ligands used in the mixture was OAI:PAI = 1:1. For preparing the multi-ligand solution, OAI (25 mM) and PAI (25 mM) were dissolved in IPA. The single ligand solution of OAI was prepared by dissolving 50 mM OAI in IPA. The single-ligand solution of PAI was prepared by dissolving 50 mM PAI in IPA. An initial analysis was conducted with X-ray diffraction (XRD) on the 3D perovskite/2D perovskite FTO films with OAI, PAI and OAI + PAI, as shown in Fig. 1b and S1† for short and full spectra, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, each individual 2D cation produces different low angle XRD peaks that are synonymous with different 2D crystal structures. The peaks of OAI correspond to n = 1 and n = 2 quasi-2D states, whereas the peaks of PAI correspond to n = 2 and n = 3 quasi 2D states, which is consistent with previous reports.44–46 Notably, the cation mixed 2D perovskite, i.e. OAI + PAI, showed a novel XRD peak pattern not observed in the individual cation samples. Since the OAI and PAI have different alkyl chain lengths of 8 and 3, respectively, a different 2D lattice parameter spacing for OAI + PAI may be expected, which could explain the difference in XRD peak positions. In Fig. 1c, the different 2D lattice configurations that could be obtained with the different cation configurations are illustrated. Further crystallographic analysis of the cation mixed 2D perovskite was performed to model lattice parameters using the LeBail method (Fig. S2 and Table S1†).

Interestingly, the lattice parameter of the a axis for OAI + PAI is 43.6 Å, a value between OAI (44.9 Å)48 and PAI (33.7 Å)47 as demonstrated in Table S1,† indicating that the 2D cation mixing approach could be used to tune the lattice distance by combining cations with different alkyl-chain lengths. The mixed 2D cation forms a homogeneous quasi-2D layer at n = 2, as determined from the measured and fitted XRD spectra (Fig. S2†). Moreover, the formation of a 2D perovskite was confirmed by conducting X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for all samples in addition to a control (3D only sample) as shown in Fig. S3.† In the N 1s range, all samples demonstrate a C–N peak (400.8 eV), however, all but the control sample showed a CN peak (402.2 eV) which is characteristic in 2D perovskite spectroscopy.50,51
To confirm the presence of quasi-2D states from XRD, photoluminescence (PL) emission analysis was conducted, as shown in Fig. 2a–d for OAI, PAI, PAI + OAI and control respectively. Each sample was structured as glass/3D perovskite/2D perovskite and the PL scan was conducted from the direction of the 2D perovskite (Fig. S4† shows the PL emission analysis from the direction of the glass substrate). All samples showed multiple emission peaks, one at approximately 800 nm, which is associated with the 3D perovskite peak in addition to other peaks at high energy, a result which implies the existence of multidimensional (2D and 3D) perovskite layers in all samples. For the OAI sample (Fig. 2a), there are two peaks at 520 nm and 580 nm corresponding to the quasi-2D perovskite states n = 1 and n = 2.44 The PAI sample (Fig. 2b) contains peaks at 580 nm (n = 2) and 630 nm (n = 3), which is consistent with previous studies.44,45 Interestingly, the PAI + OAI spectra show only one 2D peak at 580 nm (n = 2), consistent with the XRD pattern. The reason why OAI + PAI can facilitate uniform n = 2 formation could be due to modified nucleation. It was reported that the mixed cation in 3D perovskites changes the nucleation of the perovskite layer dramatically e.g. Cs can modify the phase transition as 2H (delta phase)–4H–6H–3R(3C).49 The nucleation phenomenon could explain the crystal phase modification through cation mixing in 2D perovskites.

Additional PL emission mapping analysis was conducted as shown in Fig. 3a–d for OAI, PAI, OAI + PAI and control respectively. The maps reveal a similar trend to the PL emission spectra, where OAI + PAI produces the highest intensity spectrum, followed by OAI and then PAI. Surface scanning electron microscopy images were captured to explore the passivation phenomenon. Fig. 3e–h for OAI, PAI, OAI + PAI and control respectively. The PAI morphology has plenty of pinholes, whereas the OAI morphology possesses fewer pinholes. In comparison with PAI and OAI, the OAI + PAI sample shows a striped pattern on the entire surface without pinholes through 2D cation mixing, which may rationalize the higher PL emission. We confirm further that the thickness of the 2D layers for all conditions is essentially the same (20 nm) as determined by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S5†). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was conducted as shown in Fig. 3i, and it was found that OAI + PAI has the highest carrier dynamics lifetime followed by OAI and PAI (Table S2†), which compliments the PL emission spectra and could be an indication of defect suppression at the 3D perovskite surface.50,51 Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry were performed (Fig. S6 and S7†) to construct an energy band diagram for OAI, PAI and OAI + PAI (Fig. S8†). Accordingly, the Fermi-level for OAI + PAI was shifted to a higher energy compared to OAI and PAI. This result indicates that the 2D mixed cation can tune the Fermi level of the perovskite surface, which may affect the carrier dynamics in PSC devices.

The performance of fully fabricated devices was evaluated and the JV characteristics and long-term stability are shown in Fig. 3j and k respectively. The stability test was performed by maximum-power point tracking (MPPT) under the conditions of AM1.5G with inert N2 and 0% RH at 25 °C. The devices with OAI + PAI achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.17% compared to 20.41 and 20.03% for the OAI and PAI devices, respectively (Fig. 3j). To verify the performance, we investigated device performance based on the ligand ratio (PAI:OAI) and found that 0.5:0.5 M yields the best performance as can be seen in Fig. S9.† Importantly, the OAI + PAI device retained the highest PCE of 95% over 1000 h compared to 88% and 80% for OAI and PAI devices, respectively as seen in Fig. 3k. Notably the normalized PCE dropped at the initial time from 0 to 25 h. The reason for the transient performance drop could be cation migration, which would cause degradation of the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD.52 Further stability tests were performed for each 2D perovskite condition to confirm the trends observed, as shown in Fig. S10.† The enhanced photovoltaic parameters are presumably a result from the unified 2D-quasi states achieved by cation mixing as well as defect passivation indicated by PL emission and decay analysis. We further demonstrate the hysteresis behaviors and incident power conversion efficiency (IPCE) respectively in Fig. S11 and S12.† Moreover, for reference, we include IV characteristic behavior (Fig. S13a†) and MPPT (Fig. S13b†) of a PSC device without 2D perovskite films at the 3D PVK/HTL interface.
Conclusions
We investigated the effect of mixing two alkylammonium based cations to form interfacial 2D perovskite films at the 3D PVK/HTL interface. 2D cation mixing produces a 2D perovskite crystal structure, with a pinhole-free surface morphology and an enhanced set of carrier dynamic parameters, which positively impacts the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Notably, the crystal structure of mixed-2D perovskite samples possesses unique lattice length parameters and maintains a homogeneous quasi-2D state (n = 2). Furthermore, the mixed-2D cations significantly improve device stability under 1 sun irradiation retaining 95% efficiency over 1000 h. This facile approach based on 2D perovskite cation mixing is expected to open the way to engineering highly stable PSCs in the future.

Methylammonium bromide and formamidinium iodide were purchased from GreatCell Solar Ltd. Lead iodide was obtained from TCI Co. Ltd. Cesium iodide was obtained from abcr GmbH. The FTO glass substrate (Asahi UV glass) was purchased from Asahi Glass Co. Ltd. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. n-Propylammonium iodide, n-octyl ammonium iodide and titanium oxide nanoparticle paste (PST30NRD) were supplied by GreatCell Solar. Diether and tin(IV) chloride were purchased from Acros Organics. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt and the cobalt-complex (FK209) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Sample preparation
Samples for characterization were prepared starting with an FTO substrate. The samples were sonicated in diluted detergent (1:4), water and isopropanol for 20, 10 and 5 min, respectively. Next, the samples were UV ozone treated for 15 min. A perovskite precursor composed of three cations (FAPbI3)0.85(CsPbI3)0.05(MAPbI2Cl)0.10 with excess PbI2 was prepared by dissolving 1.436 M of lead iodide, 1.26 M of formamidinium iodide, 0.07 M of cesium iodide and 0.07 mg of methylammonium chloride in a 4:1 volumetric solution of DMSO:DMF. Spin-coating was performed through a two-step program running at 1000 and 3000 rpm for 12 and 30 s, respectively. 20 s into the second step a diethyl ether anti-solvent was dispensed. The samples were transferred to a 100 °C annealing plate after spin-coating and left for 1 h to allow optimal crystallization. The ligand solutions that contain OAI and/or PAI dissolved in IPA were spin-coated directly into the 3D perovskite films at 3000 rpm for 15 s using three different isopropanol solutions (0.05 M n-octyl ammonium iodide for OAI, 0.05 M propylammonium iodide for PAI and 0.05 M propylammonium iodide and n-octylammonium iodide mixture for OAI + PAI). Samples for UV-vis measurement were prepared as 2D perovskite/glass. The stoichiometry of the precursors was prepared following the recipe. For preparing the multi-ligand (OAI + PAI) solution, OAI (0.5 M), PAI (0.5 M), and PbI2 (1 M) were dissolved in the solvent (DMSO:DMF = 2:8 in vol%). To prepare the single-ligand solution, OAI (1 M) (or PAI (1 M)) and PbI2 (1 M) were dissolved in the solvent (DMSO:DMF = 2:8 in vol%), respectively. Prepared solutions were spin coated on glass and annealed with the same procedure of the 3D perovskite.
Device fabrication
Perovskite solar cell devices were fabricated to obtain performance parameters (JV and stability measurements). Between each step, the samples were UV ozone treated for 15 minutes. The fabrication was started by sonicating laser scribed FTO glass in diluted detergent (1:4), water, isopropanol, and acetone baths for 20, 10, 5 and 5 min, respectively. The compact TiO2 layer was fabricated on top of the FTO by a spray pyrolysis procedure using a precursor solution (1.2 mL titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 20 mL of ethanol) at 450 °C annealing temperature.53 The mesoporous TiO2 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.381 g of TiO2 paste in a 5 mL ethanol solution. Thereafter, the precursor was spin-coated at 2600 rpm and thermally processed through an annealing recipe (150, 250, 350, 450 and 500 °C for 5, 5, 5, 10 and 20 min respectively). The SnO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating the precursor (12 μL of SnCl4 in 988 μL of H2O) at 3000 rpm and annealed at 190 °C for 1 h.54 The HTL was deposited on the perovskite layer by spin-coating (3000 rpm for 30 s); the HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 60 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 768 μL chlorobenzene, 24 μL 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 14 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium in acetonitrile solution (517 mg mL−1) and 11 μL of tris(2(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butyl pyridine)cobalt(III) tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] in acetonitrile solution (376 mg mL−1). Finally, a 70 nm gold contact layer was deposited by a thermal evaporation method.
Characterization and measurements
The I–V measurements were carried out using an Oriel VeraSol solar simulator (Newport Corporation) and an LCE-50 (Centronics) calibrator, carried out from 1.2 to 0 V and from 0 to 1.2 V as reverse and forward scans, respectively, using a mask of 0.0804 mm2. The scanning step and speed were 10 mV and 50 mV s−1, respectively. UV/vis spectroscopy was performed using a Lambda 950S (PerkinElmer, Inc.). PL emission spectra were obtained with a Fluorolog TCSPC (HORIBA, Ltd) at an excitation wavelength of 475 nm. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy was conducted using a Fluorolog TCSPC with an excitation wavelength of 640 nm (HORIBA, Ltd). PL mapping was performed using an inVia confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw plc.). SEM images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI, Teneo SEM). XPS and UPS measurements were performed on a VersaProbe II (Physical Electronics Inc.) with a monochromator and Al Kα 1486.6 eV source. The spectrum was referenced using the C–C bound component of the adventitious carbon. The maximum power tracking and the stability test were carried out by keeping the samples under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination in a 100% nitrogen atmosphere and 0% humidity at 25 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker Corporation) with Cu Kα radiation (λKα = 1.5418 Å).
