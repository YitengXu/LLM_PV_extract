    , Accepted 7th May 2020First published on 7th May 2020AbstractOrganometal halide perovskites (OMHPs) have shown promising applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. However, besides the toxic lead, the intensive usage of organic solvents during their fabrication could induce severe environmental pollution. Therefore, green-solvent fabrication of OMHPs is highly desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, we report aqueous phase fabrication and conversion of laurionite-type Pb(OH)Br into CH3NH3PbBr3. The prepared CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals show prominently enhanced environmental and thermal stability compared to those prepared in organic phases. To demonstrate the application of the prepared CH3NH3PbBr3, a resistive switching memory device (ReRAM) is fabricated. The ReRAM devices exhibit good bipolar non-volatile characteristics that can remain unchanged for more than 30 days under ambient conditions. We believe that the aqueous phase-based green fabrication process of OMHPs will not only greatly alleviate the environmental pollution during or after their commercialization process, but will also provide a new concept in stabilizing and improving the performance of OMHP-based devices.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (OMHPs) have exciting potential applications in photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, superconductors, and lasers.1–4 The reason behind these applications is their high absorption coefficient, fast carrier mobility, long diffusion length, small exciton binding energy, and tunable bandgaps.5,6 However, there are also many drawbacks associated with OMHPs; for instance, they are extremely unstable against moisture, thermal stress, and UV light.7 Therefore, the fabrication process of the OMHPs is usually performed in organic solvents under an inert atmosphere. Consumption of a large amount of organic solvents and inert gases not only increases the fabrication cost, but also induces serious environmental problems. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an aqueous phase fabrication method to prepare OMHPs under ambient conditions.
Lead halides and lead acetate (PbC4H6O4) have been extensively used to prepare OMHPs.8–10 It has been reported that introduction of a small amount of water into the solvent could simultaneously improve the stability and the device performance of OMHPs.11,12 For instance, solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (20%) and enhanced stability were fabricated when 25% of water was introduced into the organic solvent.13
A significant inconsistency in the forward and reverse voltage scan (known as hysteresis losses) has been observed in the OMHP-based optoelectronic devices.14 Although such losses are undesirable in photovoltaic devices, they could be utilized in other optoelectronic devices. For instance, it can be exploited in resistive switching memory (ReRAM) devices.15–17 ReRAMs are non-volatile storage devices with a metal–insulator-metal sandwich configuration, which are operated by altering the resistance when different sweeping voltages are applied. Such devices are advantageous over the conventional silicon-based memory devices with theoretical and physical limits for downscaling to upsurge the storage capacity.18 Unfortunately, using OMHPs to construct the ReRAM devices is quite challenging because of their intrinsic instability.19
Here, we report on the aqueous phase fabrication and conversion of laurionite-type Pb(OH)Br into CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) perovskite. Notably, this is the first demonstration of employing Pb(OH)Br as a precursor and pure water as a green solvent to prepare a MAPbBr3 perovskite. Due to their hydrated nature and large grain size, these MAPbBr3 crystals are found to be resistive to moisture and high temperatures.13 Moreover, a ReRAM device is constructed using the prepared aqueous-based MAPbBr3 crystals. The prepared devices show characteristics of a non-volatile bipolar resistive switching memory with unprecedented stability under ambient conditions.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Analytical grade lead acetate (Pb(C2H3O2)2), potassium bromide (KBr), dimethylformamide (DMF) and methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br or MABr) were purchased from McKlin and used as received.
Fabrication of Pb(OH)Br
We utilized one of the previous methods to prepare lead hydroxide bromide (Pb(OH)Br).20 Briefly, 0.180 g of KBr was first dissolved in 4 ml of deionized water to prepare an aqueous solution. The prepared solution was stirred until all the salt was dissolved. 0.134 g of lead acetate was completely dissolved in 2 ml of water. Subsequently, the prepared KBr solution was titrated into the lead acetate aqueous solution under continuous stirring. With the addition of KBr aqueous solution, white precipitates were immediately formed at the bottom of the reactor. When the entire KBr solution was titrated into the aqueous solution of lead acetate, the precipitates were collected after centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min and washed with distilled water. Finally, the collected Pb(OH)Br precipitates were vacuum dried overnight at 90 °C. The prepared powder of Pb(OH)Br was used as a lead precursor for the synthesis of the MAPbBr3 perovskite. The fabrication process of Pb(OH)Br is schematically shown in Fig. 1(i).

Synthesis of the MAPbBr3 perovskite
To synthesize MAPbBr3, 0.0951 g of Pb(OH)Br and 0.105 g of MABr were added into 500 μl of deionized water under constant magnetic stirring for more than 12 h. During the process of stirring, the solution gradually turned orange. The solution emitted greenish light under a ultraviolet (UV) lamp irradiation, indicating the formation of the MAPbBr3 perovskite, as shown in Fig. 1(ii). The larger precipitates were then discarded and the solution was dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain the orange MAPbBr3 crystals.
Device fabrication
To fabricate the electron-only device, we followed our previous method and device configuration.21 To fabricate the ReRAM switching device, the prepared MAPbBr3 crystals (0.29 g) were dissolved completely in DMF (600 μl) under constant magnetic stirring at 70 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the prepared solution was spin-coated onto a pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate at 2500 rpm for 50 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, gold electrodes were deposited onto the spin-coated MAPbBr3 film using a shadow mask in the vacuum chamber.
Characterization methods
X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed using an X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical (Empyrean Alpha-681). Determination of the surface features of the films and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were carried out using scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) (Hitachi S4800 and Hitachi SU3500). Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were performed using an Andor SR-500i-B1 spectrograph FLS-920 and a steady/transient fluorescence spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments. Optical absorption (OA) characterization studies were carried out on a Carry 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer from Agilent Technologies. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were performed using a FTIR spectrometer from Bruker. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB-250 system with a K-alpha radiation source. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis was performed using a SDT-Q600, TA, USA. The water contact angle was measured using a CAM200 goniometer (KSV Co. Ltd.). Dark J–V measurements of the device were carried out using a Keithley 236. The I–V characteristics of the ReRAM device were measured using a Keysight semiconductor device analyser (B1500A).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared Pb(OH)Br. The SEM image of the sample is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a and Fig. S1.† The as-prepared product has an orthorhombic phase, reflected from the XRD peaks at 26.4°, 25.64°, 24.17°, 14.84°, and 17.6° arising from (111), (121), (020), (011), and (002) crystal planes, respectively. All these peaks in the XRD pattern are in accordance with the previous reports and the standard PDF card (#30-0697).22

Fig. 2b shows the optical absorption and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared Pb(OH)Br. A broad absorption peak in the region from 500 nm to 700 nm and a sharp peak at around 350 nm were observed.22 The broad peak could be attributed to the diffraction of the light. The peak at around 350 nm could be attributed to the band-to-band transition. Two prominent emission peaks at around 575 nm and 425 nm were observed in the PL spectrum of Pb(OH)Br. The PL peak at 425 nm might have resulted from the band-to-band transition. The peak at around 575 nm might have resulted from the defects, which needs further studies.
After the conversion process of Pb(OH)Br and MABr into the MAPbBr3 perovskite phase, the crystals were characterized by XRD. Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the cubic phase MAPbBr3 perovskite crystals. Prominent diffraction peaks were observed at 15°, 30°, 45°, and 65°, corresponding to the diffraction planes of (001), (002), (003), and (004) of the cubic phase MAPbBr3, respectively, indicating the successful and complete conversion of the precursors into the MAPbBr3 perovskite.23,24 The sharp XRD peaks underlie the formation of MAPbBr3 perovskites composed of large grains. The as-prepared MAPbBr3 perovskite crystals have cuboid shapes (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2†). The average size of the crystals was estimated to be about 1 μm from the SEM images with a broad size distribution (Fig. S2†). The crystal size of the MAPbBr3 particles is consistent with the sharp XRD peaks.

(d) The PL spectrum of MAPbBr3 crystals with a sharp emission peak at 570 nm. 
A sharp absorption slope was observed from about 550 nm to 570 nm (Fig. 3c), in agreement with a previous study.25 The bandgap was estimated to be about 2.2 eV (inset in Fig. 3c), showing agreement with the value reported previously.26 A sharp PL peak was observed at about 570 nm with a full width at half maximum of only 23 nm (Fig. 3d). The narrow PL emission peak might be due to the near absence of non-radiative recombination sites.27 The PL properties of the converted MAPbBr3 agree with the results reported before.25
To further confirm the conversion of Pb(OH)Br and MABr into MAPbBr3, FTIR analysis was performed (Fig. 4). Most of the FTIR peaks originated from MAPbBr3 perovskites. The peaks at around 912 cm−1 and 965 cm−1 are assigned to the CH3–NH3+ rocking mode and the C–N stretching mode, respectively.28 The peaks at about 1249 cm−1, 1473 cm−1, and 1571 cm−1 are ascribed to the CH3–NH3+ rocking mode, NH3+ symmetric bending mode, and NH3+ asymmetric bending mode, respectively.28,29 The peaks in the wavenumber ranges of 2844–2973 cm−1 and 3000–3300 cm−1 are assigned to the C–H stretching and N–H stretching vibrational modes, respectively.28–31 The peak in the wavenumber range of 3300–3600 cm−1 is attributed to the O–H vibrations.32 When the sample was annealed at 130 °C for 10 min before the FTIR measurements, the peak related to the O–H vibrations was greatly depressed (Fig. 4b), which indicated that the O–H vibrations were from free water molecules.30

(b) The magnified spectra in the wavenumber range of 3400 to 3600 cm−1 to visualize the O–H stretching vibration. In the spectra, Rock., St., and Sym. stand for rocking, stretching, and symmetric, respectively. 
XPS analyses further confirmed the conversion of the precursors into MAPbBr3. The XPS survey spectrum showed the existence of Br, Pb, C, and N elements (Fig. 5a).33 Similarly, the main elements of CH3NH3PbBr3 were also present in the EDX spectrum (Fig. S3†). The XPS peaks of Pb were observed at about 138.8 and 143.6 eV, which are the consequence of the spin–orbit splitting and are attributed to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels, respectively.34 The binding energy of Pb confirmed that pure MAPbBr3 was obtained (Fig. 5b), indicating the complete conversion from Pb(OH)Br to MAPbBr3.35 The peaks of Br at 68.36 and 69.38 eV are associated with Br 3d5/2 and Br 3d3/2 levels, respectively. The energy difference between the split levels of Br is about 1 eV, which is in line with the previous reports of Br in MAPbBr3.36

The time-resolved PL decay profile of the MAPbBr3 perovskite crystals is shown in Fig. 6. The decay profile was collected by using a pump laser of 335 nm wavelength where the detector wavelength was fixed at 570 nm. The decay profile could be well-fitted with a bi-exponential function with an R2 value of 0.998. The values of τ1 and τ2 were estimated to be about 5.3 ns (fast decay) and 17 ns (slow decay), respectively. The fast decay (τ1) could be attributed to the recombination from free charge carriers or the non-radiative recombination defects. The slow decay (τ2) could be assigned to the fundamental recombination lifetime of the carriers or the band-edge emissions.37

Stability measurements of MAPbBr3
Perovskite materials are highly sensitive to moisture and thermal treatments. To test the thermal stability of the prepared MAPbBr3, the MAPbBr3 crystals were deposited onto a piece of a glass substrate and heated at 90 °C for different time periods. Subsequently, XRD analyses of the MAPbBr3 crystals were carried out after they were heated for 30 h and 60 h, respectively (Fig. 7a). After the thermal treatment, new tiny XRD peaks emerged (Fig. 7a). The new peaks located at 35° (denoted by a diamond symbol) and 37° (denoted by a star symbol) were ascribed to the diffraction from the (210) and (112) planes of MAPbBr3, respectively.38 Those tiny peaks situated at around 28°, 32°, and 45° (denoted by circle symbols) were attributed to PbBr2 and MABr.39 The presence of the XRD peaks of PbBr2 and MABr is due to the evaporation of the trapped water molecules within the film during the annealing process. Therefore, PbBr2 and MABr dissolved in water were dried out to contribute to the XRD peaks.

The circle, diamond, and star symbols represent the emergent tiny XRD peaks after the thermal treatment. (b) The absorption spectra of the as-prepared MAPbBr3 and after being exposed to an environment with a humidity of 60 ± 10% for different time periods. (c) TGA-DSC analysis of MAPbBr3 recorded under ambient conditions. The total mass of the sample was 12.87 mg. 
To test the environmental stability of the MAPbBr3 crystals, they were placed under humid conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of 60 ± 10% for different time periods. The absorption spectra were measured after 10, 20, and 40 days. Almost no changes were observed in the absorption spectra of the fresh and aged samples, proving an enhanced resistance of MAPbBr3 to the moisture (Fig. 7b). The PL spectra of the fresh, aged (40 days at RH 60 ± 10%), and thermally treated (90 °C for 60 h) samples are shown in Fig. S4.† The PL intensity of the aged sample was slightly reduced. The PL intensity of the thermally treated sample remained almost unchanged. The PL peak position remained unchanged during the aging and heating treatments. Thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses (TGA-DSC) were further carried out on MAPbBr3 crystals to evaluate their thermal stability (Fig. 7c). A weight loss was observed at temperatures below 150 °C, much higher than temperature at standard operating conditions (i.e. 85 °C). The corresponding endothermic peaks appeared at around 150 °C and 201 °C, which were induced by the evaporation of water trapped at the grain boundaries. The existence of water makes the MAPbBr3 crystals less hygroscopic than the fully anhydrous ones. The total weight loss reached 2.124% at about 201 °C. A prominent weight loss by 14.44% and 30.56% occurred at temperatures of about 305 °C and 355 °C, respectively. The weight loss was attributed to the decomposition of the organic part of MAPbBr3, i.e. MA, according to a previous study.40 The corresponding endothermic peaks emerged at temperatures of 305 °C and 355 °C. The exact nature of these phase transitions is still unknown and requires further studies. The sharpness of the peaks in DSC is indicative of the sublimation of the organic part as reported previously in similar perovskites.41 A 44% of the weight was lost between 400 °C and 625 °C, which could be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the inorganic part.
Notably, the morphology of the crystals remained unchanged during moisture exposure and thermal treatment. The improved environmental and thermal stability of MAPbBr3 could be attributed to the following reasons: (i) it has been reported that water prolonged the crystallization process of the perovskite, leading to the formation of large grains;11,13 (ii) the MAPbBr3 crystals prepared here have large grains. The large grains have a small surface area to volume ratio, which reduces the reaction speed between the perovskite material and the environmental factors (e.g., temperature and moisture). Therefore, the stability is greatly increased; second, we utilized Pb(OH)Br instead of the commonly used lead salts as the lead precursor, which could have also contributed to the increased grain size and in turn the stability of the perovskite.
Device fabrication and measurements
Thin films of the prepared MAPbBr3 crystals were fabricated by the extensively used spin-coating method (Fig. 8a and inset). Excellent coverage of the substrate with vertically oriented MAPbBr3 crystals without any pinholes was achieved. The water contact angle was found to be about 81° on the surface of the thin film (Fig. 8b). The large water contact angle is indicative of the greater hydrophobicity of the thin film.

(b) A water droplet on the MAPbBr3 film. (c) The configuration of the electron-only device. (d) Dark J–V characteristics of the electron-only device. The red, orange, and blue regions are the Ohmic, TFL, and Child regions, respectively. (e) I–V characteristics of the ReRAM device under a sweeping voltage of −2 V to + 2 V. Inset: configuration of the ReRAM device. 
Traps are desirable for enhancing the hysteresis characteristics of resistive memory devices. To evaluate the trap density of the MAPbBr3 thin film, an electron-only device was fabricated, as schematically shown in Fig. 8c. The dark current density–voltage characteristics (JV) were studied for the electron-only device (Fig. 8d). Three different regions, i.e., the Ohmic region (J ∝ V), the trap-filled limited voltage or the TFL region (J ∝ Vn>3), and the Child region (J ∝ V2) could be observed. The trap density was estimated to be about 5 × 1021 cm−3 from the TFL region using the relationship: nt = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where nt is the trap density, ε is the dielectric constant of MAPbBr3 (28.7), ε0 is the permittivity of free space, e is an elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the film (400 nm).21,42 The high density traps within the MAPbBr3 film enable its use in ReRAM devices. The ReRAM device was constructed following a configuration of Au/MAPbBr3/ITO/glass (inset in Fig. 8e). A typical current–voltage (I–V) curve of the device under a sweeping voltage of 0 V → 2 V → 0 V → −2 V → 0 V is shown in Fig. 8e. During the voltage sweep from 0 to 2 V, the resistance switching from a high-resistance state (HRS or SET) to a low-resistance state (LRS or RESET) was observed at about 1.8 V, indicating that the SET process occurred. Afterwards, the LRS remained until the negative sweeping voltage was applied. The resistive state switched back to the HRS at about −0.8 V, indicating that the corresponding RESET process occurred. The SET and RESET switching occurred at the opposite voltage polarities, indicating the bipolar switching nature of the device. Moreover, an ON/OFF ratio of 105 of the device was determined from the I–V curve. To demonstrate the stability of the fabricated ReRAM device, the same I–V characteristics were measured after the device was exposed to ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 60 ± 10% for 15 and 30 days (Fig. S5†). Almost the same I–V characteristics were obtained, indicating the non-volatile properties of the device. A detailed study is required to further explore the other characteristics of the MAPbBr3-based ReRAM devices, including the flexibility, endurability, and the data retention time.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated aqueous phase fabrication and conversion of Pb(OH)Br into MAPbBr3 crystals. This is the first demonstration of fabricating the MAPbBr3 perovskites entirely in water using Pb(OH)Br as a lead source. The prepared MAPbBr3 crystals showed comparable structural and optical properties to the organic phase-prepared MAPbBr3 with several obvious advantages, including enhanced stability in humid air and at high temperatures. A ReRAM device was fabricated using the prepared MAPbBr3 crystals, demonstrating a bipolar non-volatile characteristic that was retained for more than 30 days in humid air. We believe that the introduction of this new lead precursor for the aqueous phase synthesis of MAPbBr3 perovskites will motivate researchers towards the stabilization and further development of the emerging organometal halide perovskites.
