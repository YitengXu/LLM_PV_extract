    , Accepted 1st October 2015First published on 2nd October 2015AbstractIn order to investigate the effects of fluorine atoms on the photovoltaic performance, three 2-D D–A conjugated copolymers, namely PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F), were designed and synthesized using alkylthienyl substituted quinoxaline with different numbers of F substituents as the acceptor unit and thiophene as the donor unit. The physicochemical and photovoltaic properties were comparatively studied in detail. The results demonstrate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are gradually lowered from −5.10 eV to −5.18 eV and then to −5.33 eV for PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F), respectively, while the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels nearly remain constant with the increase of F substituents. Introducing F on the polymer backbone widens the energy bandgap and makes the absorption peaks of the polymers blue-shifted. The highest power conversion efficiencies of bulk heterojuncton polymer solar cells increased with the increase of F substituents from 2.82% for PT-QX (0F) to 4.14% for PT-FQX (1F) to 5.19% for PT-DFQX (2F) thanks to the enhanced Voc and Jsc. The enhanced Voc and Jsc can be mainly ascribed to the lower HOMO energy levels and moderate hole mobility of the fluorinated polymers, as well as the better morphology and preferential orientation of the face-on structure of the blend films of the fluorinated polymer donor with a PC71BM acceptor.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their predominant advantages of light-weight, low-cost, flexibility, and environmental friendliness compared with the conventional inorganic solar cells.1 Recently, research on PSCs has advanced rapidly, which is mainly attributed to the development of photovoltaic materials and innovation of device fabrication technology. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojuncton (BHJ) PSCs have reached over 10%,2 which offers a promising future for their commercialization.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated copolymers as electron-donating materials have become the most successful strategy for achieving high performance PSCs, because intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from an electron-donating unit to an electron-accepting moiety allows for fine-tuning of band gaps, frontier molecular orbital energies, and light absorption strength.3 Extensive research has provided some general guidelines for developing D–A conjugated copolymers.4 Many literature studies have reported that introducing functional fluorine atoms into the polymers is an important and valid approach for improving the photovoltaic and physicochemical properties of D–A conjugated copolymers.5
Commonly, introduction of fluorine atoms into polymer chains is considered as an effective way to lower the energy levels of the polymers because of the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atom.6 As a result, fluorinated polymers exhibit deeper HOMO energy levels, and thus afford a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) in BHJ PSCs. Meanwhile, some of the literature studies have reported that introduction of fluorine atoms enhanced the inter/intramolecular interaction of polymers due to a strongly induced dipole in the C–F bond, which leads to a higher charge carrier mobility and facilitates charge transfer.7 Furthermore, it is also found that strong F⋯H/F⋯S interactions and well-developed fibril structures in fluorine-containing polymers can contribute to an appropriate morphology of the active layer and suppress charge recombination.8
So far, there are lots of literature studies reporting the effects of the F atom on the photovoltaic performance of polymers. However, it is noteworthy that some literature studies drew very different conclusions based on different systems. For example, some researchers found that F atoms can lower both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels,9 but there was also literature reporting that the F atom can only lower the HOMO energy level, and almost scarcely affects the LUMO energy;10 Yong Zhang et al. found that the F atoms cause the loss of hole-mobility of the photovoltaic polymers and result in decreased Jsc and FF of the PSCs.11 In addition, the effect of the F atoms on the absorption spectrum is also found to be different. Akila Iyer et al. observed that fluorination can effectively broaden the absorption spectra,12 but Bob Schroeder et al. reported that fluorination shows a negative effect on absorption.13 Obviously, the effects of the F atoms on the energy level, absorption spectrum and other photovoltaic performances are complicated, and depend on different polymer systems. Thus, it is of prime importance to fully understand the effects of the F atom on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in the design of new polymers for efficient PSCs.
In this contribution, we designed and synthesized three new D–A copolymers, PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F), based on an alkylthiophene substituted quinoxaline acceptor unit and a thiophene donor unit, as shown in Scheme 1. For the convenience of studying the effects of the F atom, the three copolymers were built by a non-fluorinated quinoxaline acceptor unit for PT-QX (0F), a mono-fluorinated quinoxaline acceptor unit for PT-FQX (1F) and a difluorinated quinoxaline acceptor unit for PT-DFQX (2F). The quinoxaline unit was selected as the acceptor building block because it possesses strong electron affinity, and its facile synthesis process and versatility make the quinoxaline unit one of the most popular electron acceptor units copolymerized with various electron-donor (D) units.14 In addition, in order to broaden the absorption and improve the solubility of the copolymers, two alkylthiophene π-conjugated side chains were introduced into the quinoxaline unit.15 BHJ PSCs were fabricated based on the three copolymers as donors to investigate the effects of the F atoms. The highest PCEs achieved for PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F)-based PSCs are 2.82%, 4.14% and 5.19%, respectively, and it is found that Jsc, Voc and FF of the corresponding PSCs enhanced with the increase of the fluorine atom substituents of the donor polymers. The results indicate that introducing F atoms into quin-oxaline is a promising strategy to comprehensively improve the photovoltaic performance of the quinoxaline-based copolymer donor materials.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis routes of the copolymers are depicted in Scheme 2 and the detailed synthetic processes are described in the Experimental section. All the compounds 1–4 and M1–3 were satisfactorily characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis. PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) were prepared by the Stille coupling polymerization reaction between the corresponding monomers catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3. The synthesized polymers were purified by continuous extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform, and the chloroform fractions were recovered. All the polymers are highly soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. Table 1 summarizes the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), the polydispersity index (PDI) (measured by GPC in trichlorobenzene (TCB) at 150 °C with polystyrene standards) and thermal properties of the copolymers. The Mn values of PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) are 13.1, 14.3, and 16.6 kDa, respectively, with PDIs of 1.58, 1.73 and 1.73, respectively (Table 1). These indicate that the introduction of fluorine atoms has no significant influence on the molecular weight of the copolymers.16 The thermal transition and stability of polymers were measured by TGA and DSC. DSC scans (Fig. S1†) of the three polymers revealed that there were no evident phase transitions up to 250 °C. As shown in Fig. S2† and Table 1, TGA thermograms showed that PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) are thermally stable with onset decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss at 394, 381 and 348 °C, respectively. The results indicate that all the polymers are stable enough for application in PSCs and can be potentially annealed at elevated temperatures.

2.2 Optical properties
The normalized optical absorption spectra of these polymers in dilute chloroform and as thin films deposited on quartz glass are shown in Fig. 1. Meanwhile the absorption peak wavelengths (λmax), absorption edge wavelengths (λonset), and the optical band gap (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 1, all these three polymers show similar absorption profiles and have two characteristic absorption bands. The higher energy band in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm arises from the localized π–π transition and intrinsic absorptions of the alkylthiophene substituted quinoxaline unit,17 whereas a relatively broad and weak absorption in the wavelength range of 500–750 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the strong electron-accepting quinoxaline units and the electron-donating thiophene units. Compared with the absorption in solution, the lower energy band absorption strength of the polymer films improved significantly and the absorption peak appeared evidently red-shifted, the shoulder peak around 450 nm also weakened or disappeared, indicating that aggregation of the polymer main chains and π–π intermolecular interactions existed in the solid film state. It should be noted that upon fluorination, PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) exhibited vibronic features at a low-energy absorption band in a thin film. However, this peak is completely absent in PT-QX (0F) suggesting that fluorination of the quinoxaline moiety does not hinder backbone planarization and actually enhances intermolecular interaction. In addition, the introduction of fluorine atoms is advantageous to form an aggregation of the conjugated backbones and π–π stacks that favor the charge transfer.18 We speculate that the non-covalent interactions between fluorine atoms and components on adjacent aromatics are responsible for this phenomenon. It is also worth noting that both in solution and in the solid film state, the related absorption spectrum showed a slight blue-shift as the number of fluorine atoms increased, which was also found by other groups. The electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atoms may lead to a permanent shift of π electrons and weaken the conjugation effect, which results in a blue-shifted UV-Vis absorption.19 The Eoptg of PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) calculated from the λonset of the polymer film are 1.61 eV, 1.68 eV and 1.77 eV respectively; this indicates that introducing F on the polymer backbone broadened the optical bandgap of the polymers.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The measured cyclic voltammograms are illustrated in Fig. 2 and the results are summarized in Table 2. The onset potentials for oxidation (Eox) were 0.39, 0.47 and 0.62 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F), respectively. The related onset potentials for their reduction (Ered) were −1.18, −1.17 and −1.17 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers were calculated according to the equations:20 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV)(1) LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV)(2)
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films on a platinum electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. 
The HOMO, LUMO, and electrochemical bandgaps (Eecg) can be calculated from the values of Eox and Ered of the copolymers. As shown in Fig. S3,† the LUMO energy levels of PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) are −3.53 eV, −3.54 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively. Thus, one can find that the LUMO energy levels were almost not affected by the introduction of fluorine atoms, and all the three LUMO energy levels are ca. 0.4 eV higher than that of the acceptor PC71BM (−3.91eV), ensuring an energetically favorable electron transfer from the polymer donor to the PC71BM acceptor in PSCs. The HOMO energy levels of PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F), are estimated to be −5.10 eV, −5.18 eV and −5.33 eV, respectively. Evidently, the electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine atom lowers the HOMO energy level of the fluorinated polymer compared with that of the non-fluorinated analog, and the effect is more obvious with the increase of the fluorine atom number. As we mentioned before, the low-lying HOMO level is favorable for a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs with the polymers as donor materials because the Voc is usually proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. The HOMO level decreases by approximately 0.1 eV and 0.15 eV as each fluorine atom is introduced, which is consistent with the results reported in previous work and theoretical calculations of Muhammet E. Kose et al. on other fluorinated copolymers.21 It is important to emphasize that the incorporation of fluorine does not significantly alter the LUMO levels of the resulting polymer systems, but it does lower the HOMO level of the resulting polymer which is consistent with the previous literature.22 On account of the larger influence on the HOMO energy level in comparison with the LUMO, the electrochemical bandgap (Eecg) slightly increases upon fluorination. The lower HOMO levels of PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) can be expected to result in better oxidative stability under ambient conditions and yield a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in photovoltaic devices.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of the three polymers were investigated by fabricating BHJ PSCs with the traditional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca or ZrAcac/Al. Various methods and conditions were empirically adopted to optimize the PSC device performance, including the blend ratios of the polymer to PC71BM, processing additives, and the modified layer treatment. The measurements of photovoltaic performances were carried out under an illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The optimal performance of the devices, such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) is summarized in Table 3. Fig. 3 shows the representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best performance.

As shown in Table 3, the PCEs of devices based on the three polymers present a rising trend along with the number of fluorine atoms. The Voc of the PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F), and PT-DFQX (2F) solar cells are about ∼0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 V respectively. There was an increase of almost ∼0.1 V as each fluorine atom was introduced onto the quinoxaline moiety. This phenomenon is consistent with a decrease of 0.08–0.15 eV for the HOMO energy level with every increase of one fluorine atom. Meanwhile the Jsc and fill factor (FF) also improved for PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) compared to PT-QX (0F). The improvement of Jsc and FF is mainly due to the better active layer morphology and appropriate orientation mode on the insertion of fluorine atoms into the quinoxaline moiety (vide infra).
Here, we tried to employ various strategies to further improve the performance of devices. Firstly, we used methanol treatment to modify the interface of active layers,23 and found that all the devices based on the three polymers showed an increased Jsc after methanol treatment (Table S1†); this might originate from the relatively lower surface resistance caused by the methanol treatment, which is beneficial for charge transport. Then, inspired by recent interfacial modification work,24 we investigated the function of employing commercially available zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) as a cathode interlayer between the active layer and the Al electrode. The well matched energy level of the ZrAcac layer and Al is helpful for efficient charge extraction. The results showed that a further increase of Jsc values, and higher FFs were obtained. Finally, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as a processing additive to explore its effect on the performance of the devices. The results indicate that 3% DIO has an obvious positive effect on the Jsc of the devices based on PT-QX (0F) and PT-FQX (1F), but for that of PT-DFQX (2F), the increased Jsc is associated with the decline of Voc and FF. This is mainly because DIO possesses a high boiling point (168 °C) and is able to solvate the fullerenes, leading to a comprehensive impact on Jsc by providing a more optimal morphology for facilitating charge carrier transportation.25 However the loss of Voc can be attributed to the lowering of charge-separated and charge-transfer-state energies upon additive addition.26 Simultaneously, we speculate that the addition of DIO decreases the size of fullerene domains and facilitates the formation of a bicontinuous interpenetrating donor–acceptor network. Overall, devices with 3% DIO additive exhibited better PCEs than those of the devices without any additive. After treatment with the above optimization method, the PCEs of PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F)-based devices are improved from 1.47%, 2.76% and 3.96% to 2.82%, 4.14% and 5.19% respectively, and the corresponding Jsc are increased by 57%, 48% and 42% respectively.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices fabricated under the optimal conditions are shown in Fig. 4. All the devices showed a broad EQE response range covering the visible region, which is attributed to the intrinsic absorption of both the polymers and PC71BM. Among them, the devices based on PT-QX (0F) and PT-FQX (1F) showed a similar response range from 300 nm to 800 nm, but the device of PT-DFQX (2F) exhibited a significant improvement of EQE in the wavelength range 300–650 nm and a relatively narrow absorption. It is important to note that all the EQE spectra showed obvious improvement both in the long wavelength region and in the short wavelength region after DIO addition, which could be ascribed to the change of microstructure of the blend films.
 Fig. 4  EQE spectra of the PSCs based on polymer/PC71BM blends. 
For the convenience of analysis, the absorption spectra of the blend films prepared under the optimal conditions were also measured and are shown in Fig. S4.† It is obvious that all the shapes of the EQE spectra for the three devices are consistent with the absorption spectra of their active layers, and all the Jsc of the relative devices were in good agreement with their EQE spectra shown in Fig. 4 within an experimental error of 4%. It is worth noting that the blend film comprising PT-DFQX (2F) exhibits higher solid state absorption coefficients, especially in the red part of the spectrum, which explains the reason why the device based on PT-DFQX (2F) exhibited a larger Jsc than that of the other two.
In consideration of charge-carrier mobilities of the blend films, hole-only devices in a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au were fabricated and the hole mobilities of the three polymers were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model at low voltages (Fig. S5†). The results are summarized in Table 3. Obviously, all of the hole mobilities of the blend films are increased after the Zracac, DIO treatment, which is in good agreement with the Jsc and FF improvement of the PSCs. However this difference in the mobility among the three polymers is very small, and cannot account for the observed significantly increasing PCEs of the PSCs based on the fluorinated polymers. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the microstructures of the blend films for deeply understanding the effect of the F atom on the photovoltaic performance.
2.5 Microstructure
The nano-scale morphology of the active layer plays an important role in the device performance. Proper morphology is not only beneficial for exciton dissociation but also necessary for charge transport to respective electrodes for efficient charge collection.27 Therefore, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were used to investigate the nano-scale morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM blend films. The phase images were taken for the active layer surfaces based on these three copolymers without and with DIO, and very different morphologies were obtained as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  AFM without DIO (top) and with DIO (bottom) images (5 × 5 μm2) of (a, d) PT-QX (0F)/PC71BM (1:1.4, w/w), (b, e) PT-FQX (1F)/PC71BM (1:1.3, w/w), (c, f) PT-DFQX (2F)/PC71BM (1:1.2, w/w). 
The blend film of PT-QX (0F)/PC71BM (1:1.4, w/w) showed a morphology with an average surface roughness (Ra) of 9.103 nm, indicating the clear phase separation and poor compatibility of the blend film. The film of PT-FQX (1F)/PC71BM(1:1.3, w/w) showed a slightly better film morphology with a roughness of 2.042 nm, which exhibited moderate homogeneity. The blend film based on PT-DFQX (2F)(1:1.2, w/w) showed a morphology with a roughness of 1.77 nm and a nanoscale interconnected network structure, indicating that the blend film based on PT-DFQX (2F) provides an adequate combination of polymer solubility and miscibility with PC71BM. After these active blend films are processed with the additive DIO, all the Ra presents a certain degree of decline. It is suggested that the treatment of DIO can promote the films to form a more flat surface and achieve a better nano-scale morphology.
As shown in Fig. 5, the blend films based on PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) demonstrated a well-developed fibril structure. Obviously, the appropriate surface appearance associated with proper roughness is beneficial for exciton diffusion and charge separation, and may effectively assist charge transport prior to recombination. However, blend films based on PT-QX (0F) showed an inferior morphology with an obvious cluster, which may destroy the continuous percolating pathway for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes, consequently increasing the chance of recombination of charge carriers and reducing the Jsc accounting for a lower PCE. Moreover, a rough surface will also induce high surface resistance, which is destructive to the performance of solar cells.28 The results suggest that the introduction of fluorine atoms is beneficial to the formation of an interpenetrated network surrounded by the PC71BM phase, and the PT-DFQX (2F)/PC71BM blend films showed the best combination of a bicontinuous nanoscale morphology for efficient charge separation and transport in the polymer/PC71BM blend film.
In order to deeply study the microstructures of polymers, the preferential orientation of the polymer films was investigated by GIXS. Fig. 6 shows the in-plane (IP) and the out-of-plane (OP) GIXS profiles of these three films, and all these polymer films were cast from o-DCB (10 mg ml−1). As shown in Fig. 6, a relatively stronger IP (100) reflection could be observed for both the PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) films, while a weak intensity of the (100) reflection occurred in the IP profile of the PT-QX (0F) film. However, the PT-QX (0F) film has a strong OP (100) reflection, which could not be observed in both the PT-FQX (1F) film and the PT-DFQX (2F) film. This indicates that the lamellar packing of PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) preferentially stacked in the film plane (face-on rich orientation), while the PT-QX (0F) film preferentially stacked out of the film plane (edge-on rich orientation), which suggests that fluorination could make the polymer molecular chain re-orientate, because F atoms induce crystalline domains in the solid state possibly as a result of favorable C–F⋯H interactions.29 As is well known, this preferential face-on orientation is more beneficial for vertical charge transport than the edge-on rich orientation mode, which facilitates charge transport and reduces bimolecular recombination;30 this is consistent with the enhanced Jsc value of the PSCs based on PT-DFQX (2F) and the relatively lower Jsc value of the PSCs based on PT-QX (0F). In a word, the face-on orientation mode together with the better morphology of the blend film based on PT-DFQX (2F) mentioned above results in a higher Jsc and PCE.

3. Conclusion
In order to investigate the effects of fluorine substitution on the optical, electrochemical, photovoltaic properties of the polymers, three D–A conjugated copolymers, named PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) based on an alkylthienyl substituted quinoxaline acceptor unit with different numbers of F substituents and a thiophene donor unit were designed and synthesized. The introduction of the fluorine substituents results in a gradual decrease in the HOMO levels and a slight blue-shift of the absorption, but has almost no influence on the LUMO energy levels of the relative polymers. As a result, the Voc of the resulting PSC devices increased by approximately 0.1 V as each of the F was added. In addition, the Jsc was also improved due to the moderate mobility together with the preferential face-on orientation and homogeneous nano-scale morphology caused by the fluorination. The optimal PSC devices based on PT-QX (0F), PT-FQX (1F) and PT-DFQX (2F) showed an increasing PCE of 2.82%, 4.14% and 5.19%, respectively. Therefore, the introduction of F atoms into the photovoltaic polymers can be considered as an effective strategy to tune the energy levels, the active layer morphology and the photovoltaic properties. A deeper research on the complicated effects of F atoms on D–A copolymers is worth looking forward to.

4.1 Materials

Scheme 2 shows the synthetic routes to the copolymers. 1,2-Diamino-3,6-dibromobenzene (1),31a 1,2-diamino-4-fluoro-3,6-dibromobenzene (2),31b 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene (3),15a,31c 1,2-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (4)31d were synthesized according to literature procedures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were of commercial grade and used as received without further purification. All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere.

5,8-Dibromo-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-quinoxaline(M1). 
A mixture of 1,2-dibromo-4-fluoro-1,2-phenylenediamine (1) (0.66 g, 2.5 mmol) and 1,2-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl))ethane-1,2-dione (0.78 g, 2.0 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of acetic acid. The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C for 3 h and then cooled down to room temperature. The light yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography using 20% dichloromethane and hexane as the eluents (yield = 78%, 0.97 g). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz): δ (ppm): 7.73 (d, 2H), 7.47 (d, 2H), 6.79 (d, 2H), 2.95 (d, 4H), 1.59 (d, 4H), 1.30–1.28 (br, 12H), 0.88 (br, 6H).


5,8-Dibromo-6-fluoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (M2). 

M2 was synthesized by following a similar procedure used for M1, but 1,2-diamino-4-fluoro-3,6-dibromobenzene (2) (0.71g, 2.5 mmol) was used instead of 1,2-diamino-3,6-dibromobenzene (1). Monomer M2 was obtained as a yellow solid (yield = 63%, 0.86 g). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz): δ (ppm): 7.49–7.44 (br, 3H), 6.81 (d, 2H), 2.94 (d, 4H), 1.59 (d, 4H), 1.32–1.28 (br, 12H), 0.88 (br, 6H).


5,8-Dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (M3). 
A mixture of 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene (1.08 g, 3 mmol) and iron powder (2.02 g, 36.0 mmol) was added into acetic acid (100 mL); the mixture was briefly heated to 60 °C, and then the solution was stirred for another 4 h. The residual iron was removed by filtration and 1,2-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl) ethane-1,2-dione (4) (1.91 g, 3.0 mmol) was added to the filtrate, and heated under reflux for 12 h. The mixture was poured into water (100 mL) and extracted with CHCl3. The extract was then successively washed with water and brine. After drying over anhydrous MgSO4, the solvent was evaporated and subsequently purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: DCM/hexane = 1/7) to afford M3 as a yellow solid (yield = 1.55 g, 79%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz): δ (ppm): 7.49 (d, 2H), 6.83 (d, 2H), 2.92 (d, 4H), 1.59 (d, 4H), 1.31–1.29 (br, 12H), 0.88 (br, 6H).


General procedure for polymerization and polymer purification. 
5,8-Dibromo-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-quinoxaline (M1) (124.0 mg, 0.2 mmol), 5,8-dibromo-6-fluoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (M2) (127.6 mg, 0.2 mmol) or 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl) quinoxaline (M3) (131.4 mg, 0. 2 mmol) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) thiophene (0.2 mmol) were taken in a 25 mL two-necked flask under an N2 atmosphere. 8 mL of anhydrous toluene was added and the mixture was degassed for 20 min followed by the addition of [Pd(PPh3)4] (12 mg, 0.01 mmol). The mixture was heated at 110 °C for 36 h. After cooling to room temperature, it was poured into vigorously stirred methanol (300 mL) together with 30 mL of 30% aqueous NH4OH solution and the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol (2 × 200 mL). The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol (18 h), acetone (18 h) and hexane (18 h), and finally extracted with chloroform. The chloroform solution was then concentrated by evaporation and re-precipitated in methanol. The resulting solid was collected and dried overnight under vacuum. The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR, GPC, and elemental analyses.

4.2 Characterization
The molecular weight of the polymers was measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrenes as the reference standard and TCB as an eluent. All new compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR). The NMRs were recorded on a Bruker AV 600 MHz or 400 MHz spectrometer in trichlorobenzene (TCB) at 150 °C using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out on PerkinElmer TGA 4000 under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were conducted using a Mettler Toledo DSC 1 in a temperature range from 25 to 250 °C under nitrogen at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrometer model UV-3150. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was recorded on a Zahner Ennium Electrochemical Workstation with a glass carbon disk (coated with a polymer film), a Pt wire, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode respectively in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in the reflection mode, using a D/MAX-TTR III Rigaku X-ray diffraction system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out on a Digital Instruments Nanoscope V instrument, operated in a tapping mode.
4.3 Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices
The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was deposited through spin-coating on a pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass with a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron PVP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 3000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air, then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layer of the polymer and the fullerene derivative were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. For the conjugated polymer: PC71BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin coating with an ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution containing 8–10 mg ml−1 of the polymer. The ZrAcac cathode interlayer was simply prepared by spin-coating an ethanol solution (1 mg ml−1) on the photoactive layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s at room temperature; no thermal annealing or any other post-treatment was performed. Finally, the top electrode was deposited in a vacuum onto the active layer. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was ca. 60–120 nm, measured using an Ambios Tech XP-2 profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (150 W) coupled with a AM 1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the light source, and the optical power of the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured by using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 150 W xenon lamp.
The devices for the hole mobility measurement were fabricated using the architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au. Hole mobility was calculated by fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space-charge limited current, SCLC). The SCLC can be approximated by the eqn:  
Here J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ0 is the charge mobility at in a zero field, γ is the constant, L is the thickness of the blended film layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in hole device architecture, Vbi = 0.2 V).
