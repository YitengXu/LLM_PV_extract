Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) consist of a photoanode, an electrolyte and a counter photoelectrode. DSSCs are a kind of promising solar cell that have the potential to replace silicon based p–n junction solar cells because of their highly efficient photovoltaic conversions and lower cost in both materials and manufacturing. To date, charge recombination is still a main factor which limits the improvement of conversion efficiency. Therefore, how to improve charge transport has become a considerable interest. Recently, Grätzel's group reported that DSSCs reach ∼12% conversion efficiency by introducing a novel electrolyte with cobalt.1 The novel electrolyte can greatly retard the rate of interfacial back electron transfer (i.e. charge recombination) from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the oxidized cobalt mediator, which enables attainment of strikingly high photovoltages approaching 1 V.1
Currently, graphene draws rising attention because of its remarkable optical,2 thermal3 and electrical activities.4 Graphene possesses excellent electron mobility conduction because it is a zero band-gap material.5 In addition, graphene has a theoretically high surface area of ∼2600 m2 g−1.6 The application of graphene sheets in DSSCs is very promising. Graphene films have been explored as both the transparent electrode and the counter electrode for DSSCs due to their high transparency and electron transfer mobility as well as their electrochemical activities.7–11
Graphene sheets can provide pathways for electron transfer in graphene–TiO2 composites as DSSC photoelectrodes, which showed improved photo-energy conversion performances.12 The reason why charge can be transferred from TiO2 to graphene is that the conduction band of TiO2 around −4.21 eV13 is higher than the work function of graphene of about −4.42 eV.14 Due to both its remarkable electrical conduction and the matching conduction band of TiO2, graphene serves as the charge transport medium to enhance the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 at the anchor position to FTO. Thus, photo-induced electrons can move through graphene rather than TiO2–TiO2 grain boundaries, which would effectively suppress charge recombination. Thus, it seems reasonable to envision that the integration of TiO2 with graphene could be highly promising to improve the photovoltaic performance of TiO2.
Considerable efforts have been made to fabricate TiO2–graphene composites.15–19 In general, three steps have been employed to fabricate graphene–TiO2 composite films for DSSCs: (1) mixing graphene oxide with TiO2; (2) pre-reduction of graphene oxide to graphene by UV radiation or chemical reductants (such as hydrazine); and (3) coating graphene–TiO2 as a film on the electrode, followed by calcination at 450 °C. However, most of the precedent methods are unable to avoid the notorious aggregation problem of graphene owing to the intrinsic incompatibility between graphene and inorganic materials and an inability to balance the maximizing of contact with the nanoparticle while minimizing incident light absorption by graphene. Meanwhile, anchoring the TiO2 species densely and uniformly with graphene is also essential to promote electron transfer and achieve sufficient performance of graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites. Recently, Lee et al.18 demonstrated a simple and effective method to incorporate graphene sheets (GS) into TiO2 nanoparticle films via molecular grafting, which involves the attachment of titanium alkoxide onto functionalized graphene sheets by chemisorption. The maximum DSSC conversion efficiency of 1.68% based on the aforementioned GS–TiO2 nanocomposite was more than 5 times higher than that based on TiO2 alone.
In our recent work, we developed a novel in situ simultaneous reduction-hydrolysis technique (SRH) for the fabrication of TiO2–graphene hybrid sheets in ethylenediamine (En) solvent.20 The so-called SRH technique is based on the mechanism of simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide into graphene by En and the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles through hydrolysis of titanium(IV) (ammonium lactato)dihydroxybis, and subsequent in situ loading onto graphene through chemical bonds (Ti–O–C bond) to form a 2D sandwich-like nanostructure. The dispersion of TiO2 hinders the collapse and restacking of exfoliated sheets of graphene during the reduction process. The as-formed G–TiO2 exhibits high photocatalytic activity, as confirmed by the photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H6) in the presence of water vapor.
In this work, we demonstrate the enhanced photovoltaic performance of a DSSC using graphene–TiO2 (G–TiO2) photoelectrodes prepared by the SRH technique. The DSSCs based on the G–TiO2 nanocomposites improved their overall energy conversion efficiency to 7.1%. The further results prove that the promoting effect of graphene is strongly dependent on its content; namely, the efficiency of DSSCs increases to the maximum value and then decreases with increasing graphene content in TiO2–graphene composites. Excessive graphene in the nanocomposite leads to the decrease of light harvest of dye molecules and thus a negative effect on the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) (ammonium lactato)dihydroxybis (TBA) (50 wt% in aqueous solution) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Graphene oxide nanosheets were prepared using a modified Hummer's method from graphite powders. Deionized water was used throughout all experiments.
Preparation of graphene–titania samples
As reported previously,20 a certain amount of GO nanosheets were dispersed in deionized water. Then, 1 gram TBA and 5 mL ethanediamine were added to 10 mL GO aqueous solution. After stirring for 30 min, the obtained solution was transferred to a stainless Teflon-lined autoclave of 25 mL inner volume and heated the stainless Teflon-lined autoclave at 200 °C for 24 h in an electric oven. A series of nanocomposites of TiO2 with a varying amount of graphene are denoted as G0–TiO2, G2–TiO2 and G5–TiO2, according to the weight content of graphene designated as x wt% in G–TiO2 nanocomposites of 0, 2 and 5 wt%, respectively. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the nanocomposites were collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with alcohol and water three times. Finally, the resulting products were dispersed in water by sonication and then fully dried by lyophilization.
Fabrication of different photoelectrodes
Several volumes of absolute ethanol and 1 g of powder were transferred to a tall beaker and stirred for 10 min. The ultrasonic homogenization was performed using a Ti horn-equipped sonicator (Vibra cell 72408, Bioblock scientific). Then, 4 g of anhydrous terpineol (Fluka) and 5 g of the mixture solution of two ethyl celluloses in ethanol were added, followed by stirring and sonication. The contents in the dispersion were concentrated by evaporation at 38 °C with 120 mbar at first. The pressure was evacuated until 10 mbar. The pastes were finalized. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned with detergent, dilute HCl aqueous solution, KOH ethanol solution and deionized water in a ultrasonic cleaner. A layer of paste was coated onto the substrate using a doctor-blade technique. After being dried at 125 °C for 30 min in air, the film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min in air. Then the layer of film was sintered at 500 °C for 15 min in an airflow to improve the interconnection between the oxide film and the FTO substrate, as well as to remove any residual solvents or organic compounds. After being cooled to 80 °C, the film was immersed into N719 ethanol solution for 20 h. The counter electrode was a magnetron sputter platinum mirror. The substrate, film, and counter electrode constituted a sandwich-like open cell. The electrolyte was composed of 1.0 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMIMI), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2 and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15).
Characterization of G–TiO2 photoelectrodes
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained on an XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscope operating at 20 kV. A Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrometer fitted with an integrating sphere was used to investigate the optical absorption of the film. UV-visible absorption spectra of powder samples were recorded using a pure BaSO4 pellet as the reference. In the dye adsorption test, the sensitized photoanode is immersed into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaOH for dye desorption. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis spectroscopy) is used to examine the content of the dye. The specific surface area of the samples was measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K on a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar, USA) and calculated by the BET method.
Photovoltaic measurements of different photoelectrodes
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs employed a Keithley 236 source measurement unit and an AM 1.5 illumination cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator, which was calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) curves of the DSSCs were also obtained from PAR2273 workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA). The frequency range was from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and the DSSCs were subjected to AM 1.5 illumination. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was collected over the wavelength range 400 to 800 nm with a self-built computerized apparatus.
Results and discussion
FE-SEM images show that the typical G2–TiO2 nanohybrid sufficiently maintains the 2D sheet-like structure of graphene with several-micrometer lateral size and possesses rough surface (Fig. 1a). Additionally, the edge of graphene is clearly visible as indicated by the arrow (Fig. 1b), which is in sharp contrast with both smooth-surface graphene (Fig. 1c) and the irregular aggregation of pure TiO2 (G0–TiO2) nanoparticles formed in the absence of graphene (Fig. 1d). The TiO2 nanoparticles with size of 10–20 nm of the hybrid were found to uniformly distribute on and be in intimate contact with the graphene nanosheets to form a sandwich-like structure. This indicates that the in situ loading of TiO2 nanoparticles is not only an effective strategy to prevent graphene nanosheets from being restacked during the reduction process, but also prevents the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles. The TEM image further reveals that a large number of TiO2 nanoparticles spread uniformly and densely on the graphene surface (Fig. 2a and b). No apparent aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles on the graphene further demonstrates that the graphene scaffold is able to spread the nanoparticles to hinder aggregation. The HRTEM image reveals well-defined lattice fringes of TiO2 nanoparticles, corresponding to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 2c).

The effects of incorporation of graphene on the photocurrent, voltage, and power conversion efficiency of the TiO2-based DSSCs were evaluated as listed in Table 1. The measured J–V curves obviously indicate that the G2–TiO2 photoelectrode achieves a higher conversion efficiency (η) than G0–TiO2 (Fig. 3).

The corresponding short-circuit current density and η reach 13.93 mA cm−2 and 7.1%, respectively, which increase by 52.4 and 55.3%, relative to G0–TiO2, respectively. As the measured specific surface area of G0–TiO2 of 149 m2 g−1 is much larger than the G2–TiO2 surface area of 97.6 m2 g−1, the improved performance enhancement was obviously due to the promoting effect of graphene on reduction of recombination of the photo-generated carriers and fast electron transfer rather than the increase of dye loading in TiO2–graphene composite films. It should be noted that the short-circuit current (Jsc) of DSSCs shows a considerable increase with incorporation of graphene, however, open-circuit voltage (Voc) almost remains unchanged. In other words, the enhancement of η in the G2–TiO2-based DSSC was predominantly contributed to by an increase of its Jsc. It is well-known that Jsc is associated with the number of ejected electrons through the external circuit,21 while Voc corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level in the semiconductor (TiO2) under illumination and the Nernst potential of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte. The almost identical Voc values of the G0–TiO2-based cell and the G2–TiO2-based cell reveal that the incorporation of graphene does not influence the Fermi level of the composite semiconductor (TiO2–graphene), which is consistent with precedent reports.16
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed to investigate the electron transport properties in G0–TiO2 and G2–TiO2 film electrodes (Fig. 4a). There were two semicircles, the smaller one occurring at higher frequencies and the larger one at the lower frequency region, signifying the resistance of the counter electrode (RPt) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) occurring at the G–TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively.22 In addition, the high-frequency intercept (∼100 kHz) on the real axis represents the series resistance Rs.22 The Rs values corresponding to G0–TiO2 (6.2 Ω), G2–TiO2 (3.1 Ω) and G5–TiO2 (4.8 Ω)-based DSSCs show no obvious differences among them. The fitting value of Rct corresponding to G5–TiO2 (24.1 Ω) is smaller than that of G2–TiO2 (30.7 Ω) and G0–TiO2 (39.5 Ω). The low transfer resistance could be due to the incorporation of conductive graphene, which also favors electron transport over a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance in the DSSC. The first semicircle of G0–TiO2-based DSSCs is not obvious, because the electron-transport resistance (Rt), which would be an oblique line, overlaps the semicircle.22 As for G2–TiO2 and G5–TiO2 film DSSCs, the first semicircles can be observed, particularly the G5–TiO2 film, which indicates that the Rt reduced with the graphene increases.22 The lifetime of electrons in the oxide film (τe) can be estimated from the maximum angular frequency (ωmax) of the impedance semicircle arc at middle frequencies, according to the relation τe = 1/ωmax = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle-frequency peak.20 The electron lifetimes (τe) for recombination are estimated to be 19 ms for G0–TiO2 cell, 44.7 ms for G2–TiO2 cell and 29.2 ms for G5–TiO2 cell, respectively. This further confirms that graphene may accelerate electron transfer from TiO2 to the photoelectrode, leading to the reduction of electron–hole recombination and thus the increase of DSSC power conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the characteristic frequency in the Bode phase plot of the G2–TiO2 device shifted to a lower frequency relative to that of the G0–TiO2 device (Fig. 4b), further indicating that the charge-recombination rate is reduced in G2–TiO2 nanocomposite systems and leads to the capture of more electrons and the enhancement of the cell efficiency.23

In order to further confirm the role of graphene in DSSCs, incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were conducted. The maxima of the IPCE, at approximately 525 nm, is contributed to by the dye absorption, which corresponds to the visible t2 → π* metal-to-ligand charge transfer.24 The G2–TiO2 photoelectrode shows higher IPCE than G0–TiO2 (Fig. 5). The main factors which affect the IPCE are the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of electron injection and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons at the conducting glass substrate.25 Although G0–TiO2 possesses a larger surface area than G2–TiO2, probably leading to a higher absorption of the dye (the quantity of dye absorbed by G0–TiO2 (1.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2) is larger than G2–TiO2 absorption (7.6 × 10−9 mol cm−2)), the photoelectrode with graphene, which has a better capability to collect the injected electrons, increases the IPCE of G2–TiO2.
 Fig. 5  IPCE cures obtained form the photoanodes without and with graphene. 
As the graphene content further increased to 5 wt%, η decreased to 4.6%. This indicates that the introduction of excessive graphene into DSSC devices has a negative effect on Jsc and η (Table 1). It is widely recognized that graphene can absorb light in a large wavelength range of 200–800 nm. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra show that the absorption ranging from 400–800 nm is increased upon the incorporation of an increased amount of graphene into the matrix of TiO2 (Fig. 6). Therefore, the existence of excessive graphene reduces the light harvest of dye molecules, which ultimately decreases the IPCE and conversion efficiency of the DSSC.

Conclusions
A dye-sensitized solar cell based on graphene–TiO2 photoanode prepared by a novel in situ simultaneous reduction-hydrolysis technique was demonstrated to exhibit enhanced photovoltaic performance with an overall light conversion efficiency of 7.12% by incorporation of 2 wt% graphene. Graphene may accelerate electron transfer from TiO2 to the photoelectrode, leading to the reduction of electron–hole recombination and thus an increase of DSSC power conversion efficiency. The high short-circuit current proves the dominant contribution for higher conversion efficiency. The light absorbance of excessive graphene decreases the light harvest of dye molecules, which is a negative effect on the conversion efficiency of the DSSC.
