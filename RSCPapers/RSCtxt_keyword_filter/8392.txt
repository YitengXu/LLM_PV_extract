    , Accepted 15th February 2015First published on 17th February 2015AbstractA series of aromatic polyazomethines (PAMs) were prepared via direct polycondensation from 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxaldehyde and six different types of diamine containing triarylamines. The PAMs displayed good solubility in many organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CHCl3) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) which was beneficial for polymer film formation via spin coating, and exhibited outstanding thermal stability. These PAMs exhibited blue-green photoluminescence around 405–520 nm with a quantum yield of up to 48% in a dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solution. They exhibited halochromic properties with a color change from yellow to red, accompanied by fluorescence quenching after HCl-doping. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the PAMs were determined from cyclic voltammograms to be −5.01 to −4.88 eV and −2.15 to −2.11 eV, respectively. The PAMs films not only had good electrochromic properties with high coloration efficiency, but also generated photovoltage and photocurrent under simulated solar radiation.
1. Introduction
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have been extensively studied for different applications such as solar cells (SCs),1–4 electrophotography,5–7 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),8,9 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),10–12 and nonlinear optical materials (NLO).13 Recently, considerably more attention has been paid to the electrochromic properties of CPs (such as polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy)).14–16 Reynolds synthesized systematically and intensively studied thiophene derivatives, which have excellent electrochromic properties.17–19
PAMs with aromatic backbones are attractive CPs with high performance and a unique series of electrochromic materials due to the sp2 hybridized nitrogen atom in the main chain. They are similar to poly(p-phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) because the CN group is isoelectronic with the CC group. Moreover, PAMs are particularly interesting as CPs due to their documented excellent thermal, mechanical, electronic, optical, optoelectronic, and fiber forming properties.20,21 The introduction of –NC– into the backbone of the polymer is a facile alternative to the coupling method for the preparation of conjugated compounds. Iwan systematically investigated PAMs for photovoltaic applications in SCs,22 and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) obtained by his group improved enormously to 0.56%.23 Our group studied the hole transportation of PAMs in OLEDs and the electrochromic properties of PAMs in electrochromic devices.24,25
Carbazole (CZ) and its derivatives are also investigated due to well-known hole transportation, photoluminescence, inherent electron donating nature and excellent photo conductivity. CZ has become one of the most common building blocks, particularly in the design of compounds in which intramolecular/intermolecular charge transfer happens.26–29 The substituents in the 3rd and 6th positions of 9-carbazolyl can modulate hole-transporting properties, and triplet energy levels.30 Eyup Ozdemir prepared a coupled pyrrole–carbazole–pyrrole polyimine and studied its electro-optical properties and electrochromism31 and Mircea Grigoras also synthesized and characterized some carbazole-based polyimines.32
Highly electron-rich and redox-active compounds are useful building blocks in optoelectronic materials. Triarylamines (TA) is a unique molecule possessing particular functions such as its outstanding redox activity,33 fluorescence, liquid crystalline properties, and high oxidizability of the nitrogen atom.34 For this reason, polymers bearing the TA structure have been investigated for their transportability of positive charge centers via the radical cation species. PAMs containing TA and a lone pair of nitrogen atom in the imine group (CN) backbone can form intra- or inter-molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds with other groups.35 Furthermore, they also have the capabilities of protonation and complexation with metal ions, acid and iodine. A series of high-performance PAMs bearing TA derivatives have been extensively investigated with attractive electrochromic properties. Hindson analyzed the photovoltaic properties of TA-based PAMs.36 Chen thoroughly investigated donor–acceptor systems containing TA blocks.37
Common CPs are difficult to dissolve and melt. Over the past 25 years, different methods have been adopted toward processable PAMs by introducing various substituted groups (thiophene, phenylquinoxaline ring) and bulk monomers containing certain heterocyclic units (cardo-structure, tetraphenylethene) in the main chain.38 Among them, the introduction of bulky TA into PAMs is an effective approach to reduce their aggregation trend and to decrease their crystallization propensity with the aim to increase the solubility of the polymers.39
This paper presents the preparation of PAMs, which not only combine the electron-donating properties of CZ and TA, but also utilize the electrochromic properties of CZ and TA. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the photophysics, halochromism, and electrochromism of six types of new TA-based PAMs with different substituted groups stimulated by irradiation, acid and electrooxidation.

2.3 Measurements
The obtained PAMs were characterized by the following techniques: FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 Model FTIR spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AC-400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3, using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. UV-vis spectra were determined on a UV-3600 (Shimadzu). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with approximately 6–8 mg powder samples heated in flowing nitrogen (flow rate = 10 cm3 min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a PerkinElmer Pyris 6 TGA. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed on a Malvern instrument connected to one refractive index detector (Viscotek-VE3580-RI-DETECTOR), using a polymer–THF solution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C, and calibrated with polystyrene standards. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CH Instruments 660 A electrochemical analyzer at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 mol L−1 LiClO4/CH3CN. For the electrochromic investigation, PAM films were spin coated on an ITO-coated glass slide and a homemade electrochemical cell was built from a commercial UV-vis cuvette. The cell was placed in the optical path of the light beam in a UV-vis spectrophotometer, which allowed the acquisition of electronic absorption spectra under potential control in a 0.1 mol L−1 solution of LiClO4 as an electrolyte under nitrogen atmosphere in dry CH3CN. The thicknesses of the PAMs films were determined on a profile-system XP-100 (KLA-Tencor) by comparing them to the thickness of a blank ITO-coated glass slide. The oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymer films were measured using a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and quasi-reference electrode, respectively, and calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple by assuming the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ as −4.80 eV to vacuum. The photocurrent response of the PAMs was determined upon irradiation, both on and off with a 500 W Xe arc lamp supported by Beijing ChangTuo Co. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on a computer. Geometry optimizations were carried out using the B3LYP functional as implemented in the Gaussian 98 program. The highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers were calculated by the onset of oxidation potentials of the polymer films.42
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of polymers
The PAMs were prepared from 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-carbazole-3,6-dicarboxaldehyde and diamines containing a TA unit. The process was accomplished through a facile one-step polycondensation reaction under an N2 atmosphere without any catalyst. The structures of the polymers were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, which showed a strong absorption band at 1618 cm−1, which is assigned to the azomethine (CN) stretching. The introduction of alkyl groups increased the solubility of the PAMs, which dissolved well in common organic solvents, such as CHCl3, DMSO, NMP, DMAc, DMF, and THF. Azomethine formation was unequivocally proven by the characteristic imine protons at 8.70 ppm in the 1H NMR and 159 ppm in 13C NMR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†).
3.2 Thermal properties and molecular weight

Fig. 1 depicts a typical set of TGA curves for PAMs in nitrogen, and the results are summarized in Table 1. All the PAMs exhibited good thermal stability with a loss of 10 wt% at temperatures above 390 °C. From the table, PAM1 revealed the lowest thermal stability with a loss of 5 wt% at 300 °C due to the instability of its ethyoxyl groups. The 20% weight loss temperatures of these PAMs in nitrogen were recorded in the range of 465–530 °C. The amount of carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers in a nitrogen atmosphere was more than 45% (PAM6) at 700 °C. The high char yields of the PAMs could be ascribed to their high aromatic content.

For smart glass, the original color of PAMs in their neutral form should be light-yellow or colorless in contrast with their doped form, which should be deep colored in order to be distinguished in anodic electrochromic materials. The molecular weight of the PAMs was measured by GPC, using polystyrenes standards and THF as the eluent. Their weight-average molecular weight (w) and polydispersity (PDI) were determined to be 6100–88300 g mol−1 and 1.39–1.57, respectively (Table 1). In general, the effective high degree of conjugation makes the high molecular weight polymer insoluble, which is responsible for the lower ws of the PAMs containing naphthalenyl compared to the others. The calculated GPC data confirm that the DPn of PAM3 (12) was smaller than PAM4 (23).
3.3 Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the PAMs in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 2(A). From the figure, all the UV absorption peaks of the PAMs exhibited strong absorption at 330–390 nm, which was assigned to the π–π* transition resulting from the conjugation between the aromatic rings and the TA units combined by CN double bonds in the PAMs backbone. In the solid state, the maxima of the absorption spectra of the PAMs were centered at 340–400 nm (Table 2). The solid films of PAM3 (400 nm) and PAM4 (350 nm) were found to be bathochromically shifted (15 nm and 5 nm) from the corresponding dilute solution. In fact, the dihedral angles between the mean planes described by the central CZ and the CN group for PAM3 and PAM4 are 20° and 17° (Fig. S2, ESI†), respectively. This is smaller than the angle of the other PAMs between the CN group and CZ unit. The data confirms that PAM3 and PAM4 with biphenyl groups are co-planar with slight twist between the CN bond and CZ unit. The lower Egs and higher degree of conjugation of PAM3 and PAM4 relative to the other polymers are most likely responsible for the bathochromic shift observed for the films relative to the corresponding solution. However, PAM1, PAM2, PAM5 and PAM6 revealed a similar maximum absorption in the solid state compared to that in solution. The bigger dihedral angles of the molecular chain disturbed the effective aggregation.

As shown in Fig. 2(B), the PL spectra of the PAMs were measured in CH2Cl2 (conc: 10−6 mol L−1). For the PAMs, their emission colors ranged from blue (PAM6, CIE 1931: x, 0.1535; y, 0.1109) to green-blue (PAM5, CIE 1931: x, 0.3235; y, 0.4389). Furthermore, PAM5 and PAM6 exhibited green-blue and green PL emission, respectively.
The φs of these PAMs after refractive index correction43 were calculated and are summarized in Table 2. The PAMs exhibited PL emission maxima around 405–530 nm in CH2Cl2 solution with PL quantum yields from 4% to 48%. The PL intensities decreased in the order PAM4 > PAM2 > PAM5 > PAM6 > PAM3 > PAM1, which almost correspond to the energy gap (PAM4 > PAM3 > PAM5 > PAM6 > PAM2 > PAM1). The fluorescence of PAM2 is less than PAM3, most likely from nonradiative internal conversion involving vibrational energy dissipation either by bond rotation or with the solvent.44
3.4 Halochromic properties
As shown in the absorbance spectra (Fig. 3), the initially neutral PAM3 and PAM6 solution reveal their absorption λmax at 390 and 335, 400 nm, respectively. The absorbance of PAM3 and PAM6 was bathochromically shifted by 120 and 110 nm, respectively, when exposed to HCl vapor. These polymers showed new absorbances at 335, 505 and 510 nm with HCl exposure. Their apparent color turned from yellow to red upon acid vapor exposure. Similar changes were seen with the other PAMs in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), PAM6 displays the switching time of 3.6 s and the bleaching time of 4.6 s. At the end of the process, the solution returned to its original yellow color when exposed to NH3 vapor. Upon doping with HCl, the electron pair on the nitrogen, generating a positive charge on the nitrogen atom, was stabilized by a chloride anion.45
 Fig. 3  Absorbance spectral changes of PAM3 and PAM6 in CH2Cl2 when protonated with HCl vapor in steps during the same time interval. The concentration of the pure PAMs was 0.034 mg L−1. Inset: photographs showing the color changes upon HCl vapor exposure. The undoped molecular structure and protonated extreme resonance forms of the PAMs are shown on the right. 
The nitrogen atom in the imine linkage (CN) doped by acid created a positive charge that mostly caused an intramolecular change transfer, causing the color change. The protonation of CN in the PAMs also resulted in a considerably stronger electron-accepting center, which enhances the charge separation of the π-electrons in the conjugated polymer with the donor–acceptor structure. Therefore, these effects enhance electron cloud overlap and reduce the band gap, and then the color of the solution containing the PAMs change with pH values. From the UV-vis spectra, it can be found that the spectra of the PAMs doped by HCl were restored easily when undoped by NH3. Moreover, the consistent isosbestic points observed with repeated protonation/deprotonation provide additional evidence for the stability of the protonated intermediate. It additionally confirms that the neutral form is reversibly converted to the protonated form without decomposition, which was similar to the reported phenomena.46 The bands of PAM3 were almost the same to that of PAM6 with the color gradually changing to red. Particularly, the concentration of HCl vapor was very dilute, which indicate that the PAMs were especially sensitive to pH value.
On the other hand, the photoluminescence of the PAMs gradually disappeared when they were exposed to HCl vapor. With continuous exposure to HCl vapor, the photoluminescence of the PAMs were gradually quenched (Fig. 4), but it was restored after NH3 doping. In most of the cases azomethine protonation was suggested to increase fluorescence with rotational deactivation and photoisomerization. However, in this case the PAMs protonated by HCl would form hydrogen bonds to the nitrogen of CN, and such hydrogen bonding would enhance charge separation. As a result, the increasing strength of intramolecular charge transfer decreased the fluorescence efficiency, which was consistent with the observation by Jenekhe.47 Combined with the fluorescence quenching mechanism proposed by Skene, photoinduced electron transfer might occur to deactivate the singlet excited state.

3.5 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of these PAMs were investigated by CV with spin cast films on an ITO-coated glass substrate as the working electrode, and the entire test procedures were tested under nitrogen atmosphere. The thicknesses of the PAMs were measured to be about 1 μm. For comparison, one pair of reversible redox peaks for dialdehyde were determined at 1.7 V in the CV scans of the monomers (Fig. S5, ESI†). This indicated that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the CZ group was localized within the coplanar ring and encouraged the CZ group to be a weaker electron donor. Compared to the electrochemical data curves of the PAMs (Fig. 5), the oxidation of dialdehyde was more difficult. As a bridge linked triphenylamine (TPA) and CZ unit, the –CHN– blocks were not oxidized, and the attracting electron effect of the CN bond increased in the oxidation potential of the compound. Thus, the reduction–oxidation reactions of the PAMs occurred at the TPA unit in the diamine component.
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms for the PAMs in CH3CN containing 0.1 mol L−1 of LiClO4, at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
The cyclic voltammograms of PAM1 to PAM4 displayed oxidative peaks at 0.93, 0.95, 1.0 and 0.79 V, respectively, and the corresponding reductive peaks at 0.61, 0.81, 0.91 and 0.96 V, respectively. On the contrary, PAM5 and PAM6 exhibited a similar couple of symmetrical redox waves, in which the oxidative peaks were at 0.79 and 1.1 V (PAM5) 0.77 and 0.98 V (PAM6); and the reductive peaks were at 0.68, 0.98 (PAM5), and 0.67, 1.1 V (PAM6). The linear dependence of the peak currents as a function of the scan rates confirmed both a nondiffusional redox process and a well-adhered electroactive polymer film (Fig. S6, ESI†). Because of the stability of the films and good adhesion between the polymer and ITO substrate, PAM3 and PAM5 exhibited excellent redox stability. When compared with the cyclic voltammetry results, two oxidation processes occurred for PAM5, whereas both PAM2 and PAM3 had only one oxidation process as observed by differential pulse voltammogram (DPV), which is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).48 The simplified redox process of PAM2 could be proposed from its neutral state to radical cation state, in which the nitrogen atom of TPA is the redox reaction center corresponding to the electrochemical reaction site. Moreover, the anodic processes of PAM3 and PAM5 were investigated with equimolar ferrocene and a linear dependence of the currents as a function of the square root (Fig. S8, ESI†) was obtained. The number of electrons involved in the oxidation process was derived by comparing the intensity of the anodic current of ferrocene under such conditions. According to the simplified Randles–Sevcik equation, the number of electrons involved in the oxidation was calculated by comparing the peak currents of ferrocene to the given sample for specific scans rates.49 This suggested that the oxidation processes of PAM3 and PAM5 were both a single oxidation involving two electrons. As for PAM3, which has two amino centers in one repeat unit (containing two TPA in one repeat unit), the first and second oxidations happened simultaneously while electrons were lost from the two definitely separated TPA units, resulting in two separated radical cations on account of the blockage of the biphenyl-linkage between the two amino centers. In other words, there is no stable single radical cation in this case, thus two amino centers in one unit would be oxidized at the same time with a color change from light-yellow (neutral state) to red (oxidized state). However, for PAM5, its two oxidation stages should be attributed to the successive removal of two electrons from the repeat unit. These oxidation processes of PAM5 are associated with the monocation and dication formation of the two amino centers. Accompanied with two-electron oxidation, the color changed from yellow (neutral state) to red (first oxidized state), and finally to blue (second oxidized state). According to the electronic transfer process suggested by Liou,50 the proposed simplified redox process is shown in Scheme 2.

3.6 Quantum chemistry calculation
To obtain the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers, ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) vs. Ag/AgCl can be used to calculate the onset oxidation potentials (Eonset) or half-wave potentials (E1/2) that are reported in Table 2, whose redox potential is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV compared to vacuum to obtain accurate redox potentials of an electrode.
The HOMO energy values from PAM1 to PAM6 were calculated to be in the range from −5.01 to −4.88 eV as seen in Table 2. Generally, a high HOMO energy level easily results in electron escape, and an effective antioxidant property requires a higher HOMO energy level than −5.27 eV (the air oxidation threshold, ca. −5.27 eV).51 The HOMO energy levels of the PAMs were in the order of PAM3 > PAM4 > PAM1 > PAM2 > PAM5 > PAM6.
PAM3 had the strongest antioxidation properties among the studied polymers due to the fact that it had the lowest experimental HOMO energy level. Because their reduction curves could not be obtained, the LUMO energy levels of the PAMs were estimated from the EHOMO and Eg. The ELUMOs ranged from −2.15 (PAM1) to −2.11 eV (PAM6). To further understand the electronic structures of the polymers and to provide key parameters for the design of devices, it is necessary to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers.
From Fig. 6, the actual Eg data were in the order of PAM1 > PAM2 > PAM6 > PAM5 > PAM3 > PAM4, which is a slight deviation compared to the theoretical data. This was due to the interactions from the solvation process, molecular structure and electrons of the electron-withdrawing groups.

The different site linked TA played the key role in the electron structure and regulated the gaps of the PAMs. The suitable energy levels of the conjugated PAMs indicate that the PAMs could be used as charge transportation materials in PLEDs and solar cells.
3.7 Electrochromic properties
The PAM solutions were cast onto an ITO-coated glass substrate, and their electrochromic absorption spectra were monitored with a UV-vis spectrometer at different applied potentials. The typical electrochromic absorption spectra of PAM2 and PAM5 are shown in Fig. 7, and the other electrochromic absorption spectra of the PAMs are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The absorption of PAM2 started to change at 410 nm, in which the characteristic π–π* transition happened in TPA at 1.3 V, and the new peaks of PAM2 did not appear at the beginning of doping. When the applied potentials increased positively from 1.3 to 2.3 V, the characteristic absorbance peak at 410 nm gradually decreased, and one new band grew at 520 nm and the color changed from yellow to red. For the spectra of PAM5, the film exhibited strong absorption at 405 nm at 0 V. When the applied potential of PAM5 was in the region from 0.6 to 1.2 V, new bands appeared at 540 and 1040 nm in the NIR region, which gradually increased in intensity. While, the absorption at 405 nm of PAM5 faded away, and the color changed from yellow to red.

3.8 Spectroelectrochemical properties
The stability, response time, and coloration efficiency are the key parameters for an electroactive polymer film to be amenable for usage in optical and electrochromic devices, thus further electrochromic switching studies were performed.
For the optical switching studies in Fig. 8(a), the color switching times were estimated by applying a potential step, and the absorbance profiles were monitored. The switching time is defined as the time required for obtaining 90% of the full change in absorbance after the switching of the potential. The PAM5 film revealed a switching time of 2.6 s at 0.80 V for the coloring process at 505 nm and 2.4 s for bleaching. After continuous cyclic scans between 0.00 V and 0.80 V in 300 s, the polymer films still exhibited excellent stability in their electrochromic characteristics, indicating that the films were very stable and had good adhesion on the ITO substrate. The color switching time shown above was slightly slower than the bleaching switching time of 0.2 s for electrochromic polymer films. This may be due to slow ion permeation in the film of the PAMs.
 Fig. 8  (a) Potential step absorptiometry (upper) and (b) current consumption (lower) of PAM5 at 505 nm (in 0.1 mol L−1 LiClO4/CH3CN as the supporting electrolyte) by applying a potential step (0.00–0.80 V) with a cycle time of 10 s. 
The electrochromic coloration efficiency (CE: η) is also an important characteristic for electrochromic materials. η can be calculated using the equations given below:    where Tb and Tc are the transmittances before and after coloration, respectively, ΔOD is the change in the optical density, which is proportional to the amount of created color centers. Q (mC cm−2) denotes the amount of injected/ejected charge per unit sample area. From Table 3 it can be concluded that the order of the PAMs are PAM5 (246) > PAM4 (166) > PAM6 (83) > PAM2 (77) > PAM1 (73) > PAM3 (68). It showed that the CE of PAM5 exhibits up to 246 cm2 C−1 at 505 nm and revealed highly stable electrochromic properties (the others are listed in Table 3), due to the same planarity between the CN bond and the benzene ring, which are linked together with a direct bond.

3.9 Photoelectrical properties
A reversible rise/decay of the photocurrent was observed with light switching on and off many times, as shown in Fig. 9. For comparison the bare ITO did not exhibit the phenomena, which suggests that the PAMs were responsible for photocurrent generation. A steady anodic photocurrent was obtained from the dye monolayer-modified electrode when the PAMs/ITO electrode was illuminated under white light of 150 mW cm−2 intensity without any bias voltage in 0.1 mol L−1 LiClO4 electrolyte solution.

Upon irradiation, the photocurrent (the anodic current polarity is negative) increased and rapidly reached an approximately steady-state value. The photocurrent returned to the low level, after the irradiation was terminated. Moreover, the current density slightly decreased after several on/off cycles. The photocurrent response of the PAMs films was stably photoinduced. The photocurrent shown in Fig. 9 also demonstrated the typical open-circuit photovoltaic response of the electrode on illumination. After the light was turned off, the photovoltage decayed slowly to the lowest. On the contrary, after the light was turned on, the photovoltage increased instantly. A similar characteristic was observed for the other PAMs of this series. Thus, these PAMs can act as photoelectric conversion materials for optoelectronic applications. In Fig. 9(b), under the push of illumination, the photo-generated electrons were transported from the LUMO of PAM6 (−2.11 eV) to the conduction band of the ITO surface (4.7 eV) and moved to the external circuit. Then, the photocurrent was generated among the particulate hopping of electrons. From the Fig. 9, it can be noted that the photocurrent and photovoltage decayed slightly after the on/off illumination cycles procedure.
4. Conclusions
A series of highly stable anodic electrochromic polymers with excellent optical transmittance changes have been synthesized from dialdehyde and different diamines. The PAMs displayed good solubility in many organic solvents, such as THF, CHCl3, DMF and DMAc, which was beneficial for polymer film formation via spin coating. The polymers exhibited excellent reversible electrochemical behavior and continuous cyclic stability of their electrochromic characteristics. The color of the PAMs could be varied from initially yellowish to red via electrooxidation. Moreover, multiple reversible colors states were also observed with pH value. Thus, these PAMs can be used as new hole-transporting and electrochromic materials because of their proper EHOMO values and stable electrochromic behavior, while the resulting polymers also exhibited potential applications in optoelectronics.
