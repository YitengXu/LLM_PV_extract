E-mail: hqwang@suda.edu.cn; wlma@suda.edu.cnReceived 27th July 2013, Accepted 24th September 2013First published on 25th September 2013AbstractSmall molecules TPDA, TPDB, and TPDH, comprising the same backbone TPD (N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine) and different carboxyl side chains were designed and synthesized as hole-transporting materials in polymer solar cells. These small molecules demonstrated improved solubility in polar solvents due to the introduction of the weakly acidic carboxyl groups. The lengths of the side chains can also influence the film forming ability. Compared to conventional PEDOT:PSS, these small molecules showed higher transmittance in the visible range as revealed by UV-vis measurements. Desirable energy-level alignment for efficient hole-transporting and electron-blocking ability was indicated by their absorption and UPS spectra. Without applying any post-treatment to these buffer layers, comparable and improved device performances were achieved compared with PEDOT:PSS buffered control devices. A high power conversion efficiency of 6.51% was realized by a TPDB buffered device employing a low band gap polymer PBDTTPD as the active material, which showed ∼15% efficiency enhancement over the control devices. Equally important, better device stability was demonstrated by using TPDB as the new hole-transporting layer.1 IntroductionBulk hetero-junction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted remarkable attention during the past ten years due to their well-known advantages of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and easy fabrication.1–8 Very recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 10% for single junction PSCs have been reported.9–11 The impressive progress in the development of new conjugated polymers has contributed a lot to the fast increase of device performance.2,12–14 As part of this, the interfacial layers have played an important role in achieving high-quality devices.10,15,16 In traditional PSCs, the hole-transporting layer (HTL) has been typically used to improve the compatibility of the transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the active layer, adjust the energy levels for efficient hole collection, minimize the contact resistance and thus improve the device performance.17–19Commercial poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is currently the mostly popular hole-transporting material (HTM) in PSCs. However its intrinsic deficiencies, such as acidic and hygroscopic properties,20,21 electrical inhomogeneity22 and insufficient electron-blocking ability,23 still limit its further application. Therefore, a number of other materials have been reported to replace PEDOT:PSS, including water-soluble polymers such as PSSA-g-PAIN and SPDPA,24,25 crosslinkable materials such as TPDSi2,26 PTPDSi2,27 and IDT-BTPA,28 and small molecules such as DITPY-Ph4,29 TAT and TMTI.30 In addition, inorganic materials such as graphene/graphene oxides,31–34 semiconducting metal oxides including NiO,35 MoO3,36 WO3 (ref. 37) and others38,39 have also been reported as other classes of HTMs. Although moderate efficiencies have been achieved for the devices buffered by most of these materials, there are still challenges. For example, water-soluble materials generally contain strong acidic –SO3H groups, and as for crosslinkable materials and metal oxides, complicated deposition processes or extra post-treatments are always required. Furthermore, for solution-processed organic HTMs, few have shown better efficiencies than PEDOT:PSS in PSCs. In this work, we designed and developed new HTMs with the purpose to achieve high efficiency and good stability for PSCs with an easy fabrication process.Three small molecules, TPDA, TPDB, and TPDH with different side chains including acetic acid, butyric acid or hexanoic acid were designed and prepared by modifying N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TPD), an archetypical hole-transporting material used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).40,41 TPD-based compounds have been used or further modified as efficient HTMs in organic solar cells due to their high transmittance, suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and good electron-blocking ability.26–30,42–44 However, most of these TPD-type films have been deposited by thermal evaporation or prepared in a complex way. In this work, new TPD-type HTMs were designed to possess suitable energy levels and good solubility in polar solvents, thus can be applied in PSCs by a solution process. The optimized films exhibit high transmittance in the visible range and provide a favorable interface demonstrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. To investigate the applicability of these new TPD-type materials as HTLs in PSCs, a prototype polymer poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and another efficient polymer donor poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione) (PBDTTPD)45–48 were chosen as the active materials to fabricate the photovoltaic devices, with the PEDOT:PSS HTL buffered ones as the control samples. The best PCE of 6.51% was achieved when TPDB was applied in a PBDTTPD-based device with a post-treatment-free process, showing a ∼15% enhancement in comparison with the control device. Equally important, the devices with TPDB-HTL exhibited better stability than the control devices buffered by PEDOT:PSS under ambient conditions.2 Experimental2.1 MaterialsAll chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or J&K Chemicals, and then used as received.

The solution was stirred and back extracted by diethyl ether (2 × 100 ml). Then the aqueous phase moderate HCl (1 M) was added. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 125 ml).

The ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned stepwise in acetone, detergent, water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone using ultrasound. After oven drying, the ITO was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 4500 rpm for 40 s and subsequently baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The optimized TPD-type HTLs were prepared on the ITO substrates by spin-coating (3000 rpm) TPDA isopropanol (IPA) solution (1 mg ml−1), TPDB IPA solution (1 mg ml−1), and TPDH dimethylformamide (DMF) solution (0.5 mg ml−1) respectively for 40 s. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 30 s from a solution of P3HT:PC61BM (11:9, w/w) containing 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (v/v) or PBDTTPD:PC61BM (10:10, w/w) containing 2% DIO (v/v) in chloroform in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, 0.6 nm of LiF and 100 nm of Al were deposited on the photoactive layer in a vacuum chamber by thermal evaporation at a pressure lower than 1 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device was 7.25 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured in a glove box using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated by a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using a certified IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments, Inc, Solar Cell Scan100).3 Results and discussion3.1 Design and synthesis of HTMsIn order to improve the solubility of TPD, weakly acidic carboxyl groups were introduced to the TPD moiety via alkoxy chains. Here the alkoxy chain is used as we believe it could balance the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxyl group due to its electron-donating properties, which then guarantees the hole-transporting ability of the resulting molecules. Furthermore, the chain length of the alkoxy chain can be further adjusted to improve the solubility and the film-forming ability of the molecule.49 The synthetic procedures for TPDA, TPDB, and TPDH are shown in Scheme 1. The common precursor TPDOH was prepared according to previous reports.50,51 The TPD-type ester compounds were synthesized via Williamson ether synthesis with good yields. Further hydrolysis of these esters afforded the target compounds, whose chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry (see the experimental section for details). Scheme 1  Synthetic route to TPDA, TPDB and TPDH. 3.2 Theoretical calculationThe geometrical and electronic properties of TPDA, TPDB and TPDH were revealed by the Gaussian 09 program suite. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation was optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Molecular orbitals were visualized using Gaussview. As displayed in Fig. 1, the slight difference of the dihedral angles between different benzenes in TPDA (40.61° and −35.86°), TPDB (39.75° and −35.56°) and TPDH (39.58° and −35.39°) suggest that the increase in the chain length contributes little to the distortion of the molecular structure. The electron density of the HOMO is mainly delocalized through the π-orbitals of the triphenylamine units, and as expected, the alkoxy chain contributes to the delocalization of the HOMO but has less influence on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) electron density. This will be helpful in tuning the HOMO levels. Fig. 1  Optimized geometries and molecular orbital surfaces of the HOMO and LUMO of TPDA, TPDB and TPDH, obtained at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. 3.3 Physical propertiesUV-vis spectroscopy was used to evaluate the absorption of the solution-processed thin films of TPDA, TPDB and TPDH as depicted in Fig. 2(a). All the films show similar absorption spectra mainly in the ultraviolet region, suggesting big optical bandgaps (Eoptg) which can be calculated from the absorption onset (λonset). Fig. 3 shows the optical transmission spectra of the optimized films of TPDA, TPDB, TPDH, along with the spectrum of the PEDOT:PSS film used as a reference. Consistently, all the TPD-based HTMs exhibit better transmittance in the visible range than PEDOT:PSS, resulting in less interference with the absorption of the active materials, hence benefiting light harvesting in the PSCs.

Fig. 3  Optical transmittance of the TPDA, TPDB and TPDH films and the PEDOT:PSS layer on quartz. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was utilized to investigate the energy level alignment of the HTM films, as displayed in Fig. 2(b). The ionization potential (IP) was estimated from the measured cut-off energy of the secondary-electron and the onset energy of the HOMO level. The LUMO levels of the HTMs can be calculated by using the corresponding IP and Eoptg (see Table 1).52 Together with the reported electronic energy levels of PEDOT:PSS,35 P3HT,17 PBDTTPD,47 and PC61BM,17 the energy diagram of the materials is presented in Fig. 4(b). TPDA, TPDB, and TPDH show similar HOMO levels very close to that of PEDOT:PSS, suggesting their potential as efficient hole collecting materials. Furthermore, the significantly higher LUMO levels (−2.19 to −2.13 eV) of these HTMs relative to those of most polymers endow them with good electron-blocking capability.

(b) Schematic energy diagram of the materials involved in the PSCs. (c) The molecular structures of TPDA, TPDB, TPDH, P3HT, PBDTTPD, and PC61BM. The atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the HTLs involved in this work were taken to study the morphologies of these films (Fig. S1, ESI†). Given that TPDA and TPDB are easily soluble in isopropanol (IPA) (>10 mg ml−1) while TPDH is soluble in dimethylformamide (DMF) (>10 mg ml−1), these films were prepared from the corresponding solvents with the optimized concentrations. Their surface roughnesses (root mean square, RMS) are 4.3 nm, 4.1 nm and 2.9 nm for the TPDA, TPDB and TPDH film, respectively, indicating that the film surface gets smoother with increased chain length, which is in accordance with the general understanding that long side chains could improve the film quality of small molecules.49 In addition, the interface between the active layer and the HTL can usually be influenced by their specific adhesion, which relies on molecules' affinity for water or oil. The measurements of the contact angle to water were carried out to study these properties. The measured angles of 62.9°, 61.9°, 66.8° and 5.2° for TPDA, TPDB, TPDH and PEDOT:PSS, respectively, indicate that the surfaces of the TPD-based HTLs are more hydrophobic than the surface of the PEDOT:PSS films (Fig. S2, ESI†), which may benefit the wetting of the polymer:fullerene solution and the consequent formation of the active film on these TPD-based HTLs.533.4 Photovoltaic propertiesTo investigate the effect of these HTMs, PSCs were fabricated with the configuration ITO/HTMs/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al (Fig. 4(a)). For comparison, control devices were fabricated with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. The detailed device results are summarized in Table 2 (more details about the device optimization under different conditions can be found in Fig. S3, ESI†). Excellent capabilities as HTLs in PSCs are confirmed for both TPDA and TPDB by their comparable device performances (PCE 2.92% and 3.03%) with that of the control device (PCE 2.94%), while TPDH exhibited a lower PCE due to a smaller short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which could be attributed to its relatively long side chain. The long and insulating side chain leads to increased series resistance (Table 2) and reduced photovoltaic performance, even though TPDH could form a smoother and more uniform film than TPDA and TPDB.

It is known that the effect of the interfacial layer has a reliance on the chemical structures of the polymer donors.15 With this in mind, a low bandgap polymer PBDTTPD containing the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione unit with alkoxy side chains was employed as the donor, with which we believe that O–H and O–O interactions tend to be formed between the side chains of the HTM and the alkoxy side chains of the active polymer and hence good contact tends to be achieved between the HTM and PBDTTPD, which will help to improve the device performance.15,54,55 As shown in Tables 2 and 3, obviously decreased series resistances (Rs) were observed for the TPD-HTM buffered devices (7.5, 4.9 and 9.9 Ω cm2) compared to the PEDOT:PSS buffered device (15.9 Ω cm2) when the polymer PBDTTPD was used (Table 3). However, in contrast, when the polymer P3HT was used, slightly increased series resistances were recorded for the TPD-HTM buffered devices compared to the control device (Table 2). We consider this evidence for the improved contact between the TPD-HTL and the PBDTTPD layer, which is consistent with the enhanced interfacial molecular interaction. As a result, increased Jsc (10.86, 11.51 and 10.89 mA cm−2 respectively) and largely enhanced FF (constantly 65%) were observed for all the PBDTTPD-based devices using TPD-type materials as the HTLs, while the reference device with PEDOT:PSS HTL showed open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and FF values of 0.91 V, 10.76 mA cm−2, and 58%, respectively, corresponding to a PCE of 5.68%, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5(b). The increase of both Jsc and FF should be attributed to the enhanced hole-extraction from the polymer to the anode. The highest PCE of 6.51% was achieved by the optimized device using TPDB as the HTL with Jsc up to 11.51 mA cm−2 and FF up to 65%, which were much higher than those of the control device.

To further understand the effect of these new HTMs on the modification of the interface, we deposited PEDOT:PSS and TPDB successively as the HTL in devices adopting the same device structure. According to the results in Tables 2 and 3, the PCE of 3.16% for the P3HT-based device and 5.93% for the PBDTTPD-based device were slightly higher than the corresponding control devices. This could be attributed to the improved surface hydrophobic properties and the electron-blocking ability of the PEDOT:PSS film by the top TPDB layer. In addition, the effects of various solvents, and solution concentrations of TPDB on the device performance were also examined (Table S1, ESI†).The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 6. The P3HT:PC61BM-based solar cells with TPDB and PEDOT:PSS as HTLs showed the maximum EQE values of 54% and 51% at ∼510 nm with theoretical Jsc values of 7.78 mA cm−2 and 7.18 mA cm−2, respectively. For PBDTTPD:PC61BM-based devices, the maximum EQE values of 61% and 54% at ∼620 nm with theoretical Jsc values of 10.09 mA cm−2 and 9.11 mA cm−2 were recorded when TPDB and PEDOT:PSS were applied as the HTL, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the device J–V characteristics (Fig. 5, Tables 2 and 3) and the transmittance spectra of TPDB and PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 3). Stability measurements were carried out for unencapsulated solar cells based on both P3HT:PC61BM and PBDTTPD:PC61BM under ambient conditions (Fig. 7) and in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S4, ESI†). The devices with TPDB HTL exhibited comparable stability in an inert atmosphere to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS buffered PSCs. However, when stored in the laboratory at ambient conditions, the TPDB buffered devices showed obviously slower degradation than the control devices in the parameters Jsc, FF and PCE, with an almost unchanged Voc. This could be explained by the improved quality of TPDB with much decreased acidic and hygroscopic properties compared to PEDOT:PSS.56 Fig. 6  EQE spectra of the devices with configurations as follows: (a) ITO/HTMs/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al, (b) ITO/HTMs/PBDTTPD:PC61BM/LiF/Al.  Fig. 7  The stability of P3HT:PC61BM device parameters (a) and PBDTTPD:PC61BM device parameters (b) in air under ambient conditions without encapsulation. 4 ConclusionsIn summary, we have demonstrated efficient and stable PSCs using solution-processable new TPD-type materials as the hole-transporting layer using a spin-coating method without any post treatment. All films based on these TPD-type materials exhibited good transmittance and suitable energy levels. The film quality could be tuned to some extent by adjusting the lengths of the side chains of the small molecules, which consequently influenced the device performance. As the most efficient HTM, TPDB with a butyric acid side chain provided comparable performance for the P3HT:PC61BM-based solar cells to that of the control device. Meanwhile, with PBDTTPD:PC61BM as the active layer, the device with TPDB HTL exhibited a higher PCE of up to 6.51% with an increase of ∼15% in comparison with the control device, due to the improved Jsc and FF. Equally significant, the unencapsulated TPDB-buffered devices showed better stability than the PEDOT:PSS control devices under ambient conditions. All these results suggest that TPDB is a very promising hole-transporting material for polymer solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (grant no. 2011AA050520), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 61176054), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.
