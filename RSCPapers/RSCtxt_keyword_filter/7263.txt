    , Accepted 1st November 2011First published on 23rd November 2011AbstractSurface modification plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), but the reported surface treatments are in general superior to the untreated TiO2 but inferior to the typical TiCl4-treated TiO2 in terms of solar cell performance. This work demonstrates a two-step treatment of the nanoporous titania surface with strontium acetate [Sr(OAc)2] and TiCl4 in order, each step followed by sintering. An electronically insulating layer of SrCO3 is formed on the TiO2 surface via the Sr(OAc)2 treatment and then a fresh TiO2 layer is deposited on top of the SrCO3 layer via the TiCl4 treatment, corresponding to a double layer of Sr(OAc)2/TiO2 coated on the TiO2 surface. As compared to the typical TiCl4-treated DSSC, the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated DSSC improves short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) by 17%, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) by 2%, and power conversion efficiency by 20%. These results indicate that the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment is better than the often used TiCl4 treatment for fabrication of efficient DSSCs. Charge density at open circuit and controlled intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy reveal that the two electrodes show almost same conduction band level but different electron diffusion coefficient and charge recombination rate constant. Owing to the blocking effect of the SrCO3 layer on electron recombination with I3− ions, the charge recombination rate constant of the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated DSSC is half that of the TiCl4-treated DSSC, accounting well for the difference of their Voc. The improved Jsc is also attributed to the middle SrCO3 layer, which increases dye adsorption and may improve charge separation efficiency due to the blocking effect of SrCO3 on charge recombination.
1. Introduction
Over the past 20 years, the scientific and technological interest in the practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) has grown fleetly,1–10 due to its low cost, ease of production, and high efficiency comparable with that for amorphous silicon solar cells. The typical DSSC consists of a dye sensitizer, a nanoporous TiO2 film, an electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple, and a platinum coated conductive glass. The power conversion efficiency has been raised to >11% through the great efforts of researchers working in the DSSC field,11–13 and it is promising to improve the efficiency to 15% by optimizing the components in DSSCs.
The breakthrough of DSSCs comes from the use of nanoporous TiO2 films composed of nano-sized particles.1 The high surface area of nanoporous semiconductors provides high loading of the monomolecular dye layer adsorbed directly on the TiO2 surface, ensuring sufficient light harvesting efficiency and high electron injection yield. However, as the untreated TiO2 films usually generate lower incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency and short-circuit photocurrent than expected, surface modification of TiO2 is always needed for higher current generation.2 The well-known TiCl4 treatment of nanoporous TiO2 films is often used to enhance photocurrent over the past 20 years, and the TiCl4-treated TiO2 films have been employed for the fabrication of almost all the high-efficiency DSSCs. The post treatment of TiO2 films with TiCl4 aqueous solution can form a fresh thin TiO2 layer on the initial TiO2 surface so that charge separation efficiency is improved.14,15
Because of the absence of significant band bending in the nano-sized particles,16 DSSCs suffer from charge recombination between photoinjected electrons and acceptors such as the oxidized dye cations and I3− ions in the redox electrolyte. To reduce the charge recombination, which will otherwise lead to remarkable electron loss and performance reduction, ultrathin layers of metal oxides, titanate, and carbonate have been applied on the surface of the nanoporous TiO2 electrode to improve the performance of DSSCs.17–22 Durrant et al. found that the ultrathin layer of Al2O3, SiO2, or ZrO2 coated on the TiO2 surface could block charge recombination between injected electrons and oxidized dye molecules.17 Zaban et al. reported that coating of Nb2O5 on the TiO2 surface formed an inherent energy barrier at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which retarded charge recombination and resulted in a significant improvement of power conversion efficiency.18 Based on the reported results, the comparison of solar cell performance was made between coated and uncoated TiO2 other than the TiCl4-treated TiO2. Although considerable improvements of open-circuit photovoltage and power conversion efficiency were achieved with the coated TiO2, as compared to the uncoated TiO2 electrode, the efficiency is still lower than that of the DSSC based on the TiCl4-treated TiO2. Therefore, looking for a new surface modification strategy better than the TiCl4 treatment is more meaningful.
In this work, the nanoporous TiO2 electrode was first treated with strontium acetate followed by sintering and then with TiCl4 followed by sintering, resulting in an ultrathin double layer of SrCO3/TiO2 coated on the surface of TiO2. This two-step surface modification strategy provides an electronically insulating layer of SrCO3 to suppress charge recombination and a fresh TiO2 layer available for efficient electron injection. It was found that the double layer coating caused significant improvements of both short-circuit photocurrent and open-circuit photovoltage, relative to the TiCl4 treatment. As a result, power conversion efficiency was improved remarkably. The mechanism by which the double layer coating influences the conduction band level, charge transport and charge recombination was also discussed through analysis of charge density at open circuit and intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS).
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
LiI, I2, methoxy propionitrile (MPN), strontium acetate [Sr(OAc)2] hemihydrate and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were obtained from Acros. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) was obtained from Tomiyama Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan. N719 (cis-di(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)) was obtained from Solaronix SA. All of the chemicals and solvents used in this work were of reagent-grade quality. F-doped SnO2 conductive glass (FTO, resistance 15 Ω per square, transmittance 85%) was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan, and ultrasonically rinsed in acetone and water, respectively, before use. The redox electrolyte for use in DSSCs contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPImI, and 0.5 M TBP in dehydrated MPN.
2.2 Fabrication of uncoated and coated TiO2 electrodes
TiO2 films (4.49 ± 0.05 μm) composed of TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm)23 were fabricated on FTO substrates using a screen printing method and sintered at 525 °C for 1 h. The procedures for surface treatment of TiO2 films are illustrated in Scheme 1. The TiCl4 treated electrodes were obtained by dipping the as-prepared TiO2 films in 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by washing with water and sintering at 525 °C for 30 min. For the surface modification with Sr(OAc)2 and TiCl4 in order, the as-prepared TiO2 films were first immersed in 0.0125 M strontium acetate aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by washing with water and sintering at 525 °C for 30 min, and then the Sr(OAc)2 treated films were dipped in 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by washing with water and sintering at 525 °C for 30 min. The three kinds of films, uncoated TiO2, TiCl4-treated TiO2 (TiO2–TiCl4), and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated TiO2 [TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4] films, were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 solution (in acetonitrile/tert-butanol, volume ratio of 1/1) for 12 h when they were cooled down from sintering to ∼120 °C. The counter electrode (Pt-coated FTO) and the working electrode (dye-loaded TiO2 film) were sealed together using a 30 μm thick hot-melt Surlyn spacer under heat.24

2.3 Photovoltaic performance measurements
The DSSCs were evaluated by recording the J–V curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193 equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5 filter). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). Power conversion efficiency (η) can be calculated with η = Jsc × Voc × FF/P, where Jsc is short-circuit photocurrent, Voc is open-circuit photovoltage, FF is fill factor, and P is the light intensity (typically 100 mW cm−2) of simulated solar light. Action spectra of incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength were obtained with an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments). The intensity of incident monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640). To eliminate the stray light, a black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2, measured with a Nikon Digital Camera controlled by a computer using an objective micrometre ruler as a reference, was used to measure the solar cell performance.
2.4 Characterizations
The thickness of the films was determined using a surface roughness/profile measuring instrument (Dektak 150, USA). The content of Sr in TiO2 films was measured with inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was collected at a take off angle of 75° using a ULVAC Physical Electronics XPS-1800 spectrometer with the Al Kα line (1486.6 eV). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured with IRPrestige-21, Shimadzu. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for Sr(OAc)2 was recorded with a Shimadzu model DTG-60H. The charge transport was measured using IMPS,25 charge recombination was measured with IMVS,26 and charge density at open circuit was measured with the charge extraction technique.27 Electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and electron lifetime (τn) are estimated from IMPS and IMVS measurements (see details in the ESI†). The IMPS/IMVS and charge extraction analysis were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany), which includes a green light emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and the corresponding control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 0.5 to 45 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity. For charge extraction measurement, the intensity of the green LED was kept at 45 W m−2 for 1 s before turned off and then the open-circuit photovoltage transient was recorded. The open-circuit photovoltage transient decay time was set from 0 to 16 s, followed by a short-circuiting of the measured DSSC at different decay times, and meanwhile the extracted charge transient was recorded.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterizations of surface treatments
When the TiO2 film was dipped in the Sr(OAc)2 solution, Sr2+ ions along with the acetate could be adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface.28 Calcination at 525 °C made the adsorbed Sr(OAc)2 convert to SrCO3 as revealed by TGA (Fig. S1, ESI†), and thus SrCO3 was formed on the TiO2 surface. It is seen from Fig. S1 (ESI†) that two weight loss steps were observed when Sr(OAc)2 was heated from room temperature to 700 °C. The first weight loss (observed 4.1%, calculated 4.2%) between 190–250 °C is due to the dissociation of water (eqn (1)), and the second weight loss (observed 28.0%, calculated 28.2%) between 360–600 °C indicates the conversion of Sr(OAc)2 to SrCO3 (eqn (1)). According to the literature,29 SrCO3 can be stable up to 850 °C, and the reaction between SrCO3 and TiO2 started from 850 °C. Therefore, the formation of SrTiO3 could be ruled out when the Sr(OAc)2 treated TiO2 was sintered at 525 °C. When the TiO2 film was treated with TiCl4, a fresh TiO2 layer was formed after sintering.15 Therefore, a double layer of SrCO3/TiO2 was coated on the TiO2 surface upon the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment followed by sintering. (1)To further confirm the formation of strontium carbonate, FTIR spectra were measured for both SrCO3-coated and uncoated TiO2 films. While the untreated TiO2 is featureless in the spectral range of 1600–1300 cm−1, one strong IR peak at 1450 cm−1, assignable to the O–C–O stretching vibrations30 in CO32−, appears in the spectrum of the Sr(OAc)2 treated TiO2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). This result strongly supports the formation of carbonate upon Sr(OAc)2 treatment followed by sintering.

Fig. 1 shows the XPS for the Sr(OAc)2 treated TiO2 film. Peaks assignable to Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2 were detected at 133.4 and 135.2 eV, respectively,31 indicating the presence of Sr(II) in the TiO2 film.31 ICP-AES measurement indicated that the molar ratio of Sr/Ti was 0.02% in the TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 electrode (Scheme 1). The amount of SrCO3 formed on the TiO2 surface was 0.4 mg per gram of TiO2.

3.2 Effect on dye adsorption

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis spectra for the three electrodes after dye adsorption. The absorbance at 520 nm was 0.126, 0.115, and 0.152 for the untreated, TiCl4-treated and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated film (1 μm), respectively. The TiCl4 treatment slightly decreased the dye adsorption due to the decreased surface area, but the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment increased the dye adsorption. The enhanced dye loading is attributed to the higher isoelectric point for SrCO3 than that for TiO2.32 The maximum absorption peak was located at 530 nm for the N719-loaded TiO2 and TiCl4-treated TiO2 films, but it was blue shifted to about 520 nm when SrCO3 was coated on the TiO2 surface. The blue shift of the maximum peak is also attributed to the basic property of SrCO3.

3.3 Effect on current–voltage characteristics
As it is easier to control the film thickness using one-printing process than using multi-printing process, we fabricated thin films through one-printing to minimize the experimental errors. DSSCs based on the three TiO2 electrodes were evaluated under illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light. Photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 1. The untreated TiO2 produced Jsc of 6.28 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.788 V, and FF of 0.69, corresponding to η of 3.41%. The TiCl4 treated TiO2 produced Jsc of 7.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.815 V, and FF of 0.69, corresponding to η of 4.23%. The TiCl4 treatment improved Jsc by 20%, Voc by 3% (27 mV), and η by 24%. When the TiO2 film was first treated with Sr(OAc)2 and then treated with TiCl4, the DSSC produced Jsc of 8.83 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.833 V, and FF of 0.69, corresponding to η of 5.08%. Evidently, the combined surface treatment of Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 is better than the TiCl4 treatment in both Jsc and Voc. The Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment improved Jsc by 17%, Voc by 2% (18 mV), and η by 20%, as compared to the typical TiCl4 treatment, and improved Jsc by 41%, Voc by 6% (45 mV), and η by 49%, as compared to the untreated TiO2. As the reference cells used in this work were of unusually low efficiency, the observed efficiency improvements due to the surface modifications were remarkable, but such a significant increase in performance could not be obtained if a more efficient cell (e.g. η > 10%) was used as a baseline. When Sr(OAc)2 treatment was applied to the untreated or TiCl4-treated TiO2 as the last step, we observed improved Voc but decreased Jsc and η as compared to their initial counterpart electrodes.

3.4 Effect on IPCE spectrum
To analyze the difference of Jsc, IPCE as a function of incident monochromatic light was measured. Fig. 3 shows the IPCE spectra for the DSSCs based on the untreated, TiCl4-treated and Sr(OAc)–TiCl4-treated electrodes, respectively. Although the TiO2–TiCl4 electrode had a lower dye loading than the untreated TiO2, the former produced higher IPCE, accounting for the photocurrent improvement upon TiCl4 treatment (Table 1). The TiCl4 treatment improved IPCE at 520 nm by 18%. The Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment further improved IPCE as compared to the TiCl4 treated one. The IPCE at 520 nm was 53% and 63% for the TiCl4- and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4-treated DSSCs, respectively. Introduction of an insulating layer of SrCO3 between the initial TiO2 surface and the newly-added TiO2 layer created by the TiCl4 treatment resulted in IPCE improvement by 19%. IPCE can be expressed by the product of light harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection efficiency (CIE), and charge collection efficiency (CCE). Considering that the incident light was absorbed approximately twice by the dye in solar cells with a Pt mirror, we calculated the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), to the first approximation, using LHE = 1–10−2A, where A is the absorbance of dye-loaded TiO2. If the absorbance increased linearly with increasing the film thickness, the absorbance at 520 nm was 0.53 and 0.68 for the TiCl4-treated and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated electrodes (4.5 μm), respectively, as estimated from Fig. 2. The LHEs at around 520 nm were estimated to be 91% and 96% for TiCl4-treated and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated TiO2 electrodes (4.5 μm), respectively. The increase in LHE from the TiCl4-treated to Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treated TiO2 electrode was calculated to be 5%, which is much smaller than the increase (19%) in IPCE at 520 nm. Evidently, either of the other two factors (CIE and CCE) or both must also be responsible for the significant increase in IPCE.

3.5 Effect on the conduction band level

Fig. 4 shows the open-circuit photovoltage as a function of the photo-induced charge density (Q) in TiO2 at open-circuit. In DSSCs, an increase in Voc at a given charge density implies an upward shift of CB and vice versa.33 A straight line of the Voc ≈ lnQ plot indicates that Voc increases linearly with the logarithm of the charge density for the three DSSCs. The relationship between Voc and Q, derived from a linear fit of Vocvs. ln(Q),33 is obtained as follows: TiO2: VOC = 0.217 V + 0.139 V ln(Q)(2) TiO2–TiCl4: VOC = 0.178 V + 0.139 V ln(Q)(3) TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4: VOC = 0.178 V + 0.139 V ln(Q)(4)As compared to the untreated TiO2, the TiCl4 treatment results in a positive shift of CB by 39 mV. The two surface-treated electrodes show the same CB. Although SrCO3 is basic, the surface charge of the TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 electrode is dominantly controlled by the final-step of TiCl4 treatment, as the SrCO3 layer is buried under the fresh TiO2 layer and the amount of SrCO3 is pretty low. As the two surface treatments cause positive shift of CB, it is concluded that the surface is positively charged after TiCl4 or Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment.

3.6 Effect on electron transport

Fig. 5 shows the electron diffusion coefficient (D) as a function of Voc. D increases with Voc following the exponential relation:34,35 (5)Under a given Voc, the electron diffusion coefficient of the three electrodes increases in the order of TiO2 < TiO2–TiCl4 < TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4. This result implies that the trap density is reduced by TiCl4 treatment and further reduced by Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment.

3.7 Effect on charge recombination
A positive shift of CB by 39 mV as shown in Fig. 4 will directly cause a decrease in Voc by 39 mV upon surface treatments. However, different improvements of Voc by the surface treatments were observed as seen in Table 1. To interpret the Voc improvement, the effect of surface treatment on charge recombination was studied. Fig. 6 compares the electron lifetime (τ) of the DSSCs based on TiO2, TiO2–TiCl4 and TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4, respectively. For all cases, electron lifetime decreased with increasing charge density following a power-law relation with exponent of −1. At a given Q, TiCl4 treatment improved electron lifetime by 2-fold. Treatment with Sr(OAc)2 followed by TiCl4 treatment further improved the electron lifetime by 2-fold as compared with the TiCl4 treated solar cell.
 Fig. 6  Log–log plot of electron lifetime against charge density at open circuit for the DSSCs with untreated, TiCl4-treated, and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4-treated TiO2 respectively. 
As the charge recombination rate is proportional to the recombination current density (Jr), we use Jr to denote the charge recombination rate. At a fixed light intensity, Jr equals Jsc because charge recombination at short-circuit is negligible. Fig. 7 shows the dependence of charge recombination rate on photoinduced charge density at open-circuit. The charge recombination rate follows a relation of R ∝ kQ2.6, where k is the charge recombination rate constant. At the same charge density, the charge recombination rate was reduced by the TiCl4 treatment and further suppressed by the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment. The ratio of recombination rate constant k(TiO2)/k(TiO2–TiCl4)/k(TiO2–Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4) is calculated to be 4:2:1. From the untreated to the TiCl4-treated DSSC, the reduced recombination rate constant is likely due to the positive shift of CB, which reduces the driving force for charge recombination. By comparison of the two surface treated electrodes, the driving force for charge recombination is same due to the same CB and same electrolyte, but the introduced electronically insulating layer of SrCO3 under the fresh TiO2 layer further decreases the recombination rate constant by 2-fold. Electrons are injected from the excited dye molecules to the CB of the outer TiO2 layer, then transport across the middle insulating SrCO3 layer via quantum tunneling to the inner TiO2. The middle insulating layer blocks the access of the injected electrons back to the surface, where charge recombination between electrons and acceptors (oxidized dye molecules and I3− ions) occurs. Thus, the charge recombination rate constant is reduced by the blocking layer.

3.8 Effect on photocurrent
As the effect of TiCl4 treatment on photocurrent has already been discussed by O'Regan et al.,14,15 herein we pay attention to the discussion why Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment produces higher IPCE and Jsc than the TiCl4 treatment. As the increased LHE due to the increased dye adsorption is not fully responsible for the increased IPCE and Jsc, the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment should provide higher CIE and/or CCE than the TiCl4 treatment. A decreased recombination rate at open circuit and an increased electron diffusion coefficient might imply a decreased recombination rate at short circuit as well. This in turn could reduce current losses arising from recombination at short circuit in the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4-treated cell, relative to the TiCl4-treated cell, resulting in an increase in CCE and thus an increase in photocurrent. However, it is reported that current losses due to charge recombination at short circuit is pretty low15 and CCE is close to 100%36 in the TiCl4-treated cell especially for thin TiO2 films. If this is true, the increased IPCE or Jsc is mainly attributed to the improved electron injection yield though the two treated electrodes have the same CB. The only difference between the two surface treated electrodes is the middle SrCO3 layer. The electronically insulating layer can block electron recombination with dye cations and I3− ions, and thus charge separation can be improved. Therefore, the retarded charge recombination is likely to increase electron injection yield. So far, we do not have the direct evidence to verify this point.
3.9 Effect on photovoltage
The reduced charge recombination rate can bring about a Voc gain compensating for the Voc decrease originating from the downward shift of CB. At one sun illumination, the photo-induced charge densities at open-circuit were measured to be 56.4, 89.6, and 102.8 μC cm−2 for the untreated, TiCl4-treated, and Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4-treated DSSCs, respectively. According to the relation derived from Fig. 4, the change of charge density increases Voc by 64 mV from the untreated to the TiCl4-treated DSSC. The collective effect of the positive shift of CB (39 mV) and the reduced charge recombination rate is an increase in Voc by 25 mV (= 64 − 39) from the untreated to the TiCl4-treated DSSC, which is in good agreement with the experimentally observed Voc increase (27 mV). By comparison of the two surface treated DSSCs, suppression of charge recombination results in a Voc gain of 19 mV. As the two treated electrodes show the same CB, the retarded charge recombination should be solely responsible for the increase (18 mV) in Voc from the TiCl4-treated to the Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4-treated DSSC, as seen in Table 1.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a two-step surface modification strategy is proposed for use in DSSCs, with which a double layer of SrCO3/TiO2 is coated on the TiO2 surface. As compared to the typical TiCl4 treatment, the two-step Sr(OAc)2–TiCl4 treatment improves Jsc by 17%, Voc by 2%, and η by 20%. The middle SrCO3 layer slows down the charge recombination rate by 2-fold, accounting well for the experimentally observed increase in Voc. These findings provide a new surface modification strategy of nanoporous TiO2 for fabrication of efficient DSSCs.
