    , Accepted 5th November 2018First published on 5th November 2018AbstractSuper-connected nanostructures were developed through bridging reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with poly[benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien)naphthothiadiazole] (PBDT-DTNT) and poly[bis(triiso-propylsilylethynyl)benzodithiophene-bis(decyltetradecyl-thien)naphthobisthiadiazole] (PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT) polymers. The higher tendency of conjugated polymers towards the rGO surface increased the thickness of super-connections up to 9–12 nm. The red-shifted and more intensified identifying peaks in ultraviolet-visible spectra and more quenched photoluminescence spectra of PBDT-DTNT/rGO nano-hybrids were ascribed to better π-stacking of PBDT-DTNT chains compared to PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT ones onto rGO nanosheets and their stronger donating–accepting features. The presence of TIPS side structures made the arrangement of PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DTs more difficult. The donor–acceptor nano-hybrids were subsequently applied in the active layers of photovoltaic devices in pure and mixed states with the PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT complex polymers. These types of innovatively designed nanostructures eliminate the need for phenyl-C-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and similar acceptor components. In contrast to poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based delicate morphologies, the active layers based on complex polymers such as PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT reflected coarser phase separations. Super-connected rGO nanosheets templated larger phase separations particularly in the presence of donor polymer chains, and thereby high performance photovoltaics were acquired. The best-performing devices based on PBDT-DTNT/rGO + PBDT-DTNT reflected 11.15 mA cm−2, 0.67 V, 64% and 4.78% characteristics. External quantum efficiency (EQE) experiments also verified the well-performing photovoltaics based on complex polymers.
Introduction
In the past decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained huge attention because of their potential advantages of low cost, light weight, flexible fabrication and low-temperature solution processing.1–4 Since the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture was developed and also some novel structured conjugated polymers have been introduced, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly increased.5–12 Notably, a PCE over 14% was recently reported by Zhang et al. in organic solar cells via chlorinated non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors.13
Among the conjugated polymers, benzobisthiadiazole (BT)-14,15 and naphthothiadiazole (NT)-containing polymers, owing to their planar structure, excellent π–π interaction and easy synthesis, have attracted much attention.9,16 Compared to BT, NT composed of two thiadiazole rings fused in the skeleton of central naphthalene, has a larger planarity and a stronger electro-withdrawing ability, which can be utilized as the acceptor unit in a donor–acceptor structure to achieve high performance photovoltaic applications.17–21 In a recent publication, benzodithiophene (BDT) as a donor unit was added to NT to reach donor–acceptor polymers with a relatively lower optical band gap.9 In addition, thanks to its high planar structure, weak steric hindrance between neighboring units and easy functionalization with substitutes such as alkylthio22,23 and triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS),24,25 BDT is one of the most promising donor moieties to achieve excellent photovoltaic characteristics.
Graphene oxide (GO) was chemically modified by phenyl isocyanate,26–29 poly[3-(potassium-6-hexanoate)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3KT)30 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)31 for developing the electron acceptor components for PSCs. An organic photovoltaic device based on solution-processable functionalized graphene nanosheets reached a PCE of 1.1%.29 Others utilized the graphene-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) composite to improve the hole transfer in an organic device with a PCE up to 3.70%.32 The reduction of GO was the most efficient method to produce large amounts of reduced graphene oxide (rGO).33–36 Suspensions of graphene and rGO have been utilized to nucleate P3HT nanofibers36 and modify the orientation of crystals in P3HT thin films.37,38 Functionalized rGO was used as a hole transporting material.34,35 A graphene–fullerene composite (rGO–pyrene–PCBM) was also reported with a PCE of 3.89%.39
In the current work, super-connected nanostructures were developed through bridging rGO nanosheets with PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT conjugated polymers. The donor–acceptor nano-hybrids were subsequently applied in the active layers of photovoltaic devices in pure and mixed states with the PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT complex polymers. The best-performing photovoltaics reached an efficiency of 4.5%. These types of pre-developed nanostructures eliminate the need for PCBM and similar acceptor components and pave the path for enhanced photovoltaic properties.
Experimental
Synthesis of PBDT-DTNT
2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2,3-didecylthiophen-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and 3,7-di(3-hexylthiophen-5-yl)-naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole were added to dry toluene in a reactor under argon. Tris-(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) as a catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) as a ligand were then quickly added to the reactor and the reaction mixture was purged for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then heated under reflux for 48 h. Subsequently, the reactor was cooled to 30 °C and dropped into methanol. The resulting polymer was precipitated and collected by filtration. PBDT-DTNT was obtained as a dark green solid. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the synthesized polymer was 59 kDa and its polydispersity index (PDI) was 2.1. Fig. 1(a) shows 1H NMR spectra and the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) trace of PBDT-DTNT. More details about the monomer synthesis are reported in the literature.91H NMR (ortho-diclorobenzene (ODCB)-d4, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 8.78–8.82 (2 H), 8.11–8.13 (2 H), 7.87 (2 H), 7.38 (2 H), 2.43–2.76 (12 H), 1.04–1.60 (80 H), 0.65 (18 H). The UV-vis spectra of PBDT-DTNT polymers are presented in Fig. 1(c).

Synthesis of PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT
The purified bis-stannyl monomer (BDT-TSSn), dibromo-monomer DTNT-DTBr2, toluene and dimethylformamide (DMF) were added to a reactor and the mixture was bubbled with argon for 30 min. Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 were then added and the solution was bubbled with argon for another 30 min. The mixture was stirred at 105 °C for 48 h. The polymer was finally endcapped with 2-tributylstannylthiophene and 2-bromothiophene to remove bromo and tributylstannyl end groups. The crude polymer after filtration was further purified by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol, acetone, hexane and toluene, respectively. The bisstannyl-compound (BDT-TIPSSn) and dibromo-compound (DTNT-DTBr2) were used as comonomers. The copolymer was obtained as a black solid with Mn = 60 kDa and PDI = 1.7. Fig. 1(b) reports 1H NMR spectra and the SEC trace of PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT. More details about the synthesis of reaction moieties are reported in the literature.161H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 9.12–8.95 (2 H), 8.22–8.10 (2 H), 7.15–6.95 (2H), 2.95 (4 H), 1.91 (2 H) 1.50–1.10 (122 H), 0.82 (12 H). The UV-vis spectra of PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers are presented in Fig. 1(c). In comparison with the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based polymers,40–43 the naphthothiadiazole (NT)-based ones displayed red-shifted absorption spectra.
Sample preparation and photovoltaic device fabrication
The synthesized polymers, i.e., PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT were dissolved in diclorobenzene (DCB) (100 °C, 30 min) and added to pre-dispersed rGO nanosheets in DMF (DCB:DMF was 50:50 v/v with a total concentration of 0.1 wt%). The resulting vials were subjected to sonication (30 °C, 5 h) and crystallization (30 °C, 24 h). The active layer solutions including the donor–acceptor super-connected nanostructures were spin-coated inside a nitrogen glove box onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) modified indium tin oxide (ITO, a sheet resistance of 10–15 Ω per square) on glass to yield 400 nm films. The thickness of active layers was verified by a surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500). To complete the device fabrication, a LiF interfacial layer (1 nm) and Al electrode (100 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the device under vacuum below 2 × 10−4 Pa. Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization was performed using a computer-controlled measurement unit from Newport under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Super-connected rGO nanosheets viaPBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT bridges
Herein, super-connected nanostructures were designed via bridging of rGO nanosheets with PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT conjugated polymers. These complex polymers whose structures are depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (b) have fused and unfused thiophenic and benzenic rings. Hence, they had a great tendency to be π-stacked onto the rGO nanosheets. The bridged rGO nanosheets with the PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT assemblies were developed parallel with the smart accumulation of conductive polymers. The pristine rGO nanosheets before any processing steps are depicted in Fig. 2(a). On the basis of surface profilometer and AFM results, the mean thickness of rGO nanosheets ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 nm. The accumulation of PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT chains onto the rGO nanosheets and construction of conjugated bridges between them increased the thickness of the nanostructures to 9–12 nm. Fig. 2(b) and (c) illustrate the three- and two-layered super-connections based on PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT bridges, respectively. Two-, three-, four- and five-layered super-connected nano-hybrids were developed for both PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers. As an example, the π-stacked assemblies of PBDT-DTNT chains produced darker colonies in the bright transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips CM30) image of Fig. 2(b). These irregular assemblies bridged the rGO nanosheets in the vicinity of each other through π-deposition onto them. Likewise, as shown in Fig. 2(c), more complicated polymer chains having TIPS side structures, i.e., PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT, also constructed conjugated bridges between the rGO nanosheets and connected them together. However, being conjugated and having thiophenic rings were not sufficient reasons to fabricate π-stacked bridges between the rGO nanosheets. To demonstrate this fact, in another experiment, conjugated regioregular P3HT chains were utilized instead of PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers in the solution growth environments. Surprisingly, individual fibrillar crystals were grown with a base attached to the rGO surface (Fig. 2(d)). That is to say, in the presence of P3HTs, no connection was detected between the rGO nanosheets. Despite the fact that all P3HT, PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers were conjugated, only complicated structures including fused rings were capable of constructing the conductive bridges between the rGO nanosheets. Actually, the P3HT chains had a strong tendency to be π-stacked onto their neighboring similar chains and develop fibrillar crystals instead of connecting the rGO nanosheets. The schemes of Fig. 3 represent the structures of synthesized polymers, their arrangement onto the rGO nanosheets, and finally the super-connected nanostructure composed of rGO nanosheets and conductive polymeric bridges.

Absorbance, photoluminescence, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of super-connected nano-hybrids
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis, Lambda 750) equipment was employed to study the optical characteristics of super-connected donor–acceptor nanostructures in the thin film state. Both PBDT-DTNT/rGO and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO super-connections presented four identifying peaks in thin films (Fig. 4(a)). The maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) for the PBDT-DTNT/rGO nano-hybrids were 397, 470, 728 and 751 nm. The corresponding λmax values for the PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO donor–acceptor nanostructures were 385, 447, 668 and 684 nm. The red-shifted and more intense identifying peaks in UV-vis spectra of PBDT-DTNT/rGO nano-hybrids were ascribed to better π-stacking of PBDT-DTNT chains compared to PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT ones onto rGO nanosheets. Indeed, the presence of TIPS side structures made the arrangement of PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT more difficult. For comparison, UV-vis spectra of the P3HT/rGO thin film are also presented in Fig. 4(a). These nano-hybrids demonstrated three identifying peaks comprising 470, 546, and 608 nm. UV-vis spectra also demonstrated the stronger absorption of complicated conductive polymers compared to P3HT. The photoluminescence (PL, optistatDry-BLV model) spectra of super-connected donor–acceptors were recorded in the range of 550–900 nm (Fig. 4(b)). Further quenching in the PL spectra of super-connections compared to the P3HT/rGO nanostructures proved their stronger donating–accepting property. Moreover, the PL quenching and thereby the donating–accepting characteristic of PBDT-DTNT/rGO nanostructures was more intensified, resulting from their more ordered accumulations.

Note: the color and type of lines in PL spectra (b) are similar to UV-vis ones (a) and those of EQE spectra (d) are like J–V ones (c). 
The photovoltaic characteristics of super-connected donor–acceptor structures were investigated by fabricating the associated solar cells having ITO/PEDOT:PSS/super-connection/LiF/Al configurations. Fig. 4(c) represents the J–V curves of various photovoltaic devices. The short-circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values for PBDT-DTNT/rGO were 6.84–6.91 mA cm−2, 0.65–0.66 V, 41–43% and 1.82–1.96%, for PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO were 4.11–4.18 mA cm−2, 0.65–0.66 V, 36–39% and 0.96–1.07%, and for P3HT/rGO were 2.28–2.34 mA cm−2, 0.63–0.65 V, 31–33% and 0.44–0.50%, respectively. By adding the respective donor polymers, i.e., PBDT-DTNT into PBDT-DTNT/rGO layers, PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT into PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO layers, and P3HT into P3HT/rGO layers, the photovoltaic properties conspicuously improved. The Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values for PBDT-DTNT/rGO + PBDT-DTNT were 11.03–11.15 mA cm−2, 0.66–0.67 V, 61–64% and 4.44–4.78%, for PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO + PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT were 8.96–9.02 mA cm−2, 0.65–0.67 V, 52–54% and 3.03–3.26%, and for P3HT/rGO + P3HT were 4.21–4.26 mA cm−2, 0.64–0.65 V, 37–39% and 1.00–1.08%, respectively. The best-performing photovoltaic devices were fabricated on the basis of PBDT-DTNT/rGO + PBDT-DTNT (≤4.78%) and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO + PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT ≤ (3.26%) nano-hybrids. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded versus the potential of a standard Ag/AgNO3 electrode, which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and bandgap (Eg) energies for different systems are tabulated in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined using the onset of oxidation and reduction in the CV curves. The results demonstrated that a lower Eg reflected better efficiencies of the fabricated photovoltaic devices.

That is to say, the Voc values of PBDT-DTNT/PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT and P3HT based systems were not exactly similar (0.63–0.65 versus 0.65–0.66); however, compared with P3HT, the naphthothiadiazole and benzodithiophene containing polymers demonstrated more red-shifted absorption spectra while maintaining suitable energy levels for effecting reasonable Voc and efficient charge separation between the polymer and rGO. On the other hand, the crystallinity strategy (face-on, edge-on, and flat-on) of P3HT assemblies was completely different from that of PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT assemblies.44 The crystallinity and crystal quality could in turn affect the Voc.45 In fact, the effective parameters on the Voc value are different in PBDT-DTNT/PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT and P3HT systems.

Fig. 5(a)–(f) report the active layer morphologies of the above-mentioned photovoltaics using AFM images. In comparison with the P3HT/rGO (Fig. 5(c)) and P3HT/rGO + P3HT (Fig. 5(f)) delicate morphologies, the active layers based on complex polymers such as PBDT-DTNT (Fig. 5(a) and (d)) and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT (Fig. 5(b) and (e)) reflected coarser phase separations. In fact, the super-connected rGO nanosheets templated larger phase separations particularly in the presence of donor polymer chains (Fig. 5(d) and (e)), and thereby high performance photovoltaics were acquired. The consequences demonstrated that complex polymers such as naphthothiadiazole- and benzodithiophene-containing polymers could conspicuously act better than routine polymers like P3HT in pre-developed donor–acceptor nanostructures. External quantum efficiency (EQE) experiments also verified the well-performing photovoltaics based on complex polymers (Fig. 4(d)). Peak values around 91, 77, 59, 41, 45 and 27% were detected at 670, 668, 630, 653, 575 and 566 nm for PBDT-DTNT/rGO + PBDT-DTNT, PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO + PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT, PBDT-DTNT/rGO, P3HT/rGO + P3HT, PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT/rGO and P3HT/rGO based photovoltaic devices, respectively. The Jsc values calculated from EQE measurements (Table 1) were to some extent lower than normal Jscs reached from the J–V data. AM 1.5 applied in the EQE system is standard data, however, in the case of a solar simulator, this is simulated by a xenon lamp, thereby it is feasible to have different values in both systems. All photons reaching a photovoltaic device are not transmitted to the active region where the conversion process occurs.

Conclusions
Super-connected nanostructures were designed via bridging rGO nanosheets with PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT complex polymers. Despite the fact that all P3HT, PBDT-DTNT, and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT polymers were conjugated, only complicated structures including fused rings were capable of constructing conductive π-stacked bridges between the rGO nanosheets. The P3HT chains had a strong tendency to be π-stacked onto their neighboring similar chains and develop fibrillar crystals instead of connecting the rGO nanosheets. Red-shifted and more intense UV-vis spectra as well as further quenching in the PL spectra of super-connections compared to the P3HT/rGO nanostructures demonstrated their better absorbance and stronger donating–accepting properties. The donor–acceptor super-connections were then employed in the active layers of photovoltaic devices in pure and mixed states with the PBDT-DTNT and PBDT-TIPS-DTNT-DT complex polymers. The best-performing devices based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-DTNT/rGO + PBDT-DTNT/LiF/Al configuration resulted in 11.15 mA cm−2, 0.67 V, 64% and 4.78% photovoltaic characteristics.
