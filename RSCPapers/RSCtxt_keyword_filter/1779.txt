    , Accepted 29th November 2011First published on 3rd January 2012AbstractA long-term stable Pt counter electrode modified by POM-based multilayer film has been fabricated by the electrochemical deposition method, which can markedly increase short-circuit photocurrent, open-circuit voltage and the conversion efficiency when used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention since their discovery, and have been regarded as a potential candidate for the next generation solar energy conversion technologies as a result of their low cost of fabrication and high energy conversion efficiency.1 Typically, a DSSC mainly consists of three parts: a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple, and a counter electrode. The operational principle of DSSCs involves the photo-induced oxidation of a dye molecule on a mesoporous TiO2 working electrode, and the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules by reacting with reduced ions (iodide) in electrolyte. The counter electrode, at which oxidized ions (tri-iodide) are reduced to reduced ions (iodide), plays an important role for the completion of the above circuit. Therefore, an ideal counter electrode must be of high electrocatalytic activity for the redox reaction, low overpotential, small charge transfer resistance (Rct) and long-term stability. At present, the most widely used counter electrode is fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass coated with Pt. Although different methods have been used to modify Pt counter electrodes, how to improve the Pt anodes' electrocatalytic activity and lower the charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface are still urgent questions to be solved.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of inorganic anionic clusters and exhibit a rich diversity of properties, such as catalysts,2 medicine,3 electrochemistry,4,5 geochemistry6 and magnetism7 owing to their chemical, structural and electronic versatility.8,9 Especially in electrocatalysis field, POM-modified electrodes exhibit predominant catalytic activity. Meanwhile, it should be noted that POMs are so stable in some organic solvents that the POM-modified electrodes are long-life in electric devices even if exposed in electrolyte for several days. Taking advantage of the reversible electrochemical activity of POMs, Górnez-Romero et al. prepared a new class of hybrid electrode by combination of a conducting polymer matrix with the phosphomolybdate anion and established the function of these hybrid materials as solid insertion electrodes.10 Yoshikawa and Awaga et al. developed a nanohybrid system between the Keggin-type POMs and single-wall carbon nanotubes and reported their applications in lithium batteries.11 Almeida et al. utilized conducting polyanilines doped with Keggin-type POMs as counter electrode in the DSSCs, although the efficiency of cells remains to be increased.12 These pioneering studies indicate that POMs will be promising candidates to modify the counter electrode of DSSCs.
Herein, we design and fabricate a new kind of POM-modified Pt counter electrode, which takes advantage of the insolubility and thermal stability (see EIS†, Fig. S1) of the tri-substituted α-K3H4[SiW9Al3(H2O)3O37]·7H2O (denoted SiW9Al3) in CH3CN, and uses it as a modificator to fabricate a SiW9Al3/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (denoted PDDA) composite electrode by the electrochemical deposition method. To summarize, this composite electrode has four advantages: i) the modificator used is inexpensive; ii) the modification is easy to handle and need merely a very simple electrochemical workstation to complete this process; iii) it possesses long-term stability in electrolyte; iv) above all, this composite electrode exhibits a higher conversion efficiency (η), higher short current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) compared with the bare Pt counter electrode. To our knowledge, the present paper is the first report on the use of POM-based multilayer film as a modificator coated on the Pt counter electrode of DSSCs.

Electrochemical deposition method was employed to fabricate -modified Pt counter electrode and the existence of polyoxoanion on this composite electrode was proved by cyclic voltammetry (CV), in which two pairs of reversible redox peaks corresponds to SiW9Al3 electron transfer processes (detailed fabrication see ESI†, Fig. S2).
Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was employed to study the relationship between layer number of SiW9Al3 and the electrocatalytic ability (Fig. 1). Usually, Rct is related to exchange current density (J0), which is caused by reducing of triiodide to iodide at the counter. Eqn (1)13 shows their relationship:  J0 = RT/nFRct(1)J0, R, T, n, F, and Rct represent exchange current density, gas constant, temperature, the numbers of electrons in the redox reaction, the Faraday constant and charge transfer resistant, respectively.

The semicircle in high frequency corresponds to Rct, and the distance between zero and the start point of the semicircle relates to serials resistant (Rs). The Rct and Rs values for modified electrode with different number of layers were obtained by fitting EIS spectra, and are summarized in Table 1. These values indicated that all of counter electrodes modified with SiW9Al3 showed lower Rs. Compared to pure Pt counter electrode, one-layer-modified {SiW9Al3/PDDA}/Pt counter electrode showed significantly low Rs and Rct, suggesting that SiW9Al3 anions not only act as a good catalyst to regenerate I3− and but also are good conductors to connect Pt nanoparticles on the surface of FTO. This phenomenon may interpret as follows. As we know, electrons were transported in Pt nanoparticles by a lot of netlike tracts. When all the Pt nanoparticles and FTO were linked together by one-layer of {SiW9Al3/PDDA} film, an ocean of electrons were formed, as a result, electrons can easily be transported to ions in electrolyte. Compared to one-layer-modified electrode, two-layer-modified {SiW9Al3/PDDA/SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode did not result in more lower Rs and Rct which may attribute to the PDDA cations between two layers of SiW9Al3 that reduced the conducting ability and catalytic ability. Notably, the three-layer modified electrode showed the lowest Rct, one reason for which may be that enough SiW9Al3 anions have been attached to the Pt anode surface and inserted into the space between nanoparticles so that the blocking impact from PDDA cations can be ignored. For four layers of SiW9Al3 films, an obvious increase in Rct has been observed because enough thick film might separate Pt nanoparticles and oxidized ions in electrolyte; but Rs value decreased at the same time. As far as a five-layer modified electrode is concerned, Rs value was almost the same as that of the four layer-modified electrode, but Rct increased too much for the reason that inner SiW9Al3 anions and Pt nanoparticles may only work as conductors and hardly play any catalytic function. Because Pt serves as a catalyst for triiodide reduction, the drastic decrease in Rct implies an acceleration of the I3−reduction rate. Therefore, according to the above data, it can be concluded that three-layer-modified {(SiW9Al3/PDDA)2SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode has the best electrocatalytic ability. For that reason, the subsequent experiments are carried out based on the {(SiW9Al3/PDDA)2SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode.

In order to study the stability of the composite {(SiW9Al3/PDDA)2SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode in electrolyte, it was immersed in electrolyte for seven days, and then was taken out to test its catalytic ability. As shown in Fig. 2, almost the same Rs and Rct were achieved from the EIS. Rct and Rs were 18.14 and 22.37 ohm cm−2 for the newly fabricated electrode, and 21.19 and 23.74 ohm cm−2 for the electrode immersed in electrolyte for seven days. The subtle increase in Rct can be ascribed to the detachment of POM anions from electrodes. When the immersed electrode was tested in electrolyte containing I− and I3−, it still showed high conducting and catalytic ability compared with the bare platinized electrode.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the composite {(SiW9Al3/PDDA)2SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode and bare Pt electrode were taken to provide detailed information about the surface morphology and the homogeneity of the deposited film. After modification, bigger nanoparticles are formed on the surface of bare Pt electrode, as seen in Fig. 3. It was also noticed that there are a few big blocks on the surface of the film that were considered as crystals of excess SiW9Al3 from the solution.
 Fig. 3  
AFM of bare and modified electrodes. The left ones correspond to bare Pt electrodes and the right ones correspond to the modified electrodes. 
We also used CV to verify the EIS results. To investigate the catalytic ability of modified electrode, two kinds of electrolyte were adopted: one is a single-electron transfer media (Fe2+/Fe3+) and the other is a two-electron transfer media (I−/I3−). Fig. 4a shows the CV results obtained from the modified and bare Pt electrodes in K3Fe(CN)6 aqueous. As documented in the previous literature,14–16 the value of peak separation (ΔEp) is related to the electron transfer rate, with a higher electron transfer rate being associated with lower ΔEp value. The ΔEp is 223 mV for modified electrode and 246 mV for bare Pt electrode. The results indicated that the electron transfer rate of modified electrode is higher than that of bare Pt electrode. Moreover, POM-modified electrode has higher exchange current density. Electrolyte containing LiI and I2 was also taken to simulate a real DSSC's inner conditions (Fig. 4b). In this case, modified electrodes also showed higher current density and lower ΔEp. According to the literature,17,13 two couples of peaks can be attributed to redox of I− to I3− (the left couple) and I3− to I2 (the right couple). Eqn (2) and (3) showed the above reactions. Modified electrodes showed higher current density than the bare Pt electrodes. The ΔEp in the left peaks were 481mV and 537mV for modified and bare Pt electrodes respectively. The results of CVs are coincident with those of EIS, namely modified electrode has better electrocatalytic ability than bare Pt electrode.  3 I− ↔ I3− + 2e−(2) 2 I3− ↔ 3I2 + 2e−(3)

The cell performance of the DSSCs was measured using simulated sunlight (AM = 1.5, see the ESI†). To assess the reproducibility of the DSSCs with POM-modified counter electrode, a series of parallel experiments were carried out and the results are listed in table S1 and Fig. S3 (see the ESI†). The data demonstrate the reproducibility of the cells is very good, and hence an average of these results and the standard deviation (Std) derived from averaging the data for three cells are reported in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows the characteristic of DSSC fabricated using three-layer-modified {(SiW9Al3/PDDA)2SiW9Al3}/Pt counter electrode. Under illumination, the DSSC with POM-modified counter electrode exhibited Jsc of 18.5 mA cm−2, Voc of 595 mV and fill factor (FF) of 0.615, and η of 6.76%. For the DSSC with bare Pt counter electrode, the values of Jsc, Voc, FF and η were 16.1, 564, 0.62 and 5.62%, respectively. It can be seen that the Jsc of DSSCs that used a POM-modified counter electrode was increased by 14.9% and the η was increased by 20.3%, compared with DSSCs that used a platinized FTO. However, for the lower FF, we could not at present give a logical interpretation. One possible reason is that POM anions enhance dark current as indicated by the result of open-circuit voltage decay experiment. As shown in Fig. S4 (see ESI†), the DSSCs that used a POM-modified counter electrode showed faster decrease in Voc which is related to the lifetime of electrons in DSSCs18 We also calculated the lifetime of the electrons by eqn (4)18 as follows:  τn = − kBT/e(dVoc/dt)−1(4)τn, kB, T, and e represent lifetime, Boltzmann constant, temperature and charge of electrons, respectively.

 Fig. 5  Current–Voltage curves for DSSCs with bare Pt counter electrode and POM-modified counter electrode. 
As shown by the inset in Fig. S4,† the electron lifetimes in DSSCs with POM-modified electrode as counter electrode are slightly shorter than those with bare Pt electrode as counter electrode, and that also explain why FF values are lower than that of bare Pt electrode. In addition, it is possible that big POM crystal blocks on the surface of the counter electrode affect the FF of the cell.
In order to detect the performance of the cells under different wavelengths light, we carried out incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) experiment of DSSCs using different counter electrodes. As depicted in Fig. 6, compared with the DSSCs with bare Pt electrode as counter electrode, the DSSCs using POM-modified electrode exhibit higher power conversion efficiency under light wavelengths in the range 400–800 nm.

In summary, we have successfully fabricated POM-based multilayer modified Pt counter electrodes by electrochemical deposition method. The results of CV and EIS show that, in comparison with bare Pt electrodes, the introduction of POM improved the performance of the counter electrode as supported by low ΔEp, small charge transfer resistance, low series resistance and long-term stability. DSSCs that used the composite counter electrode showed higher photo-electricity efficiency, higher short current density as well as open circuit voltage. Because the POM-modified Pt counter electrodes reported herein are easy to handle, easy to prepare, they might be widely used in DSSCs. More importantly, the present work takes the first step for using POMs as potential substitutes for Pt to fabricate a low-cost, long-term stability and high catalytic activity counter electrode. Further studies in this line are in process.
