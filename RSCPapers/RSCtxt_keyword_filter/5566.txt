Here, a series of self-powered photodetectors with adjustable spectral responses were fabricated like building blocks by reassembling and disassembling ZnO/perovskite (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) heterojunctions. They exhibit good responsivity (∼3 mA W−1) and fast response speed (∼100 μs) at 0 V operating voltage. In addition, a self-powered photodetector (ZnO/MAPbI3) was used as a representative to investigate its practical imaging ability, and a high-fidelity image was obtained. This work provides an effective method and idea for building future multifunctional pluggable photoelectric devices with limited material building blocks.
Introduction
Photodetectors with the ability to convert incoming photons into electrical signals are core elements for imaging and optical communication systems.1–4 Most of the commercially available photodetectors heavily rely on traditional inorganic semiconductors, such as GaN, InGaAs, Si, etc., which suffer from high manufacturing costs, strict fabrication environments and complex device structures.5–8 Solution-processed semiconductors, including hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites and organic semiconductors, have been widely exploited as a costly alternative to inorganic semiconductors in photodetection applications due to their many intrinsic advantages.9,10 Among them, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have achieved great success in photovoltaic solar cells, yielding an exciting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% within only ten years of development,11 which benefits from their superior optoelectronic features, including strong light absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, low exciton-binding energy and long carrier diffusion length.12–18 They have been widely applied to fabricate photodetectors, achieving high sensitivity and fast response.19 Currently, most photodetectors usually require the application of an external bias voltage to prevent the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which not only increases equipment size and energy consumption but also limits the long-term application of detectors in unmanned hazardous environments or harsh atmospheres.20–22 Thus, building self-powered photodetectors without any power supply is being widely studied, which meets the demands of next-generation portable and wearable devices.23–27 So far, self-powered photodetectors have been realized based on the photovoltaic effect with a pn junction, Schottky junction, and heterojunction structure, respectively.28–31 Among them, pn junction and heterojunction photodetectors have received wide attention due to the higher built-in electric field, which can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs.32,33 Compared with pn homojunction photodetectors, heterojunction photodetectors provide more options and possibilities for the preparation of photodetectors because they can be matched with various semiconductor materials.34,35 And their performance was greatly affected by the interface between two semiconductor layers, which suffers from the crystal structure, carriers’ transport, energy band, etc.32 In general, high vacuum, high temperature fabrication processes and complicated device structures are inevitable.36–38 Hence, it is desirable to fabricate heterojunction photodetectors with different functions without the limit of lattice matching and processing compatibility.
Here, a series of self-powered heterojunction photodetectors were assembled using a simple building block method. The heterojunction photodetector can be fully disassembled into individual building blocks, which can be further assembled into novel heterojunction photodetectors with different functions. Reconfigurable heterojunction photodetectors are fundamentally different from conventional photodetectors, which are firmly bonded (either ionic or covalently) once constructed, and the device function is fixed after fabrication. These self-powered photodetectors were obtained by assembling the heterojunction using ZnO microwires (MWs) and perovskite layer MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3, X = Cl, Br, I). In particular, self-powered ZnO MW/perovskite photodetectors exhibit an adjustable spectral response with a responsivity of ∼3 mA W−1 and a fast response speed (∼100 μs). In addition, a high-fidelity image has been obtained by using the ZnO MW/MAPbI3 photodetector as the sensing pixel of the imaging system. Our results demonstrate the possibility of re-stacking building blocks of different materials with reconfigurable capabilities. These proof-of-concept devices can also inspire reverse engineering concepts for disassembling heterojunction photodetectors, or reassembling heterojunction photodetectors in parallel with state-of-the-art heterojunction photodetectors, providing multifunctionality with limited material building blocks and the richness of pluggable optoelectronics.
Results and discussion
The schematic in Fig. S1 (ESI†) illustrates the fabrication process of the ZnO MW/perovskite heterojunction photodetector. First, ZnO MWs were synthesized by a CVD method. Then, organic–inorganic MAPbX3 perovskite films were spin-coated on a sapphire substrate, respectively. Finally, a series of heterojunctions were obtained by a simple physical assembling and disassembling process using ZnO MWs and perovskite films (detailed experimental procedures are in the Experimental section). The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the ZnO MW and perovskite film can be tightly bonded together. Before fabricating heterojunction devices, the morphology and optical properties of ZnO MWs were characterized (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the SEM image of ZnO MWs, and its cross-sectional image is shown in the inset. It can be observed that the vertical size of the microwires is ≈10 μm and they have a smooth surface, which is conducive to closer contact with the perovskite film. As shown in the absorption spectra of the ZnO MW (Fig. S2b, ESI†), its absorption edge is located at ≈370 nm and the corresponding optical band gap is calculated to be 3.3 eV. To investigate the spatial distribution of Zn and O elements in ZnO MWs, the corresponding elemental mapping distributions are shown in Fig. S2c and d (ESI†). It can be observed that the distribution of Zn and O is relatively uniform in the ZnO MW, indicating good crystalline quality. Fig. S3a–c (ESI†) show the SEM images of the MAPbCl3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 film crystallized on the sapphire substrates, respectively. All perovskite films exhibit uniform film-forming characteristics, have good coverage on the substrate and are composed of a large number of closely packed particles with a grain size of 0.1–0.5 μm, which is conducive to light absorption and carrier transport. The structural characterization of the MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 films was assessed by XRD (Fig. S3d, ESI†). The MAPbI3 film has been confirmed to have a well-crystallized tetragonal structure, while the MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 films are in the cubic phase. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbCl3 perovskite films were recorded to evaluate their optical properties (Fig. S3e, ESI†). The spectra indicate that the absorption edges of the MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 films are located at ≈780 nm, 540 nm and 430 nm, respectively. All absorption spectra show a sharp band edge cutoff with no absorption tails, indicating that the perovskite films have a low defect state concentration.

Fig. 1a shows the standard assembling and disassembling process of ZnO MW/perovskite heterojunction photodetectors like building blocks. First, a single ZnO MW is mechanically stripped (≈3 mm length) (Fig. 1b). Next, the ZnO MW is dry transferred onto the top of the MAPbCl3 film, which forms the initial assembly process of ZnO/MAPbCl3 heterojunctions, as shown in Fig. 1c. Here, the relatively flat perovskite films and high crystalline quality of ZnO MW are the keys to ensuring a close contact between the materials. Moreover, the construction of heterojunctions using physical contact methods is crucial in the subsequent disassembly process. After that, the assembled ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 heterojunction was mechanically disassembled (Fig. 1d). It is worth noting that the MAPbCl3 film after disassembly of the ZnO MW was not destroyed (Fig. 1d inset). The assembly and disassembly processes used here are dry transfer engineering and do not involve any contamination and residues.39

Benefiting from the undisturbed surface, the disassembled ZnO MWs can be further used as individual building blocks combined with other materials to form new heterojunctions. As shown in Fig. 1e, a fresh MAPbBr3 film could be integrated with the ZnO MW to form a ZnO MW/MAPbBr3 heterojunction, and then method described before is used to mechanically disassemble again (Fig. 1f). Finally, the ZnO MW/MAPbI3 heterojunction was constructed by combining this ZnO MW with MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 1g. The disassembly and reassembly processes are very reliable and do not destroy the original state of the two materials (Fig. 1h). As shown in Fig. 1i, the ZnO MW still maintains a fresh surface state after three repeated cycles. Here, the same ZnO MW combined with different perovskite films is used to construct different heterojunction photodetectors through the physical method of reassembly and disassembly to realize the self-powered photodetection performance.
In order to study the optoelectronic characteristics of the ZnO MW/perovskite heterojunction, the photodetectors based on ZnO MW/MAPbCl3, ZnO MW/MAPbBr3, and ZnO MW/MAPbI3 were fabricated. The schematic illustration of the ZnO MW/perovskite photodetector is shown in Fig. 2a. In the fabrication process of heterojunction devices, to realize excellent photovoltaic performance, the formation of Ohmic contact between metal electrodes and semiconductor is a key factor.40 The contact behavior between the indium electrode and the ZnO MW (perovskite films) in the dark was tested by I–V measurements (Fig. S4, ESI†). The I–V curve of the ZnO MW metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) structure photodetector with indium electrodes is shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). The linear I–V curve indicates that indium electrodes and the ZnO MW form Ohmic contact. Similarly, Fig. S4b–d (ESI†) show the I–V curve of the perovskite film MSM structure photodetector with indium electrode. The linear I–V curves indicate that Ohmic contact was formed between indium electrodes and perovskite films. Fig. 2b–d present the I–V curves of the ZnO MW/MAPbCl3, ZnO MW/MAPbBr3 and ZnO MW/MAPbI3 photodetectors under dark and illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), respectively. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the linear I–V curves of these three heterojunction devices, and the curves show that the devices have an obvious photovoltaic effect near 0 V under illumination. Due to the formation of good ohmic contacts (indium–ZnO MW–indium and indium–perovskite film–indium), the apparent rectifying properties can be attributed to the photovoltaic effect of the heterojunction formed between the ZnO MW and perovskite films. The Ilight/Idark under 0 V is calculated to be 1.6 × 103 (ZnO/MAPbCl3), 3.7 × 103 (ZnO/MAPbBr3) and 2.5 × 103 (ZnO/MAPbI3), respectively. Therefore, the ZnO MW/perovskite heterojunction photodetectors can be operated in self-powered mode.

As a basic parameter for assessing the performance of photodetectors, the responsivity (R) indicates the efficiency of a photodetector responding to an optical signal and is defined by the following formula: R = Ip/PLight (A W−1)(1)where Ip is the photocurrent and Plight is the incident light intensity. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, the three ZnO MW/perovskite photodetectors with a tunable spectral response at 0 V are realized by changing the composition of the halogen element in the perovskite layer. Fig. 3a shows the responsivity spectra of the initially assembled ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 photodetector at 0 V. It shows a spectral-response range from 300 nm to 430 nm, and the responsivity is about 2.78 mA W−1 at 410 nm. The ZnO MW/MAPbBr3 photodetector responsivity spectrum is shown in Fig. 3b. The spectral-response range is from 300 nm to 560 nm at 0 V, and its responsivity is 3.53 mA W−1 at 500 nm. The ZnO MW/MAPbI3 photodetector shows a broad spectral-response from 300 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 3c), and its responsivity is 3.39 mA W−1 at 680 nm. The spectral responsivities are mainly determined by the absorption characteristics of the perovskite, and the cut-off response wavelength of three heterojunction photodetectors is located at 430 nm, 560 nm and 780 nm, respectively, corresponding to the absorption spectra of the perovskite films (Fig. S3e, ESI†). By simply changing the composition of the halide in the perovskite, and using a simple dry transfer preparation method, a series of self-powered photodetectors with a tunable spectral response from ultraviolet, visible to near-infrared is realized. Detectivity (D*) is also a key parameter in defining the performances of self-powered photodetectors. D* reflects the detection capability of the photodetector to weak light which can be calculated with the following equation1,41 (2)where R is the responsivity of the photodetector, S is the effective area, and Idark is the dark current. Therefore, the D* values of the self-powered photodetector are calculated and shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Owing to the low dark current, the D* values are as high as 9.7 × 1010 Jones (ZnO/MAPbCl3, 410 nm), 1.3 × 1011 Jones (ZnO/MAPbBr3, 500 nm), and 1.6 × 1011 Jones (ZnO/MAPbI3, 680 nm), respectively, suggesting the great potential for detecting weak light. The response spectra of the three heterojunction photodetectors with different bias voltages are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). As the bias voltage increases, their responsivity increases almost linearly due to the direct dependence of the extraction efficiency of photogenerated carriers with bias voltages.

In order to illustrate the working mechanism of the heterojunction photodetector, taking the ZnO MW/MAPbI3 heterojunction as an example, its energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 3d and e. A pn heterojunction is formed at the interface of the ZnO MW and MAPbI3 film. Due to the difference in the Fermi level, once p-MAPbI3 and n-ZnO come in contact, the electrons in the ZnO will move toward MAPbI3, and the holes in MAPbI3 will move toward ZnO. Therefore, the energy level near the surface of the MAPbI3 will bend downward, and the energy level near the surface of the ZnO will bend upward (Fig. 3d). Thus, a built-in electric field is formed at the interface between p-MAPbI3 and n-ZnO MW. Under illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes quickly separate under the action of the built-in electric field, and then move toward the ZnO and the MAPbI3, respectively (Fig. 3e). Hence, a self-powered heterojunction photodetector will be achieved.
The photoresponse reproducibility of the photodetector is an important parameter to characterize the performance of a photodetector. Fig. 4a–c show the photocurrent response curves of the three heterojunction photodetectors based on ZnO MW/MAPbCl3, ZnO MW/MAPbBr3 and ZnO MW/MAPbI3 heterojunctions under illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at 0 V. The photodetectors can generate periodically changing currents when the light is applied and removed, indicating that the three devices have remarkable reproducibility and stability. The photocurrent of the three devices increased rapidly and reached a steady state when they were illuminated, and there was no obvious photocurrent decay, indicating fast electron–hole separation at the heterojunction. When illumination is removed, the current decreases rapidly, demonstrating the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes quickly. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the I–t curves of the heterojunction device and the perovskite device under 5 V bias. It can be observed that the currents change periodically with high repeatability and the on/off ratios of the heterojunction devices are all higher than those of the individual perovskite devices. Hence, the performance of photodetectors is effectively improved by the simple physical stacking method.

The response speed determines the detector's ability to track fast-changing optical signals, and is another important parameter for evaluating the photoresponse characteristics of photodetectors. To measure the accurate response time of a heterojunction device, a transient photoresponse measurement system was built. A pulsed laser (355 nm/532 nm) with a pulse width of 5 ns and a laser power of 2 mW was used as the light source, and the voltage of the series resistor as a function of time is recorded using a high-resolution oscilloscope. The photoresponse time is defined as the time required to increase from 10% to 90% of the maximum photocurrent (rise time, τr) and decrease from 90% to 10% of the maximum photocurrent (decay time, τd). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), all transient photoresponses of the three heterojunction photodetectors under 0 V are extremely stable, reproducible and fast. This indicates that the three photodetectors can work even under strong irradiation conditions and maintain excellent performance. According to the single period transient photoresponse of the ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 (355 nm laser), ZnO/MAPbBr3 and ZnO MW/MAPbI3 (532 nm laser) depicted at 0 V (Fig. 4d–f), the τr and τd of the ZnO MW/MAPbCl3, ZnO/MAPbBr3 and ZnO MW/MAPbI3 heterojunction photodetector under the pulse laser are estimated to be 7 μs/340 μs (Fig. 4d), 6 μs/358 μs (Fig. 4e) and 6 μs/414 μs (Fig. 4f), respectively. All heterojunction photodetectors exhibit fast response speed. It is shown that the as-prepared self-powered photodetector can track rapidly changing optical signals. The three self-powered photodetectors have basically the same response speed, which provides a good opportunity to develop multifunctional pluggable photodetectors. The responsivity and response speed of this self-powered photodetector are comparable to or superior than those of previously reported self-powered photodetectors, as compared in Table 1.

To verify the highly reconfigurable ability of self-powered photodetectors, the disassembled ZnO MWs were reassembled with MAPbCl3 films again. Fig. S10a (ESI†) shows the responsivity spectra of the reassembled ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 heterojunction detector. It is observed that the spectral response range of the device after the second reassembly is still 300 nm to 430 nm, and the responsivity is about 2.56 mA W−1 at 410 nm at 0 V. As shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†), the ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 heterojunction photodetector assembled for the second time can still generate a periodically changing current when light is applied and removed, and there is no obvious photocurrent decay as well. Fig. S10c (ESI†) shows that the second reassembled ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 photodetector under 0 V is also extremely stable, reproducible and provides fast responses, and the τr and τd of the ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 heterojunction photodetector are estimated to be 7 μs/386 μs (Fig. S10d, ESI†). The above results show that the performance of the second reassembled ZnO MW/MAPbCl3 heterojunction photodetector is basically the same as that of the initial assembly. It is further demonstrated that the fabricated reconfigurable heterojunction photodetector by this method is highly reliable.
To investigate the imaging ability of the heterojunction photodetector at 0 V, an imaging system using ZnO MW/MAPbI3 photodetectors as sensing pixels was constructed, as shown in Fig. 5a. An object with a hollow heart pattern was made on black cardboard to serve as an object for the imaging system. The object was fixed on a computer-controlled X–Y translation stage so that the object could move continuously and stably in both horizontal and vertical directions. Using an 808 nm laser (50 mW) as the light source, along with the movement of the translation stage, the photocurrent generated by the photodetector is extracted using a lock-in amplifier, and recorded together with the position coordinates of the object by a computer. Then, a 51 × 53 pixels’ image was obtained by converting the output current signal to “gray code” (Fig. 5b). The image exhibits high fidelity properties, and shows a clear boundary and is highly consistent with the shape of the target object (Fig. S11, ESI†). These results demonstrate that the self-powered heterojunction photodetector can meet the requirements of further intelligent imaging systems without any external power supply.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of self-powered photodetectors with tunable broadband responses based on ZnO MW/perovskite heterojunctions are realized by a simple physical stacking method. The prepared reconfigurable self-powered photodetectors have obvious rectification characteristics and can work normally without any external power supply. By changing the halogen element, the prepared self-powered photodetectors show a tunable spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared with a fast response speed (∼100 μs). More importantly, high-fidelity images can be obtained without any power supply using the self-powered photodetector as the sensing pixels of the imaging system. In general, our work provides a simple method and idea for the development and preparation of self-powered photodetectors with a tunable spectral response.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%), lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%), methylammonium iodide (MAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr) and methylammonium chlorine (MACl) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. γ-butyrolactone (GBL, anhydrous, ≥99.8%) was obtained from Tci. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.8%), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.5%) and N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, anhydrous, ≥99.8%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Zinc oxide powder (ZnO, 99%) and C powder (99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of perovskite films
The cleaned c-plane sapphire substrate was treated with UV ozone for 15 min. PbI2 and MAI (equimolar) were dissolved in GBL to form a precursor solution (1 M), 1.2 M MAPbBr3 solution was prepared by dissolving PbBr2 and MABr (equimolar) in DMF and DMSO (7:3, v/v), and 0.6 M MAPbCl3 solution was prepared by dissolving PbCl2 and MACl (equimolar) in DMSO. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto sapphire substrates (4500 rpm, 30 s). After spin-coating for 15 s, 70 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate. Then, the substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
ZnO microwire (MW) preparation
The ZnO MW was synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. To prepare ZnO MWs, ZnO powder and C powder (mixture, molar ratio of 1:1) were placed as source materials in the center of a ceramic boat of the quartz tube. A fixed silicon substrate covered with ZnO seeds on top of a ceramic boat is used to collect the product. The growth temperature was maintained at 1000 °C for 60 min. During the growth process, 96% Ar + 4% O2 was used as the carrier gas, and the pressure in the tube was 180 Torr. After the growth, the furnace was cooled to room temperature and the white ZnO MWs were collected.
Photodetector fabrication
To fabricate the photodetector, part of the spin-coated perovskite film was wiped off to expose the blank sapphire substrate, and then a single ZnO MW was selected and transferred to the prepared substrate. One side was in contact with the sapphire substrate, and the other side was in contact with the perovskite film. One side of the ZnO MW was fixed on a blank sapphire substrate using indium as electrodes, and the indium electrode on the other side directly contacts the perovskite film and does not touch the ZnO MW. Through a simple physical stacking method, a series of ZnO MW/perovskite self-powered photodetectors were prepared.
Characterization
The image morphology of the device was obtained by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU70). An X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, D/max-2600/pc) was used for the structural characterization of the sample. The optical absorption spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. Zolix DR800-CUST was utilized to analyze the photoresponse characteristic of the photodetectors (PD) at room temperature (RT). A Keithley 2400 source meter and a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator were used to study the I–V and I–t characteristics. The response time of the photodetector at 0 V was measured using a Tektronix MDO34 oscilloscope and pulsed lasers at 355 nm and 532 nm. A laser-driven light source is used as the light source in the imaging system. All performance measurements of the photodetectors are performed under ambient air conditions at room temperature in the range of 18 °C to 22 °C with a humidity of 35–40%, and no encapsulation was performed.
