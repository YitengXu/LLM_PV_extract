    , Accepted 1st April 2015First published on 2nd April 2015AbstractWe have developed a facile synthetic route to a ladder-type donor unit (SDCT) wherein two outer thiophene subunits are covalently fastened to the central dibenzothiophene core through two sp3-hybridized bridging carbons. An innovative transformation from an aryl ketone group to an aryl ester group was applied to construct the ladder-type molecular skeleton, and the overall synthetic yield toward the donor unit has been significantly improved by choosing aryl side chains instead of aliphatic ones to avoid competing dehydration reactions. To reveal the effects of π-spacers and heteroatom substituents, three donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers containing SDCT and acceptor units of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (BO), or 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) were synthesized, characterized and used for polymer solar cells (PSCs). All polymers exhibit blue-shifted absorption spectra and deeper-lying HOMO energy levels compared to the previous carbazole-based skeleton analogues. In comparison with its analogous polymer with the same π-conjugated backbone, the polymer with alkoxy-substituted BT as the acceptor unit (PSBT) shows an order of magnitude higher OFET mobility (1.8 × 10−4versus 1.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). An optimal device based on PSBT:PC71BM (1/3 in wt%) delivers a respectable PCE of 5.18% and a high Voc of 0.94 V, all of which are superior to those of the carbazole-based analogue (PCE = 3.7%, Voc = 0.80 V) and greatly surpass the values of a previously reported dibenzothiophene-based polymer (PCE = 0.76%, Voc = 0.64 V). These results demonstrate that SDCT is a promising building block for constructing photovoltaic polymers and the synthetic strategy developed herein can be used to prepare other dibenzothiophene-cored ladder-type heptacyclic units.
Introduction
Light weight, mechanical flexibility, large-area compatibility, earth-abundant constituents, and cost-effective solution processing of polymer solar cells (PSCs) have triggered increasing research efforts in new material innovation,1 novel device architectures,2 interfacial engineering,3 and morphology control.4 Among the aforementioned efforts to improve the performance of PSCs, the active-layer material innovation, especially p-type conjugated copolymers, is vital for efficient PSCs.5 Typically, benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymers have contributed to single-junction PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10%,6 which significantly outperform those of other thoroughly investigated polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT.7 To explore novel p-type polymer materials toward an enhancement in PCE, the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach which alternates electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties along the polymer backbone is one of the most successful and universal strategies, because it enables tunable absorption spectra and tailored frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting polymers through meticulously screening different donor segments as well as various acceptor units. Although integrating the existing building blocks into new copolymers is an effective method to synthesize new materials, exploring novel structural units to construct high performance polymers is even desirable from the viewpoint of molecular design.
Poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) is an excellent example of polymers based on N-alkyl-2,7-carbazole, and PCDTBT has been used as an active layer material in more than 250 publications.8 However, the number of carbazole-derived high-performance polymers for PSCs is relatively limited.9 Ladder-type building blocks with multi-ring-fused structures are promising donor constituents for photovotaic copolymers, because the planar multi-ring-fused aromatics can facilitate π-electron delocalization and elongate effective π-conjugation that is favorable for bandgap reduction.10 At the same time, the planar aromatics tend to pack closely in the solid state through strong intermolecular π–π stacking, endowing the film with good charge transport property. Previously, we synthesized a copolymer based on a ladder-type heptacyclic unit which is derived from a carbazole (PHHA-BT in Scheme 1).11 When its analogous polymer (PCDCTBT-C8, Scheme 2) was used for PSCs, a moderate PCE had been achieved.12 On the other hand, it is known that bridging atoms also play key roles in determining the final photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers.13 Subsequently, we developed another series of copolymers based on a ladder-type heteroheptacene which is derived from dibenzothiophene (such as PSBT-H in Scheme 1),14 wherein the N-atom of carbazole in PHHA-BT was solely replaced by the S-atom. Unfortunately, the key two-step cyclization reaction occurred with a low yield of 13%, leading to an overall yield of only 9% from the starting material of 3,7-dibromodibenzo[b,d]thiophene to the brominated heptacyclic donor unit. Moreover, although a PCE of 4.17% was eventually achieved based on a “donor–donor” conjugated copolymer that incorporates bithiophene as the other repeat unit, the D–A copolymer using benzothiadiazole as an acceptor unit only delivered a relatively low PCE of 0.69%.14

In order to improve the reaction yield of the two-step alcoholization/annulation cyclization, in this report we circumvent the utilization of alkyl side chains that would lead to olefine by-products via a competing dehydration reaction of the intermediate tertiary alcohol.12 Alternatively, 4-hexylphenyl groups are applied as the solubilizing side-chain sources.15 Consequently, the two-step cyclization procedure proceeded smoothly in 60% yield (Scheme 3), and the overall yield from the starting material of 3,7-dibromodibenzo[b,d]thiophene to the brominated heptacyclic donor unit is improved from 9% to 35%. Therefore, adequate brominated donor molecules can be easily produced, followed by one more step of the reaction to efficiently afford the distannyl monomer. Subsequently, the distannyl donor monomer can be copolymerized with various halogenated acceptor moieties.16 It is worth noting that the rigid and planar ladder-type backbones are usually obtained through an ester functional group mediated two-step alcoholization/annulation procedure besides the complicated three-step acylation/reduction/alkylation sequence.12,17 However, it is synthetically challenging to directly attach ester groups to the desirable positions on an aromatic moiety. To solve this problem, we conceived an indirect precursor solution, namely, converting aromatic methyl ketones into formic acids via aq. NaClO mediated haloform reactions. As for the acceptor unit, the classic building block of 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) was chosen. The insertion of two additional thiophene rings between the BT unit and the donor unit usually serves to relieve the torsional disorder along the polymer backbone, which is favorable for the conjugation extension. However, due to the electron-rich nature of thiophene, it will result in an undesirable reduction in the ionization potential of the polymer and therefore the open-circuit voltage (Voc).18 Thus the single BT acceptor motif without the flanking thiophenes is more promising in terms of a high Voc. In addition, 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (BO) obtained by replacing the sulfur atom in the BT unit with an oxygen atom is favorable for reducing the HOMO level of the resulting polymer in some cases.19 Therefore, the polymer using BO as the acceptor unit is also prepared for a comparison purpose. As such, three dibenzothiophene-based polymers, i.e., PSDTBT, PSBT and PSBO (Scheme 1), are synthesized and tested for PSCs. Finally, optimal devices based on PSBT exhibit a PCE of 5.08% with a high Voc of 0.94 V, all of which are superior to those of the carbazole- or fluorene-derived photovoltaic polymers (PCDCTBT and PFDCTBT, Scheme 2) which have similar backbone units.20 Moreover, the values of PCEs and Vocs obtained herein are far more than those of the previous work (PCEmax = 0.76%, Voc = 0.64 V) based on the ideal polymer skeleton (PSBT-H, in Scheme 1).14 These results highlight that the new ladder-type dibenzothiophene-cored multi-fused heptacyclic unit (SDCT) is a promising building block for high-performance polymers, and the synthetic procedure developed herein is an effective strategy to prepare SDCT and its derivatives. At the same time, the methyl ketone groups are first used as precursors of ester moieties to construct ladder-type multi-fused polycyclic units.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
To guarantee adequate solubility of the resulting polymers, alkoxy BT/BO acceptor moieties were applied, and the 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(decyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT-OC10), 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(hexyloxy)-2,1,3-benzothiadi-azole (BT-OC6) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (BO-OC8) units with different side chains were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures.21 The synthetic routes of the distannyl donor monomer and the three copolymers are depicted in Scheme 3, and the detailed experimental procedures are given in the Experimental section. Starting from 3,7-dibromodibenzo[b,d]-thiophene (1), double Friedel–Crafts acylation using acetyl chloride with the aid of AlCl3 in carbon disulfide yielded compound 2. NaClO (bleach) mediated haloform reaction of the methyl ketone groups in compound 2 proceeded smoothly to furnish an intermediate of diacid in a high yield of 98%, which was followed by reacting with oxalyl chloride to afford diacid chlorides and then subjected to react with methanol to obtain a diester (3). Stille coupling reaction between 3 and 2-thiopheneboronic acid was performed in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 with aq. K2CO3/THF as the solvent to afford compound 4 with a yield of 85%. Subsequently, nucleophilic attacks at the carbonyl site of compound 4 by freshly prepared (4-hexylphenyl)lithium produced a crude diol (5), which underwent cyclization with boron trifluoride–etherate to give the key heptacyclic arene (SDCT) in 60% overall yield. Finally, SDCT was converted to a dibrominated intermediate (Br-SDCT) which was efficiently lithiated by t-butyllithium and then followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to accomplish the donor monomer (Sn-SDCT) synthesis. Three D–A copolymers (PSBT, PSBO and PSDTBT) were generated by Stille coupling between the Sn-SDCT donor monomer and BT-OC6, BO-OC8, and DTBT-OC10 acceptor monomers, respectively. All polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone and hexane eluents successively to remove oligomers and the residual catalyst. The purified polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene and dichlorobenzene. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results show that the number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of PSBT, PSBO, and PSDTBT are 7.6 kDa (PDI = 1.3), 7.7 kDa (PDI = 1.8), and 5.3 kDa (PDI = 1.7), respectively (Table 1). The relatively low molecular weights observed for these polymers may be related to the great steric hindrance posed by the bulky aryl side chains in the donor unit and long alkyl chains in the acceptor units, which would restrain close molecular collisions during the chain propagation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen suggests that all polymers are favorably stable for PSCs with the 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 315, 309 and 320 °C for PSBT, PSBO and PSDTBT, respectively (Fig. 1). X-ray diffraction measurements for the pristine thin films of these copolymers reveal no peak signal between 2θ = 2.5° and 20° which indicates their amorphous features (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in dilute CB solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. Both in solution and in the solid state, two main absorption bands are observed which is typical for D–A copolymers. The lower energy absorbance comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units, while the shorter wavelength band is attributed to π–π* transition of the heteroheptacene. Compared to the absorption spectra in solution, three copolymers show nearly unchanged π–π* transition bands in the solid state. While the ICT profiles of PSDTBT shift toward longer wavelengths from solution to the solid state, the absorption maxima of ICT bands in the film spectra of PSBT and PSBO, however, exhibit blue-shifts of 5 and 19 nm, respectively, compared to those in solution. It may be attributed to the steric hindrance between the pendent phenyl rings on the SDCT unit and the side chains on the BT/BO unit that may dilute strong intermolecular π–π interactions.22 The absorption maxima of PSBT and PSBO in solution at longer wavelength regions indicate that the acceptor strength of BO is stronger than that of BT. Compared to PSBT, PSDTBT with two flanking thiophene rings in the acceptor unit shows a red-shifted π–π* transition band due to the longer conjugated length. However, this modification also leads to a blue-shift of the ICT band due to the weaker donor–acceptor interactions. Optical bandgaps (Eoptg) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra were determined to be 1.81 eV for PSBT and 1.82 eV for both of PSBO and PSDTBT. In comparison with their carbazole-based skeleton analogues (Scheme 2),12,20 PSBT and PSDTBT possess more blue-shifted absorption spectra and larger bandgaps due to the declining electron-donating strength of the donor unit by replacing the N-atom in the carbazole core with S-atom in the dibenzothiophene core.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to probe the electrochemical behaviors of these copolymers in thin film. CV measurements were conducted in a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, using a Pt disk coated with the polymer film, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in anhydrous acetonitrile) as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The polymers were deposited onto the working electrode from a 3 mg mL−1 chloroform solution and dried under ambience prior to the measurements. Onset oxidation potentials of these three polymers deduced from the CV curves were found to be 0.54, 0.62 and 0.52 V for PSBT, PSBO and PSDTBT, respectively (Fig. 3). The onset oxidation potential (Eox1/2) of ferrocene was −0.06 V versus the Ag/Ag+ electrode under the same conditions. With an assumption that the redox potential of Fe/Fe+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV relative to vacuum,23 the HOMO energy levels for PSBT, PSBO and PSDTBT were calculated to be −5.40, −5.48 and −5.38 eV, respectively (Table 1). These HOMO energy levels are within an ideal range to ensure good air-stability and are deeper-lying than those of their carbazole-cored analogues (Scheme 2).12,20 Therefore, larger attainable Vocs in the final devices are expected because the Voc of a PSC is proportional to the energy offset between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material.24 Compared to PSBT, the HOMO level of PSBO is lowered by 0.08 eV that benefits from the replacement of the BT unit by a stronger electron-withdrawing BO unit in the D–A copolymer. The LUMO energy levels were estimated by extracting the optical bandgaps from the corresponding HOMO levels, i.e. −3.59 eV for PSBT, −3.66 eV for PSBO and −3.56 eV for PSDTBT. These LUMO energy levels are sufficiently higher (>0.3 eV) than the LUMO level of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, ca. −4.30 eV) to overcome the exciton binding energy and thus guarantee an efficient exciton splitting and charge transfer.2c

Charge transport properties
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated with the top-contact and bottom-gate geometry. A heavily n-doped Si wafer with a surface layer of 300 nm SiO2 was employed as the substrate, which was treated by a drop of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in a vacuum oven at 130 °C for 22 h to form a self-assembled monolayer. Semiconductor polymers were spin-coated from their o-DCB/CB (v/v, 1/3) solutions at 800 rpm for 60 s onto the dielectric surface, and top-contact source/drain Au electrodes of about 50 nm thickness were deposited through a shadow mask under a vacuum of ∼1 × 10−4 Pa. The channel width (W) and length (L) were 6.0 mm and 300 μm, respectively. Transistor behavior was observed when applying a negative gate voltages (VGS), indicating that the polymer semiconductors had p-channel characteristics. The mobilities were calculated by plotting I1/2DS with respect to VGS (Fig. S1, ESI†) according to an equation in the saturation regime from the gate sweep:IDS = μCi (W/2L) (VGS − VTH)2where IDS is the drain current; μ is the carrier mobility; Ci is the gate dielectric capacitance per unit area (SiO2, 300 nm, Ci = 11 nF cm−2); W and L are the semiconductor channel width and length, respectively; and VGS and VTH are gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
Hole mobilities of pristine PSBT, PSBO and PSDTBT films deduced from the saturation regime were determined to be (1.8 ± 0.1) × 10−4, (4.6 ± 0.2) × 10−5 and (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Although possessing a slightly lower molecular weight, a comparable value to PSBT has been observed for PSDTBT due to the insertion of two additional thiophene rings in the backbone units. However, the replacement of BT with BO leads to a decrease in the carrier mobility (PSBT vs. PSBO).
Photovoltaic performance
Photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in conventional single-junction PSCs with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al. The polyelectrolyte of poly[6,6,12,12-tetra(2-ethylhexyl)-6,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-2,8-diyl-alt-2,5-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propoxy) benzene-1,4-diyl] (PIFB) is applied as a cathode buffer layer to improve the contact behavior between the active layer and the metal cathode.17b All active layers were spin-coated from a mixed solvent of o-dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene (o-DCB:CB = 1:3, v/v) without any additives. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSCs measured under the AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination are plotted in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The optimized weight ratio of the polymer to PC71BM is 1:3 (Table 2). Through a systematic optimization, PSCs based on PSBT:PC71BM exhibit the best performance with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.11 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 49.6%, and a respectable PCE of 5.18%. In comparison with its carbazole-based analogue of PCDCTBT (Scheme 2, PCE = 3.7%, Voc = 0.80 V),20 PSBT not only exhibits a superior PCE, but also a significantly enlarged Voc. In contrast to polymer PSBT-H which has the same backbone skeleton of PSBT (PCEmax = 0.76% and Voc = 0.64 V),14 the results achieved herein have been considerably improved. The great Voc difference between PSBT and its previous analogue (PSBT-H, Scheme 1) may be related with the more bulky side chains in addition to the cathode discrepancy.25 In other words, it is found that the bulkiness of side chains can exert a significant influence on HOMO energy levels through the effect on molecular conformation/molecular interactions, i.e., more twisted polymer backbones have been shown to achieve lower-lying HOMO levels and therefore a high Voc in devices.25 In this work, PSBT and PSBT-H have the same backbone, but the steric hindrance for PSBT, imposed by the bulkier aryl side chains on the donor unit and additional aliphatic chains on the acceptor unit, would be greater than PSBT-H. Thus, the sterically induced twisting of the polymer backbone disrupts the π-conjugation between the donor and the acceptor moieties. Consequently, the delocalization of electrons from the donor unit to the acceptor unit becomes less favourable which leads to a lower HOMO level and a high Voc.26 The increased Jsc for the PSBT-based device can be attributed to its higher OFET mobility by an order of magnitude compared to the previous analogous polymer (1.8 × 10−4versus 1.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).14

The hole mobility of a polymer is affected by its molecular weight and intermolecular interactions. Comparable molecular weights were determined for PSBT and PSBO. However, in terms of molecular structure, it is not unusual to observe that BT-containing polymers exhibit a higher hole mobility and larger Jsc values in comparison with BO-containing polymers.8b Moreover, the bulkier alkoxy side chains on the BO unit guarantee good solubility of PSBO, but they do not facilitate a good π-stacking. Therefore, the inferior values of hole mobility and Jsc are found for PSBO relative to PSBT. As for PSBT and PSDTBT, a relatively higher molecular weight of PSBT (i.e., long polymer chains) is favorable for defect-free films, improved molecular π–π stacking, and inter-chain overlap between the polymers, all of which contribute to the higher hole mobility and larger Jsc values.27 And it was found that this influence is especially notable for low molecular weight polymers (Mn < 10 kDa).28 On the other hand, from the viewpoint of molecular structures of PSBT and PSDTBT, there should be a tradeoff between the effects of the molecular backbone and side chains. The two additional thiophene units flanking on the BT in the PSDTBT backbone help to relieve the steric hindrance between the neighboring aryl rings. Thus a more planar conjugated backbone would facilitate the chain–chain interactions among polymers. However, the additional thiophene rings usually decrease the solubility of the resulting polymers. In this regard, the longer and bulkier side chains of decyloxy on the BT unit can ensure the solution processability of the polymer, but their greater bulkiness would meanwhile cause unfavorable steric hindrance to keep the polymer chains from a close π–π stacking. Therefore, the superior hole mobility, Jsc and overall PCE of PSBT can be attributed to a good balance between the shorter alkyl side chains on its BT unit (favorable for intermolecular interactions, hole mobility, and Jsc) and the absence of two additional flanking thiophenes (unfavorable for intermolecular interactions, hole mobility, and Jsc, but favorable for Voc).26a,29 These results highlight that the molecular backbone and side chains both exert significant effects on the properties of the polymer as well as the subsequent PSCs, and a subtle balance between solution processability and intermolecular interactions has to be established to obtain efficient PSCs.29a Briefly, it is general that shorter and less bulkier side chains facilitate molecular π–π stacking (ordering) and help to high performance PSCs when the solubility of the polymer and its miscibility with PC71BM are guaranteed.30 Under the same device fabrication conditions, PSCs based on PSBO exhibit an optimal PCE of 3.29%, with Voc = 0.96 V, Jsc = 8.60 mA cm−2 and FF = 40.1%. While PSCs based on PSDTBT exhibit a PCE of 3.52%, with Voc = 0.90 V, Jsc = 9.50 mA cm−2 and FF = 41.3%. The Voc values for devices based on these three polymers pose a declining order: PSBO > PSBT > PSDTBT, which is in agreement with their HOMO energy levels. On the other hand, the largest Jsc observed for PSBT and the smallest Jsc for PSBO are in accordance with their OFET mobilities.
To get more insights into the variations in hole mobility and Jsc, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to probe the surface morphology of the blend films processed under the optimal PSC fabrication conditions. As shown in Fig. 5d, a well-developed interpenetrating network with finely diffused domains with sizes of 10–20 nm is observed for the PSBT-based blend film, which enables a large interfacial area between the polymer donors and fullerene acceptors for efficient exciton dissociation, while providing a continuous percolating path for charge transport to the corresponding electrodes. So it is in accordance with the higher Jsc value of PSBT-based devices. While the phase separation and the domain size of PSDTBT-derived film are relatively not favorable for a high Jsc value of the corresponding device (Fig. 5f). For the film based on PSBO, large and irregular domains beyond an appropriate size are found (Fig. 5e), both of which are not beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. As for the comparison among the height topography images (Fig. 5a–c), a relatively rougher surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.49 nm was found for PSBT-based film (Fig. 5a), as compared to those of 0.34 nm for PSBO (Fig. 5b) and 0.12 nm for PSDTBT (Fig. 5c). The introduction of two additional thiophenes in PSDTBT decreases the sterical hindrance between the donor and the acceptor units, which leads to a smoother surface for the PSDTBT-based film in comparison with the PSBT-based film.

To verify the reliability of the photovoltaic results, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of devices based on these three polymers were measured and the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 4b. The EQE values of PSBT-based device are higher than those of PSDTBT-based device between 500 and 700 nm. PSBO-based device exhibits the lowest EQEs across the range from 300 to 600 nm. The EQE profiles agree well with the measured Jsc results, and errors between the Jsc values (calculated by integrating the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G spectrum) and those obtained from the J–V measurements are all within 3% (Fig. 4b).
Conclusions
We have provided an effective synthetic route to a dibenzothiophene-based ladder-type heptacyclic unit (SDCT), wherein it utilizes aryl ketones as the precursors of ester groups. A series of D–A copolymers incorporating SDCT as the donor unit and BT/BO derivatives as the acceptor units have been synthesized, characterized and applied for PSCs. Finally, a champion device based on PSBT exhibited a respectable PCE of 5.18% and a high Voc of 0.94 V, all of which surpass the values from its carbazole-based analogue (PCE = 3.7%, Voc = 0.80 V). Moreover, in comparison with the PCE of 0.76% and Voc of 0.64 V for the polymer with the same backbone skeleton of PSBT, the photovoltaic performance achieved herein has been considerably improved. These results demonstrate that SDCT is a promising building block to construct D–A polymers for PSCs. Considering that the molecular weight of polymers exerts a significant effect on the device performance, even better results may be expected if PSBT with a larger molecular weight was obtained. Further work is underway to explore novel catalysts and methods for polymerization.

Instruments and measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference, and the peaks are given in ppm relative to TMS. Molecular weights of the polymers were measured using the GPC method with polystyrene standards. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer. TGA measurement was performed on a Netzsch STA449C platform. AFM was conducted in the tapping mode with a Bruker Nanoscale V station. X-ray diffraction patterns of thin films deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/glass substrate were obtained using a Bruker D8 thin film diffractometer.
PSC fabrication and characterization
Devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PIFB/Al were fabricated as follows: indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in sequence, and then dried overnight in an oven. The precleaned substrates were subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 15 min prior to use. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVPAI-4083) was spin-cast onto the precleaned ITO at 3500 rpm for 60 s and then baked at 140 °C for 15 min in air. In a nitrogen-filled glovebox, a solution containing a mixture of polymer/PC71BM at different weight ratios (18 mg mL−1) in a mixed o-DCB:CB (1:3, v/v) solvent was stirred overnight at 50 °C and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter before being spin-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 60 s. Subsequently, a conjugated polyelectrolyte PIFB was introduced as an interlayer. The PIFB layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s from a methanol solution (0.3 mg mL−1, containing 30 eq. of acetic acid). Finally, a layer of aluminum cathode was thermally deposited through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of about 1 × 10−4 Pa. Each sample consists of eight independent devices with a fixed active area of 6 mm2. Device characterization was performed under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell. The current density–voltage curves were tested using a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit. EQE spectra were measured on a Newport EQE measuring system.
