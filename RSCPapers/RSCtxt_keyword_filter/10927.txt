    , Accepted 12th March 2014First published on 14th March 2014AbstractThe “all carbon” organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the homocyclic molecule tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) as a donor and C60 as an acceptor were comprehensively characterized. The optimized planar-mixed heterojunction device with a DBP:C60 mixture ratio of DBP:C60 (1:2) exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 4.47%. To understand why DBP possesses such advantageous characteristics, the correlations of the morphology, molecular stacking, carrier dynamics and performance of DBP:fullerene-based devices have been systematically studied. First, the face-on stacked DBP molecules could enhance both the absorption of light and the charge carrier mobility. Second, DBP:C60 (1:2) thin films with optimized domain sizes and partially interconnected acceptor grains led to the most balanced carrier mobility and the lowest bimolecular recombination in devices. Finally, the DBP molecules were found to stack closely using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements, with a π–π stacking spacing of 4.58 Å, indicating an effective molecular orbital overlap in DBP. The study not only reveals the promising characteristics of DBP as a donor in OSCs but the clear correlations of the thin-film nano-morphology, molecular stacking, carrier mobility and charge recombination found here could also provide insights into the characterization methodology and optimization of the small molecule OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for solar energy-harvesting devices, which have been investigated intensively due to their advantages of low-cost, low energy consumption in fabrication, short energy payback time and mechanical flexibility.1–9 Among these devices, vacuum-deposited small-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) exhibit the predominant advantages of well-defined molecular structures, high-quality purification by thermal gradient sublimation, amenability to large-scale production, better batch-to-batch reproducibility and ready adoption into the successful organic light emission display (OLED) industry; these advantages have been significantly improved recently, due to the incorporation of new donor materials, the sophistication of device structures and improved control of the active-layer morphology.10–16 To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 5–7% have been reported in vacuum-deposited SMOSCs using symmetrical heterocyclic,17–24 asymmetrical heterocyclic25–29 and homocyclic donors.30–36 The latter are the most intriguing class of materials because when they are paired with fullerene C60 or C70 acceptors, the only element, except for hydrogen, in the active layer is carbon. Consequently, a true “all-carbon” photovoltaic device can be realized. Tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) is one of the homocyclic donors that has been used in a SMOSC device to demonstrate the highest efficiency so far.37,38 To understand why DBP possesses such advantageous characteristics, comprehensive ellipsometric analysis, temperature dependent carrier mobility measurements, application of transient photovoltage and photocurrent techniques, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and recombination kinetic modelling are used to investigate the correlations of the morphology, molecular stacking, carrier dynamics and performance of DBP:fullerene-based devices. The nanoscale morphology, degree of crystallinity and molecular packing in the thin films were studied using GIWAXS. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to identify the statistically averaged molecular orientation of DBP in both DBP neat films and DBP:fullerene blend films. Moreover, transient photovoltage and photocurrent techniques, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy, as well as temperature-dependent space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mobility measurements revealed the carrier dynamics in the DBP:fullerene mixtures, such as the carrier lifetime, charge transportation and recombination. The carrier mobility and recombination mechanisms were found to be highly related to the DBP:fullerene nanostructures, which were controlled by the DBP:fullerene composition ratio. Retarded charge recombination, balanced electron and hole mobilities, as well as effortless carrier transportation in an optimized nano-scale morphology all contributed to the high PCE of the fine-tuned DBP:C60 devices.
Results and discussion
Device characterization
The vacuum-deposited planar-mix heterojunction (PMHJ) devices based on DBP as a donor and C60 as an acceptor were fabricated. The active layers of the PMHJ device were composed of a DBP:C60 mixture layer sandwiched between a homogeneous donor and acceptor layer, which provides efficient photon harvesting and exciton dissociation due to the larger donor/acceptor (D/A) interfacial area. The devices were configured as glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MoO3 (5 nm)/DBP (10 nm)/DBP:C60/C60 (20 nm)/Bphen (6 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The MoO3 thin film acted as the hole extraction layer, and the Bphen thin film served as the electron extraction layer. First, the thicknesses of DBP:C60 (1:1) mixture layers were tuned to optimize the device performance. Fig. 1(a) shows the current density to voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2), and the device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases with the thickness of the active DBP:C60 layer due to the increase of the optical absorption. However, the fill factor (FF) decreases with the increase of the active layer thickness because of the reduction in the charge collection efficiency. The optimized device with a 20-nm DBP:C60 layer resulted in a Jsc of 9.02 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.906 V and a FF of 52.2%, leading to a PCE of 4.26%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the cells are shown in Fig. 1(b).

To further optimize the device efficiency, we then fixed the thickness of the DBP:C60 layer to 20 nm and investigated the performance of the devices with various DBP:C60 blend ratios. The J–V characteristics and the EQE spectra of the DBP:C60 (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) devices are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The performance of the devices is also summarized in Table 2. The best performance was obtained in the DBP:C60 (1:2) device. Interestingly, devices with DBP-rich mixture layers exhibited lower Jsc and FF compared to the devices with the C60-rich mixture layers. The EQE results showed that the DBP-rich devices exhibited a lower EQE across the entire wavelength range, indicating that the DBP-rich mixture layers likely possess a low D/A interfacial area and/or discontinuous domain structure, leading to the higher charge carrier or exciton recombination and unbalanced carrier mobilities. The mechanisms were further investigated using AFM, SCLC, ac impedance, TPV and TPC measurements (vide infra).

Optical characteristics
Detailed optical properties provide information on the molecular stacking, which plays a significant role in the performance of the devices.39,40 Thus, we analysed the optical properties of the active layers to clarify the relationship between the DBP:C60 blend ratio and the donor molecular stacking. Variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) was utilized to investigate the anisotropic optical properties of a DBP neat film and DBP:C60 with different blend ratios. To extract the relatively complicated in-plane and out-of-plane optical constants, VASE measurements in transmission and reflection mode must be performed.41 Kramers–Kronig consistent models with a combination of Gaussian oscillators (∼8 for in-plane and ∼5 for out-of-plane) were constructed to model the in-plane and out-of-plane optical constants of the films. Fig. 3 shows the extracted refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) in the horizontal direction (in-plane, no, ko) and the perpendicular direction (out-of-plane, ne, ke) of the DBP neat film, respectively. no and ko are both much higher than ne and ke, i.e., a significant optical anisotropy was observed, which indicates that the molecular plane is oriented in the horizontal direction.41,42 However, the horizontal orientation of the DBP molecules may not be retained in vacuum-deposited DBP:C60 mixture films. To investigate the properties of the DBP:C60 blends, the ellipsometric data of DBP:C60 blended thin films with different ratios of DBP:C60 were also measured, with the extracted optical constants shown in Fig. 4. The higher ko value than the ke value at the absorption peaks of DBP can still be observed for the DBP:C60 mixture films. As the concentration of C60 increases, the difference between no and ne as well as between ko and ke drops due to the dilution effect of the C60. However, detailed analysis of the ko/ke of DBP:C60 with various composition ratios (including DBP neat film) at the DBP absorption peak (∼605 nm) reveals a comparable value in all of the samples, which indicates that the horizontal orientation of the DBP molecules in DBP:C60 blend is similar to that in the DBP neat film, regardless of the DBP:C60 ratio. The horizontal stacking of the DBP and the higher ko may contribute to the higher light absorption and improved hole transport. However, because DBP exhibits a similar orientation tendency in the films with different DBP:C60 ratios, the orientation of the DBP molecules may not be the main factor in the DBP:C60 ratio-dependent device performance.

Surface morphology
In OSCs, the surface morphology of the active layer may reveal some useful information regarding the performance of the devices.25,43–47 A large D/A interfacial area with bicontinuous charge carrier pathways is essential for effective exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. Thus, we analysed the surface nano-scale morphology of the DBP:C60 mixture films with various ratios (3:1, 1:1 and 1:2) by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the phase images are shown in Fig. 5. Surface topography images of the thin films exhibited similar smooth morphologies with a root mean square roughness of 0.25 nm in all blend ratios, but the phase images revealed distinct phase-separated formation mechanisms. In the DBP:C60 (3:1) blend film, the acceptor grains dispersed in the donor matrix, leading to a small D/A interfacial area and discontinuous pathways for electron transport. With the short exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors, the average distance between the acceptor grains is too long for excitons to successfully arrive at the D/A interface, leading to a low Jsc in the DBP:C60 (3:1) device. Discontinuous acceptor pathways result in the unbalanced charge carrier mobilities in the mixed layer, which is expected to cause the reduction of the FF in the DBP:C60 (3:1) cell. However, DBP:C60 (1:1) and DBP:C60 (1:2) thin films both exhibited fine domain structures, which induced a large D/A interfacial area, and thus a high exciton dissociation efficiency.

Charge carrier mobility
To examine the influence of the above-mentioned molecular stacking and thin-film morphology on the electronic properties, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were used to evaluate the carrier mobility in the DBP:C60 layer with various blend ratios.48,49 We fabricated the hole-only and electron-only devices with the structures of: glass/ITO/MoO3 (1 nm)/DBP:C60 (100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (150 nm) and glass/ITO/Mg (5 nm)/DBP:C60 (100 nm)/Ca (5 nm)/Al (150 nm), respectively. The fitted carrier mobilities are shown in Fig. 6. The hole and electron mobilities of the DBP:C60 (1:2) film were 1.58 × 10−4 and 1.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 700 (V cm−1)−0.5, respectively, which exhibited the most balance in the mobilities among all of the blend ratios considered, thus contributing to the highest performance under solar illumination. In contrast, the hole and electron mobilities in the DBP:C60 (3:1) mixed film were considerably unbalanced with the values of 1.22 × 10−4 and 4.81 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 700 (V cm−1)−0.5, respectively. Compared to DBP:C60 (1:2), the DBP:C60 (3:1) film exhibited a similar hole mobility, but exhibited a three orders-of-magnitude lower electron mobility. This result has good correlation with the surface morphology observed using AFM. The island-like acceptor grains are not able to provide a continuous pathway for electron transport, leading to a very low electron mobility and unbalanced charge carrier transport characteristics, which are further reflected in the low Jsc and FF of the DBP:C60 (3:1) device.

Energetic and positional disorder
A deeper insight into the correlation between the carrier mobility and the morphology of the DBP:C60 layer can be obtained by analyzing the temperature-dependent SCLC data using the Gaussian disorder model.50–52 The model is based on the concept of charge hopping. Energetic disorder (σ) and positional disorder (Σ) are used to describe the transport of carriers in random organic solids. Energetic disorder is the Gaussian width related to the random-variables energy, which comes from the distribution of the energy states. Positional disorder is the Gaussian width related to the overlap parameter, which arises from structural or chemical defects.53 The carrier mobility can be expressed using the Bässler formalism: (1)where E is the applied electric field, T is the absolute temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, μp is the prefactor mobility and C is the empirical constant. This equation can be used to analyse the temperature-dependent carrier mobility and extract the σ and Σ parameters of the blend films. Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show both the temperature-dependent hole and electron mobilities for the DBP:C60 (1:1) and (1:2) thin films, respectively. A good match between the experimental and the modelled data is found. The extracted parameters are listed in Table 3. In DBP:C60 (1:1) and (1:2) thin-films, the hole σ values were nearly identical. However, the DBP:C60 (1:1) film exhibited a lower electron σ value than that of the DBP:C60 (1:2) film. This lower value may be due to the equal molar ratio of the DBP:C60 (1:1) film. Furthermore, the DBP:C60 (1:1) film exhibited a lower hole Σ value but a higher electron Σ value compared to the DBP:C60 (1:2) layer, indicating that the distance between each DBP molecule varied, while C60 was more equally distributed as the C60 concentration increased. The above-mentioned blend morphology is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7.

AC impedance measurements
While the SCLC measurements revealed the electronic characteristics of the DBP:C60 blend film, the electronic properties of the complete DBP:C60 devices were further studied using alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy. AC impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the investigation of the interface and bulk electronic properties and the charge carrier characteristics of optoelectronic devices.54–56 Due to the different speeds of the electrical response of each component in the device, the electrical properties of the bulk and the interface could be analysed by monitoring the current response as a function of the applied voltage frequency. This method has been intensively used to analyse the charge carrier relaxation and transport in dye-sensitized solar cells57–59 and organic light emitting diodes.60–62 In recent years, the method has also been used to characterize the electrical properties of OSCs.63–67
The impedance spectra of the DBP:C60 OSCs were measured under simulated 1-sun illumination and in the dark. The illuminated devices were operated under Voc conditions, and the devices in the dark were biased with an additional voltage of 0.9 V. Fig. 8 depicts the Nyquist plots of the DBP:C60 (3:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) devices operated in the dark. We observed that the curves were fairly close to a semicircle and can be modelled with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 8. The equivalent circuit consists of a series connection of a series resistance (Rs) and a parallel resistance-constant phase element circuit (R1||CPE1). R1||CPE1 represents the depressed semicircles observed in the Nyquist plots. The extracted parameters are listed in Table 4. As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), the AC characteristics of the devices under 1-sun illumination follow the same trend as the case of operation in the dark. The largest R1 value of the DBP:C60 (3:1) device indicates that charge carriers are blocked, which resulted in the lowest FF in these devices. In contrast, the lowest R1 value of the DBP:C60 (1:2) device represents good charge carrier transport in the active layer, and thus the device exhibited the highest FF and PCE. The R1 value and the size of the semicircles decrease with the increase of the C60 ratio, which may be due to the increase of the electron mobility in C60-rich devices, as found in the SCLC measurements.

Transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were used to obtain the values of the carrier recombination lifetime (τn) and the charge density in the OSCs.68–72 The TPV decays were used to extract τn through a pseudo-first-order rate equation, (2)where ΔV is the amplitude of the TPV, t is the time and Δn is the change in the carrier density due to the laser pulse.68,69 The steady-state carrier concentration at Voc can be determined by (3)where C is the differential capacitance, A is the device area, e is the electronic charge and d is the thickness of the active layer. C was calculated using (4)where ΔV is the amplitude of the TPV. Q denotes the injected charges upon excitation, which could be measured by the TPC.

Fig. 9 shows the carrier lifetime versus the carrier density of the DBP:C60 devices with different blend ratios. Intriguingly, the carrier density of the DBP:C60 (3:1) device is higher than that of the DBP:C60 (1:2) device, suggesting a higher Jsc exists in the DBP:C60 (3:1) device. However, this suggestion contradicts the Jsc values observed in the actual devices. This discrepancy may be attributed to the different interfacial areas and the pathway morphologies of the charge carrier extraction. The higher carrier density in the device could result not only from a higher photogeneration but also from a slower exciton recombination. Because the absorption is approximately the same in films with various DBP:C60 ratios, the higher carrier density is more likely caused by the slower exciton recombination. For organic semiconducting mixtures, it has been shown that the bimolecular recombination process can be described by the Langevin expression, which indicates that the recombination rate is dominated by the carrier mobility of the slower charge carrier because the electrons and holes are confined to different phases in the blend.73,74 The lower electron mobility in the DBP:C60 (3:1) blend, as shown in Fig. 6, could result in a slower recombination rate and thus a higher carrier density, which is not beneficial to the device performance.

Recombination kinetics
Monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination all contributes to efficiency loss in OSCs.73,75–77 To clarify the dominant recombination process in the DBP:C60 system, J–V curves at different incident light intensities were modelled using a simple model constructed with the drift and continuity equations. In this model, the current is divided into two parts. J(V) = Jph(V) + Jdark(V),(5)where Jph is the photocurrent and Jdark is the dark current. Jdark here is assumed to be a constant at different incident light intensities. Jph can be calculated using the drift equation: Jph(V) = en(V)μE(V)(6)where n is the charge density, μ is the mobility and E is the internal electric field which is assumed to be homogeneous in the active layer: (7)where V is the applied voltage and d is the thickness of the active layer. Vs is the built-in-voltage at which the current under illumination is equal to the dark current, i.e., at which the photocurrent equals zero. Another important equation used in this model is the continuity equation: (8)where G is the generation rate and R is the recombination rate, which can be further divided into the mono- and the bi-molecular recombination rates. R = Rmono + Rbi,(9) (10) Rbi = γn2,(11)where Rmono is the monomolecular recombination rate, τ is the monomolecular recombination lifetime, Rbi is the bimolecular recombination rate and γ is the bimolecular recombination coefficient. The monomolecular recombination here includes all types of losses, which are proportional to the charge densities. In a more precise model, there should be a coefficient in front of the generation rate to describe the losses before charge separation. However, because the influence of these losses before charge separation on the J–V curves is similar to the influence of trap-assisted recombination at a low carrier density, which is the dominant factor of the diffusion equation, we account for these losses in the monomolecular recombination term for simplicity. From eqn (6) to (11), the following equation can be obtained: (12)The solution to the above equation is: (13)From eqn (6) and (13), the photocurrent can be calculated.
The generation rate, G, was obtained by the transfer matrix method, and other parameters can be extracted from the results of curve fitting, which are listed in Table 5. With these parameters and eqn (9)–(11), one can acquire the amount of the monomolecular recombination and the bimolecular recombination at different applied voltages, as shown in Fig. 10. The dominant recombination mechanism in DBP:C60 (3:1) is found to be the monomolecular recombination, while the dominant recombination in DBP:C60 (1:1) and DBP:C60 (1:2) devices is bimolecular recombination. This trend agrees with the surface morphology observed in the AFM images. DBP:C60 (3:1) possesses isolated acceptor domains and a small D/A interfacial area, which result in poor exciton dissociation efficiency and simultaneously reduce the possibility of free electrons and holes to encounter each other, resulting in the dominant recombination mechanism being monomolecular recombination. In contrast, DBP:C60 (1:1) and DBP:C60 (1:2), with interpenetrated domains and a large D/A interfacial area, are dominated by bimolecular recombination.

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic measurements
fsTA spectra of neat DBP and DBP:C60 (3:1, 1:1 and 1:2) films are presented in Fig. 11 for the indicated time delays. For neat DBP (Fig. 11(a)), in the visible range, we observe three narrow bleaches (negative photoinduced absorptions (PA)) located at 520, 560 and 616 nm. These bleaches occur at nearly the same wavelengths as the three corresponding peaks in the absorption spectrum of DBP, which suggests a state-filling origin. In the near-infrared, neat DBP exhibits a broad PA with a peak at 910 nm. Introduction of C60 produces a clear change in the TA spectra. For all three ratios of DBP:C60 investigated (3:1, 1:1 and 1:2, Fig. 11(b), (c) and (d), respectively), we observed a peak centered near ∼890 nm with a shoulder that extends to ∼1130 nm. This additional structure suggests the formation of a new electronic species. Based upon the spectroelectrochemistry literature, which indicates that C60− yields PA at ∼1065 nm,78 we assign the new feature to the formation of C60−. Inspection of the fsTA spectra indicates that DBP:C60 mixtures exhibit longer lived spectral features for both the visible and near-IR wavelength ranges.

We next investigated the dynamics at 1065 nm for both neat DBP and DBP:C60 mixtures (shown in Fig. 12). While we could not distinguish distinct rise times at 1065 nm for the mixtures in comparison to neat DBP at early (a few picoseconds) pump–probe delay times, dissimilar dynamics become apparent at longer times. Specifically, neat DBP decays to negligible signals before 1 ns with a fitted single exponential decay time of 92.2 ± 6.7 ps. The mixtures, however, exhibit much longer-lived PA at 1065 nm, which again suggests the formation of C60−. For the respective mixtures of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:2 DBP:C60, the data were fit to biexponential decays with time constants in ps of: 125 ± 26 (36%) and 3055 ± 350 (64%); 27 ± 16 (44%) and 4575 ± 568 (56%); and 92 ± 9 (38%) and 5866 ± 660 (62%). We suggest that the close similarities in the faster decay time constant for each mixture reflect the decay of the DBP that fails to charge separate. The longer decay constant values likely correspond to monomolecular (geminate) electron–hole pair recombination timescales. The DBP:C60 (1:2) mixture exhibits the longest lifetime (∼5.9 ns) of these three mixtures, which suggests that it experiences the lowest amount of monomolecular recombination. These results are consistent with the above-mentioned recombination model, which describes the distribution of monomolecular and bimolecular recombination in a DBP:C60 mixture (shown in Fig. 10). The recombination of the DBP:C60 (3:1) mixture exhibited the lowest amount of bimolecular recombination, while the DBP:C60 (1:2) mixture is dominated by bimolecular recombination and exhibited the lowest amount of monomolecular recombination. Here, the fsTA measurements not only revealed the monomolecular recombination dynamics but also further confirmed the accuracy of the recombination model.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technology has been applied to extract information about the nano-scale molecular arrangement in thin films, such as crystallite sizes, molecular orientation and intermolecular distances.8,79–84 Here, we used GIWAXS to characterize the molecular order and orientation of DBP:C60 thin-films. First, we examined the DBP neat film on a Si substrate, and the resulting two-dimensional GIWAXS pattern is shown in Fig. 13(a). Compared to the scattering pattern of the reference bare Si (shown in Fig. 13(b)), the DBP neat film shows evidence of self-organization within the film. The out-of-plane scattering peak from the (010) Bragg diffraction at qz = 1.37 Å−1 is associated with a π–π stacking spacing of 4.58 Å. This result indicates that the π–π stacking of DBP molecules was perpendicular to the substrate and that the DBP molecules are face-on oriented, which agrees with the anisotropic optical constants and molecular orientation of DBP measured by ellipsometry. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular ordering of the DBP:C60 mixtures, which were processed under the same evaporation conditions of the devices. Fig. 14 shows the 2D GIWAXS pattern of a DBP:C60 blend on Si substrates. With C60 present, the out-of-plane scattering peak was observed at qz = 1.39 Å−1 (d-spacing 4.52 Å), which indicates that DBP molecules are still face-on oriented in DBP:C60 thin films and that the stacking spacing of the DBP molecules slightly decreases. In addition, the crystallite size of the DBP lamellae was found to be 6–7 nm for all blend ratios, indicating that the crystallinity of DBP is not affected by the DBP:C60 ratio. Two in-plane peaks are observed at qy = 0.684 and 1.325 Å−1 for DBP:C60 (3:1), 0.690 and 1.335 Å−1 for DBP:C60 (1:1) and 0.716 and 1.342 Å−1 for DBP:C60 (1:2), which correspond to the (100) Bragg diffraction, indicating that the C60 molecular spacing decreased with the increase of the blend ratio. The different C60 stacking spacing values may be due to the interference from the DBP molecules. As for the out-of-plane peaks from C60, the features at 0.75 Å−1 are stronger in-plane than out-of-plane, suggesting that face-on oriented DBP molecules interfere with the C60 out-of-plane stacking. The feature of C60 at qz = 1.34 Å−1 and the feature of DBP are overlapped and thus are difficult to analyze. The GIWAXS results indicate that the increase of the C60 ratio in the blend does not only enhance the interconnection between C60 domains but also shorted the average distance of C60 molecules, which are both beneficial to electron transport. To eliminate the effect of the substrate on the samples, we further examined the scattering pattern of DBP:C60 thin films on Si/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/DBP (10 nm) under-layers (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The suppressed scattering peak indicates that the blend thin films in real devices exhibit weaker crystallinity compared to the films on the crystalline silicon substrate. However, except for the different scattering intensities, the same trends were observed in all of the samples regardless of the different under-layers.

Conclusion
In summary, the “all carbon” photovoltaic devices based on the homocyclic molecule DBP as a donor and C60 as an acceptor have been comprehensively characterized. The optimized device with a DBP:C60 mixture thickness of 20 nm and the ratio of DBP:C60 (1:2) exhibited a PCE of 4.47%. Our systematic study revealed some promising advantages of the DBP donor and DBP:C60 (1:2) blends for photovoltaic devices. First, the DBP molecules exhibit horizontal orientation, both in DBP neat films and in DBP:C60 blends. The face-on stacking could enhance both the absorption of light and the charge carrier mobility. fsTA studies strongly suggest efficient charge separation in the DBP:C60 mixtures, with the spectroscopic observation of a long-lived radical anion of C60. Subsequently, DBP:C60 (1:2) thin films exhibited not only optimized domain sizes but also partially interconnected acceptor grains, causing a high D/A interfacial area and continuous pathways for electron transport. With the bicontinuous charge carrier pathways, the most balanced carrier mobility and the lowest bi-molecular recombination were found for the DBP:C60 (1:2) devices, which exhibited the highest Jsc, FF and PCE of the blends studied.
The molecular ordering and crystallinity in DBP neat films and DBP:C60 blends were also investigated. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns indicated a face-on stacking of the DBP molecules, both in DBP neat films and in DBP:C60 mixtures, which supports the results found in the ellipsometry measurements. In addition, the DBP molecules were found to stack closely, with a π–π stacking spacing of 4.58 Å, indicating an effective molecular orbital overlap in DBP. The close molecular packing of DBP leads to efficient hole transport in the DBP:C60 mixture and thus to balanced hole and electron mobilities, especially in the DBP:C60 (1:2) thin film. The study not only reveals the promising characteristics of DBP as donors in OSCs but the clear correlations of the thin-film nano-morphology, molecular stacking, carrier mobility and charge recombination found here could also provide insights into the characterization methodology and optimization of the small molecule OSCs.
Experimental
Device fabrication
The donor material, DBP, was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corporation, and the acceptor material, C60, was purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Corporation. All organic materials were purified by temperature-gradient sublimation in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of ∼1 × 10−6 Torr before usage. The metal oxide, the organic layer and the metal electrodes were thermally deposited in sequence on pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates in an ultra-high vacuum chamber at a base pressure of ∼1 × 10−6 Torr. The deposition rate of all organic compounds was controlled to a value between 0.3 and 0.6 Å s−1. The Ag electrode deposition rate was ∼3 Å s−1. The active area of the cells had an average size of 5 mm2, defined by the intersection area between the Ag cathode and the ITO anode. The devices were encapsulated using a UV-cured sealant (Everwide Chemical Co., Epowide EX) and a cover glass under an anhydrous nitrogen atmosphere after fabrication and were investigated under ambient conditions.
Characteristics measurements
The current density to voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a SourceMeter Keithley 2636A under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated using a NREL-traceable KG5 filtered silicon reference cell). The EQE spectra were obtained by illuminating chopped monochromatic light with a continuous-wave bias white light (from halogen lamp) onto the solar cells. The photocurrent signals were extracted using the lock-in technique using a current preamplifier (Stanford Research System) followed by a lock-in amplifier (AMETEK). The EQE measurements were fully computer controlled, and the intensity of the monochromatic light was carefully calibrated using an NIST-traceable optical power meter (Ophir Optronics). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken using a Veeco Nanoscope 3100 atomic force microscope. The AC impedance spectroscopy measurements were implemented using a Reference 600 (GAMRY Instrument) potentiostat; the frequency was swept over the range of 10 Hz to 1 MHz. The obtained data were fitted using EIS300 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Software (GAMRY Instrument) in terms of the appropriate equivalent circuits. Ellipsometric measurements of the DBP:fullerene thin films over a wavelength range of 300 nm to 1100 nm in steps of 5 nm were performed in air using J. A. Woollam V-VASE equipment. The angles of light incidence were varied between 55° and 75° relative to the surface normal in steps of 10° for reflection ellipsometry and between 40° and 60° relative to the surface normal in steps of 10° for transmission ellipsometry. The analysis of the ellipsometric data was performed using the software WVASE32 (J. A. Woollam Co.). Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were obtained using a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Minilite I) pumped dye laser (Rhodamin 6G, the lasing wavelength range is 555–585 nm with a maximum at 566 nm, pulse width ∼5 ns) as an excitation source. A 100 W variable intensity halogen lamp was used as the bias light. The transient signals were amplified using a voltage preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR560) and a current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570) for the TPV and TPC measurements, respectively, and were recorded using an oscilloscope (Tektronix). Averages of 256 to 512 traces were obtained to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) measurements were produced using a 35 fs pulse width, 2 kHz commercial amplified Ti:sapphire laser system operating at 580 nm. Tunable pump pulses were generated using a white-light seeded optical parametric amplifier. A portion (5%) of the amplifier output was mechanically time-delayed and then focused onto a 2 mm thick sapphire plate to produce a white light probe. The pump fluence was 18 μJ cm−2 for the fsTA measurements reported below. Films were constantly translated in a raster pattern to prevent the effects of any long-lived charging. No film degradation was observed in the measurements. Grazing Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at Beamline 8-ID-E85 of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Slits of size of 200 μm (horizontal) and 20 μm (vertical) defined the unfocused beam from the undulator source with a photon energy of 7.35 keV (λ = 1.6868 Å) incident onto the sample at an angle αi ≈ 0.2°. The samples were kept under ambient conditions with the Pilatus 1 M pixel array detector (Dectris) positioned 204 mm away. A translation stage allowed the detector to be displaced vertically to compensate for the rows of inactive pixels (172 μm by 172 μm) at the borders between modules. The two-dimensional data, with 20-bit resolution, were stored in 32-bit tif files. The files were corrected for detector non-uniformity, detector sensitivity and solid angle, combined into composite images while eliminating the horizontal rows of the inactive pixels, converted to q-space and integrated into linecuts using the GIXSGUI package for Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.). Carrier dynamic modelling program was coded using Matlab software (The MathWorks, Inc.) and performed using a dual-core Intel-CPU desktop computer.
