    , Accepted 17th May 2020First published on 18th May 2020AbstractControlling the crystal orientation of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is crucial in tuning the optoelectronic properties and improving the device performance. Herein, the favored crystal orientation of MAPbI3 perovskite is finely tuned by additive engineering for carbon based printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By introducing biguanide hydrochloride (BH), the out-of-plane crystal orientation of perovskite film is notably enhanced along the (001) and (002) crystal plane, which affects charge transportation and collection properties of perovskite films. More importantly, the BH added perovskite has the most appropriate energy level. Under the optimized condition, the hole-conductor free printable mesoscopic PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.35% by introducing a 30% molar ratio of BH. The unsealed device retains 98% of its original PCE after 2500 h storage in air with humidity of 50 ± 5%. The results provide a novel and effective approach toward fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs for future commercialization.
Introduction
Due to the low-cost and low-temperature processability,1,2 excellent light absorption,3 long carrier diffusion length,4 and high carrier mobility,5 perovskite materials have emerged as an exceptional candidate for optoelectronic applications.6,7 Over the past few years, the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly risen from 3.8% to the state-of-the-art value of 25.2%.8 The printable triple mesoscopic solar cells based on screen-printed mesoporous TiO2/ZrO2/Carbon triple-layer architecture are attractive because of the simple fabrication process9,10 and the potential for scaling-up.11,12 Omittance of expensive hole-transport-materials (HTMs) and application of carbon electrode instead of the commonly used noble metals further decreases the fabrication cost.12–16
Additive engineering is widely employed to improve the performance of PSCs, both in planar and mesoscopic structures.17,18 The use of additives can affect perovskite crystallization and film formation, defect passivation in the bulk and/or at the surface, as well as influence the interface tuning of structure and energetics.19–21 Apart from the above effects, crystal orientation also has a great impact on the properties of perovskite films and the resultant device performance.22 To date, only a very limited numbers of additives have been found to successfully tune the crystal orientation of perovskites, such as NH4SCN and MACl.22,23 Favored crystal orientation of perovskite not only can promote charge transfer,22 but also reduce defect density24 and improve the stability of perovskite.25,26 In our former studies, guanidine hydrochloride (GA) was employed into printable triple mesoscopic solar cells to improve the performance by improving the crystallinity and photon absorbing intensity of perovskite.27 Recent evidence suggests that guanidinium can form a homologous series (C(NH2)3)(CH3NH3)nPbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3) of layered 2D perovskites which is stabilized by the alternating ordering of the guanidinium and methylammonium cations in the interlayer space, prepared the ACI (cations in the interlayer space) 2D perovskite.28,29 Furthermore, the addition of guanidinium can enhance the carrier lifetimes of perovskite films.30 Some studies confirmed that guanidinium can participate into the MAPbI3 3D lattice, enhanced the thermal and environmental stability.31,32
In order to explore the role of the guanidinium salts and encouraged by previous excellent works, we designed a set of organic hydrochloride salts with cations sharing the identical guanidine group, namely guanidine hydrochloride (GA), dimethylbiguanideas hydrochloride (DMBG) and biguanide hydrochloride (BH). All of the salts improve the quality of the perovskite films and the BH–MAPbI3 material gives the best performance. Combining X-ray diffraction (XRD), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we found that the BH could enhance the orientation of perovskite crystal inside devices more effectively among three additives. As a result, the BH added MAPbI3 (BH–MAPbI3) leads to the highest PCE of 16.35% in the printable triple mesoscopic solar cells. Besides, we found that chloride ions also have contribution to the PCE, which along well with the former studies.33–35 The guanidinium and chloride ions have the synergistic effect to the MAPbI3. We believe these findings could provide a new strategy for improving the performance of mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.
Result and discussion
The molecular structures of these three guanidine salts are shown in Fig. 1a. In order to study the interaction between additives and perovskite, the 1H NMR was conducted. The 1H NMR spectrum of a neat BH, MAPbI3, and BH–MAPbI3 solution in deuterated N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (DMF-d7) are shown in Fig. S1a.† In a neat sample of BH, resonance signal attributable to the amino cation group appear at δ = 7.55 ppm, which is characteristic of chloride-anion binding with NH3+ groups by N–H⋯Cl− hydrogen bonding. The presence of MAPbI3 induces an upfield chemical shift of Δδ ≈ −0.33 ppm for the N–H protons of the BH due to the stronger shielding effect of the N–H⋯I− compared to the N–H⋯Cl− hydrogen bond. Furthermore, from the comparison of 1H NMR spectrums shown in Fig. S1b and c,† both of MAPbI3 induces an upfield chemical shift, indicating the same interactive model between GA/DMBG and MAPbI3 as BH. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to explore the crystallization conditions of perovskite films with different BH ratios (from 0 to 40 mol% of the BH/MAPbI3 ratio). In Fig. S2,† the 13.98°, 24.36° and 28.20° peaks belonged to cubic-MAPbI3, which were assigned to (001), (111), and (002) crystal planes, respectively.22 Additionally, when the concentration of BH increased to 20 mol%, a peak appeared at 7°, indicating the formation of some low-dimensional perovskites.23,36 Besides, the perovskite with BH showed a peak with higher intensity compared with the pure MAPbI3, indicating a better crystallinity.37,38 The intensity increase when the molar ratio of BH is 10–30%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results further clarified the chemical states of Pb and Cl. The Pb 4f peaks of the perovskite films with 30% BH shift toward higher binding energies (Fig. S3†) in contrast with the control (unless otherwise specified, the molar ratio of GA, DMBG, BH in GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 is 30%). This shift to higher binding energies indicates the removal of electron density from the Pb atoms, pointing to stronger binding with the Pb.39 Besides, both of control and BH–MAPbI3 films showed no peaks of 2p orbit of Cl as shown in Fig. S4,† indicating the perovskite films didn't remain element Cl because the Cl was evaporated in the form of MACl.34 Based on the above results, the interaction between BH and MAPbI3 was shown as the schematic diagram in Fig. 1b.

In order to clarify the increase of crystallinity further, the reciprocal full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the XRD spectra (Fig. S2†) is shown in Fig. 2a. The narrower diffraction peaks were observed in the films prepared with BH as compared with the pristine film. The highest value was obtained from a concentration of 30%. To explore the influence of guanidine salts on crystals orientation, we checked the ratios of the peak intensity of (002)/(001), (111)/(001), (111)/(002) for perovskite films with the different molar ratio of BH as shown in Fig. 2b. It was found that the peak intensity ratio of (002)/(001) almost remained unchanged, while the peak intensity ratio of (111)/(001) and (111)/(002) has an obvious decrease from 0.61 and 1.58 to almost zero by increasing the BH ratio from 0 to 30%, respectively. Subsequently, we employed the same method to study the effect of different guanidine salts on the growth of perovskite crystals, the XRD pattern of perovskite added different additives is shown in Fig. S5.† As shown in Fig. 2c, the peak intensity ratio of (111)/(001) and (111)/(002) has an obvious decrease, especially for GA–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3, indicating an apparent preferable growth along (001) and (002) crystallographic planes for perovskites with GA and BH.

The previous studies showed that chloride ions have an impact on the performance of perovskite films. In order to explore the contribution of chloride ions.33–35 In this work, we used biguanide hydriodate (BHI) as the additive to explore the effect of chloride ions. As shown in Fig. S6,† the XRD pattern of 30% BHI–MAPbI3 is similar to 30% BH–MAPbI3, all of them have a strong peak before 10°, indicating that the introduction of biguanide can lead to the formation of low-dimensional perovskites. Subsequently, we checked the ratios of the peak intensity of (002)/(001), (111)/(001) and (111)/(002) for BHI–MAPbI3 perovskite films further. As shown in Fig. S7,† the BHI–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 have the almost same peak intensity ratio of (002)/(001), (111)/(001) and (111)/(002). The peak intensity ratio of (111)/(001) and (111)/(002) has an obvious decrease by introducing BHI and BH, indicating that biguanide can lead to an apparent preferable growth along (001) and (002) crystallographic planes for perovskites. In the meantime, the XRD pattern of BH–MAPbI3 showed a peak with higher intensity compared with the BHI–MAPbI3 as shown in Fig. S6.† Which indicated that though the chloride ions did not remain in the perovskite films after annealing, it can influence the crystallization condition during the process of annealing.
To further assess the crystal microstructure of above GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3, and BH–MAPbI3 perovskite samples, especially the crystal orientations in multiple orders, the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed. As shown in Fig. 2d, the bright rings at q = 10, 17, and 20 nm−1 are assigned to (001), (111), and (002) crystal planes, respectively. The red color regions indicated strong diffraction signals for corresponding crystal planes with preferred orientation and the light blue colored regions indicated a relative weak diffraction intensity for corresponding crystal planes. It was clearly observed that the diffraction intensities of preferred planes, including both (001) and (002), varied significantly with different guanidine salts. From the results above, MAPbI3 exhibits continuous diffraction rings along with extended arc segments, which indicates considerable random crystal orientation (Fig. 2d), while the GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3, and BH–MAPbI3 showed orientation compared with MAPbI3. As Fig. 2d shows, the BH–MAPbI3 perovskite exhibits the best orientation at q = 10 nm−1and q = 20 nm−1compared to GA–MAPbI3 and DMBG–MAPbI3, which is consistent with the peak before 10° in XRD pattern, suggesting much more ordered alignment of crystals, confirmed the formation of some low-dimensional perovskites further.23,36 It is worth noting that the out-of-plane orientation of BH–MAPbI3 is dramatically enhanced, as indicated by the sharp spots along qz, which would favors charge transport in solar cells. The BH–MAPbI3 showed a strong intensity at 45° azimuth angle, suggesting BH–MAPbI3 stacked along to 45°.36 We further assess the variation of the crystal plane stacking pattern with respect to a certain crystallographic plane in perovskite film. The GIWAXS pattern azimuthally along the ring at q = 10 nm−1 was assigned to (001) plane (Fig. 2d), the dominant diffraction peak of corresponding perovskite structure, was considered as an example. It was observed clearly that the stacking patterns of BH–MAPbI3 changed distinctly. As shown in Fig. S8,† the diffraction ring of MAPbI3 displayed uniformly from 20° to 90°, indicating a relatively disordered stacking. While the peak intensity of BH–MAPbI3 located at azimuth angle 45° increased significantly and became overwhelming. This suggested the occurrence of preferred facet orientation of (001) crystal plane dominantly stack along the 45° direction and also indicated an enhanced long-range crystallinity of BH–MAPbI3 perovskite film, the stack along one direction can facilitate the transfer of charge.40Fig. 2e showed the corresponding schematic interpretation of preferred crystal orientation along (001) and the stack angle of BH–MAPbI3 films. Furthermore, the GIWAX pattern of perovskite with different concentration of BH was explored (Fig. S9†) and we found the 30% molar ratio of BH exhibited the best orientation.
The top-view SEM image of perovskite with different guanidine salts are shown in Fig. 3a–d. From the top-view SEM, the crystal grains become larger when guanidine salts were introduced, especially for BH–MAPbI3. In addition, the small broom shaped crystal plates disappeared and were replaced by the uniform and large crystals, leading to the enhanced surface coverage of the perovskite. The morphology of perovskite with different concentrations of BH was shown in Fig. S10.† The crystal size increases with the concentration of BH rising up, which is in agreement with the results of XRD.

(e) Comparison of the steady-state PL intensities of MAPbI3, GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 films deposited on ZrO2/glass substrates. (f) Comparison of the TRPL spectra of MAPbI3, GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 films deposited on ZrO2/glass substrates (the wavelength for monitoring the TRPL is 478 nm). (g) Comparison of the TRPL spectra of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% BH–MAPbI3 films deposited on ZrO2/glass substrates. 
The steady-state photoluminescence (steady-PL) was further carried out to evaluate the photophysical properties of perovskite prepared with different additives. As shown in Fig. 3e, the BH–MAPbI3 exhibited increased PL intensity compared with MAPbI3, GA–MAPbI3 and DMBG–MAPbI3, indicating that the addition of BH can reduce the defect states in perovskite films.41,42 Furthermore, the steady-PL intensity increased when the additive molar concentration increase from 10% to 30%. When the concentration was further increased to 40%, the intensity decreased as shown in Fig. S11,† indicating the 30% is the most appropriate concentration of BH.
We estimated the carrier lifetimes of fresh perovskite films with different additives through the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), all the TRPL spectra could be fitted by bi-exponential decays with a fast (τ1) and a slow (τ2) component. The τ1 decay component corresponded to non-radiative recombination from defects and the τ2 component corresponded to radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.43 First, we test the TRPL properties of perovskite added with different guanidine salts on the substrate of ZrO2/glass. In Fig. 3f and Table S1,† the MAPbI3 shows a relative shorter carrier lifetime of 21.19 ns (τ1 = 9.79 ns and τ2 = 31.17 ns) and the addition of guanidine salts could enhance the carrier lifetime of perovskite film. Among these samples, BH–MAPbI3 exhibits the longest carrier lifetime of 41.65 ns (τ1 = 19.14 ns and τ2 = 86.28 ns). The longer carrier lifetime means the non-radiative recombination is restrained indicating the defects density of perovskite has decreased.2 We assume that BH could passivate the bulk defects of MAPbI3. To further explore how BH influence the carrier lifetime of perovskite, we tested the TRPL of MAPbI3 films added with different amount of BH, as shown in Fig. 3g and Table S2.† With the concentration of BH increasing from 10 mol% to 30 mol%, the carrier lifetime is enhanced from 25.70 ns to 80.84 ns. When the concentration of BH reaches 40 mol%, the carrier lifetime decrease. Combining the XRD results, we assume that BH could suppress the generation of defects inside the MAPbI3 by improving the crystallization of perovskite withing the proper concentration. So, the steady-PL and carrier lifetime of BH–MAPbI3 are improved.
In order to explore the influence of different additives on the optical properties of perovskite, the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) spectra were measured to calculating the bandgap (Eg) of perovskite prepared by these three different guanidine salts. The Eg of MAPbI3, GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3, and BH–MAPbI3 are 1.57 eV, 1.58 eV, 1.60 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively. The bandgap was determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 4a) from the normalized UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. S12†), suggesting almost the same absorbance range of GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3, and BH–MAPbI3. Furthermore, BH–MAPbI3 has the strongest light absorption intensity. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) pattern (Fig. 4b) illustrate that the valence band minimum (VBM) of MAPbI3, GA–MAPbI3, DMBG–MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 is −5.87 eV, −5.98 eV, −5.85 eV and −5.64 eV. The VBM of BH–MAPbI3 is higher than the others as the energy level diagrams shown in Fig. 4c. These results indicated BH–MAPbI3 matches better with carbon.

We applied the perovskites in devices based on structure of FTO glass/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/mp-ZrO2/mp-carbon, the schematic of the triple-layer printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells was shown in Fig. S13.† A clear trend of enhancement in device performance produced by the introduction of BH into the perovskite precursor solution from 0 to 30% can be observed in Fig. S14.† When improving the concentration further to 40%, the PCE decreased, which suggests that 30% is the best concentration for BH–MAPbI3 based device, consistent with the above resultants. Short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) have an obvious increasing trend, which can be attributed to the enhanced absorption and reduced trap states. As shown in Fig. 5a, the champion device achieved the best PCE of 16.35% with a VOC of 0.962 V, JSC of 23.87 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.2% (the stabilized PCE exceeding 15.5% as shown in Fig. 5b), while the MAPbI3 devices only showed the highest PCE of 9.65% and the best PCE of GA–MAPbI3 and DMBG–MAPbI3 is 13.47% and 14.43%, respectively. The enhanced performance can be contributed to the oriented growth of perovskite crystal, the higher crystallinity as well as a more appropriate energy level compared with MAPbI3. The BH–MAPbI3 not only has the oriented growth of perovskite crystal but also has the most appropriate energy level. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of BH–MAPbI3 based device is shown in Fig. 5c, exhibiting an integrated JSC of 22.0 mA cm−2, which was in good agreement with the J–V measurements. Furthermore, we prepared the devices based on BHI–MAPbI3. As shown in Fig. S15,† the highest PCE of device based BHI–MAPbI3 is 13.54%, which shows an obvious improvement compared MAPbI3, but lower than BH–MAPbI3. This demonstrated the contribution of chloride ions further. The parameters of different kinds of devices was summarized in Table S3.†

(c) Corresponding EQE and the integrated photocurrent of optimized BH–MAPbI3 solar cell. (d) Long-term stability of the unencapsulated MAPbI3 and BH–MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells at 50 ± 5% RH. 
Furthermore, the devices based on BH–MAPbI3 have better stability compared with the control. Fig. 4d shows the evolution of normalized PCE over time for unencapsulated devices stored in ambient atmospheric under dark (humidity ≈ 50 ± 5%). BH–MAPbI3 based devices exhibit good environmental stability, retaining 98% of their initial PCEs after aging 2500 h. However, the control only retains 60% of their initial PCEs after aging 1000 h. Furthermore, we evaluated device stability under 60 °C in nitrogent conditions without any encapsulation for 200 h, as shown in Fig. S16.† The PCE of the BH–MAPbI3 retaining 86% of their initial PCEs after 200 h storage, while the MAPbI3 doping shows a PCE drop of 78% after 132 h, indicating the better thermal stability of BH–MAPbI3 compared with MAPbI3 (all of the statistic analysis of stability was based on five devices). With increasing orientation ordering, the crystallinity of the perovskite films will be intensified. The resultant decreasing of grain boundaries favors the improvement of moisture stability.23 Therefore, we assigned the improvement of stability to the favored orientation of perovskite and the passivation of perovskite by hydrogen-bond interaction between BH and MAPbI3.44
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the crystal orientation of guanidine salts additional perovskites based on glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/ZrO2/carbon printable triple mesoscopic solar cells. By systematically investigating the effect of different additives and concentrations on the perovskite crystal structure, morphology, bandgap, and crystal orientation, we found that the preferable growth along (001) and (002) crystal plane, as well as the face-up crystal stacking of the perovskite crystals significantly affected the charge transportation and collection properties within the devices. Among the three different guanidine salts, the BH exhibited the best properties. Except for high orientation, the BH–MAPbI3 can helps reduce non-radiative recombination. Besides, BH–MAPbI3 has the most appropriate energy level which can match better with carbon electrode. Due to the hydrogen bond between BH and inorganic slabs, the devices show much more stability against humidity. Due to the introduction of biguanide and chloride ions, the PCE have an obvious improve. As a result, with the optimized composition, the BH–MAPbI3 based device achieved a PCE over 16% under one sun illumination and exhibits good stability. It thus sheds light on understanding the intrinsic properties of high-oriented perovskites, which guides further investigation and application in perovskite optoelectronics.
