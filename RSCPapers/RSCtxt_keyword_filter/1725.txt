    , Accepted 6th February 2012First published on 6th February 2012AbstractA kind of molecular metal chalcogenide, (N2H4)3(N2H5)4Sn2Se6 complex, was synthesized in the hydrazine solution and employed as the precursors for SnSe2 deposition on TiO2 nanocrystalline porous films. A power conversion efficiency of 0.12% under AM 1.5, 1 sun was obtained for the SnSe2 sensitized TiO2 solar cells.
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are increasingly drawing attention as a kind of potential third-generation solar cells.1–3 There are many distinct advantages of using quantum dots (QDs) as a sensitizer. Firstly, their absorption spectrum can be easily tuned to match the spectral distribution of sunlight by tailoring their size.4,5 Secondly, the large intrinsic dipole moment of quantum dots can lead to rapid charge separation.6,7 Thirdly, the multiple exciton generation (MEG) effect8 shows great potential for QDs-based solar cells to beat the Shockley–Queisser limit.9,10
Up to now, there have been several methods to prepare QDs in QDSSCs. One is to synthesis monodisperse colloidal QDs in organic solvents using a hot-injection method firstly, then the presynthesized colloidal QDs are deposited on the surface of the oxide electrode without any linker (direct adsorption)11 or using bifunctional molecule linkers.4,12 Apparently, the surface ligands or the molecule linkers will play a significant role in charge transfer and subsequently in the power conversion efficiency of the cells.13,14 Another widely used method is to grow QDs directly onto oxide electrodes by chemical bath deposition (CBD) processes.15,16 In the CBD approaches, dissolved cationic and anionic precursors are reacted slowly in one bath or separated into two beakers and the oxide electrodes dipped alternatively into each, to grow the target QDs. The latter process has been dubbed “successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction” (SILAR).17–19 Recently, some other methods, such as heteroepitaxial growth of QDs via hot-injection,20 electrophoretic deposition,21 have also led to considerable efficiencies of QDSSCs. Although the SILAR approach may be considered as one of the most effective ways to prepare QD sensitizers, the preparing process of the Se and Te precursors is complicated. Moreover, there is an urgent need for effective and general approaches that will allow deposition of more complicated QDs such as CuInxGa1−xSySe2−y.
Recently, molecular metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) have attracted much attention as precursors for mesoporous metal chalcogenides and semiconducting films with high mobility.22,23 Mitzi et al. firstly used hydrazine as a solvent and excess chalcogen (S or Se) to improve the solubility and film-forming properties, as a result of the formation of highly soluble N2H4–MCC precursors that can be solution processed into thin-film form and decomposed to the starting metal chalcogenide at low temperature.24–26 Furthermore, Talapin et al. have found that N2H4–MCCs can serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and nanowires, where MCCs provide colloidal stabilization while enabling strong electronic coupling in the NC solids.22,23 Here we demonstrated for the first time that N2H4–MCCs can also serve as precursors for quantum dots in QDSSCs, which combines the benefit of high coverage of QDs on oxide with the advantage of linker-free, direct contact between QDs and oxide. Tin diselenide (SnSe2) has attracted widespread attention as a promising candidate for solar cell applications due to its electronic and optical properties.27 However, a solution approach for SnSe2 is as yet quite limited. The utility of N2H4–MCC precursors is demonstrated for a model system, SnSe2 quantum dot sensitized TiO2 photoanodes with no report up to now.
Firstly, we synthesized the soluble N2H4–MCC precursors, (N2H4)3(N2H5)4Sn2Se6, following literature procedures.23 The precursors are isolated by stirring elemental tin and selenium in hydrazine under ambient conditions. Dissolution primarily occurs through the overall reaction in Reaction (1) and the vigorous bubbling during dissolution supports the gas generation indicated in Reaction (1): 5N2H4 + 6Se + 2Sn → N2 (gas) + 4N2H5+ + Sn2Se64−(1)According to thermal analysis results of previous work,24,25 the (N2H4)3(N2H5)4Sn2Se6 complex began to lose three N2H4 molecules at about 90 °C, resulting in the (N2H5)4Sn2Se6 complex, while the (N2H5)4Sn2Se6 does not decompose and crystallize to hexagonal SnSe2 completely until 250 °C. To identify the components and structure of the N2H4–MCC precursor in the resulting solution, the solution was vaporized under a N2 atmosphere at 90 °C and yellow powders were obtained. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained powders are shown in Fig. 1, with refined tetragonal lattice constants a = 12.77 Å and c = 22.71 Å, which are consistent with the structure of (N2H5)4Sn2Se6 reported in the previous references. The chemical analysis of the powders is also in good agreement with that expected for (N2H5)4Sn2Se6—expected N: 13.29%, H: 2.39%, found N: 13.43%, H: 2.57% with ±0.3% accuracy.

In order to obtain QD sensitized TiO2 photoanodes for solar cells based on the above N2H4–MCC precursors, the photoanodes were immersed in the hydrazium precursor solution resulting from Reaction (1) for some time and then annealed in an Ar atmosphere. Fig. 2(a) shows scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the bare TiO2 electrode, while Fig. 2(b) for the precursor solution immersed and then 250 °C annealed electrode for one hour under an Ar atmosphere. Compared with bare TiO2 films, the dimension of QD sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles increases slightly and the porosity decreases at the same time. The deposition of precursors and SnSe2 QDs on TiO2 nanoparticles was more clearly evidenced from the high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HR-TEM) patterns shown in Fig. 3. A clear amorphous layer with a thickness of ∼5 nm remained on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles after the precursor solution immersion (Fig. 3a), indicating that Sn2Se64− are markedly adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles after the immersion. Moreover, due to the thickness of the amorphous layer, a precipitate of (N2H4)3(N2H5)4Sn2Se6 must be formed simultaneously. The amorphous layer exhibited a little shrinkage after annealing at 250 °C as a result of continuous gas escape, turned to well-crystallized SnSe2, with the (101) lattice planes displayed (d = 0.291 nm) as shown in Fig. 3(b).

The TiO2 films sensitized with SnSe2 quantum dots were also demonstrated with X-ray diffraction patterns. For comparison, Fig. 4 shows both the XRD pattern of the pure phase of SnSe2 obtained after annealing the N2H4–MCC precursors and that of the precursor solution immersed and then annealed TiO2 nanoporous films. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the pure phase was matched well with that of hexagonal SnSe2 (JCPDS#23-0602) with the most intense peak (101) plane at 2θ = 31.5°. The peak appearing at the same position in the sensitized TiO2 films clearly suggested a deposition of the SnSe2 phase, although only the most intense peak was observed due to the relatively low quantity of SnSe2.

The light absorption of the SnSe2 capped TiO2 film is shown in Fig. 5, indicating that the SnSe2 quantum dots have an apparent light absorption in the UV-vis region. For photovoltaic studies, we used the 60 min soaked film to prepare SnSe2 sensitized solar cells to assess the potentials of SnSe2 quantum dots to act as light absorber material. The control cell is assembled with the bare TiO2 electrode and the electrolyte. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and photocurrent–voltage characteristics are measured under the conditions described in the experimental details. The IPCE spectrum in Fig. 6 suggests that the SnSe2 sensitizer has a relatively high absorption within the range of 350 nm–650 nm. The IPCE spectra well correspond to the UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 5. The photocurrent density–voltage curve of the SnSe2 sensitize solar cell is shown in Fig. 7 and the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-curcuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (η) are 0.77 mA cm−2, 0.37 V, 0.43 and 0.12%, respectively (Table 1). The power conversion efficiency is dramatically increased from 0.004% to 0.12% by deposition of SnSe2 quantum dots. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few reports on solar cells made of SnSe2.28 However, another kind of tin–selenium compound, SnSe nanocrystals, has been recently employed to fabricate hybrid solar cells with poly(3-hexylthiophene).29,30 Power conversion efficiencies of 0.06% and 0.01% under AM 1.5 sun have been obtained respectively. The efficiency of the SnSe2 sensitized TiO2 solar cell here is much lower than those of dye sensitized solar cells and CdS and CdSe sensitized solar cells prepared by the SILAR method.31–33 However, this is the first demonstration of the photovoltaic behavior of the SnSe2 sensitized TiO2 structure, and there is much space for further improvement. Moreover, the method is an in situ method to deposit quantum dots directly on the surface of metal oxides, enhancing the electron transformation from quantum dots to metal oxide nanocrystallines, favorable for high performance solar cells. What's more, this strategy can be popularized to fabricate a large family of metal chalcogenide quantum dots with more complicated structure, such as CuInxGa1−xSe2−ySy, which is difficult to be prepared by the conventional CBD or SILAR methods.

In summary, the molecular metal chalcogenide was demonstrated to serve as precursors for the precipitation of quantum dots (QDs) for the first time.

The assembled QDs solar cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 0.12% under AM 1.5, 1 sun.
