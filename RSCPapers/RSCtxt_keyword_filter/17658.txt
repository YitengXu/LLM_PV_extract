    , Accepted 20th December 2022First published on 21st December 2022AbstractRbCsFAMA-based multi-cation perovskites with a narrow bandgap and high lattice stability show great promise for achieving high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an aromatic zwitterion of 1-(3-sulfopropyl)pyridinium hydroxide inner salt (SPHI) is introduced into perovskite ink to regulate the crystal growth of bromine-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation perovskite. The SPHI modulated perovskite film shows significantly improved film quality with increased photoluminescence lifetime from 1110 ns to 1700 ns. Moreover, the sulfonic group and pyridine N+ in SPHI synergistically passivate the charged defects in the perovskite film through coordination and electrostatic interaction, which greatly depresses the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and reduces the open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit, resulting in a minimum VOC loss of 0.36 V. Excitedly, the champion devices yield record efficiencies of 25.01% (certified 24.60%) and 23.40% (certified 22.97%) for RbCsFAMA-based PSCs with aperture areas of 0.09 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively, showing great upscaling potential. Unencapsulated devices also demonstrate excellent long-term operational stability. This work provides an avenue for regulating multi-cation light-absorbers to further improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received increasing attention from worldwide academia and industry due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low cost, and ease of fabrication.1–4 After a decade of development, the highest certified PCE for small-area PSCs has been elevated to 25.7%,5 which is significantly higher than that of traditional polycrystalline Si and other thin film solar cells. To date, the most efficient PSCs have been based on formamidinium (FA)-based perovskites owing to their broader light absorption spectra compared to that of methylammonium (MA)-based perovskites.6,7 However, the relatively large ionic radius of FA makes FAPbI3 exhibit a non-ideal tolerance factor,8 leading to phase transformation from the α to the δ phase when the temperature is below 150 °C, or exposed to a humid atmosphere, light and heat.9 To overcome these drawbacks, composition engineering,10–12 additives,13–16 and low-dimensional perovskites17 have been adopted to stabilize the crystal structure, modulate the film quality and depress the trap-state of FA-based perovskites. Among those types of perovskites with different compositions, multi-cation FA-based perovskites, such as CsFAMA,18 CsRbFA,19 and RbCsFAMA,20,21 show improved device performance and stability in comparison with pure FA-based or pure MA-based perovskites. However, some side effects, such as phase separation and an enlarged bandgap derived from the introduction of Br−, may exert detrimental influence on the long-term operational stability of PSCs based on the above FA-based perovskite materials and restrict the related photogenerated current density.22,23 Therefore, in order to further the practical development of PSCs, besides obtaining stable FA-based perovskite films, much effort is still needed to increase the photogenerated current density.
Composition tailoring is one of the most widely used approaches to extend the absorption in near-infrared spectra through tuning the bandgap of perovskite. For example, partially replacing Pb2+ with Sn2+ can obtain a perovskite film with an ideal bandgap (∼1.3 eV) for photovoltaics (PV), enabling sufficient incident light to be absorbed.24,25 However, Sn2+ is prone to be oxidized to Sn4+, which adversely degrades the device stability. Although many strategies have been proposed to address this problem,26 the perfect solution is still under exploration. Moreover, the efficiencies of Sn-containing devices still lag behind that of pure Pb-based devices. On the other hand, to keep the inherent bandgap of FA-based perovskite, pure iodine-based multi-cation perovskite became a competitive candidate because the A-cite cation showed negligible influence on the bandgap of perovskite compared to the halogen anion with a similar molar ratio. Among them, the bandgap of RbCsFAMA quadruple cation perovskite was reduced from 1.63 eV (ref. 20) to 1.54 eV (ref. 27) when MABr was replaced by MAI. Considering the benefit of the Br-free concept mentioned above, RbCsFAMA-based perovskite may be the most charming one for achieving high efficiency and excellent stability at the same time. For the RbCsFAMA-based perovskite material system, Dai and co-workers recently optimized the quality of the electron-transport layer by using home-made single-crystal TiO2 and pushed the device efficiency to 24.05% along with a high short circuit current density (JSC) of 25.35 mA cm−2.27 Because the champion RbCsFAMA-based PSCs up to now demonstrated an open circuit voltage (VOC) deficit of over 0.40 V,27 it was indicative of the existence of trap-dominated non-radiative recombination in perovskite. Besides the bandgap of perovskite, the JSC value is also related to the film quality of the light absorber. Therefore, it's desirable to develop film quality regulation and defect passivation strategies for Br-free RbCsFAMA perovskite to further reduce the VOC deficit and enhance the related JSC as well as improving the device stability. Previous studies indicated that zwitterions were effective in stabilizing and passivating other types of halide perovskites for PV applications.28 For example, Huang et al. introduced a zwitterion of 3-(decyldimethylammonio)-propane-sulfonate inner salt into MAPbI3 perovskite to simultaneously control the perovskite crystallization and passivate defect states, leading to an improved PCE to over 21%.29 Tan's group used a zwitterionic formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) to inhibit Sn2+ oxidation and passivate defects at the grain surfaces in mixed Pb–Sn perovskite films, thus enabling efficiencies of 21.7% and 25.6% in single-junction and tandem perovskite devices, respectively.30 Ouyang and co-workers adopted an aromatic zwitterion of rhodamine 101 as an interface layer to improve the carrier extraction in PSCs through the formed surface dipoles.31 Compared to the widely studied alkyl zwitterions, aromatic zwitterions exhibit a delocalized π bond and may exert special influence on carrier transfer.32 However, there are rarely reports on passivating hybrid perovskite with aromatic zwitterions.33 Moreover, no study on adding zwitterions to RbCsFAMA-based quadruple cation perovskite has been reported and the mechanism behind it needed in-depth investigation.
In this work, we found that an aromatic zwitterion of 1-(3-sulfopropyl)pyridinium hydroxide inner salt (SPHI) was very suitable for a RbCsFAMA perovskite material system to achieve high performance PSCs. Therefore, we here report simultaneous advancements in the film quality, efficiency, and stability of Br-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation PSCs by just adding aromatic zwitterion SPHI into the precursor solution. The introduction of SPHI not only effectively passivates the charged traps (under-coordinated Pb2+ and FA vacancies) in the perovskite film through coordination and electrostatic interaction, but also regulates the crystal growth of the perovskite film, giving rise to suppressed formation of deep-level defects and reduced non-radiative recombination. This enables a high VOC of 1.162 V along with a minimized VOC loss of 0.36 V. The improved film quality combined with the narrowed bandgap (Eg = 1.52 eV) of RbCsFAMA perovskite also boosts the JSC up to a certified value of 25.7 mA cm−2. As a result, a champion PCE of 25.01% (certified 24.60%) and a notable FF of 83.80% have been achieved for the planar quadruple cation perovskite device, which is the highest efficiency for RbCsFAMA-based PSCs to date.20,27,34,35 The present strategy was further extended to a large area device, and a record PCE of 23.40% (certified 22.97%) has also been obtained for the RbCsFAMA device with an aperture area of 1 cm2, demonstrating great scaling up potential. Meanwhile, unencapsulated devices with SPHI show excellent long-term operational stability, retaining more than 90% and 80% of their initial efficiencies after 2000 h of storage in the dark and 500 h of continuous maximum output power point tracking (MPPT) under 1 sun illumination (white light LED array), respectively.
Results and discussion
SPHI is a sulfonic zwitterion with multi-functional groups, such as a pyridine ring and a sulfonic group. To visualize the charge distribution of the SPHI molecule, the electrostatic potential (ESP) was calculated by using density functional theory (DFT). As shown in Fig. 1a, the pyridine N+ and pyridine ring overall show positive ESP (blue) and the sulfonic group (–SO3−) exhibits negative ESP (red), forming an intrinsic molecular dipole (the dipole moment was calculated to be 13.12 D). SPHI with the electron-rich units of the sulfonic group can theoretically passivate Lewis-acid defects, such as the under-coordinated Pb2+.36 Meanwhile the pyridine N+ with positive ESP may compensate for the A cite cation vacancy via interaction with I− (the proposed interaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 1b). Therefore, SPHI is a potential efficient passivator for healing the imperfection of different perovskites.37,38

To study the influence of SPHI on the crystal growth and defect passivation of Br-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation perovskite, a trace amount of SPHI (0.1 wt%) was introduced into the perovskite precursor. The interaction between SPHI and the perovskite precursor can be revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Fig. 1c shows the FT-IR spectra for SPHI, and SPHI mixed with PbI2 and FAI, respectively. The stretching vibration of –SO (1035 cm−1) in SPHI shifted to a lower wavenumber when SPHI was mixed with PbI2 and FAI, respectively. The results indicated that SPHI could interact with both PbI2 and FAI.37 Liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed to further determine the interaction between SPHI and the perovskite precursor. It was found that the proton signal of the –CH– nearby the sulfonic group appeared at 3.272 ppm (Fig. 1d), which was shifted to 3.269 ppm when SPHI was mixed with PbI2, indicating the existence of coordination interaction between Pb2+ and the sulfonic group in SPHI. The signal of –CH– nearby pyridine N+ in SPHI also exhibited a similar shift, suggesting electrostatic interaction between pyridine N+ and I−.39 UV-vis absorption spectra were collected to study the interaction between SPHI and the perovskite precursor. As shown in Fig. 1e, a red shift of the onset in absorption spectra was observed for the SPHI–PbI2 mixed solution compared to that of the pure SPHI and PbI2 solutions, indicating interaction between PbI2 and the sulfonic groups in SPHI. Additionally, a similar shift could be found for the SPHI–FAI mixed sample (Fig. S1, ESI†), confirming the interaction between SPHI and FAI, which agreed well with the FTIR results.
Fig. S2, ESI† shows the survey of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for the perovskite films without and with SPHI. All compositions in RbCsFAMA perovskite are visible in the XPS spectra. A weak characteristic peak around 162 eV could be found for the SPHI treated film (Fig. 1f), which was ascribed to S 2p from SPHI, verifying the presence of SPHI in the resultant perovskite film. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of Pb2+ shifted to a higher binding energy after the introduction of SPHI (Fig. 1g), which could be ascribed to the increased interaction between the perovskite and sulfonic group in SPHI through a coordination reaction.40 A similar phenomenon was observed for the I 3d peaks (Fig. 1h), attributable to the electrostatic interaction between I− and pyridine N+ groups in SPHI.41 In short, we experimentally revealed that the SPHI could not only coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+via Lewis acid–base interaction, but also compensated for the FA vacancy by forming electrostatic interaction with FAI. This will result in suppressed formation of deep level trap-states, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance.
To gain insight into the influence of SPHI on the crystal growth of the Br-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation perovskite, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was subsequently performed (Fig. 2a). Perovskite films with different concentrations of SPHI exhibited the same crystal structure of phase-pure photoactive perovskite, which was in good agreement with a previous report.27 A small peak at 12.5° was the characteristic peak of PbI2, which should be ascribed to the prolonged annealing time of the resultant perovskite film. Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peak for the (110) plane of perovskite increased gradually with increasing the SPHI concentrations and peaked for the sample containing 0.1 wt% SPHI. In the meantime, the corresponding full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) plane decreased gradually from 0.221° to 0.120° and exhibited a minimum value for the perovskite film with 0.1 wt% SPHI. The result indicated that SPHI could efficiently regulate the crystal growth and improve the crystallinity of RbCsFAMA perovskite. In terms of the crystal quality, the optimal concentration of SPHI was 0.1 wt%. The surface morphologies of perovskite films without and with 0.1 wt% SPHI were studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2b and c show that both films were covered fully by polycrystal perovskite crystal grains. The grain size statistical distributions showed that the average crystal size increased from 353 nm for the control one to 388 nm for the SPHI treated sample (Fig. S3, ESI†). This result implied that the crystal quality of the perovskite film was improved upon SPHI treatment, in good agreement with the XRD results. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses for both perovskite films were measured by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The RMS values of 20.9 nm and 18.8 nm were obtained for the control and SPHI-treated perovskite films (Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. A smoother surface usually indicates a higher film quality, which is favorable for achieving high performance PSCs. In addition, except for a slight increase in the absorption intensity of UV-vis absorption spectra due to the improved crystallinity, perovskite films without and with SPHI showed an optical bandgap of 1.52 eV (Fig. S5, ESI†), suggesting that the introduction of SPHI had no significant influence on the intrinsic light absorption properties of the perovskite film. The band tail width (Urbach energy, EU) is highly related to the charged defects in perovskites and it can be calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra.42,43 As shown in Fig. 2d, the EU values for the control and SPHI-passivated perovskite films were estimated to be 30.3 and 24.5 meV, respectively. The result suggested that the introduction of SPHI reduced the disorder of shallow energy levels and improved the electronic quality of perovskite films.23

To determine the effect of SPHI on the energy levels of the quadruple cation perovskite films, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was performed (Fig. S6, ESI†). The Fermi level for the control perovskite film was calculated to be −4.60 eV, which was higher than that of the SPHI-treated film (−4.68 eV). This result indicated that the introduction of SPHI endowed the perovskite with a more p-doped surface, which was beneficial for promoting charge transfer from perovskite to the hole-transport layer. Additionally, the deeper valence band maximum (VBM = −5.86 eV) for SPHI-passivated perovskite allowed the achievement of a higher VOC in comparison with that of the control perovskite (−5.78 eV).44 Therefore, the introduction of SPHI improved the energy levels alignment between perovskite and the hole-transport layer.
Steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy studies were performed to evaluate the film quality and charge-carrier transportation dynamics in perovskite films. Both films without and with SPHI exhibited a PL emission peak at 815 nm (Fig. 2e), in good agreement with the optical bandgap value (1.52 eV) extracted from the UV-vis absorption spectra. Moreover, the SPHI containing quadruple cation perovskite film showed a stronger PL intensity than the control sample, indicating that the film quality of RbCsFAMA perovskite was significantly improved after introducing SPHI. A similar conclusion could also be reached from TRPL results (Fig. 2f). The TRPL decay curves were fitted via using a bi-exponential function (eqn (1)) and the fitted data are summarized in Table S1, ESI.† (1)where τ1 is the fast decay process related to bimolecular recombination and τ2 is the slow decay process associated with trap-assisted recombination.45B is a constant for the baseline offset. A1 and A2 are constants, representing the contributions of the fast and slow components, respectively.46 For the control film, τ1 and τ2 were fitted to be 5.1 ns and 1119 ns, respectively. However, these values were changed to 4.7 ns and 1715 ns, respectively, for the SPHI treated perovskite film. This result indicated that the introduction of SPHI into perovskite profoundly influenced the slow PL decay process and depressed the trap-assisted recombination. The average PL decay lifetime can be obtained using eqn (2): (2)
The average PL lifetime (τave) for the control perovskite film was calculated to be 1117 ns, which was significantly enhanced to 1708 ns for the SPHI treated perovskite films. The prolonged PL lifetimes were indicative of reduced non-radiative recombination in the SPHI-treated RbCsFAMA perovskite film, which was conducive to achieving high VOC.45,47
A planar device of FTO/SnO2/RbCsFAMA perovskites/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag was assembled to investigate the effect of SPHI on the PV performance (Fig. 3a), where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide and spiro-OMeTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene. The energy level alignment for all functional layers obtained from the UPS results and the references are depicted in Fig. 3b.48 The downshifted VBM for SPHI-passivated perovskite was beneficial for the hole separation and transportation. Additionally, the downshifted conduction band minimum (CBM) of RbCsFAMA perovskite reduced the carrier transport barrier, which enhanced the electron transfer from perovskite to SnO2.49 Fig. S7, ESI† shows the typical cross-sectional SEM images of the control and SPHI-containing devices. No obvious grain boundaries can be found along the vertical direction for the SPHI-containing perovskite film, which is also conducive to charge-carrier transportation and collection. The statistical distribution of device performance with different SPHI concentrations is shown in Fig. S8, ESI.† The average PCEs for the control device are around 22.10%, which varied with increasing the SPHI concentrations and peaked at 24.31% for the 0.1 wt% SPHI treated devices, which was in good agreement with the crystal quality of perovskite films obtained from the XRD results. Fig. 3c and S9, ESI† present the champion J–V characteristics of the control and SPHI treated devices under standard AM 1.5 G illumination (the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Table 1). For the control device, a PCE of 22.50% along with a JSC of 25.75 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.105 V and an FF of 79.06% has been obtained. Meanwhile the optimized SPHI-passivated device delivered an impressive PCE of 25.01% with JSC = 25.69 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.162 V, and FF = 83.80%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the record PCE for normal structured RbCsFAMA quadruple-cation PSCs at present (Table S2, ESI†).20,27,34,35 Clearly, the significant enhancement in the PCE comes from the improved VOC and FF for the SPHI treated device. One of the best SPHI-treated devices was sent to an accredited test center, achieving a certified PCE of 24.60% and FF of 83.72% (Fig. S10, ESI†). Given the narrowed bandgap of Br-free RbCsFAMA perovskite (Eg = 1.52 eV) in our study, the VOC deficit for the champion device was only 0.36 V, which was one of the lowest VOC deficit values for PSCs with a similar bandgap.27,50,51 Except for the bandgap of perovskite, the VOC loss is highly related to the charged traps in perovskite and the corresponding energy alignment with charge extraction layers. Therefore, the improved VOC and FF of the SPHI treated device should be attributed to the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film, the well-matched energy level alignment, the reduced interfacial charge-carrier transfer barrier and the suppressed non-radiative recombination in RbCsFAMA perovskite.52 External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were collected for both devices to confirm the reliability of our sunlight simulator (Fig. 3d). It could be found that both devices showed a flat and high EQE value over 85% in the range of 350–800 nm. Notably, the corresponding integrated photocurrent densities were calculated to be 25.40 and 25.43 mA cm−2 for the control and SPHI treated devices, respectively, which matched well with the values extracted from the J–V curves (<1.5% deviation). This result indicated that our Br-free perovskite with a narrow bandgap could absorb fully the incident light and produce high JSC. The statistics of photovoltaic parameters (including VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) for the control and SPHI-treated devices from 60 individual cells verified the excellent repeatability of the fabrication procedures in this study (Fig. 3e, Tables S3 and S4, ESI†). The maximum output power point tacking (MPPT) provided a stabilized efficiency of 24.6% (at 1.00 V) for the SPHI-passivated device (Fig. 3f), whereas the control device gave a stabilized efficiency of 21.2% (Fig. S11, ESI†). The SPHI modulation strategy was also extended to a different perovskite component to evaluate its universality, and an impressive PCE of 24.88% along with a notable FF of 84.33% had been achieved for the device based on FAMA-based perovskite (Fig. S12, ESI†). These results demonstrated the advantage and reliability of SPHI passivation for achieving high efficiency PSCs.

To further verify the compatibility of SPHI in laboratory upscaling of the perovskite film, a large area perovskite device was then fabricated. Excitedly, a PCE of 23.40% was obtained finally for the SPHI-treated RbCsFAMA perovskite device with an aperture area of 1 cm2 (Fig. 3g), which outperformed that of the control device. This is also the highest efficiency for RbCsFAMA-based PSCs with a similar active area. We sent one of such devices to an accredited test center, and a PCE of 22.97% and a JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2 have been certified (Fig. S13, ESI†). Moreover, the SPHI-treated large area PSCs exhibited a reduced hysteresis index (Fig. S14, ESI†) and enhanced reproducibility compared to the control devices (Fig. 3h), showing great potential in upscaling the PSCs by the SPHI-mediated strategy. After analyzing the PV parameters in Table 1, it could be found that the efficiency gap between small and large area devices mainly stemmed from the FF, which was attributed to the big interfacial series resistance in a large area. Therefore, more efficient large area PSCs can be expected via further optimizing the interface contact and reducing the resistance of transparent conductive electrodes.53
To deeply understand the influence of SPHI on the PV performance, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to quantitatively examine the trap state in perovskites without and with SPHI treatment. The trap density, nt, can be determined using eqn (3).54 (3)where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, nt is the trap density, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite,55 and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. The dark current–voltage (I–V) curves for the electron-only and hole-injecting devices are shown in Fig. 4a and S15, ESI,† respectively. The density of electron traps was calculated to be 2.46 × 1015 cm−3 for the control perovskite film, which was reduced to be 2.09 × 1015 cm−3 after introducing SPHI. Meanwhile, the density of hole traps was also reduced from 2.03 × 1015 cm−3 for the control device to 1.66 × 1015 cm−3 for the latter one (Fig. S15, ESI†). The results indicated that the SPHI zwitterion effectively passivated the charged traps in RbCsFAMA-based perovskites, which was responsible for the obtained high VOC and FF.56

To further study the charge-carrier recombination mechanism in the devices, J–V curves under different light intensities were collected for both devices. Fig. S16, ESI† shows the power-law dependence of JSC on the incident light intensity (0.05 sun ≤ light intensity ≤ 1 sun). The control and SPHI treated devices display slopes of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, both of which were close to 1, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination was negligible for both devices, and the predominant recombination mechanism in the device was trap-assisted recombination.57Fig. 4b shows the relationship between light intensity and VOC.58 The ideality factor (n) was calculated to be 1.79 and 1.18 for the control and SPHI-passivated devices, respectively, indicating that the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination process was effectively suppressed after introducing SPHI,59 in line with the SCLC results. The built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices was then extracted from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot to better understand the enhancement of VOC (Fig. 4c).60 A Vbi of 0.95 was obtained for the SPHI-treated device, superior to that of the control device (Vbi = 0.86 V). This result indicated that the SPHI-passivated device exhibited an enhanced driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers, keeping the same trend with the improved values of VOC.
To gain insight into the interfacial carrier transfer and transport kinetics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. Fig. 4d shows the Nyquist plots for the control and SPHI-passivated devices at 0 V applied bias voltage in the dark. The charge-transport resistance (Rtr) related to the high frequency region and recombination resistance (Rrec) presented in the low frequency region were fitted by using Z-view software with the given equivalent circuit (Fig. 4d). The corresponding values are also summarized in Table S5, ESI.†59 Obviously, the SPHI treated device showed a lower Rtr and a higher Rrec compared with the control one, suggesting a faster charge-carrier transfer and a lower recombination rate. Therefore, high VOC and FF values for the device can be expected.61 In other words, the significant enhancement in PV performance for the SPHI treated device was attributed to the reduced trap-state, improved PL lifetimes and suppressed non-radiative recombination.
Finally, we investigated the stability of both control and SPHI-treated devices stored in a N2 filled glovebox at room temperature. Fig. 5a–d and Table S6, ESI† show the main parameters for the control and SPHI-treated devices without encapsulation. After 2000 h of storage in the dark, 90% of its initial efficiency was retained for the SPHI-treated device, whereas the control device remained 80% of its original efficiency, confirming the excellent storage stability of the devices. To study the operational stability of the unsealed devices, we subsequently performed the MPPT of the device under continuous light soaking (white light LED array, N2 filled box, and ∼30 °C). As shown in Fig. 5e, the SPHI treated device retained over 80% of its original efficiency after 500 h of continuous MPP tracking under 1 sun illumination, which was superior to that of the control device (retained 40% of its initial PCE after 100 h of MPPT). The significantly improved stability of SPHI treated PSCs was ascribed to the improved crystal quality and reduced trap-state in the perovskite films.

Conclusions
In summary, an aromatic zwitterion was first introduced into a Br-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation perovskite precursor, which is the most charming perovskite system because of the high efficiency and stability. The sulfonic group and pyridine N+ in SPHI can not only passivate the charged defects in the perovskite film through coordination and electrostatic interaction, but also synergistically modulate the crystal growth of perovskite, thus resulting in reduced charged traps, suppressed non-radiative recombination and improved film quality. The best device delivered a record PCE of 25.01% (certified 24.60%) along with a minimum VOC deficit of 0.36 V and a high JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2 for Br-free RbCsFAMA quadruple cation PSCs. Moreover, the present strategy can be extended to a large area PSC, delivering an impressive PCE of 23.40% (certified 22.97%) with an aperture area of 1 cm2. The unencapsulated target device demonstrated excellent long-term and operational stabilities. Our study highlighted the importance of rational modulation of crystal growth for furthering the practical development of RbCsFAMA-based PSCs.
