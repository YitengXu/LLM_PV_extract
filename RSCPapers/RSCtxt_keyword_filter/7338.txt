        CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuIn(1−x)GaxSe2 (CIGS) nanoparticles were synthesised from the diisopropyldiselenophosphinatometal complexes Mx[iPr2PSe2]n (M = Cu(I), In(III), Ga(III); n = 1, 3) by thermal decomposition of the precursors in HDA/TOP at 120–210 °C or 250 °C. The semiconductor nanoparticles obtained were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The diameters of the nanoparticles for CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 were found to be 4.9 ± 0.6 nm (at 180 °C), 13.5 ± 2.9 nm (at 250 °C) and 14 ± 2.22 nm (at 250 °C) respectively. The p-XRD patterns for the nanoparticulate samples were assigned to the corresponding ICDD patterns for tetragonal chalcopyrite phase.
Introduction
Ever increasing demands for energy and environmental concerns over the extensive use of fossil fuels necessitate the development of efficient alternative energy technologies. During the past decade, photovolatics have promised to emerge as a viable and environmentally benign energy technology.1 Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to find materials which may potentially reduce the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity produced by the next generation of PV modules. Compound semiconducting materials of the I–III–VI2 family: CuInSe2 (CIS), CuGaSe2 (CGS) and CuIn(1−x)GaxSe2 (CIGS) are amongst the leading absorber materials for solar photovoltaic applications. The attraction of chalcopyrite based I–III–VI2 photovoltaic materials lies in their high power conversion efficiency, high absorption coefficients, photo-irradiation stability and lower toxicity than some competitors.2 Disadvantages include the relative rarity and expense of both indium and gallium metals. Solar modules based on these materials may still offer lower cost, shorter energy payback times and flexible applicability. Jackson and co-workers have recently reported power conversion efficiencies of 20.1 and 20.3 for CIGS based on thin film solar cells.3

        CuInSe2 has a direct band gap of 1.04 eV but the band gap of the material alloyed with gallium CuIn(1−x)GaxSe2 can be tuned from 1.04 eV to 1.68 eV.4 Phase chemistry, crystallographic structure, fabrication methods and optoelectronic properties of CuInSe2 and related compounds have been extensively reviewed.5,6 Several approaches have been used for the controlled synthesis of CuInSe2 and related semiconductor nanostructures, which include co-evaporation,7chemical vapor deposition (CVD),8chemical bath deposition (CBD),9RF sputtering,10 successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) method,11 mechanical alloying,12solvothermal method,13electrodeposition,14 spray deposition15 and microwave irradiation.16 Many of these processes require high vacuum during deposition which results in significant loss of materials. Another issue limiting their applicability on large scales is the difficulty in achieving precise control over the structure, morphology and stoichiometric composition of the deposited material over larger substrate area as performance of solar photovoltaic devices is strongly influenced by properties of the absorber materials. Recently, Zhong et al.17 and Tuan et al.18 have reported the gram scale synthesis of CuInSe2 and stoichiometry controlled CuIn(S1−xSex)2 and CuIn1−xGaxSe2nanocrystals, thus demonstrating possibility to upscale production of these materials.
Solution phase processes often involve lower processing temperatures, low cost precursors, can access flexible substrates and offer possibility of ‘roll to roll’ manufacturing, potentially reducing manufacturing costs for the PV modules. In recent years, research efforts have often focused on non-vacuum based solution-phase approaches for synthesis of semiconducting nanoparticles as a photo-absorber layer in the solar cells. One route involves colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals and their deposition onto low-cost substrates.19 The colloidal synthesis of semiconducting nanomaterials can offer good control over size, morphology and structure of the nanoparticles.20 Therefore, the synthesis of colloidal nano-crystals with optimal optoelectronic properties for use in PV devices is an active area of research by virtue of their potential to offer low-cost and scalable manufacturing of solar cells and PV modules for the 21st century.
Previously we have reported synthesis of CuInSe2 nanoparticles from two step reaction using CuCl, InCl3 and TOPSe in TOPO.21 Castro and co-workers have synthesized chalcopyrite semiconductor nanoparticles of CuInS2 and CuInSe2 by thermal decomposition of molecular single source precursors (PPh3)2CuIn(SEt)4 and (PPh3)2CuIn(SePh)4 in dioctyl phthalate at temperatures between 200 and 300 °C.22Allan and Bawendi have reported the synthesis of Cu–In–Se quantum dots of varying stoichiometric compositions, which exhibited good photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) from the red to the near infrared (NIR) region,23 using a hot injection synthetic methodology.24 Their approach involved the use of the halides of copper and indium precursors and bis(trimethylsilyl)selenide [(Me3Si)2Se] as the chalcogenide precursor, and a combination of tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) and oleylamine (OA) was used to provide a coordinating solvent and capping ligand(s). However, the stoichiometric compositions obtained were different from CuInSe2 as they obtained CuIn5Se8, CuIn2.4Se4, and CuIn1.5Se3 materials.
Nose and co-workers have recently reported the synthesis of CuInSe2 quantum dots from metal halides and Se powder.25Octadecene (ODE), tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) and hexadecylamine (HDA) were used as a coordinating solvent system for growth of colloids. The diameter of as synthesized nanoparticles ranged from 1.2 to 5.0 nm, depending upon the reaction conditions. Sargent et al. have reported the synthesis of CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuInGaSe2 nanoparticles in oleylamine using metal salts and selenium powder.26 Korgel and co-workers have also carried out synthesis of CuInS2, CuInSe2 and CuIn1−xGaxSe2nanocrystals with controlled In/Ga ratio in oleylamine at 240 °C and used these nanocrystals as an absorber layer in prototype photovolatic devices.27 Recently, Mitzi et al. have reported a solution-based approach for deposition of a CIGS absorber layer.28 Their strategy involves dissolving the elements in a hydrazine based solvent system, spin coating the precursor elements as thin films and heating in inert atmosphere at temperature <500 °C to obtain a CIGS layer. The process did not involve any post-treatment and the PV devices constructed from this layer have achieved power conversion efficiency of up to 10% (1.5 illumination).
We have previously reported the facile and reproducible synthesis of air and moisture stable [HNEt3][iPr2PSe2] ligand and many of its complexes with different metals.29 Herein, we report the synthesis of phase pure ternary metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanoparticles of CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuInxGa1−xSe2 through thermal decomposition of diisopropyldiselenophosphinatometal Mx[iPr2PSe2]y (where M = Cu, In, Ga) precursors in HDA/TOP as capping ligand. Nearly monodispersed quantum dots were obtained and the size and stoichiometric composition of the dots were controlled by carefully optimizing the reaction temperatures, reaction duration and precursor ratios. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of the use of Se containing binary precursors for the synthesis of CIGS nanoparticles.
Experimental

Chlorodiisopropylphosphine (97%), triethylsilane (98%), triethylamine (97%), Se powder ∼100 mesh (99.5%), indium(III) chloride (99.99%), gallium(III) chloride (99.99%), copper(II) chloride, copper(I) chloride (99.99%), methanol (99.9%), hexadecylamine (90%, technical grade), tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (90%, technical grade), trioctylphosphine, octadecene (90%, technical grade) and oleylamine (90%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company and used as received. Solvents toluene and methanol were dried by distillation over sodium/benzophenone and calcium hydride, respectively prior to use.
Standard Schlenk line techniques were used to carry out synthetic reactions under inert atmosphere of nitrogen. Solid air sensitive chemicals (GaCl3) were handled inside a glove box under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The glassware was flame dried along with evacuation followed by purging with dry nitrogen to remove moisture before each experiment. 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AC300 FT-NMR spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Kratos Concept 1S instrument. Elemental analyses were performed by the University of Manchester micro-analytical facility. Melting points were recorded using a Stuart melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.

UV-Vis-NIR
absorption spectra of as synthesized quantum dots were recorded in dry toluene using a HELIOS λspectrophotometer. p-XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 AXE diffractometer (Cu-Kα). The films of semiconductor nanomaterials obtained through the drop cast method were scanned between 5 and 85 degree with a step size of 0.05. The diffraction patterns obtained were then compared to the documented patterns in the ICDD database using EVA software package. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to determine the size and morphological structure of as synthesized semiconductor nanoparticles. TEM samples were prepared by evaporating a dilute toluene solution of the nanoparticles on carbon coated copper grids (S166-3, Agar Scientific) and Tecnai F30 TEM, operated under an accelerating voltage of 300 kV, was used to obtain TEM images of the nanoparticles. Stoichiometric composition of the materials obtained was determined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis.
Synthesis of [HNEt3][iPr2PSe2] ligand
The ligand [HNEt3][iPr2PSe2] was synthesized by the procedure reported in the literature with a slight modification.30Chlorodiisopropylphosphine, iPr2PCl (4.8 mL, 30 mmol) and triethylsilane, HSiEt3 (9.6 mL, 60 mmol) were dissolved in 150 mL cold dry toluene under nitrogen followed by triethylamine, NEt3 (10.4 mL, 80 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 6 hours at room temperature forming a white cloudy precipitate. Grey Se powder (4.3 g. 60 mmol) was added to the solution and the contents were further refluxed for 20 hours, leading to formation of a dark red solution and white precipitate. The white precipitate was filtered off. The resulting solution was reduced to ∼50 mL and kept at 0 °C to produce pale yellow needle like crystals. The crystals were filtered and washed with cold hexane. Yield, 10 g (89%). Elemental analysis, % (found: C, 38.7; H, 8.1; N, 3.6; P, 8.3; calc: C, 38.2; H, 8.0; N, 3.7; P, 8.2). 1H NMR (δ, CDCl3, 300 MHz): 3.21 ppm (6H, q, J = 7.3 Hz, 3 × CH2CH3), 2.14 ppm (4H, dsep, 3JHH = 6.7 Hz, 2JPH = 5.5 Hz, 2 × CH(CH3)2), 1.33 ppm (9H, t, J = 7.3 Hz, 3 × CH2CH3), 1.18 ppm (12H, dd, 3JHH = 6.7 Hz, 3JPH = 19.1 Hz, 2 × CH(CH3)2), 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): 8.72 ppm (CH2CH3), 17.77 ppm (CH(CH3)2), 33.65 ppm and 34.14 ppm (CH(CH3)2), 45.97 ppm (CH2CH3); Mass (APCI), most important fragments include [HNEt3] m/z 102, [iPr2PSe2] m/z 275.
Synthesis of precursors

          Diisopropyldiselenophosphinato complexes of indium(III), gallium(III) and copper(I) were used as precursors in this study. Synthesis of the complexes was carried out according to the procedure(s) previously reported.31

          Growth of copper indium diselenide nanoparticles
In a typical procedure for the synthesis of CuInSe2 nanoparticles, 15 g hexadecylamine (HDA) and 5 mL of octadecene (ODE) were degassed for 1 h in a three-necked flask fitted with a septum, condenser and thermometer. Nitrogen was flushed thrice through the system and the contents of the flask were heated under nitrogen to maintain the desired reaction temperature (120–210 °C). 0.1 mmol of [Cu4(iPr2PSe2)4] and 0.4 mmol of [In(iPr2PSe2)3] were suspended in 4 mL TOP under nitrogen and injected into HDA/ODE in the flask at the desired temperature. The contents of the flask immediately turn dark brown indicating formation of ternary CuInSe2. The temperature initially dropped and was returned to the original temperature. The reaction was continued for a further 30 minutes allowing growth of nanocrystals after which the heating was removed and the reaction mixture allowed to cool to 60 °C. Excess anhydrous methanol was then added and precipitates formed were separated through centrifugation. Clear supernatant liquid was discarded and the dark brown semiconductor material thus obtained was washed thrice with 10 mL anhydrous methanol, dispersed in 3 mL dry toluene and centrifuged again. Toluene suspension obtained after centrifugation was stored under nitrogen for further analysis.

          Growth of copper gallium diselenide nanoparticles
The above procedure was also used for the growth of CuGaSe2 except that 0.4 mmol of Ga(iPr2PSe2)3] were used instead of In(iPr2PSe2)3] and the reaction was carried out at 250 °C.

          Growth of copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) nanoparticles
The growth of the CIGS nanocrystals was carried out by the same procedure as for CuInSe2. However, different molar ratios of the indium and gallium precursors were used to obtain various stoichiometric combinations of CIGS nanomaterials. Details of the molar equivalents of indium and gallium precursors used in the reaction and stoichiometric combinations of the materials obtained are given in Table 1. In all cases, reaction temperature for growth of CIGS nanocrystals was maintained at 250 °C.

Results and discussions
The ligand salt [HNEt3][iPr2PSe2] was synthesized using the literature procedure.30 However, it was observed that whilst attempting synthesis of (HNEt3)(iPr2PSe2), the formation of a side product adversely affects the yield of reaction. This product was isolated as reddish coloured octahedral crystals and later characterized as bis(diisopropylselenophosphinyl)-diselenide. Synthesis of this product has already been carried out but under different conditions.30 The use of a 20% excess of triethylamine significantly improved the yield probably by ensuring the availability of the [HNEt3]+ counter-ion to stabilize the [iPr2PSe2]− anion.
Diisoprpyldiselenophosphinatometal (metal = Cu, In, Ga) complexes were synthesized by the metathesis reaction of the ligand with the metal halides in methanol. The ligand salt easily dissociates in methanol producing the [iPr2PSe2]− anion, which readily reacts with metal salts to produce complexes in high yield and with good purity. The one step reactions between methanolic solution of ligand and methanolic or aqueous solution of metal halide were conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
The colloidal approach for synthesis of nanoparticles was used in this work which involved thermolysis of precursors at the desired temperature. Rapid injection of the precursors (suspended in a suitable solvente.g.TOP) into the coordinating solvent resulted in burst of nucleation. The small nuclei then grow in size until their surface is capped by the coordinating solvent, thus inhibiting further growth of the nanocrystals. Growth temperature and reaction duration were judiciously controlled as they have significant effect on the size and morphologies of the nanoparticles.
Optical (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy was used to study the optoelectronic properties of the material. Fig. 1a shows UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of HDA capped CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2nanoparticles. CuGaSe2, CuInSe2 and CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 absorption curves show band edge at 567 nm, 890 nm and 828 nm, respectively while their corresponding bulk materials have band edge at 729 nm, 1200 nm and 1000 nm, respectively. This hypsochromic shift in the band edge indicates the presence of significant quantum confinement because of nanosized crystals.

        Copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) nanoparticles were grown by thermolysis of 1:4 molar ratios of copper precursor and indium precursor in HDA at temperatures ranging from 120 to 210 °C in the HDA/TOP system. Immediately after injection of precursor's suspension (in TOP) into preheated HDA, the reactants turn dark brown indicating the formation of CuInSe2 nuclei which undergo Ostwald ripening to grow into nanocrystals. Work up of the reaction yielded well formed, monodispersed spherical particles. The size of the nanoparticles obtained depends upon the growth temperature and the reaction durations employed.
Vis/NIR absorption spectra of CuInSe2 nanoparticles grown at different reaction temperatures are presented in Fig. 1b. The absorption curves typically show a broad shoulder with a trail in long wavelength direction. It was evident that the absorption band edge exhibits a bathochromic shift from 850 nm to 1050 nm, indicating increase in the particle size, as the reaction temperatures are increased from 120 °C to 210 °C. Gardner and co-workers have also described an increase in the size of colloidal nanoparticles at increased reaction time, temperature or by decreasing the amount of capping ligand.32 The red shift of the band edge of nanoparticles obtained at higher temperature may be attributed to more pronounced Ostwald ripening at higher temperatures. These results also suggest that the size of the quantum dots can be tuned by judicious selection of the reaction temperature.

Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of HDA capped CuInSe2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2. p-XRD analysis revealed the deposition of the tetragonal CuInSe2 phase (standard ICDD pattern 00-040-1487) for the nanoparticles prepared at all the temperatures (120–210 °C). This is in fair agreement with previous reports as tetragonal chalcopyrite structure is the most often observed crystallographic arrangement in the case of ternary Cu-chalcogenides.33 No extra peaks were observed in the diffraction pattern which indicates the absence of any significant impurity or binary phase in the materials obtained.

In all cases, preferred orientation of the materials along the (112) plane was observed. Similar materials having preferred orientation along the (112) plane have been obtained by many groups.26,27 p-XRD peaks appeared narrower and sharper for materials obtained at higher growth temperatures which indicate gradual increase in the size of nanoparticles obtained. The Scherrer formula was employed to calculate the size of the nanoparticles. Data from 112 diffraction peak were used for calculation of the size of nanocrystallites and the results obtained gave slightly smaller sizes than the same determined from TEM images. The diameter of the nanoparticles grown at 180 °C for instance was found to be 4.14 nm by the Scherrer equation while the average mean diameter of the particles revealed by TEM images was 4.9 ± 0.6 nm. EDX analysis showed that as prepared CuInSe2 nanocrystals had slightly Cu deficient stochiometry, the Cu/In ratio being 0.94:1. Slightly Cu-deficient composition of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 absorbers is favorable for photovoltaic applications as it favors the formation of ordered vacancy or ordered defect compound (OVC/ODC).6

Fig. 3a–d show TEM images of HDA capped CuInSe2 nanoparticles grown at 180 °C. Monodispersed spherical particles with a mean particle diameter of 4.9 ± 0.6 nm are clearly visible in TEM images. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 3e) showed lattice fringes and interplanar distance for these lattice fringes was found to be 3.3 Å which is characteristic of the (111) plane of the tetragonal CuInSe2. Fig. 3f shows selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the dots which manifests that the material obtained is polycrystalline in nature. A histogram showing the size distribution of the quantum dots is given in the inset, which demonstrates that the CuInSe2 quantum dots grown in this study are fairly monodispersed.

Thermolysis of 1:4 molar ratios of the copper precursor [Cu4(iPr2PSe2)4] and the gallium precursor [Ga(iPr2PSe2)3], in HDA gave monodispersed and predominantly spherical copper gallium diselenide (CuGaSe2) nanoparticles. The p-XRD pattern of HDA capped CuGaSe2 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 4. Analysis of the p-XRD pattern showed growth of the tetragonal phase of CuGaSe2 material corresponding to the standard ICDD pattern 00-035-1100. An intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 27.77° is seen for the (112) plane of the tetragonal crystal lattice. Other prominent peaks observed in the diffraction pattern appear at 2θ = 46.11° and 54.23° which can be indexed to the (220)/(204) and the (312)/(116) planes of the tetragonal chalcopyrite crystal lattice, respectively. No diffraction peaks for binary phases of CuSe and GaSe were observed in the diffraction pattern. The appearance of sharp diffraction peaks was indicative of the relatively larger size of the nanoparticles. The Scherrer formula was used to calculate the size of the quantum dots and the calculated size was found to be 14.8 nm.

Representative TEM images for as grown CuGaSe2 quantum dots are shown in Fig. 5a–d, while the histogram (given in inset) shows size distribution of the nanoparticles. In these TEM images, well passivated and fairly spaced quantum dots with somewhat spherical morphology and narrow size distribution are evident. Previously, there have been very few reports of the growth of phase pure, monodispersed CuGaSe2 nanoparticles. The mean size of the nanoparticles was found to be 13.5 ± 2.9 nm which agrees well with the size calculated by the Scherrer formula. The morphology of the particles not being perfectly spherical also contributed towards deviation from mean size. Despite repeated attempts, lattice fringes could not be seen for this material.

The growth of CuInxGa1−xSe2nanoparticles was carried out using an approach similar to that for growth of CuGaSe2 nanocrystals, but in this case varying molar ratios of the In to Ga precursor were used to obtain different stoichiometric compositions of CIGS materials. A brief summary of the combination of precursors used and stoichiometric compositions of CIGS materials obtained after reaction is given in Table 1.
It was possible to tune the In/Ga ratio across the whole range of compositions with x values from 0 to 1 using this approach. However, more gallium precursor was required than theoretically calculated to obtain a desired stoichiometric combination. For instance, when equimolar ratios of copper and indium precursors were used in the reaction, the material obtained was CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 and to obtain CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2, 0.4 mmol of gallium precursor were used with 0.2 mmol of In precursor. Gallium rich composition CuIn0.4Ga0.6Se2 was obtained when 0.5 mmol of the Ga precursor and 0.2 mmol of the In precursor were used in the reaction. Standard ICDD patterns were not available for stoichiometric combinations obtained by using 0.1 mmol and 0.8 mmol of the Ga precursor with 0.2 mmol of In precursor.
Previously, Korgel et al. have obtained different stoichiometric compositions of CIGS material, by using a route that involved direct combination of Cu, In and Ga salts and solid Se in a flask containing oleylamine and subsequent heating to 240 °C for 4 hours.27 In their work, they have obtained In:Ga ratio of the nanocrystals which were consistent with the mole ratios of In and Ga in the reaction mixture. However, many others have pointed out that in various approaches used for synthesis of CuInxGa1−xSe2, the formation of Ga-containing phases would require relatively longer reaction times and/or higher temperatures than those employed for deposition of indium containing phases.34 This means that initially CuInSe2 is formed but at some later stage of the reaction, Ga atoms start replacing In atoms in the matrix. Therefore, longer reaction times and higher temperatures might yield stoichiometric combinations of the CIGS material that are consistent with the molar ratios of In and Ga precursors used in the reaction. However, these reaction conditions in our experiments resulted in the formation of bulk materials which were not dispersible in commonly used non-polar solvents.

Fig. 6 shows p-XRD data for CIGS nanoparticles grown by thermolyzing different molar ratios of Ga and In precursors. The amount of the copper precursor was the same in all reactions. It was evident from analysis of the p-XRD patterns that the diffraction peaks were clearly assignable to the tetragonal chalcopyrite crystallographic phase of CIGS material. Relatively broad peaks were obtained which are indicative of crystallite size in the nano-size domain. In all cases, a preferential orientation along the (112) plane was observed, while other prominent peaks originate from (204)/(220) and (312) plane of the lattice. Absence of any other diffraction peak suggests phase purity of the material. As Ga increases in the material, a gradual shift of diffraction peaks to higher 2θ is observed. The relatively smaller Ga atoms substitute In atoms in the lattice, resulting in gradual change of lattice parameters.

Vegard's law states that the lattice constant c should be a linear function of the composition variable x. The lattice parameters c were calculated from p-XRD patterns shown in Fig. 6 for each composition of CuIn(1−x)GaxSe2, and the same are given in Table 1. Indium has a relatively larger ionic radius than gallium, hence the lattice parameters of the CIGS alloys increase with increased In content. A plot of the gallium concentration variable x [Ga/(Ga + In)], as determined from the EDX analysis of the CIGS nanoparticles, versus the lattice parameter c is shown in Fig. 7. The lattice parameters c measured from the p-XRD patterns are in fair agreement with the Vegard's law. Values of the lattice parameters increase linearly with the decreasing gallium composition (increasing indium composition), confirming the formation of a homogeneous alloy structure. The accuracy of the lattice parameter c versusindium content curve suggests that it may be used to determine the indium and gallium concentrations of CIGS samples with unknown In:Ga ratio.

The p-XRD of the indium rich phase of CIGS (CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2) corresponded to the standard ICDD pattern 00-35-1102, and that of CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2 corresponded to 00-040-1488 whilst the gallium rich phase CuIn0.4Ga0.6Se2 corresponded to the standard ICDD pattern 00-035-1101. Shifting of diffraction angles to higher values of 2θ can be more clearly visible in Fig. 8, where magnification of the (112) peak from the corresponding p-XRD pattern is shown along with standard ICDD patterns for various stoichiometric compositions of the CIGS materials. Within the error limits of the EDX technique, the In:Ga ratio of the nanocrystals determined by the EDX analysis coincides with that calculated from the lattice parameter c. No noticeable differences in particle to particle Cu:In:Ga ratio were observed in EDX measurements on different nanoparticles in the same sample.

Fig. 9(a–d) show TEM images of tetragonal CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2quantum dots with an average diameter of 14 nm. This value is consistent with the particle size evaluated for this sample by the Scherrer equation from powder XRD data. Both HRTEM and p-XRD data confirm that the nanoparticles are crystalline. The d-spacing observed in the HRTEM images is consistent with the (112) plane of tetragonal CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2. Fig. 9e shows the SAED pattern of the CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2nanoparticles which clearly demonstrates polycrystalline nature of the sample. The histogram depicting the size distribution for CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2quantum dots is shown in Fig. 9f. The average diameter is 14 (±2.2) nm.

Conclusions
In this study the colloidal synthesis of metal chalcogenides CuInSe2, CuGaSe2 and CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) as quantum dots from diisopropyldiselenophosphinatometal precursors has been demonstrated. It was observed that the size of the nanoparticles obtained could be tuned by judicious selection of growth temperature, reaction time and precursor concentration. It was shown that by suitable adjustment of molar precursor ratios, materials with desired stoichiometric combinations may also be obtained. This work may further be extended to the synthesis of other I–III–VI materials such as AgInSe2, AgGaSe2 and AgIn/GaSe2.
