    , Accepted 4th December 2017First published on 5th December 2017AbstractMethylammonium lead-iodide (MAPbI3, MA: CH3–NH3) interfaced with rutile TiO2 is widely used in photovoltaic devices. These devices utilize the electron transfer from MAPbI3 to TiO2, which may not be explained solely by the band structures of the two bulk materials. To elucidate the interface dynamics and its impact on the electron transfer process, we have studied the interfacial features of a TiO2/MAPbI3 system. First principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the rotational freedom of MA present within the bulk is considerably suppressed due to interaction of MA with the TiO2 substrate, highlighting orientationally ordered MA at the interface. The optimized interface structure shows the C–N axis of MA titled towards the TiO2 surface so as to maximize the interaction between N-attached H and underlying O. The very short O⋯H⋯N distance with very large hydrogen bonding energy identifies short strong hydrogen bonding (SSHB) as the origin of structural re-organization at the interface. As for the electronic structure, this proton sharing between MA and TiO2 has a critical impact on the energy level alignment at the interface, thus driving the electron transfer process from MA to TiO2. Indeed, significant reduction in the electron transfer barrier is observed for the energetically optimal interface configuration which promotes the electron transfer across the interface and photovoltaic properties.
1. Introduction
The search for viable and competitive photovoltaic technology has seen a tremendous boost due to the development of metal halide perovskite based solar cell devices.1–7 The metal halide materials have an ABX3 type perovskite structure, where A represents the organic cation, B is the metal cation, and X denotes the halide anion.8 These materials possess desirable properties for photovoltaic applications such as ambipolar transport, high charge mobility, a tunable band gap, and a high absorption co-efficient.9–11 As a consequence, a rapid rise in power conversion efficiency has been reported for halide perovskite based devices, with the maximum values exceeding 22%.12,13
Within a solar cell device, the electron transport material (ETM) and hole transport material (HTM) are incorporated alongside the halide perovskite to facilitate the charge (electron and hole) separation process at the respective interfaces.14 Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the ETM/perovskite interface is crucial for elucidating the electron transfer process across the interface and its influence on the photovoltaic properties.15 Consequently, a number of studies have focused on the ETM/perovskite interface,14–20 where in accordance with actual photovoltaic devices, TiO2 is used as the ETM, while MAPbI3 based halides are chosen as perovskite materials. It is well known that the organic cations (MA) within halide perovskites exhibit rotational freedom under the cell's actual operating conditions, particularly in the cubic phase.21,22 In bulk MAPbI3, the rotational freedom of MA has a subtle impact on the electronic structure and photovoltaic properties: the band gap becomes indirect for an energetically optimum MA orientation, thus impeding the charge recombination.23 However, the impact of varying MA orientations on the TiO2/perovskite interface dynamics has not been adequately addressed so far. In particular, it is not as yet clear how the interactions with the TiO2 surface affect the rotational freedom of MA molecules at the interface. Moreover, while MA energy states lie well away from band edges within the bulk, the influence of MA orientation on the interface electronic structure has largely been ignored.
Thus, we have studied the interface between TiO2 and cubic MAPbI3 by employing density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To circumvent the problem of MA rotations, we make use of recent neutron diffraction results that the edge [011], face [100] and diagonal [111] directions are the preferred MA orientations within the cubic phase.21 The predominance of these MA orientations has also been confirmed by quasielastic neutron scattering.24 We therefore use these three orientations to describe the MAPbI3 cubic phase. Specifically, we have performed a comparative study for the three models of TiO2/MAPbI3 interfaces where each constituent MAPbI3 slab adopts one of the above mentioned orientations as the starting configuration (Fig. 1a–c). We show that the structural re-arrangement of MA at the interface is drastically different from that of the bulk and is intimately related to the electron transfer process taking place at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface.

2. Computational section
All calculations were performed using the plane wave pseudo-potential approach as implemented in the VASP code.25 A cutoff of 520 eV has been used for the expansion of the plane waves while Brillouin zone sampling of the interface is performed by using a 6 × 6 × 1 k-mesh. For the exchange correlation functional, a generalized gradient appraoch (GGA) has been employed in PBE parameterization.26 Moreover, van der Waals (vdW) interactions are taken into account by using Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) dispersion correction,27 which describes the structural properties of the perovskite halides correctly.28 For a consistent description of interface electronic properties, we have employed a hybrid HSE06 exchange correlation functional.29 Moreover, the impact of spin–orbit correction (SOC) is also studied. The corresponding results for the GGA are provided in the ESI,† which is known to provide a qualitatively similar trend to experiments.14,15
During structural relaxation, the convergence criteria for forces were set to 0.025 eV Å−1. Besides DFT calculations, we also performed AIMD simulations to fully describe the dynamics of MA molecules at the interface. AIMD simulations were performed for 30 ps with a time step 0.5 fs at 330 K (cubic phase) using a Nosé thermostat, where initially 15 ps was used for thermalization. We note that the net time span used here should be sufficient to adequately describe the MA rotational motion, as experiments show that the residence time of MA within the given configuration is ∼4 ps.30
The rutile phase of TiO2 has been chosen in line with some experimental studies which suggest improved photovoltaic properties in this phase as compared to that of anatase.31,32 In particular, the rutile (001) surface, which becomes more prevalent in the device configuration, is chosen, and it is also suitable with regards to the lattice mismatch issue (see below). Besides, MAPbI3 is represented by an energetically favorable (001) surface.33 We note that during structural relaxation the [100] direction of MA is somewhat unstable and as a result MA is slightly tilted towards the z axis.23 However, at the terminated surface, this tilt angle is small (∼5°) so it still provides reasonable description for the [100] orientation.
The TiO2/MAPbI3 interface is modeled by using a supercell comprising 11 layers of the rutile (001) surface, 3 stoichiometric layers (36 atoms) of the MAPbI3 (001) surface, and a vacuum region of ∼15 Å. Since the main aim of this study is to understand the role of MA orientation in TiO2/MAPbI3 interface properties, we have used MAI termination of MAPbI3 where the MA molecule is present at the interface. This termination may also be energetically the most favorable one at the (001) surface as indicated by recent studies.34 The problem of lattice mismatch is addressed by using a  R45 unit cell of the TiO2 (001) surface which reduces the lattice mismatch to a reasonable value (∼3%) (see ESI, Fig. S1†). Finally, to know the interface separation (Ti⋯I distance), the total energy was calculated as a function of TiO2–MAPbI3 slab distance. For all cases, the optimum distance was found to be ∼3.0 Å which is used as the starting interface separation for structural optimization.
3. Results and discussion
We compare the initial and optimized (fully relaxed) TiO2/MAPbI3 interface structures for three MA orientations, namely [011], [100] and [111] in Fig. 1a–c. While the orientation of MA at the interface can be significantly different from that of the initial bulk due to optimization, we nevertheless use the initial MA orientation to describe the optimized structures for reference. For the case of [011], the interface geometry remains largely the same since MA retains its initial orientation after the structural optimization. However for the [100] orientation, a noticeable change is observed; the N end of the C–N axis which was initially slightly tilted away from the TiO2 surface, moves towards it. Moreover, significant changes can also be observed for the interface with the [111] MA starting orientation, where the NH3 group of MA, which was initially pointing towards the diagonal (i.e., away from TiO2), moves significantly towards TiO2.

Table 1 quantifies the structural and adsorption properties of the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. The Ti⋯I distance is the shortest for the [111] case (2.88 Å), while it is the longest for the [011] (>3.0 Å). The difference in structural arrangements for different interfaces is even more evident when we compare the vertical distances between underlying O and nearest neighbor H (O⋯H distance) of the MA molecule. For the [011] initial configuration, this distance is very large (>4.5 Å) and consequently shows negligible change (value given in parentheses) due to structural optimization. The O⋯H distance for [100] is significantly reduced to 2.52 Å in comparison to the starting configuration. However, the most drastic changes are observed for the [111] orientation where the optimized O⋯H distance is 1.58 Å, exhibiting a reduction of ∼1.80 Å from the starting configuration. These results indicate that the interfacial structural properties are strongly dependent on the MA orientation at the interface. In particular, shorter bond lengths are obtained when the NH3 group within the MA molecule is tilted towards the TiO2 surface (such as the [111] case), suggesting stronger interfacial interactions. This inference is confirmed by comparing the binding energies for the three TiO2/MAPbI3 interfaces (Table 1). The interface with the [011] MA orientation has the smallest binding energy, suggesting weaker binding. Consistent with structural data (bond lengths), the largest binding energy is obtained for the interface with the bulk MA orientation of [111]. The interface with the [100] MA orientation is more stable than [011] by 0.18 eV. This difference is much more pronounced for the [111] case which is more stable than the interfaces with MA starting orientations of [100] and [011] by 0.28 and 0.46 eV, respectively. It is interesting to note that this energy difference is an order of magnitude larger than the thermal energy. Thus, the orientational freedom present within the bulk in the cubic phase is significantly curtailed at the interface with TiO2. Specifically, the C–N axis of MA prefers to align in such a way that the NH3 group is tilted towards underlying TiO2, so as to minimize the O⋯H distance at the interface. Consequently, the [011] orientation with the NH3 group pointing well away from the TiO2 surface is energetically unfavorable, despite being a more preferred orientation in the bulk.23

In addition to the DFT results at the stationary states, we performed AIMD calculations using the most stable interface structure (Fig. 1c) as the starting configuration to fully elucidate the MA dynamics within the cubic phase (330 K in consideration of the actual device operating temperature). Most crucially, the O⋯H⋯N hydrogen bonding remains intact (ESI, Movie S1†) for the whole simulation period (30 ps among which the last 15 ps was considered for equilibrium analysis), whereas the usual re-orientation time within cubic bulk is ∼4 ps.30 Therefore, these results show the presence of orientationally ordered MA at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface in that the O⋯H hydrogen bonding is kept along the interface as opposed to MAPbI3 bulk where the MA orientation is not pinned in any particular direction.
It is also important to point out that besides the DFT-TS method, other techniques are also available for the inclusion of vdW interactions.35 Therefore, to confirm the validity of our results, we also studied the interface dynamics with the DFT-D method.36 However, similar to the case of bulk MAPbI3,23 DFT-D correction provided an essentially similar description of MA rotational freedom as the DFT-TS method: the MA away from the interface exhibits bulk like rotational freedom, while at the interface MA rotational freedom is curtailed due to the presence of SSHB. Therefore, we emphasize that our results are reliable with regard to the vdW correction employed.
As evident from the data presented in Fig. 2, S2† and Table 1, the H in the positively charged NH3+ group tries to maximize its interaction with the O of the TiO2 substrate. The O⋯H hydrogen bonding distance is very short (∼1.47 Å) and it brings about a sizeable change in binding energy (∼0.3–0.5 eV). Also, as shown in Fig. 2, both O⋯H and N⋯H distances range from 1.1–1.8 Å and 1.0–1.5 Å, respectively, thus showing large variance (σ(O–H) = 0.13 Å, σ(N–H) = 0.06 Å). Moreover, the N⋯O distance ranges from 2.3 to 2.8 Å having an average value of ∼2.56 Å and variance σ(N⋯O) = 0.08 Å. This indicates that a proton (H+) frequently shuttles between N and O atoms, demonstrating the presence of very robust short strong hydrogen bonding (SSHB)37–39 due to cationic hydrogen bonding between O and cationic CH3NH3+ at the interface. In short, this SSHB is quite different from the typical hydrogen bonding in that the O–H distance is very short (∼1.2–1.6 Å) with a large binding energy (∼1 eV) (as compared with the typical hydrogen binding energy of ∼0.2 eV) due to positively charged H-bonding where H+ is populated both near N and O.40 Consequently, the SSHB is much stronger than the normal hydrogen bonding present in bulk MAPbI3 and the thermal fluctuations cannot be strong enough to break the O⋯H⋯N hydrogen bond, which suppresses the orientational disorder of MA molecules. It is interesting to note that the H–O distance obtained from AIMD simulation (1.47 Å) is slightly shorter than the optimal distance from DFT energy minimization (1.58 Å), against the typical increase in the hydrogen bond distance with increasing temperature. This phenomenon can be understood from the inset of Fig. 2, where the binding energy profile for the interaction between MA and the TiO2 surface with respect to the O⋯H distance [d(O⋯H)] shows a nearly flat potential surface reflecting a hidden double-well shape, with the lowest minimum at d = 1.58 Å and the secondary minimum shoulder around d = 1.1 Å. Thus, the MD simulated O⋯H average distance (∼1.47 Å) showing a wide ranging population in the range of 1.0–1.7 Å (in Fig. 2 inset) is shorter than the O⋯H distance at the minimum potential energy (d = 1.58 Å).
 Fig. 2  2D Contour plot of bond lengths d(O⋯H) and d(N⋯H) from ab initio MD simulations. A wide-ranging distribution of d(O⋯H) around the average values of d(O⋯H) = 1.47 Å and d(N⋯H) = 1.15 Å reflects a widely deep and almost flat potential well of SSHB. Indeed, the binding energy profile (inset) for the interaction between MA and a fragment of the TiO2 surface with respect to the O⋯H distance [d(O⋯H)] shows a nearly flat potential surface reflecting a hidden double-well shape, with the lowest minimum (−1.0 eV) at d = 1.58 Å and the secondary minimum shoulder (−0.8 eV) around d = 1.1 Å for the given N⋯O distance of 2.65 Å corresponding to the structure at the minimum energy potential. 
Apart from the SSHB, the weaker hydrogen bonding between N-attached H and I which is present in the bulk,41 should also help to further stabilize the interface. Indeed, the DFT calculated average distance between interface I and H atoms (that are not attached to O) is ∼2.70 Å, close to the bulk value. Therefore, as MA molecules tilt towards the TiO2 surface, the interface I atoms also move alongside H atoms due to I⋯H hydrogen bonding, which should reduce the I⋯Ti distance for the optimum configuration. A similar effect has been observed in a recent STM study on the MAPbI3 surface which highlighted the electrostatic interaction between N-attached H and I atoms.42
We discuss the interfacial electronic properties. In order to ascertain the role of the MA orientation on the electronic structure of the TiO2/MAPbI3 system, we have calculated the density of states (DOS) as shown in Fig. 3a–c. For the better assessment of the electronic structure, we have employed the hybrid HSE06 functional while the corresponding results with the GGA are provided in the ESI (Fig. S3†). For the [011] MA orientation, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the combined system belongs to MAPbI3, while the valence band maximum (VBM) consists of mixed TiO2 and MAPbI3 states. For the [100] orientation, the energy level alignment remains qualitatively the same for the conduction bands, though the offset between conduction band minima is considerably reduced, while an opposite trend is observed for the offset between valence bands maxima. In contrast, energy level alignment for [111] is significantly different from that for [011]: the CBM of the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface is dominated by TiO2 states while the VBM mainly consists of MAPbI3, lying at considerably higher energy than that of the [011] case. Therefore, the comparison of DOS for each interface clearly indicates that the interface electronic structure is strongly influenced by the MA orientation at the interface. In particular, a systematic lowering of TiO2 bands is observed in comparison to MAPbI3, as the interface MA orientation changes from [011] to [111]. We would like to point out that a similar behavior is also observed for the electronic structure calculated with the GGA, even after the inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) (see ESI, Fig. S3 and S4†). To obtain further insight into these findings, the projected density of states (PDOS) for the interface atoms are shown in Fig. 3d–f. For the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface with the [011] MA orientation (Fig. 3d), the CBM is dominated by Pb states while contributions from other atoms are at much higher energies, and the VBM is dominated by O and I states. As the interfacial interactions increase (going from [011] to [111]) this feature is pushed to higher energies. Finally, for energetically most favorable structure ([111]), the CBM consists mainly of Ti, while the VBM corresponds to the combination of I and Pb states of MAPbI3.
 Fig. 3  DOS of the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. Contributions from TiO2 and MAPbI3 at the interface are shown for MA orientations of (a) [011], (b) [100] and (c) [111], which are based on HSE06 calculations. The corresponding PDOS are presented in (d–f). 
The electronic states due to MA molecules are well away from band edges, similar to the case of bulk MAPbI3. This indicates that the observed shifts of the CBM (or the VBM) due to change in MA orientation are not due to the direct contribution from MA states to DOS. In fact, these changes may arise from the indirect effect of MA orientation at the interface, i.e., shortening of bond lengths. Owing to the shorter TiO2–MAPbI3 interface distance for the case of the energetically favorable [111] structure (Table 1), the interface hybridization is stronger, which may contribute to the energy level shifts observed in Fig. 3f, in comparison to the weakly interacting interface with the [011] MA orientation (Fig. 3d). Such a hybridization induced energy level shift of DOS has recently been observed also for the C60/MAPbI3 interface.34 In contrast, what is more important in this work is that the proximity of H+ to the TiO2 surface due to SSHB should strongly influence the interface energy level alignment as observed in Fig. 3, which has never been discussed before (see below). It is because a proton gain (loss) of MAPbI3 (TiO2) shows a similar effect to the electron loss (gain) of MAPbI3 (TiO2) in the materials electron correlation diagram since an extra proton into MAPbI3 takes an electron from the VBM of MAPbI3.

Fig. 4 schematically highlights the impact of MA orientation dependent electronic structure on the electron transfer process at TiO2/MAPbI3 interfaces. For a more realistic comparison with the experimental results, the conduction band offsets calculated by HSE06 after the inclusion of SOC correction (ESI, S4†) are also shown.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the electron transfer process at the interface for MA orientations of (a) [011], (b) [100], (c) energetically most favorable [111] and (d) a similar case to [111] but d(O⋯H) is reduced to 1.20 Å. Horizontal solid lines represent VBMs (red) and CBMs (blue), while dashed vertical lines depict the interface. Conduction band offsets (up–down arrow) calculated by HSE06 including SOC correction are also shown where negative values (in eV) suggest a barrier. Electrons are excited from the valence to the conduction band of MAPbI3 (solid arrow). For [011] and [100] MA orientations, electron transfer is not possible due to the presence of a sizeable energy barrier. However, the electron transfer from MAPbI3 to TiO2 for the optimized [111] interface is facilitated (dashed arrow) in the absence of a barrier between the respective CBMs at the interface. As d(O⋯H) is reduced further (d), alignment of CBMs becomes even more favorable for electron transfer. At the bottom, the hydrogen bonding scenario between electropositive (N-attached) H and O is depicted for each interface where d(O⋯H) is represented by blue dotted lines. In the [011] case (a), H+ is well away from the TiO2 surface, so there is no interfacial hydrogen bonding. The d(O⋯H) reduces in the [100] MA orientation though the interaction is still weak. In the [111] MA orientation (c), d(O⋯H) is very short and comparable to d(N⋯H) due to SSHB. As a result of the proximity of H+ to the TiO2 surface, the TiO2 energy levels are shifted to lower energy, thus facilitating the electron transfer across the interface. By reducing d(O⋯H) further (d), the O⋯H bond becomes stronger than the N⋯H bond and the H+ proximity to TiO2 increases even more. Thus, the CBM offset becomes more favorable for electron transfer as compared to the [111] case (c). 
In general, electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band of MAPbI3 as a result of light absorption. At the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface, electrons are transferred from the CBM of MAPbI3 to that of TiO2. Therefore, the electron transfer from MAPbI3 to TiO2 is energetically feasible only if the CBM of TiO2 is not present at a significantly higher energy than that of MAPbI3. For the case of the [011] orientation, since the MAPbI3 CBM is at markedly lower energy than that of TiO2 (Fig. 4a), the electron transfer process is strongly impeded in the presence of an energy barrier at the interface. The interface with the [100] MA orientation (Fig. 4b) presents a similar situation, though the band offsets are reduced in comparison to the [011] case. On the other hand, for the optimized structure obtained from the initial [111] orientation, the CBM now consists of mixed states from TiO2 and MAPbI3. This suggests that virtually no barrier exists at the interface which facilitates the electron transfer process (Fig. 4c). Therefore, on the whole, we observe a significant reduction in the electron transfer barrier as the MA orientation changes from [011] to [111]. As discussed earlier, the proton (H+) in the NH3+ group of MA within this configuration is slightly transferred from MA to TiO2, and so the H+ is actually almost shared by both TiO2 and MAPbI3 (note that the proton behaves in terms of electronic state opposite to the electron). Then, the CBM and VBM of TiO2 are lowered due to proximity with proton (electropositive H). This results in a relatively favorable energy level alignment for the electron transfer process at the interface as indicated in Fig. 4c. To further highlight the connection between proton proximity and interfacial energy level alignment, we performed an additional calculation with an interface configuration similar to the optimized [111] case, but with reduced O⋯H distance (1.20 Å) thus making the O⋯H bond stronger than that of N⋯H. As shown schematically in Fig. 4d, this leads to an increased CBM offset as compared to [111] (Fig. 4c). Evidently, higher proton (H+) proximity provides a more favorable energy level alignment for electron transfer. Interestingly, despite some quantitative differences, a similar downward shift of TiO2 states is also observed with GGA/GGA + SOC calculations (ESI, Fig. S3 and S4†), suggesting a significant reduction in the electron transfer barrier for the optimum [111] orientation. This is understandable since these changes are brought due to the proximity of (H+) of MA to the TiO2 surface in the [111] case, an effect that should be qualitatively captured by GGA + vdW functionals. Finally, we point out that a similar tuning of donor/acceptor levels through an organic molecule at the interface is widely exploited in organic solar cells.43 Such an effect is not expected to be strong for perovskite halide solar cells since MA is not pinned in any particular direction in the bulk. However, the presence of SSHB reduces the orientational disorder at the interface and enables a significant reduction in the conduction band offset between TiO2 and MAPbI3.
It is important to compare these results with the experimental findings: the value of the conduction band offset for the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface measured from photoemission spectroscopy varies from zero (degenerate CBMs) to 0.40 eV.15,44,45 Furthermore, optical measurements even suggest the possibility of an energy barrier at the interface.46 Thus, while the calculated CBM offset (∼nearly zero) for the optimum interface is within the experimental range (Fig. 4c), it is rather difficult to provide a precise comparison due to diversity of the experimental results. We thus emphasize the main qualitative finding of this work: the electronic transfer barrier at the interface is dependent on the MA orientation. In particular, the barrier is considerably reduced for the SSHB driven optimum interface which facilitates the electron transfer process and hence the photovoltaic performance as compared to other energetically unfavorable orientations.
This work highlights two critical aspects pertaining to the energetically optimum interface between TiO2 and MAPbI3. Firstly, the MA orientational disorder at the interface is considerably reduced as compared to the bulk. In fact, the SSHB energies are responsible for an orientationally ordered MA at the interface. This finding is consistent with the experimental observation of the Stark effect in these systems, which suggests the presence of ‘ordered dipoles’ at the interface.47 Secondly, we show that the MA orientation at the interface gives a critical impact on the energy level alignment. Evidently, the impact of MA orientation not only goes well beyond the local structural re-arrangement at the interface but also is directly linked to the interface electronic structure and photovoltaic properties. It is also important to relate the main findings of this work to the different configurations that may be employed in actual devices. For example, anatase TiO2 is a widely used material for electron transport medium/hole blocking layers.48 Similar to this work, previous DFT studies on anatase TiO2/MAPbI3 have also highlighted the importance of (H–O) hydrogen bonding in the interface stabilization.47 In the light of the results discussed in the current manuscript, such hydrogen bonding at the interface will increase the proton proximity of TiO2, resulting in improved interfacial electron transfer. However, quantitatively, this mechanism will also depend on other factors such as the nature of the TiO2 surface (stoichiometry, topography and composition), lattice mismatch etc. Since organic molecules play a key role in interface stabilization and the electron transfer process, it is important to reduce MA vacancies at the interface arising from either decomposition of organic molecules during deposition or grain boundaries Conversely, iodine vacancies at the interface can be exploited to reduce the orientational freedom of MA molecules further.49 Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of hybrid perovskite based devices can be enhanced by tailoring bonding strength with varying organic molecules at the interface. For example, recent experimental work has exploited the hydrogen to halogen bonding to increase the interfacial coupling between different types of hybrid perovskite materials.50 Such coupling results in a remarkable increase in device stability. Future studies may also focus on exploiting such organic molecule induced interfacial stabilization for tuning the electronic properties of the devices.
4. Conclusion
Here we have shown that the orientational freedom present in bulk MAPbI3 is significantly curtailed at the interface, with optimum interface geometry corresponding to the NH3 group of MA titled toward surface oxygen through SSHB. What is more important is that the proton sharing SSHB in the optimal MA orientation has a critical impact on the interfacial electronic structure; the energetically optimal interface configuration significantly reduces the energy barrier at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface, thus facilitating the electron transfer process within the photovoltaic device.

 	Fig. 1  Initial and relaxed TiO2/MAPbI3 interfaces. (a) [011], (b) [100] and (c) [111] MA orientations. Pb (black), I (purple), C (brown), N (light blue), H (white), Ti (blue) and O (red).	 

011	3.02	4.71 (−0.01)	1.00
100	2.98	2.52 (−0.55)	1.18
111	2.88	1.58 (−1.82)	1.46

 	Fig. 2  2D Contour plot of bond lengths d(O⋯H) and d(N⋯H) from ab initio MD simulations. A wide-ranging distribution of d(O⋯H) around the average values of d(O⋯H) = 1.47 Å and d(N⋯H) = 1.15 Å reflects a widely deep and almost flat potential well of SSHB. Indeed, the binding energy profile (inset) for the interaction between MA and a fragment of the TiO2 surface with respect to the O⋯H distance [d(O⋯H)] shows a nearly flat potential surface reflecting a hidden double-well shape, with the lowest minimum (−1.0 eV) at d = 1.58 Å and the secondary minimum shoulder (−0.8 eV) around d = 1.1 Å for the given N⋯O distance of 2.65 Å corresponding to the structure at the minimum energy potential.	 

 	Fig. 3  DOS of the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. Contributions from TiO2 and MAPbI3 at the interface are shown for MA orientations of (a) [011], (b) [100] and (c) [111], which are based on HSE06 calculations. The corresponding PDOS are presented in (d–f).	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the electron transfer process at the interface for MA orientations of (a) [011], (b) [100], (c) energetically most favorable [111] and (d) a similar case to [111] but d(O⋯H) is reduced to 1.20 Å. Horizontal solid lines represent VBMs (red) and CBMs (blue), while dashed vertical lines depict the interface. Conduction band offsets (up–down arrow) calculated by HSE06 including SOC correction are also shown where negative values (in eV) suggest a barrier. Electrons are excited from the valence to the conduction band of MAPbI3 (solid arrow). For [011] and [100] MA orientations, electron transfer is not possible due to the presence of a sizeable energy barrier. However, the electron transfer from MAPbI3 to TiO2 for the optimized [111] interface is facilitated (dashed arrow) in the absence of a barrier between the respective CBMs at the interface. As d(O⋯H) is reduced further (d), alignment of CBMs becomes even more favorable for electron transfer. At the bottom, the hydrogen bonding scenario between electropositive (N-attached) H and O is depicted for each interface where d(O⋯H) is represented by blue dotted lines. In the [011] case (a), H+ is well away from the TiO2 surface, so there is no interfacial hydrogen bonding. The d(O⋯H) reduces in the [100] MA orientation though the interaction is still weak. In the [111] MA orientation (c), d(O⋯H) is very short and comparable to d(N⋯H) due to SSHB. As a result of the proximity of H+ to the TiO2 surface, the TiO2 energy levels are shifted to lower energy, thus facilitating the electron transfer across the interface. By reducing d(O⋯H) further (d), the O⋯H bond becomes stronger than the N⋯H bond and the H+ proximity to TiO2 increases even more. Thus, the CBM offset becomes more favorable for electron transfer as compared to the [111] case (c).
