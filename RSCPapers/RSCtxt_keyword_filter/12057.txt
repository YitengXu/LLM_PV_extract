    , Accepted 15th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractFerroelectricity has been reported in organic–inorganic perovskites, and it can enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because ferroelectricity can facilitate charge carrier separation and charge transport through the perovskite layer. However, the existence of ferroelectricity in perovskites has been in hot debate, particularly at room temperature. Here, we report the ferroelectric polarization switching of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 which showed a high dependence on its composition. The ferroelectric behavior of MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 is confirmed with domain switching by Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (PFM) imaging and bias-off “butterfly-like” amplitude loops and piezoresponse hysteresis loops at room temperature. The possible factors, such as film electrical properties attributed to the enhanced room-temperature ferroelectricity in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films are clarified by using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). In addition, the charge separation and charge transport in the perovskite MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films are further investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Finally, the possible influences of polarization orientations, trapping effects and ion migrations within the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films on the J–V characteristics of PSC devices are discussed in detail. It discovers that the polarization switching under the positive tip biased condition in the PSCs with 50% PbBr2, which could hinder the photovoltaic performance. These findings help better understand the electronic structure of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites and provide guidance for the improvement of the PSC performance and other electronic applications of perovskites.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have had significant impact on solar energy research since several years owing to their low fabrication cost and high power conversion efficiencies.1–10 By using composition engineering and/or device engineering approaches, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with good performance reproducibility have been achieved. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) achieved by different labs were 15–22.1%.11,12 Besides the optoelectronic behavior, materials with a perovskite structure can also exhibit interesting ferroelectric properties. Intensive research studies have been devoted to the ferroelectricity of inorganic perovskites, (ABX3), such as PbTiO3,13,14 BaTiO3,15 and BaFeO3.16 Ferroelectric materials can have important applications in many areas. The ferroelectricity of most inorganic perovskites (ABX3, where A and B are cations; and X is the anion) is due to the deviation of the smaller cation, B, from the octahedron center of BX6, thus causing a deviation from the centro-symmetry of the crystal structure. The ferroelectric properties have beneficial effects on the photoelectric properties of inorganic perovskite materials.17–19 The existence of a depolarization field might have a profound influence on charge separation and transport.19,20 It was reported that the photocurrent direction depended on the polarization orientation.20 The ferroelectricity of inorganic perovskites suggests the possible presence of ferroelectricity in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites and significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.21,22
Both theoretical and experimental investigations have been carried out to verify the existence of ferroelectricity in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites like CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3).21–26 However, the mechanism for the ferroelectricity is still controversial. For hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), the X anions of ABX3 are halides, the A cation is CH3NH3+, and the B cation is Pb2+. The A cation has significant influence on the orientational disorder and polarization.21 Certain orientations of CH3NH3+ dipoles could lead to lower lattice symmetry and thus the ferroelectricity of the perovskites. But the theoretically calculated polarization values were vastly different. For example, Frost et al. inferred that bulk MAPbI3 might possess a large polarization value of 38 μC cm−2,21 while it is reported to be only ∼8 μC cm−2 by Fan et al. and others.23,27 In addition, Zheng et al. reported that MAPbI3 was more stable with a antiferroelectric tetragonal structure than its ferroelectric counterpart.27 Ferroelectricity was also observed experimentally. For instance, Kutes and Kim et al. observed the polarization switching behavior in MAPbI3 perovskite films by using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM).25,28,29 In addition, the DC voltages used to orient the domains and the ferroelectric hysteresis loop were ±9 V and ±15 V, respectively. They were much larger than the coercive voltage and might cause electric screening effects and could even trigger the onset of irreversible electrochemical reactions and thus cause fake-ferroelectric properties.30–32 Meanwhile, the occurrence of large current might also have a strong influence on the possible polarization switching behaviour and change the ferroelectric loop shape.33 Some groups argued that there were no ferroelectric-resembling properties in the MAPbI3 perovskite films as weak polarization switching and no hysteresis loops were observed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM).23,34 In addition, the macroscopic P–E hysteresis loops obtained by using a Radiant Precision Workstation showed leakage behavior, which indicated that there was no permanent polarization at room temperature due to the large leakage current.23,35 In order to understand the electronic structure of perovskites and further improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite devices, it is important to study the ferroelectric polarization of perovskite films.
In addition, the possible ferroelectricity of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites can have profound effects on charge carrier separation and transport.20,36 It was reported that the intrinsic built-in electric field generated by the periodically ordered ferroelectric polarization can facilitate the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers at the interfaces between the perovskite and electron-/hole-transport materials.21,37 It was also proposed that charge carriers could transport unimpededly through the “ferroelectric highways”.21 In addition, it is well known that the polarization switching in ferroelectrics could change the electrical conductivity.38,39 Kim et al. found that the grain boundaries with positive charges in MAPb(I0.88Br0.12)3 might suppress the recombination of holes and electrons as revealed by using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM).28 However, it is still unclear for the effects of polarization orientation on the charge carrier dynamic, electrical conductivity dynamic, and light-to-electricity conversion of PSCs. Therefore, it is extremely important to study such correlations. Various characterizations, including electron beam-induced current measurements (EBIC) and KPFM, have been conducted to study the charge carrier dynamic in cross-sections of PSCs.40–42 Because the electron beam is the driving force for the EBIC and the induced current is only the electron beam-excited free electrons and holes, this cannot reveal the actual physics of PSCs.40 KPFM is basically nondestructive and can infer to the local contact potential difference (CPD), i.e., the work function difference between the probe and sample at the nanoscale by tracking the electrostatic force between the probe and sample. The measured CPD distribution can give insights into the location of the charge carrier dynamic due to free charge diffusion or drifting by a series DC writing process.43–45 Moreover, to investigate the induced current and electrical conductivity dynamic in the poling process, C-AFM is usually used to characterize the C-AFM current–voltage (I–V) curves and the changes of the conductivity in thin films.46,47
On the other hand, chemical composition mediation of MAPbI3 by incorporation of Br [MAPb(I1−xBrx)3] is a common way to increase the band gap of iodide-based hybrid perovskites because of the structural distortion in Pb–I bonds due to the introduction of Br.48,49 For example, by tuning the amount of PbBr2 in the precursor, a PCE enhancement can also be achieved in terms of improvement of diffusion lengths and carrier lifetimes, as well as a better stability.50 Beyond that, anomalous hysteresis presented in macroscopic current density–voltage (J–V) curves has been observed in PSC devices by Snaith et al.51 Recently, researchers have done vast studies regarding the J–V hysteresis and attributed this abnormal phenomenon to a few factors, including trapping of charge carriers at the perovskite interface,51,52 migration of charge ions,34,51,53 and the ferroelectric properties of the materials.54–56 However, a clear clue that triggers/removes the hysteresis phenomena is not yet provided.
Hence, in this study, the hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite films are firstly prepared with different amounts of PbBr2 in the precursor (labeled MAPbI3, MAPbI3-10% PbBr2 and MAPbI3-50% PbBr2). The investigations of polarization switching and measurements of hysteresis curves are carried out by using dual AC resonance tracking PFM imaging and conducting piezoresponse force microscopy in spectroscopy mode (PFS) after a series DC poling processes under a certain light illumination. To avoid the screen charges from electrostatic interactions between the PFM tip and sample, and charge injection, as well as artificial effects, certain measurement schemes and parameters for PFM and PFS experiments are established and illustrated in the Experimental part in detail. In addition, KPFM and C-AFM are also employed to correlate the charge carrier dynamic and electrical conductivity dynamic with the ferroelectric properties in organometallic films. Finally, poling processes with an increasing external electric field are conducted prior to the J–V characteristics of PSC devices, so that the performance of PSC devices can be carefully discussed combining the PFM, KPFM and C-AFM results in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films.
Results and discussion
Structure, morphology and absorption of perovskites
In order to achieve credible results, the qualities of the prepared perovskite thin film were firstly examined using various techniques. Perovskite film crystallinity was studied with the XRD technique. As shown in Fig. S1(a),† the MAPbI3 XRD result exhibits strong diffraction peaks at around 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9°, which can be attributed to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase, respectively. This indicates a high crystallinity with the (110) plane being preferentially oriented. For the perovskite films with mixed I and Br, similar XRD patterns were observed. This can be attributed to the smaller energy (∼50 meV) required to insert Br into the crystal lattice. In order to investigate the Br substitution effect on the crystal phase of perovskite films, the patterns in the 2θ range of 26–31° were enlarged. As observed from the zoomed-in XRD spectra, the (004) and (220) crystal planes for the tetragonal I4/mcm phase gradually disappear and change to a single peak (200) [Fig. S1(b)†]. The (200) peak is gradually shifted toward a high 2θ degree due to decreased lattice spacing by substituting larger radius I atoms with smaller Br atoms. This is consistent with the literature which reported that MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 have tetragonal and cubic perovskite phases at room temperature, respectively, and the tetragonal phase of the MAPbI3 may gradually change to a cubic phase upon increasing the Br ratio.50
SEM is employed to check the thin film morphology. As shown in Fig. S2,† the MAPbI3 film is compact with regular crystallites. The incorporation of Br could affect the surface morphology of the perovskite films. Although the incorporation of 10% Br does not affect the morphology significantly, plate-like crystals were observed for the film with 50% Br.
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite thin films are shown in Fig. S3.† The MAPbI3 thin film has strong absorption from the visible to the near-infrared wavelength range with the absorption onset at ca. 780–790 nm (optical band gap ≈ 1.58 eV). Compared with that of the PbI2 based precursor, the Br substituted MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite film shows a different blue shift in absorption due to the increased band gap from 1.63 eV for 10% PbBr2 to 1.83 eV for the 50% PbBr2 ratio. The band gap can be well tuned by introducing Br into the MAPbI3, which is interesting for solar cells with different colour absorptions. It has been shown that MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 have good miscibility, and can be easily mixed by solution processing without inducing much crystal distortion due to small variation of the ionic radius between I and Br.
Polarization switching behavior studied by PFM and PFS
Investigations of ferroelectric polarization switching behavior are then made by performing PFM and PFS measurements on the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films. The phase image can illustrate the polarization orientation. A phase contrast of 180° suggests polarizations with opposite directions. A change in the amplitude image is usually coupled with the polarization switching due to the inverse piezoelectric effect. It can be seen that no polarization switching occurs with poling processes with smaller tip biases, such as −2 V → −1 V → 0 V → +1 V → +2 V. Fig. 1 shows the topography, amplitude and phase image after poling processes with step biases of −3 V, −2.5 V, 0, 2.5 V, and 3 V under a light illumination condition of 300 W m−2 for MAPbI3, MAPbI3-10% PbBr2 and MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 films, respectively. It can be seen that the domains in the MAPbI3 film are slightly switched to the upward direction (yellow color) after poling with a −3 V tip bias [Fig. 1(c)]. The corresponding amplitude shows a slightly reduced response [Fig. 1(b)]. However, this can be attributed to the electrochemical reaction because of film damage caused by large Joule heating and/or decomposition due to the presence of moisture in ambient air. It is reported that decomposition might be occurring in the MAPbI3 film if humidity > 55%.50 Moreover, there is a change of the topography in the area at the bias of −3 V [Fig. 1(a)], suggesting that this tip bias has already destroyed the localized area and/or made this area decompose by a rather large leakage current [Fig. S4†]. On the other hand, the domains remain the same as those in the as-grown state when poling with other tip biases, especially at positive tip bias. By comparison, the stacked structures replaced with 10% PbBr2 and 50% PbBr2 are more stable and there is no obvious topography change after these poling processes [Fig. 1(d) and (g)]. The I–V curves of stacked structures replaced with 10% PbBr2 and 50% PbBr2 also show an increase of resistivity and the current values obviously decreased to ∼0.5 nA and 0.1 nA at 3 V, respectively [Fig. S5(b) and (c)†], compared with the current of 16 nA in the MAPbI3 film [Fig. S5(a)†]. The increased resistivity is due to the substitution of I ions with Br ions in MAPbI3 leading to an enhancement in the band gap (Fig. S3†).49,50 From the PFM phase image of the MAPbI3-10% PbBr2 [Fig. 1(f)], it can be seen that the phase in the area poled with a −3 V tip bias shows a clearer trend of the domain switching. The corresponding amplitude shows an expanding response as well [Fig. 1(e)]. Unlike the structures with 0% PbBr2 and 10% PbBr2, the phase image of the structure replaced with 50% PbBr2 shows that spontaneous polarization is mainly in the upward direction (in yellow) and only small patches with opposite polarizations are observed in the unbiased area [Fig. 1(g)]. It appears that domain switching occurs in the 3 V biased area, in which the domains are switched to the downward direction [purple color in Fig. 1(g)]. To further confirm that the change of the PFM phase image is due to ferroelectric polarization switching, we also conducted a time dependent study (Fig. S6†) and temperature dependent study (Fig. S7†). The time dependent results show that even after 20 h, some of the switched domains are still purple, indicating that ferroelectric polarization switching occurs. The temperature dependent results reveal that the as-grown domains disappear at around 330 K, which is consistent with Ginzburg–Landau theory suggesting the transition of the ferroelectric phase to the paraelectric phase.57 This ferroelectric property is more clearly illustrated in the line profiles of the marked lines in the phase images [Fig. 2(a)]. The phase change of around 40° occurred in the −3 V biased area of the perovskite and MAPbI3-10% PbBr2 perovskite structure, whereas a phase change of approximately 150° is observed in the area of the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 perovskite structure poled with 3 V. The polarization switching behavior is further verified by conducting PFS on this structure. Fig. 2(b)–(d) show bias-on and bias-off phase hysteresis loops, “butterfly-like” amplitude loops and piezoresponse hysteresis loops with a window bias of ±4 V, respectively. Fully saturated polarization switching is confirmed by a phase angle difference of 180° in the phase hysteresis loops and the butterfly-like shape observed in the amplitude loops at the bias-off state, which is significantly different from what observed at bias-on states, and these differences can exclude the electrostatic force effect [Fig. 2(b) and (c)]. Actually, the bias-on piezoresponse is obtained with the applying of VDC, therefore it consists of three contributions: electrostatic contribution, electromechanical contribution and electrostrictive contribution.58 These results clearly show that room temperature ferroelectric polarization switching can be achieved by chemical incorporation of Br into MAPbI3; whereas, a shift of phase loops and asymmetry of amplitude loops are observed. The shift of phase loops may attribute to the built-in field in the film, and the asymmetry of amplitude loops may be due to extra thermal expansion stimulated by joule heating at a relatively large negative bias.33 The remnant piezoresponse loops, i.e., the piezoresponse loops at the bias-off state due to electromechanical contribution, are abstracted from the bias-on piezoresponse loops [Fig. 2(d)]. The bias-off piezoresponse loops are not coincident with the bias-on piezoresponse loops at the window bias of 0 V, indicating charge carrier trapping in the film.33 Startlingly, the bias-on piezoresponse loops are almost non-hysteresis loops resulting in negligible remnant piezoresponse loops in the negative biased side, though remnant piezoresponse loops in the positive biased side show traditional ferroelectric hysteresis character. Furthermore, a PFS technique has been also used at random locations under the same illumination conditions and under dark conditions, respectively, to verify the ferroelectricity of the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 perovskite structure. All the points measured show bias-off butterfly-like amplitude loops and phase hysteresis loops though there is slight shift of coercive voltage (Fig. S8 and S9†). By calculation, the negative coercive voltage is ≈−2.2 V, and the positive coercive voltage is ≈2.6 V. Efforts have also been made to obtain piezoresponse hysteresis loops at different scan rates, i.e., scan frequency [f = 0.1 Hz and 1 Hz, the corresponding waveform is shown in Fig. S10(a) and (b)†]. It is found that the coercive field remains almost the same [Fig. S10(c) and (d)†]. The only difference is the number of the points within the hysteresis loops obtained at different scan rates. By these comprehensive PFM and PFS studies, it is confirmed that the room temperature ferroelectricity of the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film. However, to verify the intrinsic ferroelectricity of the MAPbI3 or MAPbI3-10% PbBr2 film further work with more advanced techniques is necessary to be done as other researchers have reported the ferroelectric phenomena in bulk tetragonal MAPbI3 at low temperature.57

These figures show polarization switching characteristics of the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 perovskite film by using PFM in the spectroscopy mode. 
Electrical properties characterized by C-AFM
To have a better understanding of the effects of Br substitution on the ferroelectricity, the electrical property characterization is further conducted on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 films by applying sample biases with step-increased voltages of −4 V, −3 V, 0, 3 V and 4 V to the ITO bottom electrode. These applied sample biases correspond to applying a step-increased bias of 4 V, 3 V, 0, −3 V and −4 V to the tip. For the MAPbI3 film, the current bursts at sample biases of 4 V and 3 V [Fig. 3(b)]. Moreover, after removing the swept bias, sample surface current can still be observed in the region poled with the sample biases of 4 V and 3 V. In addition, the topography is significantly changed within the region bursting with the large leakage current [Fig. 3(a)]. On the other hand, when the film is scanned with sample biases of −4 V and −3 V, there are also some current spikes although the topography does not show visible changes. For the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film, the large leakage current and topography change are only observed in the region scanned with a sample bias of 4 V. Similar to that of the MAPbI3 film, the surface current can also be detected after removing the swept bias of 4 V. However, no leakage current and topography change are observed in the region scanned with a sample bias of 3 V. Moreover, sample biases of −4 V and −3 V induce negligible current in the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film. These C-AFM results are consistent with the previous PFM results and can explain the significantly enhanced ferroelectric polarization switching in the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film. Firstly, the observed topography change of MAPbI3 is shown in Fig. 1(a). The large leakage current causes destruction or decomposition in the region biased with a −3 V tip voltage. The polarization switching is barely observed in the 3 V tip biased region [Fig. 1(c)] since this local region is highly conductive, which can hinder the polarization switching [Fig. 3(b)].59 On the other hand, the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film is more stable, therefore it can withstand the −3 V sample bias scanning. The high resistance state in the region biased with a 3 V tip voltage [Fig. 3(e)] provides the prerequisite condition and results in the polarization switching [Fig. 1(i)]. Furthermore, it verifies that the soar of amplitude loops in the negative biased side [Fig. 2(c)] is due to the electrostatic effect arising from surface current in the bias-off state [Fig. 3(f)]. The almost degenerated remnant piezoresponse loops in the negative biased side [Fig. 2(d)] can be attributed to a short retention time of the surface current. Moreover, the non-linear I–V curves (Fig. S5†) may relate to the ferroelectric polarization orientation in the structures.35,36 To further eliminate the concern of the intrinsic nanostructures, such as the domain walls within the ferroelectric material, which have influence on the current flow (charge carrier trapping or drifting), and thus affect the performance of PSCs, the PFM and C-AFM techniques have been conducted in the same area in the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film after applying a 3 V tip bias on an area of 1 × 1 μm2. By comparing the obtained PFM phase image and current image, no correlation can be identified (Fig. S11†). In other words, it is found that the current flows are also detected in the domains instead of near domain walls. So in this case, the intrinsic nanostructures, such as the domain walls within the ferroelectric material, might show negligible influence on the performance of PSCs.

Surface potential distribution studied by KPFM
Following the ferroelectric property and electrical property characterization, the surface potential distribution is investigated by conducting KPFM on the MAPbI3 and the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film. The change in surface potential after poling processes can indicate the dynamic change of the charge carriers, including the recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons, and the drifting of charge carriers, such as positively charged vacancies  and/or negatively charged ions , as well as the permanent polarization bound charge state. By combining of the KPFM results with the PFM results, the migration of charge carriers and polarization bound charges integrated under the extra electric field can also be distinguished.59,60 In the MAPbI3 film, a slight increase of surface potential is observed in all of the biased regions [Fig. 4(a)]. As there is no polarization switching, it is deduced that the presence of additional positive charge carriers in the MAPbI3 film surface is on the account of the transportation of photo-generated holes and/or the migration of positively charged vacancies  to the film surface; however, the number of positive charge carriers is small due to recombination with the photo-generated electrons, and the injected electrons from the negatively biased tip. The reasons contributing to the recombination are the poorer mobilities and less efficient charge extraction of the structure since neither the hole transport layer nor the electron transportation layer is included in the structure. In addition, the KPFM result is also consistent with the PFM and C-AFM results on this structure [Fig. 1(c) and 3(c)]. The leakage current in the −3 V tip biased region [Fig. 3(c)] is the origin of the electrostatic force observation [Fig. 1(c)] and the slightly increased surface potential [Fig. 4(a)]. Moreover, the leakage current also influences the adjacent regions, so the surface potential increases in all the regions scanned by the swept biases.
 Fig. 4  Surface potential characteristics by performing KPFM under a light illumination condition of 300 W m−2: surface potential image of the perovskite films with (a) 0% PbBr2 and (b) 50% PbBr2 in the precursor after a step −3 V, −2.5 V, 0, 2.5 V, and 3 V poling process; (c) schematical image of the polarization switching at a tip bias of 3 V and the negatively bound charges compensated with certain positively charged carriers; and (d) line profiles of the surface potential images obtained just after the poling process and after 2nd grounded tip scanning. 
In the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film, the increase in surface potential is only observed in the 3 V biased region, while there is no obvious surface potential change in other regions [Fig. 4(b)]. Corresponding to the observed polarization switching in this region [Fig. 1(i)], the bound charges should be negatively coupled with the downward polarization switching at a tip bias of 3 V, which is schematically shown in Fig. 4(c). The negatively bound charges are overcompensated with positively charged carriers, and thus result in an increase of surface potential in this region. From the line profile of the surface potential immediately after the poling process and the one after grounded-tip scanning twice [Fig. 4(d)], the surface potential decreases from 40 mV to <20 mV, suggesting that the additional positive charges are caused by injected holes from the positively biased tip over the photo-generated electrons and the drifted negatively charged ions . Moreover, the injected holes can be rapidly removed by the grounded-tip scanning. In addition, the built-in field due to the downward polarization can weaken the external positive voltage, and thus hinder the separation and transportation of the photo-generated electrons and the migration of the negatively charged ions  to the tip/film interface.

J–V characteristics
PSCs of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al were fabricated and characterized. Perovskite thin films with different amounts of Br are employed to optimize the solar cell performance. Fig. S12† shows the J–V curves of the PSCs. The device with the MAPbI3 perovskite exhibits a short-circuit density (Jsc) of 18.9 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76, resulting in a PCE of 13.3%. For 10% PbBr2 substituted MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, the Jsc increases to 19.3 mA cm−2, Voc is 0.96 V, and FF increases to 0.74, resulting in an enhanced PCE of 14.2%. The enhancement of the PCE arises from the Jsc and Voc enhancement. Instead, when the PbBr2 ratio increases to 50 mol%, the Jsc decreases 14.8 mA cm−2, while the Voc increases to 1.18 V. As a result, the PCE decreases to 12.1%. The decreased Jsc can be ascribed to the blue shift of the absorption onset and wider band gap. It is worth noting that the devices have higher Voc values with increasing the Br loading. The Voc increases to 1.18 V for a PbBr2 ratio of 50 mol%. The Voc value is mainly related to the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the photoactive layer. In the heterojunction solar cells, it is determined by the valence band of the electron donor (perovskite) and the LUMO of the electron acceptor (PCBM). Tuning the valence band of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, by incorporating different molar ratios of Br, is supposed to increase the Voc.
The effects of ferroelectric MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 polarization on the performance of PSCs are investigated by varying the polarization state by applying a poling voltage to the ITO bottom electrode. The corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(e) and (f) show the poling effect on the J–V curves of the PSC device with 50% PbBr2. A positive poling does not cause an obvious change in the J–V characteristics, while a negative poling can significantly reduce the photovoltaic efficiency. From the PFM results, it is known that most of the spontaneous polarization in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 is in the upward direction [Fig. 1(i)]. There is no obvious polarization switching at a negative tip bias (0, −2.5 V and −3 V). When it comes to the solar cell devices, with the poling bias of 0 V to 3 V applied onto the ITO bottom electrode, no significant change of J–V curves is observed [Fig. 5(e)]. On the other hand, when a negative poling voltage of 0 V to −3 V is applied onto the ITO bottom electrode, the PCE as well as Voc and Jsc are shown to obviously decrease [Fig. 5(f)]. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that when the negative poling electric field is small, the dipoles in MAPbI3 cannot be completely switched, and when further increasing the negative poling electric field, the dipoles can be switched and downward ferroelectric polarizations are created, which result in an opposite electric field and hinder charge separation. It should be noticed that the polarization switching in the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 film starts at a 2 V tip bias [Fig. 2(b) and (c)], which agreed well with the device performance observation. In addition, the J–V characteristics are also consistent with the C-AFM results that little current bursts occur in the negative sample bias poling process [Fig. 3(e)]. Hence, the efficiency of the solar cell reduced upon applying a negative poling electric field. Interestingly, no obvious anomalous hysteresis in J–V is observed, which may due to the PEDOT/perovskite/PCBM planar structure and the PCBM passivation effect in this study.52 In addition, it is also found that the efficiency can be slowly recovered after the polarization switches back to upward (Fig. S13†). The Voc is recovered first, and FF needs longer time for the recovery process. For PSCs with 0% and 10% PbBr2 [Fig. 5(a)–(d)], the effects of the poling process on J–V curves have a similar trend to that of 50% PbBr2. Since no clear polarization switching is observed in these two structures [Fig. 1(c) and (f)], it indicates that trapping effects and ion migration also contribute to the change of the J–V characteristics. It is also noticed that the current density is larger in these PSCs with 0% and 10% PbBr2, suggesting that the maintained upward polarization is favorable to the charge separation and recombination.

Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10 ohm per □ were purchased from NSG. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was obtained from Dyesol Ltd. All other chemicals, including lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% purity), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9% purity), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL, ≥99% purity) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films
Perovskites films with different Br loadings (0%, 10%, and 50%) were prepared on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate, which were cleaned successively in detergent, deionized water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol by sonication for 20 min each. After drying under a N2 stream, the substrates were further treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A perovskite film was coated from a precursor solution containing 1.4 M (PbI2 + PbBr2) and 1.4 M MAI in the co-solvent of DMSO:GBL (3:7 vol ratio) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and washed with toluene after 25 s at 5000 rpm. The thickness of the perovskite thin films was around 280 nm.
Fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells
ITO glass substrates were cleaned with the same procedures as described above. PEDOT:PSS was filtered with a 0.45 μm filter. The PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm was prepared by spin-coating at 6000 rpm for 40 s and subsequently annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The ITO substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite layer was coated from a precursor solution containing 1.4 M (PbI2 + PbBr2) and 1.4 M MAI in the co-solvent of DMSO:GBL (3:7 vol ratio) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and washed with toluene after 25 s at 5000 rpm. The perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. PCBM was then deposited by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution of 20 mg mL−1 PCBM at 2000 rpm for 1 min. LiF (0.5 nm thick) and Al (100 nm thick) were thermally deposited in a vacuum of <1 × 10−6 Torr through a shadow mask. Each device had an area of 0.11 cm2.
Characterization of materials and devices
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Zeiss Supra-40. Film thicknesses were determined with a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ).
To verify the ferroelectric properties in the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films, PFM was performed after consecutive tip bias sweeps (−3 V → −2.5 V → 0 V → +2.5 V → +3 V) on an area of 5 × 5 μm2 in the middle of a perovskite film under a light illumination of 300 W m−2. The area of each sequence was 5 × 1 μm2. The DC poling process was used to switch the polarization inside the perovskite films. It started with a smaller tip bias, such as −2 V → −1 V → 0 V → +1 V → +2 V, and the sweep was from negative voltage to positive voltage. In addition, the application of larger biases could lead to a dielectric breakdown and cause topography changes of the MAPbI3 films (Fig. S4†). It should be noticed that to rule out the possible artifacts, such as the surface screening charge and thermal effect under a larger external electric field, elaborate measurements have been adopted. To increase the sensitivity of common PFM, the external electric field is driven at near the resonance (f0) between the cantilever and sample, i.e., the cantilever–sample contact stiffness. However, the cantilever–sample contact stiffness is dependent on sample topography. The variation of the topography shifts the resonance (f0) and causes a so-called “topographic crosstalk” signal.29 In order to minimize the topographic crosstalk, a dual AC resonance tracking PFM (DART-PFM) has been developed, in which the cantilever is oscillated at two frequencies on both sides of the resonance (f1 < f0 and f2 > f0).61 By this technique, the shift resonant frequency, f0 can be accurately tracked by following a constant Δf = f2 − f1. Hence, the ferroelectric properties of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films were then investigated by conducting PFM in dual AC resonance tracking (DART) mode, which can generate topography, phase angle (ϕ) and amplitude (A) images simultaneously. In order to acquire the amplitude loops and the phase loops, further measurements were carried out by conducting PFM in spectroscopy mode (PFS), in which the local polarization was reversed by sequences of bipolar triangle–square pulses with a frequency of 200 mHz (Fig. S14†). An AC drive voltage, VAC, was superposed on the DC pulse voltage, VDC. The pulse magnitude and the pulse width of VDC were 5 V and 25 ms, respectively. The amplitude loops and phase loops were acquired both the at DC bias-on and bias-off conditions, respectively, to exclude the electrostatic effects.32,33 The piezoresponse hysteresis loops, PR(E), were calculated from the amplitude, A(E) and phase, ϕ(E), using the equation PR(E) = A(E) × cos(ϕ(E)) in a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) fitting method with PFM software to rule out the thermal effect.61,62 The SHO model is appropriate for modeling single-eigenmode characterization when the tip–sample interactions do not significantly perturb the oscillation; and by this model, the cantilever amplitude response can be fitted to a Lorentzian curve to extract the real sample deformation. Therefore, ferroelectric parameters such as the imprint bias, coercive bias and remnant switchable piezoresponse can be obtained from the PR(E) loops. To eliminate the surface screening charge, a favourable lower VAC of 0.5 V was used to get the PFM image and PFM loops with a grounded tip and sample after the DC poling process or sequences of bipolar triangle-square pulses, because the use of drive voltages larger than the coercive voltage might improve the signal to noise ratio, but may also result in domain switching.31
The C-AFM measurements were conducted using an ORCA™ by Asylum Research with a conductive module attached to the SPM equipment.63 In the C-AFM measurement of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films, the bias was applied to the bottom electrode rather than the tip, which was opposite to that of the PFM measurement. In the C-AFM I–V curve measurements, a triangle voltage waveform with a frequency of 10 Hz and an amplitude of ±4 V was used. To obtain the current images, step-increased sample biases of −4 V → −3 V → 0 V → 3 V → 4 V [corresponding to opposite tip biases (4 V → 3 V → 0 V → −3 V → −4 V) in PFM measurements] were consecutively applied on 5 × 5 μm2 area with a step of 5 × 1 μm2. In the C-AFM set up, a current compliance of 100 nA was preset. The set point, i.e., the loading force was kept as constant at 0.3 V.
To study the charge carrier dynamic, KPFM was subsequently performed after the PFM measurements on the same area under the same light illumination conditions. KPFM is operated in the alternating contact mode, i.e., altering in contact with the sample and above the sample surface, in which topography and surface potential distribution can be collected concurrently.46 In the measurement, the cantilever was biased with an AC voltage of 3 V. The tip started at a height of 40 nm from the sample and the lift height was kept as 40 nm in the subsequent scan. To better illustrate the results, the surface potential images were zero-order flattened with regard to a surface potential value of zero in the unbiased region.
All of the SPM measurements in this study, including PFM, C-AFM and KPFM, were conducted on commercial SPM equipment (MFP-3D, Asylum Research, Oxford Instruments, USA). A control platform (Asylum Research 13.09.91, CA, USA) embedded in technical graphing and data analysis software (IGOR PRO 6.34A) was used. To avoid electrostatic effects,32 the sample was grounded through the ITO bottom electrode during the PFM and KPFM measurements, and the tip was grounded through the cantilever holder circuit during the C-AFM measurement. The schematics of the set up for PFM/KPFM and C-AFM are shown in Fig. S15(a) and (b)† respectively. The scanning resolution was 256 × 256 pixel. Si tips coated with a conductive layer of Pt (AC240TM, Olympus, Japan) were used for all measurements. The tip radius was about 30 nm; the spring constant was about 1.2 N m−1; the inverse optic lever sensitivity of the tips was about 108 nm V−1; and the resonance frequency was around 65 kHz.

J–V curves of PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source/meter. The schematic of the J–V characteristics set up on of the PSCs is shown in Fig. S15(c).† The device photocurrent was measured for a device exposed to AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2), which was accurately calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector. The incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were acquired with a xenon lamp (Oriel, 300 W) as the light source, a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125), and a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Corp). The light intensity was calibrated with a Si-based diode (J115711-1-Si detector). The J–V curves confirmed that the scan direction and scan rate did not have much difference (ESI, Fig. S16†).
Conclusions
To summarize, we have investigated the ferroelectric properties of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films and their ferroelectricity effects on the PCEs of solar cell devices. First, we directly observe the saturated polarization switching in the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 film with a PbBr2 ratio of 50 mol% by PFM imaging at room temperature. With a small window bias of 5 V, the obtained “butterfly-like” amplitude loops, saturated phase hysteresis loops and piezoresponse hysteresis loops at the bias-off state further confirm that this polarization switching behavior is an intrinsic property. Second, from the C-AFM results, it is found that there is no polarization switching in the MAPbI3 film, and this is due to the large leakage current aroused by the applied swept tip biases; in the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3-50% PbBr2 film, the current aroused under the negative tip bias also leads the negligible remnant piezoresponse loops. The relatively high resistance state in the region biased with a 3 V tip voltage is favorable for the polarization switching. The efficiency of the separation and transportation of the photo-generated holes/electrons and the migration of charged ions  is affected by the polarization orientation. Third, in all the PSC devices, it shows that the positive biased direction has little influence on the J–V characteristics, while a negative biased direction significantly reduces the photovoltaic efficiency. Finally, by combining the PFM and C-AFM results, it indicates that the downward polarization orientation and relatively high resistance state may decrease the Jsc of PSCs with a PbBr2 ratio of 50 mol%.

 	Fig. 1  Polarization switching characteristics of the 0% PbBr2 [(a)–(c)], 10% PbBr2 [(d)–(f)], and 50% PbBr2 [(g)–(i)] MAPbI3 perovskite films by performing PFM measurements after step poling processes with −3 V, −2.5 V, 0, 2.5 V, and 3 V under a light illumination condition of 300 W m−2: (a, d and g) topography images; (b, e and h) PFM amplitude images; and (c, f and i) PFM phase images.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Line profiles of the phase images in Fig. 1(c), (f) and (i); (b) phase hysteresis loop, ϕ(E); (c) amplitude “butterfly” loop, A(E); and (d) piezoresponse hysteresis loop, P(E), which are calculated and plotted using the equation PR(E) = A(E) × cos[ϕ(E)] under bias-on and bias-off conditions, respectively. The magnitude of the applied pulse was 5 V and the pulse width, i.e., bias-on/bias off time was 25 ms. These figures show polarization switching characteristics of the MAPbI3-50% PbBr2 perovskite film by using PFM in the spectroscopy mode.	 

 	Fig. 3  Electrical property characteristics of the 0% PbBr2 [(a)–(c)] and 50% PbBr2 [(d)–(f)] MAPbI3 perovskite films by performing conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) under a light illumination condition of 300 W m−2. (a and d) Topography images; (b and e) current images scanned with applying a swept bias of −4 V, −3 V, 0, 3 V and 4 V to the ITO bottom electrode; and (c and f) current images without applying any sample bias.	 

 	Fig. 4  Surface potential characteristics by performing KPFM under a light illumination condition of 300 W m−2: surface potential image of the perovskite films with (a) 0% PbBr2 and (b) 50% PbBr2 in the precursor after a step −3 V, −2.5 V, 0, 2.5 V, and 3 V poling process; (c) schematical image of the polarization switching at a tip bias of 3 V and the negatively bound charges compensated with certain positively charged carriers; and (d) line profiles of the surface potential images obtained just after the poling process and after 2nd grounded tip scanning.	 

 	Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells with different ratios of PbBr2 (a and b): 0% PbBr2; (c and d): 10% PbBr2, and (e and f): 50% PbBr2 poled at positive (a, c and e) and negative (b, d and f) biases, respectively.
