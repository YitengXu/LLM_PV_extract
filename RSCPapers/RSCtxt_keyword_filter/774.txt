1. Introduction
Due to their relatively low cost, high durability and potential use as flexible devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been thought to be a potential candidate to realize the large-scale use of solar energy, and they have received tremendous attention in both academic and industrial fields since their discovery by Grätzel in the 1990s.1,2 Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) borrow the concept of DSCs with the replacement of the molecular dye by inorganic colloidal QDs.3–5 The configuration of QDSC devices is shown in Fig. 1 and is analogous to that of DSCs with a photoanode based on a sensitizer-loaded mesoporous metal oxide (mainly TiO2) film, electrolyte, and a counter electrode. The intrinsic properties of QDs (tunable light-harvesting range, high extinction coefficients, large intrinsic dipole moment, and the potential possibility of multi-exciton-generation) offer certain advantages over molecular dyes as alternative light absorbers.6–11 However, currently, the reported highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of QDSCs is less than 7%,12–15 which lags remarkably behind those of DSCs (12–13%).16,17 As pointed out by Clark and coworkers, we agree that the low performance of QDSC is a design issue, but not a fundamental one.18 The configuration and processing procedure for photoanodes for QDSC is almost similar to those for DSC. Due to the significant difference between molecular dyes and QD sensitizers (different size, different charge recombination route), the optimized photoanode in DSC is not suitable for QDSC.4,19–21 In order to exploit the potential of QDSC and obtain higher PCEs, a full modification of the photoanode is essential.
 Fig. 1  Schematic overview of the QDSC architecture. 
Of late, considerable efforts have been focused on improving the performance of QDSCs through the design and optimization of TiO2 mesoporous films to increase the QD loading, shorten charge transmission path, and inhibit charge recombination.22–27 Since the study of QDSCs are still in the infant stage, plenty of divergent views and contrary conclusions exist in the field of QDSCs, especially with regard to the photoanode film. It is generally acknowledged that pre-treatment of FTO glass and/or a TiO2 mesoporous film with a solution of TiCl4 to form a compact TiO2 layer with a thickness of hundreds of nanometers benefits the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices.28,29 In some cases, TiCl4 treatment is employed on FTO glass, whereas in some cases, it is carried out on mesoporous TiO2 film; moreover, in some cases, it is also performed on both FTO glass and TiO2 films.30–32 However, the experimental results by Mora-Seró and co-workers indicate that TiCl4 treatment does not lead to any appreciable improvement in the performance of the resultant cell devices.33 In addition, the thickness of the TiO2 transparent layer varies from case to case in the range of 2 μm to 19 μm.34–39 For example, Kamat and coworkers adopted a very thin mesoscopic TiO2 film (0.2–2 μm) in the case of colloidal CdSe QD-based QDSCs.34 Lee et al. demonstrated a best photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 2.9% on a 8.5 μm thick photoanode TiO2 film.39 Cao et al. revealed that the optimal TiO2 film thickness should be 11 μm.36 Meng and coworkers achieved a 4.92% efficiency using a 19 μm thick double-layer TiO2 photoanode structure.37 Furthermore, in all the previous reports on the optimization of the photoanode, the QD sensitizers were grown directly on TiO2 film via chemical bath deposition (CBD) or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) routes, in which the obtained QDs are of poor quality with a high density of defects.19 The near recent development of QDSCs indicates that the mainstream of QD immobilization routes on TiO2 film electrodes has been transferred from a direct growth approach to a post-synthesis assembly method in the construction of highly efficient QDSC since the high-quality QD can be accessible in the ex situ synthetic procedure.12,13,40,41 Therefore, it is urgently needed to optimize the photoanode composition and configuration to match the post-synthesis assembly route for the further improvement of efficiency of the QDSCs.
Herein, a CdSe QD sensitized solar cell was constructed using a post-synthesis assembly approach and served as a model cell to evaluate the performance of different photoanodes. The effect of TiCl4 treatment on FTO glass and a TiO2 mesoporous film, the thickness of the TiO2 transparent layer, chemical composition of the transparent layer paste, and light scattering layer have been systematically investigated and optimized. Experimental results show that the sole TiCl4 treatment on FTO is sufficient for the improvement in the cell performance. The optimum thickness of the TiO2 transparent layer is around 9.0 μm and the optimum ethyl cellulose/P25 weight ratio is in the range of 0.25–0.75:1. Moreover, the influence of the light-scattering layer pastes with different contents of large-sized TiO2 particles on the performance of the cells has also been explored. The optimized CdSe-sensitized solar cell exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 5.53% under 1 full sun illumination, which is among the best reported efficiency for a plain CdSe QD-based cell device.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%), selenium powder (99.99%), oleylamine (OAm), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), terpineol, and ethyl cellulose (EC, Fluka) were purchased from Aldrich. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99%) and oleic acid (OA, 90%) were obtained from Alfa. P25 powder (a mixed phase of 80% anatase and 20% rutile; average size 25 nm) was purchased from Degussa. Tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT), n-butanol, boric acid, methanol and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Company.
Preparation of screen-printing pastes
For preparing the mesoporous TiO2 transparent-layer pastes, an amount of 2.0 g of commercial P25 nanoparticles was added to 15.2 mL of anhydrous ethanol in a round-bottomed flask with the mixture being sonicated for 5 min. Then, 8.1 g of terpineol and 10.4 g of an ethanol solution with 10 wt% EC were dispersed and sonicated in the mixture consecutively. In order to achieve the final transparent-layer pastes, the ethanol was removed completely from the resulting solution via a rotary evaporator.
Similar to the transparent-layer pastes, the light-scattering pastes were prepared except for adding different amounts of large sized (∼300 nm) spherical TiO2 particles into the P25. The large-sized TiO2 particles were homemade according to that reported in the literature.42 Typically, 3.4 mL of tetrabutyl titanate and 25.5 mL of butyl alcohol were mixed to form a clear solution by sonication. The transparent solution was added dropwise into 100 mL of a 0.85 M boric acid solution in a round-bottomed flask as slowly as possible. After aging for 72 h at room temperature, the resultant white precipitate was purified by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the powder was calcined at 450 °C (at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1) and maintained at this temperature for 3 h.
Preparation of photoanode and QDSCs assembly
To prepare the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode film, the FTO glass (8 Ω/sq resistance) was first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 60 min, followed by rinsing with water and ethanol. An aqueous stock solution of 2 M TiCl4 was diluted to 40 mM. Then, the FTO glass was soaked into this solution and stored in an oven at 70 °C for 30 min in a closed vessel and washed with water and ethanol. Then, the prepared transparent-layer and light-scattering pastes were sequentially deposited onto the processed FTO glass via successive screen printing, followed by gradually drying at 120 °C for 7 min each time to get an appropriate thickness. Then, the film was gradually heated at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, and at 450 °C for 15 min, and finally, at 500 °C for 15 min. The freshly sintered TiO2 film thus produced was once again treated with a 40 mM TiCl4 solution, as described previously. After flushing with ethanol and drying, the electrodes were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min.
The obtained mesoporous TiO2 films were sensitized with pre-prepared water-soluble MPA-capped CdSe QDs via the self-assembly of QD onto the mesoporous film by dipping the TiO2 film into the QD aqueous dispersion (with an absorbance of 2.0 at the first excitonic absorption onset) for 2 h. After the deposition was complete, the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 film was treated with four cycles of ZnS by immersion into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions for 1 min/dip alternately. The TiO2 photoanode was then subjected to sintering treatment at a temperature of 300 °C for 2 min.
The QDSCs were assembled by sandwiching the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and a brass counter electrode together with a polysulfide electrolyte composed of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl aqueous solution in the interspace. For each experiment, at least five QDSCs were fabricated and evaluated in parallel, and the average value was chosen as the final data.
Photovoltaic characterization
The absorption spectra of the TiO2 films was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600. Photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) measurements were carried out by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter irradiated by an AM 1.5 G solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel, Model no. 94022A). A NREL standard Si solar cell was used to calibrate the power of the simulated light to 1000 W m−2. The J–V measurements were performed under an ambient aerobic atmosphere. The devices were stored in ambient air between each measurement and the atmospheric temperature was 25.0 ± 5.0 °C during the measurements. In the process of measurement, a circular black metallic tape with a 6.0 mm diameter aperture, which is slightly larger than the photoactive region of 5.5 mm diameter, was used as a shading mask. Note that the photoactive area was 0.237 cm2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Zennium) at a given bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to100 kHz under dark conditions.
3. Results and discussion
In order to determine the optimum composition and configuration of the TiO2 photoanode, a model CdSe QD-sensitized solar cell was constructed by a post-synthesis self-assembly approach. All samples have been tested using polysulfide as the electrolyte and Cu2S as the counter electrode. The selection of CdSe QD sensitizer was due to its facile and well-developed synthetic method, relative wide light-harvesting range and the satisfactory photovoltaic performance of the resultant QDSCs. The synthesis of 5.1 nm sized oil-soluble oleylamine-capped CdSe QDs with a first excitonic absorption peak at 620 nm, water-solubilization of the initial oil-soluble QDs into water-soluble mercaptopropionic (MPA)-capped QDs, and the immobilization of MPA-capped QDs onto TiO2 film electrode followed our own recently developed literature methods,43,44 and the detailed procedure presented in the ESI.† Under each condition, the average photovoltaic performance for at least five cells in parallel was used in order to minimize the sample deviation.
TiCl4 treatment
Nanoscaled oxide layer deposition techniques, such as chemical bath sol–gel, spray pyrolysis of precursor vapor, and atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods, have been adopted to deposit a compact TiO2 layer on FTO glass and/or on nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 film substrates in sensitized solar cells. For comparison, the chemical bath sol–gel route is the most facile and economical without the dependence on any complicated instrumentation; therefore, the deposition of a TiO2 compact layer via the hydrolysis of a TiCl4 aqueous solution was adopted in this study. In order to investigate the effects of TiCl4 treatment on FTO and the TiO2 film, we carried out TiCl4 treatment as described in the experimental section using different procedures as follows: FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 referred to TiCl4 treatment only on FTO glass; FTO/TiO2/TiCl4 referred to TiCl4 treatment only on a TiO2 film; FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/TiCl4 referred to TiCl4 treatment on both FTO glass and a TiO2 film; while the reference sample FTO/TiO2 referred to no TiCl4 treatment on either FTO or a TiO2 film. Fig. 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the FTO before and after TiCl4 treatment. In comparison with the bare FTO, the morphology of FTO with TiCl4 treatment changed dramatically with the appearance of a thin layer of TiO2 nanoclusters on top of the FTO.

Fig. 3a shows the representative J–V curves of the resultant solar cells with intermediate performance based on the photoanodes, which underwent the different TiCl4 treatment procedures described above and the extracted average photovoltaic parameters of the 5 cells in parallel are summarized in Table 1 with details of each cell available in Table S1 of the ESI.† We can see that the cells based on FTO/TiO2 without any TiCl4 treatment exhibit the poorest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.11%. The cells based on FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 and FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/TiCl4 treatment procedures exhibited the best PCE values of 5.53% and 5.47%, respectively.40 Furthermore, the enhanced PCE for cells treated with TiCl4 benefit from an enhanced short-circuit density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was nearly independent of the TiCl4 treatment procedure. The enhanced photocurrent was further confirmed by the improved monochromatic IPCE as shown in Fig. 3b, in which the FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 and FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/TiCl4 treatment cell exhibit the highest IPCE value in the complete light response range. Based on these results, we can conclude that TiCl4 treatment on the FTO substrate has the greatest contribution to the improvement of photovoltaic performance, while the contribution from the treatment on the TiO2 film is lesser than that from the treatment on FTO. Note that the combination of treatment on FTO and the TiO2 film cannot further improve the performance of the device in comparison with sole TiCl4 treatment on FTO substrate; i.e., a single step of TiCl4 pretreatment of the FTO substrate is sufficient for obtaining high efficiency in QDSC prepared by the post-synthesis assembly route. This is much simpler than the convenient two step treatment procedure (i.e. TiCl4 treatment on both FTO and TiO2 film) as reported in literature.

Our finding that TiCl4 pretreatment on the FTO substrate benefits the photovoltaic performance of the cell device is consist with previous results by Park and coworkers, in which compact TiO2 was deposited on the FTO electrode by sputtering.31,32 It is generally recognized that the TiO2 layer deposited on the FTO substrate acts as a blocking layer, which plays a significant role in reducing the electron back transfer from the FTO to the polysulfide electrolyte. In the report by Mora-Seró, they found that both the TiCl4 treatment on FTO glass previously covered with a TiO2 compact layer by spray pyrolysis route and TiO2 film had almost no effect on the performance of the device prepared by direct growth of QD sensitizer on TiO2 film electrode.33 In fact, our result is not contradictory to that of Mora-Seró's, since in their case the compact TiO2 layer had been formed before the TiCl4 treatment. Furthermore, our results indicate that the TiCl4 treatment on the TiO2 film has a certain beneficial effect on the performance of the cell device, but the degree is lesser than that by treatment on the FTO substrate. Similarly, Park and coworkers have also observed that TiCl4 treatment on the TiO2 film has the beneficial effect on the photovoltaic performance of the cell device constructed via the direct growth of QD on the photoanode.31,32 They proposed that the main contribution to the efficiency enhancement lies in the reduced recombination rate at the TiO2/electrolyte interface by passivating the surface defects of nanocrystalline TiO2. When combined with the literature results,31–33 we can conclude that TiCl4 treatment on the FTO glass has a beneficial effect on the photovoltaic performance of the resultant QDSCs prepared by both the direct growth of QD and post-synthesis assembly route.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to elucidate the effect of TiCl4 treatment on the performance of the cell device due to the significant advantages of EIS to explore the electrochemical property of each part of the cell device, such as the photoanode, counter electrode, and diffusion in the electrolyte at a different applied voltage bias of Vapp.45–48 EIS was carried out in dark conditions at different forward bias from 0 V to −0.6 V by applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal with the frequency ranging between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz. In the EIS of QDSCs, recombination resistance (Rr) and shunted chemical capacitance (Cμ) reflects the charge recombination process between the QD sensitizers/TiO2/electrolyte interfaces. A greater Rr corresponds to a low recombination rate,45 and larger Cμ values indicate the upward shift of the Fermi level, resulting in the large Voc.46 From the EIS measurements, the Vapp dependent Rr and Cμ are shown in Fig. 4a and b. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that when the Vapp is larger than 0.2 V, both the Rr and Cμ values of the solar cells based on the FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 photoanode are greater than those of the other three cells corresponding to different TiCl4 treatment procedures. For clarity, Fig. 4c shows the comparison of Nyquist plots of QDSCs subjected to various TiCl4 treatment procedures under forward bias close to the open-circuit voltage of −0.6 V and the extracted main EIS parameters are collected in Table 2. It was found that the Rr values corresponding to the FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 and FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/TiCl4 cells (160.2, and 161.4 Ω cm2, respectively) are significantly higher than those of the FTO/TiO2 and FTO/TiO2/TiCl4 cells (109.4, 128.2 Ω cm2, respectively). These EIS results support the lower recombination rate for the FTO/TiCl4/TiO2 and FTO/TiCl4/TiO2/TiCl4 cells, which is conducive for the enhanced Jsc and FF values for cells subjected to TiCl4 treatment on a FTO glass substrate as observed in the J–V measurements.

Impact of film thickness and constituent on photovoltaic performance
The optimum TiO2 transparent layer thickness for sensitized solar cells varies according to the nature of the sensitizers, especially depending on the molar extinction coefficients.49,50 The ideal case is to employ a sensitizer that has a very high extinction coefficient on a very thin porous film, which can harvest all incident solar photon and thus produce both a high photocurrent and high photovoltage without significant unwanted charge recombination, resulting in an outstanding PCE. It should be noted that although an increase of TiO2 transparent layer thickness in a certain range can improve the loading amount of sensitizer and thus can harvest more incident solar photon, with an increase of TiO2 film thickness, the photo-generated electrons travel from the sensitizers (QDs or dyes) to the FTO through an increased number of nanoparticles and grain boundaries, which leads to the increased recombination probability.51,52 Moreover, resistance loss is recognized as another loss mechanism with the thickness of film increasing. Therefore, the trade off requires optimization of the film thickness for highly efficient QDSC. For highly efficient DSCs, the appropriate thickness of the photoanode film is 12–14 μm.53 However, there is not a unified standard for the film thickness of QDSCs to date.54,55 In this study, the photoanode film with different TiO2 transparent layer thicknesses combined with a 6 μm light-scattering layer on top were used to assemble QDSCs. The adjustment of the transparent layer thickness was achieved by tuning the number of transparent layers and the 2-, 3-, 4-layers of transparent layer corresponding to film layers of 6.0 ± 0.5, 9.0 ± 0.5, and 12.0 ± 0.5 μm, respectively, measured by a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer (KLA-Tencor Instruments, USA).
The absorption spectra of the CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 films with different thickness (without the scattering layer) are shown in Fig. S1a† and the linear dependence of the corresponding absorbance at the first excitonic absorption peak on the thickness of TiO2 film is summarized in Fig. S1b.† The increased absorbance can be understood as a consequence of the larger number of binding sites available for CdSe QDs within thicker TiO2 transparent films. After construction of a full cell device, the photovoltaic performance was evaluated. Fig. 5a shows the PCE curves for CdSe QDSCs based on the different thickness of TiO2 transparent layers and the extracted main photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table S2.† It is evident that accompanied with the increase of the TiO2 transparent layer thickness from 6.0 to 9.0 μm and the corresponding increase of absorbance, both the Jsc and PCE of the resultant cells increased accordingly (Jsc increased from 14.96 mA cm−2 to 16.11 mA cm−2, and PCE increased from 5.13% to 5.55%). However, with the transparent layer thickness increased furthermore to 12.0 μm, the device efficiency decreased inversely to 5.28%. When the transparent layer thickness increased from 9.0 to 12.0 μm, the photocurrent of the resultant cells have no remarkable increase, while the Voc decreased inversely. The Jsc cannot be further improved and can be explained by the fact that in the case of a 9.0 μm transparent layer, the obtained absorbance by the photoanode film of 1.42 ensures absorption of more than 96% of the incident light at wavelengths below the onset; i.e., there is no more room for the further improvement of the light-harvesting capacity. As for the decrease of the Voc with thickening film, it can be explained that the photo-generated electron transport path becomes longer, resulting in an increased recombination rate.
 Fig. 5  PCE values of the QDSCs based on: (a) different thicknesses of the TiO2 transparent layer; (b) different EC contents in the TiO2 transparent layer pastes; and (c) different large-sized particle contents in the light-scattering layer pastes. 
In addition to suitable thickness, the porosity of the TiO2 film also plays a crucial role in determining the loading amount of QD sensitizer due to the huge size of a QD particle relative to their counterpart dye molecules.54 Furthermore, the porosity of the TiO2 film also affects the distribution of QDs throughout the film thickness since too small pore size could be blocked by the large sized QD particles and the interior of the film cannot be penetrated by the QD sensitizer. The porosity and the pore size of the film is mainly determined by the content of ethyl cellulose (EC) in the transparent layer paste.54,56 In this study, in order to determine the optimum porosity of the TiO2 film, we adjusted the content of the EC additives with a weight ratio of EC:P25 = 0.25:1, 0.5:1, and 0.75:1, respectively when preparing the transparent layer pastes. The porosity (ϕ) of a TiO2 transparent layer film is obtained from the equation: ϕ = (Wbulk − Wfilm)/Wbulk, where Wfilm refers to the weight of the TiO2 transparent film, and Wbulk refers to the weight of bulk TiO2 with a density of 3.895 g cm−3 and the equal volume to the film. The porosity was determined to be 0.53, 0.59, and 0.65, respectively. Fig. 5b summarizes the device efficiencies resulting from the different EC contents in the transparent paste, and the main photovoltaic parameters listed in Table S3.† We can find that with the variation of EC content from 0.25:1 to 0.75:1 in the transparent layer paste, the efficiency of the resultant cell devices almost remained constant and the relative difference was less than 4%. This demonstrates that the film composition has a large tolerance and the EC content (i.e. the porosity) in a certain range had no significant effect on the devices efficiency.
Impact of light-scattering layer on the photovoltaic performance
Currently, the so-called “double-layer” configuration, consisting of the transparent layer and light-scattering layer, has been generally employed for the preparation of photoanode films in sensitized solar cells. On the one hand, the transparent layer, consisting of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles with a size of 10–40 nm, serve as electron conductors and holder of the sensitizer (dye molecules or QDs), which can provide a high surface area for high sensitizer loading. On the other hand, the light-scattering layer, composed of microcrystalline TiO2 particles with a size of 200–400 nm, can enhance the light absorption capacity by prolonging the optical light path due to the light-scattering effect of the micro-sized particles.38,57 The conventional and effective method of light scattering is by adding micro-sized particles with diameters of 200–400 nm to scatter light and improve the optical absorption of the working electrode. In this study, the light-scattering layer consists of P25 particles with a certain fraction (0–100%) of large sized TiO2 particle (200–400 nm). The preparation procedure for the light-scattering layer paste is similar to that for the transparent layer paste. The PCEs of the cell devices based on different compositions light-scattering layer pastes are illustrated in Fig. 5c, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S4.† It can be seen that the efficiency of QDSCs increases significantly from 4.86% to 5.56% when the large sized TiO2 particles content increases from 0 to 40 wt%. With a further increase in the content of large particles to 50 wt%, and to 100 wt%, the resultant PCEs decrease inversely to 5.21%, and 5.04%, respectively. This result indicates the optimum large particle content in the light-scattering layer paste is 30–40 wt%. Furthermore, the fact that the devices based on sole large particles scattering layer paste have a poorer efficiency than those on the scattering layer composed of a mixture of P25 and large sized particles demonstrates that the role of scattering layer is not only enhancing optical path, but also diminishing charge recombination.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the composition and configuration of TiO2 photoanode films have been optimized for high efficiency QDSC, and an average PCE of 5.53% has been achieved for the plain CdSe-sensitized solar cells. The experimental results indicate that TiCl4 treatments are beneficial for the photocurrent and performance of the QDSCs due to the strongly reduced charge recombination rate. In contrast, the sole TiCl4 pre-treatments on FTO are superior to any other modes of treatments on the TiO2 films. Moreover, the optimum thickness of transparent layer is 9.0 μm and the EC/P25 weight ratio can be varied in a wide range from 0.25:1 to 0.75:1. Furthermore, the light-scattering layer paste consisting of 40% large-sized TiO2 particles and 60% P25 gives the best efficiency for the resultant cell devices. We believe that through our continuous efforts on the further optimization of the photoanode with a new morphology and new architecture, a new record efficiency for QDSCs will be easily attainable in the near future.
