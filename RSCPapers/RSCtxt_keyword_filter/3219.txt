    , Accepted 12th April 2016First published on 13th April 2016AbstractBy means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the effect of the solvent evaporation rate and thermal annealing on the molecular packing morphology of a diketopyrrolopyrrole based organic photovoltaic donor material, DPP(TBFu)2, which displays excellent hole mobility. It is observed that slow evaporation of solvent will lead to a relatively high degree of molecular packing order while leaving many voids in the as-cast sample. Upon thermal annealing, the as-cast samples at both fast and slow evaporation rates become more compact and much more apparently at the slow evaporation rate. Interestingly, the effect of thermal annealing on molecular packing order depends on the solvent evaporation rates of the as-cast samples. Upon thermal annealing, the molecular packing order of the fast evaporated sample is enhanced with increased π–π stacks. In contrast, thermal annealing will decrease the degree of packing order for the slow evaporated sample since the orientations and conformations of the molecules at the aggregate boundaries are substantially modulated to squeeze the voids. Electrical network analyses point to the fact that the mesoscopic electrical connectivities for all the samples are quite effective and insensitive to the modifications of local molecular ordering due to the delocalized HOMO of DPP(TBFu)2 providing efficient intermolecular electronic interactions. The hole mobilities of all the fabricated samples are thus estimated to be similar and quite high. Finally, our simulations point to the fact that the modest enhancement of mobility upon thermal annealing is correlated with the increased density rather than the varied ordering of molecular packing. Our work provides an atomistic insight into the evolution of thin-film morphology of organic photovoltaic molecular materials during solution processing and thermal annealing treatments and sheds light on the correlation between the molecular structure, packing morphology and hole transport capability.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years.1–4 For solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs),3,4 power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 9% for single active layer devices,5–9 which is comparable to that of polymer solar cells.2,10 Importantly, most of the SMOSCs with high PCEs depend strongly on the additional treatment of their active layers,11 such as solvent additive processing (SAP),12–14 thermal annealing (TA),5–7 and solvent vapor annealing (SVA),6,7,9 to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network of donor (D) and acceptor (A) phases with appropriate domain sizes (10–20 nm) and to optimize the local packing morphology for efficient charge generation. For instance, a high boiling point additive can decrease the solvent evaporation rate and thus allow a longer time for molecular self-organization during solution processing, resulting in a higher degree of phase separation and a larger domain size.11,15 Such distinct variations in nanoscale morphologies are deemed to be responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance obtained by additional treatments or altering the film-processing conditions.11 However, it remains experimentally difficult to obtain precise molecular-scale structural mechanisms within the active layers,16 which are critical to the key electronic processes in OPVs, including exciton diffusion and dissociation, and charge transport and collection, as well as geminate and nongeminate charge recombination.17,18 Recent quantum-chemical (QM) studies on molecular dynamics (MD) simulated or model constructed D/A complexes pointed out that the competition between exciton dissociation and charge recombination is closely relevant to D/A intermolecular arrangements at the interface.19–21 On the other hand, even with an ideal domain size, the molecular packing morphologies in the pure donor or acceptor region can also have an important impact on exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge transport/extraction.22–26
It has been well recognized that the high and balanced carrier (hole and electron) mobilities in organic solar cells could mitigate undesirable nongeminate recombination, thereby leading to a significant increase in the device fill factor (FF) and a notable decrease in power loss.27–29 Through analyzing the carrier mobilities and FFs of a variety of solution-processed SMOSCs, Nguyen et al. suggested that both hole and electron mobilities should be larger than 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to achieve high FFs (>65%). It should be noted that hole mobilities are relatively low and often less than 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic solar cells. Generally, the mobilities of neat films determine the upper limit of blend films and can be used to screen potential small-molecule donor materials.29 Thus it is of great importance to unravel the dependence of the local morphologies of neat donor films on the film-processing conditions.
As organic photovoltaic donors, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated molecules and polymers have attracted much attention due to their favorable properties, such as strong light harvesting capability, high photochemical stability, and excellent carrier mobility.30–42 In particular, DPP(TBFu)2 (Fig. 1a), a prototype DPP-based small molecule, has been intensively studied experimentally.26,34,43–55 The annealed DPP(TBFu)2/PC71BM blend films yielded relatively high PCEs of up to 4.4%.34 Ordered crystalline domains of DPP(TBFu)2 (essentially π–π stacking) were induced by SVA or TA in the blend films,46,50 which is regarded as the driving force for phase separation.50 However, it still remains experimentally difficult to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the morphological variations and optoelectronic functions of organic photovoltaic materials at the molecular level.

The molecules are shown in distinct colors and the inherent alkyl chains and hydrogen atoms are omitted for highlighting the packing of conjugated backbones. 
Here, we have investigated via MD simulations the local molecular packing and ordering of the neat DPP(TBFu)2 donor material as a function of solvent evaporation rate (which is dependent on the nature of the solvent and the presence of additives) and TA treatment. Furthermore, based on the atomic information extracted from the resultant MD trajectories, the dependence of charge transport behaviors on various DPP(TBFu)2 bulk phases has been carefully examined through a multi-scale modelling that combines electronic-structure calculations, electrical network analysis, and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation. Our work provides an unparalleled atomistic insight into the correlation between the processing conditions, thin-film morphologies, and charge transport abilities and would be very helpful for the molecular design and device optimization toward high power conversion efficiencies for organic solar cells.
Computational methods
MD simulations
All the all-atom MD simulations were performed using the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.56 The atom types (Fig. S1, ESI†) and intra- and inter-molecular interaction parameters of the donor DPP(TBFu)2 and solvent chloroform were built from the general AMBER force field (GAFF),57 which is a well-established force field for organic small molecules. Accordingly, partial charges for the two molecules were obtained by the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting method.58,59 Both geometric and lattice parameters of DPP(TBFu)2 were correctly reproduced by the selected force field (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). The MD simulations were carried out under the NPT ensemble using the leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1 fs. Three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions were applied using the Berendsen60 (anisotropic) barostat and the velocity rescaling thermostat61 (both with a relaxation time of 1.0 ps) to respectively control the pressure and temperature. A spherical cutoff of 1.2 nm for the summation of van der Waals (VDW) interactions and the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) solver for long-range Coulomb interactions (with a cutoff of 1.0 nm and a tolerance of 1.0 × 10−5) were used throughout.
Modelling of the solvent evaporation process and thermal annealing treatment
As a preliminary step, we constructed a solution containing 400 DPP(TBFu)2 and 50000 chloroform molecules by opportunely dispersing DPP(TBFu)2 molecules in the solvent using the genbox utility of the Gromacs package56 and an additional NPT equilibration (0.5 ns) to bring the solution close together (with a balanced box size of nearly 20 nm in three dimensions). Chloroform has been proved to be a good solvent for DPP(TBFu)2 through solvent screening based on solubility and cohesive energy density.44
In order to mimic the solvent evaporation process, a quasi-equilibrium approach was employed by randomly removing 100 solvent molecules from the solution at every predefined time dt. Using this scheme, Pao et al. have investigated the evolution of the nanomorphologies of P3HT/PCBM blends during solution processing using coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations.62 Here, two different values of dt were chosen to control the evaporation rates: 1 ps (fast) and 100 ps (slow). The evolution of solutions with fast and slow solvent evaporation processes is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the resultant thin films are labeled as A1 and B1, respectively. To allow the molecules to be fully self-organized, the solution was equilibrated for an additional 15 ns before extraction of solvent to prepare B1. The two individual fabrication processes were held at constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 bar) with a compressibility59 of 1.0 × 10−4 bar−1. After solvent evaporation, the two dried samples were further equilibrated for 10 ns at the same temperature and pressure while with a compressibility of 1.0 × 10−5 bar−1.
To examine the impact of TA treatment on the film quality, the two as-cast samples were firstly heated at 500 K for 10 ns, then quenched to 300 K, and eventually, equilibrated at 300 K for 10 ns. As a consequence, two annealed samples (A2 and B2) were obtained correspondingly (Fig. 1). During the TA process, the pressure was maintained at 1 bar with a compressibility of 1.0 × 10−5 bar−1.
Electrical network analyses
Recently Savoie et al. suggested a graph methodology (or network theory) in combination with electronic-structure calculations to describe the mesoscopic electrical connectivity and charge percolation behaviors in organic semiconductors.25 Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows an example graph of vertices and edges to elucidate the network theory, in which the vertices represent the center-of-masses (COMs) of molecules and the edge thickness corresponds to the strength of electronic coupling between molecules. Electronic coupling (or transfer integral) between frontier molecular orbitals is one of key parameters to determine the charge transfer process between molecules. Obviously, different numbers of sub-networks will result when varying the electronic coupling threshold (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
Following Savoie et al.,25 to identify the mesoscopic electrical connection networks for the four fabricated samples of DPP(TBFu)2, we define an effective intermolecular connection when the HOMO energy difference is smaller than 0.3 eV and electronic coupling is larger than a given threshold value. In this work, the electronic couplings between neighboring DPP(TBFu)2 molecules (the shortest interatomic distance between backbones is less than 0.6 nm, Fig. S4, ESI†) were computed using a semi-empirical Hartree–Fock method based on the Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO) Hamiltonian,63 which has proved to be an efficient and relatively accurate approach and is suitable to deal with calculations on a large number (thousands or even ten thousands) of molecular pairs.64 The network analysis of each sample was performed on 50 snapshots extracted every 10 ps from the final 500 ps of equilibration. We note that, given a certain value of electronic coupling threshold, fewer networks imply better electrical connectivity across the bulk material.
Mobility calculations
Within the hopping description, charge transport can be characterized by a Brownian particle's random diffusion process, in which the charge carrier hops between adjacent molecules according to the charge transfer rates. The charge transfer rate between DPP(TBFu)2 molecules can be calculated by the semi-classical Marcus theory:65 (1)where ℏ denotes the reduced Planck's constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature set to 300 K, λ is the reorganization energy estimated to be 0.265 eV by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, ΔGij is the free energy set to zero, associated with the self-exchange process and the limit of zero field considered here, Vij is the transfer integral between the HOMOs of the two interacting molecules. To assess the role of thermal fluctuations of Vij, i.e., the magnitude of nonlocal electron-phonon couplings, the time distributions of Vij for each molecular pair were formed by 1000 snapshots taken every 30 fs and their fitting with a Gaussian function was obtained (Fig. S5, ESI†). The average value of Vij and its corresponding variance are labeled as 〈Vij〉 and σij, respectively. Three forms of the square of the transfer integral, i.e., 〈Vij〉2, (〈Vij〉 + R)2, and 〈Vij2〉 = 〈Vij〉2 + σ2, were respectively used to estimate the Marcus rate and the final mobility, and R = σijG, where G is a random number between 0 and 1 with a Gaussian distribution. It is noted that most of the Vij values are substantially smaller than λij, validating the feasibility of the non-adiabatic hopping model (Fig. S6, ESI†).
In the low field limit, the carrier mobility can be expressed using the Einstein relation: (2) Therefore, the calculation of the Brownian mobilities can be performed by evaluating the diffusion coefficient D with a set of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations.66–68 For an n-dimensional system, D is defined as the ratio between the mean-square displacement (MSD) and the diffusion time t: (3) For a three-dimensional system, D can be obtained with n = 3. In each KMC simulation, the charge carrier is randomly situated on one molecule in the bulk sample as the starting point. Then the charge hops to the neighboring molecules with a probability of . At each step, a random number x ranging from 0 to 1 is introduced to determine the next site of the charge. If , the charge is assumed to transfer to the j'th molecule, and the simulation time t is incremented by ,68 where y is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The hopping distance corresponds to the intermolecular COM distance. At the end of the simulation time t, one KMC simulation is finished, and 5000 simulations were carried out to assure that the MSD is approximately linear with the simulation time (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Results and discussion
Influence of the solvent evaporation rate and thermal annealing on film quality
Obviously, the four well-fabricated samples have quite different bulk stacking nature (Fig. 1c), which can be quantified by the DPP COM radial distribution functions (RDFs) (Fig. 1b). Considering the distance of typical π–π stacking of ∼0.35 nm and a certain intermolecular slip (Fig. 2a), the first RDF peaks are located at ∼0.4–0.5 nm and the corresponding strengths indicate the degrees of crystallization. Also, the number of π–π stacks for each sample was evaluated to represent the local molecular ordering (Fig. 2b). A π–π stacking molecular pair can be determined according to the distance between DPP COMs (<0.5 nm) and two angles, i.e. the angle θ between the long axes of the conjugated backbones and the angle φ between the normals of the DPP planes (Fig. S8, ESI†). If both θ and φ are zero, the molecular pair is an ideal π–π stack. In reality, due to the thermal dynamic motions and twisted molecular conformations, it can be regarded as a π–π stack when the molecular pair exhibits θ and φ less than 15° (Fig. 1c and 2a).

It is interesting to correlate the different processing conditions with the resulting nanostructures. The fairly weak RDF peak at ∼0.46 nm indicates almost amorphous packing for A1. Indeed, it is hard to find any presence of ordered regions (Fig. 1c). In stark contrast, there exist a lot of well-organized domains in B1 (Fig. 1c and 2a), confirmed by the very sharp first peak at ∼0.42 nm (slightly slip π–π stacks, type I in Fig. 2a), the distinct second peak at ∼0.64 nm (moderately slip π–π stacks, type II) and the third peak at ∼0.83 nm (about twice the first peak position). Furthermore, the number of π–π stacks for B1 (70) is nearly 7 times that for A1 (11) (Fig. 2b). This can be easily understood from the fact that in the case of slower drying (at a lower solvent evaporation rate), DPP(TBFu)2 molecules have enough time to reorient or self-organize to achieve higher crystallinity.
Chloroform, a low boiling point solvent (only 61.2 °C), without SAP, actually has a very fast evaporation rate and thus results in a low crystallinity of the active layer. On the other hand, TA can boost dynamic motions and allow reorientation/recrystallization among the interacting molecules. A partially ordered region can be found in A2 with respect to the as-cast A1 (Fig. 1c). The first RDF peak becomes much stronger and the peak intensity is almost doubled after TA (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the number of π–π stacks is increased from 11 to 29 (Fig. 2b). This is consistent with previous experimental observations that the neat DPP(TBFu)2 films directly spin-casted from chloroform showed no sign of crystallinity and underwent crystallization upon TA.50 Surprisingly, to some extent, the degree of molecular packing order for the slow dried B1 is damaged after TA (Fig. 1c). As seen in Fig. 1b, the first RDF peak for B2 is slightly decreased and the second and third peaks even vanish. In addition, the number of π–π stacks in B2 is reduced from 70 to 62 (Fig. 2b). Nonetheless, the local ordering degree for A2 is still inferior to that for B2.
Another key finding is that both the as-cast samples become more compact after TA. Especially, the decrease for B1 (14.36 nm3) is much larger with respect to A1 (3.79 nm3) so that the volume of B2 gets smaller than that of A2 (Fig. 2c). We recall that many crystalline aggregates have formed during the solution processing of B1. After the solvents disappear, these “rigid” aggregates flock together while leaving considerable gaps among them (Fig. S2, ESI†). The voids will be squeezed through modulating the orientations and conformations of the boundary molecules during TA. However, such modulation is detrimental to the ‘pristine’ ordering. The percentage of the voids in the bulk volume of B1 can be thus estimated to be about 3.25% according to the relative change in volume from B1 to B2. In contrast, for fast solvent evaporation DPP(TBFu)2 molecules appear to be amorphous and relatively more flexible or adaptable, which are beneficial to the formation of a close molecular packing. Therefore, thermal annealing enables the molecules to form more ordered π–π stacking.
It is well known that molecular reorganization or recrystallization upon TA is the result of synergistic effects of intermolecular interaction and thermal motion. Here, the intermolecular interaction energy (EINTER) for each sample was evaluated (Fig. 2d). As expected, π–π stacks can result in very strong EINTER. Despite a smaller volume, A1 has a much weaker EINTER with respect to B1 due to fewer π–π stacks. Because of the increased π–π stacks and decreased volume, EINTER after TA is largely enhanced for A2 with respect to A1, approaching the EINTER of B1. Although the volume decrement from B1 to B2 is much larger than that from A1 to A2, the increases of EINTER are similar, which are ascribed to the opposite changes of π–π stacking numbers upon TA.
To gain a deeper insight into the effect of TA, we also examined the volume and EINTER as a function of annealing time (Fig. S9, ESI†). At the initial heating, both as-cast samples undergo a large thermal expansion (leading to an abrupt decrease of EINTER), followed by a decreasing and then relatively stable volume. It is important to note that, for A1, the EINTER continues to increase even when the volume reaches equilibrium, indicating that some local ordered stacks occur during TA. On the other hand, for B1, the evolution of EINTER is consistent with the change in volume. However, the volume fluctuation is relatively larger than that for A1. To conclude, during TA, the driving force for recrystallization of A1 is mainly the strong π–π interaction, while thermal motion compressing the inter-aggregate voids is responsible for crystallinity reduction in B1.
Electrical network analyses
A high FF, as pointed out above, depends on the efficient mesoscopic (10–20 nm) charge transport in the pure donor or acceptor phase after charge separation. Recently, intermolecular connectivity graphs based on the strengths of electronic couplings have been used to visualize charge transport networks in crystalline or amorphous systems.23,25,64Fig. 3a shows the average number of independent networks (NNET) for each sample as a function of the electronic coupling threshold (VT). At a very weak coupling threshold VT = 1 meV, almost all molecules are connected together. As VT is increased, more and more isolated networks are returned. When VT is equal to a moderate value of 5 meV, the number of networks (NNET) is still nearly the same (∼21) for all the four samples. Then, as VT is increased to 10 meV, NNET appears to be different among the four samples and is consistent with the degrees of ordering of molecular packing. The more ordered sample exhibits fewer networks. Generally, relative to an amorphous domain, the molecules in an ordered region have fewer nearest neighbors (∼2) but greater electronic couplings. Thus, even at a relatively high VT (e.g., 30 meV), the molecules in an ordered region can be still interconnected (Fig. S10, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  (a) Average number of networks (NNET); (b) average number of molecules of the largest network (NMAX) as a function of the electronic coupling threshold (VT) [the insets show the returned largest networks in an example snapshot of B1 at VT = 1, 10, and 20 meV]; (c) illustration of networks for a selected snapshot at VT = 5 and 10 meV [distinct electrical networks have a unique color and the total number of networks is specified] for each fabricated DPP(TBFu)2 sample. 
To elucidate the mesoscopic percolation networks and their robustness, the average number of molecules in the largest network (NMAX) was estimated as a function of VT for each sample (Fig. 3b). The dynamic NMAX values for each sample are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The calculated results are very similar for the four samples. When VT = 5 meV or smaller, irrespective of the different degrees of local ordering and the insulating alkyl chains, DPP(TBFu)2 molecules can form a mesoscopic electrical network that percolate the whole volume (Fig. 3c). The average NMAX value is around 360 for A1, A2 and B2, but gets slightly smaller (∼336) for B1 due to reduction of intermolecular electronic contacts induced by the existence of many voids. The standard deviation of NMAX is small for each sample, suggesting that the percolation network is quite stable. When VT = 10 meV, the average NMAX value is decreased to ∼100 for A2, B1, and B2 and less (∼68) for A1 due to less π–π stacks. The percolation network is much smaller and unstable since the standard deviation of NMAX is extremely large. When VT = 15 meV or larger, it is hard to find any mesoscopic electrical networks for each sample.

Fig. 4a shows the average number of connections per molecule (NC) for each sample. It should be mentioned that a continuous and robust network can be formed only when each molecule has ≥2 connected neighbors. At a weak threshold VT = 1 meV, NC is in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 and it is relatively larger for the sample with less π–π stacks. When VT = 10 meV or more, the situation is reversed. However, because NC is smaller than 2, the improvement in charge transport would be very limited for the relatively ordered sample with better electrical connectivity. Interestingly, when NC = 2, the threshold couplings are close to a moderate value of 5 meV for all samples, indicating similar and good conductive capabilities for the four samples. This is owing to the HOMO of DPP(TBFu)2 delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone (Fig. S12, ESI†), which can lead to considerable electronic couplings for the dimers with small edge contacts or large intermolecular distances (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).

Hole mobility
The calculated hole mobilities for the different samples are shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, the dynamic disorder of electronic couplings induced by thermal fluctuation has a significant contribution to the mobility for each sample. Considering the variance of electronic couplings, the mobility is increased by twice if V2 = (〈V〉 + R)2 and even by 3–4 times V2 = 〈V〉2 + σ2. As expected, the calculated hole mobilities are of the same order of magnitude for all the samples and slightly increased after thermal annealing. This is consistent with the experimental results while the measured mobilities are about one order of magnitude smaller, 1.7 × 10−3 and 2.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast and annealed DPP(TBFu)2 (mesomer) films, respectively.47
Currently, it is a common understanding that organic semiconductors with more ordered molecular packing have higher carrier mobilities. However, the calculated results show that the B1 sample has the lowest mobility despite the most ordered packing among the four samples. This can be ascribed to the fact that many of the gaps between the ordered regions in B1 are harmful to continuous efficient charge transport throughout the whole system, as confirmed by the least number of connections using a small threshold of electronic coupling. Interestingly, it is found that the hole mobilities are correlated well with the mass densities among the samples. Larger density will result in higher mobility. Hence, the modest enhancement of mobility by TA treatment can be mainly attributed to the more dense molecular packing, instead of the variation of molecular ordering. This is also supported by the KMC simulations with the charge-transfer rates obtained using the Marcus–Levich–Jortner formula, which can consider the quantum nature of the vibration modes governing local electron-phonon couplings and lead to even higher mobilities (Fig. S15, ESI†). Interestingly, very recently, Xu et al. have found that the OPV of higher performance has a denser photoactive layer by two-dimensional X-ray diffraction measurements in combination with density mapping with respect to the crystallinity of thin films.69 For instance, the density of the dried P3HT/PC61BM film as-cast from chlorobenzene at room temperature was increased (1.049 → 1.068 g cm−3) after TA at 120 °C; as a consequence, the FF was improved from 50% to 69%. This observation is consistent with our simulated results that a denser sample has a higher charge mobility and hence a higher FF in OPVs.29
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the influence of the solvent evaporation rate and thermal annealing on the local molecular packing morphologies of DPP(TBFu)2 by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. As expected, an amorphous as-cast molecular packing is formed with a fast solvent evaporation rate (A1). While slow evaporation of solvent allows pre-aggregation of DPP(TBFu)2 to produce a relatively high ordering of molecular packing, a lot of voids between the aggregates are left in the as-cast film (B1). Importantly, after thermal annealing both the as-cast samples become more compact. For the as-cast amorphous sample (A1 → A2), a more number of close π–π stacks are formed, leading to increases in both packing density and ordering. Upon thermal annealing of the ordered as-cast sample (B1 → B2), the crystallinity is reduced to some extent, as a result of squeezing the voids via important molecular reorientation and motion at the aggregate boundaries.
Electrical network analyses show that at a given (large) electronic coupling threshold, the number of networks is decreased with the increasing ordering of molecular packing among the four fabricated samples. Nonetheless, the two as-cast samples and their annealed samples display similar capabilities to form effective mesoscopic electrical networks throughout the samples due to the delocalized HOMO over the whole backbone of DPP(TBFu)2 providing efficient intermolecular electronic interactions. As a consequence, all the samples exhibit good hole mobilities of the same order of magnitude. In addition, the mobility is positively correlated with the sample density, instead of the degree of molecular packing order. Thus, the modest enhancement of hole mobility after thermal annealing arises mainly from the increased compactness of the thin films.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structure of DPP(TBFu)2, (b) center-of-mass radial distribution functions of the DPP moiety, and (c) molecular packing morphologies of the as-cast (A1 and B1) and thermally annealed (A2 and B2) DPP(TBFu)2 thin films fabricated at a fast (A1 and A2) or slow (B1 and B2) solvent evaporation rate. The molecules are shown in distinct colors and the inherent alkyl chains and hydrogen atoms are omitted for highlighting the packing of conjugated backbones.	 
	(1)
	(2)
	(3)

 	Fig. 2  (a) An example snapshot of the well-ordered region from B1, (b) number of π–π stacks, (c) volume, and (d) intermolecular interaction energy (EINTER) for each sample.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Average number of networks (NNET); (b) average number of molecules of the largest network (NMAX) as a function of the electronic coupling threshold (VT) [the insets show the returned largest networks in an example snapshot of B1 at VT = 1, 10, and 20 meV]; (c) illustration of networks for a selected snapshot at VT = 5 and 10 meV [distinct electrical networks have a unique color and the total number of networks is specified] for each fabricated DPP(TBFu)2 sample.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Average number of connections per molecule (NC) in DPP(TBFu)2 samples as a function of the electronic coupling threshold (VT); (b) mass densities (ρ) and hole mobilities (μ) for each sample based on the charge-transfer rates estimated using 〈V〉2, (〈V〉 + R)2, and 〈V2〉 = 〈V〉2 + σ2 as the square of electronic couplings, respectively.
