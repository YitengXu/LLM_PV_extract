    , Accepted 20th July 2020First published on 24th July 2020AbstractWe study the particle size distribution and phase changes of the anatase TiO2 nanopowder samples when they are subject to the plasma treatments of three different kinds of gases as nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and argon (Ar). The plasma gas pressures vary as 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 Torr. We demonstrate that the plasma treatments have an effect neither on the phase structure nor on the mean nanocrystalline size. The phase and size invariances of the samples are attributed to their nanoscale thermodynamic aspects. We find out that elevating the gas pressure in some cases creates fine-size amorphous nanoparticles with a narrow distribution. Our findings authenticate that plasma treatment affects the amorphous phase with etching particles down to a mean value of ∼3 nm. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique was utilized to obtain the size distribution of the nanoparticles, and the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) technique was used to probe the phase and size changes of the crystalline structure.
Introduction
TiO2 is available in four phases as anatase, rutile, brookite, and amorphous, which has garnered significant attention owing to its sundry applications that encompass photocatalysis,1,2 photovoltaics,3,4 sensors,5 and biomedical sciences.6 A nanostructure anatase TiO2 with a large specific surface area has been fabricated and presented as an attractive material in the fabrication of biosensors.7 It has been indicated that anatase TiO2 nanorods are a preferable choice for the storage and release of Li ions for Li-based batteries.8 The physical properties of TiO2, such as refractive index and chemical and photochemical reactivity, are dependent on the particle size and the phase.9,10 The anatase phase of TiO2 exists in a crystallographic form as a = b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å; space group D4h,19I41/amd.11 This phase of TiO2 has appeared as an active material for the next-generation of energy power sources.12–15 The anatase hollow TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were employed to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and a prompted power conversion efficiency of 25% was achieved16 The origin of the higher CO2 adsorption capacity in terms of the high specific surface area of the amorphous TiO2 NPs and the modification with ethylenediamine on the surface of these NPs has been discussed.17 The improved photocatalytic performance is related to the crystalline phase of the NPs and their provided relatively large specific surface area. The larger surface area of the solid catalyst will result in faster reactions, as this could be provided with introducing NPs in the catalysts.
Amorphous-TiO2 owns relatively poor photocatalytic activity, compared to the crystalline phases.18 Regarding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, it is reported that the Ag/amorphous-TiO2 composite presents a much higher photocatalytic efficiency compared to the Ag/crystalline composites.19 Amorphous-TiO2 is utilized as a stabilizer to manage photoanodes in aqueous alkaline electrolytes.20 High specific surface area exhibited by amorphous-TiO2 makes it a potential candidate for catalysts for pollutants in wastewater.21
From a technological point of view, the improved catalytic performance is related to the crystalline phase of the NPs and their provided relatively large specific surface area. The larger surface area of the solid catalyst will result in faster reactions, as this could be provided with introducing NPs in the catalysts. Utilizing various plasma techniques in preparing nanocatalysts has been received much attention since 1990.22,23 It has been reported that the plasma techniques provide catalysts preparing procedure with better size controlling towards improved catalytic properties.24–31 The cold plasma, one technique amongst several others, is featured with its far-from-equilibrium state at relatively low temperatures. The low-temperature aspect of plasma treatment facilitates the production of the structures more accurately, compared with thermal methods. It has been reported that plasma treatment could cause permanent changes in catalysts. Using a glow discharge plasma to treat Ce-doped ZnO catalyst, Maofi et al.32 concluded that the plasma treatment does not change the phase structure, while the catalyst morphology thoroughly changes.
Plasma techniques have already been implemented to etching the nanostructures. Liu et al.33 used Ar+ plasma to layer-by-layer thinning of MoS2 nanosheets down to monolayer. The yielded NPs by plasma treatment own negative charge, which prevents their agglomeration and leads to a narrow particle size distribution.
The salience of TiO2 photocatalysts has stemmed from their strong optical absorptivity, chemical stability, low cost, and high reactivity.34–37 However, a bare TiO2 photocatalyst is active solely under the UV light regime, corresponding to 3 to 5 percent of sunlight. Hence, the augmentation of the visible-light absorptivity of TiO2 is of utmost importance.38–40 In this context, hydrogen plasma treatment is an auspicious method that ameliorates the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 photocatalysts under solar-light illumination.41,42 It seems that plasma techniques have enormous potential in catalysts preparation. Meanwhile, understanding the plasma-assisted catalysts preparation method is in the early stages and requires more in-depth studies.
The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a promising method to probe the structure of matter with a typical length scale of 1–100 nm, depending on the used wavelength. In this technique, the scattering intensity is measured versus wave vector transfer  in a very small angle regime. Since the X-ray scattering profile is sensitive to the electron density contrast in the matter, it could give structural information about mesoscopic density fluctuations. Moreover, the measured scattering intensity is the spherically averaged Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of the electron density. Thus, the information about smaller structures is dominant at larger qs.
Applying SAXS and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) techniques, the anatase TiO2 of pristine and plasma-treated samples were investigated. The aim of this paper is that of using these two main techniques, as well as other complementary ones as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), to evaluate the influence of the plasma treatment on the particle size and phase structure of the TiO2 NPs. Physical parameters as the average size of NPs and their number density distribution along with potential phase structure changes will be studied through SAXS and WAXS methods to critically examine the important nanoscale aspects of the interaction of plasma with TiO2 nanoparticles that have been insufficiently covered in plasma catalysis literature.
Experimental procedures
Glow discharge plasma treatments
The glow discharge plasma is produced when an electric current passes through a gas in a glass tube, and an electric voltage between two electrodes in the tube is applied. In this technique, the applied voltage must exceed a certain value, so self-sustained gas ionization is formed. In our experiment, plasma is generated by the two electrodes connected to AC high-voltage of 1 kV, 20 W, and f ∼ 12–18 kHz power supply.
The plasma is formed in a reactor of a Pyrex tube with a size of 40 cm × 5 cm. During the plasma treatment, the anatase TiO2 powder sample was located in the reactor. The tube was evacuated before discharge creation.
In this study, we have examined the effect of three plasma feeding gases: nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and argon (Ar) on the anatase TiO2 powders that had been produced by the sol-microwave method explained in Shojaie et al. work.43 The treatment time for each sample was fixed at 45 minutes. The experiment was done under three chamber pressures of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 Torr, for each sample.
SAXS and WAXS experiments
SAXS and WAXS experiments were performed using the instrument located at the BL11-NCD-SWEET beamline at the ALBA synchrotron facility in Spain. This instrument uses a photon-counting detector for SAXS (Pilatus 1M) and a CCD for WAXS experiments (Rayonix-LX-255-HS). Scattering curves were recorded at an X-ray wavelength of 0.99 Å. SAXS experiments were performed within an accessible q range of 0.15–3.5 nm−1. Thus, the largest resolvable particle size is about 40 nm. All SAXS data were fully corrected for the effect of background subtraction. Data reduction and data analysis were carried out using the Irena package.44 SEM analysis has been utilized to probe the TiO2 microstructures directly and the TEM technique was used to image the pattern of NPs.

It is observed that the anatase crystalline phase is not modified because of plasma treatment. The peak positions of the diffraction pattern stay intact when the gas pressure or gas kind changes, emphasizing that the phase transformation has not occurred. The mean crystalline size of the NPs was calculated through Sherrer formula . In this equation, λ is the X-ray wavelength used (≈1 Å), θ is the Bragg angle and FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the Bragg peak. Interestingly, the mean crystalline size of the NPs of the samples before and after plasma treatment, summarized in Table 2, stays about 10–11 nm for (101) reflection (the first pronounced peak).

The phase changing in TiO2 under the influence of visible light,48 laser irradiation,49 or heat treatment50 during the growth has already been reported. The role of particle size in the TiO2 phase transformation has already been investigated.51 For microcrystalline TiO2, rutile is the most thermodynamically stable phase.52,53 However, for particles with nanometer-scale sizes, the total free energy of the substance strongly depends on the surface free energy, and surface enthalpy dictates the phase stability order of three phases.51 The averaged surface enthalpies of anatase and rutile are 1.34 and 1.93 J m−2, respectively,54 and the surface enthalpy of brookite can be estimated as 1.66 J m−2.55 The transformation from anatase to rutile upon heating is attributed to the increase in particle size when elevated temperatures cause particle sintering.55 In Zhang et al. work,51 the enthalpy of a single nano-TiO2 phase relative to the enthalpy of the rutile phase with infinite size has been calculated, and the following formulas have been given: (1) (2) (3)where subscripts R, A, and B stand for rutile, anatase, and brookite, respectively. The unit for particle size D in the above equations is in nanometer. Based on the above relations, the rutile phase is the most stable one for particles with sizes greater than 35 nm. Meanwhile, the most stable phase for particles with a size range of 11–35 nm is brookite, and anatase is the most stable phase for particles with sizes of less than or about 11 nm. Thus, the anatase nanocrystalline phase and size invariance under the influence of the plasma treatment can be explained by its nanoscale thermodynamic aspects. The nanocrystalline size invariance complementarily affirms the phase invariance concluded from analyzing the WAXS data.
Considering the phase and size invariance of the crystalline NPs, the only possible reason for different SAXS profiles resides in the presence of the amorphous phase in the structure of the samples. The SEM image in Fig. 2(a) illustrates the morphology of the pristine sample. A microstructure of amorphous phase and nanocrystalline anatase particles can be observed. Fig. 2(b) shows the nanostructured amorphous TiO2. Fig. 2(c) with a relatively large number of particles was analyzed to give mean particle size and standard deviation (σ) as 15.39 nm and 2.33 nm, respectively, corroborating the results from the Scherrer equation up to a great extent. The associated size histogram is depicted in Fig. 2(d). To have information on the composition, EDX patterns of the samples, before and after plasma treatment, were acquired (Fig. S2, ESI†) and showed no difference.

Fig. 3(a) shows the SAXS intensity profiles of the samples treated with N2 feeding gas along with the pristine sample. Separate plots were made to improve the clarity to show the effect of the gas pressure rise. The SAXS intensity profile alters upon changing the gas pressure from 0.1 to 0.3 Torr. The intensity profiles of the pristine sample and the sample with 0.1 Torr pressure of feeding N2 gas are almost identical. This indicates that the signatures of morphological changes of the sample require a threshold gas pressure above 0.1 Torr to appear. The change in the SAXS profile by varying the gas pressure to 0.3 Torr is disclosed through extending the SAXS intensity profile to higher-q ranges up to 2.5 nm−1. At the same time, it is discernible that the increasing gas pressure to 0.6 Torr does not noticeably affect the SAXS intensity profile anymore. The scattering intensity in the high-q region will represent fine-sized particles. On the other hand, the intensity in the low-q region arises from scattering from larger particles or aggregate of smaller particles. Therefore, it is obvious to see from Fig. 3(a) that elevating gas pressure from 0.1 to 0.3 Torr inside the reactor leads to fine amorphous NPs (a-NPs), but further pressure increase to 0.6 Torr has no more notable effect on the a-NPs size. Fig. 3(b) illustrates the number distribution of the particles in the q-range considered in this work. For the pristine sample, analysis of the SAXS data suggests a distribution of particles that includes a broad peak extending up to about 15 nm of particle size convoluted with a Gaussian-like distribution. For the treated samples, this convoluted pattern of the number distribution is repeated. Furthermore, for some of the treated samples, a new sharp Gaussian peak appears in size range ∼2–3.5 nm, labeled as Pnew. A numerical deconvolution technique was used to separate the convoluted patterns in size range ∼3.5–15 nm into Gaussian peaks (see Fig. 4 and Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). Table 3 summarizes the physical parameters obtained by such a deconvolution method. Table S2 (ESI†) reports the coefficient of determination (R2) and degree of freedoms (DOFs) related to the deconvolution of the number distributions. The deconvolution method results in up to six Gaussian peaks, which we name them DP1 to DP6. The greatest mean values of the deconvoluted peaks vary between 9.5–12.5 nm.

The analysis of the WAXS data inspires that the deconvoluted peak associated with the greatest mean particle size (DP5 or DP6) is attributed to the nanocrystalline distribution of particles. In most cases, the mean particle sizes obtained by the Sherrer equation excellently agree with values obtained by the deconvolution method. In some cases, those are within the ±1 nm range of the values obtained by the deconvolution method. Consistently, the other DPs would describe a-NPs distributions. The analysis of the WAXS data proves that plasma treatment does not affect the phase and mean nanocrystalline size of the samples. Meanwhile, the analysis of the SAXS data shows that it could change the number distribution of the particles. Hence, it is concluded that the effect of plasma is just manifested in etching particles from the amorphous phase.
Applying N2 plasma gas with 0.1 Torr pressure does not alter the number distribution, as depicted in Fig. 3(b). The number density of scatterers (NDS), which can be obtained by calculating the surface area under the number distribution curve, is given in Table 4. Almost the same NDS of the pristine sample and the sample treated by 0.1 pressure of the N2 gas confirms the latter conclusion. However, 0.3 and 0.6 gas pressures in the reactor have two main effects on the number distribution pattern: creating a new size distribution in the size range ∼2–3.5 nm (Pnew) and reducing the number densities in the range ∼3.5–15 nm. It is legitimate to assume that etched particles by plasma from amorphous microstructures (and nanostructures) with a length scale of greater than 40 nm contribute to the new-created distribution. The obtained mean particle size for this new peak (∼3 nm) concurs with the reported size of a-NPs before forming polymorphs of TiO2.17,56

The SAXS intensity profiles of the samples treated by the O2 gas and their theoretical fits are shown in Fig. 5(a). A comparison of the profiles reveals a considerable extension of SAXS curves into the larger qs when the gas pressure rises to 0.1 and 0.3 Torr. Nonetheless, increasing gas pressure from 0.3 to 0.6 Torr does not influence the SAXS curve, and qmax remains unaltered. In Fig. 5(b), the effect of 0.1 Torr pressure of O2 gas on the number distribution is more pronounced, compared to N2 plasma gas with the same pressure. The calculated NDS shows a slight increase compared to the NDS of the pristine sample (Table 4). Applying 0.3 and 0.6 Torr gas pressures, the narrow distribution (Pnew) appears in size range ∼2–3.5 nm, where the associated NDS shows a noticeable increase concerning the one in size range ∼4–15 nm.

The total NDS has increased compared to the one associated with the pristine sample. The reason for these increases could stem from the two main processes. First, the O2 plasma etches a-NPs within the size range ∼4–15 nm, so that the NDS declines in this size range, and then adds the etched a-NPs to the particles in size range ∼2–3.5 nm. Second, plasma severs particles from the amorphous microstructures and elevates the population of a-NPs in size range ∼2–3.5 nm.
It is evident from Fig. 6(a) that the SAXS intensity profiles expand into larger qs with elevating the gas pressure of the Ar plasma in the reactor. Increasing gas pressure to 0.1 Torr allows qs up to qmax = 1.8 nm−1. The qmax for 0.3 and 0.6 Torr of the Ar gas pressures are 2.1 and 2.6 nm−1, respectively. In contrast to the samples treated by the N2 and O2 plasma gases, qmax monotonically increases with raising the gas pressure. The corresponding number distributions for the samples treated by the Ar plasma gas are shown in Fig. 6(b). The deconvolution method gives five Gaussian peaks in size range ∼3.5–15 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). As seen from Table 4, by increasing the gas pressure, the total NDS goes up, monotonically. Using 0.1 and 0.3 Torr pressures, the Ar plasma will etch particles from amorphous microstructures to elevate the population of the a-NPs in size range ∼3.5–15 nm compared to the pristine sample. At the same time, using 0.6 Torr pressure creates Pnew in the number distribution curve with the greatest NDS among the three employed gases.

The Pnew appears when applying a pressure of 0.6 Torr for all three cases, as reported in Table 3. For 0.3 Torr pressure, however, Pnew appears when the N2 and O2 gases are employed. At the same pressure, using Ar plasma gas in the reactor does not create the same effect. For 0.1 Torr gas pressure, none of the plasma gases can create that effect. The plasma sheath formed over the samples inside the reactor plays an important role in the etching process, where it controls the flow of positive ions from the bulk plasma to the samples. The electrons, due to their higher velocities compared to the negative and positive ions in the plasma, are the first particles to locate on the surface of the nanopowders. Such electrons form a negative potential on the surface of the nanopowders perturbing the plasma inside the reactor, so a positively charged cloud of ions known as sheath will form around the samples at a distance noted as sheath length. In the process of a-NPs etching, positive ions with velocities greater than the Bohm velocity  would be allowed to pass from bulk plasma to the sheath region and reach to the NPs. In the formula, e is the electron charge, Te is the electron temperature in eV, and M is the positive ionic mass. Due to the relative higher atomic mass of Ar, it is expected that Ar plasma will etch particles into smaller sizes compared to the other two gases.
However, N2 and O2 plasma gases were able to create fine-size particles by applying a pressure of 0.3 Torr, whereas the same pressure of Ar plasma gas is not able to do so. This could attach to the effect of the presence of nitrogen and oxygen negative ions in the plasma to reduce the Bohm velocity. The modified Bohm velocity in the presence of the negative ions is given,57 (4)where αs = ns−/nse is the ratio of the negative ions to electrons, and γ = Te/Ti. Te is the electron temperature (1 eV is about 11600 K) and Ti is the ion temperature. Fig. 7 depicts the minimum of the Bohm velocity versus αs. As seen, increasing the αs the Bohm velocity plummets for nitrogen and oxygen negative ions in the energy range applicable for a glow discharge plasma (Te ∼ 2 eV, Ti ∼ 0.05 eV). Considering the Bohm velocity as a threshold velocity for positive ions to enter into the active plasma region, lowering the velocity as a result of introducing negative ions in the plasma atmosphere will increase the number density of the ions. This, in turn, could lead to promoting the probability of interaction between the ions in the plasma and particles of the anatase sample. The created size range of ∼2–3.5 nm is a result of such promoted interactions for the pressures of 0.3 Torr in the case of N2 and O2 plasma gases. The positive oxygen ions have less Bohm velocity compared to positive nitrogen ions, which inevitably leads to a higher interaction rate. This is manifested in the NDS listed in Table 4. The NDS in the range of 2–3.5 nm has almost doubled when using O2 plasma gas compared to N2. This could mean that the interactions of O2 plasma gas occur approximately two times more than N2 plasma gas, leading to more etched particles. Besides, the atomic mass of the oxygen is greater than that of the nitrogen. Therefore, the momentum transferred to the anatase nanoparticles will be greater than that of the case when using N2 gas. Increasing the gas pressure to 0.6 Torr, for all three of the plasma gases, will provide an elevated number of electrons and ions so that a higher flux of them pass through the sheath region to arrive on the sample and produce fine-size particles in size range ∼2–3.5 nm. In this pressure, the higher atomic mass of the Ar ions will play a prominent role in etching particles more effectively compared to the other two plasma gases as the NDS of the etched particles forged ahead, as reported in Table 4.

We have investigated the phase structure and particle size distribution of the anatase TiO2 nanopowder samples when exposed to the plasma of three gases of N2, O2, and Ar. The study was done under three plasma gas pressures as 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 Torr. The phase and mean nanocrystalline size invariance of the samples under the plasma treatment were explained due to the nanoscale thermodynamic behavior of them. For N2 and O2 gases, scattering upon the measurement window of ∼3.5–15 nm indicates an increase in the NDS of amorphous particles due to the increase in the plasma gas pressure from 0.1 to 0.3 Torr. This was explained by introducing negative ions of the plasma gas as they reduce the threshold Bohm velocity to allow a greater number of positive ions to interact with the sample. Furthermore, applying 0.6 Torr of plasma gas induces a well-separated a-NPs distribution in the size range ∼2–3.5 nm In this size range, the number density associated with the high-pressure Ar plasma gas was greater than the corresponding values when two other gases were used. This was attributed to the higher atomic mass of Ar.
