    , Accepted 25th February 2013First published on 27th February 2013AbstractHigh efficiency organic and hybrid solar cells create demand for novel electron acceptor materials that possess appropriate energetic band levels and bandgap for efficient solar energy harnessing. We present hybrid bulk heterojunction devices based on P3HT and bismuth sulfide nanocrystals, a semiconductor based on environmentally friendly compounds, with a power conversion efficiency of 1% and NIR sensitization at 700 nm of 30%, among the highest ever reported for P3HT.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have seen tremendous progress since the first device was reported in 1986,1 having nowadays reached close to the 10% power conversion level in single junction structures.2 In the quest for higher efficiencies, major effort is being invested in developing new low-bandgap polymers to overcome the bandgap mismatch of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with respect to the optimum for solar energy harnessing. At the same time, these novel low-bandgap polymers enable improved solar harnessing based on tandem devices.3 On the other hand, fullerene derivatives still remain the acceptor materials of choice in conjunction with both the traditional and the recently developed polymers. Phenyl-C61-Butyric-Acid-Methyl Ester (PCBM) and more recently Phenyl-C71-Butyric-Acid-Methyl Ester (PC70BM) have been widely employed in organic photovoltaics due to the ultrafast exciton splitting and charge transfer dynamics.4–7 Nowadays, research on novel acceptors arises due to the limited absorption of fullerene derivatives together with their inappropriate electronic bandgap for optimum solar harnessing and the high cost associated with the fullerene derivatives employed in high efficiency organic photovoltaics.8,9 The limited absorption and the inappropriate bandgap lead to reduced absorption in polymer-fullerene derivatives bulk heterojunction devices.
Hybrid solar cells combine the robustness and solution processability of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) with the low-temperature solution processing of polymers, for their integration into low-cost roll-to-roll fabrication processes.10 Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells have been demonstrated employing various nanocrystal materials.10,11 P3HT–CdS nanocomposites have reached Power Conversion Efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 4% following a chemical grafting approach that ensures an intimate contact between the quantum dots (QDs) and the P3HT nanowires.12 When employing novel low-bandgap polymers such as poly[2,6-(N-(1-octylonyl)dithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]pyrrole)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTPBT) together with lead sulfide (PbS) CQDs, a PCE of 3.78% was achieved.13 These recent advances have positioned hybrid solar cells close to the PCE of the well-established fullerene derivative-based solar cells. On the other hand, new materials that do not contain toxic heavy metals such as cadmium and lead are currently under investigation due to the environmental and regulatory acceptance concerns of the state-of-the-art CQDs. Materials such as bismuth sulfide,14,15 cuprous oxide,16 iron disulfide17 and copper indium sulfide (CIS)18 have been recently reported in hybrid solar cell devices as environmentally friendly alternatives for they do not rely on toxic heavy metal compounds. Large bandgap semiconductors such as quantum confined silicon NCs,19 ZnO20 and TiO221 have also been investigated, yet they do not overcome any of the limitations of fullerene derivatives, since they do not contribute to the photogeneration of carriers in the VIS-NIR range. They lead instead to new device architectures, such as pseudo-ordered bulk heterojunctions, including brush-like22,23 or mesoporous24 structures. A more extensive list of the materials reported in hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells has been reviewed elsewhere.25
Hybrid solar cells not only face some of the challenges of organic photovoltaics such as the critical nanomorphology and performance degradation but introduce new challenges such as ligand exchange processes to replace the long insulating capping molecules by shorter molecules, enabling efficient charge transport through NCs-based solids.26 These new molecules must also allow the interaction of the NCs with the polymers while preserving the intimate contact at the nanoscale.
In this manuscript we present the first hybrid bulk heterojunction devices using P3HT and a promising, toxic-free and earth-abundant nanomaterial, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) NCs. We demonstrate an efficient generic ligand exchange method that cross-links the NCs to enable efficient charge transport through the inorganic phase. We address the role of the Electron Transport Layer (ETL), comparing a large bandgap n-type semiconductor (zinc oxide – ZnO) with a Bi2S3 NCs-based solid. We observe that ZnO allows for a better harnessing of the short wavelengths as a result of poor minority carrier lifetime in the Bi2S3 NC layer.15 The optimized bulk heterojunction devices show power conversion efficiencies of 1%, with NIR sensitization up to 30%. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, among the highest P3HT's NIR sensitization levels ever reported.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device structure, consisting of a zinc oxide ETL, the hybrid bulk heterojunction, a P3HT hole transport layer (HTL) and a molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and silver (Ag) electrode. Control bilayer devices were also fabricated for comparison purposes. Details of the fabrication of bilayer devices are published elsewhere.15 A cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device is presented in Fig. 1b and transmission electron microscopy images of the synthesized Bi2S3 NCs are provided in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We observe that the Bi2S3 NCs tend to form large (∼150 nm) agglomerates within the film, whereas the P3HT regions are typically smaller. The nanomorphology of these devices shows a distributed heterojunction throughout the active layer. Photogenerated carriers can be physically separated into the two media and have a continuous percolation path to the collecting electrodes.

It is of utmost importance to replace the original long insulating capping molecules by shorter molecules in order to extract the photogenerated carriers from the nanocrystals and transport them to their respective collecting electrodes. We have used ethanedithiol (EDT) molecules for the ligand exchange process since small bidentate thiol molecules have been widely reported to improve the carrier mobility of metal chalcogenide NCs.27 This process has a twofold role. On one hand, the inter NC spacing is greatly reduced, favoring charge hopping between adjacent NCs. On the other hand, the thiol group passivates midgap trap states at the NC surface, which would otherwise act as recombination centers.28 To address the effectiveness of the ligand exchange process, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometry (FTIR) experiments were carried out (Fig. 2). The most characteristic features of the oleate-capped-Bi2S3 sample are the dips at ∼1525 cm−1 and ∼1400 cm−1, which are attributed to the –COO− stretching. The thiophene bands (1535–1515 cm−1) partially embed the ∼1525 cm−1 band of oleate-capped Bi2S3. However the band at ∼1400 cm−1 is still visible after mixing Bi2S3 with the P3HT. This band disappears after the EDT ligand exchange treatment, thus indicating a nearly complete removal of the original oleate ligands and their substitution by the shorter EDT molecules.

The disappearance of the band at ∼1400 cm−1 after the ligand exchange process is attributed to the removal of the original oleate capping ligands and their replacement by the shorter EDT molecules. The line at 1400 cm−1 is provided as a guide to the eye. 
Photovoltaic devices that did not undergo the ligand exchange process showed poor performance limited by the low short-circuit current density (Jsc), reaching a PCE level of 0.1%. The insulating oleic acid molecules that allow for the solution processing of NCs also prevent the charge transfer between the Bi2S3 NCs and the P3HT. We observe that after the ligand exchange process with EDT, the performance of the hybrid solar cells is strongly enhanced due to a better charge transfer between NCs and the polymer.
To determine the effect of the ETL, we compare EDT-exchanged bulk heterojunction devices using Bi2S3 and ZnO as ETL. Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage characteristics for these two devices. For comparison, also the I–V characteristics of a control bilayer device are shown in this figure. The use of ETL has been found to be important in device performance for it reduces surface recombination at the metal–semiconductor interface. Devices without the ETL are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) to underperform due to reduction of Voc and Jsc. The figures of merit are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the control bilayer device, we observe a two-fold increase in power conversion efficiency due to a 2.5-fold increase in the short-circuit current density in BHJ devices that have undergone the EDT ligand exchange process. The BHJ devices reach External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) levels of ca. 30% at 700 nm and extending into a portion of the NIR wavelengths where Bi2S3 is the only absorbing phase (Fig. 3b and Fig. S3, ESI†). This is a three-fold increase compared to the bilayer counterpart, thus indicating a very efficient charge transfer and carrier transport through the EDT-exchanged Bi2S3 due to the NCs cross-linking role of EDT. In this wavelength range carriers are only generated in the Bi2S3 due to the higher bandgap energy of P3HT. Devices employing a Bi2S3 ETL fabricated by a layer-by-layer (LBL) approach yielded PCE levels of 0.9% whereas ZnO-based devices showed similar Voc and FF but a larger Jsc (9.2 mA cm−2), for a PCE of 1.0%. The origin for the larger Jsc can be seen in Fig. 3b. The EQE levels of both samples with different ETL are similar in the NIR range, reaching as high as 30% at 700 nm, but the ZnO device outperforms at UV-VIS wavelengths. Since the ETL is not in intimate contact with a neighbouring dissociating interface, photons absorbed in this layer generate charges that undergo undesired recombination due to the low minority carrier diffusion length in Bi2S3, limiting the Jsc in devices based on Bi2S3 ETL.15 Taking into account the number of absorbed photons, we have calculated the IQE of the BHJ device with the ZnO ETL (Fig. 3c). We observe an ∼80% absorption of the VIS wavelengths, which suggests that the short-circuit current density is limited by carrier recombination rather than optical absorption. It is noteworthy that IQE approaches 60% in the visible part of the spectrum, which is strongly absorbed near the front side of the cell, and drops to ∼30% at the band-edge of Bi2S3. The NIR part of the spectrum is absorbed more uniformly throughout the device and thus this observation points to poor electron transport via the Bi2S3 network. Further gains can thus be expected upon improving the electron mobility in the Bi2S3 NC network. Integration of the EQE with the solar spectrum predicts a Jsc of 9.9 mA cm−2 at one-sun intensities, which is only ∼10% higher than the observed value (9.2 mA cm−2) for the device with a ZnO ETL.

We have previously reported that one of the limitations of a Bi2S3–P3HT bilayer solar cell is the unbalanced charge transport, which causes the devices to be space charge limited.15 Nanoscale charge separation in a bulk nanoheterojunction solar cell has recently been found to prolong the carrier lifetime in PbS–Bi2S3 heterojunctions, overcoming the poor minority carrier transport in the Bi2S3.29 To investigate the limiting mechanism in our devices and compare it to the limitations in the bilayer case, we have monitored the short-circuit current density of the devices at several laser intensities at a wavelength of 635 nm (Fig. 4). The exponent of the relationship between Jsc and power density can be indicative of a generation-limited device or space-charge limited device.30 The performance of the Bi2S3–P3HT bilayer device is limited by the build-up of space charge regions, as reflected by an exponent of 0.64. On the other hand, the bulk heterojunction device where only one layer of the BHJ has been deposited and ligand exchanged shows an exponent of 0.91, which is indicative of a generation-limited device. This suggests that by increasing the light absorption using a thicker active layer, the Jsc could be improved with minimal loss in the FF and open circuit voltage (Voc). Indeed, the single layer device (thickness ∼150 nm) showed a Voc of 0.34 V, a Jsc of 6.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.32, for a final PCE of 0.7% while the double layer BHJ device (thickness ∼350 nm) showed a slightly lower Voc (0.30 V), a similar FF (0.36) but a larger Jsc (9.2 mA cm−2). Even further increase in the BHJ thickness did not increase the Jsc, but showed a detrimental effect on the FF and Voc of the devices, indicating that the recombination process has taken over charge transport.
 Fig. 4  Intensity dependent short-circuit current density under 635 nm laser illumination for bilayer (circles) and bulk heterojunction (diamonds) devices. Solid lines correspond to the best fittings of the data with a power-law dependence. The almost unity exponent for a BHJ device is indicative of a generation-limited device, while bilayer devices are space charge limited. 
The performance of the new generation of organic solar cells has exhibited IQE levels approaching 100%.31 Accordingly, the limiting mechanism in such devices is their limited absorption. Thicker devices, which might maximize the number of absorbed photons, might suffer from predominant recombination due to the limited carrier mobility or because of non-optimum nanomorphology. We notice that our devices (∼350 nm) are significantly thicker compared to the typical thickness in both organic (∼100 nm) and hybrid solar cells (∼150 nm),32 which allows for a larger absorption of incoming photons. Despite this large thickness, we do not observe significant large-scale phase segregation, followed by respectable EQE levels of ca. 50% in the UV-VIS wavelengths and 30% in the NIR (at 700 nm).
Experimental
ITO-coated glass substrates (100 nm Universität Stuttgart, Institut für Großflächige Mikroelektronik) were first washed in acetone for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes bath in ethanol, both under strong sonication. The substrates were then rinsed with abundant DI water and dried with nitrogen. Bismuth sulfide nanocrystals were synthesized following a previously reported method.15 Briefly, 5.4 mmol of Bi(OAc)3, 34 mmol of oleic acid (OA) and 34 mmol of 1-octadecene (ODE) were pumped overnight at 100 °C. After this time, the reaction temperature was raised to 170 °C. When the reaction flask reaches this temperature, 1.2 mmol of HMS (hexamethyldisilathiane) mixed with 10 mL of ODE were quickly injected into the flask and the heating temperature was lowered to 100 °C. After 2 h at 100 °C the reaction was quenched by removing the heating mantle and adding 20 mL of cold toluene and 40 mL of cold methanol. The oleate-capped Bi2S3 nanocrystals were isolated after centrifugation. Purification of the nanocrystals was performed by successive dispersion/precipitation in toluene/MeOH. Details of the fabrication of the Bi2S3 LBL are given elsewhere.15 Briefly, one drop of Bi2S3 solution in toluene at 20 mg mL−1 was dispensed onto a substrate while spinning (2000 rpm). Then, six drops of 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) (2 vol%) in acetonitrile (ACN) were applied to the film and left reacting for 20 seconds. Finally the films were rinsed with a flush of ACN and toluene. This process was repeated 3 times to obtain a 60 nm thick film. The ZnO ETL layer was grown using a sol–gel method to obtain a thickness of approximately 50 nm.33 Briefly, 0.5 g of zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 5 mL of methoxyethanol and 0.142 mL of ethanolamine. The solution was spin-cast onto the ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm and cured at 200 °C for 30 minutes. This process was repeated twice to get a uniform coverage of the ITO. Bi2S3 NCs and P3HT (molecular weight Mw = 22000) were mixed in solution at a concentration of 50 g L−1 from individual chloroform solutions and spin-cast at 3000 rpm. The optimized proportion of NCs to polymer was 70 wt% (Fig. S4, ESI†). The ligand exchange was achieved by immersing the substrates into a bath of EDT (1 vol%) in ACN for 10 minutes. The substrates were then rinsed in a one-to-one mixture of ACN and ethyl acetate, dried under nitrogen and annealed in air at 110 °C for 7 minutes. On some samples, a second layer of Bi2S3:P3HT was spin-cast while spinning the substrate, followed by additional 10 minute EDT 1% in the ACN bath, rinsing in a 1:1 mixture of ACN and ethyl acetate and 110 °C annealing steps (7 minutes). In order to preserve the annealed underlying film, the second active layer was dispensed from a chloroform solution onto a spinning substrate. Next, a drop of P3HT solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at a concentration of 50 g L−1 was deposited onto the spinning (3000 rpm) substrate as the HTL, followed by a last annealing step at 110 °C for 7 minutes. Finally, the MoO3 (15 nm) and Ag (150 nm) electrodes were thermally evaporated in a Kurt J. Lesker Nano36 system.
Current–voltage characteristics were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source measuring unit under dark and simulated AM1.5 solar conditions (Newport Oriel Sol3A). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained using a Newport Cornerstone 260 monochromator and a Keithley 2400 source measuring unit providing short-circuit conditions.
Internal quantum efficiency was calculated from the sample absorption and the calculated EQE. The sample absorption was obtained from transmission and reflection measurements made using an Agilent Technologies Cary 600 FTIR spectrometer attached to a microscope with a 15× objective.
Measurements of short-circuit current density dependence on incident power density were made using a Keithley 2400 source measuring unit via amplitude modulation of a Newport LQA635-08C 635 nm laser, using an Agilent 33220A waveform generator.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that hybrid bulk heterojunctions using Bi2S3 NCs and P3HT can provide power conversion efficiencies of the order of 1%, overcoming the dissimilar charge transport via distribution of the dissociating interface throughout the active layer. EQE levels of ∼50% in the visible together with NIR sensitization, reaching as high as ∼30% at 700 nm can be achieved following a general ligand exchange method that does not require solubility of the exchanged particles. Infrared sensitization levels of 30% are, to the best of the authors' knowledge, among the highest ever reported with P3HT. We have moreover demonstrated charge injection from Bi2S3 into ZnO, which allows for a more efficient harnessing of the UV-VIS wavelengths and paves the way for using Bi2S3 NCs in new device architectures. Employment of Bi2S3 NCs together with the novel low bandgap polymers may provide a new route towards high efficiency hybrid solar cells. Further gains can be expected upon improving the electron mobility in the Bi2S3 NC network and further elucidation of the effect of surface trap states on the maximum attainable Voc in these hybrid cells.

 	Fig. 1  Bulk heterojunction concept. (a) Schematic image of the device structure with ITO/ETL/BHJ/HTL/MoO3/Ag, where BHJ is the mixed bulk heterojunction structure of P3HT and Bi2S3 NCs. (b) Cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph of a bulk heterojunction device with 70 wt% Bi2S3 loading, revealing Bi2S3 agglomerates in the nanomorphology of the films.	 

 	Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of the oleic acid capped Bi2S3 NCs (solid line), P3HT (dashed line) and BHJ before (dash-dotted line) and after (dotted line) the ligand exchange in the region between 1700 and 1200 cm−1. The disappearance of the band at ∼1400 cm−1 after the ligand exchange process is attributed to the removal of the original oleate capping ligands and their replacement by the shorter EDT molecules. The line at 1400 cm−1 is provided as a guide to the eye.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photovoltaic performance of the BHJ devices. (a) Current–voltage characteristics of the devices with ZnO (line with diamonds) and Bi2S3 (line with circles) as the ETL. A control bilayer device (solid line) is provided for comparison. (b) External quantum efficiency of a bilayer (solid line) and BHJ devices employing ZnO (line with diamonds) and Bi2S3 (line with circles) as ETLs. EQE extends to 950 nm, far beyond the bandgap of P3HT, where only contribution from the Bi2S3 is possible. (c) Internal quantum efficiency (solid line) and absorption (line with circles) spectra of a BHJ device employing ZnO as ETL.	 

Bi2S3–P3HT bilayer	
	120	0.30	3.8	0.49	0.5
Bi2S3 ETL–BHJ no ligand exchange	2	350	0.34	0.6	0.48	0.1
Bi2S3 ETL–BHJ with ligand exchange	2	350	0.28	8.0	0.40	0.9
ZnO ETL–BHJ with ligand exchange	2	350	0.30	9.2	0.36	1.0
ZnO ETL–BHJ with ligand exchange	1	150	0.34	6.6	0.32	0.7

 	Fig. 4  Intensity dependent short-circuit current density under 635 nm laser illumination for bilayer (circles) and bulk heterojunction (diamonds) devices. Solid lines correspond to the best fittings of the data with a power-law dependence. The almost unity exponent for a BHJ device is indicative of a generation-limited device, while bilayer devices are space charge limited.
