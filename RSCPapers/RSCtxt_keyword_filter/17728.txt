    , Accepted 4th August 2020First published on 6th August 2020AbstractIn recent years, the huge consumption of energy and the increasing environmental awareness have triggered the need for new types of devices for the collection and storage of green and renewable energy. Owing to the natural abundance, low cost and renewability, biomass-waste-derived energy storage materials offer a great opportunity to address both energy and environmental issues. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an effective approach to fabricate a high-performance rechargeable Zn–MnO2 battery directly from biomass garbage (reed straw) floating on the ocean. The obtained three-dimensional (3D) electrodes exhibit a honeycomb-like cellular structure with multi-level open channels. This unique architecture not only enables a high mass loading of MnO2 (51.0 mg cm−3), but also provides low-resistance pathways favorable for electrolyte diffusion and ion transport. The resulting battery achieves a remarkable capacity (369.73 mA h g−1 at a low MnO2 loading of 4.9 mg cm−3 and 306.7 mA h g−1 at a MnO2 loading of 51.0 mg cm−3), good rate capability and outstanding cycling stability (retention of 95.2% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles), which are superior to those of most batteries of this type. When using a gel as the electrolyte, the as-fabricated quasi-solid-state battery possesses an admirable energy density of 20.5 mW h cm−3 (420.1 W h kg−1, based on the mass of MnO2, or 131.5 W h kg−1 based on the total mass of the battery). Impressively, the battery can be safely used in a wide temperature range (−20 to 100 °C) and under a variety of extreme conditions, such as puncturing, bending, hammering, cutting and cropping. This battery is further integrated with a flexible solar cell for a self-sustaining power bar, which is capable of harvesting green and sustainable energy from the surrounding environment and successfully powers wearable electronics. Unlike most of the previous reports on zinc ion batteries, which attempted to improve the electrochemical properties by using more effective active materials, the present study achieves outstanding performance mainly due to the unique structures of the electrodes derived from the biomass waste. Obviously, this method appears to be much simpler and lower in cost, thus having high potential for scale-up manufacturing.
Introduction
The fast advancement in portable and wearable electronics has aroused growing demand for energy storage devices not only with high electrochemical performance but also having extra appealing characteristics, such as high safety, low cost, environmental friendliness, and so on.1–3 Supercapacitors are a kind of energy storage device demonstrating distinct advantages of simplicity in fabrication and high power density.4,5 However, the insufficient energy density has indeed hampered their application. In contrast, lithium-ion batteries possess a much higher energy density, but suffer considerably from cost and safety issues especially under some extreme conditions.6–8 Recently, rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries have attracted significant research interest due to their unique features, including high safety, light weight, nontoxicity and ease of fabrication.9–11 Solid-state rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries coupled with hydrogel electrolytes show excellent cycling stability, making them a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries.12–15 Nevertheless, most electrodes for rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries are made from synthetic and expensive materials like graphene, carbon nanotubes, acetylene black, etc., which encounter obstacles, such as complex synthesis process, low yield, insufficient capacity, and environmental incompatibility.9–15 It is also important to note that most of the recent studies on rechargeable Zn–MnO2 batteries were focused on the optimization of electrochemically active substances, but ignored the structural design of the bulk electrode materials.9–15 As is well recognized, the hierarchical microstructure of electrodes may affect their electrochemical properties profoundly, in particular when the electrode is thick or the load of active substances is high.16,17
Given its natural abundance, low cost, renewability, and biodegradability, biomass has been increasingly utilized as a substitute for traditional materials for energy storage devices.18–20 During the past few years, a number of biomass-derived nanomaterials have been developed as promising candidates for energy storage.21–24 For example, Du et al. fabricated a free-standing laminar anode for lithium ion batteries using cellulose nanofibers.21 Zhang et al. prepared nanofibrous N-doped carbon microspheres from chitin for high rate supercapacitors.22 Despite these successful attempts, the purification of bio-precursors as well as their nanonization processing are time-consuming and energy-intensive, while the yield is often low.25,26 Compared with these bottom-up approaches, direct engineering of naturally occurring species appears to be more effective. Such approaches are not only simple and scalable, but can also make use of the natural porous and hierarchical microstructures inside the natural species, which are favorable for high-performance electronic devices.25,26
Every year, nature generates a huge amount of biomass waste.27 Although most of it is biodegraded into the biological cycle system, there is still some remaining biomass like leaves and straw stalks that scatter on streets or float on the surface of water bodies. This has raised considerable concern over the environment, leading to a high cost for collecting and properly disposing this biomass garbage.27–29 Consequently, the conversion of biomass waste into high-value-added products has become a hot research topic as it offers innovative solutions for waste management with significant environmental benefits.
Herein, we report a high-performance rechargeable Zn–MnO2 battery derived from reed straw, typical biomass garbage floating on the ocean. Reed straw is mostly found in wetlands but is distributed worldwide.30 It has a unique nature-designed open porous structure. Under high-temperature carbonization, it can be converted into 3D carbon materials with hierarchical pore structures facilitating electrolyte diffusion and ion transportation in energy storage devices.31,32Fig. 1 schematically shows the preparation process of 3D electrodes from reed straw and the full cell architecture. The honeycomb-like cellular structure with multi-level open channels inside the carbonized reed straw also assists the uniform growth of MnO2 and Zn nanosheets along the channels. As a result, the Zn–MnO2 battery exhibits a high capacity of 306.7 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of MnO2), good rate capability, and an excellent capacity retention of 95.2% after 3000 cycles. More interestingly, when assembled with a gel electrolyte, the quasi-solid-state battery displays superb safety in a wide temperature range and even under a variety of extreme conditions, such as puncturing, bending, hammering, cutting and cropping. Last but not least, the quasi-solid-state battery is combined with a flexible solar cell to form a self-sustaining power bar. It can harvest and store clean and sustainable energy from the surrounding environment and power a watch or a badge continuously, demonstrating great potential for real-world application in wearable and portable electronic devices.

Results and discussion
We first characterized the morphology and structure of the electrode materials. As shown in Fig. 1a, the ocean garbage (OG) of reed straw has a honeycomb-like cellular structure, with lots of regular channels mainly distributed between 200 and 1000 μm size. After carbonization, the honeycomb-like structure is well preserved, but the channel size is reduced to 200–500 μm (Fig. S1†). Fig. 2a shows the top-view SEM images of carbonized ocean garbage (COG), where the big channels are surrounded by numerous small ones (2–5 μm). From the cross-sectional view, almost all the open channels are aligned straight through from top to bottom (Fig. S2a†). Under a higher magnification, it is interesting to notice that the inner wall of the channel is not smooth, but has many convex folds presumably formed from plant cells during drying (Fig. S2b†). This 3D hierarchical biochar scaffold with multi-level straight channels was subjected to further functionalization.

(g) XRD spectra and (h) XPS spectra of the raw COG and COG@MnO2 electrode. (i) High-resolution Mn 2p XPS spectrum of the COG@MnO2 electrode. 
For the fabrication of COG@Zn, a typical electrodeposition method was applied. The Zn nanosheets can be in situ grown both on the surface of COG and inside its multi-level channels. As shown in Fig. 2b, the freestanding Zn nanosheets (∼60 nm in thickness) are uniformly and perpendicularly attached to COG, forming an array structure. TEM observation further confirms the in situ growth of Zn nanosheets through electrodeposition (Fig. 2c). In addition, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2c indicates that the Zn nanosheets are highly crystalline with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.24 nm, in agreement with the (002) plane of hexagonal zinc.12 Furthermore, the crystal structures of the electrode materials are further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S3,† the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to hexagonal zinc (JCPDS 87-0713).12Fig. 2d and S4† show the top and cross-sectional view SEM images of the COG@MnO2, respectively. It is observed that MnO2 nanosheets are also uniformly distributed over the entire COG@MnO2. Besides, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of C, O and Mn agree well with their homogeneous distribution in COG@MnO2 (Fig. 2e and S5†). Fig. 2f shows the representative TEM/HRTEM images of the deposited MnO2, which also display a nanosheet-like morphology. And the lattice spacing of 0.24 nm corresponds to the (211) plane of α-MnO2.33 As shown in Fig. 2g, compared with COG, there are several new peaks in the XRD spectrum of COG@MnO2. These peaks match well with the reference data for MnO2 (JCPDS 44-0141), suggesting the formation of tetragonal phase α-MnO2.5 In order to analyze the chemical compositions and the valence states, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted. Compared with the pristine COG sample, COG@MnO2 exhibits several new signals corresponding to Mn element (Fig. 2h). As shown in Fig. 2i, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Mn 2p displays two peaks at 654.5 and 642.8 eV, corresponding to the binding energy of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively.8 The results indicate that the Mn oxidation state in COG@MnO2 is Mn4+ (MnO2).34
The wettability of electrodes is well known as an important characteristic governing the interaction between the electrolyte and electrode as well as the charge transfer at the interface.35 As shown in Fig. S6,† the water contact angle (WCA) of COG is measured to be 0°, and the total spreading and penetration time (TSPT) of a water drop is about 3.17 s, indicating the inherent hydrophilicity of the COG. This should be attributed to the presence of some heteroatoms in natural reed straw, leading to heteroatom doping during the carbonization process and hence improved hydrophilicity of carbon materials.29 In contrast, the TSPT of COG@Zn, porous COG@MnO2 and bulk COG@MnO2 is reduced to 0.92 s, 0.42 s and 0.54 s, respectively. The results indicate that the surface wettability of the electrodes has been enhanced from hydrophilic to super-hydrophilic with the incorporation of MnO2 and Zn nanosheets. As is well known, MnO2 and Zn are inherently hydrophilic. In this case, the nanosheet structure increases the roughness of the material's surface, thereby further improving the hydrophilicity of the material. This favors the accessibility of the electrolyte at the surface of the electrodes and the charge transfer between them, giving rise to enhanced electrochemical performance.
As schematically shown in Fig. 3a, the presence of multi-level open channels inside the 3D porous electrode provides favorable low-resistance pathways for electrolyte diffusion and ion transfer. In contrast, only a few irregular holes are available in the common bulk electrodes that have been usually subjected to grinding and coating (Fig. S7†). And this kind of densely packed structure will inevitably raise the resistance to ion transfer inside the electrode (Fig. 3b). To verify the above conjectures, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3c and S8,† both Nyquist plots display a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The equivalent circuit diagram used for fitting the Nyquist plots (inset of Fig. S8†) consists of the series resistance of the electrode (Rs), the charge transfer resistance (Rct), and the resistance related to the ion diffusion (Zw).36,37 The series resistance of the 3D porous electrode is about 52.1 Ω (Rs = 15.5 Ω; Rct = 36.6 Ω), which is slightly higher than that of the bulk electrode (40.5 Ω, Rs = 17.4 Ω; Rct = 23.1 Ω). Importantly, the linear slope of the plot for the 3D porous electrode is distinctly larger than that for the bulk electrode, indicating a much lower ion diffusion resistance in the 3D porous electrode.36,37

In order to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the obtained electrodes, two-electrode Zn–MnO2 batteries were assembled using COG@MnO2 as the cathode and COG@Zn as the anode in an aqueous electrolyte containing 2 M ZnSO4 and 0.1 M MnSO4. The typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the aqueous COG@MnO2//COG@Zn battery at different scan rates are shown in Fig. 3d. There are two reduction peaks at around 1.2 and 1.4 V, which should be ascribed to the zinc insertion into MnO2 and the subsequent reduction of Mn(IV) to the Mn(III)/Mn(II) states.8 Similarly, the oxidation peak and shoulder appear at 1.6–1.8 V, corresponding to Zn-extraction from the MnO2 cathode as the Mn(III)/Mn(II) states undergo oxidation to the Mn(IV) state.8 The overall reaction of the battery can be formulated as follows:10  
With the scan rate increasing from 0.1 to 1 mV s−1, there are no significant differences in the shape of the curves except for a slight displacement of the redox peaks, probably due to the gradual decline of the zinc insertion reaction at high scan rates.12
Firstly, the effect of the KMnO4 concentration on the MnO2 loading and the capacity of the battery was studied. As shown in Fig. 3e, the loading of MnO2 on the electrode gradually increases with the increase of KMnO4 concentration. When the concentration of KMnO4 is 0.1 mM, a low MnO2 loading of 4.9 mg cm−3 (weight percentage of 21.1%) is obtained. And the capacity of the corresponding battery can be as high as 369.7 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of the active material of MnO2), superior to that of most of the earlier reported Zn–MnO2 batteries and aqueous zinc batteries (see Table S1†), such as Zn–MnO2 batteries (225 mA h g−1),3 Zn–ZnMn2O4 batteries (150 mA h g−1),38 Zn–PTO batteries (336 mA h g−1),39 Zn–NiCo2O4 batteries (183.1 mA h g−1),40 Zn–MoS2 batteries (202.6 mA h g−1),41 Ni–Zn batteries (265 mA h g−1),42 and Zn–V2O5@PEDOT batteries (360 mA h g−1).43 When the concentration of KMnO4 increases to 10 mM, the mass loading of MnO2 reaches 51.0 mg cm−3 (weight percentage of 79.1%), and the corresponding capacity remains at 306.7 mA h g−1. Meanwhile, the volumetric capacity of the battery increases accordingly at the beginning, and reaches its highest value (15.6 mA h cm−3) when the concentration of KMnO4 is about 10 mM, which is chosen as the optimal concentration for the preparation of cathode materials. Notably, a high loading of MnO2 seems to have a negligible effect on the ion diffusion as elucidated from the Nyquist plots in Fig. S9.† The linear slopes for the two electrodes are nearly the same, indicative of their similar ion diffusion resistance. High mass loading and high volumetric capacity are desirable in energy storage devices because of the advantages in maximizing the packing density of the electrode materials while lowering the manufacturing cost by reducing the number of inactive material layers.

Fig. 3f presents the charge/discharge curves of the aqueous battery at various current densities. All the curves have a prolonged discharge voltage platform situated at about 1.2–1.4 V, which is consistent with the CV curves. Encouragingly, the battery with 3D porous electrodes yields a high discharge capacity of 306.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.3 A g−1, which is higher than that for the battery with bulk electrodes (272.1 mA h g−1, Fig. S10†). Furthermore, when the current density is increased to 3 A g−1, the battery with 3D porous electrodes can still retain 56.7% of the initial discharge capacity (173.8 mA h g−1), which is considerably superior to that of the battery with bulk electrodes (35.8%, Fig. S10†). The results indicate that the 3D porous electrode has excellent rate capability and ultrafast charge–discharge ability. In addition, the rate performance of the battery with 3D porous electrodes was further analyzed at various current densities ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 A g−1 by cycling 5 times at each rate. As shown in Fig. 3g, the battery exhibits high average discharge capacities of 307.4, 280.5, 263.9, 244.7, 215.9, 191.8 and 173.2 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0 A g−1, respectively. When the current is reset back to 0.3 A g−1, an average discharge capacity of 302.5 mA h g−1 is recovered, which is equivalent to 98.4% of the initial average capacity. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of the battery is higher than 92.8% during the rate cycling process.
Furthermore, the long-term cycling performance of the battery was studied via a continuous charge–discharge experiment at a current density of 1.8 A g−1 (Fig. 3h). Impressively, the battery exhibits a high capacity retention of 95.2% even after 3000 cycles, better than those of other Zn–MnO2 batteries.2–8 The hierarchical porous structures with open and straight channels inside the electrode of this study facilitate the electrolyte diffusion and the ion transport. Consequently, the possible decay of the electrode's internal structure during the fast charge/discharge process can be largely impeded, leading to improved cycling stability of the battery.8,18 These results consistently imply that the present battery is very promising as a high-performance, long-life, environmentally friendly and cost-effective energy storage device.
The as-fabricated Zn–MnO2 battery from biomass waste in this study achieves both high mass loading of MnO2 and high capacity, which should be attributed to the following facts: (1) the honeycomb-like cellular structure with multi-level open channels not only offers paths for effective ion transport/diffusion, but also allows more electroactive sites to be exposed to the electrolyte. (2) The MnO2 and Zn nanosheets are in situ grown on COG, providing effective electron transport between COG and the active substances. (3) The superhydrophilic character of the electrode materials promotes ion transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode material. (4) The COG@MnO2 and COG@Zn are used as free-standing electrodes without any binders or additional conductive materials, which eliminates undesired contact resistance and extra weight.
Moreover, a quasi-solid-state COG@MnO2//COG@Zn battery was assembled using PVA/LiCl–ZnCl2–MnSO4 gel as the electrolyte. Fig. S11† presents the CV curve of the quasi-solid-state battery at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, where a pair of prominent symmetrical redox peaks are found at ∼1.6 and ∼1.4 V, respectively, corresponding to the charge–discharge curves in Fig. 4a. As calculated from the discharge curves, the quasi-solid-state battery reaches a high specific capacity of 14.5 mA h cm−3 at a low current density of 15 mA cm−3. And it can maintain a high value of 7.2 mA h cm−3 when the current density is gradually increased to 150 mA cm−3 with a capacity retention of 49.7% (Fig. S12†). The energy and power densities of the present quasi-solid-state battery are compared with those of other energy storage devices, and the corresponding Ragone plots are given in Fig. 4b and c. The as-fabricated quasi-solid-state battery demonstrates a maximum volumetric energy density of 20.5 mW h cm−3 (420.1 W h kg−1, based on the mass of the active material of MnO2) at a power density of 21.1 mW cm−3 (432.4 W kg−1), and retains 9.9 mW h cm−3 (202.9 W h kg−1) when the power density increases to 205.4 mW cm−3 (4190.6 W kg−1). Its energy density outperforms that of many recently reported energy storage devices (Fig. 4b and Table S2†),44–52 such as manganese-based supercapacitors (0.89 mW h cm−3),44 alkali-ion batteries (1.3 mW h cm−3),47 Zn–Ni batteries (4.05 mW h cm−3),48 Zn–NiCo batteries (8 mW h cm−3),50 Na-ion batteries (11.2 mW h cm−3),51 and Zn–MnO2 batteries (17.4 mW h cm−3),52 as well as commercial batteries (0.3–10 mW h cm−3).12 Taking the total mass of a full battery into consideration, the present quasi-solid-state Zn–MnO2 battery gives rise to a gravimetric energy density of 131.5 W h kg−1, which is much higher than that of most biomass-derived energy storage devices reported so far (Fig. 4c and Table S3†),53–59 including a variety of supercapacitors (5.8–64 W h kg−1),53–58 Li-ion batteries (100 W h kg−1)59 and Zn-ion batteries (117.5 W h kg−1).60 In addition, the cycling test of the quasi-solid-state battery was carried out to evaluate its long-term cycling stability. As shown in Fig. S13,† the battery exhibits a high capacity retention of 94.3% even after 1000 cycles at a current density of 90 mA cm−3.

Current batteries (especially lithium batteries) have been suffering from a bottleneck in safety issues. For example, these batteries are prone to arouse fires or explosions at extreme temperatures or under external forces, giving rise to significant risks in people's daily lives. Fortunately, the quasi-solid-state COG@MnO2//COG@Zn battery developed in this study exhibits fascinating performance in terms of safety. Firstly, we examined its charge–discharge performance at 60 mA cm−3 in a wide temperature range, and the results are shown in Fig. 4d. At room temperature (25 °C), the battery displays a capacity of 10.3 mA h cm−3. When the temperature is decreased to −20 °C, the capacity of the battery decreases to 6.9 mA h cm−3. Moreover, when the temperature is raised up to 100 °C, the battery can still work normally with a capacity of 13.5 mA h cm−3. Overall, the capacity of the battery increases gradually and reaches the peak at 80 °C as the temperature increases from −20 to 100 °C (Fig. 4e). These results indicate that the ion transport through the gel electrolyte is influenced remarkably by the temperature, and the battery can be safely operated in a wide temperature range. Moreover, to evaluate its safety under a variety of extreme conditions, a series of destructive tests were performed on the quasi-solid-state battery. Surprisingly, the battery is still able to power an electronic temperature humidity meter normally even after being damaged under a variety of extreme conditions, such as puncturing, bending, hammering, cutting and cropping (Fig. 4f and Movies S1–S6†), suggesting its superb safety in daily use.
Solar energy is regarded as one of the cleanest sources of energy in the world, but its application is largely limited by the access to sunlight due to the intermittent and unpredictable nature of sunlight.61,62 Combining solar cells with energy storage devices provides a feasible solution to address the imposed restrictions of sunlight availability.61,62 To the best of our knowledge, this study makes the first attempt to integrate three quasi-solid-state batteries connected in series with a flexible solar cell to form a self-sustaining power bar (Fig. 5a). The bar is capable of automatically harvesting and storing clean and sustainable energy from the surrounding environment. Notably, the flexible solar cell made from amorphous silicon (a-Si) can be applied under various weather conditions as it can effectively harvest energy from both sunlight and weak room light.63 Prior to bar integration, the performance of an individual solar cell under different lights was tested, and the typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 5b. Under Air Mass (AM) 1.5, the flexible solar cell with a device area of around 28 cm2 can generate a short-circuit photocurrent (Isc) of 28.79 mA and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 6.28 V, with a power-conversion efficiency of 3.20%, while under the low intensity room light (around 14.5 W m−2), the Isc and Voc are 1.02 mA and 5.31 V, respectively, with a power-conversion efficiency of 8.55%.

As schematically illustrated in Fig. 5c, after the collection and storage of energy from the surrounding environment, the bar was used to power a watch (having two LED bulbs, Fig. S14a†) or a badge (having one LED bulb, Fig. S14b†). This integrated self-powered system can be charged up to 5.66 V within 2 h under outdoor sunlight (approximately 1.5 AM), and can power the watch and the badge for 2 and 4 h, respectively (Fig. 5d). Under the relatively low intensity of room light (around 14.5 W m−2), it takes almost 4 h to charge the self-powered system to 4.62 V. And the stored energy can power the watch and the badge for 1.2 and 2.4 h, respectively (Fig. 5e). Fig. 5f and g, and Movies S7 and S8† show the watch and the badge being powered by the self-sustaining power bar. The above results indicate that the power bar can be self-powered by both indoor and outdoor lights, showing great promise for future wearable and portable electronics.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an effective approach to fabricate a high-performance rechargeable Zn–MnO2 battery from the biomass garbage of reed straw floating on the ocean. The obtained 3D porous electrodes possess a multi-level open channel structure, which favors electrolyte diffusion and ion transfer. Based on these electrodes, the prepared aqueous Zn–MnO2 battery exhibits a high capacity (369.73 mA h g−1 at a low MnO2 loading of 4.9 mg cm−3 and 306.7 mA h g−1 at a MnO2 loading of 51 mg cm−3), good rate capability (retention of 56.7% of the initial capacity when the current density is increased 10 times) and outstanding cycling stability (retention of 95.2% of the initial capacity after 3000 cycles). Significantly, when using a gel as the electrolyte, the as-fabricated quasi-solid-state battery possesses a high energy density of 20.5 mW h cm−3 (420.1 W h kg−1, based on the mass of MnO2, or 131.5 W h kg−1 based on the total mass of the battery), superior to those of most of the state-of-the-art batteries of this type. Meanwhile, it can maintain superior safety in a wide temperature range as well as under various extreme conditions. Furthermore, a self-sustaining power bar, which integrated three quasi-solid-state batteries with a flexible solar cell, is capable of harvesting clean and sustainable energy from the surrounding environment and continuously powering a watch or a badge. It is envisaged that this novel Zn–MnO2 battery from low-cost biomass waste may serve as a promising energy storage device for wearable and portable electronics.
