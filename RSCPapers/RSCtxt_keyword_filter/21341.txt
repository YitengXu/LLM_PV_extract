N-Heteroacene materials offer great promise for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) because of their broad and tunable light absorption and excellent charge mobility. However, few attempts have been made to apply them in OSCs. Here, we first report the synthesis of all-thiophene-substituted N-heteroacenes, B2AT and B2A2T. These small molecules possess good physical and electrical performances, such as high solubility and thermal stability, relatively favorable optical and hole transport properties for OSCs, and low-lying HOMO levels, which make them potential candidates for application in OSCs as electron-donor materials. The bulk heterojunction solar cell with a thin film of B2AT or B2A2T:PC71BM exhibits a high open-circuit voltage of 1.02 and 1.00 V, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 4.82% and 5.39%, respectively, which is the best performance achieved to date for N-heteroacene based OSCs. This clearly demonstrates the potential of N-heteroacenes for efficient photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) in which a blend of a conjugated polymer/small-molecule donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor serves as the active layer have attracted much attention for the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy due to their low-cost processing, large-area fabrication, light-weight and high-flexibility.1–3 Within a decade, much effort has been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ OSCs, in order to take them from theoretical research to commercial applications.4–7 In the past few years, there is a dramatic improvement in organic photovoltaic device performance by the development of new donor materials.8–13
Among all donor materials, small molecules offer several advantages over polymers owing to their well-defined molecular structure, tunable bandgap, and available structure–property relationship,14–19 which guarantee the feasibility to gain high-performance OSCs through rational molecular design strategies. Hence, considerable research effort has been focused on developing efficient small-molecule materials for improved photovoltaic performance of the device. To date, the PCEs of BHJ OSCs based on small molecules as electron-donors have surpassed 9%.20,21 However, these results are still far from meeting the requirements for the commercialization of OSCs. There is still a long way to go for to develop ultimate organic materials with better photovoltaic properties.
Recently, N-heteroacenes have been seen as a potential strong competitor for organic solar-cell materials due to their high charge mobility, broad light absorption and good stability.22–24 Although many syntheses and theoretical calculations on N-heteroacenes have been conducted,25 there are still few reports about their successful use in OSCs,26,27 which is mainly caused by their structural features.28,29 For example, N-heteroacenes have a strong tendency to close packing owing to their planar structure, which is detrimental to solar cells, because aggregates in thin films can trap excitons and hinder their dissociation.30 Therefore, to make use of N-heteroacenes for highly efficient OSCs, there is an urgent need for new molecular design strategies to tailor their chemical structure so as to further modify their optical absorption, energy level, bandgap and solid aggregation while maintaining their high charge transport properties. As suggested by the success of all-thiophene-substituted small molecules, as stable and solution-processable electron-donors with good photoelectric properties, suitable aggregation parameters and high photovoltaic performances,31,32 substituting N-heteroacenes with thiophene units could be a promising strategy to develop new efficient donors.
Here we report the synthesis of novel all-thiophene-substituted N-heteroacene electron-donor materials (Scheme 1). This system has been designed to (1) take advantage of the high hole-transport properties of the N-heteroacene unit,22–24 (2) extend the absorption spectrum of the donor by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the thiophene substituents to the N-heteroacene unit, (3) tune the donor's aggregation behavior by using the thiophene substituents,33,34 and (4) confer a deep HOMO energy level on the donor and thus preserve a high open circuit voltage for the resulting device.35–37

The physical and electrical properties of the new materials have been studied by using solubility experiments, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Their hole mobility has been measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Moreover, their aggregation tendency has also been discussed. Finally, their photoelectrical conversion properties have been researched by using prototype BHJ solar cells with PC71BM as the acceptor.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, the synthesis of the N-heteroacene molecules B2AT and B2A2T was accomplished by the cyclocondensation reaction of 3,6-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzene-1,2,4,5-tetraamine (1) with 2,7-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione (3) and 3,6-bis(5′-octyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzene-1,2,4,5-tetraamine (2) with 7-bis(5′-octyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione (4), respectively. Their structures have been characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS). Further details of the synthesis and characterization of B2AT and B2A2T can be found in the ESI.† The novel materials show excellent solubility in organic solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene, which could be ascribed to the presence of the long alkyl chains. This is a prerequisite for solution-processed OSCs. The thermal stability of B2AT and B2A2T was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), showing a good thermostability with 5% weight loss at 418 and 401 °C, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). Furthermore, their thermal properties were also studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), both of them show typical thermal behavior for amorphous materials. They exhibit only glass transition points with no melting peaks and, hence, no crystallinity is observed.
Calculation
The geometries and electronic properties (electron density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels) of B2AT and B2A2T were obtained by simulation using density functional theory (DFT), as shown in Fig. 1. The N-heteroacene backbone of the molecules exhibits a nearly coplanar conformation. The core-substituted and end-substituted thiophene groups of B2AT have distortions of about 86.5° and 46.8° out of coplanarity, respectively, which are a little smaller than those of B2A2T (87.1° and 51.2°, respectively). Furthermore, the dihedral angles between thiophene and thiophene of the bithiophene units which substitute at the core and end of B2A2T are both greater than 84°. These results indicate that the planarity of the molecules gradually decreases with the introduction and extension of the thiophene chains, which would gradually weaken their intermolecular packing.38

The electron density distributions of the LUMO levels of B2AT and B2A2T are both located in the N-heteroacene backbone. However, their electron density distributions of HOMO levels are mainly centered on the thiophene units. This implies that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the thiophene moiety to the N-heteroacene moiety can occur in B2AT and B2A2T when excited by light energy.
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of B2AT and B2A2T in dichloromethane solution and thin films are plotted in Fig. 2. The corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 1. These compounds exhibit two typical absorption bands in the 350–650 nm region. The absorption band in the lower wavelength region could be assigned to the π–π* transition. The absorption in the low energy region originates from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the donor and acceptor units. In dichloromethane, the absorption maximum (λmax) of B2AT and B2A2T is at 516 and 535 nm, respectively, indicating that the prolongation of the thiophene chains could facilitate the ICT in this system. When cast as a thin film, the spectrum of B2AT exhibits a red shift λmax of 23 nm compared to that in solution, suggesting the existence of intermolecular packing in the solid state, which is significantly weaker than its non-thiophene-substituted analogues.39 This is mainly caused by the thiophene units which reduced the planarity of the N-heteroacenes, as confirmed by the results of simulation. For B2A2T, the corresponding red shift is 15 nm. This value is 8 nm less than that of B2AT, which could be attributed to the weaker intermolecular stacking in the film of B2A2T,40,41 which agrees with the results of DFT calculations. According to the above results, the intermolecular packing of the N-heteroacenes is significantly reduced with the introduction of the thiophene units, and their aggregation behavior could be further optimized by the regulation and control of the thiophene substituents.

Cyclic voltammograms
The redox properties of the materials were measured in acetonitrile/Bu4NPF6 solutions, and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The electrochemical band gaps of B2AT and B2A2T are 1.88 and 1.83 eV, respectively, which agree well with their optical band gaps (Table 1). The HOMO and LUMO of B2AT are −5.41 and −3.53 eV, respectively. The LUMO almost remains the same when the thiophene substituents are extended, while the HOMO increases to −5.37 eV because of the more localized HOMO electron density distribution, as shown in Fig. 1. The low-lying HOMO energy levels of B2AT and B2A2T provide the possibility to gain a large Voc in the photovoltaic devices.35–37 In addition, the LUMO energy levels of B2AT and B2A2T are sufficiently higher than that of PC71BM (−4.0 eV) and favorable for the photo-induced charge transfer between the small molecules and PC71BM.42
Hole mobility
Hole mobility is another important parameter of donors for their photovoltaic applications.43,44 The hole mobility of B2AT and B2A2T was investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/B2AT or B2A2T/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). For the hole-only device, SCLC is expressed as follows: (1)where JSCLC stands for current density, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V = Vappl − Vbi, Vbi is the built-in potential. The results are plotted as ln(Jd/V2) versus (V/d) and the hole mobilities are evaluated to be 7.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for B2AT and B2A2T, respectively, which are useful for their application in OSCs.41,43,44 The relatively favorable hole mobility for organic photovoltaics could be attributed to the excellent charge transport properties of the N-heteroacene unit. In addition, the more planar structure of B2AT (Fig. 1) results in more efficient intermolecular π–π packing reactions, which lead to its higher hole mobility.
Photovoltaic properties
We have explored the photovoltaic properties of the organic solar cells based on the two small molecules as electron donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor by fabricating BHJ devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/B2AT or B2A2T:PC71BM (1:3, w/w, 90 nm)/Ca (15 nm)/Al (100 nm). Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the resulting devices under stimulated AM 1.5 radiation (100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 2.

The devices based on B2AT and B2A2T processed from chlorobenzene show a PCE of 4.82% (Jsc = 8.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 V and FF = 0.56) and 5.39% (Jsc = 10.17 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.00 V and FF = 0.53), respectively, representing the highest reported PCEs for N-heteroacene based OSCs. The large Voc of the devices could be attributed to the low-lying HOMO energy levels of B2AT and B2A2T because the Voc for the BHJ solar cell is the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO level of PC71BM.43,44 The relatively higher FF of the B2AT based device could be attributed to the higher hole mobility of B2AT.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) curves of B2AT and B2A2T devices are shown in Fig. 3b, in which the B2AT device exhibits a broad photoresponse covering almost the entire visible region, while the B2A2T device shows higher IPCE values and a broader spectrum than those of B2AT. This could be the reason why the B2A2T device exhibits the relatively higher Jsc.
To extract more information from the active layer, the surface morphologies of the small-molecule only and small-molecule:PC71BM were analyzed by using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. As shown in Fig. 4, the spin-coated films from pure B2AT and B2A2T exhibit a formless and smooth surface with a root-means-square (RMS) roughness of 0.66 and 0.61 nm, respectively. The slightly larger RMS value of the B2AT film likely originates from its relatively stronger intermolecular packing,45,46 as is evidenced by its optical properties.

The AFM height and phase images of blend films of B2AT:PC71BM and B2A2T:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 5. The obtained RMS roughness value is 4.08 nm for B2AT:PC71BM. Upon changing the electron donor, the roughness value of the composite film based on B2A2T is reduced to 3.12 nm, indicating the more evenly distributed morphological features of B2A2T:PC71BM.18 Very different morphologies were observed for these two blend films in their phase images. As shown in Fig. 5 (right panels), nano-phase separation is formed in the B2AT-based active layer, but the domain size is greater than 100 nm, which should reduce the effective D/A interface and then limit the exciton dissociation probability.47,48 On the other hand, the B2A2T:PC71BM film shows much better phase separation than B2AT, and exhibits rather uniformly and evenly distributed domains (about 30 nm), which comes closer to the exciton diffusion length,49,50 and thus, it benefits the exciton separation and charge transport. From these, the lower RMS value and better nanophase separation might account for the higher PCE of B2A2T:PC71BM than that of B2AT:PC71BM.

To gain a better understanding of the molecular organization, small-molecule and small-molecule:PC71BM were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is clear from the XRD patterns of small-molecule only films (Fig. 6a) that B2AT shows a broad peak centered at 2θ = 20° suggesting the non-crystalline nature of this compound, which agrees well with the DSC result. In B2A2T, a similar amorphous peak was also observed, but its intensity was weak. These findings indicate that the B2AT film consists of relatively higher-ordered molecular aggregates,45,46 possibly due to increased intermolecular reactions induced by its more planar chemical structure (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the results of UV-vis spectroscopy and AFM analyses.
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of pure small-molecule films (a) and small-molecule:PC71BM blend films (b). 
As shown in Fig. 6b, the XRD pattern of the B2A2T:PC71BM blend film shows a broad peak from 2θ = 15° to 35°, while the film of B2AT:PC71BM exhibits an enhanced broad peak from 2θ = 15° to 35°, suggesting that the B2AT:PC71BM blend film has a higher degree of molecular ordering.51 This may explain why the B2AT:PC71BM film possesses the more phase separated morphology as observed in the AFM images.43
The above results indicate that the all-thiophene-substituted N-heteroacenes are promising electron-donor materials for highly efficient bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. Further optimization is in process to optimize the device performance.
Conclusions
In conclusion, new high-efficiency small molecule donors, B2AT and B2A2T, have been designed and synthesized. Our research indicated that the introduction of thiophene substituents into the N-heteroacene molecular architecture leads to high solubility and thermostability, relatively favorable light absorption and hole mobility for OSCs, low-lying HOMO levels, and significantly weaker intermolecular packing compared with the corresponding none-thiophene-substituted N-heteroacenes. As a result of these molecular characteristics, record PCEs of 4.82% and 5.39% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) have been achieved for N-heteroacene based BHJ devices from B2AT and B2A2T:PC71BM, with a high Voc of 1.02 and 1.00 V, respectively. The higher PCE value for solar cells based on B2A2T is attributed to the improved surface morphology of the active layer. Although the optimization of the devices is still in progress, this meaningful attempt to identify the structure–property relationship of the new donors will stimulate further work in the search to obtain efficient donor systems by utilizing the same strategy.
