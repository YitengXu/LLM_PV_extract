    , Accepted 26th May 2011First published on 7th July 2011AbstractWe report a novel method to in situ synthesise one-dimensional rodlike ZnO nanocrystals directly in the presence of a self-assembling diblock copolymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(zinc methacrylate acetate) (P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc), where the P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc is acting as a molecular template for geometrical manipulation of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals and, meanwhile, as a precursor for ZnO nanoparticles. HRTEM and SAED reveal that rodlike ZnO nanocrystals are assembled by ZnO nanoparticles with almost the same orientation due to the dipole-induced interaction between adjacent ZnO nanoparticles. SEM images show that the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals are homogenously dispersed in the polymer matrix without obvious macrophase separation and its length can be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis time. In the nanocomposites, as rodlike ZnO nanocrystals synthesized in a well-defined morphological confinement from the self-assembly of a diblock copolymer dispersed closely to P3HT chains with a high interface area, the photo-generated excitons are easy to separate into electrons and holes at the interfaces, resulting in the strong photoluminescence quenching of 70% observed in the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 1 h. These results indicate that this type of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. The device based on P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films hydrolyzed for 1 h yields a power conversion efficiency of 0.19% under AM 1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
1. Introduction
In the past decades, hybridization of conjugated polymers with inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals has attracted considerable attention because it offers the potential of combining the best parts of the characteristic properties of the two entities (e.g. the high electron mobility, good physical and chemical stability of an inorganic semiconductor and the excellent processability of a conjugated polymer) in a single hybrid.1–3 Optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers and inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals are widely studied as hybrid bulk heterojunctions because nanocrystals can act as electron acceptors to assist charge separation and broaden the spectral response.4–6 Many inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals such as TiO2,7,8 CdS,9,10CdSe,11ZnO12,13 and PbS14 have been widely used for hybrid bulk heterojunction solar cells. Among these inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals, ZnO is a good candidate for its well-controlled synthetic procedures, easy control of shape and size, and environmental friendliness.15
The conventional methods for preparing nanocrystal-conjugated polymer composite materials rely upon synthesizing nanocrystals separately, and then mixing them with the conjugated polymer. This approach has some significant drawbacks: firstly, a surfactant must be used to control nanocrystal size, shape and distribution. Although the incorporation of the surfactant into an organic/inorganic composite can improve distribution of nanocrystals in a conjugated polymer, most surfactants are insulating which will impede the photo-induced electron transfer and the charge transport in the blend and thus reduce the efficiency of the devices. Secondly, the mixing approach requires the use of co-solvents. It is hard to find a solvent that can accommodate both nanocrystals and conjugated polymers and, hence, the processing window for such combinations of materials is often quite narrow. In addition, actual control over the morphology of the hybrid bulk heterojunction is extremely difficult.
These problems can be overcome by the in situgrowth of the nanocrystals within the polymer matrix without the use of any surfactants or ligands. In situgrowth of nanocrystals within the polymer matrix can be considered as an interesting way to obtain intimate blends of nanocrystals and conjugated polymers at the molecular level or on a nanometre scale. Meanwhile, the macromolecular chains enable the stabilization of the nanocrystals and passivation of their surface states. The principle of this approach is based on the dissolution of the nanocrystals precursor in a solution of the polymer, and the growth of the nanocrystals in the polymer template. This strategy has been applied to a variety of inorganic nanocrystals, such as TiO2,16,17ZnO,12,13,18 PbS19,20 and CdS.9,21 However, only a few reports were related to the polymer template-directed synthesis of 1-D inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals. It is generally believed that the in situ formation of 1-D nanocrystals, e.g., nanorods or nanowires, in the composite is technically desirable for photovoltaic applications because 1-D nanocrystals can act as large-surface-area electron acceptors and provide continuous conduction pathways for electrons in a bulk heterojunction.4 Liao et al.9 have grown CdS nanorods in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) template in situ, the sulfur atom of the thiophene ring giving an anchoring site for the nucleation of the nanocrystals. Watt et al.22 reported that PbS nanorods were directly formed in poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene] (MEH–PPV) during the precipitation of nanocrystal/conjugated polymer composites.
Herein, we report a new approach to in situhydrolysis growth of one-dimensional rodlike ZnO nanocrystals assembled by nanoparticles in the self-assembly of a diblock copolymer—poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly (zinc methacrylate acetate) (P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc). Owing to the template function of the self-assembling P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc, rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were homogeneously dispersed in the hybrids without evident macrophase separation, indicating excellent compatibility and a large interfacial area between P3HT and ZnO nanocrystals. The morphologies of hybrids films and the appearances of ZnO nanocrystals could be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis time. It was more interesting that rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were assembled by oriented attachment of preformed quasi-spherical ZnO nanoparticles. The detailed nanostructures of rodlike nanocrystals have been studied using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The application of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films in optoelectric devices was also discussed.
2. Experimental
Materials

2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene, t-butyl magnesium chloride, vinyl magnesium bromide, 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane nickel(II) chloride (Ni(dppp)Cl2, 97%), 9-borabicyclo (3.3.1) nonane (9-BBN), 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB, 97%), 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyl triethylene tetramine (HMTETA, 97%), were purchased from Aldrich and Alfa Aesar and used without purification. Copper(I) bromide (CuBr) was purified by stirring with glacial acetic acid, followed by washing with CH2Cl2. All solvents were freshly distilled prior to use. Triethylamine (TEA), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled over sodium and calcium hydride (CaH2) respectively.
Synthesis of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(zinc methacrylate acetate) (P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc) diblock copolymer

          P3HT-b-PZnMAAc was synthesized via the atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of asymmetric zinc methacrylate acetate (ZnMAAc)23 using a bromoester terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) macroinitiator (P3HT–Br). P3HT–Br was synthesized following a literature procedure developed by McCullough and co-workers (experimental procedures given in the ESI†).24 The ATRP of ZnMAAc was performed using CuBr as a catalyst, HMTETA as a ligand and P3HT–Br as the macroinitiator. Polymerization of ZnMAAc was performed at a molar ratio of [ZnMAAc]0:[P3HT–Br]0:[CuBr]0:[HMTETA]0 = 300:1:1:2 in toluene at 90 °C. A dry nitrogen bottle was charged with P3HT–Br (2.2 g, 0.1 mmol), ZnMAAc (6.3 g, 30 mmol). The reaction mixture was immersed in a thermostated oil bath at 90 °C. Then, CuBr (14.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) and HMTETA (50 μL, 0.2 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture via a deoxygenated syringe. The reaction time was 12 h and then P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc was precipitated in methanol.
Synthesis of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films
In a typical synthesis, 20 mg of P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc were dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene and was formed into films by spin casting at 1500 rpm. When the films dried, the films were immersed in 1 mol L−1NaOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for different hydrolysis times, and subsequently cleaned in ethanol and water for 15 min, and lastly dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature.
3. Characterization
The structures of all the polymeric products were characterized by 1HNMR (600 MHz Varian) spectrometry using deuterated chloroform as a solvent, and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the reference. To investigate the structures of the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals and the self-assembling diblock copolymer—P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc, transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F, field emission transmission electron microscope) was employed. The morphology observations of P3HT/ZnO hybrid films were made by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI, QuanTA-200F environmental scanning electron microscope) with gold vapor deposition. Optical properties were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750) and a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-7000) equipped with an excitation source of 460 nm wavelength. The fluorescence lifetime was determined with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a H2 gas lamp as the light source. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000). All the measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) were detected under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a monocrystalline silicon diode.
4. Results and discussion
To acquire template of self-assembling copolymer, we rationally designed poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(zinc methacrylate acetate) (P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc) diblock copolymer including rigid thiophene chains and flexible chains which act as the precursor of ZnO nanocrystals. The P3HT-bb-ZnMAAcdiblock copolymer was synthesized via the atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of asymmetric zinc methacrylate acetate (ZnMAAc)23 using bromoester terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) macroinitiator (P3HT–Br) (Scheme 1). And then, P3HT/ZnO hybrid films were prepared by in situhydrolysis of P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc films in NaOH aqueous solution.

The nature of the P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer containing rigid chains and flexible chains endows the diblock copolymer with self-assembling behavior. As shown in Fig. 2, TEM (see ESI, S1†) and HRTEM images of the P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer film revealed the distinct self-assembled structure. The fiberlike areas were related to P3HT lamellar chains and the distance between adjacent fibers was 0.36 nm which was accordance to the π–π stacking distance between polythiophene backbones,25 it has been reported that this organization was the lamellar chain packing in thin films of P3HT.3,26,27

The P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films were obtained by in situhydrolysis of P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer films. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) (see ESI, S2†) manifested the presence of ZnO nanocrystals. The morphologies of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films obtained by hydrolysis for 10 min (Fig. 3a), 30 min (Fig. 3b) and 1 h (Fig. 3c) were examined by SEM. The SEM images all showed that rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were homogeneously dispersed in the hybrids without evident macrophase separation, indicating excellent compatibility between P3HT and ZnO nanocrystals, and the length of the rodlike nanocrystals increased with increasing hydrolysis time. As we know, the typical morphology of hybrid bulk-heterojunction solar cells by physical blending separate nanocrystals with conjugated polymers is prone to macrophase separation due to the aggregation of nanocrystals, which can be effectively avoided in our case. It was worthwhile to note that the ZnO nanocrystals were all rodlike in appearance, which might result from the template function of the self-assembled P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer precursors. In addition, the cross-sectional SEM image of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 10 min revealed that rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were distributed homogenously in the P3HT matrix.

To learn more about the formation and nanostructure of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals, we performed TEM observations of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 1 h, as shown in Fig. 4. To our surprise, it could be obviously observed that the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were composed of quasi-spherical ZnO nanoparticles, rather than single-crystal ZnO nanorods (Fig. 4(a)), and the length of the ZnO nanorods was about 150 nm on average. Then, we chose different areas to investigate detailed nanostructures of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals at higher magnification. In the majority of areas of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals, we could observe clear quasi-spherical ZnO nanoparticles and the crystal orientation of each ZnO nanoparticles tended to be identical, i.e. (002), due to the low free energy of the (002) plane (Fig. 4(b)). In the meantime, the selected area electron diffraction pattern of such an area was intermediate between the pattern of single-crystal ZnO and that of ZnO powder. In small parts of the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals, no distinct ZnO nanoparticles were observed except the crystal diffraction pattern of single-crystal ZnO (Fig. 4(c)). These results puzzled us.

(b, c) HRTEM images of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals in the corresponding areas (inset: selected area electron diffraction pattern of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals in the corresponding areas). 
To deeply understand the formation of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals, another TEM observation was made in a different way. We dissolved the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film in chloroform and observed it after ultrasonic treatment (Fig. 5). The TEM images showed that only ZnO nanoparticles existed without any ZnO single crystal nanorods, the size of ZnO nanoparticles was varied in a range of 4 nm to 9 nm. This experiment proved that the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were completely composed of ZnO nanoparticles. Based on all these observations, the formation mechanism of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals may be depicted as follows (Fig. 6). In the self-assembling P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer, zinc ions were focused in the flexible chains regions where ZnO nanoparticles would grow during the hydrolysis process. According to the report of Weller et al., ZnO nanorods could be self-assembled from high-concentration ZnO nanoparticles.28 Meanwhile, it is well-known that ZnO nanoparticles are a kind of polar materials. The dipole-induced oriented attraction will lead to the self-assembly of high-concentration ZnO nanoparticles into rodlike ZnO nanocrystals and the orientation of ZnO nanoparticles tends to be almost identical, e.g.Fig. 4(b). Similar behavior has been found in the formation of PbS nanorods in conjugated polymers.29 When the separation of ZnO nanoparticles was small enough, intimate contact of adjacent ZnO nanoparticles would make their orientation the same, e.g.Fig. 4(c).28 Therefore, we speculated that with the aid of the template of self-assembling diblock copolymer, when the concentration of ZnO nanoparticles increased gradually in the process of hydrolysis, the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals would slowly form.

The application of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films in optoelectric devices was also investigated by optical properties experiments. The optical properties of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films, spin-cast from chlorobenzene, have been characterized by absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and PL decay spectroscopy. The normalized UV-vis spectra of the pristine P3HT and P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films hydrolyzed for different amounts of time are shown in Fig. 7. A slight red-shift of the P3HT band was observed in each of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films, compared to the pristine P3HT in the 400–650 nm region. At the same time, the shoulders due to vibronic transitions located at 550 and 600 nm appeared in the presence of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals. Previous work has shown that the red-shift of the P3HT band and the presence of these shoulders correlate to the increased molecular order and the enhanced hole mobility in the conjugated polymer.30,31 In our experiment, the red-shift and the presence of the shoulders could be attributed to the presence of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals. The attachment of the polymer chains on the ZnO nanorods surface favors more planar molecular orientations, and the more planar orientations lead to an increase in effective conjugation length and results in the observed red shift.32

Fig. 8 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure P3HT and P3HT/ZnO hybrids hydrolyzed in NaOH aqueous solution for 10 min, 30 min and 1 h. By analysis of the 1HNMR spectra, we found that the weight fraction of ZnO in P3HT hybrids obtained by hydrolysis was about 10%. Compared to the pristine P3HT, the PL spectra of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposites exhibited some quenching of the fluorescence, a maximum of 70% of the fluorescence intensity was lost in the P3HT/ZnO after 1 h of hydrolytic treatment. The strong fluorescence quenching of the P3HT/ZnO hybrids was due to the formation of a heterojunction of P3HT/ZnO and the fast deactivation of the excited state by the electron-transfer reaction between P3HT and ZnO nanocrystals. In addition to this effect, self-quenching due to π–π stacking of P3HT was also considered, which is evident from TEM images. The PL lifetime of P3HT is another piece of evidence of the optical characteristics that suggest the interaction within the composites. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements (i.e., ultrafast emission dynamics), monitored at the wavelength above 650 nm, were performed to give additional information on the charge-transfer dynamics in the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposites by measuring the fluorescence lifetimes (Fig. 9). The solid-state dynamics process tool place on the picosecond time scale and involved diffusion of the electronic excitations from P3HT to ZnO nanocrystals. The measurements revealed that the luminescence of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposites had a life time of 780 ps (hydrolysized for 10 min), 770 ps (hydrolysized for 30 min) and 760 ps (hydrolysized for 1 h), while it was 810 ps in pristine P3HT. The faster PL decay of the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposites than that of P3HT can be attributed to the improved interfacial contact between P3HT and ZnO in the nanocomposites, where it is easy for the exciton to find the interface and dissociate, representing a rapid charge transfer from P3HT to the ZnO nanocrystals.33,34

The schematics of our device structure and band diagram are shown in Fig. 10. To fabricate the device, commercially available ITO-glass substrates with a sheet resistivity of 5–8 Ω/square were first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, isopropanol and de-ionized water for 10 min. The ZnO layer was spin-coated on top of the ITO-glass substrate,35,36P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc (10 mg mL−1) was then spin-coated, when the films dried, the films were immersed in 1 mol L−1NaOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for different hydrolysis times, subsequently cleaned in ethanol and water for 15 min, and at last dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was then subsequently spin-coated. The PEDOT:PSS layer was annealed at 140 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the devices were completed with the deposition of an 80 nm thick Ag top electrode by thermal evaporation. The complete layer structure was glass|ITO|ZnO|P3HT:ZnO|PEDOT:PSS|Ag. The area of device is 20 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells under AM 1.5 G irradiation with irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 10. A schematic layout of the cell structure is shown inset. Table 1 summarizes the data. It shows the variation of both Jsc and Voc based on P3HT/ZnO hybrid films hydrolyzed for 10 min and 1 h. To illustrate the function of the ZnO rodlike structures, the device J–V characteristics of the P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc film as the active layer were also measured. However, the device based on the P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAc film as the active layer showed no photovoltaic response. The result proved that device J–V characteristics originated from the hybrid heterojunction of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals and P3HT. It was observed that Jsc increased with increasing hydrolysis time. However, Voc, which is limited by the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor,37,38 remained identical at about 0.36 V. The increase of Jsc and fill factor (FF) with increasing hydrolysis time suggested that the length of rod-like ZnO nanocrystals reduced charge recombination, leading to the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 1 h (0.19%). In other words, longer rod-like ZnO particles make it easier to form a percolation path between two electrodes and thereby can thus fully contribute to photovoltaic conversion.9 Although the PCE of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 1 h was only 0.19%, it should be noted that the weight fraction of ZnO nanocrystals in our case was very low (about 10%). According to the results of Janssen et al., the PCE was 0.09% when the volume fraction of ZnO nanocrystals in P3HT/ZnO was 8% (i.e. the weight fraction was about 20%).12 In their case, the P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films were prepared by simply physical mixing. The results revealed that rodlike ZnO nanocrystals synthesized in a well-defined morphological confinement that arose from the self-assembly of a diblock copolymer were homogeneously dispersed in the hybrids without evident macrophase separation, indicating excellent compatibility between P3HT and ZnO nanocrystals, which was beneficial for the formation of an interpenetrating network for efficient photo-induced electron transfer and charge separation. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 11 which is indicative of efficient photon-to-electron conversion. The relatively low IPCE values for both devices indicate that much of the light absorbed is not converted to charge carriers, which is likely due to the low weight fraction of ZnO in the P3HT/ZnO hybrids.39 The increase of ZnO weight fraction in self-assembly biblock copolymer template in situ is continuing in our laboratory.

5. Conclusion

In situ formation of rodlike ZnO nanocrystals composed of ZnO nanoparticlesvia self-assembling template technology using a P3HT-bbb-PZnMAAcdiblock copolymer containing rigid thiophene chains and flexible chains, acting as a molecular template during hydrolysis synthesis and, simultaneously, as a conjugated polymer matrix was used to form the final P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite structure. Rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were homogenously dispersed in the self-assembled polymer matrix without the involvement of surfactants and the length of the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals could be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis time. Due to the dipole-induced interaction between adjacent ZnO nanoparticles, the rodlike ZnO nanocrystals were assembled by ZnO nanoparticles with almost the same crystal orientation. This type of structure will lead to a high interface area for effective photogeneration of charges and an appropriate phase separation into continuous p- and n-type domains for effective transport of charges (holes and electrons) toward the electrodes, giving the PL quenching of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite film hydrolyzed for 1 h a level as high as 70%, which is suitable for application in optoelectric devices. The device based on P3HT/ZnO hybrid films hydrolyzed for 1 h yields a power conversion efficiency of 0.19%, albeit there is room for technical development whish has not yet being fully explored and optimized in terms of synthesis of P3HT/ZnO nanocomposite films and device assembly in this investigation. An interesting task for future work would be to achieve oriented alignment of these rodlike ZnO nanocrystals to desired directions for different applications.
