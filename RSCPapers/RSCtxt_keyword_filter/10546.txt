    , Accepted 9th February 2022First published on 23rd February 2022AbstractSequentially deposited (SD) donor/acceptor quasi-heterojunctions allow for more freedom to modulate the optical and charge transport properties of the active layer compared to donor:acceptor blend bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). It is expected that the former have potential application in semi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). Herein, a comparison study on SD-type and BHJ-type ST-OSCs employing PTB7-Th as the donor and IEICO-4Cl as the acceptor indicates that the SD-type ST-OSCs could improve light utilization efficiencies (LUEs) as compared to BHJ-type ST-OSCs. A wide-bandgap polymer PCDTBT is introduced into the PTB7-Th layer as the second donor in a SD-type device. By doing so, the mixed donor layer not only becomes more robust to the sequential solution processing, but also favors the formation of a quasi-heterojunction with better charge generation and charge collection. Finally, the transparency of the ST-OSCs is further enhanced by introducing a thin MgF2 as the light out-coupling layer atop the semitransparent Au electrode. The optimized ST-OSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.30% with an average visible transmittance of 43.93% and a light utilization efficiency of 2.77%.
Introduction
Global demand for clean and renewable energy has grown rapidly considering the energy crisis and looming environmental problems.1–3 Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention in past decades as a competitive renewable energy source.4–9 In particular, semi-transparent OSCs (ST-OSCs), which convert a certain part of sunlight into electrical energy and let the other part through, have potential applications in building-integrated photovoltaics and portable electronic devices.10–13 Donor:acceptor blend bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) fabricated via one-step processing are the most prevalent active layer structures in opaque OSCs and ST-OSCs.14–18 Due to the rapid development of novel organic donor and acceptor materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of opaque BHJ OSCs have broken through 18%.19–24 The BHJ layer requires that the donor and acceptor are blended in a suitable ratio and form nanoscale phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, in which it is difficult to adjust the absorption of the donor and acceptor independently. Two-step sequential deposition (SD) of the donor and acceptor has been used to fabricate OSCs since the donor layer and acceptor layer can be optimized independently.25–27 A quasi-heterojunction of a SD-type active layer has desired vertical component distribution of the donor and acceptor, which is beneficial to charge collection.28,29 More recently, the PCE of SD-type OSCs has been reported to be over 18%, which is comparable to the results of BHJ-type OSCs.6,30 The SD method also demonstrated great potential for ST-OSCs. Huang et al. fabricated SD-type ST-OSCs based on PTB7-Th/IEICO-4F and achieved a comparable PCE but a higher average visible transmittance (AVT) than those of the corresponding BHJ devices.31 Wei et al. reported SD-type ST-OSCs based on PM6/Y6, which exhibit higher PCE and transparency than BHJ devices, especially when the active layer thickness is reduced.32 However, the inevitable spin-rinsing of the upper layer on the underlying layer in SD has to be considered.33–35
The ternary blend has been verified as an effective strategy to fabricate ST-OSCs. A third component plays an important role in modulating the absorption/transmittance properties or/and improving the blend film morphology. Xu et al. fabricated ternary ST-OSCs by adding PC71BM into the PBTB-TF:Y6 blend and a PCE of 13.0% with an AVT of 21.4% was achieved.36 Li et al. reported a kind of ST-OSC based on the ternary PBTB-TF:Y6:BTTPC blend, demonstrating a PCE of 13.1% and an AVT of 22.4%.37 Such ternary ST-OSCs were often based on BHJ structures, and ternary ST-OSCs prepared using the SD strategy have been rarely reported.
In this work, we report a type of efficient ternary ST-OSC based on PTB7-Th and IEICO-4Cl via the SD method, and the corresponding BHJ-type ST-OSCs were used as the reference. The SD-type ST-OSCs demonstrated comparable PCEs but increased AVTs as compared to the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl BHJ-type ST-OSCs, showing the advantages of the SD method in fabricating ST-OSCs. A second wide-bandgap donor PCDTBT doped into the PTB7-Th donor layer further enhanced the light utilization efficiency and color rendering index (CRI) of the SD-type ternary ST-OSCs. It is disclosed that the introduction of PCDTBT not only helps in resisting chloroform spin-rinsing, but also improves the charge generation and charge collection. Moreover, the transparency of the ST-OSCs was further enhanced by introducing a thin light out-coupling layer of MgF2 atop the semitransparent Au electrode. Consequently, a PCE of 6.30% with an AVT of 43.93% and a light utilization efficiency of 2.77% was achieved in such SD-type ST-OSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and IEICO-4Cl used in this study together with their normalized absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1. The final device configuration is also presented in Fig. 1b. PTB7-Th shows broad absorption of 360–800 nm with peaks at 640 nm and 705 nm, and the absorption coefficient is relatively low in the 400–600 nm region where the human eye is sensitive. The IEICO-4Cl acceptor exhibits strong absorption in the 700–1000 nm region with a peak located at 890 nm. A combination of a PTB7-Th donor and an IEICO-4Cl acceptor is conducive to improve the AVT and utilize near-infrared light for realizing efficient photovoltaic conversion in the resultant ST-OSCs. PCDTBT shows absorption in the range of 350–650 nm. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and IEICO-4Cl are presented in Fig. 1d. The LUMO/HOMO levels of PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and IEICO-4Cl are −3.59/−5.20 eV, −3.57/−5.45 eV and −4.23/−5.56 eV, respectively.38–40 PTB7-Th and PCDTBT were used as polymer donors and IEICO-4Cl as the acceptor, respectively. The large offsets between the donors and acceptor guarantee efficient exciton dissociation at the interfaces.

The binary ST-OSCs were first fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Au (10 nm) employing PTB7-Th as the donor and IEICO-4Cl as the acceptor. Such a combination of a PTB7-Th donor and an IEICO-4Cl acceptor can exhibit strong absorption in the near-infrared region, which is conducive to improve the AVT and utilize the near-infrared light more efficiently towards achieving efficient photovoltaic conversion. The active layer was prepared by the SD method and their thicknesses were set at 120 nm, 105 nm and 90 nm, in which the PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl thicknesses are 50/70 nm, 35/70 nm and 20/70 nm, respectively. The ST-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl BHJ active layers with 120 nm, 105 nm and 90 nm were also fabricated for comparison. The AVT of the devices in the range of 370–740 nm is calculated according to a previously reported method.41 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these ST-OSCs employing BHJ-type and SD-type active layers are shown in Fig. 2a, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters and optical parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. The average PCE values are obtained from more than 25 devices and the PCE distribution is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In the case of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl BHJ ST-OSCs, the devices exhibited open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 0.71 V and fill factors of 56–58%. By increasing the thickness of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl BHJ active layer from 90 to 120 nm, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the devices was increased accordingly. The PCEs of the binary BHJ ST-OSCs with the active layer thicknesses of 90, 105, and 120 nm are 5.39%, 6.17%, and 6.23%, respectively, and the corresponding AVTs of these devices are 37.86%, 33.68%, and 30.68%, respectively. The SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs demonstrated higher FFs in comparison to the counterpart BHJ devices with the same thicknesses, and the FFs of the former devices were improved to 58–59%. The PCEs of the SD PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs with active layer thicknesses of 90, 105 and 120 nm are 5.17%, 6.09% and 6.55%, respectively. The corresponding AVTs of these devices are 41.95%, 37.69% and 33.23%. These results indicate that SD-type ST-OSCs could produce comparable PCEs, but higher AVTs in comparison to the corresponding BHJ-type ST-OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these ST-OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2b and the calculated JSC values based on the EQE results are shown in Table 1. These data indicate that the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl based ST-OSCs show relatively low EQEs at 400–600 nm, but higher EQEs at 600–1000 nm. This is mainly attributed to the absorption characteristics of the PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl combination, which shows strong absorption in the near-infrared region. In the case of BHJ-type ST-OSCs, the EQE is gradually decreased by decreasing the thickness of the active layer with the profile nearly unchanged. In the SD-type ST-OSCs, the EQE profile can be tuned by changing the PTB7-Th donor thickness. The EQE in the range of 460–780 nm is decreased in comparison with the BHJ-type ST-OSCs with the same active layer thickness, which may be helpful to modulate the transparency of the ST-OSCs. The transmittance spectra of these ST-OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2c. It is seen that the SD-type ST-OSCs exhibit higher transmittance at 450–750 nm and a similar transmittance in the near-infrared region of 750–1000 nm as compared to the BHJ-type ST-OSCs. This indicates that the SD-type PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs could increase the AVT more effectively by modulating the donor layer thickness while there is only a weak effect on their PCEs. Quantum utilization efficiencies (QUE) of these devices are displayed in Fig. 2d. The QUE is the sum of EQE and transmittance, and is often used to evaluate the overall properties of ST-OSCs.42 The SD-type ST-OSCs display slightly higher QUE values in the range of 400–750 nm than the corresponding BHJ-type ST-OSCs with the same thicknesses. These results indicate the advantage of sequential deposition in preparing ST-OSCs. The light utilization efficiency (LUE) defined by the product of PCE and AVT is often used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of ST-OSCs. The LUEs of both the SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl and BHJ-type PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs are given in Table 1. These BHJ-type PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs showed quite similar LUEs of about 1.90–2.08%. The SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs exhibited higher LUEs than those of the corresponding BHJ-based devices with the same active layer thicknesses. The SD-processed PTB7-Th (35 nm)/IEICO-4Cl (70 nm) ST-OSCs achieved the highest LUE of 2.30%.

As compared to the PTB7-Th donor and IEICO-4Cl acceptor, PCDTBT is a type of wide bandgap donor material, which may modulate the transmittance properties of the ternary blend film. The normalized absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:PCDTBT blend films and SD-type PTB7-Th:PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary blend films are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The addition of PCDTBT can enhance the absorption profile at 300–600 nm, and the incorporation of appropriate PCDTBT can modulate its transmittance properties. The SD-type PTB7-Th:PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl based ternary ST-OSCs with different weight ratios of PCDTBT (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) were studied and the detailed photovoltaic parameters and optical parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). When 10% PCDTBT was added, the JSC of the device was increased from 14.62 mA cm−2 to 16.44 mA cm−2 and the FF was also increased to 59.66%. Despite the VOC being slightly decreased to 0.68 V, the PCE was increased from 6.09% to 6.71%. The EQEs of SD-type 10% PCDTBT ternary ST-OSCs and SD-type binary ST-OSCs are plotted for comparison in Fig. 3a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters and optical parameters are also listed in Table 1. The EQE value is obviously increased in the whole range, indicating that PCDTBT may promote the photoelectric conversion. The transmittance spectra of the SD-type ternary and binary ST-OSCs are shown in Fig. 3b. The introduction of PCDTBT in PTB7-Th slightly decreases the visible light transmittance, leading to an AVT of 36.07%. Moreover, the improved PCE and slightly decreased AVT finally result in an enhanced LUE of 2.42%.

(e) JSC and (f) VOC dependence on the illuminated light intensity for the SD-type binary PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl and ternary PTB7-Th:PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and PTB7-Th:PCDTBT blend films are plotted in Fig. 3c. The PCDTBT film exhibits a strong emission peak at 700 nm while the PTB7-Th film shows an emission peak at 800 nm. The emission of PCDTBT was not observed in the PTB7-Th:PCDTBT blend film and at the same time the PL intensity of PTB7-Th becomes stronger, indicating an efficient energy transfer from PCDTBT to PTB7-Th. Since the emission of PCDTBT is overlapped with the absorption of PTB7-Th as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) may occur between them.43,44 The photo-generated excitons on PTB7-Th and PCDTBT donors can be dissociated into free charge carriers at PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl and PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl interfaces. The PCDTBT excitons may also experience energy transfer via FRET to PTB7-Th and subsequently dissociate at the PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl interface. The excitons of IEICO-4Cl will be dissociated at PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl and PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl interfaces. The photogenerated electrons will be collected through the IEICO-4Cl pathways. The photogenerated holes are mainly collected via pathways composed of the PTB7-Th phase. The holes within the PCDTBT phase may transfer to PTB7-Th based on their HOMO levels. The possible energy transfer between PTB7-Th and PCDTBT may enhance the exciton utilization efficiency and thus improves the JSC of the corresponding SD-type ternary ST-OSCs.
The photocurrent density–effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves were further measured to gain insights into the dynamic process in the SD-type binary and ternary system and the results are shown in Fig. 3d. Jph can be calculated by the difference between the illuminated current density (JL) and the dark current density (JD). Veff is the corrected applied voltage by V0 and V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero. All the photo-generated free charges are assumed to be collected when Veff is higher than 2 V, at which the saturation current density (Jsat) was achieved. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) was calculated with Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The Jsat values of the SD-type binary PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl device and SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary device are 15.85 mA cm−2 and 17.64 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Gmax was increased from 9.43 × 1027 m−3 s−1 to 1.05 × 1028 m−3 s−1. These results indicate that the introduction of 10% PCDTBT in PTB7-Th enhances the charge generation ability of the ternary system in comparison to the SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl binary system. Charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) defined by Jph/Jsat can also be calculated from Fig. 3d. The SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary device shows a Pcoll of 0.942, higher than 0.910 of the SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl binary device. The higher charge generation ability and charge collection efficiency of the SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary device lead to the high JSC and FF.
The charge recombination in the SD-type binary and ternary devices is also studied, and the dependence of JSC and VOC on the incident light intensity (Plight) is shown in Fig. 3e and f. The value of parameter α in JSC ∝ Pαlight is usually used to evaluate the degree of bimolecular recombination. The values of α for the SD-type binary and ternary devices are 0.929 and 0.932, respectively, indicating a slightly decreased bimolecular recombination in the PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary device. The value of parameter n in VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight) can reflect the recombination under open-circuit conditions, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. Trap-assisted recombination is the dominant process when the n value is close to 2, whereas the bimolecular recombination occurs with the n value close to 1. The fitted n values for the SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl binary device and SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl device are 1.15 and 1.08, respectively, indicating suppressed trap-assisted recombination in the SD-type ternary device.
The SD-type binary and ternary morphologies were studied with their atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images shown in Fig. 4. Both PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT show rather smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.90–0.96 nm. CF used as the solvent of IEICO-4Cl was used to spin-rinse the PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT layers. It is found that CF spin-rinsing did not severely deteriorate the surface morphology of the underlying PTB7-Th or PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT layers. After spin-coating the IEICO-4Cl layer, the SD-type PTB7-Th/IEICO-4Cl binary film exhibited a relatively rough surface with a RMS of 1.71 nm, and the SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl showed a RMS of 1.37 nm.

The image size of AFM is 2 μm × 2 μm. 
The contact angles of neat PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT blend films were measured to further evaluate the interaction between CF and underlying donor layers and the results are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The surface tension (γ) values of the materials were calculated from the contact angles and the solubility parameters (δ) were calculated according to the literature.45,46 The solvent–molecule interaction parameters (χ) were calculated according to Flory–Huggins theory, and results are listed in Table 2. The calculated interaction parameters of χPTB7-Th-CF and χPCDTBT-CF are 0.47 and 1.12, respectively. The high interaction parameter of χPCDTBT-CF implies that PCDTBT has poorer solubility in CF than PTB7-Th. The introduction of 10% PCDTBT in PTB7-Th increases the interaction parameters between CF and the PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT blend film. The increased interaction parameter is helpful in resisting the spin-rinsing of CF. The absorption spectra of PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT blend films without and with CF spin-rinsing are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is clearly seen that the absorption of the PCDTBT film is almost unchanged after CF spin-rinsing. The introduction of PCDTBT into the PTB7-Th matrix is favorable to resist CF spin-rinsing in the resultant PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT blend film. These results are consistent with the calculated solvent–molecule interaction parameters.

The SD-type ternary PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs were further optimized by depositing a thin light-outcoupling layer of MgF2 over ultrathin Au electrode to enhance the transmittance of the devices while maintaining a relatively high PCE. The thickness of MgF2 was optimized through optical simulation as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the optimal thickness of MgF2 is 60 nm, at which the device demonstrates the highest transmittance. The J–V curves of SD-type ternary ST-OSCs covered with 60 nm MgF2 are shown in Fig. 5a and the detailed photovoltaic and optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary ST-OSCs with an MgF2 light out-coupling layer show a decreased JSC of 15.75 mA cm−2 and a PCE to 6.30% in comparison to 16.44 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 6.71% of the ternary ST-OSCs without MgF2. The transmittance spectra of SD-type ST-OSCs without and with MgF2 are shown in Fig. 5b. The transmittance of the PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary ST-OSCs with MgF2 increases significantly in the whole absorption region, and its AVT is increased to 43.93%. The EQE curves and QUE curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 5c. The EQE of the SD-type ternary ST-OSCs with MgF2 is slightly decreased in the range of 500–1000 nm with regard to the ternary ST-OSCs without MgF2, but the QUE is notably enhanced in the visible light region. The LUE of SD-type ST-OSCs with MgF2 is largely improved to 2.77% despite the decreased PCE. The simulated results of the distribution of normalized modulus square of the optical electric field of PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT:IEICO-4Cl ternary ST-OSCs without and with MgF2 are displayed in Fig. S7 (ESI†). It is found that |E(x)|2 in the photoactive layer of PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary ST-OSCs with MgF2 is weakened, which is consistent with the decreased JSC and increased AVT. Besides the transparent properties, the color perception should be considered in ST-OSCs and it can be depicted using the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram. The positions of color coordinates of different ST-OSCs illuminated by the standard illuminant D65 on the CIE 1931 diagram are displayed in Fig. 5d. The CIE coordinates of the SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ST-OSCs without and with MgF2 are (0.287, 0.319) and (0.291, 0.327), respectively. The CRI of the corresponding devices are 90.9 and 91.6. The CIE coordinate and CRI results indicate that the SD-type PTB7-Th:10% PCDTBT/IEICO-4Cl ternary ST-OSCs with MgF2 demonstrate good color rendering ability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated a type of ternary ST-OSC via sequential processing based on PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and IEICO-4Cl. Such a combination of active materials exhibits broad absorption at 300–1000 nm and strong absorption at 600–1000 nm. The optimized ST-OSCs have a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/PTB7-Th:10%PCDTBT(35 nm)/IEICO-4Cl(70 nm)/PFN-Br(5 nm)/Au(10 nm)/MgF2(60 nm). A second wide-bandgap donor PCDTBT doped into the PTB7-Th donor layer in an SD-type device further optimizes the performance of ST-OSCs. The introduction of PCDTBT not only helps in resisting chloroform spin-rinsing, but also improves the charge generation and charge collection. Finally, the transparency of the ST-OSCs is further enhanced by introducing a thin light out-coupling layer of MgF2 atop the semi-transparent Au electrode. The optimized ST-OSC achieves a PCE of 6.30% with an AVT of 43.93%, leading to a LUE of 2.77%. The prepared ST-OSC is one of the ST-OSCs whose AVT is higher than 40% and PCE higher than 6%.
Experimental section
Materials
Polymer donors PTB7-Th and PCDTBT were purchased from One-Materials Inc. The IEICO-4Cl acceptor was obtained from Organtec Ltd. PFN-Br was obtained from Solarmer Materials Inc. CB and CF were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All the materials and solvents were used as received.
Fabrication of ST-OSCs
The SD-type ST-OSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT/donor/acceptor/Au. The cleaned ITO glass substrates (15 Ω □−1) were treated with UV-ozone for 40 min before use. A 30-nm-thick PEDOT:PSS 4083 was deposited on ITO substrates via spin-coating and annealed at 130 °C for 30 min. The PTB7-Th:PCDTBT blend with different weight ratios was dissolved in CB at a total concentration of 7 mg mL−1. IEICO-4Cl was dissolved in CF at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The PTB7-Th:PCDTBT solution was spin-cast on the PEDOT:PSS layer at different rates for 60 s. The IEICO-4Cl solution was spin-cast on the donor layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The PFN-Br solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 in methanol was spin-cast on the active layers to form a 5 nm-thick buffer layer. Au (10 nm) and MgF2 (60 nm) were deposited in a vacuum under a pressure of 3.0 × 10−4 Pa. The ST-OSCs have an active area of ca. 8 mm2.
Film and device characterization
The J–V curves of the ST-OSCs were recorded with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5G,100 mW cm−2) in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The EQE curves were recorded using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R 3011, Enli Tech. Co.). The absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer. The AFM images were recorded using an HITACHI scanning probe microscope (AFM5100N).
