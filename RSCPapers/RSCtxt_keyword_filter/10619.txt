ChinacDepartment of Chemical Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei 104, TaiwanReceived 30th July 2013, Accepted 12th September 2013First published on 12th September 2013AbstractMulti-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were deposited on a titanium (Ti) foil substrate by using electrophoresis, then a nano-corallines nickel sulfide (NiS) was deposited on the MWCNTs by using a pulse potentiostatic method. The high performance NiS/MWCNT/Ti hybrid film was firstly used as a Pt-free counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The surface of MWCNTs was wrapped with a nano-corallines NiS thin film of ∼45 nm in thickness. Under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G), DSSCs with a NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE achieved an enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.90%, while DSSCs with a Pt/Ti CE obtained the efficiency of 6.36%. The characterization of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated that nano-corallines NiS had high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, MWCNTs had high specific surface area and low resistance, and the synergistic effect of NiS and MWCNTs endowed the superior features of the hybrid film. Therefore, the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE can be used as a promising alternative CE in low-cost and large-scale DSSCs.IntroductionDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention in the past decades as a promising renewable energy source due to their relatively high efficiency, environmental friendliness, easy fabrication and low cost.1–4 DSSCs based on a traditional platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE), cobalt(II/III) electrolyte and zinc porphyrin dye have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12%.3 However, although Pt has high conductivity, catalytic activity and chemical stability, it is one of the most expensive components in DSSCs.2,4 In addition, Pt can be decomposed into PtI4 in the traditional I3−/I− redox couple electrolyte, which will affect the long-term stability of the DSSCs.5,6 Thus, it is necessary to develop an economic, stable, effective and Pt-free CE.Many materials, such as carbon-based materials,7,8 conducting polymers,9–11 sulfides,12,13 and nitrides,14 have been attempted to replace the Pt CE. Among them, multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were believed to be some of the most promising alternative CEs due to their large specific surface area, superior electronic conductivity and excellent mechanical strength.15 However, the efficiencies of the DSSCs based on MWCNT CEs were lower than those based on Pt CEs. Accordingly, Huang et al.16 enhanced the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by reducing Pt nanoparticles on the MWCNTs to increase the surface area of CEs. However, there was still a small amount of Pt in the CE. Li et al.17 reported a DSSC based on a MWCNT/TiN CE, its photovoltaic performance was comparable with that of the DSSC based on a Pt CE. Xiao et al.18 improved the performance of DSSCs by using a CoS/MWCNT hybrid film. Additionally, Sun et al.13 electrodeposited a nickel sulfide (NiS) film on FTO glass by using a potential reversal technique to replace Pt CEs, and this DSSC achieved a conversion efficiency of 6.82%, which was comparable to the device with a conventional Pt CE (7.00%). The above studies indicated that the hybrid film electrode can improve the performance of the DSSCs, however, the efficiencies of these DSSCs are still lower.Herein, we prepared a NiS/MWCNT hybrid film on titanium (Ti) foil by the pulse electrodeposition method. NiS has superior conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for the reduction reaction of I3−/I−, and NiS is chemically stable in the I3−/I− electrolyte.13,19,20 The MWCNTs present a high specific surface area and fiber network structure, which is available for the charge carrier transportation. Ti foil has been used as the electrode substrate for flexible DSSCs, due to its good flexibility, high conductivity and superior corrosion resistance to the I3−/I− electrolyte.21 The pulse electrodeposition method can effectively control the particle size and uniformity of the deposited film, which avoids the diffusion-limited mass transport of ions to the electrode surface in the bulk solution.22 The resultant NiS/MWCNT/Ti electrode possesses large specific surface area, low resistance and high electrocatalytic activity for the redox reaction of I3−/I−. Based on this Pt-free CE, the DSSCs achieved a high light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 7.90%, which is higher than that of the DSSCs based on the Pt/Ti CE (6.39%).ExperimentalFabrication of CEsFlexible Ti foil (0.05 mm thickness, purchased from Baoji Yunjie Metal Production Co., Ltd. China) was used as the substrate due to its excellent electrical conductivity, plasticity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. Ti foil with rectangular dimensions of 2.0 × 1.5 cm2 was washed with a mild detergent and rinsed with distilled water, then immersed in hydrofluoric acid solution for 2 min and rinsed with distilled water again. Raw MWCNTs (purity > 99.5%; average diameter 40–90 nm; length > 10 μm; Golden Innovation Business Co.) were refluxed in a mixed solution of sulfuric acid (98 wt%) and nitric acid (78 wt%) (volume ratio, 3:1) at 120 °C for 2 h to oxidize the graphitic sp2 carbon into the –COOH group on the sidewalls of the nanotubes. The oxidized MWCNTs were filtered by suction filtration, washed with deionized water, and dispersed in a mixed solution of acetone and ethanol (volume ratio, 1:1) by ultrasonication for 2 h. The aqueous MWCNT suspension (0.5 mg mL−1) was used for the electrophoresis experiment. A cleaned Ti foil and a Pt sheet (2 cm2) were used as a working electrode and a counter electrode, respectively. A constant potential of 18 V vs. open-circuit potential was employed for 15 s.18 Subsequently, the resultant MWCNT/Ti CE was dried at 50 °C for 10 min.The pulse potentiostatic electrodeposition of the NiS thin film onto the Ti foil substrate and the MWCNT/Ti foil substrate was carried out in aqueous solution containing 0.05 M NiCl2 (ARCOS, 99%) and 1.0 M thiourea, CH4N2S (ARCOS, 99%), using a Zahner electrochemical workstation (Zahner-Elektrik Gmbh & Co. KG, Germany) controlled by ZAHNER THALES software. The parameters for NiS/Ti and NiS/MWCNT/Ti CEs were set under a pulse-on potential of −0.9 V, a pulse-reversal potential of 0.1 V, a pulse-on period of 0.5 s, a pulse-reversal period of 1.5 s, and a total time duration of 30 s. A cleaned Ti foil substrate and a Pt wire were used as a working electrode and a counter electrode, respectively and a saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) was used as a reference electrode. The obtained NiS/Ti and NiS/MWCNT/Ti CEs were rinsed with distilled water and dried under a cool airflow. For comparison, an electrodeposited Pt/Ti CE was prepared according to our previous reports.21Assembly of DSSCsThe TiO2 colloid and the TiO2 film were prepared according to our previous reports.21,23 The resultant TiO2 film (thickness: 10 μm) was sensitized by immersing it in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye ([cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II)], Everlight Chemical Industry Co.) for 24 h, followed by air drying, thus a TiO2 photoanode was obtained. A DSSC was assembled by injecting an electrolyte consisting of 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazoliumiodine (Merck), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich), 0.15 M iodine (J.T. Baker), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (Aldrich) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (ACROS) into the aperture between the TiO2 photoanode and the counter electrode above. The two electrodes were clipped together and wrapped with thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn. The active area of the cell was 0.28 cm2.CharacterizationThe surface features of the CEs were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, JAPAN) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) attached to the FE-SEM. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the samples for the I3−/I− system was performed in a 3-methoxypropionitrile solution consisting of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a computer-controlled potentiostat (PGSTAT320N, Autolab) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell, the resultant CEs acted as the working electrode, a Pt-foil as the counter electrode and a Pt-wire as the reference electrode. The symmetric dummy cells were used for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The detailed procedure for the fabrication of the symmetric dummy cell was reported elsewhere.22,24 The EIS measurements were conducted by using the Zahner electrochemical workstation. The impedance studies were carried out simulating open-circuit conditions at an ambient atmosphere, and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 10−1 to ∼106 Hz with a zero bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude, under dark conditions. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed by using Z-view software. The redox electrolyte employed in EIS was the same as the DSSCs.Photovoltaic measurementsThe photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from a solar simulator (Yamashita Denso YSS-150A). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5).Results and discussionFig. 1 shows the FE-SEM images of the Ti foil, MWCNT/Ti, NiS/Ti, and NiS/MWCNT/Ti CEs, respectively. Detailed FE-SEM images for the above samples can be seen in Fig. S1.† Compared to the bare Ti foil (Fig. 1a), the MWCNTs deposited on the Ti foil substrate (MWCNT/Ti) show a fiber-like shape appearance (Fig. 1b), and the NiS deposited on the Ti foil substrate (NiS/Ti) shows a nano-corallines structure (Fig. 1c). To utilize the feature of high specific surface area from MWCNTs and improve the adhesion of MWCNTs on the Ti foil substrate, an NiS thin film was electrodeposited on the MWCNT/Ti surface (Fig. 1d). Remarkably, the original diameter of MWCNTs is about 90 nm. After the electrodeposition of NiS onto the MWCNTs, the diameter is increased to 180 nm, thus the thickness of the NiS film on the MWCNTs is about 45 nm. The EDS spectra in Fig. S2† illustrate that NiS is electrodeposited on the NiS/Ti or NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE. The MWCNT fiber network framework with an NiS rough surface endows the NiS/MWCNT/Ti electrode with a large specific surface area and favors the charge carrier transportation as well as the I3−/I− redox reaction. Fig. 1  FESEM images of Ti (a), MWCNT/Ti (b), NiS/Ti (c), and NiS/MWCNT/Ti (d) CEs, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the CVs for the Pt/Ti, MWCNT/Ti, NiS/Ti, and NiS/MWCNT/Ti CEs, respectively. The CVs show a pair of oxidation and reduction peaks, the redox pair is attributed to the reaction of I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−, which directly affects the DSSC performance.25 The reduction peak current density absolute value (Jpc) and the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) are two important parameters affecting catalytic activity.26 The Jpc values are in the order: NiS/MWCNT/Ti (3.24 mA cm−2) > NiS/Ti (2.38 mA cm−2) > Pt/Ti (1.63 mA cm−2) > MWCNT/Ti (shown in Table 1). However, a reduction peak is not found for the MWCNT/Ti CE in this potential interval, suggesting that the reduction reaction of I3− to I− on the MWCNT CE is obviously slower. The larger Jpc value means the faster reaction rate. On the other hand, the Epp values increase in the order: NiS/MWCNT/Ti (259 mV) < NiS/Ti (274 mV) < Pt/Ti (337 mV) (shown in Table 1), the smaller Epp means the smaller overpotential and better catalytic activity for I3−/I− reaction. According to the Jpc and Epp values, the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE has the highest electrocatalytic activity and conductivity compared to the other three CEs, which is due to the synergistic effect between NiS and MWCNTs.

The first semicircle at the high frequency region arises from the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) for the I3− reduction at the electrolyte/electrode interface, which represents the electrocatalytic performance of CEs. Table 1 presents the impedance parameters obtained from the Z-view software analyses of the EIS spectra. The RCT values for the NiS/Ti and NiS/MWCNT/Ti CEs are 0.86 and 0.74 Ω cm2, respectively, which are remarkably lower than that of the Pt/Ti CE (1.44 Ω cm2), indicating that NiS has superior electrocatalytic activity, and the introduction of MWCNTs further enhances the activity.27,28 Consequently, the overall impedance of the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE is smaller than those of other three CEs. This phenomenon is in accord with the FE-SEM and CV tests. Fig. 3  Nyquist plots of the symmetrical Pt/Ti (a), MWCNT/Ti (b), NiS/Ti (c), and NiS/MWCNT/Ti (d) CEs, respectively. The photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs based on different CEs were measured under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G); the resultant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. From Fig. 4a–d, all DSSCs have similar open circuit voltage (VOC) (750 mV) except for those using the MWCNT/Ti CE. This is because that these DSSCs have the same photoanode and electrolyte.2,4 The lower VOC for the MWCNT CE may be due to the adsorption of the electrolyte, like 4-tert-butylpyridine onto the carbon surface.29 Notably, the introduction of NiS on MWCNTs not only remarkably increases the short-current density (JSC) value but also improves the fill factor (FF) value. The increase in JSC for the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE results from its high conductivity and catalytic activity for the I3− reduction demonstrated by high Jpc and low Epp from the CV measurement.30,31 The improvement in FF can be attributed to the lower RS and RCT from the EIS tests.28,30,32 Although the performance of the DSSCs based on only NiS/Ti or MWNCT/Ti is lower, the synergistic effect combined the good conductivity and catalytic activity for NiS with the fiber network structure and large surface area for MWCNTs remarkably enhances the performance of the DSSCs based on the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE. Fig. S4† shows the possible catalytic mechanisms of MWCNTs, NiS, and NiS/MWCNT CEs toward I3− reduction during the operation of the DSSCs. Therefore, the DSSCs assembled with the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE exhibit a VOC of 753 mV, a JSC of 14.18 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.74, and a conversion efficiency (η) of 7.90%, which are superior to those based on the Pt CE (6.36%). Fig. 4  Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs based on the Pt/Ti (a), MWCNT/Ti (b), NiS/Ti (c), and NiS/MWCNT/Ti (d) CEs, respectively. Fig. 4a′–d′ show the dark current–voltage characteristics of the corresponding DSSCs. It is obvious that the dark current densities of all DSSCs are very low, which is because the Ti foil substrates have good resistance to the corrosive electrolyte.ConclusionsIn summary, MWCNTs were deposited on a Ti foil substrate by using electrophoresis, then, a NiS layer was deposited on the MWCNTs by using a pulse potentiostatic method. The resultant MWCNTs were uniformly wrapped with a nano-corallines NiS thin film in the thickness of about 45 nm. The characterization of CVs and EIS indicated that nano-corallines NiS had high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. MWCNTs possessed high specific surface area and good charge carrier transportation capacity and the synergistic effect of NiS and MWCNTs gave the NiS/MWCNT/Ti hybrid film CE excellent photoelectrochemical properties compared with Pt/Ti, MWCNT/Ti, and NiS/Ti CEs. Under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G), the DSSCs based on the NiS/MWCNT/Ti CE achieved a light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 7.90%, which was higher than the DSSCs based on the Pt/Ti CE (6.39%). This study provided a low-cost and high performance Pt-free CE material of NiS/MWCNT/Ti and an advanced synthesis method combining an electrophoresis and a pulse potentiostatic technique, which should accelerate the development of DSSCs.AcknowledgementsThe authors acknowledge the financial joint support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos 90922028, U1205112, and 51002053), the specialized research fund for the doctoral program of Higher University, Ministry of Education, China (no. 20123501110001), Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Program (No. 2011H2002), Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Support Program (No. BE2011163), and the Science Council in Taiwan (no.
