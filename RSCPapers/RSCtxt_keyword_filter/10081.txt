    , Accepted 25th May 2014First published on 28th May 2014AbstractA series of new fluorene-bridged organic dyes with di-anchoring groups have been synthesized and well characterized. Such a molecular design strategy using two organic anchors inhibits the undesirable charge recombination and prolongs the electron lifetime which results in significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (η). These findings were supported by the results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD). Under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the best dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) exhibits a high η of 6.11% without the need for co-adsorbent addition. An open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.753 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (ff) of 0.725 were measured in such co-adsorbent-free cells. The high Voc value is mainly attributed to the improved electron lifetime (τn) and high resistance to the recombination of electrons (Rrec) of 422.38 Ω.
Introduction
There is an urgent need to develop effective renewable energy alternatives for power generation to deal with the energy crisis because of the increasing demand of energy and the limited petroleum sources.1–9 Among several new energy technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their mechanical flexibility, relatively low production cost and high solar cell performance.10–19 Until now, power conversion efficiencies (η) greater than 11% have been achieved with ruthenium(II) polypyridyl sensitizers such as N719 (ref. 20 and 21) and N3 (ref. 22) and the efficiency can reach over 12% recently by using zinc porphyrin23 under an AM 1.5 simulator. Apart from these, metal-free organic photosensitizers have drawn much attention because they have high molar absorption coefficients, low synthetic cost and their structures can be modified easily.24 Their photophysical and electrochemical properties can be fine-tuned conveniently since the variation of organic molecular structures provides infinite possibilities. Therefore, metal-free photosensitizers are favorable candidates for the optimization of DSSC performance.
To date, most of the efficient organic dyes are based on the rod-like configuration with one anchoring group.25 However, the traditional dyes containing a mono-anchoring unit with a simple D–π–A structure are believed to cause undesirable dye aggregation and charge recombination.26 It is because the rod-shaped structures provide close π–π stacking of the dye molecules which may lead to serious self-quenching of excitons and hence reduces the possibility of efficient charge injection.27a To deal with this problem, some research groups have reported the synthesis of dyes with di-anchoring capability for DSSCs in order to suppress the charge recombination for better solar cell performance.27b–27f However, all these attempts were made with little success so far, as the η values achieved using di-anchoring organic dyes are lower than those with one anchoring group in many cases, where it was found that the photosensitizers with two anchoring groups suffer from more serious charge recombination with lower open-circuit photovoltage (Voc).28,29 In order to improve the overall cell performance of the DSSCs, there are some successful cases by using di-anchoring organic dyes with bridging groups to link up two identical D–π–A chains.30 After introduction of the bridging unit, not only the charge recombination can be suppressed to improve the Voc, but also the dye aggregation can be minimized by virtue of the non-planar conformation, and hence the overall η can be greatly ameliorated in the absence of any co-adsorbent.30 Therefore, such a new design of di-anchoring organic dyes with bridging aromatic units becomes a useful direction for the optimization of dye structures.
In this study, four novel di-anchoring organic photosensitizing dyes DA-1 to DA-4 with a fluorene unit bridging two identical D–π–A chains were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). Rod-like D–π–A analogous dyes with mono-anchoring groups TPS-1 and TPS-2 were also synthesized for comparison and our experimental results showed that the dyes with a bridging unit produced significantly higher values of Voc. The new dyes suppressed the charge recombination successfully which has been verified by an open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The results also indicated that the fluorene unit is a promising bridge for an organic di-anchoring photosensitizer because of the presence of two long alkyl chains which can improve the solubility of the dyes and suppress the undesirable dye aggregation. The photophysical and electrochemical properties, EIS studies in the dark and OCVD measurements have been investigated in detail to clarify the factors affecting the η of DSSCs.

Experimental
Materials and reagents
All the reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were dried using a standard procedure and distilled prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification. All the reagents for the chemical syntheses were purchased from Aldrich or Acros Organics. All the reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Merck pre-coated glass plates. Column chromatography was carried out using a silica gel from Merck (230–400 mesh). The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded on an Autoflex Bruker MALDI-TOF system. NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 or d6-DMSO on a Bruker AM 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer and chemical shifts were quoted relative to Me4Si standard for 1H and 13C nuclei. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained with a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained with a CH Instrument CV.
Computational details
The geometries of the compounds were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set. There are no imaginary frequencies for all optimized structures. All these calculations were performed using Gaussian 09W.31
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
All the anode films for the DSSCs were made under the same standard conditions. The anode is composed of a 12 μm thick transparent layer of TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm and a 6 μm thick scattering layer (diameter of the TiO2 nanoparticle at around 200 nm). A doctor-blade technique was utilized to produce photoanode films.
Briefly, transparent conducting glass (SnO2:F, FTO glass, ∼15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by sonication in ethanol, followed by acetone and deionized water for 20 min during each washing step. Then, a layer of ∼6 μm TiO2 paste (20 nm) was doctor-bladed onto the TiF4-treated FTO conducting glass, and then relaxed at room temperature for 3 min before heating at 150 °C for 6 min. This procedure was repeated once again to blade one more layer for achieving a film thickness of ∼12 μm. The resulting surface was finally coated with a scattering layer (∼6 μm) of 200 nm TiO2 paste. The electrodes were gradually heated to 480 °C under a hot air flow, and at 480 °C for 30 min to generate a three-dimensional TiO2 nanoparticle network. Following that, the sintered films were soaked into 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 45 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to around 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed into a 0.5 mM dye bath in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) for each dye for 18 h under dark conditions. After the immersion process, the electrodes were rinsed in ethanol and acetonitrile to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and then dried in air. Platinum counter electrodes were prepared by the sputtering method at 15 mA for 90 s at a power of 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were predrilled on the counter electrodes for introducing the electrolyte. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt parafilm at about 100 °C. The liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI and 0.05 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine (volume ratio, 1:1) was introduced into the cell through the drilled holes. Finally, the holes were sealed to prevent leakage of the electrolyte. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were ∼0.20 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were measured using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from a solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCEs of DSSCs were recorded in a Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) using DC mode. A CHI 660D electrochemical workstation was used to characterize the electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded under dark conditions over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, and the parameters were calculated using Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner AssociatNe, Inc.). For the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the cell was first illuminated for 20 s to achieve a steady voltage, and then the illumination was turned off for 80 s and the OCVD curve was obtained.
General synthetic procedures for di-aldehyde precursors (5a–5d)
A mixture of dibrominated compounds 2a–2b/4a–4b, 2.5 equivalents of 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-2-boronic acid, Pd(PPh3)4 and 2 M K2CO3 in toluene:ethanol (3:1, v:v) solution was heated to 90 °C overnight. After that, the solvent was removed and purified by column chromatography on a silica gel using CH2Cl2 as an eluent to afford the di-aldehyde precursors 5a–5d as orange solids.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
A novel class of di-anchoring organic dyes has been synthesized from the precursors with two aldehyde groups. The synthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 1. The dyes are mainly based on a bridging fluorene unit connecting two identical D–π–A chromophores. The cyanacrylic acid groups function as an electron acceptor and an anchoring group for holding strongly to the TiO2 film. The dyes were synthesized first by alkylation between dibromofluorene and 1-bromooctane or 2-ethylhexyl bromide to give dialkylated fluorene precursors with different chain features (straight and branched chains). They then reacted with 4-(N-phenyl-N-p-tolylamino)phenylboronic acid to form compounds 1a–1b which were important intermediates for further reactions. Following this, compounds 1a–1b were brominated by exactly two molar equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to give 2a–2b which then underwent Suzuki coupling with 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-2-boronic acid to form 5a–5b. On the other hand, additional thiophene rings were added by another Suzuki coupling sequence between thiophen-2-yl-2-boronic acid and 2a–2b to form 3a–3b. After subsequent bromination and coupling with 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-2-boronic acid, 5c–5d were formed. For the final step, the precursors 5a–5d reacted with 2-cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate in refluxing acetic acid to obtain the desired dyes (DA-1 to DA-4) in very high yields (>90%). Rod-like dyes TPS-1 and TPS-2 were also synthesized similarly for comparison purposes.

All of the new dyes have been characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. After the conversion of aldehyde to cyanoacetic acid, the singlet NMR peak of the aldehyde in the very downfield region (∼10 ppm) disappeared in their NMR spectra while a singlet resonance peak of CCH was observed at about 8.5 ppm.
Photophysical properties
In this study, four novel fluorene-bridged organic dyes with di-anchoring groups were prepared and their photophysical properties were compared to those of their corresponding rod-like D–π–A dyes containing a single anchor TPS-1 and TPS-2. The absorption spectra of the dyes DA-1–DA-4 in THF at room temperature are shown in Fig. 2 and the data are summarized in Table 1. Basically, all of the dyes showed two distinct absorption bands. For the bridged compounds DA-1–DA-4, one band at around 350–400 nm should be attributed to the π–π* transition and the other band at 450–550 nm is caused by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor unit to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor moiety to produce an efficient charge-separated state. For the compounds TPS-1 and TPS-2, the spectra are quite similar to the di-anchoring dyes apart from the fact that they have relatively stronger ICT bands than the π–π* transition bands. After the introduction of the fluorene unit, the intensity of π–π* transitions increases significantly and becomes stronger relative to their ICT bands. Remarkably, the increasing number of thiophene rings on the D–π–A system shifts the ICT bands toward the red side. This indicates that the light harvesting ability of the dye molecules can be simply improved by structural modification which includes extending the π-conjugation by increasing the number of thiophene rings and introduction of the π-bridge. All the dyes exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (20000–70000 M−1cm−1) which are higher than those of the standard ruthenium dyes N3 and N719 (13900 and 14000 M−1cm−1, respectively).22 Although DA-1 and DA-2 have much larger molecular size than TPS1 (Table 1), the dye loading amounts on TiO2 are similar for both dyes. Therefore, more compact dye layers for the di-anchoring dyes are formed on the TiO2 surface.30 Furthermore, since DA-3 and DA-4 have one more thiophene ring than DA-1 and DA-2, the dye loading amounts for the dyes with larger size are slightly lower.

Electrochemical properties
The HOMO–LUMO level is an important parameter for a DSSC system since it represents the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conductive band (Ecb) of TiO2 and the dye regeneration. A conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode and Pt-wires as the counter and reference electrodes was used. Cyclic voltammetry of the dye molecules was performed in the THF solution on the glassy carbon electrode containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in order to investigate their electrochemical properties. Under these conditions, the E1/2 of ferrocene was 0.07 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The oxidation potential (Eox) was used to calculate the HOMO energy level while the LUMO can be calculated from the reduction potential (Ered). All the LUMO levels of the dyes are within −2.85 to −3.09 eV. These values are much higher than the energy level of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.4 eV) which ensure efficient charge injection from the excited sensitizer molecule to the TiO2 conduction band.32,33 While the HOMO levels of all the photosensitizers are in the range of −5.19 to −5.25 eV, these values are lower than the energy level of redox couple I−/I−3 in the electrolyte (−4.9 eV), which provide ample driving force for efficient dye regeneration to complete the circuit and restore the dyes.34 Noticeably, the band gaps of the dyes with one more thiophene ring in DA-3, DA-4 and TPS-2 are narrower than those of DA-1, DA-2 and TPS-1 as their HOMO levels are significantly increased because of the effective electronic π-conjugation extension. The electrochemical properties of all the dyes are summarized in Table 2.

Computational studies
The ground state geometries of the dyes DA-1 to DA-4 were optimized using the DFT method (Fig. 3). From the results, we observed that the triarylamine moiety takes a propeller geometry and the cyanoacrylic acid is coplanar with the thienyl moiety. The UV/Vis absorption profiles of the dyes were also calculated using the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method based on the optimized ground state geometry. The calculated absorption wavelength of DA-1 is 447 nm (versus 470 nm from the experiment), whereas the calculated absorption wavelength of DA-3 is 507 nm (versus 473 nm from the experiment). The calculations successfully predicted the red-shift of the absorption on increasing the number of thienyl units for the compounds. The same results were calculated for DA-2 and DA-4.

On the other hand, the electrons in the HOMO of the compounds are distributed over the electron-donating moiety, i.e. the triphenylamine fragment. Conversely, the LUMO of the compounds showed that electrons are distributed over the cyanoacrylic acid moiety of the dyes. TDDFT calculations on DA-1 indicated that HOMO → LUMO and HOMO − 1 → LUMO + 1 are the major components of the S0 → S1 transition. Similar results were found for other dyes. This is favorable to the photo-induced electron injection into the TiO2 semiconductor. Furthermore, we found that the thienyl moiety is a π-conjugated linker for the triphenylamine part and the cyanoacrylic acid moiety because the thienyl moieties are involved in the frontier molecular orbitals.
It was also shown that the energy levels of the LUMOs of the compounds are dependent on the number of thienyl rings in the compounds, whereas the energy levels of the HOMOs are not affected significantly by the number of thienyl units which are consistent with the CV results. For example, the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of DA-1 and DA-3 are −5.04 eV and −2.68 eV; −5.09 eV and −2.95 eV, respectively. The decrease of the energy level of LUMO for DA-3 can be attributed to the more extended delocalization of electrons in the LUMO of DA-3 as compared to DA-1.
Photovoltaic performance
All the dyes have been applied for the fabrication of DSSCs and the fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental Section. All the DSSCs were tested under the same conditions in order to make a reasonable and reliable comparison for investigating the effect of introducing the bridging aromatic unit. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves are illustrated in Fig. 4. Among all the dyes, the DSSCs based on DA-1 showed the best performance and the η can reach up to 6.11% which is much higher than its corresponding non-bridged dye TPS-1 (4.65%). Other cells with DA-2, DA-3 and DA-4 also exhibited good performances with an η of 5.94%, 6.05% and 5.88%, respectively (versus 7.91% for N719 under the same experimental conditions). It was found that all of the fluorene-bridged dyes gave higher Voc values than those of the non-bridged dyes. This can probably be assigned to the reduced charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface by insulation of the dyes with a non-planar di-anchoring structure and the presence of alkyl chains on the fluorene unit. The EIS study can further verify this observation based on the Voc difference which will be discussed later. Moreover, although increasing the number of thiophene rings in the π-bridge would increase the light harvesting ability and raise up the photocurrent, the Voc value decreased. This is probably due to the relatively larger molecular size of DA-3 and DA-4, which would reduce the dye-loading on TiO2. Therefore, DA-3 and DA-4 show a slight drop in η as compared to DA-1 and DA-2. All of the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 3.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves for these dyes in DSSCs are plotted in Fig. 5. The IPCEs of DA-1, DA-2 and TPS-1 dyes show a band in the region of 300–620 nm with values mostly between 55 and 60% and those of DA-3, DA-4 and TPS-2 with one more thiophene unit display a broader and red-shifted band but with slightly lower IPCE values of 40–50%. It is interesting that TPS-1 shows a slightly higher IPCE value at around 420 nm than the corresponding bridged-dyes DA-1 and DA-2. However, as the spectral responses of DA-1 and DA-2 extend further to the longer wavelength, there is still a gain in the photocurrent which boosts up the overall η of the devices based on DA-1 and DA-2. In addition, the VOC values of the DA-1 and DA-2 cells are much higher than that of the TPS-1 cell, which can also be explained by the different rates of undesirable charge recombination through the dyes and this will be elucidated by the EIS studies (vide infra). As a result, both DA-1 and DA-2 (6.11% and 5.94%) exhibit significant enhancement in η when compared with TPS-1 (4.65%).
 Fig. 5  IPCE curves of DSSCs based on DA-1–DA-4, TPS-1 and TPS-2. 
To gain more insight into DSSC properties, EIS was performed to study the interfacial charge recombination process in DSSCs based on these dyes under dark conditions at an applied voltage of −0.7 V. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the radius of the semicircle represents the charge recombination resistance between the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and I−3 in the redox mediator. The larger the resistance value (Rrec), the slower the recombination rate.35 It was clearly observed that the devices based on fluorene-bridged dyes DA-1 (422 Ω), DA-2 (379 Ω), DA-3 (194.08 Ω) and DA-4 (203 Ω) have dramatically higher Rrec values than the non-bridged dyes TPS-1 (48 Ω) and TPS-2 (42 Ω), which is most likely due to the design of a double channel bridge structure that blocks the area of direct contact between TiO2 and the electrolyte. The Rrec results are also consistent with the measured Voc values of DSSCs using the corresponding dyes. Therefore, the EIS study confirms the positive effect from these novel molecular structures with a fluorene bridge. Besides, we found that after extending the thiophene π-conjugation length, the relatively bulky molecules will decrease the recombination resistance value. It can be understood as smaller molecules adopt dense packing on the nanoparticle surface.36 Therefore, DA-3 and DA-4 with one more thiophene unit show lower Voc and η values.
 Fig. 6  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on all the dyes and N719 under dark conditions. 
To further probe the recombination kinetics of the devices, OCVD was recorded to illustrate the electron lifetime (which is deduced from the Voc decaying from a steady state to dark equilibrium37). Fig. 7 shows the OCVD profiles of the devices based on our dyes. The correlation between Voc decay and electron lifetime (τn) can be described by the following equation:  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the electron charge. According to this equation, the electron lifetimes of the devices can be extracted from the slope of the photovoltage decay curves.37,38 For the devices sensitized with bridged dyes DA-1–DA-4, the slopes are obviously less steep than those of the non-bridged dyes TPS-1 and TPS-2. Therefore, electron lifetimes can be enhanced by the structural modification with a fluorene bridge. After this useful medication, the electron lifetimes of these dyes observed by OCVD are all longer than the standard N719 dye. The investigation of these dyes by EIS and OCVD supports the advantage of using this kind of di-anchoring structure and this design opens up a new promising direction for the development of organic dye molecules for DSSC applications.
 Fig. 7  OCVD profiles of DSSCs based on all the new dyes and N719. 
Generally, the performance of organic-based DSSCs can be improved by the addition of a co-adsorbent and much higher photovoltaic efficiency can be achieved in the majority of cases.39 It is generally believed that the co-adsorbent can prevent aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 surface. In order to probe the effect of co-adsorbent on our DSSC performance, we selected DA-1 and DA-3 as photosensitizers in fabricating co-adsorbent-based DSSCs, in which deoxycholic acid (DCA) was applied during the sensitization process. It was found that the Jsc of these dyes dramatically decreases with the addition of DCA, whereas Voc and ff remained almost the same, giving a correspondingly lower η of 5.04% and 5.99%, respectively, for DA-1 and DA-3 (Table 3). These results indicated that the addition of DCA is not beneficial for our dyes to enhance the photovoltaic performance. The addition of DCA, on the other hand, may decrease the loading amount of our dyes on TiO2, resulting in a loss of light-harvesting ability of the device. Therefore, the work here suggests that the configuration of our di-anchoring dyes would prevent themselves to be aggregated on TiO2 even under the co-adsorbent-free condition.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of new di-anchoring organic dyes containing a fluorene bridge have been synthesized and characterized. This molecular design strategy can significantly enhance the η value because this successfully inhibits the undesirable charge combination and prolongs the electron lifetime. These have been supported by the detailed EIS and OCVD studies. Furthermore, we found that extending the thiophene π-conjugation length can increase Jsc values but decrease Voc values since these relatively bulky molecules will decrease the recombination resistance value. Under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), the DSSC based on dye DA-1 exhibits a high η of 6.11% without the need for a co-adsorbent. The high efficiency is mainly attributed to the improved electron lifetime/high resistance to recombination and reduction of the dye aggregation. These findings open up a new avenue to the development of organic photosensitizers and the optimization of di-anchoring organic dyes for highly efficient DSSCs.
