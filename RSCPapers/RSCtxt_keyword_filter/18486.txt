However, three-dimensional (3D) cesium lead iodide forms an undesirable non-perovskite structure with a wide bandgap at ambient atmosphere. Herein, dimension engineering is employed by introducing a bulky ammonium cation to form stable 2D cesium lead iodide perovskite BA2CsPb2I7 (BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3), which not only exhibits prominent optoelectronic properties, but also possesses superior structural and compositional stability to 3D CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 under the pressure of heat and humidity. The current 2D BA2CsPb2I7 shows excellent stability after exposure to 30% relative humidity for 30 days or upon heating at 85 °C for 3 days. In addition, the corresponding BA2CsPb2I7 based planar perovskite solar cells retain 92% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after aging for over 30 days without any encapsulation, demonstrating the up-scalability of 2D perovskite compounds as stable and efficient light-absorbing materials for perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
In the past few years, the organometal trihalide perovskite family has witnessed a spectacular surge in scientific interest and achieved revolutionary accomplishments in the field of photovoltaic devices, owing to its salient optical and electrical properties: prominent absorption throughout the entire visible spectrum,1 long diffusion lengths in the micrometer range,2 long carrier lifetime,3etc. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been propelled from nascent 3.8%4 to a striking record of 22.1%.5 Although superb progress has been achieved in efficiency,6–9 the instability issues such as phase transition, thermal stability, and moisture-related degradation of hybrid perovskite still remained as a bottleneck hampering its future commercial application. For instance, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) has been reported with a reversible phase change from a tetragonal to cubic phase at 55 °C while it thermally degrades to lead iodide at a temperature of 85 °C.10,11 Moreover, the humidity sensitivity of hybrid perovskite also leads to its decomposition into lead halide.12,13 To improve the stability of PSCs, some strategies like introducing additives,14 optimizing the device architecture15,16 and modifying the device interface17,18 have been demonstrated. However, the intrinsic compositional or structural instability of the MAPbI3 perovskite itself has still remained, which might leave a hidden peril for long-term application.
In contrast to the three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, MAPbI3 based layered 2D perovskite films have demonstrated promising humidity resistance.19–21 Layered perovskite can be deemed as structural derivatives from 3D perovskite confined in two dimensions with a steric effect.22 Such 2D perovskite enhances the humidity stability of perovskite via the van der Waals interactions between bulky organic molecules.21 Nevertheless, the emergence of the PbI2 phase has been observed when methylammonium lead iodide based layered 2D perovskite films were exposed to 80 °C for 15 hours,23 revealing that the thermal stability of MAPbX3 needs to be further improved.
Recently, substituting the methylammonium cation with a cesium ion has been successfully demonstrated to accomplish superb thermal stability for lead halide perovskite.24,25 For instance, CsPbI3 perovskite with a desirable bandgap of 1.73 eV has been proved to possess remarkable thermal resistance with no decomposition observed up to the melting points exceeding 460 °C.24 Unfortunately, the CsPbI3 perovskite phase usually forms at high temperature (>330 °C) which transforms back to the non-perovskite phase with a wide bandgap of 2.75 eV after cooling down to ambient atmosphere,26,27 therefore fabricating CsPbI3 perovskite based solar cells that are stable at room temperature is still challenging.
To solve such problems, several approaches have been attempted in recent reports, which however, brought little effect. For instance, although utilizing HI addition could successfully decrease the phase transition temperature of CsPbI3 to 100 °C and achieve a corresponding PCE of 2.9%, the black phase reverts to the yellow phase immediately after exposure to air.26 Halide mixing has also been explored to stabilize the perovskite phase, however, such halide-mixed cesium perovskites (CsPbI3−xBrx) still require a high temperature annealing process (∼250 °C),28,29 produce poor film morphology, and encounter phase instability after subjecting to air for several days.24 Very recently, CsPbI3 nanocrystals have been explored to stabilize the perovskite phase, based on which efficient solar cells have been achieved.30
Herein, dimension engineering is developed as a novel strategy to transform 3D CsPbI3 into stable layered cesium lead iodide perovskite by introducing a butyl ammonium cation. The low temperature synthesized 2D cesium lead iodide perovskite (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2CsPb2I7 (abbreviated as BA2CsPb2I7) inherits both the properties of 3D CsPbI3 and 2D BA2PbI4, such as possessing superior thermal stability and achieving a high quality film without the assistance of an anti-solvent process. Further characterizations demonstrate a good maintenance of the stable perovskite structure for BA2CsPb2I7 after exposure to 30% relative humidity for 30 days, meanwhile no decomposition process was observed upon heating at 85 °C for 3 days. A PCE of 4.84% is obtained by employing BA2CsPb2I7 as the light absorber, and retains 92% of the initial PCE after aging for over 30 days without any encapsulation.
Experimental
Materials preparation
For the synthesis of (n-CH3(CH2)3NH3)2PbI4 powder, PbI2 was dissolved into aqueous HI solution at 70 °C with stirring and n-CH3(CH2)3NH3 (BA) was subsequently added. The hot solution was left to cool down to room temperature during which time orange powder crystals started to precipitate. The crystals were collected by filtration and washed with cold diethyl ether before being dried overnight. CH3NH3I was synthesized by blending methylamine (MA, 33 wt% in methanol) and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% aqueous) stirring in an ice-water bath for 2 h, and crystallized by evaporating the solvent and purified by recrystallization with diethyl ether before drying in a vacuum. MAPbI3 films were obtained by spin-coating the precursor solution containing MAI and PbCl2 (with a molar ratio of 3:1) and annealing at 95 °C for 2 h. And equimolar quantities of CsI and PbI2 were dissolved in DMSO, which was spin-coated and annealed at 350 °C for 15 minutes to get a black phase CsPbI3.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1) was pretreated with 4 M HCl and zinc powder, followed by ultrasonic cleaning in deionized water, alcohol, and acetone successively. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on pre-cleaned FTO by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s using a TiO2 colloidal solution prepared according to our previous report,31 which was then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The annealed TiO2 coated substrates were immersed in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes before sintering at 500 °C for 30 minutes. A 2D perovskite BA2CsPb2I7 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar quantities of BA2PbI4, CsI and PbI2 to a concentration of 0.5 M in DMSO, which was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. As for nonperovskite CsPbI3 (or BA2PbI4) films, CsI and PbI2 (or BA2PbI4) were dissolved in DMSO and spin-coated on the TiO2 substrate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The hole transporting material (HTM) solution containing 73.2 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/chlorobenzene with addition of 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSi) solution (520 mg in acetonitrile) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the metal electrode was deposited by magnetron sputtering gold through a metal mask to afford an effective active area of 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a RigakuCo. X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The absorption spectra were characterized with a UV-3600. Photoluminescence (PL, excitation at 365 nm) was measured with Edinburgh Instruments LTD (FLSP920). The morphologies, elemental distribution and elemental analysis of the sample were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM and EDS, SU8010). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was performed with a Bruker (dimension fastscan bio). Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was performed with a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells was recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a NREL standard Si solar cell). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter as a function of wavelength from 380 nm to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded by using an electrochemical workstation (type) with a frequency range from 1 kHz to 2 MHz, applying a bias voltage of 1 V in the dark.
Results and discussion
Material characterization
The 2D BA2CsPb2I7 was prepared by one-step spin-coating of a precursor solution containing equivalent BA2PbI4, CsI and PbI2. Details of the synthesis are presented in the experimental section. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of powder BA2CsPb2I7 is shown in Fig. S1,† where diffraction peaks in the low degree resulting from the large plane spacing are clearly observed, indicating the formation of low-dimension perovskite. The elemental mapping spectrum (shown in Fig. S2†) exhibits a homogeneous distribution of C and Cs throughout the film without apparent phase segregation. Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, shown in Fig. S3†) result reveals that the Cs:Pb:I atomic ratio (Table S1†) of the BA2CsPb2I7 perovskite film is in agreement with the theoretical values. Fig. 1a displays the XRD patterns of the as-prepared BA2CsPb2I7 film in comparison with that of perovskite CsPbI3 (abbreviated as p-CsPbI3) and BA2PbI4. Since the p-CsPbI3 film transforms immediately upon exposure to ambient atmosphere, the XRD pattern shown here corresponds to the calculation result of perovskite CsPbI3.32 It is noteworthy that 2D perovskite exhibits a highly preferable growth orientation during the film formation.

According to the diagrammatic structure described in Fig. 1b, the bulky ammonium cation (BA cation) tends to confine the perovskite's growth orientation parallel to the substrate, indicating the strongest diffraction peak of BA2PbI4 located at the low diffraction degree resulting from the steric effect.19,33 In contrast, the Cs ion prefers to expand the crystal orientation outside and thus a 3D structure was fabricated in the case of p-CsPbI3. As for BA2CsPb2I7, a competition between BA and Cs exists, and since the strongest peak is located more close to the peaks of p-CsPbI3 rather than BA2PbI4 (shown in Fig. 1a), the growth orientation of BA2CsPb2I7 is more inclined along the vertical direction on the substrate. Such vertical growth facilitates charge transport along Pb–I–Pb in the perpendicular direction,33 which is beneficial for the performance of the PSC.
Change in the dimensionality of the perovskite also gives rise to variation in the optical properties,33 as displayed in Fig. 2. The band gaps of p-CsPbI3 and BA2PbI4 are 1.7 eV and 2.3 eV according to their absorption spectra (UV-vis, Fig. 2a), meanwhile their corresponding fluorescence (PL) peaks (Fig. 2b) are situated at 710 nm and 525 nm. The bandgap energy of BA2PbI4 lies between the above two and calculated to be 2.2 eV, similar to the value reported for 2D perovskite derived from MAPbI3.19 In addition, the slight absorption shoulders observed at 520 nm, 590 nm, 690 nm, similar to their respective PL emission peaks, should be ascribed to the formation of defect layers within the structure which was typically found in the 2D perovskite materials.20,34 For comparison, non-perovskite CsPbI3 (n-CsPbI3) was tested in the same batch, showing a wide band gap of 2.7 eV and a broad PL emission peak caused by the formation of self-trapped excitons (seen in Fig. S4†),35 which is adverse to efficient exciton dissociation and carrier collection by the electrode. Thus, according to the UV-vis and PL spectra, the synthesized 2D BA2CsPb2I7 perovskite has proved preferable photoelectric properties, such as a suitable bandgap, better light harvesting ability and less charge recombination traps, which are of pivotal importance for high-performance PSCs.

Long-term stability tests
To elucidate the better structural and compositional stability of BA2CsPb2I7 under humidity and thermal pressure, the durability tests of p-CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 thin films were also conducted. The characteristic XRD peaks in XRD patterns located at 14.2° and 21.1° (Fig. 3a) are indexed to the (100) and (110) crystal planes of the p-CsPbI3, which disappeared after exposure to air (relative humidity 30%) for 30 minutes, while the characteristic peaks of n-CsPbI3 situated at 9.7° and 13.2° were clearly detected, indicating an extreme instability for black CsPbI3 perovskite at ambient atmosphere. In contrast, the XRD patterns of BA2CsPb2I7 after aging under the same conditions exhibit no emerging peaks produced by degradation or phase transition (Fig. 3b), which can be further proved by no color change occurring in the films, as described in the inset photographs in Fig. 3b. Moreover, the absorption spectra of the aged sample also reveal to be approximately constant for a prolonged period, indicating the impressive stability of BA2CsPb2I7 in air, as displayed in Fig. S5.† Considering that the operation temperature of perovskite devices can reach 50–70 °C, thermal stability is also of critical importance for solar-cell materials. In order to assess the thermal stability of BA2CsPb2I7, films were placed on a heating plate at 85 °C for a prolonged time. As displayed in Fig. 3c, the control sample MAPbI3 has already begun to decompose within 24 h, with a peak at 12.7° assigned to PbI2 being detected, resulting from the release of MAI. Moreover, the signal intensity of the PbI2 was gradually enhanced when prolonging the heating time, revealing the ongoing decomposition of MAPbI3.

In contrast, the XRD patterns (Fig. 3d) obtained after heating BA2CsPb2I7 at 85 °C for 72 h have still affirmed its compositional integrity, without appearance of any apparent new phase. Overall, it is confirmed that 2D BA2CsPb2I7 possesses much superior structural and compositional stability upon exposure to the ambient atmosphere or heating stress, which is further corroborated when comparing with the published cesium lead iodide results (details are summarized in Table S3†). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that employs a bulky ammonium cation to stabilize the perovskite structure of cesium lead iodide. The current 2D BA2CsPb2I7 not only dramatically lowers the phase transition temperature of CsPbI3 from nonperovskite to perovskite but also successfully achieves an impressively superior stability under humidity and heat stress.
Photovoltaic performance
To gain better insight into the suitability of the as-prepared BA2CsPb2I7 in photovoltaic applications, the valence band (VB) was measured as −5.4 eV with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Fig. S6†), meanwhile the corresponding conduction band (CB) minimum was determined to be −3.2 eV by subtracting the VB from the bandgap energy. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, an appropriate energy bandgap of BA2CsPb2I7 theoretically enables the injection of electrons to TiO2 and the holes to spiro-OMeTAD, which sets the stage for the successful implementation in PSCs.

As shown in Fig. S7a,† it is worth noting that BA2CsPb2I7 can self-assemble into well-defined films via a simple one-step spin-coating method, getting rid of the complex anti-solvent process. By contrast, the 3D CsPbI3 film (Fig. S7b†) prepared by one-step spin-coating presents a poor morphology, which cannot fully cover the substrate. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) images (Fig. S7c and d†) indicate that the crystal size of the BA2CsPb2I7 film is about 1–3 μm, much larger than that of the CsPbI3 film (∼200 nm, as estimated from the inset image in Fig. S7d†). The root-mean square (RMS) roughness of the BA2CsPb2I7 film is 21.8 nm, which is five fold lower than that of CsPbI3 films (∼114 nm), indicating the uniform morphology and smooth surface of the former. Therefore, introducing butyl ammonium into the cesium lead iodide not only improves the film coverage but also enlarges the crystal size, both of which are key parameters to the performance of the solar cells. To optimize the device performance, versatility in the precursor concentration (0.4 to 1.0 M) has been demonstrated, attaining different film thicknesses from 200 nm to 1 μm (as shown in Fig. S8†), whose corresponding photovoltaic performances are presented in Table S2 and Fig. S9.† Obviously, the best performance device (shown in Fig. 4b) is achieved by using the 300 nm perovskite film (0.5 M), presenting a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 8.88 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 957 mV, a fill factor (FF) of 0.57 and thus a PCE of 4.84%, respectively. Thinner or thicker films both affect the device performance. In particular, a lower JSC is obtained in the case of 0.4 M, which should be ascribed to the great loss of light harvesting triggered by the thinner film. On the other hand, since a short carrier diffusion length (∼360 nm) has been testified in low-dimension perovskite,21 thicker films by increasing precursor solution will weigh against the efficient extraction of photo-generated carriers, resulting in a poor JSC and VOC ultimately. For comparison, the J–V curves of the devices based on n-CsPbI3 and BA2PbI4 (Fig. 4c) were also measured, achieving a PCE of 0.124% for BA2PbI4, with a JSC of 0.42 mA cm−2, VOC of 762 mV, and FF of 0.386, whereas obtaining a PCE of 0.112% for n-CsPbI3, with a JSC of 0.46 mA cm−2, VOC of 549 mV and FF of 0.44, respectively. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra displayed in Fig. 4d have also confirmed the superior photoelectric properties of 2D perovskite BA2CsPb2I7 to BA2PbI4 and n-CsPbI3, with a wider light absorption range and higher IPCE values. In particular, the BA2CsPb2I7 based device showed a high IPCE close to 75% in the range of 380–550 nm. Additionally, the integrated current density from the IPCE spectra of BA2CsPb2I7, CsPbI3 and BA2PbI4 based solar cells is 8.10, 0.43, and 0.39 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in accordance with the JSC extracted from J–V curves.
To further clarify the difference in the photovoltaic performance, the series resistance (Rs) and the shunt resistance (Rsh) were extracted from the J–V curves, as listed in Table 1.36 Remarkably, the Rs for BA2CsPb2I7 was 200 fold lower than that of n-CsPbI3 and BA2PbI4, which accounts for the higher JSC achieved for BA2CsPb2I7. Hence, prominent absorption along with a low charge resistance jointly affords a superior JSC. On the other hand, a larger Rsh was witnessed for BA2CsPb2I7 than the others, elucidating the obtained higher VOC of BA2CsPb2I7 devices with reduced carrier recombination. Hysteresis is also another factor needed to be considered when evaluating the PSC performance,37,38 since considerable errors will arise if there is a large discrepancy in the J–V response between different scans. As shown in Fig. S10,† the BA2CsPb2I7-based devices display negligible hysteresis when scanning from the forward and reverse directions.

Aging test of 2D BA2CsPb2I7 perovskite solar cells
It is perceived that long-term stability is another vital concern for promising perovskite solar cells. As presented in Fig. 5, the aging test of the corresponding devices was performed, showing a compelling 92% maintenance of the initial PCE for BA2CsPb2I7 solar cells after aging over 30 days without any encapsulation. Likewise, the detailed evolution of VOC, JSC and FF (displayed in Fig. 5a) also verified the superb stability of BA2CsPb2I7 based solar cells. In addition, further investigations of device stability for BA2CsPb2I7 have been demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Fig. 5b. In the Nyquist plots, the main arc is related to the recombination process (Rrec).39,40 The Rrec shows slight variations with ageing time (decreases from 301 to 290 Ω cm2 in 12 days and to 279 Ω cm2 in 30 days), indicating the superior stability of the device. Furthermore, the photo-stability of the BA2CsPb2I7 based device was analysed under constant light illumination without any encapsulation. As displayed in Fig. S11,† the BA2CsPb2I7-based solar cell maintains 91% of its initial PCE after 120 h constant illumination, indicating superior photo-stability due to the introduction of butyl ammonium.

Conclusions
In general, we have demonstrated that dimension engineering by introducing a bulky organic ammonium cation can be employed to stabilize the perovskite structure of cesium lead iodide. The as-prepared BA2CsPb2I7 exhibits a preferentially oriented growth direction perpendicular to the substrate and shows a uniform and well-defined morphology, favoring charge separation and transport. Such 2D BA2CsPb2I7 exhibits impressive stability when exposed to 30% RH and 25 °C over one month or to 85 °C thermal stress for 72 h, which is significantly better than that of the p-CsPbI3 and MAPbI3. A PCE of 4.84% is achieved utilizing BA2CsPb2I7 as an absorber in planar PSCs. The BA2CsPb2I7 based PSC maintains 92% of its initial PCE after aging under ambient conditions for 30 days without capsulation, thus demonstrating the up-scalability of 2D perovskite compounds as stable and efficient light-absorbing materials for perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic applications.
