    , Accepted 5th January 2011First published on 16th February 2011AbstractNew oligofluorene modified C60 derivatives were designed and synthesized viarhodium complex catalyzed direct coupling between C60 and oligofluorene boronic acids in H2O/1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:4). The product was first purified by silica gel column chromatography and then further purified by semipreparative HPLC equipped with a Buckyprep column using toluene as an eluent. The strong deep-blue fluorescence of the oligofluorene bridge was completely quenched after end-capped with C60, indicating an efficient energy and/or charge transfer between the π-conjugated bridge and the C60 cages. Cyclic voltammetric measurements show that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the synthesized C60 derivatives are similar to those of widely used PC61BM. This means that the energy levels of the C60 derivatives mainly depend on the π electron system of the C60 cage. However, the substituents have huge impacts on the other physical properties of the resulting C60 derivatives, such as solubility, crystallinity, and electron mobility.
Introduction
Organic solar cells based on conjugated polymers and soluble fullerene derivatives potentially offer low-cost solar electricity by using spin-coating, ink-jet printing, or roll-to-roll printing techniques to fabricate large-area photovoltaic devices on flexible and light-weight substrates.1 Recently, significant progress has been made in this field, and the power conversion efficiencies of solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells have reached 7–8% regime, primarily due to the development of high mobility low band gap p-type materials2 and better control of the nanostructured morphology of the interpenetrating electron donor/acceptor networks by using processing additives.3 In contrast to the intensive study on p-type materials, the design and synthesis of new fullerene derivatives for applications in solar cells as electron acceptors are relatively unexplored with most work focusing on the modification of PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester) derivatives.4

Fullerene derivatives have attracted significant attention as promising functional components in nanoelectronic devices due to their high electron affinity and mobility.5 A number of chemical reactions have been developed to attach organic functional groups to the fullerene skeletons, including cycloaddition and the addition of nucleophiles and free radicals.6 However, it is still pretty challenging to achieve selective monoaddition with wide-range functional group compatibility. Recently, Itami et al. reported an interesting Rh catalyzed arylation of C60 using organoboron compounds with good yield and high selectivity.7 Since organoboron compounds are readily prepared and compatible with a variety of organic functional groups, this fullerene chemistry opens a new avenue for the versatile functionalization of fullerenes with π-conjugated compounds. This prompted us to attach oligofluorenes to the C60 molecule as monodisperse oliogofluorenes possess promising optoelectronic properties and are widely used as electron-transporting blue emitters in light-emitting diodes.8 We investigated the effect of oligofluorene substituents on the energy levels of the resultant fullerene derivatives. In addition, we also designed and synthesized an oligofluorene bridged C60 dimer with an intention to lower its LUMO energy level to match with some low band gap polymers with low-lying LUMO levels (below 3.9 eV).
In this paper, we report on the detailed synthesis and properties of oligofluorene modified C60 derivatives for potential applications in organic electronic devices. We found that oligofluorene substituents had little impact on the energy levels of the C60 derivatives because the conjugation between the oligofluorene bridge and the π-electron system of C60 was disrupted by a sp3 hybridized carbon. Initial study showed that a power conversion efficiency of 2.3% was obtained when blending the synthesized C60 derivative (C60F) 1 with a p-type poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative (PCDTBT) as the photovoltaic active layer. The efficiency was further improved to 3.4% by using the mixture of C60F and PC61BM (1:1) as the electron acceptor.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and Fisher Chemicals. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was distilled over sodium/benzophenone under Ar prior to use. Poly[N-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) was provided by St-Jean Photochemicals, Québec, Canada. 9,9-Dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid, and 2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene were prepared according to our previous procedures.9 The rhodium catalyst, bis(acetonitrile)(cyclo-octa-1,5-diene)rhodium tetrafluoroborate ([Rh(COD)(MeCN)2]BF4), was synthesized according to literature procedures.10NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as internal references. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer and fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Spex Fluorolog 3 spectrometer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of fullerene derivatives was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere on a TA Instruments DSC 2920 at heating rates of 10 °C min−1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed on a Waters model 515 equipped with a Cosmosil Buckyprep column (10.0 mm × 250 mm, Nacalai USA) using toluene as an eluent.
Synthesis of 1-(9,9-dibutylfluoren-2-yl)-1,9-dihydro[60]fullerene 1 (C60F)
To a 100 mL two-necked flask equipped with a short condenser were added C60 (216 mg, 0.3 mmol) and 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid (66 mg, 0.2 mmol). The flask was evacuated and filled with argon 3 times to remove traces of air. Rh(COD)(MeCN)2]BF4 (22 mg, 0.058 mmol) was then added into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. In another 100 mL flask, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (35 mL) and water (9 mL) were added. The resulting solvent mixture was degassed and then transferred to the reaction flask via a syringe. The reaction flask was again evacuated and filled with argon once more. The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C under argon. After stirring for 5 h, the second batch of 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid (40 mg, 0.12 mmol) in degassed 1,2-dichlorobenzene (4 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was further stirred for another 5 h. After cooling down, the brown reaction mixture was passed through a thin layer of Celite and washed with toluene (100 mL). The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was first purified by a silica gel column using 1:4 toluene/hexanes as the eluent to remove unreacted C60 and excess boronic acid. Further purification by semipreparative HPLC equipped with a Buckyprep column using toluene as an eluent afforded 0.15 g of brown powder in 50% yield. HPLC analysis using benzene as an eluent indicated that the purified product still contained about 5% isomer, which can be completely removed by running a second HPLC purification with benzene as the eluent. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, δ) 8.64 (d, J = 1.6 Hz, 1H), 8.39 (dd, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 1.6 Hz, 1H), 8.02 (d, J = 8Hz, 2H), 7.79 (m, 1H), 7.40–7.26 (m, 3H), 6.49(s, 1H, C60H), 2.26–2.04 (m, 4H), 1.18–0.96 (m, 8H), 0.67 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6, δ) 154.58, 153.26, 153.00, 151.43, 148.09, 147.86, 147.63, 147.24, 146.79, 146.72, 146.57, 146.55, 146.26, 146.15, 145.90, 145.85, 145.79, 145.72, 145.05, 144.91, 143.68, 142.97, 142.94, 142.70, 142.37, 142.38, 142.02, 141.93, 141.79, 140.86, 140.61, 136.51, 136.17, 127.59, 127.29, 123.46, 121.97, 121.50, 120.55, 68.70 (C60fluorene), 64.28 (C60H), 55.98, 40.40, 26.71, 23.38, 13.98.

Synthesis of 2,2′-(perfluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(9,9-dioctylfluorene) 2
A 100 mL flask was charged with 2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene (4.20 g, 8.13 mmol) and 1,4-dibromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene (1.00 g, 3.25 mmol). The flask was evacuated and filled with argon 3 times to remove traces of air. Pd(PPh3)4 (75 mg) was added into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The flask was equipped with a condenser and again evacuated and filled with argon 2 times. Then, a degassed mixture of indoloantricaprylylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat® 336) (several drops), 2 M K2CO3 aqueous solution (16 mL), and toluene (35 mL) was added via a syringe. The reaction flask was flushed with argon once more. Then, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux with stirring and kept at this temperature for 30 h. After cooling down, the organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with hexanes twice. Then, the organic layers were combined and solvent-stripped. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using 2% ethyl acetate in hexanes as the eluent. The purified product crystallized when left in refrigerator overnight. Finally, 2.82 g of white crystals were obtained in 93.7% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ) 7.82 (dd, J1 = 8 Hz, J2 = 0.4 Hz, 2H), 7.78–7.72 (m, 2H), 7.52–7.46 (m, 4H), 7.38–7.32 (m, 6H), 2.04–1.94 (m, 8H), 1.25–1.00 (m, 40H), 0.80 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 12H), 0.75–0.60 (m, 8H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3, δ) −144.79.
Synthesis of 7,7′-(perfluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(2-bromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene) 3
Compound 2 (2.00 g, 2.16 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL CH2Cl2 containing 5 mg of iodine. Then, Br2 (0.25 mL, 4.75 mmol) was added via a syringe. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was then quenched with Na2S2O3 aqueous solution. The water layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 10 mL), and the organic layers were combined and dried over MgSO4. The crude product was purified by crystallization from 1:1 hexanes/ethanol to give 2.15 g of white crystalline powder in 91% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, δ) 7.79 (d, J1 = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.61 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.52–7.45 (m, 8H), 2.04–1.88 (m, 8H), 1.25–1.00 (m, 40H), 0.81 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 12H), 0.75–0.60 (m, 8H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3, δ) −144.65.
Synthesis of 7,7′-(perfluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)diboronic acid 4
Compound 3 (1.00 g, 0.92 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (25 mL) under argon, and cooled to −78 °C. n-Butyl lithium solution (2.5 M, 0.85 mL) was then added. The solution immediately turned yellow. After stirring for a while, some yellow solids precipitated out. The paste was further stirred at −78 °C for 3 h. Then triisopropyl borate (0.63 mL, 2.75 mmol) was added via a syringe. After stirring for 15 min, the solids disappeared to form a light brown solution. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature slowly and further stirred overnight. HCl aqueous solution (1 M, 50 mL) was then added. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether (3 × 25 mL). The organic layers were combined and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography first using 10% acetone in dichloromethane to remove monoboronic acid and other byproducts and then using pure acetone to elute out the desired product as white powder (0.53 g, 57%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3COCD3/D2O, δ) 8.0–7.92 (m, 4H), 7.89 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 7.81 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 7.61 (s, 2H), 7.53 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 2.14–1.98 (m, 8H), 1.25–0.96 (m, 40H), 0.73 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 12H), 0.68–0.56 (m, 8H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, CD3COCD3/D2O, δ) −145.86.
Synthesis of 7,7′-(perfluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(1,9-dihydro[60]fullerene) 5
To a 100 mL two-necked flask equipped with a short condenser were added C60 (120 mg, 0.167 mmol) and diboronic acid 4 (76 mg, 0.075 mmol). The flask was evacuated and filled with argon 3 times to remove traces of air. Rh(COD)(MeCN)2]BF4 (11 mg, 0.029 mmol) was then added into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. In another 100 mL flask, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (24 mL) and water (6 mL) were added. After degassing, the resulting solvent mixture was transferred to the reaction flask via a syringe. The reaction flask was again evacuated and filled with argon one more time. The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C under argon and stirred at this temperature for 1 day. Then THF (2 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was further stirred for another day. After cooling down, the reaction mixture was diluted with chlorobenzene (30 mL), passed through a thin layer of Celite, and washed with toluene (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was first purified by a silica gel column chromatography to remove unreacted C60 and diboronic acid. Further purification by semipreparative HPLC using toluene as an eluent afforded 56 mg of brown powder in 31% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-C6D4Cl2, δ) 8.81 (d, J = 1.6 Hz, 2H), 8.65 (dd, J1 = 7.6 Hz, J2 = 1.6 Hz, 2H), 8.35 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 8.20 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.99 (s, 2H), 7.85 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 6.87 (s, 1H, C60H), 2.60–2.40 (m, 8H), 1.35–1.10 (m, 48H), 0.89 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 12H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, 1,2-C6D4Cl2, δ) −143.95.

Photovoltaic device fabrication and testing
Glass slides coated with patterned ITO (Colorado Concept Coatings LLC) were cleaned by sonicating sequentially in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol. The active area of each solar cell device was 5 × 20 mm2. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the ITO substrate was treated in a UV-ozone oven for 15 min. Thereafter, the ITO-coated slides were spin-coated (6000 rpm for 60 seconds) with a filtered (0.45 µm NYL w/GMF syringe filter) aqueous suspension of poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P, H. C. Starck), and then baked at 120 °C under N2 for 2 h. The resulting thin PEDOT:PSS layer was about 50 nm thick. A dichlorobenzene solution of PCDTBT and C60 derivative 1 (1:2 by weight) was stirred at 80 °C overnight. After cooling down, it was spun-cast on top of PEDOT–PSS at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting film (∼100 nm in thickness) was kept in a Petri dish overnight and then transferred to an evaporation chamber. The device fabrication was completed by the vacuum deposition of LiF (1 nm) and Al cathode (120 nm). The solar cells with no protective encapsulation were subsequently tested in air under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, Sciencetech Inc., Model SF150). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated with a power meter (Gentec Solo PE Laser Power & Energy Meter). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using a Jobin–Yvon Triax 180 spectrometer, a Jobin–Yvon xenon light source, a Merlin lock-in amplifier, a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR570 low noise current amplifier.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
We first examined the Rh catalyzed C60 arylation by reacting C60 with 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid in H2O/1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:4) under Ar according to Itami's procedure,7 as shown in Scheme 1. The catalyst used was bis(acetonitrile)(cyclo-octa-1,5-diene)rhodium tetrafluoroborate ([Rh(COD)(MeCN)2]BF4). The reaction was followed by HPLC analysis on a Cosmosil Buckyprep column using toluene as the eluent. It was found that besides our desired product, multi-substituted C60 derivatives were also formed, leading to a low reaction yield (∼25%). Since C60 dissolved into dichlorobenzene slowly and 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid was quite soluble in dichlorobenzene, we envisioned that in the beginning 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid was in large excess in solution with respect to the amount of the dissolved C60. This could result in the formation of multi-substituted C60 derivatives. In addition, as boronic acid was over-consumed in the beginning, the reaction system lacks boronic acid in the later stage. As a result, some C60 remained unreacted. Our hypothesis was supported by the fact that the reaction yield was significantly improved from 25% to 50% when 9,9-dibutylfluorene-2-boronic acid was added in two portions, which was proved by HPLC analysis as shown in Fig. 1. It is interesting to point out that an isomer (appearing at 7.15 min during HPCL analysis) also formed together with the desired product (1,2-hydroarylation adduct) as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry measurement showed that the shoulder peak at 7.15 min has the same molecular weight as our target product. The formation of isomers during this Rh catalyzed C60 arylation was not reported in the literature. Further purification by HPLC using benzene as the eluent can completely remove this isomer.

The synthetic route to an oligofluorene bridged C60 dimer 5 is outlined in Scheme 2. Briefly, oligofluorene 2 was synthesized in a high yield (93.7%) via a Suzuki coupling reaction between 2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene and 1,4-dibromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene. To ensure complete conversion of the dibromo compound, a 25% excess of fluorene monoboronate was used. Then, compound 2 was brominated in CH2Cl2 with Br2 in nearly quantitative yield. The conversion of compound 3 to diboronic acid 4 was carried out at low temperature (−78 °C). Otherwise, the reaction yield would be low due to side reactions. The Rh catalyzed coupling reaction between diboronic acid 4 and C60 was carried out first at 60 °C in H2O/1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:4) for 1 day. Then, THF (10% relative to dichlorobenzene) was added, and the reaction mixture was further stirred for another 24 h. We found that the addition of THF to the reaction system was crucial for this reaction, increasing the reaction yield from ∼10% to 31%. The reason why THF improved the reaction yield is not very clear at this moment. However, THF helps to dissolve diboronic acid 4 into the reaction solution. The crude product was isolated by distilling out the solvents, and purified first by silica gel column chromatography and then by HPLC using toluene as the eluent. Fig. 2 shows the proton NMR spectrum of C60 dimer 5 in the aromatic region and its HPLC curve. Both indicate that a high-purity product was obtained.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized C60 derivatives 1 and 5 in chloroform are shown in Fig. 3. For comparison purpose, the absorption spectrum of widely used PC61BM is also included in Fig. 3. PC61BM displays an absorption peak at 328 nm, arising from the π–π* transition of the delocalized 58 π electrons. This absorption band slightly blue-shifts to 311 nm in compound 1. As to the C60 dimer 5, the absorption band of the C60 π electron system overlaps with that of the oligofluorene bridge, appearing at 328 nm. As the oligofluorene itself (compound 2) shows an absorption maximum at 318 nm in chloroform solution, we conclude that the interaction in ground state between the C60 buckyball and the oligofluorene bridge is weak. This result is not very surprising, considering the conjugation between the oligofluorene bridge and the π-electron system of C60 is disrupted by a sp3 hybridized carbon. However, the complete quenching of the strong blue fluorescence of the oligofluorene bridge suggests that energy and/or charge transfer between the oligofluorene bridge and the C60 buckyball in the excited state should be quite efficient (see Fig. 4). In addition, as can be seen from Fig. 3, C60 derivatives 1, 5 and PC61BM have similar optical band gaps, as calculated from their absorption edges.

Thermal properties
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis reveals that the prepared fullerene derivatives 1 and 5 are both amorphous materials with glass transition temperatures at 190.7 and 269.4 °C, respectively. This is in contrast to widely used PC61BM, which shows a melting peak at 295 °C.4c The oligofluorene bridge in the compound 5 is a crystalline material with a melting point at 63.7 °C. However, when the oligofluorene is end-capped with two bulky C60 balls, it cannot form crystalline structures anymore because of steric hindrance. In the meanwhile, the long rigid oligofluorene bridge also prevents the C60 moieties from forming crystals.
Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties of the synthesized C60 derivatives and compare their LUMO energy levels with PC61BM, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out in a three-electrode cell under Ar using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous CH3CN/1,2-dichlorobenzene (1:4, v/v) as the supporting electrolyte. A Pt disk (1 mm diameter), a Pt wire (0.5 mm diameter), and a silver wire (2 mm diameter) served as the working electrode, counter electrode, and quasi-reference electrode, respectively. The compound was dissolved in the supporting electrolyte solution. Prior to the CV study, the Ag quasi-reference electrode was first calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (0.35 V vs.Ag/AgCl) as an external standard, and was found to be −0.02 V vs.SCE. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels of the C60 derivatives can be estimated using the following empirical equations, ELUMO = En′ + 4.38 eV, respectively, where En′ is the onset reduction potential relative to the Ag quasi-reference electrode. Fig. 5 displays the cyclic voltammograms of C60 derivatives 1 and 5. These two fullerene derivatives underwent reversible cathodic reduction with negligible change in the CV curves after successive multiple potential scans. This indicates that they are good electron acceptors with high stability for electron injection. It is interesting to point out that C60 derivatives 1 and 5 have LUMO energy levels quite similar to that of PC61BM, located at ∼3.94 eV. This means that the energy levels of fullerene derivatives mainly depend on the π electron system of the C60 skeleton and the oligofluorene substituents have little effect on the energy levels. We also carried out anodic oxidation sweeps on the two C60 derivatives and oligofluorene 2. No anodic oxidation wave could be observed for all the three compounds up to a potential of 2.0 V vs.Ag. This suggests that these three compounds have very deep HOMO energy levels and are hard to be oxidized in the ground state. In the excited state, however, there is an efficient charge transfer between the oligofluorene bridge and the two C60 end groups as the LUMO of the oligofluorene is located at 2.79 eV (estimated from the CV measurement), well above the LUMO energy level of the C60 dimer 5.

Photovoltaic performance
The PV response of the synthesized C60 derivatives 1 and 5 was investigated by blending them with PCDTBT at different weight ratios. PCDTBT was selected as the hole-transporting material in this study because this polymer is one of the best p-type materials reported so far for solar cell applications and demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 6.0% when blended with PC71BM.11 Previous studies on this polymer done by us and other groups have shown that neither thermal annealing nor the use of 1,8-diiodooctane (a processing additive) can improve the device performance.11,12 The bulk heterojunction PV cells fabricated in this study had a device structure of ITO/PEDOT–PSS/PCDTBT:C60 derivatives 1 or 5/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm) with a PV active area of 1 cm2. The active layer was spin-cast from dichlorobenzene solution using a slow solvent evaporation process.13 The weight ratio of PCDTBT to C60 derivatives varies from 1:1 to 1:3. Because of the poor solubility of the C60 derivative 5 in dichlorobenzene, it was difficult to get a smooth and uniform film, and the resulting device had a very low PV response. For PCDTBT/C60F 1 based solar cells, the best performance was achieved at 1:2 weight ratio, and the power conversion efficiency reached 2.3% with a Voc of 0.90 V and a Jsc of 6.4 mA cm−2. Our previous study showed that the PCDTBT/PC61BM blend gave the best efficiency at the same weight ratio.12Fig. 6 shows the current–voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the fabricated devices. It is worth pointing out that the short-circuit current measured under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 is the same as the value calculated from the EQE data and the solar spectrum. Detailed analysis of the dark I–V curves revealed that the device series resistance is high (39 Ω cm2). This can explain the low fill factor (0.40) of the fabricated solar cells. We conjectured that the high series resistance may arise from the low electron mobility of C60F 1 since it is an amorphous material unlike PC61BM. To confirm this, we fabricated bottom-contact field-effect transistors using spin-coated neat C60 derivative 1 or PC61BM film as the active layer. The electron mobility was found to be 4.6 × 10−6 and 2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for C60F 1 and PC61BM, respectively. To further improve the device efficiency, we used the mixture of C60F 1 and PC61BM (1:1 by weight) as the electron acceptor and the weight ratio of PCDTBT to the C60 derivatives was fixed at 1:2. An EQE calibrated power conversion efficiency of 3.4% was achieved, and the series resistance was reduced to 15 Ω cm2. The interesting thing was that the Voc was improved to 0.92 V. This result implies that it is possible to use the mixture of different fullerene derivatives to optimize the optoelectronic properties and/or nano-scale morphology of the active layer to enhance the device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile approach for the chemical modification of C60via a Rh catalyzed arylation with oligofluorene boronic acids. Since boronic acids are readily prepared and compatible with a variety of organic functional groups, this approach will open a new avenue for the functionalization of fullerene derivatives for applications in organic electronic devices. UV-vis absorption and CV measurements showed that the substituents have little impact on the energy levels of the resultant C60 derivatives. However, we found that the substituents have huge impacts on other physical properties, such as solubility and crystallinity. Since the control of film morphology is critically important for applications in organic electronic devices, the substituents of C60 derivatives can be tailored to achieve desired nanostructured morphology when blended with semiconducting polymers.
