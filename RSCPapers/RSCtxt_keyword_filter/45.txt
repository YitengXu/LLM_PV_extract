    , Accepted 5th January 2016First published on 5th January 2016AbstractIncorporating two polymer donors with different bandgaps to compose a ternary blend bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is proved to be an effective approach to improve the device performance of BHJ polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we demonstrate an efficient ternary PSC consisting of a polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) host blend sensitized by a low band gap (LBG) polymer poly[2,7-(5,5-bis-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-5H-dithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]pyran)-alt-4,7-(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTP-DFBT). The addition of the PDTP-DFBT sensitizer remarkably extended the PSC photon to electron response from 750 to 900 nm, which increased the Jsc from 15.12 to 16.27 mA cm−2, and the device performance from 8.08% to 8.63%. A study on the morphology involving the atomic force microscopy mapping and grazing incident X-ray diffraction showed that the incorporation of PDTP-DFBT improved the crystallinity of the PTB7 film with most of the sensitizers associated with the PTB7 domains when blending with a PC71BM film. This observation, together with the unchanged Voc of the ternary PSC, implies a sensitizing mechanism with addition of PDTP-DFBT. After further interfacial modification with a capronic acid self-assembling monolayer (C3-SAM), a higher PCE of 9.06% was achieved, which is among the highest values of efficient ternary PSCs. Our work suggests that a sensitizing mechanism of ternary blends compensates for the light absorbing limitation of binary blend PSCs for high device performance.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have attracted a great deal of attention as promising light-weight, flexible, large-area and low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon-based inorganic photovoltaic devices.1–5 A solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cell (PSC) based on a binary blend of a polymer donor and a fullerene acceptor is a simple, yet successful technique to achieve high efficiency devices.6–9 Recently, an increasing number of single-junction binary BHJ PSCs with efficiencies over 8% were reported.10–12 However, the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of such polymer: fullerene BHJ solar cells is calculated to be 12% and one of the major limitations is insufficient light absorption.13,14 This issue can be partially alleviated by utilizing tandem architecture stacking two or more sub-cells in series or parallel; however the processing of tandem solar cells is much more complex.15–20
Alternatively, ternary blend BHJ PSCs which incorporate two polymer donors with complementary absorption and one fullerene acceptor into a single BHJ active layer have been recognized as an effective strategy to expand the light absorption range, while retaining the simplicity of single junction processing. However, successful cases have seldom been observed with such a ternary strategy until very recently.21,22 There are two main mechanisms operating in ternary systems, one is the sensitization effect and the other is the parallel-like mechanism. Markus et al. demonstrated that the photocurrent response of a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based bulk heterojunction could be extended into the near infrared region (NIR) by adding small fractions of a low bandgap (LBG) polymer, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), to the host blend and the performance improvement originated from the enhanced short-current density.23,24 PCPDTBT in this system works like a NIR sensitizer and the Voc is composition independent. Unlike the P3HT:PCPDTBT:PC61BM ternary solar cell in which too much doping of the third component PCPDTBT would cause a serious decrease in the fill factor (FF), Petr et al. used two P3HT analogues which had compatible molecular structures to fabricate ternary blend devices, and they found that the open circuit voltage was composition dependent and achieved a high FF in the overall polymer component region.25 Yang et al. observed similar phenomena to Petr's in another two prototypical systems and first proposed a parallel-like bulk heterojunction (PBHJ) model to explain such ternary systems.26 Lu et al. demonstrated that besides extending the absorption range, the combination of cascade energy levels and optimized device morphology was also very crucial to the ternary blend BHJ PSCs based on a PID2-doped PTB7:PC71BM ternary system.27 Yang et al. recently reported several ternary BHJ systems and established a relationship between the device performance and molecular structure.28 Besides combining two polymer donors, Wei et al. incorporated high crystallinity small molecules into a host binary PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend to form a high crystallinity and face-on orientation polymer-small molecule alloy; as a result a high efficiency of 10.5% was achieved.29 To the best of our knowledge, several successful high performance ternary solar cells reported in recent years were based on PTB7 as the host donor; thus it is significant to investigate other successful PTB7 ternary systems.
Here, we demonstrate an efficient ternary blend solar cell by incorporating poly[2,7-(5,5-bis-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-5H-dithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]pyran)-alt-4,7-(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTP-DFBT), a LBG polymer donor material, into polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) host blend PSCs. PDTP-DFBT, a LBG polymer with an absorption edge up to 900 nm, has been used as a rear cell in tandem devices.30 In our work, we used it as a guest donor in PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM ternary systems and found out that it worked like a NIR sensitizer according to the experimental results. The optimal ternary device with 20% weight ratio of PDTP-DFBT exhibited the best PCE of 8.63%, higher than that (8.08%) of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend solar cell. Besides the broader absorption of the ternary solar cell, the atomic force microscopy mapping and grazing incident X-ray diffraction results showed that the improved crystallinity of PTB7 also contributed to the increase of short current density. We further modified the electron transport layer by using a capronic acid self-assembly monolayer (C3-SAM) which had been applied in perovskite solar cells by our group before31 and successfully achieved a PCE of 9.06%.
Experimental section
Materials and equipment
All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich if not specified. The PTB7 and PDTP-DFBT were purchased from One-materials Corp and used as received. The PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source Corp and used as received. The UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a Varian CARY100 Bio spectrophotometer. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded by using a Nanscope IIIa multimode scanning probe microscope. The steady-state PL spectra were taken on a FluoroMax-4 HORIBA Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer.
Device fabrication and measurement
The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone and an isopropanol ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After being dried using clean N2 gas, the substrates were treated in a UV-Ozone machine for 30 min. The preparation of the ZnO precursor solution was carried out following ref. 32, where zinc acetate dehydrate and ethanolamine were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast on top of the ITO glass substrates at 3500 rpm and annealed at 160 °C for 30 min in air to form a 30–40 nm thick ZnO ETL. The ZnO-coated substrates were transferred into a glovebox for further C3-SAM modification, and the method was carried out following ref. 31. In the following, 25 mg ml−1 PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM (10 mg ml−1 for polymer and 15 mg ml−1 for PC71BM) solution in chlorobenzene solvent with 3% solvent additives (DIO) was spin-cast on the ZnO or C3-SAM at 1400 rpm to form a 110 nm thick active layer. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Ag were evaporated sequentially on the active layer in a vacuum to complete the devices. The active area of the device is defined around 5.2 mm2 by the cross-section of the electrodes. The J–V characteristic curve of the PSC was recorded on a Keithley source unit under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 by using a solar simulator from Abet Corp. External quantum efficiency spectra were measured based on a monochromator, chopper, lock-in amplifier and light source.
Results and discussion
Absorption spectra
The chemical structures and energy levels of PTB7, PDTP-DFBT and PC71BM are presented in Fig. 1a and b respectively. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the ternary blend films with different PDTP-DFBT contents are presented in Fig. 1c. Absorption spectra show that the main absorption region of PTB7 and PDTP-DFBT is around 550–700 nm and 650–800 nm, respectively. For PDTP-DFBT, there is a small absorption peak around 420 nm. Although the absorption range of these two polymers does not match very well with an overlap absorption range around 700 nm, PDTP-DFBT with an absorption edge up to 900 nm is good enough to compensate for the absorption of the PTB7 binary solar cell in the long-wavelength region from 750 to 900 nm. This is confirmed by that increasing the PDTP-DFBT content in the PTB7:PDTP-DFBT blend film gradually enhances the absorption from 750 to 900 nm. Interestedly, not as we expected, the absorption from 550 to 700 nm (absorption range of PTB7) of the PTB7:PDTP-DFBT blend film is actually enhanced compared with that of the pure PTB7 film. After a detailed study on the film morphology, we attribute this absorption change to the improved crystallinity of PTB7 with PDTP-DFBT incorporation.

Solar cell fabrication and characterization
The devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and the schematic device structure is shown in Fig. 2a. The overall polymer to PC71BM weight ratio was kept at 1:1.5 which is the optimized weight ratio for PTB7:PC71BM. The weight fraction of PDTP-DFBT was changed from 0% by 10% increment one step gradually until the performance of ternary devices got worse. Fig. 2b shows the corresponding short current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM with 10%, 20%, and 30% PDTP-DFBT contents and PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination. Table 1 summarizes the binary and ternary device parameters. ESI Fig. S1† shows the statistic PCE histograms of the devices. The optimized thickness of active layers is all around 110 nm. It is obvious that the doping of PDTP-DFBT has different effects on the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of ternary PSCs according to the device parameters summarized in Table 1. The Voc nearly has no change with the increase of the PDTP-DFBT content. This implies that the third component PDTP-DFBT does not form its own independent hole transport network and works like a NIR sensitizer. The FF has a slight decrease when we just add a 10% content of PDTP-DFBT, but decreases more and more heavily with the increase of PDTP-DFBT content. This is the main reason why the PCEs of ternary devices decrease when the PDTP-DFBT weight ratio increases up to 30%. The change of the FF is partly attributed to the relatively poor performance of the PDTP-DFBT which gives the best PCE of 4.05% with a FF of 48.60%. The Jsc increases first and then decreases with the increase of PDTP-DFBT content. Compared with the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend device, the ternary PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM blend device with 20% content PDTP-DFBT achieved the best performance: Jsc increased from 15.12 mA cm−2 to 16.27 mA cm−2, FF decreased from 72.22% to 70.67% and PCE increased from 8.08% to 8.63%. The enhanced PCE of the ternary PSCs is mainly due to the increase of Jsc.

To study the origin of the increased Jsc and confirm the contribution of the third component PDTP-DFBT to the photocurrent, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the binary and ternary devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 2c, compared with that of the binary device, the EQE responses of the ternary devices are enhanced in the long-wavelength region from 750 to 900 nm (the absorption of PDTP-DFBT) with the increase of the PDTP-DFBT content. It is observed that the EQE responses first increase and then decrease in the region 550 to 700 nm (the absorption of PTB7) which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption change. Around 500 nm where the PDTP-DFBT nearly has no absorption, the EQE responses of the ternary devices decrease gradually with the decrease of the PTB7 content. Overall, the variation trend of the EQE is the same as the Jsc change.
Besides, the conventional binary and ternary devices were also fabricated to confirm the effect of the ternary strategy by adding PDTP-DFBT into the PTB7:PC71BM active layer. The device structure and its J–V curves and EQE spectra are depicted in Fig. S2,† and device parameters are summarized in Table S1.† It was observed that device performance also showed improvement in the conventional structure with the ternary strategy. This implied that the advantage of ternary over the binary active layer system is irrelevant to the device structures in our case.
Hole mobility
The hole mobilities of the PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM blend with different PDTP-DFBT contents were further studied via the space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. Hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The hole mobility is calculated by fitting the J–V characteristics according to the Mott–Gurney law.33J–V characteristics under dark of the hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding hole mobilities are summarized in Table 2. The hole mobility of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend is 2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. With the increase of the PDTP-DFBT weight ratio, the hole mobility was decreased gradually, which dropped to 1.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 30% PDTP-DFBT. This observation explained the drop of the FF with incorporation of PDTP-DFBT and is reasonable considering the discontinuousness of the hole carrier transport pathway as caused by the interruption of the third component. In order to find the details, we studied the morphologies of the PTB7:PC71BM film with or without the PDTP-DFBT.

Film morphology
Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)34 is performed to probe the molecular packing information on the pure and blend films. Fig. 4 shows the two-dimensional (2D) GIXRD patterns of the pure polymers and polymer blend films. In the 2D-GIXRD image of the pure PTB7 thin film, a weak and broad arc-like X-ray reflection peak (qz = 1.61 Å−1) along the qz axis corresponds to the preferred π–π stacking of PTB7 in the out-of-plane direction. Meanwhile, a weak (100) peak is present at qr = 0.28 Å−1 due to the lamellar stacking of PTB7 in the in-plane direction. This demonstrates the low crystallinity of the PTB7 film with a preferential face-on orientation, consistent with previous reports.28,35 The pure PDTP-DFBT thin film shows a relatively narrower lamella peak at qr = 0.34 Å−1 indicating a longer coherence length. The absence of obvious π–π peak and weak lamella peak intensity implies that the PDTP-DFBT film also has quite low crystallinity. Remarkably, the PTB7:PDTP-DFBT (0.8:0.2) blend film exhibits a strong lamella ring and a face-on π–π peak at qz = 1.63 Å−1, indicating that the crystallinity and face-on order are greatly enhanced, which could be attributed to the formation of a polymer alloy and/or the nucleation effect due to solubility differences of PTB7 and PTDP-DFBT in a CB:DIO solvent mixture .29 Note that we cannot distinguish whether the peaks originate from PTB7 or PDTP-DFBT due to their similar lattice constants. Nevertheless, the enhanced crystallinity and face-on order will certainly contribute to the observed larger Jsc and better efficiency of the ternary devices.

Fig. 5 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images and phase images of PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM blend films with different fractions of PDTP-DFBT. From the phase images Fig. 5a–d, the binary blend film exhibits continuous networks and the size of domains is around 20–40 nm which is efficient for exciton separation. While for ternary blend films, the phase aggregation becomes much more serious and the size of domains is much larger with the increase of PDTP-DFBT content. This indicates that PTB7 is more likely to stack together with the PDTP-DFBT incorporation. From the height images Fig. 5e–h, the ternary blend film becomes rougher because of the phase aggregation which would not favorable for the contact between the active layer and the MoO3. The change of the morphology well explains the reason why the FF of the ternary devices decreases compared with that of the binary devices.

Photoluminescence spectra
To elucidate the sensitization mechanism, we carried out photoluminescence (PL) measurements. PL spectra of PTB7 and PTB7 with 10, 20%, 30% PDTP-DFBT and PDTP-DFBT solid films are provided in Fig. 6. The photoluminescence spectra of these films were all excited at 620 nm. As shown in Fig. 1b, the cascade energy structure of PTB7, PDTP-DFBT and PC71BM energetically allows the photoinduced charge transfer between PTB7 and PDTP-DFBT which is beneficial for the charge dissociation and transport. Fig. 6 shows that by increasing the amount of the PDTP-DFBT in PTB7, the PL emission of PTB7 decreases continuously which suggests a charge transfer mechanism operating in this system.

Interfacial modification
To the best of our knowledge, nearly no interfacial engineering is used in previous ternary PSC systems. Here to further improve the performance of the ternary solar cells, we applied a 3-aminopropanoic acid self-assembly monolayer (C3-SAM) on the top of ZnO as a modification layer. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7:PDTP-DFBT:PC71BM ternary solar cells (0.8:0.2:1.5) with and without C3-SAM under AM 1.5G illumination. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3. After C3-SAM interfacial modification, the Jsc and FF of the PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7 (80%):PDTP-DFBT (20%):PC71BM devices were both improved, the same effect as that we have studied in perovskite solar cells.31 This indicates that the C3-SAM is also efficient in PSCs and the detailed mechanism is worth studying individually. As a result, we get a highly efficient ternary PSC with an efficiency of 9.06%.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated 9.06% efficient organic solar cells using the ternary strategy, where two state-of-the-art polymer donor materials with complementary absorption were involved. Remarkable enhancement in the short circuit current density with a little Voc or FF drop was observed due to the dye-sensitizing mechanism. The synergistic effects of improving the crystallinity and preferred molecular orientation were observed. By modifying the surface with a self-assembly monolayer, the charge extraction is improved, which leads to appreciable improvement in device performance.
