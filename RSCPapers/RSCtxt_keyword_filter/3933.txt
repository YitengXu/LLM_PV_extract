    , Accepted 18th March 2012First published on 20th March 2012AbstractThe functions of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanoparticles (N-HCNPs) as counter electrodes in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been studied in this paper. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization tests reveal a low charge transfer resistance and a high exchange current density between polysulfide electrolyte and the N-HCNPs electrode. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the N-HCNPs electrode shows high electrocatalytic activity and excellent tolerance toward the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte. A power conversion efficiency of 2.67% is achieved for the QDSSCs based on N-HCNPs counter electrodes, which is clearly higher than those of the QDSSCs based on HCNPs, carbon nanotubes and Pt counter electrodes. The results reveal that the N-HCNPs electrode is a promising counter electrode candidate for QDSSCs.
1. Introduction
Along with recent great achievements in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1–3 quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)4–8 have attracted much attention given its combined advantage of quantum dots (QDs) and DSSCs system. As attractive sensitizer candidates for DSSCs, QDs have a high extinction coefficient and large intrinsic dipole moment. Their band gaps can be easily tuned by changing their sizes and shapes, providing excellent light absorbing materials in sensitized solar cells. QDs can also stably adsorb on metal oxides and can be produced at a significantly lower cost than dyes. Thus, QDSSCs have the potential to improve the efficiency of sensitized solar cells.
Metal chalcogenide QDs with narrow band gaps are the most widely investigated inorganic light-harvesting materials in QDSSCs.6–8 Unfortunately, the well-known and most efficient I−/I3− redox couple in DSSCs is not compatible with these semiconducting materials, they lead to a slow hole removal that enhances the recombination efficiency and a rapid corrosion of QDs.9 Consequently, to maintain the favorable band alignment for charge separation, charge transfer processes and QDs stability, a general substitution of the redox couple in the cell configuration is required. The replacement must be stable with the photoanodes and counter electrodes over a sufficiently long time.10 The most common optimal redox couples applied in QDSSCs are sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) ones. These redox couples can effectively stabilize QDs and improve the performance of QDSSCs using cadmium chalcogenides (S, Se or Te) as sensitizers.11,12 However, the surface activity and conductivity of Pt counter electrodes are suppressed because of the adsorption of the sulfur atoms.13,14 Thus, Pt is unable to regenerate the polysulfide electrolyte in terms of eqn (1), resulting in high series resistances in cells and low photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. The efficiencies of QDSSCs have been reported to reach values of around 4–5%,15,16 which are still much lower than those of DSSCs. Sn2− + 2e → Sn−12− + S2−(1)
Ultimately, the performance of the QDSSCs is determined by the electrocatalytic properties and tolerance of the counter electrodes toward the S2−/Sn2− redox couples. Therefore, suitable counter electrodes for polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs need to be found. Some new counter electrode materials such as Au, Cu2S, CoS, PbS, and carbon13,17,18 have been reported. Among them, carbon materials have emerged as potential counter electrodes for DSSCs and QDSSCs, mainly due to their excellent corrosion resistance and versatile catalytic properties. Recently, Lee et al.19 reported an efficiency close to that of Pt counter electrode based DSSCs using nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanotubes. They conclude that N-doped carbon structures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the additional electrons contributed by the N atom.20 N-doping is an attractive approach for effectively tuning the physical and chemical properties of carbon materials to be applied in catalysis.19,20 However, to the best of our knowledge, reports on the use of N-doped carbon materials in QDSSCs with polysulfide electrolyte are limited.
In our previous studies, N-doped carbon materials have been synthesized and showed excellent catalytic properties in electrochemical catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and I3− reduction in DSSCs.20,21 In the present work, the property of N-doped hollow carbon nanoparticles (N-HCNPs) used in QDSSCs as counter electrode material were demonstrated and compared with the performance of HCNPs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Pt electrodes. The low charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the N-HCNPs counter electrode/electrolyte interface was achieved based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), revealing the extraordinary catalytic ability of the N-HCNPs counter electrodes for the reduction of Sn2−. The electrocatalytic property of the N-HCNPs was further investigated by Tafel-polarization measurements and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cells comprising N-HCNPs as counter electrodes showed higher energy conversion efficiencies than those comprising HCNPs, commercial CNTs, and conventional Pt counter electrodes.
2. Experimental
Synthesis of N-HCNPs
N-HCNPs were assembled by detonation-assisted chemical vapor deposition as previously reported.20,21 Typically, 2.5 g of picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol) and 0.7 mL of dimethylformamide were loaded into a sealed stainless steel pressure vessel (14 cm3) equipped with a pressure valve. Detonation was initiated by quick heating (20 °C min−1) to 320 °C (the ignition temperature of picric acid). Subsequently, a high-temperature and high-pressure environment of about 1000 °C and 20–45 MPa was created inside the vessel. The vessel was then cooled to ambient temperature, the gaseous product was vented and the solid product of N-HCNPs was collected.
Preparation of N-HCNPs counter electrodes
N-HCNPs powder pastes were prepared using TiO2 colloid as the connecting adhesive.22 The TiO2 colloid was prepared according to a modified procedure described previously.23 Briefly, about 10 mL of titanium(IV) n-butoxide was added dropwise to 60 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 under vigorous stirring. The obtained slurry was then heated to 80 °C and kept for 8 h. The TiO2 precipitate was peptized to a white transparent colloid powder. The N-HCNPs paste was obtained by grinding 130 mg of N-HCNPs powder, 0.2 mL of TiO2 colloid, 0.2 mL of 10% Triton X-100 aqueous solution and 0.4 mL of water in a mortar. The carbon paste was coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by the doctor-blade method. The substrate was dried for several minutes at room temperature and then heated in air at 450 °C for 30 min. HCNPs (obtained from Dr Song as previously reported24) and commercial CNTs (purchased from Tsinghua University of China) counter electrodes were fabricated by the above described method. Traditional Pt counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 (30 mM in isopropanol) on FTO glass at 400 °C for 30 min for comparison.
Fabrication of QDSSCs
The photoanodes of the QDSSCs were prepared by coating the P25-TiO2 paste onto FTO glass using the doctor-blade method according to literature.25 The TiO2-coated FTO was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. Chemical bath deposition was used to assemble the CdS and CdSe QDs in sequence on the TiO2 film as described previously.26 The deposition experiment was carried out at 10 °C in the dark. The deposition time for CdS and CdSe QDs was 30 min and 5.5 h, respectively. Finally, surface passivation with ZnS was conducted twice by alternately dipping into 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min alternately. The QDs-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and various counter electrodes were assembled in a sandwich-type cell. The electrolytes were penetrated into the cell, which was composed of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S in H2O.
For the EIS and Tafel-polarization tests, two identical carbon or Pt electrodes were placed face-to-face to form symmetric dummy cells filling the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte similar to the one applied in fabricating QDSSCs.
Characterization
The morphology of the N-HCNPs was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system (JEM-2010) operated at 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were detected at 77 K on an ASAP2020 M automated gas-sorption system after the sample was degassed at 423 K and 20 μTorr for 6 h. The pore size distribution was estimated from the N2 adsorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The specific surface area was determined from nitrogen adsorption using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. Elemental composition was investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with an Al-Kα X-ray source and a 500 μm electron beam spot.
The charge transfer resistance was determined by EIS, performed on the symmetric cells using an electrochemical workstation (IM6ex, Zahner). In the EIS experiments, the potential applied across the dummy cell was 0 V (open circuit potential, Voc), the perturbation amplitude was 10 mV and the frequency range was between 100 KHz and 100 mHz. For photovoltaic testing, a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91192) was used to provide an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). A digital source meter (2400 Source Meter, Keithley Instruments Inc., USA) was used to record the current–voltage plots. CV was carried out on electrochemical station (CHI 660d Shanghai, China) in a three-electrode system with carbon/FTO or Pt/FTO as the working electrode, a foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode at different scan rates. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution containing 10 mM Na2S, 10 mM S, and 0.1 M LiClO4 as supporting electrolytes. The electrochemical station was also employed to measure the Tafel-polarization curve of the symmetric cells at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
TEM was used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the N-HCNPs. As shown in Fig. 1a and 1b, there is obvious contrast between the dark edge and the pale center of the particles, which reveals the hollow core characteristics. The TEM images reveal that the particles have an average outer diameter ranging from 10 nm to 25 nm and a shell thickness of about 2 nm to 3 nm. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the N-HCNPs is shown in Fig. 1c. A typical type IV profile with an H3 hysteresis is observed, revealing the existence of mesopores and macropores in the N-HCNPs. The pore size distribution calculated from the adsorption and desorption branches by BJH method is shown in the inset in Fig. 1c. The N-HCNPs clearly have two predominant mesopores with sizes of approximately 3.3 and 30 nm corresponding to the mesopores in the shell and hollow mesoporous core, respectively. A pore size distribution at 3.3 nm shows reversibility for both the adsorption and desorption branches, meaning that the pores at 3.3 nm is real but not due to the tensile strength effect (TSE) phenomenon.27 Such a mesopore-micropore-organized structure endows the N-HCNPs with a large BET surface area of 454 m2 g−1. The XPS spectrum of the N-HCNPs shows a dominant narrow C 1s peak at 284 eV, an N 1s peak at 400 eV, and an O 1s peak at 531 eV (Fig. 1d). Clearly, the nitrogen atoms are successfully incorporated into the structure of N-HCNPs. The N-doping, large surface area and highly porous structure of carbon particles may facilitate the electrocatalytic activity of the S2−/Sn2− redox reaction in the electrolyte solution. The previously reported structure of HCNPs is very analogous to that of N-HCNPs (data not shown).

Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves of the QDSSCs using N-HCNPs, HCNPs, CNTs and Pt as counter electrodes. The detailed photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. When the as-prepared N-HCNPs electrode is used as a counter electrode, the photovoltaic parameters are as follows: Voc = 0.51 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 13.53 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) = 0.40 and η = 2.67%. Obviously, an improved solar cell performance is observed for the N-HCNPs counter electrode compared with the Pt electrode. The N-HCNPs counter electrode based QDSSCs yields a η value of 2.67%, which is caused by a considerable increase in the Jsc. However, the cell with HCNPs as counter electrode has lowest η because of the decreased Jsc. A comparable efficiency is observed for the CNTs counter electrode, although the Voc and Jsc are slightly lower than those of the Pt counter electrode. This finding can be mainly ascribed to the enhancement in FF resulted from low Nernst diffusion impedance Zw as discussed later. Compared with the three carbon materials used in QDSSCs, the N-HCNPs electrode shows better photovoltaic performance than the HCNPs and CNTs electrodes, this finding is consistent with a previous report on the excellent electrocatalytic performance of N-doped carbon structures due to additional electrons contributed by the N atom.

To evaluate the electrochemical characteristics of N-HCNPs, HCNPs, CNTs and Pt electrodes, EIS was performed on the symmetrical dummy cells comprising two identical electrodes mentioned in the introduction.28,29Fig. 3a shows the cross-sectional view of the symmetric cell. The impedance spectra can be interpreted and modeled using the equivalent circuits shown in Fig. 3b. The Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells are shown in Fig. 3c and 3d. Two semicircles are observed in the measured frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 KHz for four symmetric cells. By fitting the plots using Z-VIEW software, Rs is defined as the ohmic series resistance in the high frequency range around 100 KHz, including the sheet resistance of the two identical electrodes and the electrolytic resistance. Rct is determined from the semicircles in the frequency region of 1–100 KHz (the first cycle), which includes the charge-transfer processes occurring at the counter electrode/electrolyte, correlated with the electrocatalytic activity for the S2−/Sn2− redox reaction. The low frequency (100 mHz to 10 Hz, the second cycle) intercepted on the real axis represents the finite layer Zw of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple in the electrolyte. Table 2 summarizes the obtained impedance parameters after fitting for various counter electrodes.

The spectra shown in Fig. 3c and data listed in Table 2, reveal that the Rs values are the same level for the Pt and the N-HCNPs electrodes. Thus, the sheet resistance of the N-HCNPs electrode is as good as that of the Pt electrode. The Rct values of the N-HCNPs, HCNPs, CNTs and Pt counter electrodes are 1.96, 120.96, 2.81, 69 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rct of N-HCNPs electrode is far lower (about 40 times) than that of the Pt electrode, suggesting an acceleration of the electron transfer process at the electrolyte–N-HCNPs counter electrode interface and the extraordinary catalytic ability for the reduction of Sn2−. The better catalytic ability of N-HCNPs is expected to improve the photovoltaic performance in QDSSCs by increasing Jsc of the solar cells as shown in J–V curves. The higher Rct of the Pt counter electrode is attributed to the attachment and poisoning of S in the polysulfide solution, increasing the charge transfer resistance.30Zw of N-HCNPs is also much lower than that of the Pt electrode, but the lowest Zw is obtained for the CNTs electrode. This result indicates a better electrolyte diffusion capability in the CNTs layer, which facilitates faster mass transport and improves the photovoltaic performance of cells by increasing FF as shown in Table 1. For the HCNPs electrode, the higher Rct and Zw signify that this material is not suitable as an electrocatalytic electrode for polysulfide electrolyte.
To further evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the N-HCNPs electrode, Tafel-polarization tests were conducted in a dummy cell similar to the one used in the EIS measurements.29 The plot of log J versus overpotential for four different counter electrodes is shown in Fig. 4. The exchange current density (J0) can be obtained as the intercept of the extrapolated linear region of anodic and cathodic branches when the overpotential is zero, which is a direct measure of the electron transfer kinetics at the interface under equilibrium conditions.31Fig. 4 shows that the anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curves have the largest slope for the N-HCNPs, indicating a higher J0 on this electrode based on the Tafel equation. Hence, the N-HCNPs show better electrocatalytic activity, in agreement with the EIS results.

CV was also performed to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activities and stabilities of four different materials. The electrochemical behaviors of N-HCNPs, HCNPs, CNTs and Pt electrodes for the S2−/Sn2− redox couple was investigated from 0.3 V to −0.8 V at a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1. The reduction (negative currents) and oxidation (positive currents) peaks are assigned to the reduction of Sn2− to S2− and the oxidation of S2−, respectively. In the study of counter electrodes in QDSSCs, the reduction peak current was the most relevant, expressing the catalytic ability of counter electrode for Sn2− reduction as shown in eqn (1). Fig. 5a shows that the typical pair of redox peaks is observed for the Pt and N-HCNPs electrode. The current density at the reduction peak of the N-HCNPs electrode is conspicuously larger than the Pt electrode, suggesting the larger active surface of the N-HCNPs electrode. The reduction peak of the N-HCNPs electrode is shifted slightly toward the positive side, indicating that the reduction reaction can occur at a lower overpotential on the N-HCNPs electrode and consequently a higher Voc can be obtained in the N-HCNPs counter electrode based QDSSCs. The electrochemical stabilities of the counter electrodes were also studied by monitoring successive CV behavior with the number of cycles. As shown in Fig. 5b, the redox current greatly declines and the reduction peak disappears after five cycles for the Pt electrode, which means the strong corrosion between the polysulfide electrolyte and Pt electrode. In contrast, with increased number of cycles, the CV curves of the N-HCNPs electrode do not change significantly (Fig. 5c) and show stable peak current density (Fig. 5d). This finding indicates that the N-HCNPs electrode has excellent electrochemical stability in polysulfide electrolyte. In addition, the CNTs electrode also shows good tolerance to polysulfide electrolyte after 15 cycles of CV scanning (data not shown), but its reduction peak is not obvious (Fig. 5a). This phenomenon may have arisen from the slow electron transfer at the interface of the CNTs electrode and electrolyte, suggesting relatively poor catalytic ability. The reduction and oxidation peaks are not obvious for the HCNPs electrode, indicating very poor catalytic ability for polysulfide electrolyte, similar to the EIS results. Thus, by combining the results of EIS and CV, we can conclude that the N-HCNPs electrode has superior electrocatalytic activity and excellent electrochemical stability in polysulfide electrolyte.

4. Conclusions
N-HCNPs materials have been successfully used as a counter electrode in QDSSCs system. The QDSSCs using this N-doped carbon material achieves a conversion efficiency of 2.67%, which is the highest among HCNPs, commercial CNTs and conventional Pt electrodes. The Rct of the N-HCNPs electrode toward the polysulfide electrolyte greatly decreased compared with those of HCNPs, CNTs and Pt electrodes. The exchange current density value for the N-HCNPs/polysulfide system is significantly higher than the other systems. The N-HCNPs electrode also shows better electrochemical stability and tolerance to sulfur poisoning in polysulfide electrolyte. These results demonstrate that the N-HCNPs electrode is a promising material that can replace expensive Pt counter electrode for QDSSCs. The better performance of the N-HCNPs electrode is primarily attributed to the higher electrocatalytic activity of the N-HCNPs material because of N-doping. N-doping may introduce many active sites in the porous structure, but this proposal needs further validation.
