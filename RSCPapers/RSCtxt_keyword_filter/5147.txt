    , Accepted 23rd April 2018First published on 24th April 2018AbstractLow-temperature processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were prepared using an amorphous niobium-doped titanium oxide (Nb/TiOx) film as a compact layer (CL) combined with a brookite TiO2 mesoporous layer. Nb concentration of 4% in amorphous TiOx CL was found to improve the photocurrent-voltage performances of formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)-mixed perovskite, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, and FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite solar cells, which were fabricated on 100 °C and 130 °C-annealed TiOx CLs; these solar cells exhibited conversion efficiencies up to 19.1% and 19.8%, respectively. The Nb/TiOx-based FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite cell obtained entirely by a low temperature process (130 °C or less) exhibited high stability against light soaking without encapsulation of the device.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide materials have attracted significant interest of researchers because of their high conversion efficiency, ease of fabrication in laboratory-scale, and potential of low cost production.1–5 Since a conversion efficiency of 22.7% has been achieved,6 which approaches the theoretical efficiency limit, the importance of related technologies for obtaining high device durability, low cost process, development of flexible device,7–13 and lead-free materials14–20 has increased significantly.
Low-temperature preparation of organic solar cells using metal oxide materials is a key technology for reducing process cost and fabricating tandem and flexible solar cells. The technology can reduce the process cost and raise manufacture throughput without using time-consuming sintering and cooling processes. During the fabrication of high efficiency tandem solar cells using perovskite solar cells as a top cell of the monolithic structure in combination with Si,21–29 CuInGaSe (CIGS),30–37 Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS),38 and narrow band gap perovskite bottom cells,39–43 the preparation of the top cell including metal oxide layers often requires low-temperature processes to avoid thermal damage to the lower layers and bottom cells. For the same reason, inverted structure-type perovskite cells (employed in tandem top cells) require low temperature for preparing metal oxide top layers if they are used as electron collectors or transparent conductors. Low process temperature is a prerequisite for fabricating flexible lightweight perovskite devices. In the case of using plastic substrates, the most widely used polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films are stable at temperatures lower than 180 °C and to avoid thermal shrinkage of the film, the process temperature should be lower than 150 °C. In this aspect, we have so far developed methods of metal oxide preparation for PSCs using, for example, binder-free brookite TiO2 nano-particles combined with low-temperature prepared SnO2 and TiO2 CLs.10,44–47 Our method has enabled the fabrication of flexible mesoscopic PSCs based on a plastic substrate with conversion efficiency up to 13.4%.10 However, the conversion efficiency is still low and thus, further development of the low-temperature process is required. An issue in low-temperature metal oxide preparation is the amorphous property of the metal oxide CL, which requires precise adjustment of the thickness of a considerably thin film (<10 nm)47 because of low conductivity and high carrier trap density. Carrier transport properties of such crystalline and amorphous metal oxides can be controlled by doping other metal ions such as indium tin oxide (ITO), NiO,48,49 and ZnO.50 Some metal oxides doped with heterometal ions such as Li-doped TiO2,51,52 Zn-doped TiO2,53 Y-doped TiO2,54 Nb-doped TiO2,55–58 Na-treated TiO2,59 K-doped TiO2,60 Sm-doped TiO2,61 Li-doped SnO2,62 Nb-doped SnO2,63 Y-doped SnO2,64 Li-doped ZnO,50 La-doped BaSnO3,65 NiMgLiOx,58 NiMgOx,66 and Cs:NiOx67 have been reported as n-type or p-type semiconductors for carrier transporting layers in PSCs. As a challenge, we have focused on amorphous Nb-doped titanium oxide as an appropriate candidate for low-temperature prepared CLs. Hasegawa et al. accurately studied crystalline Nb-doped TiO2 (c-Nb/TiO2) as a promising alternative to transparent conducting oxide (TCO) materials.68–70 Nb(V) ion has comparable ionic radius (0.064 nm) with that of Ti(IV) ion (0.061 nm) and can easily form solid solution with TiO2.71 Nb ion behaves as an n-type dopant for TiO2 and significantly enhances electron conductivity. PSCs using Nb-doped TiO2 CLs sintered above 500 °C have been reported.55,57 Liu et al. have also reported Nb-doped titanium oxide as CL in planar-type PSCs, and these PSCs have achieved more than 19% conversion efficiency;56 they also prepared CL by a dipping method, and the CL was sintered at 185 °C, but this temperature is still higher than the appropriate temperature required for our target. Han et al. first reported an amorphous Nb/TiOx film as a hole-blocking layer in an inverted-type PSC.58 In the PSC, the Nb/TiOx film was cast on an electron-extracting PCBM layer and dried at 70 °C. By Nb-doping, the resistivity of the amorphous TiOx film was significantly decreased, and the resulting conversion efficiency was improved.
Here we report preparation of an amorphous niobium-doped titanium oxide (Nb/TiOx) film at dry temperature of 100 and 130 °C for two different perovskites as a compact layer in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells; these are the annealing temperatures of the corresponding perovskite layers. In our process design strategy, “low-temperature” condition means that the temperature range is not higher (or lower) than the temperatures employed for perovskite preparation and annealing. The perovskite layers we prepared were dual cation-halide perovskites (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3, which exhibited high stability against heat and durable efficiency.
Results and discussion
Characterization of Nb-doped TiOx compact layer
We prepared TiOx films without and with Nb ion (doping ratios: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5%) as CLs of PSCs. To clarify the result, only non-doped and the most Nb-ion doped (5%) CLs were characterized and compared by XRD and XPS measurements. First, we observed surface SEM images of TiOx CLs dried at 100 °C and sintered at 500 °C, as shown in Fig. S1.† The surface of amorphous TiOx CL dried at 100 °C seemed to be smooth, and the top and edges of the FTO surface had fuzzy textures. We could not observe any pinholes and cracks on the top and bottom of the FTO crystals. In contrast, at the surface of high-temperature sintered CL, small crystal grains appeared, and the shape of the FTO grains was sharp. Such granular particles possess grain boundaries, and such sharp FTO crystal edges expose bare FTO surfaces, which indicated electronic pinholes.
Then, the obtained CLs were characterized by grazing incident (GI)-XRD measurements. Fig. 1a shows normal and GI-XRD patterns of (5%) Nb/TiOx and TiOx films (film thickness > 100 nm) dried at 100 °C on an FTO substrate. For both films, diffraction peaks corresponding to anatase (101) and rutile (110) TiO2 at 2θ = 25.4 and 27.4°, respectively, were not observed, indicating the presence of amorphous metal oxide films.

(c) I–V curves of ITO/CL (<10 nm)/Au device dried at 100 °C with Nb-doped TiOx. Inset: schematic illustration of the measured device. (d) Transmittances of TiOx and (5%) Nb/TiOx CLs on FTO substrates with different thicknesses, dried at 100 °C. 
We confirmed the presence of Nb atom in a TiOx film by XPS spectroscopic measurement. Fig. 1b shows XPS spectra of TiOx and (5%) Nb/TiOx CL films dried at 100 °C (Fig. S2† shows XPS spectra of films dried at 150 °C). Both films showed characteristic peaks assigned to Ti and O atoms of TiOx. The peak position of Ti 2p orbital was observed at a similar position of 459.3 eV in both CL films, and this observation matched with that for Ti(IV) of TiO2 (458.5 eV). Only in the Nb/TiOx film, the Nb 3d peak appeared at 207.5 eV, and this result matched with that for Nb(V) of Nb2O5. Therefore, based on XRD and XPS results, we concluded that Ti and Nb atoms in the CL film were retained in the fully oxidized state, but they were not crystallized.

Fig. 1c shows I–V curves of ITO/CL/Au samples (sample configuration is shown inset) to evaluate series resistivities of CLs of TiOx and 5% Nb-doped TiOx on ITO substrates dried at 100 °C. Film thicknesses of CLs are less than 10 nm. By Nb-doping, the resistivity of the CL was decreased. Because of very thin film thicknesses, there is no significant difference in their resistances.
Next, we observed the film properties of CLs by I–V and transmittance measurements. Fig. 1d shows transmittances of TiOx and (5%) Nb/TiOx CLs on an FTO substrate dried at 100 °C with thicknesses of 50, 100, and 150 nm (transmittances of 130 and 150 °C-dried films are shown in Fig. S4†). The transmittance of the FTO/CL was changed depending on the film thickness of the CL. In contrast, there is no change in the transmittance by drying temperature and Nb doping, as shown in Fig. 1c and S4.† Within the UV-vis spectral region from 350 to 600 nm, thinner CLs presented lower transmittances. This was because the light was incident from the FTO (CL) side, and the light was reflected and scattered at the FTO surface. After increasing the CL thickness, the FTO surface texture was flattened, resulting in reduced scattering and reflection. In contrast, at a wavelength longer than 700 nm, the transmittance of the thick film decreased with the increasing CL thickness due to light absorbance.
We attempted to obtain carrier concentrations in the Nb/TiOx films by Hall-effect measurement. However, because of the very high sheet resistances of the amorphous TiOx films, we could not obtain correct information regarding carrier density in the TiOx films (Fig. S5†).
Photovoltaic properties of mixed perovskite-based PSCs
First, to optimize the Nb/TiOx CL fabrication process, we employed (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (FA-MA) perovskite as a light absorber because we have always developed PSCs based on this material, and we can prepare highly efficient photovoltaic devices.73 We used brookite TiO2 nano-particles as a mesoporous layer, which can provide highly efficient PSCs by a low-temperature process, where the temperature is lower than 150 °C.10,44–47 By changing the spin-coating speed, we controlled the thicknesses of Nb/TiOx CLs (Fig. S6†). The thicknesses of CLs were 40, 70, and 100 nm. Fig. S7† shows photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves; the PV data is summarized in Table S1† for FA-MA perovskite-based devices with different thick CLs dried at 150 °C. With the decreasing CL thickness, the photocurrent density significantly improved, and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the device based on a 40 nm-thick CL reached approximately 21 mA cm−2. VOC values of the three conditions were almost similar and ranged from 1.13 to 1.16 V. The best conversion efficiency of 17.3% was achieved on the 40 nm-thick CL-based device in reverse scan, which was simply attributed to the low resistivity of thinner CL; this resulted in higher fill factor (FF) and JSC values. Then, we examined the influences of dry temperature of the substrate (CL/mesoporous layer) at 100 and 150 °C. For both devices based on brookite TiO2 mesoporous films and Nb/TiOx CLs, J–V characteristics in reverse scans (VOC → JSC) did not present large differences in conversion efficiencies independent of the process temperature. Average efficiencies of approximately 16% were achieved. In contrast, in forward scan of the PSC prepared at 100 °C, the JSC and VOC values were almost similar, but the fill factor significantly deteriorated; thus, the hysteretic width increased, as shown in Fig. S7.† For the control TiOx-based device, significantly wide hysteretic behaviours were also observed for both devices prepared at 100 and 150 °C. Compared with PSCs based on (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite and high-temperature sintered TiO2 CL without Nb-doping, the low-temperature processed devices presented slightly higher conversion efficiencies due to high VOC values.75
Next, we changed the doping ratio of Nb ion from 1 to 5 mol% in TiOx CLs, and we prepared PSCs using CLs. Photovoltaic parameters of PSCs are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The average JSC values ranged from ca. 20 to 21 mA cm−2, and the average VOC values of all devices ranged from 1.05 to 1.16 V. VOC of the (1%) Nb/TiOx CL-based cell was slightly decreased compared to that of the non-doped TiOx CL-based cell. With the increasing Nb-doping ratio, VOC gradually improved and at the doping ratio of 4%, it reached a maximum value of 1.15 V; for the 5%-doped cell, VOC decreased again. All the devices showed hysteretic J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 2a. The onset wavelengths of incident photon-to-current (IPCE) spectra of all cells matched well at 800 nm (Fig. 2b), and the integrated photocurrent ranged from 19 to 21 mA cm−2; these results were in agreement with JSC values of the J–V curves. The hysteresis width changed depending on the Nb-doping ratio (Fig. 2c, FF). With the increasing Nb-doping ratio, the extent of hysteresis width gradually decreased, resulting in improved FF in both forward and reverse scans. At 4% Nb-doping, the hysteresis width was minimized. When more (5 mol%) Nb ion was added, the hysteresis width increased again. As a result, the best conversion efficiency was obtained with 4% Nb-doped TiOx CL. The best conversion efficiency of 19.1% with JSC of 21.73 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.15 V, and FF of 0.76 in the reverse scan was achieved in the cell with an aperture area of 5 × 5 mm2, as shown in Fig. 2c. The best conversion efficiency of 19.6% was obtained for a PSC based on a (4%) Nb/TiOx CL dried at 150 °C (in Fig. S8 and Table S2†). For the PSCs dried at 150 °C, the influence of Nb-dope amount on photovoltaic properties was smaller than the PSCs dried at 100 °C.

Then, we replaced the FA-MA perovskite layer with FA- and Cs-mixed perovskite FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 (FA-Cs) as a highly stable and efficient light absorbing material. Because the best conversion efficiency of a FA-Cs PSC device, prepared using high temperature, was achieved at an annealing temperature of 130 °C in our preliminary study (see ESI, Fig. S9, S10 and Table S3†), Nb-doped TiOx CL and brookite TiO2 mesoporous layer were dried at 130 °C. A doping ratio of 4% was examined because of the result of FA-MA perovskite, and TiOx and 5% Nb-doped TiOx were also used for comparison. Considering the result of FA-MA perovskite, the thickness of CL was maintained at less than 40 nm.
Photovoltaic properties of FA-Cs PSCs based on TiOx, and 4% and 5% Nb-doped TiOx CLs are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 3. The three PSCs showed similar JSC and VOC values, independent of Nb-doping ratio. For all devices, JSC values of up to 25 mA cm−2 were obtained (Fig. 3a), which was higher than that of the FA-MA device because of the narrower band gap in FA-Cs perovskite. The IPCE onsets for the FA-Cs PSCs reached approximately 860 nm (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the maximum VOC value was approximately 1.05 V, which was slightly lower than that of FA-MA devices. Devices based on a non-doped TiOx CLs showed very large hystereses and low fill factors due to the high series resistance (Rs) of 35 ± 6 Ω in J–V curves among the three entries (Fig. 3a and c, and Table 2). At 4% Nb-doping, the hysteresis drastically decreased, and Rs reduced to 20 ± 1 Ω. However, when the doping ratio increased to 5%, hysteresis increased slightly similar to that in the FA-MA devices, and FF decreased, which was attributed to increase in Rs (30 ± 6 Ω). As a result, the PSC based on (4%) Nb/TiOx CL showed the best conversion efficiency of 19.8% with JSC of 24.22 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.08 V, and FF of 0.75 in the reverse scan, and it showed a conversion efficiency of 17.8% with JSC of 24.44 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.05 V, and FF of 0.69 in the forward scan. Nb-doped CL (4%) showed the highest efficiencies for both FA-MA and FA-Cs perovskite-based devices, regarded independent on the type of perovskites. Also, the perovskite layers were not connected to CL, because of the separation by dense TiO2 mesoporous layers based on finely small nano-particles (Fig. S11†); therefore, it is expected that the influence of Nb-doping affected the interfaces between FTO and TiOx CL, and/or TiOx CL and the mesoporous layer. Nb alkoxide is more reactive than Ti alkoxide; therefore, interfaces among FTO, CL, and mesoporous layers were connected tightly by reactive Nb ions. Above 5% doping, the Rs value increased again. It is expected that excess Nb ions significantly distorted the structure of ion positions in the TiOx film.

To obtain information about carrier dynamics, we observed the steady-state photocurrent density and performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on FA-Cs PSCs based on TiOx and (4%) Nb/TiOx CLs. Fig. 4a shows time courses of steady-state photocurrent density of FA-Cs PSCs based on TiOx and (4%) Nb/TiOx CLs measured under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) with voltage bias at Vmax. For the TiOx-based cell, after light on, the photocurrent density increased slowly and gradually and even after 200 s, the photocurrent density reached approximately 18 mA cm−2; however, it was not still saturated, and the calculated power out-put of 14.9% was lower compared with the photocurrent density of 21.6 mA cm−2 and power out-put of 16.6% obtained from the J–V measurement. This very slow light response was responsible for the large hysteresis in the J–V curve. Uchida and Segawa reported that internal capacitance of PSCs is responsible for J–V hysteresis.73 Previously, we confirmed that even a FTO/TiO2 CL device exhibited J–V hysteresis, and we concluded that TiO2 CL largely contributed to hysteresis behaviors in PSCs.74 By Nb-doping in TiO2, improvement in conductivity, increase in carrier density, and expansion of lattice parameters68–70,72 have been reported, and it is expected that such factors affect the change in J–V hysteresis. In contrast, photocurrent density of (4%) Nb/TiOx quickly responded to light irradiation and saturated before 100 s. The photocurrent density exceeded 20 mA cm−2, and the out-put power reached 18.0%, which agreed with the results obtained from the J–V curves (22.45 mA cm−2 and 19.8%, respectively).

Fig. 4b shows recombination resistivities (Rrec) of FA-Cs PSCs based on TiOx and (4%) Nb/TiOx CLs, which are estimated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark with different bias voltages. The Rrec values of two FA-Cs PSCs do not present significant difference in the blocking properties for carrier recombination. Considering Rs and Rrec of TiOx- and (4%) Nb/TiOx CL-based devices, the improvement of FF by Nb-doping is attributed to reduction in the series resistivity of CL and/or interfacial resistivity between the brookite TiO2 mesoporous layer and CL.
Finally, we examined the device durability for a non-encapsulated FA-Cs cell based on Nb/TiOx CL by continuous light irradiation and steady-state photocurrent measurement in ambient atmosphere: T = 26 °C and RH > 25%. Fig. 5 shows J–V curves before and after 1 h measurements, and it also shows steady-state photocurrent with 0.84 V bias voltage (Vmax) under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) light irradiation. Initially, photocurrent density of 21.0 mA cm−2 corresponding to stabilizing efficiency of 17.6% was observed. This efficiency matched well with the efficiency of 17.7% in the J–V measurement. After 1 h power generation at Pmax, the photocurrent density decreased to 17.6 mA cm−2 corresponding to 14.8% stabilizing efficiency, which resulted in retention of 85% of the initial efficiency. The conversion efficiency of 14.8% obtained from steady-state photocurrent measurement was slightly smaller than 15.7% obtained from J–V measurement. This is attributed to a shift in Vmax position during measurement. After the tested sample was stored in dark and dry conditions overnight, the conversion efficiency was recovered.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully developed a simple low-temperature process for highly efficient and durable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells based on Nb-doped amorphous TiOx CL and brookite TiO2 nano-particles, and we limited the process temperature to a temperature lower than the annealing temperature of perovskite films. Resistivity of the Nb-doped film decreased with the increasing Nb-doping ratio. By XRD and XPS measurements, it was confirmed that CL is amorphous, and Ti and Nb ions in CL are in +4 and +5 oxidation states, respectively, similar to that observed for crystalline metal oxides.
PSCs based on FA-MA and FA-Cs perovskites both presented the best conversion efficiencies using a 4% Nb-doped TiOx CL. The PSC based on a 100 °C-dried substrate and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite and with 5 × 5 mm2 aperture area achieved the best conversion efficiency of 19.1%. By replacing the perovskite by FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 and a 130 °C-dried substrate, the best efficiency of 19.8% was obtained. The FA-Cs-based cell showed significant device stability. The PSC retained 85% efficiency after 1 h light irradiation by AM 1.5G 1 sun light, and it exhibited 0.84 V bias on a non-encapsulated device.
There is still room for improving the conversion efficiency with the help of different metal-ion dopants, accurate thickness, and preparation temperature optimizations. Such an attempt is now under way.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry CO., Ltd. (TCI), Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd, and Sigma-Aldrich Japan. All perovskite materials cesium iodide, ammonium salts (FAI and MABr), and lead halides (PbI2 and PbBr2) were of perovskite grade (TCI). Spiro-OMETAD was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents were of super dehydrated grade (Wako). All chemicals were applied to the experiments without further purification. FTO glass substrates and an aqueous suspension of brookite TiO2 nano-particles (PECC-B01) were obtained from Peccell Technologies, Japan.
Preparation of perovskite solar cells

(Nb-doped) TiOx compact layer and TiO2 mesoporous layer. 
Device fabrication was carried out under dry conditions (dew point < −20 °C). TiOx and Nb-doped TiOx (Nb/TiOx) films were prepared by the spin coating method with an EtOH solution of mixture of [Ti(i-PrO)4] and [Nb(EtO)5] (100:0–95:5/mol%) for 30 s at arbitrary spin speed. The as-prepared film was dried at 100, 130, and 150 °C for 1 h to obtain amorphous Nb/TiOx CLs.
For CL, an ethanolic suspension of brookite TiO2 nano-particles (18:1, v/v) was spin-coated and dried at the same temperature as that for the scaffold CLs to obtain low-temperature prepared mesoporous substrates under ambient conditions.


(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite and hole transport layers. 
A 1.5 M solution of FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 in a mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1 v/v) was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h. The solution was put on a mesoscopic substrate and spin coated by rotation speed as follows: 30 s before spin start, 3000 rpm/30 s, accelerated to 6000 rpm/30 s during quick spin; 300 μL of chlorobenzene was casted onto the perovskite film. Then, the as-prepared film was annealed using pot-roast vapour-assisted anneal technique.73 The perovskite film was put into a Petri dish and annealed at 100 °C for 15 min; the Petri dish was removed, and the film was annealed for 5 min. A 7 wt% chlorobenzene solution of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) with LiTSFI (0.035 M) in acetonitrile, TBP (0.231 M), and FK209 PF6 salt (0.002 M) in acetonitrile (molar ratio 1:0.5:3.3:0.03) were added to the perovskite by spin coating (3000 rpm for 30 s), and this was kept under dry and dark conditions overnight. Finally, gold was vacuum-evaporated as the counter electrode.


FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite and hole transport layers. 
A 1.2 M solution of FAI, CsI, and PbI2 in a mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1 v/v) was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h. The solution was put on a mesoscopic substrate and spin coated: 30 s before spin start, 3000 rpm/30 s, accelerated to 6000 rpm/30 s during the quick spin; 300 μL of chlorobenzene was cast onto the perovskite film. Then, the as-prepared film was vapour-assisted annealed at 130 °C in a Petri dish for 10 min; the Petri dish was removed, and the film was annealed for 5 min. A chlorobenzene solution of spiro-OMeTAD with additives was placed on the perovskite, and gold was vacuum-evaporated as the counter electrode.

Measurements

SEM and XRD measurements. 
SEM measurements were performed on an SU8000 (Hitachi High-Technologies Co.) XRD patterns were measured on a D8 DISCOVER (Bruker-AXS K. K.) with Cu-Kα radiation under operating conditions of 40 kV, 40 mA.


Resistivity measurements. 
CL casted on an FTO substrate similar to that for PSC was prepared. On CL, Au was vacuum-deposited as an electrode. Sample structures are presented in Fig. 2a for ITO/thin CL and in Fig. S3† for FTO/thick CL. I–V measurement was carried out under similar conditions as those for the PSC device (see below).


Photovoltaic measurements. 
Cell active area (5 × 5 mm2) was defined by a black metal mask. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a PEC-L01 solar simulator (Peccell Technologies) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Measurement conditions were as follows: step voltage: 0.01 V, search delay: 0.05 s, and hold time: 0.1 s. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were observed by a PEC-S20 spectrometer (Peccell Technologies).


XPS measurements. 
XPS spectra were measured using an AXIS Nova (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (150 W), and the pass-energy of the spectrometer was set to 160 or 40 eV for the survey or core spectrum measurement, respectively.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. 
EIS measurements were performed using an SI 1287 electrochemical interface and SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Toyo Technica). The measurements were carried out under dark conditions with different bias voltages. Rrec values were calculated from the obtained Nyquist plot data by curve fitting using the Z-plot software.


Hall-effect measurements. 
Hall-effect measurement was carried out using a self-made system consisting of a 0.5 T permanent magnet, a Keithley 6220 DC current source, 2182A nanovoltmeter and 7001 switching system with 7065 Hall Effect Card. TiOx samples were prepared on glass substrates. TiOx film thickness was approximately 7 nm, and the sample size was 1.25 × 1.25 cm2. Electrodes were contacted at each corner and measured between diagonal corners.
