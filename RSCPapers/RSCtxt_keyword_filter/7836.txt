    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 17th September 2020AbstractDeveloping dopant-free hole transporting materials (HTMs) and passivating defects in perovskite films are two significant themes to realize efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared to various individual endeavors for either of them, enabling both via a single material is more interesting but certainly challenging. In this report, we develop dopant-free polymer HTMs bearing amino pendants as passivating groups for improved efficiency and stability of PSCs. The bifunctional polymers present simultaneous main-chain (donor–acceptor conjugated backbone) hole extraction/transport and side-chain (amino group) defect passivation at the perovskite/HTM interface. Moreover, with an increased content of amino pendants, the polymers exhibit enhanced hole mobility and defect passivation ability, advancing device efficiency and stability. As a result, PSCs using the dopant-free polymer HTM achieve an efficiency approaching 19%, with impressive stability when testing at a relative humidity of 85%, by heat at 80 °C, or under continuous light illumination. This work demonstrates that amino functionalization at the side chain of polymers is a promising method to develop dopant-free HTMs accompanied by defect passivation effects for high-performance and durable PSCs.
1. Introduction
Hole transporting materials (HTMs) are indispensable elements in high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for extracting and collecting holes from the perovskite layer to the electrode.1–7 To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is still the most widely used HTM to achieve high device efficiencies.8–10 However, Spiro-OMeTAD is subject to an amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition during the device operation and necessitates hydrophilic dopants, which lowers the long-term stability of PSCs.11–17 Many alternatives, in particular those with no need for dopants, have thus been developed, including small molecules, polymers and inorganic compounds.18–28 Among them, dopant-free donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer HTMs are marked by strong intermolecular interactions, high charge carrier mobility, and good thermal and photochemical stability.24,29–34
On the other hand, various defects including vacancies, interstitials, and antisites are present at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) in solution-processed perovskite films.35 In particular, the defects such as undercoordinated Pb2+ reside at the perovskite/HTM interface, inducing severe non-radiative charge recombination and thus lowered efficiency and accelerated degradation of PSCs.36–39 In this regard, various additional passivation strategies on the perovskite surface have been employed.40–43 However, most of the HTMs that are directly deposited on the perovskite layer are helpless for defect passivation.
Therefore, it is of great interest to develop dopant-free D–A polymer HTMs bearing passivating groups, realizing rapid hole extraction/transport and effective defect passivation at the same time. The passivating groups can be various Lewis acids and bases, which can interact with those undercoordinated ionic defects on the surface of the perovskite layer.35,44 Among them, the amino group has been demonstrated efficient to passivate undercoordinated Pb2+ defects of the perovskite thanks to the presence of lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen atom.45–47 It has been incorporated into the electron transporting layer to passivate perovskite surface defects for p–i–n PSCs with enhanced photovoltaic performances.48,49 However, the introduction of the amino group into dopant-free polymer HTMs for simultaneous hole transport and defect passivation in n–i–p PSCs has never been considered.50,51
In order to synthesize such amino-containing hole transporting polymers, the linking pattern of the amino group with the polymer should also be taken into account. In previous reports, ether and carbonyl as passivation groups were introduced into the conjugated backbone of a D–A polymer HTM to enhance PSC performance.23,29,43,52 However, those groups attached on the polymer backbone are wrapped by bulky side chains, limiting their passivation effect on the interfacial defects. Instead, incorporating passivating groups at the terminal of outstretched polymer side chains can increase their ability to interact with defects on the surface of the perovskite layer.
In this work, we report a series of amino-pended D–A polymers as dopant-free HTMs with the passivation function for efficient and stable PSCs. These polymers, on one hand, possess the same backbone as a highly efficient donor polymer (PTB7) for organic photovoltaics, with good hole transporting properties;53,54 on the other hand, they contain amino groups at the terminal of side chains with variable contents (0, 5, and 20% in mol). The resultant polymers (PBDT-Nx (x = 0, 5, 20), Fig. 1) thus feature simultaneous main-chain hole transport and adjustable side-chain passivation capability. It is found that these polymers exhibit closer packing and thus higher hole mobility with an increased amino ratio. Meanwhile, the amino pendant can effectively passivate the defects on the surface of the perovskite layer, resulting in the promotions of device efficiency and stability. Accordingly, PSCs based on the dopant-free PBDT-Nx as the HTM afford improved efficiencies with an increased amino ratio. The highest PCE of 18.9% is achieved from the dopant-free PBDT-N20-based device. Moreover, the stability of the champion device is also higher than that of counterparts based on PBDT-N0, PBDT-N5, and doped Spiro-OMeTAD under various harsh testing conditions such as storage at a relative humidity (RH) of 85%, heating at 80 °C, and continuous light illumination.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of PBDT-Nx polymers
The PBDT-Nx polymers were prepared according to a previous procedure. The molecular weights of polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran as the eluent, with Mn = 45.6 kg mol−1 (PDI = 1.94) for PBDT-N0, Mn = 41.4 kg mol−1 (PDI = 2.15) for PBDT-N5, and 58.0 kg mol−1 (PDI = 3.79) for PBDT-N20, respectively.55
2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington TEC 15) etched with Zn powder and 2 M HCl solution was washed with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol by sonicating for 30 min for each solvent, followed by treatment with oxygen plasma for 30 min. A compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2, 30–40 nm thick) was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by spray pyrolysis with precursor solution (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) diluted in ethanol (1:10 v/v)) at 500 °C and heated at 500 °C for 30 min in air. A mesoporous TiO2 layer (m-TiO2) was deposited by spin-coating diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) at 5000 rpm for 30 s (TiO2 paste:anhydrous ethanol = 1:6 by weight) and then heated at 500 °C for 1 hour in air. The mixed-ion perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving a mixture of FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO (4:1 v/v) at 65 °C for 1 hour. The perovskite films were then deposited on the prepared FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate by a two-step spin-coating method. The first step was carried out at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then the second step at 5000 rpm for 30 s. At the 10th second of the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was applied onto the substrate. After spin coating, the substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min.
Subsequently, the hole-transporting layer was prepared by spin-coating the HTM solution on the surface of the perovskite at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The dopant-free HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving the polymers of 8 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The prepared dopant-free HTM layer is ∼30 nm in thickness. The doped Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving a mixture of 73 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 20 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The 100 nm Au electrode was thermally evaporated on the surface of the HTM at an evaporation speed of 0.01 nm s−1 for the first 10 nm and of 0.08 nm s−1 for the rest of 90 nm under high vacuum (<7 × 10−4 Pa).
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded (2400 Series SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance generated by an Abet Class AAB sun 2000 simulator, with the intensity calibrated with an NREL calibrated KG5 filtered Si reference cell. A black mask with a circular aperture (0.05 cm2) smaller than the active area of the square solar cell (0.20 cm2) was applied on the top of the cell. The J–V curves were obtained from forward bias to short-circuit at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. For the measurements of hysteresis, J–V curves were obtained through forward scan (0–1.2 V) or reverse scan (1.2–0 V) at a rate of 10 mV s−1. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained using a solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). Prior to measurement, a standard silicon solar cell was used as a reference.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optoelectronic and hole-transporting properties of amino-polymers
The PBDT-Nx polymers are synthesized according to our previous procedures.55 They show high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures around 300 °C and no apparent glass transition temperatures, as detected by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1†) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S2†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PBDT-Nx calculated from the CV results are around −5.45 eV (Fig. 2a and S3†), located between the valence band of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−5.65 eV) used here and the Au cathode (−5.00 eV).56 Meanwhile, their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (−3.81 to −3.93 eV) are higher than the conduction band of the mixed-ion perovskite (−4.05 eV). The energy levels of polymers indicate their suitability as the HTM in PSCs, able to effectively extract holes from the perovskite and block electrons transferring from the perovskite to the Au electrode.

Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of these polymers in chlorobenzene solutions and in films are depicted in Fig. 2b and c. In solution, PBDT-N0 displays a maximum absorption (λmax) at 677 nm originating from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, with a vibronic band peaking at 626 nm.20,57 Interestingly, with an increased amino content, PBDT-N5 and PBDT-N20 show slightly blue-shifted λmax and absorption onset but much stronger vibronic absorptions. Since the amino-containing repeating unit in PBDT-N5 and PBDT-N20 possesses completely the same fluorine- and ester-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and alkyl chain as that in PBDT-N0, the backbone conjugation and the electronic structure of these polymers are almost not changed. The spectral variation can thus be ascribed to intermolecular non-covalent interactions most likely between the amino and the electron-withdrawing groups attached on the polymer main chains.58 In the film state, the intermolecular interactions become more obvious, reflected by broadened and red-shifted absorption bands (Fig. S4†) compared to the solution cases, which can be attributed to additional π–π interactions.29,30,59 More interestingly, the vibronic peak of PBDT-N5 and PBDT-N20 in the short wavelength range is more weakened in the film state, implying involvements of J-aggregates and H-aggregates in molecular packing, as depicted in the literature.60 Therefore, we believe that increasing the amino groups at the terminal of side chains could intensify the intermolecular packing of PBDT-Nx and potentially facilitate the charge transport.
In order to figure it out, two dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXD) measurement was carried out, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that all polymers show a clear (010) peak along the out-of-plane direction, indicating their face-on orientation in the film, which is favorable for vertical charge transport. For quantitative comparisons, the intensity of the (010) peak around 90° in the 2D GIXD patterns was integrated and plotted against the azimuthal angle (Fig. S5†) to study the orientation properties of the three polymer films. The peak becomes sharper with the introduction of amine groups, indicating stronger molecular orientation of the amino-containing polymers.61 Furthermore, the π–π stacking distance in the vertical direction has been calculated, which decreases from 3.97 Å to 3.82 Å (Table S1†) with an increased amino ratio (Fig. 3e).11,29 As speculated above, this could be induced by the interaction between the amino and the electron-withdrawing groups among adjacent polymers.58 The decreased π–π stacking distance of amino-functionalized polymers can facilitate the charge transport in their films. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement is thus carried out to detect their charge carrier mobility. As displayed in Fig. 3f and S6,† the hole mobility of PBDT-N20 is estimated to be 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, obviously higher than those of PBDT-N5 (1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PBDT-N0 (8.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the conductivity of the PBDT-Nx films (Fig. S7†) is also improved with an increased amino amount. These results suggest the high suitability of the amino-functionalized polymers as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.

3.2 Defect-passivation properties of amino-polymers
After evidencing the effect of the amino group on the packing behavior and hole mobility of PNDT-Nx, we next verify their interactions with unpaired lead ions to passivate defect traps on the surface of the perovskite film. First, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to detect the interaction between amino groups and PbI2. In order to exclude the influence of other atoms/groups in the polymer, N,N-dimethylbutylamine (DMBA) was chosen as a model compound to blend with PbI2 in different ratios. Without PbI2, the proton peaks of methyl and methylene groups connected to N atoms in DMBA appear at 2.09 and 2.16 ppm. With the increase of the PbI2 amount, such peaks gradually shift to the low field (Fig. 4a and b), resulting from the deshielding effect on the amino groups owing to the coordination interaction between Pb2+ as a Lewis acid and electron-rich N atoms.62,63
 Fig. 4  (a) 1H NMR spectra of the mixture of DMBA and PbI2 with different ratios in DMSO-d6. (b) Enlarged part of the red rectangular in (a); inset: schematic illustration of coordination interaction between undercoordinated Pb2+ and the amino group. (c) Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of perovskite films without treatment and with the deposition of DMBA or PBDT-Nx. 
The passivation effect is then investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements, performed at 760 nm (Fig. 4c). The average decay lifetime (τave) of the pristine perovskite film is about 1190.0 ns, which is prolonged after treatment with DMBA containing the amino group (1359.6 ns), indicating that the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite film can be suppressed by the amino-functionalized compound.64 On the other hand, in the case of the PBDT-N0 (without the amino group) treated perovskite film, the τave (1001.5 ns) is shorter than that of the pristine perovskite film, indicative of efficient hole extraction from the perovskite to the polymer. Thus, it can be predicted that the amino-functionalized PBDT-N5 and PBDT-N20 can have a synergistic effect of side-chain (amino pendants) interface passivation and main-chain (conjugated D–A backbones) hole extraction on the τave of the perovskite film. Specially, the PBDT-N5/perovskite sample exhibits a slightly shorter τave (608.7 ns) than the PBDT-N0/perovskite, while the PBDT-N20/perovskite gives an even lower value of 249.9 ns. The decreased TRPL lifetime can be explained by better hole extraction of the amino-functionalized polymers because the increased amino groups facilitate an interfacial contact between the perovskite and polymer HTM, as a result of stronger passivation effects of the amino group on the undercoordinated Pb2+ on the surface of the perovskite layer. Meanwhile, the higher hole mobility of PBDT-N20 than the other two polymers, as mentioned above, can also improve the hole extraction/transport. The same trend is observed in the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as shown in Fig. S8.† These results demonstrate that the polymers grafted with amino groups could simultaneously reduce the surface defects and facilitate hole extraction from the perovskite film.
3.3 Device performances of dopant-free amino-polymers
To assess the potential of PBDT-Nx as dopant-free HTMs, solar cells with an n–i–p device configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au (Fig. 5a) were fabricated and measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The detailed device fabrication process is described in the ESI.† The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device is given in Fig. 5b, showing a highly crystalline perovskite and uniform polymer HTM layer (∼30 nm thick). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs based the HTMs are shown in Fig. 5c and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Dopant-free Spiro-OMeTAD is also used as a HTM to fabricate a reference device, showing a PCE of only 10.1%. When employing PBDT-Nx as HTMs, the devices yield continually improved PCEs of 12.4% (PBDT-N0), 15.5% (PBDT-N5), and 18.9% (PBDT-N20), respectively, with an increased amino amount. In particular, the result achieved from PBDT-N20 approaches that of the device based on doped Spiro-OMeTAD (19.6%). The increase of amino pendants in PBDT-Nx results in continuous improvements of all photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF)) ascribed to the synergistic effect of the surface defect passivation and improved hole transport capacity of the amino-functionalized polymer HTMs, as previously demonstrated. Fig. 5d presents the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) and integrated Jsc of the PBDT-Nx based devices, which match well with values obtained from J–V curves. The hysteresis index of the PBDT-Nx-based devices reduces with the increased amino groups in the polymer, because of stronger hole extraction and defect passivation abilities in the case of a higher amino ratio (Table 1 and Fig. S9†).16,65 These PBDT-Nx-based cells provide stable photovoltaic performances as measured at the maximum power point (MPP) for 500 s under one-sun irradiation (Fig. 5e and S10†). The histogram of PCE distribution of the devices (Fig. 5f) indicates that the PBDT-N20-based device also presents better device reproducibility than the others.

The charge recombination in the devices was investigated by detecting Jsc and Voc as a function of varying light illumination intensity (Plight) from 10 to 100 mW cm−2. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can generally be expressed as Jsc ∝ Plightα, following the power-law dependence. The α value of the PBDT-N20 device (0.992) is closest to one compared to that of others (0.948 for PBDT-N5 and 0.920 for PBDT-N0, Fig. 6a), indicating the lowest bimolecular recombination at the interface between the perovskite layer and PBDT-N20.5,66 This is in good agreement with the highest Jsc of the PBDT-N20 device under short-circuit conditions among the devices based on PBDT-Nx. Under open-circuit conditions, the slope of Vocversus lnPlight equals kT/q if bimolecular recombination dominates (k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge), while it approaches 2kT/q for Shockley–Reed–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination.35,66 As shown in Fig. 6b, the slope of the PBDT-N20 device is 1.42kT/q, lower than those of PBDT-N5 (1.61kT/q) and PBDT-N0 (1.83kT/q) devices. The smallest slope implies the lowest trap-assisted recombination in the PBDT-N20 devices under open-circuit conditions. The suppressed charge recombination can be assigned to the effective defect passivation on the perovskite surface, contributed by amino groups suspended at the terminal of the PBDT-Nx side chain. To further gain insight into the charge transfer kinetics of the devices, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at the same voltage (0.6 V) in the frequency range from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz under one-sun illumination. The results are displayed in Fig. 6c, where semicircles in the high and low frequency regions represent the charge transfer and transportation resistance (Rct) and the recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. At the same given potential, for the devices based on PBDT-Nx, the Rct decreases and the Rrec increases with an increased amino content in the polymer HTMs. Hence, among the three kinds of devices, the PBDT-N20-based PSC presents the most effective hole transport leading to the highest FF and lowest charge recombination resulting in the highest Voc.23,67

The long-term stability of these devices without encapsulation based on dopant-free PBDT-Nx was tracked under stresses of humidity (stored under a constant RH of 85%), heat (at 80 °C in a glove box), and light illumination (under constant AM 1.5G illumination in a glove box), respectively. The three kinds of aging tests clearly show that the dopant-free PBDT-Nx-based devices present obviously better stability than the Spiro-OMeTAD counterpart (Fig. 7). This is because, on one hand, the hydrophobic polymer HTM layer without hydrophilic dopants protects the perovskite film from moisture penetration compared to doped Spiro-OMeTAD and, on the other hand, the better thermal stability of PBDT-Nx than Spiro-OMeTAD as mentioned above offers a more stable morphology of the HTM film. Meanwhile, with the increase of the amino pendants in PBDT-Nx, the stability of their devices rises continuously. The best cell based on the PBDT-N20 maintains over 95% of the original PCE in the aging tests of humidity, heat, and light illumination. The improved stability of the PBDT-N20-based device can be attributed to its higher amino content in the polymer, which passivates the surface defects of the perovskite film and lowers the charge recombination more efficiently than the other two cases as discussed before.35,68,69

The initial PCE values in these tests are around 11%, 13%, 15%, and 18% for dopant-free PBDT-N0, PBDT-N5, PBDT-N20 and doped Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a series of dopant-free polymer HTMs bearing amino groups (PBDT-Nx) for simultaneous hole transport and defect passivation in PSCs. The amino pendants, which are firstly used to functionalize D–A polymer HTMs, can not only enhance the polymer packing and thus the hole transporting capability, but also reduce the defect state at the perovskite/HTM interface. Accordingly, the PSCs based on these polymer HTMs offer improved device performance and stability with the increase of amino content. The dopant-free PBDT-N20-based devices exhibit the highest PCE of 18.9% approaching that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. Moreover, those devices without encapsulation retain over 95% of their initial PCEs for more than 1000 h under various aging conditions such as a constant RH of 85%, heating at 80 °C, and light illumination, strikingly outperforming their counterparts with dopant-free amino-absent polymers and doped Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. This work provides a promising strategy to design dopant-free polymer HTMs with the passivation function for efficient and stable PSCs.
