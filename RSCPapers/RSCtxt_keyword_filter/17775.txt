    , Accepted 19th February 2021First published on 4th March 2021AbstractNoble metal dichalcogenides (NMDs) are two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit outstanding thickness-dependent tunable-bandgaps that can be suitable for various optoelectronic applications. Here, we developed high-performance switching photodiodes based on mix-dimensional 2D palladium diselenide (PdSe2) and three-dimensional (3D) silicon (Si) heterojunctions with a broadband spectral response by a mechanical exfoliation technique. We studied the gate-tunable rectifying behavior of n-PdSe2/p-Si diodes employing an ionic liquid gate and achieved a maximum diode rectification ratio If/Ir up to ∼1.0 × 105 with the lowest value of ideality factor ∼1.22 (at Vtg = −2 V). At different temperatures (60 to 300 K), Zener tunneling and avalanche breakdown phenomena were detected at the junction of PdSe2–Si. These devices showed excellent self-driven photoresponses over broadband wavelengths from 400 to 1200 nm. The response speed of  estimated is 9.2/17.3 μs, which represents a fast photoresponse. Moreover, in our devices, open-circuit voltage (VOC = 0.6 V) switching behavior is attained with the on/off state of the incident light. Moreover, these devices were attested for dynamic rectification, and this effectively rectified an input alternating-voltage sine wave signal to an output signal. The results of this study indicate that 2D PdSe2 can be employed for high-performance optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as exciting materials and various applications comprising optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and sensors have been discovered.1–8 Inspired by TMD materials due to their attractive semiconducting and electronic properties, researchers have recently discovered novel noble-metal dichalcogenide (NMD)-based 2D materials.9–13 NMDs have a common formula MX2, where M is designated to Pd, while X is labeled to Se, and as a result of van der Waals (vdW) forces, individual layers are stacked together to form multilayers.14 NMDs show air stability and thickness-dependent optical bandgap such that there exists a transition from the semiconductor to the metal in both PdS2 and PdSe2 with sharp thickness modulation.15–18
Among NMDs, palladium diselenide (PdSe2) is the most promising one, emerging as an exciting 2D layered material with high electron motilities up to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1.19 PdSe2 can be mechanically exfoliated into a few layers or monolayers using an adhesive tape or a micromechanical cleavage method. PdSe2 nanoflakes exfoliated from single grown crystals have zero electron volt (eV) bandgap for bulk (metallic), while for monolayers (semiconductor) they show a bandgap of 1.4 eV.15 In contrast, mechanically exfoliated PdSe2 nanoflakes from a single-crystalline source show an indirect semiconductor (monolayer) with a bandgap of 1.37 eV, while in the bulk form they exhibit a bandgap of 0.5 eV as well as it was also claimed that the bandgap of PdSe2 modified from ∼1.37 to ∼0.7 eV as its thickness altered from 1 to 10 nm, and it remains nearly ∼0.5 eV for a thickness up to 130 nm.16 The crystal structure of PdSe2 is accomplished by pentagonal-structured layers, where Se–Pd–Se atoms are pentagonally packed with one sheet of Pd atoms and two sheets of Se atoms.19 PdSe2 is the attention of promising applications in infrared detectors for the future generation.20
The p–n junctions are the major parts of the most essential semiconductor devices, and they have been explored for several auspicious applications in devices such as photodetectors, a bipolar transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic cells.21–24 Previously reported p–n junctions, which are based on TMDs with conventional semiconductors, and the growth of 2D materials have been studied extensively.4 The p–n junctions based on the exfoliation of the 2D elemental system, i.e., NMDs with 3-dimensional (3D) bulk substrates, need considerable attention to exploring the field of nanotechnology. Here, we demonstrated a high-performance PdSe2/Si p–n junction, which is based on the mechanical exfoliation of PdSe2 nanoflakes from the bulk crystalline source. The p–n junction was fabricated by the exfoliation of multi-layer PdSe2 nanoflakes on a p-type silicon substrate without an oxide layer. Here, we confirmed that the electrical characteristics of p–n junction–based devices get better by annealing at a temperature of 200 °C for 4 h in the high vacuum of ∼10−6 Torr. At different attested temperatures, it was found that the Zener tunneling occurs at a low reverse bias voltage with a negative coefficient temperature, while avalanche breakdown occurs at a high reverse bias region with a positive coefficient of temperature. In this structure, we have utilized the ionic liquid top gate voltage to study the gate-dependent rectifying behavior at the p–n diode state. We have found that within variation in the small top gate voltage, the Fermi level can be tuned at the interface of the PdSe2/Si p–n diode. Devices that were measured at a different wavelength of incident light showed a broad photoresponse from the visible spectrum to the infrared range. A variation in the intensity of incident light in the p–n junction substantiated sound self-powered photovoltaic behaviors. The devices also showed output open-circuit voltage (VOC) switching behaviors upon illumination of the input light. This p–n diode is also demonstrated as a dynamic rectifier to convert an input alternating current (AC) sine wave signal into an output direct current (DC) signal, although the p–n junction is a basic element for most optoelectronic functions with auspicious applications in electronics and optoelectronics. However, based on the these investigations, we have found that our devices show better performance in electrical and photovoltaic characteristics than the above-mentioned p–n junctions, based on conventional, or TMD-based materials with a bulk Si substrate. The photo-sensing and electronic properties reveal that the working of the p–n junction has a superior photoresponse performance in contrast to formerly reported or commercially existing silicon photodiodes.25,26
Experimental section
Multi-layer PdSe2 nanoflakes were used to assemble p–n diodes on the p-type silicon substrates without an oxide layer. Initially, the p-type Si wafers were cleaned with acetone and methyl alcohol, and then dried under nitrogen (N2) gas flow. The p-type Si wafers used in our experiments have a value of resistivity (1–10 Ω cm). The PdSe2 nanoflakes were exfoliated from bulk crystals using an adhesive tape and dry-transferred using a PDMS stamp on the p-type Si substrates. The PdSe2 nanoflakes of different thicknesses were examined using an optical microscope. We fabricated Si/PdSe2 p–n junction devices by photolithography, atomic layer deposition (ALD), and e-beam lithography. Extra-large electrodes were made using a photolithography facility in a clean room and prepared an Al2O3 film with a thickness of 25 nm by ALD to prevent the leakage of current between electrodes and p-Si, and then samples were put into the thermal evaporator for Cr/Au (6/40 nm) metallization. For fine electrodes, e-beam lithography was performed to produce Al2O3 (25 nm) thick films underneath Sc/Au (8/100 nm) electrodes. After fabrication, to get a more clean interface, all devices were annealed at a temperature of 200 °C for 4 h in a high vacuum of ∼10−6. To identify the PdSe2 nanoflakes, the micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed with a spot size of the laser (λ = 514 nm) selected at 0.7 μm. The power of the laser beam was controlled at less than 0.1 mW to avoid inducing the heating effect of a laser during its operation. Commercial AFM was used for precise measurement of the thickness of PdSe2 nanoflakes. Electrical transport measurements were taken at temperatures (60 to 300 K) in a vacuum box. Laser light was used with a different wavelength (400 to 1200 nm). The photoresponse parameters were measured by using laser light (λ = 514 nm, 35.1, 62.3 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion
The schematic of PdSe2/Si mix-dimensional (2D/3D) p–n diode and the optical image of the device where the bulk PdSe2 nanoflake is placed on the Si substrate without any oxide layer are presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the combined AFM image of PdSe2 and Al2O3, which shows the corresponding step profile height in Fig. 1(d). The PdSe2 nanoflake and Al2O3 film have thicknesses of ∼30 and ∼25 nm, respectively. The micro-Raman spectrum of PdSe2 nanoflake on a p-type silicon substrate can be seen in Fig. 1(e). Four distinct Raman signatures were identified at ∼256, ∼222, ∼206, and ∼143 cm−1, which fit to phonon modes at A3g, B21g, A2g, and A1g – B11g respectively.19 For device fabrication, the PdSe2 material from bulk crystals was exfoliated with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp on the Si substrate and multilayer PdSe2 nanoflakes were selected to investigate their transfer curves. We have also measured the absorption spectra of the multilayer PdSe2/Si heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 1(f). Fig. 2(a) shows the schematic configuration, where an ionic liquid is used as a top gate voltage (Vtg). We investigated the n-type behavior of PdSe2 by measuring the output transpose curves (Ids–Vtg) of PdSe2 (in Fig. 2(b)). The on-current on the electron side enhanced from 30 to 55 μA with an increase in source–drain voltage from 0.5 to 1.5 V (Fig. 2(b)). The Sc/Au metal contacts showed ohmic contribution to PdSe2 flakes (Fig. 2(c)). The reason is that the Sc/Au metal contacts for n-type PdSe2 have a lower value of the work function (ϕ = 3.5 eV).27,28 Multi-layer PdSe2 nano-flakes with different thicknesses were exfoliated and dry transferred onto the surface of p-type silicon substrates. The p–n junction was fabricated due to the alignment of the Fermi levels as a result of conduction and valence bands offset between two materials. The schematic of Fermi level alignment is shown in the energy band diagrams of the PdSe2/Si p–n diode before and after contact (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). The bandgaps of Si and PdSe2 have attained 1.1 eV29 and 0.5 eV,16 respectively. The schematic of the energy band diagrams of the p–n diode at the unbiased case and forward bias can be seen in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. As most of the dry transfer techniques of exfoliated nanoflakes produced organic or polymer residues on crystal surfaces or between the interfaces, they can significantly reduce the efficiency of interlayer coupling that can further reduce the energy or charge transfer between adjacent layers;30 therefore, annealing becomes an essential step for the fabrication of van der Waals heterojunctions. Since water vapors can also exist between the interface of PdSe2 and Si substrates, the junction can be cleaned by annealing. Here, we have examined the effect of the annealing mechanism on an n-PdSe2/p-Si junction. First, we studied (Ids–Vtg) characteristics without annealing, and the obvious as-fabricated n-PdSe2/p-Si diode displays a typical rectifying behavior, but when the same device annealed for 4 h at different annealing temperatures in a high vacuum, ∼10−6 Torr, the electrical characteristics enhanced because of a cleaned interface of the PdSe2/Si p–n diode (in Fig. S1, ESI†). Hereafter, all devices were examined after employing annealing treatment. The output characteristics (Ids–Vds) of the PdSe2/Si van der Waals heterojunction can be illustrated by the following exponential relation:29  where T is the temperature, KB is the Boltzmann constant, q is the charge on an electron, and n is the ideality factor. In most of the p–n diodes, the recombination current constitutes due to charge carriers inside the space charge region near the junction interface while forward dark current establishes due to the transmission of carriers in neutral regions.29,31 In reverse bias, electrons needed an extra force to overcome the built-in potential barrier between two materials, and this may happen in two ways either under the illumination of light over the p–n junction so that photons are immersed into the junction and initiate to conduct or sufficient negative potential is applied so that another mechanism such as Zener tunneling increases the local density of states, which stimulates another transition. The schematic of the energy band diagram showing Zener tunneling is illustrated in Fig. 3e. Our PdSe2/Si, p–n junction showed rectifying behavior in reverse regimes for all attested temperatures. Under reverse bias voltage across the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode exhibited two distinct breakdown occurrences identified as Zener tunneling and avalanche breakdown. Once a diode is operated in a reverse bias regime, a small current flows and a junction can be considered as an open circuit.32 The current in the reverse bias regime increases abruptly if we increase the reverse bias voltage where dynamic resistance becomes too low, and this reverse voltage is recognized as the breakdown voltage (VB).32 Therefore, under (VB), in a p–n diode, both Zener tunneling and avalanche breakdown may exist. The criterion for the Zener diode is that the reverse breakdown voltage must be less than the value obtained using the following equation:  where e and Eg are the electronic charge and the bandgap of the semiconductors, respectively.31 For Si, Eg = 1.1 eV,29 while for PdSe2, Eg = 0.5 eV.16 For PdSe2 and Si, the value of 4Eg/e is 2 and 4.4 V, respectively. Zener tunneling governs at a smaller voltage with a rich doping level, where the potential barrier is very thin and causes quantum tunneling to occur. Whereas avalanche breakdown leads to a greater voltage with a small doping level, where the depletion region is reasonably long.32 To confirm the Zener tunneling and avalanche breakdown mechanism in the PdSe2/Si p–n diode, we studied the output characteristics (Ids–Vds) at different temperatures from 60 to 300 K (Vtg = 0 V). The n-PdSe2/p-Si diode shows Zener tunneling at all the temperatures (i.e., 60 to 300 K) within the small breakdown voltage from −2 to −4.5 V named the Zener breakdown voltage (VZB), while avalanche breakdown occurs at the temperatures (i.e., 180, 240 and 300 K) in the higher breakdown voltage from −11 to −14 V named avalanche breakdown voltage (VAB), as shown in Fig. 3(f) and (g). We found that VZB in the lower reverse bias regime decreased with an increase in temperature (i.e., VZB is related to a negative temperature coefficient). Hence, such a breakdown can be assigned to Zener breakdown.31,32 The (Ids–Vds) characteristics in the Zener breakdown regime are revealed in Fig. 3(f). The reason is that the Zener breakdown is caused by an electric field, which appropriately must be strong enough such that the valence electrons turn the energy gap (i.e., to excite electrons from the valence band) (EV to the conduction band (EV)). Since with the increase in temperature, the energy gap decreases, due to which the required electric field to turn valence electrons declines with the raised temperature; consequently, the required voltage (i.e., VZB) also decreases. In contrast, we found that VAB in the higher reverse bias regime increased with an increase in temperature (i.e.,VAB is related to a positive temperature coefficient). Thus, a breakdown can be assigned to an avalanche breakdown.31,32 The (Ids–Vds) characteristics in the avalanche breakdown regime are
revealed in Fig. 3(g). As the temperature rises, it causes a decrease in the mean free path of electrons due to an increase in thermal vibration. The mean free path can be defined as the primary electrons or holes that come to be accelerated strong enough to knock out electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. As the path length gets smaller, electrons or holes need a high electric field that must be stronger enough to turn the energy gap. To increase the electric field, one has to increase the voltage (i.e., VAB). Therefore, the VAB increases with the increase in temperature. As the avalanche breakdown happens at a greater voltage in the reverse bias regime, it may cause unrecoverable damage to the p–n junction. In contrast, a moderate current flows at Zener tunneling as compared to the avalanche breakdown for all attested temperatures. This is generally because the Zener breakdown is the result of tunneling mechanism and the material stops to conduct when the breakdown occurred, whereas avalanche breakdown is the consequence of multiplication outbreak of collisional ionization of charge carriers and the material continues to conduct even at voltages below VB. Since a stable photocurrent is required for photodiodes, it is more appropriate to employ the Zener breakdown.33

As in the case of mix-dimensional heterostructures such as PdSe2 (2D) and Si (3D bulk structure), there is an absence of gate-dependent rectifying effects.4,34–42 Here, we utilized the ionic liquid gate on top of the PdSe2/Si heterojunction to study the gate-dependent rectifying effect across the junction of Si andPdSe2. Ionic liquids have been widely considered as a top gate for various 2D-based FETs due to their low operational voltage with high electric fields at low bias voltages.43–45 The ionic liquid gate is a very simple and easy approach to attain a gating effect in the devices such as just we need to put some drops on the top of the materials. The PdSe2 nanoflake capped with a thick layer of an ionic liquid. The schematic design for the top gate is shown in Fig. 4(a). For the top gate probe, the indium wire was just dipped into the ionic liquid and it did not need additional device fabrication steps. The gate-dependent (Ids–Vds) characteristics of the p–n diode at various top gate ionic liquid voltages (Vtg) owing to the ultra-thin nature of PdSe2 showed that the drain current enhanced in the forward biased regime with an increase in the top gate voltage from −2.0 to +2.0 V, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The top gate-tunable (Ids–Vds) characteristics of the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode are shown on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 4(c). The current declined more rapidly in the reverse bias regime for top gate voltages (i.e., Vtg< 0) than the forward bias, which caused an increase in the rectification ratio (i.e., the ratio of forwarding current to reverse current at a fixed source–drain voltage of ±2 V) from ∼2.3 × 104 to ∼1.0 × 105 when Vtg changes from 0 to −2 V. In the forward bias regime, the rectification ratio decreases from ∼2.3 × 104 to ∼1.6 × 104 when Vtg changes from 0 to +2 V. The gate-tunable (Ids–Vds) characteristics of an n-PdSe2/p-Si diode is due to the ultra-thin nature of the junction. The reification ratio as a function of Vtg is shown in Fig. 4(d). The rectification ratio increased for the top gate voltages (i.e., Vtg < 0), as a result of the decrease in the reverse leakage current (i.e., the current due to minority charge carriers when diode operates in the reverse bias).46 Similarly, the rectifying behavior of the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode is illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†) at different top gate voltages. Consequently, the (Ids–Vds) characteristics of the n-PdSe2/p-Si junction can be modulated simply by varying the top gate ionic liquid voltage. Comparatively, the output current Ids of the n-PdSe2/p-Si junction is significantly dependent on the p-type Si and it increases with a rise in Vtg, showing that charge transportation from n-PdSe2 is partial inside the device. In most of the p–n junctions, the recombination current is determined by charge carriers near the interface within the depletion region, whereas forward current can be known due to the diffusion of carriers in neutral regions.29,31 Usually, the current rectification behavior in the conventional bulk heterojunction diodes is due to the diffusion of majority carriers across the depletion region. However, the rectification behavior in n-PdSe2/p-Si junctions is similar to conventional based p–n junctions, but the atomic rectification behavior is fully diverse since 2D van der Waals p-n heterojunctions do not approve of the depletion region across two adjacent layers. Moreover, we measured the output (Ids–Vds) characteristics with different thicknesses of PdSe2 on the Si substrate at Vtg = 0 to verify the rectifying behavior. It can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†) that there is a minor change in the rectification ratio of PdSe2 nanoflakes at Vtg = 0 from a thickness of 2 to 10 nm, but from 30 to 130 nm, a maximum change in rectification was detected. This thickness effect of the Si/PdSe2 p–n diode is caused by junction doping at the interface of Si and PdSe2 due to the tunable bandgap of PdSe2. As it is already reported that the optical bandgap of PdSe2 is tunable with variation in its thickness (i.e., the bandgap of PdSe2 modulated from ∼1.37 to ∼0.7 eV as its thickness altered from 1 to 10 nm and it remains nearly ∼0.5 eV for thickness from 20 nm to its bulk form i.e., 130 nm).16 In our case from a thickness of ∼2 to ∼10 nm, the junction is lightly doped while from ∼30 to ∼130 nm, it is heavily doped and no change was detected in the rectification ratio of the p–n diode beyond this thickness (Fig. S3, ESI†).

(d) Rectification ratio and ideality factor as a function of the top gate ionic liquid voltage. 
Furthermore, for evaluating the performance of the PdSe2/Si diode at different top gate voltages, the ideality factor can be extracted in the forward-biased regime of output (Ids–Vds) characteristics using the diode equation as follows:47,48  where ID is the diode current in the forward bias regime and IS is the diode reverse-bias saturation current, V is the applied voltage across the diode, n is the ideality factor, q is the charge on the electron, T denotes the temperature (300 K), and KB is Boltzmann's constant. The slope of the transfer plot in the forward bias gives, from which n is calculated. The value of the ideality factor decreases from ∼5.45 to ∼1.22 when Vtg changes from +2.0 to −2.0 V, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The minimum value of n is ∼1.22 at Vtg = −2 V. The ideality factor calculated in our case was lower than those for conventional based Schottky or mix-dimensional p–n diodes.4,34,38,47,49–54
To estimate the photoresponse behavior of the PdSe2/Si p–n diode, the time-dependent current under different wavelengths from 400 to 1200 nm of incident light was measured, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The photocurrent is inverse to the wavelength of laser light, as shown in Fig. 5(b); as the wavelength of light increased from 400 to 1200 nm, the photocurrent changes from 13.3 to 0.7 μA. The reason is that laser light with a smaller wavelength transports higher energy photons, which causes to produce more electron–hole pairs due to an increase in the photocurrent of the diode. The self-bias photovoltaic behavior of the PdSe2/Si diode was inspected using a laser light (λ = 800 nm, PLaser = 13.5, 62.3 mW cm−2), as illustrated in Fig. 6(c). The self-biased photoresponse of the device is illustrated in Fig. 5(c), where the (Ids−t) response curve of the PdSe2/Si diode can be seen upon illumination of light with different intensities. The photocurrent of the device increased from 10 to 13.8 μA with an increased intensity of light from 13.5 to 62.3 mW cm−2. Fig. 5(d) illustrates the energy band diagram of the PdSe2/Si heterojunction upon illumination of light. The rise and fall time were extracted using the equations:55–58    respectively, where A and Bare constants and λ1, (λ2) are the rise and decay time constants. Subsequently, by fitting these equations (in Fig. S4, ESI†), we estimated a fast rise time of 9.2 μs and a decay time of 17.3 μs. The response speed of  estimated was 9.2/17.3 μs, which represents a fast photoresponse of the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode. This value is better than the previous reported mix-dimensional heterojunctions such as GaSe/GaSb (32/24 μs), InGaAs/p-Si (13/16 ms),59 MoS2/n-Si (30.5/71.6 μs),60 WS2/p-Si (670/998 μs),33 graphene/Ge (23/108 μs),61 and MoS2/BP (15/70 μs).62 An open-circuit voltage of 0.3 V and a short-circuit current of 8.85 μA are attained with a light intensity of 35.1 mW cm−2 (in Fig. S5, ESI†). However, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the PdSe2/Si heterojunction diode is only (0.22%), it is not high enough but can facilitate it to activate at Vds = 0 V.

To evaluate the photoresponse performance of the current n-PdSe2/p-Si diode, the responsivity (R) and the detectivity (D) can be calculated using the following equations:  where Ip = Iillumination − Idark, Id, A, and Pin are the photocurrent, dark current, active area of the device, and input power, respectively.47,63 The responsivity (R) of the p–n diode was changed from 4.72 × 101 to 2.86 × 101 A W−1 when there was an increase in the intensity of incident light (35.1 to 62.3 mW cm−2). Our device showed a detectivity of 8.13 × 109 Jones with a power intensity of 62.3 mW cm−2. The high value of responsivity of the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode is ascribed to the formation of sharp built-in potential owing to clean interface as well as screening against Coulomb scattering.64
The device showed the switching behavior with the incident light on and off. Fig. 6(a) shows the illustration of the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode, demonstrating as a switching photodiode. The maximum value of open-circuit voltage (0.6 V) is generated as an output signal at the same time as the incident light is turned on and quickly disappear when the input light signal is switched off, and a perfect switching behavior is observed at the n-PdSe2/p-Si diode state by switching on and off the light (λ = 600 nm, PLaser = 62.3 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 6(b). This may lead to the development of switching photodiodes based on NMD 2D materials with 3D bulk structures.
Furthermore, we used the PdSe2/Si p–n diode for the dynamic rectification purpose. Fig. 6(c) shows the schematic of the p–n diode, where an AC input signal with a sinusoidal shape of frequency 10 Hz is applied across the input terminals and an output signal is received across output terminals of external resistance (R = 1 MΩ). Fig. 6(d) shows the dynamic rectified (Vin–Vout) curves for an AC input sinusoidal wave signal into a direct output sine wave with voltage sweeps from −3 to +3 V. We did not notice signal decay or overrun, demonstrating a steady dynamic rectification behavior.
Conclusion
In summary, multi-layer PdSe2 nano-flakes were exfoliated on the surface of p-type silicon substrates using the mechanical exfoliation technique, and PdSe2/Si p–n junctions were fabricated. We have developed high-performance switching photodiodes based on mix-dimensional PdSe2-Si heterojunctions with a broadband spectral response. The gate-tunable performances of 2D materials incorporated with Si bulk structures are still needed to be studies. We have studied the gate-tunable rectifying behavior of n-PdSe2/p-Si diodes by utilizing an ionic liquid gate voltage with a maximum rectification ratio up to ∼1.0 × 105 with the lowest value of ideality factor ∼1.22. At different temperatures (60 to 300 K), the Zener tunneling and avalanche breakdown phenomena were detected at the junction of PdSe2–Si. The devices showed excellent photovoltaic parameters. Moreover, the Voc switching behavior is achieved at the p–n diode state with the light is turned on and promptly disappears when the incident light is turned off. The devices were also attested for a dynamic rectification, which effectively rectified an input AC signal. The results of this work recommend novel auspicious applications of PdSe2./Si towards various electronics, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), tunnel diodes, and solar cells.
