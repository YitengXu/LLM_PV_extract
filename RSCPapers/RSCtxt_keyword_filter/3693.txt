    , Accepted 13th September 2010First published on 11th October 2010AbstractThe nanostructure of the light emissive layer (EL) of polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs) was investigated using force modulation microscopy (FMM) and scanning time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) excited with focused Bi32+ primary beam. Three-dimensional nanostructures were reconstructed from high resolution ToF-SIMS images acquired with different C60+ sputtering times. The observed nanostructure is related to the efficiency of the PLED. In poly(9-vinyl-carbazole) (PVK) based EL, a high processing temperature (60 °C) yielded less nanoscale phase separation than a low processing temperature (30 °C). This nanostructure can be further suppressed by replacing the host polymer with poly[oxy(3-(9H-9-carbazol-9-ilmethyl-2-methyltrimethylene)] (SL74) and poly[3-(carbazol-9-ylmethyl)-3-methyloxetane] (RS12), which have similar chemical structures and energy levels as PVK. The device efficiency increases when the phase separation inside the EL is suppressed. While the spontaneous formation of a bicontinuous nanostructure inside the active layer is known to provide a path for charge carrier transportation and to be the key to highly efficient polymeric solar cells, these nanostructures are less efficient for trapping the carrier inside the EL and thus lower the power conversion efficiency of the PLED devices.
Introduction
Over the past two decades, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have drawn considerable attention as a potential technology for flat panel displays and lighting.1–3 OLEDs can be divided into two categories based on their use of small molecules or polymers. One of the advantages of polymer LEDs (PLEDs) over small molecule LEDs is the possibility of direct printing using an inkjet printer4 or laser thermal transfer.5 To improve the efficiency of OLEDs, organic phosphorescent materials that harvest both singlet and triplet excitons are being used to replace fluorescent materials that only harvest singlets.6 In theory, the efficiency of electrophosphorescent devices should be three times higher than that of electrofluorescent devices. However, it is difficult to fabricate blue electrophosphorescent devices without a complicated device structure. Recently, high efficiency devices were reported using Ir-based dopants like iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2] picolinate (FIrpic) or ionic iridium complexes and a nonconjugated polymer host like poly(9-vinyl-carbazole) (PVK).7,8
Unlike the simple spatial distribution for small molecules, it is known that a polymer chain can be folded on itself, creating stiff-straight segments, or can be unfolded to create randomly oriented segments.9 The oriented and amorphous phases and their segregation depend on the fabrication process.10,11 In polymer blends, additional phase separation often occurs when mixing with small molecules of significantly different chemical structures.12 As a result, understanding the effect of the nanostructure in the polymer film is crucial and beneficial to polymer electronics. For example, the bicontinuous network formed spontaneously in the P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction ensures a large interfacial contact area between components while providing an adequate path for charge carriers, and is the key to highly efficient polymer solar cells.13–15
In the fast progressing field of analyzing polymer bulk heterojunctions, a variety of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM)16–20 and variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE)21 are used to analyze the surface morphology and vertical distribution, respectively, of molecules in the polymer film. Recently, significant efforts have been directed to analyze the 3D nanostructure of the bulk heterojunction. Based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron tomography (ET) is used to examine the 3D structure inside bulk heterojunction specimens.14,22,23 However, TEM based techniques depend on the scattering of electrons that yield weak contrast in amorphous organic films and limit the sample thickness that can be imaged. For LEDs, because high glass transition temperature amorphous (molecular glass) materials are often advantageous for highly efficient devices,24,25 it is more difficult to generate contrast in TEM images of LEDs than those of crystalline bulk heterojunctions. As a result, ET was never used to image polymer LEDs and 3D volume structure inside LEDs is not yet revealed. Furthermore, because of the limited tilting angle, it is impossible to acquire complete 3D reconstruction data, and the missing information causes artifacts in the resulting reconstructed structure.26
Based on ion-beam depth profiling, the nanostructures inside the polymer bulk heterojunction can also be studied by combining scanning probe microscopy (SPM)27 and scanning time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).28 These techniques do not depend on the crystallinity but only on the nature of the chemical species, so their combination represents a more universal method for analyzing organic materials that yields 50∼60 nm lateral resolution.28,29 Although cluster ion sputtering significantly damages the outer-most surface of inorganic materials,30 it has been found to cause minimal damage to organic surfaces31,32 because of the more shallow damage range33 and the enhanced sputtering rate.34 For a recent review on the cluster-ion based molecular sputter depth profile, see ref. 35 and 36. SIMS spectra before and after cluster ion sputtering have been shown to remain the same, and the m/z is preserved near 1000,37 indicating that sputtering does not significantly alter the molecular structure of the remaining surface. As a result, in situcluster ion sputtering in XPS and ToF-SIMS has been used to study the depth distribution of molecules in organic LEDs to examine their microstructures37 and degradation mechanisms.38
While significant efforts have been made to study bulk heterojunctions, the nanostructures inside PLEDs have received little attention. Furthermore, the relationship between fabrication parameters, nanostructures and device performance is not very clear.9,12 In this work, force modulation microscopy (FMM) is used to examine the surface nanostructure and scanning ToF-SIMS with in situC60+ ion sputtering is used to study the 3D nanostructure of PLEDs fabricated with different parameters. The results show that suppressing the nanoscale phase separation enhances the efficiency of the device. This difference in efficiency can be attributed to better carrier trapping inside the emissive layer of the device.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and 2a show the ToF-SIMS spectra for PVK-based polymeric light emitting layers spin-coated at 30 and 60 °C, respectively. Since only the FIrpic guest contains F atoms, the intensity of F directly indicates the amount of FIrpic in the analyzed area. For PVK, the carbazole group should ideally be detected at m/z = 166. It is found that C60+ sputtering did not significantly alter the intensity of the carbazole peak, indicating minimal ion-beam induced chemical transformation on the remaining surface, and C60+ ion sputtering can be used to profile the chemical composition beneath the surface. However, the C60+ ion beam has a spot size around 2 μm so it cannot provide enough lateral resolution to study the nanostructure of the polymer layer. Because of its small spot size and high lateral resolution, Bi32+ is the primary ion used to acquire the spectrum and to perform distribution mapping. However, the intensity of the carbazole fragment decreased during acquisition of spectra, indicating excessive chemical transformation due to Bi bombardment. Nevertheless, since the spectrum was acquired in static SIMS mode, the spatial location of molecules should not be significantly altered and the smaller fragment that has a constant intensity through the acquisition could be used to determine the locations of molecules. This work uses the CN fragment to map the distribution of PVK that containing carbazole groups. Although FIrpic could also generate CN fragments, the molecular concentration of FIrpic (∼10%) is much less than that of PVK (∼90%), so the CN fragment will mainly result from PVK, and the distribution of CN can thus be used to determine the distribution of PVK.

The image size is 3.5 μm × 3.5 μm × 26 nm. 
The similar ToF-SIMS spectrum along the vertical axis and the F:CN (FIrpic:PVK) depth profile (Fig. 1b and 2b; the take-off of the intensity of SO3 indicates that the EL is completely removed and the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer is exposed) indicate that there is no significant difference in the chemical composition of the films along the vertical axis between these samples. The decrease of F:CN in a given sample along the depth also indicated that the F and CN are not correlated hence the CN intensity did not change with FIrpic concentration and can indicate the distribution of PVK. Furthermore, it is found that FIrpic is enriched at the outer surface and this graded vertical molecular-distributor may help the carrier injection.37 Comparing with samples fabricated at different temperatures, the higher F:CN ratios indicate that the secondary ion yield of PVK is lower when coating is performed at higher temperatures. This result suggests that the PVK may be more dense or may have a better crystallinity when coated at a higher temperature. Therefore, the difference in the device efficiency (12.7% and 13.8%) caused by different processing temperatures (30 and 60 °C) may be related to the nanoscale distribution of molecules.
For organic electronic materials, pervious reports demonstrate that a scanning electrical potential microscope (SEPM, a.k.a. Kelvin probe microscope) can be used to map the distribution of materials with different HOMOs.27 However, because FIrpic and PVK have the same HOMO (5.8 eV8,40), SEPM will not display any contrast between these materials. Nevertheless, because the elastic properties of a polymer change based on the presence of folded segments and existance of small molecules, a force modulation microscope (FMM) can be used to map the distribution of co-polymers based on their mechanical properties.41,42Fig. 1c and 1d show the FMM amplitude and FMM phase image of PVK-based EL spin-coated at 30 °C. The elastic modulus is not uniform on the outer-most surface and clearly indicates the phase separation of materials in the EL. Using the scanning ToF-SIMS, Fig. 1e and 1f show the CN and F mappings that were related to the distributions of PVK and FIrpic, respectively. The ToF-SIMS image revealed 100–200 nm phase segregation, similar to that observed in FMM.
Note that the ToF-SIMS iso-intensity of CN (PVK) and F (FIrpic) is not entirely complementary. This is due to the fact that total phase separation did not occur and that the materials are mixed to a certain extent within the thin film. In addition, in a given matrix, ToF-SIMS observes the amount of materials instead of the relative ratio between components. For the PVK enriched region, the amount of FIrpic is not necessarily lower than average because of the nanoporous nature of the PVK polymer due to the chain-folding and the presence of the small FIrpic molecule. As a result, the distribution of PVK and FIrpic is random rather than complementary.
The scanning ToF-SIMS images acquired at different sputtering times are stacked to reconstruct the 3D nanostructure inside the thin-film. The supporting information includes an animation of a reconstructed cross-section. The distribution of materials is further quantified by determining the ratio of the 50% iso-intensity contour in the image. For uniformly distributed molecules, the intensity in the mapping will be uniform so that the ratio of the contour would be lower than that for non-uniformly distributed molecules. In other words, this ratio quantifies the degree of phase segregation in the distribution mapping. The results show that the PVK exhibits a 14% contour and FIrpic exhibits a 16% contour when spin coated at a lower (30 °C) temperature.

Table 1 lists the quantitative results for the different nanostructures (Fig. 1 and 2) of PVK-based ELs coated at different temperatures. The film coated at a higher temperature has a slightly less surface roughness. However, the difference in roughness is not significant and would not significantly affect the device efficiency. FMM results clearly indicate that the contrast in both amplitude and phase is much smaller for films coated at a higher temperature. In addition, the nanostructure obtained with the lower temperature process is finer (50–100 nm) than that coated at a higher temperature. Furthermore, the areal fraction of the 50% intensity contour observed in ToF-SIMS is also lower for high temperature coating, indicating a more uniform molecular distribution. These results indicate that the PVK-based EL coated at a higher temperature has less phase separation than that coated at lower temperature.

To further examine the effect of nanostructure on device performance, SL74 and RS12 were chosen to replace the PVK. These polymers have similar chemical structure and energy level to PVK (for PVK, SL74, and RS12, LUMO is −2.2, −2.1, and −2.2 eV; and HOMO is −5.8, −5.7, and −5.9 eV, respectively.39) In addition, the ratio of active carbazole groups to FIrpic in the EL is also similar (11:1, 10:1, and 9:1 for PVK, SL74, and RS12, respectively). These values indicate that these different chemical structures should not significantly affect efficiency. The ToF-SIMS spectra confirm that the different chemical structures caused a small difference in molecular fragments. The overall depth profile is similar but the CH related fragments are much stronger for RS12 (Fig. 3a) because it has more aliphatic carbon per carbazole. Since aliphatic carbon does not transport charge carriers, this would increase the internal resistance of the device and lower its efficiency. However, RS12-based PLED has the highest efficiency, indicating that the efficiency is not simply controlled by the chemical structure of the host.

The image size is 3.5 μm × 3.5 μm × 25 nm. 
The surface nanostructure of SL74- and RS12-based light emitting layers was further examined by FMM (Fig. 3c,d and Fig. 4c,d) and the distribution of molecules in 3D was examined by ToF-SIMS (Fig. 3e,f and Fig. 4e,f). Table 1 summarizes the results of quantitative image analysis. All the polymeric layers studied here had similar roughness values and decreased in the following order: SL74, RS12, PVK and showed no correlation to the device efficiency. On the other hand, the contrast in FMM amplitude and phase decreases in the following order: PVK, SL74, RS12. The ToF-SIMS volume structure also revealed that the phase separation decreased according to the same trend. These results clearly indicate that RS12-based EL has less phase separation than SL74- and PVK-based EL and the device efficiency decrease in the same order. In other words, there is a strong correlation between the nanoscale phase separation and device efficiency.

The nanostructure of polymeric solar cells (bulk heterojunctions) has been extensively studied, with reports indicating that the controlled phase separation in the active layer is the key to its high efficiency.13–15,22,23 The spontaneously formed bicontinuous structure ensures a large interfacial contact area between components and provides a suitable path for the charge carrier to migrate to the collecting electrode. As a result, the efficiency of the solar cell was dramatically enhanced by the nanostructure, and techniques including slow drying17 and solvent assisted annealing15 have been developed to enhance the phase separation and the region enriched in p- and n-type molecules. These regions provide a pathway for hole and electron transportation, respectively, thus making the collection of charge carriers more efficient. On the other hand, for light emitting diodes, a high mobility of charge carried inside the active layer is undesirable. Instead, it is preferable to trap the charge carried inside the light emitting layer so that it has a greater chance to recombine and generate excitons. As a result, phase separation that provides a path for charge carriers in the EL can lower its device performance.
In the host–guest EL studied here, the HOMO of the polymer host (−5.7∼−5.9 eV) is similar to that of the FIrpic guest (−5.8 eV). Therefore, because the hole can easily jump between host and guest with little or no energy barrier, the phase separation would not significantly affect the hole transportation. However, the LUMO of FIrpic (−3.1 eV) is much lower than that of polymer hosts (−2.1∼−2.2 eV). As a result, the FIrpic-rich region provides a pathway for electron transportation and forms excitons on the guest material.42 Excitons formed on a host favor energy transfer from host to guest, resulting in high efficiency,43 and the aggregation of molecules and phase separation that forms excitons on the guest can lower its efficiency.
In the polymeric EL examined here, PVK coated at 30 °C has the highest degree of phase separation and hence lowest device efficiency. Increasing the temperature to 60 °C during spin-coating led the solvent to dry faster and thus resulted in less phase separation, yielding a higher efficiency in the EL coated at higher temperature. When the PVK was replaced with polymers with similar chemical structures, SL74 had less phase separation than PVK. This difference may be because the longer back-bone of SL74 makes the bulky carbazole groups further apart, thus making it easier for FIrpic to fit in the micro-pore, yielding a more uniform mixture. RS12 has a lower molecular weight than the other tested materials, allowing for a more uniform distribution of the FIrpic-guest and resulting in the least phase separation. The uniform structure formed by RS12 results in a higher efficiency device than those constructed with SL74 and PVK.
Conclusions
This study examined the 2D and 3D nanostructure of the polymeric light emissive layer in polymer light emitting diodes using a force modulation microscope and scanning time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with in situC60+ ion depth profiling, respectively. The 3D image is acquired by stacking images excited by a focused Bi32+ primary beam at different depth. The results show that spin coating at a lower temperature resulted in more nanoscale phase separation than spin coating at a higher temperature. Using a different polymer host enabled suppression of the phase separation. Unlike bulk heterojunction solar cells that benefit from phase separation, the efficiency of PLEDs decrease with the presence of such a nanostructure. This difference exists because solar cells require the path formed by phase separation to remove charge carriers from the active layer, while PLEDs need to trap the carriers inside the active layer. As a result, the presence of a nanostructure inside the PLED allows the carrier to escape, thus lowering its efficiency.
Experimental
Fabrication of light emitting films
The fabrication process was similar to a previously reported method.39,42 In short, various polymeric blue emissive layers (EL) containing 24 wt% iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2] (FIrpic) guest doped in poly(9-vinyl-carbazole) (PVK), poly[oxy(3-(9H-9-carbazol-9-ilmethyl-2-methyltrimethylene)] (SL74) or poly[3-(carbazol-9-ylmethyl)-3-methyloxetane] (RS12) hosts were prepared by spin coating the appropriate solutions on a poly(ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) modified ITO substrate at 5000 rpm under nitrogen atmosphere. The host and guest materials were stirred and dissolved in toluene at 75 °C where the vaporization of solvent is not significant. The well-mixed solutions were cooled down close to room temperature (30 °C) and then spin-coated or heated to 60 °C (below the temperature used for dissolving materials) before spin-coating. Scheme 1 shows the structures of the chemicals used in this work.

FMM measurements
The FMM experiments were performed with a Veeco Innova (Woodbury, NY) atomic force microscope using a 75 kHz cantilever in the contact-mode. The probe cartridge was oscillated at the resonance frequency of the probe at about 13 kHz. Because the oscillation frequency was much higher than the height of the feedback loop, the DC component of the deflection signal was used to maintain constant tip-to-sample spacing and to determine the topography. The amplitude and phase of the AC component of the deflection were measured by a dedicated lock-in circuit and yielded the FMM amplitude and FMM phase images.

ToF-SIMS measurements
The ToF-SIMS experiments were performed with a PHI TRIFT V nanoTOF (Chigasaki, Japan) ToF-SIMS system. The pulsed primary ion source was operated with Bi32+ at 25 kV (0.1 nA DC, 2 fA pulse) with a 5 μm × 5 μm rastering area at an incident angle of 40°. The analyzer collected negatively charged secondary ions from a direction normal to the specimen surface. Before imaging, depth profiles were acquired for calibrating the sputtering rate. The time for sputter through EL was divided by 10 for image profile. The data acquisition time was 5 min for each image and SIMS spectrum was extracted by integrating the image. A flooding electron beam (10 V) was used for charge compensation. The resulting images were passed through a low-pass filter in Fourier space to remove random noise. The sputtering was done with a C60+ ion beam operated at 20 kV and 30 pA with a 200 μm × 200 μm rastering area at an incident angle of 48°. The relative low C60+ current is required to remove only 2.5–2.6 nm each cycle. The final image stack was reconstructed to a 3D volume image using ImageJ.
