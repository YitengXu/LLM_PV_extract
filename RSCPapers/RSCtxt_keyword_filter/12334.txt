    , Accepted 14th July 2021First published on 14th July 2021AbstractThe ternary strategy has been proved to be an efficient approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, little attention has been paid to deriving the general design principle for selecting an appropriate third component. Herein, we proposed a facile strategy for third-component selection in non-fullerene acceptor-based ternary OSCs. By sharing the same central unit with the host acceptor and a single fluorinated end group, the designed non-fullerene acceptor can successfully function as the third component in ternary OSCs. Following this design principle, we synthesized the BTP-F acceptor, and then incorporated it into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend. Encouragingly, the optimized ternary OSC exhibited a high PCE of 18.45%, which is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs so far. In addition, the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC displayed superior stability compared to the host system. Systematic characterizations reveal that the introduction of BTP-F into the ternary blend increases the charge transport, improves the active-layer morphology and reduces non-radiative recombination, therefore leading to a simultaneously enhanced short-circuit current, fill factor and open-circuit voltage. Furthermore, the Y6-F and L8-BO-F acceptors have been also synthesized as the third components in ternary OSCs. Compared with the binary devices, the ternary devices all exhibited improved PCEs. These results confirm the general application of the strategy we proposed, which provides a new way to further improve the efficiency of ternary OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as a promising solar energy conversion technology due to their distinctive merits of low cost, light weight, and ease of fabrication. Use of a ternary OSC, which contains either two donors/one acceptor or one donor/two acceptors, is an efficient approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. Although ternary OSCs have been fabricated using various photovoltaic materials, how to design and synthesize an appropriate third component remains challenging. Aiming at selecting the third component from a material perspective, we propose a facile strategy for the third-component selection in ternary OSCs by using the same central unit with the host acceptor along with a single fluorinated end group. We subsequently synthesized three non-fullerene acceptors, BTP-F, Y6-F and L8-BO-F, and further used them as the third components in PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:Y6 and D18-Cl:L8-BO blends, respectively, to fabricate ternary OSCs. Inspiringly, higher PCEs than those of the binary host systems are achieved in all the ternary devices. Among them, the optimized PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC produced a high PCE of 18.45%. This work not only affords a general strategy for rational third-component design for ternary OSCs, but also paves a new avenue in the further development of high-performance OSCs.

Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have aroused much attention in recent years due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, flexibility, roll-to-roll manufacture, and semi-transparency.1–4 Advances in photovoltaic materials, device engineering and morphological optimization have improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs to over 18.0%.5,6 Such improvements have been greatly contributed by the rapid progress in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), in particular the emergence of fused-ring electron acceptors, which possess adjustable energy levels, wide absorption profiles into the near infrared region and high exciton diffusion coefficients.7–11
To further boost the PCE of OSCs, a ternary strategy is thought to be a simple and effective approach. A ternary OSC typically contains three light-harvesting materials, either two donors/one acceptor or two acceptors/one donor, which provide a broader absorption window and meanwhile avoid the complicated fabrication process of tandem OSCs.12–15 Although numerous ternary OSCs have demonstrated the importance of the ternary strategy for achieving high-efficiency OSCs,16 how to design an appropriate third component from a material viewpoint remains a challenge. In successful ternary design, the active-layer materials should possess complementary absorption spectra to broaden the photon harvesting of the blend. In addition, the third component should have good miscibility with the host system to ensure a desirable morphology.17–19 Moreover, compared with silicon or perovskite solar cells, the lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) of an OSC is the major cause of its lower PCE values. Consequently, improvement of the Voc is vitally important for further boosting the PCE of OSCs.20–23
It has been established that the introduction of halogen atoms can adjust the optoelectronic properties and increase the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the corresponding materials.24,25 Halogenation of end groups has demonstrated multiple successful cases in developing efficient A–D–A-type NFAs.26,27 State-of-the-art high-performance NFAs, such as BTP-eC9, Y6, and L8-BO, are all halogenated, and there are four halogen atoms in the end groups of these materials.28,29 However, the halogen atoms are electron-withdrawing groups. Their existence in the end group of the materials could lead to a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The excessive halogen atoms in the end group account for the constrained Voc values of Y6-series NFAs.30–32 In this regard, it is considered that decreasing the number of halogen atoms in the end groups of NFAs can afford a slightly higher LUMO and therefore a better Voc of the corresponding device. Additionally, among the halogenation approaches, the fluorination is a mature and widely used one and the effect of fluorination on material property has been extensively studied.33–36 Combining these concerns, we proposed that using the same central unit as the host acceptor along with a single fluorinated end group as a third component could be a facile strategy for the third-component selection in ternary OSCs.
In this contribution, we synthesized three NFAs, BTP-F, Y6-F and L8-BO-F. These acceptors have the same central unit with BTP-eC9, Y6, and L8-BO, but they are end-capped with 2-(6-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile and 2-(5-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile mixtures as the end group (we named the end group as IC-F). We further used BTP-F, Y6-F, and L8-BO-F as the third components in the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:Y6 and D18-Cl:L8-BO blends. The similar chemical structures of the third components and the host acceptors ensure the good compatibility of the two acceptors, which is highly desirable in ternary OSCs for obtaining a high fill factor (FF). Besides, the single fluorination elaborately elevates the LUMO energy level and promises a higher Voc. As a result, the ternary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F demonstrated an impressive PCE of 18.45% (certified as 18.0%), representing one of the highest efficiency values reported for single-junction and tandem OSCs so far. This ternary device was also found to possess better stability than the PM6:BTP-eC9-based device. In addition, the PM6:Y6:Y6-F and D18-Cl:L8-BO:L8-BO-F ternary OSCs also outperformed the corresponding binary devices. Herein, we mainly use the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F blend as a representative system to study the effect of the third component. Systematic characterizations and analyses reveal that the introduction of BTP-F increases the charge-transport mobility, improves the active-layer morphology and reduces non-radiative recombination, and therefore renders a simultaneously enhanced Voc, short-circuit current (Jsc), and FF in the ternary devices. Notably, the ternary OSC realized a small non-radiative energy loss (ΔVnon-rad) of 0.198 V, which is among the lowest ΔVnon-rad values for ternary OSCs. These results show that the strategy we propose could be a general design principle for rational third-component design in ternary OSCs. More importantly, our work provides a useful guideline for future ternary design, especially from the point of view of third-component synthesis.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of fluorinated NFAs are provided in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The target acceptors were characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, BTP-eC9/BTP-F, L8-BO/L8-BO-F and Y6/Y6-F share the same A–D–A–D–A configuration with identical side-chains, but differ in the end groups of IC-F and 2-(5,6-dichloro-2-methylene-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile or 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile. The UV-vis absorption spectra of PM6, BTP-eC9, BTP-F and the blend films are shown in Fig. 1b and c, where it can be observed that replacement of 2-(5,6-dichloro-2-methylene-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile with IC-F leads to a 25 nm blue-shifted absorption. As a result, BTP-F exhibits blue-shifted absorption, showing complementary absorption with PM6 and BTP-eC9. The molecular energy levels of PM6, BTP-eC9, and BTP-F were measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1d, the LUMO energy levels of BTP-eC9 and BTP-F are −3.98 eV and −3.86 eV, respectively. BTP-F exhibits a higher LUMO energy level, mainly due to the weak electron-withdrawing ability of IC-F. The higher LUMO of BTP-F is expected to deliver a higher Voc in the device.

To explore the effect of BTP-F on the performance of OSCs, photovoltaic devices were fabricated using a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. Fig. 1e shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices using a 100 mW cm−2 simulated 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator. Table 1 lists the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the binary and ternary devices. The binary OSC based on PM6:BTP-eC9 showed a PCE of 17.58%, with a Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 26.81 mA cm−2 and a FF value of 0.775, while the PM6:BTP-F binary device exhibited a PCE of 16.20%, with a high Voc of 0.900 V, a lower Jsc of 24.05 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.750. Different amounts of BTP-F were added into the PM6:BTP-eC9 host system (keeping the total donor/acceptor weight ratio at 1:1.2), and the corresponding J–V curves and the detailed parameters of the ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†). It was found that with an increasing the amount of BTP-F, the Voc of the corresponding device increases clearly. When the weight ratio of BTP-F reaches 15% in the acceptors, the device yielded an optimized PCE of 18.45%, with simultaneously increased Voc of 0.858 V, Jsc of 26.99 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.797 (certified as 18.0% at National Institute of Metrology in China, Fig. S5, ESI†), which is among the highest efficiencies reported for both single-junction and tandem OSCs so far. For the PM6:Y6:Y6-F and D18-Cl:L8-BO:L8-BO-F ternary devices, higher PCE values than those of the binary devices with enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF values were also obtained. The representative J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra measured using a solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R3011, Enlitech) are plotted in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). Fig. 1f exhibits the efficiency histograms of the binary and ternary blends. The counts versus PCE plots show Gaussian distributions for all the blends indicating that all the OSCs have reproducible PCE values with small deviations. Fig. 1g shows the EQE spectra of the optimized binary and ternary OSCs. It can be seen that the intensity of EQE in the absorption range of 450–800 nm is enhanced after the addition of BTP-F, which contributes to the higher Jsc achieved in the ternary device. The calculated Jsc values from the EQE data are 26.21, 26.69, and 23.70 mA cm−2 for PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F and PM6:BTP-F devices, respectively. The results agree well with the Jsc values measured using the J–V measurements. We also compared the photostability of the binary and ternary devices. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the ternary OSC demonstrated better photostability than the host system. The PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F devices reach their T80 (the time required to reach 80% of initial performance) value at 123, 142 and 104 h, respectively.

To clarify the influence of BTP-F on the charge-transport properties, space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to calculate the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in the binary and ternary blends. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), for the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, μh and μe are determined to be 8.74 × 10−4 and 5.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.59, and μh and μe for the PM6:BTP-F-based binary OSCs are 8.27 × 10−4 and 4.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 2.04. For the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F blend, the μh and μe values are improved to 9.25 × 10−4 and 6.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.39. The higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities help explain the better Jsc in the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC.
To investigate charge-generation and exciton-dissociation properties in the binary and ternary OSCs, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics (Fig. S10a, ESI†). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, and Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage. The Jph/Jsat ratio is a parameter that is indicative of the overall efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection.37 The Jph/Jsat value for the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC is calculated to be 98.66%, while for the PM6:BTP-eC9, and PM6:BTP-F binary OSCs, the Jph/Jsat values are 95.63%, and 94.63%, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat value for the ternary OSC suggests more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in the device.
The relationship between Voc and Plight is measured to unveil the recombination behavior of the devices. The relationship can be described as Voc ∝ lnPlight. A slope close to 1 kT/q, (where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively) can be observed when the dominant mechanism is bimolecular recombination. For trap-assisted recombination, a higher dependence of the Voc on the light intensity (>kT/q) will be obtained.38 As shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†), the determined slopes are 1.39 kT/q, 1.15 kT/q, and 1.33 kT/q for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F and PM6:BTP-F devices, respectively. This result shows that the addition of BTP-F to the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend can suppress trap-assisted recombination. To further investigate the charge-recombination mechanism, the relationship between Jsc and Plight was measured. Generally, the relationship is described as Jsc ∝ Plightα, where Plight is the light intensity and exponent α is a factor related to bimolecular recombination.39 A high α value close to 1 indicates negligible bimolecular recombination in the device. As shown in Fig. S10c (ESI†), the fitted α values are 0.97, 0.98, and 0.95 for PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F OSCs, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is very weak in the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary device.
To evaluate the miscibility between these materials, the contact angles of two different liquids (water and glycerol) on neat PM6, BTP-eC9, BTP-F films are measured (Fig. 2a). The surface tension (γ) is calculated by using Wu's model.40 As summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), the γ values of PM6, BTP-eC9, and BTP-F are calculated to be 17.18, 23.58, and 26.51 mN m−1, respectively. The degree of molecular miscibility can be reflected by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ, which is obtained via using the equation of .41 The calculated χ values for PM6/BTP-eC9 and PM6/BTP-F are 0.505 and 1.008 mN m−1, respectively, and the χ value for BTP-eC9 and BTP-F is 0.08 mN m−1, showing that BTP-eC9 and BTP-F have the possibility to form well-mixed acceptor phases in the ternary blends. We also used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements to detect changes in the melting and crystallization behaviour. The melting points of BTP-eC9, BTP-eC9:BTP-F and BTP-F are 196.8, 193.60, and 187.96 °C in the heating process, respectively (Fig. 2c). The change in the melting transition of the BTP-eC9:BTP-F blend also demonstrates the formation of a well-mixed phase in the blend.

To gain in-depth insight into the morphology of the blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out at first. As shown in Fig. 3, the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend film exhibits an obvious fibrillar structure with a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) value of 1.19 nm, which is favorable for the charge transport.42,43 After adding BTP-F into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, the fibril-like morphology was still clearly observed in the ternary blend, and a similar RMS value of 1.17 nm was obtained. Such a result suggests that the well-optimized surface morphologies can be satisfactorily maintained after the addition of BTP-F. We further measured the fibril width of these blends to make a more distinct comparison, and the line profiles of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peaks in the AFM images are shown in Fig. 3g–i. The average values are 12.7, 17.7 and 19.6 nm for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F and PM6:BTP-F blends, respectively. The result indicates that the addition of BTP-F to the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend induces PM6 aggregation to form fibrils with a larger width.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the molecular packing of the pristine materials and the blend films. Fig. S11 (ESI†) displays the GIWAXS results of the neat PM6, BTP-eC9 and BTP-F films. The polymer donor PM6 exhibits a mixed face-on/edge-on orientation, while both the acceptors of BTP-eC9 and BTP-F show strong (010) diffraction peaks at qz = 1.81 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating that the two acceptors show a dominant face-on orientation. From the in-plane (IP) profiles in the low-q region, we found that BTP-F shows two diffraction signals located at 0.30 and 0.41 Å−1, while the diffraction peak of BTP-eC9 is located at 0.40 Å−1, suggesting that BTP-F is more ordered compared with BTP-eC9. The 2D GIWAXS diffraction patterns and the corresponding line-cut profiles of binary and ternary blends are shown in Fig. 4. Both the binary and the ternary blends adopted a preferred face-on orientation, evidenced by the strong (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction. Notably, the intensities of the lamellar stacking and the π–π stacking diffraction of the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F blend film are obviously higher than those of the PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-F blends. This suggests that the introduction of BTP-F endows the PM6:BTP-eC9 film with a more orderly structure and brings about a higher degree of molecular packing of the materials. This finding agrees well with the SCLC results and explains the higher Jsc and FF values achieved in the ternary OSCs.

The influence of the introduced fluorinated BTP-F on energy losses in the devices was studied using the method derived in the framework of Marcus theory.44Table 2 summarizes the values extracted from spectroscopic measurements. We first calculated the optical bandgap (Eg) values of the three blend films by taking the crossing point between the normalized electroluminescence (EL) and absorption spectra of the blends (Fig. S12, ESI†). The Eg values of PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F are 1.403, 1.405, and 1.419 eV, respectively. Sensitive EQE (sEQE) spectra of the solar cells were measured to determine ΔECT, which is the energetic difference between the singlet excited state and the charge-transfer (CT) state. ΔECT values for the solar cells based on PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F are determined to be 0.071, 0.070, and 0.066 eV, respectively. A small ΔECT value is indicative of small voltage loss due to the charge-transfer process.45 The voltage loss of a solar cell can be divided into ΔVrad and ΔVnon-rad. ΔVrad is the voltage loss originating from radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers,46 which is inevitable for all kinds of solar cells. ΔVnon-rad is the voltage loss induced by non-radiative recombination, which is the main reason for the generally lower Voc values of OSCs, as compared with those of inorganic solar cells. As listed in Table 2, the Vloss values of the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F binary and ternary OSCs are 0.549, 0.540 and 0.517 V (Fig. 5a–c), respectively. ΔVnon-rad can be calculated from ,47 where EQEEL is the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. The EQEEL values of the binary and ternary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F are 2.35 × 10−4, 3.66 × 10−4, and 6.00 × 10−4, respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†). The corresponding ΔVnon-rad values are 0.209, 0.198, and 0.185 V for the PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F, and PM6:BTP-F devices, respectively. This result suggests that the non-radiative recombination loss in the ternary OSC was successfully suppressed with the addition of BTP-F. It should be noted here that the low ΔVnon-rad values of 0.185 and 0.198 V for the PM6:BTP-F and PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F devices, respectively, are among the lowest ΔVnon-rad values of OSCs reported in the literature (Fig. 5d).

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a facile strategy for the third-component design of NFA-based ternary OSCs. By sharing the same central unit with the host acceptor and a single fluorinated end group, we synthesized three single fluorinated acceptors, BTP-F, Y6-F and L8-BO-F, and then used them as the third components to fabricate ternary OSCs. We found that the guest BTP-F has a complementary absorption with the binary blend, and good compatibility with the host BTP-eC9 acceptor. The introduction of BTP-F also led to a suppressed ΔVnon-rad, and thus led to a higher Voc value. As a result, the PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC yielded an impressive PCE of 18.45%. Furthermore, the PM6:Y6:Y6-F and D18-Cl:L8-BO:L8-BO-F ternary devices also delivered superior PCE values and simultaneously improved values of Voc, Jsc, and FF compared with their binary counterparts.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as a promising solar energy conversion technology due to their distinctive merits of low cost, light weight, and ease of fabrication. Use of a ternary OSC, which contains either two donors/one acceptor or one donor/two acceptors, is an efficient approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. Although ternary OSCs have been fabricated using various photovoltaic materials, how to design and synthesize an appropriate third component remains challenging. Aiming at selecting the third component from a material perspective, we propose a facile strategy for the third-component selection in ternary OSCs by using the same central unit with the host acceptor along with a single fluorinated end group. We subsequently synthesized three non-fullerene acceptors, BTP-F, Y6-F and L8-BO-F, and further used them as the third components in PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:Y6 and D18-Cl:L8-BO blends, respectively, to fabricate ternary OSCs. Inspiringly, higher PCEs than those of the binary host systems are achieved in all the ternary devices. Among them, the optimized PM6:BTP-eC9:BTP-F ternary OSC produced a high PCE of 18.45%. This work not only affords a general strategy for rational third-component design for ternary OSCs, but also paves a new avenue in the further development of high-performance OSCs.
