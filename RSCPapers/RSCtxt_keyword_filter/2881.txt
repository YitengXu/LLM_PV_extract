    , Accepted 16th May 2017First published on 16th May 2017AbstractPhotoelectrocatalytic conversion of biomass and its derivatives is a very significant and promising strategy for energy production. The selective oxidation of biomass alcohol to the corresponding aldehydes is an important class of biomass conversion reactions. In this study, a Z-scheme type solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell was used for the simultaneous selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol, which was a model biomass alcohol to benzaldehyde reaction, for hydrogen production promotion using Au/TiO2 nanotube photonic crystals (Au/TiO2 NTPC) as the photoanode. The results show that the Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode exhibits excellent photoelectrochemical performance and can efficiently conduct charge transport. The conversion of benzyl alcohol is as high 84.68%, whereas selectivity can reach more than 99%. The high conversion rate is attributed to the improvement in the photoelectrocatalytic performance due to the in situ doping of Au nanoparticles. In addition to the Au nanoparticles, O2 is an indispensable factor for the high selectivity. The simultaneous hydrogen production at the cathode can reach 143.83 μmol cm−2. The results show that the anodic oxidation reaction can promote hydrogen production and the hydrogen production efficiency increases with the oxidation rate. This model reaction can also be applied to a series of biomass alcohol selective oxidations. This study achieves simultaneous efficient selective access to hydrocarbon fuels and hydrogen and reveals a novel, sustainable and green energy production idea and direction for development.
1. Introduction
Biomass and its derivatives as a new type of renewable energy source have been widely researched and are attracting increasing attention from scientific researchers.1–3 In recent years, the conversion of biomass and its derivatives has become a very promising and significant research emphasis and focus.4–8 In the past, biomass and its derivatives were mainly used to obtain energy by combustion. However, this method has been gradually eliminated because of its low energy efficiency and environmental pollution caused by the excessive production of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the catalytic oxidation of biomass and its derivatives is of great significance. In previous studies, the methods of catalyzing the conversion of biomass and its derivatives, such as gasification, pyrolysis and hydrolysis, were well established.9,10 These methods can produce high value-added chemicals such as synthesis gas, methane, methanol and various olefins. However, numerous intermediates cause the occurrence of side reactions in the reaction process, which directly affect the utilization of biomass. Meanwhile, these methods usually require relatively harsh conditions, such as high temperature and high pressure, and their operation is complicated, which further restrict their development.
Photoelectrocatalysis is a new advanced oxidation technology, which effectively combines photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, and has the characteristics of efficient and deep processing of target organic matter. Additionally, the operating conditions of photoelectrocatalysis are relatively economical and mild. From the thermodynamic point of view, the oxidation potential of biomass and its derivatives is mainly −0.02 V to 0.26 V, which is far lower than the oxidation potential of water (1.23 V).11–15 Therefore, photoelectrocatalytic conversion of biomass and its derivatives to hydrogen has been widely studied by scientists. In a previous work, two types of periodic TiO2 nanotube arrays modified by C@Cr–SrTiO3/TiO2 nanotube photonic crystals (NTPC) and Pd quantum dots were used to study the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose to promote hydrogen production.16 Esposito et al. used the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose in a WO3-based photoanode and photovoltaic cells to produce hydrogen.17 Their results show that WO3-based electrodes can completely oxidize CO2 and CO. A multi-stage TiO2 nanotube array electrode also exhibited a significant increase in photocatalytic glucose production.18 An Ni(OH)2 functionalized TiO2 photoanode was prepared for the photocatalytic oxidation of glucose to promote hydrogen production.19 The results showed that the prepared electrode has a low initial hydrogen evolution potential and a high photocatalytic oxidation current density. In these studies, the production of hydrogen was indeed promoted, but the biomass and its derivatives were completely oxidized to CO2 and other substances during the photocatalytic process. It is very difficult to control the direct selective conversion of biomass derivatives such as glucose. Therefore, selective control of the catalytic transformation of biomass and its derivatives has become an important research topic. There are two research areas of photoelectrochemical selective oxidation. One is the selectivity of the initial reactants. It has been reported that the dual modification of TiO2 nanorods resulted in the selective photoelectrochemical detection of organic compounds.20 The other is to selectively control the end products, which is also the aim of our research.
Selective oxidation of biomass alcohol to the corresponding aldehydes under mild conditions is a very important chemical reaction in the direct selective conversion of biomass and its derivatives.21–26 The traditional oxidation methods mainly utilize toxic metal oxides, peroxides, halides and ozone,27,28 but these oxidants are generally expensive and result in secondary contamination. Therefore, photoelectric catalysis is relatively more efficient and green. However, it is well known that the oxidation of photogenerated holes and reactive oxygen species is not selective.29,30 Thus, the photocatalytic oxidation of biomass alcohol to biomass aldehyde is also difficult to a certain degree. After a series of studies, there has been some progress in this regard.31–33 In our previous work, we successfully used a CeO2–TiO2 nanotube electrode to oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high selectivity and high selectivity, and its selectivity was as high as 99%.34 CoTCPP@TiO2/WO3 was used for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and its derivatives to the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of visible light with a selectivity of up to 100%, but the conversion of benzyl alcohol in aqueous solvent systems is relatively low.35 From these studies, it can be seen that in order to achieve high selectivity for the efficient oxidation of biomass to aldehydes, additional input energy is required and additional energy is consumed. From this point of view, this does not meet the original intention of energy recovery. Therefore, it is a potential strategy to develop a photoelectrocatalytic method without an external power supply, which can selectively oxidize biomass alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde.
It was previously proposed that a Z-scheme type of photocatalytic fuel cell can be used to synchronize the treatment of organic pollutants and electricity generation.36,37 TiO2–Cu2O and WO3–Cu2O PFC were used to degrade dyes and phenolic wastewater and produce electricity simultaneously.38,39 In our previous work, a solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell consisting of a TiO2 NRs photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode was successfully used for phenol wastewater degradation and simultaneous hydrogen production.40 Therefore, we consider that the solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cells can selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in the anode region under the effect of a specific photoanode to promote hydrogen production in the cathode region.
In this work, the solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell consists of Au/TiO2 nanotube photonic crystals, where, the Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode is used to selectively oxidize the benzyl alcohol in the anode region, whereas the C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode is used in the cathodic region to produce hydrogen. Benzyl alcohol was selected as the model of biomass alcohol. The purpose of this study is to combine the selective oxidation reaction with hydrogen production at the cathode to achieve high selectivity oxidation while obtaining a high yield of hydrogen, thus fully utilizing the chemical energy of the anode organics and cathode electrons. Meanwhile, the mechanism of the high selectivity oxidation and high efficient hydrogen production is studied. This work extends the application of solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cells to the simultaneous selective conversion of biomass alcohol and hydrogen recovery and provides theoretical guidance. It reveals a novel, sustainable and green energy production idea and direction for development.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemical reagents
Ti 0.2 at% Au alloy foil was purchased from Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. NaOH (AR, ≥99%), benzyl alcohol (AR, ≥98.5%), benzaldehyde (AR, ≥98.5%), glycol (AR, ≥99.5%), Na2SO4 (CP, ≥98%), ethanol (AR, ≥99.5%), acetone (AR, ≥99.5%) and isopropanol (AR, ≥99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. HF (AR, ≥40%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. Nafion 117 PEM was purchased from DuPont Co. Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of photoelectrodes

2.2.1 Synthesis of in situ doped Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode. 
First, a simple two-step electrochemical anodization of Ti 0.2 at% Au alloy foil was conducted in an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.2 mol L−1 HF and 1 mol L−1 H2O to fabricate the hierarchical Au/TiO2 nanotube photonic crystal (Au/TiO2 NTPC).41 Before anodization, the Ti–Au alloy sheets were sequentially polished to mirror finish with 180 mesh, 320 mesh, 600 mesh and metallographic sandpaper, rinsed with distilled water, and ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, isopropanol and distilled water for 15 minutes. The treated Ti–Au was used as the anode and a platinum plate as the cathode with an electrode spacing of 1 cm. Ti–Au was anodized at a constant potential (+120 V) for 3 hours under controlled magnetic stirring at a temperature of 10 °C. The sample was removed and rinsed with distilled water under ultrasound for 10 s, dried, and the surface removed with a transparent tape, resulting in the growth of nanotubes. Then, it was anodized with the same electrolyte for 10 min under the same conditions. The samples were soaked in distilled water and ethanol for 30 min. After the samples were dried, they were heat-treated under an air atmosphere in a tubular furnace from room temperature to 450 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at a constant temperature for 1 hour, and finally cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1.


2.2.2 Synthesis of C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode. 
C/Cu2O/Cu mesh was prepared via electrochemical anodic oxidation.39 Copper mesh was cut into pieces and washed with acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 5 min. The treated copper mesh was used as the anode and a platinum plate as the cathode. The electrode spacing was 1 cm and the electrolyte solution was 3 mol L−1 NaOH solution. Cu(OH)2 was produced by anodization at a constant current of 10 mA cm−2 for 25 min. The sample was removed and rinsed with distilled water and allow to dry. The copper mesh was immersed in a 3 mg mL−1 glucose solution to sufficiently infiltrate the solution, and then naturally air-dried. The copper mesh was taken out and placed in a tubular furnace under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 550 °C at 5 °C min−1 and maintained for 4 hours, and then cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 °C min−1.

2.3 Materials characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were observed via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Detailed microstructural features of the sample electrodes were investigated via high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM2100, JEOL, Japan) using a JEM-2100 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The composition and structure of the samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Germany), using a Cu target: λ = 1.540598 Å, tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 60 mA, and scanning speed of 2° min−1. The optical absorption properties of the sample electrode were examined via UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS, Avantes, Netherlands).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the sample electrode were measured on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, USA) using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical system. SCE was used as the reference electrode, C/Cu2O/Cu mesh and Pt as the counter electrode, and the sample electrode as the working electrode. The photocurrent density and photoelectrochemical stability of the sample electrode were measured in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution containing 0.1 mmol L−1 benzyl alcohol.
The reaction was carried out in a double chamber reactor (V = 300 mL), which is shown in Fig. 7. Oxygen was passed through the anode reaction chamber for 30 min to remove the dissolved nitrogen dissolved in the solution system and impurities in the cathode reaction chamber were removed under a flow of nitrogen gas for 30 min. The anode and cathode area were separated by a Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane. All experiments were carried out in this reactor, where the working area of the photoanode and photocathode was both 1 cm2, with moderate stirring and without the application of an external potential. A 300 W high voltage Xe lamp (Changtuo, China) was used as the simulated solar light source (wavelength range of 420–800 nm and light intensity of 100 mW cm−2). The system was illuminated on both sides by two lamps simultaneously. The power density (P) was calculated according to the equation P = I × V. The target biomass was benzyl alcohol (0.1 mmol L−1) and 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. The hydrogen produced was measured by gas chromatography (GC 7900, Techcomp, Shanghai, China) using a high performance capillary column, column temperature of 80 °C, TCD detector, detector temperature of 150 °C and sample volume of 1 mL.
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS Agilent 6890/5973N, Aglient Co.) was used for the qualitative and component analysis of the oxidation products. An HPLC (Agilent 1260, Agilent Co.) equipped with a C18 column (4.6 × 100 nm, 3.5 μm) was used to quantitatively study the conversion of the reactants and the amount of product converted. The test conditions were UV detector wavelength λ = 254 nm, methanol and water H2O mobile phase ratio of 48:52 and flow rate of 1 mL min−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Highly efficient conversion of benzyl alcohol
As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, under the same O2 conditions, the conversion of benzyl alcohol of Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu is higher than that of Au/TiO2 NTPC–Pt. The benzyl alcohol conversion rate of Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu was 85% after 8 hours. When the cathode is Pt foil, the conversion rate of benzyl alcohol is only 41.8%. It is speculated the main reason for this is when the cathode is C/Cu2O/Cu, a Z-scheme solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell is constructed. Under such conditions, there is a significant synergistic effect between the anode and cathode, so that the anode is greatly improved for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol efficiency. In Fig. 3A, it is shown that when the cathode is C/Cu2O/Cu the photocurrent density is 0.50 mA cm−2, whereas the photocurrent density of the Pt cathode is only 0.065 mA cm−2. Comparing the two systems, the largely enhanced photocurrent density also highlights the synergistic facilitation of the Z-scheme. Additionally, after 5 cycles of dark and light cycle test, the photocurrent density values of the two remain unchanged. These results show that the Au/TiO2 NTPC electrode has good photocurrent stability, anti-photocorrosivity and photoelectrochemical response, and it has a larger photocurrent density with the C/Cu2O/Cu cathode. However, when the cathode is Pt foil, there is no Z-scheme cell constructed, thus the conversion rate is relatively low. From Fig. 3B and D, the open circuit potential (VOC), maximum power density (Pmax) and fill factor (FF) are 0.48 V, 0.055 mW cm−2 and 0.43, respectively, which confirm that the cell performance of Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu is superior.

When the photocathode is C/Cu2O/Cu and Au/TiO2 NTPC is the photoanode, the conversion rate is much higher than that with TiO2 NTs as the photoanode (39%) for the oxidation conversion of benzyl alcohol. Compared with the photocatalytic selective oxidation system reported in the literature, the conversion of rutile TiO2 and anatase TiO2 catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol are 10–40% and 50%, respectively, and the selectivity of the formation of benzaldehyde was 38%. The results show that the Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu mesh system exhibits much better photoelectrocatalytic activity for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by photoelectrocatalysis. In the case of the same Z-scheme system, the difference is mainly due to the difference between the performances of the two photoanodes. Here, a periodic Au/TiO2 alloy photonic crystal is used as the photoanode, which differs from the ordinary TiO2 NTs only in UV absorption and absorption edge by about 400 nm. Since Au/TiO2 is a photonic crystal, the incorporation of Au will lead to the plasma resonance effect, thus the periodic absorption peak will appear in the visible region. Therefore, under the conditions of simulated solar light, the photoresponse of the photoelectrode is stronger.
At the same time from the structure shown in the SEM image in Fig. 2A, the prepared Au/TiO2 NTPC has a double-layer mesh and tubular structure. The TiO2 NTs are arranged in a neat array with the TiO2 NTs anodic growth resulting in a layer outside the mesh structure. The Au nanoparticles are distributed on the mesh and the tubes. In the Fig. 2B, the side view of the electrode clearly demonstrates that the nanotubes grew well. In the inset of Fig. 2C, the two lattice fringes represent Au and TiO2 which is evidence that Au/TiO2 was prepared. The XRD pattern of Au/TiO2 NTPC is shown in Fig. 2E, which show diffraction peak positions of 2θ = 25.7° and 38.2° corresponding to anatase TiO2 (101) and (004), respectively, and there are many obvious peaks of the Ti element. The diffraction peak positions at 2θ = 38.8° and 40.5° correspond to Ti element peaks and 2θ = 77.6° corresponds to the Au element peak. All these results show that Au/TiO2 was prepared successfully.

The Mott–Schottky curve of Au/TiO2 NTPC is shown in Fig. 3C. The tangent slope of the Mott–Schottky curve is positive, which indicates that Au/TiO2 NTPC is an n-type semiconductor material. The intersection of the tangent of the curve with 1/C2 = 0 is the flat band potential EFB of the sample electrode. It can be estimated that the EFB of Au/TiO2 in Na2SO4 solution is −0.631 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In the literature, the standard EFB of TiO2 NTs is −0.479 V. The EFB of Au/TiO2 shifted negatively, which indicates that the Au/TiO2 band gap structure was bent and this promoted photoelectron peak separation and transfer. According to the photocarrier density formula: (1)where, C is the space charge capacity of the semiconductor material, ND is the carrier density, e is the element charge quantity, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, ε is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor material, Es is the applied bias voltage, EFB is the flat band potential, T is temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant. Thus, the equation of ND can be described as follow: (2)where, e = 1.6 × 10−19 C, ε0 = 8.86 × 10−12 F m−1, and relative permittivity ε = 48 (anatase TiO2). Therefore, from eqn (2), the ND of Au/TiO2 is 6.67 × 1018. Compared to other materials, such as TiO2 NTs with an ND of 1.53 × 1018, the ND of Au/TiO2 is about 4.5 times higher, which indicates that the photogenerated charge density is very large, thus the transfer is very fast. The results further show that the Au/TiO2 NTPC electrode has a very high photoelectrocatalytic oxidation ability, which can achieve high oxidation selectivity and hydrogen production efficiency. Therefore, due to the existence of Au nanoparticles, it can effectively capture photogenerated electrons and extend the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons, and thus significantly increase the catalytic activity of the sample electrode. The Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode has an excellent photoresponse and charge transfer rate as a photonic crystal, thus the efficiency of photoelectrocatalytic oxidation is greatly improved. Therefore, the Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu mesh system exhibits a higher benzyl alcohol conversion under the synergetic effect of the Z-scheme. Here, the incorporation of Au plays the most important role. At the same time it can be seen from Table 1, under anaerobic conditions, the benzyl alcohol conversion rate is not high. Reviewing previously reported work, it is found that the selective oxidation reactions of benzyl alcohol to the corresponding benzaldehyde are carried out under aerobic conditions. Compared with that of Au/TiO2–Cu2O (anaerobic), the reaction conversion of Au/TiO2–Cu2O (80.4%) for 8 h is about 25% higher, which indicates that the addition of oxygen has an important effect on the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. In summary, the highly efficient conversion of benzyl alcohol mainly depends on the formation of a Z-scheme structure, where a huge improvement in the photoanode performance is due to the incorporation of Au and aerobic conditions.

3.2 Highly selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and its mechanism

Fig. 1B displays the effect of selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under different conditions. Under aerobic conditions with simulated solar light irradiation, the selectivity of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde in the Au/TiO2–Cu2O system is as high as 99% to 100%. However, when oxygen is not available, the final selectivity is less than 50%. When this system is replaced by Au/TiO2–Pt (aerobic), the selectivity is also 99%. The results, obtained when the quenchers ˙OH (CH3OH) and ˙O2− (SOD) were added, show that the influence of the electrode on the selectivity of the system is not the mechanism for the selectivity. As shown in Fig. 4, the retention time of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde are 2.35 min and 2.59 min, respectively. When CH3OH is added, it can be seen that there is no change in the yield of benzaldehyde, which proves that in this reaction ˙OH is produced. However, when the SOD is added, only a small amount of benzaldehyde is produced. Therefore, there is hardly any selectivity under this condition, which confirms that the core oxidation species is ˙O2−. Based on previous research, the reaction of aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by Au/TiO2 NTPC can be deduced as follows. (3) C6H5–CH2OH + h+ → ∗C6H5–CH2OH+(4) O2 + e− →⋅O−2(5) ∗C6H5–CH2OH+ +⋅O−2 + h+ → C6H5–CHO + H+ + O2(6)
 Fig. 4  HPLC spectra of 0.1 mmol L−1 benzyl alcohol solution with no additive (black), methanol (blue) and SOD (red) after 4 h photoelectrochemical reaction. The electrolyte was 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. 
When Au/TiO2 NTPC is irradiated and excited by simulated solar light, the semiconductor material generates photogenerated electron and hole pairs. The benzyl alcohol molecules adsorbed on the electrode surface first combine with the photogenerated holes and are oxidized to generate the benzyl alcohol active anion *C6H5–CH2OH+. Meanwhile, there are numerous oxygen molecules which react with the photogenerated electrons to produce the superoxide radical ˙O2−. Then, the generated *C6H5–CH2OH+ and ˙O2− further react with each other to produce benzaldehyde, H+ and O2. Essentially, in this anode area, when there is an O2 flow, the photogenerated electrons first reduce the O2 to ˙O2−. This superoxide radical anion ˙O2− preferentially combines with the benzoic alcohol active anion, which is equivalent to a reduction in the total oxidizability. Thus, the benzyl alcohol can only be oxidized to benzaldehyde to achieve high selectivity.42,43 Here, different from other systems, O2 plays the role of a catalyst.
Meanwhile, the nanoparticle sized Au particles are favorable for capturing photogenerated electrons to extend the lifetime of the charge carriers, thus improving the efficiency of the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process. At the same time, the structure of the Z-scheme is favorable for the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. A schematic diagram of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5.

3.3 Cathodic hydrogen production and its relationship with anodic oxidation reaction
When the benzyl alcohol is being oxidizing at the anode, hydrogen is also being produced at the cathode. The overall reaction process can be described as follows: (7) (8) (9) e−cb1 + h+vb2 → hν′(10) 2H+ + e−cb2 → H2(11)and the overall reaction: (12)
The structure of this dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell is an isolated Z-scheme. The special Z-scheme structure makes the anodic half reaction different from other systems, where oxygen can be recycled as a catalyst. In this process, benzyl alcohol decomposes to benzaldehyde and H+. Then, H+ is transferred through the PEM to the cathode area and is reduced by e−to produce hydrogen. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons on the anode are transferred through the copper wire and combine with the photogenerated holes at the cathode, which further improves the efficiency of anodic oxidation and cathodic hydrogen production. As is known, in the reaction system, the hydrogen production efficiency of the cathode is affected by the anodic oxidation reaction. In other words, the anodic oxidation reaction of the whole system is the rate-determining step. Fig. 6 shows the variation in hydrogen production in different solutions. The variable was the photocathode and the target biomass alcohol. The yield of hydrogen in Na2SO4 solution containing benzyl alcohol was much higher than that of Na2SO4 solution without benzyl alcohol, where the maximum yield reached 143.83 μmol cm−2 and only 10.42 μmol·cm−2 in the absence of benzyl alcohol. The results show that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol through the anode plays a decisive role in the hydrogen production at the cathode. The transfer of electrons from the anodic oxidation to the cathode increases the cathode photogenerated electron density and enhances the hydrogen production efficiency. The easier the oxidation reaction of at the anode, the easier it is to produce hydrogen. Compared with the TiO2 NRs–C/Cu2O/Cu system, which produced 91 μmol·cm−2 hydrogen, the amount of hydrogen produced by the Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu system is nearly 50% higher. This also indicates that the use of Au/TiO2 NTPC as the photoanode results in a higher photogenerated carrier density and better photocatalytic activity, which is consistent with that mentioned above. Meanwhile, with different cathodes, the amount of hydrogen produced in the Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu system is 3 times higher than that of the Au/TiO2 NTPC–Pt system, which also shows that the construction of the Z-scheme has a synergistic effect on each photoelectrode.

The electrolyte was 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 in all the experiments.

Fig. 5 shows that there is no change for the amount of hydrogen produced after two 4 h experiments. The result shows that the stability of the Au/TiO2 NTPC–C/Cu2O/Cu system is very good. Table 1 shows that the hydrogen production efficiency increases with the oxidation current density JO. The hydrogen production efficiency can be calculated using the following equation: (13)where, nH2,exper is the experimental amount of hydrogen produced, nH2,theor is the theoretical amount of hydrogen, and ne is the transferred electrons from the anode to the cathode which equals the lost electrons in the oxidation reaction. This calculation equation is similar to the hydrogen production quantum efficiency formula. As is known, in photocatalytic hydrogen production systems, photons are the source of energy for hydrogen production, thus the hydrogen production quantum efficiency equals the ratio of actual amount of hydrogen produced and half of the incident photons. In the photoelectrochemical cell system, the source of energy for hydrogen production is the transferred electrons from the anode to the cathode. Therefore, in eqn (13), the denominator is the transferred electrons from the anode to the cathode.
As is known, when the target biomass is the same in different systems, a higher oxidation current density means a faster reaction rate, and thus hydrogen is produced more easily. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen produced and the efficiency will be higher. The effect of the substrate concentration on JO and hydrogen production efficiency was been investigated and the results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the change in JO and H2 efficiency is small when the benzyl alcohol concentration changes. Therefore, the influence of substrate concentration is negligible compared with O2 and the photoelectrodes.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the photoelectrocatalytic conversion of biomass and its derivatives is a very promising and significant research area and focus. In order to further improve the recovery rate of energy, the selective conversion of biomass into hydrocarbon fuels has become a research hotspot. The selective oxidation of biomass to the corresponding aldehydes is an important class of biomass conversion reactions. In this work, with simulated solar light irradiation, a Z-scheme type solar-driven dual photoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell consisting of an Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode and C/Cu2O/Cu photocathode is used for the simultaneous selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and production of hydrogen. The Au/TiO2 NTPC photoanode is prepared by the electrochemical anodization and physical and electrochemical measurements reveal its excellent photoelectrocatalytic performance. The properties of the photonic crystal enhance the absorption of the material in the visible region, and the material has good photoelectrocatalytic stability and high photocurrent density. The calculated photogenerated carrier density is much higher than the other electrodes reported in the literature, and it has good charge transport properties. The conversion of benzyl alcohol is as high as 84.68%, while the selectivity is more than 99%. The high conversion rate is attributed to the improvement in photoelectrocatalytic performance due to the in situ doping of Au nanoparticles. In addition to the Au nanoparticles, O2 is an indispensable factor for the high selectivity. The hydrogen production is indeed promoted by the highly efficient and selective conversion of benzyl alcohol and reaches 143.83 μmol cm−2. The hydrogen production efficiency increases with the oxidation current density which represents the oxidation rate. The results show that the anodic oxidation reaction can promote the hydrogen production at the cathode. This model reaction can also be applied to a series of biomass alcohol selective oxidations. This study achieves simultaneous efficient selective access to hydrocarbon fuels and hydrogen, and reveals a novel, sustainable and green energy production idea and direction for development.
