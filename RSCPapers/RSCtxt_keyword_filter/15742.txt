    , Accepted 2nd June 2020First published on 3rd June 2020AbstractThis paper reports for the first time the preparation of Co3O4 nanorods by simple hydrothermal and annealing methods, which are doped with polyoxometalates that act as an intermediary in electronic transmission to accelerate electron transport. The designed H3PW12O40(PW12)/Co3O4–Cu2S composite film was prepared by the screen printing method to boost its efficiency as the counter electrode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, where the preparation process is simple and inexpensive. PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S (Jsc = 16.60 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.636 V, Rct = 0.32 Ω and FF = 0.436) shows better electrocatalytic performance compared to the original Co3O4 and Cu2S. Accordingly, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S is 4.67%, which is 10%, 46%, 55.6%, and 72% higher than those of Co3O4–Cu2S (4.2%), Cu2S (2.54%), PW12/Co3O4 (2.07%), and Co3O4 (1.30%), respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel measurements performed on two CE symmetric virtual cells proved the excellent electrocatalytic activity of PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S. Therefore, this composite film can be used as an alternative option for QDSSC counter electrodes.
Introduction
The large consumption of fossil energy has resulted in the global energy crisis as well as environmental pollution. To solve this issue, it is urgent for us to search for low-cost and high-performance solar devices at present.1,2 Solar cells are devices that convert solar energy directly into electrical energy based on the photoelectric effect, and have attracted extensive attention.3–8 Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are considered as promising third-generation cells due to their facilely tunable band gaps7 through size or composition control, high molar extinction coefficient,9 and multiple exciton generation (MEG) possibility, which could make QD-based solar cells to overcome the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit of 32.9%.10–12 To date, 12.75% is the highest known conversion efficiency achieved by QDSSCs consisting of ZnCuInSe co-sensitized with CdSe photoanodes and titanium mesh supported mesoporous carbon as the counter electrode, which was reported by Zhong's group.13 The theoretical PCE value of QDSSCs could reach 44%, nonetheless, the actual PCE value is still far behind. To further enhance the conversion efficiency, the performance of solar cells should be continuously improved by further optimization. During recent decades, prior studies have largely focused on the research on photoanodes, while there are only a few reports on counter electrodes. It is well known that CEs are responsible for collecting electrons from the external circuit and catalyzing the oxidation of the polysulfide electrolyte at the electrolyte/CE interface. The counter electrode should have a large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, chemical durability and effective catalytic activity to ensure outstanding catalytic performance.14,15 To date, CEs are based primarily on the following materials: metals, metallic compounds, carbon derivatives, conducting polymers, and composite materials.12 The surfaces of Pt CEs can adsorb sulfur atoms in electrolytes, leading to poor conductivity and low catalytic activity. To address this limitation, in the recent literature Cu2S, MoS2, PbS, NiS, and CoS have been considered as counter electrodes in QDSSCs due to their good catalytic activity in polysulfide electrolytes; however, they suffered continual corrosion and ultimately mechanical instability under operating conditions.6,15–18 Accordingly, various composite CEs comprising TiN NPs/CNTs-RGO, Fe2S/Ni foam, CuS/CoS, CoS/NiS, NiS/PbS, PbS/carbon and CuS NPs/carbon nanofibers were extensively researched to further increase their electrocatalytic properties in QDSSCs.15,19–24 The QDSSCs consisting of the CdS/CdSe photoanodes and composite CoS/NiS CEs obtained a higher PCE of 3.40%, compared with NiS (2.61%), CoS (2.53%), and Pt (1.47%) CEs. The QDSSCs fabricated by incorporating composite Cu2S–SiW12/MoS2 CEs and CdS photoanodes, according to our previous work, show PCEs of 4.28% (Cu2S–SiW12/MoS2), 2.90% (Cu2S–MoS2), 2.45% (Cu2S), 2.18% (SiW12/MoS2) and 1.25% (MoS2).20,25
Co3O4 is a widely studied metal oxide, which is a p-type semiconductor found in abundance.26 Co3O4 has a spinel crystal structure resulting from the cubic closed packing array, in which the Co(II) ions and Co(III) ions occupy the 8a position of the tetrahedron and the 16d position of the octahedron, respectively.27–31 Co3O4 is also a superior catalyst, which has been applied in supercapacitors, magnetic lithium ion batteries, CO gas sensors and so on.32–35
Polyoxometalates (POM) are a group of multinuclear transition metal oxygen cluster compounds. POMs with strong oxidizing properties can be used to receive electrons and transmit photo-generated electrons. Therefore, selecting a suitable polyoxometalate to compound it with a semiconductor material could promote electron–hole separation and improve the efficiency of electron transport, thereby optimizing the cell performance. The lower Rs and Rct suggest that the addition of PW12 can facilitate the transport of charge carriers, which decreases the electron–hole recombination.36–40
Our group previously added POMs to MoS2 to improve the photovoltaic performance, and also obtained significant performance enhancement.25 In this work, QDSSCs based on CdS/TiO2 as photoanodes and the composite film of PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S as CEs were assembled. Here, Co3O4 nanorods doped with polyoxometalates were used for the first time to accelerate electron transfer and a composite film with Cu2S was fabricated to further improve the efficiency and stability of the cell. The composite CEs showed good electrocatalytic activity in agreement with EIS and Tafel test results. Specifically, under standard light intensity (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the power efficiency of the QDSSCs fabricated with the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S counter electrode can reach 4.67%, exceeding those of other QDSSCs fabricated with Co3O4–Cu2S (4.20%), bare Cu2S (2.54%), PW12/Co3O4 (2.07%) and Co3O4 (1.30%) counter electrodes. This enhancement is mainly caused by POM's preventing holes from recombining with electrons at the counter electrode interface and accelerating electron transfer on the counter electrode, accompanied by the synergistic effect of other components on the device and the good band gap matching of Co3O4, PW12 and Cu2S.
Experimental details
Materials
Keggin-type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40·xH2O (PW12); cuprous chloride, (CuCl, AR), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, AR), Na2S·9H2O and S powder were purchased from Aladdin. Urea ((NH2)2CO), ethylene glycol, ethanol, ammonia (NH3·H2O) and thiourea (CH4N2S) were supplied by Beijing Chemical Works. Co(NO3)2·6H2O were obtained from Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd. CdCl2 and NH4Cl were obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co. Titanium chloride (TiCl4) was obtained from Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). All materials were used directly without further processing.
Preparation of Co3O4
The Co3O4 and 2CoCO3·3Co(OH)2·H2O were synthesized by the literature method.27,41 2CoCO3·3Co(OH)2·H2O was synthesized from Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.582 g) and urea (0.60 g) in 40 mL deionized water under constant stirring for 40 min. Then, the mixed solution was transferred into a 80 mL sealed Teflon-lined stainless autoclave heated at 120 °C for 6 h. The precipitates obtained through centrifugation were washed repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol. The products were dried at 60 °C in an oven for 12 h. Co3O4 was obtained by calcining the precursors at 400 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 in air. Then they were cooled to room temperature to obtain the desired product.
Preparation of Cu2S
Cu2S was prepared using a simple solvothermal process in a 100 mL autoclave according to the literature procedure.18 0.2 g CuCl, an appropriate amount of PVP and 0.3 g CH4N2S were dissolved in ethylene glycol (20 mL) and ethanol (20 mL) forming mixed solution. The suspension was stirred for 40 min and transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then maintained at 150 °C for 12 h. The resulting black precipitates were collected by centrifugation, and washed repeatedly with ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 10 h.
Fabrication of the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S composite counter electrode
Cu2S and terpineol were uniformly mixed in a weight ratio of 1:3, a small amount of ethanol was added to grind with an agate mortar and made into a paste. The paste was printed on a 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm FTO via screen printing and heated at 80 °C for 30 min. In the same way, Co3O4 slurry doped with 0.1 mol L−1 phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40·xH2O) was screen printed on the Cu2S thin film and dried at 80 °C for 30 minutes. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the FTO film was subjected to an annealing treatment at 320 °C for 35 minutes to improve its firmness.
Fabrication of CdS QDSSCs
According to our prior studies, P25 (TiO2) and terpineol were ball-milled at a weight ratio of 1:6.5 for 16 hours to form a slurry. The TiO2 film was prepared via scraping and dried at 80 °C, and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The sintered TiO2 films were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to achieve passivation surface defects and reduce the electron–hole recombination rate at the TiO2/polysulfide electrolyte interface.42 The CdS films were fabricated via chemical bath deposition (CBD). CH4N2S (0.533 g), CdCl2 (0.183 g), NH4Cl (0.177 g) were dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water and the pH was adjusted to 9.5 with ammonia, and the TiO2 film was soaked in the solution for 4 h.43 The polysulfide electrolyte (1.201 g Na2S·9H2O, 0.04 g S, 0.1491 g KCl) was injected between the TiO2/TiCl4/CdS photoanode and the counter electrode (PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S, Co3O4–Cu2S, Co3O4, Cu2S, PW12/Co3O4), and sealed with a hot melt adhesive to prepare a sandwich-shaped cell. The active area of cell was specified as 0.12 cm−2.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements made use of a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (l = 1.5418 Å) radiation and recording scope from 15 to 80° at normal temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a USWHA 150 photoelectron spectrometer with an achromatic monochromatic light source Al Kα (1486.6 eV). The morphology and composition of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU-8000 FE-SEM) with energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEM-2100 PLUS microscope under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. At room temperature, the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves were obtained on a CHI661D Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corp. China) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). To evaluate the electrochemical catalytic properties of the counter electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization measurements were performed at room temperature using the same electrochemical workstation. EIS was performed at 0 V in frequency ranging from 10−1 Hz to 105 Hz. Tafel-polarization curves were obtained using a symmetric cells test with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
Result and discussion
Morphology and composition
The morphology was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1(a and b), it was observed that the Co3O4 nanorods are composed of nanoparticles. Fig. 1(c–e) showed the images of Cu2S nanoflakes. Meanwhile, TEM and HRTEM measurements were performed to further observe the internal structure of the samples. It was confirmed that Co3O4 nanoparticles aggregated to form Co3O4 nanorods and Cu2S were composed of nanoflakes, as shown in Fig. 1(f and h). The HRTEM images of Co3O4 and Cu2S showed that the crystal lattices of d = 0.24 nm and d = 0.19 nm can be indexed to the Co3O4 and Cu2S phase (Fig. 1g and i), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the thickness of the composite film PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S was found to be about 9.18 μm from the cross-sectional images. According to the EDX mapping tests, Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), the signals of P, W, O, Co, Cu, S elements are observed, indicating that the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S film is successfully fabricated as the composite counter electrode and were well-distributed throughout the composite film.

In order to better prove the composition of the obtained sample, XRD measurement was performed. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD pattern in conformity with the Cu2S sample. The observed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.2°, 27.9°, 29.2°, 30.9°, 32.2°, 46.4° and 47.9°, were attributed to the diffractions from the [104], [222], [132], [041], [721] and [532] planes. This indicated that pure Cu2S (JCPDS No. 33-0490) was formed.44 In Fig. 3(b), the diffraction peaks at 18.9°, 31.37°, 38.61°, 44.93°, 55.5°, 62.5° and 77.62° assigned to the crystal planes of [111], [220], [311], [222], [400], [422], [511], [440] and [533], demonstrate that Co3O4 with high purity was synthesized successfully, and the peaks were indexed to the spiked Co3O4 phase (JCPDS card No. 42-1467).45

The surface chemical elemental composition and the corresponding valence states of the synthesized Co3O4 and Cu2S materials were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). the survey scan XPS spectrum (Fig. 4e and f) confirmed the existence of Cu, S, Co and O in Cu2S and Co3O4, respectively. The Co 2p3/2 peak near 780.5 eV and the Co 2p1/2 peak at 795.6 eV (Fig. 4a) were attributed to the presence of Co 2p in Co3O4. Between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 there is a spin energy interval of about 15 eV, which is in agreement with the standard spectrum of Co3O4. In Fig. 4b, the peaks at about 530.0 eV and 531.3 eV could be attributed to the oxygen species in the Co3O4 phase and the oxygen in the hydroxyl group, respectively. The information provided above proved that the synthesized product is Co3O4. The binding energies of about 931.8 eV and 951.8 eV of two main peaks belonged to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 (Fig. 4c), and are close to the data for Cu2S. The peak corresponding to S 2p (Fig. 4d) was 162 eV and there was no peak near 163.9 eV, demonstrating that the valence of S in the sample was S2−. Based on the above results, it was attributed to S ions coordinated with Cu+ ions in Cu2S.

Electrochemical properties of the counter electrodes
We depended on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to investigate the electrocatalytic activity and charge transfer process of the as-prepared counter electrodes (CEs). Using Z-view software, the Nyquist plots fitted curves are shown in Fig. 5a and b. From the Nyquist diagram, the first starting point represents Rs that is the series resistance of the cell. The first circle is a high-frequency semicircle named Rct, which can estimate the charge transfer resistance, that is the charge transfer process between the counter electrode and the electrolyte. The Rw is the diffusion resistance in the low frequency region, which is provided by the electrolyte. Zw is a Warburg diffusion resistance provided by a polysulfide electrolyte in the low frequency region. The Rs also influences the electron transport between the FTO and the catalytic film, a lower Rs indicates a better electron transport. As the Rs of the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S CE (1.629 Ω) is the lowest compared to other counter electrodes, the electron transfer should be the fastest. As shown in Table 1, it can be observed that the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S CE has a lower Rct value (0.32 Ω), which is much smaller than those of Co3O4–Cu2S, Cu2S, PW12/Co3O4 and Co3O4 CEs (0.39, 1,923, 3.225, and 4.332 Ω, respectively). The good band gap matching of Co3O4 (−4.7 eV, AVS), PW12 (−4.72 eV, AVS)46 and Cu2S (−4.44 eV, AVS) are conducive to the transmission of electrons. In addition, PW12 serving as one of the polyoxometalates can improve device performance and effectively block holes, thereby preventing holes from recombining with electrons at the counter electrode interface and accelerating the transfer of electrons on the counter electrode. Remarkably, PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance because PW12 has good electron transport capabilities, accompanied by QDSSCs having an excellent photovoltaic performance. In order to further explore the electro-catalytic performance of different CEs, Tafel polarization measurements were conducted on the same symmetrical batteries in EIS. A Tafel curve is theoretically divided into three major regions, as displayed in Fig. 6. The first region is the polarization zone where the voltage is small. The second region is called the Tafel zone at the median potential, which has a higher slope value. The third region is named the diffusion region where the potential is high and the curve usually shows a horizontal shape.47 The latter two parts correlated with the catalytic performance of the CEs, namely the Tafel region and the diffusion region. The Tafel curve can also supply two important parameters: the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting current density (Jlim). J0 can be obtained from the intersection of the cathodic branch in the Tafel zone and the equilibrium potential line.48 However, J0 and Rct are related by eqn (1) (1)

J
lim is the limit value of the faradaic current, which can be determined from the current density value in the diffusion region.47 The J0 varies inversely with Rct, and J0 is in the order of PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S > Co3O4–Cu2S > Cu2S > PW12/Co3O4 > Co3O4. The Tafel polarization results show that the catalytic activity of the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S CE is more outstanding than those of Co3O4–Cu2S, Cu2S, PW12/Co3O4 and Co3O4 CEs, corresponding to the result of Nyquist plots.
Photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs
The QDSSCs were assembled and tested with different thin film counter electrodes to study the photovoltaic performance under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G. Fig. 7 shows the current–voltage (J–V) curve properties of the solar cells and related photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE listed in Table 1. It can be found from Table 1 that bare Co3O4 (1.3%) has poor photovoltaic properties. To obtain better photovoltaic performance, Co3O4 CEs were used in combination with PW12 and Cu2S, respectively, and the solar cell efficiency was increased from 1.3% to 2.07% and 4.2%. Owing to the matching of the band gaps of PW12 (−4.72 eV, AVS), Co3O4 (−4.7 eV, AVS) and Cu2S (−4.44 eV, AVS), Cu2S shows good electrical conductivity and PW12 can play the important role as an electron transport channel, due to which solar cells with PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S CEs can achieve an efficiency of 4.67%.

The diagram of the relevant mechanism is shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen from the schematic diagram, considering the conduction band of Co3O4 (−4.7 eV, AVS), PW12 (−4.72 eV, AVS) and Cu2S (−4.44 eV, AVS), the electrons are transferred in the order of Cu2S, Co3O4 and PW12, as good band gap matching is conducive to the transmission of electrons. Polyoxometalates (POMs) can improve device performance and effectively block holes, and thereby prevent holes from recombining with electrons at the counter electrode interface and accelerating the transfer of electrons on the counter electrode. In additon, TiCl4 is used as a passivation layer to passivate surface defects and reduce the hole–electron recombination rate at the TiO2/polysulfide electrolyte interface.

Conclusions
In summary, Co3O4 prepared by simple hydrothermal and air calcination methods was fabricated into the PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S composite film via screen printing. The improvement of the photovoltaic performance should be related to the band matching of the PW12 (4.72 eV, AVS), Co3O4 (4.7 eV, AVS), and Cu2S (−4.44 eV, AVS) with PW12 serving as POM, which act as an intermediary in the electronic transmission. Experimental results reveal that the composite film PW12/Co3O4–Cu2S has excellent electrocatalytic performance and high photoelectric conversion efficiency reaching 4.67%, which is 46%, 55.6%, and 72%, respectively, higher than those of Cu2S, PW12/Co3O4 and Co3O4 CEs. The above results show that this composite film can be used as an alternative option for QDSSC counter electrodes.
