    , Accepted 10th March 2021First published on 11th March 2021AbstractA typical solution-processed perovskite film possesses numerous defects, especially when fabricated under high-humidity ambient conditions, which severely limits the performance of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the unique fluorescent dye molecule additive of 3-(2-benzimidazolyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin (8GFF) is introduced into a perovskite film to address the defect issues. With the addition of 8GFF, its functional groups (–COO) can interact with Pb2+ ions, thereby minimizing the ionic defects in the perovskite film and improving its crystalline quality. And the optimized charge transport with decreased recombination loss can also be realized. Besides, the introduction of 8GFF increases the absorption capacity of the device in a green light wave band, beneficial for photocurrent enhancement. Consequently, the device fabricated in an air environment without a glove box exhibits a promising efficiency of 19.16%, superior to 15.61% of the control device. This work demonstrates the potential applications for fabricating high-performance planar devices regarding the aspects of fluorescent dyes.
Introduction
As of 2020, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has experienced an unprecedented rise from 3.8% to 25.5%.1,2 Such rapid developments in device performance indicate that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) could become competitive photovoltaic technology with Si-based solar cells.3–5 However, the state-of-the-art PSCs are generally produced in a glove box to minimize the effect of oxygen and humidity on the perovskite film.6 This is the crucial obstacle on their way towards industrial manufacturing and commercialization. Therefore, fabricating PSCs under ambient environment has attracted much attention in recent years. Regrettably, solution-processed perovskite films, particularly fabrication under air environment (high humidity), are prone to produce detrimental defects, such as surface/interface traps, Pb/I vacancies, etc.7,8 This leads to wide variance and poor reproducibility, limiting the commercialization of PSCs.9,10 Therefore, the defect passivation of perovskite films is critical for developing efficient and stable PSCs.11
To date, various strategies, including new deposition technologies,12–14 composition engineering,15–17 and use of additives,18–20 have been developed to fabricate high-quality perovskite films. Among them, additive engineering is regarded as one of the most promising strategies to obtain high-performance PSCs. As reported, the morphology, crystallinity and intrinsic defects/traps of perovskite films can be effectively optimized through the interactions of perovskite composition with additives, such as PCBM,21 polymers22 and semiconductor molecules.23 Among the numerous additives, dye molecules can not only enhance their light absorption properties, but also improve film crystallinity and passivate the defects. For example, Li et al. employed organic dyes (AQ310) as a passivator to the anti-solvent, which can efficiently minimize the defects and provide better stability. And the fabricated device showed a high PCE of 17.98% with an enhanced voltage and prolonged carrier recombination time.24 Zhou and co-workers utilized a zinc porphyrin dye with a typical D–π–A structure, for which the PCE was increased from 18.5% to 20.5%, and it also has been proved to be effective in inhibiting non-radiative recombination.25 Zhang et al. introduced dye N719 into mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskites, which leaded to larger grains and better film crystallinity by slowing down the crystallization process.26 Among the numerous dyes as additives for PSCs, the devices are always fabricated in a glovebox under inert conditions, which seriously limits the large-scale preparation of PSCs. Meanwhile, the high cost of dyes also restricts the commercial application of perovskite. Thus, exploring novel dye additives with a low cost as well as predominant performance that can passivate perovskite defects is highly desired.
3-(2-Benzimidazolyl)-7-(diethylamino)-coumarin (8GFF) is a low-cost fluorescent dye with high fluorescence emission efficiency.27 It displays strong absorption and radiates fluorescence in the near ultraviolet or visible light band, resulting in enhanced absorption capacity in a green light wave band. The chemical structure of 8GFF dye is shown in Fig. 1a. It is obvious that 8GFF contains multiple functional groups, such as the carbonyl group and benzene rings. To our knowledge, the carbonyl group (–COO) has been found to coordinate with Pb2+ cations.28,29 And the benzene rings are capable of increasing the hydrophobicity of perovskite films and improving device stability.30,31 In this regard, it can be a promising additive for PSCs.

Herein, we demonstrated the fluorescent dye molecule additive of 8GFF for fabricating a high-quality perovskite film in an air environment. With the modification of 8GFF, the perovskite film exhibits an improved morphology and crystalline with passivated ionic defects, leading to better charge extraction and reduced recombination loss. Moreover, the introduced of the 8GFF dye molecule can also increase the absorption capacity in a green light wave band. As a result, the champion device exhibits a PCE of 19.16%, which is superior to that of the control device (15.43%). In addition, the stability of the 8GFF treated device has also been significantly improved. This work demonstrates the potential applications of fluorescent dyes in the fabrication of high-performance planar devices.
Results and discussion
The possible interaction between the perovskite and 8GFF is displayed in Fig. 1b. With the addition of 8GFF into the perovskite, the carbonyl group (–COO) may coordinate with Pb2+ to passivate the defects. Hence, we speculate that the 8GFF dye additive can be a suitable passivator for perovskite layers and may protect the perovskite from moisture. These effects are verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1c. For the 8GFF dye, a strong CO bond can be found at 1697 cm−1, which corresponds to the carbonyl group. And the perovskite film demonstrates two bonds at 1469 cm−1 and 1631 cm−1. After the introduction of 8GFF into the perovskite film, a CO bond appears and slightly shifts to 1727 cm−1, suggesting the possible coordination of 8GFF and Pb2+. To further confirm this, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out. As presented in Fig. 1d, the introduction of the 8GFF additive leads to an ∼0.2 eV offset for Pb 4f peaks. This synergistically reveals the interaction between 8GFF and Pb on the perovskite surface.32 As is known, these interactions are beneficial to the preparation of high-quality films.
To investigate the effect of the 8GFF additive on the morphology of the perovskite film, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is carried out. The surface morphology of the pristine perovskite film and the 8GFF incorporated films with various amounts (0.1–0.3 mg mL−1) is displayed in Fig. 2a–d. And the size distributions of perovskite grains are exhibited in Fig. S1.† Obviously, with the concentration of 8GFF increasing from 0 to 0.2 mg mL−1, the grain sizes of the perovskite increase. Notably, the film containing 0.2 mg mL−1 (0.2-PVSK) exhibits a more uniform and dense morphology, with less grain boundaries and pinholes. However, when the concentration increases to 0.3 mg mL−1, a lot of smaller grains are obtained. This might be because the higher concentration of 8GFF restrains the film-forming performance of the perovskite.33 We also take cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to observe the crystal domains along the vertical direction. As displayed in Fig. 2e and f, with the 8GFF treatment, the crystals grow larger and have fewer pinholes, which is conductive to a high PCE. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. S2,† 0.2-PVSK turned black slightly slower than the pristine, implying that 8GFF can retard the crystallization rate through strong chelation with Pb2+.34 The improvement can be mainly ascribed to the positive effect of 8GFF on regulating the crystallization process of the perovskite film.

Moreover, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is utilized to characterize the flatness. As shown in Fig. 3a, the roughness reduces from 19.6 nm for the pristine film to 15.6 nm for the film based on 0.2 mg mL−1, indicating better film quality. This is consistent with the SEM results. And the crystallinity of these perovskite films is also investigated by XRD. In the XRD patterns (Fig. 3c), the diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 28.5° and 31.9° can be observed for all the PVSK films, which is well matched to the (110), (220), and (310) planes of perovskite, respectively.35 The diffraction intensities of the two 0.1-PVSK and 0.2-PVSK films are enhanced, compared with that of the pristine film. However, the film introduced with 0.3 mg mL−1 of 8GFF presents slightly weaker peak intensity than the pristine film. To further analyze the XRD patterns, we calculate the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the strong peak at 14.2°. As shown in Table S1,† the FWHM value decreases from 0.203 to 0.157 and then increases to 0.218, with the increase of 8GFF concentration. The smaller value of FWHM indicates a better crystallization of the perovskite.36 Therefore, the crystallization of 0.2-PVSK is higher than that of the pristine film. Besides, the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 3d, and the optional response is improved with the appropriate addition of 8GFF. Notably, the enhanced absorption is not only related to the better crystallinity, but also due to the incorporation of 8GFF. From the SEM images and XRD patterns, there is no doubt that we have obtained better crystallinity. In order to clarify the effect of 8GFF, we unutilized photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements, as shown in Fig. S3a.† The fluorescence peaks of 8GFF are substantially broadened from 440 nm to 500 nm, which is due to a wide PLE spectrum. And its own fluorescence properties make it emit fluorescence at 550 nm to increase the light harvesting of the perovskite. Meanwhile, the obviously improved IPCE spectra in the overlapping range (300–550 nm) also illustrate the effect of 8GFF. Overall, 8GFF is a promising additive in the perovskite and improves the photoresponse of perovskite.

In order to know the influence of the 8GFF additive on device performance, a planar device with a configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag is fabricated. The J–V curves of the PSCs with different 8GFF concentrations are displayed in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. When the concentration of 8GFF is increased from 0 mg mL−1 to 0.3 mg mL−1, the PCE of the PSCs increases and reaches the highest value, and then decreases. Encouragingly, the best device efficiency of 19.16% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 23.10 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.40% is obtained by the device based on 0.2 mg mL−1. These values are superior to those of the control device with a PCE of 15.61%, Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 20.14 mA cm−2, and FF of 72.43%. We also investigate the J–V hysteresis of the champion device and the control device. As presented in Fig. 4b and c and Table S2,† a lower hysteresis of 4.12% is found for the champion device compared to that of the control one (8.58%). Meanwhile, detailed distributions of photovoltaic parameters based on the two types of devices are shown in Fig. 4d. These results show that the addition of 8GFF can improve the device performance effectively and the better performance is mainly attributed to the significantly improved Voc, FF and Jsc values.

The enhanced Voc and FF might be ascribed to the passivation effect induced by the incorporation of 8GFF, which improved the quality of the perovskite film and reduced the trap states. And the enhanced Jsc can be attributed to the increased light harvesting and charge separation.25 In order to clarify our assumption, photoluminescence (PL) measurements are employed to provide an in-depth understanding of the interfacial charge dynamics and combination behavior. The PL spectra of the perovskite films with or without 8GFF passivation deposited on glass (without the TiO2 layer) are provided in Fig. 5a. The PL intensity for 0.2-PVSK is significantly enhanced, indicating a relatively low non-radiative recombination loss. This result can be attributed to its improved crystallinity and fewer defects, which has been supported by XRD analyses. The passivation effect of 8GFF is further studied by time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. The data are fitted with a bi-exponential decay function as shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding parameters are displayed in Table S3.† With the addition of 8GFF, the fast decay lifetime (τ1) increases from 3.48 to 4.17 ns, and the slow decay lifetime (τ2) increases from 43.92 to 64.85 ns. Thus, the average lifetime increases from 20.06 ns to 33.91 ns, which further proves the better trap passivation effect and electronic properties. The longer exciton/carrier diffusion lengths are beneficial to high-performance devices. Besides, the defect density and related charge recombination behavior of perovskite films are investigated by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. A device with an electron-only structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag is demonstrated, and the relevant J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5c. The defect density of the device can be illustrated through the following equation:  where ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite.30,37 A relatively smaller trap density of 1.1 × 1017 cm−3 can be determined for the 0.2-PVSK device and 3.5 × 1017 cm−3 for the control device. This directly demonstrates that 8GFF is more conducive to passivating the defect density. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is conducted to measure the charge transport and recombination characteristics of PSCs. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist plots of the devices at a bias voltage of 0.9 V under dark conditions, and the relevant equivalent circuit model and related data are displayed in Fig. S4 and Table S3.† Similar series resistances (Rs) of 20.10 and 30.85 Ω are obtained from PSCs based on pristine and 8GFF, for the reason that they have the same structure.38 However, the device based on 0.2-PVSK has larger recombination resistance (Rrec) compared with the control one, indicating that the charge recombination is significantly suppressed. This is due to the reduction of the trap state density.39 Based on the above results, a better device with fewer trap states, better charge extraction and reduced recombination loss is obtained, which is consistent with our conjecture.

Finally, the influence of 8GFF on the moisture stability of the perovskite is also evaluated. The perovskite at room temperature with a relative humidity of 85 ± 10% is recorded by UV-vis, using a digital camera and XRD, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the absorption of 0.2-PVSK presents a slight change, whereas a continuous decrease is observed for the pristine perovskite film after 100 h of exposure. Besides, the corresponding digital photos are taken and exhibited in Fig. 6b. Apparently, the pristine perovskite film almost turns yellow after 100 h, whereas the 0.2-PVSK film has no obvious changes. We also record the XRD patterns to verify the degradation process, as shown in Fig. S5.† For the pristine device, there are relatively strong peaks at 12.5° and 38.5°, attributed to the (001) and (003) planes of PbI2. This suggests a complete degradation of the perovskite. By contrast, 0.2-PVSK still shows a strong (110) plane signal, indicating that this film has a stable structure. And the contact angle of the perovskite film is shown in Fig. S6.† A larger contact angel is obtained for 0.2-PVSK, which implies that the addition of 8GFF can improve the humidity resistance of the perovskite.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra, (b) photos of films exposed to ∼85 ± 10% RH at room temperature for 200 h and (c) moisture stability of the devices. 
Moreover, we test the moisture stability of the devices. As exhibited in Fig. 6c, the device based on 0.2-PVSK retains about 80% of its initial PCE after 100 h of storage at room temperature with a humidity of 85%. In contrast, the PSC without 8GFF passivation reduces to 12% of the initial value after 50 h. This is ascribed to the decrease of grain boundary density by 8GFF and the increase of hydrophobicity by the presence of benzene rings.36 These results confirm that the introduction of 8GFF is responsible for enhancing both the stability and efficiency of the device.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we develop a strategy to fabricate high performance planar PSCs by adding a fluorescent dye molecule 8GFF in an air environment. This approach minimizes the defect issue and increases the light harvesting through the interaction between the CO and un-coordinated Pb2+ ions in the perovskite. And the perovskite film possesses an improved crystalline quality and better flatness. Under the action of this dye, a promising conversion efficiency of 19.16% is achieved for PSCs in an air environment without a glove box, which is superior to that of the control device (15.61%). Besides, the moisture stability of the perovskite film as well as the device in high humidity also has been improved. This optimized process shows a potential application of fluorescent dyes in the fabrication of high-performance planar devices.
