    , Accepted 26th May 2022First published on 26th May 2022AbstractIn the context of the development of coordination energy-harvesting systems, the axial bonding of cobalt(II) octakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxy)phthalocyanine (1) with gold(III) 2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-4-yl)- and (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-3-yl)porphin (2 and 3), the structure, the spectral/electrochemical properties of the resulting donor–acceptor complexes and photoinduced electron transfer in them are studied. The process of the dyad formation passing as self-assembly in the donor–acceptor phthalocyanine–porphyrin systems was explored using UV-Visible, IR, and 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The geometric and electronic structures of the dyads were identified using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. The electron transfer in the coordination complexes studied was confirmed by recording the radical ion pairs namely 1˙+:2˙−/1˙+:3˙− and measuring the kinetics of the photoinduction and decay of these states by a femtosecond laser photolysis technique. The effect of the gold(III) porphyrin macrocycle nature in the lifetime of radical ion pairs was shown. The redox potential values for the coordination dyads and the photoelectrochemical parameters defining their perspective in design and understanding of PET systems were observed using the cyclic voltammetry/amperometry methods and the short-circuited electrochemical cell Ti|a dyad film|0.5 M Na2SO4|Pt, respectively.
Introduction
The huge interest in photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in donor–acceptor (D–A) complexes has stimulated numerous investigations of systems with both fullerene1,2 and non-fullerene3–5 acceptors (FAs and NFAs, respectively). The development of new effective acceptors required for high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs) has received more attention over the past decade. A number of reviews6–10 devoted to design or study of both covalent and non-covalent donor–acceptor porphyrin/phthalocyanine – fullerene systems have been published during this time. The interactions between a donor and an acceptor within these systems are important for the improving of multi-component systems for photoactive materials and light-harvesting devices.11,12 Despite the fact, that fullerene and their derivatives are very popular electron acceptors in artificial photosynthetic models, recent developments in this field have launched a series of new opportunities for OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors. At present, non-fullerene acceptors are potential substitutes for fullerenes which can be used to further improve the characteristics of OSCs due to their properties.
The use of small molecule acceptors (SMAs), namely perylene diimides as NFAs was described in the works.13–16 NFAs of this class exhibit electron affinities comparable with those of FAs, strong absorption, high μe in field-effect transistors, because of the intermolecular π stacking, and high thermal/oxidative stability.13 The property that makes perylene diimides such a big research topic is their tunability. They can be modified largely than fullerene acceptors.
The development of porphyrin-based NFAs has also attracted attention in recent years.17–19 The introduction of perylene diimide,20 naphthalene diimide,21 ladder-type arenes22,23 in the macrocycle contributes to change of the porphyrin molecular characteristics. For example, the incorporation of different electron withdrawing groups in the porphyrin macrocycle promotes the π-conjugation lengthening, the broadening of the range of spectral absorption to the near-infrared region (near-IR) and increases the success of porphyrin in organic electronics.24,25 Cuesta et al.24 have designed and studied donor–acceptor molecules different composition (D–A–D or A–D–A) based on connected through ethynyl π-linkers zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnP) and 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DT-DPP) as D and A, respectively. These systems in conjunction with methyl ether [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butanoic acid (PC71BM) have shown high photovoltaic parameters and PCE of 7.04 and 8.03%, correspondingly, which indicate their efficient as components of solution processed bulk heterojunction OSCs.
Gold(III) porphyrins are an another example of porphyrin-based NFAs due to their ability to be easily chemically or photochemically reduced.26 Covalent bonding of D and A molecular units, such as zinc(II) porphyrin and gold(III) porphyrin, is described in the works.27–31 Preiß et al.28 have established that [ZnIIP–AuIIIP]+ dyad (P is tetraarylporphyrin) undergo ultrafast PET with the rate constant kET1 > 1010 s−1. Fortage et al.29 have synthesized heterometallic dyad composed of zinc porphyrin linked by bisethynyl quaterthiophene to a gold porphyrin and characterized its by electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry, and femtosecond transient absorption spectrocopy. It was found that the light excitation of zinc or gold porphyrin induces the very fast and quantitative charge separation at which the lifetime of the charge-separated state is 3.3 ns in toluene and 100 ps in dichloromethane.29 The zinc porphyrin – gold porphyrin dyad linked through the ethynyl spacer has shown the lifetime of the charge-separated state about 4 ns.31
The vertically linked “aluminum(III) porphyrin–gold(III) porphyrin” (AlP–AuP+) dyad and two corresponding self-assembled “tetrathiafulvalene–aluminum(III) porphyrin–gold(III) porphyrin” (TTF-py–AlP–AuP+ and TTF-Ph-py–AlP–AuP+) triads were synthesized.32 Steady-state and femtosecond transient absorption studies have showed that the lifetime of the charge separated state in the photoexcited dyad and triads exhibits the increase from 27.26 ps in AlP–AuP+ to 1393 ps and 1484 ps in TTF-py–AlP–AuP+ and TTF-Ph-py–AlP–AuP+, respectively. These results show the successful charge stabilization in the triads where the AlP acts as a photosensitizer and primary electron donor while AuP and TTF bonded axially serve as A and D, respectively.32
The functionalization of gold porphyrin by pyridine units allows to construct of D–A systems by metal – ligand axial coordination. El-Khouly et al.33 have constructed a light harvesting supramolecular dyad based on meso-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin gold(III) chloride (AuPpy) axially coordinated with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). The significant quenching of the singlet excited ZnPc emission with the AuPpy addition and displaying of the characteristic absorption band of the zinc phthalocyanine radical cation in the NIR spectral region observed by a femtosecond laser photolysis technique suggests the electron transfer from the singlet excited ZnPc to AuPpy.33
Among a large number of macroheterocyclic compounds, cobalt(II) porphyrins/phthalocyanines are suitable candidates for constructing “axial-bonding” type PET systems. The porphyrin/phthalocyanine Co center bonds pyridyl-substituted fullerenes giving the five- or six-coordinated complex.34–44 The photoinduced electron transfer in these D–A systems was confirmed by the DFT, and cyclic voltammetry, and femtosecond absorption spectroscopy methods. The first result on the spectroscopic, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical study of the self-assembly of the triad based on cobalt(II) porphyrin and gold(III) porphyrin was presented in work.43 The analysis of the works34–44 has showed that the stability and the composition of the resulting donor–acceptor systems can be changed by varying the macrocycle nature.
In order to find novel PET supramolecular systems with improved practically important properties we have synthesized two new coordination dyads based on (octakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxy)phthalocyaninato)cobalt(II) (1) as electron donor and (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-4-yl)porphyrinato)gold(III) (2) or (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-3-yl)porphyrinato)gold(III) (3) chlorides as electron acceptor (Fig. 1). The use of gold porphyrins as electron acceptor is new and one of the active development directions in optoelectronics.

Experimental
Synthesis of the precursors for the coordination complexes
(2,3,7,8,12,18-Hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-4-yl)porphinato)gold(III), 2 and (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-3-yl)porphinato)gold(III), 3 chlorides were prepared by the reaction of corresponding porphyrins with KAuCl4.43 The synthetic details are given in ESI† together with 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectra (Fig. S1 and S2†). The synthesis of (octakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxy)phthalocyaninato)cobalt(II) (1) have been published elsewhere;40 its spectral characteristics are presented in Fig. S3.† All chemicals, solvents and chromatographic materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics and were used as received.
Methods

Kinetics. 
The kinetic measurements for the slow reaction of 1 and 2/3 were spectrophotometrically studied in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 298 K by the method of superfluous concentrations. The UV-vis spectra were recorded with an Agilent 8454 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance measurements were carried out for solution series at constant concentration of 1 (5.4 × 10−6 M) appropriate for measuring the phthalocyanine Q-band with different additions of gold(III) porphyrin (1.6 × 10−5–1.2 × 10−4 M). The gold(III) porphyrin spectrum of the same concentration as in the stock solution was used as a zero line. The first order rate constant values, kobs, were calculated using the equation:kobs = 1/τ·ln((A0 − A∞)/(Aτ − A∞))where A0, Aτ, and A∞ is the absorbance of the reaction mixture at the working wavelength at the time of 0, τ and at the end of the reaction. The relative error in kobs determination did not exceed 10%.


Thermodynamics. 
The equilibrium constant values for the reaction between 1 and 2/3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene were observed in the above series (CAuP from 1.0 × 10−6 to 1.2 × 10−4 M were taken) using a spectrophotometric titration method and calculated by the equation for a three-component equilibrium system with two colored compounds:  
Here, C0AuP and C01 is the initial concentration of 2/3 gold porphyrin and 1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, respectively; A0, Ai, and A∞ is the absorbance at a working wavelength of 1, an equilibrium mixture at a definite 2/3 concentration, and a reaction product, respectively. The relative error in K determination did not exceed 25%.
Kinetics and thermodynamics of each complexation reaction were studied in one reaction series due to using the time-dependent spectrophotometric titration method45 in which spectrophotometric titration data are collected in concentration and time fields.


NMR, IR and mass spectroscopy. 

1H NMR spectra of Co and Au complexes were recorded with Bruker Avance III-500 NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. IR spectra were recorded with VERTEX 80v spectrometer in KBr. The IR and 1H NMR spectra of the dyads were obtained using the solutions of the precursor mixtures with the molar ratio corresponding to the equivalence point upon titration. The solid samples of the dyads for the IR measurements were prepared by the vacuum removal of the solvent. Mass spectra of the same solids in CH2Cl2 were performed on an Axima Confidence (Shimadzu Biotech, a 337 nm nitrogen laser) spectrometer with a time-of-flight mass analyzer by recording the spectra in the positive-ion mode. Samples were put on the target in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrices.


Calculations. 
Computational calculations were performed without molecule symmetry constraints using Gaussian09 program package.46 DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP*47 level of theory with 6-31G48 basis set for nonmetal atoms (C, H, N, O, Cl) and the Lanl2DZ49 basis set for the Co and Au atoms. The molecular structures were visualized in ChemCraft software.50 The 500 lowest excitation states were chosen for TD-DFT calculations. The calculations were performed for isolated molecules and for these in the solvent medium (toluene). The calculations in the solvent medium were conducted by the polarizable continuum model.51 The cavity was built up by using the Universal Force Field (UFF) radii. The results from TD-DFT calculations were employed to construct molecular energy levels and isodensity plots. Contributions of compound atomic orbitals (AO) to molecular ones (MO) were calculated by the Chemissian 4.01 program package.52 The AO to MO contribution was evaluated through the direct LCAO-MO expansion. The bonding energy was calculated as following:Ebonding = |E(AuP)CoPc − (EAup + ECoPc)|Λ parameter53 and Δr-index54 for the excited states were calculated with the Multiwfn 3.8 program.55


Electrochemistry. 
Cyclic voltammetric experiments (dichloromethane, 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NClO4) were performed on a Solartron SI 1260 using a three-electrode system (the working electrode: a platinum button, the counter electrode: a platinum wire, the reference electrode: a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). Cyclic voltammograms were measured at the potential sweep rate of 1000 mV s−1. The studied compound concentrations were as follows: C1 = 1.53 × 10−4 M, C2 = 1.75 × 10−3 M, C3 = 1.83 × 10−3 M. All solutions were purged from the dioxygen prior to electrochemical measurements using an argon gas.


Femtosecond laser photolysis setup. 
Transient absorption spectra were measured using a femtosecond pump–supercontinuum probe setup previously described.56
The output of Ti:Sapphire oscillator (800 nm, 80 MHz, 30 fs, “Tsunami”, Spectra-Physics, USA) was amplified by regenerative amplifier (“Spitfire Pro”, Spectra-Physics, USA). The repetition rate of the amplified laser pulses was set at 100 Hz.
The amplified pulses were split into two beams. One of the beams was focused into a nonlinear optical crystal (α-BBO) to produce the second harmonic radiation which was used as a pump pulse. The pump pulse had a Gaussian pulse shape centered at a wavelength of 400 nm, 50 fs duration, and 100 nJ pulse energy.
In a number of experiments pump pulse was prepared differently. A beam centered at a wavelength of 800 nm was directed into a parametric amplifier (“Topas-white”, Light Conversion, Lithuania), which generated a Gaussian pulse centered at a wavelength of 685 nm and a duration of 20 fs. The energy of the received pump pulse was 80 nJ.
The second beam was focused into a thin quartz cell with pure H2O to produce supercontinuum probe pulse.
The pump and probe pulses were delayed relative to each other by a computer-controlled delay line in the range of 0–500 ps, with a resolution from 3.3 fs to 1 ps. The pulses were then attenuated, recombined, and focused onto the flow sample cell. The pump and probe light spots had diameters of 300 and 120 μm, respectively. The relative polarizations of pump and probe beams were adjusted to 54.7° (magic angle).
The experiments were carried out at 278 K. The circulation rate in the flow cell was fast enough to avoid multiple excitations in the sample volume.
The supercontinuum probe signal out of the sample was dispersed by a polychromator (“Acton SP-300”, Roper Scientific, USA) and detected by CCD camera (“Newton”, Andor, USA). Transient absorption spectral changes ΔA(t, λ) were recorded within the range of 380–900 nm. The measured spectra were corrected for group delay dispersion of the supercontinuum using the procedure described previously.57,58 The zero time delay between pump and probe pulse was determined in control experiments by recording the signal of a non-resonant coherent burst from pure 1,2-dichlorobenzene.


Photoactivity. 
Photoelectrochemical properties of a titanium electrode with the natural oxide film (NOF) modified by 1 and its donor–acceptor complexes with 2/3 were studied in a quartz cell (92–95% of light transmission) at 298 K. The samples were illuminated by the monochromatic ultraviolet light (365 nm) using MiniMAX UV – 5A/F (5-Watt Battery-Operated UV Lamp). The lamp incident light intensity was equal to 1.5 mW cm−2. A photocurrent density (jph) was measured in a short-circuited electrochemical cell Ti|film|0.5 M Na2SO4|Pt equipped with a voltmeter B7–77. The distance between electrodes was 2 mm. An efficiency coefficient of the incident photon energy conversion to current (IPCE365 nm) was determined for examined samples. IPCE365 nm being a “monochromatic version” of the external quantum efficiency can be calculated according to the equation: IPCE365 nm = (1240·jsc)(λ·Pin), where jsc, λ, and Pin is the short-circuit current density, mA cm−2; the wavelength of the monochromatic light, nm; the incident radiant power, mW cm−2.

Results and discussion
Formation of supramolecular dyads
The UV-vis spectrum of 1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene has the strong absorption band in the near-IR region at 677 nm in addition to weak absorption bands at 646 nm and 607 nm. 2/3 exhibits the absorption bands at 398 nm (Soret band), 512 nm and 551 nm (Q bands). It can expect, given this observation, that the absorption bands of the D–A complexes based on 1 and 2/3 will cover a wide range of the solar spectrum in the UV-visible-NIR region (Fig. S4†).
The reaction of the 2/3 coordination with 1, which proceed as the slow two-way process, was studied by the spectrophotometric methods. To determine the numerical values of the stability constant (the equilibrium constant of complexation, K) and the composition of the obtained coordination complex, titration curves and plots of an indicator ratio vs. logCAuP at the end of the reactions (τ = ∞) in all reaction mixtures were constructed. The 2 bonding with 1 is characterized by the Q-band intensity increase and its hypsochromic shift from 677 to 673 nm (Fig. 2a). The similar spectral changes are observed for the reaction 1 with 3 (Fig. S5a†). As it follows from the slope of the logI − logCAuP dependence (Fig. 2b and S5b†), 1 bonds one gold porphyrin molecule forming donor–acceptor dyads. This finding is further confirmed by Job's experiment for these systems (Fig. S5(c and d)†). Fig. S5(c and d)† confirms 1:1 complexation between 1 and gold(III) porphyrins at the end of the reactions. The K values of (8.50 ± 1.46) × 104 and (9.66 ± 1.97) × 104 L mol−1 for 1:2 and 1:3, respectively, were calculated using data of the Fig. 2b and S5b.†

The reaction rate constants (kobs) for the 1–2 and 1–3 systems (Table S1†) are approximately the same and independent of CAuP. The zero order of reaction with respect to Au porphyrin indicates the complexity of the 1:2/1:3 formation mechanism. Based on the data obtained, we can assume a two-stage mechanism for the reactions of the dyad formation including the instantaneous equilibrium with the formation of the triads, followed by a slow displacement of the one AuP molecule from coordination sphere with the dyad formation. The triad formation is confirmed by the construction the titration curve and the logI − logCAuP plot at τ = 0 in all reaction mixtures (Fig. S6†).
The 1:2K value is higher by a factor of around 3 than that for the 3 analog, which can be explained by the effect of the spatially advantageous position of the coordinating N atom of pyridyl. This effect is reflected in values of such important structural parameters as an N–Mn–N angle and a Mn–NAuP distance, a bonding energy and a HOMO–LUMO gap for the dyads (see Computational calculations).
The stability of phthalocyanine–fullerene and phthalocyanine–porphyrin dyads which characterized by the equilibrium constant of complexation, K, increases in the series:

1:Py3C60* ((3.42 ± 0.47) × 103 L mol−1)41 < 1:2 ((8.50 ± 1.46) × 104 L mol−1) < 1:3 ((9.66 ± 1.97) × 104 L mol−1) < 1:Py3C60** ((1.84 ± 0.16) × 105 L mol−1)37 < 1:PyC60 ((5.62 ± 1.22) × 105 L mol−1)59 < 1:ImC60 ((6.60 ± 1.13) × 105 L mol−1),40 where Py3C60* is 2′-(pyridin-4-yl)-5′-(pyridin-2-yl)-1′-(pyridine-3-ylmethyl)pyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,2][60]fullerene, Py3C60** is 2′-(pyridin-4-yl)-5′-(pyridin-2-yl)-1′-(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)pyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,2][60]fullerene, PyC60 is 1′-N-methyl-2′-(pyridin-4-yl)pyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,2][60]fullerene, ImC60 is 1′-N-methyl-2′-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-phenylpyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,2] [60]fullerene. The 1:2/1:3 stability is respective with the phthalocyanine–fullerene dyads. Thus, the replacement of electron acceptor in coordination dyads based on 1 slightly varies their stability, but does not change the composition of the coordination complexes.
The physicochemical identification of the 1:2/1:3 structure was performed by using IR, 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass-spectrometry. The positive ion mass spectrum of the 1:3 dyad (Fig. 3) revealed the peak at m/z = 2928.41 corresponding to the molecular ion without Cl, [M − Cl]+. Similar result was obtained for 1:2 suggesting the existence of the donor–acceptor complex in the gas phase.
 Fig. 3  MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the 1:3 dyad. 
The IR spectra of the solid dyads contain the signals of characteristic vibrations of the phthalocyanine and porphyrin macrocycle moieties. The IR spectra of 2/3 in KBr tablets are similar and only differed in the position of the stretching and deformation vibrations of the 4-pyridyl/3-pyridyl group (see ESI†). The 1:2 spectrum together with the spectrum of its reference compound, 1 is presented in Fig. 4. Most bands attributed to vibrations of 1 are found in the dyad spectrum at the same or slightly shifted frequencies. So, the strongest bands of 1 at 2964, 1588, 1524, 1457, 1415, 1363, 1297, 1274, 1198, 1095, 1052, 961 cm−1 have their counter parts in the dyad spectrum at 2961, 1587, 1523, 1455, 1414, 1363, 1289, 1271, 1197, 1096, 1051, 960 cm−1. Many bands attributed to vibrations of 2 can be also found in the dyad spectrum. The νas(–CH2–), νs(–CH2–) and δas(–CH3) vibration signals are slightly shifted by 2–6 cm−1 in comparison with the vibration frequencies of uncoordinated gold porphyrin and appear in the dyad spectrum at 2924, 2852 and 1385 cm−1, respectively. The stretching and deformation vibrations of the pyridyl group of 2 are sensitive to axial bonding with the Co center in 1. So, ν(C–H) and δ(C–H) vibrations of the pyridyl group in 2 at 1721 and 739 cm−1 have their counter parts in the dyad spectrum at 1730 and 743 cm−1, respectively. The vibration corresponding to Co–N bond that is due to the formation of the donor–acceptor complex is observed at 432 cm−1. Its frequency changes comparing with ν(Co–N) in initial 1 which is found at 439 nm. This shift is probably related to the displacement of the Co atom out of plane of the phthalocyanine macrocycle as the result of the 1:2 formation. Similar changes in the IR spectrum are observed in the 1:3 dyad formation (Fig. S7†).
 Fig. 4  IR spectra of 1 and its dyad with 2 in KBr. Bands corresponding to vibrations of 2 are denoted with asterisks. 
The 1:3/1:21H NMR spectrum contains signals of both the phthalocyanine fragment and the porphyrin moiety (Fig. 5 and Table S2†). 1H NMR spectra of the initial D and A given in Fig. 5a, S1a and S2a† have confirmed the paramagnetic and diamagnetic nature of 160 and 3,28 respectively. It is worth noting shifts of signals in the dyad spectrum to both stronger field and weaker one relative to similar signals in the spectra of 1 and 3 (Table S2†) which indicate close spatial location of the phthalocyanine and porphyrin macrocycles. The 1 Hisoindole signals are significantly shifted to the high field by 4.92 and 4.94 ppm for the 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. The ortho-(Ho), para-(Hp) and tert-butyl substituents (HtBu) proton signals are also upfield shifted by 1.29, 0.57, and 0.4 ppm, respectively. The proton signals of gold porphyrins are less sensitive to the formation of donor–acceptor complexes. However, in the 1H NMR spectra of the dyads, we can observe broadening and a small upfield shift of the meso substituents and pyridyl/alkyl proton signals of porphyrin macrocycles by 0.02–0.07 ppm. The observed shifts in 1H NMR spectra confirm the change in the ring current effect of the phthalocyanine and porphyrin macrocycle due to the formation of the coordination complexes.

To additionally confirm the formation of the 1:2/1:3 dyads, their thermal stability and redox properties compared with 1 and 2/3 were studied by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. It is known that porphyrins and phthalocyanines have high thermal stability.61–64 Fig. S8a† shows the TGA curve of 1 and its first derivative (DTG), revealing high thermal stability with a mass loss of 4.47% between 25 and 443 °C, which is due to adsorbed solvent molecules rather than metallophthalocyanine degradation.61,65 A mass loss of 58.26% was observed from 443 to 494 °C, with maximum at 465 °C (DTG), which could be attributed to the degradation of macrocycle ring.
Decomposition of gold(III) porphyrin shown in Fig. S8b† on the example of 3 is the multi-stage process which includes the elimination both of solvent molecules and of the axial ligand between 25 and 230 °C and the thermal decomposition of the porphyrin macrocycle between 230 and 359 °C. In the case 1:3 (Fig. S8c†), the decomposition of dyad is one stage in the 377 °C to 489 °C range. Thus, the results of the TGA experiment point to the direct bonding between 1 and gold(III) porphyrin and high stability both of 1:3, and of individual 1.
The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of 1:2/1:3, 1 and 2/3 were obtained under the same experimental conditions. The CVs represented in Fig. 6 were recorded at potentials from −2.0 V to 2.5 V. 1 exhibits four anodic peaks at 1.61, 0.69, −0.23, −0.73 V and three cathodic peaks at 0.88, 0.13, −0.48 V corresponding to the cobalt oxidation/reduction reactions and the formation of π-cation and π-anion radicals, respectively.66

2 and 3 show the similar voltammetric behavior appropriate to their redox processes in CH2Cl2. The CVs of 2/3 are characterized by four reversible reduction peaks and associated oxidation peaks of gold porphyrins (Fig. 6 and Table S3†). As shown earlier,44 the first pair of peaks on the negative side of the CV corresponds to reduction and oxidation occur on the central metal, the other detected peaks correspond to the reactions which involve the π-ring system of the porphyrin macrocycle.
As shown in Fig. 6c, the voltammograms of 1:2 and 1:3 are essentially the sum of the peaks of 1 and 2/3 which are displaced relative to the individual components of dyads. The 1 oxidation peak was found to be cathodically shifted by 0.04 V and appeared at 0.65 V. In the region of positive potentials, 1:2 gives the reduction peak at 1.53 V and the associated peak at 1.59 V related to the oxidation of gold porphyrin. There is no second oxidation peak of the gold porphyrin moiety, which was observed for free 2 at 1.14 V, in the dyad voltammogram. In the region of negative potentials, the changes are also observed. They are reflected not only in the shift of the potentials (Table S3†), but also in the absence of the oxidation peak of gold porphyrin at −0.7 V. Similar voltammetric behavior was observed for 1:3. Thus, the shifts of redox potentials confirm the formation of the coordination dyads and the relationship between their donor and acceptor parts.
Computational calculations
To analyze the structural changes in the dyads under consideration the quantum-chemical optimization of an electronic and spatial structure were done. Since there are no experimental X-ray data or other reliable structural ones for the studied dyads in literature, the theoretical approach can become a tool for studying the structural features of dyads. The optimized structure for cation (1:3, 1:2) and molecular (1:3Cl, 1:2Cl) forms of dyads and their precursors were shown in Fig. 7, 8, S9 and S10.†
 Fig. 7  The selective bond lengths (Å) of 1, 2, 3. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
 Fig. 8  The selective bond lengths (Å) of 1:2 (a and b) and 1:3 (c). 
The bond length between cobalt and the nearest N atom is 1.96 Å. The experimentally determined values for 1 from the neutron-diffraction study are 1.908–1.915 Å.67 The optimized geometry of Au porphyrins has shown the average Au–N distances being 2.07 and 2.08 Å which is sufficiently close to the X-ray data for gold(III) mesoporphyrin IX dimethyl ester.68 The nature of the bonding between Cl− and Au3+ is not obvious. Some of the researches distinguish the Cl anion as outer sphere bonded by columbic interaction.69,70 The calculated Au–Cl distances are 3.06 and 3.09 Å in 2Cl and 3Cl, respectively, which is comparable to 3.01 Å from X-ray data.70 This bond length is longer than terminal Au–Cl bond in Au2Cl6 (2.29 Å). At the same time, calculated distances compare favorably with the sum of ionic radii (3.18 Å). The calculation for the gold(III) porphyrin molecular form leads to the following structural changes. The introduction of substituents in the porphyrin core leads to breaking the planarity of a molecule.68,71 The same trend was found in the 1:2Cl/1:3Cl structures. The planarity of Au porphyrin macrocycles is broken due to the presence of ethyl and pyridine substituents. The Au–C–N bond angle is 155.1° and 151.33° for 3Cl and 2Cl, respectively (Fig. S9†). The calculation for cationic 2 and 3 has shown the planar molecule; the introduction of the substituents in the porphyrin core does not have any effect for planarity (Fig. 7). To perform Au–Cl bond order analysis, three methods (Mulliken, Mayer, and Laplacian bond order72) were used (Table S4†). The Au–N and Au–Cl Mulliken and Mayer bond order was shown similar order of magnitude. The big differences between the Au–N and Au–Cl bond order values are found by Laplacian bond order analysis (Table S4†). Au–Cl bond order was around 0.06 while Au–N one was around 0.26. It can be due to the high polarity of the Au–Cl bond. This nature of a bond results in the easy Au–Cl dissociation in a solution, which was proved by the conductivity measurement in the dichloromethane 3 solution (Table S5†). In the crystal structure, the axial coordination of Cl− to Au cation can be expected, but this bond is dissociated in a polar solvent.
The dyads are formed by the axial coordination of 1 with the nitrogen atom from the Au porphyrin pyridine fragment (Fig. 8 and S10†). Both the geometries of the molecular forms of the dyads and the cation ones were optimized. The coordination Co–N bond length is 2.30 Å and does not depend on the type of porphyrins. The Au–Co–NPy angle is very sensitive to the type of Au porphyrins. It is much bigger in 1:3Cl (28.44°) than in 1:2Cl (8.22°) for dyads with Cl anion, which leads to the shorter distance by 0.78 Å between Au and Co atoms in the first dyad (Fig. S10†). Along with the different geometry of two Au porphyrins, the intermolecular interactions of substituents in porphyrin and phthalocyanine fragments have the impact on the spatial structure of the dyads. The ethyl substituents in 1:3Cl are quite close to the 3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxy substituents, which allow realizing weak intermolecular interaction. The geometry differences between cationic forms of dyads are more remarkable. The 2 orientation with respect to 1 is perpendicular; the Au–Co–NPy angle is 4.00° (Fig. 8). The axial symmetry is destroyed in 1:3; the Au–Co–NPy angle becomes 46.7°. This difference is reflected in the distances between Au and Co atoms. It is 8.46 Å and 10.21 Å in 1:3 and 1:2, respectively.
Bonding energy of both dyads is calculated as the difference between the total energy of the dyad minus the sum of the energies of the 1 and Au porphyrin entities. The obtained values are quite similar. According to the data using pure DFT functional, the value for 1:3Cl (15.26 kcal mol−1) is a bit higher than for 1:2Cl (13.55 kcal mol−1) for molecular systems. The difference becomes more noticeable in the case of the cation forms. For the bonding energy of the dyad formation is 17.85 kcal mol−1 and 12.42 kcal mol−1 for 1:3 and 1:2, respectively. This trend is in good agreement with the distances between Au and Co atoms. The obtained bonding energy is well tracked with the experimental observation of the approximately stability constant of 1:2 and 1:3 ((8.50 ± 1.46) × 104 and (9.66 ± 1.97) × 104 L mol−1, respectively).
Examination of the frontier molecular orbitals (MO) of the dyads and their precursors allows us to propose the charge separation mechanism in electron-transfer reactions of the dyads studied. Since the experimental measurements were done in polar and non-polar solvents, the MO levels for the molecular and cationic forms of the dyads were discussed. The energy diagrams of studies dyads and precursors MO levels together with the MO shapes are shown in Fig. 9 and S11.† The shapes of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for both Au porphyrins are similar. The HOMO is based on px atomic orbitals (AO) of Cl, dz2 AO of Au, and px AO of the closest to the Au atom nitrogen ones. The LUMO is based on AO of porphyrin atoms and dx2−y2 of Au. This composition is relevant for both Au porphyrins in the molecular forms. The small difference between two porphyrins is observed in the HOMO–LUMO gap. The 3Cl has a little bigger by 0.04 eV gap than 2Cl (Fig. S11†). The main difference in the frontier MO composition for the cationic forms comes from the absence of the Cl anion. It mainly affects to the HOMO levels. The HOMO orbital in the cationic form is constructed by the C and N AO orbitals of porphyrin core. The atoms from AuP coordination polyhedron do not impact to the HOMO composition. This composition leads to the increase of the HOMO–LUMO gap in the cationic forms to 2.25 eV compared with 1.83 eV in the molecular form.
 Fig. 9  Energy diagrams of the frontier MO (alpha) levels and its shapes (isodensity contour 0.03) for 1, 2, 3, 1:3 and 1:2 in toluene calculated using TD-UB3LYP*/6-31G (C, H, O, Cl) and Lanl2DZ (Co, Au) level of theory. 
The HOMO–LUMO gap for 1 is 2 eV. The HOMO is localized to the phthalocyanine core without contribution from metal AO. The LUMO is localized to both the phthalocyanine core and dxz AO of the Co atom.
Moving to the dyads, the differences in HOMO and LUMO composition becomes more noticeable. The 1:2 HOMO and LUMO is localized to the phthalocyanine moiety and to the porphyrin one, respectively. Such frontier MO provides 1˙+:2˙− radical pair due to the HOMO to LUMO electron transfer. The HOMO–LUMO composition for 1:2Cl in the molecular form remains the same (Fig. S11†). The 1:3Cl MO has different composition. These differences are caused from axial coordination of Cl anion. The HOMO and LUMO are localized only on Au porphyrin fragment. The first occupied molecular orbital that is based on the phthalocyanine moiety is HOMO−3. The 1˙+:3˙− radical pair can be obtained due to the HOMO−3 → LUMO electron transfer. The composition of frontier MO of 1:3Cl provides another radical pair, 1˙−:3˙+, due to the HOMO → LUMO+1 electron transfer. Such differences in the frontier MO shapes of dyads are the reason for the different behavior in femtosecond transient spectra in non-polar and polar solvents. In a polar solvent, one would expect the formation of the cationic forms of the dyads with 1˙+:2˙− and 1˙+:3˙− radical pair formation due to the HOMO to LUMO electron transfer.
The calculated absorption spectra of the dyads studied are shown in Fig. 10. The spectral profiles for both dyads are similar. Two characteristic bands, the Soret band at 400 nm and the Q bands assigned with the 1 part at 640 nm are clearly shown in the calculated spectra. The Soret band maximums are perfectly matched with the experimentally determined. The deviation of the Q band maximums from the experimental spectra is around 30 nm for both 1:3 and 1:2. Even though theoretical spectra were obtained for toluene solvent they are very close to the experimental ones. The testing calculation for 1:3 compound has shown an absence of significant difference between spectral profiles in toluene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene.
 Fig. 10  The calculated main absorption bands of the dyads. Insert is the spectral profile for 1:2 (red) and 1:3 (black) in the region of 550–800 nm (TD-UB3LYP*/6-31G (C, H, O, Cl) and Lanl2DZ (Co, Au)). 
The calculated wavelengths (λcal) of the electronic transition in the dyads together with their oscillator strengths and assignments of transitions are listed in Tables S6 and S7.† Only the electronic transitions having the significant oscillator strength (generally, higher than 0.01) are reported in these tables. The analyzing the MO shapes of the electron transaction most intensive bands have shown that most of them are localized into the 1 fragment. The S0–S46 electron transaction located at 637 nm being the most intensive (f = 0.458) in the whole 1:3 calculated spectrum are characterized by the βHOMO and βLUMO+4 configuration with 43% and the αHOMO and αLUMO+4 configuration with 38% (Table S6†). Another intensive longwave band with λcal = 640 nm is assigned to the βHOMO → βLUMO+3 and αHOMO → αLUMO+3 electron transactions with the contributions of 31% and 28%, respectively. A quite interesting electronic transaction with the oscillator strength of 0.4359 is located at 400 nm. The analysis of molecular orbital compositions (Table S6†) shows that this transition in 1:3 originates from αHOMO−26 on the phthalocyanine core with the small contribution of the metal d-orbital; αLUMO+2 is localized on the Au porphyrin moiety. The shape of the corresponding MO facilitates the formation of 1˙+:3˙− radical pair at this transaction.
The results of the analysis are more complex in the case of 1:2. Since the coordination of Au porphyrin moiety is perpendicular with respect to 1, there are very intensive electron transactions (at 396 nm, 395 nm, and 392 nm) originating from the axial bonding ligand. All these transactions originate from low energy HOMO's and LUMO+1/LUMO+2 configurations. One electronic transaction βHOMO−32 → βLUMO+1 with the contribution of 18% at 392 nm can be assigned to radical pair formation transaction (of 1˙+:2˙−). Another similar transaction localized at 394 nm originates from αHOMO−29 → αLUMO+2 with a minor contribution of 14%. The location of two most intensive band were calculated at 641 (f = 0.5138) and 396 nm (f = 1.2845). The first band is the superposition of two transactions with different impacts (βHOMO → L+3 (46%), αHOMO → L+3 (41%)), in which the electron density excitation localizes into the phthalocyanine core. The second band is the superposition of four transactions with different impacts from 16 to 25%, in which all electron excitations are characterized as the excitation in the Au porphyrin moiety.
The extent of charge transfer (CT) character was quantified through the analysis of lambda parameter (Λ)53 which is a measure of the spatial orbital overlap of electrons and holes in a given excitation. The Λ values are located in the range from 0 to 1. The lower values mean the long-range excitation (low overlap). The higher value means the short-range excitation (high-overlap). Another parameter to characterize physical origin of excitations is the distance covered during the excitation between the hole − particle pair interaction (Δr-index).54Λ roughly measures the overlap between a pair of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals involved in the ground-to-excited state transition53,73 and Δr-index aims at giving the effective hole–electron separation during the excitation.54,74 The calculated Λ and Δr-index values for all 500 excited states of 1:3 and 1:2 are shown in Table S8.†
The calculation at the UB3LYP/6-31G level of theory yields the Λ values in the range 0.18–0.66 and 0.29–0.67 for 1:3 and 1:2, respectively. The excitations displayed the biggest oscillation strength have three electronic transitions from S0 to S46, S292, S44 and two excitations to S312, S70 for 1:3 and 1:2, respectively. The transitions from S0 to S46, S292, S44 have Λ values of 0.66, 0.30, 0.55, respectively (Table S8†). In the case of the transaction S312, S70 for 1:2, Λ values are 0.61, 0.67, respectively. The transaction S0 → S46 in 1:3 and S0 → S312/S0 → S70 in 1:2 can be attributed to the short-range local excitation. The S0 → S292 transaction is the long-range local excitations. The exception is S0 → S44 for 1:3, which follows from the Λ values in the middle of 0 and 1. These statements also can be proved from Δr-index which gives the small distance for S0 → S46 (1.34 Å for 1:23) and S0 → S70 (0.5 Å for (1:2) and the large one (from 3.65 to 11.57 Å) for other intensive transactions.
Analysis of the frontier molecular orbital composition allows us to conclude that the charge transfer may be realized between αHOMO → αLUMO for 1:3 and 1:2 (Fig. 9). The TD-DFT modeling of electron transactions does not show electron density excitations of compositions above with the significant oscillation strength. Two αHOMO−26 → LUMO+2 transactions (34% and 52%) in 1:3 and the transactions βHOMO−32 → LUMO+1 (14%)/αHOMO−29 → LUMO+2 (14%) in 1:2 was found to have the sufficient intensity. These can be attributed as CT (Tables S6 and S7†). The Natural Transition Orbitals (NTO) analysis of high-intensity excited states of the investigated systems is shown in Tables S9 and S10† to analyze the nature of absorption. The occupied and unoccupied NTOs are referred to “hole” and “electron” transition orbitals, respectively. The NTOs generally give a simpler description of the excited state than the canonical orbitals.75 The excitation from S0 to S290 and S292 can be classified as charge transfer because of the “hole” NTOs delocalized over phthalocyanine and the “electron” over porphyrin parts. In the case of 1:2 only excitation from S0 to S315 has a similar distribution of hole and electron parts. This suggests charge transfer excitation.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies
The absorption UV-vis bands of the 1 and 1:2/1:3 units in their coordination dyads are well separated, providing the possibility for selective excitation of cobalt(II) phthalocyanine or gold(III)porphyrins. The femtosecond transient absorption measurements were performed at the excitation wavelength of 400 and 685 nm corresponding respectively to AuPs and 1 excitation in deaerated 1,2-dichlorobenzene that is stable under strong laser irradiation and demonstrates good solubility of the compounds studied. Fig. S12† shows the transient spectrum of the 1 at the indicated delay times. That is negative peaks at 612, 649 (sh), 678 nm corresponding to the ground state bleaching and positive peaks at 471, 713 and 825 nm corresponding to the excited state. The transient absorption spectra of the 1 excited at 400 nm and 685 nm are identical. The transient spectrum of the 2 shows in Fig. S13.† The negative peaks at 515, 551 nm corresponding to the ground state bleaching of 2 and positive peaks at 421, 613 nm corresponding to the excited state were observed. The positive peaks are decayed slowly similar to which happens for different gold porphyrins.32 The time constant was found to be 9693 ps which could be considered as a lower limit since the decay process was lasted beyond the monitoring time window of the instrument being 500 ps. Transient spectral features of the 3 are similar. The time constant was found to be 7319 ps.
The femtosecond transient absorption spectra of the 1:2 and 1:3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at the indicated delay times are shown in Fig. 11 and 12. The transient spectra recorded for 1:2 was revealed the spectral features corresponding to the 1˙+:2˙− radical pair. That is, the peak at 828 nm characteristic of 1˙+ and the broad absorption in range 572–600 nm corresponding to 2˙− were observed. Negative signals at 515, 551, and 678 nm having the contributions from the ground state bleach were also observed. The spectral features of 1:3 largely resemble that of 1:2 (Fig. 12a).

 Fig. 12  The femtosecond transient absorption spectrum in argon saturated 1,2-dichlorobenzene at the excitation wavelength of 400 nm (a) and the time profile of the transient peaks of 1:3 (b). 
The time constants for charge separation and charge recombination were obtained by fitting of the time profile of the 576 nm peaks for 1:2 and 1:3 (Fig. 11b and 12b). The rise time of 0.25 ps for 1:2 results in the rate of charge separation kCS = 4.0 × 1012 s−1 suggesting the occurrence of the ultrafast charge separation in the dyad. However, the decay was found to be biexponential (Fig. 11b) with the time constants of 1.75 and 478.79 ps resulting in the rate of the charge recombination kCR = 5.7 × 1011 s−1 and 2.1 × 109 s−1, respectively. In the case of 1:3, the time profile of the 576 nm peak (Fig. 11b) has revealed the rise time of 0.13 ps (kCS = 7.7 × 1012 s−1) together with the time constants of 1.27 ps (kCR = 7.8 × 1011 s−1) and 238.17 ps (kCR = 4.2 × 109 s−1). Thus, these results indicate the existence of electron transfer from 1 to coordinated 3/2 in the dyads. The differences in the time constants are probably related to the different composition and the shapes of frontier MO of dyads (see Computational calculations).
We have previously carried out the femtosecond transient absorption investigations for dyad based on 1 and 1′-N-methyl-2′-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-phenylpyrrolidino[3′,4′:1,2]-[60]fullerene (ImC60).40 The quantitative kinetic characteristics of the charge separation and recombination in 1:ImC60 differ from those for 1:3/1:2. The time constants of 478.79 and 238.17 ps for 1:2 and 1:3, respectively, are longer than that observed for 1:ImC60 (25 ps).40 The comparison of the kCR values indicates the faster charge recombination process in the case of 1:ImC60 due to the decreased donor–acceptor separation than that in 1:3/1:2. Thus, the variation of the axial coordinated acceptor in the 1 based D–A systems influences on the lifetime of their radical ion-pairs, which is very important in practical terms.
Photoelectrochemical parameters of the phthalocyanine–porphyrin dyads
Photoelectrochemical characteristics, namely photocurrent density and IPCE when samples were irradiated with monochromatic light at λ = 365 nm obtained for both dyads as well as their precursors are presented in Table 1. The film photocurrent density and IPCE365 nm were studied in a short-circuited electrochemical cell Ti|photoactive film|0.5 M Na2SO4|Pt. The photoactive films coating the titanium electrode surface covered with natural oxide film (NOF) were prepared from the photoactive compounds, namely from 1, 3/2, and 1:3/1:2 dissolved in CH2Cl2. UV-vis spectra of 1, 3/2, and 1:3/1:2 in CH2Cl2 solution (before and after photocurrent density measurements) and on quartz substrate thin films after irradiation with light at 365 nm are similar.

As seen from the Table 1, the jph/IPCE365 nm values for 1:3 and 1:2 obtained for the first time are higher than those for the individual precursors. These characteristics are stable and reproducible over time. So, the photocurrent density increases from 0 to 239.88/242.54 μA cm−2 after the electrode modification by 1:3 and 1:2, respectively. These electrodes have stable and reproducible characteristics over time (for example for 1:3 dyad, jph is 239.88 μA cm−2 and 237.93 μA cm−2 24 and 96 hours later, respectively). These values are higher by factors of ≈1.8–2.4 than that for the individual components of donor–acceptor systems. Similar correlations are also observed for IPCE365 nm values of the dyads. The jph/IPCE365 nm is slightly greater for 1:2 compared with 1:3. The increase of the cell parameters indicates the effect of the photoinduced charge separation between the donor, 1, and the acceptor, 3/2, in coordination dyads. This allows us to consider coordination systems with gold(III) porphyrin acceptors as promising objects in both photovoltaic devices and future photoelectrochemical studies.
Conclusions
Two novel dyads composed of (octakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenoxy)phthalocyaninato)cobalt(II) and (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-4-yl)- or (2,3,7,8,12,18-hexamethyl,13,17-diethyl,5-(pyridin-3-yl)porphinato)gold(III) bonded through the cobalt and pyridyl nitrogen atoms were studied as systems with photoinduced electron transfer. The 1:1 stoichiometry and the coordination nature of these dyads was revealed using chemical thermodynamics/chemical kinetics, UV-vis, IR, 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The bonding constant values is (8.50 ± 1.46) × 105 and (9.66 ± 1.97) × 104 L mol−1 for 1:2 and 1:3, respectively, which suggests the high stability of the coordination complexes (dyads) under consideration.
The dyad molecular geometries, electronic structures shapes of the frontier HOMO and LUMO levels, and electrostatic potential maps were determined using the DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The 1˙+:2˙− radical pair and two ones (1˙+:3˙− and 1˙−:3˙+) was shown to observed using the data of composition of frontier MO. The charge transfer parameters were calculated.
Femtosecond transient absorption measurements have revealed evidence for fast electron transfer from the electron-donating 1 to the electron-accepting 2/3 and allowed to determine of the parameters for it. The position of the pyridyl substituent in the gold(III) porphyrin acceptor molecule not affects the stoichiometry of their coordination complexes with 1 (the dyads). However the substitution site in the acceptor moiety in a dyad with 1 influences on the lifetime of the photoinduced radical ion pair. Really, the comparison of the kCR values indicates not as fast charge recombination process in the AuP based dyads as in the case of 1:ImC60.
The strong absorption in the UV-visible-NIR region, the stable photoelectrochemical characteristics and high charge separation/charge recombination ratio of the coordination complexes between 1 and AuP suggests their potential in the design of donor–acceptor PET systems and in more detailed physical insight of the processes occurring during their photoexcitation.
