    , Accepted 28th August 2017First published on 28th August 2017AbstractAs a new type of promising photovoltaic material, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have attracted particular attention owing to their rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE). It is quite remarkable that within several years PCEs have speedily exceeded the value of 20% from the original 3.8% in 2009. Nevertheless, the existence of heavy metal lead in the prototype perovskite MAPbI3 poses a great threat to human health and the living environment. To explore potential alternatives, we choose the congener elements of Ge and Sn as partial substituents for lead. By virtue of density functional theory calculations, the electronic structures and optical properties of Ge/Sn-doped perovskite compounds have been investigated involving GGA-PBE and DFT-SOC levels. The simulations indicate that the optical absorption coefficient is significantly enhanced due to the use of Ge/Sn dopants. Moreover, it is revealed that the absorption spectra shift towards the near infrared and even the middle infrared, and meanwhile, the band gap can be tuned by means of the Ge/Sn doping. Additionally, optical property analyses imply that the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) plays a positive role for the application of OIHP materials in the photovoltaic field. These results shed a new light on a deep understanding of the nature of a range of functional materials constituted of OIHPs.
1 Introduction
Photovoltaics, as a kind of promising renewable energy, have gradually become a hot research field.1 Among emerging photovoltaic materials, OIHP compounds stand out because of their remarkable performance such as high power conversion efficiency, simple fabrication process and low cost. In the development of OIHPs, an important milestone was when the organolead iodide perovskite MAPbI3 was first fabricated for use as an optical absorption material in solar cells in 2009.2 From then on, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have widely drawn growing attention in both experimental3–11 and theoretical12–18 fields. Within a recent short period, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has quickly improved19 from the initial 3.8%2 up to the most recent 20.2%,8 which has been popularly acknowledged in the field of solar photovoltaic application. All of these experiments prove the fact that OIHPs are promising candidates for optical absorbers which have a higher PCE than most of the current commercial solar cells based on silicon/GaAs/CIGS/CdTe.9 The efficiency of a solar cell is mainly determined by the absorption coefficient in the range of the visible light spectrum,13,14,20–23 the diffusion length of the charge carriers, as well as the velocity of the carrier motion.24–32 As a result, to get a higher PCE, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the structural characteristics of the prototype perovskite MAPbI3. For a typical perovskite structure with formula ABX3, the A site is usually occupied by a monovalent organic cation (sometimes described as a polar organic molecule), which mainly consists of methylammonium (CH3NH3+, denoted as MA) and formamidinium (NH2CHNH2+, denoted as FA). B is a divalent metal ion such as Pb2+, Sn2+, or Ge2+, and X usually denotes a halogen anion such as Cl−, Br−, or I−. To get more explicit insight, we take a MAPbI3 crystal as an example. As shown in Fig. 1, each Pb2+ cation is coordinated by six I− anions to form a PbI6 octahedron, and it is notable that all of the octahedrons are corner-connecting. In other words, these octahedrons are used to construct a so-called three-dimensional inorganic framework,33 and the organic cation MA+ locates at the center of eight PbI6 octahedrons, all of which suggests that each organic cation MA+ interplays with twelve I− anions.34,35 Moreover, the phase structure of an OIHP series strongly depends on the temperature, which has been confirmed by Baikie and co-workers.35 The archetype perovskite MAPbI3 exhibits an orthorhombic phase (space group: Pnma) when the temperature is lower than 161.4 K and a tetragonal phase (space group: I4/m) in the temperature range of 161.4–330.4 K. In addition, the transition from the tetragonal phase to a cubic phase (space group: pm3m) happens at the critical temperature of 330.4 K, above which the perovskite is always maintained in the stable cubic phase. Therefore, it is notable that the symmetry of OIHP compounds is enhanced as the temperature increases. Furthermore, the symmetry is closely related to the rotation of the organic cation MA+ within the inorganic framework, which has also been experimentally indentified.35 As a matter of fact, only the site of MA+ in the orthorhombic phase has been exactly confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction,34,35 which reveals that adjacent C–N bonds are antiparallel. Furthermore, at low temperature this structure can remain stable with negligible change of lattice constants. Therefore, in the present work we focus on the structure and electronic properties of the orthorhombic perovskite MAPbI3.

Besides, the toxicity of the primitive perovskite MAPbI3 can hardly be neglected36,37 because of the existence of heavy metal lead. It is publicly known that lead is widely used in paint and plumbing, and the continuous accumulation of lead can bring serious damage to the environment. As far as human beings are concerned, a low-level exposure of toxic lead is harmful to human organs and tissue-containing heart and muscle. Worse yet, the human body will be injured as the content of lead is gradually increased. The toxicity of lead is thus quite strong, which is a great threat to the survival of mankind over long periods. Consequently, taking into account the ecologically friendly development of the human society, the application of highly toxic lead in perovskite series should be strictly restricted, even to be thoroughly prohibited. Nevertheless, with respect to the state of the art of industrial manufacturing, it is exceedingly difficult to absolutely prohibit the use of lead within a short period. Reducing the use of lead is thus proposed to alleviate environmental pollution. In the meantime, for the purpose of enhancing the optical absorption coefficient in the range of the visible light spectrum, the same family elements of Ge and Sn are chosen as dopants for the organolead iodide perovskite MAPbI3. According to the aforementioned analysis, the structure and electronic properties of the Ge/Sn-doped perovskite compounds are explored in detail by means of first-principles calculations.
2 Computational details
The investigated prototype perovskite is an orthorhombic unit cell consisting of four MAPbI3 primitive cells, and the primitive lattice constants (a = 8.836, b = 12.580, and c = 8.555) are derived from experimental data.35 First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT)38 were carried out by means of the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)39,40 without any symmetry constraints. The projector augmented wave (PAW)41,42 method was used to describe the electron–ion interaction and the GGA-PBE proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)43 under generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was chosen to deal with the exchange–correlation effect of electrons. For the present work, the selected valence-electron configurations are shown as follows, Pb(5d106s26p2), Sn(4d105s25p2), Ge(3d104s24p2), I(5s25p5), C(2s22p2), N(2s22p3), and H(1s1). A plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV is sufficiently accurate for testing, which has been employed in all of the calculations combined with standard pseudopotentials. A gamma-centered mesh with Monkhorst–Pack44 grids was chosen for Brillouin zone sampling, which was used in the calculations of the unit cell relaxation and electronic properties. A conjugate-gradient algorithm was performed to optimize the structure under the convergence criteria of the maximum variation of the total energy, 1 × 10−5 eV per atom, as well as the threshold for Hellmann–Feynman forces, 0.02 eV per Å per atom. In addition, the calculations of the density of states (DOS) were performed by virtue of the tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections.45
So far, many kinds of specific exchange–correlation functional have been developed such as local density approximation (LDA), semi-local generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and non-local van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approaches.46 The vdW interaction47 is usually neglected in the calculations of traditional DFT with GGA or LDA. As a result, the lattice constants are theoretically underestimated by LDA, or overestimated by GGA by at least 8% as reported by Wang and co-workers.48 Obviously, the vdW interaction plays an important role in the perovskite material MAPbI3. As a matter of fact, as long as the non-local vdW correction is considered in the calculations of the MAPbI3 crystal structure, the theoretical lattice constants are in good agreement with the experimental results. In the present work, dispersion weak interactions are characterized by an empirical pairwise correction reported by Grimme in the form of Grimme's DFT-D2.49 What deserves mention here is that DFT-D2 is a better choice for vdW correction compared with the vdW-DF2 and optB88-vdW approaches in terms of the experimental results,16,50–52 which has been confirmed by Sun et al.15 Besides, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is another important issue for OIHP materials, and it has been confirmed that SOC has a great influence on heavy metal elements, especially the Pb-6p orbit.53 Further investigations of the perovskite MAPbI3 confirmed that SOC decreases the bandgap by the reduction and splitting of the conduction band minimum (CBM), which has been reported by Even and co-workers.54,55 Thus, it is necessary to involve the SOC effect for the calculations of the electronic properties of the archetype perovskite MAPbI3. Nevertheless, as far as the perovskite MAPbI3 is concerned, GGA-PBE is sufficiently exact for the calculations of the bandgap, though the agreement has been demonstrated by Even et al. to only be an accidental coincidence.55 Accordingly, to examine the effect of SOC, in this paper we focus on the electronic and optical properties involving GGA-PBE and PBE-SOC levels.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric characterization
To get more insight into the archetype perovskite MAPbI3, the concept of the tolerance factor was initially presented by Goldschmidt et al.56,57 The tolerance factor is usually used to deduce crystal stability as well as the probable structures of perovskite systems, and is given by (1)where R is the ionic radius of the different elements A, B or X. As for a typical perovskite structure with the stoichiometric formula ABX3, the A-site is located in the interstitial space of the octahedron and the B-site lies in the center of the octahedron surrounded by six halogen anions in the top corner of the octahedron. Recent research suggests that the value of the tolerance factor ought to fall between 0.81 and 1.11.58 As a matter of fact, to get a stable perovskite it is necessary that the corresponding radius ratio should be close to 1, namely the size of the A cation must be larger than that of the B cation.59 As far as the electronic structures shown in Fig. 1 and 2 are concerned, the radius of the organic cation MA+ is about 1.8 Å, the radius of the iodine anion I− is 2.2 Å and the radii of the metal cations are RPb2+ = 1.19 Å, RSn2+ = 1.12 Å, and RGe2+ = 0.73 Å. Obviously, the constraint condition of RA > RB is satisfied and the tolerance factors of Pb-based, Sn-based and Ge-based perovskites are 0.834, 0.852, and 0.965, respectively, which is consistent with the relevant conclusions.58 The refinement structure of the single crystal X-ray diffraction35 indicates an obvious distortion of the inorganic framework, which suggests the angular distortion of the Pb–I octahedrons. As seen from Fig. 1, within the Pb–I octahedrons, equatorial I ions almost remain the same as conventional perovskite, while apical I ions are significantly far away from the center of the octahedrons. The conventional perovskite then distorts into the simulated orthorhombic perovskite at less than 161.4 K.

The investigated unit cell contains four MAPbI3 primitive cells, so it is necessary for us to simulate four inequivalent structures for the Ge/Sn dopants. In this perspective, we define the four inequivalent ones as Ge-doped (i), the face-centered lead replaced by Ge at the [001] view, Ge-doped (ii), the body-centered lead replaced by Ge, Ge-doped (iii), the face-centered lead replaced by Ge at the [010] view, and Ge-doped (iv), the corner lead replaced by Ge, which are shown in Fig. 2(a–d). Similarly, the four inequivalent Sn-doped systems are indicated in Fig. 2(e–h). Optimization of the investigated systems has been performed at the GGA-PBE level based on the experimental parameters.35 As seen from Fig. 1, the average Pb–I bond length is 3.18 Å for the prototype perovskite, while a distinct variation of the Pb–I bond length for Ge/Sn-doped systems is shown in Fig. 2. The Ge–I bond length is 2.98/2.99 Å for the Ge-doped systems and the Sn–I bond length is 3.13 Å for the Sn-doped systems, which are in good agreement with the characteristics of the metal ionic radii, RPb2+ > RSn2+ > RGe2+. It is notable that the symmetry of the Ge/Sn–I bond length is due to the primitive orthorhombic phase. Additionally, slight reductions of the volumes of the Ge/Sn-doped systems are also revealed compared to the pure perovskite MAPbI3. As shown in Table 1, the maximum contractions are 3.03% for the Ge-doped systems and 0.59% for the Sn-doped series.

Charge density distributions without SOC in Fig. 3 and with SOC in Fig. 4 reveal that the interaction between the organic cation MA+ and inorganic matrix is predominantly embodied by means of the MA–I ionic bonds, regardless of whether the SOC effect is involved. Moreover, it is indicated that in the MA–I ionic bond it is either the CH3 or NH3 group that interacts with the I anion. Iodine ions within the inorganic framework are evidently divided into two kinds, I1 and I2, due to their different chemical environments, which is in line with the theoretical analysis.48,60 Meanwhile, based on the Bader density analysis without SOC in Table 2 and with SOC in Table 3, it is also demonstrated that charge transfer occurs between the MA cation and iodine anion within the inorganic framework. What deserves mention here is that charge transfer exists either between the CH3 group and I anion or between the NH3 group and I anion, which is decided by the site of the doping elements and has nothing to do with SOC. It is notable that the charge transfer of both MA cations and iodine anions almost remains unchanged, while one of the Pb/Sn/Ge cations changes obviously. All of which is the best demonstration that the SOC effect mainly results from the heavy metal elements.

To further explore the electronic structure, we next analyzed the density of states (DOS) of the pure and Ge/Sn-doped perovskite series. Based on DFT-D2, the DOS of the pure and Ge/Sn-doped compounds were simulated without SOC as shown in Fig. 5 and with SOC as indicated in Fig. 6. As compared to Fig. 5, the DOS of the perovskite compounds in Fig. 6 shows an evident difference arising from the SOC effect of heavy metal lead. As for the pristine perovskite MAPbI3 indicated in Fig. 5(i), the VBM is mainly occupied by the I-5p orbit when SOC is not involved, while the CBM is occupied by the Pb-6p orbit. However, once SOC is involved, as shown in Fig. 6(i), the VBM and the CBM consist of the Pb-6s and I-5s orbit, respectively. With regard to the Ge-doped (Fig. 5(a–d)) and Sn-doped (Fig. 5(e–h)) perovskites, the main occupation of the VBM and CBM is similar to that of the archetype perovskite MAPbI3. In other words, Ge/Sn doping does not evidently change the distribution of the VBM and CBM except for the bandgap. On the other hand, as can be seen from Fig. 6, the DOS is thoroughly changed as long as the SOC effect is concerned. Firstly, for the Ge-doped series, the VBM is mainly occupied by the Pb-6s and Ge-4s orbital electrons as shown in Fig. 6(a–d). Then, for the Sn-doped compounds, the VBM mainly consists of the Pb-6s and Sn-5s orbital electrons as shown in Fig. 6(e–h). The CBM is mainly occupied by the I-5s orbit regardless of whether it is in the pure perovskite, the Ge-doped series, or the Sn-doped ones.
 Fig. 5  The DOS of the pure and Ge/Sn-doped perovskite systems without the SOC effect. The DOS of the Ge-doped and Sn-doped series are labeled as (a–d) in the left panel and (e–h) in the right panel, respectively, where there is one-to-one correspondence between the DOS of the Ge/Sn-doped series and the optimized structures in Fig. 2. (i) The lower panel refers to the pure perovskite MAPbI3. The top of the valence band energies are chosen as the Fermi levels and set to zero. 
 Fig. 6  The DOS of the pure and Ge/Sn-doped perovskite systems involving the SOC effect. The notations in the panel are the same as in Fig. 5. The top of the valence band energies are chosen as the Fermi levels and set to zero. 
The calculated band gaps of the pure and Ge/Sn-doped systems are shown in Table 4. The simulations indicate that the prototype perovskite MAPbI3 in the orthorhombic phase is a direct band gap semiconductor with both the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band located in the same high symmetry point, which has been demonstrated by previous experimental observations.35 In the present study, the band-gap energy of the primitive perovskite MAPbI3 is 1.761 eV without the effect of SOC, which is more consistent with the previous theoretical value48 and experimental value61,62 at low temperature. However, it is often regarded as an accidental coincidence, which has been reported by Even and co-workers.55 Actually, the effect of SOC is indeed significant for the band structure, which is attributed to the existence of heavy metal lead. We emphasize here that we only focus on the band gap variation resulting from the Ge/Sn doping as shown in Table 4. The bandgap energy of the pure perovskite is tuned to 0.801 eV once the effect of SOC is involved, as seen from Table 4. Moreover, in line with the results reported by Even et al.,55 for the Ge/Sn doped series it is implied that the bottom of the conduction band is apparently lowered when the top of the valence band is chosen as the Fermi level and set to zero. In addition to that, it is revealed that the band gap is evidently narrowed due to Ge/Sn substitution doping. By a comprehensive comparison, we find that Ge-doping is a better choice with respect to Sn-doping, which will be illustrated later in the paper.

3.2 Defect formation energy
In order to distinguish which structure is more possible, we next introduce the defect formation energy which can be denoted as63 (2)where Edoped and Epure, respectively, are the total energies of the Sn/Ge-doped and pure MAPbI3 systems. The third term indicates the energy variation resulting from the composition change, where ni denotes the number of doped (ni > 0) or replaced (ni < 0) atoms from a chemical reservoir and μi is the chemical potential of the corresponding atom. In the last term EF is the Fermi energy level which is referenced to the valence band maximum of the pure perovskite system Ev in the bulk, and ΔV denotes the correction to align the reference potential in a series of Sn/Ge-doped compounds with the pure system. We here consider a series of perovskite compounds in the neutral state,64 so the value of q can be set to zero. Considering the growth and annealing conditions in the experimental fabrication, the defect formation energy must be dominated by the chemical potential of the host atoms reflected by the corresponding environment. To ensure the existence of the perovskite MAPbI3, MAPbI3 must be in equilibrium with reservoirs of the MA molecule, lead and iodine atoms. In other words, in the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potentials of the component elements in MAPbI3 should satisfy the following relation: μMA + μPb + 3μI = μMAPbI3.(3)Meanwhile, the chemical potentials of the Pb atom should be constrained by the following conditions, μminPb = E(MAnPbnI3n) − E(MAnPbn−1I3n),(4)μmaxPb = μPb(bulk),where E(MAnPbnI3n) represents the total energy of the prototype perovskite MAPbI3 consisting of n primitive cells, while E(MAnPbn−1I3n) indicates the same system with the Pb vacancy. Moreover, the energy of bulk Pb is usually set to the reference zero, so it is not difficult to get a result of ΔμminPb ≤ ΔμPb ≤ 0 (ΔμPb = μPb − μPb(bulk)). By virtue of first-principles calculations, we derive the defect formation energy of the Ge/Sn-doping perovskite systems. It is noteworthy that the minimum formation energies of the Ge/Sn-doping compounds are negative in Fig. 7, which means that all of the Ge/Sn-doped series are favorable to fabricate light absorbers for photovoltaic devices. Moreover, the variations of the defect formation energies of both the Sn-doped and Ge-doped perovskite systems are smaller than 3.46%, which implies that four inequivalent compounds are possibly synthesized in the practical growth of the Ge/Sn-doped series.

3.3 Optical properties
The optical properties are dominated by the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function which is given by17,65 (5)where the parameter Nk indicates the total number of k-points in the Brillouin zone sampling, Ω denotes the volume of the investigated unit cell, η is an opportune broadening factor,  is the velocity operator, and the vectors of |ϕrelkc〉 and |ϕrelkv〉 denote the unoccupied and occupied state wave function at k-points in the reciprocal space, respectively. Additionally, the real part can be deduced by the imaginary part with regard to the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), which is in accordance with the famous Kramer–Krong relationship:66,67 (6)where P denotes the principle value of the integral. The frequency-dependent absorption coefficient I(ω)17,68 can be derived from the real part ε1(ω) and imaginary part ε2(ω) of the complex dielectric function, which is shown in the following form (7)Accordingly, the absorption spectra of the Ge/Sn-doped perovskite compounds without SOC are shown in Fig. 8(a and b), and those with SOC are illustrated in Fig. 8(c and d). The absorption coefficient of the pure perovskite MAPbI3 reaches the highest value of 1 × 10−5 in the range of the visible light spectrum, which is quite similar to the results reported by Feng et al.14 The absorption spectra in Fig. 8(a and b) suggest that the absorption ability is significantly enhanced in the range of the visible light spectrum spanning 380 to 780 nm. Moreover, the absorption efficient is more significantly enhanced not only in the range of visible light but also in the range of near infrared and even middle infrared as shown in Fig. 8(c and d). Additionally, the proportion of visible light plus the infrared spectrum is almost 93% of the whole solar energy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the absorption ability is stronger in the Ge/Sn-doped perovskite compounds than in the pure perovskite MAPbI3. Meanwhile, it is also revealed that the Ge-doped series have a greater advantage than Sn-doped compounds in terms of light absorption in the range of visible light and infrared.

(a and b) refer to the perovskite systems without SOC, whereas (c and d) involve the SOC effect under the same conditions.

4 Conclusion
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been performed towards the cell relaxation and electronic properties of pure MAPbI3 as well as Ge/Sn-doped compounds at a low-temperature orthorhombic phase. Four inequivalent structures of displacement-doping perovskites have been explored. The simulated results reveal that the optical performance can be remarkably improved by virtue of substitution of Pb with Ge or Sn. Nevertheless, searching for Pb-free perovskites is still an open issue. In the present work, Pb concentration is mitigated owing to partial replacement of Pb with Ge/Sn, though all of these remain far away from the Pb-free criterion. Further analyses show that the structures of the Ge/Sn-doped series are more stable compared to the prototype perovskite MAPbI3. Meanwhile, band-gaps shift towards near-IR and even mid-IR owing to the substituent doping of Ge and Sn in MAPbI3. Moreover, we find that, whether SOC is involved or not, the absorption coefficient in the range of visible light is remarkably enhanced as expected. Finally, one point particularly worth emphasizing is that the photovoltaic performance is strikingly improved not only within the range of visible light but also in the range of near infrared and even middle infrared. In this perspective, the effect of SOC is beneficial for the use of OIHP materials as light absorbers in the field of photovoltaic applications. Our study confirms that the significant red-shift can be realized by virtue of substitution doping of Ge and Sn, which is helpful to understand in depth the intrinsic characteristics of new-generation photovoltaic materials.
