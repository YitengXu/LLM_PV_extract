As evidenced by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) results, the PbI2 phase is found to be inevitably formed at the very initial growth stage, even under the conditions of a MAI-rich environment. The extremely low binding energy of adsorbed MAI particles on all the above substrates, as compared to that of PbI2 particles, is responsible for the presence of the PbI2 phase at the interface. The formation of both hole and electron barriers at the interface of PbI2/MAPbI3, as evidenced by XPS measurements, could block carrier transport into the electrode and thus deteriorate solar cell performance.

Introduction
In optoelectronics devices, the interface chemistry and the electronic structure play a critically important role in charge separation, collection and recombination. The existence of the interfacial layer can play a positive or negative role in carrier transport. As in the interface of CuInGaSe/Mo, the MoSe2 interlayer is normally formed due to Se diffusion and reaction with the Mo substrate during annealing.1–4 The growth orientation and thickness of the MoSe2 are proven to be dependent on the Cu/Ga/In composition ratio and the underneath barrier layer.3,4 The existence of the MoSe2 interfacial layer is beneficial for hole transport to the back electrode. For the CdTe or CdZnTe films prepared by vapor-based deposition methods, the unexpected Te aggregation during the initial growth stage is widely studied which may deteriorate the device performance.5,6
Organometal halide perovskites have recently become the most competitive candidates for application in optoelectronics devices like solar cell, light emitting devices and detectors due to their excellent absorption and transport properties and simple processing technique.7,8 For the interface study, most efforts are devoted to interface engineering by modifying the interface layer using PCBM, C60, MgO etc., in order to improve the charge extraction or to decrease the charge recombination at the interface.9–12 The recent studies also pay attention to the interface chemistry of PbCl2 and MAI to elucidate the Cl-doping effect.13 However, interface chemistry and evolution during MAPbI3 film growth is rarely studied experimentally in detail, especially for the perovskite film prepared using the vacuum-based evaporation method.
In general, the annealing process is needed for the growth of MAPbI3 films using solution-based methods, e.g. one-step spin-coating method and sequential deposition, so that the interface chemistry and evolution cannot be controlled precisely. On the other hand, the growth of MAPbI3 films by vacuum deposition methods is nearly an instantaneous process. No additional operations are needed after deposition,14 so that the interface chemistry can be studied systematically. Moreover, the vacuum-based methods can stop film growth at any time and therefore we can study phase evolution during film growth. A systematic study of interface chemistry for vacuum-based perovskite films could provide us an insight into interfacial carrier transport and may help us to identify the reason for the lower device performance of the evaporated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as compared to solution cells.14–17
In this work, the evolution of interface chemistry of MAPbI3 films prepared by dual-source evaporation is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). We gave direct evidence for the presence of the PbI2 phase at the interface, which is inevitably formed at the very initial growth stage of MAPbI3 films, even under the conditions of a MAI-rich environment. The origin of the existence of the PbI2 interfacial layer is due to the extremely small binding energy of MAI relative to PbI2 on all substrates adopted. The valence and conduction band alignments between PbI2 and MAPbI3 are estimated to be both 0.41 eV and 0.45 eV, indicating the formation of both hole and electron barriers at the interface, which may be the most important factor for the normally observed low conversion efficiency of PSCs prepared using the evaporation method.
Experimental section
Perovskite film deposition
The vacuum system used to prepare perovskite films by dual-source thermal evaporation is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The load-lock chamber and the evaporation chamber were separated by a high vacuum valve. The substrates can be transferred between these two chambers by using a mechanical hand in a vacuum. In the evaporation chamber, two ceramic crucibles were used to place the MAI and PbI2 (Sigma, No. 203602, 99.999%) sources for evaporation. Two source shutters were mounted just above the crucibles to control the MAI and PbI2 flux. Three quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors were set right beside the substrate, above the MAI source and above the PbI2 source to monitor the deposition rate of MAPbI3, PbI2 and MAI. A full-range pressure gauge was mounted to monitor the pressure inside the chamber.
As suggested by Malinkiewicz et al.,15 Qi et al.16 and Polander et al.,18 to obtain the accurate deposition rate of MAI, the deposition rate of MAI can be quantified by the partial pressure of MAI. In order to find out the optimal perovskite deposition conditions, several batches of perovskite films with a thickness of 150 nm were prepared with varying MAI partial pressure (0.8 × 10−5–1.4 × 10−5 Torr) and a fixed PbI2 rate (0.4 Å s−1). The XRD results then show that the perovskite films with an accurate stoichiometric ratio were obtained at a MAI partial pressure of 1.2 × 10−5 Torr (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Under the optimal growth conditions, perovskite films with different thickness (5, 10, 20, 50, and 150 nm) were deposited on ITO, pedot/ITO, Si and glass substrates, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The typical surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films deposited on ITO substrates with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Before evaporation, the cleaned substrates were stored in the load-lock chamber to avoid MAI exposure. The evaporation chamber was evacuated by a pumping system to a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 Torr and then the MAI and PbI2 crucibles were heated up. Only when the optimal perovskite deposition conditions were achieved, the substrate was transferred from the load-lock to the evaporation chamber. During the growth, the MAI shutter was kept closed at all times to provide a stable MAI partial pressure. After the expected thickness of perovskite films was achieved, the samples were immediately transferred from the deposition chamber to the load-lock chamber.
Perovskite film characterization
After deposition, the samples were taken out of the load-lock chamber into a N2-filled glovebox. A part of the samples were then measured by XRD immediately within 10 min. A part of samples to be used for XPS and SEM measurements were protected in a home-made N2-filled box for the least exposure to air to ensure that the samples are not deteriorated before taking the measurements. Actually, samples with a thickness of 5 nm were measured by XRD with time, and the XRD results remained unchanged for around three hours. The morphology of the perovskite films was inspected using an SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F). The crystalline structure of the films was evaluated using an XRD (Rigaku D MAX-3C, Cu-Kα, λ = 1.54050 Å). XPS analyses were performed using a PHI-Quantera SXM TM surface analysis system equipped with a monochromatic Al-Ka X-ray gun. The XPS core level spectra of Pb 4f, I 3d and N 1s are fitted according to a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape along with a Shirley background.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD spectra of MAPbI3 films with thicknesses ranging from 5 nm to 150 nm grown under the optimal growth conditions with the PbI2 evaporation rate of 0.4 Å s−1 and a MAI partial pressure of 1.2 × 10−5 Torr. The growth parameters are optimized for 150 nm thick MAPbI3 films on ITO substrates, where no secondary phase like PbI2, MAI and MAI-rich MAxPbI3 were observed.14,17 Despite the fact that the pure phase was obtained for thick MAPbI3 films, at the initial deposition stage, there exists a small amount of the hexagonal 2H polytype PbI2 phase, evidenced by the XRD peak at 12.70°.

(b) Integrated intensities (blue line) and FWHMs (red line) of the peak of PbI2(001) plane, the doublet peak of MAPbI3(110) and (002) planes and the peak of ITO(222) plane as a function of film thickness. 
In order to quantitatively understand the phase evolution of MAPbI3 films during growth, the integrated intensities of the peak of PbI2 (001) plane (12.70°), the doublet peak of MAPbI3 (110) and (002) planes (14.10°) and the peak of ITO (222) plane (30.54°) as a function of film thickness are plotted in Fig. 1(b). The films grown on ITO do not greatly influence the intensity of XRD signals of the films for the penetrating length of Cu Kα X-ray (>10 μm) is much longer than the film thickness. So the ITO XRD peak at 30.54° can be used as an internal mark to estimate the relative intensity of XRD peaks of other phases in the films grown with various thicknesses.
The PbI2 phase (Fig. 1(b)) can be observed clearly in the as-deposited films at the initial growth stage (thickness less than 50 nm). Upon increasing the film thickness, the intensity of the PbI2 peak decreases, and finally disappears for thick MAPbI3 films (thickness more than 50 nm). This fact indicates the interfacial PbI2 can be gradually converted to the MAPbI3 phase during growth, likely due to the diffusion of MAI vertically from the upper layer into the interface. This case is very similar to the growth of CdTe or CdZnTe films prepared by vapor-based deposition methods, where the unexpected Te aggregation at the initial growth stage can be reduced during the further film growth.5,6 The same behavior also holds true for pedot/ITO, Si and glass substrates, as evidenced by XRD results shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). This indicates that the formation of the PbI2 phase at the initial growth and the reduction of the PbI2 phase during growth are universal phenomena for perovskite films prepared using dual-source evaporation. In addition, as for films on pedot/ITO, Si and glass substrates, the intensity of PbI2 does not disappear finally even from the same growth batch as on the ITO substrates under the optimum conditions, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Moreover, for a 260 nm-thick MAPbI3 film on the FTO/TiO2/PCBM substrate, the presence of the PbI2 phase can still be identified, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). These results mean that the interfacial PbI2 layer is difficult to be completely eliminated from most substrates only through self-diffusion of MAI from the upper layer. Even for the ITO substrate, due to the XRD detection limitation, the presence of a PbI2 layer at the interface for thick films cannot be excluded completely. Besides, the result also indicates that the optimum conditions work only for the MAPbI3 film grown on the ITO substrates, indicating a substrate-dependent film growth of MAPbI3 film which is worth further study but is out of scope of this work.
To further study the evolution of film composition during film growth, XPS was used to detect the chemical states of Pb, I and N atoms in MAPbI3 films with various thicknesses. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra of Pb 4f and I 3d5/2 core level. As the chemical states of Pb and I atoms in PbI2 and MAPbI3 are similar, it is hard to distinguish whether the Pb and I signals are from either the PbI2 phase or the MAPbI3 phase.19 However, the I/Pb atomic ratio is different for PbI2 and MAPbI3 and thus it may give us an indication of the presence of PbI2 at the interface. The composition ratio of I/Pb can be calculated by the following formula, (1)where Ci, Ii and Si (i = I, Pb) are the atomic concentrations, integrated XPS signal intensities and sensitivity factors, respectively.

(c) The atomic ratio of I/Pb of the perovskite films with different thicknesses deposited on ITO substrates calculated by XRS and EDS. (d) High resolution XPS core level spectra of N 1s of the perovskite films with different thicknesses deposited on ITO substrates. 

Fig. 2(c) shows the plot of the calculated I/Pb ratios versus the film thickness. All I/Pb ratios are all lower than the stoichiometric value of 3 for MAPbI3, suggesting a deficiency of I atoms in MAPbI3 film. This result is frequently observed in both solution-based and evaporated MAPbI3 films.19–21 It is interesting to find that the I/Pb ratio is particularly low, and close to 2, which is the stoichiometric value of PbI2. The result indicates the preferable growth of the PbI2 phase at the initial growth, which is consistent with the XRD results. To further study the location of the PbI2 phase in the films, the XPS measurements with a small take-off angle were conducted for a 10 nm-thick MAPbI3 film. As illustrated in the Fig. S7 (ESI†), by using a small take-off angle in XPS measurements, more information from the very surface can be obtained, compared to XPS measurements with a normal take-off angle. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), a higher I/Pb ratio of 2.6 from a 30° take-off angle measurement than that of 2.4 in a normal take-off angle measurement is obtained for a 10 nm-thick sample, which evidences that the PbI2 is present at the interface. With the growth proceeding, the I/Pb ratio gradually increases to nearly 3, due to the formation of MAPbI3. The EDS results show the same trend as the XPS results (Fig. 2(c)).
The concentration of the MA group can be estimated by the intensity of the N 1s core level spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The N/Pb ratio can be calculated by an equation similar to eqn (1). The N/Pb ratio for the 150 nm MAPbI3 film is around 0.95, which is similar to the values for the solution-based MAPbI3 films.19 So, all the above results about Pb/I and N/Pb ratios show the as-deposited film featured with MA and I deficiencies, implying that an n-type semiconductor is obtained. Notably, a very small N 1s signal can be detected for the films with a thickness of 5 nm, although the above XRD results give a clear indication of the formation of the MAPbI3 phase. The absence of the N 1s signal suggests a considerably low ratio of the MAPbI3/PbI2 phase for the initial film. So, the PbI2 phase is not only present at the interface, but also is the major phase for the films of thickness below 10 nm.
To further understand the PbI2 interfacial layer formation during the initial growth, we examined the XRD pattern and the surface morphology of perovskite films deposited with different MAI/PbI2 evaporation rate ratios (Fig. 3). As evidenced by the XRD results in Fig. 3(a), for a slightly higher MAI/PbI2 ratio (MAI partial pressure: 1.3 × 10−5 Torr), which finally leads to a MAI-rich MAPbI3 films, the existence of the PbI2 phase at the initial stage was still observed. The film thicknesses of pure MAI film and PbI2 film obtained from QCM, are about 7 nm and 150 nm, respectively, which were grown under the above optimal growth conditions for one hour. The huge growth rate difference indicates that the binding energy of the PbI2 particle on the ITO substrate is much higher than that of the MAI particle on ITO substrates. So, the PbI2 interfacial layer is much easier to nucleate and grows on substrates. In contrast, once the surface is covered by PbI2, MAI could react with PbI2 to form MAPbI3 and thus the binding energy of MAI increased significantly. Consistently, the MAI deposition rate detected by the QCM dramatically increases from 0.02 Å s−1 to 0.6 Å s−1 after a PbI2 layer is deposited on a clean QCM plate. In addition, the growth of MAI and PbI2 films exhibits a completely different wetting property. For the growth of MAI film, only a small portion of the substrate surface, as shown in Fig. 3(b), is covered by the sparse island grains, while the PbI2 film with a thickness of 5 nm shows a perfect wetting property on the ITO substrate as shown in Fig. 3(e). Therefore, it is concluded that the PbI2 interfacial layer in the perovskite film prepared by the vacuum-based method is likely inevitably present at the initial growth no matter how much MAI is used.

In order to investigate the effect of interfacial PbI2 phase on carrier transport, the valence band spectra was studied by using XPS measurements, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The valence spectra of a typical 20 nm PbI2 on an ITO substrate is also given for comparison. For all the valence band spectra, a narrow band located at a deep energy of −10 eV comes from the Pb 6s lone pair.22 The valence band spectra in the range of 1.5–8 eV are characterized by the peak at 3.7 eV coming from I 5p nonbonding state, and the right shoulder coming from the anti-bonding hybrid state of Pb 6s and I 5p.22,23 Since both PbI2 and MAPbI3 phases have a similar Pb–I bonding, we cannot distinguish the characteristic difference between PbI2 and MAPbI3 valence band spectra. However, it can be seen obviously that the valence band edge shifts from 1.91 eV to 1.40 eV with the film thickness increasing. Especially, for the film with a thickness of 150 nm, the valence band edge of 1.40 eV means an as-prepared n-type MAPbI3 film, resulting from MA and I vacancies in films.22 This n-type nature induced by MA and I vacancies is often observed in MAPbI3 films no matter what kind of growth method is adopted.21,22,24,25

(b) Energy shift of I 3d5/2, Pb 4f7/2 and the valence band edge as a function of film thickness. (c) Energy level diagram of the valence and conduction band edges of PbI2 and MAPbI3. 
For semiconductors, the energy difference between the valence band edge and the Fermi energy is generally lower than the bandgap. However, in our results, it is shown that this energy difference in the valence band edge of the films with a thickness lower than 10 nm approaches 1.91 eV, which is much larger than the bandgap of MAPbI3 (1.55 eV). This may indicate that the energy band of MAPbI3 film bends downward to the interface, making electrons accumulate at the interface (note also that the valence band edge is determined by the phase with a lower band gap for the mixed phases, i.e. by the MAPbI3 phase rather than the PbI2 phase in this case). The whole band bending for thick MAPbI3 films can be found to be 0.51 eV, which is caused by the MAPbI3 depletion layer,26 as confirmed by the simultaneous shift of Pb 4f and I 3d peaks with the valence band edge shown in Fig. 4(b). So, the energy diagram of the MAPbI3 layer including band bending can then be drawn schematically as shown in Fig. 4(c).
Furthermore, according to valence band edges of the PbI2 film and a 5 nm-thick MAPbI3 film, the energy level alignments of the valence and conduction band edges without consideration of interface dipole can be estimated to be around 0.41 eV and 0.45 eV for the PbI2/MAPbI3 interface,19 with the consideration of the bandgaps of PbI2 (2.41 eV) and MAPbI3 (1.55 eV) from optical absorption spectra. It is noticed that the exact band alignment including the interface dipole effect, measured by XPS results, cannot be obtained due to the absence of two different elements each from the PbI2 and MAPbI3 interface. This type I band alignment of the PbI2/MAPbI3 interface is consistent with the literature reports,27–29 but is different from the results of either the electron or hole barrier at the interface.19,30–33 Until now, most reported band alignments have been hypothesized,27,30,33 or estimated without consideration of both the interface dipole and the band bending effect.28,30,31 Here, we found that a large band bending exists in the MAPbI3 film and therefore a very thin film rather than a thick film should be used to measure the band alignments using this simplified method, leading to a more accurate result. The band alignments in Fig. 4(c) show both electron and hole barriers at the interface, which may severely limit both carrier transport into the electrode and increase the recombination probability as well. In order to study the effect of the interfacial PbI2 phase at the interface on device performance, PSCs with a deliberately grown PbI2 buffer layer are fabricated. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the results give direct and solid evidence that the PbI2 at the interface is harmful to device performance. Additionally, as listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the most reported power conversion efficiency of PSCs made by vacuum deposition, is around 7–13%, considerably lower than the most reported values of 15–20% for solution-based and hybrid sequential devices. Here, we have revealed the origin of the poor performance of PSCs by the vacuum evaporation method that both the electrons and holes transport into the electrode are blocked by the interfacial PbI2 layer inevitably formed at the initial growth stage. Furthermore, this result also suggests that the complete elimination of the PbI2 interlayer may benefit both electron and hole transport at the interface for both direct and inverted structures, and thus improve the device performance.
Conclusions
The evolution of interface chemistry of evaporated MAPbI3 films was studied by XPS and XRD results. We found that the PbI2 phase is formed inevitably at the very initial growth stage of MAPbI3 films, even under the conditions of a MAI-rich environment. The extremely low binding energy of physically adsorbed MAI on all substrates facilitates the preferential growth of the PbI2 interfacial layer. The PbI2 interfacial layer can be reduced partly during film growth by its reaction to MAPbI3 with MAI diffused vertically from the upper layer into the interface. The natural valence and conduction band edge alignments for the PbI2/MAPbI3 interface are estimated to be both 0.41 eV and 0.45 eV. This indicates the formation of both hole and electron barriers at the interface, which could severely limit both electron and hole carrier transport into the electrode and increase the recombination probability, and thus deteriorate PSCs performance. This result reveals the origin of the poor performance of PSCs by the vacuum evaporation method, and may help to improve the performance of PSCs made by the vacuum evaporation method.
