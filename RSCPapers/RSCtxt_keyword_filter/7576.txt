    , Accepted 9th March 2012First published on 9th March 2012AbstractThree alkoxy-wrapped push–pull porphyrins were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. Spectral, electrochemical, photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy properties of these porphyrin sensitizers were well investigated to provide evidence for the molecular design.
Porphyrins are promising candidates as highly efficient sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) because of their superior light-harvesting ability in the visible region.1–3 Recent advances on the development of a porphyrin sensitizer (YD2-ooo-C8) with co-sensitization of an organic dye (Y123) using a cobalt-based electrolyte attained a power conversion efficiency of 12.3%,4 which is superior to those developed based on Ru complexes5 and becomes a new milestone in this area. The key structural feature on molecular design of a highly efficient porphyrin sensitizer is to bear with long alkoxyl chains in the ortho-positions of the meso-phenyls so as to effectively envelope the porphyrin ring to reduce the degree of dye aggregation for a higher electron injection yield and to form a blocking layer for a better charge collection yield.6 In the present study, we further design three porphyrin sensitizers (YD20–YD22, Chart 1) based on the structure of YD2-ooo-C8 but with extended π-conjugation in order to enhance the light-harvesting ability. Basically all of them have the same ortho-substituted porphyrin core with two phenylethynyl (PE) groups acting as a π-bridge in the meso-position of the ring. YD20 and YD22 dyes have the acceptor group (ethynylbenzoic acid) the same as that of YD2-ooo-C8 but with different donor groups: YD20 has a triphenylamino group with two methoxyl substitutes and YD22 has a phenylamino group with two n-butyl chains. On the other hand, YD20 and YD21 dyes have the same donor group but the cyanoacrylic acid was used as an anchoring group in YD21. This approach mimics the molecular design of an organic dye7 having the acrylonitrile group with strong electron-pulling power to act as an efficient acceptor for the porphyrin dye.

The details for the syntheses, optical and electrochemical characterizations of YD20–YD22 are given in ESI.‡ These porphyrin dyes were fabricated into DSSC devices for photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations. Fig. 1a and b show the J–V curves and the corresponding Incident Photon to Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) action spectra for the YD20–YD22 devices, respectively; the obtained photovoltaic parameters and the amounts of dye-loading are summarized in Table 1. The results indicate that the short-circuit current densities (JSC) exhibit a trend YD20 > YD22 > YD21 and the open-circuit voltages (VOC) display a trend YD20 > YD22 ∼ YD21; the overall power conversion efficiencies (η) show the same order as JSC, which is consistent with the variations of the IPCE action spectra showing the same order. As a result, YD20 has the highest JSC (17.43 mA cm−2) and VOC (676 mV), which yields the greatest η (8.1%) among the three porphyrins under investigation. Even though the cyanoacrylic substitute makes YD21 a slight red shift in the absorption spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI‡), the floppy feature of the CC double bond might tilt the molecules adsorbed on TiO2 film to significantly decrease its IPCE values and the corresponding current density. However, YD20 and YD22 have the same anchoring group and very similar absorption spectra (Fig. S1, ESI‡), therefore, the differences in IPCE and photocurrent are related to the effect of the donor groups. Note that the decrease in the IPCE occurs at a nearly constant level for all the wavelengths of the spectra for YD21 compared to YD20. Thus, the loss of electrons is independent of the energy of the absorbed photons. Transport and injection losses may be considered for the decrease in IPCE, which is discussed in the following.

Dye loading measurements yielded 161, 132, and 134 nmol cm−2 for YD20, YD21 and YD22, respectively. The changes in JSC between the dyes with the same anchoring group, YD20 and YD22, may be understood in terms of the different amounts of loaded sensitizer. Further explanation is needed for sample YD21 as the decrease in JSC is larger despite the amount of dye loading in the cell is the same as for YD22.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was used to complete the analysis of injection and to gain insight into the transport and charge losses characteristics of the DSSC with the different dyes.8 From the fitting of impedance spectra of the DSSC at different applied potentials under 1 sun illumination, we obtained the chemical capacitance (Cμ), transport resistance in the TiO2 (Rtr), recombination resistance (Rrec), as a function of the Fermi level voltage (VF) shown in Fig. 2a, b, and c, respectively. Other contributions to the total resistance of the cell such as diffusion, counter electrode and FTO resistances were grouped as series resistance (Rs). The effect of Rs in the applied potential (Vapp) was removed to obtain the VF that may be calculated through VF = Vapp − jRs. From the plot of Cμvs. −VF shown in Fig. 2a, the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2 (Ec) may be estimated as reported elsewhere.9 Through these calculations, we estimated that for YD20Ec ≈ −0.48 V vs. NHE, while for YD21Ec was displaced +4 mV and YD22 −10 mV. Data from transport resistance shown in Fig. 2b also provide very small displacements in Ec, corroborating that all the TiO2 conduction bands remain almost unchanged for the three dyes as obtained from the capacitance data.

To understand the origin of the small differences in the VOC found for the three different dyes it is needed to analyze the behavior of the recombination resistance in Fig. 2c. In previous studies,8,10 when comparing the recombination resistance of different samples it has been found that the higher the value of Rrec, the larger the VOC, while only very large changes in photocurrent produce small variations in VOC. The results here match very well with this analysis: as it can be seen in Fig. 2c, YD20 has the larger recombination resistance and VOC, whereas YD21 and YD22 have similar values of Rrec showing almost the same VOC.
Data from Rrec and Rtr may be used to calculate the diffusion length (Ln) in TiO2 film shown in Fig. 2d as8 (1)where L is the film thickness (15 μm) represented as a dashed curve in Fig. 2d. The Ln values exhibit a systematic trend with the order YD20 > YD22 > YD21 with those of YD20 and YD22 reaching values greater than their film thickness whereas those of YD21 being significantly smaller than the film thickness. This implies that the YD21 device suffers from a poorer collection efficiency of injected electrons what produces the extra decrease in JSC found for this sample.
The small differences found for the position of the conduction band edge (Ec) may also help to fine tune the roles of the linker in these Zn–porphyrin dyes. If the Fermi level potential is shifted the amounts found for the displacement of Ec, it is possible to compare the recombination resistance of the DSSC at the potential level with the same number of injected electrons. To do this we define the potential at the equivalent conduction band position8 Vecb = VF − ΔEc/e(2)where e is the electron charge and ΔEc = Ec − Ec,ref, for which Ec,ref is the position of the conduction band of YD20. Based on these conditions, we transfer Fig. 2a–c into Fig. 3a–c, which show Cμ (a), Rtr (b), and Rrec (c) as a function of −Vecb. While the chemical capacitance (Fig. 3a) and the transport resistance (Fig. 3b) of the three dyes match quite well, the recombination resistance (Fig. 3c) of the YD21 device is much smaller compared to that of the YD20 and YD22 devices. In other words, charge recombination is a major problem for the poor performance of the YD21 device. These results allow us to make a conclusion: compared to the YD20 device, the smaller VOC of YD22 was due to a small shift in conduction band but the smaller VOC of YD21 was due to a significant charge recombination. From the structural viewpoint, the use of cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor and an anchoring group in YD21 might provide more free space (less amount of dye-loading) for the charge recombination than the use of the rigid ethynylbenzoic acid in YD20 and YD22. Moreover, YD21 might be tilted on the surface of TiO2 for the charge recombination to occur more easily.

In conclusion, although the concept for molecular design with the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor has been widely applied in highly efficient organic dyes,7 such an approach does not work well for the porphyrin sensitizers as demonstrated herein. The greater performance in the YD20 device than the other two devices is attributed to its rigid structural feature for a larger amount of dye-loading, which combined with the higher recombination resistance and diffusion length yields to larger JSC and VOC. Modification of the porphyrin structure with extended π-conjugation for better light harvesting is feasible to boost up the device performance in the near future.
