    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 19th November 2021AbstractHalide perovskites have attracted attention because of their potential in the fields of light-emitting diodes, lasers and detectors. Herein, a series of quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite films have been synthesized and the physical behavior behind their optoelectronic properties, which is dependent on the layer number (n), has been discussed in detail. The temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) test indicates that the perovskite film with n = 7 has outstanding PL characteristics, owing to its long radiative lifetime at different temperatures. Temperature-dependent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) has been employed for the first time to scan the ASE threshold of our films, showing that the ASE threshold decreases from 29.91 μJ cm−2 (3D perovskite film) to 19.23 μJ cm−2 (n = 3). The current–voltage test with strong light bias takes the lead in pointing out that the detector based on the 3D perovskite film (n = ∝) exhibits excellent opto-current properties in comparison with other quasi-2D perovskite films. Our results provide a comprehensive insight into the optoelectronic properties of these quasi-2D perovskite films.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention as next-generation semiconducting materials for optoelectronic devices,1,2 owing to their favourable optical and electrical characteristics, such as strong light-harvesting, fast carrier migration, apparent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), wide wavelength tunability, and high colour purity.3–6 On the one hand, they can create a large number of photogenerated carriers after photoexcitation and can thus be used for high-performance photovoltaics. To date, we have witnessed rapid advances in the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells, from 4% in 20097 to 25.5% in 2020,8 approaching that of their crystalline silicon counterparts. On the other hand, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (PLQY) and optical gain in perovskite films reveal their potential in the field of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can be easily tuned across the entire visible spectrum via halogen substitution.6,9–12 Since the first demonstration of perovskite LEDs in 2014,13 the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) has risen rapidly from 0.1% to over 20%.14,15 Furthermore, these materials are also considered a new class of excellent optical gain media for lasers.10 Although the reported thresholds of ASE in perovskite films are very promising, many challenges still restrict their application in the field of electrically pumped lasers.16 For example, the poor thermal stability of perovskite films is one of the major challenges. In particular, thermal stability may impose technical limits for the realization of electrically driven lasers, since the heating caused by the large current injection may cause the degradation of perovskite materials.10,17 Cation partial substitution by introducing long organic chains to form quasi-2D perovskites is an effective strategy to improve the thermal and environmental stability of perovskites.18,19 In addition, owing to their special “multi-quantum-well” structure, quasi-2D perovskite films are given the appealing characteristic of enhanced exciton confinement,20 which allows them to be employed in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs.21 To date, the EQE of LEDs based on quasi-2D perovskites has exceeded 20%.22 Additionally, ASE behaviour in quasi-2D perovskites has been demonstrated, which exhibits huge potential in laser application.23 Moreover, quasi-2D films can also be fabricated into sensitive photodetectors24 due to their highly anisotropic structure that integrates both intra-well charge conductive channels and resistive hopping barriers in orthogonal orientations.
Although the quasi-2D perovskite films exhibit excellent characteristics in optoelectronics as mentioned above, an in-depth analysis of quasi-2D perovskite films with an emphasis on the optoelectronic properties correlating with the fundamental photophysical processes is still lacking. For example, the radiative lifetime closely related to the PLQY is often ignored, which restricts the analysis of the relationship between the structure of quasi-2D perovskite film and PLQY, and hinders the fabrication of LEDs with high performance.21 The ASE property, which is sensitive to the crystal vibration, has been confirmed in the quasi-2D perovskite films; however, research on the temperature-dependent ASE property is quite limited, which hinders the determination of the mechanism by which ASE is affected by the crystal structure. The analysis of the ASE mechanism can help in the development of high-performance lasers.23 Moreover, the quasi-2D perovskite films have been successfully fabricated into LEDs or photodetectors, but the relationship between the carrier diffusion and recombination behaviour behind the photocurrent property and their structure remains unclear. If this relationship were clearly understood, optoelectronic devices could be designed and manufactured with reasonable structures.24 Previous studies have confirmed that the quasi-2D perovskite films are excellent optoelectronic semiconductor materials, but the physical mechanism behind the optoelectronic behaviour needs to be further explored.
Herein, we report that a series of quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite films with various layer numbers (n) has been prepared by changing the proportion of phenylbutylammonium (PBA). The longitudinal optical phonon energy (ELO) and exciton binding energy (Eb) affected by the layer number can significantly influence the PL mechanism of these perovskite films, which can be proved by analysing the evolution of radiative lifetimes. The threshold of ASE varies from 29.91 μJ cm−2 (3D perovskite film) to 19.23 μJ cm−2 (n = 3). The photo-current behaviour of perovskite film has been probed based on a microscale photodetector with lithography electrodes, suggesting that 3D perovskite film (n = ∝) has the best photo-current characteristics in comparison with other quasi-2D perovskite films. These results present a facile approach for the selection of suitable materials for optoelectronic devices in the future.
Results and discussion
We have synthesized 2D (PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4) films based on the anti-solvent method (as seen in Scheme S1, ESI†) and the layer number (n) corresponds to 2 (#1), 3 (#2), 7 (#3), while #4 and #5 are the thick and thin 3D MAPbBr3 films, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the 2D (PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4) and 3D (MAPbBr3) perovskite films are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†), where the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the lattice planes of the cubic structure measured at 295 K. As n increased from 2 to 7, the diffraction peaks were almost invariable, suggesting that the crystal structures of perovskite films show negligible changes in the 2D plane. The new diffraction peaks located at 33.73° (0 2 1) and 37.38° (2 1 1) appeared in the 3D perovskite films, which were assigned to the effective arrangement of the perovskite unit cells in the longitudinal direction. The XRD data confirmed that the dimensions of the perovskite films gradually evolved from 2D to 3D with the increase in n. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†), showing the compact and uniform perovskite films on the substrates. The elemental mapping images show the element distribution of Pb (blue) and Br (green), further indicating the uniform distribution of perovskite materials. The excellent surface coverage and continuous distribution of perovskite films significantly improve carrier transport.25 Moreover, the optical scattering effect of samples can be negligible during the spectroscopy test, owing to the smooth and flat surfaces. Ellipsometric spectra (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†) were employed, which offered many useful physical parameters as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The uniform films can effectively confine the light within perovskite films when they are regarded as the gain or laser medium of micro- or nano-lasers.
The UV–vis absorption and PL spectra of our samples measured at room temperature are given in Fig. 1A and their optical images illuminated by the 365 nm lamp are also displayed as insets. There is an excitonic peak in the absorption spectra, which is located at 429 nm (n = 2), 465 nm (n = 3), and 495 nm (n = 7), respectively, and is marked with red arrows. In the absorption spectra of quasi-2D perovskite film, a clear band can be observed well below the excitonic peak, which may be assigned to the contribution of the multi-phase structure of polycrystalline thin films with different n26 or the resonance absorption of “edge states” in the quasi-2D perovskite films.27 The absorption spectra of our samples is so simple that no excess excitonic peak appeared like in the previous report.28 Meanwhile, the band edge and excitonic peak together were red-shifted with the increasing of n, suggesting that the longitudinal quantum confinement (LQC) effect occurs in these quasi-2D perovskite films, but the LQC effect was gradually weakened with n. This suggests that our samples have a high phase purity and the contribution of the multi-phase structure can be excluded. Therefore, the resonance absorption of “edge states” should be responsible for the clear band structure of the absorption spectra. As seen in Fig. 1B, the PL peak gradually red-shifted with n. The PL spectra of these perovskite films were all asymmetric due to a very small tail in the low-energy region, which may be assigned to the PL originating from the carrier capture by shallow defects below the conduction band.20 This influence could play a small role in the inhomogeneous broadening of PL signals, but cannot affect the measurement of the PL signal and the calculation of the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of PL, which is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† FWHM gradually decreased from 0.16 to 0.10 eV, as n increased. This tendency and the PL characteristics as mentioned above are consistent with the previous report.27 Note that the absorption edge and the PL peak of the MAPbBr3 thin film are nearly the same as those of the MAPbBr3 thick film, suggesting that the LQC effect almost disappears in the 3D MAPbBr3 film. According to the XRD, the steady absorption and PL data, the quantum wells (QW) can be formed in the perovskite films and the n of perovskite films can cause the variance of the LQC effect. Stoumpos et al. proved that the layer number of perovskite film can be controlled by adjusting the ratio between the spacer cations and small organic cations of 2D (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ∝) perovskites.20 It was determined that the bandgap can be regulated by controlling the layer number of 2D perovskites.29 The PLQYs of our samples are summarized in Fig. 1C, which increases from 15 to 33% with n. This suggests that the shallow surface defects of quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 films decrease with the increase in n, which restricts the non-radiative channel close to the defect. In #4, the PLQY is only stabilized at 26% and is lower than that of #3, which may be assigned to the appearance of deep defects in the bulk 3D MAPbBr3 films. This phenomenon suggests that the PL behaviour can be affected by n. A similar phenomenon has already been observed in previous research,21 suggesting that the tendency of PLQY in our experiment is reasonable.

For an in-depth analysis of the photo-induced optical characteristics of our perovskite films, the temperature-dependent PL map of #4 is given in Fig. 2A, showing that the PL peak was redshifted with decreasing temperature. All perovskite films with different n followed a similar tendency, as seen in Fig. S4–S7 (ESI†). Due to the thermal expansion effect of the lattice, the lattice may shrink as the temperature decreases, which can enhance the interaction between the electron orbits of the Pb atoms and the Br atoms,30 simultaneously causing the narrowing of the band gap. In this situation, the PL is red-shifted as the temperature decreases. The integrated PL intensity (IPLI) and FWHM of the PL spectra are plotted in Fig. S8 (ESI†), which are all consistent with the previous report.31 Based on the Arrhenius equation and the Bose–Einstein statistics (as shown in Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†), the exciton binding energy (Eb) and longitudinal optical phonon energy (ELO) of our perovskite films are summarized in Fig. 2B. The former increases from 53.6 to 113 meV, as n decreases from ∝ to 2.32 Firstly, the n of the perovskite film can influence the Eb due to the limited longitudinal space, which may restrict the exciton dissociation. Secondly, quasi-2D perovskites have multiple-QWs, in which the semiconducting inorganic layers and the insulating organic layers act as potential “wells” and potential “barriers”, respectively. The dielectric constant of the middle inorganic layer (ε1) is bigger than that of the neighbouring layer (ε2). In this situation, the dielectric confinement influenced by the image-charge effect can appear, causing the Eb to decrease with the increase in n, by affecting the average dielectric constant of films.26 Therefore, Eb is sensitive to n and the average dielectric constant of these perovskite films. We also found that the evolution of Eb as a function of n follows the scaling law33 (as shown in Fig. S5, ESI†) and the fitting results are given in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The calculation results show that the factor γ, which is used to indicate the degree of deviation from the pure quantum confinement regime, is equal to 1.53, implying that the exciton wave-function can be compressed in comparison to the pure quantum confinement effect. This proves the rationality of the Eb calculated by the Arrhenius equation. After photoexcitation, the exciton may rapidly dissociate and generate the photogenerated carriers in the film due to the small Eb. The carrier can then diffuse or recombine in the perovskite films, which participates in the radiative and non-radiative channels. Herein, ELO is 15.0 meV for #4, which is consistent with previous research.30 In addition, ELO can increase to 49.3 meV, as n decreases to 2 (Fig. 2B), which is closer to the phonon energy of an organic cation rather than Pb–Br bond-related phonon.28 This is assigned to the contribution of collective lattice vibrations. The phonon modes of 2D hybrid perovskites possess the characteristics of both organic and inorganic framework structures. Covalent bonds in organic cations are significantly harder and stronger, which have a greater force constant than ionic bonds in inorganic frameworks. This is beneficial for improving the phonon energy. With n decreasing, the proportion of organic cations increased gradually, leading to the ELO increase.26

In order to discuss the PL mechanism of PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 film, the excitation intensity-dependent PL spectra test was conducted and is given in Fig. S10 (ESI†), which can be fitted based on the function of IPLI = CPEIα. Herein IPLI is the PL integrated intensity, PEI is the excitation intensity, C is the constant, and α is an exponent between 0 and 2.34 The fitted results show that α is 1.00 (#4) and 0.99 (#3), suggesting that the PL signals in #3 and #4 were both enhanced linearly with the excitation intensity, in which the excitation intensity-dependent carrier loss did not appear in #3 and #4. In #1 and #2, α is less than 1 (0.83 for #1 and 0.86 for #2, respectively). This suggests that the loss originated from the carrier–carrier interaction at high excitation intensity easily occurs in the PL process of #1 and #2. Considering the strong LQC effect and the large Eb of #1 and #2, this carrier–carrier interaction may easily occur due to the influence of limited space, and the corresponding loss at high excitation intensity is reasonable.
For further insights into the PL mechanism of our perovskite films, their PL relaxation behaviours were probed by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) at different temperatures (Fig. S11, ESI†), which showed a near mono-exponential decay behaviour, suggesting that the carrier recombination may be complex. The carrier recombination mechanism in perovskites can be divided into three kinds:35 monomolecular recombination, bimolecular recombination, and Auger recombination. At very low fluence, monomolecular charge-carrier recombination related to traps dominates, which is a process involving one “particle”. Bimolecular charge-carrier recombination between electrons and holes in a direct semiconductor can be regarded as intrinsic photon-radiative recombination that is directly related to the reverse process of light absorption. Auger recombination of charge carriers is a many-body process involving the recombination of an electron with a hole, accompanied by energy and momentum transfer to an extra electron or hole. In our experiment, the excitation intensity in TCSPC is too low to induce the Auger recombination process. Therefore, bimolecular and monomolecular recombination may happen during the PL process.36 Considering that the calculation of radiative lifetime is beneficial to the understanding of the PL process,37 the radiative channels of these perovskite films have been systemically analysed.
Herein, we use the recorded PL transients along with the measured PLQY (Q) for deriving the radiative lifetime.37 The PL decay can be described by the following: (1)
In this situation, the radiative lifetime τrad = Q−1τX (detailed steps are described in Fig. S4 of ESI†), where τX is the average PL lifetime, which accounts for both radiative and non-radiative processes in recombination dynamics. The PL curve of #4 at room temperature is fitted with a bi-exponential function as seen in Fig. 2C and the fitting parameters are displayed in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Based on the average PL lifetime and the PLQY measured by the integrating sphere (26%), the radiative lifetime of MAPbBr3 perovskite film was calculated and its dynamic behaviour (green solid line) is also shown in Fig. 2C (calculation details shown in Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that its lifetime is 56 ns. Based on the temperature-dependent steady absorption and PL data (Fig. S4–S7, ESI†), the PLQY of #1, #2, #3 and #4 at different temperatures can be calculated according to the PLQY at room temperature and are summarized in Fig. 2D. The PLQY of perovskite films shows an approximately linear increase with lowering the temperature but the difference in PLQY among these perovskite films seems to be enhanced with decreasing temperature. The enhancement of the amplitude in #3 is the most apparent among these perovskite films, which changes from 33% at 295 K to 96% at 77 K. This phenomenon indicates that the thermal activation of trap states results in the non-radiative recombination channel increasing and makes the PLQY decrease at high temperatures.38,39 Based on the PL dynamics and the PLQY at different temperatures, the evolution of radiative lifetimes (τrad) at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 2E, indicating that the τrad of quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite films and 3D MAPbBr3 films decreases with decreasing temperature. Note that the radiative and non-radiative channels together determine the PLQY of perovskite film. Herein, the radiative lifetime cannot monotonically change with Eb, owing to the influence of PLQY. This suggests that the non-radiative process is always at a disadvantage in the competition with the radiative process for these PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 film. The enhancement of the radiative recombination channel contributes to the improvement of PLQY. Typically, the radiative decay can be influenced by the energy of the emitting transition (Eem), which can be interpreted by the bandgap energy (Eg) in semiconductors. With the decreasing of n, the Eg gradually increases, and the band split structure gradually becomes apparent, causing a decrease in the radiative lifetime. The dielectric screening also affects the radiative lifetime. The proportion of organic ligands can affect the dielectric confinement of materials.37 The decreasing of n can cause the proportion of organic ligands to decrease, which will reduce the radiative lifetime and increase the dielectric confinement.
To further explore the optical characteristics of our perovskite films, the excitation intensity-dependent PL spectra were probed in detail, in which a 130 fs pulse strip laser with a repetition rate of 1 kHz was used to excite the perovskite films. Here, the laser excitation wavelength was 400 nm. Fig. 3a offers the pump fluence-dependent PL spectra of #4 (the detailed data collection process is given in the Experimental section). It is interesting that its PL spectra gradually transformed into a narrow peak with the increase in the pump fluence, which should be assigned to the ASE phenomenon.40 The pump-fluence-dependent PL intensity and PL FWHM of #4 at 295 K are summarized in Fig. 3b and both show a knee point located at 29.91 μJ cm−2. In addition, the FWHM of the ASE signal is narrower in comparison with that of the PL signal. By comparing the FWHM of PL and that of ASE, the narrowing ratio between them was calculated, which was 0.43 at 295 K. Our samples have relatively high refractive indexes for the visible spectra, leading to high reflectance at the perovskite–air interface. In this case, the perovskite film can be regarded as a resonant cavity. The spontaneous emissions couple with perovskite films, and propagate along the waveguide mode within the perovskite films.41 The film shows different refractive indexes for different wavelengths of light. Therefore, the perovskite film can also function as a frequency selector, which causes the narrowing of ASE as compared to PL.42,43 Similar phenomena have been reported previously. For example, Kondo et al. reported that the ASE phenomenon appears in the CsPbCl3 thin film, whose threshold was estimated to be 44 kW cm−2 under 77 K.44 Xing et al. obtained the wide ASE wavelength tunability (390–790 nm) of quartz/CH3NH3PbX3/PCBM film by mixing halogen elements in different proportions.10 Predictably, these perovskite films may show electrically driven lasing considering the balanced ambipolar charge transport characteristics.

(b) The emission intensity and FWHM of the MAPbBr3 perovskite film plotted as a function of pump intensity at 295 K. Thresholds (c) and narrowing ratios (d) of #2, #3 and #4 as a function of temperature. 
As the whole perovskite films are pumped above the threshold, population inversion occurs and the propagating waves can be amplified by the stimulated emission. According to the aforementioned results, the PL intensity and PLQY will be enhanced with decreasing temperature, which is beneficial for lowering the ASE threshold at the same time. Therefore, we recorded the pump intensity-dependent emission spectra at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. S13–S15 (ESI†). For #1, no significant ASE phenomenon was observed as the temperature decreased from 295 K to 77 K. Fig. 3b shows the pump intensity-dependent emission intensity of #4, which presents clear threshold behaviour with a steep rise in intensity above the threshold. Recently, Weng et al. reported a threshold of 108 mJ cm−2 under 400 nm excitation.43 By optimizing the MAPbBr3 film preparation technology, our ASE threshold greatly decreased. For instance, the threshold significantly decreased from 29.91 μJ cm−2 for 295 K to 21.53 μJ cm−2 for 77 K. A similar phenomenon was found by Qin et al. who attributed the non-monotonic lowering of the threshold for ASE to temperature-dependent phase transition occurring in the vacuum annealed MAPbI3 perovskite films.45
The ASE threshold is complicated, which is determined by several factors involving the Auger recombination, the film structure and the Eb.28 In general, the ASE has to happen at high pump fluence. In this situation, the population of photo-generated carriers increases sharply under a higher pump fluence, in which a large number of carriers participate in multi-body interactions,28 such as bimolecular recombination and Auger recombination; the remaining carriers can contribute to the ASE process. For #1, its special film structure has a very strong LQC effect, which enhances the Auger recombination46 at high fluences. The large Eb in #1 may affect the exciton dissociation, which easily causes multi-exciton interactions after photoexcitation. Therefore, the carrier loss of #1 at high pump fluence should be stronger than that of other perovskite films, leading to the ASE signal not appearing in #1. As n exceeded 2, the LQC effect was weakened, slowing down the Auger recombination process.47 The decreasing of Eb also facilitated the exciton dissociation and the carrier diffusion. Finally, the ASE signal could easily appear in other quasi-2D perovskite films. A similar phenomenon has also been found in the previous literature. Liang et al. reported that the temperature-dependent laser emission was realized for perovskites with n = 3, n = 4, n = 5. For n ≤ 2, the laser emission was unattainable even at 78 K.48 Cui et al. reported that the reason for no ASE feature in the n = 1 or n = 2 thin films was inefficient energy transfer due to the lack of large-n QWs acting as acceptors.49 In brief, the morphology and crystal quality of perovskite films affected by n, which is close to the Auger recombination, the film structure and the Eb as mentioned above, could vary owing to the different preparation methods and finally lead to different light confinement and laser behaviours.
The temperature-dependent ASE thresholds of #2, #3 and #4 are summarized in Fig. 3c. The thresholds go up almost linearly with the temperature, originating from the quenching by thermal effect.50 The temperature decrease causes the ASE process to gradually gain a competitive advantage with Auger recombination.28 The Auger recombination is suppressed at low temperatures due to the reduction of the thermal vibrations, thus resulting in a lower proportion.28 This is consistent with the fact that laser emission is easily generated at low temperatures.48 Their competition finally determines the threshold of ASE. The contribution of Auger recombination is reduced by decreasing the temperature or adjusting the domain distribution of quasi-2D perovskite films.28 It is obvious that #2 had the lowest threshold under the same temperature all along, about 10 μJ cm−2 at 77 K, and showed a higher radiative rate that can be described as γ = 1/τrad; the introduction of more cationic groups made it easier to generate resonant micro-cavities. The two combined factors made the #2 threshold smaller. The narrowing ratio of our samples is summarized in Fig. 3d, showing that the narrowing ratio increases linearly with decreasing temperature. For all samples, the PL narrowing is still stronger than ASE narrowing with the temperature decrease. The lower threshold of ASE under optical pumping makes electrical pumping possible, which greatly expands the potential application of nano-lasers, such as on-chip integrated coherent light sources. Note that the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite has poor thermal conductivity (0.25–0.5 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature).17,51 The substrates in our samples are the same conventional glass substrates, therefore, the thermal conductivity of substrates cannot be responsible for the difference in the ASE threshold among these perovskite films. Thus, the influence of thermal conductivity can be ignored in our experiment.
Our perovskite films have excellent optical characteristics after photo-excitation. #3 showed the highest PLQY, but #2 had the lowest threshold and the narrowest ratio of the ASE signal. To clearly understand the optoelectronic characteristics, a model device was designed. As seen in Fig. 4a, lithography electrodes with 12 μm intervals were acquired by focusing a femtosecond laser on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. A simple photodetector can be fabricated by spin-coating the perovskite films on this type of electrode, in which the narrower electrode spacing makes a better dynamic photoresponse (as shown in Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c and d display transient responses with four on–off illumination cycles under different voltages and pump intensities, respectively. The photocurrent gradually increased with the bias (from 4 V to 10 V) and the pump intensity (from 28.7 mW cm−2 to 910 mW cm−2), eventually reaching 18 μA under 10 V and 910 mW cm−2 with a highest on/off ratio of 200. The photocurrent can be rapidly generated and the repeatable dynamic response patterns could be observed during dozens of cycles. This detector exhibited excellent performance, suggesting that it can be used to measure the electronic properties of perovskite films with different n.

Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the 2D and 3D perovskite photodetectors as mentioned above, in which the pump fluence increased from 0.091 to 910 mW cm−2 at room temperature. The linear I–V relationship indicates an ohmic contact at the perovskite/ITO interface;52 this is beneficial for the efficient collection of charge carriers. The population of photogenerated carriers is directly determined by the illumination flux, resulting in the photocurrent increase with the photon flux. The photo flux-dependent photocurrent of the perovskite film at 4 V is summarized in Fig. 5b. The photocurrents of quasi-2D perovskite films (#1, #2 and #3) are rather low as compared to 3D perovskite film (#4), which may be attributed to three reasons. Firstly, the quasi-2D layer-structured perovskites have a large Eb and strong LQC effect, which restrict the generation and diffusion of carriers. Secondly, the insulating PBA layers can act as barriers for charge transportation, which limits the charge carrier mobility through the image-charge effect.26 Thirdly, the defects and the boundaries can affect the carrier migration by influencing the monomolecular recombination process.53 Their contribution may weaken with n; i.e., the carriers can easily migrate in the perovskite film with high n. As for #3 and #4, the photocurrent in the double logarithmic coordinate system increased almost linearly with photon flux, suggesting that the photogenerated carriers can easily migrate in the perovskite films. The loss originating from the carrier–carrier interaction cannot happen in #3 and #4. In #1 and #2, the situation becomes more complicated. Significantly, the evolution of photocurrent with photo flux exhibits two stages and the knee point is located at 7.1 × 1016 numbers s−1 cm−2 (#1) and 2.3 × 1017 numbers s−1 cm−2 (#2), respectively. This suggests that a new carrier recombination mechanism appears in the high photo flux region, causing the loss of photogenerated carriers. This is attributed to the carrier–carrier interactions since this loss of carrier easily occurs in #1 and #2 due to their strong LQC effect and large dielectric confinement, which facilitate the collision of carriers. In this situation, these factors easily induce the loss originating from carrier–carrier interactions in #1 and #2, in comparison with that in #3 and #4. Moreover, this knee point in #2 is higher than that of #1, which further corroborates the role of n. This result is consistent with the previous excitation intensity-dependent PL test.

The responsivity, which is an important parameter for the photodetector performance, can be defined as the ratio of the photocurrent to the incident light intensity, for indicating how efficiently the detector responds to an optical signal.53 It is expressed as follows: (2)where W and L are the channel width and length, and Ee is light intensity. The Iph = Ilight–Idark, where Ilight and Idark are the currents through the device channel when the light is on and off, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5c, #4 exhibits higher responsivity than other quasi-2D perovskites, and the responsivity increases gradually with the decreasing of optical density, up to the maximum value of 0.076 A W−1 at 0.09 mW cm−2, superior to the single-crystal MAPbBr3 (9.03 mA W−1) and MAPbCl3 (6.8 mA W−1).54 Since the loss originating from the carrier–carrier interaction can affect the photocurrents in #1 and #2, the responsivity in these perovskite films also exhibits two stages and the corresponding knee point is consistent with those in Fig. 5b.
Conclusions
We fabricated a series of quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite films with different n. Based on the multi-spectroscopy and optoelectronic tests, the physical behaviours behind their PL, ASE and photogenerated carrier recombination were studied in detail, confirming that these photophysical characteristics are sensitive to film structure, which is dependent on n. The analysis of radiative lifetime has taken the lead in the discussion of the physical mechanism behind the PL. It was found that the perovskite film with n = 7 has outstanding photoluminescence characteristics among these perovskite films, implying that the quasi-2D PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 (n = 7) perovskite film has huge potential in the LED field. The ASE test at different temperatures was employed to scan the ASE threshold of the PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite film for the first time. As n decreased to 3, the perovskite film had the lowest threshold of ASE, which decreased to 10 μJ cm−2 at 77 K. This promising ASE property reveals the potential to fabricate lasing devices in the future. Based on applying the current–voltage test with a strong light bias, the carrier recombination behaviour behind the photo-current has been successfully discussed. As n → ∝, the 3D MAPbBr3 perovskite film exhibits excellent opto-current properties, suggesting that the photo-generated carriers can freely diffuse in the films in comparison with other quasi-2D films. Therefore, its photocurrent performance is the highest among these perovskite films. Our results provide comprehensive insight into the optoelectronic properties of these perovskite films, suggesting the importance of the layer number, to ensure that the quasi-2D perovskite films meet the needs of different optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis
Anti-solvent treatment is one simple and effective way to prepare high-quality perovskite films. Herein, we selected anisole as an antisolvent, which can wash off the residual N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). For MAPbBr3 perovskite, MABr (1.0 mmol) and PbBr2 (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in DMF (1 mL). For PBA2(MAPbBr3)n−1PbBr4 perovskite, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving phenylbutylammonium bromide (PBABr), MABr and PbBr2 in DMF in a certain molar ratio. Then, the perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solutions for 80 μL at 3000 rpm, followed by dropping the antisolvent. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The steps to prepare PBABr were as follows: PBA (18.89 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (20 mL), and hydrobromic acid (22.66 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution at 0 °C over 2 h with stirring. The solution was then heated at 50 °C to the appearance of white powder, and washed three times with diethyl ether. Finally, the PBABr was vacuum-dried at 30 °C for 24 h.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an R-AXIS RAPIDII single-crystal X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired at an accelerating voltage of 5 to 20 kV using a Hitachi SU8030 instrument equipped with an Oxford X-max 80 SDD EDS detector. Steady-state absorption measurements were carried out with a UV–Vis absorption spectrometer (Purkinje, TU-1810PC). The ellipsometric spectra in the photon energy range of 1–5 eV were recorded by a HORIBA Jobin Yvon UVISEL spectroscopic ellipsometry system with a 70° angle of incidence in ambient atmosphere.
Optical absorption, PL, and TCSPC experiments
A halogen light source (Ocean Optics, HL-2000) and 405 nm line of a UV laser with tunable output power were used as the light source of optical absorption spectra and PL spectra, respectively. The temperature was controlled by an Optistat DN-V temperature controller (Oxford instruments). The fluorescence dynamics were detected by a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a high-resolution picosecond diode laser (Becker & Hickl Gmbh) as the excitation source (λexc = 405 nm, 20 MHz repetition rate).
ASE measurement
The laser pulse with 130 fs pulse strip and repetition rate of 1 kHz was generated from a laser system (Coherent). The beam was then focused in a rectangular stripe by the cylindrical mirror to excite the sample film. The ASE spectra were collected in the lateral direction.
