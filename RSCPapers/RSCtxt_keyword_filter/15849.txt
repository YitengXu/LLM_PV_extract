    , Accepted 14th November 2015First published on 16th November 2015AbstractThe key challenges in boosting the power conversion efficiency (η) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are efficiently achieving charge separation at the photoanode and enhancing the charge transfer, which is limited by the interface between the polysulfide electrolyte and the counter-electrode (CE). We designed and fabricated new catalytic electrodes by combining a PbS nanoparticle catalyst with NiS nanoparticles by a facile chemical bath deposition method and optimizing the reaction conditions. These were used as CEs for polysulfide redox reactions in CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs. The PbS nano-morphologies were tuned from nanoparticles to nanospheres by controlling the PbS deposition time on the NiS surface. As the deposition time is increased, the surface morphology, the ratio of Ni:Pb:S, and the thickness of NiS and PbS are affected. The increase in the amount of PbS deposited on the NiS surface could improve the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface. The optimized NiS/PbS composite CE shows a charge transfer resistance (Rct) as low as 10.06 Ω, which is an order of magnitude lower than those of bare NiS (39.65 Ω), PbS (42.12 Ω) and Pt (99.71 Ω) CEs. Therefore, the NiS/PbS composite CEs show much higher catalytic activity for the polysulfide electrolyte than NiS, PbS and Pt CEs. As a result, the QDSSC using this newly synthesized NiS/PbS as a CE achieves a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.52% than the one applying NiS (3.26%) or PbS (3.06%) or Pt (1.29%) CEs. There was no degradation of the efficiency over 10 h under room conditions. This enhancement is mainly attributed to the improved electrocatalytic activity and improved absorption of NiS/PbS, which resulted in the absorption of residual long-wavelength solar irradiation by the PbS CE. This irradiation may have excited the PbS and facilitated the injection of electrons from the conduction band into the polysulfide electrolyte, leading to higher Voc, Jsc, and FF. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements revealed that the composite CEs had better electrocatalytic activity, which improved the rate of polysulfide reduction compared to bare NiS and Pt CEs.
1. Introduction
The rapid increase in the industrial development and global population in recent decades and the corresponding energy increase need to be addressed productively using non-renewable energy sources. To date, over 80% of energy consumed is generated from fossil fuels, which is a serious concern for global-warming issues. More importantly, fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources and will eventually be exhausted in the near future. In this context, photovoltaic devices (solar cells)1–3 that convert sun light into electrical energy possess cost-effective, reliable and safe attributes and present as some of the promising renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.4,5 Among photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been regarded as the most promising candidates for efficient light-to-energy conversion owing to their low cost, simple fabrication, and environmentally benign advantages compared to silicon-based solar cells.5–8 In addition to DSSCs, much effort has been made to develop new sensitizers such as porphyrin dyes or narrow-band-gap quantum-dots (QDs) semiconductors to improve the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs.9,10 In recent years, semiconductor QDs have been extremely appealing building blocks for optoelectronic applications. In particular, using QDs is a promising approach for low-cost third-generation solar cells owing to their tunability of the band gap,11 high absorption coefficient,12 and multiple exciton generation possibilities.13,14
Various QD sensitizers such as CdS,15,16 CdSe,17 PbS,18 PbSe,19 CuInS2,10 CdTe,20 and Sb2S321 have been widely studied for QDSSCs. A typical QDSSC consists of a TiO2 nanocrystalline film sensitized with QD molecules, a redox electrolyte containing the polysulfide redox couple, and a counter-electrode (CE) that mainly collects electrons from an external circuit and catalyzes the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte at the CE/electrolyte interface. The efficiency of QDSSCs is lower than that of DSSCs, which could be attributed to a fast charge recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface and high charge-transfer resistance on the CE surface.22,23 To increase the efficiency of QDSSCs, novel electrocatalytic materials for use in CEs are necessary.
Usually, the CEs of DSSCs are fabricated by loading platinum (Pt) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. Conductive glass loaded with Pt has high conductivity, outstanding electrocatalytic activity, and good chemical stability, allowing the charge at the electrode/electrolyte interface to move quickly and efficiently in the presence of an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte. The I−/I3− electrolyte used in DSSCs is not suitable for QDSSCs because it causes photocorrosion of the QDs.24 Polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) is more suitable and preferred for QDSSCs to minimize photocorrosion.25 As a noble metal, Pt is also expensive and not very catalytic in conjunction with polysulfide electrolyte because sulfur-containing compounds (S2− or thiol) adsorb preferentially and strongly at Pt surfaces. This reduces the conductivity and surface activity of the electrodes.26 Researchers must find a facile and cost-effective alternative to Pt CEs with maximum electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance (RCE) at the interface of CE/electrolyte. There have been several alternatives to Pt CEs to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and charge separation. The CE plays a major role in collecting the electrons from an external circuit and reducing the Sn2− ions to S2−.27
To overcome the limitations of conventional CEs, alternative electrocatalytic materials have been reported for the reduction of Sn2− species, such as NiS, CoS, CuS, Cu2S, PbS, MoS2, and Cu2ZnSnS4.28–35 Among these metal sulfides, Cu2S has superior photovoltaic performance and higher electrocatalytic activity in reducing polysulfide species. However, these Cu2S CEs suffer from continual corrosion when used in conjunction with the polysulfide redox couple, decreasing the photoelectric properties of the device.27,36 Furthermore, copper ions are harmful for human health, and Cu is not very abundant. NiS is abundant and shows superior photovoltaic performance compared to a CoS CE.29 A PbS CE shows similar electrocatalytic activity to CuS and CoS CEs but with long-term stability.26
To increase the efficiency of QDSSCs, it is necessary to search for high-performance and novel electrocatalytic composite CE materials rather than a single CE material. Chang et al. reported a CuS/CoS composite CE for CdS/CdSe QDSSCs with 4.1% efficiency.37 Song et al. used the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method and deposited PbS nanoparticle catalysts onto ZnO nanorods to form core/shell nanorod structures with 3.06% efficiency.38 Arabzade et al. demonstrated CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized cells and sequentially deposited CuS/PbS CEs with a cell performance of 3.58%.39 Some metal composite electrodes (Cu2S/graphene oxide, PbS/carbon black) have been developed with higher cell performance than the individual materials.27,33,40
Although these studies demonstrated a considerable improvement in the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs, it is still hard to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs due to various influencing factors of the cell performance. Some issues are still unsolved, including the large internal resistance, high overpotential for polysulfide reduction at the CE, and improved stability in some cases. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously research facile preparation methods and low-cost CEs with high catalytic activity and satisfactory stability.
A previous study reported that the NiS CE shows superior catalytic activity than that of a CoS CE with improved stability.29 It is reported that the PbS CE showed a catalytic activity similar to that of CoS and Cu2S but with an inferior long-term stability.26 Also, the probability of transfer of electrons from the redox level of the electrolyte to the CE is reduced when PbS is used in the CE.41 In this respect, we have developed a new composite structure using NiS and PbS, which were fabricated by a facile low-temperature chemical route and applied as an efficient CE for a QDSSC. Therefore, we first prepare the NiS CE on a conducting FTO substrate using chemical bath deposition (CBD), which exhibits good catalytic activity toward the polysulfide electrolyte. Furthermore, by introducing different deposition times of PbS catalysts using the CBD method into the NiS electrode to afford the NiS/PbS composite electrodes, better conductivity and lower charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface have been achieved. The NiS/PbS composite electrode shows outstanding electrocatalytic activity and unsurpassed stability in the polysulfide electrolyte. An improved power conversion efficiency of 4.52% has been obtained for CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs using the optimized NiS/PbS composite CEs. To the best of our knowledge, this promising NiS/PbS electrocatalyst has not been used in polysulfide electrolyte previously.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), urea (CH4N2O), acetic acid (C2H4O2), lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), potassium chloride (KCl), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP) were supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were commercially available and of analytical grade.
Preparation of NiS, NiS/PbS and Pt CEs:
Nanostructured NiS thin films were deposited on FTO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω cm−2 (Hartford Glass) by CBD using aqueous solutions of NiSO4·6H2O and C2H5NS as nickel and sulfur sources, respectively. Prior to deposition, FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and distilled (DI) water for 10 min each. To fabricate the NiS electrodes, the cleaned FTO substrate was placed vertically in a solution containing cationic and anionic precursors of 0.1 M NiSO4·6H2O and 0.4 M C2H5NS, which act as sources of Ni2+ and S2−, respectively. 0.8 M CH4N2O and 0.6 M C2H4O2 were used as reagents. Urea increases the rate of thioacetamide decomposition and thereby increases the concentration of S2− ions. The substrate growth solution was kept in a hot air oven at 95 °C for 90 min. After 90 min of deposition, the NiS-coated glasses were cleaned with DI water and ethanol. The resulting products were denoted NiS or NiS/PbS0.
The as-prepared NiS CEs were used to prepare NiS/PbS composite CEs. In 25 mL of DI water, 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2 and 0.4 M C2H5NS were dissolved and vigorously stirred for 30 min. Under constant stirring, 0.01 M C3H7NO2S was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. The as-prepared NiS substrates were immersed in the growth solution vertically and placed in a hot air oven. The deposition was carried out at different growth times of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min at 90 °C. After the completion of each deposition time (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min), the samples were removed from the oven and cleaned with DI water and ethanol. The NiS/PbS films obtained at different growth times of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min were labeled NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS3, NiS/PbS4, and NiS/PbS5, respectively.
To fabricate the Pt electrode, the well-cleaned FTO glass substrate was coated with a Pt paste (Pt-catalyst T/SP, Solaronix) using the doctor blade method and sintered at 450 °C in air for 10 min.
Preparation of TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode
FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and DI water and used for the fabrication of a photoanode. Porous TiO2 films were coated on FTO using TiO2 paste with a particle size of 20 nm (Ti-nanoxide HT/TP, Solaronix) by the doctor blade method with an active area of 0.27 cm2 and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, producing a thickness of 7.5 μm after solvent evaporation. The SILAR process was used to deposit the CdS and CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2.
In brief, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto TiO2 and then rinsed with DI water and ethanol for 1 min. Then, the electrodes were dipped into an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form the desired CdS. The electrodes were then rinsed with DI water and ethanol for 1 min and dried with a drier. This procedure comprises one CdS SILAR cycle and was repeated five times to achieve a suitable CdS loading on the TiO2 electrode. The CdSe layer was sequentially deposited on the as-prepared TiO2/CdS. For CdSe deposition, the TiO2/CdS film was dipped into aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and Na2SeSO3 alternately for eight successive cycles of SILAR with a dipping time of 5 min each. Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution was prepared by refluxing Se (0.2 M) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.4 M) at 120 °C for 4 h. For the ZnS passivation layer, aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S were used for two SILAR cycles with a dipping time of 1 min each. The as-prepared samples are called TiO/CdS/CdSe/ZnS.
The photoanodes and the fabricated NiS and NiS/PbS electrodes were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The space between the electrodes was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in methanol and water at a ratio of 7:3. The cells were left for a few hours for complete diffusion of the electrolyte within the photoanode and then tested under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.
Fabrication of symmetric cells for Tafel polarization and EIS measurements
Symmetrical NiS, NiS/PbS, and Pt electrodes were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The internal space of the cells was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte. Tafel polarization with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) for the symmetrical dummy cells with NiS-NiS, NiS/PbS-NiS/PbS, and Pt–Pt CEs under dark conditions in a frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 ADVANCE with a DAVINCI diffractometer (Bruker AXS) using Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The surface morphology, thickness, and elemental compositions of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) operated at 15 kV. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation of 1486.6 eV and an electron take-off angle of 90°. The surface roughness of the substrates prepared using CBD (NiS and NiS/PbS) was characterized by atomic force microscopy (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BioLogic electrochemical analyzer. Pt served as a CE, and Ag/Ag+ served as a reference electrode. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of QDSSCs were examined under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the QDSSCs using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination at frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz. The applied bias voltage and the AC amplitude were set to Voc of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized by Nyquist and Bode plots. To perform the stability test, QDSSCs based on NiS, NiS/PbS, and Pt CEs were continuously irradiated with AM 1.5G radiation at 100 mW cm−2 under working conditions, and the J–V curves were tested every hour for 10 h.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of PbS for a deposition time of 30 min on the surface of NiS (NiS/PbS3). The NiS/PbS composite film has diffraction peaks of NiS at 32.2° and 35.7° assigned to the [3 0 0] and [0 2 1] crystal planes of the millerite structure (ICDD file No. 00-012-0041), and the diffracted peaks of PbS at 30.1° and 43.1° are assigned to the [2 0 0] and [2 2 0] crystal planes of the cubic structure (ICDD file No. 65-0135), respectively. The XRD results demonstrate that the NiS/PbS composite film on the FTO substrate was prepared successfully.

Fig. 2 shows typical FESEM and surface cross-sectional images of NiS/PbS composite nanostructures synthesized at different deposition times. The reaction time was varied from 0 min to 50 min for PbS deposition on the NiS surface. Fig. 2(a) shows the FESEM image of NiS on the FTO-coated conducting substrate. Compact NiS nanoparticle clusters were deposited on the entire surface of the FTO substrate. The thicknesses of bare NiS and PbS CEs are found to be 352 nm (Fig. 2(g)) and 346 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the FESEM image of the NiS sample prepared at 10 min of deposition in the PbS solution (NiS/PbS1), which reveals clustered nanoparticles with 27–50 nm diameter. When the PbS deposition time was 10 min, the deposited PbS nanoparticles covered the surface of NiS, the density was incomplete, and the thicknesses of NiS and PbS were 235 nm and 231 nm, respectively, (Fig. 2(h)). This loading amount of PbS nanoparticles is still not sufficient to form a continuous composite film. Therefore, we decided to increase the PbS deposition time. As the deposition time increased to 20 min and 30 min, the thickness and density of the PbS nanocrystals increased. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show that the PbS catalysts are uniformly decorated on the surface of the NiS film. The thicknesses of the PbS layer in NiS/PbS2 and NiS/PbS3 (Fig. 2(i) and (j)) were 258 nm and 282 nm, respectively.

Fig. 2(e) shows the PbS sample morphology on NiS deposited for 40 min (NiS/PbS4). With this deposition time, the PbS nanoparticles tend to agglomerate with increasing particle size (30–61 nm) and the thickness of the PbS layer increases to 305 nm (Fig. 2(k)). Fig. 2(f) shows the FESEM image of the NiS/PbS5 electrode. Interestingly, these nanoparticles combined to form nanospheres through agglomeration. The particle sizes of the deposited nanospheres were 130–150 nm, and the thickness was 348 nm (Fig. 2(l)). Therefore, we concluded that the density, thickness, and morphology of PbS varied with the deposition time. This is consistent with the SEM images. The growth and variation of nanoparticles of NiS/PbS at different deposition times of PbS on the surface of NiS are shown in Scheme 1. With increasing deposition time of PbS on NiS, an increase is observed in the contact surface of the polysulfide electrolyte. Consequently, such an increase makes electrons to efficiently move back from polysulfide to the CE, which causes the enhanced power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs. However, with further increasing deposition time of PbS, electron transfer from a CE to the polysulfide electrolyte decreases. This reduction of electron transfer is attributed to the increasing CE layer thickness, which leads to decreasing charge transfer of the CE/electrolyte interface.41 Also, with an excess amount of PbS on NiS, the size of PbS increases and the CE becomes dominant. As a result, its band gap reduces and the conduction band shifts toward the redox level of the electrolyte,42 which prevents an efficient reduction of polysulfide by the CE and the decreasing power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs. We expect that the optimized NiS/PbS composite electrode will provide superior photovoltaic performance in QDSSCs with polysulfide electrolyte.

Fig. 3 shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of cross-sectional NiS/PbS nanostructures, including nanoparticles, agglomerate nanoparticles, and nanospheres, obtained at different deposition times (0 to 50 min). Due to the cross-sectional measurement of the films, the elements in the FTO glass were also detected. Atomic percentages of 24.8% and 23.4% were observed for nickel and sulfur in the NiS thin film, respectively, (Fig. 3(a)). The atomic ratio of Ni to S in NiS is approximately 1:1, confirming the stoichiometry of NiS. After the 10 min deposition of PbS (NiS/PbS1), the Ni content reduced from 24.8% to 22.7%, the S percentage improved from 23.4% to 23.5%, and the atomic percentage of Pb was 2.8%. With higher deposition time (10 to 50 min), a gradual decrease of Ni was observed. However, the percentages of S and Pb increased with the PbS deposition time. Apart from the surface morphology, the optimized atomic ratio % of Pb and S in the NiS/PbS composite might also play a vital role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. Therefore, the atomic percentages of Ni, Pb, and S depend on the PbS deposition time.

The composition and the chemical bond configuration of NiS and NiS/PbS3 samples were measured using XPS analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the XPS survey spectrum of the as-obtained NiS nanostructures confirms the presence of Ni and S signals. The survey spectrum of NiS/PbS3 (Fig. 4(b)) shows the presence of Ni, S, and Pb. The binding energies of the Ni2p1/2 and Ni2p3/2 peaks are observed at 870.4 and 853.5 eV, respectively, for the NiS and NiS/PbS3 electrodes (Fig. 4(c)). The S2p spectrum contains two main peaks and one shake-up satellite. The S2p spectrum (Fig. 4(d)) shows two relevant peaks in NiS (161.8 eV: S2p1/2; 160.7 eV: S2p3/2) and NiS/PbS (161.5 eV: S2p1/2; 160.3 eV: S2p3/2) thin films, respectively, clearly showing the shifting of the peak with the deposition of PbS. The peak at 161.8 eV is typical for metal–sulphur bonds, while the peak centered at 160.7 eV is attributed to the sulphur ion in low coordination at the surface of samples.43 The S2p results are consistent with the expected values (160–164 eV) of S in sulfide phases.44,45 The peak at about 168.8 eV in NiS and at 167.5 eV in NiS/PbS, attributed to SO32−, is also observed in the S2p spectrum. The presence of other sulfur species is still evident and not surprising: surface sulfide is indeed easily oxidized in ambient air.46–48 However, the presence of higher sulfur oxidation states seems to not affect the electrocatalytic performances delivered by the CEs, as it can be inferred by both the cyclic voltammetry analysis and functional tests of devices reported below. Useful information can be extracted from the high-resolution Pb4f XPS spectra of the NiS/PbS3 composite film. The peaks at 137.27 eV and 142.0 eV for the NiS/PbS3 sample are assigned to the binding energies of Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 of NiS/PbS, respectively. The XPS results suggest that NiS and NiS/PbS were successfully deposited on the surface of the FTO substrate.

The surface topography of the as-deposited films was investigated by scanning probe atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 5 shows the corresponding 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) AFM images of the samples deposited for bare NiS and 30 min growth time (NiS/PbS3). With PbS deposition, the density and the thickness of the nanoparticles increase. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the NiS film is smooth, and the root mean square roughness (Rrms) was estimated to be 35.06 nm. The value of Rrms for the NiS/PbS3 film was expected to be significantly higher than that of the NiS film, and the value was 41.6 nm (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). Roughness analysis shows that the surface roughness also increases in NiS/PbS3 compared to the bare NiS electrode. A CE with the high surface roughness would have improved electrocatalytic activity for a triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) or polysulfide/sulfide (Sx2−/S2−) electrolyte system. Also, the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface would be smaller in the case of the NiS/PbS electrode than for the NiS film because the NiS/PbS electrode includes the nanostructure having a large surface area and this could increase the catalytic activity of the CEs for polysulfide reduction. The high electrocatalytic activity caused by the conversion rate of S2− ions is more from oxidized Sn2− ions and tends to result in high current density and FF.49 The AFM analysis is consistent with the SEM analysis of the NiS and NiS/PbS3 electrodes.

Scheme 2 illustrates the structure of a QDSSC based on a CdSe sensitizer with a CdS buffer layer on TiO2 and the NiS/PbS CEs. Upon photoexcitation of the QDs, electrons are injected into an excited state from the CdSe and CdS QDs into the TiO2 conduction band and finally to the FTO. The remaining holes in the QDs are scavenged by the polysulfide electrolyte through the reaction nS2− + h+ → Sn2−. Electrons in FTO move to the cathode through an external circuit and participate in the reduction reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface: Sn2− + e− → nS2−.

The electron transport from QDs into TiO2 and the reduction reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface are also shown in (a and b). 

Scheme 2(a) illustrates that the NiS material covering the FTO surface produces electrocatalytic activity. The reduction process is responsible for the injection of electrons from the CE into the electrolyte. The surface morphology of the NiS nanoparticles is not sufficient to catalyze the polysulfide electrolyte at the CE/electrolyte interface, which results in lower catalytic activity for the CE. The deposition of PbS nanoparticles on NiS improves the conversion rate of S2− from oxidized polysulfide Sn2−, and it tends to result in high current density (Scheme 2(b)). An ideal CE should possess high conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of charge carriers in the electrolyte.
To further characterize the electrodes, the absorption spectra of NiS/PbS CEs fabricated with different growth times of PbS were investigated. Fig. 6(A) shows that the deposition of PbS on NiS extends the absorption spectrum to wavelengths exceeding the infrared region. The red shift of the absorption spectra is due to the size quantization effects as the growth time increased, indicating the sequential growth of the PbS nano-structures.38 The NiS/PbS CEs absorb strongly due to high thickness and lie beyond instrument limitation. In addition, there is an increase in absorption intensity even after loading PbS on NiS. The ability to absorb long-wavelength irradiation makes NiS/PbS an ideal CE for harvesting residual light that penetrates a photoanode such as TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS.

(B) Proposed mechanism for the supply of photoelectrons from the counter-electrode under illumination. (C) Schematic energy band diagram and charge transfer processes in the QDSSC. The PbS electrode serves not only as a CE, but also as a photocathode to improve electron injection into the polysulfide electrolyte. VB and CB are the valence and conduction bands of the electrodes, respectively. Voc1 stands for the absolute difference between the electrode quasi-Fermi (qEf) level and the electrolyte potential for the photoanode, and Voc2 for the photocathode. The total photovoltage (Voc) is equal to the sum of Voc1 and Voc2 in the QDSSC. 
PbS QDs are well-known photo-excited semiconductors that have been used as photo-absorbers to produce photoelectrons under illumination.50 As shown in Fig. 6(B), the generated photoelectrons are expected to transfer to the polysulfide electrolyte and combine with Sn2− to form nS2−, which promotes redox reactions in the polysulfide electrolyte. The PbS electrode serves as a CE and a photocathode to facilitate electron injection into the polysulfide electrolyte to achieve a higher Jsc. The transfer of an electron to the electrolyte through the PbS electrode follows two pathways. One is associated with the ordinary electrocatalytic reaction, and the other is the injection from the PbS conduction band. Therefore, the deposition of PbS on the surface of NiS may improve the photovoltaic performance compared to the bare NiS CE.

Fig. 6(C) shows the energy bands and the related charge transfer processes in the QDSSC based on the NiS/PbS CE and the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode with polysulfide electrolyte. Voc of the QDSSC device is the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi levels (qEf) of the anode and the cathode; i.e., Voc = Voc1 + Voc2. The quasi-Fermi level of either the anode or the cathode depends on the equilibrium position between the electrode and polysulfide electrolyte solution.51 Illuminating the photoactive electrode shifts the quasi-Fermi level toward the vacuum Fermi level. When using the NiS/PbS CE with a photovoltaic response, the QDSSC has a noticeable Voc2 under solar illumination. The density of the PbS nanoparticles on the surface of NiS may change the value of Voc2, and as a result, a noticeable change is observed in the value of Voc in QDSSCs.
To investigate the electrocatalytic activities of the prepared counter-electrodes, CV measurements were carried out using a three-electrode system (Pt mesh, SCE as counter and reference electrodes respectively) with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, Fig. 7(A). The positive and negative peaks correspond to the oxidation of nS2− and the reduction of Sn2−, respectively. The high current of the peak means the active catalytic reaction of the electrode for the S2−/Sn2− redox couples in the polysulfide electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 7(A), Pt has very low electrocatalytic activity in polysulfide electrolyte caused by its irreversibility and overpotential27 due to physisorption. The current peaks of NiS/PbS0 and NiS/PbS5 are relatively low, signifying that NiS/PbS0 and NiS/PbS5 have a poor catalytic activity. NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2 and NiS/PbS4 electrodes exhibit a moderate current demonstrating a large electrode active surface area, which leads to a high electrochemical catalytic activity. The NiS/PbS3 electrode shows the highest current peak and good reversibility accounting for its better electrocatalytic activity, which may result in its best photovoltaic performance in QDSSCs. From the CV results, the NiS/PbS composite electrode can be deduced to have a strong impact on the catalytic activity in reducing polysulfide electrolyte.

The electrolyte solution is composed of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S in an aqueous solution. The scan rate is 100 mV s−1. The Pt electrode is used as CE and Ag/Ag+ works as a reference electrode; (B) Nyquist plots for the symmetric cell configuration consisting of two identical (a) NiS/PbS0, (b) NiS/PbS1, (c) NiS/PbS2, (d) NiS/PbS3, (e) NiS/PbS4, (f) NiS/PbS5 and (g) Pt CEs. The frequency range was set from 100 mHz to 500 kHz, and the amplitude of the alternating current was set to 10 mV in the impedance measurements; (C) the high-impedance range for the Pt CE. The inset in (C) shows the equivalent circuit used for the NiS/PbS and Pt CEs; (D) Tafel curves of the symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with NiS/PbS and Pt CEs. 
We further characterized the symmetrical thin-layer electrochemical cells using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the obtained Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 7B. NiS/PbS and Pt cells showed single-arc curves corresponding to the electrode–electrolyte interface in the Nyquist impedance plots of the EIS data. However, there is a dramatic difference in scale between the large impedances measured for the Pt cell and the much smaller impedances measured for the NiS/PbS cell. The high frequency intercept on the real axis denotes the series resistance (Rs), while the middle frequency region represents the parallel combination of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) with the chemical capacitance (Cμ) at the CE/electrolyte interface. The low frequency region in the plot indicates the Warburg diffusion impedance (Zw) of the electrolyte. To extract the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for each electrode material from the EIS spectra, the data were modeled using the simplified equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 7(C). By fitting the impedance spectroscopy results using the equivalent circuit, the EIS parameters for different CEs could be extracted and are summarized in Table 1. The Nyquist plot of the symmetrical bare PbS CE is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

The Rs values of the NiS, PbS (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†), NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS3, NiS/PbS4, and NiS/PbS5 CEs were 6.63, 6.75, 6.87, 6.39, 6.34, 6.42, and 6.59 Ω, respectively, which are lower than that of the Pt CE (8.60 Ω). This could be attributed to the good bonding strength between the NiS/PbS films and the FTO substrate, which in turn promotes the transfer of more electrons from the external circuit or holes from the electrolyte to the CEs. The Rs value greatly affects the FF of the solar cell, with lower FF resulting from larger Rs. The Rct value decreases as the growth time of PbS increases from 0 to 30 min. Since Rct is inversely proportional to the electrocatalytic activity of CEs, it can be determined that the electrocatalytic activity of NiS/PbS CEs increases as the deposition time of PbS increases from 0 to 30 min, which confirms the results of the J–V curves. The NiS/PbS1 and NiS/PbS2 CEs show higher Rct values of 24.78 and 17.35 Ω, suggesting that the catalytic activity is very poor in the polysulfide electrolyte due to insufficient deposition of PbS. As the growth time of PbS in the NiS/PbS CE increases to 30 min, the loading amount of the PbS catalyst increases, and the Rct value decreases to 10.06 Ω, highlighting the superior electrocatalytic activity of NiS/PbS3 towards S2−/Sn2− redox couples. On further increasing the growth time of PbS to 40 min and 50 min, Rct values of the NiS/PbS4 (23.63 Ω) and NiS/PbS5 (42.59 Ω) CEs become larger compared to that of NiS/PbS3. The impedance increment originates from the increased diameter of PbS nanostructures on NiS nanoparticles.
The low value of Rct demonstrates an acceleration of high electron transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface.52 The values of Rct for the bare NiS (NiS/PbS0 = 39.65 Ω) and PbS (42.12 Ω) CEs are much smaller than those for Pt and NiS/PbS5 but larger than for NiS/PbS3, NiS/PbS2, and NiS/PbS4. The catalytic activity follows the order Pt < NiS/PbS5 < PbS < NiS/PbS0 < NiS/PbS1 < NiS/PbS4 < NiS/PbS2 < NiS/PbS3. The Cμ values of the NiS, PbS, NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS3, NiS/PbS4, NiS/PbS5, and Pt CEs were 137.2, 124.8, 341.6, 659.3, 783.1, 572.8, 116.9 and 5.26 Ω μF, respectively. The NiS/PbS3 CE has a higher Cμ value than the other CEs. The high Cμ value denotes a high surface area and the collection of more photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode owing to low recombination. This results in high electrocatalytic activity.
A lower Zw (0.96 Ω) is observed from NiS/PbS3 due to the well-covered PbS on the surface of NiS. This condition is the major reason for the higher photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs using the NiS/PbS3 CE than those using Pt and NiS CEs. Similar to NiS/PbS3, the NiS/PbS2 (1.39 Ω), NiS/PbS4 (1.87 Ω) and NiS/PbS1 (2.03 Ω) electrodes have decent Zw values, which may be attributed to the surface morphology of PbS on the surface of NiS. Such structures can make the redox couple diffuse smoothly into the electrolyte, as confirmed by the low Zw. The NiS and PbS CEs have higher Zw (6.19 and 6.31 Ω), and more loading of PbS in NiS/PbS5 CE also shows higher Zw (6.39 Ω). The higher Rct (99.71 Ω) and Zw (42.65 Ω) values of the Pt CE indicate poor performance of the electrode with the polysulfide electrolyte and a tendency for drastic loss in FF that affects the photovoltaic performance of the cells. The lower Zw indicates better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of electrons, and improves the performance of the QDSSC by increasing the FF.53
Tafel polarization measurement was also carried out for the NiS, PbS, NiS/PbS and Pt CEs. This measurement was carried out in a symmetric cell assembly with polysulfide electrolyte. The scan rate for this measurement was 10 mV s−1. Fig. 7(D) shows the Tafel plot for the NiS, NiS/PbS and Pt CEs as a function of the log of the current density vs. the applied voltage. The Tafel plot of the bare PbS CE is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The plot is usually divided into three parts: at lower potential is the polarization zone, the curve in the middle with a steep slope is the Tafel zone that determines the catalytic properties of the electrode, and the third region is the diffusion region at higher voltage.54 The slope of a tangent to the NiS/PbS3 curve is slightly higher than that of the other electrodes, indicating that NiS/PbS3 shows a larger exchange current density (J0). This is in good agreement with the EIS values in terms of eqn (1).55 NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, and NiS/PbS4 also show a decent J0, whereas NiS, PbS, NiS/PbS5, and Pt show the smallest J0, indicating poor catalytic activity. (1)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.
At a low sweep rate, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The Jlim values of the NiS/PbS3 electrode are higher than those of the bare NiS, PbS, NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS4, NiS/PbS5, and Pt electrodes, which induce a higher diffusion coefficient, as shown in eqn (2).56 This Tafel-polarization experiment is consistent with the EIS results. (2)where D is the diffusion coefficient of the polysulfide, l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulfide at the CE, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the polysulfide concentration.
FTO/TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS was used as a photoanode to evaluate the photoelectrochemical performance and catalytic properties of NiS, NiS/PbS, and Pt CEs for QDSSCs. The optimization of the NiS CE in QDSSCs is shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† In the J–V curves (Fig. S4, ESI†), the photovoltaic performance was optimized for the NiS CE at 90 min deposition time (Table S2, ESI†). To explore the optimum conditions, the photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the bare NiS, PbS, NiS/PbS, PbS/NiS CEs was evaluated and the results are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The J–V characteristics of the QDSSCs at different deposition times of PbS were measured with the NiS/PbS composite CE at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 8, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photovoltaic efficiency (η), are listed in Table 2. The Voc, Jsc, and FF of the QDSSC with the Pt CE are 0.531 V, 8.76 mA cm−2, and 0.270, respectively, and the corresponding overall η is only 1.29%. The overall low performance of the Pt CE is due to low catalytic activity of Pt in the polysulfide redox couple resulting from the strong absorption of S2− on the surface, which reduces the surface activity of Pt.27 As a result, low η (1.29%) and FF (0.270) are achieved by the QDSSC based on the Pt CE. NiS was applied as a CE in a QDSSC, which produced a Voc of 0.566 V, Jsc of 11.60 mA cm−2, FF of 0.496, and η of 3.26%, implying unsatisfactory catalytic activity. In contrast, the η of PbS was found to be 3.06% (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity of NiS is superior than the PbS CE, as a result an improved photovoltaic performance is observed in QDSSCs.

In the case of NiS/PbS1, η was 3.37%, an obvious enhancement compared to the bare NiS (3.26%). This originated from the 10 min deposition of PbS. This deposition time can increase Jsc and Voc compared to bare NiS. For NiS/PbS CEs, all parameters show similar trends as the deposition time increases. For a deposition time of 20 min, the catalytic activity of the CE enhanced and moderately improved the performance (4.08%). For 30 min of deposition, the QDSSC gave the optimal η of 4.52%, while the FF, Jsc, and Voc improved to 0.539, 14.52 mA cm−2, and 0.596 V, respectively. Compared to the bare NiS CE, the NiS/PbS3 composite CE showed much higher Jsc, FF, and η. However, further increasing the deposition times to 40 and 50 min reduced the cell performance because Jsc and FF deteriorated due to reduction of the Ni atomic percentage in NiS/PbS4 and NiS/PbS5. The resulting overall η values of 3.47% and 2.69% were still much higher than that of the reference Pt CE. The 30 min deposition time is enough to obtain higher catalytic activity. The QDSSCs fabricated using PbS/NiS shows a low FF value of 0.460 and a moderate power conversion efficiency of 3.79% (Table S2, ESI†). The FF of QDSSCs is mainly attenuated by the total series resistance of the cell, electron transport resistance through the photoanode, ion transport resistance and charge transfer resistance at the counter-electrode. The higher Jsc and FF of the NiS/PbS CE than the PbS/NiS CE are due to considerable improvement in charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, which reduces the internal resistances, the concentration gradients in the electrolyte, and the recombination rates. These results show that the NiS/PbS composite CE is efficient for reducing the polysulfide electrolyte due to low charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface.
The noticeable increase of Voc with the introduction of PbS in the CE could be the result of a more positive potential of PbS in the electrolyte.33Voc of a QDSSC is determined by eqn (3):57–59 (3)where Ec is the conduction band (CB) edge energy level, Eredox is the potential of the electrolyte, KT is the thermal energy, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the CB, and NCB is the total number of CB states. Therefore, Voc of a QDSSC is mainly related to the photoanode and the electrolyte.
The differences in these CEs were further investigated by the open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) technique. Fig. 9 shows the Voc decay characterization of the QDSSCs with different CEs, where the rate of the voltage reduction denotes the electron lifetime of the electrons in the device. It is clear that the Voc of the devices with NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS3, and NiS/PbS4 CEs decay more slowly, which suggests a longer electron lifetime than that of QDSSCs based on NiS/PbS5, NiS, and Pt CEs. As the PbS deposition time is increased up to 30 min, the electron lifetime is increased and then decreases thereafter with further deposition of PbS deposition (30 min to 50 min). This is in good agreement with the J–V analysis.

EIS is a powerful method to investigate the internal resistance attributed to the charge-transfer properties of QDSSCs. The series resistance (Rs) is the non-zero intercept on the real axis of the impedance plot at higher frequency, which indicates the sheet resistance of TCO and the contact resistance of FTO/TiO2. The impedance at higher frequency in the impedance spectra corresponded to the capacitance (CCE) and charge-transfer resistance (RCE) at the CE/electrolyte interface. The impedance at low frequency corresponds to Nernst diffusion (Zw) of the polysulfide electrolyte. The medium-frequency response is associated with the capacitance (Cμ) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2-QD/electrolyte interface, where an accumulation of photoelectrons and redox shuttles is expected. The corresponding Nyquist plots for the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz are shown in Fig. 10(A). The plots were analyzed using Z-view software using an equivalent circuit (Fig. 10(C))60,61 and the parameters obtained from the plots are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 10(B) shows the higher magnification plot of the QDSSC based on a Pt CE.

(B) High magnified plot of Pt at higher impedance range. (C) The equivalent circuit used to fit the EIS experimental data. 
The Rs values are at the same level for various CEs. The NiS/PbS3 CE shows a low value and the Pt and bare NiS CEs show higher Rs values. RCE values for PbS growth times of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min were 1.23 Ω, 1.17 Ω, 0.86 Ω, 0.85 Ω, 0.95 Ω, and 1.3 Ω, respectively. The value of RCE decreases as the deposition time of PbS increases from 0 to 30 min. As the PbS deposition time increased from 30 to 50 min, the loading amount of the PbS catalyst increases, and the RCE value increased from 0.85 Ω to 1.3 Ω. The low Rs and RCE values of the NiS/PbS3 CE lead to higher electrocatalytic activity, reflecting the acceleration of the charge transfer. This can lead to high Jsc, FF, and η of QDSSCs. The NiS/PbS3 QDSSC has much lower Rct (0.96 Ω) and Zw (0.42 Ω), indicating more electrolyte diffusion. The high Cμ value (575.5 μF) of NiS/PbS3 indicates the collection of more photo-excited electrons into the CB of the photoanode due to low recombination. In comparison, the Pt QDSSC has very high RCE (14.89 Ω), Rs (12.73 Ω), and Zw (12.77 Ω), which result in very poor efficiency. The high Zw is due to the catalytic poisoning of the CE with polysulfide, making it unstable and decreasing the FF.62,63 These results verified that the electrocatalytic activity of the NiS/PbS3 CE is higher than that of bare NiS, Pt, and other NiS/PbS CEs.
According to the EIS model, the electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated from the peak angular frequency (fmax) in the Bode plot. The corresponding Bode phase plots for cells with different PbS growth times are shown in Fig. 10(D). τe can be calculated according to eqn (4): (4) The decrease of fmax corresponds to a faster diffusion rate and lifetime that hinder electron recombination, which improves the photovoltaic performance. The τe values obtained for bare NiS/PbS0, NiS/PbS1, NiS/PbS2, NiS/PbS3, NiS/PbS4, NiS/PbS5, and Pt CEs are 77.2, 94.7, 128.3, 150.1, 110.5, 69.1, and 0.054 ms, respectively. With increasing growth times of PbS on NiS, the contact surface of the polysulfide redox couple increases. However, with deposition time more than 30 min, the electron transfer from the CE to the polysulfide electrolyte decreases. Among the investigated samples, the device based on NiS/PbS3 has lower charge transport resistance and higher τe, which contribute to the higher photovoltaic performance.
The stability of the CE is crucial to the performance of the QDSSCs. The devices were stored at room temperature for a few hours in the dark and then exposed to light illumination for 600 min continuously. The results of the NiS/PbS3 CE are presented in Fig. 11. For comparison, the stabilities of QDSSCs with NiS and Pt CEs were also investigated. The photovoltaic parameters were measured every 60 min. After illumination with light, the photovoltaic performance of the QDSSC significantly increases due to the improved penetration of the polysulfide electrolyte through the entire thickness of the electrode and the “activation” of the complete electrode.64,65
 Fig. 11  Comparison of photostability parameters of QDSSCs based on NiS (NiS/PbS0), Pt and NiS/PbS3 CEs under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for 600 min. Voc: open-circuit voltage; Jsc: short-circuit photocurrent density; FF: fill factor; η: power conversion efficiency. 
The efficiency of the NiS CE decreased from 3.38% to 3.01%, and that of the Pt CE changed from 1.31% to 0.93% in 600 min. For the NiS/PbS electrode, Voc and FF were constant and Jsc was improved (14.08 to 14.28 mA cm−2), and as a result, η was slightly improved (4.52 to 4.59%). The Jsc and FF gains compensate for the loss of Voc in the NiS and Pt CEs, resulting in almost constant efficiency during light illumination. Therefore, the QDSSC based on the NiS/PbS CE showed stabilization of the performance and no degradation. This cell has outstanding stability with no measurable degradation of the initial performance. The low photostability of the Pt CE is due to the chemisorption of sulfur compounds from the electrolyte that reduced the availability of the active catalytic sites. Thus, the catalytic activity of the Pt CE decreased gradually over time. The deposition of PbS could improve the charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface and improved the photostability. By further optimizing the NiS/PbS CE and the QDs-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, the performance of the QDSSCs could be further improved.
The better photovoltaic performance of the NiS/PbS composite is attributed to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity due to (i) well-arranged surface morphology of the PbS nanoparticles on the surface of NiS, (ii) the optimized thickness of PbS on NiS, (iii) the optimization of S at% enabling a better reduction of polysulfide electrolyte, (iv) the low charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface resulting in a high FF, and (v) the large difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and the S2−/Sn2− redox level improving the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc).
4. Conclusions
Highly electrocatalytic and stable NiS/PbS composite CEs have been fabricated using a low-cost and low-temperature CBD technique. The composite can serve as a robust high-performance CE in QDSSCs without any post-treatment. The PbS nano-morphologies were tuned from nanoparticles to nanospheres by controlling the PbS growth time. The NiS/PbS composite CE shows greater electrocatalytic activity and improved photovoltaic performance compared to NiS and Pt CEs for the polysulfide electrolyte used in QDSSCs. The CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSC with the NiS/PbS3 composite CE had a η of 4.52% under the illumination of one sun (100 mW cm−2), a higher value than that of the NiS (3.26%), PbS (3.06%) and Pt (1.29%) CEs. The optimized NiS/PbS CE enabled nearly 39% and 250% increases in power conversion efficiencies compared to the NiS and Pt electrodes. The improved photovoltaic performance of the NiS/PbS3 composite CE is due to the lowest Rct value of 10.06 Ω, which is an order lower than that of the NiS (39.65 Ω), PbS (42.12 Ω) and Pt (99.71 Ω) CEs. Also, an appropriate amount of PbS in the NiS/PbS composite film can improve the performance of the CE. Excessive PbS will reduce the amount of highly catalytic sites of PbS in the CE and lead to a higher Rct value at the CE/electrolyte interface. A preliminary long-term stability test of the CdS/CdSe QDSSCs revealed that the NiS/PbS composite CE has good stability. This strategy paves the way for fabricating cheap, stable, and highly efficient composite CEs for QDSSCs.
