    , Accepted 13th October 2014First published on 13th October 2014AbstractAs an effort to improve the photovoltaic properties of a highly efficient large band gap (2.11 eV) alternating copolymer, P(BDT-TDPPDT), comprised of electron rich benzodithiophene (BDT) and novel electron accepting pyrrole-based imide functionalized 4,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dioctylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione (TDPPDT) derivatives, we incorporated a relatively strong electron accepting thiophene-based imide functionalized thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit in its main chain via random copolymerization between BDT, TDPPDT and TPD units to give polymer P1. The incorporation of a TPD unit resulted in significant improvement in the optoelectrical and photovoltaic properties. P1 exhibits lower optical band gap (1.91 eV) and a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level compared to those of P(BDT-TDPPDT). The hole mobility of P1 was 3.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the PSC made with a simple device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1:PC70BM(1:2.25 wt%) + 3 vol%/Al gave a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.03% with high photovoltaic parameters, such as an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.52 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70%. Interestingly, P1-based PSCs exhibited a high incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of a maximum of 78% at 410 nm and a more than 70% response between 370–590 nm. The PCE achieved in this study is the highest value reported thus far among PSCs made with random copolymers.
1. Introduction
Numerous novel structured electron donating π-conjugated polymers1 and electron accepting fullerene derivatives2 have been developed in recent years with the aim of improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSCs prepared with a large band gap polymer, such as P3HT,3a,b PCDTBT3c–e or PBnDT-FTAZ,3f,g (Eg ∼ 1.9–2.0 eV), as an electron donor and fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor have offered PCEs in the range of 6–8%,3 and the PSCs prepared with a suitable low band gap polymer as an electron donor and fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor provided an improved PCE in the range of 8–9%.4 On the other hand, the tandem PSCs consisting of the front cell made from blends of large band gap P3HT:ICBM and the rear cell prepared from blends of low band gap:PC70BM gave a maximum PCE up to 11.5%.5 Previous attempts of preparing tandem PSCs with different large and low band gap polymers have shown a maximum PCE in the range of 8–9.5%.6 In this instance, the PCE of tandem PSCs is expected to be improved further by replacing P3HT with other large band gap polymers, which produce a higher PCE than P3HT because the front cell PCE is crucial for the overall device performance of tandem PSCs.
Recently, we reported a high solar to electrical energy converting large band gap polymer, P(BDT-TDPPDT) (Fig. 1), containing electron rich benzodithiophene (BDT) and electron deficient 4,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dioctylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione (TDPPDT) units for PSCs.7 Interestingly, PSCs made with P(BDT-TDPPDT) and PC70BM gave a PCE of 6.74% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.94 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71. Although the band gap (∼2.11 eV) of P(BDT-TDPPDT) is higher than that of the most successful large band gap polymer, P3HT (∼1.90 eV), the overall PCE is 3% higher with significantly improved Voc and FF compared to the results obtained for the PSCs made with P3HT and PC60BM or PC70BM.3a In addition, the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the P(BDT-TDPPDT)-based PSC is 6% higher than that of P3HT based PSCs.5 Those unique properties made P(BDT-TDPPDT) a promising large band gap polymer. To improve the PCE of the P(BDT-TDPPDT)-based single layer PSC further, an attempt was made to lower the polymer band gap because shifting the absorption band of P(BDT-TDPPDT) towards the low energy part of the solar spectra is expected to offer a higher Jsc and PCE. A simple way to lower the band gap of a polymer is to incorporate another strong electron acceptor unit in the polymer chain. Interestingly, the polymer PBDTTPD (shown in Fig. 1), which was comprised of electron rich BDT and electron deficient 5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),8 displayed very good opto-electrical (Eg ∼ 1.73 eV) properties and high photovoltaic performance.4c,8 Both of the thiophene and pyrrole-based imide functionalized polymers, such as PBDTTPD and P(BDT-TDPPDT), produce a high PCE even though their band gaps are quite different. The incorporation of TPD units in the main chain of P(BDT-TDPPDT) is expected to lower the band gap of the final polymer significantly. Consequently, the improved absorption of the new polymer might offer a higher PCE than P(BDT-TDPPDT).

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and instruments
The required monomers, such as 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-dibromo-5-octyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD) and the necessary reagents and solvents, such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2dba3), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) and chlorobenzene were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. On the other hand, monomer 4,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dioctylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,5H)-dione (TDPPDT) was prepared via the procedure reported elsewhere.71H NMR spectroscopy of P1 was recorded using a Varian Mercury Plus spectrometer (300 MHz). The molecular weight of P1 was determined by GPC (Agilent 1200 Infinity Series separation module) with chloroform as the eluent, and calibration using a polystyrene standard. TGA and DSC analyses of the polymer were performed on TA instrument Q600-0825 and TA instrument Q200-1968 at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen at the Korea Basic Science Institute. A JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer was used to record the absorption spectra of the polymer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymer was conducted using a CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyzer. CV was carried out on the polymer film on a platinum working electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4), Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and platinum wire as a counter electrode. The CV instrument was calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard. AFM was performed using a Seiko Instruments apparatus (SPI 3800N-SPA 400).
2.2 Synthesis of polymer

Synthesis of P1. 
A flame dried three neck round bottom flask containing a solution of monomers BDT (0.31 g, 0.40 mmol), TDPPDT (0.14 g, 0.20 mmol) and TPD (0.09 g, 0.20 mmol) in chlorobenzene (20 mL) was purged well with argon for 30 min. Subsequently, Pd2dba3 (21 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (45 mg) were added and the entire mixture was heated under reflux in argon for 36 h. The solution was cooled to RT and the solution was added drop wise to methanol (250 mL) with constant stirring. The precipitated polymer was then allowed to settle. The precipitates were filtered and washed with methanol (50 mL) and acetone (50 mL). The polymer was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol and acetone for 24 h. The resulting polymer was dissolved in chloroform (20 mL) and filtered. The polymer was again precipitated by adding methanol (250 mL). The precipitates were filtered and dried under vacuum to afford pure polymer P1 as a dark brown color solid. Yield: 0.32 g (97%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.27–9.00 (m, 8H), 3.00–4.40 (m, 14H), 0.60–2.40 (m, 105H). The m:n ratio of P1 was calculated to be 1:1 from the NMR spectra and the yield obtained for P1.

2.3 Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with the following structure; ITO-coated glass substrate/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS)/P1:PC70BM/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried overnight in an oven. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from an aqueous solution to form a 40 nm thick film. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred to a glove box to spin-cast the charge separation layer. A solution containing a mixture of P1:PC70BM (1:2.00, 1:2.25 and 1:2.50 wt%) in chlorobenzene (CB) was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. For the samples with the additive materials, a 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) additive was added to a solution of P1:PC70BM in CB with a volume ratio of 97:3 (CB:DIO). The film with a thickness of 85 nm was dried for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in a glove box. An aluminium (Al, 100 nm) electrode was then deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of approximately 3 × 10−6 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cell performance was measured with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparing the solar simulator spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum at RT.
2.4 Fabrication and characterization of OFETs
The OFETs were fabricated on highly n-type-doped silicon (Si) substrates with a 200 nm layer of thermally grown silicon oxide (SiO2). All Si substrates were activated by an UV-ozone treatment for 30 min and treated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer. The n-type doped Si substrate functions as a gate electrode and the SiO2 layer acts as a gate dielectric. The P1 solution in a CB solvent with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 was spin-cast on top of the Si substrate with a spin speed of 2000 rpm and then dried at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes. The source and drain electrodes (Au, 70 nm) were deposited on top of the P1 layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of approximately 2 × 10−6 Torr. The channel length (L) and channel width (W) of the device was 50 μm and 3.0 mm, respectively. The output and transfer characteristics of the OFETs were measured using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200). All preparation processes and characterization of the OFETs were performed inside a N2-atmosphere glove box. The mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime:IDS,sat = (μWCi/2L)(VGS − VT)2where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2) and VT is the threshold voltage.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and structural characterization
A new random copolymer, P1, was prepared via the random copolymerization of distannyl derivative of BDT with the dibromo derivative of TPD and TDPPDT, as shown in Scheme 1. The number and weight average molecular weights (Mn and Mw) of P1 were 1.82 × 104 g mol−1 and 8.59 × 104 g mol−1, respectively, with a polydispersity (PDI) of 4.73. Although polymer P1 showed high molecular weights, the solubility was excellent in chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to the synthesis of P1. 
The thermal properties of P1 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and their corresponding curves are presented in Fig. 2. The 5% weight loss temperature of P1 was estimated to be 340 °C from the TGA curve and the glass transition temperature (Tg) calculated from the DSC curve was 117 °C. No other exothermic and endothermic peaks, such as melting (Tm) or crystallization (Tc) peak, were observed while heating or cooling between 0–350 °C. The 5% weight loss temperature and Tg of P1 were identical to or only slightly different from those of P(BDT-TDPPDT) (340 °C and 113 °C, respectively)7 and PBDTTPD (380 °C and 138 °C, respectively),8 indicating that P1 has thermal stability similar to that of P(BDT-TDPPDT) or PBDTTPD.

3.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of polymers P(BDT-TDPPDT), PBDTTPD and P1 spin-cast on glass plate are shown in Fig. 3a. The maximum absorption (522 nm) of P1 was red shifted 28 nm in film state compared to that of P(BDT-TDPPDT). Based on the onset absorption wavelength of 648 nm as the film state, the optical band gap (Eg) of P1 was estimated to be 1.91 eV. The band gap of P1 was 0.2 eV lower and 0.18 eV higher than those of P(BDT-TDPPDT)7 and PBDTTPD,8 respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra of P1, P(BDT-TDPPDT) and PBDTTPD in film state and (b) CV spectra of P1. 
The incorporation of a relatively strong electron accepting TPD unit into the P(BDT-TDPPDT) main chain is expected to enhance the electron pulling ability from the donor (D) to the acceptor (A) unit compared to that in P(BDT-TDPPDT), but decrease electron transfer from the D to A unit compared to that in PBDTTPD due to the random incorporation of the TPD unit. In this instance, the absorption band of random copolymer P1 was located between the respective alternating polymers, P(BDT-TDPPDT) and PBDTTPD. The recently reported random polymer also displayed similar trends.9
The onset oxidation (Eox onset) potential of P1 was estimated to be 1.15 eV from the cyclic voltammogram shown in Fig. 3b. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO and LUMO) energy levels of P1 were calculated to be −5.39 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively, using the Eox onset and Eg values. These results suggest that inclusion of the TPD unit in the P(BDT-TDPPDT) main chain lowers the LUMO level by 0.2 eV, but does not alter the HOMO level of P(BDT-TDPPDT).7a The HOMO levels of the alternating polymers P(BDT-TDPPDT) and PBDTTPD were quite similar (∼−5.40 eV),7a,8b but the LUMO of PBDTTPD was found to be ∼0.4 eV lower than that of P(BDT-TDPPDT) due to the strong electron accepting ability of the TPD unit compared to that of the TDPPDT unit. Consequently, the presence of a TPD unit in the random polymer P1 main chain does not alter the HOMO level, but lowers the LUMO level significantly, and the LUMO level of P1 was located between the LUMO levels of P(BDT-TDPPDT) and PBDTTPD. Table 1 lists the molecular weight, absorption maximum and HOMO/LUMO levels of P1.

3.3 Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 4(a) shows the structure of the PSC device together with the molecular structures and an energy level diagram of the component materials. ITO forms the bottom electrode and the PEDOT:PSS layer on top of ITO serves a buffer layer for matching the energy levels of ITO and the components of BHJ. The BHJ consists of a composite of P1 as an electron donor and the PC70BM as an electron acceptor. Under irradiation, the holes and electrons generated in the BHJ layer are collected at the ITO and the Al electrode, respectively.

(b) J–V characteristics of the PSCs prepared with three different P1:PC70BM blend ratios (1:2.00 wt%, 1:2.25 wt% and 1:2.50 wt%) with 1,8-diiodoocatne (3 vol%, DIO), and without DIO for 1:2.25 wt% blend. (c) IPCE spectra of PSCs made with (3 vol%)/without DIO for 1:2.25 wt% blends. 
The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs made from the three different P1:PC70BM blend ratios (1:2.00 wt%, 1:2.25 wt% and 1:2.50 wt%) with 1,8-diiodoocatne (3 vol%, DIO) as a processive additive are displayed in Fig. 4b. The J–V measurements were performed under one sun of simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (1000 W m−2). The maximum PCE for the PSC device prepared from the 1:2.25 wt% blends was 7.03% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 11.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70%. A further increase or decrease in the PC70BM content in the photoactive layer diminished the photovoltaic parameters significantly. The three PSC device results are summarized in Table 2. The J–V curve of the PSCs prepared without DIO for the 1:2.25 wt% blend ratio was also measured to understand the importance of processive additive, and the respective J–V curve and device results are also included in Fig. 4b and Table 2, respectively. The device results obtained for the PSCs made with and without DIO showed that the processive additive is quite important for achieving high photovoltaic performance for the pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione-based polymers. The photovoltaic parameters, such as Voc and FF, obtained for the P1-based PSCs are similar to those of PSCs made from P(BDT-TDPPDT) due to their comparable HOMO levels and hole mobility but the improved Jsc of P1-based PSCs due to the wider and red shifted absorption of P1 enhances the overall device performances up to 7.03%.

The higher Jsc value of the PSCs made with P1 compared to that of P(BDT-TDPPDT) was confirmed using incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectroscopy. The IPCE spectra of the PSCs prepared with/without DIO for the 1:2.25 wt% blends are presented in Fig. 4c and the device made with DIO shows higher IPCE maxima than that of the device prepared without DIO. The PSC made with DIO displayed an IPCE maximum of 78% at 410 nm with a more than 70% IPCE response from 370 nm to 590 nm while the PSC made without DIO showed a lower IPCE maximum of 32% at 480 nm. The increased IPCE maxima and response for the PSC made with DIO showed significantly higher Jsc values. The maximum IPCE value was 2% higher than that of the PSC device prepared with P(BDT-TDPPDT) and the spectral region was extended to 700 nm.7
The higher Jsc of the PSCs made with DIO than that of the device made without DIO was confirmed further by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5. The phase and tapping mode AFM images (a, a* and b, b*, respectively) of the films prepared without DIO showed large clusters (350 and 450 nm) of PC70BM while the films made with DIO (images c, c* and d, d*, respectively) represented well defined nanoscale phase separation. The surface roughness of the films made with DIO (roughness ∼ 0.17 deg and 2.33 nm, respectively) was significantly lower than the films prepared without DIO (roughness ∼3.76 deg and 9.97 nm, respectively). The large clusters of PC70BM are liable for the recombination of photo-generated excitons before they reach the interfaces, which leads to the loss in Jsc and FF for the device made without DIO. On the other hand, the very good nanoscale phase separation and smooth surface of the photoactive layer prepared with DIO enhances the exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a considerable increase in Jsc, FF and PCE. These results suggest that the surface morphology of the films made from P1 is improved significantly using the DIO additive. In addition, the film made from the P1:PC70BM blend with DIO showed smoother surfaces (rms roughness ∼ 0.17 deg and 2.33 nm, respectively, for phase and tapping mode) than that of the film made from P(BDT-TDPPDT):PC70BM blend (rms roughness ∼ 0.52 deg and 5.60 nm, respectively, for phase and tapping mode).7a These results indicate that the incorporation of a TPD unit in the polymer main chain notably lowers the photoactive layer surface roughness and is expected to improve the charge transport and collection leading to a higher PCE.

Preliminary organic field effect transistors (OFETs) studies for P1 showed that it exhibits p-type semiconductor behaviour and the field-effect mobility was calculated to be 3.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a current on/off ratio of 1.48 × 105 and a threshold voltage of −6.72 V from the transfer characteristics shown in Fig. 6. The mobility of P1 was similar to that of P(BDT-TDPPDT) for the devices prepared under identical preparation conditions.7 The overall device performance of P1 were found improved compared with those of their respective alternating polymers, such as P(BDT-TDPPDT)7 and PBDTTPD8 using the DIO additive.

Polymer P1 is the most efficient random copolymer among the reported highly efficient random copolymers for PSCs.10 Although the band gap of P1 is lower than that of P(BDT-TDPPDT), it is still higher than those of other highly efficient low band polymers.4 The incorporation of DFBT,4a TT4b or DKPP6 unit in P(BDT-TDPPDT) instead of TPD might offer a broad absorbing low band gap polymer (∼1.4–1.7 eV), and is expected to give a higher PCE than P1. Currently, attempts to prepare those random polymers is ongoing.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated the possibility of increasing the PCE of a pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione-based large band gap (∼2.11 eV) polymer, P(BDT-TDPPDT), via the incorporation of a thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit in the polymer main chain by random copolymerization. The inclusion of a TPD unit in the P(BDT-TDPPDT) main chain decreases the band gap as well as improves the surface morphology of the photoactive layer of the resulting random polymer (P1), and consequently the PCE of the PSC prepared from P1 was improved to 7.03%. This is the highest value reported so far among PSCs made with random copolymers. This study proves that random copolymers also produce a high PCE. In addition, P1 is also expected to be a promising large band gap candidate for the front cell in the preparation of effective tandem PSCs.
