    , Accepted 13th October 2015First published on 13th October 2015AbstractCharge recombination dynamics in intrinsic perovskite film and in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells have been systematically studied, which are found to be mediated by the energetic distribution of intra-gap trap states as described by the trap-limited recombination theory. Besides, the passivation effect of the hole-transport material on trap states is discussed.
Organometallic perovskite (such as CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells, as a new class of photovoltaics, have raised waves of scientific investigation due to their thrillingly high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 Since the first introduction of perovskites as photovoltaic materials, the PCE record has soared from 3.8% to over 20% in the past 5 years.4,5 The rather high PCE primarily arises from the intrinsic ambipolar-transport property, unique charge accumulation capacity and the prominent light-harvesting ability of perovskite film.6,7 It's also well known that the long diffusion length of the charge carriers in bulky perovskite gives rise to the prominent charge collection efficiency in this kind of solar cell.8–10 On this basis, numerous strategies such as optimizing the size of the perovskite crystals,11 the orientation of the crystal growth12,13 and so on have been reported to further accelerate charge transport and block charge recombination in the perovskite phase. Notably, Manser and Kamat have verified the existence of trap-free recombination with second-order kinetics behavior in perovskite film, which is very helpful for comprehending the mechanism of the band-gap recombination.14 Nevertheless, the understanding of the charge transport/recombination mechanism in intrinsic perovskite film is still limited and more relevant research is imperative. For the area of complete perovskite solar cells, there have also been numerous works reported focusing on charge transport/recombination dynamics. For example, in the case of meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, it has been experimentally confirmed that charge transport dynamics is negligibly dependent on the mobility of the hole transport material (HTM)15 or the thickness of the perovskite layer,16 while the equilibrium between the electron and hole drift exhibits a significant influence on the overall rate of charge transport.17 On the other hand, a series of influencing factors on charge recombination dynamics including the morphology of the mesoporous scaffold, the device fabrication method, the physical nature of perovskite (e.g. ferroelectricity) and so on were systematically studied by different means, such as transient photoconductivity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, transient optical spectroscopy and intensity modulated photovoltage/photocurrent.18–21 In addition, in a regular perovskite solar cell based on a meso-superstructure, it has been found that the interfaces of TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/HTM play the role of recombination centers in determining the rate of charge recombination.22 Despite these significant efforts, more details of the charge recombination mechanism remain to be elucidated. For instance, the origin of persistent photovoltage is not well understood, although charge recombination is thought to be crucial for it;23 the correlation between recombination behaviors and the photovoltaic performance still lacks a detailed investigation.
In this communication, we studied the dynamics of charge recombination in intrinsic perovskite film and in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, respectively, by means of transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-resolved charge extraction (TRCE). In both cases, the influences of trap states on recombination dynamics were discussed and the possible mechanism of charge recombination was proposed. Lastly, the relation between the trap state distribution and the overall photovoltaic performance was explored and the effect of HTM on passivating the interfacial trap states was highlighted.
To begin our work, the intrinsic perovskite film was prepared by a one-step method for spectroscopy studies. The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of the intrinsic perovskite film is shown in Fig. 1(a) (left y axis), where two characteristic peaks (at 500 nm and 750 nm) are clearly observed confirming the formation of MAPbI3.24,25Fig. 1(a) (right y axis) also shows the representative transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy at 8.3 ps after photoexcitation, in which two negative (around 500 nm and 760 nm) and one positive (around 700 nm) photoinduced signals are observed. The negative signal around 500 nm is assigned to the photo-bleaching (PB) which may arise from the electron population in the conduction band of perovskite9 or in the LUMO of PbI2.26 On the other hand, the second negative signal (760 nm) shows an accordant characteristic wavelength with the steady fluorescence of perovskite,6,17,27 which is often treated as another PB. Notably, it has been verified that the PB at 760 nm is coupled with photoinduced luminescence (PL), arising from the free charge carriers.8 Furthermore, it's widely accepted that the positive signal around 700 nm is also due to the band-filling of charge carriers.28–30 Hereinafter, we name these characteristic signals as PB1, PB2 and PA, respectively. Fig. 1(b) reveals the generation kinetics of these signals and the corresponding fitting results based on monoexponential functions, from which one can obtain the generation time constants for PB1 (τPB1), PB2 (τPB2) and PA (τPA), which are about 0.1 ps, 0.5 ps and 0.6 ps respectively. The value of τPB1 is within the instrument response time, implying that PB1 is instantaneously generated after photoexcitation.9 Meanwhile, PA and PB2 exhibit slower but comparable generation kinetics, which could be assigned to the cooling down of hot charges.31 Despite the distinctly different generation kinetics among PB1, PB2 and PA, the dynamics of the PB recoveries and the PA decay could reflect the charge recombination processes.
 Fig. 1  (a) Steady absorption spectrum (left y axis) and TA spectrum recorded 8.3 ps after photoexcitation (right y axis) at 788 nm for the MAPbI3 film on a quartz substrate. The intensity of the excitation light is 140 μJ per cm2 per pulse. (b) Generation kinetics of PB1 (black), PB2 (red) and PA (blue) extracted from the TA spectra. To see the kinetics clearly, the amplitudes of PB1 and PA have been respectively multiplied by 15 and 2. 
As seen from Fig. 2(a), both PB recoveries and the PA decay exhibit a non-exponential behavior, which indicates that charge recombination in the intrinsic perovskite film is not a first order reaction. Interestingly, considering the proportional relation between ΔOD and the charge density (n), we found that these kinetics could be fitted by a power function, n(t) = n0 × (1 + at)−α. The power function was previously termed as an empirical formula and used to interpret the charge recombination dynamics in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) by taking into account the involvement of trap states in recombination.32 In this work, within the framework of multiple-trap theory, the empirical function was theoretically derived and the physical significances of the parameters n0, a and α were clarified (see Section S3 of the ESI†). Here we focus on the parameter α, i.e. the tail parameter of trap states, since its value is closely related to the recombination mechanism. In detail, when α = 1, it means recombination directly occurs between the free charge carriers from band to band; on the other hand, if α < 1, it implies that the intra-gap trap states are involved in charge recombination. For simplification, these two situations will be respectively termed as trap-free and trap-limited recombination hereinafter. Based on the fitting results (Fig. 2(a)), the values of α were extracted and are 0.5 for PA decay and PB1 recovery but 1.0 for PB2 recovery, indicating that PA and PB1 reflect a trap-limited recombination process while PB2 denotes a trap-free one. As mentioned above, PB2 is coupled with the direct recombination between free charge carriers populating the band edge,8,9 meeting the description of the trap-free recombination mechanism. Particularly, Manser and Kamat proved that this recombination process follows second-order kinetics,14 which coincides well with our results, because α = 1.0 results in an equation of dn/dt = −γn2 (γ stands for the coefficient of bimolecular recombination, see Section S3 of ESI†). On the other hand, PA and PB1 result from the excited electrons that either populate the conduction band or are in trap states, hence the kinetics of the PA decay and PB1 recovery reflect the statistical result of charge recombination dynamics whether recombination takes place via trap states (trap-limited recombination) or through the band edge (trap-free recombination). From this point, as α = 0.5 for PA and PB1 kinetics this implies that most of the charges, statistically, recombine within the framework of the trap-limited, but not the trap-free, mechanism. To sum up, the landscape of the charge recombination in intrinsic perovskite film is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(b), which can be interpreted in detail as below. After charge carriers are photogenerated in the perovskite phase, most of the charges are trapped by intra-gap trap states, while the rest are populated in the band edge. The charge carriers captured by shallow trap states could sustain thermal equilibration with those in the band edge via reversible trapping–detrapping events. As a result, most of the charge recombination is mediated by the intra-gap trap states, while direct recombination between free electrons and holes is subordinate. In order to verify the aforementioned analysis, TA measurement was also performed at a low excitation intensity and the conclusion still holds (see Section S4 of ESI†). Here, it's noted that a pre-condition of the above discussion is that the distribution of the density-of-states (DOS) should be exponential, which will be discussed later. In addition, it's well known that charge recombination behavior in perovskite film is rather sensitive to the particular preparation method. Herein, the tested film is fabricated by a typical one-step method (see Section S1 of ESI†), and the scenario of charge recombination in the perovskite film made by other methods still needs to be investigated.

Now we check the recombination dynamics in complete meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells. Three cells with different HTM layer thicknesses were prepared with sequential methods. From the SEM images (Fig. 3(a)–(c)), it can be seen that among the target cells, the thickness of meso-porous TiO2 and perovskite films is comparable, while the HTM layers are about 130 nm, 390 nm and 650 nm respectively. As a consequence, the photovoltaic performances are significantly distinct, as revealed by current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 3(d) and Table 1). The cell with the 390 nm HTM layer (cell-2) exhibits the highest PCE (9.6%), while the cells with the thinnest (130 nm, cell-1) or thickest (650 nm, cell-3) HTM layers show inferior PCEs (4.8% and 3.8%).

By means of TRCE, the temporal evolutions of the charge amount (Q) in these solar cells under open-circuit were recorded as shown in Fig. 4(a), where all the Q–t plots present a non-exponential decay in the detection windows. It's noted that the detection windows were different among the three target samples, for instance, the window is 1–103 ms for cell-2 but 10−2–102 ms for cell-3. That's because the kinetics of the rise in the photovoltage is distinct for these cells (see Fig. S2 of ESI†). In TRCE measurement, the timing for the charge extraction is set to be after the photovoltage reaches its maximum to ensure Fermi-level equilibration.33–35 The times for the rising photovoltages to reach peak values are 0.05 ms, 2 ms and 0.002 ms, respectively, for cell-1, cell-2 and cell-3 (see Fig. S2 of ESI†), hence the shortest timings of charge extraction for the corresponding samples are set to be 0.053 ms, 2.1 ms and 0.005 ms.

Note that the charge amount in cell-3 has been multiplied by 10. (c) Schematic illustration of charge recombination in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cell. 
Similar to the TA results, considering that Q is proportional to n, the Q–t relations exhibit analogous kinetics which are also well fitted by the function of n(t) = n0 × (1 + at)−α. Importantly, the values of α are extracted from the fitting results, which are 0.5 for cell-1, 0.2 for cell-2 and 0.3 for cell-3. The different α values among the target samples imply that the distribution of DOS is distinct among these three solar cells. Combining the results discussed above, one can draw conclusions as follows: firstly, α < 1 is held for all of the cells, indicating that charge recombination obeys the trap-limited mechanism in complete meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells; secondly, the distinct recombination rate arising from the cells with different HTM thicknesses implies that the perovskite/HTM interface plays a substantial role in charge recombination in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells; thirdly, the variation of α reveals that the DOS distribution is sensitive to the HTM thickness. The modification effect of HTM on DOS is presumably realized by the infiltration of HTM into the boundary between perovskite crystals, just like the effect of the fullerene layer in inverted perovskite solar cells.36 It's worthwhile to note that, as mentioned above, the pre-condition for deriving the formula n(t) = n0 × (1 + at)−α is that the DOS distribution should be exponential. To check this, we measured the Q–V relations using TRCE (Fig. 4(b)) which show that the charge amount increases exponentially with voltage. Considering that DOS is proportional to the chemical capacitance (Cμ), which is defined by Cμ = dQ/dV, the exponential distribution of DOS is proven by the exponential increase of Q upon V.35 Meanwhile, the amount of accumulated charge is highest in cell-3 while it is lowest in cell-2 (Fig. 4(b)), indicating that the former possesses the largest DOS for trap states while the latter possesses the smallest. Combining Fig. 3(d) and 4(b), one can clearly see that the cell with a low DOS exhibits a high PCE and FF. That's because trap states act as recombination centers in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, in accordance with the trap-limited recombination theory, which accelerates interfacial charge recombination and reduces the FF and PCE. From the above, the details of charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface were summarized and are illustrated in Fig. 4(c), which could be described as follows. After the photogeneration of charge carriers in the perovskite phase, the holes were rapidly injected into the HTM leaving the electrons in the perovskite. Undergoing multiple-trap events among conduction bands and trap states, the electrons diffuse to the perovskite/HTM interface and recombine with holes via trap states, which exhibit a trap-limited recombination behavior. It should be noted that the trap states in perovskite include the electron ones under the conduction band and the hole ones above the valence band, which are not distinguished in this paper. In future work, it's important to conduct more specific measurements to quantitatively study the distribution of the electron and hole trap states respectively, which will be helpful to get deeper insights into the trap-limited charge recombination in perovskite solar cells.
TA and TRCE results show that charge recombination is mediated by trap states, respectively, in the case of the intrinsic perovskite film and meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells, however, the investigated recombination processes behind the analogous dynamics behaviors are rather distinct. In perovskite film, charge recombination takes places in the perovskite phase (in the bulk or at the surface) which shows ultrafast dynamics within a sub-nanosecond. On the other hand, in the case of complete perovskite solar cells, we focused on the recombination occurring at the perovskite/HTM interface, which is relatively slower (from a sub-millisecond to a second) and mediated by the surface trap states of perovskite. The modification of HTM on DOS implies that these trap states of perovskite could be effectively passivated by optimizing the preparation of the HTM layer.
In conclusion, we have respectively studied the charge recombination dynamics in intrinsic MAPbI3 film and in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells by means of TA and TRCE measurements. Both trap-free and trap-limited recombination processes are identified from the TA spectra in the perovskite film, while most of the charge carriers recombine via the trap-limited pathway, which elucidates the significant effect of trap states, in intrinsic perovskite, on the dynamics of charge recombination. In the case of complete solar cells, charge recombination obeys the trap-limited mechanism and the dynamics is mediated by the distribution of surface trap states. The HTM layer exhibits a prominent effect on the modification of the DOS distribution, which is closely related to the apparent recombination behavior. Lastly, the relevance between DOS and the photovoltaic performance is revealed, that is, a cell with a low DOS results in a slow charge recombination and high PCE. This work is helpful for understanding the initial charge recombination in perovskite and the interfacial recombination in complete meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells. Passivating the trap states in perovskite is pointed out to be a vital strategy to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency, which could be realized by optimizing the preparation condition of the HTM layer.

The intensity of the excitation light is 140 μJ per cm2 per pulse. (b) Generation kinetics of PB1 (black), PB2 (red) and PA (blue) extracted from the TA spectra. To see the kinetics clearly, the amplitudes of PB1 and PA have been respectively multiplied by 15 and 2.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Kinetics of PB1 (black) and PB2 (red) recoveries and PA decay (blue). The thin curves are experimental data while the thick curves denote the fitting results based on the trap-free or trap-limited recombination models (see text for details). Note that the amplitude of PB1 and PA has been respectively multiplied by 15 and 4.5. (b) Schematic illustration of charge recombination in intrinsic perovskite film.	 

 	Fig. 3  The cross-sectional SEM images of meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells with different HTM layer thicknesses (a–c) and the corresponding J–V characteristics (d).	 


Cell-1	12.6	0.80	0.48	4.8
Cell-2	20.0	0.91	0.53	9.6
Cell-3	12.7	0.78	0.38	3.8

 	Fig. 4  (a) Temporal evolution of charge amount in cell-1 (black), cell-2 (blue) and cell-3 (red) under open-circuit. The color curves indicate the fitting result based on the model of trap-limited recombination. Note that the charge amount in cell-3 has been multiplied by 10. (b) Charge amount versus voltage in perovskite solar cells (color scatters) and the exponential fitting results (solid lines). The data-to-sample correspondence is same as that in panel (a). Note that the charge amount in cell-3 has been multiplied by 10. (c) Schematic illustration of charge recombination in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cell.
