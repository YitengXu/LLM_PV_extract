    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 19th December 2018AbstractDefects and related trap sites are generated inevitably at grain boundaries (GBs) and on surfaces of solution-processed polycrystalline perovskite films. Seeking a suitable passivation material using facile and efficient methods to passivate the perovskite film for minimum defect density is necessary to further improve the photovoltaic performance. Here, we introduce a novel potassium-intercalated rubrene (K2Rubrene) with facile anti-solvent engineering to obtain high quality perovskite films through a novel dual-functional perovskite passivation approach. It was found that the cation–π interaction between aromatic rubrene and organic cations can immobilize the organic cations in perovskite, which can trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film to decrease the grain size and obtain a more homogeneous and uniform perovskite film. The potassium insertion in the K2Rubrene molecule, more importantly, could balance the cation–π interaction energy that occurred between the aromatic additive and the organic cations in perovskite films to reduce the barrier for better carrier transfer at GBs. Moreover, K+ could freely enter the A-site defects at the surface of the perovskite absorber and then digest the A-site shallow defects to prevent the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations at the interface between the hole transfer layer and the perovskite absorber, or perovskite/perovskite GBs. Consequently, a significant upshift of the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum of the perovskite material leads to a more favorable energy alignment with the hole transporting material, which can enhance hole-transfer and suppress the hysteresis, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell device achieves a high efficiency of over 19%, higher than that of pristine and rubrene based devices.
Introduction
Recently, in milestone works in materials and device configuration, such as the first embodiment use of hybrid organo-metal halide perovskite in a liquid electrolyte device configuration, the perovskite quantum-dot coating protocol in an electrolyte-based sensitizer configuration,1 the solid-state sensitized configuration,2,3 a mesoporous alumina scaffold in a planar heterojunction configuration4 and with various passivation approaches, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exhibited externally verified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 23%, outclassing 3.8% in 2009.5,6 It is apparent that this astounding progress is related to the many advances in rational engineering that manipulate the perovskite morphology and optimize the interfacial nature and function.7 The film morphologies of the perovskite photoactive layer, including grain boundaries (GBs), grain size and distribution, surface coverage, and crystal orientation, play crucial roles in the performance of the completed devices. Electronic trap states are typically determined by the GBs, and are tunable based on the material composition and processing conditions. These traps can enhance non-radiative recombination and seriously reduce charge carrier lifetime and photoluminescence (PL) yield. To obtain high quality perovskite films with full coverage and fewer GBs, many approaches, such as one-step spin-coating,3,8,9 sequential deposition,10–12 co-evaporation,4,13–15 the vapor assisted solution process,16–18,19 and additive or solvent annealing engineering,20–27 have been adopted to reduce the electronic trap states in the perovskite photoactive layer. One-step spin coating is the most commonly used method to convert precursor into high quality perovskite crystalline film through solvent evaporation in the laboratory. However, it is very hard to control the nucleation and growth of the perovskite crystal during the process because of the fast solvent evaporation or rapid reaction between the lead source (for example, PbI2) and the halogenated amine (for example, CH3NH3I). Consequently, many pinholes or GBs will form within the final perovskite film and lead to low coverage with a poor morphology perovskite photoactive layer.22
It has been reported that control of the nucleation and growth can improve the morphology of the perovskite photoactive layer during the process of the perovskite crystal formation for the high PCE of PSCs.20,21,28,29 Another important strategy to improve the efficiency of these PSC devices is minimizing the charge recombination by passivating the dangling bonds at surfaces and GBs. Metal ion and organic additive doping are two main passivation techniques used in the field of PSCs.20,21,28,30–33 The incorporation of metal ions can modulate the perovskite crystallization process and therefore the film morphology. Snaith and co-workers have found that a small quantity of Al3+ doping can enhance the PCE and reduce the hysteresis, and recently, Stranks and co-workers showed that potassium doping can effectively passivate perovskite defects, reducing non-radiative recombination loss and thus achieve high performance PSCs.34–36
The organic additives, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1,8-diiodooctane, methylammonium acetate and thiosemicarbazide,23–26,37 have been widely used to form intermediate adducts with Pb2+ to slow down the crystal growth, suggesting that this could passivate the surface recombination sites with undercoordinated Pb sites by a typical Lewis base to minimize the number of defects.20,21,28,29 However, these postgrowth treatments are challenging in terms of yielding reproducible results due to the uneven dispersion of the organic additive in the perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, some pristine organic semiconducting molecules have an intrinsically low carrier-mobility and -conductivity. Although the addition of functionalized dopants, such as lithium salt,38,39 copper salts,40 carbon nanotubes41 and some p-type additives,42 into organic semiconducting molecule solutions can enhance conductivity, these additives suffer from aggregation problems with respect to achieving reliable electrical conductivity enhancement.43
Another way to obtain high quality perovskite is rapid nucleation.20,21,28 It has been confirmed that the anti-solvent method can induce rapid nucleation to suppress molecule/additive aggregation and effectively triggers homogeneous nucleation at the surface of the formed layer. This then forms typical Lewis base intermediate adducts with undercoordinated Pb to passivate the defects at the interfaces, surfaces or GBs within the final perovskite film.20,21 Using this technique, Li et al. have found that the cation–π interaction between aromatic rubrene and organic cations is strong enough to immobilize the organic cations in perovskite, leading to the reduction of defects in perovskite films, and they achieved outstanding stability in devices.44 Here, we introduce potassium-intercalated rubrene (K2Rubrene) material as a template agent to control nucleation. Meanwhile, K2Rubrene can suppress aggregation, and the K+ cations can efficiently passivate the perovskite interface traps, which is also beneficial for improving the hole-extraction and hole-transporting capability of the hole-transporting layer (HTL). Compared to common organic fullerene derivatives, K2Rubrene salts are sparingly soluble in chlorobenzene, satisfying the precondition of being passivation materials. Based on the mixed ternary cation perovskite (CsI)0.04(FAI)0.82(PbI2)0.86(MAPbBr3)0.14 (Cs = cesium, MA = methylammonium, CH3NH3, and FA = formamidinium, CH3(NH2)2) system, the PSC devices based on K2Rubrene delivered an average PCE of 18.56%, which is higher than that of the control device (17.82%), and the device employing rubrene as an additive in anti-solvent CB (16.43%). These results represent a new simple approach for new passivation material design for the improvement of the properties of PSC devices.
Experimental
Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω sq−1 were supplied from Asahi Glass (Japan). Methylammonium bromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Dyesol. Lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99%), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Tin(II) chloride dehydrate (SnCl2·2H2O), thiourea, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile, K chunks (99.99%), rubrene powder (sublimed grade, 99.9%) and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.8%) was purchased from TCI while spiro-MeOTAD [2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9-spirobifluorene] (99.5%) was purchased from Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd Luminescence Technology Corp. All chemicals were used as received.
Device fabrication
K chunks and rubrene powder were stored and handled in an argon-filled glove box (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm), then transferred to a Pyrex ampoule at a molar ratio of 2:1. After being sealed under vacuum (<10−4 mbar), reactions were performed at 210 °C with a heating rate of 1°C min−1 and a dwelling time of 3 days. The products were then reground and re-pelletized for another 3 day reaction at the same temperatures to yield the final product K2Rubrene.
The PSCs were prepared on FTO substrates which were cleaned in detergent and then successively sonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol solution, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C. Prior to the deposition of electron transport layers (ETLs), FTO substrates were exposed to UV–ozone for 20 min. A SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) film was prepared according to the report of Fang et al.45 Perovskite photoactive layers were deposited on the ETLs by an anti-solvent method, as described in the literature.20–22 The (CsI)0.04(FAI)0.82(PbI2)0.86(MAPbBr3)0.14 and MAPbI3 precursor solutions were prepared in a glove box from 1.35 M Pb2+ in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 v/v). The dissolved solution was then spin-coated on the FTO/SnO2 QD ETLs substrate at 4500 rpm for 30 s in a glove box; note that 150 μL K2Rubrene and rubrene chlorobenzene solution of 1 mM concentrations were pipetted onto the spinning film 15 s before the end of this program. Thereafter, the as-cast perovskite films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes. After cooling down to room temperature, spiro-OMeTAD solution (75 mg dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene) with 29 μL of TBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s in a glove box. Finally, gold was deposited by thermal evaporation on top of the spiro-OMeTAD layer to complete the device, using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes. The active area of the cells was 0.09 cm2, which was defined by the area of the Au electrode.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a B1500 A semiconductor parameter analyzer under an AAA class ORIEL Sol3A solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 filter, the light intensity was set at 100 mW cm−2 using a calibrated standard monocrystalline Si reference cell from Newport traceable to NREL. The hole-only devices with the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/K2Rubrene (or rubrene)/Au structure were measured under dark ambient conditions. Scanning was carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The scans started and finished under forward bias and had 2 seconds stabilization time at forward bias under illumination prior to scanning. The corresponding incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured in air by a QE-R 3011 system from Enli Technology Co. Ltd. (Enli).
UV-visible spectroscopy was performed using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-2550 Shimadzu) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a reflectance (ATR) instrument (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100, USA) from 4000 to 800 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies of PSCs were investigated by a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM7100F). Based on the tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker NanoScope MultiMode 8) system, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) simultaneously measures contact potential difference (CPD) between the probe (Nanosensor PPP-EFM) and the surface of a perovskite sample by constantly probing. For our EFM measurements, a two-pass technique with phase mode was employed. The first pass was used to acquire the topographic height, and then the conductive probe was lifted with respect to the specimen surface with a constant separation, approximately 10 nm here, and scanned to acquire the potential offset between the tip and the sample. The first resonant oscillation of the cantilever (52.590 kHz) was used for the non-contact AFM topographic imaging. The second resonant frequency (60 kHz) was used for the potential imaging. We chose a scan rate of 0.977 Hz and a DC bias of 1 V applied to the conductive probe. The sample was fixed in a custom-made vertical sample holder with electrical connections to both electrodes. For photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements, the perovskite film was deposited on quartz substrate and then immersed into FC-72. A monochromatic light beam was modulated at 13 Hz by a mechanical chopper and was shone onto the sample. A laser was at the perpendicular side so that it was deflected periodically. A position detector, connected with a lock-in amplifier, was placed on the other side so that the deflection signal was measured. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) signals of perovskite film were recorded using the Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrophotometer equipped with a 485 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser as the excitation source.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of the metal–organic complexing compound K2Rubrene took place under inert ambient conditions with potassium chunks and rubrene powder as raw materials. K2Rubrene shows a monoclinic structure (Fig. 1a), and the detailed crystal structure will be published elsewhere. The K2Rubrene crystal structure is different from that of rubrene with an orthorhombic symmetry (space group: Cmca (65)) of a = 26.860 (10), b = 7.193 (3), and c = 14.433 (5) Å (Fig. S1†).46 The FTIR spectra are shown as lines in Fig. 1b. For rubrene, the peaks at 1622, 1596, 1574, 1494, 1464, 1439, 1411, and 1392 cm−1 can be assigned to the skeletal vibration of the ring. In the low-frequency region, the peaks that are assigned to out-of-plane CH vibrations centered at 1309, 1270, 1214, 1171, 1152, 1128, 1107, 1067, 1026, 1001, 968, 910, and 848 cm−1 and those that arise from the CH out-of-plane bending bands in the interval from 800 to 440 cm−1 (absorption bands centered at 789, 767, 753, 733, 718, 694, 626, 614, 600, 583, 560, 545, 530, 509, 485, 464, and 444 cm−1) are observed.47 With the intercalation of potassium to form K2Rubrene, the positions of the FTIR peaks change considerably. The ring skeletal vibration peaks arise at 1609, 1589, 1570, 1486, 1464, 1435, 1408, and 1373 cm−1, which have shifted towards a low wave number, compared to rubrene. Most of the CH vibration peaks at 1312, 1276, 1205, 1175, 1146, 1134, 1110, 1067, 1026, 997, 975, 907, and 832 cm−1 shift towards a high wave number. However, most of the CH bending vibration peaks at 789, 767, 754, 738, 711, 692, 626, 608, 600, 574, 560, 545, 530, 509, 480, 455, and 444 cm−1 have no shift. These changes could be due to the twist of fusion rings induced by potassium intercalation. In particular, several new peaks (1544, 1522, 1355, 1089, 1039, 940, 892, 874, and 516 cm−1) suggest the successful intercalation of potassium into rubrene. In K2Rubrene, the reorientation of rubrene molecules creates extra voids to accommodate potassium cations.48

(d) J1/2–V characteristics for SCLC hole-only mobility. 
At room temperature, rubrene has a high field-induced hole-mobility of up to 20 cm2 V−1 s−1.49,50 Its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are 5.4 and 3.0 eV, respectively.51 Recently, it has been reported that some potassium-intercalated polyaromatic hydrocarbons show metallic conductivity.52,53 Therefore, potassium intercalation can change the hole conductivity of rubrene, and thus benefit hole-transport and -collection in PSCs.
The hole mobility values are measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. We have fabricated hole-only devices (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/K2Rubrene (or rubrene)/Au) to measure the hole trap-state density in antisolvent dopants. Fig. 1c shows the double-logarithmic plot of dark J–V curves of the devices based on K2Rubrene and rubrene. The linear J–V characteristics (blue) at low bias voltage indicate an ohmic response of the hole-only device. The super-linear J–V behavior at high bias voltage is the so-called SCLC where the electrode injects more carrier than the material can transport, which can result in a net carrier distribution in the material.54 The current–voltage curves of the hole-only devices are well fitted by the Mott–Gurney law (the blue and olive lines in Fig. 1c). Both the wider voltage range of the ohmic response (at low bias voltage) and the smaller magnitude of the slope (at high bias voltage) from the fitted curve show the material's superior carrier transfer ability. Compared to the rubrene-based hole-only device, the K2Rubrene based hole-only device has a bigger voltage range for the ohmic response and a smaller slope (Fig. 1c), which infers that potassium-intercalated rubrene has superior hole transferring properties to rubrene.
The hole mobility from the hole-only devices can be extracted from the dark current density–voltage curve (Fig. 1d), and is calculated by the trap free SCLC model ( where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant, μ is the mobility of the charge carrier, V is the effective applied voltage, and L is the thickness of the function layer) at higher reverse applied voltage. K2Rubrene shows a hole mobility of 4.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, larger than that of rubrene (1.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher mobility is probably caused by the K+–π interactions in the intercalated rubrene.
With K2Rubrene and rubrene additives dissolved in CB anti-solvent for high quality perovskite films, PSCs with the structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/SnO2 QD (30 nm)/perovskite (600 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD (120 nm)/Au (130 nm) were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. S2.† Following optimization, the concentration of 1.0 mM K2Rubrene in the anti-solvent CB produces the optimal performance result for the PSCs (Fig. S3†). The parameters of the corresponding devices derived from the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curves (Fig. 2b) are summarized in Table 1.

The control device has a reverse scan PCE of 17.82%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of 1.10 V, 21.59 mA cm−2, and 75.0%, respectively, as shown in Table 1. With rubrene dissolved in anti-solvent CB, the PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF decrease to 16.43%, 21.56 mA cm−2, 1.08 V and 70.6%, respectively. For the K2Rubrene-based device, the corresponding PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF undergo improvement to 18.56%, 1.12 V, 21.85 mA cm−2, and 75.4%, respectively. The champion K2Rubrene-containing PSC has a PCE of up to 19.09% (Fig. S4†). The JSC of the control device is bigger than that of the rubrene-based device, but smaller than that of the K2Rubrene-based device, which is confirmed by the results of the corresponding incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurement (Fig. 2c). After illuminating under 1 sun for 200 s, the control device shows a 17.52% stable PCE with a little fluctuation. The rubrene-based device presents the same steady state output with a smaller stable PCE of 15.77%. For the K2Rubrene-based device, its stable PCE is over 18%, and presents a firstly decreasing and then increasing trend (Fig. 2d). Measurements on a single J–V loop of the control and rubrene-treated devices obviously exhibit a commonly observed hysteresis behavior, with a large hysteresis index (HI = (PCERev − PCEFw)/PCERev) of 0.237 and 0.225, respectively. For the K2Rubrene-based device, however, the hysteresis behavior is far less, with a HI of only 0.023, that is, over an order less than the other two cases. The tests are under the same testing requirements with a voltage step of 0.02 V and delay time of 50 ms at a pre-biased 1.2 V for 1 s (Fig. 2b) and show good reproducibility (Fig. 2e).
To investigate the performance difference of the PSCs, we first measured the absorption of the three types of perovskite film. With rubrene and K2Rubrene treatment under the same preparation process, the perovskite films exhibited decreased absorption compared with that of the pristine perovskite film in the wavelength range of 500–680 nm (Fig. S5†). Therefore, the greater JSC of the K2Rubrene-based device is not due to more photon absorption, but could be attributed to the intercalation of potassium into rubrene, which can enhance the ability of K2Rubrene to improve hole-transferring or -collecting.
FTIR spectra measured the change of various organic groups with rubrene and K2Rubrene treatment, as shown in Fig. S6.† A strong stretching vibration of CN appears at 1711 cm−1, corresponding to the intrinsic characteristic peaks of organic cation FA+ groups of perovskites. The peaks at 1048 cm−1 and at 1616, 3160, 3272, 3332, 3358 and 3407 cm−1 are assigned to the C–N and N–H stretching vibration from FA+/MA+ groups, respectively. The absorption peaks at 1352 and 1472 cm−1 belong to the bending vibration of methyl (CH3) from the MA+ group. In the two treated perovskite films, no peaks from rubrene or K2Rubrene can be detected and there is no evident peak shift for organic groups, suggestive of very few additive materials to decorate the perovskite photoactive layer.
Top-view SEM images reveal stark differences in perovskite films with rubrene and K2Rubrene additives (Fig. 3a). The pristine film is well crystallized and is composed of many relatively large (approximately 500 nm) crystals filled with approximately 150 nm small crystals (Fig. 3a (I)). With rubrene and K2Rubrene additives, the crystal grain size decreases substantially and subtly without pinholes, and the surfaces do not appear as glossy as the pristine film (Fig. 3a (II and III)). This implies that rubrene and K2Rubrene could hinder the diffusivity of the perovskite precursor and have a crucial impact on nucleation over the perovskite precursor film during the solvent drying stage. Interestingly, the distribution of grain size induced by K2Rubrene is more homogeneous and uniform than that induced by rubrene. Thus, potassium ions can play a part in the formation of the perovskite film.

To further scrutinize the uniformity of the treated perovskite film, we carried out phase mode EFM measurement to simultaneously assess the surface topography and the amplitude of perovskite film between the tip and the sample (Fig. 3b–d). The amplitude corresponds to the electrostatic force field, which is proportional to the surface CPD between GBs and inner grains in perovskite films.55 This measurement can help to reveal the relationship between traps and carrier transfer around the GBs with foreign body doping.28 The EFM topographies show that the apparent grain size is consistent with that shown in the SEM images (Fig. 3a), and the roughness is reduced from 15.9 to 12.9 nm and 11.3 nm in rubrene- and K2Rubrene-treated perovskite films, respectively (Fig. 3b). Rubrene and K2Rubrene can obviously control nucleation and slow down crystal growth to obtain uniform perovskite films, and they mainly accumulate at GBs. EFM measurement is conducted under dark ambient conditions to avoid excess charges. The CPD should be constant across the film surface and correspond to the work function difference between the tip and FTO substrates.56 Thus, any change in amplitude indicates the presence of an internal field inside the device. In Fig. 3b, some dark areas are present in topography images at GBs, but the corresponding area is bright in amplitude images (Fig. 3c). In particular, there are obvious differences in the areas marked with a dashed circle. This could be due to the built-in potential resulting from the interstitials and vacancies at the GBs.56–59 Moreover, the polarity at GBs can be different from that inside grains, leading to different CPD values.28 Although the individual grains are clearly distinguishable in morphology and amplitude images, the shapes are not identical. In rubrene and K2Rubrene treated perovskite films, the difference becomes more evident, likely due to the lower built-in potential around charged GBs induced by changed carrier distribution resulting from the cation–π interaction between the aromatic additive and the organic cations. Under a bias voltage, these organic additives of high carrier-mobility/conductivity change the electrostatic force field distribution of the surface of perovskite. Stranks and coworkers have reported that potassium selectively depletes bromide from the perovskite crystal structure at the GBs and surfaces.35 Some interface traps, such as the dangling bonds and vacancies, could be “digested” by potassium cations, and smooth the surface of perovskite film further and redistribute the electrostatic force field. This could result in a minimized recombination for better carrier transfer at GBs.
To estimate charge collection efficiency, the corresponding PL spectra were measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. All perovskite films display an emission peak at 778 nm. The quenched PL spectra in treated films indicate the existence of a “bulk organic molecular layer”. As we know, the PL intensity and carrier life time will be increased with the light scattering effect of better-quality (pinhole-free and dense) perovskite film. Moreover, the “bulk organic molecular layer” could form cation–π interactions with the adjacent organic cations of perovskites at the rubrene (or K2Rubrene)/perovskite-photoactive-layer interface or GBs, which could immobilize the organic cations of perovskite and thus passivate the defects on the surface (or GBs) of the perovskite layer, leading to better carrier transfer in the perovskite layer.44 The K2Rubrene-treated film exhibits a smaller PL spectrum intensity than the rubrene treated film, suggesting the superior passivation function of K intercalation to effectively improve the hole transfer. To better understand the enhanced performance seen with rubrene and K2Rubrene treatment, we further employed time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL) to measure the carrier lifetime (shown in Fig. 4b). All curves were fitted by the two-component exponential decay model, according to previous reports.60,61 The fast decay PL species (τ1) can be attributed to quenching via trap states or interfacial charge transfer, and the longer PL species (τ2) is attributed to free carrier recombination via the light emission.61 In the pristine film, the fast decay PL species (τ1) and the longer PL species (τ2) are 3.0 (76.7%) and 94 (23.3%) ns, respectively (Table 2). In rubrene-treated film, the fast decay PL species τ1 is the dominant characteristic and its fraction (τ1) increases immediately from 76.7 to 89.4%, which is attributed to the construction of more cation–π interactions through the perovskite and rubrene interfaces. The decreased τ1 indicates that rubrene treatment could passivate the surface defects of perovskite, which suggests rapid hole-transferring from perovskite to rubrene. In pure perovskite film, the slower τ2 is related to a better carrier lifetime in the film. In the rubrene treated perovskite film, although the τ2 component decreases with rubrene treatment, the decrease of τ2 from 94 ns in neat perovskite film to 70 ns may indicate that rubrene has a full role to play in hole-collecting and provides more pathways for hole transfer from perovskite to rubrene due to the formation of cation–π interactions at the larger interfaces.62,63 In the K2Rubrene-treated film, the lifetimes of the fast and slower decay PL species decrease further. The fraction of fast species (τ1) increases further to 99.9%, which could be attributed to the synergy of the cation–π interactions between perovskite and rubrene and the complex interaction between potassium cations and perovskite (Fig. 4c).

Thus, K2Rubrene can passivate the defects in the perovskite layer more effectively, enable fast hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the anode, and effectively suppress the recombination at the Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite interface, accounting for the increase in the VOC, JSC, and the decreased hysteresis.
The star-marked XRD peaks are characteristic of a trigonal (space group: P3m1 (156)) perovskite phase (Fig. S7†).64,65 The peak at 12.5° is from PbI2 in the perovskite film. With rubrene and K2Rubrene additives, the PbI2 peak intensity decreases, indicating a smaller density of defects and the more stable crystal frameworks of the perovskites. The K2Rubrene-treated film shows the smallest PbI2 peak intensity among the three sample types, demonstrating that K+ can prevent the degeneration of perovskite film by passivating the dangling bonds at the surface/interface or GBs within the perovskite film, because K+ energetically prefers the interstitial site.66
PDS measurements were conducted to probe the effect of potassium cation incorporation and interaction with rubrene on the perovskite films, as presented in Fig. 4d. According to the direct transition type Tauc-plot,67 the three perovskite film samples have the same band gap of approximately 1.58 eV, which is in excellent agreement with previous reports.28 The Urbach energy can be used to identify the shallow traps, and its magnitude represents a figure-of-merit for the film. A small Urbach energy stipulates a lower density of shallow traps,68,69 and results in little non-radiative recombination at the interface contacts or GBs of the bulk perovskite semiconductor. The Urbach energy increased from 23.4 meV for the pristine perovskite sample to 24.1 meV in rubrene-treated films, and decreased to 23.3 meV in K2Rubrene-treated films, suggesting that K2Rubrene treatment can lead to the substantial passivation of sub-bandgap states compared to rubrene treatment.
It has been reported that the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations in the vicinity of the lattice grid can be inclined to generate the A-site defects, which play vital functions with respect to the hybrid perovskite's electric structures as well as the device performance.70 Any halide vacancies at GBs could result in halide migration and additional non-radiative decay.35 Park et al. have declared that K+ is able to prevent the formation of a Frenkel defect because K+ energetically prefers the interstitial site.66 Such a low level of energetic disorder indicates that the potassium insertion to afford K2Rubrene could “digest” the shallow traps to prevent the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations (or the migration of halide) at the interface between the HTL and the perovskite absorber, or perovskite/perovskite GBs (Fig. 4c), thereby suppressing any additional non-radiative decay and enhancing the carrier lifetime.35,71
Unfortunately, the treatment with K2Rubrene and rubrene increases the deep trap density between 0.7 and 1.5 eV on the surface of the perovskite film. Theoretical calculations show a chelation-like interaction between MA+ cations and rubrene: two N–H bonds in MA+ toward rubrene hook the central tetracene and the pending phenyl group through  rubrene interactions.44 These different interaction energies demonstrate that the different interaction strengths could lead to disorder on the surface of the perovskite film. Moreover, rubrene could not be perfectly compatible with the perovskite structure due to its supramolecular structure, although these aromatic organics can immobilize the organic cations on the surface of perovskite. Thus, the K2Rubrene-treated perovskite sample shows a much higher density of deep-traps than the pristine perovskite sample. K+ could freely enter the A-site defects at the surface of the perovskite absorber to prevent the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations or the migration of halide. More importantly, K+ insertion could balance the cation–π interaction between the aromatic additive and the organic cations in perovskite films to reduce the barrier for better carrier transfer at GBs. Consequently, a significant rise in the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite material will lead to a more favorable energy alignment with the hole transporting material at the interface between the HTL and the perovskite photoactive layer72 (Fig. 5a and b), which can suppress the hysteresis for better PSC properties.

Tress et al. believe that the slow process, including ion migration and changing dipole charge at interfaces, is the origin of the hysteresis.73 The lower the charge carrier mobility and extraction rates, the more prone the device is to exhibiting hysteresis. Although rubrene has a high field-induced hole-mobility,49,50 a notorious normal hysteresis index indicates that the worse passivation compatibility of rubrene at the interface between the spiro-OMeTAD and the perovskite absorber (or at perovskite/perovskite GBs74,75) could result in disequilibrium for the mobility of electrons and holes during the work/testing of devices with rubrene-treated perovskite. Thus, the ionic charges could accumulate at the cathode interface to present greater normal hysteresis behavior for PSC devices. With K2Rubrene treatment, the upward valence band maximum could level up the barriers at the interface between perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 5b), which could increase hole-mobility to reduce charge accumulation at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the defects, such as dangling bonds and vacancies, are passivated to improve the crystal quality of the perovskite film.
Conclusions
In summary, we introduce a facile anti-solvent engineering method to obtain high quality perovskite film for high efficiency devices with rubrene and K2Rubrene passivation. It was found that rubrene-based organics can immobilize the organic cations in perovskite by cation–π interactions between aromatic rubrene and organic cations. This interaction can trigger heterogeneous nucleation over the perovskite precursor film and lead to smaller grain size and a more homogeneous and uniform perovskite film. The potassium insertion in K2Rubrene could balance the cation–π interactions between the aromatic additive and the organic cations in perovskite films to reduce the barrier for better carrier transfer at GBs. K+ could also freely enter the A-site defects at the surface of the perovskite absorber and then digest the A-site shallow defects to prevent the migration and autorotation of the large organic cations (or the migration of halide) at the interface between the HTL and the perovskite absorber, or perovskite/perovskite GBs. Consequently, a significant upshift of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the perovskite material leads to a more favorable energy alignment with the hole transporting material, enhances the hole-transfer and suppresses the hysteresis. The PSCs with the K2Rubrene treatment yield a high efficiency of over 19%, which is significantly larger than that of the pristine and rubrene based devices. This work demonstrates a promising passivation material concept for perovskite solar cells.
