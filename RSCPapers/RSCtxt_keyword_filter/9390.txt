    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractThe main-chain planar configuration is a popular design principle for nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), while the too flat backbones enable NFAs suffer from intense aggregations and form large crystalline domains, which will result in poor device efficiency and inferior stability. This effect is reflected particularly serious in near-infrared NFAs. To relieve the negative impact of the inherent nature, an efficient ternary strategy, which introducing hydrogen-bond between the third component and NFA, is utilized to modulate the crystallization and packing properties of the acceptors. Here, IEICO-4F is chosen as a typical NFA for its nearly planar main-chain structure. A high efficiency of 13.53% with a decent fill factor (FF) of 71.36% are recorded in PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:DIBC containing ternary organic solar cells (OSCs), which is superior to the binary OSC (efficiency of 11.71%, FF of 65.29%). It is noteworthy that after 90 days of storage in ambient condition, the efficiency also maintains at 85.02% of the primitive state, while that of the binary device falls to 44.38%. Film morphology and charge dynamics analysises demonstrate that the high performance of the ternary OSC originates from the hydrogen-bond optimized molecular crystallization, stacking and distribution. Furthermore, similar conclusions can be obtained in another NFA system PBDB-TF:Y6 to yield a champion efficiency of 16.41%. These results prove that intermolecular hydrogen-bond strategy is an effective and convenient approach to optimize the micromorphology of NFAs and fabricate high performance NFA OSCs.
Introduction
As a new green alternative energy source, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted extensive research attention, owning to NFAs' tunable absorption spectra, variable electronic structure and easily adjusted crystallization behavior as contrasted to fullerene acceptors.1–5 Up to now, the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFAs based OSCs have exceeded 16% via well selecting conjugated polymer donors and aromatic fused rings containing small molecule NFAs, both in single-junction or tandem OSCs.6–8 Take a panoramic view of the NFAs development, most of popular small molecule NFAs followe the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type main-chain planar configuration design principle, in which the middle part of main-chain planar formed by an aromatic fused electron donor (D) and ended with two electron-withdrawing segment (A) on both sides.9–14 This is of significant importance for achieving efficient charge generation and dissociation. These novel NFA molecules not only possess complementary absorption range with most of wide-/middle-bandgap polymer donors but also own proper energy levels, therefore they can harvest photos more effectively to yield high PCEs. However, the aromatic fused ring section of NFAs always exhibit highly planar configuration, which enables the NFAs suffer from intense aggregation and form large crystalline domains in bulk-heterojunction films. The oversized aggregation and serious phase separation caused inferior miscibility, which is responsible for low exciton dissociation and charge transfer efficiencies and results in poor PCEs and low stability of OSCs.15,16 Especially for some near-infrared (NIR) NFAs: 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis-(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F), 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis-(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4Cl), etc., the halogenated electron-withdrawing group enhances the dipole moment of the molecule and extends conjugated-chain length, which gives rise to π-conjugating degree of the molecular main-chain. As a result, although NIR-NFAs based OSCs own a high short-circuit current (JSC) over 20 mA cm−2, or even reach 26 mA cm−2, their fill factor (FF) still maintained at a low level.17–23
To suppress the negative influence of main-chain planar structures on A–D–A NFAs, material modification strategy has been proposed in recent years, containing the adoption of various π-bridged section between D and A, introducing proper side chains on the out of plane direction of the main-chain and splicing twisted groups on the terminals of the molecule.24–27 For instance, X. Zhan and his co-works used a side-chain conjugation to tune the energy level, absorption extinction coefficient and charge transfer mobility of NFAs, and finally enhanced photovoltaic performance of OSCs.28 C. Yang's group gained a high PCE over 13% by changing the aromatic side-chain on the backbone to control the domain sizes and π–π stacking types of blended film.29 Nevertheless, materials design and synthesis require a considerable input costs and quite a long development period, there is still need efficient and low-cost approaches to develop high performance NFA-OSCs.
Here, we put forward a novel ternary strategy that introducing intermolecular hydrogen-bond between NFA and the third component to modulate the crystallization and stacking properties of acceptors. Poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diylalt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl) (PTB7-Th):IIEICO-4F was selected as the main research system, because IEICO-4F not only owns NIR absorption, but also possesses nearly planar configuration which would form over-strong aggregation and remarkable phase separation, especially blend with PTB7-Th in bulk heterojunction film. As a result, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F containing OSCs always show inferior efficiency and stability. This problem is well solved via introducing a commercially available small molecule 3-(diethylamino)-7-imino-7H-benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]chromeno[3,2-c]pyridine-6-carbonitrile (DIBC) into PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend. Here, DIBC has been added individually outside of the host system and acts as a nonvolatile additive in the ternary OSCs. Attributing the hydrogen-bond interaction between IEICO-4F and DIBC, the aggregation effect and stacking distance have been optimized within a reasonable range. The ternary OSCs obtain a maximum PCE of 13.53% with an improved JSC of 26.80 mA cm−2 and FF of 71.36%, which presents 15.54% enhancement than the control device (PCE of 11.71%, JSC of 25.68 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.29%). The improvement of FF mainly ascribed to the optimized domain sizes and stacking properties of the blended film. After adding 10% DIBC in PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, the ternary device shows excellent storage stability in ambient condition (room light, temperature (T) of 25 °C, Relative Humidity (RH) of 25%). After 90 days of storage, the efficiency of DIBC containing OSC still maintains at 85.02%, while the efficiency of the binary device reduces to 44.38%. The superior shelf-life of the ternary OSC is the result of intermolecular hydrogen-bond that regulate the material distribution of the film and enhance the miscibility of D and A molecules. Furthermore, this ternary strategy can be further developed in another well-known NIR NFA-OSC system (PBDB-TF:Y6),30 after carefully tuning the concentration of DIBC, a champion PCE of 16.41% has been obtained. These results demonstrate that intermolecular hydrogen-bond strategy is an efficient and convenient approach that can optimize the micromorphology of NFAs and develop high performance NFA OSCs.
Results and discussions
The Chemical structures of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and DIBC are shown in Fig. 1(a), IEICO-4F owns a nearly planar geometry with very small dihedral angle between donor and acceptor segments,31 therefore it is quite easy to aggregate during the process of film formation. Fig. 1(b) reveals the normalized absorption spectra of pure PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and DIBC films, respectively. The combination of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and DIBC can cover a wide absorption range from 400 to 1000 nm, suggesting that more photons can be harvested compared with the control film. Fig. 1(c) depicts the energy levels diagram of the used materials in the device. Most of the excitons will generate on the interface between PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F, DIBC mainly serves as an energy agent which transfers the absorbed energy to PTB7-Th via Förster resonance process.

Take notice of the chemical structure of DIBC and IEICO-4F, the small molecule DIBC owns an exposed imino group (–NH) in the side of its main chain, and the NFA molecule IEICO-4F possesses two fluorinated end groups 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC). It is well known that the imino group tends to form hydrogen-bond with the fluorine substituent with the model of N–H⋯F both in the solution and film. So we speculate that DIBC can form intermolecular hydrogen-bond with IEICO-4F via N–H⋯F as shown in Fig. 2(a), relevant geometric structure optimization which is calculated by density functional theory (DFT) is presented in Fig. 2(b) and (c). To demonstrate this, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are measured for DIBC, IEICO-4F, IEICO-4F:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC based films. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the peak located around 3300 cm−1 belongs to N–H group of DIBC, and the wave between 1200 cm−1 to 1400 cm−1 is ascribed to C–F group of IEICO-4F. Compared with the spectrum of pure DIBC containing film in Fig. 2(e), the N–H peaks of IEICO-4F:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC blended films shift to lower wave numbers along with reduced vibration strength, suggesting that hydrogen-bond is factually formed between DIBC and IEICO-4F. On the other hand, in contrast to the FT-IR spectrum of pure IEICO-4F based film in Fig. 2(f), the C–F peak of DIBC doped films drifts from 1302 cm−1 to 1297 cm−1 along with broadened waveform, which further prove that the hydrogen-bond is formed between imino group of DIBC and fluoride group of IEICO-4F.

Considering the molecular packing model of NFAs is always formed by electron deficient end-capping unit π–π interactions with adjacent acceptor molecules, we conclude that the addition of DIBC to NFAs can enlarge the π–π stacking distance and suppress oversize aggregation via the intermolecular hydrogen-bond interaction, just like the expression in Fig. 3. For demonstration, the impacts of intermolecular interaction on photo-physical properties of the blend films have been investigated as presented in Fig. 4, all films in absorption tests are maintained a similar film thickness. Fig. 4(a) reveals the absorption spectra of pure IEICO-4F and IEICO-4F:DIBC blended films, in which the concentration of IEICO-4F is constant. It is interesting that IEICO-4F:DIBC blended films show weaker absorption intensity and blue-shift phenomenon than that of the pure IEICO-4F containing film, which is caused by the formation of hydrogen-bond between DIBC and IEICO-4F that reduces the crystallization and aggregation of IEICO-4F in the film. Fig. 4(b) shows the absorption spectra of pure PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:20% DIBC containing films with consistent polymer contents. The absorption enhancement in the range of 400–600 nm is attributed to the contribution of DIBC. Compared with the pure PTB7-Th based film, the absorption peak in longer wavelength (600–800 nm) shows remarkable enhancement and red-shift for DIBC containing films, suggesting that the introduction of DIBC in PTB7-Th promotes the crystallizing procedure and accelerates efficient π–π stacking of polymers. These variations are also presented in ternary blends as demonstrated in Fig. 4(c). When 10% DIBC is doped in PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, the absorption spectrum of the ternary film shows an obvious elevations in the range of 300–900 nm compared with that of the binary film. This signifies that more photons can be harvested in ternary OSCs to yield higher JSCs. Concurrently, the crystallization and molecular parking properties are improved via intermolecular hydrogen-bond interaction, which tends to achieve a high FF for PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC containing OSC. Moreover, when the doping ratio of DIBC is increased to 20%, the IEICO-4F absorption peak shows an excessive blue-shift and a decrease in strength, which narrows the absorption spectra of the ternary blend and will result in declined JSC in the device. Fig. 4(d) shows the 580 nm excited photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure DIBC, PTB7-Th:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:20% DIBC containing films, the concentration of PTB7-Th maintains consistent in the blended films. DIBC shows a PL spectrum covers 600–800 nm, which exhibits huge overlap with the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th, indicating the potential to form efficient energy transfer between DIBC and PTB7-Th. When 10% and 20% DIBC are blended with PTB7-Th respectively, the emission peak of DIBC disappears, demonstrating that efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) indeed occurs in these blends to further strengthen photon utilization in the ternary system.

To examine the effect of hydrogen-bond strategy on photovoltaic property, the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:x% DIBC/MoO3/Ag has been applied, the small molecule DIBC acts as a nonvolatile third component in the ternary OSCs and has been added individually outside of the host system. x% is the weight ratio of DIBC and its adjustment range is 0% to 20%. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the binary and ternary OSCs under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5(a), the corresponding key parameters for all devices are summarized in Table 1. After continually optimizing the device fabrication process, the champion efficiency of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F containing binary OSCs reaches to 11.71% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.69 V, a JSC of 25.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.29%, which is much higher than most of previously reported results.17,32,33 When 10% DIBC is extra introduced to PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system as the third component, the maximum PCE of the NFA-OSCs is optimized to 13.53% with a VOC of 0.70, a JSC of 26.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.36%. It is obvious that the VOCs of ternary OSCs have little change compared with the binary device, while the FF has a huge enhancement from 65.29% to 71.36%. This is mainly attributed to the formation of hydrogen-bond between DIBC and IEICO-4F that suppresses the too strong aggregation of main-chain planar acceptor (IEICO-4F) and improves micro-morphology of the ternary film. The JSC also has an enhancement of 1.12 mA cm−2, which is due to the extended absorption spectra and improved donor/acceptor contact interface that promote exciton generation and dissociation. For comparison, ternary OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IEICO:DIBC have also been fabricated, in which IEICO doesn't have exposed F atoms compared with IEICO-4F.34 The J–V curves of the PTB7-Th:IEICO:DIBC containing OSCs with different DIBC content are shown in Fig. S1,† corresponding device parameters are listed in Table S1.† The ternary OSCs show similar device performance with that of the control device, suggesting that the introduction of DIBC has little influence on PTB7-Th:IEICO based OSCs. These also prove the fact that the hydrogen-bond interaction plays an important role on improving device performance of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based solar cells. Besides, via changing the pattern of the shadow mask, a bigger active area of 11 mm2 has achieved. Ternary OSC using this pattern also obtains an excellent efficiency of 13.39% as revealed in Table 1, suggesting that the results of our OSCs are reliable. However, further adding the amount of DIBC to 20%, the JSC decreases to 26.01 mA cm−2, which is caused by the narrowed absorption spectrum that harvests less photon than 10% DIBC containing OSC, as revealed in Fig. 4(c). Fig. 5(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) properties of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:20% DIBC containing OSCs, which are utilized to calibrate the JSC of the devices in this work. The calculated JSCs from EQE curves exhibit a small deviation less than 5% as recorded in Table 1. Along with increasing DIBC content from 0% to 20%, the EQE curves show little blue-shift, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the blended films. The blue-shift also indicates that the introduction of DIBC weakens π–π stacking effect of NFA. Concurrently, the ternary OSCs show enhanced EQE values in the range of 600–800 nm, which is ascribed to the increased crystallization of the polymer donor.

To explore the potential application of the ternary strategy, the reproducibility and shelf-life of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC containing OSC are examined as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). Statistics on 30 samples, the PCEs of the ternary OSCs are mainly distributed in the range of 12.8% to 13.6% and show an average PCE of 13.24%, suggesting that the high efficiency ternary OSC owns a good repeatability and has the potential for mass production. As the NFA material IEICO-4F possesses a nearly planar geometry which results in much stronger crystallization and aggregation, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F containing device always shows inferior storage life for the serious phase separation. As presented in Fig. 5(d), after storing the binary and ternary OSCs in ambient condition (room light, T of 25 °C, RH of 25%) for 90 days, the PCE of the binary device drops to 5.38%, which shows 44.38% degeneration than its primitive state. However, with adding 10% DIBC in the binary system, the shelf-life has been greatly enhanced. The PCE of the ternary OSC keeps at 85.02% with the efficiency of 11.54%, which is almost two times higher than that of the control device. The enhancement in the device shelf-life benefits from the hydrogen-bond between DIBC and IEICO-4F that modulates the crystallization, ordered stacking, distribution and miscibility of IEICO-4F, which can be demonstrated as follows.
Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), which is a powerful technique for detecting the atoms or groups distribution in vertical direction, is utilized to investigate the materials' depth distribution information that exists within films. Fig. 6(a) shows the TOF-SIMS depth profiles of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC, the detection starting from active layer to ZnO layer. CN– ion is assigned to IEICO-4F for the binary film and represents for both DIBC and IEICO-4F for the ternary film. The CN– intensity difference between the two samples means the content of DIBC in vertical direction. The profiles in first 30 s are meaningless, which may be caused by surface contamination. The CN– intensity increases along with the sputtering time increases from 30 to 100 s, suggesting that DIBC mainly distributes at the middle and lower of the active layer for both two samples. Within the range of 100–500 seconds, the ternary film shows higher intensity than the binary film and the intensity difference is relatively equal, that is to say DIBC has a similar distribution rule with IEICO-4F, which may be caused by the hydrogen-bond between DIBC and IEICO-4F that ties the two molecules together. Fig. 6(b) reveals the two-dimensional focus profiles for the binary and ternary films at 100 second scan, in which MC and TC respectively means maximum counts and total counts of CN– ion at this depth. It is obvious that the intensity of CN– in ternary film is much higher than that of the binary film, which is attributed to the contribution of DIBC. According to the results of TOF-SIMS analysis, we can speculate that the introduction of DIBC improves the distribution of IEICO-4F, avoids inferior NFA aggregation and enlarges the crystal lattice spacing of IEICO-4F. To demonstrate this, film morphology and molecular crystal orientation have been studied as follows.

The influence of introducing DIBC into host system has been investigated via atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement, the images of the binary and ternary films are revealed in Fig. S2(a) and (b),† the image size is 5 μm × 5 μm. Without the optimization of intermolecular hydrogen-bond interaction, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F containing film shows noticeable heterogeneous morphology with a high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.56 nm, which is attributed to the serious aggregation of IEICO-4F domains. When 10% DIBC is introduced in the binary system, this inferior aggregation has been well controlled. As a result, an improved RMS of 0.87 nm is achieved for the ternary film, the uniform surface topography indicating a better interface contact than that of the binary film, which is responsible for high JSCs and PCEs of the ternary OSCs. The aggregation and phase separation can be directly observed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC containing films are respectively displayed in Fig. 7(a) and (b). The binary film shows remarkable phase separation, which may be caused by the serious aggregation effect of main-chain planar molecule IEICO-4F, after introducing 10% DIBC in the binary system, the bulk aggregated block vanishes from sight, instead of bi-continuous interpenetrating network structure. Concurrently, the donor and acceptor are mixed evenly. The improved film morphology provides more donor/acceptor contact interface and constructs efficient charge transport channels, as a result, higher exciton dissociation and lower charge recombination would be realized for the ternary OSC compared with the control device. To further explore the influence of the hydrogen-bond on molecular crystallization and packing characteristics in this system, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is performed on pure IEICO-4F, IEICO-4F:10% DIBC, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC containing films. As shown in Fig. 8(a) and (e), pure IEICO-4F film shows typical face-on orientation in the out of plane (OOP) direction, which is beneficial for charge transfer. However, over-strong π–π stacking effect results in large domain size as depicted in TEM images. In the 1D profile, IEICO-4F shows a strong π–π stacking peak at qz = 18.48 nm−1 with the corresponding stacking distance of 3.39 Å. When 10% DIBC is added to IEICO-4F as shown in Fig. 8(b), the intensity of crystallization decreases along with a reduced qz of 18.25 nm−1, the corresponding π–π stacking distance increases to 3.44 Å. The crystal coherence length (CCL), which is used to estimate mean size of the crystallites, is calculated from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a diffraction peak by the Scherrer equation.35 The CCL for pure IEICO-4F and IEICO-4F:DIBC are estimated to be 4.09 and 3.55 nm, respectively. The declined crystal size and enhanced stacking distance are ascribed to the introduction of DIBC that forms hydrogen-bond with IEICO-4F. For PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC containing films, the 2D patterns (Fig. 8(c) and (d)) as well as 1D curves (Fig. 8(f)) exhibit obvious face-on orientation in the OOP direction, suggesting that the introduction of DIBC doesn't destroy the primary charge transfer channels. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based binary film shows a strong π–π stacking peak of 18.54 nm−1 which relates to the scattering signal of IEICO-4F. While the DIBC doped ternary film shows a qz of 18.38 nm−1, corresponding to a larger π–π stacking distance of 3.42 Å and smaller CCL of 4.12 nm, compared with the binary film (d = 3.38 Å, CCL = 4.38 nm). The enlarged stacking distance and decreased crystal size indicate that the aggregation effect of NFAs also has been controlled in the ternary OSCs, which tends to enhance JSC and FF of the device, and achieve high PCE (Table 2).

The variation of ternary film morphology is closely related to the charge dynamics in the device. To investigate the impact of DIBC on exciton dissociation, charge transfer and recombination, we characterize the binary and ternary devices by measuring charge carrier mobility, light intensity depended JSC and photocurrent density versus effective voltage properties. Charge carrier mobility is studied via the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method as previously reported.36,37Fig. 9(a) and (b) respectively shows the fitting curves of hole and electron mobility for the binary and DIBC based ternary OSCs, the corresponding mobility values are inserted in the images. With the doping ratio of DIBC increasing from 0% to 20% in ternary OSCs, the hole mobility (μh) increases from 3.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is ascribed to the enhanced crystallization of PTB7-Th. Nevertheless, the electron mobility shows a downtrend from 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is attributed to the enlarged π–π stacking distance. Besides, the ternary OSC shows slightly higher charge balance factor (μh/μe) than that of the control device, the differences between the mobility of hole and electron are less than an order, which is not the sole reason for the improved efficiencies in solar cell devices.38 The charge recombination process is studied by measuring the dependence of JSCs on varied light intensity (Plight). The relationship between JSCs and Plight abides by the power-law connection:JSC ∝ Plightαwhere α < 1.00 indicates that bimolecular recombination is a limiting factor to the device performance. When α value approaches to 1.00 means bimolecular recombination could be ignored on the extracted current. Fig. 9(c) shows the JSCs versus Plight curves of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% DIBC and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:20% DIBC containing devices, the corresponding α values are inserted in the image. The α values of 0%, 10% and 20% DIBC doped OSCs are determined to be 0.963, 0.998 and 0.993, respectively, suggesting that the addition of DIBC can reduce bimolecular recombination initially, and then enhances the JSC and FF of ternary OSCs. While a slight decrease in the α value in binary device is caused by the bimolecular recombination loss or space charge effects.

The decrease in charge recombination always corresponds to efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, which can be proved via illumination dependent photocurrent (JPH = JL − JD) versus the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vapp), where JL and JD is the current density of the devices that are measured with or without light radiation (100 mW cm−2), respectively. V0 is the voltage corresponding to JPH = 0, Vapp is the applied voltage. Generally, exciton dissociation ratio can be defined as JSC/Jsat, in which Jsat is the saturated photocurrent at a large Veff over 2 V. Charge collection ratio can be extracted with the relation of Jpower/Jsat, where Jpower derives from maximum power output.39Fig. 9(d) shows the JPHversus Veff curves of the binary and ternary OSCs, corresponding ηdiss and ηcoll values are listed in the image. A μdiss of 92.09% and a μcoll of 76.64% have been calculated for the binary OSC. When 10% DIBC is added to the binary system, the ternary OSC shows enhanced μdiss of 96.42% and μcoll of 83.90%, respectively. The exciton dissociation and charge collection processes have been strengthened, which is ascribed to the optimized phase separation. Further increasing the content of DIBC to 20%, μdiss and μcoll show slight decrease, which is the result of increased charge recombination. From above, we can conclude that 10% DIBC based ternary OSC not only owns high exciton dissociation efficiency, but also has excellent charge collection ratio, both of them make contributions to a high JSC.
To further demonstrate the applicability of the hydrogen-bond based ternary strategy, DIBC is introduced to another popular NIR NFA system PBDB-TF (also known as PM6):Y6 which has an ultra-high efficiency over 15% in the literature.30,40 The molecular structures of PBDB-TF, Y6 and DIBC are shown in Fig. S3.† Y6 owns two fluorine-substituted 2FIC units on the both side of its main chain, which is identical to IEICO-4F, so we deduce that DIBC also can form intermolecular hydrogen-bond interaction with Y6. Fig. 10(a) shows the current density versus voltage curves of PBDB-TF:Y6 and PBDB-TF:Y6:10% DIBC containing OSCs, the detailed device performance is listed in Table 3. The absorption spectra and relevant device structure with material energy levels are revealed in Fig. S4.† The control device shows a maximum PCE of 15.01% with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 25.17 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.82%, which is similar to the literature values. After extra adding 10% DIBC in this system, a champion efficiency of 16.41% with enhanced JSC of 25.61 mA cm−2 and improved FF of 77.12% has been achieved. The corresponding EQE curves as shown in Fig. 10(b), the experimental values show small deviation with the calculated JSCs. The slight JSC enhancement in ternary OSC is mainly ascribed to the increased photon harvest, while the huge improvement in FF may be caused by the improved film morphology which is initially demonstrated by TEM measurement. As shown in Fig. 10(c), although the binary film shows slight aggregations, obvious interpenetrating networks also can be discerned in the enlarged image (0.2 μm scale range), which guarantees efficient charge transfer in the binary device and results in a high JSC. When 10% DIBC is introduced in the binary system, the ternary film shows homogeneous film morphology. Give an attention to the enlarged TEM image in Fig. 10(d), the ternary film not only keeps original interpenetrating networks, but also suppresses adverse aggregations of the binary system, as a result, remarkable enhancement in FF has been achieved for the ternary OSC. Fig. S2(c) and (d)† respectively shows the AFM images of PBDB-TF:Y6 and PBDB-TF:Y6:10% DIBC containing films. Both of the two films have good contact interface, which guarantee high performance for this system. Furthermore, more details in respect of hydrogen-bond interaction, molecular distribution, device stability and soon on still need a deeper investigation in the future. These results demonstrate that hydrogen-bond based ternary strategy is an efficient and convenient approach to develop high performance NFA-OSCs.

Conclusion
In conclusion, high efficiency and long shelf-life fullerene-free organic solar cells have been achieved via utilizing intermolecular hydrogen-bond based ternary strategy. Here, we focus on NIR NFAs with main-chain planar configuration, via forming hydrogen-bond between NFAs and the third component DIBC to modulate the crystallization and packing characteristics of the NFAs. As the results, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:DIBC based ternary OSC showed a high PCE of 13.53% and an excellent shelf-life in ambient condition. After 90 days storage, the ternary device still kept 85.02% PCE than the pristine state, which almost is two times higher than the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based binary device. Moreover, developing this unique strategy into another popular system PBDB-TF:Y6, the ternary OSC achieved a superior efficiency of 16.41%, which is one of the highest efficiency in reported works. These results demonstrate that the hydrogen-bond based ternary strategy is an efficient and convenient way to optimize the performance of main-chain planar NFAs based OSCs and has potential to construct high performance OSCs.
Experimental section
General information
PTB7-Th, PBDB-TF, IEICO-4F and Y6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. (Beijing). 3-(Diethylamino)-7-imino-7H-benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]chromeno[3,2-c]pyridine-6-carbonitrile (DIBC) was purchased from TCI Shanghai Corp. Chlorobenzene (CB), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and zinc acetate dihydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 were purchased from Xi'an p-OLED Technology Corp. Chloroform (CF) was purified in our lab via distillation equipment. All reagents and solvents were used directly as received.
Device fabrication
Inverted device structure: ITO/ZnO/Active layer/MoO3/Ag was used for the binary and ternary OSCs in this work. The ITO substrates were cleaned by the ultra-sonication treatment with the solution of detergent, ultrapure water, ethanol, acetone, and ethanol in turn, and then were dried with nitrogen blow. After 30 minutes ultraviolet-ozone treatment, ZnO precursor was dropped on the substrates and spin-coated to form 20 nm thin films, in which the precursor solution was formed via mixing zinc acetate dihydrate (110 mg) and ethanolamine (31 mg) with 2-methoxyethanol solution (1 ml) over a night. The PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1:1.5) and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:DIBC (1:1.5:x) blends were dissolved in CB:CN (96:4, volume ratio) solution with a donor concentration of 8 mg ml−1. The PBDB-TF:Y6 (1:1.2) and PBDB-TF:Y6:DIBC (1:1.2:x) blends were dissolved in CF:CN (99:1, volume ratio) solution with a donor concentration of 7 mg ml−1. The active layer thickness was optimized to 130 nm for better device performance. Afterwards, a 10 nm hole transport layer MoO3 and 150 nm electrode Ag were formed via vacuum deposition. An active area of 2.3 or 11.0 mm2 was formed through different shadow masks.
Measurements
The absorption and PL spectra of the single/blended components contained films were recorded by Hitachi U-3010 UV-VS and F-4600 spectrophotometer, respectively. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were performed by Bruker 80v FT-IR spectrometer. The thickness of active layer was calibrated by a step profilometer (AMBIOS-XP2). Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was studied by an ION TOF-SIMS 5. Dual-beam dynamic SIMS mode was used to provide high depth resolution and chemical resolution. Bi+ was utilized as the primary ion and Cs+ was employed as a sputtering source. Active layer surface topography was measured by atomic force microscope (AFM) under ambient conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi TEM system), which performed in “Ceshigo Research Service, http://www.ceshigo.com”, was used to investigate the film surface morphology. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured at BL18U beam line of shanghai synchrotron radiation facility (SSRF) and used to analyze the molecule crystallization and stacking property. All samples were radiated at 12.67 keV X-ray with an incident angle of 0.05–0.12°. Pilatus 2M is the detector. Simulated molecular geometries were performed with quantum chemistry calculations by Gaussian 09. The hybridized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) basis set. The geometries of DIBC and IEICO-4F were optimized separately in the first, after bonding the two optimized molecules together, the final structure was optimized again. The current density–voltage (J–V) property was detected by a Keithley 2400 source meter instrument, PCE of the OSCs was calculated from J–V curves which was measured under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight radiation (Newport Oriel Sol3A Simulator, calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell). The EQE test was performed with a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System. The charge mobility was measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with single carrier devices. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Au for holes and ITO/ZnO/Active layer/LiF/Al for electrons. The calculation equations were defined as follows: JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμ((V2)/(L3))(1)and (2)where ε0 is vacuum permittivity and defined as 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1εr is relative permittivity and approximately equal to 3.00. V is the internal voltage in the device and V = Vappl − Vbi. μ is the calculated carrier mobility and μ0 is the zero electric field mobility. β is a coefficient that is proportional to the Poole–Frenkel factor.41L is the distance between the cathode and the anode.
