    , Accepted 3rd March 2011First published on 30th March 2011AbstractThe aerosol chemical vapor deposition (ACVD) process allows for the synthesis of nanostructured films with well tuned morphologies that can be controlled based on the desired functionality and application. A robust understanding of the process parameters that result in desired features of the film is elucidated. One dimensional TiO2 nanostructured columns that have superior properties for solar energy harvesting and conversion applications were deposited on tin doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates. The sintering of the deposited particles was a key factor in the growth of the 1D structure with desired crystal planes. By ensuring that the sintering rate is faster than the arrival rate of deposited particles; a 1D columnar structure could be obtained. The sintering rate was controlled by the temperature and depositing particle size. As the columns grew in length, the increased thermal conduction resistance resulted in a drop in temperature and subsequently a slowing of the sintering process in upper regions of the film. This led to growth of branched structures rather than continued growth in a preferred direction. The growth of the branched structure could be overcome by enhancing the sintering rate by increasing the substrate temperature or reducing the depositing particle size (by lowering the feed rate of the precursor). The phenomenon was also confirmed by using different deposition substrates, such as FTO and glass. Dye sensitized solar cell performance efficiencies with different column lengths of 2 and 7 µm were determined to be 1.8 and 2.7% respectively.
1. Introduction
Population increase and economic development have resulted in increased global energy consumption. The total consumption per year is estimated to become 40.8 TW by 2050.1,2 Due to limited natural resources and to overcome negative environmental effects such as climate change caused by carbon dioxide emission from the combustion of fossil fuels, renewable and sustainable energy sources are required. While solar energy is considered to be an unlimited energy source, its high production cost and small scale are major obstacles for its wide utilization.

        Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has novel photocatalytic properties and is a low cost semiconducting material. TiO2 has been widely used for photovoltaic cells,3–6 for photoelectrochemical cells to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen,7–12 and for converting CO2 into useful fuel gases.13–15 In addition to the intrinsic properties of TiO2, the morphology of the film is an important parameter that governs overall performance efficiencies. Single crystal-phase TiO2 nanostructures with one-dimensional (1D) orientation, such as nanotubes, nanowires, columns, and nanorods, have shown better photocatalytic performance than those of planar or random orientation structures.8,9,11,12,16–18 There are several reasons why 1D TiO2 nanostructures have improved photocatalytic performance. First, the surface area of the 1D film is larger than that of planar films.9,19 Second, single crystals enhance electron mobility by significantly reducing grain boundary effects,16,20 resulting in longer electron lifetimes.8 Finally, a well-constructed space charge layer along the longitudinal direction of the TiO2 nanocrystal and a high aspect ratio resulting in a higher concentration of electron donors leads to a reduced electron–hole recombination rate as well as an increased electron lifetime.21,22
A number of deposition techniques have been employed to immobilize TiO2 with 1D orientation onto a substrate.11,12,17,23–28 The recently developed aerosol-chemical vapor deposition (ACVD) process9 to synthesize metal oxide films with columnar morphologies has several significant advantages over other existing methods. Since ACVD is a one-step process that operates at ambient pressure, the system is an economically viable process that can readily be scaled-up. It should be noted that the ACVD process is different from the aerosol assisted CVD process29 and the flame aerosol reactor process.16 Unlike conventional metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) methods,23–26,30–32 the nanostructured film morphologies can be well controlled by understanding the key process parameters during deposition. In addition to the residence time, the temperature-dependent sintering rate of TiO2 nanoparticles33 also influences film morphologies.8,9,16 The morphological differences are caused by varying sintering rates, which in turn depend on the temperature. However, the thermal conduction effects that dictate the temperature profile in the columnar structure have not been systematically studied.
In this study, the role of thermal conduction on the growth mechanism of columnar TiO2 films is discussed. The film growth mechanisms on the substrate with respect to various sintering rates are suggested. Both the TiO2 film thickness-induced sintering behavior and its effect on the growth mechanism of columnar TiO2 films are examined. The substrate thickness-induced thermal conduction effects on the film growth mechanism are described for different substrates. In addition, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are made from a selection of TiO2 films synthesized by ACVD. The performance of these DSSCs is compared with porous TiO2 cells formed from sintered nanoparticles.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of TiO2 thin films and characterization

Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a precursor to TiO2. TiO2 coating samples were prepared with three different glass substrates: tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) coated aluminosilicate glass (Delta Technologies, Stillwater, MN), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated EAGLE-XG (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY), and normal glass microscope slide substrates (VWR International). The thicknesses of the glass substrates were 0.7, 0.7, and 0.95 cm, respectively. A detailed description of the ACVD process is presented elsewhere.9 Depending on the residence time of the vapor precursor (τres), three different deposition regimes can be induced, which produce different types of film morphologies. For this study, τres was fixed at 20 ms except test 10; for test 10, it was 25 ms. Temperatures on the substrate were measured by a K type thermocouple (OMEGA Engineering Inc), and monitored by a temperature reader (OMEGA Engineering Inc). The precursor feed rate was 2.41 µmol min−1 for all tests except test 8 and test 10 in which the feed rates were 1.12 and 4.95 µmol min−1, respectively. For comparison, “standard” TiO2 films were synthesized on extra pieces of the same substrates as used for ACVD TiO2 deposition. Two slurries were used to obtain the TiO2 coating: (1) Aerodisp W2730x, shaken well before using, and (2) Aeroxide TiO2 P25, prepared as a ∼6.5 wt% slurry in ethanol and mixed with PEG (Mw 10K, ∼60%wt H2O solution) in a 2:1 w/w ratio. The slurries were made into TiO2 coatings through a ‘layer by layer’ process. The W2730x TiO2 slurry was coated onto the substrate by spin-coating (Spincoater, Model P6700 Series, Specialty Coating System, Inc) at 1500 rpm for 30 s with a ramping set at 30 s—achieving a transparent TiO2 coating. These films were dried at 100 °C, then sintered in a furnace, ramping from RT to 250 °C at 10 °C min−1, holding for 30 min, then ramping to 450 °C at 10 °C min−1 and holding for 30 min, then cooling to RT at the natural heat loss rate of the furnace. The P25/PEG (Mw 10K) slurry was drop-cast onto the initial coating—forming the opaque secondary coating and subsequently fired again with the same temperature profile. The thickness and morphology of as-deposited TiO2 films were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 2300) operating at 15 kV. The crystallinity of the sample films was characterized by an X-ray diffraction technique (XRD, Rigaku D-MAX) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
2.2 Tests for dye-sensitized solar cells

          TiO2 films as synthesized by ACVD were used. Excess TiO2 was removed from each film by a razor blade to leave 1 cm2 square patches. Before dying, the TiO2 coated substrates were cleaned by air plasma for 5 min. TiO2 films were dyed for 24 h in a 0.2 mg mL−1 solution of Ruthenium 535 (N3) dye (Solaronix) in 200 proof ethanol. Back electrodes were prepared from FTO-coated glass with a thin platinum catalytic layer made by dropping platisol (Solaronix), which was then fired at 400 °C for 10 minutes. A low-temperature melting adhesive film (Integra 709, Surlyn) with a thickness of 50.8 µm was used as gasket material to assemble the cells. The film was cut to shape and clamped between the two substrates, and then heated at 125 °C for 5–7 min to bond the gasket to each substrate. An electrolyte was made following a published formulation.34Cells were filled under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove-bag and sealed with Adhesive Tech High Temp hot glue. Prepared DSSCs were tested using a Solar Simulator to provide AM1.5 illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The voltage and current output of the cells were recorded as the external load resistance was varied.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Deposition mechanisms in the mixed vapor–particle regime by the ACVD process
Based on our findings in a previous study,9 columnar TiO2 films can be formed by the deposition mechanisms prevalent in the mixed vapor–particle regime. By manipulating the forces acting on particles, including convection force, diffusion force, thermophoresis, and van der Waals interactions between particles, 1D oriented structures can be formed on the substrate.35,36Fig. 1 illustrates deposition pathways in the mixed vapor–particle regime for the ACVD process. Three different morphologies: the columnar type, the branched-tree type, and the granular type can be formed, depending on the sintering rate (a function of temperature and particle size). If the substrate temperature is high enough for as-deposited particles to be sintered rapidly, the final film structures can be grown with a 1D orientation. Conversely, if the substrate temperature is not high enough or if the initial particle sizes are too large, the sintering time for particles is much longer than the travel time of a particle. The particles that are deposited on the substrate are only partially sintered, forming a randomly oriented granular structure. For the branched-tree type structure, initially columnar structures are formed on the substrate. However, as the columnar structure grows with a 1D orientation, the surface temperature on the TiO2 structure decreases in the axial direction because of reduced thermal conduction. The sintering rate is decreased, causing the offshoot structures from the main columnar structure. The sintering rate strongly influences final film morphologies. Temperature is an important parameter that impacts the sintering rate.

3.2 Comparison of sintering and arrival rate during the synthesis process
To investigate the temperature profile within the TiO2 structure, a simple heat conduction model with a single TiO2 columnar structure was used. The simplified heat transfer model is described in Fig. 2. It is assumed that the TiO2 structure has a rod-like shape with a diameter of 300 nm, and it is in complete contact with the heated TCO (transparent conductive oxide) substrate. It is further assumed that the primary mechanism is heat conduction from the heated substrate to the TiO2 structure in the axial direction only (thermal radiation from the surface is neglected). The temperature profile within the columnar TiO2 structure with respect to the length of the film l is given by37 (1)where ; T∞ and Ts are respectively an ambient air temperature and a substrate temperature; h is the heat convection coefficient of air (∼100 W m−2 K); k is the thermal conductivity of the TiO2 columns. The thermal conductivity of the TiO2 used in this study is 1.12 W m−1 K, as the columnar structures are highly oriented having an anatase crystal phase.38D and Ac are respectively the perimeter and cross-sectional area of the TiO2 column. As the film grows, heat resistance along the axial direction of the TiO2 structure increases, and the surface temperature in the upper region of the column decreases compared to that of the lower region of the column.
 Fig. 2  Simplified 1D heat conduction model with a single columnar TiO2 structure on the TCO substrate. 
The characteristic times for sintering along the axis of the TiO2 structure are estimated using the temperature profile T(l). Since the melting temperature of TiO2 is high, solid-state diffusion is the main mechanism for sintering. Depending on the neck growth formed between two particles during a sintering process, two stages of sintering can be defined: the initial stage and the final stage.39 Assuming the grain boundary model is applicable to both the initial and the final stages, the characteristic times for sintering with respect to the length of the film, τf (l), are given by39 (2) where k is the Boltzmann constant; T(l) is the temperature profile within the columnar TiO2 structure with respect to the length of the film l, which is estimated from eqn (1); r is the radius of the particle; b is the boundary width of the grain; Db is the diffusion coefficient of the grain boundary; and Ω is the atomic volume.

Fig. 3 shows the surface temperature changes caused by reduced heat transfer due to increased film thickness and the characteristic time for sintering of as-deposited particles. When the substrate temperature Ts was set at 500 °C and T∞ (the temperature of the air around the precursor feeding tube) at 230 °C, the resulting temperature decrease calculated using eqn (1) was 10.2 °C for an 8 µm TiO2 column. If the heat radiation effect from the surface of the columnar TiO2 structure and the cooling effect due to precursor feeding were taken into account, the temperature decrease would be larger than 10.2 °C, though radiative transfer is not expected to be large. By coupling the temperature profile, the characteristic time for sintering can be estimated with respect to the film thickness. For sintering of monomer sized TiO2 particles, τf (l = 0) and τf (l = 8 µm) were 0.279 s and 0.477 s. Comparing τf (l) and the time between arrivals of the deposited particle, tarv, the deposition behavior can be characterized as particle arrival limited and sintering limited growth. For the deposition conditions, tarv was estimated to be 0.458 s. In the particle arrival limited region, where τf (l) is shorter than tarv, previously deposited particles are completely sintered into the columnar structure before the next particle arrives on the structure, resulting in well-sintered columnar structures with 1D orientation. Conversely, in the sintering limited region, where τf (l) is longer than tarv, due to partial sintering effects, this longer τf (l) causes surface roughness, which both enhances the surface reaction of the vapor precursor and attracts more particles due to larger van der Waal forces than other deposition sites. Depending on the sintering status, various morphologies, from branched structures to granular structures can be formed. These qualitative analyses of deposition mechanisms are helpful for understanding how to control film structures. Both TiO2 column length-induced and substrate thickness-induced sintering behaviors and their effects on film morphologies deposited by the ACVD process are now discussed. Experimental conditions for synthesizing TiO2 films by the ACVD process are summarized in Table 1.

3.3 Nanostructured TiO2 column growth with increased film thickness

          TiO2 thin films were synthesized on ITO substrates under seven experimental conditions. The residence time τres of the vapor precursor in the ACVD reactor and the precursor feed rate were maintained at 20 ms and 2.41 µmol min−1, respectively. The total deposition times were varied with each test as follows: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min (tests 1–7) τres of 20 ms allows the TTIP vapor precursor to partially decompose and form small TiO2 particles. TiO2 columns are deposited in the mixed vapor–particle regime. As particles are deposited on the substrate with 1D orientation, the vapor precursor reacted on the surface of the existing structure. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films prepared for tests 1–4. It was observed that because of the tendency to form the A (112) crystal plane, the relative peak representing the A (112) crystal plane became stronger as the total deposition time increased. A periodic bond chain (PBC) theory is applicable to explain this crystal plane preference during the synthesis process. TiO2 A (anatase) (112) is a high-surface-energy plane relative to A (001) and A (101).23,40 Thus, the A (112) crystal plane is preferred during the deposition. This preferred orientation growth is also observed with other materials, if coarsening particles are small.41 As shown in Fig. 5(A)–(C), the TiO2 columns were vertically grown with 1D orientation. However, for a deposition time of 75, 90, and 120 min (tests 5–7), other anatase crystal planes A (101) and A (004) were observed along with A (112). The XRD patterns for the films produced in tests 5–7 imply that the film growth no longer had a preferred A (112) growth orientation. As the TiO2 columns grew, it was observed that branches of TiO2 sprouted from the main TiO2 column structure. The structural difference between columnar and branched type TiO2 structures was observed in Fig. 5(B) and (D). The reduced heat transfer within each single columnar structure resulted in partial sintering of as-deposited particles. Randomly oriented columns sprouted from the original structure of these deposited particles. Fig. 5(E) and (F) illustrate the growth mechanism for the branched type TiO2 structure.
 Fig. 4

For tests 1–5, TiO2 films were prepared for different deposition times, 15 min (test 1), 30 min (test 2), 45 min (test 3), 60 min (test 4), 75 min (test 5), 90 min (test 6), and 120 min (test 7) with 500 °C as the substrate temperature, 20 ms of τres, and 2.83 µmol min−1 of the precursor feed rate. For tests 8 and 9, the lower precursor feed rate (1.31 µmol min−1) was introduced (test 8) and the higher substrate temperature (600 °C) was applied (test 9) to the ACVD system, while other deposition conditions were the same as test 7. 
 Fig. 5  
            Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of tests 1, 4, and 5–9. (A) is the side view of columnar TiO2 structures on the ITO substrate for 15 min deposition (test 1). (B) and (C) represent the side view and 15° tilted view of the columnar TiO2 film for 60 min deposition (test 4). (D) shows the branched columnar TiO2 morphology for 75 min deposition (test 5). (E) and (F) respectively represent the initial state of the branched structure (test 5) and the fully developed branched structure (test 6). (G)–(I) show side views of randomly branched columnar TiO2 morphology for 120 min deposition (test 7) and suppressed random grown structures by lowering the precursor feed rate (test 8) and by increasing the substrate temperature (test 9). 
To suppress branched growth, particles have to be completely sintered as soon as they deposit on the columns. According to eqn (2), both the temperature T(l) and the particle size r are two important parameters for controlling the sintering process. During film synthesis by the ACVD process, the effects of these two parameters on film morphologies were examined.
Particle growth in the ACVD system is limited by collisions between particles in the gas phase prior to deposition. Lower feed rates of the vapor precursor generate lower particle number concentrations in the system; thus collisions between the particles become less frequent resulting in smaller size particles. For test 8, the precursor feed rate was 1.12 µmol min−1, lower than the feed rate of 2.41 µmol min−1 for previous tests 1–7, while other parameters such as the substrate temperature, the residence time of the vapor precursor, and the total deposition time were the same (as tests 1–7). Although the ratio of TiO2 particles to the vapor precursor for a residence time of 20 ms was 13%; the absolute number of particles decreased as the precursor feed rate decreased by 1.29 µmol min−1. As evidenced in Fig. 5(H), the reduced number of particles suppressed the branched growth. Due to the presence of fewer particles, the collision frequency between particles was reduced, which led to a lower probability for particle collisions and particle growth. Furthermore, since the particle deposition rate was reduced, there was a smaller chance that particles would be partially sintered.
The effects of substrate temperature on the deposition mechanisms were explored. When the substrate temperature was increased to 600 °C (test 9), the sintering rate was 100 times faster than it was at 500 °C. The sintering time difference is very uniform over the entire structure. At the higher substrate temperature of 600 °C, the vapor precursor reacted to a greater extent, approximately 38% more than at 500 °C for the same residence time of 20 ms. The larger number of particles produced by the accelerated reaction of the vapor precursor increased the growth rate of the film. At the same time, the larger number of particles enhanced the collision rate between particles, leading to the formation of larger particles that required a longer sintering time. Fig. 5(I) shows two distinct morphologies associated with the higher substrate temperature of 600 °C. Note that the columnar structure with a thickness of 30 µm and the branched structure existed at the same time. The higher substrate temperature not only enhanced the sintering rate of the particles but also provided more opportunities for the formation of larger particles, which led to thicker columnar and branched TiO2 structures, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the XRD data show a mixed anatase-rutile crystal phase, with an anatase fraction of 0.78 for test 9.
Because the TiO2 columns grew with an increased deposition time, the surface temperature on the TiO2 columns decreased due to reduced heat conduction within the columnar structure. Thus the film lost its preferred growth orientation, resulting in a randomly branched structure. To control the branched structure, two parameters: the temperature T(l) and the particle size r, both of which determine the sintering rate of the deposited particles, should be carefully controlled.
3.4 Nanostructured TiO2 film growth on different substrates
To understand the substrate-induced thermal conduction effects on film growth mechanisms, three different substrates were used: ITO-coated aluminosilicate glass, FTO-coated EAGLE-XG, and normal microscope glass slides. These substrates were of different thicknesses and coated with different conductive materials. First, to explore the substrate temperature effects directly, two TiO2 films were deposited on the ITO substrate, and their film morphologies were compared (tests 4 and 10). For test 10, the substrate temperature was 450 °C, which was lower than for test 4. However, the precursor feed rate and the residence time were increased to 4.95 µmol min−1 and 25 ms. These deposition conditions led to a lower sintering rate than that used for test 4. Fig. 6 shows that the XRD results confirmed that the as-deposited sample lost its preferred crystal plane: A (101) was dominant rather than A (112) for test 10. Fig. 7(A) indicates that the lowered sintering rates caused partially sintered particle deposits and resulted in branched-columnar structures on the substrate.
 Fig. 6

Tests 4 and 10 were on an ITO coated glass, test 11 was on a FTO coated glass, and tests 12–15 were on the normal glass. Deposition conditions for tests 4, 11–12 were the same except for the substrate: deposition time of 60 min, substrate temperature of 500 °C, and τres of 20 ms. 
 Fig. 7  
            SEM images of as-deposited TiO2 films on the ITO substrate with lower substrate temperature, longer residence time (test 10) (A), on the FTO substrate (test 11) with same deposition conditions (B), and on the normal glass slides (tests 12 and 14). For tests 11 and 12, deposition conditions were same as test 4. For test 14 (D), substrate temperature was higher than test 12 (C). 

          TiO2 thin films were then synthesized on FTO substrates and on glass slides by ACVD under the same deposition conditions as test 4 respectively. From Fig. 6, the XRD results of both tests 4 and 11 showed the same preferred orientation of A (112), while test 12 resulted in different preferred crystal planes: A (101) and A (004). Film growth orientations were verified by SEM images. Fig. 7(B) and (C) show that while columnar morphologies were formed on FTO substrates, irregular rods were formed on the normal glass substrate. Under the same deposition conditions, TiO2 columns on the ITO and FTO substrates grew with the same preferred A (112) crystal plane and the same growth orientation. The ITO and FTO substrates were of the same thickness (0.7 cm). Conductive oxides (ITO and FTO), which are coated on glass substrates, are relatively thin (∼a few hundred nanometres). Their thermal conduction effects on the substrate temperature were negligible. The overall thermal conductivity of ITO and FTO substrates was mainly determined by the thickness of the glass. Thus, the same deposition mechanisms were applicable to both TCO substrates. However, in terms of the surface status and the thermal conduction of the substrate, the glass slide substrates were different from the ITO and FTO substrates. While the surface on the glass slide was amorphous, crystallized ITO and FTO layers were coated on the glasses for ITO and FTO substrates. Such amorphous surface might prefer different crystal planes A (101) and A (004) rather than A (112). The glass slide substrate was 0.2 mm thicker than the ITO and FTO substrates, and heat conduction from the heating elements was reduced. The surface temperature on the normal glass substrate was thus lower than the temperatures on the other two TCO substrates. With the decreased surface temperature, a longer characteristic time for the sintering of as-deposited particles was required. The resulting film morphology for test 12 was an irregular rod-type shape. The morphological differences between two groups, TCO substrates and normal glass slides, were attributed to their different sintering rates. To synthesize well-sintered columnar structures, the substrate temperature was increased to 525, 550, and 600 °C for tests 13–15. As shown in Fig. 7(D), final film morphologies were fairly vertically well-aligned columns on the glass slide with the increased substrate temperature. Unlike ITO substrates, when substrate temperatures exceed 550 °C, a TiO2 (B) crystal phase was observed rather than a TiO2 rutile crystal phase. This crystal phase transition from anatase (A) to TiO2 (B) might be closely influenced by the surface as well as by the substrate temperature.

          Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance comparisons
Both as-deposited columnar TiO2 films formed by ACVD and porous films formed by spin-coating nanoparticle suspensions were used as electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Fig. 8 illustrates configurations of DSSCs with a TiO2 columnar film and with a TiO2 porous film. These cells were compared under equivalent conditions, with film thicknesses of 2 µm and 7 µm deposited on the ITO, respectively. Performance results of tested DSSCs are summarized in Table 2, and Fig. 9 shows photocurrent–voltage curves. Average peak power efficiencies of 1.8% and 2.7% were measured for cells made from 2 µm thick and 7 µm thick ACVD films, respectively. Within the error of measurement, these efficiencies were the same as those of cells made from porous films produced from sintered P25. These results were partially due to the lower occupational volume of TiO2 in the ACVD films than in the sintered nano-particle (P25) films. As shown in Fig. 8, a porous TiO2 film had a larger surface area where dye molecules could be anchored, a single crystal columnar TiO2 film. A visual observation of the films clearly showed that the ACVD films had fewer dye molecules per total unit area than the P25 films. Given this lower dye uptake per unit area of each operational solar cell, the efficiency per dye molecule was much higher in the ACVD films to give comparable overall cell efficiencies. These results suggested that the columnar TiO2 structures transferred generated electrons from the dye to the TCO more efficiently. Columnar structures were not optimized for maximizing dye absorption in this study. This would be done, for example, by using thinner columns with lower columnar spacing. This is the subject of another study. Optimized columnar structures may therefore be more cost effective in operating DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
Different deposition patterns of TiO2 in the mixed vapor–particle regime were explored using various substrate temperatures, precursor feed rates, and substrate materials. TiO2 nanostructured columns grew with a preferred, crystal-phase orientation A (112) at 500 °C with a τres of 20 ms up to 60 min of the total deposition time. The thermal conduction from the substrate decreased as the TiO2 columnar structures grew along the axial direction, resulting in slower sintering rates. These slower sintering rates caused the formation of branches from well-sintered TiO2 columns, rather than growth in the preferred orientation. To suppress the growth of such branches, the sintering rates of the as-deposited particles were enhanced by lowering the precursor feed rate and increasing the substrate temperature. With the lower precursor feed rate, the growth of branched columns was inhibited. At an increased substrate temperature of 600 °C, thicker TiO2 columns formed with fewer branches due to the enhanced sintering rates. However, some branched structures still formed because the higher temperature of the substrate increased the decomposition rate of the precursor, which resulted in larger particles and slower sintering rates. Furthermore, the as-deposited TiO2 film had mixed anatase and rutile crystal phases. In addition, to investigate substrate thickness-induced heat conduction effects on film morphologies, nanostructured TiO2 columns were synthesized on different glass substrates. On ITO and FTO substrates, nanostructured TiO2 columns grew with 1D orientation, but on the normal glass substrate, which was 0.25 cm thicker than the ITO and FTO substrates, the film morphology exhibited an irregular rod-type shape. Increased substrate temperature was helpful to synthesize vertically aligned, well-sintered columnar structures on the glass slide. However, the crystal phase changed from anatase to TiO2 (B), not to rutile, at temperature of 600 °C. The substrate temperature had a considerable effect on the morphologies of the final films, while the substrate surface seemed to prefer crystal planes. Dye-sensitized solar cells with TiO2 films made by ACVD gave efficiencies that were comparable to those of films produced by sintering nano-particulate TiO2 in a more conventional manner. Increasing the film thickness while maintaining a columnar structure was likely to lead to increased efficiencies. ACVD films were not optimized for maximizing dye uptake in this study. The photocurrents generated per unit mass of dye were greater for the columnar film compared to the porous film. Larger columnar TiO2 surface area to volume ratios would likely increase the overall efficiency.
